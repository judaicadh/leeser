It<lb/> is indeed a handsome\n                edition. I am sorry that it came too<lb/> late to be noticed by me in the\n                Introduction<lb/> p. XV, which was printed before your Bible came to my<lb/> hands.\n                Still I shall notice it in its proper place.</p>\n            <p><persName>Dr. Huerst</persName> of <placeName>Leipzig</placeName> has (in his\n                Bibliotheca Judaica)<lb/> betrayed a profound ignorance of American literature.</p>\n            <p>So he wrote</p>\n            <p><persName>Isaac Leeser</persName> (Pr. in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>); The\n                Occident (Eine<lb/> Monatsschrift für jüd.

I\n                called his attention to<lb/> this and other facts, and he desired me to give\n                him<lb/> correct statements in regard to <placeName>America</placeName>. Please<lb/>\n                send me a list of your own books and those<lb/> edited by you, together with the\n                necessary dates.</p>\n            <p>I believe my friend <persName>Kalisch</persName> is with you in\n                    <placeName>Ph.</placeName> I pray<lb/> you to encourage him; he is too much of\n                an <add>עניו</add> and<lb/> needs cheering up, if we are to expect something great\n                of<lb/> him.</p>\n            <p>I send you the first volume of my history by mail<lb/> because this is the cheapest\n                way. If you should think<lb/> it worth while to <sic>criticise</sic> it, I will call\n                your attention<lb/> to the passages in it which are new, and therefore<lb/> exposed\n                to criticism.</p>\n            <p>1.
