Why<lb/> and\n                wherefore have you turned down my important articles without telling<lb/> me a word\n                ? “Is this the Torah and this its reward?” If I could have<lb/> suspected this, I\n                would have offered them to a different publication.<lb/> How can your newspaper\n                prosper ? In your time it has had a good develop-<lb/>ment. You will never be\n                finished with this stuff of <hi rend=\"underline\"><persName>de\n                Sala</persName></hi><lb/> when only the very few learned people in the world are\n                interested in it. “The dwel-<lb/>ler in heaven laughs”, for God hears my\n                    laughter<add>?</add>. “God mocks them”.<lb/> Whom, then, Who is interested in\n                    <persName>Ellis Joseph's</persName> present <hi rend=\"sup\">gift</hi>, who\n                leaves<lb/> his congregation like sheep without a shepherd? That's fodder for\n                the<lb/> “Messenger”. I regret this matter very much. This affair will be old<lb/>\n                news next week. I have some more material, especially <persName>Krones</persName>,\n                of <placeName>Bres-<lb/>lau</placeName>, sent me his excellent program for the\n                    <persName>Frankel</persName> seminary of <date>January<lb/> 27, 1866</date>, and\n                to have let me say good luck, through you. He gave <persName>Szold</persName> only\n                a<lb/> German certificate, for he had not attended the Seminary as a student;<lb/>\n                he only lodged with him, but did not study. He has no title <hi rend=\"underline\"\n                    >Morenu</hi>,<lb/> and certainly not the permissions to be a rabbi. He has a <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">Morenu</hi> and,<lb/> perhaps, even a <hi rend=\"underline\"\n                    >Semicha</hi> from the ultraorthodox <persName>Rabbi Tiktin</persName> in\n                    <placeName>Breslau</placeName>,<lb/> who writes willingly, without knowing the\n                warning of the rabbis. It is<lb/> a case of “A disqualified one who makes\n                illegitimate children legitimate”.<lb/> So you see again these ultraorthodox. There\n                is no fear of God in this<lb/> place, there is no God in another place.\n                    <persName>Frankel</persName> is hurt by your<lb/> failure to send him the\n                “Occident”. He will send you his “Monatschrifft”.<lb/> He wants to write against\n                    <persName>Szola</persName>. In exchange for that German certificate,<lb/>\n                <persName>Szola</persName> presented the seminary with an entire set of Talmud.\n                “Bribery blinds<lb/> even the wise”. <persName>Frankel</persName> mentions him among\n                the donors, but only as<lb/> “<persName>Herr Szola</persName>, preacher in\n                    <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, not “doctor” or “Rabbiner.” What does<lb/>\n                <persName>Rabbi Abraham Rice</persName> say about this ? “The four houses of\n                trampling” which</p>"
