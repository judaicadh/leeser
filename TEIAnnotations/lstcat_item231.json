The one is the highest<lb/> and holiest calling to which man can devote\n                the energies of his<lb/> mind, the other a mere physical duty, which any one may\n                per-<lb/>form; requiring neither mind nor morals, beyond that morality<lb/> which\n                impels my barber, or tailor to do his work faithfully.—<lb/> When therefore, a\n                candidate for the office of Hazan is a strang-<lb/>er to a congregation, it is\n                perhaps well to take him for a limited<lb/> period on trial, and afterwards he\n                should be elected, and have<lb/> nothing “<hi rend=\"italics\">said about the term of\n                    service.</hi>”</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">The Judge's tenure, <hi rend=\"italics\">dum bene se gesserint</hi>,\n                may, or may not<lb/> be proper—but again, there is no analogy between these\n                offices.<lb/> The life tenure of the Judge was created as a protection to the<lb/>\n                liberties of the people.

The\n                ground on which <persName>Mr. Carvalho's</persName> election was<lb/> placed. The\n                ground taken by <persName>Mr. Lazarus</persName> in <date>1824</date>, and the<lb/>\n                ground which I trust, will hereafter be taken by every Hazan<lb/> in\n                    <placeName>America</placeName>. The tenure of the office of Hazan should be\n                at<lb/> will. He should be bound to his congregation, and they to him,<lb/> by the\n                bonds of love, and not of money penalties; and he should<lb/> serve no longer than\n                was mutually agreeable, for no longer could<lb/> he be useful.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">Let us <hi rend=\"italics\">test this idea</hi> of making the Hazan a\n                bonded officer,<lb/> for limited periods, say five, or ten years, and to do this,\n                let us<lb/> examine the terms and character of the articles of agreement,<lb/> which\n                may be found at Page 10, of the pamphlet. The Hazan<lb/> agrees to serve and\n                officiate for ten years, during which time, he<lb/> is to perform the duties of the\n                station—these duties are subse-<lb/>quently defined, viz: on <date>Sabbaths</date>\n                and Holy days, to read the<lb/> prayers in devout manner in the original Hebrew. To\n                attend<lb/> funerals &amp;c: to support and abide by, and obey the Charter<lb/> and\n                Bye-Laws, and obey the legal orders of the Parnas. In<lb/> consideration of said\n                services, the congregation agrees to pay<lb/> $1200 per ann. during the ten years in\n                quarterly payments. And<lb/> for the due performance of the covenants, each party\n                (Hazan<lb/> and congregation) binds himself in the penal sum of one thou-<lb/>sand\n                dollars. Now as the covenant has <hi rend=\"italics\">expressed precisely</hi>,\n                what<lb/> each party is to do, no more could be claimed in law, or morals,<lb/> than\n                what is therein expressed. It is therefore manifest that a<lb/> Hazan under that\n                covenant would be entitled to recover his<lb/> salary, if he read the prayers in\n                Hebrew, on <date>Sabbaths</date> and Holy<lb/> days, attended funerals, &amp;c.\n                &amp;c., even though he lived in open vi-<lb/>olation of the moral law, and should\n                ascend the <hi rend=\"italics\">tebah</hi> dressed in<lb/> the most fantastic attire.\n                I do not press this point of my argu-<lb/>ment too far.

But even supposing<lb/> the probability of this contingency, or that\n                the Hazan may be<lb/> thrown penniless on the world, still it is far better for both\n                par-<lb/>ties to have the congregation thus arranged, than to have Hazan<lb/> and\n                congregation tied to each other, even after love, respect, and<lb/> power of\n                usefulness were all departed. And again, this tenure<lb/> at will is a guarantee,\n                worth all the bonds in the world, for mu-<lb/>tual forbearance, respect, and\n                devotion to their respective duties.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">One word in conclusion, and that in relation to the pamphlet\n                it-<lb/>self. To the <hi rend=\"italics\">casual</hi> and careless observers (and\n                these form a<lb/> large majority of readers), it would seem that this was an\n                official<lb/> expose, a manifesto from the Adjunta. This impression is fairly<lb/>\n                <sic>inferrible</sic> from the three first paragraphs of the pamphlet, and the<lb/>\n                internal evidence that the books, papers, and minutes of the Ad-<lb/>junta must have\n                been under the free control of the writer. And<lb/> yet I for <sic>oneam</sic> sure\n                that it is not an <hi rend=\"italics\">official production</hi>, firstly,\n                be-<lb/>cause it is not declared to be so; and secondly, because it is\n                anon-<lb/>ymous, and even the very office from which it is issued is\n                con-<lb/>cealed. The writer of the pamphlet is evidently a man of talent<lb/> and of\n                education, and his sense of justice should have induced<lb/> him to have declared\n                    <hi rend=\"italics\">in express terms</hi>, that he wrote on his own<lb/>\n                individual responsibility, and not to have left so important a fact<lb/> in doubt.\n                But there are other objections to the pamphlet, of a<lb/> more serious character. It\n                charges a man, who for the fifth part<lb/> of a century has been the Hazan of one of\n                the most respectable<lb/> congregations in <placeName>America</placeName>, with\n                false representations, hypocrisy,<lb/> violation of duty, and a childish vanity that\n                induced him to sacri-<lb/>fice his holy official duties to “one engrossing fancy.”\n                And does<lb/> the “light of truth” thus daguerreotype the character of\n                    <persName>Isaac<lb/> Leeser</persName>? No, no, no, and such would be the echo\n                and response<lb/> of ninety-nine hundredths of the Jews of\n                    <placeName>England</placeName> and <placeName>America</placeName>.<lb/>\n                <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> is “neither more nor less than a man,” he has\n                the<lb/> faults and the frailties of humanity. His quick sensibility, his<lb/>\n                ardent temperament, may, and perhaps do, rob him of that suavi-<lb/>ty of manner,\n                which, like the tinsel glitter of false ornaments, too</p>"
