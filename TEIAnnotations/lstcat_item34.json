To get rid of this demand of the Synagogue, he\n                applied to be admitted a<lb/> member of the Lutheran church; the<del>y</del>\n                authorities consented to take his money, taxed him<lb/> $32 <add>?</add> allotted\n                him a seat in church &amp;c, but the Govermt. told him he must<lb/> pay his\n                    finta<add>?</add> to the Synagogue also, unless he became a Christian.
