I was the more sad about this because I must have seemed\n                un-<lb/>grateful, since you might have supposed that my silence was due to the\n                fact<lb/> that I had already forgotten everything that I received from you and\n                my<lb/> other friends. But, believe me, that after having been here four days,\n                I<lb/> began to write, and wrote fourteen<lb/>\n                <del>a a a</del> on the 10th day, and dispatched<lb/> them at once. How it happened\n                that you did not receive them, I cannot<lb/> understand, for I wrote, and waited\n                from <date>Rosh Hodesh Ellul</date> for a letter<lb/> daily. Until finally I was\n                fortunate enough to receive four letters<lb/> from <persName>Dulmen</persName>\n                <sic>Two</sic> hours after we left the synagogue on <date>Sh'mini\n                Atzereth</date>.<lb/> It is now about 2 weeks since I sent a bundle of letters\n                addressed <del>?</del><lb/> in care of <persName>Mr. A. Leffman</persName>, by way\n                of <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, but I cannot tell when<lb/> these letters will\n                arrive in <placeName>Germany</placeName>. Since now an opportunity presents<lb/>\n                itself by way of <placeName>Rotterdam</placeName>, since the <persName>brig Somers,\n                    E. P. Lord</persName>, company, is<lb/> about to leave for that point, I decided\n                to send as many letters as pos-<lb/>sible to such people to whom I have not yet\n                written.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">I had to overcome several dangers before arriving in\n                    <placeName>America</placeName>.<lb/> Sometimes it seemed as if \"The cords of\n                death encompassed me and the<lb/> straits of the grave had come upon me\"*. The\n                storms which we had during our long journey sometimes threatened destruction, a\n                precipitate death,<lb/> a cold, sad, terrible end, but, \"I found trouble and sorrow\n                and called upon<lb/> the name of the lord\"**. Frequently, dear Rabbi, your blessing,\n                your wishes<lb/> at my departure, gave me new strength, new courage. For, was not\n                this<lb/> your blessing, \"If you go in water, I am with you, and streams will\n                not<lb/> overwhelm you\"*** Although I was unprepared to die, nevertheless I\n                gave<lb/> myself silently over to the will of the Almighty. and since I had no<lb/>\n                prayer book in which there was a prayer for travelers on the sea, I made</p>\n            <p>*Psalm 116:3 **Psalm 116:3 ***Isaiah 43:2 (somewhat misprinted[?])</p>"
