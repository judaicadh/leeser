Since then I have been kept pretty<lb/> much\n                engaged in various ways; first, old <persName>Mrs. Levy</persName> died,\n                    (<persName>Aaron's</persName> wife)<lb/> and had to attend prayers morning and\n                evening at more than<lb/> a mile distance from my place; and next we had lately a\n                meeting<lb/> to propose a plan for a general union of all the Jews in\n                    <placeName>America</placeName><lb/> under one general church government at the\n                head of which are<lb/> to be placed three learned men. I was put upon the\n                committee<lb/> to mature<add>?</add> the plan, and <del>accordingly</del> was\n                delegated by them<lb/> afterward to draw up rules &amp; regulations. I had to go to\n                work<lb/> accordingly and did what had been asked of me; and the committee had<lb/>\n                thereupon several meetings to debate after and amend my rough<lb/> draft. In the\n                main it was adopted, and it was updated last<lb/>\n                <date>Sunday</date> to a general meeting, and adopted and ordained to be\n                printed<lb/> for general circulation, and as soon as it is ready I will send<lb/> it\n                on, and I hope that you will at least approve of the outline<lb/> if even all the\n                details do not meet your views. At the first<lb/> meeting (the <date>Sunday</date>\n                after I left you) I made an extemporaneous address<lb/> of near an hour long to\n                introduce the measure to public notice;<lb/> altho' not prepared with even a single\n                note, people were pleased to<lb/> say that it was the best address they had heard\n                from me; but this is so<lb/> often said about my works that I do not give much for\n                such a compliment<lb/> any farther than that it proves that the people are not tired\n                of hearing me</p>"
