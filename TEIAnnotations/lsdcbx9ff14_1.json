You <hi rend=\"underline\">are</hi> correct in<lb/> your estimate of the\n                organ innovation, and the motives which<lb/> inspired the invocation of the muses;\n                but I think you are wrong<lb/> in the sentiment that “the gentiles must be anxious\n                for us to yield<lb/> as idle our expectation of a messiah &amp;c„. If the doctrine\n                were to be promul<lb/>gated that the Jewish prophecies did not justify the\n                    <sic>beleif</sic> in the advent<lb/> of a Personage would it not be a direct\n                attack upon their fundamental<lb/>\n                <sic>beleif</sic>? For they take the prophecies &amp; find them fulfilled in the\n                persons<lb/> of their Messiah notwithstanding the palpable contradictions that\n                instead<lb/> of the “Prince of peace„ He has been the demon of strife war &amp;\n                bloodshed<lb/> with all their train of sorrows and crime.=If this idea\n                prevailed<lb/> I think it would be a direct blow at the very foundation of<lb/>\n                their Religion. Do you concern with me now? The <hi rend=\"underline\">new</hi> creed\n                I herewith<lb/> transcribe for your edification, it was concocted by <persName>Mr\n                    Poznanski</persName> &amp; <persName>Mr<lb/> Joshua Lazarus</persName> before\n                the dedication of the synagogue &amp; placed upon<lb/> a Tablet in gilt letter on\n                the right of the <hi rend=\"underline\">achol</hi> on the left is placed<lb/> the 10\n                Commandments. Before this excitement I presume no one read them<lb/> at least very\n                few. I myself never did read them while then feeling<lb/> confident that\n                    <persName>Mr P.</persName> had given us the Creed handed down to us by<lb/>\n                <persName>Maimonides</persName>. Inform me <hi rend=\"underline\">if you can</hi>,\n                where he got his authority for<lb/> this version, &amp; if it would be recognized by\n                Jews? Here it is—</p>\n            <p>I We believe in the existence of a Supreme Being who created governs &amp; sustains\n                the Universe.</p>\n            <p>II We believe that this Being is the only true &amp; living God, the only Divine\n                Being, only<lb/> one in Unity, and without plurality in any sense whatever.</p>\n            <p>III We believe that God is incorporeal &amp; incomprehensible that he has never put\n                on the figure<lb/> or body of any thing in Creation &amp; that there is nothing like\n                him in the Universe.—</p>\n            <p>IV We believe that God is without beginning &amp; without end &amp; that He is the\n                only Eternal Being</p>\n            <p>V We believe that God reigns alone over the Universe; that there exists no mediator\n                between<lb/> man &amp; his maker &amp; that it is proper to pray to Him only, &amp;\n                not through the merits of any<lb/> other being</p>\n            <p>VI We believe that the Prophets were the only persons inspired by God, &amp; that all\n                their words are true</p>\n            <p>VII We believe that <del>the</del>\n                <persName>Moses</persName> was the greatest of the Prophets &amp; that none has\n                appeared like unto him</p>\n            <p>VIII We believe that the divine Law in our <sic>posession</sic> is that which was\n                delivered to our<lb/> Fathers by <persName>Moses</persName>, &amp; that all divine\n                communication ceased with <persName>Malachi</persName> the last of<lb/> the\n                Prophets</p>\n            <p>IX We believe that the divine Law delivered by <persName>Moses</persName>, will never\n                be changed, nor altered</p>\n            <p>X We believe that God knows all our thoughts and actions.—</p>\n            <p>XI We believe that God rewards all who observes his commands &amp; punishes those who\n                transgress them</p>\n            <p>XII We believe that the Messiah announced by the Prophets is <hi rend=\"underline\"\n                    >not</hi> come—<lb/> the Prophecies in relation to his coming <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">not being fulfilled</hi></p>\n            <p>XIII We believe that the soul is <hi rend=\"underline\">Immortal</hi>, and that we\n                shall be<lb/> accountable for our actions in the life to come.—</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">This creed was also printed some time since &amp; used in the school\n                for the instruction<lb/> of Jewish youth &amp; strange to say it passed the critical\n                ordeal of all of us. There<lb/> is much subtle wording in it &amp; several passages\n                are blows dealt at the gentiles<lb/> and have no existence in the Text. Let me have\n                your views upon it. How can<lb/> you advise the continuance of <persName>Mr\n                    Poznanski</persName> as Hazan when he laughs at the idea<lb/> of observing the\n                second day of our Holidays. We know his sentiments and can we<lb/>\n                <sic>beleive</sic> in the <sic>effiacy</sic> or truth of prayer from the lips of him\n                who does not<lb/>\n                <sic>beleive</sic> in the occasion which calls us together to offer up that prayer.\n                You<lb/> might with the same propriety assert that there would be efficacy in\n                the<lb/> prayers of an atheist. You cannot have read our reply carefully; read\n                over<lb/> his second letter to the Trustees &amp; you will there find that he will\n                preach<lb/> errors &amp; abuses until the people tell him through the Board of\n                Trustees<lb/> to preach truths. You must know that in addition to these\n                circumstances <persName>Mr<lb/> Poznanski</persName> in conversation with several\n                Christian Ministers of our<lb/> city asserted, “That the Messiah had not come,\n                nor</p>"

He told me moreover<lb/> that\n                when the case came on for trial he would prove things countenanced<lb/> and enjoined\n                upon us by the Rabbins which would tend to injure us in<lb/> the eyes of the\n                christian community. Not being versed in Talmudical lore<lb/> I am at a loss to know\n                what grave charges he can bring before a<lb/> christian Tribunal to injure us. The\n                cause he espouses must be very<lb/> bad if it requires such disclosures to uphold\n                it, &amp; like <persName>Samson</persName> he<lb/> will have to be commingled in the\n                ruin he would hurl upon us.<lb/> He said he would also prove that the keeping of the\n                second days of<lb/> the Holidays was not even <hi rend=\"underline\">enjoined</hi> by\n                the Rabbins and therefore an<lb/> abuse, that we had now obtained the precise time\n                &amp; it was folly to<lb/> keep more than one day. Have the Rabbins advocated\n                doctrines<lb/> subsequent to our ideas of charity &amp; good will? Rumor says\n                that<lb/> he intends to prove that if a Gentile falls into the water &amp; a jew\n                could<lb/> save him the Rabbis say let him drown„—&amp; may such barbarous<lb/>\n                doctrines at which humanity shudders</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">I think it becomes your impervious duty to notice in<lb/> the\n                Occident as early as possible the Rationale, bearing and tenor of the<lb/> Pamphlet\n                sent to you, in a <hi rend=\"underline\">direct manner</hi>, come out boldly\n                &amp;<lb/> manfully, give us <hi rend=\"underline\">orthodox views</hi> instead of the\n                    <hi rend=\"underline\">neologistic</hi> reasoning<lb/> of <persName>Mr\n                    Poznanski</persName> &amp; his party, but let them be tempered with charity<lb/>\n                and brotherly love.
