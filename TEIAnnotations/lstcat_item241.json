Were it that they only<lb/> suffered unjustly, even if the charge\n                did not touch our ancient system<lb/> of faith, still, as sons of\n                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>, we ourselves would <hi rend=\"italics\">feel</hi>\n                the wrong that<lb/> they have unjustly to bear. But now we have an additional\n                incentive<lb/> to rouse our every feeling of commiseration and regret, since\n                the<lb/> religion, which we profess in common with them, has been stigmatized<lb/>\n                as authorizing the shedding of human blood at the recurrence of the<lb/> annual\n                    <date>Passover</date>. You may perhaps smile that such an absurd\n                accu-<lb/>sation should at all be made! you may feel contempt at the ignorance<lb/>\n                which could give credence to such superannuated folly! but our smile<lb/> of\n                derision, our hearty contempt, do not affect the mass who regard not<lb/> with\n                kindness the remnant of <placeName>Israel</placeName>, and will not disarm the\n                malice of<lb/> those who are only glad of every opportunity to send new sorrows\n                to<lb/> our bosoms.—It is not the first time that it has been said and believed<lb/>\n                that the Jews are commanded to slay their Christian neighbours; and<lb/> at a time\n                when the pestilence raged over almost the whole known<lb/> world, our people were\n                accused of causing the great destruction of<lb/> human life by poisoning the wells,\n                simply because in proportion to<lb/> numbers less Jews died than Christians. The\n                consequence was that<lb/> multitudes of the accused were butchered without pity, and\n                those whom<lb/> the <hi rend=\"italics\">black death</hi> had spared fell a prey to\n                the fury of an excited popu-<lb/>lace, rendered lawless by the prevalence of a fatal\n                disorder, which daily<lb/> hurried thousands to the tomb. And whenever superstition\n                and rapa-<lb/>city wished to glut themselves in the destruction of our\n                    <sic>defenceless</sic><lb/> race, the charge of murder for our religious rites\n                was raised, and, as<lb/> was the case lately, it was made the pretext for\n                unsheathing the sword<lb/> and dooming countless numbers of innocent victims to\n                merciless<lb/> slaughter. O! then were times of sorrow and affliction; we wept,\n                but<lb/> no one pitied, our gore rendered turbid the streams, but all passed<lb/>\n                carelessly by; they heeded not our cries, they regarded us aliens to<lb/> the rights\n                of man, outcasts from Divine favour. Those were indeed<lb/> times when our harps\n                were hung upon the willows; when the voice of<lb/> wailing was heard in every home;\n                when the houses of prayer were<lb/> filled, not with living <sic>worshippers</sic>,\n                but with the bodies of those slain<lb/> by the unpitying persecutor. Whither then\n                could we fly?

But so<lb/> it is, the mass is ever ready to put faith in the\n                    <sic>marvellous</sic> and the ex-<lb/>traordinary, no matter if their absurdity\n                should be apparent on the very<lb/> surface; and all we can say is, that with the\n                progress of civilization<lb/> many have fallen behind the march of intellect in\n                others, and that hu-<lb/>man nature is prone to err, and this is an aggravated\n                degree, at all<lb/> ages of the world. Were any proof of this wanting, the recent\n                tragic<lb/> scenes in <placeName>Damascus</placeName> and\n                    <placeName>Rhodes</placeName> would give ample confirmation.

Yet, in many lands we are tolerated merely,<lb/> and constitute not a\n                part of the state, as we do here and in a few other<lb/> enlightened countries. So,\n                too, in the dominions of the <persName>Pacha</persName> of\n                    <placeName>Egypt</placeName>,<lb/> the renowned <persName>Mehemet\n                Ali</persName>, are we left unprotected by any law, save<lb/> the will of the ruling\n                chief, or those who administer the government in<lb/> his name; add to which that in\n                the lands of the <placeName>East</placeName>, human life is not<lb/> held sacred,\n                but is ever at the mercy of the despot, and the possession<lb/> of wealth is often\n                the passport to destruction.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">Now it so happened, as you already know, that an old man\n                disap-<lb/>peared; whether murdered or not no one has clearly shown; and if<lb/>\n                murdered, it has not yet been proved, as far as our knowledge extends,<lb/> who his\n                murderers are. But our brothers in <placeName>Damascus</placeName> are wealthy,<lb/>\n                they are subject, at the best of times, to great cruelties and grinding<lb/>\n                exactions; and do you think that so favourable an opportunity for<lb/> pillage would\n                be suffered to pass? Little would you know the spirit of<lb/> despotism, if you were\n                to think so; for though ever ready to oppress, it<lb/> greedily seizes every\n                opportunity to give some colouring of justice to<lb/> its exactions. The result has\n                been what might naturally have been<lb/> expected. One humble individual at first\n                arrested upon the vaguest<lb/> suspicion, was beaten till his tormentors could not\n                do otherwise than<lb/> cease in the infliction; he was taken back to prison, and\n                there tampered<lb/> with to induce him to accuse, not those of a low degree like\n                himself,<lb/> but the first in wealth and learning which the city could\n                furnish.<lb/> They were seized and tortured; some died under the excruciating\n                pain<lb/> they had to endure; others accused themselves guilty of the crime of<lb/>\n                murdering the missing individual; one adopted the Mussulman religion;<lb/> whilst\n                others, patiently enduring the most intense suffering, still clung<lb/> to the\n                truth, and refused making any confession of guilt in themselves<lb/> or others, of\n                which they were guiltless. The name of one of these<lb/> noble martyrs has reached\n                me, it is <hi rend=\"italics\"><persName>Mussa Salonikli</persName></hi>, who adhered\n                to<lb/> the protestation of his innocence, when the endurance of others was<lb/>\n                broken down. Such a man deserves to be held in honourable remem-<lb/>brance for\n                future ages, as an example of a true Israelite, who exhibited<lb/> a filial\n                confidence in his God under the greatest trials to which poor<lb/> mortality can be\n                subjected.—But with the seizure of the first accused<lb/> the persecution did not\n                stop; others of the best and noblest were bar-<lb/>barously maltreated, and many\n                children were thrown into prison, and<lb/> kept upon miserable food, to induce their\n                parents to come forward and<lb/> accuse persons acceptable to the monster\n                    <persName>Sheriff Pacha</persName>, who, if report<lb/> speaks true, must have\n                known, from the recantation of one who had</p>"

I\n                hardly<lb/> think so. Already the transaction which we deplore has raised up<lb/>\n                advocates for us among our Christian friends; and if the name of\n                    <persName>Rat-<lb/>ti-Menton</persName> will live in the disgrace which he so\n                well merits, the generous<lb/>\n                <persName>Mr. Merlato</persName> at <placeName>Damascus</placeName>, and\n                    <persName>Mr. Laurin</persName> at <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, who\n                there<lb/> represent the <persName>Emperor</persName> of\n                    <placeName>Austria</placeName>, will be remembered with gratitude<lb/> for their\n                unsolicited exertions in our behalf.—In <placeName>England</placeName>, too, the\n                sub-<lb/>ject has awakened attention, and one of its great minds, who formerly<lb/>\n                opposed our admission to equal rights, the renowned <persName>Sir Robert\n                    Peel</persName>,<lb/> has already thought proper to mention the case of the\n                sufferers in par-<lb/>liament, with every demonstration that he too feels that a\n                great wrong<lb/> has been done to an innocent people. There too has been an\n                    <persName>O'Connell</persName>,<lb/> a <persName>Noel</persName>, a\n                    <persName>Thompson</persName>, and many others, to speak in our behalf; and<lb/>\n                doubtlessly in this land too, perhaps in this city, men will step forward<lb/> to\n                vindicate the rights of man outraged in the persons of the Jews at<lb/>\n                <placeName>Damascus</placeName>. Perhaps a voice too loud to remain unheeded may be\n                raised<lb/> against the use of torture in trials, and that the\n                    <persName>Pacha</persName> of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, in<lb/> whose\n                dominions are <placeName>Damascus</placeName> and <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>,\n                may be induced to<lb/> abolish it altogether; and so not we alone, but all the\n                inhabitants of<lb/> the earth, may have cause to rejoice at the present movement in\n                which<lb/> we are engaged, though sorrow was its first promoter. And why<lb/> should\n                the case of the Jews be less attended to than that of the Greeks?<lb/> When the sons\n                of ancient <placeName>Hellas</placeName> broke the chains of the Ottoman<lb/> power,\n                all <placeName>Europe</placeName> and <placeName>America</placeName> were awakened\n                in their behalf; but<lb/> have they any greater claim upon the sympathy of the world\n                than we<lb/> have? We admit that the Greeks may have been the fathers of\n                archi-<lb/>tecture, of painting, of sculpture, and of tragic poetry; but the world\n                is<lb/> indebted to us far more, for a gift far nobler, for the possession of\n                the<lb/> Decalogue, for the word of God, the holy and precious Bible, the book<lb/>\n                more venerable than all books, the parent of a pure belief, the founda-<lb/>tion of\n                true human happiness, of religion without bigotry, of liberty<lb/> without\n                licentiousness.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">Another happy effect has already resulted from the same cause;\n                it<lb/> has awakened anew the spirit of brotherly love among us, and we have<lb/>\n                had an opportunity of experiencing that oceans may intervene between<lb/> our\n                dispersed remnants, that mountains may divide us, but that yet the<lb/> Israelite is\n                ever alive to the welfare of his distant brother, and sorrows<lb/> with his sorrow,\n                and rejoices in his joy.

As\n                the<lb/> call is intended for none but Israelites, there will of course be no<lb/>\n                Christians there. Had it been general, I have no doubt their attend-<lb/>ance would\n                have been very large. However, perhaps it is best that<lb/> the first movement in\n                the matter should be made among yourselves.<lb/> As I shall not be present when you\n                meet, I write this to assure you of<lb/> my deep sympathy in the sufferings of your\n                persecuted brethren, and<lb/> of my hearty wishes for the speedy termination of\n                their calamities.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">I can speak for myself only with certainty; but I feel persuaded\n                that<lb/> the Christian community generally, and the Christian clergy\n                especially,<lb/> will gladly and generously co-operate with you in any plan you\n                may<lb/> adopt for their relief. As it regards myself, allow me to say, that if\n                it<lb/> should be thought by you necessary to resort to any aid beyond what<lb/> you\n                yourselves can give, I will most cheerfully bring the case before<lb/> my\n                congregation, plead their cause before that kind-hearted and gene-<lb/>rous people,\n                and obtain from them all the assistance which they can<lb/> give. I would not have\n                obtruded this communication upon you, but<lb/> that I thought it possible you might\n                have some delicacy about applying<lb/> to your Christian friends for their\n                co-operation, unless some intimation<lb/> were given that your appeal would be\n                gladly and promptly responded<lb/> to by some at least. It is not, sir, the cause of\n                the <hi rend=\"italics\">Jews</hi> only you are<lb/> about to espouse: it is the cause\n                of humanity. And, in reference as<lb/> well to their deliverance from almost unheard\n                of sufferings, as to their<lb/> spiritual condition, I, as a Christian, can truly\n                adopt the language of<lb/> one of the noblest of the apostles of your faith, and\n                say, “My heart's<lb/> desire and prayers to God for <placeName>Israel</placeName>,\n                is, that they might be saved.”</p>"

The Rev.<lb/> gentleman commenced by stating that he stood in\n                a situation for which<lb/> modern times offered no parallel; in ancient times, the\n                Jewish syna-<lb/>gogues were, as he thought, used for religious disputations, but\n                now, for<lb/> the first time for centuries, was a Christian minister addressing a\n                reli-<lb/>gious assemblage in a Jewish Synagogue, a spectacle at once sublime<lb/>\n                and pleasing to humanity. <persName>Dr. D.</persName> then noticed the barbarities\n                    <sic>prac-<lb/>tised</sic> in the <placeName>East</placeName>, and said, in the\n                spirit of prophecy, that relief would<lb/> come, “the oppressors arm would be broken\n                and the oppressed go<lb/> free.” He cited instances of Divine vengeance against\n                those who had<lb/> pursued a similar course of conduct, and concluded by proferring\n                the<lb/> kind sympathies, the pecuniary assistance, and moral influence of the<lb/>\n                Christian community, to aid in the worthy cause for which the Israelites<lb/> had\n                called this meeting.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">His remarks were wholly extempore, and the foregoing sketch\n                does<lb/> him but little justice.</p>"

I fully concur with the <persName>Rev. Dr. Ducachet</persName>, who\n                has<lb/> preceded me, in the remarks he has made, and in the feelings he has<lb/>\n                expressed. My object in rising is not to detain you by any protracted<lb/> remarks\n                that I have to make, but merely to express for myself, how<lb/> sincerely I\n                sympathize with you in your affliction. I feel persuaded,<lb/> however, that the\n                same feeling pervades the breasts of all of my Chris-<lb/>tian brethren in this\n                city.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">Sir, I feel for the Jewish people. I love them, and have strong\n                rea-<lb/>sons for so doing. In the providence of God I have been permitted to<lb/>\n                mingle among them in the <placeName>East</placeName>, and have always found them\n                kind and<lb/> obliging. When frowned upon by the haughty Mohammedan, and<lb/>\n                treated with scorn by the heathen, I have always found the door of the<lb/> Jews\n                open for my reception, and have found a shelter under his hospita-<lb/>ble roof. I\n                love them also for their Father's sake, for they are the<lb/> children of the\n                faithful <persName>Abraham</persName>; yea, I love them, for they are my<lb/>\n                brethren.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">As to the calumnies alleged against those in\n                    <placeName>Damascus</placeName>, no candid<lb/> mind, I think, could for a\n                moment entertain the idea that they are true.<lb/> They cannot be. I have, however,\n                seen enough of Mohammedan inso-<lb/>lence and oppression, to know that the mere\n                expression of our sympa-<lb/>thies, or that any interference on our part, cannot\n                reach the case of the<lb/> oppressed, or awe their oppressors. Something more\n                powerful is<lb/> needed. My only hope is in the Lord God of\n                    <persName>Abraham</persName>.

Let us unite in prayer, that God would break the oppressor's<lb/> arm\n                so that the oppressed may go free. Yea, that He would banish<lb/> tyranny and\n                oppression from the earth, and that the whole family of<lb/> man may become, as they\n                ought to be, one brotherhood.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">You have, Sir, I repeat it, my sincere sympathy in this matter,\n                and<lb/> aid so far as I can yield it.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">After the <persName>Rev.

And most peculiarly does<lb/>\n                this seem to be a duty, being, as we are, in a country where the enjoy-<lb/>ment of\n                full liberty is real and not theoretical.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">It is not my intention, (said <persName>Mr. P.</persName>) to go\n                over the ground which<lb/> has been so well covered already, I merely wish to remind\n                those whom<lb/> I see assembled around me, of the occasion which calls us here,\n                and<lb/> the results which ought to, and will follow our assemblage.
