At the close of each yearly term there shall be held an<lb/> examination of all\n\t\t\t\tthe classes in the presence of a Committee<lb/> of the Board, and of such other\n\t\t\t\tTrustees as shall attend; after<lb/> every examination the students who are\n\t\t\t\tdistinguished in each<lb/> class shall be arranged in the order of merit.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>3. No student shall be suffered to proceed to a higher class<lb/> who shall not, on\n\t\t\t\texamination show himself to be master of<lb/> the studies of the\n\t\t\t\t\t<sic>preceeding</sic> year, but he may be allowed<lb/> the privilege, (if the\n\t\t\t\tfaculty shall judge it expedient to grant<lb/> it,) of a second examination for\n\t\t\t\tadmission thereto, at the<lb/> opening of the next succeeding year.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>4. Punishment shall be exclusively directed to a sense of<lb/> duty, and the\n\t\t\t\tprinciples of honor and shame, and shall consist<lb/> of private admonition by a\n\t\t\t\tProfessor—admonition in the pre-<lb/>sence of the Faculty—admonition in the presence\n\t\t\t\tof the Fac-<lb/>ulty and of the class of the offender—removal to a lower<lb/>\n\t\t\t\tclass—suspension for a limited time from college—dismissal—<lb/>expulsion.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>5.

In case of dismissal, the offender may be re-admit-<lb/>ted, but\n\t\t\t\tthe effect of the expulsion shall be an utter disqualifica-<lb/>tion of the\n\t\t\t\tindividual for re-admission into this institution,<lb/> or of receiving any of its\n\t\t\t\thonors.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>6.

Notice that the\n\t\t\t\ttui-<lb/>tion money is due, and that the Treasurer will at times attend<lb/> (the\n\t\t\t\ttime then to be stated) shall be given by the Secretary.</p>"
