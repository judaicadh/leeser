I am well aware that ladies like to hear\n                such<lb/> matters; but I am but little acquainted with them to give full<lb/>\n                particulars. The wedding however was a tolerably merry one,<lb/> and plenty to eat\n                and to drink was set before all the com-<lb/>pany. As usual some affronts were\n                given; since some persons<lb/> thought themselves entitled to an invitation which\n                was not extended<lb/> to them. Among the rest a cousin of the bride, who expected to\n                be <hi rend=\"underline\">unter</hi>-<lb/><hi rend=\"underline\">ferer</hi>, and not\n                being asked she and <sic>and</sic> husband did not come<lb/> at all. However this\n                you know is not uncommon; I myself staid till<lb/> near one o'clock; as they did not\n                sit down to supper till a quarter before<lb/> twelve, and I was expected to stay to\n                say prayers. It was rather<lb/> a later hour for me than I liked to remain out of\n                bed; but as there was<lb/> no help for it I had to submit.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">Old <persName>Mr Wolff</persName> has been at our house for some\n                weeks.<lb/> He had a cataract on one eye, and could not see well out of<lb/> the\n                other. He had accordingly an operation before<add>?</add> to remove<lb/> the\n                cataract from the one eye, already <date>Sunday</date> two weeks ago;<lb/> and as\n                yet he has not been down stairs. As my room is I think<lb/> the most convenient in\n                the house I gave it up to him; though I<lb/> do not hold him in very high\n                estimation, since he is for a European<lb/> as little of a Jew as ever I saw in my\n                life. However he too has<lb/> not escaped without his share of trouble. I hope that\n                in a week or two<lb/> he may be able to travel southwards as he lives in\n                    <placeName>Mobile, Alabama</placeName>; a person sick in a house makes a great\n                difference in all arrange<lb/>ments.</p>"

I do not admire that couple<lb/> much. I have recommended him to several\n                persons to give him goods<lb/> on commission; but he invariably has failed of paying\n                over what he<lb/> sold, and so he will get but little more from Jews. He has cost\n                me<lb/> besides somewhat like twenty Dollars in money, and more indirectly,<lb/> and\n                from me therefore he has nothing to expect. Upon the whole there<lb/> is little\n                satisfaction in doing anything for the poor of this community. They<lb/> generally\n                eat up what they get; and but small thanks do even fall to<lb/> my share at least; I\n                know not how it may be with other people. It<lb/> would not matter much if I were\n                rich; but having to work for every cent<lb/> I get, it is rather hard that so many\n                make constant claim to the<lb/> little I have, and do it in such a manner that a\n                refusal is out of my<lb/> power. I have determined at times not to be liberal; but I\n                see no way<lb/> whatever to avoid giving more than I should do for my means.\n                Still<lb/> as I am a single man and having no one whom I need work for, it\n                makes<lb/> but small odds at last, as I hope with God's Helping to be always able to\n                earn<lb/> my living; and if I have this respectably I have no right to ask for\n                more.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">My intention was to go to <placeName>New York</placeName> last\n                    <date>Sunday</date>.

But last evening I\n                went<lb/> to see him, and he appeared to me not to be quite so sick as that he<lb/>\n                might not recover. <persName>Doctor Jackson</persName> happened to come in as I\n                was<lb/> going away, and I waited till he was going again, when he asked<lb/> to\n                ride down in his carriage, and took me to <placeName>8<hi rend=\"sup\">th</hi> &amp;\n                    Chestnut Streets</placeName><lb/> (believe in <placeName>8<hi rend=\"sup\">th</hi>\n                    below Walnut</placeName>); he then told me that there is but small<lb/>\n                probability of his recovery, yet there is no symptom which would make<lb/> his\n                disease necessarily fatal.
