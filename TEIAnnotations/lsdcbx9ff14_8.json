The\n                inquiry now is What is the round of merit or of<lb/> satisfaction, on which\n                according to the Sacred Scriptures God pardons<lb/> sin? If the threatened penalty\n                cannot be dispensed with, either we<lb/> must suffer it ourselves or some other must\n                suffer in our<lb/> place. If the first threatening that in the day of the eating of\n                the<lb/> forbidden fruit <persName>Adam</persName> should die, exhibits the standard\n                measure of<lb/> all the penalties of disobedience, or if we may discover the\n                common<lb/> measure in the appointment that the man who should eat the\n                for=<lb/>bidden bread during the <date>Passover</date> should be cut off from the\n                con=<lb/>gregation of <placeName>Israel</placeName>, or if the penalty of each of\n                the ten command=<lb/>ments is death, we cannot suffer for ourselves the penalty,\n                except in<lb/> our hopeless death or moral ruin. The cup of the wrath of God is<lb/>\n                not to be exhausted by our sinful lips. It is the challenge of God to<lb/> every\n                impenitent sinner: “Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands<lb/> be strong, in\n                the days that I will deal with thee?” <persName>Ezek.</persName> 22:14.<lb/> The\n                higher our views of the justice holiness and truth of God, the<lb/> deeper and\n                despair in view of our own sin. Can any one then take<lb/> our place and die for us?\n                The substitute must himself be without<lb/> sin, and under no obligation to suffer\n                for himself. Further, God<lb/> would not accept a substitute who is unable for our\n                place, who, in<lb/> suffering for us, would himself be ruined. A suitable\n                substitute<lb/> must have power to lay down his life and to take it again.<lb/> This\n                power, <persName>Jesus</persName> claimed.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">The Hebrew Scriptures give us many solemn lessons on<lb/> atonement\n                by death. The blood was sacredly set apart and forbid=<lb/>den in common use, it\n                being that part of the living system through<lb/> which an atonement for the soul\n                was made upon the altar. Hence<lb/> it is a saying of the <sic>Rabbies</sic>,\n                    <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> the essential matter of atonement is in the blood. This\n                doctrine<lb/> never became obsolete among the prophets; on the contrary, it\n                grew<lb/> and ripened. It is in the last prophecies “Seventy weeks are\n                deter=<lb/>mined„ upon thy people, and upon thy holy city”—so we read in\n                    <persName>Dan=<lb/>iel</persName>,— “to finish the transgression, and to make an\n                end of sins,<lb/> and to make atonement for iniquity, and to bring in\n                everlas=<lb/>ting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy,<lb/> and to\n                anoint a holy of holies.” Hebrew and Christian<lb/> commentators agree that here a\n                period of years is designated<lb/> which must have come to an end in the first\n                century of the<lb/> Christian Era. But, notwithstanding this agreement, there\n                is<lb/> a wide difference in the interpretations. The Christian beholds<lb/> in\n                these events predicted by <persName>Daniel</persName>, the expiatory and\n                all-sufficient<lb/> sufferings of his Messiah, the everlasting righteousness in\n                which<lb/> the sinner may be accepted, the restraint laid on the condemning<lb/>\n                power of sin, the grand <sic>fulfilment</sic> of visions and prophecies,<lb/> and\n                the spiritual consecration of a new sanctuary and commu=<lb/>nity of worshipers. The\n                Christian finds this prophecy full of<lb/> consolation: on the contrary, in the\n                Jewish interpretation,</p>"
