Yet, “A Jew”<lb/>\n                again came forth, defending the treaty, repeating the charge of my ignorance,<lb/>\n                and calling all that had as yet been written on the subject by<lb/> Editors “flimsy\n                remarks.” In reply to him, <persName>Mr. J.

Cardoza</persName><lb/> entered the\n                arena in a most gentlemanly and quiet Article.<lb/> To this “A Jew” replied in a\n                most scurrilous and insulting<lb/> Article, without even once coming to the point at\n                issue, nay! he was<lb/> even so ungenerous &amp; uncharitable, not to say\n                ungentlemanly, to cast<lb/> some open flings at me, although I had withdrawn from\n                the controversy<lb/> and thus placed myself beyond the possibility of\n                    <sic>defence</sic>.</p>\n            <p>Now <persName>Mr. N.</persName> published an Article, containing a most\n                withering<lb/> lesson for the unavoidable position which “A Jew” had taken in this\n                affair.<lb/> The latter took <sic>offence</sic> at this and published a card,\n                demanding<lb/> an explanation from <persName>Mr. C.</persName> This was not given,\n                and so there<lb/> was for the last 3 days a fine prospect of a duel. Things,<lb/>\n                however, I think, are now settled. You yourself were drawn<lb/> into this\n                controversy. In his first Article, <persName>Mr. C.</persName> quoted from<lb/> the\n                Occident, Vol. XII, p. 95-100, to prove that you had then already<lb/> written\n                against the Treaty <hi rend=\"underline\">as it now stands</hi>; “A Jew” denied<lb/>\n                this fact, in his reply, maintaining that you meant the original draft<lb/>\n                containing the word “<hi rend=\"underline\">Christian</hi>,” and to prove this, he quoted<lb/>\n                <hi rend=\"underline\">from Vol. 15, <date>March '51</date></hi>!!! Is this not very\n                fair, after <persName>Mr C.</persName> had<lb/> quoted your very words and which\n                could certainly not be found in the<lb/>\n                <date>March</date> Number of <date>1851</date>!? What must “A Jew” now think of<lb/>\n                this incidental point, after having read your Article on the<lb/> Swiss Treaty, in\n                which you refer to the very pages quoted<lb/> by <persName>Mr. C.</persName>?

Will you expose this extraordinary proceeding of a<lb/> Jew in this\n                affair? Justice demands it!</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">I read your Article on the New Prayer-book “<hi rend=\"underline\"\n                    >Minhag</hi><lb/>\n                <hi rend=\"underline\"><placeName>America</placeName></hi>,” in the last month's <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">Occidents</hi>. I agree fully with you<lb/> concerning the\n                transgression of power by the Compilers; I wrote<lb/> the <hi rend=\"underline\"\n                    >same</hi> truths to <persName>Dr Cohn</persName> in\n                    <placeName>Albany</placeName>\n                <hi rend=\"underline\">already two months</hi><lb/>\n                <hi rend=\"underline\">ago</hi>, that is, before you published your strictures. I\n                think the<lb/> very title is a piece of presumption and usurpation which<lb/> cannot\n                be justified save by means of vulgar abuse and<lb/> contemptible insults.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">Now an open and honest explanation; I received your<lb/> invitation\n                to the Consecration of your Synagogue. I did not<lb/> answer, nor attend. Why?\n                Because I endorse every word contained<lb/> in the Editorial of the <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">Asmonean</hi>, of <date>May 9.</date> last, and referring<lb/>\n                to the establishment of your congregation.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">With my wife's and my own best regard, and our wishes<lb/> for the\n                coming New-Year, I remain, as ever,</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(10)\">Yours,</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(10)\">most respectfully</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(11)\">\n                <persName role=\"author\">Dr M Mayer</persName>\n            </p>\n            <p>P.S. What is <persName>Mr. S. Jacobs</persName> doing? Is it </p>\n            <p>true, that he has been appointed Professor of </p>\n            <p>the Hebrew, at the Girard College, with a salary</p>\n            <p>of $2000 a year? So <persName>Mr A. H. Abrahams</persName> tells the people here.</p>\n            <p>What is is salary as Lecturer? Did you ever <sic>here</sic> the particulars of his\n                resignation?</p>\n        </body>\n    </text>\n</TEI>"
