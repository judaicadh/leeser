Of them it might truly<lb/> be\n                said, “There were giants in those days.” Yet no one of<lb/> these pious and learned\n                divines was ever elected for life. Some<lb/> of them held their offices at the will\n                of the congregation, or<lb/> from year to year, and others for limited periods. Our\n                congre-<lb/>gation always repudiated the life tenure of the office, and the<lb/>\n                correctness of the doctrine is at this time sustained throughout<lb/> the length and\n                breadth of the land. We have seen State after<lb/> State cast off the life tenure of\n                their Judges, because those Judges<lb/> felt themselves wholly irresponsible; and no\n                matter how gross<lb/> their official or personal misconduct might be, if it was not\n                such<lb/> as to consign them to the Penitentiary, the idea of an impeach-<lb/>ment\n                was a burlesque,—it seldom or ever amounted to anything.<lb/> So would it be with\n                any other officer with a like tenure; it is at<lb/> best but frail human nature, and\n                the <sic>sarcedotal</sic> character of the<lb/> office would not tend to make the\n                incumbent less arrogant or<lb/> presuming. This principle of the limited tenure of\n                office, was<lb/> not first called in requisition towards <persName>Mr.\n                    Leeser</persName>, but was acted<lb/> on by the congregation before he was born.\n                The early records</p>"

Therefore—</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\"><hi rend=\"italics\">Resolved</hi>, That it is the opinion of this\n                Board, that the conduct of the <persName>Rev. Isaac<lb/> Leeser</persName> in the\n                premises, is highly censurable, as tending to provoke irritation, create<lb/> bad\n                feeling, and as interfering in matters with which he hath no rightful concern.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\"><hi rend=\"italics\">Resolved</hi>, That his threat to appeal to the\n                public, shews an absence of the good<lb/> feeling that should exist on the part of\n                the Reader towards his congregation.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\"><hi rend=\"italics\">Resolved</hi>, That the Parnas transmit a copy of\n                this preamble and these resolutions<lb/> to <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>, and\n                also report the same to the congregation at their next meeting.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">This preamble and these resolutions were officially\n                communi-<lb/>cated to <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>; who never to the Board or\n                congregation<lb/> offered any explanation, palliation, or apology.

This brought the members<lb/> to their\n                feet, and the following resolution was adopted:</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\"><hi rend=\"italics\">Resolved</hi>, That the action of the Board be\n                approved.—Yeas, 20; Nays, 7; Ex-<lb/>cused, 2.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">This brings to a close the unpleasant review we have felt it<lb/>\n                our duty to make. It is matter of painful notoriety, that<lb/> during the long\n                sojourn of <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> among us, his personal<lb/> and official\n                career has been signalized by repeated outbreaks<lb/> similar to those already\n                sketched. Our business, however, has<lb/> been with him as a Hazan, and not as a\n                man, and it has been<lb/> no part of our purpose to dilate upon the numerous\n                objections<lb/> to his personal deportment, they will readily occur to all who<lb/>\n                know him; and his best friends are always obliged to admit,<lb/> that he is an\n                indiscreet, imprudent man. It is certain that he<lb/> never loved his congregation,\n                and in turn they could not love<lb/> him. His office was a respectable one, the\n                salary liberal, and</p>"
