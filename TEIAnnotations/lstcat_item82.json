I have been quite busy<lb/> with\n                various matters; and was at last afraid that I should not<lb/> remain the\n                    <add>אתרוג</add>; but while I was out yesterday a box arrived from<lb/>\n                <persName>Mr. Kursheedt</persName>, and among other things it contained two for\n                you,<lb/> which I sent off per this afternoon's boat directed to you, care of<lb/>\n                <persName>J.

However sent as\n                they<lb/> are we must be satisfied with them.

My discourse I shall<lb/> send by\n                some private opportunity, but when I cannot say, as<lb/> I now know of no one going\n                who will stop long enough to see<lb/> you.
