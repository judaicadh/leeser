Thou has commanded us in thy law, that we<lb/>\n\t\t\t\tshould propagate the doctrines Thou has bestowed on us; since Thou<lb/> has\n\t\t\t\tordained, “And ye shall teach them to your children, to speak of<lb/> them when thou\n\t\t\t\tsittest in thy house, when thou walkest by the way,<lb/> when thou liest down and\n\t\t\t\twhen thou risest up.” It is in obedience to<lb/> this behest that we, thy servants,\n\t\t\t\thave striven to establish a seminary<lb/> where the children born unto\n\t\t\t\t\t<placeName>Israel</placeName> might be taught of thy laws, and<lb/> acquire a\n\t\t\t\tknowledge of the sacred language of thy people, without<lb/> being exposed to the\n\t\t\t\tdanger of contamination, by instruction which is<lb/> hostile to the faith which we\n\t\t\t\tderive from Thee. Long has our striving<lb/> been in vain, our words fell on ears\n\t\t\t\tdeaf to admonition; but at length,<lb/> for which we bless thy Name, we are at the\n\t\t\t\teve of commencing the<lb/> work which is so necessary to the well-being of all\n\t\t\t\tdescendants of<lb/>\n\t\t\t\t<persName>Jacob</persName>. But, O! how feeble is this beginning—how small the\n\t\t\t\tnumber<lb/> of those who have inscribed their names unto Thee; but we entreat<lb/>\n\t\t\t\tThee, do not despise the offering which we bring unworthy, though it<lb/> be, of thy\n\t\t\t\tacceptance; and cause it to prosper and flourish, since Thine<lb/> is the power to\n\t\t\t\tbless and perfect what man begins in doubt and sorrow.</p>\n\t\t\t<p rend=\"indent(1)\">Long has thy Name been profaned among the gentiles, when they<lb/>\n\t\t\t\tsaw that they who were called thy people were untrue to their calling,<lb/> and\n\t\t\t\tfaithless to the mission Thou has assigned them, to be a guide to<lb/> the nations.\n\t\t\t\tThe knowledge of thy word and thy ways has fearfully<lb/> diminished, and many have\n\t\t\t\tfallen off, because they know not the prin-<lb/>ciples of thy faith, and the duties\n\t\t\t\tincident to its followers. Grant<lb/> then, O most merciful Father! that this school\n\t\t\t\tmay become a shining<lb/> ledge the minds of many who otherwise would grope their\n\t\t\t\tway in dark-<lb/>ness; that its scholars may become quick in the spirit of\n\t\t\t\tsalvation, and<lb/> stand forth as Israelites in whom Thou art well pleased; and\n\t\t\t\tthat<lb/> through them many others may be drawn into the sacred influence, to<lb/>\n\t\t\t\tdevote to Thee their life, their best exertions, and their whole soul.</p>\n\t\t\t<p rend=\"indent(1)\">Upon the teachers who are to engage in the holy work send, we<lb/>\n\t\t\t\tbeseech Thee, thy gracious beneficence; inspire them with meekness,<lb/> to labour\n\t\t\t\tin the arduous task which they have assumed, and with per-<lb/>severance not to flag\n\t\t\t\tamidst discouraging trials to which they will be<lb/> exposed. Lend eloquence to\n\t\t\t\ttheir tongues, and deep persuasion to<lb/> their words, that they may be able to\n\t\t\t\tenchain the youthful hearts, and<lb/> bind them indissolubly to thy service, so that\n\t\t\t\tin after years they may<lb/> rejoice over the multitudes they have brought under the\n\t\t\t\tovershadowing<lb/> wings of thy Providence.</p>"

He left them, how-<lb/>ever, the choice of\n\t\t\t\tremaining faithful to the Lord, or to select<lb/> some of the various idolatries\n\t\t\t\twhich were then in vogue, either<lb/> that of the Mesopotamians, or of the Emorites,\n\t\t\t\tnear whom they<lb/> then dwelt; but whatever the people might resolve on, he\n\t\t\t\tde-<lb/>clared his firm determination that he and his household would<lb/> serve the\n\t\t\t\tLord. The Israelites, however, who had been the<lb/> witnesses of the mercy and\n\t\t\t\tmight which had been displayed<lb/> before them, had no doubt of the truth of their\n\t\t\t\treligion in their<lb/> heart; they therefore chose the same worship which their\n\t\t\t\tleader<lb/> had chosen, and they declared, “We also will serve the Lord,<lb/> for he\n\t\t\t\tis our God.” After again receiving an affirmation of this<lb/> pious and prudent\n\t\t\t\tresolution, <persName>Joshua</persName> wrote all that had trans-<lb/>pired in a\n\t\t\t\tbook containing the law of God, and took a large<lb/> stone and erected it there,\n\t\t\t\tunder the beech tree, which was near<lb/> the sanctuary of the Lord; and then we\n\t\t\t\tread</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t<add>ויאמר יהושע הנה האבן הזאת תהיה בנו לעדה כי היא שמעה את כל אמרי ה' אשר דבר עמנו\n\t\t\t\t\tוהיתה בכם לעדה פן תכחשון באלהיכם: יהושע כ\"ד כ\"ז</add>\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p rend=\"indent(1)\">“And <persName>Joshua</persName> said, Behold this stone shall be as\n\t\t\t\ta testimony against us,<lb/> for it hath heard all the sayings of the Lord which he\n\t\t\t\thath spoken with us;”</p>"

The sanctuary is indeed no<lb/> longer ours; we have only\n\t\t\t\tsmall places for meeting to pray and<lb/> to exhort; but we lack the glorious\n\t\t\t\tmanifestation of the Divine<lb/> Presence which formerly animated and comforted us.\n\t\t\t\tBut the<lb/> law itself which was to be glorified through means of the public<lb/>\n\t\t\t\tministration of the priesthood is not yet extinct, and claims of<lb/> us, no less\n\t\t\t\tthan in days of old, that we should spread it among all<lb/> classes, as we read:\n\t\t\t\t“Assemble together the people, the men and<lb/> the women and the children, and thy\n\t\t\t\tstranger who is within thy<lb/> gates, in order that they may hear, and in order\n\t\t\t\tthat they may<lb/> learn, and fear the Lord your God, and observe to do all the<lb/>\n\t\t\t\twords of this law.” (Deut. xxxi. 12.) It was not only given for<lb/> the rich, the\n\t\t\t\tlearned, the wise, the aged, the native born, the<lb/> noble, and the priest, but\n\t\t\t\tfor all who bear God's soul in their<lb/> bosom, it was bestowed as the inheritance\n\t\t\t\tof all mankind, where-<lb/>fore all who were within reach of instruction were to be\n\t\t\t\tassembled<lb/> to take part in the septennial ceremony of its public\n\t\t\t\tproclamation<lb/> by the political chief of the people, in order that all might\n\t\t\t\tbe<lb/> animated by one desire to learn how to obey the will of the<lb/> universal\n\t\t\t\tGod, to whom all on earth bear the relation of children</p>"

No, fellow-Israelites, they were all, whether men or<lb/>\n\t\t\t\twomen, those in whom the spirit of knowledge dwelt, and it was<lb/> in their\n\t\t\t\tfootsteps that the multitudes followed, whether they<lb/> made their pilgrimage to\n\t\t\t\tthe temple at <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, whether they<lb/> ranged themselves\n\t\t\t\tunder their country's banner on the day of<lb/> strife, although they knew that all\n\t\t\t\tefforts would be in vain, since<lb/> the enemy had penetrated within their walls, or\n\t\t\t\twhether they<lb/> hastened to a yet more glorious death when tyrants demanded<lb/>\n\t\t\t\ttheir blood as the price of maintaining their religion.</p>\n\t\t\t<p rend=\"indent(1)\">We in our day require the same devoted zeal among our house-</p>"

If you have, you\n\t\t\t\tmust<lb/> have discovered that nearly all such connexions have resulted<lb/> from\n\t\t\t\tone cause, that is, that the offending parties did not con-<lb/>sider Jewish\n\t\t\t\tfamilies good enough for them to associate with;<lb/> they regarded themselves a\n\t\t\t\tdegree higher than all the Hebrews<lb/> they knew; and hence they sought for\n\t\t\t\talliances where they<lb/> fancied their noble blood would suffer no contamination.\n\t\t\t\tYou<lb/> may think that I speak harshly; but does the fact bear me out?<lb/> does\n\t\t\t\tyour own experience confirm what I say? I appeal to<lb/> yourselves, and let me be\n\t\t\t\tcondemned if in your innermost souls<lb/> you find not a response only too\n\t\t\t\taffirmative of my words. It is<lb/> nothing to the matter that persons of all grades\n\t\t\t\tof society have<lb/> so offended; for, alas! it requires neither wealth, nor\n\t\t\t\tintellect,<lb/> nor station, to puff up the human heart with pride, and no one<lb/>\n\t\t\t\tis so mean but he is in his own conceit higher than all the people<lb/> in\n\t\t\t\tself-importance.

But whence arose this self-<lb/>assumed\n\t\t\t\tsuperiority on the one side and the degradation on the<lb/> other? Do you know this?\n\t\t\t\tOnly reflect a moment, and the<lb/> matter will become clear to you. Answer me,\n\t\t\t\tWhere were our<lb/> religious schools in former times? where are they now? It\n\t\t\t\thas<lb/> always been to me a subject of profound astonishment and deep<lb/> regret,\n\t\t\t\tthat there was not a single school all over the country,<lb/> until very lately,\n\t\t\t\twhere a Jewish child could obtain any informa-<lb/>tion on his religion. The\n\t\t\t\tSynagogue was no place for instruc-<lb/>tion, because public lectures formed no part\n\t\t\t\tof the exercises.<lb/> Family worship, except in rare instances, was unknown,\n\t\t\t\tand<lb/> family religious reading was not though of, beyond a perusal of<lb/> the\n\t\t\t\tBible in the common translation, which was first ordered to<lb/> be read in churches\n\t\t\t\tby authority of <persName>King James the First</persName>, of<lb/>\n\t\t\t\t<placeName>England</placeName>. The religious books accessible were limited to\n\t\t\t\tthe<lb/> works of the late <persName>David Levi</persName>, who in his lifetime was\n\t\t\t\tbut ill-<lb/>rewarded for the strenuous exertions he made in the cause of<lb/>\n\t\t\t\tJudaism. Our Jewish predecessors in this country had only one<lb/> place of meeting,\n\t\t\t\tand this was the Synagogue, where the worship<lb/> was uniformly the same every\n\t\t\t\t\t<date>Sabbath</date> in the year, the tunes<lb/> only varying to suit the\n\t\t\t\tvarious occasions for which they are<lb/> very happily adapted.

The sequel was estrangement<lb/> from religion, and\n\t\t\t\ta constantly decreasing observance of the pre-<lb/>cepts of the Bible. I was told by\n\t\t\t\tan aged gentleman, now no<lb/> more, that about seventy years ago a Jewish woman,\n\t\t\t\twho kept a<lb/> boarding-house in <placeName>New York</placeName>, was remiss in\n\t\t\t\tsome small observance<lb/> which I have forgotten.

You may say that<lb/> this was tyranny, an\n\t\t\t\tunwarranted interference in private family<lb/> matters; I cannot agree with you in\n\t\t\t\tsuch an opinion, as it was<lb/> a public affair in which the pious Synagogue elders\n\t\t\t\tthought<lb/> themselves authorized by custom and prescriptive right to\n\t\t\t\tinter-<lb/>fere. But be this as it may, it shows the high degree of con-<lb/>formity\n\t\t\t\tthen prevailing in the oldest congregation in the country.<lb/> Now look at the\n\t\t\t\tcontrast with the present state of affairs!

Friendships have been<lb/> cemented which probably will\n\t\t\t\tlast during life; children have<lb/> learned to know each other as Jews, and to\n\t\t\t\tadmire each other's<lb/> character, who under other circumstances would never have\n\t\t\t\tcome<lb/> in contact; and I have every reason for believing that evil and<lb/>\n\t\t\t\tanti-Jewish influences have been eradicated from the minds of<lb/> some who\n\t\t\t\totherwise might have forsaken our communion. I do not<lb/> stand, however, here to\n\t\t\t\tflatter or to blame unduly; I have been<lb/> asked by my colleagues to urge the\n\t\t\t\timportance of our enterprise.<lb/> Therefore permit that I point out the defects of\n\t\t\t\ta mere Sunday<lb/> School, unaided by any other seminary. I will again\n\t\t\t\tacknow-<lb/>ledge, before I proceed further, that the example of the\n\t\t\t\tbenevo-<lb/>lent lady whom we all esteem, and whom I am proud to be per-<lb/>mitted\n\t\t\t\tto call my friend, and that of her disinterested assistants,<lb/> has been imitated\n\t\t\t\tin various other parts of the country, until the<lb/> just charge of actual\n\t\t\t\tignorance is no longer applicable to all places<lb/> where this has been done. But\n\t\t\t\tno one can say, that much has<lb/> been accomplished towards diffusing a knowledge\n\t\t\t\tof the language<lb/> of the Scriptures, without which no education of an Israelite\n\t\t\t\tcan<lb/> be complete. The little that can be acquired in extra hours,<lb/> when the\n\t\t\t\tchildren have not to recite their usual lessons or to<lb/> study them, is not\n\t\t\t\tenough, and must necessarily be very ineffi-<lb/>cient. The child is wearied with\n\t\t\t\tconning over matters which are<lb/> in themselves of but questionable use, even when\n\t\t\t\tthoroughly ac-<lb/>quired; and when you demand of him now to repair to his<lb/>\n\t\t\t\tHebrew teacher, he will find out a thousand reasons for desiring<lb/> to escape from\n\t\t\t\tthis unwelcome additional task. And I tell you,<lb/> without in the least qualifying\n\t\t\t\tmy assertion, that without an<lb/> adequate knowledge of the Hebrew, sufficient at\n\t\t\t\tleast to <sic>under-<lb/>derstand</sic> the Scriptures and the ordinary prayers, no\n\t\t\t\tJew can<lb/> allege that he has acquired that knowledge which is all in all to<lb/>\n\t\t\t\thim. A Hebrew not to be a Hebrew in language when this is<lb/> within his reach, is\n\t\t\t\tan absurd proposition, which requires no<lb/> argument to illustrate. And pray, why\n\t\t\t\tshould we not teach to<lb/> all our children the holy tongue, that they may be able\n\t\t\t\tto speak<lb/> understandingly of God's word when they sit at home, and when</p>"

Our Society,\n\t\t\t\thowever, has made it its object to<lb/> become, if permitted by you, and if duly\n\t\t\t\tencouraged, under the<lb/> blessing of Heaven, to whose safe keeping we commit it,\n\t\t\t\tan<lb/> earnest agent to remove the reproach so far as our sphere of<lb/> action can\n\t\t\t\textend. We purpose to combine elementary and<lb/> afterwards scientific education\n\t\t\t\twith a gradual and progressive<lb/> acquirement of Hebrew, Hebrew literature, and\n\t\t\t\treligion. It is<lb/> not to be as in other schools, a secondary matter whether\n\t\t\t\tthe<lb/> children learn Hebrew and religion or not, but they are to acquire<lb/>\n\t\t\t\tthese if nothing else even can be imparted. Still imagine not<lb/> that we are not\n\t\t\t\tfully alive to the importance of classical and<lb/> elegant literature; we know how\n\t\t\t\tto appreciate both, and we<lb/> trust that in a year hence our teachers will prove\n\t\t\t\tto you that<lb/> Jewish children can advance in all the necessary branches of<lb/>\n\t\t\t\teducation under the superintendence of <sic>instructers</sic> of their own<lb/>\n\t\t\t\tpeople no less than of others. We mean, however, to let the<lb/> objects and\n\t\t\t\tconcerns of eternal life not be merely the work of<lb/> spare time and a leisure\n\t\t\t\tday, but to see that daily, and in the<lb/> usual school hours, the language and\n\t\t\t\treligion of our fathers are<lb/> properly and full illustrated. Permit me to call\n\t\t\t\tyour attention<lb/> to one fact: the members of the committee of school\n\t\t\t\tdirectors,<lb/> with a single exception, have no offspring of their own old\n\t\t\t\tenough<lb/> to be participants in the benefit which the school is to confer, it<lb/>\n\t\t\t\tis merely a sense of duty which impels them to be active in the<lb/> cause, and to\n\t\t\t\tincur, if need be, a considerable amount of labour<lb/> to carry out their views.\n\t\t\t\tBut as this is the case, the greater<lb/> necessity rests upon those who have\n\t\t\t\tchildren, and who wish to<lb/> rear them in a religious and hopeful manner, to send\n\t\t\t\tthem to us,<lb/> that we may <sic>fulfil</sic> in them the obligation which in\n\t\t\t\tobedience to<lb/> our religion we have assumed.</p>"

But let me tell you that this is not wise, though<lb/> it may be prudent.\n\t\t\t\tOur efforts must fail, if we meet with no<lb/> encouragement; this I am willing to\n\t\t\t\tacknowledge; but on the<lb/> other hand I maintain that we shall do more than redeem\n\t\t\t\tour<lb/> promise, if the children are entrusted to our care. What is to<lb/> prevent\n\t\t\t\tus giving as good an education as is furnished in public<lb/> or private schools? do\n\t\t\t\tyou believe that we cannot teach reading,<lb/> writing, arithmetic, history,\n\t\t\t\tgeography and the higher branches,<lb/> if these be required? The very idea is\n\t\t\t\tabsurd; whatever the<lb/> scholars show an aptness for can be taught as well, to say\n\t\t\t\tthe<lb/> least, under Jewish supervision as any other. Only try us, if it<lb/> be\n\t\t\t\tonly for one year; and if at its expiration you are dissatisfied<lb/> with the\n\t\t\t\tprogress of your children, taking as the standard of<lb/> comparison what they have\n\t\t\t\tacquired before elsewhere, we shall<lb/> be willing to acknowledge that we have\n\t\t\t\tfailed.</p>\n\t\t\t<p rend=\"indent(1)\">You must, however, reflect again, that we not merely charge<lb/>\n\t\t\t\tourselves with simple education; we wish to return your children<lb/> to you at the\n\t\t\t\tend of each season improved in manners and morals.<lb/> We wish to subject their\n\t\t\t\tminds to a wholesome restraint, where<lb/> love shall govern and not force, where\n\t\t\t\tintellect is to lead, not<lb/> vain ambition. Look at the effects of the Sunday\n\t\t\t\tSchool, how<lb/> they have ennobled natures some thought incapable of\n\t\t\t\timprove-<lb/>ment, and then say that the effect will not be much greater if<lb/> the\n\t\t\t\tdiscipline be carried out through the whole period children<lb/> are at school. It\n\t\t\t\twill most assuredly take some time to get<lb/> everything in is proper train;\n\t\t\t\tperhaps several weeks must elapse<lb/> before we can fairly assert that we have made\n\t\t\t\ta proper begin-<lb/>ning; the thing is yet new, and circumstances, the surest\n\t\t\t\tindica-<lb/>tions of Providence, must show us how we are to proceed; only<lb/> have\n\t\t\t\ta little patience; the same you would demand if you all<lb/> were in our place, and\n\t\t\t\twe promise that we will faithfully strive<lb/> to do our whole duty.

Only let me\n\t\t\t\tbeg you, not to doubt hastily of a good<lb/> result; it has been well said that “our\n\t\t\t\tdoubts are traitors;” and<lb/> it is certain that no great enterprise ever succeeded\n\t\t\t\twhere the<lb/> actors themselves doubted of their final success.

Without a miracle, this will\n\t\t\t\tbe<lb/> impossible, and we are not vain nor foolish enough to claim the<lb/> ability\n\t\t\t\tto accomplish the impracticable. But let me beg of you<lb/> all, not to undervalue\n\t\t\t\tour and your capacity for succeeding with<lb/> this school because we are Jews. The\n\t\t\t\tremark is often made, that<lb/> we Israelites cannot do things like other people,\n\t\t\t\tand that we are<lb/> altogether too self-willed to succeed where others find no bar\n\t\t\t\tto<lb/> carry out their views.

We know,\n\t\t\t\tmoreover, no exemption from duty;<lb/> we have no standard of indulgences or\n\t\t\t\trestrictions; no noble<lb/> classes who may transgress, no lower orders who may\n\t\t\t\tyield them-<lb/>selves to degrading vices in order to gratify the sensualities\n\t\t\t\tof<lb/> the lordlings, who look upon them with contempt even whilst they<lb/>\n\t\t\t\tminister to their pleasures. The Jew is a Jew, whether he is the<lb/> pedlar that\n\t\t\t\tbends double under the burden which his laborious<lb/> shoulders carry, or the baron\n\t\t\t\tof the <placeName>Austrian Empire</placeName> who idles<lb/> away his hours on the\n\t\t\t\tluxurious sofa. The hopes of the last are<lb/> not a whit higher and nobler than\n\t\t\t\tthose of the first, and this one<lb/> has the same claims to immortality and a\n\t\t\t\tglorious hereafter, as<lb/> the most favoured child of luxury. Fortune's gifts may\n\t\t\t\tbe, by<lb/> the will of Providence, very unequally distributed; but let not<lb/>\n\t\t\t\ttheir possessors deem themselves better men or more God-<lb/>favoured on this\n\t\t\t\taccount. They have a tangible advantage in<lb/> their exemption from toil; they may\n\t\t\t\tlie down at night without<lb/> torturing their brain how to provide for their little\n\t\t\t\tones by the<lb/> dawn of to-morrow. Is not this enough for them? must they also<lb/>\n\t\t\t\twish to perpetuate for their families a rank which the now humble<lb/> and their\n\t\t\t\toffspring are never to attain? Weak! silly! wicked<lb/> idea! <hi rend=\"italics\"\n\t\t\t\t\t>God</hi> has elevated you, I tell you, not <hi rend=\"italics\">you</hi> have\n\t\t\t\tacquired<lb/> your position by your unaided skill and labour; and He can\n\t\t\t\tun-<lb/>make you, bring you down again to the dung-hill whence you<lb/> sprung, or\n\t\t\t\tyour children, should you even be carried on a splen-<lb/>did bier to the grave, may\n\t\t\t\thave to claim the assistance of those<lb/> whom you despise as too inferior to\n\t\t\t\tassociate with you and yours.<lb/> The world, and especially this country, presents\n\t\t\t\tso many instances<lb/> of changes of fortune, that it would be superfluous for me to\n\t\t\t\thunt<lb/> for examples of which you, my hearers, know many in your own<lb/>\n\t\t\t\texperience. Let us hope, therefore, that no silly pride will pre-<lb/>vent parents\n\t\t\t\tof all standings in society from availing themselves</p>"

We demand of those able to pay a small fee\n\t\t\t\ttowards<lb/> defraying the expenses which we have to incur, and we trust that<lb/>\n\t\t\t\tthis will be cheerfully given; but they who are not blessed with a<lb/>\n\t\t\t\tsuperabundance of means are invited, nevertheless, to entrust to<lb/> us their\n\t\t\t\tchildren, and we promise them that they shall not suffer<lb/> the least reproof for\n\t\t\t\tthe inability of their parents. All we ask<lb/> of them is to send their children\n\t\t\t\ttidily dressed, and cleanly in<lb/> their persons, so that no stain will attach to\n\t\t\t\tthem for their humble<lb/> state. And let me here remark at once, that nothing so\n\t\t\t\tpromotes<lb/> good conduct and proficiency in study as scrupulous cleanliness;<lb/>\n\t\t\t\tin a dirty body a dirty soul too often dwells, and the exterior is<lb/> mostly a\n\t\t\t\tfair index of the inward man. Cleanliness, say our<lb/> wise men, is the first step\n\t\t\t\tto the acquisition of holiness, and it is<lb/> a necessary element of Jewish life,\n\t\t\t\tas our holy law amply proves.<lb/> It is not to be questioned, that if the children\n\t\t\t\tof the poor come<lb/> hither so that all can freely associate with them, it will be\n\t\t\t\tan<lb/> incentive for the rich to apply to us also to take theirs under<lb/> our\n\t\t\t\tcharge; and only the non-observance of this rule can operate<lb/> as an excuse to\n\t\t\t\twithhold any one from taking advantage of the<lb/> institution we now commence.</p>\n\t\t\t<p rend=\"indent(1)\">Let no one thing that any injury can result to better trained<lb/>\n\t\t\t\tchildren, by associating with those not so fortunate as them-<lb/>selves; in\n\t\t\t\tafter-life they will have to meet with persons of all<lb/> classes, and it is no\n\t\t\t\tdetriment that they become early acquainted<lb/> with the fact that all are not\n\t\t\t\tprosperous alike. It will produce<lb/> in them kindliness of feeling, at finding\n\t\t\t\tthat the same virtues<lb/> can dwell in a heart covered by a frieze coat, as that\n\t\t\t\twhich<lb/> beats under a velvet mantle, and that the sorrows of the poor</p>"

This is well understood in the<lb/> country where I\n\t\t\t\twas born. Universal education has long since<lb/> been established there; and at the\n\t\t\t\tsame colleges where the sons<lb/> of the nobles acquire their collegiate education,\n\t\t\t\tthe children of<lb/> the day-labourers are freely admitted.

But what need is there to go over\n\t\t\t\tthe ocean to seek for<lb/> examples of the kind?

And who<lb/> dares not to remind them of their\n\t\t\t\torigin?

It is our<lb/>\n\t\t\t\tintention, should the demand make it necessary, and our funds<lb/> suffice, to open\n\t\t\t\tdistrict schools at convenient distances, so as to<lb/> afford all children an\n\t\t\t\topportunity to avail themselves of our<lb/> Hebrew education. For the present we\n\t\t\t\thave selected this place<lb/> as the most central, and we hope that no captious\n\t\t\t\tfault-finding<lb/> will prevent all our space to be soon claimed by attentive<lb/>\n\t\t\t\tscholars.
