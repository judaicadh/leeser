The Colony of <placeName>Georgia</placeName> was\n                settled in <date>1732</date> under the auspices<lb/> of <persName>General\n                    Oglethorpe</persName>, whose “strong benevolence of soul” was<lb/> sung by\n                    <persName>Pope</persName>, and commented upon by all the good, and great\n                men<lb/> of his day. The end, and aim of those who settled\n                    <placeName>Georgia</placeName> was charity,<lb/> in its widest, and most\n                extended sense, and the motto on the<lb/> seal of the Trustees, spoke but the\n                language of truth. <hi rend=\"underline\">Now sibi</hi>,<lb/>\n                <hi rend=\"underline\">sed aliis</hi>. Not for ourselves, but for others. A Colony\n                springing into<lb/> existence under such auspices, with a fertile soil, and a\n                genial<lb/> climate, soon became an Asylum for the oppressed of every<lb/> land, and\n                every faith. The door was open wide to all—land was<lb/> granted to each emigrant,\n                and toleration raising its broad, and<lb/> ample, banner, proclaimed to all, entire\n                freedom of conscience.<lb/> Under these circumstances it was to be expected that the\n                Jew<lb/> with no country, “<hi rend=\"underline\">but the grave</hi>,” would speedily\n                seek that land<lb/> where “under his own vine, and his own fig tree,” he might<lb/>\n                worship the God of his Fathers, “with none to molest, or make him<lb/> afraid.”\n                Accordingly we find that as early as <date>1733</date>, about forty<lb/> Jews sailed\n                from <placeName>London</placeName>, or in the language of the original<lb/>\n                memorandum (kept in hebrew, and still preserved in this<lb/> city) “voluntarily\n                embarked from <placeName>London</placeName>, and paid their passages”<lb/> “thence\n                to this country, and arrived in <placeName>Savannah</placeName> in the state”<lb/>\n                “of <placeName>Georgia</placeName>, on the <date>eleventh day of July 1733</date>.”\n                The following are</p>"
