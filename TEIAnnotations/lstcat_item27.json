I am really glad to understand that you\n                are<lb/> so much better and only hope it may long continue to be the<lb/> same. You\n                want the news of this place<lb/> but as I am engaged as you well know from early in\n                the morning to late in the evening<lb/> I do hear but little. But some few Items I\n                will just tell. Yester-<lb/>day week <persName>Miss Israel</persName> was married;\n                the wedding went off delightfully<lb/> people danced, sang &amp; were merry. Some\n                remained till three or four in<lb/> the morning, and I staid till near ½ past\n                eleven. The same may be<lb/> said of yesterday's <sic>frolick</sic>; there was\n                almost literally “fife, fiddle &amp;<lb/> drum,” or tambourine, fiddles &amp;\n                    <sic>clarionett</sic>, I left also about ½ aft. 11<lb/> and already I am up a\n                little after 5 to send this if possible by<lb/>\n                <persName>David I. Cohen</persName> whom I just stumbled upon in the street\n                yester-<lb/>day morning during a recess which I gave to the boys, in consequence\n                of<lb/> keeping them in till 2 on account of the wedding. <persName>Mr.\n                    Allen</persName><lb/> made a Berit<add>?</add> last <date>Thursday</date>, which\n                is the fourth we have<lb/> had in about three weeks. This year thus far there have\n                been 10<lb/> funerals, 9 Berits and three weddings, besides several female\n                children<lb/> were born during this same periods. <persName>Miss Rose\n                    Hays</persName> is to be<lb/> married this fall to <persName>Mr. Charles\n                    Marx</persName> of <placeName>Richmond</placeName>, but this<lb/> no doubt is\n                old news. <persName>Mr. Mordecai</persName> was here during the<lb/> holydays, when\n                I delivered an address on education, I have not<lb/> yet received it back; I believe\n                that it was not very well<lb/> received by many on account of its coming home too\n                much; but<lb/> this of course cannot be avoided, when one wishes to do his duty.<lb/>\n                <persName>Mr. Mordecai</persName> came here for the purpose of leaving\n                    <persName>Laura</persName> at<lb/> a boarding school; she appears to be a very\n                fine girl. I understand<lb/> that <persName>Miss Peixotto</persName> is learning the\n                stock making business; I believe<lb/> it must be true, altho' she did not tell me so\n                herself. My <sic>scholl</sic> now<lb/> numbers 16 boys; <persName>David\n                    Sarfaty</persName> has not yet come, and I doubt whether<lb/> he will come in a\n                hurry. <persName>Simha P.</persName> told me that she had heard but not direct</p>"
