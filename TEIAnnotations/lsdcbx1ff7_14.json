The phases of\n                                        a nation's fortunts<add>?</add> for thousands of<lb/> years\n                                        described in 3 or 4 lines, and <del>their</del> its sinking\n                                        spirit revived and supported<lb/> in affliction's darkest\n                                        hour, lengthened thro' ages of unspeakable misery,<lb/> by a\n                                        word or two of hope and faith, Endless as Eternity,\n                                        unshakable and<lb/> unmovable as the foundations of the\n                                        world! The <add>?</add> and<lb/> its exposition reminded me\n                                        of what we read of the <add>גאון</add> of old<lb/> with his\n                                                  <add>מתורגמן</add> at his side; the former giving\n                                        the latter his texts and<lb/> the lesson he wished to deduce\n                                        from them—whilst the latter<lb/> improvised with all the\n                                        fervency, fluency and fire of oriental<lb/> eloquence, in\n                                        which the richest imagery and boldest figures were\n                                        inter<lb/>spersed, melting the hearts and <add>?</add> the\n                                        minds of the listeners, and<lb/> conveying instruction at\n                                        once indelible and imperishable.

I\n                                        sometimes<lb/> sit over that quaint old medrash Rabba, and\n                                        think how immeasur-<lb/>ably superior the discourses of\n                                        those glorious old Rabbais whose<lb/> names figure there\n                                        must have been to the fine spun prolixities<lb/> of modern\n                                        preachers. “And yet for all that” has been the cause<lb/> of\n                                        inflicting on your patience a lot of Bosh<add>?</add> which\n                                        I will<lb/> now end with the request that you will favor\n                                        your readers<lb/> with some more of the same beautiful\n                                        sentiments and views.</p>\n                    </body>\n          </text>\n</TEI>"
