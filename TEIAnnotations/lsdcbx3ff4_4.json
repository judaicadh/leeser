When I came<lb/> home I found that <persName>David Peixotto</persName> was\n                very sick with<lb/> the inflammatory rheumatism; he is sick yet, and<lb/> quite\n                unable to help himself, but still he is better<lb/> than he has been. It is not very\n                pleasant to be<lb/> sick at a boarding house, especially where he is if it<lb/> were\n                my case I would not be able to stand it, on account<lb/> of the greasy smell of\n                cooking which constantly salutes<lb/> one as soon as you enter the door. It is well\n                that<lb/> some folks have stronger nerves than others.\n                <persName>Rachel</persName><lb/> is the whole day with him, and <add>?</add> when\n                she can be<lb/> away from her school. It will probably not before next week<lb/>\n                that he will be able to sit up or to get up without some<lb/> assistance. Several\n                young men have sat up with him<lb/> every night, and <persName>Mrs.\n                    Cozens</persName> also one night and <persName>S.</persName>\n                <add>?</add><lb/> two. He receives a good deal of attention, as he is generally<lb/>\n                liked. I myself have not offered to stay with him; first<lb/> I am not well enough\n                to do so, and secondly, <hi rend=\"underline\">I must do to</hi><lb/>\n                <hi rend=\"underline\">all the Congregation alike</hi>, and as I cannot sit up with\n                all, I must<lb/> decline offering such assistance to all. I have been\n                frequently<lb/> to see him. He is very restless; but this is natural enough</p>"
