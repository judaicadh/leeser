In<lb/>\n                <date>November</date> last you wrote me “ I presume you have no time for<lb/>\n                anything but your own work, or else your fathers memoir<lb/> ought to have been\n                finished long since. ” You were right in<lb/> your first supposition—the memoir (or\n                nearly all) had been<lb/> long finished and sent to <placeName>England</placeName>\n                to my family there for<lb/> perusal—I had to delay till I got materials very few\n                of<lb/> which however I did not possess before my visit to\n                    <placeName>England</placeName><lb/> three years since. They wished to publish it\n                in pamphlet form<lb/> and distribute it to the congregation (K. K. Shaar\n                    Ashmaim<add>?</add>) on<lb/> consideration however we decided not to do so, and\n                the M.S.<add>?</add>\n                <lb/> remained in <placeName>London</placeName> at my request until I had an\n                opportunity<lb/> to bring it out. <persName>Mr W. Benjamin</persName> has recently\n                returned from<lb/>\n                <placeName>England</placeName> &amp; brought it with him, having no copy I did not\n                wish<lb/> to trust the mail. As you were the first to express a desire<lb/> to\n                obtain full particulars of my late revered and gifted parents<lb/> career I send it\n                now to you, although perhaps a <placeName>London</placeName><lb/> periodical, would\n                be the more appropriate vehicle for<lb/> publication. Of this you may be assured no\n                one in <placeName>England</placeName><lb/> (not even <persName>Beuisch</persName>\n                with whom I am intimate) except my own<lb/> family has seen it, and no one in\n                    <placeName>America</placeName>, except the <persName>Joseph's</persName><lb/>\n                family here. It was <persName>Mrs J. H. J.</persName> who said it ought to be<lb/>\n                printed. I will leave it to you to decide whether you think<lb/> it of sufficient\n                general interest for your new volume. <persName>Mr<lb/> Abraham Joseph</persName>\n                goes to <placeName><sic>new</sic> York</placeName> tomorrow and takes it<lb/> with\n                him.

The recent large increase of the working\n                members of the society, its improved<lb/> status at home and reputation abroad, and\n                the removal of the Society to their present commodious building, all<lb/> demand\n                that this collection should attain the same completeness as that of the Canadian\n                birds, now in the Museum,<lb/> and become equally useful for reference. The Council\n                would therefore respectfully represent to Naturalists, Sports-<lb/>men and others,\n                that they could much advance the desired object by sending their specimens to the\n                Society for pre-<lb/>servation; and to those kindred Societies who might also feel\n                disposed to co-operate, the duplicate specimens of<lb/> minerals, fossils, and\n                birds, both American and foreign, now in possession of the Society, would readily be\n                made<lb/> available where wanted.
