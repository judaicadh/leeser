Do I ask more than naturally pertains\n                between<lb/> man and man? You admit that the developments of the day indicate<lb/>\n                the present as a fit time for rising in behalf of <placeName>Israel</placeName>. Let\n                it then<lb/> be decided whether I may lawfully and properly undertake to act<lb/> in\n                this good cause in conjunction with the chosen servants of the<lb/> most High.
