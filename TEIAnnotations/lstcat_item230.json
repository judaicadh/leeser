A short time subsequently,<lb/>\n                he published the Daily Prayers in Hebrew and English, for the use<lb/> of the German\n                Jews; and in the year <date>1853</date> he published, in quarto<lb/> form, his\n                translation of the Bible. Of this <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> said, “That\n                it<lb/> is not a new notion by which he was seized of late years, which<lb/>\n                impelled him to the task, but a desire entertained for more than a<lb/> quarter of a\n                century, since the day he <sic>quitted</sic> school in his native<lb/> land to come\n                to this country, to present to his fellow-Israelites an<lb/> English version, made\n                by one of themselves, of the Holy word of<lb/> God.”</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">If <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> had done naught else, this work\n                alone would entitle<lb/> him to the gratitude of every English reader.
