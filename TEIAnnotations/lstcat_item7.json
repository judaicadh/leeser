For circumstances had occurred, <del>and</del>\n                over which<lb/> I had myself not the least control, which had excited feelings<lb/>\n                that ought not to exist between us, and I fondly hoped that<lb/> a mutual\n                interchange of opinions might tend to enable us<lb/> to come to a better\n                understanding, and to proceed in future with<lb/> perfect harmony and mutual good\n                will. But a construction of the<lb/> by-law, which specifies that none but members\n                &amp; their sons over the<lb/> age of thirteen years should be present at any\n                meeting of the congregation,<lb/> that the congregation could on no account permit\n                any other than these<lb/> persons to be present at their deliberations, deprived me\n                of this pleasure,<lb/> and at the same time was the cause, as I truly believe, that\n                the<lb/> unimportant difference of opinion between us has not been long<lb/> since\n                satisfactorily settled; for I honestly think that a few hours<lb/> free &amp; candid\n                conversation would have exhibited things in a light<lb/> very different from what\n                some now view it, or at least formerly did view<lb/> it. Understanding therefore,\n                that a meeting has been called in<lb/> relation to the <sic>reengagement</sic> or\n                reelection of the Hazan, I take the<lb/> liberty of sending you my own views in\n                writing, and I shall endea-<lb/>vour to condense as much as possible, not wishing to\n                fatigue<lb/> you with listening to a long harangue, or to introduce matters<lb/> not\n                relevant to the subject. Let me premise the ardent hope,<lb/> that every member of\n                the congregation in proceeding to delibe<lb/>rate upon the matter before the meeting\n                will discard every<lb/> thing like prejudice and partiality, (and <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">endeavour for</hi><lb/>\n                <hi rend=\"underline\">once to throw personal dislike</hi> or <hi rend=\"underline\"\n                    >friendship</hi> aside) and vote<lb/> in a manner which he can conscientiously\n                hereafter look<lb/> upon as the best conducive to the welfare of the\n                congregation<lb/> and to the promotion of the spread among us of that heavenly<lb/>\n                religion which we have received; and lastly act, not as opponents<lb/> or supporters\n                of the present incumbent of the office, but as men<lb/> and Israelites anxious for\n                the general welfare of their faith.</p>"

It is now nearly eleven years ago that\n                through<lb/> the partiality of several residents of\n                    <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> I was applied to to become<lb/> a candidate\n                for the office of Hazan then recently vacant through the<lb/> death of the\n                    <persName>Revd. A. I. Keys</persName>. I at that time lived with my uncle at\n                    <placeName>Rich-<lb/>mond</placeName> in capacity of a mercantile clerk; I had\n                the confidence of many<lb/> persons in the state of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>\n                and the city of <placeName>Richmond</placeName>, and if I had en-<lb/>tered in\n                business for myself my chances of success would have been as<lb/> good, to say the\n                least, as that of many young men, who since then <del>that time</del><lb/> have\n                earned an honourable independence and respectable standing.<lb/> I had at that time\n                just passed my twenty-second year, my health, though<lb/> never very robust, was\n                better than it is now and has been for many years<lb/> past; and though young and\n                inexperienced I was not dazzled with the<lb/> prospect of obtaining a high &amp;\n                responsible office. On the contrary, I not<lb/> only expressed, but truly felt a\n                want of confidence in my abilities to<lb/> discharge properly the new duties to be\n                expected from the situation of a minister<lb/>\n                <del>properly</del>; and for a long while I absolutely refused to permit my\n                name<lb/> to be used. My friends were not satisfied, they urged, that the\n                education<lb/> I had received, and the talents which their partiality ascribed to\n                me,<lb/> pointed out to me a different calling from that of a merchant; they<lb/>\n                appealed to my feelings as an Israelite who ought to labour in the propa<lb/>gation\n                of true religion among his brethren; and to my want of <del>a</del> riper years<lb/>\n                <del>age</del> which I opposed to my fitness for the office, the averred that<lb/>\n                that would correct itself every day, as daily my increase of age would entitle<lb/>\n                me to more respect. Without being satisfied that my happiness<lb/> would be\n                increased by a change of pursuits, I left, being over-persua-<lb/>ded by the\n                arguments of those who were older, wiser and more expe-<lb/>rienced than myself,\n                    <del>I left</del> the paternal roof of my uncle about<lb/> the middle of\n                    <date>August 1829</date> to go away persons entirely strangers to<lb/> me, and\n                upon whom I had no farther claims than the community<lb/> of faith given to the\n                humblest of <placeName>Israel's</placeName> sons upon the most exalted<lb/> I had\n                fondly hoped, that if the <sic>sufferages</sic> of the members would call<lb/> me to\n                preside over their worship and to appeal in their behalf<lb/> to the throne of\n                Grace, every thing like disunion<add>?</add>, want of confidence,<lb/> or the wising\n                up with worldly matters, <hi rend=\"underline\">such as regards salary, emolu-</hi><lb/>\n                <hi rend=\"underline\">ments &amp;c would have been banished</hi>. But I regret that\n                such was<lb/> not the case. In the letter sent to me by the committee of\n                corres-<lb/>pondence, consisting I believe of <persName>Messrs R.

Yet after<lb/> I had been\n                here a few days I was waited upon by several gentlemen,<lb/> one of whom your\n                respected Treasurer, who represented to me that the funds<lb/> of the congregation\n                were then too low to allow the payment of the above<lb/> sum. I therefore authorized\n                an election for <hi rend=\"underline\">one</hi> year with a <hi rend=\"underline\"\n                    >voluntary</hi><lb/> surrender of two hundred Dollars; but when the report was\n                afterwards<lb/> brought to me that I had been elected by a vote of 27 to 7 for\n                two<lb/> years at $800 per annum, I also consented though against my original<lb/>\n                intention, thus proving that I was not unwilling to make a pecuniary<lb/> sacrifice\n                where I thought it was requisite. During the first year, how-<lb/>ever, of my\n                residence here, various unpleasant things took place,<lb/> which it is needless to\n                call to mind again; and altho' matters were<lb/> smoothed over again, <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">still the report reached a distant congregation</hi>,<lb/> that\n                my situation was not very pleasant here. Therefore overtures<lb/> were made to me by\n                several influential members from that place<lb/> to take the office of Hazan vacant\n                there. About the same time a meeting<lb/> of this congregation was held, at which it\n                was understood that it had been<lb/> left to a committee to reengage me at $800 per\n                annum for five years.<lb/> As this amount was evidently less than I had a right to\n                expect, I did<lb/> not think myself at liberty altogether to decline a proposal\n                made<lb/> to me from abroad; yet <hi rend=\"underline\">I made such exorbitant demands\n                    as almost</hi><lb/> to preclude any idea of their being agreed to; one was <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">an election with-</hi><lb/><hi rend=\"underline\">out being a\n                    candidate</hi> or going on to be heard beforehand; second, one election<lb/> for\n                life; third, an absence of three months every year, and lastly to be<lb/> permitted\n                to stay in this congregation three months after the expiration<lb/> of my time of\n                service, to enable them to provide a suitable successor.<lb/> Strange enough, all\n                but the two first demands (and they in a modified<lb/> degree to correspond with the\n                laws of the above Kahal) would have been accep-<lb/>ted, if I may put any confidence\n                in the assertions of the heads of the con-<lb/>gregation, if in case I had consented\n                to accept office there; but as<lb/> their election was to be held in\n                    <date>July</date>, and as the meeting of this congre<lb/>gation would not take\n                place till <date>September</date>, I declined soon all farther<lb/> correspondence,\n                as I could not conscientiously leave this place before I<lb/> had made every effort\n                at reconciliation.

So matters remained for the<lb/> whole period, till a\n                reelection became necessary, when although<lb/> there was no opposing candidate,\n                still I was only reelected, as I heard<lb/> a year afterwards, by a bare majority,\n                despite that there was<lb/> no charge of misconduct or incompetence against me.

If any influ<lb/>ence was\n                used by my friends to induce any one to vote for me, it was<lb/> done without my\n                knowledge, and I may here remark that I<lb/> never asked for any man's vote since\n                the first day of my being<lb/> called to come here, thinking that in elections,\n                particularly to religious<lb/> offices the candidate ought to be removed as far as\n                possible from the<lb/> humiliation of receiving a vote as a personal favour which\n                might<lb/> otherwise be denied to his merits or qualifications. After a very\n                ani-<lb/>mated contest the congregation honoured me for the fourth time with<lb/>\n                their suffrage, but now by a decided majority of all the members<lb/> of the\n                congregation. But I regret that I am compelled to notice that this<lb/> renewed mark\n                of confidence was accompanied by a redirection of<lb/> my salary, when I had every\n                right to expect, that you would<lb/> have taken the opportunity when voting me in\n                again to <hi rend=\"underline\">increase</hi><lb/> my income, as since my first coming\n                here your finances had<lb/> so much improved and the member of\n                    <sic>worshippers</sic> so greatly<lb/> increased. Why this reduction was made\n                every member knows as<lb/> well as I can tell him, and I do not wish to revive\n                unpleasant feelings<lb/> by expressing my own sentiments of a proceeding which\n                operated so inju-<lb/>riously upon my interests. Enough the congregation thought fit\n                to fix the election<lb/> for <hi rend=\"underline\">three</hi> years at 800 Dollars\n                per annum; but when a committee consisting<lb/> of two members notified me of the\n                result I answered, that I would accept<lb/> the office but leave the salary to be\n                farther adjusted at a future meeting.<lb/> A special meeting was called for general\n                purposes, but no quorum was pre<lb/>sent; of course the committee were not able to\n                report my answer<lb/> as their doing so would have answered no purpose whatever.\n                Before<lb/> now the regular meeting of the congregation came round, a bond was<lb/>\n                offered to me for signature (the first that ever had been drawn up<lb/> since my\n                holding office) which stipulated that I would serve three<lb/> years at $800 pr\n                annum. As I thought that the reduction<lb/> ought not to have been made, and that\n                the congregation at a later<lb/> meeting would, as I conceived, see ample reason to\n                amend their<lb/> vote, I unhesitatingly refused signing except conditionally for\n                one<lb/> year, and the other two to be left for future adjustment. I\n                accordingly<lb/> wrote the letter to the Parnass which I believe has been read to\n                you, and<lb/> also sent such a bond for his approval, as accorded with my own\n                views.</p>"

I stated<lb/> this both in words and in writing to the\n                Parnass, but he conceived it<lb/> as his duty to refuse the bond I offered, and to\n                insist upon the<lb/> one which had been tendered to me. It was in fact, that I\n                should<lb/> resign, or sign a bond which I never could conscientiously assent\n                to.<lb/> I therefore refused positively for about four weeks. But then reports<lb/>\n                were spread, in fact the Parnass told me so himself, that a meeting<lb/> would be\n                called, and that my want of confidence in the congregation<lb/> would doubtfully so\n                much operate against me, as to prevent any vote<lb/> in my favour being obtained.\n                This however had no <hi rend=\"underline\">influence upon</hi><lb/>\n                <hi rend=\"underline\">me</hi>, believing myself in the right; and there was then the\n                gentleman who,<lb/> had been the opposing candidate yet in the city, and\n                consequently my<lb/> not serving would have left the congregation the <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">choice of a person who</hi><lb/>\n                <hi rend=\"underline\">has since been elevated</hi> to the ministry of two respectable\n                congregations.<lb/> But appeals were made to my <hi rend=\"underline\">feelings</hi>\n                <add>?</add>, whether I could consent to have<lb/> those I had served so long, and\n                that besides <del>that</del> there was enter<lb/>tained such a prejudice against the\n                above gentleman by many mem<lb/>bers, that they would not vote for him; and thus the\n                congregation would<lb/> be placed by my <hi rend=\"underline\">obstinacy</hi>, as it\n                was termed, to be without a minister<lb/> and that <hi rend=\"underline\"\n                    >disunion</hi> would be the inevitable consequence. Besides this<lb/> I ought to\n                trust to the <hi rend=\"underline\">honour</hi> and good will of the congregation\n                and<lb/> that doubtlessly at the next meeting ample justice would be done to\n                me.<lb/> It may have been a <hi rend=\"underline\">weakness</hi> in me to recede from\n                my first purpose,<lb/> yet if I have erred, I erred for the sake of peace. However\n                this may be,<lb/> I referred the whole matter to the judgment of my honoured uncle,\n                whom you<lb/> nearly all know and respect, and I told him that I would abide by\n                his<lb/> advice. So I did; in a few days I got a letter from him advising me to<lb/>\n                accede to the demand made upon my forbearance; I did press my<lb/> purpose, I signed\n                the bond, and I believe that no one can say that<lb/> either since then or before I\n                did otherwise than faithfully discharge<lb/> my duty; not because I had signed a\n                bond, but because I wish to<lb/> do what is incumbent on me without faltering or\n                evasion. I had<lb/> however good reasons for believing that the congregation would\n                have recon-<lb/>sidered their vote, and not regarded the bond in any other light\n                than that<lb/> of a peace-offering; but I <hi rend=\"underline\">deceived myself, a\n                    bargain it was considered</hi>,<lb/> and so it has remained to this day. I did\n                not tell you, how galling</p>"

I therefore last autumn wrote<lb/> to the congregation stating what\n                I expected of them; and I leave it to<lb/> their nonsense of propriety whether my\n                views are right or wrong.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">For the future I have to state the following. Experience<lb/> has\n                proved that the salary originally promised me is not enough<lb/> for a moderate\n                support of a genteel decent appearance. Other<lb/> congregations not more numerous\n                or at least not greatly so, and<lb/> not having much more extensive means, give\n                their Hazan<lb/> a house and from $1200 to 1800 salary per annum, besides\n                perqui<lb/>sites which are larger or smaller according to circumstances.\n                More-<lb/>over in every instance elections have been made during good<lb/>\n                behaviour. We have all learned from observation, that a small minority can<lb/> at\n                any election render the result very uncertain, and besides<lb/> constant reelections\n                for short periods weakens the attachment of<lb/> the minister to the congregation.\n                He knows not whether all his<lb/> honest services will render him sufficiently\n                popular to insure<lb/> him in his situation and every days longer continuance in\n                office<lb/> disqualifies him more for other pursuits if he should have<lb/> to\n                resort to them if in case he should be discarded. It is no argument<lb/> to say,\n                that such a result is unlikely, as it is within the range<lb/> of probability; and\n                the constant <sic>harrassing</sic> of the mind does not pro-<lb/>mote either\n                contentment or good will to others. Some may say, a<lb/> minister of religion ought\n                to be above such thoughts, his mind should<lb/> seek for heavenly support; it is\n                true that there is some sinfulness<lb/> mixed up with all feelings of discontent;\n                still your minister<lb/> is a man like yourselves, he has feelings like yourselves,\n                and<lb/> if he is injured and his mind is distorted he must necessarily feel<lb/>\n                discontent even if he tries to overcome it. The very thing that<lb/> he has\n                something to forget and to forgive destroys his usefulness<lb/> in part, and greatly\n                militates against his inward peace. This<lb/> can be avoided, and it therefore ought\n                to be done. An amiable arrange<lb/>ment between us can easily be arrived at, if you\n                only endeavour to</p>"

According to my view of the case therefore, I can see many<lb/>\n                cogent reasons in favour of the proposal I now make to the congregation,<lb/> &amp;\n                none of any force against it.
