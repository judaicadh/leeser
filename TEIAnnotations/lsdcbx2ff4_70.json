But now, I have sat\n                down<lb/> to write a lengthy answer to your rather long letter, and intend<lb/> to\n                be as open and candid with you as you have been with me.<lb/> First then, you take\n                umbrage at my <sic>indorsing</sic> what <hi rend=\"underline\">you</hi> call<lb/> the\n                    <hi rend=\"underline\">scurrilous</hi> and <hi rend=\"underline\">impertinent</hi>\n                editorial of the Asmonean in re-<lb/>lation to the establishment of your Synagogue.\n                Now, my dear Sir,<lb/> I have always held the opinion that it is unjustifiable, <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">under</hi><lb/>\n                <hi rend=\"underline\">any circumstances whatever</hi>, to establish a new religious\n                associ-<lb/>ation, unless <hi rend=\"underline\">from principle</hi>. If a change of\n                doctrines has<lb/> taken root in a religious body, then, <hi rend=\"underline\">and\n                    then alone</hi>, I think,<lb/> it is right for those repudiating that change, to\n                establish an<lb/> association of their own. Was such the case in\n                    <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>?<lb/> Decidedly not! And for this reason I\n                subscribe to the re-<lb/>marks of the <hi rend=\"underline\">Asmonean</hi> which are\n                neither scurrilous nor impertin-<lb/>ent. I would ask any unprejudiced mind, whether\n                the following<lb/> words, to which I made allusion in my last letter, are such\n                as<lb/> you describe them? “What necessity can be shown in\n                    <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName><lb/> for two Sephardim congregations? There\n                exists no difference on<lb/> dogma; none on form, tone or accentuation; neither is\n                the edifice<lb/>\n                <sic>to</sic> small for the congregators, even, if they all invariably attended</p>"

Besides, have not <hi rend=\"underline\">you</hi> given me the clue<lb/> to\n                “the situation of affairs in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>,” at our\n                interview<lb/> on the <date>17<hi rend=\"sup\">th</hi> of July 1856</date>? Did <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">you</hi> not then tell me that “it<lb/> depended but upon your\n                encouraging the movement, and a new<lb/> congregation would be established; for the\n                tyranny in the old<lb/> had become intolerable.” Thus then it was “<hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">tyranny</hi>” that<lb/> gave birth to the new congregation.\n                Tyranny of opinion, principle,<lb/> reform, innovation, and the like?

Now,<lb/>\n                is the very attempt on the part of these managers not in itself<lb/> sacrilegious?\n                And who are, in general, their assistant teachers?<lb/> A few young girls that do\n                not even know how to <hi rend=\"underline\">read</hi> the language<lb/> of the Bible,\n                or some gentlemen who may be good business men,<lb/> mechanics, artists &amp;c\n                &amp;c, but understand just as much of teaching<lb/> and their Religion as their <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">sister</hi>-colleagues.
