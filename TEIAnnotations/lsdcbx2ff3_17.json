The sentence\n                con-<lb/>tained in my manuscript, runs thus: “mit <add>?</add><lb/>\n                <add>?</add>.” It appears to<lb/> me that <persName>Dr Ph.</persName> Made this\n                change, which, by the way, I do not approve,<lb/> with the view of having\n                    <persName>R. Hirsch</persName> kept out of the controversy. I<lb/> hope that his\n                candid explanation will satisfy you; since it can<lb/> be no discredit to you, to be\n                compared with <persName>R. Hirsch</persName>, whose<lb/> sincerity of principles and\n                honesty of purpose, no one, not even<lb/> his fiercest opponents can question. But\n                here I must<lb/> complain of your translation. In rendering the clause, “In<lb/>\n                <add>?</add>,” by “I will admit, with<lb/> sincerity,” you did not do justice to the\n                spirit of my words. My</p>"
