About the<lb/>\n                <add>שם המפורש</add> have I to remark, that I can impossibly<lb/> alter the\n                expression in this part, which you have in<lb/> hand, as I take the name as a\n                foundation of the<lb/> Theology, in the other parts I do not intend to mention<lb/>\n                it. And after all I must remark, that the word<lb/>\n                <persName>Jehovah</persName> is quite an other expression, than that forbid<lb/>den\n                one. You write, that my style is not popular<lb/> enough, I tried my best to draw\n                the <sic>Philosophie</sic><lb/> from heaven down to the earth; but I can</p>"
