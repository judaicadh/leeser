If<lb/> under what circumstance soever it is a moving light to behold the\n                creature in humble<lb/> adoration worship his Creator, the impression upon the heart\n                must be deeper still<lb/> when millions of immortal beings, prompted by community of\n                sentiments, shout a<lb/> hallelujah to their Divine Benefactor; and although the\n                manner in which their tokens<lb/> of gratitude are exhibited, may differ externally,\n                yet when the thought which pervades<lb/> the mind is but one, it will harmonize\n                every dissonance into a sweet accord. As at<lb/> the touch of the <sic>skilful</sic>\n                musician, all the keys of a stringed instrument, are attuned<lb/> into a unity of\n                sound, which delights the ear, &amp; softens the soul, so does<lb/> gratitude,\n                striking the chords of human hearts, knit them together into a single chain<lb/> of\n                godly affections. And thus is why, after he had enumerated some of the merciful\n                acts<lb/> of the Deity, the Shepherd King called upon all mankind, to raise a hymn\n                of thanks<lb/> to the Lord God of <placeName>Israel</placeName>. “Bless <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">our</hi> God, ye people” he exclaimed, for ye all are the\n                children<lb/> of his love &amp; the recipients of his bounty. Because they first\n                acknowledged his name, he<lb/> chose the family of <placeName>Israel</placeName> as\n                a kingdom of priests, but He delights in the praise of every<lb/> creatures that has\n                breath. It is remarkable, however, that the sentence which precedes<lb/> this\n                summons of the inspired writer, and which we have selected for our text, speaks\n                of<lb/> the watchfulness of Providence in the government of nations, &amp; of his\n                wisdom in thwarting<lb/> the devices of the froward. I will <del>read</del> cite it\n                that you may ponder thereon: It was thus. “He<lb/> ruleth by his power for ever, his\n                eyes behold the nations, let not the rebellious exalt themselves”<lb/> My Friends!\n                It is to proclaim that self-same truth, that the pre-beings who populate<lb/> our\n                Commonwealth, have solemnly assembled. Do acknowledge that their prosperity as\n                Penn=<lb/>=sylvanians, and their greatness as an integral part of a glorious\n                Confederacy, spring <del>forth</del> from the<lb/> fountain of all good, they have\n                readily acquiesced in the pious request of their Governor.<lb/> They have not\n                convened together, to triumph over the issue of sanguinary battles, they have\n                not<lb/> brought the trophies of recent conquests, nor do they exult at this hour\n                because their sword<lb/> has thinned the ranks of their adversaries; they come not\n                to the dwelling of the Eternal, to rejoice<lb/> over their accession of dominion:\n                no, a nobler incentive actuates the children of the American<lb/> Republic; they\n                meet to thank the Rock of all ages, that He has vouchsafed to show unto them<lb/>\n                also the year his mercy &amp; protection. And indeed, who can gainsay, when\n                recalling to his mind<lb/> the momentous events which have rapidly succeeded each\n                other, who can gainsay, but that at the<lb/> opening of this year, they\n                    foreb<add>?</add> disasters! The honor of the nation was in jeopardy, our<lb/>\n                heirloom so precious &amp; so cherished, had been polluted &amp; the swords of\n                millions quenched in their<lb/> scabbards who curbed those vehement spirits, that\n                might have hastened to a fatal termination<lb/> a transaction which demanded\n                unparalleled discretion? God in his mercy. God “whose eyes<lb/> behold the nations”\n                stood at the right hand of the just &amp; averted from them impending<lb/> dangers.\n                He dispelled the mist which was fast gathering around our horizon, &amp; honor\n                &amp;<lb/> peace continued to harbor wither our territories. Across the mighty ocean\n                was the olive<lb/> branch wafted &amp; they with whose community of language &amp;\n                community of interests bound with<lb/> us, disavowed their connivance at any act of\n                advised contempt. But not alone from<lb/> without were the arms of the Lord extended\n                to uphold our national dignity &amp; withhold<lb/> our hand from being imbued in\n                human blood, but written likewise, He proved our stanchion<lb/> in the hour of\n                trial. A deleterious seed had taken root amidst the salubrious plants<lb/> with\n                which this garden of the <placeName>North</placeName> is replete, it rapidly spread\n                its <sic>venermous</sic> influence,<lb/> &amp; threatened to sap the tree of life,\n                beneath whose foliage, wearied humanity finds<lb/> a restoring shade. But the air of\n                heaven blighted its growth, so that the stem it<lb/> brought forth, must need wither\n                &amp; die. Ah no! God would not suffer this soil <sic>consumated</sic><lb/> to\n                freedom, to become a <placeName>land of Nod</placeName>, where the exile would be\n                denied a tranquil house.</p>\n            "

Not alone we\n                &amp; our children,<lb/> shall, God willing, rejoice at the teeming of our crops,\n                but nations we know not, will eat<lb/> of our plenteous harvest &amp; be satisfied.\n                Ought we not then to be thankful?

See, how a protracted war has<lb/>\n                drained the sources of wealth, see the lands which might have yielded treasures,\n                lying<lb/> fallow, because the stalworth arms of the\n                    <sic>ploughman</sic><add>?</add>, were made <del>the</del> to <sic>weild</sic>\n                the sword.<lb/> Here, poverty thicken the operatives rise against their rulers,\n                there, they are compelled to<lb/> maintain by their industry, the pageants of an\n                idle aristocracy.

But you will say, that these<lb/>\n                privileges which we enjoy, are the natural consequences of our pre-eminence in the\n                scale<lb/> of civilization. I shall not now compete your assertions, but I will\n                merely inquire whether<lb/> it is by adroitness alas that the clouds become pregnant\n                with exhalations, &amp; discharge upon<lb/> our land <add>?</add>ious rains, or\n                whether we can by our ingenuity control light &amp; heat that they<lb/> may subserve\n                our purposes.

Why is the history of that continent\n                to be sullied by events<lb/> so opprobrious? Because its political institutions are\n                rotten to the core, &amp; to prevent their<lb/> downfall, every means, even the\n                foulest, must unscrupulously be resorted to.</p>\n            <p>But our strength is invincible, mainly because it is built upon the Rock of all ages.\n                    <hi rend=\"underline\">That</hi><lb/> has ever been our impregnable fortress. You\n                remember the motto upon the ensign of true<lb/> patriots who fought under the\n                immortal <persName>Warren</persName>. On one side the words “Appeal to heaven”<lb/>\n                were inscribed in blazing characters, whilst on the other, the later device “Zim\n                branstaht sustinet”<lb/>\n                <add>?</add> shone, as an evidence of their conviction that the <hi rend=\"underline\"\n                    >Omnipotent</hi> would have<lb/> wrought their salvation. And the same faith old\n                prove, amidst all the perils of the<lb/> revolutionary war, the sustaining power of\n                our gallant leaders. They never despaired of<lb/> success, but uplifted hands they\n                invoked the blessing of the God of battles in their sacred cause,<lb/> hence, when a\n                victory had signalized their progress, or when their enemies <del>war</del> had\n                been<lb/> routed they summoned their brethren to a solemn convocation and together\n                in the dwelling<lb/> of the Eternal “they made the voice of his praise be heard” I\n                know not, whether it is from<lb/> this ancestral <sic>habitude</sic>, that our\n                annual <date>day of thanksgiving</date> derives its origin, but spring<lb/> whence\n                it may, it argues well for the descendants of our magnanimous forefathers, it<lb/>\n                proves that although the pernicious connexion between religion &amp; politics has\n                been for<lb/> ever dissolved, yet the former refulges<add>?</add> with undimmed\n                brightness in the eyes of the sons<lb/> of <placeName>America</placeName>. It\n                proves, what the enemies of liberty, would fair <hi rend=\"underline\">dis</hi>prove,\n                that<lb/> the true of religion, takes deeper root, thrives more quickly, &amp; sends\n                its ramifications far<lb/> &amp; wide, whenever the dew of heaven irrigates a soil\n                consecrated to freedom.

I have striven to\n                instill the belief that our prosperity, during the year<lb/> was the immediate\n                effect of the goodness of the Most High. But He upheld our dignity,<lb/> when it was\n                impugned, that by his unceasing watchfulness was the subtlety of<lb/> miscreants,\n                detected &amp; frustrated; that through his benignity, was our Confederacy\n                spared<lb/> the <sic>calamaties</sic> which afflict foreign climes, &amp; lastly\n                that He has, not alone for our sake<lb/> but for that of afflicted humanity—whom we\n                call brethren, &amp; whom we generously invite<lb/> to partake of our\n                happiness—powerfully cemented our glorious Union, that it may endure<lb/> “as the\n                days of heaven upon earth”. Now, my beloved hearers! <sic>if</sic> I have succeeded\n                in<lb/> bringing these solemn truths home to your hearts, I may hope to achieve a\n                still greater success<lb/> I may hope to rejoice at the supreme eminence which this\n                city of love, will attain in the<lb/> scale of religious influence.
