EDITORS: I am informed that some<lb/> persons have spread\n                the rumor that I am of<lb/> Israelitic origin. Why they do so, or what has<lb/> led\n                to the rumor, I do not know, nor is it of any<lb/> consequence. Perhaps it may even\n                be thought<lb/> unimportant whether the story be believed or not,<lb/> but truth is\n                any day worth as much as error, and<lb/> as we live here in a small and close\n                community, I<lb/> may as well state that there is not a shadow of truth in it.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">I have known as honorable men, and when I<lb/> was a soldier, as\n                brave men, among the Jews as<lb/> among any other people; but I have not the\n                honor<lb/> of belonging to the <sic>Shemitic</sic> tribe, for whom<lb/>\n                <persName>Mr. D'Israeli</persName> claims the highest rank among the<lb/> peoples of\n                the earth. I can only claim unadulte-<lb/>rated Teutonic blood. Neither I, nor any\n                of my<lb/> forefathers, had ever any admixture of Hebrew<lb/> blood in his veins. I\n                am simply and plainly a<lb/> German by birth. That is all; and since it is a<lb/>\n                fact, I do not see that rumor has the right of cir-<lb/>cumcising me without my\n                consent.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">There is a passage in my “Journal in Greece,”<lb/> which, at\n                    <persName>Niebuhr's</persName> advice, I gave in Latin, be-<lb/>cause “a foreign\n                language does not blush.” Those<lb/> who have perused it will remember it as a\n                very<lb/> curious incidental proof that I descend from the<lb/> Gentiles.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">Not long ago I saw it stated that <persName>Niebuhr</persName>\n                had<lb/> been of Jewish extraction. This is no more the<lb/> truth. If by chance\n                this article should be seen<lb/> in <placeName>Germany</placeName>, it would create\n                a hearty laugh.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">If I leave no imprint on “the shore of time,” it<lb/> is utterly\n                indifferent to talk of me or my extrac-<lb/>tion; if I succeed in doing that which\n                others see<lb/> fit to claim as not unworthy of note, then let it<lb/> simply be\n                vindicated in the right quarter. I am<lb/> a German emigrant, and not ashamed of it;\n                I am<lb/> an American citizen, (and one that is <emph rend=\"italics\">of age</emph>,\n                for I<lb/> have been a citizen more than twenty-one years,)<lb/> and am proud of it,\n                and have always shown that<lb/> am so.    Your obedient,</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(7)\"><persName>FRANCIS LIEBER</persName>.</p>\n            <p>\n                <date>6-28-1854</date>\n            </p>\n            <p rend=\"End clipping\"/>\n            <p rend=\"indent(11)\">Turn over</p>"
