Having recently gotten hold of the last issue of<lb/> the “Occident” I was\n                much surprised on finding in it an article<lb/> from <persName>Mr E.\n                    Marcussohn</persName> denying his ever having abjured<lb/> Judaism. Now it may\n                be proposed to state what I know of this<lb/> gentleman, as the Editor of the\n                Occident seems to solicit information<lb/> concerning him.</p>\n            <p><persName>Mr Marcussohn</persName> was introduced to me at my house by\n                    <persName>Rev<lb/> Mr Bonhomme</persName> (a gentleman long and favorably\n                known.)<lb/> He appeared a little awkward from his want of a ready use of<lb/> the\n                English language, for this he apologized, and expressed a<lb/> desire to enter upon\n                the study of it. Thereupon I proposed that<lb/> he should instruct me in Hebrew and\n                I would in turn teach him<lb/> English. In order to carry out this arrangement he\n                was to visit<lb/> me at a certain <del>period</del> hour every morning (That is when\n                his<lb/> engagements or mine did not otherwise prevent). For several<lb/> weeks he\n                continued to come, when together we would read the<lb/> Old and New Testaments\n                frequently <sic>stoping</sic> while reading to<lb/> comment upon some passage. He\n                appeared greatly interested in<lb/> the New Testament especially with those portions\n                found in the<lb/> first chapters of <persName>Mark</persName>, embracing the\n                Savior's sermon on the<lb/>\n                <placeName>Mount</placeName>. He observed the most profound <sic>reverance</sic> in\n                speaking<lb/> of <persName>Christ</persName>. He acknowledged the importance of a\n                Mediator in our<lb/> approaches to the Father. Spoke of the <sic>ineficiency</sic>\n                of the law to justify<lb/> the sinner. Told me that he prayed to God to pardon his\n                sins, and that he<lb/> felt that he had received pardon. I spoke plainly with him\n                touching<lb/> the witness of the spirit, &amp; the inward peace consequent upon\n                the<lb/> forgiveness of sins. He remarked that he felt that he had received\n                this<lb/> witness &amp; this peace. I felt anxious for <persName>Mr M.</persName> to\n                be placed beyond all doubt<lb/> in regard to his spiritual change, &amp; hence I\n                often conversed with him<lb/> upon the subject of the new birth—or scripture\n                religion. He expressed great<lb/> dissatisfaction with the duties laid upon him as\n                Teacher of the Jewish faith,<lb/> Complained of his brethren, their want of\n                enlightenment &amp; so on. Said he<lb/> was receiving from them $500.00 a year as a\n                salary, that they paid him at<lb/> fixed times, said that one installment would be\n                due him in a few weeks,</p>"

Said that he had given up his church\n                &amp; had declared<lb/> in favor of Christianity. He stated at the same time that he\n                need money, &amp; had<lb/> no means of paying it, as the Jews whom he had been\n                serving would no doubt<lb/> withhold that portion of his salary which was due him.\n                Seeing him in<lb/> this unpleasant dilemma, I advanced him $70 which he said\n                would<lb/> be sufficient to pay him out of debt.

He handled the razor very\n                awkwardly but<lb/> made out to sh<add>?</add>.
