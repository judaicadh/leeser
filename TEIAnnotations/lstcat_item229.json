This plan, which\n                pro-<lb/>mised to be so beneficial, soon found many willing to co-operate; and<lb/>\n                the zeal of the teachers, was seconded by the eagerness of the children<lb/> to\n                avail themselves of the opportunity to acquire a knowledge of their<lb/> religion.\n                The school was at first commenced under the patronage<lb/> of the Female Hebrew\n                Benevolent Society of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>; but un-<lb/>less he errs,\n                the writer thinks that it never had to depend for support<lb/> upon that excellent\n                charity, as from the outset donations were<lb/> freely offered for the furtherance\n                of this blessed undertaking.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">The first assemblage of the scholars took place at the house\n                    <placeName>No. 97,<lb/> Walnut <sic>street</sic></placeName>; but when the\n                ladies had to give up the room they<lb/> there occupied, the Franklin Institute,\n                with a commendable spirit of<lb/> liberality, permitted them to take possession of a\n                spacious apartment</p>\n            "

The only other books within our reach were the\n                Elements of<lb/> the Jewish Faith, by <persName>Rabbi S. Cohen</persName>, and the\n                Instruction in the<lb/> Mosaic Religion, arranged from the German of\n                    <persName>Johlson</persName>, by the writer<lb/> of this. In this emergency the\n                Child's Bible Questions, by the A. S.<lb/> S. Union, was of necessity but partially\n                adopted, there not being a<lb/> similar book and one more free from sectarian matter\n                at hand; but it<lb/> is pleasing to remark, that an adaptation of this little work\n                after our<lb/> own manner is now in the hands of a young lady of this place,\n                and<lb/> will, it is hoped, see the light soon, and this with the consent of\n                the<lb/> A. S. S. Union, who have waived their copyright in our favour; this,<lb/>\n                too, is a highly gratifying fact, and it speaks loudly and emphatically<lb/> of the\n                enlightened views of the board of publication of that powerful<lb/> institution, and\n                especially of the kindness of <persName>John Hall, Esq.</persName>, through<lb/>\n                whom this polite offer has been conveyed.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">Last spring the first anniversary examination took place.

The<lb/> endowment, likewise, in both places, has been\n                quite liberal; and there<lb/> can be but little doubt, that the commencement so\n                happily made, will<lb/> not fail to produce all the good results which could\n                reasonably be<lb/> expected.

The northern half of the ground-floor of<lb/>\n                the synagogue was reserved for the scholars, each class headed by its<lb/> teacher;\n                and the steps leading to the ark were occupied by the<lb/> youngest class, and\n                certainly formed a collection of happy faces,<lb/> which no one could look on\n                without pleasure; and these little ones,<lb/> when called upon to answer their\n                Bible-questions, acquitted themselves<lb/> in a manner highly gratifying to their\n                parents and creditable to their<lb/> youthful teacher.
