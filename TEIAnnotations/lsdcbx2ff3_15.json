When I received your letter, you<lb/> were on your way to\n                    <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName>, wherefore I had to await for<lb/> your\n                return. Then I read in the Occident that <persName>Rev. Mr Jacobs</persName><lb/>\n                had sent you a reply to my last letter in your periodical, when<lb/> I again thought\n                to await its publication. Afterwards I was<lb/> so busily engaged in the most\n                various occupations and duties,<lb/> that, besides having been unwell for the last 3\n                months, I could<lb/> barely find time to write the most urgent private letters.\n                In<lb/> the meanwhile, when I intended again to do my duty, and reply<lb/> to yours\n                above mentioned, I heard that <persName>Rev. Mr Jacobs</persName> had<lb/> sent you\n                a communication—like that to the Israelite—condemnatory<lb/> of my reading a Psalm\n                in the church, in consequence of<lb/> which I thought it proper again to defer my\n                reply, with the<lb/> view of avoiding even the least appearance of my intention<lb/>\n                to bias you by a private letter. Now, as <persName>Mr J.'s</persName> letter\n                must<lb/> be <del>publish</del> in the Occident, so that I can no longer\n                exercise<lb/> any influence, I may <del>say</del> after all, write with all\n                impunity.<lb/> This much also I may add, with regard to this affair, that I\n                hope,<lb/> as a matter of simple justice, you have in your “<hi rend=\"underline\"\n                    >Note</hi>” not al-<lb/>together disregarded my explanation in the Israelite,\n                nor forgotten<lb/> that whatever <persName>Mr J.</persName> now writes about me, is\n                tinctured with a good</p>\n            "

And here let me relate to you<lb/> the\n                whole history of <persName>Mr J.'s</persName> relation to me, which I have hitherto\n                from delicacy<lb/> withheld from you. When <persName>Mr. J.</persName> arrived here,\n                I immediately called upon him, as<lb/> common courtesy demands it, and told him at\n                once: Let us be friends, al-<lb/>though our religious views diverge; you preach\n                orthodoxy and I, reform,<lb/> don't you attack my congregation, as I intend never to\n                make my<lb/> reference to yours; especially let us meet each other in society\n                with<lb/> that <sic>collegial</sic> friendship, as ought ever exist between\n                gentlemen; such a<lb/> cause will have a good impression not only upon the Jews, but\n                upon the<lb/> society at large, and is calculated to raise the Jewish character in\n                the<lb/> eyes of the Public. <persName>Mr J.</persName> made all the promises I\n                could expect. But<lb/> already on the following <date>Sabbath</date>, he <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">directly</hi> attacked us in the most<lb/> venomous manner; of\n                course, at that time, when the “honeymoon” was<lb/> not yet over, he could do such\n                things with impunity; you must know<lb/> this yourself, for at the same time he\n                treated you in the same arrog-<lb/>ant manner. He neither returned my visit, nor\n                that of many of my<lb/> conregators who had likewise called upon him. Yet, I cared\n                not about<lb/> all that; I continued to treat him with the most marked\n                courtesy.<lb/> During the summer of <date>1853</date> he came to me to borrow a\n                book, the<lb/>\n                <add>מורה נבוכים</add>, but told me <hi rend=\"underline\">in my room</hi>, that I\n                should not look upon<lb/> his coming as a visit, as he had merely come to borrow\n                that book. My<lb/> answer was: My library is at all times at your disposal. I even\n                had<lb/> him invited to my wedding; he neither came, nor acknowledged the\n                in-<lb/>vitation, nor ever congratulated me. yet, I continued to treat him with\n                <lb/>courtesy, until in <date>November 54</date> he charged me, in a conversation we\n                had<lb/> near the Post-Office with having perverted<add>?</add> a passage in the\n                Shulchan A-<lb/>such, when I coolly answered, “he only retorted in this manner,\n                because<lb/> he felt that I had proven his inconsistency,” upon which he flatly\n                called<lb/> me “ignorant;” when I told him, that it was below my dignity to\n                answer</p>\n            "

Soon afterwards<lb/> the\n                presentation to <persName>Mr Valentine</persName> (Occident viii, 37) took place,\n                when it so happened<lb/> that I attended, for the first and only time—the meeting of\n                the Chebrah preceding<lb/> the presentation. During that meeting, <persName>Mr\n                    J.</persName> insulted me 5 times, in the most<lb/> outrageous manner, while I\n                merely smiled. He had then forgotten that<lb/> his star had greatly waned.\n                    <persName>Mr. V.</persName> called him thrice to order, and ordered<lb/> him at\n                last to sit down; nay! And this point it is particularly that ex<lb/>asperated\n                    <persName>Mr J.</persName> mostly—declared before the society, that my\n                complaint,<lb/> that during my absence several poor strangers had been buried\n                without<lb/> ministerial attendance, was true, although <persName>Mr. J.</persName>\n                had, in the course of<lb/> his insults, denied the fact. Not one of his long\n                    regators<add>?</add> was then found<lb/> who did not confess that <persName>Mr.\n                    J.</persName> acted in a most ungentlemanly &amp; <add>?</add>-<lb/>ness &amp;\n                amiability. From that time <persName>Mr. J.</persName> took his speech from\n                    <persName>Mr<lb/> V.</persName> &amp; <persName>N. Levin</persName>—During the\n                same winter he saw himself induced<lb/> to resign in consequence of repeated\n                complaints having been made by Congreg<lb/>ators of his, of his undignified\n                deportment in society, of his leaving<lb/> the synagogue during the reading of the\n                Haphtorah to taste a <hi rend=\"underline\">drink</hi>,<lb/> &amp;c. &amp;c.; nay!\n                even before <hi rend=\"underline\">his</hi> Board it was remarked, that there was<lb/>\n                such a wide difference between his deportment &amp; mine. He was <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">permitted</hi>,<lb/> upon his <hi rend=\"underline\"\n                >request</hi>, and after an apology from the pulpit, to withdraw his<lb/>\n                resignation. Yet he must give vent to his wrath, I was no longer ap-<lb/>proachable,\n                and this he most outrageously insulted <persName>Mr Valentine</persName>, on<lb/>\n                <add>פסח</add>\n                <date>5615</date>, <hi rend=\"underline\">during Public Service</hi>, which\n                    <add>?</add> caused an irremediable breach<lb/> between these two, and a great\n                reserve with others. Add to this, that I am<lb/> on a most friendly with most, and\n                intimate with many of his congregation,<lb/> and you can understand the rest.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">Last summer, you must remember, he began to write against\n                    <persName>Kalish</persName> &amp;<lb/>\n                <persName>Wise</persName>, on “Ladies' singing &amp;c”, when he wanted books of\n                reference, which has not,</p>\n            "

A Polish Jew often visited me with the pretext to “<hi\n                    rend=\"underline\"><add>?</add></hi>,”<lb/> and made extracts from the Talmud,\n                Maimonides &amp;c.

And when his\n                first Article ap-<lb/>peared, some of <hi rend=\"underline\">his admirers</hi>\n                expressed to me their astonishment at this,<lb/> that he could write so calmly.
