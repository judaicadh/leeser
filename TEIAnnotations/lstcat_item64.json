The<lb/> examination was conducted under the\n                presidency of the President of the Beth-el con-<lb/>gregation, assited by the School\n                committee and the Reader, the <persName>Rev. Mr. Traub</persName>.<lb/> A very\n                interesting introductory address was delivered by a male scholar of the<lb/> first\n                class, after which that <del>first</del> class was examined by <persName>Dr.\n                    Wise</persName> on Catechism<lb/> &amp; lessons in religion. The female teacher,\n                    <persName>Miss Chaplin</persName> to whose execution<add>?</add><lb/> the\n                greatest credit is due, and who is a teacher any school may be proud of,<lb/>\n                examined in Spelling, Reading, Arithmetic &amp; Geography. <persName>Dr.\n                    Wise</persName> also exami<lb/>ned in reading the Prayer Book &amp; Pentateuch,\n                and much praise is due<lb/> to the Rabbi for his labours in teaching the scholars\n                the true way of becoming<lb/> what they ought to be. The specimens of writing also\n                afforded proof of<lb/> astonishing progress <del>for</del> during the first six\n                months of the existence of the school.<lb/> The sight the examination presented, is\n                said to have been a pleasant one, and it<lb/> was delightful to witness parents\n                watching with great anxiety, to observe<lb/> whether their wishes would <del>be\n                        <add>?</add>\n                </del> be gratified, and their children would indeed<lb/> become learned; but the\n                progress then exhibited inspired them with the<lb/> confident hope, that they would\n                not be disappointed with the blessing of Hea-<lb/>ven. The examination over, prizes\n                were distributed to the deserving<lb/> scholars, and the whole was concluded by an\n                address from a female<lb/>\n                <del>scholar</del> pupil of the first class. <del>We could use</del></p>\n            <p><placeName><hi rend=\"underline\">St. Thomas</hi></placeName>.</p>\n            <p><persName>Mr. A.

Also that<lb/> Hebrew\n                may advance to the rank of lieutenant. Both these<lb/> regulations are certainly a\n                great concession and an improvement<lb/> upon the <add>?</add> policy of the\n                Russians, especially the former, which<lb/> gives Israelites opportunities to attend\n                to this religions requirements. We<lb/> trust therefore that the report which has\n                reached us may be true, &amp;<lb/> we can only believe it to be so, without assuming\n                a cordial change of<lb/> policy in the Czar toward the Jews, as he acts often\n                    <sic>acts</sic> from the caprice<lb/> of the moment, as many of his <add>?</add>\n                too will demonstrate.</p>"
