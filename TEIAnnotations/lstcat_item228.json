Another may answer, to constitute a nation<lb/> the individuals must be\n                descended from one common<lb/> origin, and have a uniformity of language and\n                customs.<lb/> To a certain extent these definitions are correct; and if<lb/>\n                peradventure of any of these characteristics are wanting at<lb/> the first formation\n                of a commonwealth, the progress of<lb/> time and the changes attendant on a\n                propinquity of<lb/> races will in an incredibly short period assimilate the<lb/>\n                different parts of a state in features, manners and habits,<lb/> (unless there be\n                disturbing causes, arising from climate<lb/> and an entire diversity of pursuits,)\n                which will render<lb/> those persons who united to form a state, though very<lb/>\n                diverse themselves, the parents of a uniform and homo-<lb/>geneous race of\n                descendants. It is needless to quote<lb/> examples, since the inquiry pursued in its\n                ramifications<lb/> would carry us too far from our subject.

Now we read in the awful\n                denun-<lb/>ciation of <persName>Moses</persName> in the twenty-sixth chapter of\n                Leviticus,<lb/> that the spirit of prophecy anticipated such a state of<lb/>\n                rebellion; for he says (verse 30): “And I will destroy<lb/> your high places, and\n                cut down your images, and cast<lb/> your <sic>carcases</sic> upon the\n                    <sic>carcases</sic> of your idols, and my<lb/> soul shall abhor you;” thus\n                evidently indicating that<lb/> the direful rebellion of forgetfulness of God should\n                be<lb/> followed by signal punishment of the sinners and the<lb/> downfall of the\n                idols they should worship, and God is<lb/> represented as saying that his soul would\n                abhor the</p>\n            <p rend=\"align(center)\">2</p>"

But I will remember unto<lb/>\n                them the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought<lb/> forth from the land of\n                    <placeName>Egypt</placeName> in the sight of the heathen,<lb/> that I might be\n                their God; I am the Lord.” The sin,<lb/> the punishment, and the mercy are all here\n                recited; and<lb/> still the promise of an everlasting covenant is held out.<lb/> And\n                for what was the punishment denounced?

Not to speak\n                of the blissful promise that<lb/> our greatest sinning would not cause utter\n                rejection:<lb/> we will confine ourselves to the consideration of the<lb/> unjewish\n                doctrine that obedience to the law should not<lb/> be able to insure salvation,\n                unless something else were<lb/> to be superadded. Let us inquire of our\n                opponents,<lb/> what that something is? They will, as you all know,<lb/> tell us, it\n                is the belief in a mediator, who is to atone for<lb/> our sins, since no man is\n                righteous under the law, and<lb/> he requires a purification and a sacrificing\n                process<lb/> beyond what his own deeds can attain; and since we<lb/> in former times\n                rejected the mediator, when he is said</p>"

Can this be the God who spoke<lb/> thus through his servant:\n                “And know therefore this<lb/> day, and reflect in thy heart, that the Lord is the\n                God<lb/> in the heavens above and on the earth beneath; there is<lb/> none else”\n                (Deut. iv. 39)? Ay, “THERE IS NONE<lb/> ELSE!” these are the words, the consolatory\n                assurance<lb/> of the Most High himself. What do they mean, but<lb/> that beside the\n                Lord, <hi rend=\"italics\">the</hi> God of <placeName>Israel</placeName>, there is\n                no<lb/> being to share his power, his glory, his saving mercy?<lb/> Upon whom then\n                does the law bid us to rely for salva-<lb/>tion? The same Power who announced\n                himself to<lb/>\n                <persName>Moses</persName>, when the prophet asked what name he was to<lb/> call his\n                Sender when speaking to the Israelites, “I shall<lb/> be who I shall be;” and again,\n                “I am the everlasting<lb/> One, the God of <persName>Abraham</persName> thy father,\n                and the God of<lb/>\n                <persName>Isaac</persName>,” as was told to <persName>Jacob</persName> when reposing\n                in his pro-<lb/>phetic vision. And how was this everlasting, eternal<lb/> Being to\n                be viewed? Here again the Scriptures come<lb/> to our aid: “Hear, O\n                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>! the Lord our God, the<lb/> Lord is one,” one,\n                sole, omnipotent, working all, creat-<lb/>ing all, ruling all, and saving all. Is\n                there a possibility<lb/> of an adjunct, an associate, an assistant, a being\n                between<lb/> God and man? Again the law speaks in farther con-<lb/>firmation; the\n                prophet in his last song, delivered proba-<lb/>bly on the day of his death, foretold\n                the fearful effects of<lb/> the apostacy, which his mind's eye foresaw and\n                greatly<lb/> dreaded; he introduces the Deity as speaking, denoun-<lb/>cing\n                punishment for rebellion, and as then continuing:<lb/> “See now, that I, I alone am\n                He, and there is no god<lb/> with me, I, I kill and I bring to life, I wound and I\n                heal,<lb/> and there is no one can deliver from my hand. I lift<lb/> up my hands to\n                heaven, and say, As sure as I live for</p>"

Do we need farther<lb/> proof? then let us once more\n                refer to the unfailing<lb/> guide we have always at hand: “And the Lord will<lb/>\n                scatter you among the nations, and you shall be left<lb/> few in number among the\n                people whither the Lord will<lb/> lead you.—And if you will seek thence the Lord\n                thy<lb/> God, thou wilt find <hi rend=\"italics\">Him</hi>, if thou wilt seek Him with\n                all<lb/> thy heart and with all thy soul.” (Deut. iv. 27, 29.)—<lb/> All these\n                concurrent texts, scattered through the Penta-<lb/>teuch, explain one the other, and\n                all reject as impossible<lb/> the idea of a sacrifice beyond the person of the\n                sinner<lb/> himself; “I wound and I heal, and there is no one can<lb/> deliver from\n                my hand;” where, we would ask, is an<lb/> exception? if the Lord, the everlasting He\n                condemns,<lb/> if He wounds, who can absolve, who can heal? We<lb/> are promised\n                deliverance by returning from our evil<lb/> ways; yet whom shall we seek? again,\n                “the Lord our<lb/> God,” who announces himself as “One” and “living<lb/> for\n                ever.”</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">But, say the Nazarenes, “Your law is but a type, a<lb/>\n                foreshadowing of more glorious things that were to<lb/> follow.” Without at present\n                discussing the truth or<lb/> otherwise of this singular position, we will merely\n                con-<lb/>fine ourselves to a single remark. Admitting for a<lb/> moment the\n                impossible and not to be thought of idea,<lb/> that the unchanging God had\n                communicated a law<lb/> which in its nature was so imperfect that it required\n                to<lb/> be changed: it would still solely apply to ordinances to<lb/> be done and\n                prohibitions to be avoided, for these only<lb/> could by any chance be objects of\n                repeal or change.<lb/> Yet how does this affect the truths of revelation? Can<lb/>\n                the Lord repeal his own <sic>unchangeableness</sic>? can He</p>"

Thou—<lb/> do thou not fear, my servant\n                    <persName>Jacob</persName>, saith the Lord, for<lb/> I am with thee; for I will\n                make a full end of all the<lb/> nations whither I have driven thee, but of thee I\n                will<lb/> not make a full end; I will correct thee in judgment,<lb/> yet not suffer\n                thee to go entirely unpunished.”</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">O Lord God! indeed we know that our rebellion has<lb/> called down\n                upon us thy wrath and indignation, yet<lb/> have we not forsaken entirely thy\n                covenant, and Thou,<lb/> O our Father! hast also done according to thy promise,<lb/>\n                and not broken with us the oath Thou has sworn to<lb/> our fathers. Let our prayers\n                then ascend to Thee, and<lb/> bless the outcasts of <placeName>Israel</placeName>\n                with thy grace and peace;<lb/> and let us here in thy house welcome many, many<lb/>\n                years of reunion in heart and soul, on the day when<lb/> these doors were first\n                opened to admit the <sic>worshippers</sic><lb/> of thy name at this shrine. And let\n                none be ever</p>"
