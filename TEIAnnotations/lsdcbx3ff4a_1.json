Unfortunately,<lb/> this type of\n                    <sic>Cnazan</sic> constitutes the majority of conservative Ju-<lb/>daism.\n                Orthodoxy is an artificial, a Jesuitical thing. I am<lb/> proud to say that I spurn\n                orthodoxy, for I want the true Judaism,<lb/> such as our sages have received and\n                transmitted through the Oral<lb/> Law, and such as our children should receive, as I\n                said last <date>Sun-<lb/>day</date> at a meeting for the establishment of a Sunday\n                school. You<lb/> must admit that through the work of such people, who do nothing\n                for<lb/> the education of the children, must have as a result that Judaism<lb/> will\n                die with us. Will <persName>Pappe's</persName> children know anything about a\n                Tal-<lb/>mud? Will they know what the mitzvoth from the Torah are? Or<lb/> mitzvoth\n                of the rabbis? Is it not a great, brazenness on the part<lb/> of <sic>sucha</sic>\n                man to rely purely upon customs and to stick his head be-<lb/>tween hills and\n                mountains while the learned and righteous people<lb/> of the world in\n                    <placeName>Germany</placeName> are astonished at my work? Does he\n                under-<lb/>stand anything, even with regard to ordinary meanings of the Talmud,<lb/>\n                the Mishnah, idol-worship? Yes, I consider myself among those<lb/> about whom our\n                sages, may their memory be for a blessing, said, “All<lb/> that a good student is\n                destined to being forth as a novelty, etc.” I<lb/> insist upon holding on to the\n                old, but in order to save something<lb/> from the shipwreck which may at all\n                possibly be saved, I shall, if</p>"

These people do not know and\n                do not understand what it<lb/> means, “Desecrate one <date>Sabbath</date> in order\n                that you may be able to observe<lb/> many <date>Sabbaths</date>”.

Is it not a great, brazenness on the part<lb/> of <sic>sucha</sic>\n                man to rely purely upon customs and to stick his head be-<lb/>tween hills and\n                mountains while the learned and righteous people<lb/> of the world in\n                    <placeName>Germany</placeName> are astonished at my work?

If you do understand how to accomplish<lb/> much, it does\n                not seem to be on the practical side. Unfortunately,<lb/> the statement of the great\n                    <persName>Rabba</persName> is not sufficiently well-known.<lb/> “He who forgoes\n                his own qualities, all his sins are removed.”</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">When people who do not know the words of our sages, mis-<lb/>take\n                the unessential for the essential„ I do not hold it against them.<lb/> They know no\n                better. It is preferable that they should hold on to<lb/> the unessential in order\n                that he essential should not be forgotten.<lb/> But when one sees that the important\n                ones of <placeName>Israel</placeName> throw the Torah<lb/> overboard and maintain\n                silly customs only for the sake of gain, only<lb/> to act hypocritically, then one\n                must weep for the destruction of our<lb/> holy Torah. These people do not know and\n                do not understand what it<lb/> means, “Desecrate one <date>Sabbath</date> in order\n                that you may be able to observe<lb/> many <date>Sabbaths</date>”. I can tell you for\n                your own satisfaction, you, the<lb/> Portuguese who has cast aside the comments of\n                    <persName>Rabbi Moses Isserlein</persName><lb/> (RaMA) which are holy to me,\n                that in my small community, <hi rend=\"underline\">Emunei Israel</hi>,<lb/> I have had\n                recited the counting of the <hi rend=\"underline\">Omer</hi>.... on the other hand,\n                I<lb/> insist that there be no idle conversation, no business talk, and such<lb/>\n                like.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">I will not say about myself that I have a fuller insight</p>"
