I shall make no apology to trouble you with\n                a further communication—perhaps<lb/> a long one on this same subject, as I desire\n                you should know all particulars, and I honestly tell you<lb/> that not only have I\n                no objection that you should inform <persName>Mr L</persName> what I say in reply to\n                his last to you<lb/> but I am quite content he should read every word following.\n                This letter may be seen by one or by a thousand<lb/> I care not, for every one may\n                know that I have, and am again ready to aver in the most solemn manner, yes,<lb/> in\n                the name of God who made me, that I never sought to injure <persName>Mr L</persName>\n                with his congregation—that to the best of my<lb/> judgment I never did or said\n                anything to lessen his success &amp; promote my own—that I never had any desire to\n                supplant<lb/> him in his situation whilst I thought he stood the least chance of\n                retaining it—that it was only with others<lb/> I desired to contest it, and that\n                throughout I entertained for him none but sentiments of kindness &amp;\n                sympathy—<lb/> how I would not &amp; could not write or say this much for a brother\n                or a father did I trust know it was truth—I flatter<lb/> myself I need not assure\n                you of this. I do not say that a more <hi rend=\"underline\">experienced</hi> person\n                would not have acted differently<lb/> but I do not truthfully say that none could\n                have acted with more honesty of purpose, and under the former im-<lb/>pressions that\n                after the protracted &amp; serious dissensions between <persName>Mr L</persName>\n                &amp; his congr. I could do him no injury to<lb/> act as I did. These are\n                protestations, say, but took at the facts.</p>\n            <p>As you know I have been in correspondence with <persName>Mr L</persName> since my\n                arrival in this country <date>Jany. '47</date>. I need not look<lb/> back to\n                    <persName>Mr L's</persName> earlier letters but it is now some 18 months since\n                he told me he was not popular (generally with<lb/> his flock &amp; that his\n                re-election was by no means sure. The publication of his strictures on his cong. in\n                the Oc. <date>October 49</date><lb/> the action taken by them thereupon certainly\n                would not be calculated to Open the breach. In a lengthy letter from<lb/>\n                <persName>Mr L</persName> dated <date>Oct 49</date> I have the full history of his\n                Ministry in <placeName>Phil.</placeName> To that date. In this letter <persName>Mr\n                    L</persName> speaks of the unmerited<lb/> &amp; powerful persecution he had\n                experienced from his opponents—of the impossibility of getting two thirds of\n                the<lb/> votes necessary for the <hi rend=\"underline\">repeal of the bond\n                law</hi>—under which condition only, <persName>Mr L</persName> writes as indeed he\n                had publicly<lb/> printed in the Oc. he would take office. “As I will not sign a\n                contract such as was offered there is only the<lb/> alternative of <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">withdrawing fighting to the last</hi>.” Again, he says he\n                cannot &amp; will not yield one point, &amp; scorns<lb/> the <sic>adjunta's</sic>\n                vote of censure. It is unnecessary to quote other paragraphs from this letter\n                expressive of the same<lb/> determination. Thus already some 15 months ago\n                    <persName>Mr L</persName> spared me of his determining not to yield to the\n                congre-<lb/>gational terms, and so long ago had Is<add>?</add> all the world learnt\n                through the Oc. That the congn. had determined not to<lb/> yield to <persName>Mr\n                    L's</persName> demands—witness the rejection by them of the new bye-law for\n                Hazan, offered by <persName>Mr S Solis</persName>, and<lb/> the motion to do away\n                with the bond, which latter motion they had uniformly rejected on all other\n                occasions<lb/> &amp; by large majorities, as I learn from <persName>Mr\n                    C's</persName> letters. On <date>16 Octr.</date>, my earliest leisure, in reply\n                to <persName>Mr I.</persName> I took the liberty<lb/> to censure the article in the\n                    <date>Octr</date> Occident, plainly telling him that I thought he had done\n                exceedingly wrong to hold all<lb/> his cong. to the severe<add>?</add> ridicule of\n                the world—that he had thereby laid himself under the imputation of attempting<lb/>\n                to gain by threats what he could not by persuasion &amp; argument or influence (This\n                was not the language of one desiring him Evil)<lb/> And with respect to the bond I\n                said that all with whom I had discussed the matter agreed that in <persName>Mr\n                    L's</persName> case he being<lb/> known to them 20 years, that it was uncalled\n                for &amp; wrong though in the case of a stranger (or newcomer) the cong would<lb/>\n                be justified to ask it, though even there the candidates simply subscribing a\n                declaration of willingness to be governed<lb/> by existing by-laws would be\n                preferable. I have referred to this circumstance at length because when in\n                    <placeName>Phil.</placeName> I was<lb/> told I believe (but am not sure) by\n                    <persName>Mr S Solis</persName> but it matters not <hi rend=\"underline\">by</hi>\n                whom that he had heard (from whom he did not say) that I had written <persName>Mr\n                    L</persName> advising him not to sign the<lb/> bond it being beneath the dignity\n                of a minister so to do (so as to get him out of the way I suppose!) but when I had\n                    sense<add>?</add> of <persName>Mr L's</persName> absence from candidateship\n                hereby I<lb/> turned round and was willing to do it myself. A very pretty charge to\n                do me injury, but false as Christianity. A concoction<lb/> worthy the most rascally\n                Jesuit around us. I am glad to know however that it did not; or could not, injure\n                me<lb/> with so right-minded a person as <persName>Mr Solis</persName> to whom I\n                know I explained the matter though cannot be sure whether<lb/> I broached it to him.\n                The truth is as above. But a little more about this <add>?</add>. I never said I\n                would sign the<lb/> bond. If elected I would ask to be excused as I do not admire\n                it—but would not refuse signing if the retention<lb/> of the place depended upon it\n                    (<del>mind</del> I speak of myself as a new comer) for I would not have the\n                power of it<lb/>\n                <persName>Mr L</persName>\n                <hi rend=\"underline\">now</hi> has. If I signed it I should be doing nothing worse\n                than <persName>Mr L</persName> had himself done on several occasions.<lb/> The bond\n                I maintain degrades the congregation not the minister. There are many abuses in one\n                synagogue government<lb/> which a Hazan must at present submit to. What if a Parnass\n                    <hi rend=\"underline\">orders</hi> a Hazan to call up to read to the Sepher a<lb/>\n                man notoriously <add>?</add>. Could <persName>Mr L</persName> or any other Hazan\n                refuse—he might get off doing so by his influence over<lb/> the Parnass. I could\n                point out to you many cases wherein <persName>Mr L</persName> according to the\n                present system must<lb/> submit to his <hi rend=\"underline\">rulers</hi> in matters\n                of much greater importance than signing the bond and I could show you</p>"

But to continue\n                with my letter<lb/> In conclusion I advise <persName>Mr L</persName> to take special\n                care what he did &amp; above all not to write anything in his Oc. about<lb/> his\n                cong. something as absurd the idea that he should put with them because of this bond\n                business when in '41 (I believe)<lb/> the same thing occurred as you are perhaps\n                aware and <persName>Mr L</persName>\n                <del>signed</del> contrived by a <hi rend=\"underline\">ruse</hi> which he afterwards\n                regretted, to satisfy<lb/> them. In this letter I also offered to confer with you on\n                the matter for <persName>Mr L's</persName> benefit, not doubting you would do all\n                you<lb/> could in his behalf &amp; asked him permission to do so. On <date>3<hi\n                        rend=\"sup\">rd</hi> Dec</date>\n                <persName>Mr L</persName> sends me copy of intended by law tells me your\n                interference<lb/> would be useless, &amp; that any would be unpalatable to him. On\n                    <date>March 27, 1850</date>, <persName>Mr L</persName> writes me “the die is at\n                length<lb/> cast &amp; the congregation have resolved to advertise for a successor,\n                after having endorsed the vote of censure of the Adjunta<lb/> &amp; refusing to\n                repeal the bond law—appointing salary &amp; term of office for the successor.\n                    (<persName>Mr L</persName> does not write me he wanted<lb/> a life term of\n                office) on hearing of this fatal &amp; decisive step I wrote <persName>Mr\n                    L</persName> (<date>9 April 1850</date>) expressing my surprise<lb/> &amp;\n                regret at this intelligence, stating candidly however that I did not think this\n                determination was come to by<lb/> the congregation because of the bond &amp;c but\n                because “their spirit was not with him” i. e. that they did not care for him<lb/>\n                and I as candidly intimated (also by a Hebrew <add>?</add>) that the breach was past\n                healing, but to prove my esteem<lb/> I would, <hi rend=\"underline\">did he\n                    concur</hi>, get up a memorial (with <persName>Rev S M Isaacs</persName>) to be\n                signed by the Jewish ministry generally<lb/> in his favor, I also asked him to point\n                out to me how I could be of use to him. This letter brings up our\n                corres-<lb/>pondence on this subject to about 2 months before the day appointed for\n                election (viz <date>16. June</date>) And here let me ask you<lb/> whether it is\n                strange I should begin to think that <persName>Mr L's</persName> chance of\n                reconciliation or reelection was becoming<lb/> more &amp; more desperate (If I\n                mistake not you were of opinion that <persName>Mr L</persName> would not have the\n                least chance after his<lb/> article in <date>October</date> Occident) when in almost\n                every letter for about 2 years he had told me so himself! Is it strange<lb/> I\n                should entertain this idea when he more than once had told me the power of his\n                enemies was too great to allow<lb/> him to suppose he would ever gain the 2/3rds he\n                required to carry his measures, when he had informed the public that<lb/> he would\n                not take the place but on his own terms, &amp; when they had also assured the public\n                through the press<lb/> that he should not have it but on theirs &amp; by asking for\n                others to fill the office (in their advertisement) showed that they cared not\n                for<lb/> him to remain—when I knew he must either disgrace himself by giving the lie\n                to his public &amp; private protestations<lb/> or stoop to the congregation (&amp; I\n                had too high an opinion of his honesty to suppose he would do either) and when<lb/>\n                I could not but know that the cong would not yield to him, as they had always &amp;\n                uniformly upheld the bond<lb/> and when I viewed in conjunction with all this the\n                continually increasing bad feeling between <persName>Mr L</persName> &amp; his\n                flock<lb/> his strictures, their votes of censure &amp; determined opposition the\n                former not trifles to a man of spirit, was I<lb/> so wrong in thinking <persName>Mr\n                    L</persName> stood little or no chance of again occupying his old position. And\n                could I desire his<lb/> injury let me also ask when I strongly advised him not to\n                make the press the vehicle for his complaints<lb/> to be careful that he gave his\n                enemies no farther advantage over him by losing temper &amp;c. Thus far I think even<lb/>\n                <persName>Mr L</persName> will admit that I have acted aright &amp; that my\n                conclusions were by no means unnatural. To return On<lb/>\n                <date>22<hi rend=\"sup\">nd</hi> April</date> I received <persName>Mr L's</persName>\n                reply dated <date>18<hi rend=\"sup\">th</hi></date>. He would permit my combining with\n                    <persName>Isaacs</persName> &amp;c for the memorial “but<lb/> he knew it would\n                be of no avail the influence on the other side being too great.” On the <date>23<hi\n                        rend=\"sup\">rd</hi></date> the day I received <persName>Mr<lb/>\n                    L's</persName> letter I addressed <persName>Mr Isaacs</persName> stating the\n                case &amp; my conviction that “a respectfully worded memorial” I quote from my<lb/>\n                letter to <persName>Mr I.</persName> “to be written by you &amp; signed by all of\n                us” would do good, inviting him to take the initiative thinking<lb/> that both from\n                age character &amp; influence he and not I was the man, &amp; because he was\n                    <del>more</del> intimate with more<lb/> ministers than I. I received\n                    <persName>Mr I's</persName> reply dated <date>26 April</date>. I omitted to\n                state that <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> in his letter of <date>10</date>\n                <add>?</add> me<lb/> that <add>?</add> I had already offered his services as\n                mediator which he declined as useless but made no objection to a<lb/> combined\n                action. <persName>Mr I</persName> however in this letter stated that it would now be\n                perfectly useless. He writes<lb/> “I would gladly co-operate could <del>I</del> we\n                achieve any good but knowing that none can be effected our time is<lb/> too valuable\n                &amp;c” Does this answer <persName>Mr Leeser's</persName> charge that instead of\n                attempting to make peace I was getting<lb/> up certificates” I have asked for no\n                certificates up to this date. After such dampers from <persName>Messrs\n                    Leeser</persName> &amp; <persName>Isaacs</persName><lb/> I thought it useless to\n                persevere, and am of opinion now that I thought rightly. The same post that\n                brought<lb/> me <persName>Mr Isaacs</persName> letter brought me several\n                communication from <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, informing me among other\n                things<lb/> that <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> had publicly stated I was the only\n                person competent to succeed him (In my ignorance I thought,<lb/> that <persName>Mr\n                    L</persName> not being willing longer to remain, was believed the curtain\n                    <del>doing all he</del> recommending me)—again<lb/> that a large portion of the\n                members desired me to apply—that certain parties had declared themselves my\n                suppor-<lb/>ters, and though there would be other candidates (one was already\n                however even if he had not applied viz <persName>Ellis Lyon</persName>)<lb/> still\n                “there was none on the continent of <placeName>America</placeName> to oppose me.”\n                    <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> laughs at the idea of <persName>Mr\n                    Lyons</persName><lb/> standing any chance of success. But I who have seen much\n                more important congregations than <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName><lb/> choose a\n                    <add>?</add> because he had a fine voice did not think <persName>Mr\n                    Lyons</persName> so laughable an opponent especially<lb/> as I heard he had\n                family influence in <placeName>Phil</placeName>, which my ignorance then\n                exaggerated, and I also know that his</p>"

A member of my<lb/> congregation also had received a letter from\n                his friends in <placeName>Phil</placeName> stating the same things. He showed me the\n                letter I saw I<lb/> must apply without loss of time. I communicated with all my\n                friends here (you &amp; <persName>Mrs Joseph</persName> were then<lb/> absent from\n                    <placeName>Montreal</placeName>, and one &amp; all advised me as he had\n                done—ridiculing any objections. They said “<persName>Mr Leeser</persName><lb/>\n                <sic>cant</sic> be so unreasonable as to find fault with you ( I did not say that he\n                would, at me remark <hi rend=\"underline\">en parenthese</hi>)<lb/> for seeking for a\n                situation he cannot &amp; will not longer hold.

I confess it was not without its effect on me. But what\n                had greater effect on me was<lb/>\n                <persName>Mr L's</persName> letter of <date>10<hi rend=\"sup\">th</hi> April</date>\n                already referred to as that wherein he gives me leave to combine with\n                    <persName>Isaacs</persName> for the memorial. He (<persName>Mr\n                L</persName>)<lb/> commences by telling me that all my efforts would be useless in\n                his behalf as far as his ministry is concerned, he could<lb/> not <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">imagine the possibility of his being elected on terms agreeable\n                    to himself</hi> (and yet, let me here remark in his last<lb/> letter to you he\n                says as much that I am the other candidates <del>were</del> the cause of his not\n                being elected. What had I staid<lb/> away—another would have come forward. To\n                suppose that none would (who perhaps did not care one <add>?</add> for <add>?</add>)\n                is<lb/> childish &amp; absurd But before any one had any idea of coming forward\n                    <persName>Mr L</persName> plainly says he cannot imagine the possibility of his\n                reelection on his terms. This being the case <persName>Mr L</persName> waited he\n                owed it to his character both as a man &amp; a Jew <hi rend=\"underline\">to retire\n                    to</hi><lb/>\n                <hi rend=\"underline\">private life</hi>. Again says <persName>Mr L.</persName> “<hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">My engagement is precluded by the wording of the\n                    advertisement</hi>.” Now my firm impression<lb/> from the forgoing was (as it\n                would have been I think of every <sic>imprejudiced</sic> person that <persName>Mr.\n                    L</persName> seeing he stood no<lb/> chance of success gave up the contest, and\n                that with the great encouragement held out to me, and the persuasions of<lb/> my\n                friends—honest thinking men too, I was now fully justified in doing what I heard\n                    <persName>Mr Lyons</persName> &amp; others had already<lb/> done or was caring\n                to do—and apply for the office—informing <persName>Mr L.</persName> thereof at the\n                same time. But I will tell you<lb/> what I did presently. If I had any doubts as to\n                the hopelessness of <persName>Mr Leesers</persName> cause the anonymous pamphlet which<lb/>\n                <persName>Dr David</persName> and I received (on <date>20<hi rend=\"sup\">th</hi>\n                    April</date>) would have dispelled them. I would most assuredly, not at all\n                refer to this pamphlet but that<lb/> it contains extracts of the minutes of the\n                Cong. the truthfulness of which none has challenged. From these minutes I<lb/>\n                learned what <persName>Mr L</persName> had never informed me—that in addition to the\n                insurmountable obstacle of the bond, there<lb/> were other difficulties equally\n                insurmountable (as the votes showed). <persName>Mr L</persName> had declared at the\n                meeting of <date>24 March/50</date><lb/> through <persName>Mr A Hart</persName> that\n                unless the tenure of office was during good behaviour (for life) <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">he would not be a candidate</hi>, but<lb/> would remain 6\n                months after expiration of his present term to afford the cong. an opportunity to\n                get a successor not<lb/> withstanding which <hi rend=\"underline\">the cong settled\n                    the term at 10 years</hi>. Now would I be wrong in concluding from this\n                circumstance<lb/> what <persName>Mr L</persName> himself wrote me “It was evident to\n                me,” he says with reference to this meeting not this particular vote,<lb/> that my\n                dismissal from office was resolved on. So I thought. The particulars of the term of\n                office discussion<lb/> I did not learn from <persName>Mr Leeser</persName>. Now I\n                could not think so ill of <persName>Mr L</persName> as to suppose that he would act\n                contrary<lb/> to his declaration at the meeting &amp; accept 10 years, nor did I\n                think, knowing that a large majority (including some who did<lb/> not ever to insist\n                upon the bond as I afterwards heard) had determined <hi rend=\"underline\">not to\n                    grant</hi> the life tenure, such having<lb/> been the policy of the Kahal, as I\n                learn from the extracts of the minutes; ever since they first had a regular\n                Hazan<lb/> because as they assert (<date>Nov/42</date>) “a frequent occurrence to\n                the election of their officers is the best check upon them.” I do<lb/> not desire to\n                bear me the apologist of this assertion, but that such is the opinion of the\n                majority of the <placeName>Phil.</placeName> Cong. I <sic>dont</sic><lb/> this\n                moment sincerely believe. And in the very first letter received from <persName>Mr A\n                    Hart</persName> he informs me that in the event<lb/> of our <persName>Mr\n                    L's</persName> not being a candidate (Let <persName>Mr L</persName> know that\n                others besides me could use this expression) on <date>16 June</date> they would<lb/>\n                reduce the term of office probably to 3 years. From all this I become convinced that\n                    <persName>Mr L</persName> stood not the least chance<lb/> of election\n                (especially as the cong would not, as he wrote me, “even hear him in his defence”) I\n                also thought I had a<lb/> chance of being chosen—and that if I did not apply other\n                persons—whitewashed Germans—would, leaving <persName>Lyons</persName><lb/> out of\n                the question. Events prove my conjecture right. <persName>Mr Rosenfeld</persName> no\n                doubt a learned &amp; estimable man—but still<lb/> as much a Portuguese Hazan as I\n                am a German—has read as candidate in the synagogue Mikveh Israel (so I hear.) In\n                his<lb/> letter of <date>10<hi rend=\"sup\">th</hi> April</date> I must not omit to\n                state <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> told me he was then going (in the course of the\n                week) to <placeName>New Orleans</placeName> and that it was “likely<lb/> enough that\n                before my answer could reach him he would have left <placeName>Phila.</placeName>”\n                He said moreover he could not call at<lb/>\n                <placeName>Montreal</placeName> as he had intended but would hasten to be back by\n                the day of election. On <date>23<hi rend=\"sup\">rd</hi> April</date> immediately\n                on<lb/> receipt of <persName>Mr L's</persName> of <date>10<hi rend=\"sup\"\n                    >th</hi></date> I addressed <persName>Mr L</persName> directing one letter to\n                    <placeName>Savannah</placeName> &amp; <placeName>New Orleans</placeName> (he had\n                supplied me on <date>10<hi rend=\"sup\">th</hi></date> with<lb/> these addresses)\n                    <del>in care<persName> J I</persName>\n                    <add>?</add>\n                </del> as <persName>Mr L</persName> might have left <placeName>Phil</placeName>\n                before he could receive my letter. If you recollect<lb/> you sent me a slip of paper\n                it came with the Oc. Whereon <persName>Mr L</persName> tells you he was not going\n                yet, <del>?</del> for a few days. I believe<lb/> then it was a couple of\n                days—perhaps one—after I had written <persName>Mr L</persName> to <placeName>N.\n                    O.</placeName>—where you sent me the slip. <del>?</del> I then<lb/> wrote\n                another letter to <placeName>Phil</placeName> thinking it might reach him before he\n                left. I don't know the date of this<lb/> as it contained pretty much what I wrote in\n                the one to <placeName>N. O.</placeName> I did not keep a copy of it. Both letters\n                were<lb/> written in the desire not to do anything without <persName>Mr\n                    L's</persName> knowledge, &amp; so, afterwards, I would not have moved<lb/> a\n                single step without his knowledge &amp; he might have guided me for his advantage,\n                but that—he would not.<lb/> In these letters I told <persName>Mr L</persName> that I\n                was convinced now that his connection with his congregation would be<lb/> at last\n                severed. In this case I had determined I told <persName>Mr L</persName> to\n                    <del>take</del> adopt the advice of my friends &amp; to write (which<lb/> I did\n                by the same post which took <persName>Mr L's</persName> letter) to <persName>Mr\n                    Hart</persName> acquainting him with my desire to be<lb/> considered a candidate\n                for the office <hi rend=\"underline\">in case <persName>Mr L</persName> was not &amp;\n                    only in such case</hi>. <persName>Mr L</persName> says in his last letter</p>"

That he thinks me<lb/> capable of hating him in my heart &amp; doing him all\n                the mischief I can I infer from his gratuitous remarks<lb/>\n                <hi rend=\"underline\">Perhaps if <persName>Mr De S.</persName> had written that\n                    anonymous pamphlet &amp;c</hi>” <del>I ask</del> “he would have gained the\n                influence<lb/> of <persName>Mr Phillips</persName>. Let me say in justice to the\n                    <persName>Messrs Phillips</persName> that not one of them spoke to me\n                disrespectfully<lb/> or angrily of <persName>Mr Leeser</persName>, or entered into\n                any details as to what had passed between him &amp; his congregation. They<lb/> said\n                nothing more severe of <persName>Mr L</persName>, &amp; I think not so much as his\n                best friends did. But to return, <persName>Mr L's</persName><lb/> friends <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">were not able</hi> to carry for <persName>Mr L</persName> on\n                    <date>16 June</date> what he wanted.

So\n                now he would have voted for the repeal of the bond law would not be willing<lb/> to\n                grant a life term of office. Some voted thinking <persName>Mr L.</persName> observed\n                at least the compliment of being<lb/> elected, since he declared he would not submit\n                to the conditions—in short this majority were much divided<lb/> in opinion &amp; had\n                they elected <persName>Mr L</persName> it would have amounted to nothing. Had they\n                all been content to give<lb/>\n                <persName>Mr L</persName> all he asked what prevented them electing him &amp; then\n                altering the terms to suit. But instead of<lb/> postponing because of the threats of\n                certain members withdrawing, they subscribed because it was impossible<lb/> to\n                obtain two thirds of the votes for repeal of the bond which first of all\n                    <persName>Mr L</persName> required. I am warranted in this<lb/> assertion by the\n                assurance of many and by communications received from some of <persName>Mr\n                    L's</persName> staunchest supporters<lb/>\n                <persName>Mr L</persName> has therefore deceived himself as to the true cause of his\n                want of success on <date>16 June</date>.<del>probably</del> In his<lb/> last letter\n                to you he says the reason of his new success was that “as others applied, the\n                congregation<lb/> thought his remarks were founded in mere caprice and hence would\n                not grant them.” <persName>Mr L</persName> does not<lb/> say much here for the\n                strength of mind &amp; penetration of the meeting of <date>12 June</date> thus to be\n                    influenced.<hi rend=\"underline\"> And</hi> I<lb/>\n                <hi rend=\"underline\">cannot at all reconcile</hi> this assertion of <persName>Mr\n                    L</persName> with his former assertions to me that he knew his dismissal<lb/>\n                from office was resolved upon, &amp; that he could not imagine the possibility of\n                being re elected on terms<lb/> agreeable to himself <hi rend=\"underline\">as he wrote\n                    me long before I or anyone elected applied</hi>. Nor can I quite reconcile it\n                with<lb/> his former assertion in this his last letter to you that it was “<hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">in consequence of the threats</hi> &amp; false<lb/>\n                representations of “certain parties that he failed. Now today that <persName>Mr\n                    L's</persName> friends sacrificed him because<lb/> of the threats of withdrawal\n                is to say that they acted with gross stupidity for they must have known<lb/> they\n                would have to sacrifice him for the same reason in <date>April</date> when too those\n                of <persName>Mr L's</persName> opponents<lb/> who could not be present in\n                    <date>June</date> would probably then attend. Therefore it seems improbably they\n                should<lb/> have voted with the others on this account. <persName>Mr L</persName>\n                can rest no proof of the truth of his suspicion than the<lb/> reason for postponing\n                is what he says because this statement in the <date>Nov.</date> Oc. remains\n                    <sic>uncontradicted</sic><lb/> who should contradict it?

And so, I solemnly assert, I <add>?</add><lb/>\n                For had <persName>Mr L</persName> said do this I would have done it—do that, &amp;\n                it should have been executed.<lb/> Even supposing for a moment that I was the first\n                candidate in the field <hi rend=\"underline\">which I was not</hi><lb/> is it possible\n                    <persName>Mr L</persName> could believe that <persName role=\"author\">Abraham De\n                    Sola</persName> had not applied, <persName>Rosenfeld</persName>\n                <persName>Lyons</persName><lb/>\n                <persName>Morais</persName> or others would not have done so. And he himself admits\n                that there was or is a party<lb/> desiring <persName>Mr Allan</persName>. As\n                    <persName>Mr L</persName> says so say I, They <del>did not</del> opposed\n                (covertly perhaps I may add) <persName>Mr<lb/> Leeser</persName>, so that\n                    <persName>Mick Allan</persName> ought ultimately be appointed. (<hi\n                    rend=\"underline\"><add>?</add> a son <add>?</add></hi>) Hence had<lb/>\n                <persName>A. D. S.</persName> not been there <persName>M. Allan</persName> would.\n                    <persName>Mr L</persName> also states to you he knew beforehand that<lb/> I\n                should not succeed would be the result of my application. It would have been more\n                candid in <persName>Mr L</persName> had he told <del>me</del> this before I\n                went<lb/> to <placeName>Phila.</placeName> And if <persName>Mr L</persName> knew\n                this before hand he cannot with any justice say that I had <add>?</add> not<lb/>\n                come forward he would have conquered—for a fact favor the fact that others were in\n                the field before me<lb/> &amp; therefore left me no choice unless I would see some\n                one besides <persName>Mr L</persName> or myself in the office—<lb/> —if the cong had\n                determined what the issue should be, why I nor any other candidate could<lb/>\n                control it. That my friends in <placeName>England</placeName> should ask\n                    <persName>Mr A Franklin</persName> to support my claims will not<lb/> seem\n                unnatural to many—but they were not so like led<add>?</add> or advised to do so by\n                me. And this leads<lb/> me to say how deeply indignant I felt at <persName>Mr\n                    L's</persName> insinuations (since <sic>learnt</sic>) that I supplied<lb/> the\n                Jewish papers with the various paragraphs headed\n                <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>. I solemnly assert<lb/> and defy contradiction\n                that to the Jewish Chronicle I never sent a line since the election,<lb/> was first\n                talked of, nor to the Asmonean either. I challenge either editor to say I have<lb/>\n                But let <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> claim what his false friend so unjustly\n                    aspersed<add>?</add> really did do, though<lb/> he never boasted of any well\n                intentioned act performed by him for <persName>Mr L.</persName> I should not have\n                mentioned<lb/> this but for the charge against me. <persName>Mr Lyons</persName>\n                wrote me when starting his paper, asking me more<lb/> than once to support it and\n                write for it. Attached to the Occident however I would not write for<lb/> it, and so\n                wrote <persName>Mr L</persName>, I have since altered my determination because young\n                    <persName>Mr Allan</persName> who is as<lb/> one of the agents for the Asmonean\n                in <placeName>Phil</placeName> told me <persName>Mr L</persName> had mentioned to\n                him (what I wrote in<lb/> confidence to <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> respecting my\n                intention not to write for the Asmonean <del>the Asmonean</del>. Moreover,\n                    <persName>Mr Lyons</persName> has behaved with such extreme<lb/> politeness,\n                both in respect to sending me the paper <add>?</add>lously, that I may wait for\n                it<lb/> and on several occasions that I feel bound to make some return to him. But\n                without<lb/> further digression, the very day after I received the anonymous\n                pamphlet <date>21 April</date> I wrote <persName>Mr Lyons</persName> that I<lb/> had\n                received it—that no doubt a paper war would now cause but I entreated him for\n                the<lb/> sake of all parties to close his columns to any &amp; every communication\n                on the subject of the election<lb/> as it would be a disgrace (<add>חלול השם</add>)\n                that his <add>?</add> readers should become acquainted with<lb/> these internal\n                dissensions. I said he would not regret granting my request but that hereafter\n                he<lb/> would see cause to congratulate himself upon his moderation when he saw what\n                anarchy<lb/> had been thereby avoided. In reply <persName>Mr Lyons</persName> writes\n                me “Your letter requesting me to <sic>withold</sic><lb/> from publishing any remarks\n                upon the emente<add>?</add> between the <placeName>Phil</placeName> Cong &amp;\n                    <persName>Mr L</persName> did not reach me except the short<lb/> notice of the\n                pamphlet alluded to was in <add>?</add>, but it was so guardedly worded that\n                not<lb/> the slightest inference could be drawn by parties not knowing of the\n                publication of the <add>?</add><lb/> as to what the Asmonean alluded. <persName>Mr\n                    L</persName> adds that altho' he owed nothing to <persName>Mr Leeser</persName>\n                for courtesy<lb/> in ushering the Asmonean before the Jewish public, <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">still he would not suffer private</hi></p>"

I have made this communication so very long that I feel I<lb/> am\n                trespassing on your kindness &amp; should conclude. Still I must ask leave to touch\n                briefly upon a<lb/> few more subjects requiring notice. When in\n                    <placeName>Phila</placeName> I sought not to do, what is usual for candidates\n                to<lb/> do under the present wrong system—to canvass the Cong. I went these avowedly\n                to qualify myself as a candidate<lb/> by reading <hi rend=\"underline\">once</hi>\n                &amp; preaching in the Syng again. To <add>?</add> I would not defend, hence apart\n                from suffering<lb/> from slight indisposition I read with less gusto than I would on\n                an ordinary <date>Sabbath</date> here. I did not conceal<lb/> why I went—hence I\n                plainly told them in Synagogue what my intents of the office were &amp; how I\n                would<lb/> discharge them should I ever be their Minister. Some comprehensive minded\n                individuals and being<lb/> of course very unprejudiced thought I reflect on\n                    <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> because I said it was the duty of a Minister<lb/>\n                to visit his flock, which <persName>Mr L.</persName> usually did not, and which I\n                knew at the time I was speaking<lb/> as the dog who now sits at my feet does.\n                    Haugh<add>?</add>! Fortunately people are not all equally thin skinned<lb/> But\n                having read once I resisted all importunities (which were not a few) both of my new\n                found friends<lb/> and <persName>Mr L's</persName> supporters also (<persName>Mr S\n                    Solis</persName> also advised my reading again) and to the disappointment\n                of<lb/> many I would not read or preach again, but left <placeName>Phil</placeName>\n                just in time to go to <persName><sic>Lyn</sic></persName> in <placeName>N.\n                    York</placeName> on<lb/>\n                <date>Friday</date> Evening—That I did not do myself justice hereby I know just as\n                my friends told me, for the<lb/> times are so very different form the\n                    <placeName>London</placeName> Minhag which we here follow for other\n                reasons—but<lb/> enough, I paid <add>?</add> to those hospitable friends who made my\n                stay in <placeName>Phil</placeName> so pleasant—went<lb/> to see Girard College.\n                Fine arts exhibition, &amp; some of the lions of the Quaker-city, and left to make a\n                few<lb/> days stay in <placeName>N. York</placeName> where I had not yet been able\n                to stay to see my many friends there. Even from <placeName>N. Y</placeName><lb/> I\n                hurriedly departed. I wanted to get back to my charge &amp; my books. As far as my\n                interests were concerned I made<lb/> a careless stay in\n                    <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>. But no matter let me conclude my notice of\n                    <persName>Mr <sic>Leesers</sic></persName> letter. I made no<lb/> assertion to\n                    <persName>Mr S Solis</persName> that the above or what else I could say\n                    <del>what</del> would I justify. <persName>Mr L</persName> writes he was\n                Hazan<lb/> till <date>27<hi rend=\"sup\">th</hi> Septr</date> and it would been time\n                enough (for me) to apply when he had withdrawn. But did <persName>Mr L.</persName>\n                consider when he<lb/> wrote this. The election was fixed for <date>16<hi rend=\"sup\"\n                        >th</hi> June</date>, 3 months before <persName>Mr. L</persName> time\n                expired. An application in <date>September</date> I might<lb/> naturally conclude\n                would meet with the answer. Sir you are three months too late. We have appointed one\n                who applied at the<lb/> time we advertised. “then” writes <persName>Mr L</persName>,\n                my influence would have been at his disposal. Would it have been too much in\n                    <persName>Mr L</persName><lb/>\n                <add>?</add> was, till my application, my true friend writing to me, (after stating\n                as he had that he had no hope of election) Do you apply<lb/> when my term is\n                expired, &amp; my influence shall be at your 'disposal.” I of course, felt the\n                absence of so friendly an act. <persName>Mr Leeser</persName><lb/> writes I was\n                “desirous' to get his place (<del>?</del> &amp; at the same time <add>?</add> to\n                retain his good opinion. “but adds <persName>ML</persName>”<lb/> this was\n                impossible” Why so, I ask, I did not make or in my way promote the state of ill\n                feeling between <persName>Mr L</persName><lb/> &amp; his congregation. It was not\n                through my influence that the Cong. outvoted <persName>Mr L</persName> (for he says\n                their conduct<lb/> amounted to depriving him of his office) Why should <persName>Mr\n                    L</persName> have formed a bad opinion of me because I was desirous<lb/> of\n                having what he would not. <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> does not say I have same\n                against him past forgiveness, I solemnly<lb/> assert that I never sinned against him\n                at a “<del>with</del> in thought, and if I did in deed, it is unknown to me.<lb/>\n                This will be my unchangeable conviction” till my last hour, I do not say I may not\n                have unintentionally<lb/> erred in one or two trivial matters, but for the life of\n                me I cannot see, after <add>?</add> all I have done<lb/> not now only but a\n                    <add>?</add> times, I cannot at all see that I did him any serious harm. I\n                am<lb/> convinced that had I never lived <persName>Mr L</persName> would not in\n                consequence have been restored. This has been my<lb/> conviction since <date>October\n                    1849</date>—a sorrowful one it was, and truly sorry am I even now to know\n                it.<lb/> I can in all truth say I had rather see <persName>Mr Leeser</persName>\n                retain his situation, than that I should be elected<lb/> or any other divine man\n                chosen. “But I must acknowledge,” continues <persName>Mr L</persName>, “that I have\n                been greatly disappointed<lb/> in <del>him</del>\n                <persName>Mr. R. S.</persName>” But have I had no cause to be disappointed in\n                    <persName>Mr L.</persName> I am sure I have. Let me read one<lb/> most trifling\n                circumstance only, and I am strongly of opinion, unless I am even to a greater\n                extent mistaken,<lb/> that <persName>Mr L</persName> will admit, he would not have\n                so acted in a cool moment.

But let me <del>?</del><lb/> refer briefly to this\n                article. <persName>Mr L</persName> says “<persName>Mr Rosenfeld</persName> we\n                understand only applied in case the present<lb/> minister was not a candidate.” Is\n                it possible <persName>Mr L's</persName> informant did not tell him that on the<lb/>\n                <date><hi rend=\"underline\">16<hi rend=\"sup\">th</hi> of June</hi></date> the day\n                appointed for the election I also sent in a letter to the Congregation stating\n                that<lb/> I desired not to be put in nomination <add>?</add>\n                <persName>Mr L</persName> a candidate! This letter of mine <persName>Mr\n                    Hart</persName> assured<lb/> me on its receipt, should be read to the Cong. I\n                was therefore a matter of sufficient notoriety. Why then say<lb/> for\n                    <persName>Rosenfeld</persName> more than he said for me. Overlook both, but\n                don't do an injustice to one. That <persName>Rosenfeld</persName><lb/> behaved\n                better on <date>16<hi rend=\"sup\">th</hi> June</date> than I, it is impossible for\n                    <persName>Mr L</persName> to prove for to use <persName>Mr L's</persName> own\n                words “He<lb/> knew (that is <persName>Mr Rosenfeld</persName> knew) that his\n                reservation or disclaimer was no disclaimer, since he<lb/> also knew that I <add>i.\n                    e. <persName>Mr Leeser</persName></add> would not apply under the conditions “as\n                all the world did.

Hereby\n                    <persName>Mr L</persName> caused me to think what others have also thought, that\n                in his anger he<lb/> desired to injure me. For <add>?</add> acct the election had\n                not then been held,but postponed, consequently<lb/> this implied charge of a want of\n                consideration for <persName>Mr L</persName> &amp; some other <sic>inuendos</sic>\n                equally unfounded<lb/> &amp; uncalled for notice presently were calculated to do me\n                harm with some in <placeName>Phila.</placeName>\n                <persName>Mr De S.</persName>\n                <add>?</add>\n                <persName>Mr L</persName> in<lb/> the Occident was the only one of the candidates\n                who had been to <placeName>Phil</placeName> &amp;c during the late absence of\n                    <persName>Mr Leeser</persName><lb/> I was not the only one who thought that had\n                    <persName>Mr L</persName> left out the words during the late absence of\n                    <persName>Mr Leeser</persName><lb/> it would have been more fair &amp; dignified\n                on his part since some not acquainted with the true state of<lb/> affairs might have\n                imagined that I went to <placeName>Phil</placeName>, knowing it was not correct to\n                go there, &amp; not desiring<lb/> to meet <persName>Mr L</persName>, went behind his\n                back, covertly slyly like a thief. Those who know me <add>?</add> well<lb/> imagine\n                how my heart beat, &amp; ears tingled where I thus read &amp; thought. Instead of\n                avoiding <persName>Mr L</persName><lb/> I did all I could to see him. I delayed\n                going to <placeName>Phil.</placeName> as long as possible, though you know certain\n                parties<lb/> not members of the congregation telegraphed me that it was important I\n                should go at such a such<lb/> a time—again that I should go for\n                    <date>Pentecost</date>, which I nevertheless did not mind but waited<lb/> as\n                long as I could consistently with <persName>Mr Hart's</persName> recommendation so\n                that I might see <persName>Mr L</persName>, who, I thought<lb/> would by that time\n                be returned. And indeed the answer to my particular inquiries; at <persName>Mr\n                    L's</persName> residence<lb/> also I was told he was daily expected. As I before\n                told you I would not to please friends, or <sic>teaze</sic><lb/> enemies stay to\n                read another <date>Sabbath</date> in <placeName>Phil</placeName> though strongly\n                recommended so to do but I wrote a few lines<lb/> and if I forget not also told the\n                lady I saw at <persName>Mr l'</persName> house, to inform <persName>Mr L</persName>\n                I should stay a few days<lb/> in <placeName>New York</placeName> so that I might see\n                him, I think I said how long I should stay &amp; I asked him to<lb/> telegraph me as\n                soon as he arrived as I desired much to see him. I do not know whether <persName>Mr\n                    L</persName> did arrive<lb/> while I was in <placeName>N. Y.</placeName> but had\n                we met, I think we should not have been so many months alienated to come<lb/> twice.\n                The Oc says and his (my) testimonials which were extensively circulated (among the\n                voters only<lb/> I believe) in a hand bill (Either I did not yet know the meaning of\n                hand bill or I was right in supposing) <persName>Mr L</persName><lb/> intended it as\n                a sneer on my circulars, which in <placeName>Europe</placeName> or say\n                    <placeName>England</placeName> it is always the custom to send e. g.\n                    <persName>Dr<lb/> Raphall</persName> sent them when he applied for the\n                lectureship at the <placeName>Dukes Place</placeName> Synagogue in\n                    <placeName>London</placeName>. All the candidates<lb/> did when applying for the\n                office of Hazan in <placeName>London</placeName>. It was an inadvertence for which I\n                afterwards blamed myself<lb/> much that I did not send one to <persName>Mr\n                    L</persName> (he says in the Oc a copy reached him through the kindness of a\n                friend)<lb/> for I should with my then feelings certainly have done so just as I\n                sent then the gist of my letter to <persName>Mr Hart</persName><lb/> but I sent the\n                parcel on to <placeName>Phil</placeName> I could not afterwards procure one.\n                    <persName>Mr L</persName> says <persName>Mr De S's</persName> testimonials<lb/>\n                were highly creditable to <add>?</add> But I &amp; others too thought this no\n                praise—no kind words, for none<lb/> could say otherwise. And if all our doubt, if we\n                had any were removed by <persName>Mr L</persName> himself who labored<lb/> hard to\n                show, altho' he did not plainly say that these testimonials were only given me as a\n                matter of favor<lb/> Thus <persName>Mr L.</persName> says they were signed by the\n                    <persName>Rev D. Meldola</persName> (This name would be sufficient, as\n                every<lb/> reader of the Occident knew who <persName>Mr Meldola</persName> was,\n                since a few numbers back there was a <add>?</add><lb/> of a Catechism he published\n                or if this readers must know who <persName>Mr M</persName> his say he is\n                    6<add>?</add><lb/> Rabbi of the Portuguese Jews in <placeName>London</placeName>\n                but no <persName>Mr L</persName> gives his title the maternal uncle of<lb/>\n                <persName>Mr De S.</persName> The inference from this must be obvious. Again next\n                “by <persName>Dr Lowe</persName> his preceptor<lb/> (of course a preceptor would cry\n                up his pupils) next “by <persName>Dr A Benisch</persName>, says <persName>Mr\n                    L</persName>, “once Editor<lb/> of the voice of Jacob (why not style him what my\n                “handbill more properly calls him, Professor<lb/> of Hebrew at the Jews Institution\n                at <add>?</add> Hall author of &amp;c &amp;c but no, he was author of<lb/> the voice\n                of J. &amp; <persName>Mr D S</persName> “assisted him in his labours says\n                    <persName>Mr L.</persName> The influence is that in return<lb/> for my kindness\n                the Dr gave me a testimonial at all events he was particularly intimate with<lb/> me\n                &amp; would not refuse, next writes <persName>Mr L</persName>, but <persName>Dr\n                    Raphall</persName>. Now it might be naturally<lb/> thought that it would be\n                quite unnecessary to say who the eminent <persName>Dr Raphall</persName>\n                was—however<lb/> as he was to the American Jewish community among whom he had but\n                lately been elected Minister<lb/> with much <add>?</add> as well as <persName>Mr\n                    L.</persName> but <persName>Mr L</persName> thought otherwise.

I can then defend myself—<lb/> but do not stab me like an Italian\n                bravo—do not blast my reputation &amp; character unnecessarily <persName>Mr\n                    L</persName><lb/> may say I have fancied all this but the facts are too\n                stubborn. Believe me, dear sir, before I had said or<lb/> hinted anything about it\n                more than one expressed themselves indignant at such treatment &amp; strongly\n                advised<lb/> me to reply to it either in the Asmonean or by circular, but altho' I\n                felt myself injured &amp; knew if I<lb/> replied all would give me right in my\n                strictures on this article—still I had too much self pride so to do.<lb/> And this\n                is the reason, let me tell you <hi rend=\"underline\">en passant</hi> that I have\n                determined not to write more for the Occident<lb/> and was sorry that an article of\n                mine appeared after the publication of the above notice so that people might<lb/>\n                suppose I was still a correspondent—but which in truth I cannot be until something\n                more shall have<lb/> passed in explanation between the writer of that injurious\n                article &amp; myself. That it has done me no good<lb/> I am sure. Let <persName>Mr\n                    Solis</persName>—the friend to whom <persName>Mr L</persName> thinks I have\n                maligned him—a just &amp; candid friend himself<lb/> a correspondent of the\n                Occident—let him decide—&amp; I am sure he will not say I am altogether wrong. Your\n                opinion<lb/> you need not give for I flatter myself I know it. My efforts such as\n                they are for the Jewish cause shall not<lb/> be wanting when I can make them. Hence\n                I will write (being forced) for the Asmonean &amp; for any paper not<lb/> under the\n                control of an Editor who could thus unjustly &amp; unmercifully attack me. I am\n                fully as sensitive as <persName>Mr Leeser</persName>.<lb/> In his last letter to you\n                    <persName>Mr L</persName> writes “I would not have reacted so had <persName>Mr\n                    De S.</persName> been in my position &amp; I in his.” I think<lb/> he would\n                &amp; he ought not to forget the recommendation of our sages “Judge not thy fellow,\n                until thou hast been<lb/> in his position. <persName>Mr L.</persName> would rather\n                do anything “than undermine a friend.” If <persName>Mr L</persName> wishes to convey\n                that I have<lb/> done or attempted to do so, I repel the accusation with\n                indignation, and deny its truth by all that is sacred. <persName>Mr\n                L</persName><lb/> also says “to be in league with them whom he knew to be my enemies\n                is no test of friendship” I, as solemnly<lb/> deny the truth of this allegation. I\n                never have been in league with any one to injure <persName>Mr L</persName>, nor has\n                any one even<lb/> proposed so dishonorable a thing. I am not so easily made a cats\n                paw. No one else would charge me with acting<lb/> so irreligiously. It is an unjust\n                change founded on illiberal irreligious suspicions. Let <persName>Mr L</persName>\n                prove to you<lb/> or any one that I have leagued with his enemies if he can. He\n                surely cannot charge me with this because I<lb/> did not refuse the civilities &amp;\n                support of the <persName>Messrs Phillips</persName> whom he told me were his enemies\n                for the first<lb/> time just before he went to <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>—a\n                few weeks before the election. Previously he had never mentioned<lb/> their names to\n                me. But I will not say more about this unworthy charge. <persName>Mr L</persName>\n                says <persName>Mr D. S.</persName> would do himself<lb/> real honor by acknowledging\n                his unintentional error as I am willing to regard it as such, my feelings<lb/> were\n                greatly outraged by the manner in which he ought to carry his plan. <persName>Mr\n                    L</persName> exhibits, it appears<lb/> to me some inconsistency in this\n                statement &amp; it is what I cannot easily reconcile. If I undermined<lb/> him or\n                attempted to do so—if I leagued with his enemies to his detriment &amp; if I sought\n                to carry<lb/> my plan in so dishonorable a manner as to wound his feelings—all of\n                which <persName>Mr L</persName> says I did—how can<lb/> he say at the same time I\n                erred unintentionally. I could not undermine or league or plan unintentionally.\n                No<lb/> if I did this then I acted not unintentionally, but rascally, &amp; with\n                malice <sic>propense</sic>. This is the English of it<lb/>\n                <sic>And</sic> therefore I &amp; you &amp; any man of common sense cannot admit that\n                    <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> believes I have only erred<lb/> unintentionally,\n                while he brings forward (in the same paragraph) such serious charges against me. If\n                    <persName>Mr Leeser</persName><lb/> would do himself real honor &amp; act with\n                the justice he is fully capable to do, he will admit how incon<lb/>gruous his\n                statements are, &amp; plainly say that he does not think I leagued undermined flamed\n                &amp;<lb/> plotted against him, but that I “<hi rend=\"underline\">erred\n                    unintentionally</hi>” only. I on my part am willing to make<lb/> any\n                acknowledgment consistent with my convictions of my innocence of desiring by thought\n                or deed<lb/> to hurt him. No false pride or obstinacy, or desire to show that I am\n                better than my neighbour<lb/> shall <sic>withold</sic> me. And I do not scruple to\n                say, and <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> may know it that I am<lb/> truly sorry we\n                are not on the same terms we were this time last year. Anything that</p>"

Even before<lb/> I worried in\n                    <placeName>America</placeName> until the present moment I have always\n                entertained for him feelings of great<lb/> respect regard &amp; kindness and\n                    <sic>thugh</sic> I may no longer address him as a friend, still I am his friend\n                yet<lb/> Even if wrong, which to the extent <persName>Mr L</persName> has intimated,\n                I never can admit I have been—and I do<lb/> sincerely hope that after a\n                dispassionate reading of what I have written &amp; which I desire he should see<lb/>\n                <persName>Mr L</persName> will admit he has been deceived and ignorant of all the\n                motives &amp; circumstances under which<lb/> I acted and that he consequently has\n                been somewhat mistaken in what he has written to you<lb/> I could not say as much as\n                I have, knowing what <persName>Mr L</persName> has written already to yourself and\n                my<lb/> uncle (with whom it is impossible to injure me) I could not in all candour\n                &amp; sincerity admit<lb/> that I value <persName>Mr L's</persName> good opinion,\n                and desire he should think better of me—as well as he did of old<lb/> did I not <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">sincerely</hi> so desire, since I lay myself open to the charge\n                that having <add>?</add>fully offended <persName>Mr L</persName><lb/> I know desire\n                to conciliate him.

He appears to have regarded me as false I therefore\n                incapable of entertaining any<lb/> kind feeling towards him. Not so. My\n                communication with him during some four years was<lb/> not without its pleasures.\n                But it was our intimacy as Israelites, having the same religious<lb/>\n                convictions—belonging to the same school working in the same glorious\n                cause—having<lb/> kindred tastes &amp; sentiments—it was this intimacy that I\n                valued—always conscious (no<lb/> false pride deters me from saying it) that I\n                profited by it—as I wrote <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> in I<lb/> think the very\n                first letter I was addressed him <add>כל המחובר לטהור טהור</add>—it was the\n                sudden<lb/> unexpected severance of this intimacy that I have since regretted—the\n                more so that I am<lb/> conscious of never having been guilty of doing that which\n                should cause it. Is <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> willing<lb/> to retract his\n                serious charges that I have attempted <sic>wilfully</sic> to undermine him—that I\n                have<lb/> leagued myself with his enemies—that I have made false protestations and\n                acted falsely to him<lb/> and instead of these charges admit after reading the above\n                that he now attaches I only unintentionally<lb/> erred against him and bore him no\n                malice (as how should I) then I on my part am quite<lb/> willing beforehand candidly\n                to admit that in many things I may have acted foolishly both for<lb/> his &amp; my\n                interest and that it is quite possible I hurt his feelings as he says, and even\n                slightly<lb/> injured him by anything I may unintentionally have done. Any further\n                admission compatible with<lb/> the declarations I have already made, I am quite\n                willing further to make and questions to<lb/> answer, since it is not a matter of\n                indifference whether <persName>Mr L</persName> or any other man thinks<lb/> well or\n                ill of me.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">Having made this communication so long I must <sic>apologise</sic>\n                for stating up so much<lb/> of your time, but it will be the last time I shall ever\n                trouble you with so long &amp; tiresome<lb/> a letter on this subject. Indeed it\n                will be quite useless and impossible for me to do so since<lb/> should <persName>Mr\n                    Leeser</persName> not be willing to admit what I think he in common justice\n                &amp; truth<lb/> should I have not one word more to say in the matter as it would be\n                a waste of<lb/> time that could be better employed. I am now writing into another\n                day and last night<lb/> it was the same for I have been unable to put aside other\n                things go claiming my<lb/> attention just now. I would not mind my convenience and I\n                think any good<lb/> could come of it, but as <persName>Mr Leeser's</persName>\n                retraction of his unfounded charges can be the only good</p>"
