Under the able editorship of the late\n                    <persName>Rev.

It was his earnest\n                wish that its publication<lb/> should be continued after his death. Personally, and\n                in his will, he requested<lb/> the subscriber to take editorial charge of it, and\n                although there were many<lb/> reasons to cause hesitancy in accepting the trust, two\n                circumstances over-<lb/>came his reluctance. The one was a natural anxiety that the\n                desire of his<lb/> lamented friend should be fulfilled, and the other, a conviction\n                that the Jews<lb/> of <placeName>America</placeName> still need an organ which has\n                so long maintained its position.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">Its literary character will be such as to make it attractive to all\n                households,<lb/> and neither pains nor expense will be spared to procure\n                contributions on<lb/> Jewish subjects from persons of talent.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">Its religious position is too well defined to need any explanation.\n                In the<lb/> words of <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>, “Whatever can promote the\n                welfare of Israelites and<lb/> their faith, shall always find an ardent advocate in\n                it; whatever is hostile to<lb/> either, shall ever meet its decided opposition.”</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">To Jewish families, everywhere, who desire to know the events\n                which<lb/> affect their co-religionists in all parts of the world, this work will be\n                a wel-<lb/>come visitor.
