Several\n                houses and vessels were decorated with flags of different<lb/> nations, which gave a\n                beautiful appearance to our harbour. At 7 o'clock<lb/> in the morning and at ½ past\n                6 in the afternoon the Dutch Schooner<lb/> “Galgo,” owned by <persName>Mr. Abm. Ib.\n                    Jesurun</persName>, left the harbour decorated with flags,<lb/> and fired a\n                salute of 21 guns opposite the dwelling of <persName>Mr. Da. Senior Jr.</persName>\n                who,<lb/> as Vice-President of above named Society, gave a splendid ball in the\n                evening<lb/> of that day in celebration of the festivity. Before the commencement of\n                the ball,<lb/> which was numerously attended, <persName>Dr A. M. C.\n                    Henriquez</persName> President of the<lb/> Society delivered an address, where\n                he developed, in a concise manner &amp; in<lb/> eloquent language, the progress of\n                the society during the past year. Afterwards<lb/> a magnificent piece of fire work\n                was ignited, which in exploding displayed<lb/> a flag with the following inscription\n                “El Provenir, <date>17 Diciembre 1863</date>”</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">The ball lasted <sic>untill</sic> early in the morning of the\n                    <date>18th</date> and the guests<lb/> retired most <sic>agreably</sic> impressed\n                and highly pleased with the entertainment.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">On the same day the Dutch Reformed Israelitish Congregation\n                intro-<lb/>duced for the first time at their divine service singing accompanied by\n                an<lb/> Organ.
