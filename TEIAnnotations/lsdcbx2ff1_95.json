When he married me in <placeName>N. O.</placeName> I gave him<lb/> no\n                encouragement for I knew he would not suit our people. I then heard from<lb/>\n                <persName>Mr. Gutheim</persName> that a friend of his would probably be taken up.\n                    <persName>Dr. E.</persName> knew this,<lb/> but took the chances. He was not\n                elected here until we heard <persName>Dr. Steinberg</persName><lb/> could or would\n                not come, for what reasons we are childishly ignorant. <persName>Dr. E.</persName>\n                only<lb/> received 26 votes, the 7 others blank. The salary of $3500 was reduced\n                to<lb/> $2000, &amp; the term of 3 years was reduced to <hi rend=\"underline\"\n                    >one</hi>. Even at these sacrifices the<lb/> few who upheld him found it\n                difficult to elect him &amp; we had to debate &amp; debate<lb/> until eleven o'clock\n                at night &amp; by skill and ingenuity crowd down the opposi-<lb/>tion. The sequel\n                will prove how worthy he has repaid them their labor. I was,<lb/> when I saw no\n                other minister on hand, eager to take up the <persName>Doctor</persName> in order\n                that<lb/> as a synagogue we might have a head &amp; a respectable one. My father,\n                    <persName>Louis</persName>, <persName>Cohn</persName>,<lb/>\n                <persName>Sam</persName>, <persName>Marx</persName> &amp; others will attest how\n                earnestly we labored together &amp; fought the<lb/>\n                <persName>Doctor</persName> through.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">Previous to the building of the Synagogues which exist at\n                present<lb/> we had one Shochet &amp; each congregation paid $12.50 per month, &amp;\n                the butchers so<lb/> much per head, making it sufficient to support a man, but\n                lately the increase<lb/> in the butcher business has been so good that our\n                congregation determined to<lb/> suspend the payment of $12.50 &amp; of licensing two\n                Shochtim, as the revenue proved<lb/> to be by examining the butchers themselves,\n                over two hundred and fifty dollars<lb/> per month, and in case of <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">sickness</hi> one could resume the other's position. We<lb/>\n                gave no preferences, no recommendations. We appointed <persName>Mr.\n                    Messenger</persName> &amp; <persName>Mr. Gold-<lb/>smith</persName> and allowed\n                butchers to select their own<lb/> Shochet, of the two, <persName>Mr. M.</persName>\n                However belonging to our Synagogue and <persName>Mr. G.</persName> to<lb/> the\n                Polish. <persName>Mr. M.</persName> came to us with 3 Robolahs from\n                    <placeName>Europe</placeName> and superior<lb/> recommendations. I myself would\n                not vote for both until I carefully examined<lb/> &amp; found the business would\n                support two. When we sent to <persName>Dr. Eckman</persName> to examine<lb/> these\n                men he refused to examine <persName>Mr. Messenger</persName> &amp; sent us a long\n                article about<lb/> the necessary requisitions for Schochet, failing, however, to\n                tell us that<lb/>\n                <persName>Mr. M.</persName> had not proved competent. We replied (<persName>Dr.\n                    Eckman</persName> was then &amp; is now<lb/> boarding at <persName>Mr.\n                    Goldsmith</persName>) that as <persName>Dr. E.</persName> wishes such a standard\n                for Shochtim &amp;<lb/> we the trustees believed no man in\n                    <placeName>California</placeName> was competent to stand the test<lb/> &amp; we\n                must have a Shochet rather than none, such as we have always had, we<lb/> appointed\n                three of our Congregation to examine the candidates, men who always<lb/> examined\n                them, previous to the arrival of <persName>Dr. Eckman</persName> in\n                    <placeName>California</placeName>. These men<lb/> examined <persName>Mr.\n                    Messinger</persName> and pronounced him skilfull &amp; highly competent.\n                    <persName>Mr. Gold-<lb/>smith</persName> sent us a communication which evidently\n                was dictated by the<lb/>\n                <persName>Doctor</persName>, saying in short he would not be examined by those men.\n                Wherefore the<lb/> Trustees rescinded his appointment. What was our astonishment to\n                find <persName>Dr. E.</persName><lb/> publish a card in the morning papers\n                nullifying the act of the Trustees, who<lb/> created him, and pronouncing against us\n                &amp; in favor of a foreign congregation with-<lb/> out our knowledge &amp; consent\n                &amp; virtually injuring <hi rend=\"underline\">a man</hi> whom <hi rend=\"underline\"\n                    >he</hi> did not <hi rend=\"underline\">deign</hi> to<lb/> question. <persName>Dr.\n                    E.</persName> said he did not keep his <date>Sabbaths</date> previous to\n                election, whereas<lb/> we know it was utterly out of his power to do so as his bread\n                depended on it.<lb/>\n                <persName>Dr. E.</persName> has been coalesced with Shochet\n                    <persName>Goldsmith</persName> &amp; has violently opposed his own congregation.\n                A Trustee meeting is to be held &amp; they are the <persName>Doctors</persName>\n                warmest<lb/> supporters. I learn they intend to request the\n                    <persName>Doctor</persName> to resign. He who was so</p>"
