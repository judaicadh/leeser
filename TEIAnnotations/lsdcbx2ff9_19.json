At last I can give you again<lb/> some information. I have been all the\n                time<lb/> well, though suffered much anxiety during<lb/> this war. You must have\n                heard already that<lb/> I had a law suit with the congregation where<lb/> I am\n                engaged, and that I beat them in the<lb/> first case, and hope to beat them in the\n                second<lb/> for libel, as soon when the courts will be open<lb/> again—they reckoned\n                behind the host those<lb/> reformers. I had three counsels employed and<lb/> so had\n                they, the case lasted three and half<lb/> day—it was hotly contested by them, but\n                they<lb/> knew they had little chance, it was very<lb/> interesting. In order to get\n                rid of me they accused<lb/> me, that whereas my brother had opened a wholesale<lb/>\n                provision store and <sic>commisary</sic> business and used<lb/> my name is the firm\n                    (<persName role=\"author\">Jacob J. Peres</persName> &amp; Co.) and whereas<lb/>\n                he had op<add>?</add> his store on <add>?</add>. I had<lb/> violated the\n                    <date>Shabbath</date>. My plea was, firstly to<lb/>\n                <sic>shew</sic> (by <add>שלחן ערוך</add> etc) the invalidity of the charge<lb/> and\n                secondly, that malice was the cause of the<lb/> charge, especially my being opposed\n                to reform. They<lb/> never dreamed that I could give them such good</p>"
