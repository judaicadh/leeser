From a letter received from\n                                                  <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, it appears\n                                        there<lb/> was an impression of your having been ill-treated\n                                        by the Congregation,<lb/> here, after you had bestirred\n                                        yourself so much in personally attending<lb/> to the\n                                        announcement and quick dispatch of articles ordered for<lb/>\n                                        the synagogue. If such an idea entered your mind, the\n                                        plain<lb/> statement in this letter of the true facts will\n                                        remove its and satisfy<lb/> you on this head. Nor must you\n                                        interpret <persName>G. Kursheedt's</persName> silence<lb/>\n                                        to any neglect or forgetfulness on his part.

It is impossible for you to\n                                        conceive the dilatory manner things<lb/> are managed here.\n                                        Business absorbs men's attention from morn till night,<lb/>\n                                        and from that they will not budge.
