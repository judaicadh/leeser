This<lb/> matter is terribly involved. There are 50 kinds of things against\n                it<lb/> and a like number in favor. He can and may not invalidate himself from<lb/>\n                being a <persName>Cohen</persName>. First of all, we must seek — I say seek — I want\n                to use the<lb/> definite term, for I am among those who are fearful for the teaching\n                of<lb/> tradition — not to express anything that will make her valid as a\n                Jewess.<lb/> This is what you have failed to do, to make the mother a Jewess. If\n                she<lb/> is a Jewess, then the thing could be done, for then the Biblical law\n                no<lb/> longer applies- that the children are of a Jewish father and they can\n                be<lb/> full Jews. It will be difficult. Let her go to the ritual bath only<lb/>\n                because of a doubt of Jewishness. Above all comes the question, whether<lb/> it is\n                possible that the mother, who lacks only the ritual bath, does this<lb/> only\n                because, as <persName>von Beil</persName> says, she is a cripple. Perhaps it could\n                be<lb/> done by force. <sic>write</sic> to me about it. This would be the first\n                step, then<lb/> we shall see what is to be done further. I am still not clear about\n                it,<lb/> and should like to have the whole matter thoroughly explained, in\n                order,<lb/> if possible, to turn it into a <hi rend=\"underline\">fait accompli</hi>.\n                For the moment, I am too<lb/> much worried with the pains of editorship.\n                    <persName>Isaacs</persName> is silent <del>after</del> ever since I had<lb/>\n                myself <del>set him aside</del> refuted him, well but quietly. He and his are mean\n                fellows.<lb/> The free school here is humbug, Its matzo-baking president is the\n                lowest<lb/> of the low — of the vice-president. One of the chief teachers, also\n                a<lb/> — did some unclean things with children in other schools. Should one<lb/>\n                keep quiet about such things? That is why I have written that one who<lb/> uncovers\n                only one portion merely covers up double the amount. I don't<lb/> want to speak\n                about other things.. Keep for me the reports of the assembly</p>"
