The most of them are for the <hi rend=\"underline\">Bible</hi>\n                and<lb/> the advocate both. There is little spirit in my congregation; but<lb/> when\n                the Bible is completed, I have little doubt of being able to<lb/> dispose of many\n                copies; its price $6 deters many from subscribing.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">It is useless expatiating on my troubles; I have<lb/> become callous\n                to them, and am determined not to worry myself<lb/> to neutralize the malicious\n                efforts of discontented demagogues against<lb/> me. As long as I can <add>?</add>\n                this place, I continue in my office,<lb/> when no longer practicable—away with bib\n                and gown—and<lb/> hurra for something more congenial and less annoying.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">I will most certainly write you again shortly.<lb/> I congratulate\n                you on the handsome testimonial of respect you<lb/> have recd. and the address which\n                must be still more satisfactory.<lb/>\n                <hi rend=\"underline\">Desiring</hi> you to be well and happy which <persName>Mrs.\n                    N</persName> wish her love, also<lb/> does <hi rend=\"indent(7)\">I am</hi></p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(9)\">Your's Truly</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(11)\">\n                <persName role=\"author\">MNN.</persName>\n            </p>"
