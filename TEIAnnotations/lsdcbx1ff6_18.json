It<lb/> may then be\n                                        understood that 20 accessions to the requisition,<lb/>\n                                        whether of delegates or private individuals, shall be\n                                        deemed<lb/> the sufficient number, for holding the meeting,\n                                        not however<lb/> limiting it to that number if more should\n                                        have notified their<lb/> intention to attend it. 2. If the\n                                        assembly is to be constituted<lb/> of delegates only from\n                                        the congregations it may consist of many<lb/> if not of a\n                                        majority of individuals knowing little of the matters to\n                                        be<lb/> discussed, because appointed by congregations who at\n                                        this stage<lb/> may be equally uninformed upon them.
