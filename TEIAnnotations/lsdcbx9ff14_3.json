These are <persName>Mr\n                    Carillon's</persName> words “God forbid that any<lb/> Jews should commit\n                rebellion against the God of our fathers„<lb/> by adding human laws, to the divine,\n                pure and perfect code &amp;c<lb/> Now in reference to some of our festivals, it is\n                enjoined that<lb/> the <hi rend=\"underline\">first</hi> and <hi rend=\"underline\"\n                    >seventh</hi> day be holy convocations: is it not then<lb/> to fly in the very\n                face of this divine command to add, <hi rend=\"underline\">voluntarily</hi><lb/> to\n                these two days, a <hi rend=\"underline\">second</hi> and an <hi rend=\"underline\"\n                    >eighth</hi> day? is it not an open<lb/> violation of the precept\n                    <add>Hebrew</add> “Thou shalt neither<lb/> add to nor diminish from it [the\n                law]</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">It is worthy remark, that from the observance of<lb/> these double\n                festivals we give utterance in our prayers to expressions<lb/> both untrue and\n                contradictory. For instance, one of these interpolated<lb/> festivals\n                    (<add>Hebrew</add>) kept on a <hi rend=\"underline\">ninth</hi> day, we, in our\n                solemn prayer,<lb/> call <add>Hebrew</add> (“This <date><hi rend=\"underline\"\n                        >eighth</hi> day of solemn assembly</date> Again;<lb/> on the second day of\n                    <add>Hebrew</add> (<date>new year</date>) we repeat <add>Hebrew</add> (“The<lb/>\n                world was brought into existence <hi rend=\"underline\">this</hi> day) which cannot be\n                predicated<lb/> of <hi rend=\"underline\">both</hi> days, for one is evidently a\n                negation of the other. But much<lb/> more objectionable is that highly\n                    <sic>irreverend</sic> disregard of holy truth,<lb/> which, on the double\n                festivals—additions made by <hi rend=\"underline\">mortal man</hi>—<lb/> proclaims\n                    <add>Hebrew</add> (“These are the festivals of the Lord,<lb/> holy\n                convocations”). Now as all these double festivals, including <add>Hebrew</add><lb/>\n                are confessedly<hi rend=\"underline\"> “human laws,”</hi> called by\n                    <persName>Maimonides</persName>\n                <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> (words or institutions of the scribes) I would then\n                respectfully ask<lb/>\n                <persName>Mr Carrillon</persName> in the name of that holy religion we both\n                reverence,<lb/> whether these <hi rend=\"underline\">human</hi> ordinances, added to\n                the “divine code” do not<lb/> come under the category of the sins he so emphatically\n                denounces?<lb/> Antiquity of custom, in the present case, is unentitled to the\n                slightest<lb/> weight, because, this custom, the offspring of sheer necessity with\n                which<lb/> it should have ceased, is a positive transgression of God's law. Let\n                it<lb/> be imagined that necessity had compelled our ancestors to diminish<lb/>\n                <hi rend=\"underline\">from</hi> instead of adding <hi rend=\"underline\">to</hi> the\n                divine code—had compelled them to<lb/> keep only six instead of seven days\n                    <date>Passover</date>; would future generations<lb/> of Jews, in the supposed\n                cases, be justified by veneration of antiquity<lb/> to continue to sin voluntarily,\n                because their ancestors had thus acted<lb/> from compulsion? “No” replies Holy Writ\n                “Thou shalt neither<lb/>\n                <hi rend=\"underline\">add</hi> to nor diminish <hi rend=\"underline\">from</hi> the\n                law” Should it be asked in case<lb/> of the abolition of the second day\n                    <add>Hebrew</add> what is to be done</p>"
