You know it is easy to make\n                    <del>asser</del> assertions,<lb/> but they will not stand without substantial\n                proof.

Let me\n                advise you,<lb/> my dear friend, to read the books of the Old Testament well, before\n                you<lb/> venture on such dangerous ground again as asserting things about us\n                Jews,<lb/> which you may not <hi rend=\"underline\">be able to sustain with\n                    incontestable</hi> proof, when called upon.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">In support of your assertion concerning the beauty of the gospel\n                you<lb/> introduce a few verses from the <hi rend=\"underline\">sermon on the\n                    mount</hi> in the fifth chapter<lb/> of <persName>Matthew</persName>. By <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">so doing you have imposed upon me an</hi> invidious task,<lb/>\n                namely of attacking the <sic>christian</sic> religion in some manner, when I should\n                have<lb/> been very glad, to have let the gospels <del>at</del> rest. But I am now\n                called upon to<lb/> defend the tenets of my faith, and dare not therefore shrink\n                from the<lb/> responsibility thus thrown upon me, although this happens without\n                my<lb/> desiring it.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">Let me premise that the religion which we profess, is divided<lb/>\n                into three parts: first, duties towards God, secondly, duties towards our fellow\n                men,<lb/> and lastly duties towards ourselves. The duties towards God impose upon\n                us<lb/> the belief in the Creator, confidence in His protection, hope in His\n                salvation and<lb/> the observance of His statutes. The duties towards our fellow men\n                consist in acts<lb/> of charity and benevolence and in abstaining from injuring\n                them, in their person<lb/> property and honour. Duties towards ourselves are: self\n                preservation &amp;<lb/> self-<sic>defence</sic>; by which I mean that first we shall\n                not depend upon others for our <sic>livelyhood</sic>,<lb/> if we are ourselves\n                capable of making a living, as it is beautifully said<lb/> in the Proverbs of the\n                Fathers: “Sweet is the learning of the law, combined<lb/> with labour, for to be\n                engaged in both makes us abstain from sin;” and<lb/> secondly to be careful for the\n                preservation of our health. Self <sic>defence</sic><lb/> demands of us to conduct\n                ourselves so that we shall not be exposed to<lb/> the hatred or violence of others;\n                but if in spite of all our endeavours we<lb/> are molested and violently attacked,\n                it is lawful to prevent our adversary<lb/> from injuring us; and if he attempts to\n                kill us, it is even permitted to<lb/> slay him, if we can in no other manner prevent\n                him; in support<lb/> of this position, I refer you to Exo.

Let us now apply<lb/> this rule\n                to the chapter of <persName>Matthew</persName> in question, to test its correctness.\n                In<lb/> the outset, he, whom the <sic>chirstians</sic> call the Messiah\n                    (<persName>Christ</persName>) says him<lb/>self; “think not that I am come to\n                destroy the law of the prophets: I am not<lb/> come to destroy, but to\n                    <sic>fulfil</sic> &amp;c &amp;c. Here, my dear Prof. of\n                    <persName>Christ</persName>, you have<lb/> it <hi rend=\"underline\">from what you\n                    must think the highest authority</hi> that <hi rend=\"underline\">the gospels\n                    must</hi><lb/>\n                <hi rend=\"underline\">in every particular</hi> conform to the <hi rend=\"underline\"\n                    >Mosaic</hi> writings which let me repeat were<lb/> given by the Author of All\n                for the government of <placeName>Israël</placeName>, and as you believe in<lb/>\n                Revelation, you must acknowledge, that these writings contain the best code<lb/> of\n                laws that can be devised. Well then, when <persName>Matthew</persName> says, “swear\n                not at all,”<lb/> the <sic>christian</sic> writers are puzzled how to explain it,\n                and the learned <persName>Dr. James<lb/> Beattie</persName> explains it so as to\n                mean any unnecessary oath, which however can<lb/> hardly be the meaning of this\n                passage. What <persName>Matthew</persName> says in the same chapter<lb/> from the v.\n                38 to the 41, I am bold to assert has never been fulfilled by fifty<lb/> men from\n                all <sic>christendom</sic> ever since <sic>christianity</sic> was established, and\n                if<lb/> these doctrines were adopted as the general rule of society, every wicked\n                person<lb/> could <hi rend=\"underline\">with impunity despoil his unoffending\n                    neighbour</hi>; and let me ask you<lb/> can this be the will of God? For what\n                did he command the election of<lb/> judges if it were not to see the innocent\n                righted? And have the Society of Friends,<lb/> who more than any other Christian\n                sect, try to obey the <del>above</del> commandments<lb/> in question, ever acted up\n                to the letter of them?</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">In the 43 v. of the same chapter <persName>Matthew</persName> says:\n                Ye have heard that it<lb/> has been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">thine</hi> enemy; &amp;c<lb/> Now pardon me, my friend, when I\n                beg of you to tell me in what part of the Old Testa<lb/>ment or any Jewish writing\n                the foregoing sentiment is found? Hate our<lb/> enemies? Heavenly father!\n                    <sic>has</sic> it come to this, that thy children<lb/> who have suffered for\n                ages persecutions without number for the SANC-<lb/>TIFICATION OF THY HOLY NAME, who\n                have been<lb/> slaughtered like sheep that are dumb before their shearers, without\n                mur-<lb/>muring, without repining—shall thy children Oh our Father above be<lb/>\n                accused of hating their enemies!

Indeed! but even here you would be\n                mistaken; for in the<lb/> Talmud we find the following: “A stranger came to <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\"><persName>Shamai</persName></hi> and told him<lb/> Rabbi I wish\n                to become a <sic>proselite</sic>, but you must teach me the law, while<lb/> I can\n                stand on one leg; but <persName>Shamai</persName> turned him off, not thinking it\n                possible<lb/> to teach him the law in so short a time. The stranger went next to\n                    <persName>Hilled,<lb/> surnamed the Elder</persName>, and repeated the same\n                request, “my son,” answered<lb/> the Rabbi, “what is disagreeable to thee, do not to\n                thy neighbour, (or companion),<lb/> for thus it is written thou shalt love thy\n                neighbour like thyself, this is the princi-<lb/>ple commandment, and if you observe\n                this strictly you will easily observe<lb/> the other precepts of the law.”—What\n                    <persName>Matthew</persName> says concerning the punish-<lb/>ment to him, who\n                makes his antagonist ashamed in public, is also found in<lb/> the Proverbs of the\n                Fathers, which declare: “He, who <del>that</del> makes the face of his<lb/>\n                neighbour turn pale in public, though he has knowledge of the law and has<lb/>\n                otherwise acted well, will not <del>have</del> share in the happiness of the\n                future<lb/> life.” What then I ask you again has the gospel taught new to the\n                Jews?<lb/> Since the Old Testament <sic>containes</sic> all the moral doctrines, and\n                the Rabbins<lb/> (Pharisees &amp; Scribes) of the time of\n                    <persName>Christ</persName> did invariably preach up in<lb/> the Synagogues\n                &amp; Temple doctrines conformable to their Text-Book,<lb/> namely the\n                    <del>two</del> twenty four books of the Jewish Canon.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">I have thus I hope made my assertions good, that our law is a<lb/>\n                perfect model of a moral and religious code, that there is nothing too much<lb/> and\n                nothing too little in it, and in fact, if any man will but examine the<lb/>\n                wonderful effect it has had of keeping a <hi rend=\"underline\">dispersed people\n                    united in</hi></p>"

But our opinion is\n                this, our law was given as the standard,<lb/> to which all nations were ultimately\n                to resort <del>to</del> as a rallying point, till<lb/> when, every man <del>was to\n                    be saved</del>\n                <hi rend=\"underline\">who is no Israelites</hi>, was to be saved if he<lb/> acted\n                according to the light given him, if <del>they</del> he only observed the\n                precepts<lb/> of general revelation given to <persName>Noah</persName>, which are to\n                be found in the ninth<lb/> chapter of genesis, and it was therefore the practice of\n                the Jews, when ever<lb/> they conquered, to make the subdued nation conform to the\n                “seven command<lb/>ments of the children of <persName>Noah</persName>” as they are\n                called in the Talmud. Each<lb/> son of <placeName>Israel</placeName>, on the\n                contrary is bound to observe all that lies in his power<lb/> to do, as otherwise he\n                is to be punished for good deeds omitted and sins committed.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">It would be a great satisfaction to me, to be assured, that I had\n                effec-<lb/>tually removed the ill-will so many feel towards us, that I had\n                contri-<lb/>buted a little to make <placeName>Israël</placeName> more respected in\n                this country, and particular-<lb/>ly in this city. Let me at the same time call upon\n                my brethren, those<lb/> who with me believe in the <hi rend=\"underline\">same\n                    immortal unchangeable God</hi>, who</p>"
