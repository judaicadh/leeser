Besides my principal\n                                        reason for not having been more<lb/> prompt is, that I\n                                        determined never to appear before you empty handed,<lb/>\n                                        viz, without contributing something to the Occident, and\n                                        thus I offer<lb/> you the enclosed trifle which you may\n                                        insert in your invaluable journal<lb/> if you find it worthy\n                                        to have a place therein, and good enough to<lb/> stand the\n                                        scrutiny of the <sic>criticising</sic> public.

Such a controversy\n                                        would<lb/> draw the attention of the public more\n                                        successfully, those who<lb/> are lukewarm may become\n                                        interested in the matter, while the<lb/> ultra Orthodox will\n                                        gradually yield. I merely suggest this<lb/> because there\n                                        are many here and probably everywhere else, who will\n                                        not<lb/> listen to reason, and merely say, <hi\n                                                  rend=\"underline\">It cannot be done</hi>. One<lb/>\n                                        objects because his neighbor says it is injurious, the\n                                        other, because<lb/> it will cost something, a third, wishes\n                                        to show the public<lb/> that he possess wisdom, and\n                                        foresight. In short there are but<lb/> precious few who\n                                        oppose the measure from true religions</p>"
