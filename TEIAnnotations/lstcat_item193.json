Is it a proof of your altered feelings towards<lb/>\n                <hi rend=\"underline\">me</hi>, or an idea that mine could possibly change, or <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">have</hi> changed towards <hi rend=\"underline\">you</hi>?\n                “Reform<lb/> is altogether.” I must also premise that your note of <date>Oct. 2<hi\n                        rend=\"sup\">nd</hi>.</date> found me on a sick<lb/> bed, and which\n                incapacitated me from public duty for nearly 3 weeks. It was<lb/> a severe attack of\n                influenza, arising from the sudden change of very hot weather to<lb/> heavy rains\n                and strong north winds.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">I left <placeName>Kingston</placeName> on the <date>9<hi rend=\"sup\"\n                        >th</hi>.

A\n                large concourse of my members met me at the wharf,<lb/> and accompanied me to the\n                lodgings they had provided and furnished, until I could purchase<lb/> my own things.\n                After drinking a glass of wine, we went to Synagogue, for me to say\n                <add>גומל</add>.<lb/> On returning home, a letter from some of my lady friends was\n                handed me, together with<lb/> a handsome suit of canonicals, of which they requested\n                my acceptance. In the evening,<lb/> the congregation being assembled for\n                    <add>ערבית</add>, I was led in by the Presidt. &amp; Vice, seated in<lb/> the\n                President's chair, while the congregation sang <add>ברוך הבא</add>. After which the\n                President<lb/> from the Tebah addressed me, and on concluding, he and the vice led\n                me to the Tebah,<lb/> where I addressed the congregation for 10 minutes or so. After\n                which I read the Evening<lb/> Service, paid musaph<add>?</add> next day, and\n                preached; <persName>Mr. Maduro</persName> my assistant Reader read the<lb/> second\n                Evening and following day. I read <add>שבת שיבה</add> and preached on\n                    <date>Kippoor</date> my portion<lb/> was <add>מוסף</add> &amp; <add>כל\n                    נדרי</add>, <add>ערבית</add>, a sermon, and <add>נעילה</add>.

An audience<lb/>\n                filling every inch of the building (at least 500 persons) consisting of our\n                congregation, and<lb/> a very large number of Christians, assembled at 7 PM. The\n                Governor and his suite, and several<lb/> heads of departments were present; among\n                the rest, the Presbyterian, Lutheran, and<lb/> Moravian clergymen.

My bold sentiments\n                have made me (for the <add>?</add>) very popular; and my members<lb/> are\n                consequently pleased that their minister should be well spoken of, and his\n                preaching<lb/> admired. But I am too old to be vain of Popular applause: yet I am\n                gratified<lb/> that the attempt to do my duty has not been exceeded by any other\n                Clergyman in<lb/> the place.</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(1)\">With reference to the state of parties in the congregation, affairs\n                are<lb/> much more quietly and peaceably conducted than <del>when</del> they were\n                when I<lb/> was minister here before. There are a great many young people married\n                and un-<lb/>married who both think and act far differently to what was then the\n                mode. They<lb/> keep down the turbulent determinedly; for still some of the old\n                    l<add>?</add> remains, constantly<lb/> kept in a state of fermentation by one of\n                the most mischievous men I ever met with. Some<lb/> of these dissatisfied ones\n                wanted no minister at all, because their <add>?</add> would have<lb/> been made\n                larger to support him. With the exception of a very very few, whom I<lb/> hope by\n                discretion and prudence to gain over, <del>the <add>?</add>\n                </del> the whole body of members is well<lb/> affected to me. We seldom have less\n                than 150 to 180 persons present every<lb/>\n                <date>Sabbath</date> morning about 20 to 25 every <date>Friday</date> Evening, the\n                same member to<lb/> mincha<add>?</add> on <date>Sabbath</date>, and about 35 or\n                    <date>Sabbath</date> Evening. You will agree with me that this<lb/> is not bad.\n                I should say that our member, all told, approaches close to 400.</p>"

I\n                have<lb/> had 2 of the former, and one of the latter (celebrated in Synagogue) since\n                my<lb/> arrival. I spoke on Each occasion. The marriage was a s<add>?</add>gated\n                one. The<lb/> parties (both Israelites) <hi rend=\"underline\">had</hi> already been\n                married civilly in <placeName>New Grenada</placeName>, and so it was<lb/> somewhat\n                anomalous. We anticipated some loud complaints when the new assessmt.<lb/> should be\n                fixed, as the tapes would be so much heavier, but with the exception<lb/> of the\n                    <add>גרום</add> I before mentioned, who threatened to create a scandal, if his\n                assessment<lb/> was not fixed at the sum he named, there has not been a murmur. The\n                Representatives<lb/> refused to be frightened; and so he is left to create what\n                scandal he pleases. But he<lb/> is so much disliked, and Government is so rejoiced\n                at the peaceable turn things<lb/> have taken under the new minister, that he will,\n                no doubt, take care of what he<lb/> does, particularly as he is an arrant coward. At\n                this moment, the feeling upper-<lb/>most among the Jewish public is the enlargement\n                of the Synagogue, very much<lb/> needed.
