I have had no<lb/> new prophetic excitement or\n                revelation since parting from<lb/> you in <placeName>New York</placeName>, nor do I\n                expect ever to have any<lb/> of such overwhelming force as those experienced there\n                    <del>in New</del><lb/>\n                <del>York</del>, and wherein, seemingly, I was admonished of all<lb/> that is\n                material for my future guidance. So far as<lb/> experience enables me to state, the\n                grand result of a<lb/> prophet's intentions, is but to recognize the perfect<lb/>\n                truth and correctness of the principle to do in all cases<lb/> whatever we can judge\n                to be right before God, without<lb/> regard to consequences, trusting these entirely\n                to His<lb/> disposal as immeasurably superior to our own limited<lb/> views. Thus\n                    <persName>Mrs. G.</persName> the poetess, when she had promised<lb/> me some\n                verses, would, if she had acted in accordance with<lb/> the suggestions of\n                inspiration, have sent them to the Occident<lb/> at my request; merely because it\n                was <hi rend=\"underline\">right</hi> for her<lb/> to do so; and the Editor would have\n                made her an ade<lb/>quate return in the manner pointed out, as an act of sim<lb/>ple\n                justice. The principle of our duty to God is but Just<lb/>-ice: if we accept a\n                benefit, we are bound to endeavour<lb/> to return it: if we would reap a good, we\n                must sow<lb/> of the kind. This moral obligation so congenial to the<lb/> natural\n                feelings, and the conformity to which is hailed<lb/> as a divine attribute of\n                humanity, the prophet learns to be<lb/> but a just and pleasant indication of the\n                course which is</p>"
