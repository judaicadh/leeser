In the month before the last, I went to the<lb/>\n                                        post-office, and after several inquiries, I received six\n                                        numbers which<lb/> had not been delivered. Every one of them\n                                        had had the address torn off<lb/> But who was it who had not\n                                        received them? I, therefore, waited several more<lb/> weeks\n                                        for the last number, and, several days later, upon receiving\n                                        my<lb/> own, I found only three left over, but also without\n                                        address. Since<lb/> I have acquired two new subscribers,\n                                        whose names I shall write<lb/> below, I gave them two of\n                                        these copies. Later, I saw nothing until<lb/> yesterday,\n                                        when I again found five copies and two exemplars<lb/>\n                                        “Obligation of the Sabbath” Of these five copies, only three\n                                        had<lb/> addresses, namely, <persName>Israel\n                                                  Hyman</persName>, <persName>L. Bach</persName>,\n                                        and <persName>Sol. Simmons</persName>,<lb/> the last, as I\n                                        have recently found out, is now in\n                                                  <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName>, then<lb/> I\n                                        think I can transmit this copy to him. As I wrote to you\n                                        in<lb/> that letter you have not yet received, the following\n                                        have discontinued:—<lb/>\n                                        <persName>Abraham Din Kelsfial</persName>,\n                                                  <persName>Goldberg</persName>,\n                                                  <persName>Mark</persName>,\n                                                  <persName>Mark</persName>,\n                                                  <persName>Rosenberg</persName>,\n                                                  <persName>Sale</persName>,\n                                                  <persName>Hy<lb/>man</persName>,\n                                                  <persName>Zilberman</persName>,\n                                                  <persName>Uhlman</persName>, <persName>E.\n                                                  Bamberger</persName>, <persName>Moses\n                                                  Lieberman</persName>, and<lb/> if I am not\n                                        mistaken, <persName>J.

You see,\n                                        therefore, that almost all<lb/> your subscribers here, while\n                                        they do not look down upon your<lb/> periodical, hate to\n                                        give up the $3. Since I received altogether five<lb/> copies\n                                        which have not been called for, I cannot tell you in\n                                        detail<lb/> up to the present moment. For the same reason, I\n                                        have not yet collected<lb/> much.

In the month before the last, I went to the<lb/>\n                                        post-office, and after several inquiries, I received six\n                                        numbers which<lb/> had not been delivered.

I, therefore, waited several more<lb/> weeks\n                                        for the last number, and, several days later, upon receiving\n                                        my<lb/> own, I found only three left over, but also without\n                                        address. Since<lb/> I have acquired two new subscribers,\n                                        whose names I shall write<lb/> below, I gave them two of\n                                        these copies. Later, I saw nothing until<lb/> yesterday,\n                                        when I again found five copies and two exemplars<lb/>\n                                        “Obligation of the Sabbath” Of these five copies, only three\n                                        had<lb/> addresses, namely, <persName>Israel\n                                                  Hyman</persName>, <persName>L. Bach</persName>,\n                                        and <persName>Sol. Simmons</persName>,<lb/> the last, as I\n                                        have recently found out, is now in\n                                                  <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName>, then<lb/> I\n                                        think I can transmit this copy to him. As I wrote to you\n                                        in<lb/> that letter you have not yet received, the following\n                                        have discontinued:—<lb/>\n                                        <persName>Abraham Din Kelsfial</persName>,\n                                                  <persName>Goldberg</persName>,\n                                                  <persName>Mark</persName>,\n                                                  <persName>Mark</persName>,\n                                                  <persName>Rosenberg</persName>,\n                                                  <persName>Sale</persName>,\n                                                  <persName>Hy<lb/>man</persName>,\n                                                  <persName>Zilberman</persName>,\n                                                  <persName>Uhlman</persName>, <persName>E.\n                                                  Bamberger</persName>, <persName>Moses\n                                                  Lieberman</persName>, and<lb/> if I am not\n                                        mistaken, <persName>J. Lieber</persName>. You see,\n                                        therefore, that almost all<lb/> your subscribers here, while\n                                        they do not look down upon your<lb/> periodical, hate to\n                                        give up the $3. Since I received altogether five<lb/> copies\n                                        which have not been called for, I cannot tell you in\n                                        detail<lb/> up to the present moment. For the same reason, I\n                                        have not yet collected<lb/> much. For I should very much\n                                        like to see, the economical gentlemen<lb/> accepting the new\n                                        copies before they pay for the old—and thus become\n                                                  <add>?</add><lb/>......Believe me, dear\n                                                  <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> that I have taken\n                                        a great deal of<lb/> trouble with these people, as much as\n                                        you yourself would have taken, but<lb/> not I nor even our\n                                        teacher <persName>Moses</persName> could change these\n                                        people. As I<lb/> told you, I have two new\n                                                  subscribers—<persName>B.

After receipt of the next\n                                        issue<lb/> I shall unhesitatingly collect and send it to you\n                                        as soon and as<lb/> much as possible. I should very much\n                                        like to write some pleas<add>?</add><lb/> news to you, but\n                                        the circumstances, as you will see, do not per<lb/>mit it.\n                                        Perhaps in my next letter, I'll be able to do so. My<lb/>\n                                        wife and children send kindest greetings.
