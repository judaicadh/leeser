I\n                                        am a Jew; and thank God[?]<lb/> gloring in being such; not\n                                        one, though, who cares not for the faith; but desirous<lb/>\n                                        of diving into those mysteries, that cannot possibly, by any\n                                        human being,<lb/> to solved; yet, the object, which, some\n                                        may try to obtain.
