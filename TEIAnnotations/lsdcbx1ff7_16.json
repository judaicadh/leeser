The fact is, that<lb/> infidelism and\n                                        indifference have taken such root here, that, I<lb/>\n                                        apprehend they will never be <sic>erazed</sic>.\n                                                  <persName>Pozenanski</persName> left a<lb/> deep,\n                                        venomous string behind him which is calculated to\n                                        poison<lb/> the latest generations. You can form an idea of\n                                        the <placeName>Charleston</placeName><lb/> orthodoxy, when\n                                        ever <add>שחיטה</add> is neglected. Our Shochet is an old\n                                        man,<lb/> whose nervous temperament, together an occasional\n                                        attack<lb/> of Rheumatism causes his hands to tremble\n                                        considerably, which<lb/> according to our Law, disqualifies\n                                        him from being <add>שוחט</add> and yet<lb/> with all my\n                                        efforts, I could not induce the congregation even<lb/> to\n                                        have him examined, although he has not been examined for<lb/>\n                                        <hi rend=\"underline\">many</hi> years, and has had almost\n                                        every year a severe spell<lb/> of sickness. I know he is\n                                        incapable. Besides, he never examines the<lb/> lungs by\n                                        sight, he is satisfied by putting his hands in the\n                                        animal<lb/> and declaring <add>כשר</add>, a proceeding which\n                                        is entirely against<lb/> law, as it is an impossibility for\n                                        any man, no matter how proficient<lb/> he may be, to declare\n                                        an animal to be <add>כשר</add> without examining it<lb/>\n                                        closely, <add>למראה עיניו ישפוט רק</add>. Many other things\n                                        have transpired lately<lb/> which convince me that Orthodoxy\n                                        is loosing ground rapidly,<lb/> And that the congregation\n                                        Shearit Israel may soon die an<lb/> untimely death. I think\n                                        nothing can save it, and if matters<lb/> remain as they are,\n                                        and as they will probably be, my stay here will be</p>"
