It grieves me to write in so dolorous a strain, and yet it is\n                a<lb/> relief to unto<add>?</add> myself to one who knew me in happier days, and\n                who<lb/> can sympathize in my distresses. You have so much to endure that I<lb/> am\n                almost ashamed to make your heart ache with the recital of my troubles.<lb/> God's\n                will be done! A wise, merciful and loving Father watches over us; He<lb/> knows what\n                is good for us. Therefore while acknowledging with fortitude<lb/>\n                <add>כי כל על פטרו אמת</add>—my watchword in the conflict with the world and<lb/>\n                adverse circumstances is <add>קוה אל ה' חזק והאמון לבך</add>. This upholds me; and\n                the<lb/> thought that if I suffer in this life, there will be less to undergo\n                hereafter<lb/> gives me cheerfulness in the darkest moments.</p>\n            <p>I am truly thankful for your counsel, and cheered by the hopes you hold out that I\n                may<lb/> yet do something in the states should I determine on quitting this\n                place.<lb/> This year will solve the problem whether I remain or not. My wife's<lb/>\n                state of health will, unless she can be cured in another country which I<lb/> doubt,\n                under her incapable of superintending a boarding school, and a<lb/> daily one is,\n                with the <sic>accesibility</sic> of Jewish children to the American<lb/> schools,\n                free, gratis, for nothing, out of question. There remains then the<lb/> ancient\n                precedent; but our people have in the Psalmists words <add>ובלעדו א\"א עליהם</add><lb/>\n                <add>ויתערבו בגורם</add>. Their ideas are that the Jewish ministry should be\n                hierarchi-<lb/>cal, and even should any congregation satisfied with my\n                antecedents<lb/> not object to engaging me, my age, for remember I am now <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">50</hi> might<lb/> be an obstacle. I am also rusty from disuse,\n                having now been 4 years<lb/> away from the desk and pulpit. A little hard study\n                might again<lb/> revive my latent powers, and sage experience and calm reasoning\n                supply<lb/> the void caused by the loss of imagination, which nevertheless\n                delights<lb/> popular assemblies whether lay or clerical. There is stuff in me\n                yet.<lb/> For the present, however, I must suspend all action; but will let you</p>"
