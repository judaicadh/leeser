He visited me\n                repeatedly<lb/> and from the tenor of his conversation, I inferred that he has\n                studied well<lb/> both Hebrew &amp; English. Regarding his capacity to fill the\n                situation<lb/> for which he has applied, I am utterly unable to pronounce an<lb/>\n                opinion, for I neither heard him recite the prayers, nor deliver a<lb/> sermon. The\n                two charges brought against <persName>Mr H</persName> would, if<lb/> true, not alone\n                militate against his election, but lower him also in<lb/> the estimation of <hi\n                    rend=\"underline\">all</hi> his coreligionists; I trust therefore that they<lb/>\n                may be proved false. As to myself, I was ignorant of them,<lb/> had I\n                    <sic>deem</sic> it my duty on the contrary to state, that a person, who<lb/> had\n                spoken disparagingly of his character in my presence, has, in a<lb/> letter, which I\n                received last week, retracted his accusation</p>\n            <p rend=\"indent(10)\">Believe me etc.</p>\n        </body>\n    </text>\n</TEI>"
