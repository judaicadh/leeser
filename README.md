# Isaac Leeser Digital Repository

This repository holds the TEI xml files from the Isaac Leeser Digital Repository. We've made two changes to the TEI since it was first uploaded to the Repository in the mid-2000's.
- The reference to the bespoke dtd file in the header was removed and we've made the TEI readable by TEI boilerplate (teibp.xsl).
- The Hebrew text which was not orginially part of the TEI file itself, has been added to the TEI files.
