                    <add>?</add> to accuse you the<lb/> reception and to pray you to writing me that

                <sic>jewish</sic> literature<lb/> you could forward to me. I have read the <hi

                    Aguilar</persName> and your notes with delight; you will have<lb/> received, I

                The most of her<lb/> not-jewish publications are translated in Dutch and they<lb/>
                have been justly admired. I hope to give a translation<lb/> of her Jewish works, and
                the <hi rend="underline">Sabbat-<add>?</add></hi> are nearly<lb/> prepared for the

                political tolerations is nearly to be gained<lb/> in the states general: we will

            <p>for the <hi rend="underline">public</hi> instruction, leaving all liberty to the<lb/>
                communities or particulars to erect special religious institutions.<lb/> There has
                been a party of ultra protestants who decries that<lb/> system as unchristian and
                would have adopted the principle<lb/> of positive christianity even in the lower
                public schools, or<lb/> at least mentioned <hi rend="underline">christian</hi>
                principles in the law. Another<lb/> protestant party, more liberal, has mentioned

                just places of carrying <sic>controverse</sic> or propaganda dogmata;<lb/> the mind
                of the children of all communions being only induced<add>?</add><lb/> to find here
                recommendations to the more general truths of<lb/> all religious confessions,
                leaving it to parents and ministers<lb/> of every confession in particular to give
                religious instruction as they<lb/> believe properly. General truths also, general
                prayers, elevating<lb/> the mind of the little people to virtue and morality,
                without<lb/> dispute or controversies: that is the bases whereupon the<lb/> law now
                in discussion is to be put. The great majority<lb/> of the second Chamber of States
                General has declared<lb/> herself satisfied with that basis; so it will be
                probably<lb/> adopted in the course of some months.</p>
