                    <placeName>Buffalo</placeName></p>
            <p>Living waters from above, and revivifying dew may descend upon the<lb/> dear and
                exalted, the high and eminent, the wonder of <placeName>Jeshurun</placeName>,
                the<lb/> wise and understanding, the great scholar, the excellent rabbi who<lb/> is
                here for praise and glory, our teacher <persName>Isaac</persName>, known by the
                name<lb/> of <persName><sic>Lesser</sic></persName>. Blessed art thou in the Lord,
                thou who art brave</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Although it is a fact that I have not until now succeeded in<lb/>
                becoming one of your friends and acquaintances, nevertheless my<lb/> heart has made
                bold to approach you by means of a letter. For I<lb/> have heard of your reputation
                that you are straightforward with<lb/> respect to your people, and that in your case
                knowledge is mixed<lb/> with the wine of humility, so that you are friendly toward
                every<lb/> intelligent person, without regard whether he is of lowly station<lb/> or
                from among the princes of the earth. Then said I also to myself<lb/> let me come to
                him by way of a letter. For you know about a man<lb/> by the name of
                    <persName>Wise</persName>, who is called a doctor (physician), but is<lb/> no
                more than a barber come to shave <placeName>Israel</placeName>. Now, the other day
                I<lb/> received a letter from a dear friend who lives in the city of<lb/>
                <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName>, in which he tells me about the doings of this man
                and<lb/> of his might, along with a man <persName>Goldstein</persName>, the
                miss-leader of the<lb/> Congregation of <placeName>Louis Ville</placeName>. Both of
                them seek to bring a new<lb/> Religion upon the People of God. Also this man
                    <persName>Wise</persName> publicly<lb/> preached about the commandment of
                Halitza that it is not to be<lb/> observed outside of
                    <placeName>Palestine</placeName>. We know that it is to be prac-<lb/>ticed
                outside outside of <placeName>Palestine</placeName>, but shall this man who never
                studied<lb/> nor ever learned except in a meeting-house of priests, know
                any-<lb/>thing about it? His sort of nonsense was never practiced either<lb/> in or
                out of <placeName>Palestine</placeName>. And like him there are many
                    <sic>corrupters</sic> of<lb/> the Faith. Here is this man
                    <persName>Goldstein</persName> who sings to the glory of<lb/>
                <persName>Wise</persName>, and composed for stanzas of a poem, each of which<lb/>
                begins with a letter of the name of “<persName>Mary</persName>” upon whom the new
                faith<lb/> is built. Of the like kind there are many. My friend also composed<lb/> a
                song about him. Here it is;</p>
            <p><add>Hebrew</add> A new tower and very high</p>
            <p><add>Hebrew</add> Built mostly of his folly and his lies,</p>
            <p><add>Hebrew</add> His hands are long and his teeth uncovered</p>
            <p><add>Hebrew</add> That is the rabbi of <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName> and its
                environs</p>
            <p>My friend spoke at length to me about this acc<del>o</del>ursed man, and he<lb/> also
                prepared a poem for the shame of both of them. He placed
                <persName>Wise</persName><lb/> at the beginning of the poem and
                    <persName>Goldstein</persName> at the end. But I know<lb/> that you, my Master,
                are wise like an angel of God, and you will<lb/> know whether it is well to put this
                poem into your Occident to make<lb/> it known to many. If so, I shall bless you as
                well as the author of<lb/> the poem. I am sure that the words of the poem will
                please you.<lb/> For I am convinced of your goodness and <sic>you</sic> humility,
                and I know<lb/> that you will fulfill my desire, and I shall therefore make an<lb/>
                end to my words.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Thus are ended the words of your servant, the youngest of<lb/> the
                tribes of <persName>Judah</persName>.</p>
