			<p rend="indent(2)">Dear Sir</p>
			<p rend="indent(3)">The Occident for <date>May</date> only<lb/> reached here yesterday afternoon.  I have read<lb/> the first portion of the Biography published&#44; and<lb/> find a few errors which I note elsewhere.  I<lb/> perceive a query has been attached to an extract<lb/> from one of my ancestors &#40;7 lines from <add>&#63;</add>&#41;<lb/>  If this is done purposely&#44; I assure you the<lb/> extract is quite in the good old style&#44; and this<lb/> leads me to ask you to communicate with me<lb/> if you observe anything in the M.S. you do not<lb/> clearly make out or do not wish to publish.<lb/>  I send you herewith another <sic>instalment</sic> that<lb/> you may have time to write me before<lb/> going to press&#44; as I have a weakness in always<lb/> wishing to see my M.S. published without added<lb/> comment.  Private remarks I will always gladly<lb/> receive.</p>
				<p>In printing off the sheets for<lb/> a pamphlet&#44; I trust you will omit the<lb/> headings either &#8220;The Occident&#8221; or &#8220;Biography &#38;c&#8221;<lb/> and insert the proper pages.  I need scarcely<lb/> add that I trust the matter will run on<lb/> so as not to appear having been published<lb/> at intervals.  Although intended for presentation<lb/> to the family &#38; friends of my father <add>&#63;</add>&#44; still<lb/> I would like the Biography to appear in neat</p>
				<p rend="The following is written sideways on the left side of the page.">I have had to delay sending you the MS of the Biography&#44; I am getting it copied at <persName>Mrs<lb/> De Sola&#39;s</persName> leisure &#40;I hate copying&#41; having feared the first part sent you had gone wrong.  I have<lb/> also been closely engaged these last few weeks.</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>form&#44; &#38; as I before said&#44; not as if it had<lb/> appeared in the Occident.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I have made a search for<lb/> some memorandum or record of payment of<lb/> <persName>Mrs Nadpers</persName> Occident a&#47;c and find none.  The<lb/> fact is I never make entries of monies received<lb/> and paid out for others.  I have almost<lb/> invariably paid to <persName>Mr J A Joseph</persName> any amount<lb/>&#8212;and these have been but few&#8212;I have<lb/> received for you&#44; except in one or two<lb/> instances when I sent you money by<lb/> <persName>Mrs Cohen</persName> or <persName>Issak Joseph</persName>.  I went to<lb/> <persName>Mr Joseph</persName> and got his clerk and afterward<lb/> himself to look through his books&#44; but<lb/> found nothing.  He also has not been accustomed<lb/> to make such entires.  As I before wrote<lb/> you I recollect very well <persName>Mrs A.</persName> having<lb/> paid me&#8212;tho&#39; I forgot how much and when.<lb/>  I now find in a list made by <persName>Mr J.</persName> <persName>Mrs<lb/> Nadper</persName> is credited in a memorandum in<lb/> my own writing with payment of &#36;9&#8212;but<lb/> no mention of the amount having been<lb/> remitted you&#8212;this however I have never<lb/> mentioned in any other case.  When you<lb/> send your account for the Prayer books<lb/> please add <persName>Mrs N&#39;s</persName> &#36;9 and I will pay<lb/> you in <hi rend="underline">greenbacks</hi> the amount&#59; i.e. if you<lb/> do not object to receive it in your currency.<lb/>  You ask what <persName>Benjamins</persName> owe.  Here it is.</p>

				<p>to do so today.  I am not quite sure how<lb/> many copies of the <hi rend="underline">Biography in pamphlet</hi> form<lb/> you intend to print.  In one letter you say it will be one hundred<lb/> in another two hundred &#38; fifty.  Your figures<lb/> and &#40;don&#39;t be offended&#41; your writing like my<lb/> own is not always the clearest.  Pray let<lb/> it be two hundred &#38; fifty.  Did you get my letter<lb/> wherein I request you to send the Prayer Books&#44; and<lb/> tell you&#44; you can add in a few Daily Books &#40;Post <add>&#63;</add>&#41;</p>
				<p>I had the honor of giving the address<lb/> to the Graduates of Mc Gill University before the annual convocation on <date>3d</date> inst.<lb/>  It was gratifying to me&#44; the occasion being an universal<lb/> one&#44; and evincing the liberality of the college authorities<lb/> for tho&#39; there are Jewish Professors&#44; I believe no<lb/> one has ever yet been entrusted with giving parting<lb/> moral advice to graduates&#8212;advice one would<lb/> suppose they would insist upon being based on that<lb/> &#8220;formal<add>&#63;</add>&#8221; gospel.  It gave satisfaction&#44; and the<lb/> authorities complemented me asking me for the address<lb/> for publication.  This is the first year they will issue<lb/> all in pamphlet form the proceedings of convocation<lb/> with addresses &#38;c.  The Editor of the Gazette who is<lb/> a Graduate of the university asked me for the address to<lb/> publish in his columns&#44; I send you a copy to transfer<lb/> to the Occident if you think it worth doing so.  The<lb/> remarks are of course applicable to Jewish young men<lb/> and you will see I did not forget the <add>Hebrew</add> on physical<lb/> training&#8212;tho&#39; practically I find Juden too lazy<lb/> to make good athlete.  If I <sic>dont</sic> close you<lb/> <sic>wont</sic> read any more&#59; so farewell for the present<lb/> and let me hear soon from you</p>
