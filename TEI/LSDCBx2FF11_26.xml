            <p rend="indent(2)">Dear Sir</p>
            <p rend="indent(3)">The Occident for <date>May</date> only<lb/> reached here yesterday
                afternoon. I have read<lb/> the first portion of the Biography published, and<lb/>
                find a few errors which I note elsewhere. I<lb/> perceive a query has been attached
                to an extract<lb/> from one of my ancestors (7 lines from <add>?</add>)<lb/> If this
                is done purposely, I assure you the<lb/> extract is quite in the good old style, and
                this<lb/> leads me to ask you to communicate with me<lb/> if you observe anything in
                the M.S. you do not<lb/> clearly make out or do not wish to publish.<lb/> I send you
                herewith another <sic>instalment</sic> that<lb/> you may have time to write me
                before<lb/> going to press, as I have a weakness in always<lb/> wishing to see my
                M.S. published without added<lb/> comment. Private remarks I will always gladly<lb/>
                receive.</p>
            <p>In printing off the sheets for<lb/> a pamphlet, I trust you will omit the<lb/>
                headings either “The Occident” or “Biography &amp;c”<lb/> and insert the proper
                pages. I need scarcely<lb/> add that I trust the matter will run on<lb/> so as not
                to appear having been published<lb/> at intervals. Although intended for
                presentation<lb/> to the family &amp; friends of my father <add>?</add>, still<lb/>
                I would like the Biography to appear in neat</p>
            <p rend="The following is written sideways on the left side of the page.">I have had to
                delay sending you the MS of the Biography, I am getting it copied at
                    <persName>Mrs<lb/> De Sola's</persName> leisure (I hate copying) having feared
                the first part sent you had gone wrong. I have<lb/> also been closely engaged these
                last few weeks.</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>form, &amp; as I before said, not as if it had<lb/> appeared in the Occident.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I have made a search for<lb/> some memorandum or record of payment of<lb/>
                <persName>Mrs Nadpers</persName> Occident a/c and find none. The<lb/> fact is I
                never make entries of monies received<lb/> and paid out for others. I have
                almost<lb/> invariably paid to <persName>Mr J A Joseph</persName> any
                amount<lb/>—and these have been but few—I have<lb/> received for you, except in one
                or two<lb/> instances when I sent you money by<lb/>
                <persName>Mrs Cohen</persName> or <persName>Issak Joseph</persName>. I went to<lb/>
                <persName>Mr Joseph</persName> and got his clerk and afterward<lb/> himself to look
                through his books, but<lb/> found nothing. He also has not been accustomed<lb/> to
                make such entires. As I before wrote<lb/> you I recollect very well <persName>Mrs
                    A.</persName> having<lb/> paid me—tho' I forgot how much and when.<lb/> I now
                find in a list made by <persName>Mr J.</persName>
                <persName>Mrs<lb/> Nadper</persName> is credited in a memorandum in<lb/> my own
                writing with payment of $9—but<lb/> no mention of the amount having been<lb/>
                remitted you—this however I have never<lb/> mentioned in any other case. When
                you<lb/> send your account for the Prayer books<lb/> please add <persName>Mrs
                    N's</persName> $9 and I will pay<lb/> you in <hi rend="underline"
                    >greenbacks</hi> the amount; i.e. if you<lb/> do not object to receive it in

                Pray let<lb/> it be two hundred &amp; fifty. Did you get my letter<lb/> wherein I

            <p>I had the honor of giving the address<lb/> to the Graduates of Mc Gill University
                before the annual convocation on <date>3d</date> inst.<lb/> It was gratifying to me,
                the occasion being an universal<lb/> one, and evincing the liberality of the college
                authorities<lb/> for tho' there are Jewish Professors, I believe no<lb/> one has
                ever yet been entrusted with giving parting<lb/> moral advice to graduates—advice
                one would<lb/> suppose they would insist upon being based on that<lb/>
                    “formal<add>?</add>” gospel. It gave satisfaction, and the<lb/> authorities
                complemented me asking me for the address<lb/> for publication. This is the first
                year they will issue<lb/> all in pamphlet form the proceedings of convocation<lb/>
                with addresses &amp;c. The Editor of the Gazette who is<lb/> a Graduate of the
                university asked me for the address to<lb/> publish in his columns, I send you a
                copy to transfer<lb/> to the Occident if you think it worth doing so. The<lb/>
                remarks are of course applicable to Jewish young men<lb/> and you will see I did not
                forget the <add>Hebrew</add> on physical<lb/> training—tho' practically I find Juden
                too lazy<lb/> to make good athlete. If I <sic>dont</sic> close you<lb/>
