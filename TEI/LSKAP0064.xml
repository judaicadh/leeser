				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>New Orleans</placeName>&#44; <date>Jany. 9<hi rend="sup">Th</hi> 5613 &#40;1853&#41;</date>.</p>
				<p>My dear <addressee>Leeser</addressee>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">At the end of this month&#44; I shall be&#44; like you&#44; an<lb/> ungowned parson&#44; and therefore&#44; I devote myself&#44; before that time<lb/> to the pleasing duty of writing you a few lines&#44; while I can still&#44;<lb/> without opposition&#44; claim the title of Revd.  You are&#44; no doubt&#44; aware<lb/> that applications have&#44; until very recently&#44; been made to me by parties<lb/> in <placeName>Savannah</placeName> and <placeName>Mobile</placeName>&#44; which were declined.  <persName>Mr. Eckmann</persName> did<lb/> not please the folks here&#59; indeed I don&#39;t know who can.  The are very<lb/> willing to employ the best minister possible&#44; but the truth is&#44; they don&#39;t<lb/> want to pay.  They would like <persName>Mr. Touro</persName> to do that duty.  It is quite<lb/> honor sufficient that they have accepted his gift&#44; and having secured<lb/> that effectually&#44; their obligations are ended.  They have been playing<lb/> a farce with me during the last fortnight.  It ended as I foresaw&#44;<lb/> with a positive rejection of their overtures.  When they made their<lb/> proposals&#44; they were&#44; and are still&#44; indebted to me for several months<lb/> services&#59; which there is no likelihood of getting paid&#44; unless out<lb/> of the old gentleman&#39;s pocket.  He is heartily tired of these continued<lb/> draws on his purse&#44; and I will no longer submit to be <del>the</del> a pensioner<lb/> on his bounty&#44; when those who are able to satisfy my claims&#44; lack<lb/> the will and inclination.  Since my engagement in <date>Feby 50</date>&#44; he<lb/> has paid nearly two thirds of my salary.  Last <date>May</date> a great effort<lb/> was made&#44; and a list was subscribed by several&#44; by which offerings were to be abolished tacitly&#44; and a contribution&#44; to cover and include<lb/> seat rents and monthly dues&#44; substituted.  Many of the subscribers&#44; in<lb/> good circumstances too&#44; have broken faith&#59; and those who have kept it&#44;<lb/> now decline to keep to their engagement&#44; because&#44; they justly allege&#44;</p>

				<p>that the <sic>burthen</sic> of maintaining the synagogue ought not to<lb/> devolve on them alone.  What the upshot is to be&#44; time only will<lb/> reveal.  But I can assure you&#44; that however ardent my zeal to<lb/> devote myself to <placeName>Israel&#39;s</placeName> cause&#44; I should be a fool to remain<lb/> here with the prospect of hard labor and no bread to eat.  It is<lb/> certainly harsh to characterize the greater part of the congregation<lb/> as devoid of honor&#44; principle&#44; religion&#44; and gratitude but it is<lb/> nevertheless perfectly true.  I can prove it to be so to you and any<lb/> one&#39;s satisfaction.  <persName>Mr. Touro</persName> has expressed himself satisfied<lb/> with my action and conduct&#59; not so with those of the congregation.<lb/>  Neither the decency and decorum of public worship&#44; nor the advocacy<lb/> and exposition of our faith&#44; have suffered thro&#39; me in this city.<lb/>  The synagogue has not lost a jot of its prestige from the night<lb/> of the consecration until this moment.  This my congregation are<lb/> forced to admit&#44; and&#44; from the documents I send you&#44; which you<lb/> are at liberty to publish in the Occident&#44; if you think fit&#44; they<lb/> are not willing to part with me.  My object in forwarding them&#44; is<lb/> to prove&#44; if necessary&#44; to the Jewish public&#44; under what circumstances<lb/> I have taken leave of the ministry&#44; and with what feelings.  That<lb/> you may understand the whole proceedings&#44; I must confide to you&#44;<lb/> <hi rend="underline">under the seal of secrecy&#44; particulars&#44; which you are not at liberty<lb/> to divulge&#44; except with my consent</hi>.  In <date>February 51</date>&#44; finding that<lb/> there was no desire on the part of the Congregation to pay me my<lb/> salary&#44; them 3 months in arrear&#44; and <persName>Mr. Touro</persName> having until then<lb/> discharged the greater portion&#44; I wrote to him&#44; stating my painful<lb/> position&#44; urging him either to endow the ministry&#44; or to guarantee<lb/> the future payment of my stipend.  The former he positively<lb/> declined&#44; the latter he consented to&#44; for 2 years&#44; but no longer.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">This guarantee expires with this month&#44; and he will not renew</p>
				<p rend="The following number is written at the bottom of the page in pencil."><date>1&#45;9&#45;1853</date></p>

				<p>it.  The congregation knows nothing of this arrangement&#44; but I com&#45;<lb/>municate it to you&#44; under the solemn request&#44; <hi rend="underline">that you will not<lb/> name it to any one</hi>&#44; for the purpose of explaining my real motives<lb/> of retiring.  Duty does not call on me to starve&#59; and the congregation<lb/> with their magnificent offer of &#36;2000 a year&#44; can&#44; but will never<lb/> pay me.  I have no wish to be prejudiced by my people&#44; nor yet<lb/> of exposing my constituents&#59; yet&#44; unless I admit you behind the<lb/> scenes&#44; you will&#44; I am certain&#44; make some comments to my<lb/> disadvantage.  Having revealed the above&#44; you will acquit me<lb/> of any impropriety in sending in my letter of resignation in<lb/> <date>July</date> last.  It was unconditional&#44; because I could not maintain<lb/> myself here on less salary&#44; and <add>it</add> enabled the congregation to engage<lb/> another person at a lower figure.  They saw this at a glance&#44; and<lb/> were glad that I <sic>cancelled</sic> a contract which tied me to them for<lb/> life.  Hence they made no effort to induce me to <sic>recal</sic> my<lb/> resignation&#44; but proceeded to act on it at once.  Application was<lb/> made to you&#44; and on your declining&#44; to <persName>Mr. Echman</persName>.  On his<lb/> accepting the situation at <placeName>Mobile</placeName>&#44; <hi rend="underline">Resolution No1</hi> was passed <add>at a General meeting</add>.<lb/>  I received the committee most kindly&#44; but declined to reengage<lb/> myself until I was assured by a requisition&#44; signed by a large<lb/> majority of the congregation&#44; that they were favourable to my<lb/> reappointment.  The committee admitted the justice of my<lb/> resolve&#44; reported it at the next General Meeting&#44; but when one of<lb/> them moved the appointment of a new committee to wait upon each<lb/> individual member of the congregation&#44; and ascertain the general<lb/> feeling towards me&#44; the motion was voted down by a large majority<lb/> out of 20 members present&#44; and the <hi rend="underline">Resolution No 2</hi> in the second<lb/> committees letter <add>was</add> substituted.  Do not lose sight of the fact&#44; that<lb/> when they passed this Resolution&#44; they owed me over 4 months salary&#59;</p>

				<p>which is not yet liquidated&#44; altho&#39; there is a large amount<lb/> of arrearages due by persons in prosperous circumstances.  My<lb/> letter in reply is <hi rend="underline">No 3</hi>&#59; and you must concede that it is a most<lb/> temperate and dignified one&#44; considering the manner <del>in</del> with which<lb/> they treated my proposal.  I stated to <persName>Mr. Touro</persName>&#44; that if <hi rend="underline">he</hi><lb/> desired to retain me and engage my services I would remain&#59; but that experience of 3 years had shown me that no dependence<lb/> was to be placed in the good faith and honor of the congregation&#59;<lb/> and now&#44; no circumstances&#44; not even a requisition signed by<lb/> every one of them&#44; will induce me to forego my determination<lb/> of leaving.  I return to <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> in end this month&#44; thence to <placeName>Europe</placeName><lb/> where I propose taking up my abode in future.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">And now&#44; my dear <persName>Leeser</persName>&#44; as we may possibly not<lb/> see each other again on earth&#44; accept my most friendly and heartfelt<lb/> wishes for your happiness and success.  In whatever part of the world my future lot <del>will</del> may be cast&#44; I shall be delighted to hear from you<lb/> and rejoice to learn that you are more happy in the decline of life<lb/> than you have been in the meridian.  Your name will be esteemed<lb/> and honored&#44; and your worth acknowledged long after the grass has<lb/> grown over your grave&#44; whilst your detractors will be forgotten as<lb/> tho&#39; they had never been.  My dear wife as usual sends her love&#44;<lb/> and we both request you to tender our regards to our old<lb/> <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> friends.  That this may meet you in health and good spirits is the farewell greeting of</p>
			<p rend="indent(7)">Your old friend &#38; wellwisher</p>
			<p rend="indent(7)"><persName role="author">M N Nathan</persName></p>
				<p>P.S. I will hand to <persName>G. Kursheedt</persName> before my<lb/> departure &#36;9 for 3 yr subscription to the<lb/> Occident up to <date>May 1853</date>.</p>
