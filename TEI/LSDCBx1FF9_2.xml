			<p>I hope that you are home by this time and that your trip <sic>trough</sic> the states<lb/> will have had the effect of improving your health and of <sic>strenghtening</sic> and<lb/> renewing your energies to future spiritual labor.</p>
			<p>I am in possession of your kind letter dated <placeName>St. Louis</placeName> <date>Dec. 18th</date> but fearing the<lb/> answer would not reach you in time&#44; as there <sic>were</sic> no mail&#45;boats <del>g</del> running&#44;<lb/> I thought it advisable to omit it.</p>
			<p>With this letter I mail one to the Asmonean containing a statement of<lb/> the proceedings taken in your behalf&#44; while in this city. I will give you<lb/> on the other side the substance of my correspondence&#44; which would have<lb/> reached <placeName>New York</placeName> long before this&#44; were it not for an approval it had<lb/> to undergo at our Board of Trustees.</p>
			<p>I am inclined to believe that all your subscribers would like to receive<lb/> the Occident for <date>January</date>&#44; as they&#44; or the most of them&#44; are <del>desirou</del><lb/> desirous to know something of your doings in other places also. I<lb/> would therefore humbly advise you to begin with the next number&#44;<lb/> if you deem it expedient and till<add>&#63;</add> up to spirit charge your abane<add>&#63;</add>.</p>
			<p>Please let me hear from you&#44; as soon you are arrived in <placeName>Ph<hi rend="sup">a</hi></placeName><lb/> my wife requested me to give you her best respects.<lb/> <persName>Straus</persName>&#44; <persName>Lirhten<add>&#63;</add></persName>&#44; <persName>Lowensohn</persName>&#44; <persName>Oberudarfer</persName> and all your friends&#8212;and<lb/> there are a good many&#8212;return their heartfelt regard and esteem<lb/> to you.</p>
