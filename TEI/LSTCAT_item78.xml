                in which I am interested with<lb/> my father required so much of my attention<lb/>
                that I had not time to bestow many thoughts upon<lb/> correspondence with my

                    <placeName>Alex<lb/>andria</placeName>. <sic>Shouldst</sic> thou come this way
                again<lb/> when either myself or my father (for I allowed<lb/> him the gratification

                is alive. I hope thou wilt<lb/> call and spend a day or two with us. As<lb/> well as
                I recollect now I knew nothing of thy<lb/> expectation of visiting
                    <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> until my<lb/> cousin <persName>Theos S
                    Pleasants</persName> informed me he had<lb/> requested thou to call upon me on

                subsist<lb/> between us that we do not hesitate to take this<lb/> liberty in regards
                to each other, and it gives me<lb/> as much pleasure to entertain a friend who<lb/>
                comes thus recommended by him, as one whom<lb/> I have invited myself. I was lately
                in <placeName>Phila<lb/>delphia</placeName> and head I known where to call upon</p>

            <p>this would have stolen an hour or two from my<lb/> engagements for the purpose of
                seeing thee. Please<lb/> to inform me when thy residence is so that if<lb/> business
                or inclination should draw me to <placeName>Phila</placeName><lb/> again while thou
                art a resident of it I may<lb/> know where to find them. Thou sayest I<lb/> know to

                P.</persName><lb/> and myself I am pleased with them. It is not<lb/> necessary for
                me to inform them that I do not feel<lb/> bound as thou dost to observe rigorously
                the<lb/> Law as delivered through <persName>Moses</persName> to the children<lb/> of
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>, yet this being thy situation would not say any
                thing against<lb/> a strict obedience to it by all also feel this<lb/> obedience to
                be their duty. I hope there is, I<lb/> know there ought to be, enough good feeling
                in<lb/> my heart to prevent me from regarding as un<lb/>fit for social and all other
                valuable inter<lb/>courses any person who honestly differs from<lb/> me in

                more than he has clearly<lb/> made known to us we ought to perform; there<lb/>fore

                written on<lb/> board of the S. Boat Long Branch has not induced thee to believe I

                an affect-<lb/>ionate heart let me meet with it when I may—As an apology let me
                state<lb/> that business in which I am interested with my father required so
                much<lb/> of my attention that I had not time to bestow many thoughts upon
                corre-<lb/>spondence with my friends—I am sorry it was not convenient for thee

                when either myself<lb/> or my father (for I allowed him the gratification of reading
                thy letters<lb/> to my relation <persName>Thos. S. Pleasants</persName>) is alive, I
                hope thou wilt call and spend<lb/> a day or two with us—As well as I recollect now I
                knew nothing of thy<lb/> expectation of visiting <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>
                until my cousin <persName>Thos. S. Pleasants</persName> in-<lb/>formed me he had
                requested thou to call upon me on thy way thither—Such<lb/> is the intimacy and
                perfect confidence which subsist between us that we do<lb/> not hesitate to take
                this liberty in regard to each other, and it gives me<lb/> as much pleasure to
                entertain a friend who comes thus <sic>recommanded</sic> by him,<lb/> as one whom I

                know where to find thee.<lb/> Thou sayest I know to a certain extent what are thy
