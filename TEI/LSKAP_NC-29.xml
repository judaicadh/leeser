                <persName>Leeser</persName>.</p>
            <p rend="align(right)"><date>Friday, 28th Adar, (April), 1860</date>.</p>
            <p>Very honored friend:</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I have received your worthy letter with a willing soul.
                    <sic>why</sic><lb/> and wherefore have you turned down my important articles
                without telling<lb/> me a word? "Is this the Torah and this its reward?" If I could
                have<lb/> suspected this, I would have offered them to a different publication.<lb/>
                How can your newspaper prosper? In your time it has had a good develop-<lb/>ment.
                You will never be finished with this stuff of <hi rend="underline"><persName><sic>de
                            Sala</sic></persName></hi> at a time<lb/> when the few learned people in
                the world are interested in it. "The dwel-<lb/>ler in heaven laughs", for God hears
                my laughter<add>?</add>. "God mocks them".<lb/> Whom, then, who is interested in
                    <persName>Ellis Joseph's</persName> present gift, who leaves<lb/> his
                congregation like sheep without a shepherd? That's fodder for the<lb/> "Messenger".
                I regret this matter very much. This affair will be old<lb/> news next week. I have
                some more material; especially <persName>Krones</persName>, of
                    <placeName>Bres-<lb/>lau</placeName>, sent me his excellent program for the
                    <persName>Frankel</persName> seminary of <date>January<lb/> 27, 1860</date>, and
                let me say good luck, through you. He gave <persName>Szold</persName> only a<lb/>
                German certificate, for he had not attended the Seminary as a student;<lb/> he only
                lodged with him, but did not study. He has no title <hi rend="underline"
                >Morenu</hi>,<lb/> and certainly not the permission to be a rabbi. He has a <hi
                    rend="underline">Morenu</hi> and,<lb/> perhaps, even a <hi rend="underline"
                    >Semicha</hi> from the ultraorthodox <persName>Rabbi Tiktin</persName> in
                    <placeName>Breslau</placeName>,<lb/> who writes willingly, without knowing
                    <sic>thewarning</sic> of the rabbis. It is<lb/> a case of "A disqualified one
                who makes illegitimate children legitimate".<lb/> So you see again these
                ultraorthodox. There is no fear of God in this<lb/> place, there is no God in
                another place. <persName>Frankel</persName> is hurt by your<lb/> failure to send him
                the "Occident". He will send you his "Monatschrifft".<lb/> He wants to write against
                    <persName>Szold</persName>. In exchange for that German certificate,<lb/>
                <persName>Szold</persName> presented the seminary with an entire set of Talmud.
                "Bribery blinds<lb/> even the wise". <persName>Frankel</persName> mentions him among
                the donors, but only as<lb/>
                <persName>Herr Szola</persName>, preacher in <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, not
                doctor or rabbiner. What does<lb/>
                <persName>Rabbi Abraham Rice</persName> say about this? "The four houses of
                trampling" which</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>developed out of the one which he consecrated—all of them torn apart<lb/> and
                over-pious, occupying themselves with the treatise about Samaritans<lb/> and those
                who fear sexual looseness.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Couldn't you obtain for me, by means of a committee sent to
                    <persName>Mr.<lb/> Hart</persName>, a call for one or two lectures on history,
                over there? Please<lb/> see that it is arranged. "The deed is greater than the
                doer". <persName>Frankel's</persName><lb/> discussion in the program, about
                marriage, is excellent. I would have<lb/> sent it to you, but I am angry. I expect
                that the entire article will<lb/> be printed next week.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Write to me about a lecture. I want to read
                    "<persName>Esther</persName>" for them,<lb/> or about the establishment of the
                Second Temple. Write to me about it.<lb/> Perhaps I could work in the German
                congregation, but only truth and<lb/> peace. I expect an immediate reply.<lb/> Your
                friend,</p>

            <p>In the Portuguese congregation here, an examination for Schochetim took<lb/> place
                here recently, at which <persName>Solomon Joseph</persName> and <persName>Sanat
                    Phillips</persName> were<lb/> chosen as Schochetim and <persName>Rabbi
                    Abraham</persName> as the head of the court. Think,<lb/> should such things
                happen in <placeName>Israel</placeName>? Are these Jews? They appear to<lb/> me like
                Karaites who have Tzizit and T'phillim hanging in the synagogue.<lb/> They may have
                the schochet and the slaughtering knife also in the syn-<lb/>agogue. Stand up the
                former and hang up the latter. The sensible pro-<lb/>posal, to join in with other
                congregations and appoint schochetim who are<lb/> capable, in various parts of the
                city, was turned down, in order that the<lb/> Portuguese Jew who lives in the
                    <placeName>40's (streets)</placeName> should not be forced to<lb/> eat
                slaughtered meat because of the distance. That would be compulsion.<lb/> As it is,
                the schochet stands in his place and we changed the process<lb/> around. The
                slaughtering knife is not placed on the throat, but it hangs<lb/> in the air.
                    <persName>Einhorn's</persName> protest must be welcome to you and to me. He
                has<lb/> made up his mind that that is better. Decision forces decision. Thus<lb/>
                the board will make no further concessions? The <persName>Harts</persName> will not permit<lb/>
                <del>the</del>
                <persName>Lewengut</persName> to represent them. They will attain their ends through<lb/>
                <persName>Einhorn</persName>. Thank him for it. That is the reason why you should
                keep si-<lb/>lent now. Let the others bargain, who opposed your views, such as
                    <persName>Isaacs</persName>.<lb/> "The wise man has eyes in his head, the fool
                walks in darkness". That<lb/> is how it had to be. <persName>Br. Raphall</persName>
