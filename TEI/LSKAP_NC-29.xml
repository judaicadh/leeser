				<p>Very honored friend&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I have received your worthy letter with a willing soul.  <sic>why</sic><lb/> and wherefore have you turned down my important articles without telling<lb/> me a word&#63;  &#34;Is this the Torah and this its reward&#63;&#34;  If I could have<lb/> suspected this&#44; I would have offered them to a different publication.<lb/>  How can your newspaper prosper&#63;  In your time it has had a good develop&#45;<lb/>ment.  You will never be finished with this stuff of <hi rend="underline"><persName><sic>de Sala</sic></persName></hi> at a time<lb/> when the few learned people in the world are interested in it.  &#34;The dwel&#45;<lb/>ler in heaven laughs&#34;&#44; for God hears my laughter<add>&#63;</add>.  &#34;God mocks them&#34;.<lb/>  Whom&#44; then&#44; who is interested in <persName>Ellis Joseph&#39;s</persName> present gift&#44; who leaves<lb/> his congregation like sheep without a shepherd&#63;  That&#39;s fodder for the<lb/> &#34;Messenger&#34;.  I regret this matter very much.  This affair will be old<lb/> news next week.  I have some more material&#59; especially <persName>Krones</persName>&#44; of <placeName>Bres&#45;<lb/>lau</placeName>&#44; sent me his excellent program for the <persName>Frankel</persName> seminary of <date>January<lb/> 27&#44; 1860</date>&#44; and let me say good luck&#44; through you.  He gave <persName>Szold</persName> only a<lb/> German certificate&#44; for he had not attended the Seminary as a student&#59;<lb/> he only lodged with him&#44; but did not study.  He has no title <hi rend="underline">Morenu</hi>&#44;<lb/> and certainly not the permission to be a rabbi.  He has a <hi rend="underline">Morenu</hi> and&#44;<lb/> perhaps&#44; even a <hi rend="underline">Semicha</hi> from the ultraorthodox <persName>Rabbi Tiktin</persName> in <placeName>Breslau</placeName>&#44;<lb/> who writes willingly&#44; without knowing <sic>thewarning</sic> of the rabbis.  It is<lb/> a case of &#34;A disqualified one who makes illegitimate children legitimate&#34;.<lb/>  So you see again these ultraorthodox.  There is no fear of God in this<lb/> place&#44; there is no God in another place.  <persName>Frankel</persName> is hurt by your<lb/> failure to send him the &#34;Occident&#34;.  He will send you his &#34;Monatschrifft&#34;.<lb/>  He wants to write against <persName>Szold</persName>.  In exchange for that German certificate&#44;<lb/> <persName>Szold</persName> presented the seminary with an entire set of Talmud.  &#34;Bribery blinds<lb/> even the wise&#34;.  <persName>Frankel</persName> mentions him among the donors&#44; but only as<lb/> <persName>Herr Szola</persName>&#44; preacher in <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>&#44; not doctor or rabbiner.  What does<lb/> <persName>Rabbi Abraham Rice</persName> say about this&#63;  &#34;The four houses of trampling&#34; which</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>developed out of the one which he consecrated&#8212;all of them torn apart<lb/> and over&#45;pious&#44; occupying themselves with the treatise about Samaritans<lb/> and those who fear sexual looseness.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Couldn&#39;t you obtain for me&#44; by means of a committee sent to <persName>Mr.<lb/> Hart</persName>&#44; a call for one or two lectures on history&#44; over there&#63;  Please<lb/> see that it is arranged.  &#34;The deed is greater than the doer&#34;.  <persName>Frankel&#39;s</persName><lb/> discussion in the program&#44; about marriage&#44; is excellent.  I would have<lb/> sent it to you&#44; but I am angry.  I expect that the entire article will<lb/> be printed next week.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Write to me about a lecture.  I want to read &#34;<persName>Esther</persName>&#34; for them&#44;<lb/> or about the establishment of the Second Temple.  Write to me about it.<lb/>  Perhaps I could work in the German congregation&#44; but only truth and<lb/> peace.  I expect an immediate reply.<lb/>  Your friend&#44;</p>
				<p><persName role="author">Jonah Bondi</persName></p>
				<p>In the Portuguese congregation here&#44; an examination for Schochetim took<lb/> place here recently&#44; at which <persName>Solomon Joseph</persName> and <persName>Sanat Phillips</persName> were<lb/> chosen as Schochetim and <persName>Rabbi Abraham</persName> as the head of the court.  Think&#44;<lb/> should such things happen in <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#63;  Are these Jews&#63;  They appear to<lb/> me like Karaites who have Tzizit and T&#39;phillim hanging in the synagogue.<lb/>  They may have the schochet and the slaughtering knife also in the syn&#45;<lb/>agogue.  Stand up the former and hang up the latter.  The sensible pro&#45;<lb/>posal&#44; to join in with other congregations and appoint schochetim who are<lb/> capable&#44; in various parts of the city&#44; was turned down&#44; in order that the<lb/> Portuguese Jew who lives in the <placeName>40&#39;s &#40;streets&#41;</placeName> should not be forced to<lb/> eat slaughtered meat because of the distance.  That would be compulsion.<lb/>  As it is&#44; the schochet stands in his place and we changed the process<lb/> around.  The slaughtering knife is not placed on the throat&#44; but it hangs<lb/> in the air.  <persName>Einhorn&#39;s</persName> protest must be welcome to you and to me.  He has<lb/> made up his mind that that is better.  Decision forces decision.  Thus<lb/> the board will make no further concessions&#63;  The <persName>Harts</persName> will not permit<lb/> <del>the</del> <persName>Lewengut</persName> to represent them.  They will attain their ends through<lb/> <persName>Einhorn</persName>.  Thank him for it.  That is the reason why you should keep si&#45;<lb/>lent now.  Let the others bargain&#44; who opposed your views&#44; such as <persName>Isaacs</persName>.<lb/>  &#34;The wise man has eyes in his head&#44; the fool walks in darkness&#34;.  That<lb/> is how it had to be.  <persName>Br. Raphall</persName> called the <persName>de Sola </persName>&#34;en soof&#34;.</p>
