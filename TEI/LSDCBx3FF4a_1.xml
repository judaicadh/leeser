				<p rend="align(right)"><date>Tuesday&#44; Rosh Hodesh Sivan&#40;May&#41;&#44; 1863</date>.</p>
				<p>Peace and all that is good&#44; forever&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">If some cure were found for my weak nerves&#44; my low<lb/> spirits&#44; and for my bitter feelings&#44; it would be a letter from you&#44;<lb/> you&#44; an appointed officer and honored in your place. But when you<lb/> begin to complain even more what shall I say &#63; Unfortunately&#44;<lb/> you have no insight.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I am very grateful to you for your frankness when you<lb/> say that <persName>Pappe</persName> is my friend. I did not expect anything else. Not<lb/> because of my mitzvoth&#44; nor because of my situation&#44; but a learned<lb/> man like me is revolted by such pseudo&#45;learning. Unfortunately&#44;<lb/> this type of <sic>Cnazan</sic> constitutes the majority of conservative Ju&#45;<lb/>daism. Orthodoxy is an artificial&#44; a Jesuitical thing. I am<lb/> proud to say that I spurn orthodoxy&#44; for I want the true Judaism&#44;<lb/> such as our sages have received and transmitted through the Oral<lb/> Law&#44; and such as our children should receive&#44; as I said last <date>Sun&#45;<lb/>day</date> at a meeting for the establishment of a Sunday school. You<lb/> must admit that through the work of such people&#44; who do nothing for<lb/> the education of the children&#44; must have as a result that Judaism<lb/> will die with us. Will <persName>Pappe&#39;s</persName> children know anything about a Tal&#45;<lb/>mud&#63; Will they know what the mitzvoth from the Torah are&#63; Or<lb/> mitzvoth of the rabbis&#63; Is it not a great&#44; brazenness on the part<lb/> of <sic>sucha</sic> man to rely purely upon customs and to stick his head be&#45;<lb/>tween hills and mountains while the learned and righteous people<lb/> of the world in <placeName>Germany</placeName> are astonished at my work&#63; Does he under&#45;<lb/>stand anything&#44; even with regard to ordinary meanings of the Talmud&#44;<lb/> the Mishnah&#44; idol&#45;worship&#63; Yes&#44; I consider myself among those<lb/> about whom our sages&#44; may their memory be for a blessing&#44; said&#44; &#8220;All<lb/> that a good student is destined to being forth as a novelty&#44; etc.&#8221; I<lb/> insist upon holding on to the old&#44; but in order to save something<lb/> from the shipwreck which may at all possibly be saved&#44; I shall&#44; if</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>necessary&#44; always go as far as our <hi rend="underline">Shulchan Aruch </hi>and <persName>Maimonides</persName> go.<lb/> That is the boundary&#44; As far as which I&#44; as a learned man who under&#45;<lb/>stands to read between the lines&#44; must follow with his spirit. That<lb/> is self&#45;evident. I tell you if nothing happens for Conservative Ju&#45;<lb/>daism&#44; everything is lost&#44; and all&#44; except those who now life in fear<lb/> of eternal punishment&#44; will go over to the camp of the enemy. Inside<lb/> the synagogue&#44; they want to be called pious. Inside their houses&#44;<lb/> they eat trefah and violate the <date>Sabbath</date>. Here it is a terrible thing<lb/> to see. Unfortunately&#44; people do not understand how to &#8220;increase the<lb/> Torah and glorify it&#8221;. You&#44; too&#44; refused to understand how to proceed<lb/> with wisdom and intelligence. If you do understand how to accomplish<lb/> much&#44; it does not seem to be on the practical side. Unfortunately&#44;<lb/> the statement of the great <persName>Rabba</persName> is not sufficiently well&#45;known.<lb/> &#8220;He who forgoes his own qualities&#44; all his sins are removed.&#8221;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">When people who do not know the words of our sages&#44; mis&#45;<lb/>take the unessential for the essential&#8222; I do not hold it against them.<lb/> They know no better. It is preferable that they should hold on to<lb/> the unessential in order that he essential should not be forgotten.<lb/> But when one sees that the important ones of <placeName>Israel</placeName> throw the Torah<lb/> overboard and maintain silly customs only for the sake of gain&#44; only<lb/> to act hypocritically&#44; then one must weep for the destruction of our<lb/> holy Torah. These people do not know and do not understand what it<lb/> means&#44; &#8220;Desecrate one <date>Sabbath</date> in order that you may be able to observe<lb/> many <date>Sabbaths</date>&#8221;. I can tell you for your own satisfaction&#44; you&#44; the<lb/> Portuguese who has cast aside the comments of <persName>Rabbi Moses Isserlein</persName><lb/> &#40;RaMA&#41; which are holy to me&#44; that in my small community&#44; <hi rend="underline">Emunei Israel</hi>&#44;<lb/> I have had recited the counting of the <hi rend="underline">Omer</hi>.... on the other hand&#44; I<lb/> insist that there be no idle conversation&#44; no business talk&#44; and such<lb/> like.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I will not say about myself that I have a fuller insight</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">2.</p>
				<p>in the learning that God granted me. I say &#8220;The fear of thy teacher&#44; etc.&#8221;<lb/> &#8220;The Torah of my teachers and my superiors&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;The fear of heaven&#8221; &#8212;<lb/> &#8220;A man&#39;s livelihood is set for him&#8221;. And so I trust in God and must<lb/> complain that a man like you who is known as a God&#45;fearing man should<lb/> have so little influence. I may be writing to a good friend and I ex&#45;<lb/>pect that you will deal kindly with me... but it is not possible to<lb/> remain inactive.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I should like you to send this letter to <persName>Jacob Friedman</persName>&#44;<lb/> the Mohel. You will receive through the post either one set of holi&#45;<lb/>day prayer books or <sic>&#63;&#63;</sic>. The house is easy to find. <persName>Pappe</persName> knows it.</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">Your servant ready to serve you&#44;</p>
