				<p rend="align(center)"><placeName>Charleston</placeName>&#44; <date>June 10 1856</date>.</p>
				<p><addressee>Rev&#58; Isaac Leeser</addressee>&#44; <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName></p>
			<p rend="indent(5)">Dear Sir&#44;</p>
			<p rend="indent(7)">Your kind<lb/> letter&#44; dated <date>June 5</date>&#44; reached me yesterday&#44; and I hasten to reply<lb/> to it at once&#44; in order to remove all unfavorable impressions from your<lb/> mind&#44; which&#44; judging from the contents of your letter&#44; seems to rest<lb/> thereon.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Let me begin with the passage in my correspondence to <persName>Dr Ph&#39;s</persName><lb/> &#8220;Zeitung des Judenthums.&#8221;  When I read your remarks in the letter<lb/> to me&#44; I laughed very heartily&#59; but perceiving afterwards&#44; at the<lb/> perusal of your Editorial in the <date>June</date> number of the <hi rend="underline">Occident</hi>&#44; that<lb/> you took the affair more than serious&#44; I at once determined to make<lb/> some explanations to you&#44; as I do not wish to be misjudged by you.<lb/>  Know then&#44; the clause &#8220;<add>&#63;</add><lb/> <add>&#63;</add>&#44;&#8221; is not mine&#44; but <persName>Dr Ph&#39;s</persName>.  The sentence con&#45;<lb/>tained in my manuscript&#44; runs thus&#58; &#8220;mit <add>&#63;</add><lb/> <add>&#63;</add>.&#8221;  It appears to<lb/> me that <persName>Dr Ph.</persName> Made this change&#44; which&#44; by the way&#44; I do not approve&#44;<lb/> with the view of having <persName>R. Hirsch</persName> kept out of the controversy.  I<lb/> hope that his candid explanation will satisfy you&#59; since it can<lb/> be no discredit to you&#44; to be compared with <persName>R. Hirsch</persName>&#44; whose<lb/> sincerity of principles and honesty of purpose&#44; no one&#44; not even<lb/> his fiercest opponents can question.  But here I must<lb/> complain of your translation.  In rendering the clause&#44; &#8220;In<lb/> <add>&#63;</add>&#44;&#8221; by &#8220;I will admit&#44; with<lb/> sincerity&#44;&#8221; you did not do justice to the spirit of my words.  My</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>intention was&#44; most emphatically to repeat what I have often told you and<lb/> others&#44; that you belong to those very few in our midst&#44; <del>that</del> who are sin&#45;<lb/>cerely &#38; honestly orthodox&#59; to use your own words&#58; &#8220;whose practice does<lb/> not belie their theory.&#8221;  But your translation of my words does<lb/> not convey the emphasis and sincerity contained therein&#59; as it shows&#44;<lb/> it admits the construction of ambiguity&#44; even sarcasm and irony.<lb/>  I should have translated in this way&#58; &#8220;which&#44; however&#44; are in&#45;<lb/>deed sincere.&#8221;  Now&#44; I do not only authorize but even request you<lb/> to notice my explanation in your next issue&#44; as I am never so<lb/> self&#45;conceited or proud&#44; to give explanations&#44; where justice demands<lb/> them&#59; besides&#44; the picture which you have drawn of a Polish<lb/> Rabbi would certainly be such a reflection on you&#44; as I would<lb/> be indeed the last to conceive or <sic>indorse</sic>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">You speak&#44; furthermore&#44; of scurrilous remarks having been<lb/> made before about you in <persName>dr Ph&#39;s</persName>. Gazette.  You later under a great<lb/> mistake I have never found any.  On the contrary&#59; <persName>Dr Phs.</persName> in<lb/> not<add>&#63;</add> your Bible&#44; rebutted those that had indulged in<lb/> such remarks in this country&#44; especially <persName>Mr. Kalish</persName>&#44; as I wrote<lb/> you at the time&#59; upon which you told me&#44; that you showed <persName>Dr<lb/> Ph&#39;s</persName>. Remarks to the former&#44; and took him thus by surprise&#44; so<lb/> that he did know what to say.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I think you are wrong in not publishing my report&#59; for the<lb/> reasons you give&#44; hold not good.  You forget that the works are<lb/> not those of <persName>Dr Ph.</persName>&#44; but of the &#8220;<hi rend="underline">Institute</hi>&#44;&#8221; and he has no<lb/> right to dispose of them&#44; as he can do with his own&#59; I regard<lb/> this &#8220;<add>&#63;</add>&#8221; as a real national affair&#44; which every Jew<lb/> ought to <sic>patronise</sic>.  I have myself to pay subscription&#44;<lb/> although I am the agent for <placeName>America</placeName>.  And so had <persName>Dr<lb/> Einhorn</persName> to pay his &#36;1.65.&#95;&#95;Apropos of <persName>Dr E.</persName> <hi rend="underline">You</hi> have</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>certainly no right to complain of his not visiting any synagogue in<lb/> <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>&#59; pray&#44; have you ever passed the threshold of a &#8220;Temple&#63;&#8221;<lb/>  Besides&#44; <persName>Dr E.</persName> was but once in <placeName>Phila.</placeName> since his arrival at <placeName>Balti&#45;<lb/>more</placeName>&#44; and then only on account of the death of a niece of his.  You<lb/> see that it is not right&#44; to judge so harshly.  He is certainly as<lb/> sincere &#38; consistent in his views&#44; as you&#44; in yours&#59; and such<lb/> qualities we ought to respect in <hi rend="underline">every one</hi>.  Now&#44; that I am<lb/> liberal&#44; I proved again on the <date>2d</date> day of <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; when I visited<lb/> the new Polish Synagogue in this city&#44; and read the <add>Hebrew</add>&#33;<lb/>  Can you assert such liberality on your part&#63;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">As regards <persName>Mr J&#39;s</persName> Articles&#44; he may write as long as he pleases&#44;<lb/> I do not even glance at them&#59; I do not even hold him in contempt&#44;<lb/> I pity the man&#44; he has fallen so deep&#44; that he is no longer<lb/> within my reach.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><hi rend="underline">Several</hi> copies of your small bible have been purchased for our<lb/> Sunday&#45;School&#44; and more will be bought&#44; when the funds allow it&#59;<lb/> for I am determined&#44; that the Christian version should be banished<lb/> from the school.  Any how&#44; we bought more&#44; than the <hi rend="underline">Orthodox</hi> Con&#45;<lb/>gregation&#44; that has no more a Sabbath&#45;School&#44; thanks&#44; as I<lb/> was told&#44; to the praiseworthy exertions of the orthodox <persName>Mr. Jacobs</persName>.<lb/>  I myself bought the <hi rend="underline">first</hi> copy from <persName>Mr Hart</persName> for my own<lb/> private use&#44; and urge&#44; on every occasion&#44; upon my Congregat&#45;<lb/>ors&#44; to relinquish the common Bibles&#44; and buy yours.  And<lb/> I think&#44; several have followed my advice.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">When I told you that I deferred my reply to your letter of <date>Febr.</date>&#44;<lb/> because I <del>did not</del> wished to avoid the appearance of influencing<lb/> you&#44; I meant to say&#44; that I did not wish&#44; <hi rend="underline">you</hi> should think that<lb/> I <hi rend="underline">intended</hi> to influence you&#44; altho&#39; I <hi rend="underline">knew</hi> very well&#44; that no man<lb/> could do it.  But&#44; again&#44; I did not wish&#44; that you should <hi rend="underline">think</hi> of such</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>an attempt on my part.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">As regards the gentlemen in <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName>&#44; I certainly know them as<lb/> well as you do&#44; &#38; perhaps a little better&#44; which is also the reason<lb/> why I am anxious to force them to explanations or show the people<lb/> who &#38; what they are.  I have followed them very closely&#44; and attentively<lb/> studied their history.  The could not bear that I&#44; too&#44; should have<lb/> come out against them&#59; they forgot that nothing on earth can in&#45;<lb/>fluence me&#44; when Truth &#38; Justice are concerned.  &#8220;Fiat justitia&#44;<lb/> pereat mundus&#8221; is my principle.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The <sic>inclosed</sic> book is sent to <persName>Rev. Mr Isaac Leeser</persName>&#44; not the<lb/> Editor of the Occident.  The collection consists partially of original compos&#45;<lb/>itions&#44; partially translations&#44; furnished by members of the congregation &#38;<lb/> <del><hi rend="underline">yourself</hi></del> your humble servant.  Whatever may be your opinions<lb/> with regard to the use of English hymns in the synagogue you<lb/> will find nothing un&#45;Jewish in this book&#44; which I hope&#44; tho&#39;<lb/> it be <add>Hebrew</add> in your eyes&#44; will not be regarded as unworthy of a<lb/> place in your library.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">As you have concluded your letter with a Latin salutation&#44; I must<lb/> conclude mine in Greek&#44;</p>
			<p rend="indent(10)"><add>Greek</add></p>
			<p rend="indent(10)"><persName role="author">Dr M Mayer</persName></p>
				<p>P. S. Please send me 2 copies of <persName>Mendelsohn&#39;s</persName> Jerusalem.<lb/>  I shall settle with you&#44; <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; in <date>July</date>&#44; when I intend visiting the<lb/> <placeName>North</placeName>&#44; and&#44; of course&#44; seeing you in <placeName>Philada.</placeName></p>
