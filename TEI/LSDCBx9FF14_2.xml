				<p>To the <addressee>Revd. Isaac Leeser</addressee>&#44;</p>
			<p rend="indent(5)">My dear sir&#44;</p>
			<p rend="indent(7)">The establishment<lb/> of public journals&#44; and periodicals by the Jews in <placeName>Europe</placeName> and<lb/> this country&#44; must be productive of much good&#44; not only in<lb/> advocating&#44; and <sic>illucidating</sic> our holy faith&#44; but in collecting<lb/> and disseminating information on &#8220;the dispersed of <placeName>Israel</placeName>.&#8221;<lb/>  Under this impression I have been induced to prepare&#44; and forward<lb/> for publication in your valuable journal&#44; &#40;what I regret to say<lb/> is but&#41; an imperfect historical sketch of the Jews&#44; and Hebrew Congregation in<lb/> this city.  The Colony of <placeName>Georgia</placeName> was settled in <date>1732</date> under the auspices<lb/> of <persName>General Oglethorpe</persName>&#44; whose &#8220;strong benevolence of soul&#8221; was<lb/> sung by <persName>Pope</persName>&#44; and commented upon by all the good&#44; and great men<lb/> of his day.  The end&#44; and aim of those who settled <placeName>Georgia</placeName> was charity&#44;<lb/> in its widest&#44; and most extended sense&#44; and the motto on the<lb/> seal of the Trustees&#44; spoke but the language of truth.  <hi rend="underline">Now sibi</hi>&#44;<lb/> <hi rend="underline">sed aliis</hi>.  Not for ourselves&#44; but for others.  A Colony springing into<lb/> existence under such auspices&#44; with a fertile soil&#44; and a genial<lb/> climate&#44; soon became an Asylum for the oppressed of every<lb/> land&#44; and every faith.  The door was open wide to all&#8212;land was<lb/> granted to each emigrant&#44; and toleration raising its broad&#44; and<lb/> ample&#44; banner&#44; proclaimed to all&#44; entire freedom of conscience.<lb/>  Under these circumstances it was to be expected that the Jew<lb/> with no country&#44; &#8220;<hi rend="underline">but the grave</hi>&#44;&#8221; would speedily seek that land<lb/> where &#8220;under his own vine&#44; and his own fig tree&#44;&#8221; he might<lb/> worship the God of his Fathers&#44; &#8220;with none to molest&#44; or make him<lb/> afraid.&#8221;  Accordingly we find that as early as <date>1733</date>&#44; about forty<lb/> Jews sailed from <placeName>London</placeName>&#44; or in the language of the original<lb/> memorandum &#40;kept in hebrew&#44; and still preserved in this<lb/> city&#41; &#8220;voluntarily embarked from <placeName>London</placeName>&#44; and paid their passages&#8221;<lb/> &#8220;thence to this country&#44; and arrived in <placeName>Savannah</placeName> in the state&#8221;<lb/> &#8220;of <placeName>Georgia</placeName>&#44; on the <date>eleventh day of July 1733</date>.&#8221;  The following are</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>the names of those Jews&#44; who&#44; thus early found a home in<lb/> the new colony of <placeName>Georgia</placeName>&#44; <hi rend="underline">towit</hi>&#44; <persName>Benjamin Sheftall</persName><lb/> and wife&#44; <persName>Dr. Nunes</persName>&#44; and his mother&#44; <persName>Moses Nunes</persName>&#44; <persName>Daniel<lb/> Nunes</persName> and <persName>Shem Nunes</persName>&#44; their servant <persName>Isaac Nunes Henriques</persName><lb/> and wife and son.  <persName>Raphael Bernal</persName> and wife&#8212;<persName>David Olivera</persName><lb/> <persName>Jacob Olivera</persName>&#44; and wife&#44; and three children.  <persName>Aaron Depevia</persName><lb/> <persName>Benjamin Gideon</persName>&#44; <persName>Jacob Crosta</persName>&#44; <persName>David L. Depass</persName> and wife&#44;<lb/> <persName>Mr. Veneral</persName>&#44; <persName>W. Molera</persName>&#44; <persName>David Miranda</persName>&#44; <persName>Jacob Miranda</persName>&#44;<lb/> <persName>David Cohen</persName>&#44; and wife&#44; son&#44; and three daughters&#44; <persName>Abram<lb/> Minis</persName> and wife&#44; and two daughters&#44; <persName>Simeon Minis</persName>&#44; <persName>Jacob<lb/> Gowell</persName>&#44; and <persName>Abram D&#39;Lyon</persName>.  Of these emigrants&#44; the<lb/> <persName>Sheftalls</persName>&#44; <persName>Minis&#39;</persName> and <persName>D&#39;Lyons</persName> remained in <placeName>Georgia</placeName>&#44; and then<lb/> numerous descendants are still inhabitants of our city&#44;<lb/> many of whom have and still do occupy offices of<lb/> honor&#44; profit and trust.  I have no means of ascertain&#61;<lb/>ing what has become of the others.  We have every reason to<lb/> know that even in this land of strangers <placeName>Israel&#39;s</placeName> God was<lb/> not forgotten&#44; but that here amidst savage Indians&#44; and<lb/> in <placeName>Georgia&#39;s</placeName> dark forests the great <hi rend="underline">J Am</hi> was worshiped<lb/> and in the same language in which <persName>Abram</persName> and <persName>Isaac</persName>&#44; and<lb/> <persName>Jacob</persName> prayed&#44; which was heard on <placeName>Sinai</placeName>&#44; and in the gorgeous<lb/> temple of <persName>Solomon</persName>&#44; and in which the inspired men of<lb/> God poured forth their prophecies.  We have however no<lb/> earlier <hi rend="underline">record</hi> than the <date>29 of August 1790</date>&#44; on which day we<lb/> find a resolution&#44; &#8220;that application be made to his Excel&#8221;&#61;<lb/>&#61;&#8220;lency the Governor to incorporate this congregation as a&#8221;<lb/> &#8220;Body politic by the name of Mickva Israel&#44;&#8221; and accor&#61;<lb/>&#61;dingly a charter of Incorporation was granted on the<lb/> <date>30 November 1790</date>.  The Jews however&#44; as a congregation&#44;<lb/> had prior to their incorporation assembled regularly in<lb/> a private house&#44; on the <date>Sabbaths</date>&#44; and holy days and there<lb/> worshiped God according to the forms&#44; and faith of their<lb/> ancestors&#44; and subsequently a room was rented for<lb/> that purpose.  But on the <date>19th day of April 1820</date> the<lb/> corner stone of a place for public worship was laid<lb/> with appropriate ceremonies on a lot which had been<lb/> previously granted to the Jewish Congregation by the<lb/> corporation of the city.  This building was completed</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>and consecrated and used for public worship according<lb/> to the forms of the Portuguese Jews&#44; until <date><sic>december</sic> 1827</date> when<lb/> it was consumed by fire.  This calamity left the Jews with&#61;<lb/>out a place of worship&#44; and they had recourse again to a<lb/> rented room.  In <date>1837</date> they opened a subscription among their<lb/> fellow citizens by which they raised the sum of eleven<lb/> Hundred Dollars&#44; which with the money received from the<lb/> insurance on the Synagogue destroyed by fire&#44; and private<lb/> contributions&#44; they were enabled in <date>1838</date> to erect the neat brick<lb/> temple&#44; which you consecrated to the service of Almighty<lb/> God on the <date>24th of February 1841</date>.  The Jews in this city have<lb/> never had the means of <hi rend="underline">employing</hi> a regular Hazan&#44; or rather<lb/> such an one as would suit them&#44; and whenever service<lb/> has been performed&#44; it has always been done <hi rend="underline">gratuitously</hi> by<lb/> some member of the Congregation.  But they are not unmind<lb/>ful of the all&#45;important subject&#44; and with commenda&#61;<lb/>ble zeal are now taking steps to ensure &#40;at no distant<lb/> day&#41; to themselves&#44; and their posterity&#44; the blessing&#44; and the<lb/> comfort of a spiritual teacher.  Foremost in this work of<lb/> love&#44; and faith&#44; have been <placeName>Israel&#39;s</placeName> daughters&#44; upon whose<lb/> efforts&#44; the blessings of a beneficent God have rested.<lb/>  To aid in this object of obtaining a permanent fund from<lb/> which the Hazan may be supported&#44; the Jewish ladies<lb/> determined on giving a Fair&#44; and in <date>March</date> last put<lb/> their plan in execution.  They were nobly sustained by<lb/> <hi rend="underline">every Christian sect</hi> in this city&#44; and realized more than<lb/> sixteen Hundred Dollars&#44; which has already been profitably<lb/> and safely invested.  That spirit of charity which pre&#61;<lb/>sided at the birth of our colony still reigns and sheds<lb/> its benign influence over the hearts of our Christian<lb/> friends&#44; and on this occasion&#44; charity was seen in all<lb/> its loveliness&#44; and felt in all its heavenly force&#8212;pre&#61;<lb/>&#61;judice&#44; and sectarian <sic>intollerance</sic> stood rebuked and<lb/> abashed&#44; and the heart of the Jew was gladdened by the<lb/> tender sympathy&#44; and open handed charity of the<lb/> Christian.  Although not strictly within the scope of this<lb/> communication&#44; yet I can not suffer the occasion<lb/> to pass by without acknowledging with heart felt</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>gratitude&#44; the kindness and liberality of our Jewish Brethren<lb/> abroad.  We received contributions from <placeName>Canada</placeName>&#44; <placeName>New York</placeName>&#44;<lb/> <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>&#44; <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>&#44; <placeName>Richmond</placeName>&#44; <placeName>Georgetown</placeName>&#44; and <placeName>Charleston</placeName>.  Nor<lb/> must we fail to remember that we were also aided by<lb/> some of our people in <placeName>Bordeaux &#40;in France&#41;</placeName>&#44; and in <placeName>Liver&#61;<lb/>pool</placeName>&#44; and <placeName>Hackney</placeName> in <placeName>England</placeName>.</p>
				<p>Such&#44; sir&#44; is&#44; &#40;as I have already said&#41; an imperfect sketch of the<lb/> history of the Jews in this city&#44; and I may add with pride<lb/> and thankfulness to God that they have always been a<lb/> respected and useful body of citizens.  They defended their<lb/> country&#44; and its liberties in the war of the Revolution&#44; and<lb/> their names may be seen among the founders of<lb/> every charitable&#44; and literary society in this city&#44; and<lb/> in return they have received the most unasked<lb/> and undeviating kindness and liberality from their<lb/> fellow citizens.  At this very time the city Judge&#44;<lb/> and Sheriff are Jews&#8212;the collector of the Post is a<lb/> Jew&#44; and a Jew occupies a seat in the Legislature of<lb/> the State from this city&#44; and is a member of the Board<lb/> of Aldermen&#44; besides other offices of minor im&#61;<lb/>portance which are filled by Jews.<lb/>  In conclusion&#44; I would invoke the blessings of<lb/> Heaven on that city whose <del>house loved God</del> characteristic virtues are<lb/> charity and Liberality.</p>
