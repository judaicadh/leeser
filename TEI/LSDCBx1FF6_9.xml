                              <p rend="indent(2)">I have somewhat altered my mind as regards
                                        the<lb/> article I lately sent you for the Occident. As I
                                        have not heard from<lb/> you on this subject up to present
                                        date, I conclude you intend publishing<lb/> it. I have
                                        determined however, if you have not yet published it,
                                        not<lb/> to let it remain as first written and therefore
                                        must beg you to make<lb/> the following alterations in it
                                        (i. e. if you want it). I was so bothered<lb/> when I sent
                                        it you that I had but little time or attention to

                                        made a kind of promise to furnish several <add>?</add>
