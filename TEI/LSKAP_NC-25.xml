            <p>May he go up upon the heights of good fortune<lb/> and find deliverance from all the
                evils of the<lb/> time, etc. etc. my dear and accomplished friend,<lb/>
                <persName>Rabbi Itzik Leeser</persName>.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Almost three months have passed since I<lb/> received your very
                welcome letter for which I owe you<lb/> an answer. I blush with shame over this
                delay,<lb/> and beg your forgiveness for it. Your correspon-<lb/>dence with your
                trusted friend, <persName>Shaftstone</persName>, with<lb/> which you honored me, has
                increased tenfold my<lb/> respect for you and I shall never fail to reveal,<lb/>
                whenever it be possible, this high esteem and re-<lb/>spect by word or deed. For the
                most part the cause<lb/> of my prolonged silence has been the following:<lb/> you
                suggested to me that I must prepare myself<lb/> for an attack of even greater men
                than <persName>Ben Yehuda</persName> and <persName>S. A.</persName>,<lb/> for I
                considered it unworthy to reply to their<lb/> stupid criticism. I was anxious for
                the publication of<lb/> the apology (or explanation) which I had sent to you,<lb/>
                in order to see the criticism which would follow it.<lb/> Now I have the pleasure to
                see my article in <del>your</del> two<lb/> monthly issues. While the second month's
                issue was not<lb/> yet here we already received in the "Asmonean" a<lb/> translation
                of it in English. I understand nothing<lb/> about this, but my son-in-law,
                    <persName>Mr. Widenthal</persName>,</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p rend="align(center)">2</p>
            <p>who is a mater of both languages, told me<lb/> that it was a good translation, except
                for one<lb/> point, namely, the expression "For the sake of making<lb/> her angry"
                was not translated in the meaning I in-<lb/>tended to give it. Now the
                    <del>intro</del> editorial note says<lb/> that the next issue will contain their
                comments.<lb/> I look forward to these with eagerness, for I was<lb/> never afraid
                and am not afraid now of this thing.<lb/> But three weekly issues have already
                    <sic>appeered</sic><lb/> in <placeName>New York</placeName> and not a line about
                this. <del>That you</del><lb/> As to the matter of your <del>advice</del> desire not
                to print the omitted<lb/> point with regard to <persName>Kalisch</persName>, we
                shall for the moment<lb/> declare a truce, until the matter is further
                clarified.<lb/> In reality he deserves no consideration. I hope<lb/> one other point
                will come to my defense—namely<lb/> that I know I have not acted contrary to
                Biblical<lb/> law.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Among other things, you write that I have<lb/> won much, in that my

            <p>think such thoughts! As our sages said, "A<lb/> man should always be among those who
                are<lb/> insulted"* And <persName>Rabbi Meir</persName> says, "Always<lb/> always be
                thou lowly in spirit." But know, my<lb/> dear brother that, "He who takes a ritual
                bath<lb/> while he has a reptile in his hand, the ritual<lb/> bath is invalid".
                (According to Talmudic law,<lb/> touching a reptile makes one unclean and a man<lb/>
                requires a ritual bath in order to make himself clean<lb/> again. <persName>S.

                considered pure by God<lb/> and man. "Who is the strong man? He who con-<lb/>trols
                his desire, and is master of his spirit."<lb/>
                <persName>Solomon</persName>, the wisest of all men said, "Guard<lb/> your heart

                not<lb/> bring the dear woman under the wings of God?<lb/> (Why didn't you make a
                proselyte of her? <persName>S. G.</persName>) And<lb/> in this way you could easily
                have stopped up the<lb/> mouth of all those who spoke evil and could<lb/> have dwelt
                without quarrel and undisturbed<lb/> with the men of your congregation. Forgive

                The parents need<lb/> supply only <del>the cost of</del> expenses, lodging,<lb/> and
                books. I shall do the rest without<lb/> pay and conscientiously. If there bye
