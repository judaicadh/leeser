          <p rend="indent(1)"><placeName>Philadelphia</placeName></p>
          <p rend="indent(2)">My dear Friend</p>
          <p rend="indent(4)">I can very readily excuse<lb/> you for what I began to think was a little piece<lb/> of neglect on your part in delaying to write me a long<lb/> note that I know what was the cause one which I<lb/> regalled much to hear&#44;&#33; <add>Hebrew</add> you are not to <add>&#63;</add><lb/> yourself for a <add>Hebrew</add> It is true that in no period<lb/> of their existence nationally&#44; did our brethren stand in greater<lb/> need of instruction and of being aroused to a due sense of their<lb/> duty than now&#44; and therefore&#44; I still continue to say <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> but do not let your health suffer by so doing&#44; why not take<lb/> a little recreation&#63; Why not take a trip into <placeName>Montreal</placeName> this summer&#63;<lb/> Do you wait for a formal invitation&#63; Here is one for you there<lb/> &#8220;The <persName>Rev Abraham deSola</persName> sees also many other friends will be most<lb/> happy to see the <persName>Rev Isaac Leeser</persName> in <placeName>Montreal</placeName> during the present<lb/> summer&#44; when&#44; should the <persName>Rev. I L.</persName> determine upon coming&#44; they<lb/> will <sic>will</sic> endeavor to make the arrangements which<lb/> will enable him to pass his time as pleasurably as it is possible<lb/> to do in so outlandish a place &#8221; Please excuse the pink edged<lb/> not paper&#44; but seriously&#44; dear Friend&#44; I think that a trip to<lb/> <placeName>Canada</placeName> would do you much good&#44; and I shall be delighted to see<lb/> you&#44; to find you a room&#44; to show you my books&#44; and &#40;probably&#41;<lb/> to grovel with you over their contents.</p>
			<p>Receive my best thanks for your kindness in inserting the long<lb/> notice of my lecture&#44; I have not the least doubt as to the party<lb/> who sent it&#44; He <hi rend="underline">is</hi> an esteemed friend of mine&#44; and one I believe<lb/> with whom you are also well acquainted but as you don&#39;t<lb/> mention names I shall not.</p>
			<p>You misunderstand me as regards the <add>Hebrew</add>. My object was<lb/> to publish it in the same way as <persName>English&#39;s</persName> book was republished<lb/> in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> It would have been an anonymous publication&#8212;<lb/> this I think I neglected to tell you&#44; as I write in haste&#44; My<lb/> object was further&#44; to <add>&#63;</add> from you as the person most<lb/> able to inform me&#44; whether there were reading Israelites enough<lb/> in <placeName>America</placeName> to pay for the printing of the book&#44; not to<lb/> make it a course of profit&#44; that of course I would not expect.<lb/> I know as well as you &#40;excuse nay indulgence&#41; that neither<lb/> pudding nor fame was to be derived from it&#44; but such</p>
		<pb n="2"/>
			<p>is my estimation of the work&#44; that I think it would do<lb/> a great deal of good&#44; were it generally known. I did not at all<lb/> expect&#44; my dear Friend&#44; that you would gather subscriptions<lb/> To repeat your own words &#8220;That figure is out of the question.&#8221;<lb/> I only <add>&#63;</add> open for what you have readily given me<lb/> your advise&#44; and co&#45;operation. Many thanks for your<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> as to fishing in troubled waters. I am well convinced<lb/> I can assure you of the value &#38; truth of what you say&#44; but in<lb/> case of being attacked by some of our christian friends &#40;which I<lb/> think would be unlikely&#44; the publication being anonymous<lb/> I would always be in possession of the <add>&#63;</add> provide&#41; by some<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> of controversial writers on our side the auction so that<lb/> at all events I should have the means if not the capability to<lb/> give them drubbing for drubbing. I have no wish however as<lb/> I know my own &#40;insufficiency&#44; to enter into controversial<lb/> disputation&#44; and if I desired to give to the public some of my<lb/> translations <hi rend="underline">as my own</hi> and which I have by me I<lb/> certainly would not choose the <add>Hebrew</add> but rather my <hi rend="underline">humble</hi><lb/> renderings of our <hi rend="underline">Rabbinical</hi> writers&#44; I am more attached to them<lb/> than to Lituanian<add>&#63;</add> Caraibes<add>&#63;</add> and always was so. Tell me&#44; how<lb/> would you like to receive some of these translations for<lb/> publication in the Occident&#44; and then&#44; before the matter is distributed<lb/> print off <sic>seperately</sic>&#44; say 500 copies of them I paying the difference<lb/> and receiving the books or you <sic>takeing</sic> those with me in the profits<lb/> and leaving the proportionate expense. The difference could not<lb/> be very great as there would be but little alteration to be<lb/> made in the matter before it is distributed and merely<lb/> the expense of paper &#38; press work. I am sure I could dispose<lb/> of many in <placeName>England</placeName> <add>&#63;</add>. I have promised to<lb/> contribute to the Occident and I don&#39;t know why one should<lb/> not derive mutual benefit from the course first proposed&#8212;</p>
			<p>Please understand me&#44; I do not mean that the <add>Hebrew</add> should<lb/> so appear&#44; but smaller works such as the <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> translations of<lb/> which I have made although not completed. <sic>Dont</sic> think<lb/> either that it is a mania for printing which leads me<lb/> to propose this but receive it as a casual thought the<lb/> value and practicability of which you are yourself to<lb/> determine in your next communication. But let me</p>
		<pb n="3"/>
			<p>remind you&#44; that selections from the writings of <persName>Maimonides</persName> were<lb/> published by <persName>Bernard</persName>&#44; though not those which I have.<lb/> The book sold well among christians and even among Jews<lb/> no doubt because the author was a chestiuvuad<add>&#63;</add>.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">You will ere this have received the first <sic>instalment</sic> of my<lb/> promised article on the settlement of the Jews in <placeName>England</placeName>. It<lb/> is a dark subject and perhaps you and your readers may say<lb/> a profitable one&#44; but it is one which I was compelled to write<lb/> in my lecture on the Jews of <placeName>England</placeName> and you have it in <add>&#63;</add><lb/> form. The Sermon or the <add>Hebrew</add> you will perceive is<lb/> one of a series therefore if you have not already published<lb/> it and will press it back a month or so&#44; inducting the<lb/> Enquiry &#8220;instead&#44; I will send you one or two others on the<lb/> same subject. With the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> <sic>instalment</sic> of the &#8220;Enquiry&#8221; some<lb/> you <sic>you</sic> will have enough of my scribbles has at least<lb/> 3 Occidents to come i.e. If you reckon the Sermon and<lb/> publish the <sic><hi rend="underline">instalments</hi></sic> separately if you print them<lb/> together pray let me know for I am quite in the dark as to your<lb/> proceedings as we get the Occidents so late here&#44; but not<lb/> here only. Why should <persName>Mrs Joel</persName> of <placeName>London</placeName> say she had not<lb/> received any for the last 3 months. Prenez garde&#44; Monsieur le<lb/> Redacteur&#33; Thanks for the aptra<add>&#63;</add> she sent me. I shall<lb/> &#40;in return&#47;&#41; expect the same favor every time any papers of<lb/> mine may be inserted. I send you a report &#40;or rather a<lb/> digest of one since it would be inconvenient to send so much<lb/> paper&#44; of the first years operations of our society. If you<lb/> <sic>dont</sic> feel inclined to publish all the <add>&#63;</add> names<lb/> it contains&#44; pray do not&#44; but just say &#39;an those will that<lb/> &#8220;there follow the names&#8221; The committees wanted to give the people enough<lb/> but I think the feel stated should be quite sufficient. I am quite pleased with <persName>Mrs Jacob<lb/> Joseph</persName>&#44; lately arrived among us&#44; and indeed so<lb/> are all here. She is extremely amiable and intelligent<lb/> I regret much that I have not been able to see her<lb/> as often as I could wish. Preuis<add>&#63;</add> le temps viendra<lb/> Pray do not allow so long &#38; time to intervene</p>
		<pb n="4"/>
			<p>before writing again By the way&#44; your letter is dated<lb/> <date>1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> June</date> and I did not receive it till the <date>27<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> with<lb/> the Occidents. Stand when you write&#44; write fully.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">Now dear friend farewell for the present<lb/> with earnest prayers for your perfect health and<lb/> general welfare believe me</p>
          <p rend="indent(4)">Very truly yours</p>

			<p>A lady &#40;<persName>Miss Miriam Belisario</persName>&#41; formerly a pupil<lb/> of mine has lately published a Hebrew &#38; English <add>&#63;</add><lb/> advertised in the day to Jewish papers as <add>Hebrew</add> &#38; he<lb/>she wishes that she has sent me a copy&#44; but<lb/> having entrusted it to some person to <add>&#63;</add> me&#44; who<lb/> was going out to <placeName>Canada</placeName> I have not yet seen it.<lb/> I would otherwise have written a review &#40;for the sake of<lb/> old acquaintanceship&#41; for the Occident. If you feel<lb/> disposed to resign the post of honor&#44; or <sic>dont</sic> intend<lb/> writing one&#44; pray send me the books per first<lb/> opportunity and I will endeavor to do the<lb/> needful.</p>
