				<p rend="The following paragraph is written in small handwriting above the main letter."></p>
				<p>I cannot enter particulars but I had reason to think so as that Dictator is known to me to belong as much to our unprejudiced<lb/> school as any.  &#8220;We speak and write mostly according to the different passions &#38; emotions which agitate us.  And those objects<lb/> which strike us most forcibly represent themselves in a lively manner to our imagination&#44; and thus determine us to that<lb/> side&#8222; <persName>Dr Pin Stru<add>&#63;</add></persName> with the supposed wrong I broke forth with my expressions.  They were more a censure against the<lb/> dissension <del>created in</del> widened&#8212;then <add>&#63;</add> approbation&#44; of the dissension which by earth acts<lb/> was caused.  The whole if expressed would have been &#8220;what all this tunnels&#44; this <sic>anathemising</sic>&#44; why not<lb/> rather<add>&#63;</add> conciliate.  The opinions of preaching about or against messiah&#44; is a censure<lb/> against <persName>P.</persName> &#40;I wish to know whether have they original you know my hand writing<lb/> and can identify it&#44; before doing so&#44; it is not fair to send it forth as I have no means to ascertain&#44; and<lb/> every reason to question their honesty.</p>

			<p rend="indent(1)">Your enclosed letter&#44; I found but last night taking out the proof<lb/> in haste the letter must have dropped.  I thank for proof&#44; for letter and your kind<lb/> advice.  My letter to <persName>P.</persName> is written in such a careless manner as even you<lb/> must have some proofs&#44; a copy of it I have not.  The word aerial<lb/> does not seem to be original after ideal seems to be an insertion<lb/> for my letter ideal stands opposed to practical.  Could not you claim<lb/> the original&#63;  The contents of his own petition cards denies a <add>&#63;</add><lb/> <add>&#63;</add>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The letter was written under the impression&#44; that the Congr are considered<lb/> as no more being Jews for their Synag&#58; reformer &#38; for the abrogation<lb/> of <add>Hebrew</add> <add>see top</add> and so in my haste&#44; I placed<add>&#63;</add> myself as champion when<lb/> I ought to have heard first.  It now serves me right.  But this<lb/> is <sic>incontestible</sic> and in due time will be stated that I in presence<lb/> of the Trustees&#44; &#38; at the House of <persName>Mr Moise</persName>&#44; and with God<lb/> for <add>&#63;</add> 3 hour warmly protested against 2d day <add>&#63;</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> and this is meant in my letter in <date>July</date> occid<lb/> &#8220;admissible on the letter of the law&#44; but not so on the score<lb/> of charity &#38; piety.  I have not admitted it as right&#44; though it may be legend<lb/> With regard to <persName>Nusser</persName> the case is the same <persName>Mr Ab. Moise</persName>&#44; with<lb/> also appear when required.  Let the volcano first destroy itself.<lb/>  Strange that there are men who can condone that of opposed Drs views&#44;<lb/> and none is more that will say he heard me in private or in pulpit<lb/> preach any thing that is not quite called on.</p>
				<p>To his creed I never gave consent&#44; I knew nothing of his changes<lb/> as little as any body else&#44; I only read about the word <add>Hebrew</add></p>

				<p>I allow all to be as it is.  And supposing I had changed my<lb/> views&#44; or had been inconsistent <persName>Poznanski&#39;s</persName> Gents ought<lb/> to idolize me&#44; had not their Prophet done such tricks and thereby<lb/> gained their attachment of respect.  The best is told them<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> prove that his words ought not be so much attended to as the <add>&#63;</add> expected<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> go on.  The letter contains nothing of moment facts fr&#58; first day<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> What induces you to advise me to go to <placeName>Engl.</placeName>  I am justified<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> and qualified to take any orthodox congreg.  This reform Synag is<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> <sic>a</sic> Orthodox as any other.  Reform has nothing to do with orthodoxy<lb/> never did I preach any but orthodox principles&#44; and the<lb/> congreg wanted such&#44; on this ground even <persName>Mr Wise</persName> was<lb/> elected.  This was held forth in a speech on the occasion of<lb/> his election by <persName>Mr Moise</persName>.  Though it displeased <persName>P.</persName> the congreg<lb/> want such.  <persName>P</persName> and his disciples are of no weight at all when<lb/> the question is Judaism.</p>

In what sense I applied it<lb/> is proved by my controversy 2d day after my arrival.<lb/>  I reiterate my thanks for your valuable services<lb/> you will oblige me with<lb/> 20 copies again&#44; if not <sic>to</sic> late I remain <sic>gratefuly</sic></p>

It is he who some few weeks ago was mentioned in<lb/> the <sic>asmonean</sic> to have stayed at <persName>Dr Adlers</persName> House in <placeName>London</placeName>.  <persName>Dr F</persName> is one of the most<lb/> famed men in <placeName><sic>germany</sic></placeName>.  <placeName>Berlin</placeName> wished to elect him as Rabbi&#44; this failed in the despo<lb/>tism of <placeName>Prussia</placeName>&#44; he wanted some restriction under which the clergy labor re..<lb/>moved&#44; government would not do so.

The revolution broke<lb/> out and so the affair is dropped.  <persName>Dr J.</persName> is a strict orthodox man.<lb/>  There is no <add>Hebrew</add> at all.

When you wrote so harshly against me some time ago<lb/> I could have easily come out and shown you <hi rend="underline">that nothing</hi> that has<lb/> been done in the Synag is against our Relig. or against any <hi rend="underline">din</hi>&#44; but I would<lb/> have been obliged to show it to the world.  And <sic>If</sic> I can do no better than<lb/> fear<add>&#63;</add> how <add>Hebrew</add> might be produced&#63;  For if the <add>Hebrew</add> various<lb/> it they will soon here and <sic>and</sic> there from a desire of innovation etc<lb/> roughly attack all that is holy&#44; as was done here.  Men who know<lb/> no 2<add>&#63;</add> who neither know nor practice any Relig at all became<lb/> reformer&#44; green girls scold the Rabbis at vote for or against creeds<lb/> and so I will rather be thought to <hi rend="underline">be</hi> wrong than to <hi rend="underline">do</hi> wrong</p>
