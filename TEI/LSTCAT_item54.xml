                hand, and its contents noted, I do<lb/> not know what could have been more
                acceptable<lb/> to me than a few lines from a friend, I say a friend!<lb/> from the
                fact, that the tenor of the epistle evinced<lb/> the very strongest marks of true
                friendship, the <sic>lieniency</sic><add>?</add><lb/> that you have professed on
                your part shall not be abused<lb/> by me, although at this time I am compelled to
                take advan<lb/>tage of it, my situation has been such for the last few<lb/> years
                past and up to the present time, that my income<lb/> has been barely sufficient for
                to maintain my large<lb/> family, But thank God I think that my prospects<lb/> are
                brightening. I regret exceedingly that circum-<lb/>stance has placed me unable to
                meet the first note<lb/> that is part due, but hope to be able soon to do<lb/>
                something for you. I hope your health is improving<lb/> we all should like to see
                you here, concerning<lb/> the “Occident” I shall try my best to disseminate<lb/> it
                you may depend upon, the folks here lack that<lb/>

                Hazan, he is not the man that we expected to get, as<lb/> to his qualifications for
                a teacher he cannot be excelled<lb/> but he is no Hazan, nor will he ever make
                one</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>he is by no means the man that I expected, after<lb/> bargaining with him for $500
                the first year as Hazan &amp;<lb/> teacher whilst he was in
                    <placeName>Europe</placeName>, and he agreeing to<lb/> come on and perform the
                functions for that term, it<lb/> turns out that he never has been accustomed to
                read<lb/> in our Minhag and can't read, not having the tunes<lb/> but wants to
                demand a salary of $500 for each<lb/> office saying that was the way he understood
                it,<lb/> the letters I wrote to him were the most explicit<lb/> and his answer goes
                to show that he understood<lb/> them precisely the way I intended, and not
                alone<lb/> that I sent the Printed advertisement from<lb/> the Occident to him so
                that there would be<lb/> no misunderstanding about the matter, but of<lb/> no avail,
                he is one of those <hi rend="underline">noble Polanders</hi><lb/> and wants to
                continue my communications to suit<lb/> his purposes, One thing I may say safely
                that<lb/> there is the greatest unanimity about the<lb/> matter we all think alike,
                and I as secretary<lb/> sustained as to the correctness of my correspondence<lb/>
                with him whilst in <placeName>Europe</placeName>, I regret that after<lb/> all our
                trouble that our efforts will prove abor-<lb/>tive, but it can't be helped, I was in
                hopes<lb/> that all would go on smoothly. He delivered<lb/> several prayers in the
                House of Delegates, which was<lb/> listened to with much attention, I expect that
