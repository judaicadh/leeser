			<p rend="indent(2)"><sic>your</sic> highly esteemed favour of the<lb/> inst came to hand&#44; and its contents noted&#44; I do<lb/> not know what could have been more acceptable<lb/> to me than a few lines from a friend&#44; I say a friend&#33;<lb/> from the fact&#44; that the tenor of the epistle evinced<lb/> the very strongest marks of true friendship&#44; the <sic>lieniency</sic><add>&#63;</add><lb/> that you have professed on your part shall not be abused<lb/> by me&#44; although at this time I am compelled to take advan<lb/>tage of it&#44; my situation has been such for the last few<lb/> years past and up to the present time&#44; that my income<lb/> has been barely sufficient for to maintain my large<lb/> family&#44; But thank God I think that my prospects<lb/> are brightening.  I regret exceedingly that circum&#45;<lb/>stance has placed me unable to meet the first note<lb/> that is part due&#44; but hope to be able soon to do<lb/> something for you.  I hope your health is improving<lb/> we all should like to see you here&#44; concerning<lb/> the &#8220;Occident&#8221; I shall try my best to disseminate<lb/> it you may depend upon&#44; the folks here lack that<lb/> <sic>that</sic> energy for reading</p>

			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>he is by no means the man that I expected&#44; after<lb/> bargaining with him for &#36;500 the first year as Hazan &#38;<lb/> teacher whilst he was in <placeName>Europe</placeName>&#44; and he agreeing to<lb/> come on and perform the functions for that term&#44; it<lb/> turns out that he never has been accustomed to read<lb/> in our Minhag and can&#39;t read&#44; not having the tunes<lb/> but wants to demand a salary of &#36;500 for each<lb/> office saying that was the way he understood it&#44;<lb/> the letters I wrote to him were the most explicit<lb/> and his answer goes to show that he understood<lb/> them precisely the way I intended&#44; and not alone<lb/> that I sent the Printed advertisement from<lb/> the Occident to him so that there would be<lb/> no misunderstanding about the matter&#44; but of<lb/> no avail&#44; he is one of those <hi rend="underline">noble Polanders</hi><lb/> and wants to continue my communications to suit<lb/> his purposes&#44; One thing I may say safely that<lb/> there is the greatest unanimity about the<lb/> matter we all think alike&#44; and I as secretary<lb/> sustained as to the correctness of my correspondence<lb/> with him whilst in <placeName>Europe</placeName>&#44; I regret that after<lb/> all our trouble that our efforts will prove abor&#45;<lb/>tive&#44; but it can&#39;t be helped&#44; I was in hopes<lb/> that all would go on smoothly.  He delivered<lb/> several prayers in the House of Delegates&#44; which was<lb/> listened to with much attention&#44; I expect that the<lb/> event of an Israelite opening a legislature with<lb/> prayer&#44; stands <sic>unparralled</sic> in the world&#44; and<lb/> I am proud that old <placeName>Virginia</placeName> has let this noble</p>
