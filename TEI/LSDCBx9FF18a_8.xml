            <p rend="indent(1)">My revd &amp; dear friend</p>
            <p rend="indent(4)">I have been waiting on <persName>Mr Touro</persName><lb/> or rather
                in hopes of receiving his orders, to break the protrac<lb/>ted silence which has too
                long ruled between us. And now<lb/> anticipating early cause for writing you again I
                still essay<lb/> to explain in part the reasons for my late neglect towards<lb/>
                you. Heavy blows have been <sic>levelled</sic> at your humble<lb/> friend since this
                pleasure was lastly indulged in; wrongs<lb/> have borne down in unmeasured strides
                &amp; at times my<lb/> very spirit has failed me. But the Lord is merciful &amp;
                altho'<lb/> my trials have been moulded into an ordinary casting, yet an<lb/>
                eluding faith, &amp; resignation to what is permitted in the<lb/> infinite wisdom of
                God, have enabled me thus far to rise<lb/> superior to the machinations of the
                evil.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Presuming that you have heard of the<lb/> treachery of my late
                partner who has acted like the most<lb/> heartless <sic>vilain</sic> (for I consider
                him beyond comparison<lb/> with anything that I have ever seen or heard or read of)
                robbing<lb/> me of thousands, most inhumanly too, I hope that you<lb/> have made
                great allowances for the lack of exhibition<lb/> of that respect which had
                previously been my wont in<lb/> my intercourse with you. Verily my good friend I
                have<lb/> suffered but thanks to the Supreme, my national Jewish<lb/> feeling has
                held firm midst incessant whirlwinds &amp; storms<lb/> which, each, as they arise,
                seemed to bring inevitable destruc<lb/>tion to my every hope in life. You will
                doubtless excuse<lb/> this awkward introduction to a letter which was intended<lb/>
                to be altogether in a different strain, but, “from the fullness<lb/> of the heart
                the mouth speaketh” &amp; even now a great deal remains<lb/> to be done, ere I can
                feel safe from the fowlers snare, the accomplish<lb/>ment of which God in his mercy
                grant unto me—</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>With regard to congregational affairs I have little new<lb/> to state. When I was
                about to write to you to procure<lb/> some of the inside furniture &amp;c I
                discovered that the<lb/> ceiling of the building was so defective as to be
                really<lb/> dangerous &amp; after some weeks lost in convincing<lb/>
                <persName>Mr Touro</persName> of this he acceded to my wish to have<lb/> it taken
                down. For seven weeks past we have had<lb/> incessant rains &amp; therefore could
                not plaster. The appear<lb/>ance of the cholera (which I am happy to say is now in
                the<lb/> decline) made workmen very scarce, &amp; now I think we<lb/> can not
                consecrate the building before <date>March</date> or <date>April</date><lb/> I hope
                ere many days that <persName>Mr Touro</persName> will tell me<lb/> to order out what
                we require, but he is dreadfully slow<lb/> &amp; the concern has cost him so much
                already that he<lb/> is perhaps to be excused for holding back, particularly<lb/> as
                he gets no very low estimate of the cost of “<hi rend="underline">Sepharim</hi><lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">Bells</hi> &amp;c &amp;c from me. Yet all will come right in
                time<lb/> and you must be patient as I have learned to be.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">After frequent letters between <persName>M N Nathan</persName><lb/>
                &amp; myself I find that he has altered some parts<lb/> of the service at
                    <placeName>St Thomas</placeName>, nothing of great impor<lb/>tance, &amp; that
                he desires more ecclesiastical power<lb/> than is generally allowed a Hazan. I have
