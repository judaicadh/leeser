            <p>Revd. Sir,</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">In justice to our <sic>christian</sic> brethren<lb/> allow me to
                correct an error which your printer<lb/> committed in the publication of my last
                letter I<lb/> am made to say that “our Christian brethren were<lb/> subjected to
                subscribe to the fund raiser for the<lb/> benefit of the Hebrew Benevolent Society,
                the<lb/> fact being that they were <hi rend="underline">unsubjected</hi>, otherwise,
                we<lb/> here were sanguine that, they would willingly &amp;<lb/> readily responded
                to the call to an extent am<lb/>ounting to twelve or fifteen hundred dollars.
                There<lb/> are many of us, <del>subscrib</del> who would hesitate, <del>
                    <add>?</add> deem</del><lb/>
                <del>it unnecessary</del> to call for outside pecuniary aid;<lb/> when our means
                &amp; prosperity has made some<lb/> excellent provisions for the relief of our
                poor<lb/> during this trying season. I wish I could<lb/>
                <add>?</add> equally for its future government, but un<lb/>-fortunately a stand has
                been made against the<lb/> re-election of the retiring president solely based<lb/>
                on his over zeal in enforcing &amp; carrying out<lb/> the laws of the Institution.
                This is injustice<lb/> under the present position of the Society which<lb/> is
                outwardly a new one, with a new constitution,<lb/> laws &amp; name, mainly
                accomplished through<lb/> his motrumentality<add>?</add> and during his
                administration<lb/> I therefore trust that at the coming election (in<lb/>
                <date>Feby</date>) those petty <sic>mischievious</sic> gelouseres<add>?</add>;
                unfor<lb/>tunately too proverbial amongst our dispersal<lb/> stiff-necked race—will
                be as <add>?</add> and<lb/> that the old president will be allowed to
                inaugur<lb/>-ate his new &amp; <sic>praisworthy</sic> farthing. I hope</p>

            <p>you will not deem these comments beyond<lb/> the purpose they are

                attraction of the day. Rich &amp; poor<lb/> vie with each other in seeking the

                orthodox Judaism being implanted in the<lb/> rising generation. Indeed I write

                which still progresses in its slow<lb/> and steady course. I only pray that

            <p>The Sewing Society to which I made a<lb/> reference in my first letter, has just

            <p>(ladies &amp; gentlemen) met to rejoice over it<lb/> with a good supper &amp; dance.—
                It is young<lb/> but useful having during its brief year distri<lb/>-buted over 400
                garments amongst the poor—at<lb/> the supper it was proposed to engraft<add>?</add>
