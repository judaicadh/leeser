				<p rend="align(center)">CIRCULAR&#44;</p>
				<p rend="align(center)">OF THE AMERICAN JEWISH PUBLICATION SOCIETY&#44; TO THE FRIENDS OF JEWISH LITERATURE.</p>
				<p>&#8220;<emph rend="italics">Resolved</emph>&#44; That the Corresponding Secretary be directed to inform the various Congregations&#44; Auxiliary Societies and Individuals&#44; of the<lb/> formation of the Parent Society&#44; and to invite their co&#45;operation.&#8221;</p>
				<p>RESPECTED FRIEND&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The subscriber has the honour of calling your attention to the foregoing resolution&#44; adopted at a meeting of Israelites of<lb/> <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>&#44; held on the <date>ninth day of November</date>&#44; last&#44; for the purpose of forming &#8220;The American Jewish Publication Society&#59;&#8221;<lb/> and takes the liberty of laying before you the principal features of this institution.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The want of books illustrative of our blessed religion has long since been severely felt both in <placeName>England</placeName> and <placeName>America</placeName>&#44; and<lb/> in no department more than in those elementary works&#44; which a parent could with safety place in the hands of his children.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The encouragement hitherto extended to works of this kind&#44; even the most meritorious&#44; has been so small&#44; that very few<lb/> could or would venture in the face of a probably failure&#44; to appear before the Jewish community as authors on Jewish subjects.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">But as association has been found to produce a remarkable degree of success where individual efforts had failed&#44; it was<lb/> deemed highly probable&#44; that if Israelites were to unite for the encouragement of their own literature&#44; they might speedily wit&#45;<lb/>ness many beneficial effects of their union.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">With this view&#44; the above society&#44; of which the subscriber has the honour to be the Corresponding Secretary&#44; was formed by<lb/> the Israelites of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>&#44; for the purpose of encouraging Jewish literature and to diffuse the works which may be published<lb/> under  their direction in every part of the land.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">To show the practicability of the plan&#44; two of those now composing the Board of Managers had printed&#44; as a preliminary<lb/> step towards the organization of the society&#44; two books&#44; one called &#8220;<persName>Caleb Asher</persName>&#44;&#8221; &#40;a reprint of an English work&#44;&#41; and the other&#44;<lb/> &#8220;The Hebrew Tales&#44;&#8221; &#40;taken from the book of that name by the late <persName>Dr. Hurwitz</persName>&#44; of <placeName>London</placeName>.&#41; under the name of the Jewish<lb/> Miscellany&#44; Nos. 1 &#38; 2.  The cost at which these two books were produced&#44; is so low&#44; that we have now not the least doubt&#44;<lb/> that if from twelve to fifteen hundred subscribers can be obtained&#44; at but ONE DOLLAR each per annum&#44; we shall be enabled to<lb/> issue eight numbers of the Miscellany every year&#44; distribute them to the subscribers&#44; set apart a considerable number for distri&#45;<lb/>bution among the poor&#44; and have a surplus to be sold for the benefit of the general fund&#44; besides realizing a surplus in money<lb/> from the contributions of the members and subscribers&#44; whilst every one of these will receive a quantity of literary matter for<lb/> less than he could purchase the same under any ordinary circumstances.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">All that is required is the co&#45;operation of all Israelites who feel an interest in their literature.  We therefore appeal to you<lb/> to use your influence among your friends and the members of your congregation&#44; to establish an auxiliary society to act with us<lb/> for the furtherance of our plan&#44; as pointed out in our constitution&#44; a copy of which accompanies this circular.  The object speaks<lb/> so strongly for itself&#44; that it is deemed unnecessary to make a stronger appeal than the mere statement of the fact of our organ&#45;<lb/>ization&#44; and the assurance of our ability to carry out the object of our union&#44; if we are only supported by the kind countenance<lb/> and contributions of our friends at home and abroad.  It would afford us great pleasure if the Ladies also would form auxiliary<lb/> societies on the plan proposed&#44; as no good work can be perfect while their aid is absent.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">We would also be obliged to you&#44; if you could procure donations to our funds to enable us to proceed for the first year<lb/> without that large number of members which we expect hereafter.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Nos. 1 &#38; 2 of our Miscellany will be forwarded to you upon application to the subscriber&#44; in case you have not already seen them.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Our plan of publication will embrace the whole range of religious literature&#44; and it is our intention to have all our works<lb/> printed with a clear type and on good paper&#44; so as to make them fit to be put in any library.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The Board of Officers of our society for this year&#44; consists of <persName>Abraham Hart</persName>&#44; <emph rend="italics">President</emph>&#59; <persName>Henry Cohen</persName> and <persName>David Samuel</persName>&#44;<lb/> <emph rend="italics">Vice Presidents</emph>&#59; <persName>Joseph L. Moss</persName>&#44; <emph rend="italics">Treasurer</emph>&#59; <persName>Alfred T. Jones</persName>&#44; <emph rend="italics">Recording Secretary</emph>&#59; <persName role="author">Isaac Leeser</persName>&#44; <emph rend="italics">Corresponding Secretary</emph>&#59;<lb/> <persName>Hyman Gratz</persName>&#44; <persName>Louis Bomeisler</persName>&#44; <persName>Leon Hyneman</persName>&#44; <persName>Lazarus Arnold</persName>&#44; <persName>Elias P. Levy</persName> and <persName>Abraham S. Wolf</persName>&#44; <emph rend="italics">Managers</emph>&#59; and <persName role="author">Isaac<lb/> Leeser</persName>&#44; <persName>Abraham Hart</persName> and <persName>Solomon Solis</persName>&#44; <emph rend="italics">Publication Committee</emph>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">You would render an especial favour by replying as soon as convenient to the subscriber&#44; who will be happy to furnish you<lb/> with all other information which you may desire.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In the hope that our association may grow and labour successfully in the spread of the kingdom of our Heavenly Father&#44;<lb/> <placeName>Israel&#39;s</placeName> King and Saviour&#44; in this extensive country&#44; I have the honour to sign myself&#44;</p>
