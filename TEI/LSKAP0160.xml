            <p rend="align(center)">CIRCULAR,</p>
            <p rend="align(center)">OF THE AMERICAN JEWISH PUBLICATION SOCIETY, TO THE FRIENDS OF
                JEWISH LITERATURE.</p>
            <p>“<emph rend="italics">Resolved</emph>, That the Corresponding Secretary be directed
                to inform the various Congregations, Auxiliary Societies and Individuals, of
                the<lb/> formation of the Parent Society, and to invite their co-operation.”</p>
            <p>RESPECTED FRIEND:</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The subscriber has the honour of calling your attention to the
                foregoing resolution, adopted at a meeting of Israelites of<lb/>
                <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, held on the <date>ninth day of November</date>,
                last, for the purpose of forming “The American Jewish Publication Society;”<lb/> and
                takes the liberty of laying before you the principal features of this
                institution.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The want of books illustrative of our blessed religion has long
                since been severely felt both in <placeName>England</placeName> and
                    <placeName>America</placeName>, and<lb/> in no department more than in those
                elementary works, which a parent could with safety place in the hands of his
                children.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The encouragement hitherto extended to works of this kind, even the
                most meritorious, has been so small, that very few<lb/> could or would venture in
                the face of a probably failure, to appear before the Jewish community as authors on
                Jewish subjects.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">But as association has been found to produce a remarkable degree of
                success where individual efforts had failed, it was<lb/> deemed highly probable,
                that if Israelites were to unite for the encouragement of their own literature, they
                might speedily wit-<lb/>ness many beneficial effects of their union.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">With this view, the above society, of which the subscriber has the
                honour to be the Corresponding Secretary, was formed by<lb/> the Israelites of
                    <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, for the purpose of encouraging Jewish
                literature and to diffuse the works which may be published<lb/> under their
                direction in every part of the land.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">To show the practicability of the plan, two of those now composing
                the Board of Managers had printed, as a preliminary<lb/> step towards the
                organization of the society, two books, one called “<persName>Caleb
                Asher</persName>,” (a reprint of an English work,) and the other,<lb/> “The Hebrew
                Tales,” (taken from the book of that name by the late <persName>Dr.
                    Hurwitz</persName>, of <placeName>London</placeName>.) under the name of the
                Jewish<lb/> Miscellany, Nos. 1 &amp; 2. The cost at which these two books were
                produced, is so low, that we have now not the least doubt,<lb/> that if from twelve
                to fifteen hundred subscribers can be obtained, at but ONE DOLLAR each per annum, we
                shall be enabled to<lb/> issue eight numbers of the Miscellany every year,
                distribute them to the subscribers, set apart a considerable number for
                distri-<lb/>bution among the poor, and have a surplus to be sold for the benefit of
                the general fund, besides realizing a surplus in money<lb/> from the contributions
                of the members and subscribers, whilst every one of these will receive a quantity of
                literary matter for<lb/> less than he could purchase the same under any ordinary
                circumstances.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">All that is required is the co-operation of all Israelites who feel
                an interest in their literature. We therefore appeal to you<lb/> to use your
                influence among your friends and the members of your congregation, to establish an
                auxiliary society to act with us<lb/> for the furtherance of our plan, as pointed
                out in our constitution, a copy of which accompanies this circular. The object
                speaks<lb/> so strongly for itself, that it is deemed unnecessary to make a stronger
                appeal than the mere statement of the fact of our organ-<lb/>ization, and the
                assurance of our ability to carry out the object of our union, if we are only
                supported by the kind countenance<lb/> and contributions of our friends at home and
                abroad. It would afford us great pleasure if the Ladies also would form
                auxiliary<lb/> societies on the plan proposed, as no good work can be perfect while
                their aid is absent.</p>
