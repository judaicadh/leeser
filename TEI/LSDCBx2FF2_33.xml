            <p rend="indent(3)">I am in receipt of your esteemed form<lb/> of <date>March 14<hi
                        rend="sup">th</hi></date> and also of a box containing 5 sets festival

                Inst. The Books however were<lb/> not landed till yesterday, as from the tenor of
                your letter, it was<lb/> impossible to imagine there was anything on board for me,
                as not her<lb/> letter of advice nor B/L waqs sent with them. In fact, a few
                days<lb/> after the arrival of the vessel she sailed for a neighbouring port
                and<lb/> while sailing out of the Harbour I learned there was a parcel<lb/> on board
                to my address. I was therefore compelled to await her return<lb/> The Books were in
                good order and have been delivered to the party who<lb/> ordered them. I have sold
                them at fourteen dollars pr set, contenting<lb/> myself with 3⅓ % rather than lose
                the sale. Consequently there is in<lb/> my hands sixty seven dollars fifty cents,
                say $67,50, to your credit<lb/> which shall be very soon remitted. I regret to say,
                that your Bibles<lb/> do not sell quickly, there are but few here who know or care
                any thing<lb/> about Biblical literature, and still fewer who care about an
                English<lb/> Translation. You are indebted to <persName>Elias Lindo's</persName>
                unwearied energy<lb/> for the few already sold. I have neither the time nor the
                strength<lb/> to walk about with a Bible under my arm offering it for a sale. During<lb/>
                <persName>E L's</persName> visit to your city, he must have given you ample
                information respec<lb/>ting this <placeName>Island</placeName>. But even if he has
                not done so, it is too disagreeable<lb/> a subject to enlarge upon. In future unless
                specifically ordered<lb/> I would not recommend you to send any Books here, If I
                can<lb/> sell those on hand minus my commission I will do so, and without<lb/> my
                boasting I would do any thing else in my humble way to serve you,<lb/> but to sell
                books is almost an impossibility here.</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Dutch &amp; French books are obtained and used by many and I am<lb/> I confess,
                surprised, not at the small number you sold, but at the great number<lb/> On a
                future occasion, if you should send any more here, be a little more<lb/> particular,
                about sending notice of shipment, for if in this instance<lb/> the Box and its
                contents, had been lost, the fault would not have<lb/> been mine. How is it no
                Occidents have arrived by the Venus?<lb/> or the Sarah? If you have them ready you
                can send them<lb/> to <persName>Messrs D Appleton &amp; Co.</persName>
                <placeName>N.Y.</placeName> who have to send me some<lb/> books, and they will pack
                    <del>up with</del> them up in the same trunk.<lb/> Excuse the apparent
                negligence of my letter, I am compelled<lb/> to write at night, after
                    <sic>elven</sic> hours of tiresome teaching, and<lb/> my sight begins to fail
                slightly. Do not wonder at my not ordering<lb/> any of your Catechisms &amp; other
                works, my school is not a religious<lb/> one, but licensed by the
                    <placeName>Island</placeName> authorities and except during<lb/> one hour in the
                morning, nothing that can strictly be called<lb/> religion is permitted, the pupils
                consisting of Israelites Protestants<lb/> and Catholics, as in all the other schools
                here, and they are far<lb/> too numerous, to yield any thing like a proper
                remuneration<lb/> for so arduous an employment as teaching. A change<lb/> may take
                place as the <persName>Mahamad</persName> has at last written to
                    <placeName>Holland</placeName><lb/> for a <add>חכם</add>. I had urged this from
                my arrival, as it is really<lb/> lamentable, to see the oldest congregation the W I.
                nay the western<lb/> world, and which formerly had its <add>חכמים</add> and
                    <add>מדרש</add> now without<lb/> either. I am sure there are not six persons in
                the Congregation<lb/> who understand any thing of Hebrew except the mere
                reading<lb/> nor have <del>my</del> they any taste for it. I have done all I could
                to diffuse<lb/> a taste, and my want of success I must attribute to my
                unfitness<lb/> for I do not feel <sic>authorised</sic> to blame <del>others</del>
                the community till<lb/> others better qualified than I have attempted the task, I
                await<lb/> the result and hope it may be successful, tho' the fault rest with me</p>
