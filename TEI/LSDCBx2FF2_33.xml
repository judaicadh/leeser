				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>Curacao</placeName> <date>June 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1855</date></p>
				<p><addressee>Rev Isaac Leeser</addressee></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><placeName>Philadelphia</placeName></p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">Dear Sir</p>
			<p rend="indent(3)">I am in receipt of your esteemed form<lb/> of <date>March 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> and also of a box containing 5 sets festival prayers<lb/> pr Sarah which arrived here on the <date>2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi></date> Inst.  The Books however were<lb/> not landed till yesterday&#44; as from the tenor of your letter&#44; it was<lb/> impossible to imagine there was anything on board for me&#44; as not her<lb/> letter of advice nor B&#47;L waqs sent with them.  In fact&#44; a few days<lb/> after the arrival of the vessel she sailed for a neighbouring port and<lb/> while sailing out of the Harbour I learned there was a parcel<lb/> on board to my address.  I was therefore compelled to await her return<lb/>  The Books were in good order and have been delivered to the party who<lb/> ordered them.  I have sold them at fourteen dollars pr set&#44; contenting<lb/> myself with 3&#8531; &#37; rather than lose the sale.  Consequently there is in<lb/> my hands sixty seven dollars fifty cents&#44; say &#36;67&#44;50&#44; to your credit<lb/> which shall be very soon remitted.  I regret to say&#44; that your Bibles<lb/> do not sell quickly&#44; there are but few here who know or care any thing<lb/> about Biblical literature&#44; and still fewer who care about an English<lb/> Translation.  You are indebted to <persName>Elias Lindo&#39;s</persName> unwearied energy<lb/> for the few already sold.  I have neither the time nor the strength<lb/> to walk about with a Bible under my arm offering it for a sale.  During<lb/> <persName>E L&#39;s</persName> visit to your city&#44; he must have given you ample information respec<lb/>ting this <placeName>Island</placeName>.  But even if he has not done so&#44; it is too disagreeable<lb/> a subject to enlarge upon.  In future unless specifically ordered<lb/> I would not recommend you to send any Books here&#44; If I can<lb/> sell those on hand minus my commission I will do so&#44; and without<lb/> my boasting I would do any thing else in my humble way to serve you&#44;<lb/> but to sell books is almost an impossibility here.</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>Dutch &#38; French books are obtained and used by many and I am<lb/> I confess&#44; surprised&#44; not at the small number you sold&#44; but at the great number<lb/> On a future occasion&#44; if you should send any more here&#44; be a little more<lb/> particular&#44; about sending notice of shipment&#44; for if in this instance<lb/> the Box and its contents&#44; had been lost&#44; the fault would not have<lb/> been mine.  How is it no Occidents have arrived by the Venus&#63;<lb/>  or the Sarah&#63;  If you have them ready you can send them<lb/> to <persName>Messrs D Appleton &#38; Co.</persName> <placeName>N.Y.</placeName> who have to send me some<lb/> books&#44; and they will pack <del>up with</del> them up in the same trunk.<lb/>  Excuse the apparent negligence of my letter&#44; I am compelled<lb/> to write at night&#44; after <sic>elven</sic> hours of tiresome teaching&#44; and<lb/> my sight begins to fail slightly.  Do not wonder at my not ordering<lb/> any of your Catechisms &#38; other works&#44; my school is not a religious<lb/> one&#44; but licensed by the <placeName>Island</placeName> authorities and except during<lb/> one hour in the morning&#44; nothing that can strictly be called<lb/> religion is permitted&#44; the pupils consisting of Israelites Protestants<lb/> and Catholics&#44; as in all the other schools here&#44; and they are far<lb/> too numerous&#44; to yield any thing like a proper remuneration<lb/> for so arduous an employment as teaching.  A change<lb/> may take place as the <persName>Mahamad</persName> has at last written to <placeName>Holland</placeName><lb/> for a <add>Hebrew</add>.  I had urged this from my arrival&#44; as it is really<lb/> lamentable&#44; to see the oldest congregation the W I. nay the western<lb/> world&#44; and which formerly had its <add>Hebrew</add> and <add>Hebrew</add> now without<lb/> either.  I am sure there are not six persons in the Congregation<lb/> who understand any thing of Hebrew except the mere reading<lb/> nor have <del>my</del> they any taste for it.  I have done all I could to diffuse<lb/> a taste&#44; and my want of success I must attribute to my unfitness<lb/> for I do not feel <sic>authorised</sic> to blame <del>others</del> the community till<lb/> others better qualified than I have attempted the task&#44; I await<lb/> the result and hope it may be successful&#44; tho&#39; the fault rest with me</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>Excuse this long intelligible scrawl.  Hoping you<lb/> are quite well and with kind regards in which <add>&#63;</add><lb/> unites.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I am yours truly</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)"><persName role="author">M N Nathan</persName></p>
				<p>PS  Do not send me more number of the Occident than those<lb/> named&#8212;which I believe are 4.  <persName>Edwards</persName>&#44; <persName>Julien D Caperes</persName><lb/> <persName>P Jesurun</persName>.  <persName>E Lindo</persName> must have paid you the subscription&#44; con<lb/>sequently you may know better than I the exact number.</p>
