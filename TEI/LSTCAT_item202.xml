But deeming it their<lb/> duty to leave no means untried to counteract the deplorable<lb/> state of want of proper observance&#44; and to promote a due<lb/> knowledge of the blessed religion they have received from<lb/> their fathers&#58; they have resolved to propose a union of all<lb/> Israelites residing in <placeName>America</placeName>&#44; to effect by a common and<lb/> united effort&#44; that which would evidently be beyond the<lb/> power of accomplishing by any one of the small congrega&#45;<lb/>tions in which the Israelites of this country are divided&#59;<lb/> they therefore offer the following suggestions&#44; which they<lb/> hope will forward greatly the desired result&#59; in first esta&#45;<lb/>blishing a competent ecclesiastical authority&#44; agreeably to<lb/> the injunction of the law in Deuteronomy xvi. 18&#58; &#8220;Judges<lb/> and officers shall thou appoint for thyself in all they gates&#44;<lb/> which the Lord thy God giveth thee throughout thy<lb/> tribes&#59;&#8221; secondly&#44; by establishing schools for general and<lb/> religious education under Jewish Superintendence&#44; as com&#45;<lb/>manded in Deut. vi. 7&#58; &#8220;And thou shalt teach them dili&#45;<lb/>gently to they children&#59;&#8221; and thirdly&#44; by promoting har&#45;<lb/>mony and a concert of action among all their brethren<lb/> scattered over the Western Hemisphere&#44; in accordance with<lb/> the lofty aspiration of the Psalmist who says&#44; &#40;cxxxiii. 1&#44;&#41;<lb/> &#8220;Behold how good and how pleasant it is&#44; for brethren to<lb/> dwell together in unity.&#8221;  With these views the committee<lb/> recommend the adoption of the following rules and regula&#45;<lb/>tions for the government and action of the Israelites in<lb/> <placeName>America</placeName>.</p>

				<p><hi rend="italics">Section</hi> 1. The delegates of the different congregations&#44; as<lb/> hereinafter described&#44; or of as many as may come into the<lb/> measure&#44; shall elect at their first meeting&#44; or as soon after as<lb/> practicable&#44; three gentlemen of undoubted moral and reli&#45;<lb/>gious character&#44; who are duly learned in the written and oral<lb/> law&#44; who shall have the authority conferred upon them&#44; by<lb/> their election&#44; to act in&#44; and to decide on all cases of reli&#45;<lb/>gious inquiry&#44; and to determine all questions laid before<lb/> them&#44; according to the law&#44; and the approved rabbinical<lb/> authorities&#58; the members of this Central Religious Council<lb/> not to be at any time subject to any authority abroad&#44; nor<lb/> under the control of any congregation&#44; except in cases of<lb/> misdemeanour&#44; and <sic>wilful</sic> false decisions&#44; in which cases&#44;<lb/> one or all of such offending parties&#44; are to be removed by<lb/> the delegates of the Union as above&#59; and a majority of the<lb/> delegates present shall be required for a vote of suspension<lb/> for a period of from three to twelve months&#44; and a majority<lb/> of two&#45;thirds for a suspension for a longer period&#44; or ex&#45;<lb/>pulsion from office.</p>
				<p><hi rend="italics">Sect.</hi> 2. Whenever any case for adjudication comes<lb/> before any one of the Board hereby constituted&#44; he may<lb/> decide for himself only&#44; if the emergency will not permit<lb/> him to consult his colleagues&#59; but if otherwise he is bound<lb/> to consult them&#44; either in person or in writing&#44; before he<lb/> gives any answer&#59; in order to insure that the laws of God<lb/> be properly expounded&#44; and strictly obeyed&#44; as far as lies<lb/> in the power of the Board herewith proposed.</p>
				<p><hi rend="italics">Sect.</hi> 3. In case a decision is made by one member in<lb/> the absence of his colleagues in any emergency&#44; the said decision must be transmitted without delay to the President<lb/> of this Union&#44; for the approbation of the other members of<lb/> the Central Religious Council&#44; and a copy of all decisions<lb/> is to be forwarded to the recording secretary&#44; as hereinafter<lb/> described.</p>
				<p><hi rend="italics">Sect.</hi> 4. The Hazanim of all the congregations of this<lb/> Union&#44; are to be ex officio associates the Board&#44; provided<lb/> always&#44; that nothing is to prevent the delegates from elect&#45;<lb/>ing a Hazan to be a member of the Central Religious<lb/> Council&#44; if he duly qualified for the office in character and<lb/> capacity.</p>
				<p><hi rend="italics">Sect.</hi> 5. In a place where no one of the members of the<lb/> Central Religious Council resides&#44; the Hazan&#44; or Hazanim&#44;<lb/> or other persons&#44; in whom the community have confidence&#44;<lb/> may decide in any emergency&#44; but the decision must also<lb/> at once be transmitted to the Central Religious Council for<lb/> their approbation.</p>
				<p><hi rend="italics">Sect.</hi> 6. Any party deeming himself aggrieved by the<lb/> decision of any one member of the Board&#44; or any other<lb/> person acting under an emergency&#44; may appeal to the whole<lb/> Central Religious Council&#44; whose decision by a majority<lb/> shall be final.</p>
				<p><hi rend="italics">Sect. </hi>7. The associates as above provided&#44; shall merely<lb/> have power to speak at a meeting of the members of the<lb/> Central Religious Council&#44; but not to vote.</p>
				<p><hi rend="italics">Sect.</hi> 8. One of the three members as above shall be the<lb/> President of the Board&#44; whenever he may deem the public<lb/> good requires it&#44; and have a general supervision of strictly<lb/> ecclesiastical matters in this Union.</p>
				<p><hi rend="italics">Sec</hi>. 9. As the authority herewith delegated is merely<lb/> advisory&#44; the Central Religious Council shall never exercise<lb/> the power of excommunicating any one&#44; for any <sic>offence</sic><lb/> whatever&#59; nor to possess the right of summoning any indi&#45;<lb/>vidual who&#44; in their opinion&#44; might be guilty of any trans&#45;<lb/>gression of the Mosaic Law&#59; but shall merely designate<lb/> the <sic>offences</sic> which of right deprive any offender from the<lb/> usual Jewish rights and privileges.</p>
				<p><hi rend="italics">Sect.</hi> 10. The privilege of performing the marriage<lb/> ceremony being the right of each congregation&#44; the cus&#45;<lb/>tomary authority heretofore exercised by the Hazanim<lb/> remains inviolate&#59; nevertheless the party to be married has<lb/> the option of selecting the Hazan or any member of the<lb/> Central Religious Council to perform said ceremony.</p>
				<p><hi rend="italics">Sect.</hi> 11. The Congregations belonging to this Union<lb/> shall not elect any Shochet&#44; who has not been examined as<lb/> to qualifications by one or more members of the Central<lb/> Religious Council&#59; and it shall be the duty of the respective<lb/> Shochetim belonging to this Union&#44; to be examined once at<lb/> least in three years by one or more of the Central Religious<lb/> Council&#44; for which examination no fee whatever is to be<lb/> required.</p>
				<p><hi rend="italics">Sect</hi>. 12. No Shochet is to be suspended for frivolous<lb/> reasons&#59; and if any member of the Central Religious Council<lb/> should find it his duty to exercise this prerogative&#44; he must<lb/> state the reason for so doing in writing to the person so<lb/> suspended.</p>
				<p><hi rend="italics">Sect</hi>. 13. It is expected that the Central Religious<lb/> Council will watch over the state of religion&#44; and use every<lb/> proper occasion to exhort the people in sermons or lectures&#59;<lb/> and whenever any member of the Central Religious Coun&#45;</p>

				<p>cil wishes to address any congregation&#44; he shall have the<lb/> privilege so to do&#44; upon giving notice to the Parnass of<lb/> said congregation.</p>
				<p><hi rend="italics">Sect</hi>. 14. Whenever a new Hazan is to be elected&#44; he<lb/> must be examined as to his qualifications by one or more<lb/> members of the Central Religious Council&#44; so as to prevent<lb/> any incompetent person being forced upon the respective<lb/> congregations&#59; and if any congregation should elect a hazan<lb/> who has not obtained a certificate of the Board&#44; or who has<lb/> been rejected by them&#44; such Hazan shall not be admitted an<lb/> associate of the Central Religious Council.</p>
				<p><hi rend="italics">Sect</hi>. 15. The superintendence of the schools is herewith<lb/> vested in the Central Religious Council and the above<lb/> associates&#44; and it is made their duty to report any delin&#45;<lb/>quency in the teachers to the Board of Control&#44; as herein&#45;<lb/>after mentioned.</p>

As soon as practicable&#44; schools for both sexes<lb/> are to be established in every town where Israelites reside&#44;<lb/> and the teachers are to be paid out of a common local<lb/> fund&#44; and on no account to receive any pay or fee whatever<lb/> from the parents.</p>
