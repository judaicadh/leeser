            <p rend="indent(1)">May long life and spiritual and temporal prosperity be your portion
                from our Father<lb/> in heaven, and may He, the Most High, move your hearts to piety
                to himself, and good<lb/> will towards all <placeName>Israel</placeName> your

                which accompany this, and to elect without delay suitable<lb/> persons for
                delegates, to meet us in general convention, on the <date>first Sunday in

                    <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">We deem it scarcely requisite to admonish you to select men who have
                the fear of God<lb/> before their eyes, whose interest in the welfare of the House
                of <persName>Jacob</persName> is of an abiding<lb/> nature, whose moral character is
                unblemished, and who are of sufficient intelligence to judge<lb/> with impartiality
                and reasonable conviction, and of such men there are doubtless many<lb/> among your
                number; and have the goodness to instruct them, without exacting pledges,<lb/> with
                regard to the measures you wish proposed, and what persons elected for the high<lb/>
                stations embraced in our plan, that they who are chosen may step abroad with the
                seal of<lb/> public approbation stamped upon them and their characters.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Although we can scarcely believe that any congregation, who are duly
                impressed with<lb/> the paramount obligation to uphold our blessed faith, can refuse
                uniting with us in a mea=<lb/>sure which evidently promises so much general good: we
                would, nevertheless, thank you to<lb/> let us hear from you with the least possible
                delay, if you decline the union we herewith<lb/> offer to you.</p>

                with their<lb/> brethren in other places of <placeName>America</placeName>, have
                long since been<lb/> alive to the many evils under which they labour in the<lb/>
                great downfall of religious observance, and the want of pro-<lb/>per religious
                education among them. But deeming it their<lb/> duty to leave no means untried to
                counteract the deplorable<lb/> state of want of proper observance, and to promote a
                due<lb/> knowledge of the blessed religion they have received from<lb/> their
                fathers: they have resolved to propose a union of all<lb/> Israelites residing in
                    <placeName>America</placeName>, to effect by a common and<lb/> united effort,
                that which would evidently be beyond the<lb/> power of accomplishing by any one of
                the small congrega-<lb/>tions in which the Israelites of this country are
                divided;<lb/> they therefore offer the following suggestions, which they<lb/> hope
                will forward greatly the desired result; in first esta-<lb/>blishing a competent
                ecclesiastical authority, agreeably to<lb/> the injunction of the law in Deuteronomy
                xvi. 18: “Judges<lb/> and officers shall thou appoint for thyself in all they
                gates,<lb/> which the Lord thy God giveth thee throughout thy<lb/> tribes;”
                secondly, by establishing schools for general and<lb/> religious education under
                Jewish Superintendence, as com-<lb/>manded in Deut. vi. 7: “And thou shalt teach
                them dili-<lb/>gently to they children;” and thirdly, by promoting har-<lb/>mony and
                a concert of action among all their brethren<lb/> scattered over the Western
                Hemisphere, in accordance with<lb/> the lofty aspiration of the Psalmist who says,
                (cxxxiii. 1,)<lb/> “Behold how good and how pleasant it is, for brethren to<lb/>
                dwell together in unity.” With these views the committee<lb/> recommend the adoption

                shall elect at their first meeting, or as soon after as<lb/> practicable, three
                gentlemen of undoubted moral and reli-<lb/>gious character, who are duly learned in

            <p><hi rend="italics">Sect.</hi> 2. Whenever any case for adjudication comes<lb/> before
                any one of the Board hereby constituted, he may<lb/> decide for himself only, if the
                emergency will not permit<lb/> him to consult his colleagues; but if otherwise he is
                bound<lb/> to consult them, either in person or in writing, before he<lb/> gives any
                answer; in order to insure that the laws of God<lb/> be properly expounded, and
                strictly obeyed, as far as lies<lb/> in the power of the Board herewith
                proposed.</p>

                Union, are to be ex officio associates the Board, provided<lb/> always, that nothing
                is to prevent the delegates from elect-<lb/>ing a Hazan to be a member of the
                Central Religious<lb/> Council, if he duly qualified for the office in character
                and<lb/> capacity.</p>

                Central Religious Council resides, the Hazan, or Hazanim,<lb/> or other persons, in
                whom the community have confidence,<lb/> may decide in any emergency, but the

                for<lb/> their approbation.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italics">Sec</hi>. 9. As the authority herewith delegated is merely<lb/>

                ceremony being the right of each congregation, the cus-<lb/>tomary authority
                heretofore exercised by the Hazanim<lb/> remains inviolate; nevertheless the party
                to be married has<lb/> the option of selecting the Hazan or any member of the<lb/>
                Central Religious Council to perform said ceremony.</p>

                Religious Council, so as to prevent<lb/> any incompetent person being forced upon
                the respective<lb/> congregations; and if any congregation should elect a hazan<lb/>
                who has not obtained a certificate of the Board, or who has<lb/> been rejected by
                them, such Hazan shall not be admitted an<lb/> associate of the Central Religious
