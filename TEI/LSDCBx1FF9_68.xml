			<p>Dear Sir&#47;</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I missed you at the consecration of our<lb/> new synagogue. I believe had you been present you<lb/> would have been pleased with the ceremony. I enclose<lb/> you a Book containing the form of service for the<lb/> occasion&#44; and will also give you a short description<lb/> in the way of criticism upon the whole according to the<lb/> best of my <sic>judgement</sic>. The Building I am told is Gothic<lb/> but as I do not understand architectural terms I will not<lb/> attempt a description of it&#44; it is however according to my<lb/> taste the most beautiful synagogue I have ever seen. It<lb/> is yet in an unfinished state this in a measure marred<lb/> the effect on the day of consecration yet still under this<lb/> great disadvantage it was a most beautiful picture&#44; the<lb/> Ladies Gallery was so <sic>crouded</sic> that it was found necessary<lb/> to seat many <del>Ladies</del> below in the body of the building<lb/> which was very full without being <sic>crouded</sic>. The Mayor<lb/> and authorities of the city were all present But the<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> of the synagogues various &#40;who were all invited&#41; were nearly<lb/> all absent. I however noticed that <persName>Doctor Lilienthal</persName> was<lb/> there. The orchestra which were composed of the most<lb/> eminent Professional men in the city was truly beautiful<lb/> the opening symphony or overture called Joseph composed<lb/> by <persName>Mehul</persName> was most splendidly performed. The chorus<lb/> composed of Boys &#38; men numbering 25 were exceedingly well</p>
		<pb n="2"/>
			<p>drilled and performed their parts admirably&#8212;the six<lb/> first <add>Hebrew</add> were all <sic>chaunted</sic> by me which was not<lb/> according to my original intention as each <add>Hebrew</add> had been<lb/> presented with a <add>Hebrew</add> but as they were not present I<lb/> was obliged to undertake the whole. The <sic>chaunting</sic> was<lb/> in the old style by verse and next verse <del>answered</del> by chorus<lb/> accompanied by the organ until the few concluding verses<lb/> which were sang by the <add>Hebrew</add> to original music composed<lb/> by my Brother <persName>Louis Leo</persName> of <placeName>London</placeName>&#8212;accompanied either by<lb/> the organ or the Band. The 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> <add>Hebrew</add> was arranged<lb/> as a Trio&#8212;sang by <persName>Mr Lichtenstein</persName> <persName>Master Hecht</persName> and<lb/> myself&#8212;<add>Hebrew</add> was sang by myself and chorus<lb/> accompanied by the full band&#8212;next came <persName>Dr <sic>Raphhalls</sic></persName><lb/> sermon &#40;no doubt you have seen it published as a composition of its merit<lb/> I will not speak but it occupied too long a time and<lb/> the long prayer composed by the late <persName>Dr Herschel</persName> read in<lb/> Hebrew by the Doctor and the long list of Donations<lb/> which amounted to nearly &#36;2000 so completely tired<lb/> the congregation that many left&#8212;next came that<lb/> splendid composition of the late <persName>professor Harwitz</persName> one<lb/> verse of which was adapted by <persName>Dr Raphall</persName> for the<lb/> occasion&#8212;next the <add>Hebrew</add> sung by me accompanied by the<lb/> full orchestra&#44; and the Finale <add>Hebrew</add> by the chorus<lb/> and full orchestra&#8212;the whole occupied about<lb/> three hours and a half and I suppose the sermon<lb/> the prayer &#38; the <add>Hebrew</add> occupied at least 2 hours<lb/> and &#188; this great length of the sermon &#38;c &#38;c added<lb/> to the one hours delay before commencing was the<lb/> only reasonable fault that could be found with the</p>
		<pb n="3"/>
			<p>ceremony. Upon the whole the congregation were<lb/> highly delighted&#44; and I rec<hi rend="sup">d</hi> many flattering compliments<lb/> from members as well as strangers for the manner<lb/> in which I had <sic>superinteded</sic> the whole&#8212;the Gentlemen<lb/> of the orchestra were delighted with the music<lb/> composed by my Brother who wrote it about 20<lb/> years ago for the consecration of the London Synagogue<lb/> in <placeName>St Albans Place&#44; Haymarket</placeName>&#44; where my late Father<lb/> was <add>Hebrew</add> the ode by the late <persName>Professor Hurwitz</persName> was also<lb/> written for the same occasion.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">The Trustees being impressed by the great labor<lb/> I had in getting up this ceremony presented<lb/> me with a very liberal sum of money as a<lb/> mark of their approbation for the service I had<lb/> rendered them.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">This my dear Sir is a rough sketch which<lb/> you can make use of or not just as it suits<lb/> you&#8212;and if you please to insert the<lb/> particulars in the Occident rest assured<lb/> there is no exaggeration or prejudice in<lb/> any one of the facts stated</p>
			<p>Trusting that this will find you in excellent<lb/> health</p> 
          <p rend="indent(8)">I am Dear Sir</p>
          <p rend="indent(8)">yours faithfully</p>
