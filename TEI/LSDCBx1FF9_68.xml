                              <p rend="indent(1)">I missed you at the consecration of our<lb/> new
                                        synagogue. I believe had you been present you<lb/> would
                                        have been pleased with the ceremony. I enclose<lb/> you a
                                        Book containing the form of service for the<lb/> occasion,
                                        and will also give you a short description<lb/> in the way
                                        of criticism upon the whole according to the<lb/> best of my
                                                  <sic>judgement</sic>. The Building I am told is
                                        Gothic<lb/> but as I do not understand architectural terms I
                                        will not<lb/> attempt a description of it, it is however
                                        according to my<lb/> taste the most beautiful synagogue I
                                        have ever seen. It<lb/> is yet in an unfinished state this
                                        in a measure marred<lb/> the effect on the day of
                                        consecration yet still under this<lb/> great disadvantage it
                                        was a most beautiful picture, the<lb/> Ladies Gallery was so
                                                  <sic>crouded</sic> that it was found
                                        necessary<lb/> to seat many <del>Ladies</del> below in the
                                        body of the building<lb/> which was very full without being
                                                  <sic>crouded</sic>. The Mayor<lb/> and authorities
                                        of the city were all present But the<lb/>
                                        <add>חזנים</add> of the synagogues various (who were all
                                        invited) were nearly<lb/> all absent. I however noticed that
                                                  <persName>Doctor Lilienthal</persName> was<lb/>
                                        there. The orchestra which were composed of the most<lb/>
                                        eminent Professional men in the city was truly
                                        beautiful<lb/> the opening symphony or overture called
                                        Joseph composed<lb/> by <persName>Mehul</persName> was most
                                        splendidly performed. The chorus<lb/> composed of Boys &amp;
                                        men numbering 25 were exceedingly well</p>

                              <p>drilled and performed their parts admirably—the six<lb/> first
                                                  <add>מזמורים</add> were all <sic>chaunted</sic> by
                                        me which was not<lb/> according to my original intention as
                                        each <add>חזן</add> had been<lb/> presented with a
                                                  <add>מזמור</add> but as they were not present
                                        I<lb/> was obliged to undertake the whole. The
                                                  <sic>chaunting</sic> was<lb/> in the old style by
                                        verse and next verse <del>answered</del> by chorus<lb/>
                                        accompanied by the organ until the few concluding
                                        verses<lb/> which were sang by the <add>in the old style by
                                                  חזן verse and next verse</add> to original music
                                        composed<lb/> by my Brother <persName>Louis Leo</persName>
                                        of <placeName>London</placeName>—accompanied either by<lb/>
                                        the organ or the Band. The 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                                        <add>חזן</add> was arranged<lb/> as a Trio—sang by

                                                  myself—<add>מזמור</add> was sang by myself and
                                        chorus<lb/> accompanied by the full band—next came
                                                  <persName>Dr <sic>Raphhalls</sic></persName><lb/>
                                        sermon (no doubt you have seen it published as a composition
                                        of its merit<lb/> I will not speak but it occupied too long
                                        a time and<lb/> the long prayer composed by the late
                                                  <persName>Dr Herschel</persName> read in<lb/>

                                        which amounted to nearly $2000 so completely tired<lb/> the
                                        congregation that many left—next came that<lb/> splendid
                                        composition of the late <persName>professor
                                                  Harwitz</persName> one<lb/> verse of which was

                                        occasion—next the <add>מזמור לדוד</add> sung by me
                                        accompanied by the<lb/> full orchestra, and the Finale
