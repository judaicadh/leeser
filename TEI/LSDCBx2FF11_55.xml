            <p rend="indent(1)">A large attendance, consisting of mostly every member of our

                all things, thy neighbor as thyself, and be also careful of they own self”
                these<lb/> constitute Judaism; he further stated that in these duties the young

                several questions regarding<lb/> the duties of man towards God, these questions
                embracing the historical, as well<lb/> as religious parts of the Sacred Books,
                besides all the doctrines of orthodox Judaism,<lb/> to all of which the young
                gentleman replied with the greatest accuracy; the<lb/> first part of the examination
                concluding with the recital of the Decalogue and<lb/> the 13 articles of Faith, when
                the choir sang “<hi rend="underline">Ele shelosy Jnesray</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The 2d part of the examination included the duties towards our

                my parents, teachers and<lb/> coreligionists, I do solemnly declare: that I believe
                in the exis<lb/>tence of an Only, Eternal God, who created and governs the<lb/>
                Universe; that I believe in the immortality of the Soul,<lb/> and the resurrection
                of the dead, and that according to<lb/> our actions, we will either be recompensed
                or punished;<lb/> that I believe in the divine revelation on <placeName>Mount
                    Sinai</placeName>,<lb/> through <persName>Moses</persName>, and in the coming of
                the Messiah,<lb/> who will spread the knowledge of God on the whole earth.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">This belief, my faith, will lead me to the ful<lb/>fillment of my
                duties towards God, my neighbor and my<lb/>self; by this faith will I abide, to it
                will I adhere,<lb/> disregarding the seductions of all such as might en<lb/>deavor
                to entice me to abandon the path of virtue<lb/> and religion. <hi rend="underline"
                    >Nedarai </hi><hi rend="underline">ladonai ashalem &amp;c.</hi>”</p>
            <p>At the conclusion of the profession of Faith, the father, the Rabbi,<lb/> and the
                teacher laid their hands on the young gentleman's head the<lb/> Rabbi pronouncing a
                benediction, and praying the Almighty God, to<lb/> bestow on the initiated strength
                and fortitude, to observe all the</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>commandments of his law, to withstand the temptations to which we are<lb/> all
                exposed, that he may be a source of gratification, to his parents,<lb/> our
                congregation, and also an ornament to society.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Whilst this benediction was being pronounced a melody was<lb/>
                played on the organ, as proceeding from distant regions; this naturally<lb/> tended
                to enhance the solemnity of the ceremony, which was now brought<lb/> to a close by
                the choir chanting the 1st and last verse of Psalm CL.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The <hi rend="underline">Sepharim</hi> were then taken out, the two
                first, as custom<lb/>ary by the <hi rend="underline">Hatane atorah</hi>; it should
                here be added that at his own<lb/> request to the Board of Elders, <persName>Mr. B
                    de Casseres Jr.</persName>, father of the<lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">Bar Mitsva</hi>, had been elected this year as <hi
                    rend="underline">Hatan Torah</hi>, and that<lb/> when called to the <hi
                    rend="underline">Sepher</hi>, he read the last chapter of Deutoronomy<lb/> “<hi
                    rend="underline">Vayagnal Moshe</hi> to end.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Master H. A. de Casseres</persName> also read the portion
                appointed<lb/> for <hi rend="underline">Bar Mitsva</hi> in this congregation, viz:
                    <hi rend="underline">Vegnatá</hi> (Deut: Ch: Xv12 to end)</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">At home, the <hi rend="underline">Bar Mitsva</hi>, addressed the
                meeting<lb/> in English, and spoke as follows: (see inclosure)</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">We would add that the greatest union has prevailed in this<lb/>
                community during all the festivals that the synagogue has al<lb/>ways been well
                attended, both on first and second days—and that<lb/> the community continues
                progressing daily.</p>
