				<p rend="align(center)">by a <persName role="author">Reader of the Occident</persName></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The old Congregation &#8220;<hi rend="underline">Mickve&#39; Isra&#235;l</hi>&#8221; of <placeName>Curacao &#40;W. I.</placeName>&#41; witnessed for the first time<lb/> on <hi rend="underline"><date>Simchath Torah</date></hi> the ceremony of confirmation&#59; for the first time&#44; as although<lb/> adopted in principle since <date>1864</date>&#44; it had never yet received the sanction of practice<lb/> <persName>Master H. A. de Casseres</persName> was on that day to be called to the <hi rend="underline">Sepher</hi>&#44; and<lb/> the ceremony had been fixed to take place&#44; between the <hi rend="underline">Hallel</hi> and the reading<lb/> of the law.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">A large attendance&#44; consisting of mostly every member of our congregation<lb/> besides some of other persuasions&#44; were present.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">As an introduction to the ceremony&#44; the choir sang the two last verses<lb/> of Psalm C&#44; after which the Chief Rabbi &#40;<persName>Revd Chumaceiro</persName>&#41; addressed the community<lb/> for a few moments&#44; demonstrating that the quintessence of the Jewish religion&#44; was<lb/> &#8220;Love God above all things&#44; thy neighbor as thyself&#44; and be also careful of they own self&#8221; these<lb/> constitute Judaism&#59; he further stated that in these duties the young gentleman was<lb/> now to be examined.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The <persName>Rev. Santeroos</persName>&#44; Hebrew teacher and assistant <hi rend="underline">Hazan</hi> of the congregation&#44;<lb/> <sic>their</sic> addressed <persName>Master de Casseres</persName>&#44; and made him several questions regarding<lb/> the duties of man towards God&#44; these questions embracing the historical&#44; as well<lb/> as religious parts of the Sacred Books&#44; besides all the doctrines of orthodox Judaism&#44;<lb/> to all of which the young gentleman replied with the greatest accuracy&#59; the<lb/> first part of the examination concluding with the recital of the Decalogue and<lb/> the 13 articles of Faith&#44; when the choir sang &#8220;<hi rend="underline">Ele shelosy Jnesray</hi> &#38;c.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The 2d part of the examination included the duties towards our neighbor&#44;<lb/> and those towards ourselves&#59; to all these questions the young gentleman an<lb/>swered likewise to the satisfaction of all present.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The whole ceremony has been conducted in the Dutch language&#44;<lb/> and at the termination of the second part of the examination&#44; Master</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><persName>de Cassares </persName>made a profession of faith&#44; in the same language of which the<lb/> following is a translation&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#8220;I feel that I am attached to the religion&#44; in which I have been born&#59;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I feel that I may not abandon it&#44; either voluntarily or by compul<lb/>sion</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I have been taught the fundamental principles of our religion&#44; and<lb/> acknowledge it as true and everlasting.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The answers which I have given to the questions which have been<lb/> addressed me on this holy spot&#44; will have given you the assurance&#44;<lb/> I trust&#44; that I am acquainted&#44; as far as my age allows&#44; with<lb/> the history of our people&#44; and with the doctrines of our religion&#59;<lb/> on this same spot&#44; in the presence of my parents&#44; teachers and<lb/> coreligionists&#44; I do solemnly declare&#58; that I believe in the exis<lb/>tence of an Only&#44; Eternal God&#44; who created and governs the<lb/> Universe&#59; that I believe in the immortality of the Soul&#44;<lb/> and the resurrection of the dead&#44; and that according to<lb/> our actions&#44; we will either be recompensed or punished&#59;<lb/> that I believe in the divine revelation on <placeName>Mount Sinai</placeName>&#44;<lb/> through <persName>Moses</persName>&#44; and in the coming of the Messiah&#44;<lb/> who will spread the knowledge of God on the whole earth.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">This belief&#44; my faith&#44; will lead me to the ful<lb/>fillment of my duties towards God&#44; my neighbor and my<lb/>self&#59; by this faith will I abide&#44; to it will I adhere&#44;<lb/> disregarding the seductions of all such as might en<lb/>deavor to entice me to abandon the path of virtue<lb/> and religion.  <hi rend="underline">Nedarai </hi><hi rend="underline">ladonai ashalem &#38;c.</hi>&#8221;</p>
				<p>At the conclusion of the profession of Faith&#44; the father&#44; the Rabbi&#44;<lb/> and the teacher laid their hands on the young gentleman&#39;s head the<lb/> Rabbi pronouncing a benediction&#44; and praying the Almighty God&#44; to<lb/> bestow on the initiated strength and fortitude&#44; to observe all the</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>commandments of his law&#44; to withstand the temptations to which we are<lb/> all exposed&#44; that he may be a source of gratification&#44; to his parents&#44;<lb/> our congregation&#44; and also an ornament to society.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Whilst this benediction was being pronounced a melody was<lb/> played on the organ&#44; as proceeding from distant regions&#59; this naturally<lb/> tended to enhance the solemnity of the ceremony&#44; which was now brought<lb/> to a close by the choir chanting the 1st and last verse of Psalm CL.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The <hi rend="underline">Sepharim</hi> were then taken out&#44; the two first&#44; as custom<lb/>ary by the <hi rend="underline">Hatane atorah</hi>&#59; it should here be added that at his own<lb/> request to the Board of Elders&#44; <persName>Mr. B de Casseres Jr.</persName>&#44; father of the<lb/> <hi rend="underline">Bar Mitsva</hi>&#44; had been elected this year as <hi rend="underline">Hatan Torah</hi>&#44; and that<lb/> when called to the <hi rend="underline">Sepher</hi>&#44; he read the last chapter of Deutoronomy<lb/> &#8220;<hi rend="underline">Vayagnal Moshe</hi> to end.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Master H. A. de Casseres</persName> also read the portion appointed<lb/> for <hi rend="underline">Bar Mitsva</hi> in this congregation&#44; viz&#58; <hi rend="underline">Vegnat&#225;</hi> &#40;Deut&#58; Ch&#58; Xv12 to end&#41;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">At home&#44; the <hi rend="underline">Bar Mitsva</hi>&#44; addressed the meeting<lb/> in English&#44; and spoke as follows&#58; &#40;see inclosure&#41;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">We would add that the greatest union has prevailed in this<lb/> community during all the festivals that the synagogue has al<lb/>ways been well attended&#44; both on first and second days&#8212;and that<lb/> the community continues progressing daily.</p>
