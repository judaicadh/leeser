				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>Charleston&#44; S. C.</placeName> <date>March 29 5619&#47;1859</date>.</p>
				<p><addressee>Rev. Mr. I. Leeser</addressee>&#44; <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">My dear Sir&#8212;</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">&#33; <add>Hebrew</add> Although I am<lb/> fully confident that the friendship and regard which&#44; notwithstanding<lb/> our difference of religious views&#44; you have at various times manifested<lb/> towards me&#44; would be satisfied with the above open and sincere<lb/> confession on my part&#44; in reply to your message conveyed to me&#44; last<lb/> night&#44; by <persName>Mr. Hart</persName>&#44; yet&#44; to show you that I reciprocate those<lb/> feelings&#44; I deem it incumbent upon me to give you a full explanati&#45;<lb/>on of my <hi rend="underline">long</hi> silence and <hi rend="underline">seeming</hi> neglect.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">It is certainly unnecessary to assure you that neither ill feeling<lb/> nor <sic>wilful</sic> disregard caused that silence&#59; my friendship and respect<lb/> for you have not in the least diminished&#59; I could refer to many<lb/> of your acquaintances in this place&#44; that I do not allow any<lb/> opportunity to pass&#44; without expressing my highest appreciation<lb/> for you&#59; nay&#33;  I would even defend you against all insinuations<lb/> of your <hi rend="underline">friends</hi>&#44; who deem it proper to sound the praise of their<lb/> favorites at your expense&#59; and <persName>Rev. Mr. H. P. Jacobs</persName> can tell you<lb/> that&#44; when you announced the discontinuance of the translation of<lb/> the Cozri by <persName>Dr Fiskel</persName> &#40;why this course&#63;&#41; I contemplated to<lb/> substitute the deficiency by my own translation.  Circumstances<lb/> which led to my silence have prevented me to carry out that con&#45;<lb/>templated work.  So much upon this point.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">And now&#44; in the full expectation that you will make no farther<lb/> use of what I shall have to say&#44; I will fully explain those cir&#45;<lb/>cumstances.  For the last two years&#44; I have made the sad experience</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>that the path of a minister&#44; especially of a Jewish one&#44; is not strewn<lb/> with roses.  I will not enter into details&#44; but merely beg of you not<lb/> to base any conclusion or <sic>judgement</sic> upon what you might have<lb/> heard&#44; or should still hear&#44; as long as you have not heard also<lb/> the other party&#44; my humble self <add>Hebrew</add> Thank God&#33;  not&#45;<lb/>withstanding all the harassing annoyances and persecutions which<lb/> I have had to endure both on the part of those that are &#8220;with me&#44;&#8221;<lb/> and those that are &#8220;against me&#44;&#8221; my character stands forth<lb/> unstained and unscathed&#44; and I have the consolation that<lb/> my course was one of the most uncompromising honesty and<lb/> straightforwardness.  Yet&#44; I must confess that all these experiences<lb/> have in so far discouraged me&#44; that I do my duty to its fullest<lb/> extent&#44; but abstain from all further cooperation and interference<lb/> in the religious affairs of our people&#44; unless something <hi rend="underline">national</hi><lb/> appeals to my Jewish heart&#44; in such cases I rush to the<lb/> post of duty with all zeal and enthusiasm.  Have you read&#44; for the last 18 months&#44;<lb/> one line of controversy published by me in any of our Papers&#44;<lb/> here or in <placeName>Europe</placeName>&#63;  I can assure you that I have received many<lb/> letters even blaming me for my inactivity&#59; yet I still continue<lb/> to be silent&#59; nay&#33; if I had not still the hope for better things<lb/> to come&#44; I should have retired from public life altogether.<lb/>  Under such circumstances it is but natural&#44; that even my<lb/> private correspondence must suffer&#59; it so happens that you are<lb/> among the rest.  I have yet a letter of <persName>Dr Holdheim</persName>&#44; dated<lb/> <date>March 1. 1858</date>&#8212;to answer&#59; I tried it often&#44; but could not suc&#45;<lb/>ceed.  <persName>Dr Philippson</persName> has not had a line from me since last <date>August</date>&#44;<lb/> and then I <hi rend="underline">merely</hi> complained of the irregularity with which I<lb/> receive the publications of &#8220;the Institute&#8221;.  <persName>Stein</persName> in <placeName>Frankfort</placeName><lb/> has been expecting a letter from me&#44; ever since last <date>Juli.</date>  Coming</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>nearer home&#44; <persName>Einhorn</persName> whom I <hi rend="underline">must</hi> regard as one of my best friends<lb/> living&#44; has to write two letters to my one&#44; and others do not fare<lb/> better.  I trust&#44; as I do not wish to continue in this strain&#44; that this<lb/> exposition will be accepted by you as a satisfactory apology for<lb/> my seeming neglect.  In future&#44; I shall endeavor to do better.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I have received the first number of the weekly &#8220;Occident.&#8221;<lb/>  I must congratulate you upon its appearance&#59; it is <hi rend="underline">by far</hi> <hi rend="underline">the</hi><lb/> handsomest Jewish sheet of all I know&#59; it really deserves to prosper.<lb/>  I say this from the depth of my heart&#44; altho&#39; I cannot always<lb/> agree with the contents &#38; tendency of your publications.  Should<lb/> you wish my literary co&#45;operation&#44; I am ready to serve you&#59; but&#44;<lb/> as you must perceive from the above&#44; I cannot promise any <hi rend="underline">original</hi><lb/> matter&#59; and even translations of mine must not bear my name.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Here I am reminded to explain a fact which must seem to<lb/> you to be in contradiction with my exposition above&#58; I allude<lb/> to the publication of &#8220;Hects Biblical History for Israelitish<lb/> Schools.&#8221;  The work was ordered and undertaken by the School Com&#45;<lb/>mittee of <persName>Dr Adler&#39;s</persName> Congregation&#44; who appointed and requested me to make the translation.  But I can show you from my cor&#45;<lb/>respondence with <persName>Dr A.</persName> upon the subject&#44; that I did not even respond<lb/> officially to that committee&#44; but corresponded only privately with<lb/> the Doctor&#44; and yielded only to <hi rend="underline">his personal</hi>&#44; earnest and re&#45;<lb/>peated solicitations.  All I received for my labor&#44; are <hi rend="underline">two</hi> copies<lb/> of the work&#44; one from <persName>Dr A.</persName>&#44; and another from the publishers.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">You undoubtedly have known that I suffered intensely last<lb/> summer&#44; that I was confined to my bed&#44;&#8212;with very short inter&#45;<lb/>vals&#8212;for 15 weeks&#59; 9 here and 6 in <placeName>New York</placeName>.  But what<lb/> do you say to this&#58; with the sole exceptoin of <persName>Dr Raphall</persName> &#40;and<lb/> of course <persName>Dr Adler</persName>&#41; not one of the Reverend &#40;&#63;&#41; gentlemen ever</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>came to see me&#59; <persName>Dr Fishel</persName>&#44; <persName>Mr. Lyons</persName> &#38; <persName>Isaacs</persName> would not even speak to me&#44;<lb/> when we met.  Indeed&#33;  I do not care about it&#59; men who can thus<lb/> forget their position&#44; thus violate the very first law of religion&#44; and<lb/> manifest such a stupid fanaticism&#44; are better &#8220;left severely alone&#8221;<lb/> in their glory and &#8220;<add>&#63;</add>.&#8221;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I must let you also into the secret of <hi rend="underline">an</hi> <persName>Mortara</persName> movement<lb/> here.  Having been opposed by the <persName>Moise</persName> clique and others&#44; the<lb/> meeting was a pitiful one&#59; hardly 2 dozen Jews were present.<lb/>  The Jews <del>only</del>&#44; I am convinced&#44; are united by their national<lb/> feeling only when there is something &#8220;to&#8212;&#39;<hi rend="underline">fress</hi>&#39;&#8221;.  A comparison<lb/> between the Swiss treaty affair and the <persName>Morara</persName> case&#44; on one hand&#44; and the<lb/> last Anniversary Dinner of our H. B. S. on the other&#44; prove this fact beyond<lb/> all earthly doubt.  I must confess&#44; the more I see and hear of our<lb/> people in this country&#44; the more I am convinced that <persName>Moses</persName>&#44; were<lb/> he now to come amongst us&#44; would again exclaim&#58; &#33;<add>Hebrew</add><lb/> While they would allow no opportunity to pass&#44; whenever it is in their<lb/> power&#44; to oppress &#38; persecute their own people and make them<lb/> feel their superiority&#8212;however questionable and counterfeited it<lb/> may be&#44; they crouch and cringe before those of another creed&#44; and<lb/> prove <sic>contemtible</sic> cowards whenever they are called upon to stand<lb/> up to their rights or defend their own Jewish&#45;national affairs.<lb/>  And in no city <del>at</del> is this more glaringly evident than in <placeName>Charleston</placeName>.<lb/>  There they could exercise some influence&#44; but they neglect it&#44; to<lb/> please &#38; flatter their Christian fellow&#45;citizens&#59; the defeat of <persName>Mr.<lb/> Mordecai</persName>&#44; last fall&#44; is exclusively attributable to the treachery of<lb/> his correligionists&#44; especially&#44; <hi rend="underline">not exclusively</hi>&#44; in the orthodox congregation.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">But I must conclude&#59; accept <persName>Mrs. M.&#39;s</persName> &#38; my own best regard<lb/> &#38; wishes&#44; and write soon to</p>
			<p rend="indent(10)">Yours&#44; most friendly</p>
			<p rend="indent(10)"><persName role="author">Dr M Mayer</persName></p>
				<p>By the bye&#44;&#58; How do you stand with</p>
				<p><persName>Dr Deutsch</persName>&#63;  Please send me the controversy</p>
				<p>between the unknown Jew&#44; yourself &#38; <persName>Mr. Morais</persName>.  I have heard of it&#44; a few days</p>
				<p>ago&#44; but never seen it.  You know what controversy I am alluding to.</p>
