DEDICATION. 



TO THE 



RIGHT REV. ABRAHAM SUTRO&#44; 



CHIEF RABBI OF THE DIOCESE OF MUNSTER AND MARK. 



Honoured Rabbi &#33; 

In inscribing these volumes to you&#44; I cannot refrain 
from publicly acknowledging that to you it is chiefly 
due that I ever ventured to undertake the task of a 
public teacher. I well remember the time&#44; when 
scarcely nine summers had passed over my head&#44; that 
you arrived among us &#59; and how the first sermon I 
ever heard delivered&#44; the one you addressed to our 
congregation&#44; made a powerful impression upon us 
all&#44; not excepting the little unconscious boy I then 
was. YoLi&#44; also&#44; as I advanced in life&#44; encouraged my 
humble striving to excel&#44; and I can never forget the

VI DEDICATION. 

kindness with which you always seconded the efforts 
of my blessed teacher. I trust that the fruits of 
maturer years&#44; which I now present to you&#44; may be 
thought worthy of your acceptance&#44; and convince you 
that your guidance and instruction&#44; as well as your 
example&#44; have not been lost upon the one who is now

PREFACE. 



In the following work the reader is presented with the labour of more 
than six years. Many of the Discourses were composed&#44; when suffering both 
under mental and bodily afflictions&#44; when any exertion was extremely painful &#59; 
and it must not be imagined&#44; that&#44; what appears to read smoothly&#44; and as if 
written off&#8211;hand&#44; costs not an intense degree of thougiit and application. 
Very often the labour was interrupted by severe sickness and other un&#8211; 
toward events&#44; and hence the frequent long intervals between the different 
treatises. Still I never relaxed in my endeavours to diffuse religious and 
useful knowledge&#44; and I fervently trust tliat I have succeeded&#44; to a certain 
extent&#44; to impart some information which is not readily accessible in books 
in general circulation. 

The first twenty Discourses were re&#8211;written&#44; because I could not suffer 
my first attempts to come before the public without a thorough revision. 
The others&#44; however&#44; which were composed chiefly after the chastening 
hand of the Lord had fallen heavily on me&#44; were prepared with more care&#44; 
and I therefore only corrected them carefully&#44; and altered those parts which 
appeared objectionable or defective. I will not assert&#44; that I could not have 
altered the whole series&#44; and perhaps improved it much more than I have 
done &#59; but still I was obliged to stop somewhere in the alterations I intro&#8211; 
duced&#44; and I candidly believe that further changes&#44; curtailments and 
enlargements would not have enabled me to produce any thing more deserv&#8211; 
ing of approbation&#59; as&#44; what might in this manner have been gained in beauty 
of style&#44; would to a certainty have been sacrificed to the force and ingenu&#8211; 
ousness always belonging to the first efforts of the mind&#44; before they have 
been subjected to the cold and capricious judgment of criticism. Doubt&#8211; 
lessly another might have used the pruning knife more frequently and 
relentlessly&#44; and have improved the work much more than has been done by 
me &#59; still I may say&#44; that I acted as impartially towards myself as I was 
able&#44; and excused notiiing that I found to be faulty. And entire passages

have been taken out&#44; sentences altered&#44; words substituted&#44; and the arguments 
condensed&#44; at times even after the matter was in type &#59; which I was the 
more enabled to do&#44; as I have been uniformly in the habit of laying my 
writings aside and never to recur to them till the lapse of considerable time&#44; 
perhaps not till after several years. Hence&#44; I had very often forgotten the 
whole of a discourse&#44; and upon reading and preparing it for the press&#44; it was 
as new to me almost as to an entire stranger. To this it is also owing&#44; that 
in two instances&#44; 1 believe&#44; I chose the same texts&#44; and at times introduced 
parts of arguments and quotations which had been employed on prior occa&#8211; 
sions. I hope&#44; however&#44; that these errors &#40;for errors they certainly are) 
will not be thought of sufficient magnitude&#44; nor of so frequent recurrence&#44; as 
to offend the reader &#59; at all events I am induced to think&#44; that the like faults 
are almost inseparable from a labour of so many years&#44; without a degree of 
care and fearfulness&#44; which would materially injure the force and energy of 
a rapid flow of ideas. 

The several sketches of cliaracter introduced&#44; although I confess that 
many of them have been taken from actual observation and historical 
personages&#44; will&#44; I hope nevertheless&#44; be found not to contain any thing 
offensive to anyone&#59; for although I would always condemn crime and 
impiety in language of becoming severity : I should be sorry to be deemed 
guilty of personalities&#44; and of dragging the faults of the living or dead before 
the public gaze without a sufficient and cogent reason. 

In place of giving out a text and stringing a sermon to the same&#44; as is 
customary with most preachers&#44; I have generally chosen to introduce it in 
the middle or even at the conclusion of my discourses&#59; because I desired to 
illustrate a doctrinal point&#44; and then show its consonance with the text of 
Scripture&#44; believing this course less fatiguing and more interesting to the 
audience than the usual mode. 

I laboured under the same disadvantage of not possessing many books of 
reference&#44; as on former occasions&#44; and I had to remedy it by a greater degree 
of care and more intense study. &#8212; The translations of passages from Scrip&#8211; 
ture are mostly according to the opinions of our commentators&#44; and I did not 
often consult the common English version&#59; hence no doubt great difference 
in the wording from this Standard will often be met with. 

As yet I have found no publisher for my works &#59; and I have therefore to 
undertake the literary as well as the mercantile part of the enterprize. The 
latter is particularly harrassing to one who&#44; like myself&#44; has no business con&#8211; 
nexions&#44; and has to rely upon persons otherwise engaged to dispose of the

books&#44; which is a task that but few are willing to engage in. I therefore 
return my sincere thanks to those who have endeavoured to assist me in my 
undertaking by inducing others to encourage it&#44; and I only regret that their 
exertions have not met with a better return.&#8212; I hope&#44; however&#44; that they 
will not relax for the future&#44; believing as I do&#44; conscientiously&#44; that in circu&#8211; 
lating the few works I have edited they aid in the dissemination of truth&#44; as 
I have endeavoured to let nothing escape my pen which could be injurious 
in the least to the cause of morality and the public welfare. &#8212; In adddition to 
the foregoing&#44; I have to state&#44; that if I had taken my former want of success 
as a warning&#44; I should never have obtruded myself again upon the public&#44; 
since the first work I issued brought no profit&#44; and the second caused a consi&#8211; 
derable pecuniary loss. &#8212; Still the favourable opinion expressed of both by 
competent judges&#44; and the kindness and encouraging language of sincere 
friends have counselled me to persevere&#44; and I have but little doubt that the 
present effort will be more successful than the preceding ones&#44; although 
the substantial manner and good style in which the mechanical part has 
been executed will prevent any considerable gain&#44; even if the whole 
edition&#44; which is but half of the &#34;Instruction&#34; and two&#8211;thirds of the &#34;Jews 
and Mosaic&#8211;Jaw&#34; should be disposed of. Nevertheless&#44; the increased num&#8211; 
ber of subscribers is highly gratifying&#44; as it abundantly proves&#44; that neither 
myself nor my efforts have sunk in public estimation. &#8212; But I believe it is 
time to dismiss the subject&#44; as otherwise some one&#44; too much disposed to 
criticize words and motives&#44; might have some show of reason to suppose 
interested views of a sordid nature as the cause of this publication. I do not 
lay claim to an exemption from human faults and frailties &#59; but in justice to 
myself I may maintain&#44; without vanity or self&#8211;deception&#44; that my whole 
course&#44; both public and private&#44; will bear me out in saying&#44; that pecuniary 
gain has had but a small share in prompting my actions. INIore I need not 
say&#44; as I am not yet accused&#44; and if this should unfortunately be the case&#44; 
then it will be time enough to reply. 

I should like to tell the reader something more of the rise and progress of 
my public teaching &#59; but the time I have already consumed in speaking of 
myself&#44; personally&#44; admonishes me to leave it for a future and more fitting 
occasion. Yet I must remark in passing&#44; that the whole of the Discourses 
may be viewed as extemporaneous effusions in writing&#59; since I never pre&#8211; 
pared them&#44; with but very few exceptions&#44; till a day or two before the day I 
spoke them &#59; and in revising them for the press&#44; I took especial care not to 
alter the subject matter more than correctness of argument and of diction

indulgent judgment&#44; I wish not faults to be extenuated or defects to be

is the Lord and ihe Creator of the universe.

Confidence in God. 

Brethren of the House of Israel &#33; 

It is with extreme reluctance&#44; founded upon a knowledge oi 
my inability to advance any thing which may be generally 
interesting&#44; that I now&#44; for the first time&#44; venture to address 
you. I feel too little confidence in my attainments &#40;and I hope 
that no one will accuse me of affectation for so saying) even to 
imagine that I could do justice to our holy religion by any 
thing I am going to say. Before I begin&#44; therefore&#44; I am con&#8211; 
strained to tell you&#44; that only in obedience to the repeated 
solicitations of persons who really feel an interest in the welfare 
of our nation&#44; I persuaded myself to attempt teaching that&#44; 
which I deem to be the essential parts of our faith. After this 
candid avowal&#44; I trust&#44; that you will pardon any defect which 
you may discover&#44; and be a little indulgent to my first effort 
at public speaking. It is highly probable&#44; that most of you&#44; if 
not all&#44; may have heard all which I can advance &#59; but then I 
must beg of you to consider&#44; that known truths may often be 
but faintly remembered&#44; and that we may derive great and 
lasting benefits by having them presented to us in a light&#44; in 
which perhaps we had never before viewed them. It is for

this reason expedient&#44; that occasional lectures on religious 
subjects should be delivered in our Synagogues&#44; although I 
cannot deny that many members&#44; perhaps the greater number&#44; 
of our society are sufficiently acquainted with their duties&#44; and 
need not to be reminded of them by any preacher&#44; however 
eloquent. &#8212; Having premised thus much&#44; let us proceed to the 
consideration of the following verse&#44; from the xxvth chapter 
of Isaiah : 

&#34; And it will be said on that day: Behold this is our God in whom we 
have trusted&#44; and he will save us &#59; this is the Lord in whom we have trusted&#44; 
we will be glad and rejoiced in his salvation.&#34; Isaiah xxv. 9. 

God is great and mighty &#8212; nothing is too great for his power 

to accomplish &#8212; nothing is hidden from his searching view. 
For if we look around us and behold the stupendous works of 
creation &#59; when we see the regularity and order which reign 
in every thing &#59; and when we turn our view within ourselves&#44; 
and consider the nature of tlie living soul which we feel to 
animate us : we must be convinced&#44; that the One above is 
powerful beyond compare&#44; and wise beyond all measure. And 
if we descend from a contemplation of the greatness of God&#44; as 
displayed in his creation&#44; and reflect with care and candour 
upon the individual fortune of every human being: we will 
discover&#44; that his providence and goodness are no less displayed 
in the details of life&#44; than his power and wisdom are shown 
in the structure of the universe. 

Of this his superintending watchfulness over the individual 
happiness and lives of the children of man&#44; Holy Writ furnishes 
us with many examples &#59; for there we find narrated&#44; how He 
manifested his power in saving and assisting those worthy of 
being called his servants&#44; those&#44; who placed their trust in 
Him&#44; their God and Redeemer&#44; when they found themselves 
surrounded by difficulties&#44; from which no human foresight 
could have guarded&#44; from which no earthly means could ex&#8211; 
tricate them. We there have&#44; also&#44; examples which prove&#44; 
that they who relied on their own strength&#44; or asked for and 
employed the aid of men&#44; were unsuccessful in their endea&#8211; 

<pb n="3"/>

vours&#44; whilst the weaker&#44; relying upon their Father above&#44; 
were prosperous. This should teach us&#44; that if we wish to 
receive the protection of God&#44; we ought first to deserve it by 
placing an undivided confidence in his providence &#59; and we 
should never hesitate to do what our religion demands of us for 
fear of sufl&#39;ering worldly loss and inconvenience &#59; but we should 
consider that we never can ultimately lose if we are truly 
obedient to God &#59; that in his service we never will be allowed 
to suffer more than wc are able to bear. We may be met by 
difficulties in our pursuit of righteousness&#44; but it is our duty to 
remain unshaken &#59; we may have to suffer temporary loss&#44; but 
we should not heed it. Wc may perchance&#44; also&#44; subject our&#8211; 
selves to the hatred of wicked men &#59; but we ought not to suffer 
the fear of the creature to overcome us in the service of the 
Creator. It should be enough for us&#44; that we are doing our 
duty&#59; that we are obeying the will of our Father: and this 
consciousness will strengthen us to bear up against all worldly 
ills &#59; for animated by a true confidence in God we must feel&#44; 
that He is mighty enough to repay us our losses &#8212; remunerate 
us for our toil &#8212; and protect us from any injury to which we 
may be exposed. If therefore we are truly impressed with 
the knowledge of the power and goodness of the Lord&#44; we 
must be his willing servants&#44; and practice that readily which 
we are taught by Him to call wise and good&#44; independent of 
all considerations of personal gain or aggrandizement&#44; unswayed 
by fear of loss or persecution. 

But as it is undeniable&#44; that we Israelites have at present no 
national government &#59; as our number is but small and unim&#8211; 
portant when compared with the mass of mankind : the pur&#8211; 
suit of our religion may appear unprofitable to many among 
the worldly&#8211;minded&#44; since it can bring them no temporal 
advantages&#44; for there are none in authority who may bestow 
on them offices of trust and profit for their attachment to the 
ancient faith &#59; and the system which we uphold makes often 
strong demand upon our personal convenience and upon the 
riches we may possess. Perhaps the strict observance of our 
law may prevent us from participating in the distribution of 
certain offices&#44; the duties of which may compel us to transgress 
the divine precepts. Again&#44; some one may be induced to plead 

<pb n="4"/>

necessity as an excuse for not adhering very strictly to the 
religion of his forefathers &#59; and he may imagine to himself a 
sufficient number of excuses to lull his conscience to sleep&#44; 
whilst he transgresses the commandments of his God. Never&#8211; 
theless he will assert&#44; that he is a good and truly religious man&#44; 
since he observes what is commonly called the moral duties &#59; 
and he alleges that he fulfils every thing which God can in 
reason ask of him &#59; but he forgets in his self&#8211;gratulation&#44; that 
interest alone&#44; sordid meanness&#44; groveling avarice&#44; and a yield&#8211; 
ing to selfish desires are the true motives of his conduct. And 
can this be religion &#63; is this a display of pure faith &#63; an entire 
reliance on God&#39;s omnipotence &#63; No &#33; Let me tell him that 
he has not true religion in his heart&#44; &#8212; that his soul has not the 
proper reverence of the Lord &#8212; that his confidence is not entire 
in the God who created him. And although it is natural that 
we should be startled at the sight of what are called necessities&#44; 
and although we are very apt to view every obstacle as insur&#8211; 
mountable&#44; provided we can excuse ourselves thereby for not 
doing our duty : we cannot call ourselves good and religious&#44; 
we cannot be said to confide in God&#44; as long as we are deter&#8211; 
red from obeying Him by the dread of evil we may have to 
sufier here&#44; and withheld from engaging in his service by the 
sight of difficulties which we have to encounter &#59; for we are 
not then kindled by that devotion to the will of the Lord which 
will enable us to make personal sacrifices&#44; and to submit to 
dangers in our endeavours to serve Him. 

But&#44; brethren&#44; if interested motives tend so powerfully to 
weaken our confidence in God&#44; there is yet another feeling&#44; 
which may aptly be called self&#8211;sufficiency&#44; against which we 
are to arm ourselves by every means of which we are masters&#44; 
if we wish to lead a religious life. For there are many&#44; who&#44; 
inflated by success in their pursuits&#44; are misled to esteem 
their strength as sufficient to enable them to combat every 
obstacle &#8212; to shield themselves against all vicissitudes &#8212; to break 
down all the barriers which may oppose their success &#59; and&#44; 
therefore&#44; rendered selfish and proud&#44; they neglect to pay due 
deference to religious duties&#44; and they seem to say by their 
conduct : &#34; We need not confide in a providential assistance&#44; 
we desire not any protection and succour from God. Are not

our riches great &#63; has not success uniformly attended our enter&#8211; 
prises &#63; and hesides&#44; were we punished when we disobeyed 
what the weaker and less enlightened part of mankind call the 
divine laws &#63;&#34; But be silent&#44; presumptuous sinners &#59; what 
are ye at best but men &#8212; weak&#44; powerless&#44; short&#8211;sighted mortals. 
Do but look at yourselves&#44; all you who think so much of your 
own capacities &#8212; look at your beginning &#8212; what you were once 
&#8212; what you are now &#8212; and what will you be : and then boast&#44; if 
you dare&#44; of the strength of man &#33; When you were born&#44; you 
were too weak to take care of yourselves&#44; and as helpless children 
you required the nursing hand of your parents. You then 
learned to walk &#59; you were taught to lisp the names of father 
and mother &#59; and how glad were those that watched your 
infancy of the first dawning of infantile strength and infantile 
intellect &#59; and speak&#44; could you then think of accomplishing 
those great designs which 3&#39;&#39;ou now purpose &#63; You next 
grew up apace &#8212; your minds were by degrees stored with 
knowledge &#59; you were taught to reverence the name of God&#44; 
and cheerfully you obeyed the mandates of your loving 
guardians&#59; for your hearts were yet pure&#44; and your innocence 
was not yet tainted by unholy passions &#59; and the days of your 
youth were rich with all the pleasures&#44; which that delightful 
age alone can bestow &#59; but say&#44; did you then nourish those 
views of ambition which now bend your spirits&#44; which now 
make you the slaves of inordinate desires&#63; &#8212; You reach the 
age of manhood &#8212; and you aim to grasp at every thing&#59; nay&#44; 
the world seems hardly large enough to afford you room for the 
exercise of your enterprise &#59; but see you not often your best 
plans frustrated&#63; &#8212; see you not often your strength fail&#44; when 
you think you need but to stretch forth your hand to seize the 
long sought prize&#63; &#8212; And do behold yon infirm old man &#59; he is 
one that has seen pleasure &#8212; has enjoyed riches &#8212; was beloved 
by his family &#8212; respected and reverenced by all who knew 
him &#8212; persons approached him with awe as though he were a 
superior being: &#8212; but look at him now&#44; how he totters along&#44; 
his feet will barely carry him from the spot on which he 
happens to stand&#59; &#8212; look at his dress&#44; it is worn to rags&#59; &#8212; 
look at his sunken eye bedimmed with sorrow &#59; &#8212; and then tell 
me&#44; what is human greatness&#44; what is human glory&#33; But few

days are yet the portion of this stricken old man&#44; and soon he 
must go down to the chill&#44; dark grave&#44; and appear before the 
Supreme Judge of the universe&#44; &#34;where the poor and the rich 
are alike&#44; and where the slave is free from his master.&#34; 

This is human life &#8212; its origin&#44; its fulness&#44; and its close. What 
then hast thou mortal to boast of&#63; Surely not riches&#44; not 
worldly goods&#44; which when obtained are fleeting&#44; and soon lost&#44; 
though obtained with great labour &#59; but only the soul within 
thee&#44; which feels&#44; which thinks&#44; which prompts thee to action &#59; 
this is thy riches&#44; thy portion&#44; thy imperishable inheritance 
from thy God. And can she feel aught of delight at thy 
hoarded riches&#63; can she feel pleasure because thou dwellest in 
a palace&#63; can she be benefitted&#44; when thou hast hundreds of 
menials that are ready at thy nod&#63; &#8212; No&#44; thou mistakest the 
truth &#59; she feels no pleasure on account of thy wealth &#59; she is 
only delighted when thou art good and virtuous&#44; when thy 
confidence in God enables thee to be above mean desire and 
sordid avarice&#44; and when thou art man enough to defy every 
obstacle which may oppose thee in the acquisition of virtue. 
For when our mortal career is closed&#44; when the soul ascends to 
God&#44; she needs no longer the blessings which this life can 
afford &#59; and nothing but virtue and piety remain to her then 
from her sojournment on earth. 

Our wise men illustrate this by the following parable: A 
certain man had three friends&#44; to one of whom he was devotedly 
attached &#59; to the second he was kind&#44; but he did not esteem 
him by far as much as the first&#59; to the third&#44; however&#44; he paid 
but little regard&#44; and scarcely ever thought of him. It happened 
one day&#44; that this man was suddenly summoned before the 
king&#59; and not knowing the cause of the unexpected summons&#44; 
or perhaps dreading to appear before the king without a 
powerful defender to assist him in case of necessity: he applied 
to the first of his friends&#44; being sure&#44; that he would not refuse 
him his countenance in the present emergency. The friend&#44; 
however&#44; did refuse&#44; excusing himself&#44; saying : &#34; I really 
cannot go &#59; I am so much occupied with my own concerns&#44; that 
it is impossible for me to assist you now&#59; besides this&#44; I have 
no influence with the king.&#34; &#8212; He then went to the second&#44; who 
answered : &#34; I can do but little for you &#59; but as we have been 

<pb n="7"/>

CONFIDENCE IN GOD. 7 

friends so long&#44; I will accompany you as far as the palace&#8211;gate&#44; 
more than that I cannot do.&#34; &#8212; Finding himself so rudely 
treated by his most intimate friends&#44; he applied to the last&#44; 
whom he had so long neglected. This one&#44; who in fact had 
always loved him more than either of the others&#44; received him 
with open arms&#44; saying : &#34; How glad I am&#44; my dear friend&#44; 
that you have given me this opportunity of serving you &#59; I will 
go with you to the king&#44; I will remain with you&#44; and defend 
you if necessary.&#34; 

The moral of the foregoing is&#44; that a man generally values 
his riches more than his relatives and friends&#44; and these again 
more than his religion&#44; which is&#44; alas&#33; like the last friend in the 
parable&#44; too often neglected and almost forgotten. He is finally 
summoned to appear before the King of kings&#44; the Holy One&#44; 
praised be He &#59; his money avails him nothing &#59; this must be left 
behind &#59; his relatives and friends accompany him to the grave&#44; 
there they must leave him &#59; and thus his virtues and good deeds 
alone remain with him&#44; to go with him to the tribunal of the 
Judge of all to defend him and to plead in his favour. &#8212; Why 
then should we turn our whole attention to the acquisition of 
wealth&#44; &#8212; why should we be so sedulous to make friends &#8212; when 
these riches&#44; and these friends&#44; are eventually of so little real 
benefit to us&#63; In saying this&#44; I must not be misunderstood as 
inculcating&#44; that it is wrong to endeavour to become rich&#44; or to 
acquire friends &#59; for my intention only is to impress your minds 
with the folly of continually searching for wealth&#44; of that 
anxious solicitude to have a large number of admirers&#44; and 
thereby neglecting the more necessary duties&#44; which are&#44; the 
perfecting of yourselves in the fear of the Lord and the love 
towards man. In a word&#44; the possession of riches should be 
the secondary object&#44; the possession of virtue however the 
chief&#44; as it is the true&#44; aim of life. 

&#39; It may indeed happen&#44; that persons less religious&#44; less moral&#44; 
less beloved&#44; than yourselves may possess a larger portion of 
worldly blessings &#59; but can this be an excuse for you to follow 
their example&#63; Do you not know : &#34;That only a short time 
elapses&#44; and the wicked is gone&#44; and you search his place 
carefully&#44; and he is no more&#63;&#34; &#8212; Perhaps you may never live 
to see the punishment of the man&#44; whom you think yourselves 
justified in calling wicked &#59; but reflect&#44; that it is not for you to

determine&#44; who is guilty&#44; or who is innocent&#59; there is one 
Judge&#44; who searches the heart. He knows the true desires of 
each man&#39;s spirit&#59; and many a one&#44; whom you think very bad&#44; 
may have hidden virtues&#44; and many an outwardly pious man 
may be actuated by wicked motives. It is in fact the perfection 
of our confidence in God&#44; that we never find fault with his 
dispensations&#44; and that we always cheerfully acquiesce in his 
decisions&#44; be they for us or against us. Even if we should be 
conscious&#44; that we have done nothing to deserve misfortune&#44; 
&#40;yet where is that man who never sinneth&#63;) we ought&#44; never&#8211; 
theless&#44; to submit patiently to the dispensation of Heaven&#44; and 
resign ourselves to his decree&#44; since it is perhaps the rod held 
over us&#44; which prevents us from following in the paths of 
sinners. For it may be known to the Infinite Wisdom&#44; that 
prosperity would make us forgetful of his will&#44; that elated 
with success we might ascribe this success to our own strength&#44; 
and forget&#44; &#34; that it is He alone who enables us to acquire 
wealth.&#34; And is it then not better for our everlasting happi&#8211; 
ness&#44; that we remain&#44; whilst in this world&#44; in humble circum&#8211; 
stances&#63; Every one of you can answer this question for 
himself&#44; for it needs not my admonition to convince you&#44; that 
eteiniily ought to be more regarded than evanescent time. 

If&#44; therefore&#44; we should be overtaken by misfortunes&#44; if we 
even see our fondest hopes blighted&#44; if those we love most are 
torn from our embrace in the prime of youthful life: we should 
reflect&#44; that He who has wounded us&#44; can also apply the heal&#8211; 
ing balsam to the wound&#44; and that He never punishes a man 
beyond his strength of enduring. And if we are destined to 
suffer much&#44; we shall have an equal share of firmness to suffer 
with patience and resignation&#44; and thus must the evil even tend 
to fortify us more strongly in the fear of God&#44; and in the con&#8211; 
fidence we should feel in Him &#59; and unhappiness&#44; therefore&#44; 
which lasts but a short time&#44; may be the cause of permanent 
happiness and undying bliss. 

If thus an individual is to feel an unwavering&#44; filial&#44; con&#8211; 
fidence in his Creator&#44; it becomes no less obligatory upon Jews&#44; 
as a nation&#44; to trust unshrinkingly&#44; without murmuring&#44; without 
searching in the decrees of his unsearchable wisdom&#44; in the 
God of our fathers&#44; who has sustained us through so many ages 
of persecution and oppression. For if we ask : &#34; Why are we 

<pb n="9"/>

CONFIDENCE IN GOD. 9 

to suffer so much more than any other people&#63;&#34; we should 
answer ourselves&#44; that we are punished for our manifold trans&#8211; 
gressions &#59; for our having broken the covenant which the Lord 
made with us &#59; for our having been disunited among ourselves&#44; 
and for being even at this very moment still unworthy of the 
great and glorious happiness promised to us through the mouth 
of nearly all the prophets. It therefore came to pass&#44; that&#44; as 
the prophet says : &#34; God was as an enemy towards us &#59;&#34; He pu&#8211; 
nished us severely&#44; as though He were an enemy&#44; as though He 
despised Israel &#59; but in reality only to make us feel the great 
burden of our sins&#44; to awaken us to a consideration of our fallen 
moral state&#44; and to induce us thereby to mend our ways&#44; and 
to return to Him&#44; the Lord&#44; whom we have forsaken. The 
refiner melts not the gold to destroy it&#44; but to purify it from 
the admixture of impure matter. Just so is the long captivity 
of the Israelites to be regarded &#8212; as a process by which the 
Eternal One endeavours to purify us from sin &#59; to restore us at 
the last to our land cleansed from our transgressions&#59; and to 
cause our virtue to shine with a tenfold greater lustre&#44; than it 
ever has done&#44; since we received the law from Sinai. We 
ought&#44; therefore&#44; to confide truly in God&#44; and always look 
forward with an unshaken and undiminished hope to our resto&#8211; 
ration to the land of Israel&#44; and to abide faithful to the covenant 
which God made with our ancestors&#44; undeterred by the hatred 
and persecution of the gentiles. And if we have always done 
this&#44; we may then say&#44; &#34; on that day &#40;when God has restored 
us) : Behold this is our God in whom we have trusted&#44; and He 
will save us &#59; this is the Lord in whom we have trusted&#44; and 
we will be glad and rejoiced through his salvation.&#34; 

May the Lord then have mercy on us all&#44; and bring back 
the captives of his people&#44; who confide in Him and await his 
salvation. May He bless us all and preserve us &#59; may He let 
his countenance shine unto us&#44; and be gracious to us &#59; may He 
lift up his countenance unto us and grant us peace&#44; at this time&#44; 
and give us everlasting rest from all oppression&#44; and security 
from war and desolation in our own land at the coming of 
his anointed one&#44; the son of David&#33; Amen.

DISCOURSE II. 

WANT OF FAITH. 

Creator of all&#44; Thou&#44; whose glory fills the world&#44; we adore 
Thee and confide in thee&#44; because of thy goodness. We 
humbly approach thy sanctuary and ask thy protection. 
grant us prosperity&#44; and relieve us from all affliction &#59; and if we 
even be not worthy of thy bounties&#44; do Thou show us thy 
mercies for the sake of thy holy name&#44; by which we are called. 
Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

When I addressed you last&#44; I endeavoured to point out the 
necessity of confiding in God in all our transactions. If we 
now come to examine the nature of this confiding more closely&#44; 
it will become evident&#44; that this virtue is the parent of all 
other virtues&#44; whereas the want of it will expose us to the 
commission of all kinds of sin. The man&#44; who truly confides 
in God&#44; will need no other incentive to the practice of religious 
duties&#44; for he will say on every occasion : &#34; It is my God who 
demands the observance of this duty from me&#44; it is my Creator&#44; 
who forbids the perpetration of this act &#59; and as He asks nothing&#44; 
which is beyond my strength to accomplish&#44; and as He desires 
my happiness only: common feelings of gratitude compel me to 
obey his precepts.&#34; But what can the wavering man oppose to 
his passions&#63; He loves not his maker&#63; &#8212; his God is to him as 
an unknown stranger&#44; and the precepts of the law&#44; if observed 
at all&#44; are viewed as a task&#44; a burden almost too heavy to be 
borne. An opportunity of sinning is offered to him&#44; his pas&#8211; 
sions are roused&#44; the fear of God raises but a feeble voice of 
warning within his bosom &#59; and he falls &#8212; yes&#44; falls deeper&#44; than 
he had any reason even to expect in the first instance of his 
yielding to his inclinations. For the path of virtue is a slip&#8211; 
pery ascent&#44; the summit of which can be reached only by un&#8211; 
remitted toiling and untiring vigilance &#59; but wo to us&#44; if we 
confide not strongly in Him&#44; who calls encouragingly down to 

<pb n="11"/>

WANT OF FAITH. 11 

US from the highest point of elevation&#44; to despise danger and 
ascend fearlessly&#59; for if his voice remains unheeded&#44; and we 
give way to our natural apprehensions&#44; we lose our footing and 
glide down unawares&#44; and if we cannot catch at an impending 
bough or a prominent crag in our descent&#44; we must reach&#44; alas&#44; 
too soon&#33; the very bottom of the hill&#44; and thus &#40;to drop the 
metaphor) instead of being virtuous&#44; as we had intended to be&#44; 
we become depraved sinners &#8212; solely&#44; because we were too in&#8211; 
dolent&#44; too confiding in our own abilities&#44; to overcome the 
desires of a passion&#44; or the impulse of some unhallowed feel&#8211; 
ing&#44; when it was yet time to save us&#44; when a slight exertion of 
confidence in the divine guidance might yet have shielded us 
against all attacks of selfishness&#44; of avarice&#44; and of pride. 

And how often have we not all been the sorrowful witnesses 
of the fatal effects of such a want of faith&#44; as just described. 
Many there were&#44; who in the outset of their irreligious career 
transgressed but in some small&#44; immaterial&#44; as they thought&#44; 
ceremonial duty&#44; they sipped&#44; as it were&#44; but slightly of the 
poisonous&#42; bowl &#59; but point by point the duties of revelation 
were all neglected&#44; till the sinners themselves were astonished 
at the distance which separated them from their God. Perhaps 
the first step was the partaking of the food which the law for&#8211; 
bids to the sons of Israel &#59; then the holy day of the Lord was 
neglected &#59; anon a daughter of the stranger was chosen the 
companion of a descendant of Abraham&#44; and an abjuration of 
the religion promulgated by Moses completed at length the 
circle of transgressions against the will of our Maker. And 
all this was caused&#44; by the want of a singleness of faith&#44; by the 
absence of an entire filial reliance on the goodness and truth of 
God &#59; for if a man does truly confide and believe&#44; he will have 
a great protection against sin&#44; and if he in an evil hour should 
transgress&#44; he will hasten with contrition and sorrow to seek 
the forgiveness of the Omniscient One for the wrono&#59; he has 
done&#44; and endeavour to deserve pardon and mercy by a more 
careful regard to the duties incumbent on him. But where 
faith is wanting&#44; where confidence does not dwell trium&#8211; 
phant in the soul&#44; the passions can reign unrestrained &#59; and 
when sin has once got a hold of such a heart&#44; the course of 
apostacy will be pursued perhaps to destruction &#59; and it often 

<pb n="12"/>

happens&#44; that so strong are the bonds of wickedness&#44; so power&#8211; 
ful the charms of ungodliness&#44; that the sinner perishes without 
atoning for his misdeeds&#44; without an endeavour to appease the 
Creator&#44; whose holy spirit he has vexed by his iniquity. 

This is the fruit of want of confidence in individuals &#59; but 
nations also may be exposed to the same cause of sin&#44; and whole 
communities may be lost by not guarding themselves carefully 
against the attacks of pusillanimousness on the one side&#44; and 
pride and arrogance on the other. A most striking example&#44; 
one which is no doubt familiar to you all&#44; is given to us in the 
portion of the Law&#44; which we read this morning. &#8212; The Israelites 
had been redeemed from Egypt in a miraculous manner&#44; and 
had received the law from Sinai&#44; as a guide for them in all 
the transactions of life. They had also been promised&#44; that 
they should inherit the land of Canaan&#44; now known as Pales&#8211; 
tine. They were on their journey to this delightful country&#44; 
under the guidance of the great Moses&#44; who had been the in&#8211; 
strument in the hand of God&#44; of affecting their deliverance. 
They ought&#44; therefore&#44; to have had confidence .enough in the 
Power&#44; who had protected them thus far&#44; to advance boldly&#44; 
without regarding any impediment which might oppose them. 
But no&#44; they required that spies should be sent out&#44; who were 
to report to them the nature of the country&#44; so that they might 
be enabled &#34; to know the road they were to go&#44; and the cities 
they should come to.&#34; &#40;Deut. i. 22.) Now mark the conse&#8211; 
quence. If the Israelites had firmly relied on God&#39;s assistance&#44; 
and had fearlessly advanced to the conquest of the holy land&#44; the 
very persons&#44; who had been redeemed from Egyptian bondage&#44; 
would also have been permitted to enjoy in Palestine all the 
comforts which freemen feel in their own land. But owing to 
their fear of what might occur to them in their expedition&#44; they 
demanded having some previous knowledge of the country. 
But as this desire was not absolutely sinful&#44; since we should at 
all times apply natural means to obtain natural ends&#44; and as 
spies are always employed to obtain all the information of local&#8211; 
ities and peculiar features of a country to be invaded which can 
be useful to the invaders : Moses received the sanction of God 
to send twelve men&#44; one from each tribe&#44; who vshould be chiefs 
in their own divisions. To these Moses gave particular direc&#8211; 

<pb n="13"/>

tions&#44; and requested them to be very circumstantial in their 
report. After spending forty days in the survey of Palestine&#44; 
they returned to the assembled congregation&#44; and ten out of the 
twelve magnified existing dangers&#44; and invented others which 
existed only in their imagination. This was enough for the 
wavering multitude. They had now&#44; as they thought&#44; sufficient 
foundation for their previously entertained fears &#59; they rose in 
tumult against the messenger of God&#44; and complained bitterly 
of their fate&#44; in being destined&#44; together with their wives and 
children&#44; to fall by the sword of the enemy&#44; and they even dis&#8211; 
cussed the propriety of appointing a chief&#44; who should lead 
them back to Egypt&#44; where they had been held as slaves&#44; cruelly 
beaten&#44; and their children murdered. All gratitude to Moses&#44; 
all trust in the magnanimous chief&#44; were suddenly dissipated&#44; 
and they painted him in their fancy as an artful deceiver&#44; who 
had only freed them from one danger&#44; to make them perish by 
the sword of the lawless freebooters of the desert&#44; and the 
fierce population of a well&#8211;fortified country. This&#44; indeed&#44; 
was rebellion against the Almighty&#44; when men&#44; who had so 
largely partaken of his bounty&#44; could think of rejecting the 
leaders whom He had appointed for them&#44; and talk of returning 
to the land of a tyrant&#44; from whose grasp his almighty power had 
but so lately saved them. Moses and his faithful brother were 
sorely grieved&#44; &#8212; they felt their inability of stemming the power&#8211; 
ful opposition&#44; &#8212; they were shocked at the folly and wickedness 
of a people for whom they had done so much already&#44; and were 
willing to do even more&#59; and they fell upon their faces before the 
whole congregation&#44; imagining perhaps&#44; that these might be 
restored to a proper mode of thinking&#44; at seeing their formerly 
trusted leaders prostrate before them in the dust. But although 
the multitude had thus shown how little faith was in them&#44; there 
were still remaining two fearless men&#44; who never had for a 
moment lost their firm conviction of the power of the Lord&#44; 
and their confidence in his providence. These were the re&#8211; 
nowned champions of our nation&#44; Joshua and Caleb &#59; who with 
their garments rent&#44; in order to prove how deeply they mourn&#8211; 
ed for the unfortunate and wicked crowd&#44; stepped forward from 
amidst the uproar and confusion&#44; endeavouring to appease the 
tumult and rebellion&#44; and thus they spoke &#40;Numb. xiv. 7&#8211;9&#44;) : 
VOL. I. &#8212; 2 

<pb n="14"/>

14 WANT OF FAITH. 

&#34;The land through which we have passed&#44; to survey it&#44; this land is very 
good. If the Lord is pleased with us&#44; He will bring us unto this land&#44; and 
give it to us&#44; a land&#44; which overflows with milk and honey. Only act not 
rebelliously against the Lord&#44; and then you need not fear the people of the 
land&#44; for they are our bread &#40;. e. we can easily overcome them) &#59; their 
shadow &#40;God&#39;s protection) has departed from them&#44; whilst the Lord is with 
us&#59; be you therefore not afraid of them.&#34; 

You will observe&#44; brethren&#44; that in this address Joshua and 
Caleb wished to upbraid the people for their want of confidence 
in God. They&#44; therefore&#44; placed the land which they had 
visited in a prominent light before them&#44; and painted it as a 
country which they ought to desire to possess&#44; as a gift worthy 
to be conferred by God on his people. They then continued 
by observing&#44; that this great prize might readily be obtained&#44; 
if they would but deserve his favour&#44; by obeying his will &#59; for 
in this case&#44; he would surrender the powerful and armed inha&#8211; 
bitants into their hands&#44; although they were as yet unused to 
war. But they&#44; who had acted rebelliously towards God&#44; and 
ungratefully towards his chosen messenger&#44; would not listen to 
the wholesome admonitions of these two pious men&#44; nay &#8212; they 
even threatened&#44; in their rage&#44; to sacrifice them to their resent&#8211; 
ment. But&#44; see&#33; the glory of God was suddenly revealed to 
the sinful and sinless ones&#44; and the arms of the rebels were 
paralyzed&#44; whilst the firm adherents of God were inspired with 
new confidence. Many times before this&#44; the descent of the 
divine revelation had been a sign of redemption and grace to 
the Israelites &#59; but now&#44; on the contrary&#44; the spirit of prophecy 
was revealed to Moses to announce the impending doom and 
suffering of the hitherto beloved people of God. The judg&#8211; 
ment indeed was severe&#59; but their offence had also been great&#44; 
and their desire to add murder to rebellion called loudly for 
vengeance. And thus spoke the Most High to Moses : 

<pb n="15"/>

WANT OF FAITH. 15 

&#34; How long will this people incense me&#44; and how Ions&#59; will 
they not believe in me&#44; despite of all the wonders which I have 
done in the midst of them. I will smite them with a pesti&#8211; 
lence and extirpate them&#44; and make thee &#40;Moses) a people 
greater and stronger than they are.&#34; 

We find here&#44; that God spoke&#44; as though he wished to ex&#8211; 
terminate the whole race of Israelites for their want of reliance 
upon his protection&#44; because of their unbelief. &#8212; Let us pause 
here&#44; and view the good leader&#44; &#40;who had been selected from 
the whole nation as their mediator with God&#44;) standing before 
the Almighty&#44; and praying for the ungrateful people&#44; who had 
but just attempted to slay those who had remained friendly to 
him. He recounted the miracles which God had displayed 
amongst Israel&#44; and continued &#59; &#34; And now&#44; I pray thee&#44; to let 
thy great power be displayed&#44; Lord &#33; as Thou hast spoken&#44; 
saying: The Lord withholdeth his anger long&#44; is full of kind&#8211; 
ness&#44; pardoneth sin and transgression&#44; but suffereth nothing to 
go unpunished &#59; who visiteth the sin of the fathers upon the 
children&#44; upon the third and the fourth generation. pardon 
Thou the sin of this people&#44; according to thy great kindness&#44; 
and as Thou hast also been indulgent to this people from Egypt 
to this place.&#34; Moses&#44; as will be seen&#44; expressed in this 
prayer his wish&#44; that the punishment of Israel might be avert&#8211; 
ed&#44; that they might live and reform their ways&#44; so as again to 
deserve a renewal of God&#39;s favour. And great&#44; indeed&#44; is the 
goodness of God&#44; and infinite are his mercies &#33; and He an&#8211; 
swered : 1131D &#34;nnSo &#34; I pardon according to thy word.&#34; 
In this emphatic expression of Holy Writ &#8212; more beautiful by 
far than tongue can express &#8212; was announced the salvation of 
the Israelitish people&#44; and the decree of their extermination 
revoked&#59; and those only&#44; who had at that time reached the age 
of twenty years&#44; and who had all been guilty of rebellion&#44; 
were doomed to perish in the wilderness&#44; that they might ex&#8211; 
perience the dreadful consequences&#44; which must ensue&#44; when 
God withdraws his favour from man. For forty years they 
thus wandered about in the trackless wilderness&#44; and by degrees 
all perished&#44; against whom the decree had gone forth. But 
even from this generation the manifest providence of God was 
not withheld. Food was provided for them in plenty&#44; their 

<pb n="16"/>

garments did not wear off from their bodies&#44; nor their sandals 
from their feet&#44; and in the most barren soil&#44; water was always 
ready for them to refresh their parched lips&#44; when they were 
almost sinking beneath the scorching heat of a cloudless sun. 
Thus they performed their pilgrimage from station to station&#44; 
under the doom and under the protection of Heaven &#59; their 
children grew up to manhood&#44; and the matrons of Yeshurun&#44; 
saw a new race springing up around them&#44; a race&#44; pure from 
foreign admixture &#8212; reared under the wise counsel and whole&#8211; 
some instruction of the father of the prophets &#8212; and destined 
by the will of the All&#8211;seeing One to inherit that land&#44; which 
their fathers had forfeited by their repeated acts of rebellion. 

In the foregoing remarks&#44; 1 have endeavoured to sketch&#44; in a 
few words&#44; an imperfect picture of a part of the history of our 
people &#59; an elaborate exhibition thereof would be needless&#44; 
since the words of Scripture&#44; the portion&#44; namely&#44; which we 
read to&#8211;day&#44; are so sublime&#44; that nothing is left to be added to 
an account so perfect in every respect. It only therefore 
remains for me to draw your attention to the cause of this 
defection and this punishment. Many&#44; no doubt&#44; among you&#44; 
will pass unqualified censure upon the conduct of our ancestors&#59; 
they will probably imagine&#44; that they would not have acted so 
under any circumstances. Now it is perfectly correct&#44; that you 
should heartily condemn that which met the disapprobation and 
chastisement of our heavenly Father &#59; but do not therefore&#44; 
triumphing in the consciousness of your innocence&#44; look back 
with contempt upon your misguided forefathers. Let rather 
the example of their sin be a warning to you all &#59; an example&#44; 
recorded by the inspired historian&#44; to teach you a useful lesson 
of morality&#44; and it is your duty to reflect carefully upon the 
causes which proved their ruin&#44; that you may endeavour to 
escape the snare which caused their fall. Our ancestors trans&#8211; 
gressed&#44; because they had no firm faith in God &#59; and so may 
every one of us sin&#44; if he does not carefully guard himself by 
faith and confidence in the Supreme&#44; at the very outset of life. 
For only in case we commence our career with a pious resolu&#8211; 
tion of being religious&#44; only if we on every occasion place the 
sincerest confidence in the goodness of our Father : we have 
some reason to hope that we may&#44; like Joshua and Caleb&#44; remain 

<pb n="17"/>

WANT OF FAITH. 17 

firm and true to the cause of religion&#44; even when all around us 
swerve from the way of righteousness &#59; and only by a meek 
resignation to God&#39;s decrees&#44; free from an overweening pride&#44; 
which would prompt us to display our piety to the world 
in order to show how much better we are than others&#44; can we 
hope to be rewarded with the peculiar favour of God&#44; as were 
these two pious men&#44; whose history we have read in this day&#39;s 
portion. &#8212; But if&#44; on the other hand&#44; we commence in early 
youth a life of dissipation&#44; push the admonitions of conscience 
with both hands&#44; as it were&#44; from us &#59; if the laxity of our reli&#8211; 
gious hope does not enable us to resist temptations&#44; and to disre&#8211; 
gard the slight obstacles which every now and then must 
oppose themselves to our religious improvement&#44; how can we 
expect to perform well our part during a long course of life&#44; 
where we may have to encounter opposition not yet thought of 
even&#63; &#8212; Let me therefore admonish you&#44; my brethren&#44; to watch 
over yourselves with a careful eye&#44; even at the outset of life &#59; 
to excuse none of your faults and follies to yourselves &#59; but to 
let it be your constant endeavour to trace every one of your 
actions to the secret source whence it springs&#59; to look always 
upon the Deity as your support in all difficulties&#44; and to his 
presence as your destined home. &#8212; If you do this&#44; you may 
fearlessly enter life with a joyous heart &#59; your travelling upon 
the road of earthly existence will then bring you nearer&#44; step 
by step&#44; to the desired summit &#59; and the little obstacles you 
may meet with on the way&#44; the slight shocks you may receive 
whilst pursuing your journey will make you more circumspect&#44; 
and render your next step always surer. Thus you will live 
as pious men &#8212; thus you&#44; daughters of Zion&#44; will be the joy of 
your fathers&#44; the delight of your husbands&#44; and a blessing to 
your children &#59; &#8212; and thus we all may&#44; after a well&#8211;spent life&#44; 
hope to enter the presence of our God in purity and innocence&#44; 
there to enjoy the delights at his right hand for ever. Amen.

To the Almighty Father&#44; who made his covenant with 
Abraham&#44; renewed his oath to Isaac&#44; and confirmed his pro&#8211; 
mise to Jacob&#44; and who chose our ancestors to be his people&#44; 
be praise and glory for everlasting. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

In all things which a man undertakes&#44; a certain degree of 
activity&#44; promptness&#44; and decision is necessary&#44; without which 
the best laid plans must be unsuccessful. The merchant thus 
in the pursuit of his business&#44; always endeavours to secure to 
himself the earliest custom&#44; and is even apprehensive&#44; lest an&#8211; 
other should forestall him in a certain transaction&#44; or altogether 
prevent him from participating therein. &#8212; The mechanic tries 
to finish his wares in due time&#44; that he may be enabled to meet 
the expected demand as early as any other of his craft&#44; and in 
order to draw upon himself a great share of public attention&#44; he 
strives to improve upon former models&#44; and invent new and useful 
things. &#8212; The man of learning in his endeavours to push himself 
forward&#44; employs all his energy to claim a share of public pa&#8211; 
tronage&#44; and is always solicitous that no one shall despoil 
him of the honours&#44; which he conceives to be his due. &#8212; The 
soldier&#44; who is entrusted with the command of an army&#44; is 
ever on the alert to discover where and when he can strike a 
decisive blow &#59; and he would think himself highly blame&#8211; 
worthy&#44; were he to suffer himself to be anticipated&#44; or to be 
taken by surprise by the enemy. All the classes of men just 
enumerated&#44; and all others engaged in various other pursuits&#44; 
think themselves bound to aim at being successful in their re&#8211; 
spective stations&#44; and they accordingly regard not any labour 
as too great&#44; nor any exertion as too troublesome&#44; which may 
promote their several objects. &#8212; We thus see&#44; that in all con&#8211; 
cerns of life&#44; where worldly success is the goal&#44; and the dis&#8211;

tinction for riches&#44; skill&#44; fame&#44; and bravery the stake&#44; the 
desired end will stimulate man to do all he can to deserve and 
ensure their fortunate consummation. 

But if we take a calm view of all earthly blessings&#44; of what&#8211; 
ever may be apportioned to us here&#44; we m.ust inevitably be 
struck with their uncertainty of duration&#44; and the small share 
of real enjoyment they can afford&#44; even if possessed in their 
fullest extent. If then the acquisition of these demands so 
much perseverance and application&#44; how much more do those • 
things deserve this ardour in searching&#44; the possession of 
which is permanent&#44; and which afford us imperishable enjoy&#8211; 
ment&#63; I allude&#44; as you no doubt know already&#44; to the acqui&#8211; 
sition of pious feelings and the practice of virtuous deeds&#59; since 
these are they&#44; which confer upon us&#44; in whatever part of the 
world&#44; in whatever state of life we may be&#44; the most lasting 
and unalloyed enjoyment&#59; for piety will solace the mind even 
in affliction&#44; and the consciousness of having done our duty&#44; 
and of having accumulated a stock of virtuous deeds&#44; will at 
all times give us a sincere pleasure &#8212; a pleasure unmixed by 
regret or compunctions of conscience. But to acquire virtue 
we must also make great exertions &#59; for if we remain inactive 
in this pursuit&#44; if we should be careless of what means we 
employ&#44; or fearful of outward circumstances&#44; we can never 
become virtuous&#59; for know&#33; that unless we strain every nerve 
to conquer our sinful propensities&#44; we can never hope of being 
ultimately that&#44; for which the Lord of all has destined us. 
Because there is so much to distract our attention&#44; so many cir&#8211; 
cumstances calculated to lead us&#44; if I may use the expression&#44; 
into the by&#8211;paths of religion&#44; that a constant vigilance&#44; and 
withal an anxious and oft&#8211;repeated examination of ourselves 
become absolutely necessary to preserve us pure whilst we are 
yet innocent&#44; or to restore us to the love of our God&#44; if we 
have once strayed from the road which He has marked out to 
us as the way of everlasting life and happiness. But if we 
allow ourselves to be called away by outward circumstances&#44; be 
they those of fancied necessity or inviting pleasure&#44; if we&#44; even 
for a brief space of time&#44; actually cease to watch our desires 
and to combat our passions : we must sin from mere thought&#8211; 
lessness&#44; and we may thus become gradually depraved and be led 

<pb n="20"/>

into the depth of wickedness&#44; without even heeding that we 
are treading the path of death. 

But&#44; independently of carelessness&#44; there is another fruitful 
cause of transgression &#8212; the fear of ridicule&#44; namely&#44; which is 
apt to exercise&#44; alas &#33; a very baneful influence over the opinions 
of many&#44; who are not yet initiated in vice&#44; nor firmly esta&#8211; 
blished in piety. There is a considerable number of men&#44; even 
among those endowed with a high degree of intellect&#44; who are 
always afraid of incurring the ridicule of those they are placed 
amongst&#44; and they will accordingly omit doing many things for 
fear of this ridicule of their associates. This is chiefly the case 
with young persons that associate with those of their own age&#44; 
who are heedless and extravagant&#44; and&#44; as they call it them&#8211; 
selves&#44; gay and cheerful. But this gaiety and this cheerfulness 
are not of that harmless kind whicli is the offspring of conscious 
innocence &#59; but consist of a certain indulgence in dissipation 
and an occasional deviation from religious duties&#44; which these 
gay young persons often permit themselves under the excuse : 
&#34; It is time enough to grow more serious when we grow older.&#34; 
A timid person coming in contact with such society is very apt 
to be withheld from pursuing the virtuous bend of his own 
inclinations&#44; and is often induced to take part in their dissipa&#8211; 
tion solely from fear of being called by them a dull fellow&#44; or an 
unsociable being&#59; and&#44; therefore&#44; the want o&#40; rnor a I courage may 
be the cause of his becoming every hour more withdrawn from 
the path of righteousness&#44; and of being numbered at the last 
amongst the dissolute and vvorthless&#44; whose only aim is to live 
for the gratification of their passions&#44; and who pride themselves 
at not being checked in their downward course by those little 
restraints which the religious part of mankind willingly impose 
upon their desires. &#8212; Having premised thus much&#44; let us next 
proceed to the consideration of the following&#44; from the fifth 
chapter of the Proverbs of the Fathers : 

&#34; Yehudah son of Thaymah said: Be as bold as the tiger&#44; fleet as the 
eagle&#44; swift as the deer&#44; and strong as the lion&#44; to do the will of thy Father 
that is in heaven.&#34; 

<pb n="21"/>

PIOUS ENERGY. 21 

To explain the intent of this sage advice&#44; let us investigate 
briefly the causes which withhold many persons from the prac&#8211; 
tice of virtue. Some are afraid to act according to their own 
conviction &#59; they fancy that they will expose themselves to the 
hatred of their powerful irreligious neighbours &#59; or they expect 
to derive a benefit from some one if they agree with him in 
outward conformity to certain rites and ceremonies &#59; or as said 
already&#44; they fear to encounter the ridicule of the thoughtless &#59; 
and from one or all of these circumstances combined they prac&#8211; 
tise the evil&#44; not perhaps from any love of sin itself&#44; but from 
mere faintheartedness or motives of interest&#44; their moral courage 
not being strong enough to enable them to combat the misgivings 
of fear&#44; or the cravings of worldly gain. To men like these 
the moralist says : &#34; Be as bold as the tiger to do the will of 
thy Father in heaven &#33;&#34; regard not the hatred of the powerful&#44; 
despise the sneers of the godless&#44; turn a deaf ear to the induce&#8211; 
ments which strangers to God&#39;s worship and seducers may 
hold out&#44; and defy all boldly&#44; as the tiger defies the attacks of all 
other animals&#44; and only obey the will of your Father that is in 
heaven. Let his fear always be upon you &#59; and reflect that 
his power is greater by far than that of the most powerful man. 
Why then should you fear mortals more &#63; Consider that He 
takes no frivolous excuses as a justification of your follies. 
Why then should the laughter of foolish sinners withdraw you 
from this service &#63; Know also&#44; that this bounty and beneficence 
are as unlimited as his power. Why then should hopes of gain 
or the expectation of being actually paid for apostacy&#44; be any 
inducement to you to neglect your duties&#44; and prevent you 
from following the divine precepts&#44; which were given to pro&#8211; 
mote your own happiness &#63; 

There is another class of men whose delight is to see every 
thing&#44; and whose curiosity prompts them to investigate every 
transaction of life&#44; and to study every kind of society : they 
think it will improve them&#44; and give them a knowledge of cha&#8211; 
racter&#44; and an insight into the motives and doings of men. 
And really it must be confessed&#44; that such a curiosity&#44; when 
properly exercised&#44; must give a knowledge of human nature 
both necessary and agreeable&#44; which can hardly be obtained in 
any other way than by actual personal observation. Still if it 

<pb n="22"/>

22 PIOUS ENERGY. 

is not properly controlled&#44; it has also a great disadvantage&#44; as it 
is apt to make us familiar with vice &#59; for if we are indiscrimi&#8211; 
nately curious&#44; we may be led to seek had society&#44; in order to 
understand that also thoroughly&#44; and to know whatever is com&#8211; 
mitted there. But it must be remembered&#44; that if we enter the 
company of the wicked&#44; and repeat our visits often&#44; we are very 
apt to lose the horror we at first felt for the follies we see prac&#8211; 
tised there : we become&#44; as it were&#44; enamoured of what we 
once so thoroughly detested&#44; and we fall by degrees into the pit&#44; 
which we approached merely from idle curiosity&#44; and which we 
might have easily avoided if we had but kept in the right way&#44; 
regardless of its existence. Again&#44; some belonging to this class 
make a trial of vice from mere curiosity&#44; imagining&#44; that it will 
be easy for them to leave off whenever they may feel inclined&#59; 
but they forget that vice lays hold of a man&#39;s mind&#44; blinds his 
understanding and warps his judgment&#44; and that it does require 
the greatest exertions to throw off evil habits when once con&#8211; 
tracted &#59; and they do not reflect&#44; that evil habits are soon con&#8211; 
tracted&#44; and that one sin is generally the forerunner of another. 
Some also think that they may safely skim lightly over the 
surface of sin &#59; that they may with impunity be guilty of the 
lesser moral offences : but they are like those that play care&#8211; 
lessly at the edge of some frightful precipice&#44; heedless of dan&#8211; 
ger &#59; yet suddenly their head becomes giddy&#44; their sight fails&#44; 
and they fall unresistingly almost into the jaws of destruction. 
This precisely is the case of those&#44; who think themselves 
secure in the habitual commission of some small errors&#44; and 
believe themselves not guilty of any crime by so doing &#59; but 
suddenly&#44; perhaps&#44; unconsciously to themselves&#44; they may 
plunge into real vice &#59; when nothing can save them but a 
speedy repentance &#59; which&#44; however distasteful to their self&#8211; 
love&#44; must be vigorously pursued&#44; if they at all desire to reco&#8211; 
ver their lost innocence. Rabbi Yehudah therefore advises all 
men : &#34; Be as fleet as the eagle to do the will of thy Father in 
heaven &#33;&#34; meaning&#44; be particularly watchful over your conduct&#44; 
direct an eagle&#39;s gaze upon all your doings and the conduct of 
those around you &#59; and be as fleet to escape from every vice&#44; as 
the eagle is to escape from the arrow of the bowman&#44; who 
threatens to take his life &#59; and rest not in your upward career.

till you have reached an elevation whence you can look down 
with the utmost safety upon all on earth&#44; which then will 
appear little and unimportant at the immeasurable distance 
beneath you &#59; just as every thing must appear to the eagle&#44; 
when he has winged his proud way far above the clouds of the 
firmament. 

A third class of persons may be denominated the indifferent 
or the careless&#59; they are not actually bad&#8211;hearted or badly 
inclined&#44; but indifferent about the practice of virtue &#59; and when 
they are invited to co&#8211;operate in any act of benevolence&#44; their 
uniform excuse is : &#34;What business is this of mine &#63;&#34; They 
see a poor man begging in the street&#44; they pass by him uncon&#8211; 
cerned&#44; for they argue : &#34; I need not trouble myself about this 
beggar&#44; he is nothing to me.&#34; They are even asked for cha&#8211; 
rity &#59; but their gift is accompanied with some chilling remark 
to the poor mendicant&#44; and they perhaps suffer their callous&#8211; 
ness to overcome their good feelings so far&#44; as to tell a crippled&#44; 
unfortunate old man: &#34;You had better try to obtain some 
work to maiatain yourself&#44; without troubling others about your 
wants.&#34; The house of God is opened&#44; and many flock thither 
to offer up their prayers to their heavenly Protector &#59; but 
the indifferent man cannot think of doing likewise&#44; for as yet 
he is not convinced that this is his business. To all such per&#8211; 
sons the advice is given : &#34; Be as swift as the deer to do the will 
of thy Father in heaven &#33;&#34; just as the panting deer flies to the 
running brook to cool his burning thirst&#59; thus do you also fly 
to the observance of the divine precepts&#44; and endeavour to con&#8211; 
vince yourselves that it is your business&#44; nay the chief business 
of your life&#44; to do whatever religion demands of you. &#34; If you 
see the naked&#44; cover him &#59; and does the hungry meet you&#44; give 
him food &#59;&#34; when you see the house of God open enter there&#44; 
and let your sincere and heartfelt prayer rise up as an accepta&#8211; 
ble offering to your heavenly Father&#44; to whom a contrite heart 
is the most grateful sacrifice. Endeavour to associate your&#8211; 
selves with your brethren in every social and religious act &#59; 
and the pleasure which such conduct will afford you&#44; must 
make virtue in a very short time so indispensable to you&#44; that 
you will pant for an opportunity to show your love to God&#44; 
like the &#34; deer thirsteth for the water of the living fountain.&#34;

There is yet another class of persons&#44; who&#44; with the best 
disposition to practise the good&#44; and who are even not indif&#8211; 
ferent to good actions&#44; are yet too indolent to attempt doing 
what their sense of justice demands&#59; because it would not cost 
them too much labour&#44; or because it might perhaps interfere 
with their personal ease. They are&#44; therefore&#44; continually 
praising the good they see done by others&#44; but are themselves 
always absent&#44; whenever any thing demands their own aid. 
Yet positive sin&#44; as well as negative evil&#44; may be the result of 
this want of activity. For the indolent man may be placed 
in a society&#44; where many are found who habitually deviate 
from the commandments of our holy religion&#59; he sees their 
conduct&#44; and perhaps detests it at first&#59; but he does not 
take the requisite trouble to prevent the evil example having a 
bad effect upon himself. And as it is so very easy to do as 
others do&#44; but so hard to make a stand where one may be left to 
act by himself alone&#44; a man of the kind we are describing&#44; 
may be misled by the example set before him&#44; and induced to 
sin likewise&#44; merely because he cannot rouse himself to an in&#8211; 
creased degree of activity&#44; when this very activity is the only 
means to preserve him in the path of religion. So too&#44; he may 
hear of a distressed family&#44; and even may feel deeply for their 
condition &#59; but he cannot think of going immediately to their 
relief&#44; for&#44; again&#44; it would be too much trouble &#59; &#34; It rains to&#8211; 
day&#44;&#34; will perhaps be his excuse&#44; &#34; to&#8211;morrow&#44; perchance&#44; it 
may be clear&#44; one day can make no difference&#44; and it will then be 
time enough to look after them &#59; I am almost certain their dis&#8211; 
tress has been represented to me in exaggerated colours &#59;&#34; but 
in the mean time the poor may starve from want of food&#44; the 
sick may die from want of proper assistance&#44; and the tardy 
charity come thus too late. &#8212; But if tardiness should even not 
have such terrible consequences&#44; we nevertheless can perceive 
its vexatioics effects in every day&#39;s occurrences&#59; for the hour of 
worship arrives&#44; but the indolent has time enough yet to wait&#44; 
and he appears at the house of prayer&#44; when the service is 
nearly over. At funerals he arrives&#44; when his assistance is no 
longer wanted &#59; and so in fact it happens&#44; that at every religious 
meeting he is entirely useless&#44; because he is always too late&#59; 
and on occasions when activity is required to effect some good 

<pb n="25"/>

purpose&#44; his aid is never desired&#44; for the general good cause 
gains nothing by his accession. &#8212; We are&#44; therefore&#44; admonish&#8211; 
ed : &#34; Be as strong as the lion to do the will of thy Father in 
heaven &#33;&#34; let religion at all times be of sufficient importance to 
you&#44; to induce you to employ all your mental and bodily re&#8211; 
sources in its service. If your assistance be wanted&#44; do not 
wait to be driven or even begged to give it&#44; but offer it cheer&#8211; 
fully and willingly&#44; and reflect that&#44; by the practice of every 
good deed&#44; you are laying up a treasure for yourselves in hea&#8211; 
ven. Nor should you halt in your career to perfection&#44; or feli&#8211; 
citate yourselves at having accomplished enough&#59; but rather 
consider that all&#44; which you can do&#44; must yet leave a great deal 
undone&#44; and despite all your exertions&#44; you will hardly arrive 
at that state of perfection&#44; where you could say&#44; with truth&#44; 
we have finished our task to the entire satisfaction of our Maker. 
The lion&#44; when in pursuit of prey&#44; stops not in the midst of 
his course with his appetite unappeased&#44; nor does he rest satis&#8211; 
fied with the mere view of his victim &#59; but he continues on&#8211; 
ward the chase&#44; and loses not sight of his purpose&#44; till he has 
succeeded&#44; or till prevented by insurmountable difficulties. &#8212; 
Just so should it be with you in the pursuit of virtue&#59; endea&#8211; 
vour to become as good as the best of men&#44; let this be the 
object of your dearest desires&#44; and pursue this high aim of 
virtuous ambition with all the diligence&#44; with all the energy&#44; 
with all the perseverance you are capable of&#59; &#8212; be avaricious in 
hoarding up everlasting treasures&#44; dissipate none of your 
accumulated store of virtues&#44; and guard these priceless trea&#8211; 
sures with as much fierceness as the lion guards his spoil &#59; and 
like this noble animal&#44; regard as your bitterest enemy&#44; the one 
that attempts to rob you of the smallest portion of your holy 
gains. Neither suffer your hold to relax for one moment&#59; for 
once become careless about them&#44; once suffer yourselves to think 
that any thing can be more precious : and it is an easy matter to 
rob you of that which cost so much labour to obtain &#59; as even the 
prowling jackal can take away the lion&#39;s prey&#44; when he carelessly 
leaves the fruit of his arduous labour unguarded&#44; through drow&#8211; 
siness or negligence. &#8212; In short&#44; if you are diligent in the amass&#8211; 
ing of wealth&#59; if you are industrious in finishing a piece of 
handiwork in due season&#59; if you are careful in acquiring fame&#59;

if you are cautious in warding off attacks against your body: be 
doubly diligent in enriching your soul with virtuous deeds &#59; be 
doubly industrious in the fulfilment of your duties &#59; be doubly 
careful in guarding your religious standing&#59; and be most of all 
cautious in warding off all attacks upon your everlasting peace&#44; 
which interest&#44; covetousness&#44; or bad example can make &#59; and 
rest satisfied with the assurance&#44; that this striving will bring its 
own reward&#44; since the ease of mind which the truly pious man 
feels even amidst the most dreadful sufferings&#44; is far more en&#8211; 
viable than the pleasures vvhich the most wealthy can purchase 
with all his wealth in the full tide of his success. &#8212; Perhaps you 
may live in straitened circumstances &#59; perhaps the world may 
not smile upon you &#59; perhaps you may remain unjustly neglect&#8211; 
ed &#59; but despite of all this&#44; there is nothing that can deprive 
you of your spiritual riches&#44; nothing that can extinguish the 
light within you&#44; and no human being&#44; nay&#44; not the whole 
world&#44; can rob you of the blessing of your God&#44; which will&#44; 
and must be yours at last&#44; if you render yourselves worthy of 
it in this life of probation. 

May our actions be always found just before the Lord of the 
universe&#44; and may we all live so&#44; that we can appear before 
his tribunal in spotless innocence&#59; and may this be the cause of 
our enjoying that felicity which He has prepared for those who 
fear Him&#33; Amen.

DISCOURSE IV. 

THE DESTRUCTION OP JERUSALEM. 

Thou&#44; who comfortest the mourners&#44; and assistest them 
that are afflicted&#44; look down&#44; we pray Thee&#44; upon the humble 
remnant of thy people&#44; Israel&#44; who stand this day before thy 
holy shrine and supplicate thy protection. Grant us thy as&#8211; 
sistance&#44; and preserve us as a peculiar people amongst the na&#8211; 
tions of the earth &#59; cause us to live undisturbed by those who 
surround us&#44; so that we may be enabled to live conformably to 
thy will&#44; which Thou hast expressed to us through thy servant 
Moses &#33; Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

As a part of the once great nation&#44; of that people&#44; designated 
as the peculiar treasure of the Most High&#44; we are soon to be 
assembled at the house of God&#44; to mourn for the downfall of 
our national glory. This is the season in which calamity after 
calamity burst over our heads&#44; and this is the time of year in 
which the temple was twice destroyed. Once&#44; we lived hap&#8211; 
pily in the land of Israel&#44; &#8212; once&#44; we had a government insti&#8211; 
tuted and favoured by the God of heaven and earth&#44; &#8212; once&#44; we 
had a temple in which we assembled three times every year&#44; to 
worship our God&#44; as one body&#44; &#8212; once&#44; we had priests to ad&#8211; 
minister the duties of our religion before the altar of the Eter&#8211; 
nal : &#8212; but now &#8212; we are scattered over the whole face of God&#39;s 
earth &#8212; now&#44; we are bound to obey laws which our religion 
does not recognize&#44; &#8212; we are without a temple&#44; and the priest 
of God no longer sacrifices at the altar&#44; and the grateful smoke 
of incense no longer curls upward under the hand of the holy 
minister. All has been lost&#44; the glory of Israel has departed&#44; 
and the descendants of Jacob mourn in a far off land. &#8212; This is 
a brief&#44; but true&#44; sketch of the state of our people&#44; who suffer 
all this&#44; because they disobeyed the will of their God&#44; who had 
proved so often Ws almighty power before them. &#8212; Nothing

therefore&#44; should excite greater and more poignant regret with&#8211; 
in us&#44; than the remembrance of what we were once&#44; and the 
reflection of what we are now. Once the envy of all the sur&#8211; 
rounding nations &#8212; now an abhorrence to all beholders &#59; once 
feared by the most powerful and warlike families of the East &#8212; 
now a weak remnant&#44; left to the mercy of every oppressor &#59; 
once living in a common land&#44; speaking one language&#44; and 
united by one beloved government &#8212; now scattered&#44; speaking 
different tongues&#44; and obeying the will and conforming to the 
caprice of every people of the world. Indeed&#44; has Judah 
fallen&#44; indeed is Israel sorely afflicted&#44; because they incurred 
the wrath of Heaven. Do but compare the animating account 
which sacred history furnishes of the glorious epoch of our 
people in David&#39;s time&#44; when the Syrians&#44; Edumeans&#44; Phoe&#8211; 
nicians&#44; and the children of Lot&#44; besides many other tribes&#44; 
either succumbed to the arms of the anointed of the Lord&#44; or 
propitiated his favour by presents and friendly alliances &#8212; with 
the woful catastrophe of the destruction of the holy city&#44; when 
enemies&#44; even the rudest and most barbarous of all Asiatics&#44; 
traversed the land&#44; burnt the cities&#44; slew the inhabitants&#44; and 
spared neither the aged counsellor&#44; nor the bridegroom leading 
forth his bride&#44; nor the infant in its mother&#39;s arms. All was then 
swallowed up in one indiscriminate destruction&#44; and those whom 
the devouring pestilence had suffered to survive&#44; Avere mowed 
down by the unsheathed sword of the hating adversary. &#8212; All 
this happened&#44; because our ancestors had transgressed the cove&#8211; 
nant of the Lord &#59; because they had refused to listen to the 
warning voice of his prophets&#44; whom He had sent to announce 
the impending calamity&#59; because the priest and prophet had 
been slain&#44; as he lifted up his voice to denounce the backsliding 
of his brethren. It was&#44; therefore&#44; that the threatened ven&#8211; 
geance was meted out&#44; and this was the reason why the children 
of Judah were led forth as captives before the enemy. 

One pre&#8211;eminently distinguished amongst the messengers of 
the Lord&#44; both for the sufferings he had to endure&#44; and for the 
almost unparalleled firmness with which he executed his hea&#8211; 
venly mission&#44; was the prophet Jeremiah&#44; who both foretold 
the destruction of the temple&#44; and witnessed the accomplish&#8211; 
ment of the dire forboding. &#8212; His was a heart alive to all the

finer feelings of human nature&#44; and his mind was filled with 
the sublimest conceptions of religion&#44; and his soul was animated 
by a sincere love towards his countrymen. He had seen the 
greatness of his people&#44; &#8212; he had seen the turrets of Jerusalem 
presenting their bright pinnacles to the rising sun&#44; &#8212; he had 
seen the multitudes of worshippers pouring from every village 
and hamlet of Palestine inio thy gates&#44; Jerusalem &#33; &#8212; he had 
seen the festive throng crowd the avenues of the temple &#59; but 
he also was doomed to behold the reverse of all this&#44; and his 
own eyes beheld the Israelites pursued by their enemies &#8212; the 
walls of Jerusalem crumble amidst the repeated attacks &#8212; the 
gates pulled down &#8212; and the temple in flames &#33; He beheld it 
with inexpressible anguish&#44; and thus he began his complaint &#8212; a 
complaint which must ever be regarded as the most splendid of 
lamentations : 

&#34; Ha &#33; how sits she so solitary&#44; the city that was so populous&#44; she has 
become like a widow &#59; the great among the nations&#44; the princess of pro&#8211; 
vinces&#44; has become tributary.&#34; Lam. i. 1. 

Ifi these words the prophet gives vent to his overcharged 
feelings &#59; he addresses Jerusalem&#44; the city that once had been 
so populous&#44; so great&#44; and so powerful &#59; and contrasting her 
then with her former state&#44; he exclaims : &#34; How sits she so 
solitary&#33;&#34; Jeremiah had seen the youths of Israel go forth to 
battle&#44; had seen the mighty population of Jerusalem hasten out to 
the fight&#44; to strike for God and his holy temple &#59; but he had also 
beheld the flower of his people discomfitted&#44; their valour wasted 
in vain&#44; the remnant of the afflicted led into captivity&#44; the tem&#8211; 
ple of God levelled to the ground&#44; the streets of Jerusalem 
rendered desolate&#44; and the houses left without an inhabitant. &#8212; 
Jeremiah&#44; therefore&#44; continues : &#34; Let her weep at nights&#44; &#8212; let 
her tears be on her cheek&#44; she has no comforter amongst all 
her friends&#44; all her associates have become untrue to her&#44; have 
become her enemies.&#34; The peculiar constitution of our people 
had always exposed us to the jealousy and hatred of some of 
the foreign nations &#59; it was&#44; therefore&#44; natural to expect&#44; that 

<pb n="30"/>

those who had been enemies in former times&#44; would be arrayed 
against us in the time of our affliction &#59; but that our allies&#44; those 
who had always preserved the appearance of friendship&#44; should 
be found untrue when their&#44; assistance was most needed&#44; was 
more than even fear excited to the utmost apprehension could 
have conceived as probable &#59; nevertheless&#44; it so happened&#44; and 
it appeared as though all the nations had colleagued to assist in 
our downfal&#44; and to rejoice over our misfortune. Therefore&#44; 
says the prophet : &#34; Let her weep&#44; she has no comforter 
amongst all her friends &#8212; they have become her enemies &#33;&#34; 
Nation vied with nation to oppress us&#44; and the common consent 
of mankind seemed to have taken from us the rights of huma&#8211; 
nity. Who thought it wrong to maltreat an Israelite&#63; Who 
thought it right to extend to us relief in the hour of our dis&#8211; 
tress&#63; No one &#8212; and every bowman sent his arrows against 
our bared bosom&#44; every swordsman dyed his blade in the blood 
of the devoted race. But not this alone befel us &#59; for the cap&#8211; 
tors mocked our sorrows&#44; they made their voices resound with 
the discordant shouts of triumph in the house of God&#44; and 
they asked of the exiles to sing to them some of the songs of 
Zion. &#8212; But&#44; says the prophet : &#34; Jerusalem has severely sinned&#44; 
therefore has she become an outcast&#59;&#34; it was in judgment for 
the manifold sins of Israel&#44; that all these calamities occurred &#59; 
and&#44; says Jeremiah &#40;including himself among the sinning peo&#8211; 
ple) : &#34; Righteous is the Lord&#44; for I have rebelled against his 
word &#59;&#34; and thus those Israelites&#44; who had neglected to obey 
the precepts of the Mosaic law&#44; who had refused to listen to 
the advice of the prophets&#44; were made to feel at the last&#44; that 
though punishment may be long delayed&#44; it ivill come at length&#44; 
since the One above is all&#8211;knowing&#44; and before Him&#44; there is 
no forgetfulness&#44; although his anger and his vengeance may&#8211; 
long appear to slumber. 

Instructive as doubtless it would be to analyze the remainder 
of the book of Lamentations&#44; I am fearful of approaching the 
task&#44; since the words of the prophet are so lucid and moving&#44; 
and the whole diction so splendid&#44; that their beauty must be 
marred by an attempt to abridge them&#44; and but little can be 
added by way of comment on the text. But there is one 
passage in the third chapter which demands our especial atten&#8211; 

<pb n="31"/>

THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM. 31 

tion &#59; I allude to the expression of confident reliance upon the 
unalterable promise of God&#44; which is in the following words : 
&#34; This will I reflect on in my heart&#44; therefore will I hope. The 
kindness of God will not let us be annihilated&#44; for his mercies 
are without ending&#44;&#39; You will no doubt recollect&#44; that God 
had promised through Jeremiah&#44; that the captivity of the 
Israelites living under the dominion of the king of Judah was 
to endure only for seventy years. He therefore expressed his 
confidence in the certainty of the fulfilment&#44; although at that 
moment there appeared but little likelihood of its accomplish&#8211; 
ment &#59; saying: Let the enemy even prevail&#44; let all the punish&#8211; 
ment denounced be visited on our heads&#44; let our children be 
led captives into the enemy&#39;s land : yet ami confident that the 
nation of the Lord will not cease to be a nation&#44; for his mercies 
are unending &#59; He punishes the sin&#44; but will not utterly destroy 
the sinners&#59; the sons of Abraham have transgressed&#44; but they 
will not be entirely cut off&#34;&#44; because God has promised that his 
descendants should ever be a people&#44; and He would ever be 
their God. &#8212; Jeremiah&#39;s hopes were not unfounded &#59; it is true&#44; 
that he &#8212; the patriot and seer &#8212; descended to the grave in the 
land of Egypt&#44; far from his beloved and lamented Jerusalem &#8212; 
his eyes&#44; therefore&#44; never witnessed this consolation which he 
had announced in the name of God &#59; yet the prophecy itself 
was fulfilled&#44; and when the time predicted had expired&#44; the 
redeemed Jews returned to their land&#44; though in a feeble state 
and few in number. They rebuilt the temple&#44; although the 
one destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar had been much more splen&#8211; 
did&#44; and the worship was restored under Ezra and his associ&#8211; 
ates&#59; and the Jews lived in their inheritance for many years&#44; at 
first under the protection of the powerful kings of Persia and 
the Grecian princes of Egypt and Syria&#44; and afterwards under 
chiefs of their own brethren. But&#44; alas &#33; dissention and internal 
warfare broke out where peace and harmony should have 
reigned&#44; &#8212; brother imbrued his hand in a brother&#39;s blood&#44; and 
the streets of the holy city were dyed with the blood of priests&#44; 
of elders&#44; and of innocent men &#59; and even strangers&#44; the Romans 
namely&#44; were called in to settle the fierce disputes which bro&#8211; 
thers carried on for the supreme authority over a land divided 
into implacable factions. The Israelites were again ripe for a

severe retribution for their sins&#44; and those very Romans&#44; who 
were in the first instance invited to act as umpires&#44; where no 
dispute should have existed&#44; encroached by degrees upon the 
independence of the people &#59; and at length they sent governors 
to rule the country in the name of the Roman emperor. 
Duplicity and falsehood yet continued to reign amongst the 
Jews&#44; and every man sought only his own aggrandizement&#44; 
instead of endeavouring to rid the country of the common 
enemy. And could such a people maintain long the shadow 
of an independence&#44; which the courtesy or the scorn of the 
proud and insidious Romans had left them &#63; Could such a nation 
expect to receive that aid from above&#44; with which their ances&#8211; 
tors had so often overcome nations greater and mightier than 
themselves &#63; Could assassins&#44; I ask&#44; dare to look for such 
assistance &#63; Could those who bought and sold the exalted 
office of high priest&#44; which was to be the inheritance of the 
most worthy of Aaron&#39;s sons&#44; think of being deserving of hea&#8211; 
venly aid to deliver them from their enemies &#63; No&#44; &#8212; for the 
Romans would not suffer them to be even nominally indepen&#8211; 
dent &#59; the decisions of the courts of justice were reviewed by 
the proconsul &#59; and the crimes withal of the Jews had been so 
great&#44; that the wrath of Heaven&#44; and the punishment of their 
sins could no longer be delayed &#59; and thus it was that the blood 
of the innocent&#44; slaughtered to satisfy the revengeful feelings 
of ambitious rivals&#44; was amply revenged. It is needless to 
relate to you in detail the history of the Roman oppressions&#44; 
and the manner in which the war&#44; that ended in our downfal&#44; 
was commenced&#44; and the manner in which it was conducted&#44; 
for ample details of the whole of these events have been left us 
by historians. I only wish to draw your attention to the close 
of the scene&#44; &#8212; to the final siege of Jerusalem&#44; and the destruc&#8211; 
tion of the temple&#44; by Vespasian and Titus. Read&#44; brethren&#44; 
the accounts which are given of the devotion of the Israelites 
in their defence of the house of God. They were&#44; it is true&#44; 
great sinners &#59; the hands of some were stained by murder : yet 
their devoted patriotism in the final struggle&#44; where every man 
became a tower&#44; and every bosom a wall of defence&#44; deserves 
our admiration&#44; and we ought even to cherish the warmest 
feelings&#44; I almost may say&#44; of gratitude&#44; when recalling the 

<pb n="33"/>

THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM. 33 

noble exertions which they made in the holy cause. But alas&#33; 
all was in vain &#59; as already said&#44; the sins of the people had been 
too great&#44; and God could not suffer any longer his people to 
pollute by their presence the land which He had promised them 
on the sole condition&#44; that they should prove obedient to his 
will. Therefore&#44; it came to pass&#44; that the enemy prevailed. 
On the seventeenth day of Thamuz&#44; the Romans penetrated into 
the city &#59; but even then the war raged fiercely&#44; and the lion of 
Judah would not yield to the opposing force&#44; however superior. 
And mothers slaughtered their children to appease their gnaw&#8211; 
ing hunger &#8212; merciful fathers strove to prolong a miserable 
existence by devouring the flesh of their tender offspring &#59; &#8212; 
yet the Jews would not surrender to the merciless foe. The 
clashing of swords daily grew louder in the streets of the 
devoted city &#8212; the tumult of war raged wilder and wilder in 
every avenue: yet the emaciated remnant stood firm&#44; and dis&#8211; 
played a heroism&#44; which we shortsighted mortals might say to 
have deserved a better fate. But He&#44; whose throne is in hea&#8211; 
ven&#44; in his unerring wisdom had decreed it otherwise&#44; and the 
desperate fights in the heart of the city were but like the vio&#8211; 
lent throbs of the heart of the expiring giant&#44; sinking gloriously 
beneath the repeated blows of numberless assailants. &#8212; For&#44; wo 
unto us &#33; it was on the ninth day of Ab&#44; in the year of the 
world 3728&#44; towards sunset&#44; after the battle had raged for days 
around and in the courts of the temple&#44; that a Roman soldier&#44; 
against&#44; it is said&#44; the commands of Titus&#44; who wished to pre&#8211; 
serve the holy building&#44; threw a fire&#8211;brand into the sanctuary. 
Rapidly did the flames spread &#59; and on all sides&#44; towers were 
crushed&#44; and walls crumbled into dust &#59; whilst the bodies of 
the defenders covered the spots where they stood&#44; and the 
corpses of the priests were thrown in heaps around the altar&#44; 
and the floor of the temple was made slippery with the gore of 
the victims&#44; and headless trunks and severed limbs were strewn 
about&#44; and the wild shout of the heartless soldier was heard 
above the noise of the devouring element &#8212; destruction reigned 
all around &#8212; and even the voice of the commander&#44; whom the 
sight of so much misery had excited to compassion&#44; remained 
unheeded&#44; and the brutal tiirong ceased not in their wanton 
efforts&#44; till they were sated with slaughter. God&#44; Lord of all.

that thy justice demanded this sacrifice&#33; that thy children were 
doomed to bleed by thousands&#44; whilst the enemy prevailed&#44; 
and entered thy sanctuary with fire and sword &#33; 

This was the misfortune which befel us on the ninth of Ab &#59; 
it is for this that we fast&#44; and mourn&#44; and sit down in the dust&#44; 
and hang the drapery of the dead over the ark in which the 
law of God is deposited. Where is the Israelite who can come 
into the Synagogue on the fast of the ninth of Ab&#44; without 
being moved by the evil destiny which has overtaken his peo&#8211; 
ple &#63; Where is that renegade member&#44; who mourns not for the 
glory of Israel that has departed &#63; I trust&#44; that there is not one 
among you&#44; my brethren&#44; who is so lost to every emotion of 
patriotism&#44; who values his religion so little&#44; as not to feel sorrow 
on the anniversary of the destruction of our national govern&#8211; 
ment. But let those who feel in their hearts that they are 
Israelites indeed&#44; assemble on the mournful day&#44; with a contrite 
heart and devotional feelings&#44; and pray to God for the welfare 
of the remnant of the flock that is yet spared&#44; and entreat him 
that the sword may not be again unsheathed against us. For 
since the times of Titus&#44; in every age&#44; we were exposed to per&#8211; 
secutions for the sake of our faith : we were summoned to for&#8211; 
swear our belief in One Almighty God&#44; and almost every nation 
has been by turns one of those who endeavoured to make us 
feel the more strongly the weight of our chains. But thanks 
to our Protector&#44; and God&#44; and Saviour from destruction &#33; 
all their counsel was rendered as nought. They strove hard to 
accomplish their ends&#44; &#8212; they murdered multitudes of innocents&#59; 
but all in vain&#44; for we are yet&#44; even unto this day&#44; a people&#44; 
one and peculiar&#44; a monument of the greatness of God&#44; and an 
imperishable sign of his providence and wisdom. We are&#44; it is 
true&#44; dispersed over every land&#44; in almost every island&#59; but 
still we are united &#8212; the bond of one law&#44; and the belief in one 
God&#44; keep us as one&#44; though scattered in every corner. It is in 
this manner that the God of our fathers has fulfilled the cove&#8211; 
nant which He made with us &#59; and thus He has proved that his 
mercies are unending&#44; even to the sinful and the lowly ones. 
He has also promised that when we are repentant&#44; and return to 
Him in sincerity&#44; that He would restore our captives&#44; and bring 
us back to our land &#59; and that during our sojourn in the coun&#8211;

tries of our enemies&#44; He would never forsake us&#44; and hear our 
prayer whenever we should call on Him in our affliction. O 
may you then always act so as to deserve the continuance of 
his protection &#59; and may your conduct be such&#44; that He maj 
restore his kingdom to us &#59; and that every beholder may 
exclaim : &#34; Truly&#44; these are the people of God&#44; and these are 
the servants whom He has chosen &#33;&#34; 

May the Lord of heaven have mercy on us all&#44; and gather 
our captives unto the land which He has promised to our ances&#8211; 
tors&#44; and cause us again to hear before all nations&#44; &#40;as He has 
promised) : &#34; Behold I have redeemed you&#44; last as first&#44; to be 
your God &#59; I am the Lord your God.&#34; May this be his will&#44; 
and may the redeemer speedily come to Zion. Amen.

THE CONSOLATION OF ISRAEL. 

Hear us&#44; Father&#44; hear us &#33; for Thou art He&#44; who heark&#8211; 
enest unto the supplication of all thy creatures &#59; to Thee all 
flesh does fly for protection&#44; and Thou grantest the prayer of 
all&#44; even of the most lowly. Give us then&#44; Lord&#44; thy con&#8211; 
solation&#44; and relieve us from all affliction. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 
In every age&#44; in every year&#44; nay&#44; every day&#44; and every hour&#44; 
we see the wondrous power of God&#44; manifested in a thousand 
different ways. Miracles are daily performed before our eyes&#44; 
we see prodigies existing around us&#44; but we pass them by with&#8211; 
out heeding them &#59; for they are too familiar to us&#44; we are too 
well acquainted with them&#44; and they cease to interest us. You

see daily the tide ebb and flow&#44; the fact is evident to you &#59; but 
this receding and advancing of the waters&#44; does not strike you 
as miraculous&#44; unless you set out resolved to think on and 
ponder over the greatness of the work of God. But not so 
the inhabitant of the shores of the Mediterraciean Sea &#59; he has 
a vast sheet of water before his eyes&#44; but it neither rises nor 
falls like the other seas&#59; and the first time&#44; therefore&#44; he views 
this wonderful phenomenon at a distance from his home&#44; he must 
stand astonished and awe&#8211;struck at the great wonder. &#8212; To the 
inhabitant of an alpine region the stupendous granite walls&#44; 
which on all sides surround him&#44; are an every&#8211;day&#39;s sight&#44; and 
he loses all knowledge of their wonderful majesty by roving 
among them at pleasure. But place the lowlander amidst these 
grand structures of God&#39;s potent creative word&#44; and an expres&#8211; 
sion of delightful surprise will unconsciously escape him&#44; when 
he exclaims in the ecstacy of the moment : &#34; How great are 
thy works&#44; God &#33;&#34; &#8212; The same also is the case with the or&#8211; 
dinary occurrences of life. Any one&#44; who should express his 
surprise at hearing the roar of the thunder&#44; or at beholding the 
bright flash of the lightning&#44; would perhaps be ridiculed for 
his childishness and simplicity&#44; and we might perchance won&#8211; 
der&#44; how things so common should retain sufficient interest to 
excite surprise and delight. &#8212; But if we come to reflect in sober 
earnestness upon all the wonders of creation&#44; &#8212; if we view the 
regularity with which the tides rise and fall&#44; &#8212; if we take a 
glance at the snow&#8211;capt mountains&#44; from which issue innumer&#8211; 
able streams that render the earth fruitful and habitable&#44; &#8212; if we 
listen with awful silence&#44; as becomes mortals when the Supreme 
sends forth his voice&#44; to the loud roar of the desolating tempest: 
we must be filled with admiration at the goodness and potency 
of the great Creator&#44; who has so wisely ordained all to work 
for a benficent end&#44; in harmony and concert. And if we next 
come to contemplate&#44; if even for a moment&#44; on our own unwor&#8211; 
thiness&#44; and consider how often we have by our misconduct 
incensed the Holy Spirit : we must be struck dumb with awe 
and reverence&#44; for the forbearance we have experienced from 
that Almighty Being&#44; who though so powerful beyond expres&#8211; 
sion&#44; is yet so indulgent to the sinful worms&#44; that crawl as it 
were&#44; in the dust before him. Some one perhaps there is&#44; who

doubts the watchfulness of Providence over all the doings of 
the children of man &#59; but do we not daily see that justice is 
done in the world &#63; that hidden crimes are brought to light&#63; 
that innocence is protected against the spiteful malice of power&#8211; 
ful vice&#63; It is true&#44; that we lose sight of the miraculous part 
of the occurrence &#59; we ascribe the result to a chain of circum&#8211; 
stances&#44; to the sagacity of the officers of justice&#44; to whom the 
laws of the land have transferred the investigation and punish&#8211; 
ment of crimes against the peace of society &#59; but tell me not
that all is owing to blind chance&#44; to unalterable fate&#44; to irrevo&#8211; 
cable laws of nature &#8212; speak not to me of the vigilance and 
circumspection of mere men &#59; for all and every one of these&#44; 
singly or combined&#44; are insufficient to produce even a portion 
of the like results. &#8212; For say&#44; what power has blind chance to 
reveal forgotten secrets&#63; &#8212; what does fate know of the hidden 
misdeeds of the midnight robber &#63; &#8212; what can human sagacity 
avail&#44; when the subject to which observation should be directed 
is totally concealed from its knowledge&#63; Do we not rather 
discern here the rays of the providential light&#44; which illumine 
even darkness itself&#63; 

But this is not precisely the subject to which I would draw 
your attention this day&#44; brethren&#44; and I only introduced it to 
show how much matter of astonishment&#44; and how many mo&#8211; 
tives for adoration can be discovered all around us. At present&#44; 
however&#44; I wish to draw your especial attention to yourselves&#44; 
to your existence as a people&#59; for it may freely be said&#44; that you 
are a standing miracle&#44; one in whom the finger of God is pre&#8211; 
eminently displayed. 

A time there was&#44; we assert&#44; when God bestowed upon the 
blessed patriarch Jacob&#44; the name of Israel&#44; as an especial gift&#44; 
to denote&#44; that the lowly righteous&#44; even in affliction&#44; was a 
favourite of his Maker&#59; &#8212; we maintain that the Most High 
made known his laws and his statutes to Jacob&#39;s descendants&#44; 
that they might love and fear Him all the days &#59; and we believe&#44; 
that God has promised again and again&#44; through his servants&#44; 
the prophets&#44; that this people so descended and so blessed&#44; 
should always be preserved through every danger and through 
every difficulty. &#8212; And&#44; brethren&#44; years and ages have rolled 
on&#44; and this people is still in being &#59; three thousand years have

elapsed&#44; and the promise has not been forgotten &#59; for we our&#8211; 
selves are the fruit of this glorious name&#44; the inheritors of this 
holy law&#44; and the objects of this cheering promise&#44; &#8212; we are in 
short&#44; a portion of the house of Israel. &#8212; It is we&#44; who are the 
witnesses of God&#39;s miraculous providence on earth&#44; a living 
testimonial of the truth of Revelation. For in vain do unbe&#8211; 
lievers endeavour to account for our continued existence in a 
natural way&#59; in vain do they aver&#44; that we have existed a long 
while&#44; and that we&#44; like other nations&#44; sprung up under the 
guidance of a leader and legislator. But can it be asserted with 
seriousness&#44; that this does reasonably account for our being as 
we are even unto this day&#63; Say&#44; where are the children of 
Solon &#63; where the tribes of Numa&#44; scattered&#44; indeed&#44; yet united &#63; 
Say&#44; where do we find a people&#44; which has remained entire 
and undivided for centuries&#44; through ages of sin z.n A persecu&#8211; 
tion&#63; It is&#44; indeed&#44; but shutting the eye against conviction&#44; 
and excluding the light which truth displays&#44; to maintain&#44; that 
because we are daily seen&#44; that because we are no better than 
other divisions of mankind&#44; there is nothing wonderful in our 
escape from destruction&#59; for&#44; notwithstanding the taunts of 
unbelievers&#44; there is nothing that can shake the truth of our 
claims to a miraculous preservation &#59; for nothing in nature &#8212; 
though nature itself is so wonderful an emanation from the 
Deity&#44; &#8212; could have built up a people so hardy in tiieir belief&#44;

ever be injured by any thing that man can do&#33; Have not 
tyrants oppressed us in vain times without number&#63; Have not 
priests forced their doctrines upon us with the faggot&#44; the sword&#44; 
the gibbet&#44; and the rack&#63; Have not unbelievers tried their 
utmost to ridicule us out of our belief&#63; And yet we are here&#44; 
that monument of the wisdom of God&#44; which we were destin&#8211; 
ed to be. &#8212; In the same spirit did our great teacher&#44; Moses&#44; 
speak&#44; when his life was drawing to a close&#44; and when he was 
permitted for the last time to address his beloved people&#44; and 
to admonish them to practise those laws which he had been 
sent to teach unto them. These are his words &#40;Deut. iv. 6&#8211;8&#44;): 

&#34; And observe to do them&#44; for tliis law is your wisdom and your intelli&#8211; 
gence before the eyes of the nations&#44; who may hear of all these statutes&#44; 
and they will say&#44; this great nation cannot be otherwise than a wise and 
intelligent people. For where is that nation&#44; be it ever so great&#44; to whom 
God is so near&#44; as our God&#44; whenever we call on Him&#63; And where is that 
nation&#44; be it ever so great&#44; that has such just statutes and codes&#44; as all this 
law&#44; which I lay before you this day.&#34; 

Let us understand the meaning of this assertion of Moses &#59; 
he did not intend to express&#44; that every human being would 
show his admiration of the beautiful code which we possess by 
a strict obedience to its precepts &#59; but that every member of the 
human family would&#44; when made acquainted with its behests&#44; 
acknowledge&#44; in words at least&#44; that the laws of the Israelites 
contained wise and just statutes. We need&#44; therefore&#44; not fear 
that any reasonable argument can be drawn against our religion 
from the fact&#44; that but a small portion of mankind acknowledge 
this religion&#44; nor from the often repeated apostacies of the 
Jews themselves &#59; for the legislator did nowhere say&#44; that he 
came to legislate for any other people&#44; save the Israelites&#44; and 

<pb n="40"/>

those who might voluntarily join them &#59; and of the apostacy of 
the Jews&#44; and of their frequent rebellions&#44; he has left us the 
testimony of his own words recorded in the Pentateuch&#44; by the 
express command of God. &#8212; It is not&#44; therefore&#44; from the great 
number of Israelites&#44; nor from their pre&#8211;eminent piety&#44; that 
we so confidently claim a divine origin for our religion &#59; it is 
solely its beauty&#44; the extraordinary theory of government 
which it discloses&#44; and the elevated knowledge of the divine 
attributes which it imparts&#44; that compel us&#44; even against our 
will&#44; to confess that no human mind was ever capable of reach&#8211; 
ing a state of such perfection as to enable it to produce a struc&#8211; 
ture so noble&#44; and so well fitted in all its parts&#44; and so well 
adapted to accomplish the objects for which it was intended. 
It therefore came to pass&#44; that in every age&#44; the eyes of all the 
world were turned upon our code and upon us&#44; to whom it was 
entrusted. Unimportant as some of us&#44; perhaps&#44; may regard 
this heavenly gift&#44; it is nevertheless that&#44; from which the world 
has derived the greatest benefits. For look around you with 
the of inquiry&#44; and you will be struck with the conviction&#44; 
that wherever the Bible is carried civilization must follow in 
its track. It dispels&#44; as it were&#44; the darkness of superstition &#59; 
the shackles of tyranny are by it rent asunder&#59; and man is by 
it taught to raise his eyes to One God&#44; and to know himself as 
a being destined by this Omnipotent Power&#44; his Creator&#44; for a 
state of uninterrupted happiness. Am I overrating the force 
which the word of God exercises over the hearts of men &#63; I 
imagine not&#59; and whatever the subtle sophist may advance to 
the contrary notwithstanding&#44; it is undoubted&#44; that the world 
has been taught true wisdom only by the emanation of the 
Supreme Wisdom. Moses therefore says to the Israelites : 
&#34; And observe and do them &#59; for this law is your wisdom and 
your intelligence in the eyes of the nations :&#34; and he here 
exhorts them to act according to the law&#44; as laid down by him &#59; 
for only in this case would they be considered wise by the gen&#8211; 
tile people. Here too&#44; we have a striking proof of the divine 
mission of Moses &#59; for does not our daily experience demon&#8211; 
strate&#44; that no Jew ever can gain the esteem of strangers by 
transgressing the law &#63; Or does not rather a strict observance 
of its precepts ensure us always the respect&#44; if not the love&#44; of 

<pb n="41"/>

THE CONSOLATION OF ISRAEL. 41 

Others&#63; But as it is not interested motives&#44; be they what they 
may&#44; which should be the only ones to sway us in matters of 
religion&#44; since we are bound to be pious from love to God&#44; and 
from a sincere reverence of his almighty power&#44; and from grati&#8211; 
tude for the innumerable benefits which we hourly receive 
from his bounty : we find that Moses rests not his appeal to 
Israelites upon the advantage which the possession of the law 
confers&#44; alone&#44; but also upon its containing laws so perfectly 
just in all their bearing&#44; that their truth must be apparent to 
every person of intelligence. In addition to this&#44; he inculcates 
in almost every chapter of the admonitory portion of the Pen&#8211; 
tateuch&#44; that a filial confidence and a filial obedience are 
demanded of us as the perfection of piety &#59; as we also read : 
&#34;And know in thy heart&#44; that as the father chastiscth his son&#44; 
so the Lord thy God chastiscth thee.&#34; If we do possess these 
noble feelings in their full extent&#44; we may confidently expect 
that the Lord will be nigh unto us&#44; whenever we call upon 
Him&#44; and that He will extend to us assistance in our afflictions&#44; 
and send comfort to our souls even amidst the gloom of despair&#44; 
when the ills of life seem to be approaching to overwhelm us 
by their weight. But we are not to imagine that the Ever&#8211; 
blessed has need for our service&#44; or that He can be benefitted by 
aught we can do &#59; &#8212; far be such presumptuous thoughts from 
our minds: on the contrary&#44; all the benefit of virtue is ours&#44; all 
the injury from sin must recoil upon our own heads. Moses&#44; 
therefore&#44; admonishes the Israelites&#44; that they ought to be very 
careful in the observance of the duties which God demanded of 
them&#44; for that punishment would be as necessary a consequence 
of sin&#44; as reward is that of leading a religious life. The legis&#8211; 
lator further adduces the most cogent reason to the Israelites&#44; 
why they in particular should be careful in following his 
advice : since they were the people who had seen God&#39;s power 
so manifestly exhibited&#44; and had been in particular blessed 
with the gift of the divine law&#59; and so they had peculiar 
obligations to fulfil&#44; that is&#44; to obey the precepts they had 
received and accepted as the law of the Creator of all. 

The nature of the Mosaic law furnishes us&#44; thus&#44; with a num&#8211; 
ber of sound reasons to prove its truth. But besides this inter&#8211; 
nal evidence&#44; there are many other arguments which present

themselves readily&#44; even to a casual observer : for no matter 
how slightly a man may have suffered himself to investigate 
the nature of his religion&#44; and the events connected therewith&#44; 
he must have his attention unavoidably arrested by the remark&#8211; 
able fulfilment of prophetic predictions announced from time to 
time to our nation. One of the most memorable of these is 
contained in the portion of the Law&#44; which we have read this 
day. Moses foretold that the Israelites were soon to cross the 
Jordan to inherit the land&#44; which should be given unto them in 
consequence of the covenant which the Lord had made with 
Abraham&#44; Isaac&#44; and Jacob &#59; that&#44; if obedient&#44; they should live 
happily and securely&#44; and there should be no one to make 
them afraid &#59; but that in case of disobedience to the divine man&#8211; 
dates&#44; they should be speedily driven from this land and scat&#8211; 
tered amongst all the nations. &#8212; Just so it happened. The land 
was conquered after the death of Moses by Joshua&#44; his chosen 
successor&#44; who led the Israelites to the occupancy of their 
inheritance. But when Joshua and the elders of his days had 
died&#44; the people chosen by God soon forgot the debt they 
owed to Him&#44; and they transgressed the commandments they 
should have observed&#44; and ever and anon&#44; they were delivered 
into the hands of surrounding nations&#44; and they were only 
liberated from the yoke of their oppressors&#44; when they turned 
again unto their God with prayer and penitence&#59; and He then 
raised up unto them judges&#44; who freed them from the pressure 
of foreign bondage. At length&#44; under the kings&#44; they had 
altogether forsaken the Lord&#44; and the whole punishment 
denounced was therefore inflicted &#59; first&#44; the ten tribes com&#8211; 
posing the kingdom of Israel were expelled &#59; and lastly&#44; the 
tribes of Judah and Benjamin&#44; together with the family of Levi&#44; 
were forced out of their country&#44; and Palestine was left without 
an inhabitant. But says Moses : &#34; And you will seek thence 
the Lord thy God&#44; and thou shalt find Him&#44; when thou seekest 
Him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.&#34; &#8212; &#34; For the 
Lord thy God is a merciful God&#44; He will not forsake thee nor 
annihilate thee&#44; nor will He forget the covenant with thy 
fathers which He has sworn unto them.&#34; &#8212; And truly has this 
been fulfilled &#59; when we transgressed we were not spared&#44; and 
God pulled down the strongholds of Judah : He poured out his 

<pb n="43"/>

THE CONSOLATION OF ISRAEL. 43 

anger over wood and stone &#59; the house of glory was razed to the 
ground&#44; and the children of the covenant were scattered&#44; and 
were dispersed in small numbers over all the earth. Many of 
our people&#44; too&#44; have been lost among the gentiles &#59; there are 
those of us who worship gods of silver and gods of gold &#59; and 
they bow down to deities which have no existence&#44; save in 
the overheated and misguided fancy of deluded men. Despite&#44; 
however&#44; of all these calamities&#44; we never have been totally 
without assistance&#59; full often it appeared as though the sun of 
Judah would set for ever&#59; as though the light of Israel were 
about to expire&#44; never more to regain its lustre : and then&#44; when 
despair had almost seized on the most confiding&#44; a reassurance 
of the certainty of help infused courage into the heart of the 
most desponding&#44; and it was thus proved that God will assist 
and console us&#44; when we address our prayers to Him : and that 
He will never suffer us to sink under the burden of our misfor&#8211; 
tunes&#44; though our deeds may not be always such&#44; as to entitle 
us to this signal goodness. Indeed it was the divine interfer&#8211; 
ence that was so often manifested to effect our deliverance&#44; for 
no other cause could have produced a result so unexpected&#44; and 
preserved our people amidst so many difficulties. Are you now 
aware&#44; brethren&#44; how great this miracle is &#63; It is true&#44; that it 
is not of that nature as to strike your outward eye with amaze&#8211; 
ment &#59; it is not like an unexpected and sudden change of out&#8211; 
ward nature&#44; which produces terror and astonishment in the 
beholder&#59; but it is of that species which&#44; like the laws of 
nature&#44; works uniformly&#44; though silently&#44; and is to the think&#8211; 
ing mind a no less convincing proof of the divine power&#44; than 
a great miracle visible to the eye wrought before the face of 
day in the presence of an assembled world. 

Since now we see that so many of the predictions have been 
fulfilled&#44; since it is evident that all the punishment has been 
sent&#44; since all the afflictions have overtaken us : may we not 
reasonably hope&#44; that the good also will not be withheld&#44; when&#8211; 
ever we have returned unto our God with all our heart and 
with all our soul &#63; Most assuredly &#59; especially as we see the 
good already partially accomplislied&#44; as has been said&#44; in the 
preservation of the Israelitish people. If even the promised 
blessings be still delayed&#44; if even our eyes be closing before we

44 THE CONSOLATION OF ISRAEL. 

have witnessed the consolation of Zion&#44; we should not despair 
of the happy change &#59; for we should reflect&#44; that the great God&#44; 
who chose us when we were few&#44; scattered us when sinning in 
prosperity&#44; and preserved us in captivity&#44; has also promised 
that He would ultimately do the good thing for his servants&#44; 
and that his power can accomplish our restoration to our former 
glory. 

And thus all the prophets&#44; the messengers of Heaven&#44; speak 
of that auspicious period&#44; when universal peace shall prevail&#44; 
and Israel be again in the land of Palestine&#44; and the worship of 
the true God be spread over all the earth. This we call the 
consolation of Jerusalem&#44; typical of Israel&#44; of which Isaiah 
&#40;chap&#44; xl.) speaks as follows : &#34; Comfort ye&#44; comfort ye&#44; my 
people&#44; says your God. Speak comfort unto the heart of Jeru&#8211; 
salem&#44; and call out unto her&#44; that her appointed time is over&#44; 
that her sin is forgiven&#44; for she has received from the hand of 
the Lord twofold for all her sins. A voice cries out in the 
wilderness : Clear ye the way of the Lord&#44; make even the 
highway in the desert for our God. Every valley shall be 
raised&#44; and every mount and hill shall be levelled&#44; and the 
crooked places shall be made even&#44; and the precipices shall be 
made deep grounds. And the glory of the Lord shall be re&#8211; 
vealed&#44; and all flesh together shall see that the mouth of the 
Lord has spoken it.&#34; The prophet expresses here in figurative 
language the great restoration of the Israelites&#44; when comfort 
shall be spoken to them that mourned for the affliction of Jeru&#8211; 
salem &#59; this will be when the appointed time for the redemption 
has come&#44; when our sins have all been atoned for&#44; when all the 
punishment incurred has been meted out. Then&#44; however&#44; all 
difficulties will at once be seen to vanish&#44; and as it were a 
highway will be made in the wilderness for the passage of the 
redeemed&#44; and that which now appears as almost impossible&#44; 
the reunion namely of the scattered flock&#44; will be simultaneously 
accomplished&#44; and we shall again be permitted to approach the 
confines of the land&#44; which once was ours&#44; as if mountains had 
been levelled and valleys had been raised. At this time too&#44; 
all mankind will see the glory of God revealed&#44; all will be 
made conscious of the errors of their ways&#44; all will acknow&#8211; 
ledge the true religion of the Lord&#44; all will respect that people 

<pb n="45"/>

which remained so true to the word of God&#44; and all will then 
confess&#44; that it was none but God who .spoke all these messages 
of consolation through the mouths of his prophets &#33; 

May we all live to behold the consolation of Israel&#44; the re&#8211; 
building of Jerusalem&#44; and the restoration of the worship to the 
temple&#44; and may we be held sufficiently deserving before our 
heavenly Father&#44; to receive the crown of glory instead of ashes&#44; 
and to participate of the joy of those who sincerely mourn for 
Zion&#44; and ardently look forward to the time&#44; when the Lord&#44; 
whom we seek&#44; will suddenly come to his sanctuary. Amen.

Thou who givest understanding to man&#44; and impartest 
unto mortals wisdom and knowledge&#44; enlighten our souls&#44; and 
purify our hearts &#59; so that we may be permitted fully to com&#8211;

Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 
If we come to inquire in what the superiority of man over 
the brute creation really consists&#44; we will find it to be his 
power of investigating things presented to his consideration&#44; 
and of adopting from a free and unrestricted choice that which 
he may deem to be the most conducive to his happiness. No 
other animal possesses this capacity &#59; it will eat&#44; only because 

<pb n="46"/>

its natural impulse teaches it that food is necessary for its pre&#8211; 
servation &#59; it will take this food wherever it can find it ready 
for its use&#44; but it never thinks of tilling the ground to obtain 
the necessaries of life by means of art and labour. But man&#44; in 
feeling that he is obliged to eat in order to prolong life&#44; also dis&#8211; 
covers that raw food does not suit his taste&#44; and that wild herbs 
are not palatable enough to gratify his appetite &#59; he therefore 
subjects to the action of heat&#44; whatever he thinks can be im&#8211; 
proved in taste thereby&#44; and by cultivating the soil he endeavours 
to obtain better articles of sustenance&#44; and many more luxuries&#44; 
than the earth would spontaneously yield. In this way then 
man has a superiority over the beasts in a physical view&#44; since 
he can procure by art those comforts&#44; which these cannot. Yet 
what is all physical superiority compared with the expansive 
powers of the human intellect&#63; Is there any animal that can 
communicate its ideas by articulate sounds&#63; Man alone pos&#8211; 
sesses this power &#59; nay&#44; more&#44; he can&#44; if he will&#44; communicate 
his ideas to those far removed from him&#44; yea&#44; even to those&#44; 
who may be born centuries after his death. &#8212; The animal when 
born has all its faculties at once developed&#44; or at best&#44; its edu&#8211; 
cation&#44; if so it may be called&#44; is soon completed&#44; for to all 
appearance&#44; but few additional ideas can be acquired by the 
most sagacious beast. &#8212; But man is always advancing&#44; from the 
hour of his birth to that of his dissolution &#59; new light is con&#8211; 
stantly dawning upon his soul&#44; and his understanding hourly 
acquires new stores of knowledge. &#8212; Can we now for a moment 
believe&#44; that this signal superiority was conferred on man solely 
for the gratification of his earthly desires&#63; can we suppose that 
the Creator would render his mind so perfect&#44; his soul so intel&#8211; 
ligent&#44; that he might be a better fed and more comfortable beast 
than a quadruped is&#63; No&#44; no&#44; reason was not given to man&#44; 
for the sole purpose of enabling him to accumulate luxuries and 
to multiply the means of his pleasures &#8212; and wisdom was not 
implanted in him&#44; merely to fit him to ward off personal incon&#8211; 
veniencies. But he was endowed with reason&#44; that he might 
be enabled to think with humility and knowledge over the 
works of the great Creator&#44; and wisdom was given him&#44; that 
he might learn and understand the precepts of his God&#44; and that 
understanding&#44; he should endeavour to obey them&#44; thus to

reach&#44; through obedience&#44; the highest degree of unbounded 
felicity. 

That to think &#40;in opposition to blind belief and dull acqui&#8211; 
escence in received dogmas) is the duty of every truly religious 
man&#44; that we are bound to reflect frequently upon the works 
and the precepts of God&#44; can be proved from many passages of 
the Pentateuch &#59; as Moses very often says : &#34; And know in thy 
heart&#44;&#34; which phrase evidently inculcates deep and serious re&#8211; 
flection. Other sacred writers have given us in their sublime 
works&#44; many splendid specimens of their deep thoughts&#59; and 
so David in the eighth Psalm : &#34; When I view thy heavens&#44; 
the works of thy fingers&#44; the moon and the stars which Thou 
hast founded &#8212; what is man that Thou shouldst think of him&#44; 
and the child of earth that Thou shouldst regard him&#63;&#34; We 
thus see&#44; that thought and reflection&#44; deep and serious&#39;&#44; are a 
duty which we&#44; as rational beings destined for ulterior happi&#8211; 
ness&#44; owe to our heavenly Father. Besides this&#44; brethren&#44; 
religion&#44; such a religion at least as we possess&#44; may be investi&#8211; 
gated&#44; may be sifted&#44; and exposed&#44; and the freest inquiry even 
cannot injure it&#59; for the more we enter into its sublimities&#44; the 
more shall we be inclined to exclaim with the Psalmist: &#34; Open 
Thou my eyes&#44; that I may see the wonders of thy law&#33;&#34; &#8212; But 
to arrive at this blessed state of mind&#44; in which David spoke&#44; 
I mean&#44; in order to arrive at a conviction of the sacredness and 
truth of religion&#44; two things are necessary&#59; first&#44; we should 
start from the proper point&#59; secondly&#44; we must be cautious&#44; that 
we enter not into what must&#44; from the very constitution of 
man&#44; be always hidden from him and unapproachable to his 
limited intellect. The evil efi&#39;ects arising from the neglect of 
this precaution are every day visible&#44; and unfortunately too 
familiar&#59; and we have often seen how a correct and humble rea&#8211; 
soning is productive of religious conviction&#44; and how many are 
led to become infidels&#44; because they approach the sacred thresh&#8211; 
hold of truth with presumption&#44; and an overweaning confidence 
in their own judgment. And yet infidelity always assumes 
and arrogates to itself&#44; a claim to profound investigation&#59; it 
aifects to believe&#44; that the religious and pious never think &#59; it 
says&#44; religion must be fostered by ignorance: and that the light 
of reason will overthrow the dominion of faith. But can infidels 

<pb n="48"/>

establish their sole claim to profound reasoning&#63; Is there so 
much wisdom in unbelief&#63; Is there so much intellect in refus&#8211; 
ing to be guided by the law of God &#63; We may safely and 
emphatically answer&#44; no &#59; for if worldly thinking&#44; which 
reaches no farther than the animal frame&#44; can be wisdom&#44; how 
much higher must that thought stand&#44; which looks to perpe&#8211; 
tuate in bliss the immortal spark&#44; the undying soul of man. 

Let us investigate this matter a little more closely&#44; and in&#8211; 
dulge me awhile&#44; brethren&#44; whilst I detain you upon this sub&#8211; 
ject&#44; a subject which demands of all the most serious reflection. 
For in truth&#44; there are those who say&#44; that religion and reason 
are at variance &#59; there are those&#44; who endeavour to withdraw 
from man his only support in the hour of affliction&#44; the con&#8211; 
sciousness of the protection of God&#44; and a conviction of the 
infallibility and justice of the Almighty Judge &#59; there are those 
who ridicule others for practising the duties which religion 
demands. &#8212; And yet these are the men who style themselves 
rationalists &#33; vain boasters &#33; for they are groping in the dark &#8212; 
they have wilfully extinguished the only light which could 
have shown them the way to true wisdom. 

The cause of infidelity may be stated to be twofold &#59; first&#44; 
pride &#59; secondly&#44; fear. The vain egotist hears himself praised 
for his learning&#44; he discovers that the world eagerly listens to 
whatever he puts forth&#44; to derive pleasure and knowledge from 
his instruction. He becomes inflated with pride&#44; and when he 
sees the regularity which pervades civilized life&#44; when he dis&#8211; 
covers the profound veneration which the world feels for the 
source of all this good&#44; the revelation of God : he affects to be 
surprised&#44; and pretends that he could have made as good a 
code as that which is prized as the gift of Heaven&#44; &#8212; nay&#44; he 
even alleges that its standard of morality is not of a degree 
elevated enough to be satisfactory to the human intellect. &#8212; He 
is wise and great&#44; this he has been often told&#44; and he therefore 
thinks that the wisdom of God was not necessary to give a law 
to mankind &#59; and as he once thinks it unnecessary&#44; he next avers 
that it is impossible that God should audibly speak to man &#59; 
and since he deems it impossible&#44; the next assertion is&#44; that it 
never took place&#44; or in other words&#44; that the revelation alleged 
to come from God is a sheer fabrication. Such a man&#44; who 

<pb n="49"/>

PERFECTION WITH GOD. 49 

prides himself upon his wisdom&#44; though an infidel in his pro&#8211; 
fessions&#44; may yet live in strict conformity to those rules of 
morality which the Bible contains&#59; he may even be stricter&#44; than 
those who profess to believe in a divine origin of the law. 
But it can scarcely be principle&#44; but more properly&#44; pride&#44; 
which preserves such a man from vice. He knows&#44; that his 
standing in society is of that kind&#44; that the eyes of many are 
turned towards him &#59; he at least fancies himself an object of 
observation&#44; having&#44; according to the love which many feel 
for mere notoriety&#44; done so much to obtain the public regard &#59; 
he believes many are watching his movements to discover his 
faults&#44; for the purpose of throwing discredit upon his mode of 
thinking&#44; by placing his iniquity before the world&#44; to forewarn 
others against following his example &#59; he&#44; therefore&#44; endeavours&#44; 
that his conduct shall throw no discredit upon his doctrines. &#8212; 
Nay&#44; suppose him meek and unostentatious&#44; intent only on 
doing good&#44; which&#44; however&#44; is hardly possible &#59; there is still 
no reason to imagine that religion is the less necessary to the 
rest of the world&#44; although this one may be ostensibly virtuous 
whilst despising its tenets. For&#44; observe brethren&#44; this meek 
unostentatious philosopher was not born in a far&#8211;off land&#44; 
where the tread of civilization had never before been heard&#44; 
but in a well&#8211;regulated community&#59; and he was reared&#44; where 
the Bible is both known and venerated &#59; he grew up amidst 
men professing religion&#44; and he accordingly imbibed imper&#8211; 
ceptibly&#44; those very principles which he affects to hold in so 
light an esteem &#59; now he has reached manhood&#39;s years&#44; and he 
continues to act as he has been accustomed to do &#59; and no matter 
whether he says&#44; he believes or not believes&#44; it is nevertheless 
true&#44; that the divine revelation&#44; although not acknowledged&#44; is 
his moral guide. Superficial reasoners&#44; when seeing a virtuous 
unbeliever&#44; or rather when seeing one affecting unbelief prac&#8211; 
tising morality and maintaining an upright and honest charac&#8211; 
ter&#44; may perhaps say&#44; that a man may be truly good&#44; and yet 
not believe one word of revelation &#59; and in consequence&#44; that 
revelation is not necessary to form a virtuous life&#44; or is even 
altogether false. But they ought to bear in mind&#44; that a man 
may imbibe principles&#44; either virtuous or criminal&#44; in a thou&#8211; 
sand ways&#44; other than his own reasoning&#44; without being con&#8211;

scious of the manner iu which he acquired the same&#44; or even 
without feeling at the time the new bias which his mind lias 
received &#59; secondly&#44; that a man may profess to disbelieve re&#8211; 
velation&#44; merely to gain the name of a philosopher&#44; a wise head&#44; 
or a deep thinker &#59; and that lastly&#44; mere believing one thing 
or the other is not the sole cause of our being good or bad&#44; for 
without good actions&#44; no man&#44; however firm his faith&#44; can be 
said to be decidedly religious and good&#44; being destitute of 
active virtue. Let us illustrate this by an example. A man 
passes along the street&#44; and sees an object of distress&#44; say a 
person just hurt by an unforeseen accident: he is engaged in 
deep thought&#44; and he hastens on regardless of the distressed 
one&#44; though a slight reflection would convince him&#44; that 
his sympathy and his aid might be of service. All at once he is 
roused from his revery by the sound of a multitude of foot&#8211; 
steps hastening to the spot which he has just left&#59; he turns 
round&#44; inquires the cause&#44; and is told&#44; that there is a man in 
great distress unable to move&#44; and upon the whole&#44; the greatest 
object of charity and commiseration imaginable. Immediately 
this man&#44; a few moments before so unconcerned&#44; is also seized 
with the contagion of pity&#44; and pushing liis way through the 
crowd&#44; goes up to the person in distress&#44; and is foremost among 
those who ofler relief. Can such a one be said to have become 
charitable of his own accord&#63; &#8212; This little scene is not alto&#8211; 
gether an imaginary sketch&#44; for I have but little doubt&#44; that 
many have experienced something very similar at some period 
of their life &#59; and it proves&#44; that we may be taught to practise 
charity&#44; even without intending to receive such instruction&#59; and 
no matter&#44; whatever our belief may be at the moment&#44; whether 
we believe in a Deity or not &#59; whether we believe in a revela&#8211; 
tion or not&#59; whether we even believe the poor wretch to be 
deserving of charity or not : we cannot ascribe our charitable 
feelings so suddenly called forth at the moment to any other 
cause than the example of others. &#8212; But now see the dilTerence 
between the different actors in this drama of humanity. The 
gloomy atheist hastens forward to relieve the distress he sees&#59; 
for he believes in an inevitable fate&#44; and he lends his aid&#44; be&#8211; 
cause he himself may one day stand in need of similar assist&#8211; 
ance&#59; it is interest then&#44; nothing but self&#8211;love&#44; which actuates

him. &#8212; The scornful infidel also comes here&#59; he believes in a 
God&#44; but thinks not that there is a Word of God to demand 
this good act of benevolence from him &#59; what spurs him to the 
act&#63; pride certain&#33;&#39;&#44; and perhaps interest&#59; for to the world he 
wishes to display the benevolence of his heart&#44; it is so good 
for effect&#44; and then&#44; perhaps&#44; he may also call to mind&#44; that 
change of circumstances may place him too one day in a situation 
as also to require succour. &#8212; But far different is the case with 
the really virtuous man&#44; he who trusts in God&#39;s providence&#44; 
and believes in his holy Word. When made conscious that his 
help is wanted&#44; he needs no other incentive&#44; than that his God 
demands it of him to do all the good he can&#44; and he&#44; therefore&#44; 
obeys the mandate with alacrity. He flies to the assistance of 
the poor&#44; speaks comfort to their minds&#44; and admonishes them 
to submit with cheerfulness to the decree of Heaven &#59; for all 
that God does is right&#44; and because every thing&#44; yes&#44; punish&#8211; 
ment even&#44; must be eventually for our advantage&#44; if we draw 
a proper lesson fi&#8211;om whatever occurs to us. &#8212; It will thus appear&#44; 
that&#44; though the most opposite in opinion may be acting from the 
impulse of the moment&#44; and may join in the same deed of bene&#8211; 
volence&#44; their feelings and motives will be very different. The 
atheist can be prompted by interest solely&#44; for he sees nothing 
around him but creatures of the same blind chance with him&#8211; 
self&#44; and finds in himself a being that needs at times the assist&#8211; 
ance of these very chance&#8211;impelled machines. &#8212; The infidel 
philosopher acts from a secret motive of pride&#44; no matter how 
muchsoever this pride may lay concealed &#59; and only the true 
believer can act from a motive which alone can give value to 
virtue &#8212; from disinterestedness&#44; as far as this is compatible with 
human nature. 

In the foregoing&#44; I have endeavoured to elucidate the propo&#8211; 
sition&#44; that principles can be imbibed unconsciously &#59; for this 
is not the case with charity alone&#44; but also with the reverence 
we feel for parents &#59; respect for old age &#59; attention to the edu&#8211; 
cation of children &#59; the exercise of impartial justice&#44; and in 
short with every social virtue. &#8212; Now grant even&#44; that the phi&#8211; 
losopher who actually disbelieves revelation should never 
have read the Bible &#59; believe&#44; that he knows not a word of its 
contents &#59; and suppose&#44; if it be possible&#44; that those who edu&#8211;

cated him knew nothing about it themselves : yet as he cannot 
close his eyes to what is going on around him&#44; since he sees 
the actions of those who believe differently from him&#44; can it 
be contended&#44; even under all these circumstances&#44; that he&#44; the 
unbeliever&#44; is not taught the principles of virtue by revelation&#63; 
can it be supposed that any thing other than the example of 
others allures him to the love of justice and goodness &#63; For 
the All&#8211;wise Creator has thrown so great a charm around virtue&#44; 
and has made piety so lovely&#44; that we are drawn towards them 
imperceptibly&#44; and even whilst practising the evil&#44; we feel a 
degradation at not doing the good. And as many a one is 
insensibly led to sin by being exposed to its influence&#44; so may 
piety&#44; being general&#44; also attract unconscious followers &#59; so 
true it is that the force of example is one of the most powerful 
agents in forming our character: and hence too the necessity of 
associating with those only&#44; from whose conduct and conversa&#8211; 
tion something good may be learned. 

Besides the philosophical unbeliever&#44; there are certain men&#44; 
who&#44; although in their own minds persuaded of the truth of 
religion&#44; affect to be doubters&#59; these are generally found 
amongst the gay&#44; or the uneducated&#44; or those who&#44; having 
acquired but a slight degree of knowledge&#44; imagine themselves 
completely fitted to form a comprehensive judgment. Some of 
this class wish to appear more enlightened than their neigh&#8211; 
bours or those who are older and more experienced &#59; and they 
imagine that by ridiculing what others hold sacred&#44; they can 
acquire and deserve the title of men of intelligence. Their 
vanity is the cause of their apparent infidelity&#59; and if they do 
not practise immorality&#44; they are restrained solely by the fear 
of incurring the punishment denounced against sin&#44; but not by 
a true love of God&#44; for they do not honour Him&#44; whilst they 
affect a disregard for his word. Every day&#39;s experience 
proves the existence of such a class of perverse thinkers&#44; and 
perhaps philosophical hypocrites of this kind are as numerous&#44; 
as those who show more veneration for religion than they 
actually possess. 

We have hitherto all along supposed an infidelity accompa&#8211; 
nied by a strict morality&#44; and we have shown that taking it in its 
most favourable light&#44; its sole principle of action can be nothing 

<pb n="53"/>

but pride&#44; or at best&#44; interest and egotism. But if even we say&#8211; 
that a learned infidel could be virtuous in the true sense of the 
word &#59; yet how dreadful must the consequences of his example 
be on others. They see a man blessed with strong mental 
powers professing to think&#44; that the Supreme Ruler has laid no 
further restraint upon our inclinations than our own reason or 
conscience&#44; as it is termed&#44; imposes. The infidel himself&#44; as 
has been said&#44; has a motive for doing right&#44; as his self&#8211;love 
teaches him to beware of losing his fair reputation &#59; his disci&#8211; 
ples&#44; however&#44; have no such check&#44; they are of the common 
herd &#59; they are&#44; every individual almost&#44; belonging to the mass 
of the people at large&#44; whose conduct is scarcely noticed&#44; or if 
noticed soon forgotten. What then&#44; we ask&#44; can prevent them 
from doing every thing which the law forbids &#63; The Bible 
scarcely speaks to them&#44; since they have been taught to despise 
it&#44; and we all know&#44; how inveterate the vulgar are in their pre&#8211; 
judices and predilections&#44; particularly when goaded by some 
indefinite popular cant&#44; the meaning of which they&#44; themselves&#44; 
do not understand.&#39;&#39; The influence&#44; therefore&#44; of infidelity 
upon society at large&#44; may be compared to the act of unchain&#8211; 
ing a tiger&#44; maddened by hunger and captivity&#44; in the midst of 
a populous city having no means of defence &#59; or rather of cut&#8211; 
ting through a dyke&#44; erected as a defence against the sea&#44; 
whilst millions of people are standing upon it in apparent 
security&#44; who must be unable to save themselves before the 
waters of the ocean cover them&#44; and bury them beneath the 
rising and foaming billows. &#8212; So&#44; that if infidelity should even 
be not hurtful to an individual&#44; which is however denied&#44; still 
its bad example will destroy every thing dear to the heart&#44; and 
consequently&#44; on the score of expediency alone&#44; even without 
any other reason&#44; it ought to be discountenanced by every 
friend of the human race. 

If the consequences of such an infidelity&#44; ostensibly founded 
on reason&#44; are so bad&#44; those of the other species&#44; arising from 
fear&#44; are no less pernicious. An infidel from fear&#44; I would call 

&#42; No doubt every reader will call to mind the watchwords of the French 
Revolution of 1789: &#34;Liberty and Equality&#33;&#34; and the &#34;Death to the 
monks&#33;&#34; of the present civil war in Spain.

a man&#44; who after having been guilty of some gross irreligious 
act&#44; or who does not like to undertake the labour which is 
necessary to obtain the mastery over the passions : at last per&#8211; 
suades himself&#44; that whatever of religion he has been taught by 
his parents and teachers is the offspring of prejudice&#44; ignorance&#44; 
and bigotry. Such a one is a coward &#59; he wishes to be assured&#44; 
that religious restraints are not in any manner derived from 
God&#44; and consequently that He cannot punish him for neglecting 
them &#59; but if he could once be brought to think&#44; that religion 
owed its existence to the actual precepts of the Deity&#44; that pun&#8211; 
ishment would sooner or later be meted out for the disregard of 
its precepts&#44; or if he could summon courage enough to condemn 
his own conduct&#44; if he could look upon himself as a sinner and 
transgressor of a divine mandate : it is highly probable that 
this man&#44; who denies revelation from the motives of calming 
his uneasy conscience&#44; would soon become a convert to a better 
course&#44; and endeavour to obey the law&#44; the infraction of which 
threatens him with consequences which he ought to dread. 
For it is reasonable enough to expect&#44; that if a vaunting cow&#8211; 
ardice led him to deny the truth&#44; the consciousness&#44; that he will

impel him to endeavour to make amends for his evil deeds to 
avert the impending punishment. &#8212; But whilst such a man 
remains stupified by sin and unreformed &#59; whilst he pursues&#44; 
unrestrained&#44; his career of vice&#44; he presents us a frightful and 
terrible example to what a state the human mind can be 
degraded. He indulges in m.idnight revelry &#59; he resorts to the 
gaming&#8211;house&#44; for he can find no delight at his own fireside&#44; in 
the bosom of his family &#59; in the mean time his deluded wife&#44; 
rendered wicked perhaps by his example&#44; expects with blood&#8211; 
shot eyes his late return &#59; his ragged children are crying for 
want of food&#59; and having sacrificed all to his sinful appe&#8211; 
tite&#44; he himself is soon covered with the garb of poverty&#44; 
and as by his excesses he has disgusted the good and virtuous 
of his former acquaintance&#44; what remains for him but beggary&#44; 
perhaps suicide&#44; the scaffold&#44; or at best the walls of a prison &#63; &#8212; 
I may be perchance charged with exaggeration &#59; but I ask&#44; 
whether&#44; if infidelity had this influence but on one man even

correct and proper to forewarn the wavering against followino&#8211; 
the path which led one fellow&#8211;being to destruction. 

We have thus seen&#44; that unbelief&#44; be its source pride or fear&#44; 
is equally destructive to the well&#8211;being of society no less than 
to the happiness of individuals&#59; for it requires no argument to 
prove the self&#8211;evident proposition&#44; that a state can only be well 
governed and remain undisturbed by factions&#44; as long as the 
majority are virtuous and well&#8211;disposed to order and obedience 
to the laws. &#8212; Nothing&#44; therefore&#44; can be more true&#44; than the 
words of Holy Writ&#44; which declare : 

&#34; The fool only says in his heart&#44; there is no God.&#34; Psalm xiv. 1. And 

&#34; But fools only despise wisdom and correction.&#34; Proverbs i. 7. 

And it is only the wisdom which especially comes from God&#44; 
which is the source of all the good which the world enjoys &#59; 
and indeed&#44; none but those&#44; who are self&#8211;deluded&#44; can ever 
deny in serious earnest&#44; that the benefits conferred on man bv 
the divine law are really incalculable. In truth&#44; none deny 
the excellence of our code&#44; and the usefulness of its tendency &#59; 
but some wish to derogate from its holiness merely&#44; by levelling 
it down to a human institution. But if we look around us&#44; and 
judge carefully by what is known to us&#44; we must soon acknow&#8211; 
ledge&#44; perhaps much to our mortification&#44; that human wisdom&#44; 
however exalted&#44; was never able to produce laws whose efficacy 
could be tested by the experience of ages&#44; as that of our holy 
law has been. &#8212; Shall we adduce arguments to&#44; prove this&#63; No 
argument is necessary&#59; for look but at the laws of Confucius&#44; 
of Buddah&#44; of Bramah&#44; of Solon&#44; of Lycurgus&#44; and Numa &#59; did 
they effect that for their people&#44; which the Pentateuch has done 
for Israel&#63; The Chinese&#44; the Birmans&#44; and the Hindoos&#44; are 
confessedly ignorant&#44; and the slaves of misrule and superstition &#59; 
and whilst the laws of Solon rendered the Athenians factious 
in politics and loose in morals&#44; and whilst Lycurgus attempted

to banish refinement&#44; and make the state the chief good of his 
citizens : neither was able to preserve his followers from 
merging into other people&#44; with the loss of their independence. 
And even Numa&#44; the founder perhaps of Roman greatness&#44; 
established superstition and soothsaying as a part of his govern&#8211; 
ment&#44; and consequently his system too fell before the spread 
of enlightening principles &#59; and the children of Numa revere 
the law of Moses. What then is there of degradation&#44; what of 
meanness in obeying our laws&#63; Why should pride refuse to 
yield to the enactments of the Supreme&#63; &#8212; You will perhaps 
say&#44; because man is already sufficiently endowed with reason &#59; 
you may say&#44; that the varied occupations of life demand all 
our attention &#59; perchance you may say&#44; that as civilization ad&#8211; 
vances antiquated statutes ought to be discarded. In short&#44; all 
the excuses which interest and vanity can furnish are snatched 
at to justify irreligion&#59; man must exalt himself&#44; in order to show&#44; 
that he needs no instruction of God. &#8212; But why&#44; we ask&#44; should 
a mortal exult so much &#63; why should he rely so much upon his 
finite wisdom&#44; and forget that he is accountable to the Undying 
One&#63; &#8212; Why should the beautiful think so much of adorning 
their persons&#44; and neglect the sacred duties demanded of them&#63; 
Why should the strong one aim at overcoming all the ills and 
dangers of life &#8212; as though he never could be moved&#44; &#8212; and dis&#8211; 
regard the will of God. &#8212; Why should the powerful&#44; nay&#44; even 
the king upon his throne&#44; the conqueror on the day of victory&#44; 
value his own importance so highly as to refuse to follow those 
rules&#44; by which the more humble are guided&#63; &#8212; For often does 
the wisdom of the wise fail them &#59; often does beauty fade in its 
prime &#59; often the strong are cut off in the midst of their career&#44; 
and often the mighty are deprived of their power&#44; and are left 
forgotten and despised. &#8212; There is an instance of a man of 
mighty intellect&#44; who had long delighted the world with the 
effusions of his knowledge &#59; crowds flocked to hear and to ad&#8211; 
mire his eloquence &#59; the shafts of his satire were dreaded&#44; as 
though they were the doom pronounced by an angel of God&#59; 
his praise was received with delight &#59; his name was honoured 
by all his countrymen&#44; and it appeared that he had almost 
I&#39;eached a point&#44; whence he might look with contempt upon 
aught beneath him&#59; when&#44; alas&#33; as if in mockery of human

greatness&#44; his gigantic reason forsook him&#44; and he&#44; whose mind 
was almost a storehouse of knowledge&#44; could not communicate 
his physical wants even to those willing and ready to serve 
him. &#8212; Many a fair one has stood by the side of him she loved&#59; 
she&#44; if any one could&#44; might look with confidence upon a future 
bright and smiling &#59; pleasure seemed to await her&#44; and she was 
declared happy by all beholders. But soon the fair&#44; frail&#44; flower 
pined away&#59; blighting disease seized on her vitals&#44; and in a few 
brief months she was laid low in the dust&#59; her husband was 
left to mourn in solitude&#44; and the house of joy was changed 
into the dwelling of grief&#44; because she&#44; the beloved wife&#44; was 
no more. &#8212; The brave in arms has been known to embark in 
the defence of his country&#39;s cause &#59; he was seen to sleep on the 
bare ground&#44; amongst those whom he led to battle. &#8212; He hurried 
forth to the fight&#44; and glory seemed to lead him on where danger 
was the greatest &#59; but he fell&#44; and though the shout of victory 
was soon raised from rejoicing thousands&#44; the hero heard it not&#44; 
for his body reposed in death. &#8212; Once there reigned a king&#44; who 
was powerful among the powerful&#59; he was called. The Desired&#44; 
The Illustrious &#59; victory too perched on his standard&#44; and his 
mighty rival was humbled by his skill&#44; both in the field and 
the cabinet&#59; who would believe it&#44; if history did not authen&#8211; 
ticate the fact&#44; that this king was hurled from his throne &#8212; was 
cast into prison &#8212; was tried like a felon &#8212; was torn even from 
the society of his family &#8212; and at last&#44; was made a sacrifice to 
popular fury &#63; &#8212; Well does Holy Writ admonish us &#40;Jerm. ix.

Since then&#44; brethren&#44; all human wisdom is imperfect &#8212; since 
all our power is so very circumscribed&#44; why should we refuse 
to learn lessons of wisdom from the Source of all wisdom &#8212; 
from the Creator himself&#63; Why should we not seek his 
counsel in every one of our actions &#59; that is&#44; consult through 
life the record of his words transmitted to us through Moses &#63; 
Why should we omit calling for his aid whenever we are 
afflicted &#63; Why should we not always regard him as our sole 
Protector in happiness&#44; and as our Consoler in sorrow &#63; And 
this&#44; brethren&#44; is precisely the wisdom which revelation teaches &#59; 
it tells us to receive as our guide and instructor the word of 
our Father&#59; it advises us to fly to Him for assistance in our 
troubles &#59; and it promises us knowledge for doing the first&#44; and 
salvation and enlargement for complying vnth the other duty. 
We are further commanded not to harden our hearts&#44; when 
once we have done wrong&#44; and not to persevere in sin under 
the plea that our conduct contradicts no positive rule of right &#59; 
but that if erring&#44; we should purify ourselves by a change of 
conduct&#44; and rely upon the Merciful One for pardon in recom&#8211; 
pense for our sincere amendment. &#8212; If now we wish revelation 
to have its proper effect on us&#44; we should&#44; as said already&#44; be par&#8211; 
ticularly careful&#44; when commencing religious inquiries&#44; to start 
from the proper point&#44; and then never to dive into mysteries 
which must always remain hidden from our knowledge. These 
two points are necessary&#44; that we may not yield to pride and 
think ourselves too wise to learn&#44; and never to look beyond 
what our reason is capable to bear &#59; so that we may not be led 
into mysticism&#44; philosophysing&#44; and irreligion. When you 
now&#44; my respected hearers&#44; commence the study of your reli&#8211; 
gion&#44; and to read with care the books of Sacred Writ&#44; do it 
with humility&#44; with a becoming distrust of your own mental 
powers : never think of finding fault with any thing that is 
obscure to you &#59; and you should reflect&#44; that the God who in&#8211; 
spired his servants to write those splendid lessons of morality&#44; 
and those elevated religious conceptions&#44; must be incapable of 
giving us any thing in these books&#44; which&#44; when properly un&#8211; 
derstood&#44; can be otherwise than good and beneficial. You may 
meet with passages which you do not understand &#59; but do not

reject them as unwise &#8212; on the contrary ascribe it to the insuf&#8211; 
ficiency of your information upon the parts you are studying. 
You may find&#44; that nearly all the personages in the Bible had 
more or less faults&#44; and some of you may therefore think&#44; that 
the holy Scriptures are unfit for reading&#44; because they recount 
vice even. But you should reflect&#44; that the Bible was intended 
to give us a true picture of life&#44; in which the bad as well as the 
good act their part &#59; and God purposed also to inculcate&#44; by 
presenting us with an impartial history of man&#44; that the good 
even may sometimes sin : in order to teach us humility&#44; and to 
caution us against trusting to our own righteousness&#44; and to 
admonish us not to presume upon our own goodness&#44; since no 
one is without his faults. Secondly &#59; when reading the Scrip&#8211; 
tures&#44; and in seeing the transactions of life&#44; you must not en&#8211; 
deavour to inquire too deeply&#44; why and wherefore every thing 
is as you find it&#59; but consider&#44; that as you have not the power 
of altering things at will&#44; and as you cannot understand every 
thing &#40;since even the most scientific does not comprehend the 
nature of substances presented to him&#44; which he can handle&#44; 
analyze and subdivide at pleasure)&#59; the One above must know 
better than we&#44; how all ought to be organized&#44; and that He only 
purposes the well&#8211;being of all his creatures in all He does. &#8212; 
With such views&#44; brethren&#44; you may fearlessly study the 
Scriptures&#44; and think over their contents&#44; and reflect upon the 
structure of the whole universe &#59; and the rather&#44; as you will by 
this means be hourly drawn nearer to your God&#44; and be steadily 
advancing in veneration for his holy Word&#44; which He in 
mercy communicated to mankind. &#8212; In short&#44; it is your duty to 
confide strictly in God&#44; with a single&#44; undivided heart&#44; and to 
believe truly in his laws&#44; and to endeavour always so to live as 
the precepts of this law demand. And so also we read in this 
day&#39;s weekly portion &#40;Deut. xviii. 13&#44;) : 

&#34; Thou shalt be entire with the Lord thy God&#44;&#34; &#8212; 

entire in faith&#44; and simple and devoted in confidence and attach&#8211; 
ment to our Father and Creator. &#8212; How this faith is to be

always guide us unto truth and happiness &#33; Amen.

THE COVENANT. 

Everlasting Father&#44; Creator of all&#44; look down upon thy 
children here assembled to adore Thee&#44; and vouchsafe to accept 
their prayer in favour&#44; and may the offering of their lips be as 
incense before thy seat of mercy. Spread out over them the 
shadow of thy wings&#44; so that they may dwell in safety until 
Thou callest them hence to appear before Thee in judgment. 
let mercy prevail over justice on the approaching day of 
trial&#44; and seal their doom to happiness&#44; according to thy abun&#8211; 
dant kindness. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

Another year is nearly ended&#44; and again does the returning 
autumn admonish us that we are approaching nearer and nearer 
to the termination of our earthly career. Behold the husband&#8211; 
man is busy now with gathering in the produce of the labour 
of his hands&#44; and with joyous countenance he surveys the rich 
blessings which Providence has so kindly bestowed on him in 
the season which has just elapsed. See how every one is 
hastening to provide for the coming winter&#44; when all labour in 
the field must cease&#44; when only those who laboured&#44; whilst the 
time was yet favourable&#44; can think of enjoying ease and comfort.

THE COVENANT. 61 

But WO to the heedless ones&#44; for want and sorrow must be 
theirs when the bleak frost shuts out from view the surface of 
this beautiful earth&#44; and covers all with the robe of desolation. 
Already the days are shortening&#44; and soon the long dreary 
nights will usurp the place of the gladsome days of summer. 
More and more we are admonished&#44; that a severer season is 
coming&#44; and that the pleasures which the spring and summer 
afforded&#44; can in a short time be no longer enjoyed when winter 
rules the year. But spring will in its turn come again to re&#8211; 
visit the earth&#44; and restore to us the delights which it imparted 
before. &#8212; Man&#44; too&#44; has his spring&#8211;time of life&#44; his youth and 
vigour &#59; the strength of manhood&#39;s years &#59; the ripeness of his 
intellect &#59; and at last his decay of bodily&#44; perhaps of mental&#44; 
powers : but&#44; unlike the changes of the year&#44; to him no youth 
returns&#44; and the labour once neglected cannot be done in an&#8211; 
other period&#44; and the time&#44; once misspent&#44; is lost for ever. Yes&#44; 
for ever &#33; although the sound does fall so fearfully upon the 
ear&#44; and throw so terrible a spell over the imagination &#59; and 
thus every thing&#44; from the overthrow of a mighty empire to 
the occurrences of ordinary life&#44; tells us : &#34;That our days are 
but a shadow on earth &#33;&#34; &#8212; Yet our time is long enough to enable 
us to do many a good act &#59; and to prove that we are worthy of 
being called the children of the Lord. This end is obtained 
by an ever active pursuit of virtue&#44; and an always zealous ob&#8211; 
servance of the ordinances of religion&#44; which a man is to do to 
obtain through them life everlasting. We should therefore 
make it the unwavering rule of our whole existence on earth&#44; 
to join to a sincere and heartfelt fear of God a cheerful obedi&#8211; 
ence to the laws&#44; which He has prescribed&#44; for thus only can 
we accomplish the object of our creation. 

We have had occasion before this&#44; to notice several passages 
of the last address of Moses to the Israelites &#59; and we have seen 
how forcible the admonitions are which he impressed upon 
their minds before his death. In this address he had recapitu&#8211; 
lated briefly the principal events which had taken place since 
the redemption from Egypt : he also had recounted many 
precepts&#44; and besought the Israelites to remain true to their 
God &#59; and in conclusion had pronounced terrible denunciations 
in case they should stray into the path of sin&#44; &#8212; The last day of 

VOL. I. &#8212; 6

his mission was now close at hand&#44; when he thus spoke to the 
assembled congregation : &#34; You stand this day&#44; all of you&#44; 
before the Lord your God &#59; your heads&#44; your tribes&#44; your 
elders&#44; and your officers of justice&#44; &#8212; every man of Israel. Your 
children&#44; your wives&#44; and the stranger that is within thy camp&#44; 
from the hewer of thy wood to the drawer of thy water. For 
the sake that thou mayest pass &#40;accede to) through the covenant 
of the Lord thy God&#44; and through his oath&#44; which the Lord thy 
God makes with thee this day.&#34; &#40;Deut. xxix. 9&#8211;11.) You will 
readily observe&#44; that Moses addressed indiscriminately every 
individual in the camp&#44; to show us&#44; that no man&#44; however mean 
or exalted his station&#44; can in anywise exonerate himself from 
being a party to the covenant of the Lord. He says : &#34; You 
stand this day&#44; all of you&#44; before the Lord &#59;&#34; indicating to 
them&#44; that all were taken as the servants of the Lord&#44; and that 
the watchful eye of Providence was directed to every one indi&#8211; 
vidually&#44; and that therefore every one should look upon himself 
as acceding separately to the covenant which was made with 
them on that day. This view also will explain&#44; probably&#44; why 
the teacher first says : &#34; You stand&#44;&#34; and afterwards&#44; &#34; that 
thou mayest enter &#59;&#34; for in fact he speaks to the whole nation 
first&#44; and then to every man&#44; separately viewed&#44; of all Israel. &#8212; 
To this separate schooling of the whole people&#44; to the fact that 
all were taught to look upon themselves as alike children of 
salvation&#44; may be ascribed the extraordinary circumstance &#40;ren&#8211; 
dered probable by the internal evidence of Deuteronomy)&#44; that 
at the period of Moses&#39;s death there was a perfect unanimity 
with regard to the observance of the precepts of the law &#59; and 
we are led to believe that at this time all felt themselves im&#8211; 
pelled to respect those institutions which conferred upon them 
the extraordinary privilege of a perfect equality in the eye of 
the law &#40;since no one could assume any superiority which was 
not delegated to him voluntarily)&#44; besides an absolute security 
of body and property. And it accordingly happened&#44; that as 
long as this devotion to the ceremonial part of the law was 
maintained&#44; peace and security reigned throughout all the 
boundaries of Israel &#59; for whilst the just fear of God was every 
where predominant&#44; the relative position between the people 
and their rulers was also preserved&#44; &#8212; and neither servile sub&#8211;

mission nor tyrannical sway was known in our land &#59; since the 
regard paid to one portion of the Mosaic code was a security 
for the maintenance of the other. And in truth it seemed as 
though the Almighty had personally descended to assume&#44; in 
his glory&#44; the rule over his people. Here then was a people 
acknowledging One God&#44; unseen and incorporeal &#59; whilst sur&#8211; 
rounding nations bowed to many deities &#8212; the work of their 
own hands&#44; and the offspring of their disordered fancy. Here 
was a people worshipping in humble meekness&#44; in perfect con&#8211; 
sonance&#44; with reason&#44; the everblessed and adored One &#59; whilst 
surrounding nations sacrificed human victims to the idol of 
abomination. Here was a people protected by just and equit&#8211; 
able laws&#44; and living securely under the benevolent rule of 
accepted leaders &#59; whilst all around Palestine frightful despot&#8211; 
ism ruled with iron sway&#44; and subjected whole communities to 
the arbitrary decisions of deified evil&#8211;doers&#44; or the false pro&#8211; 
phecies of designing impostors. Thus was the superiority of 
God&#39;s covenant manifested&#44; and thus was exemplified&#44; that 
happy must be that people to whom the Eternal One is God. &#8212; 
blessed days of our national prosperity &#33; you have&#44; alas &#33; too 
soon passed away&#44; and we now must mourn over our glory that 
has fallen&#44; and over the people that are scattered and oppressed 
amongst the gentiles &#33; 

But&#44; brethren&#44; let me entreat you on this day&#44; when the 
solemn period of the year is approaching&#59; the day when&#44; 
according to our received tradition&#44; judgment will he held over 
all nations&#44; not to suffer the example of your ancestors to be lost 
upon you. Reflect that you are their lineal descendants&#44; and the 
inheritors of the Law of which they were made the depositary. 
Consider what it is that demands your attention&#44; and by what 
ties you are bound to the Lord&#44; and what bonds unite you to 
the departed great of early days&#44; who were designated as the 
chosen friends of God&#44; the immortal patriarchs&#44; Abraham&#44; Isaac&#44; 
and Jacob&#44; who&#44; whilst yet ignorance reigned triumphant&#44; 
whilst yet the deepest mental gicom&#8211; 3ov>ered. &#34;the eavtb&#44; stood 
forth as the champions of religion and morality&#44; and spread the 
lisht of the fear of God inco tvary la>&#8211;id. wldoli&#39; their loo&#44;&#59;.steps 
touched in their wandermgs. You ought to be conscious&#44; that 
it is your province to prove to the world how great your 

<pb n="64"/>

64 &#39; THE COVENANT. 

attachment is for the heavenly legacy in your possession&#44; and 
to make it manifest to all nations&#44; that you are Israelites not in 
name and to place it beyond a doubt&#44; that you are 
really deserving of being denominated the chosen people &#8212; the 
people selected by the Supreme Wisdom to be a beacon to all 
nations&#44; that they may be led&#44; through you&#44; unto that point of 
goodness&#44; where virtue and happiness meet&#44; where perfection 
and beatitude are united. Remember too that not only to the 
Israelites in the wilderness the Law was given&#44; but that to us 
also&#44; assembled here this day&#44; the father of the prophets 
addressed his solemn warning in the following words: 

&#34;But not with you alone do I make this covenant and this oath of con&#8211; 
firmation &#59; but with him who is here this day with us&#44; standing before the 
Lord our God&#44; and with him who is not with us here this day.&#34; 

Deut. xxix. 12. 

These words of Moses are explicit&#44; and he means to indicate 
that no generation of Israelites&#44; no matter how far removed 
from the period of the promulgation of the Law&#44; can ever 
divorce themselves from the observance of the commandments 
of the Lord. True it is&#44; that we have no longer an oppor&#8211; 
tunity of bringing sacrifices &#59; we have no longer a priest to 
administer at the altar of God : we are consequently prevented 
from complying with all the ceremonial statutes &#59; but this does 
not release us from those which are yet practicable &#8212; from those 
everlasting ordinances which were to be practised &#34;in all the 
places of our residence&#44;&#34; and through which Israel has been so 
often blessed and signally benefitted. Look at the beautiful 
institution of the weekly day of rest&#44; the symbol of the ever&#8211; 
lasting re&#39;pose Of&#34; the blesseo he)eafter&#44; and the evidence of 
God&#39;s rule on earth. The whole week man has been toiling 
to&#39;ob&#40;a&#34;n food for&#34;hir&#34;>deif&#39; &#59; and those dependant upon his exer&#8211; 
tio&#39;n&#44; to provide raiment and&#39; shelter&#39; for his&#39;wife and offspring&#44; 
to shield them by human means from the dire mishaps of life&#44;

and to acquire for them comforts and luxuries&#44; and to place 
them in a respectable and honoured station in society. Six 
days he has thus laboured &#59; by day exposed to the scorching 
sun&#44; and by night unrefreshed by sleep that fled from his 
anxious pillow. But at length the blessed Sabbath arrives: 
the toil of the slave is suspended &#59; the incessant blows of the 
artizan&#39;s hammer cease &#59; the merchant closes his warehouse&#44; 
and the industrious husbandman returns from the field to enjoy 
the day of the Lord in the bosom of his family. Behold the 
house of God is opened &#59; group after group enters&#44; and all sit 
awaiting the opening of the service offered up to our Maker. 
Hear the solemn hymn ascending &#59; hear the fervent prayer of 
the devout&#44; sweeter far than the fat of rams &#59; listen to the word 
that is proclaimed aloud by the messenger in whom the con&#8211; 
gregation confide &#59; behold the great hilarity that pervades all &#59; 
and can you&#44; can any mortal refuse to join in the thanks&#8211; 
giving : &#34; Praised be the Lord who has given rest to His peo&#8211; 
ple Israel &#63;&#34; Not so ungrateful can you prove to the heavenly 
gift&#44; which gives rest&#44; and ease&#44; and enlargement to the high and 
the humble&#44;&#39;&#39; but all will gladly exclaim : &#34; Praised be Thou&#44; 
Lord&#44; who sanctifiest the Sabbath.&#34; 

In the change of seasons various labours engage the sons of 
man &#59; days of toil and nights of anxious thoughts are devoted 
to the increase of their physical prosperity&#44; and but little atten&#8211; 
tion is given to the welfare of the undying spirit. And thus 
it happens that men spend their days without thinking of moral 
perfection &#59; and many a one&#44; therefore&#44; heaps sin upon trans&#8211; 
gression and misdeed upon offence&#44; heedless that the path he 
is pursuing is the way of death. It was in mercy&#44; therefore&#44; 
that God devoted one day in the year for reflection : one day&#44; 
on which his creatures should review their past conduct&#44; and 
endeavour to correct whatever of evil they may find&#44; and to 
fortify themselves in the good they have hitherto done. This 
day is the Day of Atonement&#44; to which we are now fast 
approaching. &#8212; It is this day&#44; which has been instituted as the 

&#42; In the above sketch&#44; I have endeavoured to exhibit what a Sabbath 
should be&#44; and as it was observed in former times. But the spirit of gain 
now often induces labour on the seventh day even&#59; yet may we not hope&#44; 
that a speedy change will come over this evil spirit of our age &#63;

66 THE COVENANT. 

season of universal penitence&#44; fasting and prayer for the whole 
house of Israel &#59; the day on which the Lord assured his servant 
Moses&#44; when interceding for the rebellious people&#44; that He had 
forgiven their iniquity. &#8212; I said&#44; that it is a day of reflection and 
penitence. It is not enough&#44; that we should assemble and pray 
outwardly &#59; it is not enough that we say : &#34; We have sinned &#59;&#34; 
but that the heart too should feel what the mouth utters&#44; and 
no duplicity must dwell in our thoughts&#44; when we appear at the 
foot of the throne of glory to ask forgiveness for our sins. It 
is therefore that the notes of preparation are sounded&#44; therefore 
the cornet is blown on the first day of the year&#44; to address 
itself in an audible voice to the slumberers&#44; to rouse the loi&#8211; 
terers on the path of virtue &#59; and to admonish them to make 
reparation for the wrong they have done towards their Maker&#44; 
and to satisfy those of their fellowmen whom they have 
wronged or offended&#44; before cometh the day of the Lord. It 
is thus that the Sabbath&#44; as well as the Day of Atonement&#44; must 
tend to invigorate the body for renewed toil and exertion&#44; and 
to fortify the soul in the true feeling of religion&#44;&#39;by reconciling 
us to our God&#44; and restoring peace and harmony between 
offended brothers. But it is needless to consume much time in 
pointing out the beauties of our religion&#44; since they must be 
obvious to any one gifted with but a small share of penetration. 
My object in dwelling upon the subject at all&#44; was to prove to 
you&#44; that the Law itself is yet capable of being followed &#59; to 
admonish you to be careful in the observance of its holy pre&#8211; 
cepts&#44; and to impress upon your minds the obligation which 
rests upon you&#44; in consequence of your being parties to the 
covenant of God with Israel. &#8212; In continuation of the extract 
furnished above we are told by Moses&#44; that God intended to 
raise us&#44; in consequence of this covenant&#44; to be His people&#44; and 
that He also would in accordance with the same&#44; be our God. 
Some one may now ask : &#34; What is meant by the Israelites 
being made the people of God&#44; since all the world is his &#63; 
What is meant by his becoming the God of the Israelites&#44; wdien 
He is the Creator and Ruler of every being that inhabits the 
universe&#63;&#34; To this we answer: To be the people&#44; the pecu&#8211; 
liar people of God&#44; is to be very careful so to live as this God 
directs&#59; and He to be our God means&#44; that He would bestow a

particular watchfulness and a more direct protection as a reward 
for this obedience. Before the period at which Moses spoke&#44; 
we had been chosen to receive the Law of the Lord as the 
descendants of those particularly pious men&#44; who&#44; as we said 
above&#44; stepped forth as the adorers of the Most High&#44; when the 
rest of mankind was addicted to the grossest superstition &#59; but 
after the divine descent on Sinai&#44; we were promised the favour 
of Heaven only as a reward for filial confidence in the power 
of the Lord&#44; and a strict conformity to his will : and for diso&#8211; 
bedience&#44; punishment was denounced &#59; and when our nation&#44; 
in despite of the most solemn warnings&#44; did transgress&#44; calamity 
followed calamity&#44; and they were surrendered to slaughter and 
slavery &#59; their pleasant land was devastated &#59; their fortified 
towns&#44; which seemed to bid defiance to the hand of time&#44; were 
levelled to the ground&#44; and in vain does the inquiring traveller 
search for the site of some places the most renowned in the his&#8211; 
tory of our people &#59; and at others&#44; the blackened and scattered 
ruins speak&#44; alas &#33; too plainly&#44; that desolation has stalked 
abroad over Palestine&#44; and the deserted districts proclaim&#44; that 
the aven2&#59;er&#39;s sword has done its work. 

How then can sinners think themselves secure from punish&#8211; 
ment&#63; did it ever fail to strike&#44; though its blows were a long 
while stayed &#63; What government was more feared than that of 
Israel&#44; under David and Solomon &#63; what nation was more refin&#8211; 
ed than that subject to the wisest of men&#63; What building was 
more the pride and ornament of the world&#44; than was the tem&#8211; 
ple at Jerusalem&#63; And yet everything was subverted&#44; and 
all that was noble&#44; with that which was grand&#44; was overthrown&#44; 
when sin had sapped the foundation of the holy edifice &#33; Let 
not the wicked then imagine&#44; that he is guarded against the 
evil &#59; true&#44; his path may appear to lead along verdant banks 
and through flowering meadows&#44; &#8212; all nature may seem to smile 
upon his undertakings&#59; his wisdom may seem to cover all his 
plans&#44; as the shield covers the warrior&#44; from all untoward acci&#8211; 
dents &#33; But suddenly the evil may fly down from its hiding 
place&#44; whence it has long been watching its destined prey&#44; and 
alight upon the crest that never stooped &#59; and rend the helmet&#44; 
that withstood a thousand shocks &#59; and shiver the lance which 
ever was victorious&#59; and break the shield&#44; which always pro&#8211;

tected &#59; and tear out the heart&#44; that e&#39;er remained firm &#8212; never 
knew the throb of fear &#8212; never experienced the emotions of 
pity &#8212; and never succumbed to the force of a divine guidance. 
And&#44; believe me&#44; brethren&#44; that however firmly a man may 
be fixed in prosperity&#44; however grand his views may be&#44; and 
however seemingly boundless his resources &#59; there is a period 
which will come&#44; be it soon or late&#44; when all this grandeur 
will vanish&#44; when the offspring of the mightiest genius will 
pass away&#44; when the wisdom of the wisest will be set at naught. 
This we have been taught by ages of experience&#44; since every 
thing and every man have been compelled to give way before 
some mightier successor. Thus have systems of government 
become antiquated&#59; thus have monuments of art been hurled 
from their places&#59; and thus have the sayings of the wisest been 
lost to posterity. And of all that has ever yet been held great 
by men&#44; only one thing has withstood the shock of ages&#44; and 
survives in all its youthful beauty&#44; this is : THE REVELA&#8211; 
TION OF OUR GOD &#33; Years have passed since it was pro&#8211; 
mulgated&#44; nay&#44; our very nation has ceased to be ruled by the 
statutes it contains &#59; yet the Word itself has never perished&#44; and 
we have the assurance of God&#44; that it never will be forgotten &#59; 
but ages will rise after ages&#44;&#44; and they shall all drink from the 
holy fountain&#44; which supplies so bountifully the life&#8211;dispensing 
stream. Let it&#44; therefore&#44; be your immoveable purpose&#44; bre&#8211; 
thren&#44; to prove by word and deed your sincere attachment for 
this precious gift. You&#44; amongst my hearers&#44; who are enter&#8211; 
ing life&#44; seize it with eagerness&#44; clasp it to your bosom&#44; and 
call him your deadly enemy&#44; who would endeavour to deprive 
you of that which is the life of your life&#33; &#8212; You&#44; who are in 
your full vigour and strength&#44; take it as your guide in all your 
doings&#44; and if for a season you have neglected it&#44; employ a dili&#8211; 
gence and a care&#44; assiduous and unceasing&#44; to regain the advan&#8211; 
tages which you have wilfully or carelessly idled away&#33; &#8212; And 
you&#44; aged ones&#44; to whom the grave already opens its awful 
glooms&#44; consider it as the only support which can at all make 
the bed of death easy for you&#44; which alone can soften the 
terrors which must appal you at your departure hence&#44; which 
already before your dissolution&#44; gives you a foretaste of the

period be devoted to repentance&#44; and to a sincere seeking of the 
Lord&#44; before He cometh to judge the world &#59; who knows&#44; but 
He may see that you are sincere in your sorrow&#44; and avert the 
evil which his justice may have decreed&#33;

of mercy&#44; receive in thy mercy the returning sinner&#44; and dis&#8211;

comest to review them as the shepherd numbers his flock. Hold 
out thy protecting arm over them&#44; that are the children of 
thy servants&#44; that they may ever live to proclaim the glories 
of thy holy name&#33; Amen.

70 SIN AND REPENTANCE. 

Brethren of the House of Israel &#33; 
We have been often told&#44; that man is sinful by disposition&#44; 
and that his inclinations are more directed to the practice of 
evil than of the good. This is often given as an excuse for 
manifold transgressions&#44; and the worst actions are justified by 
an appeal to human nature. Men slumber supinely in their 
moral indolence&#44; commit daily what they are admonished is 
evil&#44; and from an utter prostration of all moral energy&#44; are led&#44; 
step by step&#44; into that chaos of misdeeds&#44; where the multipli&#8211; 
city of wickedness seems to bar the way for the egress of the 
sinner. And when we see a man so devoid of virtue&#44; why he 
does not alter &#63; he says&#44; that he cannot help himself&#44; that habit 
has become second nature&#44; and that it is utterly impossible for 
him to tell to the world&#44; by now changing his conduct&#44; that he 
himself considers his former course as wrong&#44; and that he has 
a character for consistency to support &#59; and then he adds some 
comparison between himself and others&#44; who are perhaps worse 
in some points&#44; &#8212; appeals to some few passages of Holy Writ&#44; 
or sayings of the wise &#40;which he erroneously explains in his 
justification)&#44; and may proceed perhaps so far&#44; as to endea&#8211; 
vour to make it appear&#44; that he is&#44; upon the whole&#44; a really 
virtuous and a sincerely pious man &#59; and he&#44; thus forbids the 
approach to any one&#44; who might be induced to ofier him whole&#8211; 
some advice&#44; and to admonish him&#44; lest he sink completely into 
the slough of corruption. &#8212; But&#44; brethren&#44; human nature is not 
so wicked as the indolent and designing represent it &#59; human 
reason is not so unfortified as some imagine&#44; who might ask : 
&#34; How are we to know what is right&#63;&#34; habit is not insupera&#8211; 
ble &#59; and Holy Writ nowhere teaches that sin cannot be amend&#8211; 
ed. &#8212; Yet some one may demand of us: &#34;Does not evil exist&#63; 
Is not the inclination to sin an ingredient in human nature&#63;&#34; 
To these questions we are willing to answer: that evil does in 
reality exist&#44; that&#44; doubtlessly&#44; the tendency to sin is one of 
the principal ingredients in our nature &#59; but at the same time 
we contend&#44; that this very tendency is the chief requisite to 
constitute man as God intended him&#44; a mixture both of spirit 
and matter. Look&#44; I pray you&#44; brethren&#44; into the works of 
the Almighty&#44; and you will find&#44; that He has created difierent

orders of beings&#44; who are all perfect in the position they oc&#8211; 
cupy in the scale of creation. There are the beasts whose in&#8211; 
clinations are purely earthly&#44; and whose desires are never 
turned to the intellectual&#59; they are perfect in their kind&#44; for 
these desires tend to preserve them alive and propagate their 
species&#44; and as they are not endowed with intellect&#44; no prac&#8211; 
tice of virtue is to them necessary to render them happy&#44; and 
they&#44; therefore&#44; want nothing to satisfy their mind&#44; after their 
appetite is stilled. As virtue is&#44; according to this view&#44; incom&#8211; 
patible with the nature of animals&#44; the practice of duties arising 
from the same is also incompatible with their nature &#59; and a 
beast&#44; therefore&#44; has fulfilled the object of its creation&#44; if it is 
careful of its self&#8211;preservation. &#8212; Opposite to the brute kind&#44; 
stand those illustrious messengers of God&#44; whom we term 
angels&#59;&#42; these are pure spirits&#44; that is to say&#44; nothing earthly&#44; 
nothing sensual&#44; nothing mortal&#44; nothing sinful is in their 
composition&#44; but free from aught&#44; save a pure love to their 
Maker&#44; they are unconscious of evil inclinations&#44; and they 
prove their love and undivided obedience by an always ready 
compliance with the will of God. &#8212; Between the brute and the 
angel&#44; stands man&#44; &#8212; this master&#8211;piece of the Creator&#44; &#8212; a being 
possessing expansive views and great capacities of spirit&#44; joined 
with earthly desires and propensities&#44; and means to satisfy these 
desires&#59; or&#44; in other words&#44; the beast is purely sensual&#44; the angel 
purely spiritual&#44; and man is a compound of both these charac&#8211; 
teristics&#59; so that he occupies the middle station between the 
inferior and the higher grades of beings. It is not ours to in&#8211; 
quire&#44; why God in his wisdom was pleased to form these three 
varying classes of creatures &#59; it is enough for us to know&#44; that 
so is the fact&#44; and we cannot&#44; nay&#44; we dare not attempt to arraign 
this wisdom in the judgment of our circumscribed knowledge. 

Thus then we must discover&#44; that in the gradual ascent from 
the lower to the higher&#44; which is displayed in the whole sys&#8211; 
tem of nature&#44; it was perfectly consonant with the arrangement 
of every thing as instituted by the Creator&#44; to form man as the

point where the earthly and the heavenly were to be blended &#59; 
and consequently it was&#44; of necessity&#44; to be expected that this 
being in the scale of nature&#44; should be endowed&#44; from the posi&#8211; 
tion he occupies&#44; with a portion of evil along with a great 
degree of good. You will now see&#44; that the ingredient in our 
nature&#44; which we denominate evil&#44; is counterbalanced by the 
principle of good &#59; or in other words&#44; if God has implanted 
within us earthly desires&#44; He has in a degree fully as great 
made it necessary for us to become familiar with virtue &#59; and 
that&#44; therefore&#44; it is impossible to imagine a human being so 
totally depraved as to be devoid of every good feeling &#59; and we 
may safely add&#44; that&#44; if we range over the whole mass of man&#8211; 
kind&#44; we will not find one individual&#44; however bad&#44; who has not 
in his composition&#44; nay&#44; in his outward deportment&#44; something 
which compels us to acknowledge&#44; that the image of God has 
nQ&#44;t been entirely defaced in him &#59; and thus it happens&#44; that the 
most obdurate transgressor bears evidence of the goodness and 
wisdom of the Creator. 

If now human nature is not so radically defective&#44; as the 
indolent sinner represents it &#59; if&#44; in fact&#44; it is capable of being 
rendered an ornament and a blessing to the possessor : we ought 
next to inquire how this is to be effected&#44; and to look for the 
means&#44; by which human reason can be fortified to improve 
human nature&#59; or to speak more correctly&#44; how is man to be 
made acquainted with that knowledge which will enable him 
to do nothing dissonant with the reason which was bestowed 
on him&#44; and to do that only which will elevate the moral good 
in his composition over the moral evil &#63; For if it is once 
admitted&#44; that human nature is not radically defective &#59; if it is 
conceded&#44; that human reason has a guide to direct its steps 
to an always progressive improvement : it follows&#44; that we 
have only to know this guide to be in possession of the means&#44; 
if we have the will&#44; to become as good as the shortness of our 
existence here will permit us &#59; and let me observe once for 
all&#44; in this place&#44; that this is all which the All&#8211;wise Father 
demands &#59; and if we have faithfully done all that lay in our 
power&#44; no matter how little soever this may have been&#44; we have 
acted to the satisfaction of our Maker. Now the question 
recurs : &#34; How is human reason to be fortified and improved &#63;&#34; 

    <pb n="73"/>

SIN AND REPENTANCE. 73 

To this we answer : &#34;By the revealed word of God &#33;&#34; for 
this is the guide which will lead us in the path we should go&#44; 
and which will make us acquainted with the duties expected 
from us. In this manner then&#44; we know how to be virtuous &#59; 
and consequently we can frame no excuse arising from the 
defectiveness of human nature&#44; &#40;since there exists none&#44;) for 
being otherwise than morally and religiously good. True&#44; the 
exercise of religious duties may interfere with our convenience : 
true&#44; that the precepts of revelation may not be all alike clear 
and intelligible to us &#59; but then we have the power given to us 
from above to subdue any obstacle arising within ourselves&#44; 
from the bent of our inclinations&#59; and to doubts springing from a 
not sufficiently explained reason of any particular precept&#44; we 
can oppose a firm confidence in the Supreme Wisdom&#44; and this 
confidence will teach us&#44; that nothing emanating from God can 
be otherwise than good&#44; otherwise than wise&#44; otherwise than 
beneficent and wholesome. It is thus&#44; that we can overcome 
whatever is&#44; according to our limited judgment&#44; defective in 
our composition&#44; and thus we can supply all the light which 
our own unassisted reason is unable to attain. Here now we 
see the wisdom of God pre&#8211;eminently displayed. He found it 
consonant with his plan&#44; to make man a compound of good 
and evil &#59; a being&#44; in whom the inclination to virtue is always 
contending with the desire for sin &#59; a creature whose mind&#44; 
though rude in its natural state&#44; is yet capable of being polished 
and improved constantly by instruction and example. If now&#44; 
no other resource besides this capacity had been given&#44; and as 
outward impressions daily take different forms&#44; and conse&#8211; 
quently convey difierent ideas&#44; we should have man always a 
prey to counteracting principles and a slave to uncertainty. 
But the other yet wanting resource has also been conferred&#44; 
that is&#44; a revelation of what is the truly useful in the eyes of 
God has been handed down&#44; to assist him in combatting the 
evil&#44; and to teach him how to distinguish between the good 
and the bad. Revelation should&#44; therefore&#44; not be regarded as 
a restraint so much&#44; as an assistant to man in his earthly exist&#8211; 
ence and a sure instructor of righteousness. To be virtuous 
then&#44; means&#44; so to direct our inclinations and actions as the 
knowledge of the good demands&#44; and always to withstand those

desires which the word of God declares to be sinful. And 
sinning is a deviation from God&#39;s will as contained in the 
Bible&#44; superinduced by following the propensity to evil rather 
than obeying the commandments of the Lord&#44; and by neglecting 
the duties demanded of us by the religion which was bestowed 
on mankind as the best gift of Heaven. 

If we next come to investigate the source of sin&#44; we shall be 
able to trace it to two principal causes&#44; to which all others are 
only subordinate &#59; the first is arrogance&#44; &#8212; the second careless&#8211; 
ness. First&#44; as to arrogance. The vain&#8211;glorious man&#44; who 
thinks too highly of his own importance in the scale of beings&#44; 
in whose estimation his own interest&#44; pursuits&#44; and will&#44; are 
paramount to all other considerations&#44; will not submit to be 
directed by any one&#44; even if this one should be his Maker &#8212; He 
to whom he owes the obedience a child owes his parents. He 
to whom he should pay the reverence which a servant should 
pay to his master. Yet speak to such a man of religion&#44; say 
aught to him about his having duties to fulfil other than those 
of gratifying his desires : and he will scoff at you as weak&#8211; 
minded and superstitious&#44; and he will never suffer any thing 
at all resembling a sympathy with the religious feelings of his 
fellow&#8211;men to disturb his unnatural tranquillity &#59; and in this 
manner&#44; allowing the evil in his disposition to prevail&#44; he by 
degrees sinks lower and lower into the whirlpool of transgres&#8211; 
sion&#44; and we have before us one who is every way depraved&#44; 
yet assuming all the importance which virtue alone should 
impart. And still it is true that real virtue is always meek&#44; 
never assumes importance&#44; even if due to it &#59; whilst the oppo&#8211; 
site quality is arrogant&#44; haughty&#44; and overbearing &#59; and when&#8211; 
ever we find a man thinking highly of himself&#44; boasting of his 
attainments&#44; and recounting his virtues&#44; we may safely aver&#44; 
that he is destitute both of wisdom and virtue. &#8212; A man&#44; there&#8211; 
fore&#44; who is arrogant&#44; will naturally enough neglect every pur&#8211; 
suit except that which will tend to his own glorification &#59; for 
as he is so much inflated with the idea of his self&#8211;importance&#44; 
he will yield the reins to his inclinations whenever self can be 
gratified&#44; or interest promoted&#44; and thus he must daily stray to 
a greater distance from the point whither he should direct his 
steps. 

    <pb n="75"/>

SIN AND REPENTANCE. 75 

The careless one on the other hand is deaf to admonition&#44; 
because he imagines that it is impossible for him to make the 
least change in his conduct. To every advice he will answer&#44; 
that it is out of his power to act differently&#44; because his course 
is consistent with human frailty&#44; &#8212; or that he must do a parti&#8211; 
cular thing&#44; because he cannot resist his inclinations &#59; and as 
an excuse for pretermitting any virtue&#44; he may say that it would 
expose him to too many difficulties. &#8212; But do you not perceive 
that one arguing thus degrades the name of man &#63; He says&#44; 
that his power over himself is incomplete&#44; he arraigns the 
wisdom of the Creator in making him so imperfect&#44; &#8212; when he 
he himself alone is to blame &#59; when his own supineness alone 
forbids his making any active exertions &#59; when in truth he 
could be good if he would but listen to the virtuous impulse 
which is no less within him than in the bosom of the best and 
greatest &#59; and he is thus wilfully bad&#44; and he thus trifles away 
his eternal welfare&#44; by vainly imagining that an extraordinary 
aid from above must be specially rendered to make him reli&#8211; 
gious. &#8212; To avoid sinning&#44; therefore&#44; it is necessary to take a 
proper estimate of ourselves&#44; and to reflect&#44; that we are neither 
perfect in wickedness nor unexceptionable in goodness &#59; that 
our reason is something&#44; though far from every thing &#59; and that 
the rudeness and uncertainty attendant on the uneducated state 
can easily be removed by a careful attention to the divine in&#8211; 
struction that is daily offered to us. If thus we preserve a 
proper balance between meanness and pride&#44; and if we look 
back on the one side at our humble origin&#44; and on the other 
turn our view forward to the glorious destiny promised us as 
the reward of virtue : religion and piety must become the 
object of our chief desire&#44; we must become unavoidably virtu&#8211; 
ous&#44; and the very ingredient of evil with which we are endowed&#44; 
must give additional firmness to our actions&#44; and additional 
circumspection to our holy undertakings. 

But some one may say whilst doing the wrong : &#34; I have sin&#8211; 
ned&#44; I have been wicked&#44; I have transgressed &#59; but Holy Writ 
itself speaks of innate wickedness&#44; of sin being a ruler of 
human nature&#44; I feel the impossibility of altering my way of 
life&#59; besides I have sinned beyond the hope of forgiveness &#59; the 
very name of virtue can never more be coupled with my name&#59;&#34; 
and arguing so despondingly he may perhaps dash blindly

onward &#59; try perhaps to drown the misgivings of despair in 
intemperance&#44; and thus become in fact that very outcast which 
he conceives himself to be. To combat&#44; therefore&#44; this wretched 
sinfulness&#44; which would make the word of God its excuse&#44; it 
becomes imperiously necessary first to understand what Holy 
Writ teaches on this subject&#44; and next to inquire if inveterate 
habits cannot be eradicated by means which the Almighty has 
placed within our power. If we examine with candour the 
texts found in Scripture relative to the power of sin over man&#44; 
we must arrive at the conclusion&#44; that they uniformly inculcate&#44; 
that&#44; although there is a disposition&#44; and this a powerful dispo&#8211; 
sition&#44; to evil&#44; there is yet an inherent power to do good exist&#8211; 
ing in a superior degree. For we read in Genesis&#44; chap. iv. 6 : 
&#34; Behold &#33; if thou actest well&#44; thou wilt be accepted &#59;&#42; but 
if thou doest not act well&#44; sin will rest at the door &#59; and to 
thee is its desire &#59; but thou canst rule over it.&#34; Here we are 
told&#44; as clearly as words can do it&#44; that no matter how great 
the internal temptation to sin may be&#44; the internal power to sub&#8211; 
due such an inclination is still greater. It is indeed true&#44; that 
we are told in another chapter &#40;viii) of the same book that God 
said : &#34; He would not again destroy the earth as He had done 
at that time&#44; because the desire of the heart of man is evil from 
his youth &#59;&#34; yet this does not gainsay the position we have 
assumed&#44; that man can do the right&#44; when the right has been 
explained to him &#59; his inclination may lead one way&#44; yet the 
knowledge of right will point out the other and better path &#59; 
and so he is enabled to do that only which is virtuous&#44; despite 
of his experiencing at the same time a secret yearning for the 
most monstrous crime. We read&#44; therefore&#44; in another place&#44; 
Deut. XXX. 15 &#8212; 19 : &#34;Behold I lay before thee this day the life 
and the good&#44; and the death and the evil &#8212; but choose life.&#34; 
We have accordingly incontestable proof to demonstrate&#44; that 
according to scriptural doctrines&#44; we have received from the 
Almighty all the requisites for making us virtuous&#44; and&#44; there&#8211; 
fore&#44; no excuse whatever can be drawn from the fountain of 
righteousness as an apology for a deviation from the precepts it 
contains. But as man generally endeavours to appear good in

SIN AND REPENTANCE. 77 

the eyes of others&#44; though in his own mind he must be con&#8211; 
vinced that he has no pretensions to virtue : he may perhaps 
seek to account for his sins by saying&#44; that his education had 
been defective&#44; and that having been long in the habit of doing 
the wrong before he was made conscious of its sinfuhiess&#44; he has 
become entirely unfitted for practising what he is told to be the 
duties of religion. To obviate this apology for vice&#44; and which 
is constantly urged by many as a complete justification of their 
remissness&#44; we should consider that though education must 
exercise a powerful influence over us : yet we are not thereby 
prevented from being taught better rules than those imbibed in 
infancy&#44; as we are growing older. If a man now finds that his 
education has been actually neglected&#44; he is bound to remedy 
the defect as far as the light of a better knowledge&#44; which by 
degrees dawns upon him&#44; will enable him to accomplish. Long 
and inveterate habits and tastes may indeed have become very 
strong &#59; yet it must not be forgotten that habit does not root 
out the germ of virtue&#44; which from its very nature is indestruc&#8211; 
tible &#59; for the impulse to righteousness will be felt even if the 
moral field be overgrown by noxious weeds&#59; and it is this 
germ which will sting the arrogant sinner in the height of his 
pride and glory &#59; pursue the blood&#8211;stained murderer into his 
hidden retreat&#44; and always admonish the most heedless trans&#8211; 
gressor that his conduct is unworthy of one created in the 
image of God. &#8212; If a man&#44; therefore&#44; should have been sunk in 
wickedness&#44; even during the whole course of his life&#44; he should 
still at no time despair of again being restored to goodness&#59; for 
the gates of mercy are never closed to him who wishes to enter 
them. And on this point. Holy Writ has shown him the 
means of commencing his reformation&#44; that is&#44; he should con&#8211; 
fess his sins before God with an humble and contrite heart &#59; 
for we read in Numbers&#44; chap. v. 7 : 15 
&#34; And they shall confess the sin which they have done.&#34; And 
this sincere confession of sins before the Creator is the first step 
towards amendment&#44; for when a man recounts his misdeeds 
with a sincerity&#44; such as he should exhibit before the Searcher 
of hearts&#44; he must at the same time detect the motives which 
induced him to sin&#44; and he will therefore be able to remedy 
the disease so soon as he knows the cause and the seat of it&#44;

just as the medical practitioner&#44; who can only successfully con&#8211; 
tend with the malady&#44; when he has discovered what organ is 
affected&#44; and to what extent his patient suffers. The next step 
necessary is to avoid as much as possible all temptations to sins 
in general&#44; and especially to the particular sin of which he may 
have been guilty. This avoiding of temptation or opportunity 
for sin has the effect of making crime less familiar&#44; and in con&#8211; 
sequence&#44; not so necessary to him as before&#44; and when he has 
studiously avoided for some time all approaches of wicked&#8211; 
ness&#44; he may be assured that he is already&#44; in a great degree&#44; 
reformed &#59; and when the same opportunities should&#44; by chance&#44; 
occur again&#44; it is probable&#44; that he will be able to overcome his 
inclinations&#44; and prove thus&#44; that a man may have been habit&#8211; 
uated to do wrong&#44; yet learn by care and watchfulness again to 
act correctly. If&#44; in the same manner&#44; we would but consider 
on every occasion when we are going to do any wrong&#44; be this 
an act of violence&#44; the infraction of a moral law or transgression 
of a religious duty&#44; that we could easily act otherwise&#44; if we but 
had the wish : not half the sin&#44; not half the mischief&#44; not half 
the strife and contention would exist &#59; and men then would be 
more virtuous and happy &#59; and we should&#44; in that case&#44; not be 
shocked by the everlasting causes of affront&#44; by which society&#44; 
domestic as well as political&#44; is agitated &#59; and good will and 
harmony would often occupy the place of hatred and revenge&#44; 
if we would but reflect before we make any angry replies&#44; 
whether the words of our antagonist had been intended to 
wound our feelings&#59; whether the insult be worth noticing&#44; or 
if it would not be better to overlook an injury actually received&#44; 
rather than incur the enmity of even a contemptible person&#44; 
who may have injured us. And let us reflect&#44; that if our 
neighbour has offended us&#44; that we also may have offended him &#59; 
and that all men need forgiveness of Heaven. 

If a man now finds that he has sinned&#44; and has an anxious 
desire to alter his conduct : he ought also to strive to mortify 
the vices which beset him. For instance&#44; if he should disco&#8211; 
ver himself to be avaricious&#44; and that this love of money has 
often interfered with his charitable feelings &#40;which every one 
possesses&#44; though often suppressed by the desire for wealth): he 
is bound to counteract his avarice on every suitable occasion &#59; 
he should by degrees endeavour to forget&#44; that money was once

his idol&#44; and that it is perishable like every thing in this life&#44; 
and if he cannot succeed in rendering himself very liberal&#44; he 
can yet attain being moderately charitable. &#8212; If a man has been 
in the habit of considering every unguarded word an insult&#44; 
and of resenting such an insult by angry replication or even 
personal attack : he must be extremely careful to shun every 
cause for quarrel&#44; and never to touch upon topics which could 
at all bring angry feelings into play&#44; either in himself or others. 
Perhaps he may yet be latently inclined to anger &#59; but when 
no evil effects have flowed from this anger for a considerable 
time&#44; it is probable&#44; that he may never again be betrayed into 
improper excesses&#44; although he may never be able to eradicate&#44; 
totally&#44; a certain fretfulness and irritability of temper. &#8212; But the 
highest degree of amendment is&#44; to eradicate the evil altogether&#44; 
and this end can only be attained by a great and incessant vigi&#8211; 
lance over every access of the vice to which a man may have 
been addicted &#59; and he should learn to prove his perfect amend&#8211; 
ment&#44; even when a convenient opportunity to sin offers&#44; and to 
convince thus every one&#44; that he has regained the mastery over 
his passions&#44; and that he is again what the Deity intended him 
to be&#44; when He spoke : &#34; Sin has its desire after thee&#44; but thou 
canst rule over it.&#34; In the same spirit does the Talmud advise : 
DEyx nmx3i mpn inixn p&#8211;is inixn &#34; True repentance must be able 
to withstand temptation at exactly the same time and place&#44; and 
with the same companions of former transgressions.&#34; 

As a further means of producing reformation&#44; it is necessary 
that a man should be more diligent in the exercise of those 
virtues&#44; which he may have practised&#44; whilst he was yet 
merged in sin&#44; so that by becoming more wedded to the good 
in general&#44; he may be weaned from the wrong to which he has 
been addicted &#59; for it is a well established principle in morals&#44; 
that one virtue is always the promoter of another&#44; as also one 
crime generally paves the Avay for the commission of more 
sins. &#8212; To this reason also may be referred the practice of do&#8211; 
ing penance&#44; by fasting&#44; praying&#44; and distributing of alms so 
universal among Israelites&#44; a practice highly laudable&#44; and the 
cause of much that is good. For when a man fasts from pure 
motives&#44; it must produce a diligent inquiry into his conduct&#44; 
more especially if the fasting be done in consequence of any

one wrong deed&#44; of which in particular he has been guilty. &#8212; 
Prayers when offered up with a contrite spirit&#44; will teach a man 
meekness&#44; and an humble resignation to the will of his offended 
God&#44; which should always accompany true repentance. &#8212; And 
the distribution of alms will&#44; besides affording relief to the 
indigent&#44; soften his heart&#44; and by making him feel for the wo 
of others&#44; teach him to feel the more strongly&#44; how much pity 
and mercy he requires of God&#44; how much grace he needs to 
have his sins forgiven. 

But a sinner may ask : &#34; Will my sins be forgiven &#63; is the 
grace of God extended to one so unworthy as I am&#63;&#34; Yes&#44; 
truly will he find grace who sincerely repents&#44; and if he but 
once commences with serious earnestness&#44; and with an immove&#8211; 
able purpose: he may rest assured&#44; that the work of reforma&#8211; 
tion will go on prosperously&#44; and that in recompense therefor&#44; 
the gracious Father will pardon his transgressions&#44; as far as this 
may be consistent with the rigorous and impartial justice with 
which He governs the world. 

Come&#44; therefore&#44; repentant sinner&#33; come and throw thyself 
at thy Father&#39;s feet. &#8212; He will receive thee&#44; although thy mis&#8211; 
deeds are great &#59; only do not tarry on account of the fearful 
struggle within thyself&#59; retard not thy return to good from fear 
of the taunts of thy former associates in sin &#59; and reflect&#44; that 
the mercy thou claimest&#44; can be the reward only of sincerity 
and perseverance &#59; and if thy wrongs be manifold&#44; endeavour 
to atone for them by a constant aiming after piety&#44; as much as 
lays in thy power. And fearest thou to meet thy God &#63; art 
thou ashamed to approach Him&#44; because thou hast been so long 
a stranger to his service&#44; and unseen within the threshhold of 
his house&#63; Then listen to what He has spoken through the 
mouth of his prophets&#44; where He swears by his holy essence&#44; 
that the repentant one shall be graciously received&#44; when he 
forsakes the evil of his ways. For thus did Ezekiel announce 
the will and purpose of the Merciful One &#40;chap&#44; xxxiii. 11&#44;):

SIN AND REPENTANCE. 81 

&#34; As sure as I live&#44; speaks the Lord God&#44; I have no pleasure in the death 
of the wicked&#44; but in the return of the wicked from his evil way that he 
may live&#59; return ye&#44; return ye&#44; from your evil ways&#44; and why will you die&#44; 
house of Israel.&#34; 

If then thou hast sinned&#44; mortal one &#59; if the weight of thy 
misdeeds are a burden to thee : come&#44; approach thy God&#44; con&#8211; 
fide in Him anew&#44; and let the assurance&#44; that thy return&#44; though 
late&#44; will be an acceptable offering to Him&#44; calm thy troubled 
spirit&#33; &#8212; Yes&#44; let every one here assembled on this day&#44; called 
emphatically &#34; the Sabbath of Repentance&#44;&#34; take a 
searching look into his past conduct&#44; and let him investigate in 
what points he may have transgressed&#44; in what way he may 
have offended his Maker&#44; and let him then prepare himself&#44; by 
purifying his heart&#44; for the coming of the Day of Atonement&#44; 
You&#44; who have wronged your neighbour by injuring him in 
his worldly possessions&#44; comply with the demand of the law&#44; 
and make restitution for that which has been wrongfully ob&#8211; 
tained. And you who have wronged your brother in his fair 
fame&#44; by robbing him of his honour&#44; or by wounding his feel&#8211; 
ings&#44; think not of asking forgiveness from above&#44; till you have 
solicited the pardon of your fellow man&#44; even if he be much 
your inferior&#44; nay&#44; the father of his son&#44; and the master of his 
servant&#44; and the teacher of his scholar. Let your hearts be 
pure&#44; let your hands be clean of wrong&#44; before you approach 
your heavenly Father on that day&#44; on which&#44; as He says&#44; 
atonement shall be extended for sins truly repented of. And 
fear not&#44; that you will not be favourably received&#44; for He has 
said : &#34;Throw off from you all your transgressions&#44; which you 
may have transgressed&#44; and make yourselves a new heart and 
a new spirit&#44; and why will you die&#44; house of Israel &#63; For 
I desire not the death of the guiltful one&#44; speaks the Lord God&#44; 
return and live.&#34; Let us then all unite to return to God&#44; let 
us all combine in brotherly love&#44; and let us forget the injuries 
which we have received from one another. In this holy house&#44; 
consecrated to the worship of the Everlasting One&#44; let us as&#8211; 
semble as one&#44; free from envy&#44; exempt from hatred &#59; and let it 
be our study to prove&#44; that tlie viarning voice of the Shophar 
has not sounded in vain&#44; that the fear of the Lord is truly seated 
in our hearts&#44; and that we have not disregarded the voice full

above : Return &#33; Return &#33; 

May justice and righteousness reign always among you&#44; and 
may virtue ever be the guide of all your actions &#59; so that you 
may depart hence&#44; as pure as you were at that moment&#44; when

happiness&#33; Amen. 

Tishry 5th.
Sept.22d.

Note. &#8212; The above discourse was intended to present a summary of the 
causes of sin&#44; and of the remedies to be applied&#44; when the heart is made con&#8211; 
scious of its wickedness. I am well aware&#44; that the subjects are too much 
crowded together&#44; but I preferred being guilty of too much brevity to divid&#8211; 
ing the subject. Besides&#44; there will be found in the sequel several other 
lectures&#44; where the causes&#44; effects&#44; and remedies of sin are more clearly 
pointed out. It was in compliance with an ancient custom&#44; to preach on the 
subject of Atonement on the Sabbath of Repentance&#44; that I wrote this and 
several subsequent sermons&#59; and I must here acknowledge&#44; that the arrange&#8211; 
ment I followed above&#44; was partly borrowed from a book : &#34; The Vintage of 
Ephraim&#44;&#34; by the celebrated Rabbi Ephraim Luntshetz. The book itself&#44; I 
have not seen for many years&#44; in fact&#44; not since I was a boy&#44; but the general 
idea of the learned preacher&#44; is still the ground&#8211; work of the above sermon&#44; 
and owes to it any merit it may possess.

through thy grace that prosperity&#44; both temporal and everlast&#8211;

thy unsearchable wisdom. But if Thou shouldst deem us de&#8211; 
serving of punishment&#44; then give us fortitude enough to bear 
thy paternal chastisement in meek resignation&#44; and lead us thus 
to thy service&#44; which is life. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

Holy Writ speaks emphatically : &#34; The heavens declare the 
glory of God&#44; and the expanse of aether proclaims the works 
of His hands&#33;&#34; And truly is this verified&#44; at all times and 
among all classes of men. The man of learning will&#44; at the 
deep hour of night&#44; when darkness has spread her dusky 
mantle over the surface of the earth&#44; forsake his couch&#44; and 
wander abroad&#44; to cast his eye upward to the star&#8211;clad heaven. 
Behold him standing for hours&#44; anxiously gazing as each con&#8211; 
stellation in succession crosses the meridian of his horizon &#8212; see 
how rapturously he investigates and searches the countless host 
which blazes down upon him &#8212; see how eagerly he notes every 
remarkable appearance&#44; how joyfully he marks every discovery 
he may happen to make : and then ask him what his feelings 
are at the moment &#59; and he will tell you&#44; that he is seized with 
a generous enthusiasm &#8212; that his heart is warmed by an admi&#8211; 
ration of the great Creator&#44; and that his mind is filled with the 
greatest awe of reverence for that infinitely good Being&#44; who 
maintaineth all by the potent will of his unending power&#33; &#8212; 
Again&#44; bend thy steps to a distant land&#44; where the savage yet 
roams free from the trammels of civilization&#44; where the rivers 
yet flow undisturbed by the prow of the merchant&#39;s ship&#44; where 
the primeval oaks stand untouched by the woodman&#39;s axe &#8212; and 
there stand by whilst the untutored child of the forest rises 
from his bed of moss&#44; at the early dawn of morning&#44; watch 
his eye how it kindles at the sight of the blushing red which 
paints the East before him&#44; how delighted he appears at seeing 
the sun elevate his bright disc over the flood of the broad 
stream&#44; on whose banks his little cabin can scarcely be per&#8211; 
ceived&#59; and mark the smile of satisfaction which lights up his 
countenance&#44; as he utters his humble prayer to the God&#44; who 
made all which gives him so much delight and happiness. &#8212; 
Yes&#44; go where we will&#44; let us be what we may&#44; the works of 
God&#44; all nature&#44; must admonish us&#44; that there is a Creator&#44; and 

    <pb n="84"/>

84 THE CREATION. 

that to Him&#44; we all owe our being. And it is this knowledge&#44; 
which we derive from comparing our own existence with that 
of every thing else around us&#44; that compels us to look for an 
object of worship&#44; one&#44; to whom we may address our desires&#44; 
and one of whom&#44; he being also superior to any obstacle which 
can by possibility oppose him&#44; we may expect deliverance in 
all our afflictions. &#8212; But&#44; as some persons may not&#44; at first sight&#44; 
be able to understand&#44; how the discovery of our being crea&#8211; 
tures compels us to be worshippers of a Supreme Being&#44; or 
how at all it can be demonstrated that there exists such a Power: 
it may&#44; perhaps&#44; be useful to set the subject in a clearly intelli&#8211; 
gible light&#44; by a few illustrations&#44; which must remove any 
thing like doubt from the mind of the thinker. &#8212; I&#44; an individual 
member of the human family&#44; find&#44; after repeated trials&#44; that I 
am unable to produce the substance called iron : I must come&#44; 
therefore&#44; to the conclusion&#44; that I cannot do it&#44; and conse&#8211; 
quently&#44; that I could have had no agency in its production. 
Still&#44; as I find this substance in existence&#44; and as I must be 
sure&#44; that the being who produced it&#44; has more power thus far&#44; 
than I have&#44; I must of necessity concede to him the superiority 
in this respect&#44; at least. And so I must proceed at a view of 
every thing&#44; animate or inanimate&#44; and I shall thus&#44; at every 
step of my investigation&#44; discover the superiority of the Author 
of all nature. &#8212; I find myself&#44; in trouble&#44; afflicted with diseases 
which I cannot remove&#59; I have sought in vain the assistance 
of creatures like myself&#44; and yet no relief has followed &#59; to 
whom then shall I turn&#44; but to Him who made me&#63; for must I 
not discover&#44; from the very nature of my being&#44; that He who 
made me and all I see&#44; can&#44; if He but will&#44; renew me also &#63; 
Should He&#44; who created every thing&#44; not be able to order 
things as best comports with his wisdom&#63; &#8212; Again&#44; if I take a 
view of life and the doings of man&#44; the conviction will strike 
me&#44; that&#44; to obtain the favour of a mortal like myself&#44; I am 
bound to act in a manner agreeable to his ideas of right&#44; or in 
other words&#44; I must try to make myself pleasing to the person 
I wish to propitiate&#44; in order to obtain his favour and assist&#8211; 
ance. If I am now compelled to acknowledge a Supreme 
Being&#59; if every thing admonishes me&#44; that a Power actually 
does exist&#44; whose sway extends over every object which this 

    <pb n="85"/>

THE CREATION. 85 

vast structure contains &#59; if I am assured&#44; that under whatever 
affliction I may be&#44; He is able and willing to extricate me &#59; if I 
am led to believe&#44; that it is my duty to endeavour to obtain the 
favour of this great Being by deeds of mine&#59; if I am again 
convinced that to act otherwise would be injurious to me : it 
becomes evidently my duty&#44; which at the same time corre&#8211; 
sponds with my interest&#44; to seek the favour of the Supreme&#44; by 
the doing of whatever He may call good and right&#44; and by 
avoiding all which He may declare bad and wrong. &#8212; If we&#44; 
according to this view&#44; always regard our relative station to 
the Deity&#44; we must necessarily be inclined to render Him the 
requisite homage&#44; whatever this homage may be &#59; and as a ne&#8211; 
cessary consequence it follows&#44; that we are bound to endeavour 
to acquire a sure knowledge of all the duties which we are to 
practise&#44; and of all the wrongs which we are to avoid in obe&#8211; 
dience to the will of our Maker. &#8212; As religion now&#44; or more 
properly speaking&#44; a fulfilment of duties towards God&#44; is by 
the disposition of man quite natural to him&#44; it has been ob&#8211; 
served&#44; that the members of the human family have at all times 
paid adoration to a Supreme Being&#44; or to something which they 
conceived superior: the first is true worship&#59; the second&#44; super&#8211; 
stition &#59; still&#44; even this is founded upon the dependence which 
man feels on a higher power&#44; only overshaded and weakened 
by ignorance&#44; or the bad example of others. &#8212; Let us now 
briefly trace the order of various religious establishments&#44; as 
we find them recorded or hinted at in the Bible&#44; till we arrive 
at the promulgation of the heavenly code&#44; by which it pleased 
Almighty God to organize Israel as his peculiar people. I 
shall not detain you long&#44; brethren&#44; but only take a rapid view 
of this interesting record&#44; to point out to you the peculiar obli&#8211; 
gation you&#44; as Israelites&#44; are under to the Disposer of human 
events&#44; for his great and signal goodness&#44; in first rcaiiing you 
to his service&#44; and next in perpetuating this service so mira&#8211; 
culously among you. &#8212; We read in this day&#39;s weekly portion&#44; 
the history of the CREATION&#44; which begins in the following 
words : 

VOL. I. 8 

    <pb n="86"/>

86 THE CREATION. 

&#34; In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth 
was without form and void&#44; and darkness was upon the face of the deep&#44; and 
the spirit of God was moving over the face of the water &#59; and God said&#44; Let 
there be light&#44; and there was light.&#34; Gen. i. 1&#8211;3&#44; 

In this passage the Pentateuch tells us&#44; that&#44; when it pleased 
the Almighty Power to call beings of various kinds into exist&#8211; 
ence&#44; nothing was in being &#59; but He&#44; the Almighty&#44; reigned alone 
in glory&#44; in the words of the beautiful hymn&#44;&#42; which we have 
just now sung : &#34; Lord of the universe&#44; who didst reign before 
any creature was created &#59; and at the time that all&#44; according 
to thy will&#44; was made&#44; then was thy name proclaimed king &#59; 
and after all shall have ceased to exist. Thou wilt&#44; Tremen&#8211; 
dous One&#44; reign alone. For Thou wert. Thou art&#44; and Thou 
wilt ever be in glory &#59; and Thou art One&#44; and there is no 
second to be associated with Thee in the supreme rule &#59; since 
Thou art without beginning and without ending&#44; and thine is 
the almight and the government.&#34; Then the word went forth 
from before Him&#44; and matter was made from naught &#59; and sub&#8211; 
stances&#44; antagonizing in their nature&#44; were mingled&#44; and fire 
and water were joined into one body&#44; and air and earth were 
mixed&#44; and the impenetrable gloom of rayless night hung over 
this incipient creation. &#8212; But the creative spirit of God was 
abroad&#44; it waved along the chaotic mass&#44; and soon was felt the 
effect of the will of the Lord&#44; when He spoke : &#34;Let there be 
light&#44;&#34; for then&#44; instantaneously&#44; &#34; there was light.&#34; Here&#44; 
in but four words of the original Scriptures&#44; we are pre&#8211; 
sented with the most vivid picture imaginable of the Creator&#39;s 
power &#59; and no laboured description&#44; no matter how elegant&#44; 
could hSve presented to our mind any thing half so impressive 
and striking. Allow me&#44; brethren&#44; to draw in this place your 
attention to the sublimity&#44; perspicuity&#44; and elegance of the 
scriptural language&#59; you are familiar with the Bible from your 
infancy&#44; it is perhaps the first volume that was placed in your

of the service&#44; &#8212; at first after the concluding hymn&#44; latterly before.

hands by your attentive parents &#59; and as you have thus early 
skimmed over its contents&#44; you perchance lose&#44; alas&#44; too soon &#33; 
all knowledge of the vast treasures it contains &#59; you peradven&#8211; 
ture do not think&#44; that a book so common and universal as the 
Bible can afford any instruction to the scholar and the enlight&#8211; 
ened man. But here lies the error &#59; for that which can teach 
so much that is useful to the ignorant&#44; iniisf contain&#44; and does 
contain too&#44; a vast fund for the instruction of&#44; and reflection 
for&#44; the most learned &#59; and&#44; in truth&#44; where do you find so true 
a portraiture of human life &#63; where so true a history of man &#63; 
where such noble lessons for his government &#63; where that im&#8211; 
partiality and candour which adorn pre&#8211;eminently the pages of 
the Bible &#63; where that elegance&#44; and brevity&#44; and nervousness 
of diction&#44; which have ever been the source of delight and in&#8211; 
struction to us&#44; and which address themselves so much to the 
heart and the judgment of every inquirer&#63; Nowhere else&#44; 
but in that precious book&#44; which contains the sentence : &#34; And 
God said&#44; let there be light and there was light.&#34; Darkness&#44; 
as said already&#44; had hitherto covered the creation&#44; but the first 
step towards the beautiful organization which now delights us 
every where was the creation of light &#59; and it went out from 
Him&#44; with whom the unquenchable light dwells&#44; and it spread 
its beneficent rays over all nature&#44; and the creation rejoiced&#44; and 
the chaos was gladdened at its dawn&#44; and gradually every ob&#8211; 
ject assumed the place assigned to it by the Author of all&#44; and 
the luminaries were fixed in the immeasurable space&#44; each in 
its respective orbit&#44; and the waves of the ocean rolled round 
the earth&#44; and the herbs and trees covered the globe&#44; and the 
fish sported in their watery element&#44; and the birds warbled in 
the air&#44; and the beasts of the land grazed upon luxuriant mea&#8211; 
dows&#44; and every being seemed happy as it came in perfection 
from the hands of our God. &#8212; To crown his works&#44; God made 
man&#44; at the last&#44; from the clay of the earth&#44; and breathed into 
him the spirit of life&#44; and gave him understanding and know&#8211; 
ledge&#44; and gifted him more than any other creature on earth 
with intelligence and beauty&#44; and assigned him a companion in 
every respect suited to his wants &#59; and to these two creatures 
so greatly endowed. He gave the dominion over every thing 
found on earth. &#8212; Man was&#44; as we are told in the account trans&#8211;

mitted to us&#44; created with a twofold disposition&#44; one the incli&#8211; 
nation to good&#44; the second the inclination to evil &#59; or&#44; to speak 
more correctly&#44; he had the faculty given him&#44; of choosing be&#8211; 
tween doing&#44; and omitting any act which might come in his 
way&#44; not being compelled by any supernatural influence to do&#44; 
nor withheld by the same means from doing whatever might 
suit his fancy or convenience. This being so created and con&#8211; 
stituted was placed in a delightful spot&#44; where every thing 
necessary for his preservation was in abundance supplied&#44; and 
he was told&#44; that he might freely eat of the fruit of every tree 
in this spot&#44; or garden as it is called&#44; with the exception of one 
tree&#44; called the tree of knowledge of good and evil&#44; which 
alone was forbidden to him&#59; at the same time also&#44; he was told&#44; 
that death should be the consequence&#44; as a punishment for the 
transgression of this&#44; the first and only commandment of the 
Deity. &#8212; You will observe&#44; brethren&#44; that no force was laid 
upon man&#39;s inclination&#44; he was left at liberty to act as he might 
choose&#59; but with the transgression&#44; he was also to take the 
consequence. And so then it happened&#44; that both the wife and 
man yielded to their inclination&#44; and ate of that which had 
been prohibited to them by their God. Their regret now came 
too late &#59; and the merciful Avenger soon told them of their 
doom&#44; that henceforth sorrow and labour should be their por&#8211; 
tion&#44; instead of the uninterrupted enjoyment which had been 
theirs at their first creation&#44; and the separation of the soul from 
the body was at length to ensue&#44; when they had toiled their 
appointed time on earth. &#8212; Yet&#44; even in this altered state&#44; they 
had pointed out to them the way to happiness &#59; for the Almighty 
did not cast them off utterly&#44; but immediately provided them 
with necessaries suited to their altered state&#44; and imbued their 
minds with firmness to oppose resignation to labour&#44; and per&#8211; 
severance to difficulty&#59; and He also taught them&#44; that by an 
humble repentance&#44; his favour might at all times be obtained&#44; 
though the transgressions had been great. Thus&#44; it came to 
pass&#44; that man was sent forth from Eden&#44; to regain by toil and 
the practice of virtue the favour of God which he had for&#8211; 
feited&#44; by neglecting the only precept he had received from his 
Maker. 

Soon after this&#44; the mortal progeny of Adam increased on

earth&#44; but they wilfully neglected to propitiate the favour of 
their heavenly Father&#44; and&#44; regardless of the restraints his 
ordinances had laid on their passions&#44; they indulged in the 
grossest dissipation&#44; and filled the earth with unnatural deeds 
of violence. God looked down with displeasure upon the mis&#8211; 
deeds of his creatures&#44; and seeing them deserving of punish&#8211; 
ment. He resolved to let justice take its course &#59; and it appeared&#44; 
as though He had changed his policy to mankind&#44; for instead of 
causing them to prosper and multiply exceedingly. He now de&#8211; 
termined to exterminate the race&#44; that defyingly had said 
to Him their God : &#34; Depart thou from us &#33;&#34; But even in that 
degenerate age&#44; there were those who had not departed from 
the path of righteousness&#44; those who had clung unto God&#44; 
when all others went astray&#59; and they were&#44; therefore&#44; singled 
out for preservation&#44; when all the rest were swept away&#44; when 
the devouring flood buried all beneath the foaming surge&#44; which 
for an entire year covered the surface of the earth like one 
vast&#44; uninterrupted&#44; limitless ocean. The rain poured down 
in torrents for forty days and forty nights&#44; the water seemed to 
rise&#44; and in fact was rising out of the bowels of the earth &#59; and 
every living thing on the dry land was carried off&#44; and every 
vestige of man&#39;s ingenuity was deluged&#44; and only Noah&#44; and 
those with him in the ark&#44; were preserved amidst this general 
ruin. &#8212; Again the family of man multiplied&#44; and they began 
gradually to spread over the face of the earth. They&#44; however&#44; 
soon forgot&#44; or brought themselves to forget&#44; the frightful 
catastrophe&#44; the efiects of which are to this very day visible 
all over the globe&#44; well assured by the promise of God&#44; that 
the like calamity should never happen again. They lived at 
the time&#44; of which we are speaking&#44; in the plain of Shinar&#44; 
and they spoke all one language and one dialect&#44; for as yet di&#8211; 
vision had not corrupted the tongue of the sons of Noah. But 
they had been told by the divine decree : &#34; Be fruitful and 
multiply&#44; and fill the earth and subdue it &#59;&#34; this they wanted 
to prevent&#44; they wished not to spread over the earth in detach&#8211; 
ed nations &#59; they&#44; therefore&#44; built themselves a tower and a 
city&#44; vainly imagining&#44; that by so doing they might have a 
security&#44; that they should never be separated. But God&#44; dis&#8211; 
pleased at their opposition to his decree&#44; caused it to happen&#44;

that all of a sudden they spoke different languages&#44; so that one 
could not understand the speech of the other&#44; and they had to 
cease from their building&#44; and were henceforward scattered 
over the earth. Thus&#44; mankind began to be divided into fami&#8211; 
lies&#44; and. each portion chose a government&#44; such as pleased them 
best&#59; and by degrees the divisions between nations became more 
strongly marked&#44; the greater the distances that divided them&#44; and 
the more varied their respective languages were. But they too 
soon forgot the punishment they had suffered for their rebellion 
against God&#44; and they neglected entirely the precepts they had 
received from Him. They&#44; indeed&#44; felt the want of a worship&#44; 
and of a being to be worshipped &#59; but the simple truth of one 
universal Gorfdid not suit the views of their tyrannical rulers&#44; 
for then these too would have been obliged publicly to acknow&#8211; 
ledge their dependance upon the power of the universal Sove&#8211; 
reign of all things. They&#44; therefore&#44; endeavoured to lead the 
minds of the community astray from the true God&#44; and by 
their emissaries and pretended wonder&#8211;workers made them be&#8211; 
lieve that other things&#44; those visible to the eyes&#44; had also an 
inherent power of doing as they liked&#44; unchecked by a supe&#8211; 
rior agency&#44; and they erected altars to the sun&#44; and moon&#44; and 
the whole host of heaven&#44; and made images to represent the 
deity&#44; and bowed down before idols of abomination&#44; and be&#8211; 
came daily and hourly more estranged from the worship of God&#59; 
till at length they acknowledged mere men as gods&#44; nay more&#44; 
they learnt to worship beasts&#44; some even the most loathsome 
reptiles&#44; and others lastly inanimate substances&#44; to which they 
had once foolishly ascribed divine powers. To perpetuate these 
superstitious usages a privileged class was instituted&#44; to the 
members of which pretended secrets were intrusted&#44; and who 
were exempt from public burdens and entirely separated from 
the rest of their countrymen. They feigned to prognosticate 
future events by the course of planets&#44; by the appearance 
of the clouds&#44; and even by the flight of birds&#44; and the inspec&#8211; 
tion of the entrails of slaughtei&#39;ed beasts &#59; and the ravings of a 
maniac&#44; or of a designing impostor&#44; were regarded as the in&#8211; 
fallible decree of the God&#44; before whom truth alone can stand. 
They also invented a false account of the origin of the world&#44;

tween God and man&#44; they withdrew both the ignorant and the 
learned from the path of righteousness&#44; till at last the frightful 
spectacle of human sacrifice was every where&#42; exhibited&#44; and 
men were rendered infatuated enough to believe&#44; that human 
blood was the most acceptable offering to appease the gods. &#8212; 
This was&#44; indeed&#44; a dreadful&#44; a deplorable state of morals : 
and this horrible infatuation had well nigh seized the minds of 
all mankind&#44; were it not that there arose a man in the midst of 
the land where idolatry had assumed the loftiest aspect&#44; and 
where its very grandeur was well calculated to benighten the 
strongest understanding. It is highly probable&#44; that the Chal&#8211; 
deans had made great progress in the knowledge of the heavens&#44; 
and that the priests were the greatest astronomers of those days&#59; 
and they had thus the power of enslaving the public mind by 
foretelling those things&#44; which&#44; as they well knew from their 
calculations&#44; were to happen in the due course of nature. And 
yet&#44; among these men it was&#44; where our great ancestor lighted 
for the first time the lamp of the truest and best of sciences &#8212; 
the knowledge of God. &#8212; Yes&#44; brethren&#44; it was in the land of 
Chaldea&#44; that Abram&#44; as he was first named&#44; stepped boldly 
forth&#44; avowing his acknowledgment of the God of heaven and 
earth alone&#44; and here he withstood &#40;as we are told by our tra&#8211; 
ditions) the trial of the greatest personal dangers. For it was 
natural enough&#44; that the tyrants and deceivers of his native 
land should fear a man whose doctrines might well have hurled 
them from their thrones&#44; when the people had been once con&#8211; 
vinced that their rulers were of the same origin with them&#8211; 
&#39;selves&#59; for you must know&#44; that many of these wicked despots 
had asserted that they were descended from deified beings&#33; 
But our God was Abram&#39;s protection&#44; and He caused him to 
escape unscathed from the fiery furnace&#44; and bid him to go 
forth from his native soil&#44; to spread the knowledge of the Lord 
in other and more distant countries. And much had Abram to 
suffer whilst on this mission&#44; but all was esteemed light by him. 
who bore his elevation with such great meekness&#44; who only 
laboured in the holiest of causes &#59; and&#44; therefore&#44; his virtue was 

&#42; Every where&#33; Yes&#44; gentle reader&#44; even among the Grecians and Ro&#8211; 
mans&#59; witness the sacrifice of Ephigenia&#44; and of the consul Decius&#44; as late 
as after the year 400 of the building of Rome.

recorded on high&#44; and his sufferings were to be recompensed 
by much happiness &#59; &#8212; his name was changed to Abraham&#44; sig&#8211; 
nifying that he should be the father of a multitude of nations&#44; 
and he was blessed with a son at the age of a hundred years&#44; 
and he sunk into the grave&#44; after a long life of usefulness and 
activity. It was thus&#44; that the true knowledge of God ever 
found its defenders in times of the grossest darkness and super&#8211; 
stition&#44; and it therefore came to pass&#44; that the descendants of 
this patriarch were singled out as the favoured people of God&#44; 
on account of the virtue of their ancestors&#44; and they were pre&#8211; 
pared by a long period of suffering for the glorious epoch&#44; when 
they were made the depositary of God&#39;s will. &#8212; In the mean 
time the world advanced in refinement &#59; but the worship which 
was pleasing to the Almighty was preserved&#44; in all likelihood&#44; 
among but few&#44; except the descendants of the patriarchs&#44; and 
these were labouring in hopeless servitude for cruel masters&#44; in 
whose land they had at first been received as welcome guests. 
But when the appointed hour had arrived&#44; they were led forth&#44; 
to be freed in body and disenthralled in soul&#44; into the wilder&#8211; 
ness&#44; under the guidance of the great and pious leader&#44; Moses&#44; 
the son of Amram&#44; and at the foot of yon Sinai&#44; in the land of 
Arabia&#44; they were informed of the will of God&#44; and certified&#44; 
that they could gain his favour by an obedience to his laws 
only. &#8212; And did God teach them his law with an appeal to 
their feelings&#44; or by rousing their fears&#63; No&#44; for He announc&#8211; 
ed himself simply : &#34; I am the everlasting One thy God&#44;&#34; thus 
pointing out to them briefly their relation to Him&#44; &#8212; that they 
were creatures&#44; and He the Creator &#59; and in this comprehensive 
revelation they were informed&#44; that they owed their life&#44; their 
freedom&#44; in fact all they could then&#44; or at any other time&#44; call 
their own&#44; to the bounty of Him who addressed them &#59; and the 
conviction was in this way&#44; naturally brought to their minds&#44; 
that if they wished to prosper&#44; they must direct their ideas&#44; 
their hopes and their worship to Him&#44; who had created them 
all&#44; and in whose power were their lives and happiness. 

In this light then should the history of the creation be re&#8211; 
garded&#44; as an exposition of our relation to God &#59; and if we 
reflect well on this subject &#59; if we always view ourselves as 
creatures&#44; dependent upon the bounty of the Creator&#59; if on every

occasion we search for truth where alone it can be found &#8212; in 
the book which contains the record of the Abnighty&#39;s will &#59; &#8212; 
if we view with becoming reverence the works of His hands : 
we must be filled with adoration&#44; with fear&#44; with awe for the 
One&#44; who&#44; though so infinitely great&#44; regards us with so much 
love&#44; with so much kindness. But&#44; brethren&#44; let the presump&#8211; 
tuous thought never enter into your inquiries : &#34; What is God&#63; 
why did He make the world&#63;&#34; for these and similar questions 
must always remain concealed from you &#59; since&#44; if even you 
impiously deny all moral responsibility to the One Supreme&#44; 
you are not in the slightest degree nearer the solution of the 
mysteries of creation. Rather adopt the advice contained in the 
following&#44;&#42; from one of our gifted poets&#44; who says : &#34; And 
consider who thou art&#44; and whence thy origin&#44; and who it is that 
framed thee&#44; and who gave thee wisdom&#44; and whose power 
moveth thee &#59; and look at the mighty works of God&#44; and 
wake thy soul to action &#59; search His works&#59; but towards Him&#44; 
presume not to stretch out thy hand &#59; for here thou wouldst 
ever search in what is hidden and concealed from thee.&#34; &#8212; And 
truly&#44; this humble searching&#44; this pious enquiry after attainable 
truths&#44; must improve the heart&#44; and will assuredly render us 
worthy of being made children of everlasting happiness&#44; when 
dwelling in the more immediate presence of God&#44; when freed 
from all earthly cares&#44; when elevated above all mortal desires&#44;
we shall be permitted to roam from region to region of wisdom 
and understanding&#44; and be rewarded with a more extended 
sphere of knowledge&#44; for having&#44; whilst labouring in the vale 
of tears&#44; sacrificed our desires and yielded our inclinations to 
the service of Him&#44; who spoke and the world sprung into 
existence &#33; 

May this be our lot and the portion of all Israel &#33; Amen.

DISCOURSE X. 

PIOUS REFLECTIONS. 

To the God&#44; who sits enthroned in glory&#44; be praise and ado&#8211; 
ration &#33; Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

Since the cares of life are so various&#44; and since so many oc&#8211; 
currences tend daily to chain our exclusive attention almost&#44; 
withdrawing thereby our ideas from the pursuit of wisdom and &#39; 
the observance of religious duties: it becomes necessary for us 
to adopt&#44; if possible&#44; some infallible guides&#44; which may lead us 
back to the path we should go&#44; whenever we find ourselves on 
the point of being withdrawn into devious ways. It is known 
to you all&#44; how great the force of example is &#59; what then is to 
deter us from following the evil which others around us prac&#8211; 
tise &#63; &#8212; Again&#44; we hourly see&#44; how often men are misled by 
an apparent necessity&#59; what shall we oppose to Such a circum&#8211; 
stance&#44; when we ourselves are tempted&#63; &#8212; And&#44; lastly&#44; many a 
one has been outwardly good&#44; till an opportunity for sin pre&#8211; &#42; 
sented itself in alluring colours &#59; how shall we manage to avoid 
falling into the snare&#44; which such an opportunity may lay for 
our unsteady feet&#63; 

It must be evident to the reflecting mind&#44; that unless a per&#8211; 
son thinks correctly &#59; it will be almost impossible for him to 
act correctly&#44; since actions are&#44; for the most part&#44; the offspring 
of preconceived thoughts&#44; and since but rarely any thing is 
done from what is commonly called the impulse of the mo&#8211; 
ment &#59; for even where a rash deed is committed&#44; it will be found&#44; 
upon investigation&#44; to proceed from a train of ideas a long 
while indulged in&#44; or it will be in accordance with the person&#39;s 
general conduct. So a man&#44; who commits murder in a violent 
fit of anger&#44; will doubtlessly have been in the habit of indulg&#8211; 
ing in angry outbreaks of passion &#59; and one&#44; who habitually

gives the reins to his evil desires&#44; will also be found obeying 
this impulse whenever he can. In the same manner&#44; virtue 
will be found to be&#44; for the most part&#44; the child of a good train 
of thinking&#59; and we therefore say of one man&#44; that he acts 
from good principles&#44; and of another&#44; that his principles &#40;or 
customary motives of action) are bad. &#8212; The question now 
arises: &#34;By what process are we to bring our mind to a vir&#8211; 
tuous mode of thinking&#44; and by what means are we to guard 
ourselves against being allured by false ideas of right and 
wrong&#63;&#34; &#8212; You must also observe&#44; brethren&#44; that we are very 
often placed in situations&#44; where the motives for choosing be&#8211; 
tween good and evil are very nearly balanced&#44; if we take merely 
a superficial view of the case &#59; and it requires the exercise of a 
great degree of fortitude and forbearance&#44; to remain firm in the 
practice of the right&#44; especially if it should happen&#44; that the 
greater portion of those around us&#44; do the wrong or neglect the 
good. &#8212; With these views premised&#44; let us proceed to the fol&#8211; 
lowing moral aphorism&#44; from the third chapter of the Proverbs 
of the Fathers : 

&#34; Akabia the son of Mahalalel said : Consider well three things&#44; and thou 
wilt not be led into the power of sin&#59; reflect on thy origin&#44; whither thou art 
going&#44; and before whom thou must once render an account of thy actions. 
Thou comest from an obscure origin &#59; thou goest to a place of dust&#44; worms&#44; 
and corruption&#59; and thou must be at length judged by&#44; and render an account 
of thy doings before the King of the mightiest kings&#44; the Holy One&#44; to 
whom be praise.&#34; 

&#44; The words of this wise moralist convey to us the guide 
which is to lead us in every transaction of life&#44; and which&#44; if 
properly followed&#44; will always preserve us from the power ol 
sin. In a former discourse&#44; we have defined sin to be a depar&#8211;

ture from the commandments of God&#44; superinduced by prefer&#8211; 
ring to obey the inclination to evil which is within us. To 
avoid&#44; therefore&#44; obeying the evil impulse&#44; we are advised by 
our wise men&#44; to reflect well upon our origin&#44; our end&#44; and our 
ultimate destination&#44; inasmuch as we are destined to appear in 
judgment&#44; before the dread and impartial Judge&#44; who notices all 
our actions. &#8212; &#34;Thou camest&#44;&#34; says Akabia&#44; &#34; from an humble 
origin &#59;&#34; reflect&#44; son of man&#44; what thy beginning was&#44; look 
back upon the period of thy birth&#44; and consider what was 
then thy strength. Thou sprangest into existence a weak 
and tender infant&#44; no speech was thine to express thy wants&#44; 
and only the tears of infantile anguish proclaimed to thy nurses 
that thou wast in pain&#59; and thou wast glad&#44; when thy press&#8211; 
ing wants were satisfied&#44; and thy penetration was not yet suf&#8211; 
ficiently developed to look forward to the coming day. &#8212; 
Was this a state at all calculated to fill thy mind with pride &#63; 
what wouldst thou have been if left to thyself &#63; what was thy 
strength able to effect &#63; wouldst thou have been capable to provide 
thyself with food and to ward off&#34; the pain caused by exposure to 
heat&#44; to cold&#44; to changes of climate and seasons &#63; Thou now pos&#8211; 
sessest the faculty to express thy wishes and thoughts by articu&#8211; 
late words &#59; but say&#44; wouldst thou have been enabled to do so&#44; if 
thy mother and thy friends had not early taught thee &#63; If thou 
hadst been left to thy own care&#44; been thrown back upon thy 
own resources&#44; can it be possible that knowledge too would 
have been thine&#44; that science would have had charms for thee &#63; 
No&#44; no&#44; vain man&#44; thou wouldst have perished for want&#44; were 
it not that the guardians of thy infancy had watched over thee&#44; 
and provided&#44; perhaps with the sweat of their brow&#44; for thy 
many wants &#59; to them thou art indebted&#44; that thou canst speak&#44; 
that thou art delighted with knowledge&#44; that thou art elevated 
above the brute animal&#44; which now obeys thy nod. And ye&#39;t 
thou boastest &#63; and yet thou lookest down with scorn upon the 
ignorance of the untutored savage &#63; and yet thou art vain of 
thy acquirements&#63; &#8212; Rather it would be seemly&#44; that thou 
shouldst be humble and meek to regard those with pity that 
are not so highly favoured &#59; and thou oughtest to consider that 
thy origin is like theirs&#44; that thou too art man&#44; subject to the 
same rule&#44; and living by the favour of the same God&#44; &#8212; the 

    <pb n="97"/>

PIOUS REFLECTIONS. 97 

God&#44; from whom all is derived&#44; &#8212; the God&#44; who provideth and 
careth for all and every one of his creatures. If then&#44; mortal 
one&#44; thy heart should feel elated with pride&#44; if thou seest thy&#8211; 
self blest with wisdom and knowledge&#44; if thou art possessed 
of wealth and honour : thou shouldst consider&#44; that the creature 
ought not to be proud before the Creator&#44; and that thy wisdom&#44; 
thy riches&#44; and thy honours&#44; are the gifts of the Almighty. 
If thus thou thinkest&#44; thou wilt walk in humble meekness before 
the Lord&#44; thou wilt love all those that are like thee of the same 
humble beginning&#44; destined for the same glorious end &#59; and 
thou wilt then gladly obey his will&#44; and shun the evil which 
He hates : and viewing thy existence in this state as a time of 
trial and probation&#44; thou wilt regard all earthly blessings as 
valuable only if tending to promote the permanent good &#59; and 
thou wilt say with the Psalmist : &#34; I am but a pilgrim before 
Thee&#44; a stranger like all my fathers &#33;&#34; 

Says the moralist&#44; in continuation of his admonition : 
&#34; Thou goest to a place of dust&#44; worms&#44; and corruption.&#34; Man&#44; 
in the pursuit of his occupations&#44; seems to act as though he were 
fixed in this life for ever. His plans are extensive&#44; he calcu&#8211; 
lates on making his power and his influence felt far and near&#44; 
and lives &#8212; forgetful of the duties of religion&#44; regardless of the 
rights of his fellow&#8211;men&#44; striving only to gratify his desires&#44; 
and intent on increasing his worldly stores. &#8212; To such a one 
the wise man says : &#34; Regard whither thou art going&#44; to a 
place of dust&#44; worms&#44; and corruption.&#34; Yes&#44; come hither&#44; 
wicked one&#44; &#8212; come&#44; gaze upon this corrupted remnant of hu&#8211; 
manity &#59; nay&#44; do not avert thy eyes&#44; but gaze steadfastly &#59; this 
skeleton&#44; nearly bereft of flesh&#44; was once a man like thyself &#59; 
he was wise&#44; and thousands listened to his counsel &#59; he was 
great&#44; and every one feared his wrath &#59; he but spoke&#44; and his 
commands were obeyed &#59; princes waited in his out&#8211;courts&#44; and 
nations expected with anxiety the decisions of his will &#59; but he 
at length sickened&#44; and his soul was fain to leave his diseased 
body &#59; he was lowered into the grave&#44; his flesh was given to 
corruption&#44; and now&#44; the very worms disdain to dwell any 
longer in their palace&#44; where they have rioted so long. Nay&#44; 
more&#44; all that he built on earth has been pulled down&#44; his 
wisdom has barely left a trace behind&#44; and strangers now enjoy

all he had amassed with so much care and with so much labour. 
And yet thou only thinkest of gratifying thy desires &#63; thou 
heedest not the coming day&#44; when the sight of thy eyes will 
depart&#44; when the hearing of thy ears will vanish&#44; and when thy 
proud heart will cease to beat &#63; But say &#8212; was it for this that 
life was given thee &#8212; wast thou for this purpose sent on earth &#8212; 
merely to live in luxury to gratify base desires&#44; and to be 
careless of the welfare of thy soul &#63; Rather let the coming 
day of thy dissolution act as a constant warning to thee&#44; that 
thou art frail and mortal &#59; reflect that nothing of all thy amassed 
wealth will accompany thee to the grave&#44; that not one of the 
indulgencies of pleasure will benefit thee aught at thy departure&#44; 
and that only the virtues which thou hast made thy own&#44; that 
only the good deeds which thou hast done&#44; will make thy rest 
easy and thy after existence glorious. And since &#34; thou art 
dust&#44; and to dust thou must return&#44;&#34; it is thy duty to shun 
every evil which may endeavour to allure thee &#59; and if the 
struggle be great&#44; if thou see all thy associates forsake the way 
of good : thou shouldst consider&#44; that the struggle once past&#44; 
the difficulties once overcome&#44; the satisfaction thou wilt feel 
must be infinitely greater than the gratification of the passions 
could possibly have yielded. 

As a last remedy against the approach of sin&#44; we are advised 
to reflect : &#34; Before whom we are to be judged&#44; and who it is 
before whom we are to render an account of all our actions.&#34; 
Man in the hurry of busy life may imagine that his deeds will 
pass unnoticed &#59; nay&#44; he may be convinced&#44; that no human eye 
is witness to his proposed conduct&#44; and he may suppose&#44; that 
he has taken all the means necessary to escape detection&#59; he 
may therefore presume perhaps to do wrong&#44; fancying himself 
secured against all punishment. But though man&#39;s vigilance 
may thus be eluded&#44; let the sinner reflect&#44; that there is an eye 
above which is always open &#59; that there is a ivatchfulness&#44; 
and a Providence which never slumber : that there is a 
superintending Being who never forgets &#59; and then let him 
deem himself screened against evil&#44; let him imagine his mis&#8211; 
deeds buried in oblivion. Hah &#33; should God not see&#44; though 
man be deceived &#63; is God not able to mete out punishment&#44; 
though human power be eluded &#63; And grant&#44; even&#44; that

when thy body is buried in its kindred earth&#44; when thy bones 
have been surrendered to corruption&#44; then thy soul&#44; thy spirit&#44; 
thyself will be compelled to appear before the judgment throne 
of thy Maker&#44; to answer for deeds done in the flesh&#44; whilst thou 
wast&#44; as man&#44; empowered to spend thy days in the service of 
thy God&#44; and in acts of benevolence towards thy fellow&#8211;men. 
And yet thou canst glory in thy iniquity &#63; and yet thou retain&#8211; 
est the wrongfully acquired substance of the orphan and the 
widow in thy possession &#63; How canst thou dare to think of 
thus meeting the impartial Judge &#63; what are thy good deeds in 
comparison with thy sins &#63; will not the noble time so misspent&#44; 
the valuable opportunities for ennobling the mind so neglected&#44; 
the injury done to the helpless that confided in thy honesty&#44;

luded worm &#33; fearest thou not the Creator &#8212; art thou heedless 
of incurring his just indignation &#8212; weenest thou that He is not 
potent to punish &#63; &#8212; then listen to the dreadful storm &#8212; which 
is but the breath of his nostrils &#59; and hearken to the loud peal&#8211;

hold the devouring flame of the bright lightning&#44; which is only 
the flash of his eye &#33; &#8212; and then consider&#44; that He is thy Author&#44; 
and thy Father&#44; and only desirous of thy welfare&#44; but that He 
is also thy Judge&#44; that from Him nothing is hidden&#44; by Him 
nothing is forgotten&#44; and that to Him thou art at length com&#8211; 
pelled to return&#44; though thou shouldst live a thousand years. 
And must thou not trem.ble at thy own ingratitude&#44; be amazed 
at thy effrontery&#44; and cower in the very dust for shame at thy 
presumption&#44; in disregarding the warning of thy everlasting 
Benefactor&#44; that would gladly render thee happy and blessed

THE FESTIVAL OF HANUCKAH. 

Almighty Father&#44; who watchest with unbounded solici&#8211; 
tude over the welfare of thy creatures&#44; and who hast so often 
held out thy protecting arm over thy people Israel &#59; save us 
now&#44; protect us now and for ever&#44; because of thy holy name by 
which we are called &#33; Amen. 


Brethren

The wisest of men&#44; speaking by divine inspiration&#44; says : 

&#34; A tower of strength is the name of the Lord &#59; to it&#44; the righteous runs 
and is protected.&#34; Prov. xviii. 10.

And truly has this been so often exemplified&#44; that a man 
must&#44; indeed&#44; be totally blinded by prejudice&#44; and perfectly 
heedless of what passes hourly before his eyes&#44; if he is unwil&#8211; 
ling to acknowledge this truth. Look&#44; brethren&#44; I beseech you&#44; 
upon the occurrences of your lives&#44; and see you not how often 
very inadequate means have brought about unexpected results&#44; 
unexpected even to yourselves&#44; who were the sole actors &#63; By 
whose agency was this accomplished &#63; Not by your wisdom&#44; 
for you did not contemplate&#44; as likely&#44; the actual result. &#8212; Not 
by your industry&#44; for the means were&#44; to all appearance&#44; inade&#8211; 
quate to the accomplished end. And nevertheless&#44; you see the 
fact too plainly to doubt it&#59; you must&#44; therefore&#44; confess in 
your hearts&#44; that the All&#8211;ruling God proved to you his superin&#8211; 
tendence over the affairs of man &#59; even if&#44; in your own estima&#8211; 
tion&#44; you belong to that class of individuals&#44; whose existence 
and doings have apparently no great influence on the welfare of 
society at large. If this is shown in the affairs of individuals&#44; 
we shall see it&#44; perhaps&#44; oftener in the transactions of nations&#44; 
if we will but be attentive observers &#59; for here also&#44; the power 
and superintendence of God are displayed too palpably to 
escape the notice of the inquirer after truth. And no nation&#44; 
however great its power&#44; however ancient its first rise&#44; has had 
more examples in its history of great deeds done by small 
means&#44; than we can show &#8212; we&#44; the descendants of Israel&#44; 
selected from among all nations by the All&#8211;wise Ruler to be 
his people &#8212; to be devoted to his service &#8212; and to be a beacon 
to all other families of the earth. &#8212; Truly&#44; well may Israel say : 
&#34; Oft have enemies pressed me hard from the time of my 
youth : oft have they pressed me hard from the time of my 
youth&#44; yet they did not overcome me. On my back the 
ploughmen ploughed&#59; they drew long their furrows&#59; but 
righteous is He&#44; the Lord&#44; He hewed asunder the ropes of the 
wicked.&#34; &#40;Psalm cxxix.) &#8212; Full often have the enemies said: 
&#34; Come let us pull down the city of Zion &#59; let us destroy the 
temple on Moriah &#59; let us blot out the Hebrews from amidst 
nations&#59;&#34; but they strove against One mightier far than all 
human power &#59; One&#44; wiser far than all the wisdom of men &#59; and 
they failed&#44; as fail they must&#44; in their enterprise&#44; and were 
overwhelmed with confusion&#44; when every thing seemed to

yield before the oppressors&#39; power. I am not going to dilate 
upon our miraculous deliverance from Egypt&#59; not upon the 
victory of Deborah over Siserah &#59; not upon the slaughter of 
Senaherib&#39;s host &#59; not upon the return of the captives under 
Ezra and Zerubabel &#59; but I will only speak of the occasion of 
the festival of the Dedication riDJn which we celebrate this 
day. In the outset&#44; let me remark&#44; that never was a more 
entire confidence in God&#44; or a more heroic self&#8211;devotion&#44; dis&#8211; 
played at any period of our national existence&#44; than at the time 
of the brave family of the Asmoneans. &#8212; The Jews who had 
returned from Babylon&#44; by the express permission of the Per&#8211; 
sian king&#44; Cyrus&#44; lived securely and peaceably in their own 
land for many years&#44; secured from foreign danger&#44; by the pro&#8211; 
tection of the powerful Persians&#44; and in domestic peace&#44; 
because they were guided by the word of God&#44; and adminis&#8211; 
tered the holy law according to its letter and spirit. But at 
the downfal of the Persian monarchy&#44; Alexander&#44; of Macedon&#44; 
became master of Judea&#44; and after his death&#44; it first fell to the 
share of one&#44; then to that of another of his successors&#44; till at last 
it remained with the king of Syria. It was about this time&#44; 
that the philosophy of the Grecians exercised a very pernicious 
influence over some of our nation&#44; who wished&#44; foolishly&#44; to be 
freed from the strict and&#44; to them&#44; burthensome regulations of 
the Jewish law&#59; and&#44; with regret&#44; it must be confessed&#44; that so 
great was the degeneracy of the people&#44; that there could be 
found a man&#44; who by bribery induced the cruel Antiochus 
Epiphanes&#44; more properly called Epimanes&#44; signifying the 
madman&#44; to dispossess the virtuous Onias from the sacred office 
of high&#8211;priest &#59; and having thus shown his contempt for the 
dignity he unworthily coveted&#44; he exchanged his name of 
Joshua for the Greek one of Jason&#44; imagining&#44; perhaps&#44; to 
acquire more of the favour of the tyrant the more he assimi&#8211; 
lated to the ruling nation&#44; even as regards the name. But as 
the wicked generally lay the foundation of their own ruin&#44; so 
did the unworthy priest of whom we are speaking &#59; for a rela&#8211; 
tive of his own&#44; by the name of Onias&#44; who had assumed the 
Grecian name of Menalaus&#44; overbid him with the fickle despot&#44; 
who accordingly dismissed Jason and installed Menalaus in 
Aaron&#39;s holy office. How great must have been the wicked&#8211;

ness of those days&#59; when the station&#44; which had been intended 
as the portion of the wisest and best of all the servants of the 
altar&#44; was sold by an alien to our blood&#44; for money &#59; and the 
more so&#44; as the sacred vessels of the temple were purloined to 
pay the bribe &#59; and as the virtuous Onias was slaughtered 
because he dared in holy and honest indignation to raise his 
voice against the sacrilege. Deeds of such unexampled impiety 
were but too well calculated to bring all the sacred ordinances 
of the law into disrepute&#44; since the people at large could not 
help looking down with deserved contempt upon ministei&#8211;s 
stained with so many vices &#59; and there was&#44; therefore&#44; great 
danger that the community might be induced to throw off that 
worship&#44; which they saw administered by men whom they 
were forced to regard with aversion for their misconduct &#59; and 
with jealousy too&#44; at finding men elevated so much above them 
who were evidently not entitled to this elevation by a superior 
degree of moral excellence. &#8212; To increase this danger arising 
from a general laxity of principles&#44; persecution added its ter&#8211; 
rors. For when Antiochus had gone to subjugate Egypt to his 
power&#44; and it being reported that he had died&#44; Jason endea&#8211; 
voured to repossess himself of the dignity of high&#8211;priest&#44; which 
he had lost&#44; as said already&#44; by the treachery of Menalaus&#44; and 
having obtained possession of his person he shut him up in the 
fortress of Acra. But Antiochus was not dead &#59; and hearing of 
the revolt of Jason&#44; he construed it into a rebellion of the 
whole people&#59; he therefore marched against Jerusalem&#44; and 
butchered&#44; without remorse or pity&#44; tens of thousands of the 
helpless inhabitants&#44; and sold tens of thousands of free&#8211;born 
men into slavery. Yet even this excess of cruelty did not 
satisfy this bloody heathen king &#59; for superadded to his deeds 
of barbarity&#44; he now began a war against the religion of the 
Lord &#59; he pillaged the temple&#44; and desecrated the holy altar by 
commanding a swine to be sacrificed upon it&#59; there&#44; where 
naught but offerings agreeable to our Father were to be brought: 
where none but the righteous sons of Aaron were ever to 
officiate. Imagine to yourselves the horror which must have 
seized those Israelites who loved their God with all their heart&#44; 
at seeing the desecration of whatever was the holiest of all 
things on earth : and then picture to yourselves&#44; how grieved 

    <pb n="104"/>

they must have been&#44; when finding that they had not the 
power to avert the evil&#44; nor the strength to avenge themselves 
on their insolent oppressors. Though so much blood had 
already been shed&#44; Antiochus&#39;s thirst for slaughter was not 
stilled &#59; and he made the occasion of a defeat he suffered from 
the Romans a pretext for farther oppression of the Jews &#59; and 
in fact he determined to exterminate the whole race. The 
tyrant found a ready instrument in one Apollonius&#44; who&#44; 
whilst the whole people were engaged in peaceful worship on 
a Sabbath&#8211;day in the city consecrated to the service of God&#44; 
ordered his soldiers to fall upon the unresisting and defenceless 
multitude &#59; and fearfully did the slaughter rage&#44; for all the 
males were slain&#44; till the streets were red with the streaming 
gore of uncounted victims&#44; and the women were reserved even 
for a more cruel fate&#44; for they were led away as captives into 
hopeless slavery. &#8212; Apollonius next broke down the walls of 
the city&#44; pillaged it and set fire to it in many places &#59; and to 
curb the indignant spirit of a brave people&#44; he built a fortress 
on the highest part of mount Zion&#44; to keep the city and temple 
under perpetual exposure from his irruptions. Thus the enemy 
silenced the voice of the holy worship&#44; made the sacrifices 
cease&#44; and cast the whole house of Israel&#44; that yet remained&#44; in 
mourning. As if not enough had yet been done&#44; Antiochus 
commanded now&#44; that all his subjects should conform to one 
mode of worship. &#8212; He prohibited the covenant of Abraham&#44; 
interdicted the observance of the Sabbath&#44; compelled many to 
eat the flesh of the swine&#44; and&#44; most horrible &#33; a statue of an 
idol was&#44; by his orders&#44; erected on the altar of burnt&#8211;ofieringS&#42;&#44; 
where the heathens then worshipped in the place of God&#39;s 
chosen priests&#33; &#8212; Yet even this bitter persecution had its happy 
effects upon the Jews. Please to remember&#44; brethren&#44; what 
has been just said&#44; that the philosophy and manners of the Gre&#8211; 
cians&#44; who had obtained the mastery over all the countries bor&#8211; 
dering on Palestine&#44; were beginning to &#39;be the cause of fear&#8211; 
ful apostacies&#59; so much so indeed&#44; that&#44; as we have seen&#44; two 
men&#44; who possessed the dignity of high&#8211;priest&#44; bought their 
offices from heathens&#44; adopted heathen names&#44; and introduced 
such customs&#44; as were entirely opposed to the retired and vir&#8211; 
tuous mode of life recommended so strongly by the Bible.

THE FESTIVAL OF HANUCKAH. 105 

We may&#44; therefore&#44; regard it as a special miracle&#44; that the Jews 
were made to feel the tender mercies of the heathens&#44; whose 
manners they had begun to adopt&#44; and they could thus easily 
distinguish between the effects which the benign and tolerant 
precepts of the Mosaic code were intended to produce&#44; and the 
consequences of the destructive and intolerant systems of 
paganism. There was now&#44; moreover&#44; an opportunity offered 
to those yet firm and true to their God&#44; to display their con&#8211; 
stancy&#59; and we must look back with a religious satisfaction 
upon the unflinching resignation of the martyrs&#44; who suffered 
the most excruciating torments&#44; rather than offend against the 
will of God. Well known is the history of Hannah&#39;s seven 
sons &#59; also the noble resistance of the aged Eleazer&#44; who em&#8211; 
braced a glorious death&#44; to teach the young how to die willingly 
in the defence of the holy law&#44; when life can be purchased only 
by dishonouring it. &#8212; Thus&#44; the ancient spirit of the people 
began to revive&#44; amidst the persecutions which now had spread 
all over the country&#44; like the elastic bow that recoils the more 
strongly&#44; the stronger it has been bent &#59; and it was this spirit of 
virtue and bold defiance of the oppressor&#39;s power&#44; which was 
made the instrument of Divine Providence&#44; for preserving the 
remnant of Israel from the fell sword of the idolater. There 
lived in the town of Modin&#44; an aged man by the name of 
Mattathias&#44; son of Yochanan&#44; the high priest&#44; famed for virtue 
and an ardent zeal for his religion&#44; and father of five sons&#44; 
worthy of such a parent &#59; their names were : Yochanan&#44; Simon&#44; 
Judas&#44; Eleazer&#44; and Yonathan. It happened about this time&#44; 
that an officer of Antiochus&#44; Apelles&#44; arrived at Modin&#44; to 
enforce the king&#39;s decrees against the Jewish religion. It was 
of course to be expected&#44; that a man of Mattathias&#39;s standing&#8211; 
was to be brought over to the cause of idolatry by offers the 
most tempting&#59; for then&#44; as in later times&#44; our adversaries 
thought it justifiable to bribe us into apostacy&#44; when open force 
or persuasion would not succeed. But the venerable sage 
would not listen to the insidious proposals&#59; he proclaimed aloud&#44; 
that the faith which his fathers had acknowledged&#44; was the one 
to which he would firmly adhere to the moment of his dissolu&#8211; 
tion &#59; nay&#44; he even set the example of open resistance&#44; as he 
slew&#44; in the moment of holy zeal&#44; an apostate Jew&#44; who was

going to sacrifice to the idol&#59; and in addition&#44; the messenger of 
Antiochus fell by his hands. The sacred work once begun&#44; he 
summoned the citizens to follow him&#44; and in the mountain fast&#8211; 
ness they organized themselves&#59; and rapidly the numbers of 
the defenders increased &#59; and with prudence and unflinching 
courage they&#8211; conducted their heroic enterprize&#44; and they pro&#8211; 
ceeded to overturn the heathen altars in many places&#44; to enforce 
the observance of the law&#44; and to re&#8211;establish the provincial 
places of meeting for public worship &#40;the Synagogues)&#44; whilst 
the temple was yet in the hands of the Grecians. Mattathias 
had the happiness to behold the prosperous progress of the 
work of regeneration&#44; and&#44; crowned with immortal glory&#44; he 
resigned the command to his son Judas&#44; after which the aged 
warrior sunk into the arms of death&#44; and was interred in his 
native city&#44; Modin. 

Judas&#44; surnamed the Maccabee&#44; was a successor worthy of 
his glorious parent&#44; and he initiated his warriors by many a 
gallant deed of arms&#44; by surprising fortified places and garri&#8211; 
soning them &#59; and in this manner he secured to himself places 
of retreat in case of any misadventure. Having thus trained 
his small army&#44; he at length advanced against the proud and 
confiding enemy in the open field&#44; where he was met by Apol&#8211; 
lonius&#44; governor of Samaria&#44; whom he conquered and slew. 
Seron&#44; another general of Antiochus&#44; shared the same fate in 
a battle which he fought against Judas&#44; to revenge the death of 
Apollonius. But Antiochus was not willing that the despised 
Jews should so easily regain their independence&#59; he therefore 
sent an immense host to extinguish the people&#44; whose laws he 
hated&#44; and whose power he esteemed lightly. Nicanor&#44; then&#44; 
and Gorgias&#44; and Ptolemy Macron&#44; advanced against the feeble 
army of Judas with an army of forty thousand foot and seven 
thousand horse &#59; and in their train followed a great number of 
slave&#8211;merchants&#44; who were to purchase as many of the Israel&#8211; 
ites&#44; as should be made captives&#44; in order that their price should 
furnish the king with means to pay the arrears of the tribute 
due to the Romans. Vain imagination&#33; for no booty&#44; nor cap&#8211; 
&#44;tives fell into their hands&#59; but&#44; overwhelmed with confusion&#44; 
they were compelled to fly before the handful of those who 
shed their blood in the cause of God. Judas had assembled 

    <pb n="107"/>

six thousand men at Mitzpah&#44; a city famed for the victory 
achieved over the Philistines&#44; in former times&#44; by the prophet 
Samuel&#44; through his intercession with God&#44; for the then equally 
oppressed people. According to the ancient and hallowed cus&#8211; 
tom the men under Judas fasted here&#44; and prayed fervently 
for protection from above&#44; in their almost hopeless situation &#59; 
and though his army was barely an eighth part of the Syrian 
host&#44; Judas nevertheless made proclamation in obedience to the 
Mosaic law&#44; that every one who had built a house&#44; planted a 
vineyard&#44; espoused a woman&#44; or was afraid to meet the foe&#44; 
should return home&#44; and in consequence&#44; but three thousand 
remained with the hero&#44; to combat the forty&#8211;seven thousand of 
the enemy. But every breast of this little band was a forti&#8211; 
fied tower&#44; and the enemy dared not hope to march to victory&#44; 
but over the prostrate bodies of every one of the fearless de&#8211; 
fenders of the righteous cause. By a series of masterly ma&#8211; 
noeuvres Judas overcame the troops of Gorgias&#44; who were 
compelled to seek safety in flight. But in their success&#44; the 
Jews did not forget the Disposer of all human events&#44; and the 
following day&#44; being Sabbath&#44; they rested and returned their 
heartfelt thanks to our heavenly Father. &#8212; Another victory was 
soon after gained over another great army of the Syrians&#44; in 
the country beyond Jordan : in consequence of which Nicanor&#44; 
he who had advised that the slave&#8211;dealers should follow the 
army&#44; was compelled to fly to Antioch&#44; disguised as a. slave&#59; 
strange retribution&#44; but how just&#33; In the following year&#44; 
Lysias&#44; who had been appointed by the king to exterminate 
the Hebrew people&#44; advanced with sixty thousand foot and five 
thousand horse&#44; to which immense force Judas was able to 
oppose but ten thousand men &#59; and yet he triumphed : for what 
could resist those&#44; who did not fight for fame&#44; nor wealth&#44; but 
solely for the honour of their violated faith&#44; and under the 
especial protection of the Almighty&#63; It was after this battle 
that Judas was enabled to regain the desolate ruins of Jerusa&#8211; 
lem &#59; but oh&#33; who can paint the anguish of the people&#44; when 
they found shrubs growing in the courts of the temple&#44; and 
saw the walls of the sacred edifice defaced&#44; and were conscious 
that every thing had been profaned by the unclean hands of the 
pagans&#63; But they instantly commenced the work of purifica&#8211;

tion&#44; reinstalled the expelled priests&#44; rebuilt the altar&#44; replaced 
the sacred vessels&#44; which had been taken&#44; out of the spoils which 
had fallen into their hands&#44; and they celebrated the feast of 
Dedication for eight days&#44; amidst universal rejoicing and 
thanksgiving. It is said&#44; that as they re&#8211;entered the temple&#44; 
they found that all the oil&#44; appropriated for the service&#44; had 
been defiled by the Syrians&#44; except one cruet&#44; sealed with the 
seal of the high priest&#44; which&#44; however&#44; contained only enough 
for one day&#39;s supply. You must know&#44; that according to the 
twenty&#8211;seventh chapter of Exodus&#44; and the twenty&#8211;fourth of 
Leviticus&#44; the oil for the service of the temple was to be pure&#44; 
and especially destined for the purpose. It now came to pass&#44; 
that the oil found in the cruet lasted for eight days&#44; till a fresh 
supply could be procured. In commemoration of this&#44; we 
light the Hanuckah lamps in all our dwellings&#44; during the eight 
days of the festival of Consecration&#44; which we are this day 
celebrating. 

It is needless to pursue farther the account of the victories 
of the valiant Maccabee&#44; as history&#44; accessible to you all&#44; has 
furnished us a detail of the facts. I only intended to sketch&#44; 
as briefly as possible&#44; the origin of the eight days of Hanuckah&#44; 
and to point out to you the wonderful occurrences connected 
with them. We have seen how the heathens triumphed&#44; how 
they satiated their fierce revenge&#44; and how they glutted their 
desire for blood&#44; whilst the trespasses of a great portion of the 
people justly devoted them to the vengeance denounced in the 
law. Again it has been shown&#44; how the subsequent persecu&#8211; 
tions gave to the noble&#8211;minded amongst us an opportunity of 
proving how m.uch they valued the sacred inheritance derived 
from their ancestors&#44; and how gladly they resigned all&#44; when 
life and security could be purchased only at the price of apos&#8211; 
tacy&#44; &#8212; We have it also proved&#44; how utterly unavailing were 
all the artifices of the foe to extirpate the religious feelings of 
the Jews&#44; by all the means which his cruelty could devise&#44; and 
how he was overcome and his great armies conquered&#44; by the 
few who remained true to the belief of their ancestors. &#8212; Let 
us reflect &#8212; was this not a glorious proof of the Divine Protec&#8211; 
tion &#8212; when the nation of Israel was preserved by apparently 
so inadequate physical means from amalgamation with the hea&#8211;

thens on the one hand&#44; and extermination by countless swarms 
of warriors on the other&#63; &#8212; Well might Israel say: &#34; Full often 
have enemies pressed me hard from my youth&#44; yet they did 
not overcome me &#59; for the righteous Lord hewed asunder the 
bonds of the wicked.&#34; And so it ever was. Age after age 
has looked with a jealous eye on the insignificant numbers of 
the Hebrews&#44; and no artifice has been left untried to inveigle 
them to apostacy&#59; yet the Jews remain a people before the 
Lord. The sword of persecution has been often unsheathed&#44; 
but gladly did millions of victims stretch out their necks to 
receive the death&#8211;stroke&#44; which sealed with their life&#39;s blood 
their attachment to One God&#33; The stake was kindled&#44; and the 
children of Yeshurun were promised life and honour&#44; if they 
would but swerve from their belief in a single article &#59; but they 
exclaimed: &#34;The Lord our God is the only Eternal Being&#33;&#34; 
and hastened into the embrace of a cruel death&#44; as though they 
were hurrying to a great festival. Victim after victim was led 
forth&#44; yet thousands were still ready to follow the holy exam&#8211; 
ple&#33; &#8212; It is not to be denied&#44; that human passions&#44; unconnected 
with any thing sacred&#44; may stimulate multitudes to sacrifice 
themselves for the sake of some cherished opinion. But where 
is that people which has suffered&#44; with so much constancy as the 
Jews have done&#44; the contumely of nations&#44; the hatred of sove&#8211; 
reigns&#44; the derision of the worthless&#63; Is this not sufferino&#8211;the 
rack and death in every man&#44; in every woman&#44; in every child 
of the people&#63; And then let us consider&#44; how steadfastly all 
was borne&#44; how nobly we submitted to all&#44; and to every one&#44; 
of the many vexations in defence of the best gift of Heaven &#33; 
And instead of advancing the political influence of their caste&#44; 
as may have been the case with martyrs for other systems&#44; the 
Israelites that died for their religion&#44; never could hope for such 
a result&#59; for there was no contest waged for superiority&#44; there 
was no prospect of their death being avenged by their friends &#59; 
for alas&#33; our nation has been powerless for tens of centuries&#44; 
and none but He above can be looked to as the avenger of the 
innocent blood. Besides the number of their followers could 
not be augmented by their heroic suffering&#59; for we do not look 
for an outward increase&#44; till the time of the Lord arrives &#59; and 
if any thing their example would draw the line of separation

more broadly&#44; and confine our people to their own members 
exclusively&#44; as certainly the strict adherence of our martyred 
ones was nowise calculated to invite strangers&#44; who had follow&#8211; 
ed an easier and freer law&#44; to the adoption of the Mosaic sys&#8211; 
tem. None&#44; therefore&#44; but the most prejudiced can deny&#44; that 
the sacrifice of so many useful lives proves&#44; that the Israelites 
conceived the law to be vital to their existence&#44; that they con&#8211; 
sidered mingling with the mass of mankind and coalescing with 
the nations&#44; as a calamity to be avoided even at the expense of 
life &#59; and consequently&#44; as universal principles of right cannot 
be changed by circumstances and time&#44; it must further be con&#8211; 
ceded&#44; that at the present day too we are bound to follow their 
footsteps in so far as to maintain&#44; at all hazards&#44; the precepts and 
the supremacy of the code of Moses. 

Yet it may be urged&#44; although without much reason&#44; that 
vigilance is not any longer called for&#44; since&#44; at the present mo&#8211; 
ment&#44; all persecution has ceased&#44; since now Israel is no more 
exposed to hatred for opinion&#39;s sake&#44; since the nations of the 
earth regard us with a more favourable eye&#44; and since the bonds 
of thraldom are broken &#59; and that therefore we may at the pre&#8211; 
sent day freely join with those around us&#44; throw off antiquated 
customs&#44; more suited to a less enlightened age&#44; and assimilate 
in manners and in the language of public worship to the peo&#8211; 
ple among whom we live &#59; in fact such reasoning would go far 
to break down the uniformity of rule and language which has 
hitherto&#44; and for so long a period&#44; prevailed among the Jews. 
But hear me&#44; brethren&#44; hear me you who are descended from 
the patriarchs&#44; and remark what I say&#44; that this very state of 
fancied security is the most hurtful to our independence as a 
religious community. Understand me&#44; I do not say&#44; that we 
should&#44; even if we could&#44; separate our interests from those of the 
nations under whose protection we so happily enjoy security&#44; 
under whose shadow we advance so firmly in the path of sci&#8211; 
ence and the noble unfolding of the mind &#59; for we are com&#8211; 
manded by God&#44; through the mouth of the prophet Jeremiah&#44; 
&#34;to seek the peace of the city in which we live&#59;&#34; and it has 
accordingly always been our custom&#44; in every country where 
we were permitted to rest for a while to recruit our strength 
and to refresh our weary limbs&#44; to pray for the welfare of the

government and the administrators of justice. Nevertheless&#44; 
a sense of duty now demands of me to admonish you&#44; my 
brethren&#44; to beware of losing sight of the holy law&#44; by which 
alone you can prosper. Think you&#44; that because there is no 
actual persecution&#44; we are therefore safe from all attacks&#63; Is 
there no cause for firmly maintaining the law&#44; because no cru&#8211; 
sades are preached up against us&#63; Alas&#33; candour and truth 
compel me and every thinking man to say&#44; that only the wea&#8211; 
pons have been changed&#44; but that the system itself is yet the 
same it was three thousand years ago&#44; when Pharaoh endea&#8211; 
voured to repress the growth of the Israelites by hard labour &#33; 
Believe me&#44; brethren&#44; that the Jew&#44; as such&#44; is an object of 
hatred and even contempt to almost every other individual of 
the human family. The infidel&#44; who is regardless of every 
system of religion&#44; will ridicule you for observing precepts 
which he avers to be founded in error&#59; and the zealot for any 
other of the systems under which men live will pity you for 
being nothing but blind Jews&#44; even if your acts are such as 
every one must acknowledge to be the most laudable&#59; the most 
worthy of our people are commiserated for belonging to no 
better people than the Jews&#44; as though there could be a name 
more honourable for antiquity and virtue&#44; or any nation in pos&#8211; 
session of more elevated maxims of piety than the Jewish peo&#8211; 
ple &#33; The consequences of this spirit of intolerance show them&#8211; 
selves from time to time in the efforts whicli are made to bring 
the Jews to apostacy&#44; either by direct bribes&#44; or by inducements 
that offices and honourable preferment should be given as the 
price for an outward change of faith. Add to this&#44; that the 
courtesy now shown us has unfortunately induced too many 
already to relax from the severity of the burdens of the law&#59; 
and by mixing too freely with other nations some have learned 
and adopted their manners&#44; and occasionally we witness an en&#8211; 
tire family&#42; leaving the apparently austere precepts of Moses&#44; 
and joining themselves to the more easy systems of others. Is 
not this a state which demands the serious attention of every 

&#42; In thus stating&#34; my opinion&#44; I do not mean a public embracing of other 
tenets only&#44; but also such acts as place the agents or their descendants be&#8211; 
yond the pale of the Jewish Church&#59; such as intermarriage with gentiles&#44; 
and a total neglect of the law.

Jew&#44; who is so in sincerity&#63; Have not our enemies predicted&#44; 
that in the course of a century the Jewish name would die away 
in the countries where we enjoy affluence&#44; by gradually amal&#8211; 
gamating with the nations amongst whom we reside &#63; Are the 
Israelites willing to contribute with all their might to the ful&#8211; 
filment of this libellous prediction &#63; Shall indeed the day arrive&#44; 
when it could be said with truth &#8212; &#34;Israel has ceased to be&#63;&#34; 
I&#44; for my part&#44; fear not that anything of the kind will ever take 
place &#59; for the Almighty will &#40;according to his promise) avert 
the danger in his own good time&#44; and just as in the days of the 
Maccabee&#44; persecution will ensue as a punishment for our trans&#8211; 
gressions&#44; to teach us that we have incurred the displeasure of 
Heaven&#44; if security will make us forgetful of our duty. And 
have we not examples innumerable that persecution or banish&#8211; 
ment always followed in the train of a relaxation from the ob&#8211; 
servance of the law&#63; Why then will you&#44; avoiding the fellow&#8211; 
ship of your brethren&#44; imitate and flatter people&#44; whose opinions 
and yours ought never to become alike by a surrender of your 
own principles &#59; and what is more&#44; why should you think of 
doing an acknowledged evil when all your endeavours to eflfect 
it will and must utterly fail&#63; And think you&#44; that persecution 
will never more raise its head&#63; Imagine you&#44; that the state of 
advancement which many nations have reached in civilization 
will for ever preclude the recurrence of the scenes witnessed 
from the barbarity of the inquisition &#63; We should pray to Hea&#8211; 
ven&#44; that this might be so &#59; but still we cannot rest in perfect 
security&#44; whilst we are regardless of the duties to our God. It 
seems fatal to us Jews to depart therefrom&#44; and during the whole 
of our existence&#44; we have ever found&#44; that those nations even&#44; 
that were&#44; from the nature of their worship&#44; friendly to every 
system of polytheism&#44; always regarded with aversion&#44; and per&#8211; 
secuted too very often&#44; the followers of One God &#59; so that con&#8211; 
cessions will on the one hand draw down upon us the just in&#8211; 
dignation of Divine Providence&#44; and will not on the other gain 
for us the paltry favour of the gentiles&#44; even if it could in the 
slightest degree be valued against the positive loss we incur by 
offending the Lord. Menelaus&#44; when he purloined the sacred 
vessels of the temple&#44; no doubt thought that the purchase of 
the office of high&#8211;priest through sacrilege from the heathens 

    <pb n="113"/>

would have no evil consequences&#59; the people of those days 
perhaps imaguied&#44; that the imitation of the customs of the 
Greeks&#44; which favoured the pursuit of pleasure so much more 
than the retired manners of the Jews&#44; would produce only the 
happiest result: and yet we have seen&#44; in the brief sketch just 
given&#44; how near these same causes brought the children of 
Israel to the very brink of extirpation. Let this then operate 
as a solemn admonition on all who may feel inclined to yield 
the strict discipline of the Mosaic law&#59; for &#40;let me repeat it) 
by this alone we can be safe &#33; Do you think that the injunction 
against the marrying of persons who are not Jews is a mere 
arbitrary precept&#63; Do you think&#44; that the forbidden meats&#44; and 
the strict attention to be given to those that are allowed&#44; are 
mere superstitious ordinances&#63; Credit me&#44; brethren&#44; that both 
and similar other laws are the very safeguard to our existence &#59; 
and that it is the very distance which the strict observance of 
our rules interposes between us and others&#44; which has so miracu&#8211; 
lously preserved us entire during so many ages of darkness and 
oppression. And shall it be said&#44; that we threw off the burden 
of the law&#44; as soon as we could find a convenient opportunity 
to do so&#63; May that be the last day of peace to Israel&#44; when this 
shall be true &#59; may punishment upon punishment again be pour&#8211; 
ed out to teach us the way of righteousness&#44; and may the bit&#8211; 
terness of wormwood and the cup of wrath again be presented 
to our lips&#44; until we return and seek the Lord. Brethren&#33; let 
me call upon you to consider well your relation to your Maker&#59; 
and let the reflection&#44; which must be awakened within you on 
this day&#44; devoted to the celebration of the service of the Lord 
restored by your ancestors&#44; and of their exertions made in de&#8211; 
fence of the righteous faith&#44; stimulate you to imitate&#44; as far as 
lies within your power&#44; their noble example of self&#8211;devotion. 
They left their homes&#44; they relinquished the pleasures of a city 
life&#44; the enjoyment of domestic happiness&#44; in short every thing 
that renders life agreeable&#44; and resorted to mountain fastnesses&#44; 
and there exposed their lives hourly to the most imminent peril. 
Be it then also your study to deny to yourselves those plea&#8211; 
sures&#44; to abstain from those enjoyments&#44; to avoid those meetings&#44; 
which run counter to the letter and spirit of our law &#59; for in this 
careful abstinence only can you&#44; in these days of allurement and

general intercourse&#44; preserve in purity the blessed legacy of 
your forefathers. All this can also be accomplished without 
the least illiberality towards your friends of another belief. 
Love them as yourselves&#44; assist them in their necessities&#44; admi&#8211; 
nister comfort to them when they are afflicted&#44; watch over them 
when they are sick&#44; clothe their naked ones&#44; feed their hungry&#44; 
and bury their dead&#59; for this universal love is demanded of you 
b)&#39; the God who benignantly watches over all his creatures. 
Nay more&#44; you must not pride yourselves at being Jews&#44; nor de&#8211; 
spise others for being less enlightened in the true religion &#59; but 
only be thankful&#44; that it pleased the Almighty to make you his 
own people. Condemn no man for his belief&#44; for you cannot 
know to whom the Lord may have decreed deserved happiness. 
Besides all this&#44; you should never attempt &#8212; if not in defence 
of your own principles &#8212; to weaken any man&#39;s belief in his 
received opinions&#44; nor try to undermine any general custom&#44; 
unless you find the one or the other injurious to the peace of 
society at large&#44; for to this you are bound to contribute what&#8211; 
ever you may be able to effect. Such a system as this is cer&#8211; 
tainly not one founded upon illiberality&#44; nor based upon super&#8211; 
stition and bigotry&#59; and acting up to it moreover will in nowise 
tend to abstract you in the least from your religion&#44; for the 
strictest observance of the Bible can be coupled with universal 
philanthropy&#59; and&#44; let me add&#44; that no true religion has taken 
root in the heart of him who looks&#44; from inward pride at his 
own superiority&#44; with contempt upon his fellow&#8211;men. And the 
affected fear which some feel to acknowledge their being Jews 
is truly ridiculous. For why should you be afraid to avow your 
attachment to Judaism&#63; Why should the dread of ridicule de&#8211; 
ter you from doing those duties which ages of persecutions and 
hardships endeared to your ancestors&#63; There are doubtlessly 
some among my hearers&#44; who are descended from those glori&#8211; 
ous martyrs who suffered but so recently all the tei&#39;rors and 
pains which a bigoted priesthood&#44; working upon a superstitious 
and ignorant populace&#44; could invent. If then the children of 
these martyrs are here&#44; let them reflect for what purpose their 
progenitors suffered &#59; and let them act as becomes children of 
such parents&#44; by following the dictates of that law which they 
acknowledged up to the moment of the&#39; being taken hence&#44;

when they were relieved from those severe tortures&#44; which 
their bodies were no longer able to endure &#33; You&#44; who have 
come hither from a foreign land&#44; perhaps for the sake of escap&#8211; 
ing the odium attached in many countries to our name&#44; show 
by your devotion to the holy law&#44; in a land where you are at 
liberty to worship your God in the manner He commanded you 
without fear of interruption&#44; that you are deserving of all the 
favours which can be bestowed on mortals. And you&#44; who 
were born in this country&#44; who never felt the want of liberty 
of conscience&#44; reflect that every Israelite&#44; even the one who 
bears the insult and maltreatment of some African or Asiatic 
despot&#44; is your brother&#44; and that you owe obedience to the same 
law which guides him&#44; and in defence of which he is perchance 
suffering imprisonment and stripes&#44; whilst you walk at large in 
ease and affluence &#33; 

I am afraid that I have detained you too long already upon 
this subject&#44; but I thought the present occasion one every way 
proper to communicate to you the occurrences of olden times&#44; 
and the reflections which naturally flow from their considera&#8211; 
tion. I hope that the lesson taught by the wonderful event 
detailed to you will sink deeply in your hearts&#44; and that you 
may ever be animated by a holy zeal&#44; be ever ready to meet 
every danger&#44; rather than transgress the will of God. If you 
should sacrifice property and life even in this cause&#44; you may 
rest assured that the everlasting Father can and will compen&#8211; 
sate you a thousand fold for every suffering and privation&#59; and 
remember that &#8212; &#34; The name of the Lord is a strong tower to 
which the righteous runs and is protected.&#34; 

May the protection of the Almighty be always extended over 
you&#44; and may you&#44; living in his fear&#44; be ever exempt from all 
suffering and trouble. Amen.

DISCOURSE XII. 



THE PEAR OP LOSS. 



Lord of the Universe&#44; from whom all blessings&#44; which every 
being enjoys&#44; emanate&#44; bless us in thy grace&#44; and bestow on us 
the choicest gifts of thy goodness and bounty &#59; and grant&#44; that 
each and every one of thy children be able to acquire a main&#8211; 
tenance&#44; without needing the assistance of one another&#44; or that 
of a foreign people &#59; so that they may&#44; living by thy bounty 
solely&#44; devote their lives to thy service. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 
Among the causes which tend to withhold man from the pur&#8211; 
suit of religion&#44; the fear of incurring temporal loss stands pre&#8211; 
eminent&#59; especially if his circumstances should compel him to 
seek his bread by daily labour. Such a one will refuse to rest 
on the Sabbath&#44; under the plea that he is unable to pretermit 
his work one or two days every week&#44; since his unremitted 
toil will barely furnish him with a livelihood. He acts and 
speaks as though it were his exertions&#44; aided by his ingenuity&#44; 
which could secure him against want &#59; he forgets his depend&#8211; 
ence on a higher Power&#44; and he places not an undivided confi&#8211; 
dence in Providence&#44; who &#34;in giving life&#44;&#34; as our wise men 
express it&#44; &#34; will also provide food.&#34; And if you speak to one 
of this class about his religious duties&#44; he will tell you&#44; that his 
circumstances forbid his observing them &#59; that an attendance at 
the house of God would expose him to too great a loss of time 
and money &#59; others more favoured than he may find it conve&#8211; 
nient to give charity and to assist the poor&#44; but that he ought to 
be exempt from the burthen of troubling himself about other 
people&#39;s wants. He will not&#44; however&#44; confess&#44; even to him&#8211; 
self&#44; that there is aught blame&#8211;worthy in his conduct&#59; for he 
almost invariably flatters himself with the opinion&#44; that God 
will not look with displeasure upon one who honestly endea&#8211; 
vours to pursue his calling&#44; and withholds not from the 

    <pb n="117"/>

humblest individual his just dues. And should a man&#44; like 
this&#44; even say&#44; that he will do better when his circumstances 
improve&#44; it is highly probable that this period will never 
arrive &#59; for if he should amass uncounted wealth&#44; and be blessed 
with whatever his heart desires&#44; he will still find a new set of 
excuses to suit his more improved condition &#59; and death may 
close his life&#44; before he has arranged&#44; much less carried into 
execution&#44; the proposed plans for his self&#8211;amelioration. This 
eagerness for wealth&#44; and this fear of being poor have been a 
prevailing cause of much irreligion at all times&#44; and our daily 
experience teaches us&#44; that many&#44; alas &#33; yield all their energies 
to the obtainment of the coveted worldly blessings &#59; and 
though often advised of the nothingness of gold&#44; though 
exhorted to seek for higher riches&#44; the race for aggrandizement 
is still pursued by the many &#59; the path of real virtue trod by 
but few devoted spirits. I may&#44; therefore&#44; be asked&#44; what is 
the good to be derived from public exhortations &#8212; what effect 
can a moralist look for from telling the world of their fail&#8211; 
ings &#63; Or&#44; I may be told&#44; that as the sinner will do as he 
pleases&#44; and as it is needless to provoke his resentment&#44; it were 
much better to let every one pursue his own way&#44; without 
attempting to interfere with him. To all these and similar 
objections against the utility of public addresses in our places 
of worship&#44; I wish to put in the following plea&#44; trusting that 
the candid will see therein&#44; a perfect justification of the task I 
have&#44; though unusual at present among us&#44; voluntarily assumed&#44; 
and in which I hope to be able to persevere with the blessing of 
Heaven. I know full well&#44; that there is no mode of con&#8211; 
vincing any one of the necessity of being a strict Israelite&#44; if 
the sacred volume does not speak to his heart &#59; if he does not 
feel in his inmost soul that every precept it contains&#44; is obligatory 
upon him in consequence of its being an edict of the Supreme 
Wisdom &#59; moreover it is no secret to me&#44; that but little favour 
can be gained by the exposition of any fault to which a com&#8211; 
munity or any member thereof may be addicted. Yet do I 
think it my duty to teach fearlessly what our law says con&#8211; 
cerning the neglect of the divine precepts&#44; be the cause sordid 
avarice or forgetfulness of our obligations to God &#59; hoping to be 
able at least to rouse a spirit of reflection in some&#44; if I cannot 

    <pb n="118"/>

118 THE FEAR OF LOSS. 

even convince all of the justness of the views&#44; which&#44; as an 
Israelite&#44; I honestly entertain &#59; and trusting that my feeble 
admonitions may be made the instrument of bringing back&#44; one 
day&#44; &#40;though none of us may live to see it) a few to the pale of 
our holy faith : and should this even not come to pass&#44; to make 
the memory of those glorious men more respected&#44; who have 
gone down to the tomb&#44; after having all their lives adhered 
strictly&#44; and paid unflinching obedience&#44; to the statutes which 
were handed down as an inheritance to the congregation of 
Jacob. Whilst on the subject let me state in this place&#44; once 
for all&#44; that no allusion shall ever be made to any person in 
particular&#44; as manners and not tnen are alone fit subjects for 
our inquiries &#59; but at the same time&#44; sins shall always be con&#8211; 
demned&#44; no matter who the sinners are. This much I would 
desire you to bear in mind&#44; that&#44; as I deem personalties unfit to 
be introduced in moral lectures&#44; and as any such allusions 
should be carefully avoided : nothing&#44; whatever&#44; that I may 
have to advance in the course of the addresses I may make to 
you&#44; should be looked upon in a light as though I were 
desirous to harrow up&#44; wantonly&#44; the feelings of any one of my 
hearers. If any there are&#44; to whom a portion of what is said 
should happen to apply &#59; if they so feel it within themselves: 
let them &#8212; not blame the preacher who is anxious for their 
improvement &#8212; but ponder well on the doctrines advanced &#59; let 
the admonitions be the means of causing them to search well into 
their conduct &#59; of noting every&#44; or any particular act of their 
life &#59; and if they find themselves in the wrong&#44; let them mend 
their course speedily&#44; whilst yet the vigour of youth or the 
strength of manhood remains &#59; whilst yet they have the mas&#8211; 
tery over their inclinations &#59; before decrepid old age&#44; or long&#8211; 
indulged vicious habits have made sin their second nature &#59; 
before the forgetfulness of all moral obligation has nearly extin&#8211; 
guished all hopes of amendment. &#8212; This short explanation I 
conceived to be necessary&#44; fearing lest some persons might take 
offence or exception against an inadvertantly uttered thought&#44; 
spoken without viewing previously all the bearings my 
hearers might give to it. I&#44; therefore&#44; now solemnly declare&#44; 
that any imputation or inference&#44; as though I intended to give 
offence wilfully to any human being&#44; is entirely unfounded x

since I would think myself debased&#44; were I to use my station 
as a public teacher&#44; to carry malice towards any one of my 
hearers into the house dedicated to the service of God. 

Having said&#44; accidentally&#44; thus much on the scope of my 
intended remarks&#44; let us resume the subject with which we 
commenced. It was stated that the fear of temporary loss&#44; is 
one of the chief causes which render men irreligious. It is 
therefore proper&#44; that we trace this fear&#44; and endeavour to show 
its futility&#44; and to prove that if even it be well founded&#44; there 
are thousand other considerations which should prevent us from 
ever allowing it to influence our conduct. &#8212; The wavering man&#44; 
or he who has already thrown off the burden of restraint which 
religion must of necessity impose &#8212; since faith merely&#44; without 
acts&#44; is not the religion of the Israelites &#8212; will always require 
some other than mere spiritual advantages to incite him to prac&#8211; 
tise religious obligations&#44; or in other words&#44; one who is not 
convinced of the necessity and paramount obligation of the law 
of God will rarely&#44; if ever&#44; appear religious unless his worldly 
advantages are actually&#44; or expected to be&#44; augmented thereby. 
These may consist&#44; in an actual accession of wealth&#44; the 
name of a thorough&#8211;good man&#44; or the fear of public censure. 
If one pretends to piety from the two first motives&#44; he is 
a hypocrite&#44; since he does that for gain or fame which has 
not a sufficiently strong hold on his conviction&#44; to be viewed 
as a duty &#59; with the last mentioned motive&#44; however&#44; the 
fear of censure&#44; a man may not be totally lost to all holy 
sensations&#44; as the fear he entertains of men may preserve 
him&#44; perhaps&#44; from doing any thing absolutely wrong&#44; even 
in secret&#44; since the habit of practising the good publicly 
may&#44; by degrees&#44; teach him to dispense with the evil alto&#8211; 
gether&#44; and if this should not be entirely so&#44; it may be cal&#8211; 
culated on at least to a considerable extent. Persons of this 
kind&#44; pious from fear&#44; can only be found in communities&#44; 
where the majority are&#44; in truth and without ostentation&#44; de&#8211; 
voted to the observance of the law&#59; for unless one is actually 
debased at heart&#44; he will readily join in with his fellows&#44; 
although he be not persuaded of the absolute necessity of their 
conduct. The hypocrite too&#44; will commonly make his appearance&#44; 
where the many are religious&#44; tliough amongst a community of

irreligious persons too he may assume the outward appearance 
of sanctity&#44; the better to conceal his wickedness&#44; till his ends 
be obtained. &#8212; But&#44; generally speaking&#44; if a man not absolutely 
convinced of the truth of revelation is placed where his in&#8211; 
terest would be better subserved by disregarding the divine 
precepts : we shall find&#44; that he will seek his worldly gain as 
paramount to every other consideration&#44; and the hypocrite&#44; as 
well as the pious from habit merely&#44; will then disregard his 
former practices&#59; and the one from wantonness&#44; the other from 
apprehension of loss&#44; will leave religion as something which 
has no claim to his attention. &#8212; To one&#44; who assumes the garb 
of religion only to forward his plans of wickedness&#44; or to pro&#8211; 
mote his interest&#44; but little can be said to awaken his mind to 
a review of his conduct&#44; unless we could demonstrate to him&#44; 
that punishment will&#44; to a certainty and inevitably&#44; follow from 
above as the consequence of sin&#44; even if no human vengeance 
should ever be exerted against his crimes. Yet&#44; this is almost 
impossible to prove to the obdurate &#59; for tell him that the book 
of God has so recorded it&#44; and he will ridicule that openly&#44; 
which he disbelieves secretly&#59; tell him of examples&#44; even those 
which came under your own observation&#44; and he will say&#44; that 
it was all the effect of chance&#44; and that you were misled by the 
coincidence merely to suppose it the work of a special Provi&#8211; 
dence &#59; madman&#33; as though the actual occurrence of these 
strange coincidences from time to time did not prove in the 
strongest manner the existence and the exercise of an especial 
watchfulness by the Creator&#33; &#8212; Therefore&#44; to him who neglects 
to obey God&#39;s word from a feeling of contempt towards it&#44; or 
to him who uses it merely as an outward cloak&#44; we shall not 
at present address ourselves&#59; but we will only turn to him&#44; 
who is neglectful of his religion from an actual apprehension 
of too great a loss&#44; and upon whom public opinion has not 
influence enough to make him pursue the path of righteousness. 
Fallen brother&#33; thou fearest to suffer loss by obeying thy 
God&#59; thou weenest&#44; that thou art bound to endeavour to shield 
thyself against want&#44; even at the expense of the duties thou

striving to convince thyself by false and specious excuses&#44; that

thy present conduct&#33; But thou errest&#59; thou lookest upon the 
confused outlines merely&#44; which thy imperfect vision presents 
to thee&#44; of the real state of existence&#44; and hence thy mistaking 
the false for the true &#8212; the unimportant for the vitally essen&#8211; 
tial &#8212; and the means for the object&#33; &#8212; Yes&#44; brethren and friends&#44; 
it is only by this misplacing the unholy in the room of the holiest 
thing in existence&#44; that a man can desire temporal goods in 
preference to being religious&#44; and that sordid avarice can&#44; as it 
were&#44; push the unwary wanderer in the abyss of eternal de&#8211; 
struction&#44; which yawns unseen beneath his feet. &#8212; In the first 
place&#44; let us view the real extent of the apprehended temporal 
loss&#44; by which is generally understood&#44; the not&#8211;acquiring or 
not&#8211;retaining of as much money&#44; or that for which money can 
be obtained&#44; as another of our fellow&#8211;men has acquired&#44; or is in 
process of obtaining. Those now disposed to transgress aver&#44; 
that their business must suffer if they are strict in the observ&#8211; 
ance of the laws&#59; because so many days must be spent in idleness&#44; 
which could be profitably employed&#59; and so much capital must 
be laid out in charity&#44; the Synagogue and the support of reli&#8211; 
gion in general&#44; which brings no return whatever. But this is 
evidently an empty excuse&#44; since so many who were good 
Jews from their infancy&#44; who never profaned the day of rest &#59; 
who never suffered the hungry to go from their doors unfed &#59; 
who never permitted the naked to remain unclothed &#59; who 
never neglected to pay the duties which our holy law demands 
to be exercised towards the sick and dead &#8212; I say&#44; pious men 
are not necessarily doomed to indigence&#44; since so many of them 
have risen from an humble beginning&#44; to immense affluence 
and distinction&#33; What then is there in these things to deter 
us from practising them&#63; Nothing &#8212; but our own idle fears&#44; &#8212; 
nothing but hateful envy at the success of a neighbour&#44; which 
causes us to strain every nerve to become of equal importance 
with him in the arbitrary scale of rank&#44; which the vain&#44; the 
conceited&#44; and the ignorant have always been at so great pains 
to establish. &#8212; It is&#44; moreover&#44; by no means ascertained&#44; even 
to the satisfaction of the transgressors themselves&#44; that their 
wealth is actually augmented&#44; or their standing in society 
raised by their irreligious practices &#59; and yet the few examples 
of transgressors becoming rich or respectable are constantly

held up as excuses for others to do likewise&#44; as though they 
could prove&#44; that the ways of sin are pleasant&#44; when the unrea&#8211; 
sonableness of such argument must be self&#8211;evident. &#8212; But let 
us now for one moment grant&#44; that the object in view&#44; the pur&#8211; 
suit of wealth and fame&#44; can be best attained in the way of sin&#44; 
what then at last is the ultimate gain&#63; &#8212; Riches &#33; Honour &#33; &#8212; 
God&#33; that these baubles should be powerful enough to mis&#8211; 
lead so many unthinking&#44; and some even reflecting&#44; minds&#33; 
Riches&#63; &#8212; If those in humble circumstances were but to know 
how much gilded misery there is existing &#8212; if they could but 
once look at the true nature of wealth&#44; masked by a fair ap&#8211; 
pearance &#8212; if they could but once be convinced&#44; that no real 
satisfaction is ever obtained by the possession of the utmost 
desires of the imagination : &#8212; they would assuredly cease to 
crave so inordinately that which is once for all beyond their 
reach &#59; and those treasures&#44; which the All&#8211;wise Dispenser has 
denied them&#44; would then assuredly remain unsought. &#8212; Riches&#63; 
Yes&#44; look at that man&#44; who has become great by the success of 
his business&#59; gold and silver are his in plenty&#44; houses&#44; fields&#44; 
slaves&#44; and cattle he possesses : and yet has he enough&#63; &#8212; no&#44; 
his toil is the same it was years ago&#44; when he was miserably 
poor&#44; for his grovelling nature knows not how to be contented&#44; 
his avarice is not yet satisfied&#44; and he will hardly allow himself 
or his family any of the indulgencies which wealth can purchase&#44; 
not because he dislikes such enjoyments&#44; but only because he 
is afraid they will impoverish him&#44; that is&#44; diminish his hoard 
to some small extent. &#8212; Riches&#63; Oh&#44; name not the delusive 
word with the fervour with which it is generally pronounced &#59; 
for riches are but the empty shadow&#44; the deceiving light&#44; which 
vanish whilst you grasp them&#44; which are ineffectual when you 
lean on them for support. And although short my number of 
years&#44; and not extensive my experience&#44; I have seen that 
which must have called up thought in the most thoughtless&#44; 
had he too witnessed it. It was once&#44; that I was summoned to 
the dying bed of a rich man &#8212; he lay an object of commisera&#8211; 
tion&#44; such an object as would have moved the heart of the 
most unfeeling with pity&#59; his foaming mouth&#44; his lack&#8211;lustre 
eyes evidently betokened him a speedy food for worms&#44; and 
the wretched appointments of his couch seemed to say&#44; that

his labours for gold had been for others&#44; not for himself&#59; and 
what availetl him his riches&#63; nothing &#8212; for to alleviate his 
dreadful sufferings merely&#44; &#8212; to smooth for him the descent to 
death &#8212; was beyond the power of all medical skill&#44; and the 
leveller onlv of all human distinctions was able to relieve him 
from his misery &#8212; misery of which he himself was unconscious&#44; 
for the latter years of his life had been shrouded by total men&#8211; 
tal darkness. &#8212; And is it for this&#44; that we should never cease 
from labour&#63; is this the noble end for which all our faculties 
should be exerted&#63; is there nothing else besides for which we 
are to live&#63; &#8212; I grant&#44; that if our existence &#8212; our life &#8212; our be&#8211; 
ing &#8212; were limited to the brief three&#8211;score&#8211;and&#8211;ten &#8212; the short 
span of our days on earth &#8212; it would be unwise to check the 
counsel of cupidity&#44; if this cupidity were strong enough to 
make us believe&#44; that if blest with money we should have in 
our possession the highest good we are capable of attaining. 
But how stands the case&#44; if we take the light of revelation to 
examine thereby the dark intricacies of human life &#63; We are 
there told&#44; that the soul does not die&#44; that the human spirit is 
a portion breathed into man as a living undying spark&#44; in fact&#44; 
that the real essence of man is not composed of dust and matter 
and that this essence&#44; this spark divine&#44; is to be rewarded or 
punished according as the deeds done in the flesh may render 
it worthy or unworthy in the sight of the Righteous Judge in 
heaven&#44; before whom no concealment is possible&#44; before whose 
unerring wisdom no false excuses can avail &#33; Why then&#44; should 
we be so insatiable after wealth &#63; can it plead our justification 
at the day of judgment&#63; will it open to us the gates of heaven&#44; 
if it has only been acquired to be hoarded up to uncounted 
thousands&#63; Wo&#33; wo&#33; on the silly delusion that can blind a 
rational being to such an extent&#44; as to cause him to grasp at a 
shadow&#44; and to exclaim madly: &#34; I have caught the substance&#33;&#34; 
Honour&#63; Is this not an object worth seeking&#63; no more 
than riches &#59; for ask the student&#44; who has been striving for 
academical honours&#44; after his brow is encircled with the wreath 
of victory &#8212; ask him&#44; if his idol&#44; that which he so ardently

the bloom of youth whicia once flowed on his healthful cheek &#8212; 
the gay step &#8212; the manly bearing &#8212; the vigour of health &#8212; are

who through a long life has basked in the sunshine of public 
favour&#44; if he is blest according to his wishes : and he will 
answer you&#44; that a long life of anxiety&#44; of continual vigilance&#44; 
of abuse by opponents &#8212; of insufficient aid by friends &#8212; of fear 
of losing the office in which one has been efficient and ener&#8211; 
getic &#8212; can never be repaid by any honours in the power of 
man to confer&#44; and that only a sense of shame or pride&#44; or per&#8211; 
haps necessity&#44; produced by having long since yielded more 
profitable&#44; though more humble employment&#44; has for many a 
long day been the only motive which prevented him from with&#8211;

and the philosopher&#44; if the meed of praise they have received&#44; 
gratifies fully their morbid appetite : and you will be told&#44; that 
happiness is not theirs. &#8212; Ask him&#44; who on many an embattled 
plain has met the foeman with unflinching bravery&#59; whose 
search for renown was ever unchecked by the fear of an in&#8211; 
stant death &#59; whom the phantom glory led on from battlement 
to battlement&#44; unswayed by opposing thousands &#59; ask him&#44; if 
the laurel crown&#44; which covers his brow&#44; sits easy there : and 
he will answer in the bitterness of his spirit&#44; that despite of 
toil&#44; of fatigue and dangers overcome&#44; of praise and rewards 
heaped upon him &#8212; he is as far removed&#42; from happiness&#44; as on 
that day&#44; when he first set out roused by his country&#39;s call&#44; 
with his youthful heart beating anxiously with joy and antici&#8211; 
pation at the prospect of glory before him. &#8212; These are the

these be the only trophies which shall remain after our death&#44; 
the sole memorials of our having been once here&#63; are these 
the noble objects for which we are to live &#63; were we placed 
here by the Deity for no other purpose&#63; did He create us&#44; that 
we should neglect all other pursuits&#63; &#8212; It is true&#44; that a mode&#8211; 
rate share of ambition&#44; a due desire to possess&#44; should be culti&#8211; 
vated&#59; for whilst in this life&#44; activity has been assigned to us 
by our Maker&#44; as one of the best virtues &#59; but as these feelings 
were intended for a holy purpose&#44; we should confine them with&#8211; 
in the limits of the holy law&#44; and be extremely cautious&#44; that 
our pursuits of wealth or renown may in nowise interfere with 
the duties which we primarily owe to the Creator. We should&#44; 
therefore&#44; be satisfied with the portion of riches and of honour 
which our honest and religious exertions can procure&#44; and if we 
cannot in this manner become rich and inordinately great&#44; we 
should reflect&#44; that&#44; as the Psalmist says: 

&#34;Better is a little for the righteous&#44; than the great riches are to the many 
sinners&#33;&#34; Psalm xxxvii. 16&#44; 

For man can be satisfied and contented&#44; and even more so&#44; 
with a small competency&#44; than with a great mass of wealth &#59; 
for he has not then the cares of losing such great hoards to dis&#8211; 
turb him&#44; which agitate even the wealthiest in the hour of suc&#8211; 
cess&#44; for no man can be secure in his possessions against all 
contingencies that can arise. And again&#44; it seldom happens&#44; 
perhaps never&#44; that good moral and religious conduct will de&#8211; 
prive a man of his daily bread &#59; and this is enough for neces&#8211; 
sity&#44; more is but superfluous. &#8212; It is no doubt true&#44; that if we 
are rich&#44; we are more able to bestow charity&#44; to relieve the 
sick&#44; and to do other acts of mercy&#59; again&#44; if we are more 
honoured in the opinion of the world&#44; we can assist the op&#8211; 
pressed better with our countenance and support&#44; than other&#8211; 
wise. All this is true &#59; but then we should consider&#44; that it 
must be wrong to commit any sin&#44; any thing bad in the eyes of 
God to attain these objects of virtue &#59; for observe&#44; none of you 
is bound to give the smallest trifle in the way of charity&#44; if he&#44; 
in order to give it&#44; would be compelled to steal it first &#59; thus

chanty becomes a duty only then&#44; when we have something to 
give&#44; and if we cannot give&#44; our Maker will not require it &#59; 
for if it had been his wish that we should exert ourselves in 
this particular virtue&#44; He would have given us the means&#44; by 
prospering our undertakings at the periods allotted to us by 
Him for labour. &#8212; If we find&#44; therefore&#44; that we cannot become 
rich and renowned in the ways of religion&#44; we should choose 
to live poor and unhonoured rather than transgress&#59; for we 
shall then have the consciousness at least of having merited the 
grace of God&#44; and this consciousness&#44; this holy satisfaction&#44; 
will calm for us the storms of life&#44; and make joyful for us the 
hour of death : and are these not objects worth attaining&#44; more 
than gold and silver&#63; which should man prefer&#44; the peace with&#8211; 
in or the senseless glitter without&#63; 

Having thus answered the vague fears of the wavering&#44; let 
us next examine&#44; whether it is true that no immutable princi&#8211; 
ple of right is encroached upon by irreligion. &#8212; Persons&#44; deter&#8211; 
mined to transgress&#44; generally plead in the first instance&#44; that 
necessity compels them&#44; and in the second&#44; that there is no 
harm in what they do. Now&#44; the cases&#44; where necessity really 
exists&#44; are of very rare occurrence &#59; but when they actually do 
arise&#44; and only then&#44; transgression may be extenuated&#44; but 
never completely justified. As&#44; however&#44; necessity&#44; at least 
absolute and unavoidable necessity&#44; can from its very nature be 
of but short duration &#40;for it would be wonderful&#44; if a man were 
to be compelled by outward circumstances to act unavoidably 
in one way all his life or a greater portion of it): it follows&#44; 
that if any thing like the transgression&#44; done under the pressure 
of circumstances&#44; be continued to be done when the pressure 
is wholly or in part removed&#44; it cannot be justified under the 
same plea&#44; and consequently&#44; that which was at first excusable 
has now become a deed of wanton iniquity. Let us state an 
example : A man journeys in the wilderness with a caravan 
that travels on the Sabbath &#59; if he were to remain behind by 
himself&#44; it is but too probable that he would never reach the 
place of his destination&#44; unless by a miracle especially wrought 
in his favour. This then&#44; presents a case of necessity&#44; and the 
traveller is therefore excused from resting on the respective 
Sabbaths&#44; whilst he continues in the wilderness with the cara&#8211; 

    <pb n="127"/>

THE FEAR OF LOSS. 127 

van &#59; but as soon as he returns home&#44; or arrives at an inhabited 
country&#44; he is obliged to rest&#44; the necessity for the violation 
being no longer in existence. At the same time&#44; it must be 
observed&#44; that although the traveller in the desert is permitted 
to move from his place on the Sabbath&#44; he is nevertheless not 
allowed to do any kind of work&#44; since the necessity does not 
extend farther than to the particular act of removal. &#8212; If then&#44; 
a man pleads necessity to lull his conscience&#44; let him beware&#44; 
that the imagination be not resorted to&#44; to supply the principal 
features&#59; for otherwise&#44; his sinning will be unqualified and 
wilful transgression. &#8212; Secondly&#44; as to the other excuse : When 
blaming a man for not being strict in ceremonial observances&#44; 
we are often met by the questions : &#34; Do you not call him a 
good man&#63; does he not pay his debts&#63; is he not charitable&#63; 
is he not&#44; in short&#44; careful of observing all those duties vvhich 
can be called the immutable and eternal principles of religion&#63;&#34; 
You will observe here&#44; brethren&#44; that as long as a man is honest 
and charitable&#44; he is supposed&#44; by the general run of men&#44; to 
have done all that can be demanded of him. It remains&#44; there&#8211; 
fore&#44; to be inquired &#59; &#34; What constitutes a good man &#63; what are 
the immutable principles of religion &#63;&#34; To these questions Ave 
answer : that a good man is he&#44; who&#44; in all his doings&#44; looks to 
the law of God for his guide&#44; &#8212; does not offend against either 
the ceremonial or moral ordinances of the same&#44; and acts thus 
from motives of love and fear of God&#44; without ostentation or 
worldly interest. One&#44; who does not act up to this standard&#44; 
cannot&#44; strictly speaking&#44; be considered in a more favourable 
view&#44; than as having more or less good traits in his character&#59; 
but a good man he is not. &#8212; If now there be no one&#44; who acts 
altogether correctly in the majority of instances&#44; we can with 
propriety call no one good&#44; although it must be maintained&#44; 
that men there are&#44; who actually deserve the name&#44; as far as 
weak mortals can ever be entitled to it. &#8212; Next&#44; as to what are 
immutable truths&#63; We answer&#44; that every law&#44; &#8212; every pre&#8211; 
cept in the Bible&#44; is an immutable truth in reference to an 
Israelite&#44; of which he is bound to practise as much as he pos&#8211; 
sibly can. If there were any difference between one precept 
and the other&#44; it could be from no other reason&#44; than that one 
should have proceeded from a source more eternal and more 

    <pb n="128"/>

immutable than the other. &#8212; But&#44; what is the fact&#63; Evidently 
that all the commandments have sprung from the same source&#44; 
in evidence of which I tender you the ten comniand&#39;tnents. In 
a preceding discourse&#44; I have proved&#44; that human wisdom&#44; 
unaided by the word of God&#44; cannot lay claim to have invented 
one single item of any moral law&#44; but that all the systems which 
regulate civilized society have proceeded from&#44; and are based 
upon the Decalogue&#44; or&#44; as it may be&#44; upon revelation antece&#8211; 
dent to the period of their promulgation. It is&#44; therefore&#44; un&#8211; 
necessary to enlarge upon the same argument again in this place&#44; 
and to prove the divine authority of the law &#59; I say&#44; therefore&#44; 
that to establish the sanctity of all the laws&#44; I will offer you the 
ten commandments in evidence. There we see placed side by 
side: &#34; I am the Lord thy God&#44;&#34; with &#34; Thou shalt not mur&#8211; 
der &#59; &#34; Thou shalt have no other Gods besides me&#44;&#34; with 
&#34;Thou shalt not commit adultery&#59;&#34; &#34; Thou shalt not bear the 
name of God in vain&#44;&#34; with &#34; Thou shalt not steal &#59;&#34; &#34; Re&#8211; 
member the Sabbath to keep it holy&#59;&#34; with &#34;Thou shalt not 
bear false evidence&#59;&#34; &#34; Honour thy father and thy mother&#44;&#34; 
with &#34; Thou shalt not covet.&#34; In this arrangement we must 
discover&#44; that the Almighty did not draw the least distinction 
between one commandment and the other&#59; what then confers 
authority upon any one of us&#44; or even upon us all collectively&#44; 
to assert&#44; that one religious duty is more necessary than the 
other&#63; Perhaps&#44; it may be said&#44; that the ordinances recorded 
on the second table&#44; are to be styled more immutable than the 
others&#44; because they relate to the peace of society&#59; but this 
objection is as little founded in reason as thfe preceding&#44; ones. 
For even admit&#44; that civil laws deserve&#44; according to their 
nature&#44; more regard than mere ceremonial laws&#44; still it is to be 
shown in what way the former can really have hold upon the 
public mind&#44; if not in connexion with the service&#44; the love and 
fear of God. &#8212; Consider&#44; brethren&#44; what makes us observe 
any law or regulation whatever&#44; which lays some restraint upon 
our conduct&#44; &#8212; say even the laws of etiquette &#8212; evidently&#44; either 
the fear of punishment&#44; or the expectation of reward. &#8212; Now&#44; 
if we think&#44; that one principle of the law is more binding than 
the other&#44; it follows&#44; that the infraction of the minor principle 
will not bring any evil consequence&#44; or at worst&#44; the punish&#8211;

ment will be much slighter than for the non&#8211;observance of the 
greater duty. Let this idea once prevail&#44; let us once imagine&#44; 
that the Almighty will look with indifference or complacency 
upon sin of any kind&#44; and the consequence must be&#44; that any 
excuse whatever will suffice to seduce us to sin. Once tell the 
world&#44; that one sin will be punished&#44; the other not&#44; and you 
make men believe&#44; that every act will pass unheeded of heavenly 
vengeance&#59; and where there is no punishment for transgression&#44; 
there can be no reward for observing&#44; and you thus break down 
every motive for piety and morality. And suppose now&#44; that 
a man is in a situation&#44; where he is next to sure&#44; that detection 
is beyond probability&#44; and that the gain to be derived from 
offending against what are called the laws of society counter&#8211; 
balances every consideration which the fear of accidental dis&#8211; 
covery can raise within him : what will operate here to restrain 
him from violating these very immutable laws of morality&#63; 
have you not told him&#44; or at least induced him to think&#44; that 
divine vigilance need not be feared &#8212; for if this is to be feared&#44; 
why should the non&#8211;observance of the Sabbath be not equally 
incurring God&#39;s displeasure as want of honesty &#8212; since both are 
spoken of in the same Decalogue&#63; We must&#44; therefore&#44; con&#8211; 
clude&#44; relying upon the divine origin of the Mosaic code&#44; that 
the laws of worship&#44; as well as those of society&#44; are equally 
holy&#44; equally binding&#44; and equally beneficial. &#8212; If then&#44; we 
once admit&#44; that the possession of a competency is all that is 
necessary for man&#44; if we acknowledge&#44; that it is sinful to en&#8211; 
deavour to acquire riches and honour at the expense of religion: 
it will follow&#44; that it is our duty&#44; and as reasonable beings we 
are compelled&#44; to regard as holy&#44; and to practise all the princi&#8211; 
ples of the Israelitish law&#44; if even they should cause us tem&#8211; 
poral loss and inconvenience. Yes&#44; brethren&#33; discard the in&#8211; 
jurious counsels of avarice from your bosom&#44; no matter in what 
shape it may present itself to entice you into evil &#59; and believe 
at all times and under all circumstances in the word of promise&#44; 
spoken through the mouth of the sweet Singer of Israel :

To the ever&#8211;kind Father of his people&#44; who has so often 
displayed his mercy to his children&#44; be praise and glory&#44; from 
now to &#44;&#39;dl eternity &#33; Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 
If we examine the occurrences of life&#44; and search into the 
causes of the events with which our experience has made us 
familiar&#44; we will often find&#44; that the best laid plans were fre&#8211; 
quently frustrated by small causes&#44; and that&#44; no matter how 
much a man had guarded every avenue of his enterprise&#44; some 
mischance or other yet crept in to mar the entire structure of 
his brain. All experience therefore proves&#44; that no one is safe 
against the evils which beset human life&#44; and that&#44; however 

    <pb n="131"/>

THE FESTIVAL OF PURIM. 131 

exalted&#44; every child of Adam is liable to the same misfortunes 
as the humblest and meanest of our species. Many a one per&#8211; 
haps consulted the experience of past ages&#44; obtained the assist&#8211; 
ance of the powerful and wise&#44; and employed all the strength 
and ingenuity of his own towering genius : and yet the event 
disappointed his high expectations&#44; and he was compelled to 
yield his enterprise before he had even approached the desired 
consummation. Nothing&#44; consequently&#44; is more firmly esta&#8211; 
blished by thousands of examples&#44; than the words of Solomon 
in the book of Proverbs &#40;xvi. 33) : 

&#34; In the lap the lot is thrown&#44; but the decision comes from the Lord.&#34; 

And well it is that thus the faculties of man are organized by 
God&#44; that thus his sphere of action is limited by Superior Power&#59; 
for if it were permitted to the good to lay plans for the im&#8211; 
provement of their fellow&#8211;beings&#44; and to execute them with 
uniform good success : the same power to do evil would of ne&#8211; 
cessity then belong to the wicked&#44; and they would thus trium&#8211; 
phantly do their deeds of mischief&#44; unless a special providence 
of God should interpose at the consummation of any deed of 
wickedness to prevent any evil to accrue therefrom. But as it 
now is&#44; that man cannot calculate with certainty upon the issue 
of any event&#44; since the whole future is alike hidden from all : 
the good can attempt their works of kindness and rely with a 
well&#8211;founded hope upon the assistance of God &#59; anil no man 
need fear too greatly the power of the sinners&#44; seeing that their 
fate is controlled by the same kind Being&#44; who manifested him&#8211; 
self to his adorers as the Almighty God&#44; and as the Power from 
whom all the strength of all existing things is derived. If then 
man complains of his weakness&#44; it behoves him to consider&#44; 
that his safety&#44; while in this state of existence&#44; is mainly owing 
to this very weakness &#59; since every one of all who surround 
him&#44; of all who have preceded him&#44; of all who will follow him&#44; 
is&#44; has been&#44; or will be&#44; as much circumscribed in his power of 
evil&#44; as he is&#44; who so bitterly complains of the apparent injus&#8211; 
tice and hardship at finding himself so constantly checked by 
obstacles in his undertakings. And unless human nature were 

    <pb n="132"/>

132 THE FESTIVAL OF PURIM. 

changed&#44; that is to say&#44; unless every individual of the human 
family could be induced by internal impulse to do that only 
which is good in the eyes of God and man&#44; or in other words&#44; 
unless man would cease to be man : it would in effect be aban&#8211; 
doning the weaker and more unsuspicious to the caprice and 
tyranny of the fierce and designing&#44; if the Almighty were to 
o&#8211;ive to man a greater power over his own destinies than he 
now possesses. Who then will not discover&#44; in this very cir&#8211; 
cumstance&#44; as well as in every other of our organization&#44; that 
all we know of is ordained in a manner which no foresight nor 
experience of ours could improve&#63; 

&#34; But why&#44;&#34; asks some one&#44; &#34; do we so often see the pious 
abandoned for a time to the evil designs of the wicked&#44; before 
he is overtaken by divine vengeance&#63; Why triumphs so often 
the ungodly&#44; and for so long a period&#44; over the righteous suf&#8211; 
ferer&#63;&#34; To these seemingly startling questions of the doubter&#44; 
so often asked with the melancholy shake of distrust in divine 
Providence&#44; we can easily find answers&#44; if we only dive a little 
beneath the surface of things&#44; and endeavour to trace the rea&#8211; 
sons for God&#39;s rule on earth&#44; without rashly presuming to dis&#8211; 
cover his impenetrable counsels. Let us examine the conduct 
of even the best man&#44; or of the best set of men that ever ex&#8211; 
isted&#44; and we shall find that some fault was yet theirs&#44; that in 
some cases they proved themselves flesh and blood &#59; for with 
reverence to the illustrious dead we must confess&#44; that Abra&#8211; 
ham&#44; Jacob and Moses&#44; in some few instances&#44; departed from 
the rule which they themselves acknowledged as the only road 
to salvation for them. This in nowise derogates the least from 
the proud pre&#8211;eminence&#44; by which they stand so much above 
the rest of mankind&#44; for it was consonant with their nature&#44; that 
they who had not yet laid aside the tenements of clay in which 
their pure souls were bound up&#44; should sometimes&#44; though sel&#8211; 
dom&#44; or perhaps once only in their life&#44; pay the forfeit of their 
not being&#44; according to their nature&#44; free from a temptation to 
sin. 

Again &#59; since man is constituted a free agent by divine suf&#8211; 
ferance&#44; and since no force is laid on any of his inclinations&#44; 
save it be through the warning voice of revelation&#44; and by 
paternal chastisement: it is unavoidable that wicked men 

    <pb n="133"/>

THE FESTIVAL OF PURIM. 133 

should at times arise&#44; aye&#44; even those&#44; whom we&#44; from their 
great dissimilarity to ourselves style a disgrace to human 
nature. Then again we must discover&#44; that the very supe&#8211; 
riority of the good over the bad makes the former obnoxious 
to the latter. Now it is this antipathy which is often made by 
God the instrument to act as a punishment to those who fear 
Him&#44; when they give way to their inclinations&#44; and stray in 
some degree from the path of their duty. &#8212; Here then we have 
the solution to the fearful inquiries of the wavering. The right&#8211; 
eous has sinned&#44; and immediately the wicked has the power 
conferred to harm him for a season &#59; and as long as the latter 
keeps within bounds&#44; and heaps no more evil upon the other 
than he ought to bear for his sins&#44; we cannot arraign divine 
justice for suffering the temporary triumph &#59; but as soon as the 
sufferings of the good exceed their just measure&#44; we have thou&#8211; 
sands of examples to prove that divine assistance is not with&#8211; 
held&#44; that divine vengeance is not stayed&#44; the moment the 
intention of the wicked becomes manifest&#44; &#34; to swallow &#40;to 
use the language of Holy Writ) him who is more righteous 
than he.&#34; And if we ask for a striking illustration&#44; we can find 
one in the occasion of the festival of Purim&#44; which we are to 
celebrate at this very season. The history of the book of 
Esther is&#44; no doubt&#44; familiar to you all&#59; and we shall therefore 
notice only the principal features thereof&#44; for the sake&#44; merely&#44; 
of pointing out the connection of the circumstances narrated 
there&#44; and to apply it to prove the correctness of our assertion&#44; 
that the righteous&#44; though suffering&#44; will not be entirely aban&#8211; 
doned to the machination of the godless. The precise period 
of the history under consideration is not correctly ascertained : 
but in all probability&#44; or at least as some suppose&#44;&#42; it was aftei&#8211; 
the building of the second temple&#44; that a king of Persia&#44; whose 
dominions extended from the Ganges to the sources of the 
Nile&#44; gave a great entertainment to the inhabitants of his 
capital&#44; Susa &#59; during the progress of the feast&#44; as he was con&#8211; 

&#34;&#42;&#34; The Ahasveros mentioned in the Bible&#44; must have been subsequent to 
Cambyses&#44; who was the conqueror of Egypt &#59; for it is said : &#34; Ahasveros who 
reigned from Hodu to Cush.&#34; Does this not mean from India to Ethiopia &#63; 
May it not have been the eccentric and tyrannical Xerxes&#44; of whose strange 
exploits Grecian history is so full

siderably elated with wine&#44; he ordered that his wife should 
appear before the whole assembled multitude&#44; that all might be 
delighted with her beauty. The proud queen refused to obey 
the ridiculous command of her imperious lord&#44; who&#44; highly 
incensed&#44; consulted the chiefs of the empire concerning the 
punishment to be inflicted on her. Vashti was accordingly 
removed from the royal dignity&#44; to satisfy the king&#39;s resent&#8211; 
ment &#59; but he soon repented of the rash act&#44; and to compensate 
himself for the loss of her&#44; every female of note was gathered 
unto Susa to be submitted to his approval&#44; and at length he 
found the Jewess Esther the most pleasing in his eyes&#44; and she 
was declared queen instead of Vashti. The history of the 
exalted orphan presents some features for profound meditation&#59; 
and we cannot refuse our admiration to one &#40;no matter what 
her faults might have been) who gratefully recollected the 
kindness of her cousin Mordecai&#44; by whom she had been 
educated after the death of her parents&#44; although now raised 
to the highest honours which could be conferred on her &#59; 
as we read : &#34; And the command of Mordecai&#44; Esther did&#44; just 
as when she was under his charge.&#34; Mordecai soon after this 
time had an opportunity of being serviceable to the king&#44; by 
being instrumental in discovering the conspiracy of two cham&#8211; 
berlains against the life of their master&#59; for the present&#44; no 
reward was given to the unpretending Israelite&#44; who in likeli&#8211; 
hood was satisfied with having done no more than his duty in 
protecting the government under which he lived &#59; but this act 
of fidelity was entered upon the records of the empire&#44; and it 
was destined to become the cause of salvation to Mordecai and 
the whole remnant of Israel. It was not long after this last event&#44; 
that the king raised one Haman&#44; surnamed the Agagite&#44; to the 
office of chief minister of the empire : and commanded every 
one of his servants to pay due homage to the favourite by fall&#8211; 
ing down in the dust before him. Mordecai&#44; however&#44; refused 
to pay the servile tribute&#44; and having been noticed by the 
haughty Haman&#44; he was denounced as a Jew&#44; and as one 
rebellious to the commands of the king. Haman&#44; to avenge 
his insulted dignity&#44; did not think it sufficient to remove 
the hated Jew alone&#44; but also the whole Jewish people&#44; amongst 
whom Mordecai was&#44; probably&#44; a chief of high standing

But not having the power to do any act of violence without 
the king&#39;s consent&#44; he endeavoured to obtain this by flat&#8211; 
tering his cupidity and inflaming his resentment. Yet before 
he ventured on this step&#44; he threw lots&#44; to discover&#44; by diving 
into futurity&#44; which day would be the most propitious for the 
execution of his plans. The choice fell upon the thirteenth 
of the twelfth month &#59; and having thus discovered&#44; as he vainly 
imagined&#44; the most fatal day for the Jewish people&#44; he fancied 
that he was guarded from all disappointment in the execution 
of his project&#59; since&#44; as he thought&#44; he had ascertained to a 
surety the will of fate&#44; according to the superstitious notions of 
the heathens&#59; not believing that He&#44; who thrones alone in hea&#8211; 
ven&#44; directs all things&#44; as is best consonant with his wisdom. 
Haman having easily obtained the concurrence of the king&#44; and 
promulgated a decree in the name of the sovereign&#44; that on the 
thirteenth day of the twelfth month all Jews in all the pro&#8211; 
vinces of the empire should be slain and their property confis&#8211; 
cated for the use of the state&#44; or in other words for the benefit 
of Haman&#44; to whom the king had granted the right of proceed&#8211; 
ing with the Jews according to his pleasure. Already were the 
enemies of Israel rejoiced&#44; already were the swords unsheathed&#44; 
and with joyous anticipation our adversaries looked anxiously&#8211; 
for the coming of the fatal da)&#8211;. But in vain was their early 
joy&#44; for it had been otherwise ordained by the Father of his 
people&#44; and the most unexpected help rescued them from the 
imminent destruction. Esther had hitherto never revealed her 
origin or her people &#59; she lived securely in the king&#39;s palace&#44; 
unconscious of the danger which threatened the whole race of 
Jacob. Suddenly the news were brought to her&#44; that her be&#8211; 
loved kinsman was at the palace&#8211;gate in the habiliments of 
mourning. She sent to inquire the cause&#44; when the dreadful 
decree was transmitted to her by Mordecai&#44; who exhorted her 
to go to the king and supplicate him for the salvation of her 
people. But the arbitrary laws of the Persian empire made it 
a capital offence for any one to approach the king&#39;s presence 
without having been summoned &#59; and it had happened that the 
queen herself had not been called for the space of thirty days. 
She therefore sent in reply to Mordecai&#44; a representation of the 
great personal risk she would incur by the hazardous step which 

    <pb n="136"/>

he recommended. But Mordecai&#44; feeling a perfect confidence 
in God&#44; could not tolerate this expression of fear&#44; even in a 
woman &#59; he answered therefore in these memorable words : 
&#34; Imagine not in thy mind to escape in the king&#39;s palace alone 
of all the Jews. For if thou remainest silent at this time&#44; en&#8211; 
largement and help may arise to the Jews from elsewhere&#44; and 
thyself and thy father&#39;s house may perish &#59; and who knows&#44; 
but that thou hast reached the royal dignity for this emer&#8211; 
gency&#63;&#34; The queen needed no further admonition&#59; for the 
spark of enthusiastic confidence in God had been kindled&#44; and 
she ordered Mordecai to proclaim a fast for all the Jews in 
Susa&#44; in order that they might merit the favour of God by hu&#8211; 
miliating themselves before Him&#44; whom they had always found 
H sure support in the hour of trouble. The third day of the 
fast had already commenced&#44; but Esther had not yet been called&#59; 
still summoning all the fortitude which a righteous cause must 
inspire&#44; she clothed herself in royal garments&#44; and boldly ad&#8211; 
vanced to the inner court of the palace&#44; where the king was 
seated on his throne. The rising resentment at her boldness 
was soon changed into kindlier feelings&#44; and he held out to her 
the sceptre which he bore in his hand&#44; thus showing her&#44; by the 
customary sign of grace&#44; that her offence had been pardoned. 
Calculating correctly&#44; that Esther would hardly have risked 
her life&#44; unless she had a weighty request to prefer&#44; he offered 
her half his kingdom&#44; if she wished it &#59; but all she asked was&#44; 
that the king and Haman should partake of a repast in her own 
apartments. The king and Haman did as she had desired &#59; 
again Ahasveros repeated his magnificent offer&#44; and again she 
merely asked for a repetition of the favour granted her for the 
coming day. I need not relate to you the eventful occurrences 
of the following night and morning &#59; for you all doubtlessly 
know how Haman found himself already humbled before the 
man he so much hated&#44; when he was again summoned to attend 
the queen. Esther now delayed no longer to reveal to the 
king her people&#44; and in the most pathetic manner&#44; she begged 
for her own life and the salvation of her kindred race. The 
king evidently incensed at the daring unknown&#44; who had medi&#8211; 
tated the death of his wife&#44; demanded the name of the wretch&#44; 
and imagine his surprise when answered : &#34; This wicked Ha&#8211;

man &#33;&#34; His fate was now sealed&#44; and from the banquet he was 
led to the gibbet&#44; where he expiated with his life for the evil 
intended against the innocent. The decree against the Jews 
was repealed&#59; and the thirteenth of Adar&#44; on which their ene&#8211; 
mies had lioped to extirpate them&#44; was by the royal authority 
appointed as a day on which they might freely exercise ven&#8211; 
geance on those who had meditated their dovvnfal. We may 
perhaps regret&#44; that the Israelites of those days took so bloody 
a revenge&#44; but we should reflect into what misery these enemies 
had intended to plunge them&#59; how fierce their delight had been at 
the anticipated slaughter&#59; and that moreover the entire remnant 
of the people of God had been threatened with utter annihila&#8211; 
tion by those very men who afterwards fell beneath the sword 
of their intended victims. In this manner was Israel saved 
from the evil designs of Haman &#59; and the festival of Purim was 
instituted to celebrate annually the wonderful event&#44; and to re&#8211; 
turn at the recurrence of this season our thanks to our Deliverer&#44; 
who always came to our assistance&#44; when man rose up against 
us. But does not the fate of Haman teach us how watchful is 
the superintendence of God over the affairs of man &#8212; and how 
inefficient are all the cunningly devised plans of the proud and 
wicked to injure those who are too weak to protect themselves 
from the impending danger&#63; Little did Haman think&#44; that&#44; 
when he alone was invited to the queen&#39;s table&#44; he went to his 
death &#59; little did he imagine that the sons&#44; of whom he boasted&#44; 
would perish so soon after him&#59; little did he believe&#44; that Mor&#8211; 
decai&#44; for whom he had erected a scafibld&#44; would become the 
first officer of the king&#59; and yet all this did come to pass&#44; and 
ail Haman&#39;s art for evil was rendered as nought&#44; at the moment 
of his greatest seeming security. Truly may we say&#44; that 
&#34; the lot is thrown by man&#44; but that to God alone belongs the 
decision.&#34; If then&#44; oppressed one&#44; thou art suffering under 
severe affliction&#44; if thou seest thy best plans fail of their intended 
effect : let thy confidence nevertheless remain unshaken in the 
God by whose favour and will thou wert sent hither&#44; to earn 
for thyself on earth an immortal happiness. If thou seest the 
wicked flourish for a while&#44; if thou beholdest their power ex&#8211; 
tending wider and wider : fear thou not&#44; for they&#44; as well as 
thou&#44; have a limit set to their ambition&#44; and like the waves of

the ocean which are broken by the sand against which they 
dash so furiously&#44; the strength of the unrighteous is exhausted 
by the humble resistance which the moral force of the mind of 
the lowly good opposes to the fierce onset &#59; for this is the im&#8211; 
movable and wise decree of God. Cease therefore thy com&#8211; 
plaining&#44; son of the earth&#44; and be assured&#44; that if thy power be 
broken&#44; if thy strength be gone&#44; the powerful arm held out 
over thee for thy protection is one that is never wearied&#44; that 
the Providence that watches over thee is never tired. And if 
we as Israelites ask&#44; why are we left in servitude&#44; at so hope&#8211; 
less a distance from our own inheritance &#59; why do the nations 
triumph over the chosen people&#59; why have the shearers so often 
despoiled the lonely sheep&#63; we must reply&#44; because this long 
captivity&#44; this seemingly hopeless suffering will and must teach 
us to place that confidence in God&#44; as our sole Protector and 
Saviour&#44; which we failed to do when we were in our own land : 
for we have since our dispersion been taught that our Father 
yet lives&#44; although we have been banished from his favourite 
abode. We cannot despair of a coming redemption&#44; if we will 
but reflect from how many dangers we have escaped &#59; how often 
the net was rent asunder which was spread to ensnare our un&#8211; 
steady feet. And therefore&#44; brethren&#44; our hope must be strong. 
our faith must be unshaken&#44; if the temporary evils be ever so 
great&#59; for we have the promise of God&#44; of Him who never 
wavers&#44; that a mother may sooner cast off the child of her own 
body&#44; than that He would forsake the nation which He once 
chose as his peculiar treasure before the eyes of all the world &#33; 
God&#44; Thou who lookest down from thy unbounded realms 
of greatness upon the humble and the lowly&#44; that walk before 
Thee in meekness : have compassion once more&#44; in thy grace&#44; 
upon the smallest of nations&#44; and display again to them thy 
miraculous power&#44; as in those days when Thou ledst them forth 
from the land of Egypt&#44; to follow thy guidance into the wil&#8211; 
derness&#44; where Thou didst give them thy law through Moses 
thy servant &#33; Amen.

REWARD AND PUNISHMENT. 

Almighty Protector&#44; whose eye surveyeth all&#44; whose 
foresight careth for all&#44; whose power reigneth over all&#44; shield&#44; 
protect and save us from all evil&#44; and ward off from us all 
affliction&#33; Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 
In whatever we undertake of worldly matters&#44; our object 
will be to obtain some position good&#44; or to ward off some de&#8211; 
finite evil &#59; for no matter how much this reason may be con&#8211; 
cealed by others&#44; which we perhaps ourselves may imagine to 
be the real causes : still the desire for some absolute advantage 
is&#44; I may freely say always&#44; the chief motive which prompts 
our action. Thus we see the merchant crossing the stormy 
ocean for the sake of augmenting his wealth &#59; the philosopher 
pursuing his studies&#44; to perfect his discoveries&#59; the warrior 
braving all peril in search of glory: &#8212; and on the other hand 
we see a man submitting himself to the knife of the surgeon to 
be cured of a disease &#59; and the weak overstraining his exhaust&#8211; 
ed strength to escape from impending danger. It is in truth&#44; 
the principle of self&#8211;love&#44; implanted in us for the wise of

purposes&#44; which is ever active to impel us to reach whatever is 
agreeable to our mind &#59; and if it is exercised under proper limi&#8211; 
tations&#44; it must be the means of making us as good and useful 
as we were intended to be by the Almighty&#44; and we shall be 
such men as will be benefactors and guides to our species. &#8212; 
Self&#8211;love is in this respect then essentially different from selfish&#8211; 
ness&#59; since the first looks towards gratifying the mind as well 
as the body&#44; the latter only towards yielding to the brutal de&#8211; 
sires and feelings inherent to man. If&#44; therefore&#44; we find a 
man always striving to gratify himself only&#44; even at the ex&#8211; 
pense of the rights and feelings of others : we may freely pro&#8211; 
nounce him one with whom the candid and upright will avoid 
all intercourse and connexion&#44; since self is to him the greatest 
and dearest object in the world. But if a man respects the 
same rights in others&#44; which he wishes to enjoy for himself&#44; if 
he looks around to gratify the finer feelings of humanity&#44; which 
proceed from a tender sensibility and a sympathy for the wants 
and sufferings of others : we then say&#44; that he is one&#44; that loves 
his species&#44; and the refined love he bears to himself&#44; impels 
him to .make others around him happy&#44;&#42; at the expense even 
of personal inconvenience. According to this exposition&#44; a 
selfish man can never be good&#44; since he only lives for himself&#59; 
and a man of sensibility only can act up to the duties required 
of him&#44; inasmuch as he loves those also&#44; who like him&#44; were 
created after God&#39;s own image &#59; and because he looks upon 
himself&#44; as a member of the human family at large&#44; and subject 
to the same regulations&#44; which the Creator thought fit to pro&#8211; 
mulgate for the benefit of all&#44; and the safety of every individual. 
The indulgence of the passions&#44; the rioting in debaucheries&#44; the 
imbruing of hands in human blood&#44; are the characteristics of the 
former &#59; active benevolence&#44; however&#44; humility and piety those

the sentiments expressed above should have&#44; so long ago&#44; struck so great a 
mind as Pope&#39;s.

of the latter &#59; the one degrades humanity to the level of the 
brute&#59; the other proves&#44; that in all&#44; save mortality&#44; he is but a 
little less than angels. &#8212; Yet&#44; as our ideas are from the moment 
of our birth continually and irresistibly drawn to the grati&#8211; 
fication of our bodily wants: it is very natural&#44; nay&#44; unavoid&#8211; 
able&#44; that we should strive to obtain the positive worldly good 
and to avoid absolute bodily evil. Thus&#44; we should unhesitat&#8211; 
ingly call any one a madman&#44; who would try to persuade us&#44; 
that it would be conducive to our comfort&#44; to remain the whole 
day immersed up to the chin in water&#44; or that the flesh of 
carrion could furnish us with delicious food &#59; for our experience&#44; 
our taste&#44; or our feeling&#44; would demonstrate the fallacy of such 
notions&#44; and the aberration from our usually entertained opi&#8211; 
nions of the physical reformer would strike as an evidence of 
his being of unsound mind. In this way we are taught by 
taste and experience to satisfy the cravings of nature&#44; in a 
manner the most agreeable to our disposition and organization. 
The food&#44; therefore&#44; which every human being is obliged to take 
to preserve his existence&#44; is various according to the tastes and 
habits of various individuals or even nations. The garments&#44; 
too&#44; with which we cover ourselves must&#44; to a greater or less 
degree&#44; be adapted to the season and climate &#59; and the pursuits 
of man must also be regulated&#44; as far as physical strength is 
concerned&#44; according to his ability of enduring fatigues and 
deprivations. Likewise&#44; feeling and experience will soon teach&#44; 
that to plunge a finger into the fire will cause pain &#59; and&#44; un&#8211; 
doubtedly&#44; if a savage should accidentally have scalded himself 
from an utter ignorance of the efiects of boiling water upon the 
skin&#44; he will be more circumspect with its use for the future&#44; 
since experience has now taught him to dread the unpleasant 
and painful result. It is needless to exemplify so obvious a pro&#8211; 
position at greater length&#44; and it was only touched upon to 
show in the sequel its application to moral actions. &#8212; To pro&#8211; 
ceed : whatever pursuits we engage in&#44; we must have an 
especial and specific object in view&#44; though even to ourselves 
this object may not be so defined&#44; as to enable us to explain 
our sensation to others. &#8212; If we enter into mercantile specula&#8211; 
tions&#44; our object is&#44; to a certainty&#44; gain in the first instance&#44; be 
this for our own benefit or that of others. &#8212; The man of learn&#8211;

jng would&#44; in all probability&#44; forsake his studies&#44; if he were 
convinced&#44; that the end of all his endeavours would be an igno&#8211; 
minious death&#44; after a life spent in the most dreadful privations&#44; 
and that his name should be buried in total oblivion. &#8212; The 
soldier would certainly never strive to signalize himself&#44; if he 
had not some hopes that his name would be honourably men&#8211; 
tioned in the records of history. The evident objects which 
these and many others have in view are self&#8211;aggrandizement 
and notoriety&#59; and even if these are not the sole springs of 
action&#44; they are&#44; nevertheless&#44; the primary causes to a certain 
extent at least. Now&#44; where the effect is apparent and imme&#8211; 
diate&#44; and the enjoyment of the desired end in a measure cer&#8211; 
tain : the energies of our nature will be strongly urged to for&#8211; 
ward the accomplishment by all means possible to us &#59; and some 
of you have probably experienced&#44; how&#44; after making great 
exertions for the attainment of any object&#44; you became the more 
energetic the more you approached the wished&#8211;for consumma&#8211; 
tion. It seems&#44; that the almost expiring power receives a new 
access&#44; as the end comes into view&#44; and this enables us to over&#8211; 
come difficulties once considered as insurmountable. &#8212; And since 
the advantages of riches are apparent&#44; and the beneficial results 
of fame and standing obvious to all: we see every mortal en&#8211; 
deavouring his utmost to equal those who are at ease and ho&#8211; 
noured around him&#44; and no exertion is considered too great&#44; 
which will place a man at the height of human power. Nay&#44; 
crimes are pardoned to a successful sinner &#59; and what in a hum&#8211; 
ble transgressor is called treason or murder&#44; is styled patriotism 
and heroic greatness&#44; if success has crowned the efforts of the 
wily demagogue. We&#44; therefore&#44; need not manifest any asto&#8211; 
nishment&#44; that riches are eagerly sought or honours ardently 
coveted&#44; if it were that life was given merely to enable us to 
become rich and great. But if this were the sole object of God 
in creating man&#44; how unequally would his favours then be 
distributed&#33; how many would then be wronged out of their 
rightful portion&#44; unless we could imagine&#44; that the world was 
made for the sole purpose of enabling a handful to become pos&#8211; 
sessed of great wealth&#44; and a few others to share amongst them&#8211; 
selves all the honours and power incident to man. This idea &#8212; 
that all was made for them &#8212; may well suit the proud and arro&#8211;

their habitations amidst the stars&#59; but never would it be conso&#8211; 
nant with divine goodness&#44; never could this have been the in&#8211; 
tention of the God&#44; kind to all&#44; before whom the greatest of 
the earth are but as dust&#44; and before whom&#44; praised be his 
name for evermore&#33; the poor and the rich&#44; the weak and the 
strong&#44; the foolish as much as the wisest&#44; are alike&#33; No &#8212; never 
for such purposes &#8212; to gain riches and acquire greatness was 
life dispensed to so many millions of intelligent creatures &#59; but 
for the end of leading them on to greater happiness&#44; to the per&#8211; 
manent and unfading bliss&#44; which was for ever destined to be 
the reward of virtue. Here is a thenie to dwell on with de&#8211; 
light&#44; this is an idea from which we never can turn away but 
with an entire and heartfelt satisfaction &#59; for the knowledge of 
its truth fully demonstrates that&#44; in what is really essential&#44; all 
men have been truly created equal &#59; since to be virtuous according 
to our means&#44; and to be blessed if we have done all we could 
accomplish&#44; are objects within the reach of every one that ever 
was sent on earth &#59; and thus actually we may maintain&#44; that a 
perfect equality of gifts has been conferred&#44; although in out&#8211; 
ward circumstances and in the distribution of outward bless&#8211; 
ings there appears an inequality&#44; which however&#44; was so or&#8211; 
dained for a wise and beneficial purpose. And yet we see&#44; that 
the power and glory of outward and mortal life are so inordi&#8211; 
nately coveted &#59; and why&#63; solely because they are more appa&#8211; 
rent than spiritual advantages&#44; and to a great degree actually 
necessary for our preservation &#59; and these causes induce a mnu 
to persevere in their acquisition&#44; even after all reasonable 
wants have been abundantly satisfied&#44; and to disregard the 
benefits which the pursuit of religion will confer on his 
undying soul. No moralist &#8212; it may be conceded &#8212; if he is a 
real friend to his species&#44; will ever inculcate&#44; that a man should 
not seek the means of an honest competency&#59; no one&#44; who lays 
a just value upon the true glory of an honourable and revered 
name&#44; can&#44; consistently with religion&#44; teach&#44; that it would be 
safe to disregard public opinion&#44; and to make oneself ridiculous 
by eccentricity or an overbearing contempt of&#44; and supercilious 
demeanour towards&#44; others&#59; no&#44; religion asks not self&#8211;denial of

session of a good name&#44; and recommend industry and perse&#8211; 
verance &#59; nay more&#44; wealtii and fame are considered and held 
up to view as blessings to be desired&#44; but always to be sought 
under the limitations of God&#39;s holy&#44; everlasting&#44; and unchange&#8211; 
able law. Thus it is certainly true&#44; that the benefits arising 
from the observance of the Sabbath and festivals are not so appa&#8211; 
rent as the loss resulting therefrom&#44; if we view the subject only 
in a pecuniary light. But admitting this to its fullest extent&#44; 
does it not strike you nevertheless&#44; that the infringement of the 
law has its source in base and mean selfishness&#63; for what noble 
feeling is gratified by Sabbath&#8211;breaking&#63; Does it promote the 
welfare of the communify &#63; Is the mind of the individual him&#8211; 
self improved by seeking gain instead of the favour of God &#63; 
Admit again&#44; that money spent in charity and the maintainance 
of religious establishments &#8212; when&#44; as given among us&#44; owing to 
the small number of our people&#44; ambitious views and thirst for 
distinction cannot be gratified thereby &#8212; admit I say&#44; that 
money thus spent is to all intents and purposes a diminution of 
our wealth by as much as is given: still&#44; is this enough to pre&#8211; 
vent a man from exercising the most amiable feelings of human 
nature&#63; Is the loss of a little money sufficient to excuse 
him from dispensing blessings around him to those who 
need his assistance&#63; Should this induce him to refuse contri&#8211; 
buting his portion towards the endowment of places of public 
worship and general instruction&#63; Yet there are&#44; unfortunately&#44; 
many of ample means who contribute little or nothing to pro&#8211; 
mote the religion of their ancestors&#44; who suffer the indigent to 
beg in vain&#44; intent only on Increasing their heaps of gold&#44; and 
augmenting their importance and power &#59; and still they claim 
the name of being good&#44; and arrogate to themselves the dis&#8211; 
tinction of being kindly disposed to the community &#59; and there 
are not wanting those who will&#44; fawning upon the rich&#44; concede 
virtues to them&#44; which they could never discover in the poor. 
But who can in justice call that man good&#44; who closes his 
eyes to the distress of the needy &#63; who can praise the public 
spirit and piety of him&#44; who suffers the house of God to fall 
into ruins&#44; sees with composure the poor remaining unin&#8211; 
structed&#44; when his mite freely given might perchance resusci&#8211; 
tate the falling cause&#44; by inducing others to follow his example

of liberality &#63; Every sensible person will condemn so mean 
and grovelling a spirit&#44; who is guilty of minding his own 
personal interest and convenience regardless of the general 
good &#59; and if he expresses in words ever so much interest for 
the wants of his fellow&#8211;man&#44; no one will value them in the 
least whilst his deeds do not correspond with his professions. 
In short&#44; we willingly acknowledge that religious duties are 
seldom of that nature&#44; that wealth and personal ease are pro&#8211; 
moted by them &#59; neither charity nor the observance of the fes&#8211; 
tivals brings any gain&#44; which we can count &#59; to visit the sick&#44; 
to attend at the couch of suffering&#44; and to watch with the dead&#44; 
are tasks upon our convenience &#59; but&#44; setting all considerations 
of a disinterested practice of duty out of sight&#44; who knows but 
that our being rich and at ease may depend solely and exclu&#8211; 
sively upon our attention to these duties&#63; We all have felt&#44; 
that no man is safe in his possessions&#59; that the greatest wealth 
can be dissipated&#44; and the most powerful one may be humbled &#59; 
and as thus we know not how long and by what tenure we may 
be permitted to hold our property from God&#44; would it not be 
wise and prutlent to obey Him&#44; carefully and implicitly&#44; even if 
nothing but worldly interest were to instruct us&#63; Now grant 
then&#44; that wealth and honours are the greatest gifts which the 
Almighty can bestow on mortals&#44; it becomes evidently the 
more necessary for those that are timid and unconfidino&#8211; to be 
the more strictly on their guard with reference to obedience to 
the will of God&#44; so that they may be always held deserving of 
being left in possession of their acquired or inherited riches 
and power. But who is bold enough to say&#44; that there is 
nothing more costly in this world&#44; than the most successful 
fruits of avarice and ambition &#63; who will assert that the great&#8211; 
est miser and the greatest despot are the happiest of men &#63; And 
yet&#44; unless the persons who possess wealth and power in their 
greatest extent were the happiest&#44; wealth and power cannot 
confer the utmost happiness to which we can attain in this life 
of probation. &#34; What then is the greatest good&#63;&#34; To this we 
answer&#44; piety towards God and love towards our fellow&#8211;beings: 
these are blessings which the humblest can enjoy to as great a 
degree as the most powerful&#44; of which the foolish can partake&#44; 
though of necessity in a somewhat more limited sphere&#44; as well

as the wisest. And enter once the humble dwelling of the lowly 
pious&#44; and though wealth may be absent&#44; though no splendour 
surrounds him&#44; though the toil by which he lives must be daily 
renewed&#44; though his name is unknown beyond his own neigh&#8211; 
bourhood : be assured&#44; nevertheless&#44; that he bears that within 
him&#44; which is to be prized beyond all wealth&#44; beyond all glit&#8211; 
ter valuable. Watch him as he steps over his threshhold after 
a day of labour&#44; behold his good housewife approaching him 
with their infant on her arm&#44; see another child clinging around 
his knee in childish ecstacy &#59; and now observe his eye turned 
upwards with tearful but glad adoration to Heaven for the truly 
happy lot which is his by the blessing of the Supreme : and 
then say&#44; what&#44; compared to such a state&#44; is all the pomp of 
wealth and power&#44; where envy and hatred often assume the 
mask of love and friendship&#44; to beguile the miserable remnant 
of mortality of his anger&#44; that he may not bestow on others the 
estate&#44; which they&#44; his heirs&#44; expect to come in possession of at 
his decease. &#8212; Now grant&#44; therefore&#44; for argum.ent&#39;s sake&#44; that the 
pleasures and blessings of wealth and power are visible and 
tangible to a much greater degree than those &#8211;of piety : it 
behoves us&#44; nevertheless&#44; to throw in the opposite scale the 
anxiety and vexation incident to worldly greatness&#44; and that to 
piety there are joined blessings and pleasures which the former 
can never impart. &#8212; Thus much may be said&#44; even without 
adverting to the outwardly unseen and unfelt promises&#44; which 
Scriptures record to the advantage of the good&#59; since if life were 
even to terminate with our death&#44; there is yet sufficient reason 
for preferring piety and the observance of religious duties to 
any other pursuit&#44; because of the satisfaction and the sublime 
tranquillity of the mind which accompany them. But there 
are happier&#44; higher&#44; and more enduring fruits of goodness&#44; 
which sooner or later will become the portion of the worship&#8211; 
ers of God &#8212; and let others triumph in their wickedness&#44; let the 
good soever bow before the powerful sinner &#8212; there is a period&#44; 
and come it will&#44; when the film will be drawn IVom the sight 
of the wilfully blind&#44; when their infatuation will vanish&#44; but 
when&#44; alas &#33; it will be too late to remedy the evil which has 
been once and irretrievably committed &#33; &#8212; Yes brethren&#44; it was 
even in the time of the prophets&#44; that there lived many who

pointed to the prosperity of the sinners&#44; as an evidence&#44; that 
man might tempt God&#44; and yet escape unscathed&#44; and that con&#8211; 
sequently it would appear&#44; that a person would do well to hold 
with a firm grasp what he once possesses&#44; and that it were 
unwise to spend any thing in charity and other religious pur&#8211; 
poses. To rebut these objections of cupidity and weakness of 
faith in the justice of God&#44; Malachi&#44; the last of those illustrious 
men&#44; by whose mouth the Lord thought proper to instruct the 
world&#44; spoke as follows : 

&#34; Your words have been strong against me&#44; sayeth the Lord&#44; and you said&#44; 
what have we been speaking against thee You said&#44; it is needless to serve 
God&#44; and what did we gain&#44; when we observed his statutes&#44; and walked 
mournfully before the Lord of hosts &#63; And now we call the presumptuous 
happy &#59; yes&#44; even they that practise wickedness are prosperous&#44; yes they 
have even tempted the Lord and have escaped. Then they that feared the 
Lord spoke to one another &#59; and the Lord hearkened and heard it&#44; and it was 
written before Him in the book of remembrance&#44; for those who fear the Lord 
and reverence his name.&#34; Malachi iii. 

And then continues the prophet : 

&#34;And they shall be mine&#44; on that day&#44; which I have set apart for judg&#8211; 
ment&#44; says the Lord of hosts&#44; and I will spare them as a man spares his son 
that serves him. And you shall return&#44; and see the difference between the 
righteous and the wicked&#44; between him that serves God and him who has 
not served him.&#34; Ibid. 17&#8211;18. 

Here are the objections of the timid stated &#59; they see not the 
use of serving God &#59; no private interest is served by religion&#44; 
no notoriety is gained by humility &#59; they point with trembling 
apprehension to the proud wealthy sinners&#44; who&#44; so to say&#44; 
brave the anger of the Lord with impunity &#59; they next 
imagine that wickedness will not meet with disfavour&#44; they 
hesitate and ask&#44; if it were true that punishment is the conse&#8211; 
quence of sin&#44; why does it not follow instantaneously and on all

occasions. But they observe not&#44; they regard not&#44; that&#44; if pun&#8211; 
ishment were at all times to ensue immediately&#44; a true and dis&#8211; 
interested reverence of God and confidence in his providence 
and justice could not possibly take root in the human breast. 
Consider&#44; brethren&#44; that&#44; if for instance a violation of the 
Sabbath should be followed by the instantaneous death of the 
transgressor&#44; it would not be the least meritorious in us to ab&#8211; 
stain from infringing the law&#44; seeing that we should be destroyed 
if we disobeyed &#59; and consequently&#44; not obedience to God&#44; but 
interest&#44; worldly and palpable interest&#44; the fear of bodily harm&#44; 
would deter us. Suppose&#44; too&#44; that reward should always be 
the fruit of piety in some tangible shape or other : to be pious&#44; 
then&#44; would only be to hold out an inducement to God to pay 
us for our work&#44; just as the day&#8211;labourer expects to obtain his 
pay from his master when his allotted task is done. Piety 
would thus be reduced to a mere barter on the one hand&#44; and a 
remedy on the other. But this never was&#44; never could have 
been the intention of God in making man a free agent&#44; by which 
he was designed to choose from conviction and inclination&#44; not 
to be bribed and frightened. And though to serve God from 
motives of fear and even of interest be a virtue too&#44; yet the great&#8211; 
est moral perfection attainable is to serve Him from pure feelings 
of adoration&#44; to be impelled solely by an admiration of his 
greatness&#44; wisdom&#44; and beneficence&#44; which are so abundantly 
displayed in all his works&#44; since from yon splendid orb&#44; that 
serves us as a light by day&#44; down to the moats that dance in 
his rays&#44; and the minute insect unobservable by the naked 
eye&#44; all is one chain of beauty&#44; order&#44; and perfection. This is 
true piety&#44; true adoration of God&#44; here no meanness mixes 
itself with our holier sensations &#59; here no avarice chokes up the 
fountain of sincere benevolence &#59; here no ambition for worldly 
greatness crowds out the noble ofi&#39;springs of religious obedience &#59; 
for then&#44; even whilst not unmindful of our preservation&#44; whilst 
labouring in the sphere assigned us by an All&#8211;wise Providence&#44; 
we shall be willing to love God above all&#44; and our neighbour 
like ourselves. In fine&#44; unless you convince yourselves&#44; that 
nothing but ultimate injury can result from purely worldly 
pursuits&#44; that at the best no splendour here enjoyed can in the 
least avail you&#44; that no earthly greatness can atone for duties

you will&#44; imagine a thousand necessities&#44; urge innumerable 
excuses&#44; nothing holy will be found at the root of your worldly 
pursuits&#59; for self&#8211;aggrandizement alone prompts you to these 
exertions &#59; since 3&#39;ou desire wealth in order to become rich &#59; 
you seek wisdom to appear wise before the world&#44; and if you 
look for advancement&#44; it is that your power may be felt. In 
all this there is nothing&#44; either in the motive or the result&#44; 
which can plead for you on the day of trial&#44; for in none of your 
doings of this nature can the glory of God&#44; the well&#8211;being of 
mankind&#44; and your own immortal happiness be the end in view. 
But if you submit cheerfully&#44; not patiently merely&#44; to the will 
of God&#44; if you advance step by step to the perfection&#44; which 
the adorers of the Lord enjoy : you need not tremble for the 
coming day&#44; for you will then be treasured up as the &#34; son who 
serves his father.&#34; And will not a state of endless bliss be 
compensation sufficient for all your exertions&#63; and will not the 
coming felicity &#8212; future it is true&#44; but still certain &#8212; be reward 
enough for all the little good you can accomplish &#63; &#8212; Or is it 
delayed too long for your impatience &#63; but consider how short 
at best is your time on earth&#44; how very rapidly those days will 
flit by&#44; which the rich&#44; the honoured&#44; and the powerful will be 
permitted to tarry here. And how can you complain of the 
unreasonableness of suffering you to wait so long&#44; when you 
ought to reflect&#44; how very confined your ideas are of eternity &#33; 
Perhaps you fear&#44; that the promised reward may never come &#63; 
Then know&#44; that God it is&#44; who promised it through the mouth 
of his faithful servants&#44; and that none of his words ever falls 
to the ground without fulfilling its object &#33; And you can 
doubt Him &#63; Israelites &#33; are you those so little of faith &#63; 
Have not his promises always been accomplished &#63; And who 
more than your nation has experienced this so often and so re&#8211; 
markably &#63; Reflect that your people owes its origin to the 
promise made to Abram&#44; your ancestor&#44; at &#34; the covenant be&#8211;

tween the pieces&#44;&#34; and consider that just as the limited time 
had expired&#44; your ancestors were redeemed by a mighty hand 
from oppression and thraldom. &#8212; The Israelites were groaning 
under oppression&#44; the sacred Record says&#44; and God heard their 
cries from amidst their labour&#44; and He remembered his cove&#8211; 
nant with Abraham&#44; with Isaac&#44; and with Jacob &#59; Moses was 
sent as God&#39;s messenger to Pharoah&#44; to claim the dismissal of 
the oppressed Hebrews from the mighty king of Egypt&#44; who 
insolently declared&#44; that he knew not the Eternal&#44; and would 
not suffer Israel to go &#59; &#8212; but he was at length glad to let our 
people go unto freedom&#44; when his pride had been humbled&#44; 
and when he had felt&#44; that it is in vain to oppose the counsels 
of the Most High&#44; and that no station will shield a man against 
the arrows of his punishment. This is the history of our 
people&#44; as the book of Exodus tells it&#44; and it has been verified 
and proved by the researches of tlie wise and curious &#59; but it 
needs no other evidence than Holy Writ to convince Jews of the 
truth of sacred history &#59; I speak to believers&#44; and further de&#8211; 
monstration is therefore useless. &#8212; Here then is evidence that 
the word of God is immutable&#44; unchangeable&#44; and its effect 
certain &#59; we can accordingly not doubt the promises of Him&#44; 
who has never deceived&#44; though their fulfilment has as yet not 
been accomplished&#44; though their effect is hidden from our 
sight&#44; and their working is beyond our comprehension. And 
notwithstanding the weakness of our reason&#44; we are not left in 
uncertainty concerning the different issues of vice and virtue&#44; 
for God himself has informed us of them&#59; and if the punish&#8211; 
ment of sin and the reward of piety should even not be displayed 
in this state of limited existence : we may rest assured that both 
will be proved to a certainty on that awful day of judgment&#44; 
when it will be seen by all what difference there is between the 
righteous and the wicked&#44; and when God will show how 
miserable he must be rendered&#44; who has remained a stranger 
to his worship&#44; and how happy he is who has truly served Him 
with all his soul and all his heart&#44; and who swerved not from 
his duty&#44; although oppressed by worldly ills&#44; which were sent 
as a means of purifying him from his sins and transgressions. 

Lord&#44; whose power is every where&#44; whose word is un&#8211; 
changeable&#44; restore thy people to their boundaries &#59; and may.

DISCOURSE XV. 

THE SANCTIFICATION OF THE LORD. 

Thou&#44; who only desirest the well&#8211;being of thy creatures&#44; and 
findest delight in their obedience to thy will only in as much 
as it tends to promote their own happiness : bless us with 
wisdom and knowledge&#44; that we may understand the ways of 
thy holy law&#44; and follow them in truth and sincerity &#33; Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 
If on all occasions we could but know the true effect of any 
deed we contemplate doing&#59; if our foreknowledge of futurity 
were sufficient to teach us to a certainty the event before we 
commence working : it would be quite unnecessary to lay 
down rules and directions for our government&#44; for even the 
smallest child then would always choose the most beneficial&#44; 
provided its intellect were not disordered. &#8212; But how does the 
case stand now&#44; in the manner human knowledge is organized&#63; 
who knows to&#8211;day what is to happen on the morrow &#63; True 
it is&#44; that men of learning can tell before&#8211;hand&#44; when certain 
appearances in the heavens will take place&#44; &#8212; yes&#44; they know to 
a certainty almost the minute on which the lights of heaven 
will be darkened &#59; but this is only knowing by observation&#44; how 
the Creator has organized his handiwork &#8212; nature &#59; this is but 

    <pb n="152"/>

confessing&#44; in other words&#44; the omnipotent power of the Ruler 
of all&#44; whose works are perfect&#44; and respond ever to the in&#8211; 
tended effect. But of the ultimate result of our own actions&#44; 
of the final issue of the deeds wrought in our present existence&#44; 
even the wisest of us is ignorant. It was the will of God&#44; that 
man&#39;s reason should not reach beyond a certain extent&#44; that 
human research should be bounded by the limits of reality &#8212; the 
past and the present&#59; though even in this space his mind often 
wanders in racking uncertainty and perplexing doubt&#44; for want 
of knowledge of details &#59; but into futurity &#8212; no man can dive 
of his own free will&#44; nay&#44; he cannot in the least degree lift the 
vail which hides the surface of coming things &#59; and thus he is 
left to rely upon the Author of his being for the issue of his 
endeavours&#44; and willing or unwilling he is unable to place 
himself one step beyond the reach of this Infinite Being&#44; and 
in his omnipresent care he must repose his trust&#44; yea&#44; though 
he impiously dare to question the existence of God &#33; Well 
may we say&#44; that in God alone we act and exist&#44; for without 
his sufierance nothing could remain in being even for one 
moment &#59; as we are taught in the sublime words of the 
Psalmist : &#34; Thou turnest but thy face&#44; they are affrighted &#59; 
Thou takest away their spirit&#44; they perish&#44; and to their dust 
they return.&#34; &#40;Psalm civ. 29.) And being thus short lived&#44; 
short sighted mortals&#44; subject perpetually to be compelled to 
resign our spirit into the hands of the Giver thereof: we ought 
to rely for protection where alone it can be found&#44; and seek for 
knowledge at the Fountain of unending wisdom. 

If now a man should ask : &#34; Why has God left us so power&#8211; 
less&#44; and has hidden from us so entirely all knowledge of 
futurity&#63;&#34; we answer&#44; that this was wisely ordained&#44; in order 
that no one should rely upon his own wisdom&#44; and trust to his 
own strength &#59; but that discovering his weakness and insuf&#8211; 
ficiency he might learn to pay due deference to his Creator&#44; and 
subject to his service the entire energy of his mind and body. 
And as&#44; at the same time&#44; we are ignorant of the actual effects 
our conduct&#44; when based upon our own reasoning&#44; will have : 
it follows as a matter of necessity&#44; that it is our duty to ascer&#8211; 
tain&#44; if possible&#44; what line of action will be beneficial to our&#8211; 
selves and others&#44; and what will be injurious in its tendency. 

    <pb n="153"/>

THE SANCTIFICATION OF THE LORD. 153 

It must be apparent&#44; upon slight reflection&#44; that if we follow our 
own inclinations&#44; or in other words&#44; if we surrender ourselves 
to the guidance of the passions&#44; we must often do that&#44; the 
effects of which will be injurious&#59; since if it were otherwise&#44; 
every act of man would be beneficial in its tendency. For&#44; if 
we were permitted to do whatever suits our fancy&#44; it would be 
requisite&#44; in order to constitute our conduct purely good&#44; that 
nothing but good should result therefrom. But suppose it 
would suit our fancy to plunder our neighbour&#39;s house&#44; to pos&#8211; 
sess ourselves of his property&#59; would this be right and bene&#8211; 
ficial&#63; yet our neighbour says&#44; he suffers wrong&#44; from those 
whom he never injured &#59; and consequently there can be no 
unmixed good&#44; where&#44; although the passions of the perpetrators 
are satisfied to their fullest extent&#44; another one is undeservedly 
injured in his person or property. &#8212; Some one&#44; however&#44; may 
assert&#44; that passion without the guidance of reason will be de&#8211; 
structive&#44; but that reason superadded will be enough to point 
out a proper course. &#8212; But here again we must come to the 
startling admission&#44; that every human being has a share of rea&#8211; 
son assigned to him&#44; and that&#44; even admitting reason to be a 
safe guide&#44; passion&#44; inclination&#44; and interest may raise such a 
tumult within us&#44; as to drown all suggestions of reason&#44; if no 
other check be admitted by us. It would thus appear&#44; that 
since every person would have a right to claim for himself the 
liberty of acting according to the dictates of his own percep&#8211; 
tion of right &#40;all men being subject alike to be swayed by 
passion&#44; inclination&#44; and interest): no man&#39;s suggestions would 
be listened to&#44; as to how far reason should hold the govern&#8211; 
ment&#59; and&#44; consequently&#44; we should have as many different 
rules of conduct&#44; as there are human beings &#59; and this would&#44; 
as shown&#44; engender such a mass of evil&#44; &#8212; whether passion be 
guided by reason or not&#44; &#8212; that the majority of men would not 
be able to bear the wrong&#44; the oppression&#44; and the vexation&#44; to 
which they would be subject from the powerful&#44; the cunning&#44; 
and the designing&#44; who would always be on the watch to inflict 
every sort of burden which could promote their interest&#44; and 
to which their passions&#44; aided by greater means of harm&#44; would 
undoubtedly prompt them &#59; and in consequence&#44; for the majo&#8211; 
rity&#44; thus oppressed and suffering&#44; non&#8211;existence would be far 

    <pb n="154"/>

preferable to existence. Now&#44; as such a state of things would 
evidently be a disorganization of the social compact&#44; it might 
justly be argued&#44; that the creation of every thing in so perfect 
and beautiful a manner had conferred no positive good&#59; what 
then could be the object of all this harmony so universally ob&#8211; 
servable around us in the entire structure of nature&#63; why 
should all be at peace save man&#44; the crown of the handiwork 
of the Lord &#63; If we take this view of our own internal orga&#8211; 
nization&#44; if we in this way put a proper estimate on our 
efficiency and strength : we must be struck with the conviction&#44; 
that our reason&#44; though of far greater extent than the instinct 
of any other animal that inhabits the earth&#44; still requires far&#8211; 
ther instruction and improvement&#44; in order to constitute it in 
truth the greatest blessing&#59; for it is only by a proper instruc&#8211; 
tion in relation to what we are to do or not to do&#44; that we can 
secure unto ourselves and others the greatest possible share of 
happiness&#44; consistent with our short life on earth&#44; and acting&#44; 
as we must&#44; with a body subject to pain&#44; decay&#44; and corruption. 
The instruction thus proved necessary&#44; cannot&#44; ought not&#44; to 
proceed from a mortal prone to err&#44; liable to be biassed&#44; like 
ourselves&#59; but from the One&#44; who alone is always unchanged&#44; 
whose thoughts are uninfluenced by interest or circumstance&#44; 
and who need not&#44; and does not&#44; fear&#44; in giving his opinion&#44; 
aught that lives or exists in any part of creation : in other 
words&#44; we should receive the law which God himself has pro&#8211; 
mulgated for our government&#44; seeing that by obeying it alone&#44; 
and by causing it to be respected by others&#44; we actually contri&#8211; 
bute the most we are capable of towards furthering the general 
welfare of mankind. &#8212; And in this ready listening to an instruc&#8211; 
tion emanating from a higher Source of wisdom than ourselves&#44; 
and in the cheerfulness displayed in correcting our vices&#44; or 
what is the same&#44; faults habitually committed by yielding to 
our earthly desires&#44; &#8212; I assert&#44; that in a conduct of this kind&#44; 
proceeding from a sincere conviction of our own insignificance&#44; 
consists the essence of all true religion. Is religion then&#44; as&#8211; 
suming this basis&#44; an arbitiary rule invented by designing 
priests to impose a heavy yoke upon the unwilling shoulders of 
an ignorant multitude &#63; is such a religion the effect of ignorance&#44; 
of bigotry&#44; and of superstition &#63; Or rather&#44; is not this reli&#8211;

gion the sacred guide granted by Providence&#44; to point out to 
man the road to happiness&#63; Yes&#44; even the sensual one&#44; and he 
who always regarded his personal convenience as the greatest 
good&#44; and the scoffer&#44; who ever ridiculed the idea of God&#39;s su&#8211; 
pervising in his greatness the little affairs of mortals : all must 
acknowledge&#44; when serious reflection is once roused within 
them&#44; when confusion seals their lips and forbids them to ex&#8211; 
cuse their follies and the wrongs they have committed&#44; that 
there is a treasure in the word of God&#44; a life even in death&#44; 
discoverable in the Revelation of the Lord&#44; which they have 
wilfully neglected&#44; and that they have reaped tares&#44; instead of 
the wholesome fruit of life. &#8212; Yes&#44; brethren&#44; let us regard the 
goods of the earth as ever so valuable&#44; necessity will one time 
or another force us to confess&#44; that without a respect for reli&#8211; 
gious enactments no true virtue can exist &#59; and how can happi&#8211; 
ness be imagined&#44; where virtue has not laid the foundation.&#39;&#39; &#8212; 
True&#44; that virtue may not be always rewarded with outward 
bliss &#59; but who can estimate the bliss within&#44; the unfading sere&#8211; 
nity which accompanies the righteous&#44; even unto death&#63; &#8212; No 
further argument need be adduced to prove the necessity of the 
law promulgated by God&#44; and the good effects resulting there&#8211; 
from&#59; since every reasonable being can easily discern the dif&#8211; 
ference between acts arising from a feeling of devotion and 
confidence in the Lord &#8212; and those springing from motives of 
self&#8211;gratification merely&#44; even assuming that such a principle 
could teach what is good and useful. 

&#34; But how is religion to be observed &#63; what are the demands 
of revealed faith &#63;&#34; These questions&#44; though frequently put in 
a manner as though they could not be easily solved&#44; can be an&#8211; 
swered by a simple reference to the records of revelation&#44; the 
holy Scriptures&#44; for there are recorded the commandments 
which God instituted as the enactments of his will&#59; and every 
man&#44; therefore&#44; is bound to do thereof&#44; whatever may be in 
his power of effecting &#59; and no excuse whatever&#44; will justify 
him for neglecting any practicable duty&#44; which he is certified 
to be the will of his Creator. &#8212; Although this deduction is so 
perfectly reasonable&#44; permit me to present to you some few 
observations&#44; in order to illustrate the subject a little more at 
length&#44; since it is one which merits and ought to receive the 

    <pb n="156"/>

156 THE SANCTIFICATION OF THE LORD. 

serious reflection of every Israelite. &#8212; In a former lecture on this 
subject&#44; it has been shown&#44; that unless a man is willing to 
make sacrifice of all personal considerations in the cause of 
piety&#44; he cannot be said to be fired with true ardour for the 
holy cause. Now&#44; as also partly said&#44; these sacrifices to prin&#8211; 
ciple do not consist in an entire abstinence from all pleasures&#44; 
and in a seclusion from social intercourse&#59; for this never was 
the intention or scope of our law&#44; which recommends sociality 
and pleasure&#44; when enjoyed in moderation. But the sacrifices 
which we are bound to make to the will of God&#44; consist sim&#8211; 
ply in an entire disregard of all consequences&#44; be they good or 
bad&#44; that may possibly follow upon our doing those acts&#44; which 
are prescribed by religion. From this definition you will 
clearly observe&#44; that a mere profession&#44; nay&#44; even a sincere 
profession&#44; of faith&#44; is not all that is demanded&#44; since princi&#8211; 
ples&#44; which prove themselves by words only&#44; are mere out&#8211; 
ward show&#44; in which there is nothing capable of conferring 
lasting benefits &#59; but acts&#44; the most trifling even&#44; produce an 
impression somewhere&#44; and by so much as they are worth&#44; they 
always tend to augment the general mass of good. &#8212; Some one&#44; 
however&#44; may ask : &#34; Why do we regard the ceremonial parts of 
religion with so much reverence&#44; and what can be the good 
resulting from their careful observance &#63;&#34; &#8212; Questions of this na&#8211; 
ture are frequently asked&#44; and even by persons pretending to 
piety&#59; and in this way neglect of outward acts of worship is 
excused by many&#44; if the offender holds but fast to the so&#8211; 
called moral laws. &#8212; In answer&#44; we have to observe&#44; that no Jew 
will contend&#44; that honesty&#44; integrity&#44; and neighbourly kindness&#44; 
are not virtues highly commendable&#44; inculcated in the law&#44; 
and for which the possessor deserves the blessing of Heaven&#59; 
but then we also assert&#44; that acts of worship&#44; the ceremonies 
proper&#44; are necessary&#44; praiseworthy and useful in their ten&#8211; 
dency. For the following reasons: first&#44; any act of worship 
proceeding from a pure motive&#44; and obeyed because it is an 
emanation from the will of God&#44; must produce&#44; the oftener it 
is repeated&#44; an acquiescence in the dictates of the Lord&#44; and it is 
a habit of this kind that is at last the true essence of piety and 
devotion. Secondly&#44; to do those acts&#44; acknowledgedly great 
and useful&#44; such as charity&#44; justice&#44; and preservation of human 

    <pb n="157"/>

THE SANCTIFICATION OF THE LORD. 157 

life&#44; is in a measure necessary to our nature&#44; and we indulge in 
their exercise perhaps from motives of interest&#44; since we may 
one day stand in need ourselves of the same deeds of kindness&#44; 
which we now show to others. It will thus be evident&#44; that in 
the execution of social virtues&#44; as we will term the acts com&#8211; 
monly called the moral law&#44; the pure devotion towards God 
may have but little share in prompting them &#59; but in acts of 
worship&#44; where we alone are the actors&#44; and God the sole wit&#8211; 
ness perhaps of our conduct&#44; true worship can be most amply&#8211; 
proved. For in no situation of this life can a heartfelt prayer 
be recompensed by the prayer of any other son of man&#44; no mat&#8211; 
ter how virtuous he may be &#59; patience under suffering and 
resignation to divine dispensations cannot be repaid by equal 
deeds in others &#59; and therefore we must contend&#44; that in these 
and many other similar acts&#44; the love of God&#44; in its proper 
sense&#44; is more pointedly exhibited than in any other way. It 
need not be repeated again in this place&#44; that mere devotional&#44; 
without social piety&#44; is not to be considered as the sole demand 
of religion&#59; for we hold it as an essential principle of our faith&#44; 
that the proper duties of man are not fulfilled&#44; unless he 
observes the whole enactments of God&#44; which are declared to 
be his will&#44; and contained in intelligible terms in the books of 
Moses. &#8212; We will admit&#44; that there are devotees who act&#44; as 
though there were no human being toward whom any duties 
are to be fulfilled &#59; for their mind&#44; is&#44; as it were&#44; wrapt up 
within themselves &#8212; in God they see only a watchful&#44; jealous&#44; 
Being&#44; who commands them as their master&#44; and requires of 
them&#44; that all their time should be spent in devotional exer&#8211; 
cises. We will admit&#44; I say&#44; that there are such devotees&#44; and 
also&#44; that they are mistaken in their conceptions of God &#59; for 
He is a just&#44; not an unmerciful&#44; judge &#59; He&#44; indeed&#44; searches the 
heart&#44; knows whether it is true in his service&#44; but He wishes 
not that we should cease to be men&#44; as soon as we enter on his 
worship&#59; not this is the economy which his wisdom has 
established&#44; when He assigned labour to man during his 
sojourn on earth &#59; and they&#44; therefore&#44; who regard the Merciful 
One in the light of an arbitrary ruler&#44; have quite misunderstood 
his will &#59; and consequently we should endeavour to prevent 
such erroneous ideas from taking root among us. But in

admitting this much against what ma&#39; be termed the excesses 
of piety&#44; we have admitted all that can reasonably be claimed 
as an objection to devotional&#44; or rather the irregular and extra&#8211; 
vagant excesses&#44; of devotional feelings. But there are many 
on the other hand&#44; and unfortunately for the well&#8211;being of our 
religion&#44; the number is so very great&#44; who live as though there 
were no God &#33; they perhaps do read the Bible of the Lord&#44; but 
their eye is closed against whatever relates to his worship&#59; 
they doubtlessly must be convinced&#44; that regulations&#44; the ten&#8211; 
dency of which has been to preserve a scattered people entire 
amidst all the toils&#44; the fatigues&#44; the dangers&#44; the persecutions 
of a long captivity &#8212; a captivity prolonged to such a length that 
our hopes almost sicken&#44; that our hearts nearly faint&#44; were it 
not for the promises of God&#44; so often repeated &#8212; must have been 
instituted by a Wisdom elevated far above our limited capacity&#44; 
that laws so pure must at least be harmless in their operation : 
and yet they will ridicule the observance of these very wise&#44; 
wholesome&#44; priceless precepts&#44; which we call the ordinances of 
the Lord&#59; and they profess to look with as much contempt 
upon the pious believer&#44; as if his system were fraught with evil 
to society. Do I state more than the fact which we are daily 
compelled to witness&#63; And these scoffers are they&#44; who wish 
to arrogate to themselves the title of philanthropists&#44; like if the 
religious were enemies to mankind&#44; and desirous of keeping the 
multitude groping in darkness&#59; and even when finding that all 
subterfuges have failed&#44; and when they are unable any longer 
to contend against the overwhelming force of conviction&#44; that 
the books of Moses contain the undoubted revelation of the 
God of nature : they endeavour to excuse their unnatural unbe&#8211; 
lief by saying&#44; that the statutes of the law were made for Israel&#8211; 
ites of a former period&#44; but that they have ceased to be binding 
upon the present generation. &#8212; But is it possible&#44; that any one 
laying claim to reason can be so blinded by ignorance and pre&#8211; 
judice&#44; as to maintain such gross absurdities &#63; Where can the 
law of God be found&#44; if the Pentateuch is no longer in force &#63; 
Where will you seek for the guide of life&#44; if you do not find it 
there&#63; Perhaps you may say&#44; that reason shall guide us&#44; that 
from experience we will gather wisdom. &#8212; But where are those 
monuments of human reason&#44; which have been as lasting as the 

    <pb n="159"/>

THE SANCTIFICATION OF THE LORD. 159 

monuments of revelation &#63; Where are the wise laws drawn 
from experience &#63; Do we not rather tind&#44; that no human being 
can establish a single principle&#44; which is not liable to be 
rescinded the following day &#63; And from experience you will 
derive instruction &#33; when it is evident&#44; by the evidence of this 
very instructor you so much extol&#44; that no man was ever pre&#8211; 
vented from following another upon the path of ruin&#44; if no 
other opinions and principles save those derived from reason 
and experience prevented him &#63; These facts&#44; I believe to be 
so self&#8211;evident&#44; and so well fortified by what we see every day&#44; 
that it would be but fatiguing you&#44; brethren&#44; to say any more 
in refutation of such fallacious arguments. &#8212; But there is another 
point&#44; involved in this mode of pushing the obligation of the 
word of God from our shoulders&#44; to which I have to draw your 
attention. If the arguments we have before this adduced in 
favour of the necessity of a divine revelation be well founded 
in reason&#44; and if we have succeeded in proving that the law of 
Moses&#44; so called&#44; is the record thereof: we must come to the 
conclusion&#44; that the words and commandments contained in the 
Pentateuch are in truth the manifestation of the will of God&#44; 
by which he intended to enlighten mankind with regard to 
their duties&#44; which &#40;in the words of the law itself) &#34; they were 
to do and live through them &#59;&#34; and then&#44; knowing&#44; as we do&#44; 
how wise and unwavering God is in all his doings&#44; it is but 
reasonable to suppose that the enactments of his will&#44; as mani&#8211; 
fested to Moses&#44; are even to this hour considered by him in the 
same light of usefulness and necessity&#44; as at the period when first 
He announced them. &#8212; For if we survey all that immense struc&#8211; 
ture of nature&#44; the creation&#44; of which we form a part: we must 
discover&#44; that in every particle&#44; wisdom the most unsearchable&#44; 
order the most unwavering&#44; are manifested. The sun rises in 
the same manner now&#44; as he did from the first moment of his 
installation as the light by day &#59; planets upon planets move in 
their spheres with the utmost regularity without derangement 
or interruption &#59; and descending to this humble&#44; beautiful&#44; earth 
of ours&#44; we see spring&#44; and summer&#44; and autumn&#44; and winter&#44; 
change in a constant circle&#44; with the utmost regularity and pre&#8211; 
cision. Thus has God organized all of which we can form a 
conception by our organs and senses. And if next we turn our 

    <pb n="160"/>

160 THE SANCTIFICATION OF THE LORD. 

view inward&#44; and observe of what the living principle within 
us is made&#44; and if we search in the experience of others&#44; and in 
the records of past ages&#44; which have been brought down to our 
times: we will again be struck with the regularity observable 
in the formation of the many sons of Adam&#44; every where to be 
discovered. All this proves&#44; how permanent God&#39;s counsels 
are&#44; how fixed his resolutions&#44; how unalterable his judgments &#33; 
How then shall the impious dare to say&#44; even whilst professing 
veneration to the Great Being&#44; that his law&#44; which he declared 
to be his will&#44; should not have been intended as permanent&#63; 
and that He made decrees&#44; which according to the import of 
the words of the holy record were to everlasting&#44; but which 
were nevertheless to cease&#44; as soon as the Israelites should at 
any time cease to be a united people&#44; and be no longer 
governed by the judicial and purely local ordinances &#63; &#8212; Is this 
what you call honouring your Maker &#63; Is this your religion &#63; 
Do you thus expect to accomplish the duties demanded of you &#63; 
How dare&#44; how can you say&#44; that you revere the Unchangeable 
One&#44; whilst you profess to believethat He has changed&#63; Never 
may this be the universal opinion of our people &#59; never may 
the Almighty suffer such ideas to become general &#59; for even 
admitting that the social laws should &#8211;be of paramount import&#8211; 
ance&#44; still they would cease to be regarded&#44; if the ceremonial 
and devotional ordinances were obliterated from the law&#8211;book &#59; 
for where there is no yeneration for the Lord&#44; love to man will 
speedily die away. And even grant that this should not be&#44; 
still the inward satisfaction of a holy life would not be felt any 
more &#59; and from the sick bed its consolation would be torn &#59; 
the poor man would lose his comfort &#59; and the oppressed would 
have nothing left to shield him from despair. Here we are 
brought to a point at which much more might be said &#59; yes&#44; 
the mind becomes bewildered at a view of the frightful chaos 
civilized society would present without the devotional feeling 
which lies now hidden in the bosom of every man who has 
once enjoyed a religious education &#59; for&#44; believe me&#44; brethren 
where the seed has once been sown&#44; no weed&#44; be it ever so 
noxious&#44; can altogether clioke the sacred germ &#59; and its benefi&#8211; 
cial fruits will ripen one day&#44; though the flowers even may not 
bud till the tree is hastening to decay&#44; and the canker&#8211;worm is 

    <pb n="161"/>

THE SANCTIFICATION OF THE LORD. 161 

ready to devour the tender fruit as soon as formed. To drop 
the metaphor &#59; religion will show its presence and blessed 
influence&#44; though it may have lain dormant till man is thrown 
upon the bed of sickness&#44; and approaching death will barely 
grant him sufficient time to turn his tearful&#44; repentant eye to 
Heaven. 

Thus much&#44; and more&#44; may be said in favour of acts of 
worship&#44; even when considering man only as an individual&#44; 
unconnected with any other one around him. But as a second 
inducement to a devotional conduct we will exhibit him as a 
member of society&#44; created not for his own especial benefit and 
amusement alone&#44; but also for the advancement of the happiness 
of others. For man&#44; as he exists&#44; has a double existence &#59; one 
as regards himself&#44; the other as being&#59; a member of the human 
family at large. In the latter capacity&#44; every one of his acts&#44; 
be they good or bad&#44; must exercise some influence upon the 
entire mass of men. Not alone is every good act so much po&#8211; 
sitive good added to the common stock of happiness&#44; and every 
evil deed an absolute diminution therefrom &#59; but every act must 
likewise serve as an example&#44; if the same be done publicly&#44; or 
if it leave a trace behind by which it can at some time be made 
public. &#8212; For example : the respect a man pays to his parents is 
a good act in itself&#59; but a two&#8211;fold good arises from it&#44; inasmuch 
as other children are taught to do the same&#44; when they see how 
much satisfaction the parents of the dutiful child enjoys&#44; and 
how many blessings are heaped on his head for his filial piety. 
Now&#44; regardless of the good he does to his parents&#44; he is the 
cause of making filial obedience loved as a virtue by others&#59; 
and consequently this act&#44; which is apparently 07ie&#44; becomes a 
two&#8211;fold deed of virtue. &#8212; Again&#44; we have frequently seen&#44; that 
if a stranger came to a place where the greater part&#44; not to 
mention the whole&#44; were walking in meekness before the Lord&#44; 
he was ready to become charmed with their course of life&#44; and 
was induced to join them in their plans of goodness. Thus&#44; 
also&#44; where irreligion was predominant&#44; that new comers com&#8211; 
monly chimed in with the opinions entertained by the majority 
of the inhabitants. And&#44; in fact&#44; so much importance is at&#8211; 
tached to example even by the opinion of the world&#44; that it is 
expected as something almost certain&#44; that no one will be long 

14&#42; 

    <pb n="162"/>

162 THE SANCTIFICATION OF THE LORD. 

able to resist the force of example set him by his associates. &#8212; 
Worship&#44; then&#44; which from its nature in the Jewish religion 
must be public&#44; will confer a two&#8211;fold share of benefit upon so&#8211; 
ciety &#59; first&#44; inasmuch as it tends to improve the heart of every 
man joining in it with sincerity&#59; and&#44; secondly&#44; because the 
example of one may induce the wavering to become religious&#44; 
and to confirm the good in their former conduct. And thus so 
general a feeling of obedience to the will of God may be pro&#8211; 
duced&#44; that it may freely be expected that one will incite the other 
to acts of piety &#59; and in this manner too a state of harmony and 
friendship will spring up amidst those united together by one 
mode of worship&#44; and they will learn&#44; not only their dependence 
upon God&#44; but also their relation to&#44; and dependence upon&#44; one 
another. &#8212; We may therefore maintain&#44; that the observance of 
the ceremonial law tends pre&#8211;eminently to unite more closely 
the worshippers of God&#44; and to promote that concord which 
should subsist between those who hope for the favour of the 
same Supreme Ruler. &#8212; In this outward exhibition of piety 
there need not be necessarily the least ostentation &#59; for&#44; as al&#8211; 
ready said&#44; Avorship was intended to be public&#44; and consequently 
when a man enters this holy house&#44; and worships before this 
holy shrine&#44; it is not to be presumed upon any slight evidence&#44; 
that he believes&#44; or that he should wish&#44; the eyes of others to 
be upon him. No &#59; this cannot be the case where all are alike 
pious&#44; alike devout&#44; alike intent upon serving the same God&#44; 
where all simultaneously invoke the protection of the same 
Redeemer. 

Now it is this holy living&#44; this teaching of virtue by precept 
and example&#44; which we call the sanctification of the name of 
the Lord&#59; and if a man was always careful of his religious 
conduct as well as moral &#8212; if the word of God was to his soul 
a delight &#8212; if the Sabbath of the Lord was to him a pleasure &#8212; 
if the house of worship was the spot which he often visited &#8212; 
if the poor were by him cherished&#44; if the oppressed were by 
him relieved&#44; if the slandered were by him defended : then he 
has sanctified the Holy Name as much as though he had died a 
martyr for the cause of the Lord upon the stake of the perse&#8211; 
cutor&#59; his soul is then as pure as though his best life&#39;s&#8211;blood had 
freely flowed on the scaffold in acknowledging the unity of God 

    <pb n="163"/>

and maintaining the truth of his law. And although not every 
one is called upon to seal his faith as those great ones of former 
days have done by glorifying their Maker with their death : 
still the course just described is open to all &#59; for this is a 
contest in which all can join&#44; and a field in which all can gain 
an equal share of renown&#44; a vineyard in which all can gather 
the same rich vintage. In truth&#44; the humblest even has some 
chance of proving his devotion &#59; if he cannot be bountiful to 
the poor&#44; he can at least lend his personal aid&#44; and if he cannot 
teach the world by precept&#44; he can set a good example to those 
immediately around him &#59; and there is therefore no man living 
who cannot&#44; if he will&#44; be regardful of the commandment: 

: &#39;nh &#39;2D N&#8211;ip&#34;i 

&#34; And you shall not dishonour my holy name&#44; and I will be sanctified in 
the midst of the children of Israel.&#34; Levi. xxii. 3L 

may we live to see the time&#44; when all men shall be taught 
to shun sin&#44; when all will love virtue&#44; when all will be animated 
by the purest love to God&#44; in those days&#44; of which the prophet 
spoke when saying : &#34; And the earth shall be full of knowledge 
of the Lord&#44; as the waters cover the sea.&#34; Amen.

DISCOURSE XVI. 



THE GLORY OF THE LORD. 



Thou&#44; our Father&#44; Lord of heaven and earth&#44; accept in 
thy grace the humble thanks which we&#44; thy creatures and ser&#8211; 
vants&#44; have offered up to&#8211;day in this house consecrated to thy 
service &#33; Vouchsafe to receive our prayers&#44; and grant us our 
supplications&#44; as Thou didst once hearken unto those&#44; that sacri&#8211; 
ficed before thee on the holy altar in Jerusalem. Bestow on 
us also&#44; in thy infinite goodness&#44; a knowledge of thy holy 
ways&#44; as Thou in former days didst enlighten the minds of the 
people Thou hadst redeemed from slavery&#44; as they&#44; prostrate at 
thy feet&#44; received the commands of thy mouth in awe and 
trembling&#44; and shielded by thy majesty &#33; Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 
We are this day assembled here to celebrate the greatest 
event&#44; to commemorate the highest of blessings&#44; which the Al&#8211; 
mighty ever caused to gladden the hearts of thinking men&#44; and 
especially of that once great people&#44; of which we constitute 
but a small and feeble remnant. But I will not now enter upon 
a comparison of our state at the time of the promulgation of 
the law with our present condition &#59; as I wish not to sadden the 
hearts of the community on this day of solemn rejoicing by such 
sad reflections&#59; but I will only revert to a portion of the im&#8211; 
measurable good&#44; which was bestowed on us in particular&#44; and 
the entire mass of men in general&#44; by the light which was shed 
over the world by the revelation from Sinai. I advert to the no&#8211; 
ble conceptions which we in this manner received of the attri&#8211; 
butes of the Deity &#59; so much elevated above whatever the 
wisest of the heathens were ever able to discover by the aid 
of unassisted reason alone. And let me add&#44; that in nothing 
were we more favourably distinguished above all nations 
of antiquity&#44; than by the knowledge we received through God 
himself of his ways with man &#59; and it seems therefore that 

    <pb n="165"/>

THE GLORY OF THE LORD. 165 

this day&#44; devoted to commemorate the descent on Sinai&#44; is pecu&#8211; 
liarly adapted to call up feelings of thanks and devotion for the 
great good so bountifully bestowed&#44; and of which we can prove 
ourselves worthy only by a careful attention to the precepts then 
announced from amidst the fire and thunder by the Almighty 
himself&#44; without the intervention of human agency. Not alone 
in the Decalogue&#44; however&#44; but also in other parts of Scrip&#8211; 
ture&#44; do we find the sublimest truth revealed&#44; and among the 
many there is hardly one more touching&#44; and characteristic of 
Israel&#39;s God&#44; than the following from the thirty&#8211;third chapter 
of Exodus&#44; which I wish to offer to your consideration to&#8211;day&#44; 
as particularly appropriate to the festival and its institution : 

&#34; And he &#40;Moses) said : Show me&#44; I pray Thee&#44; thy glory &#59;&#8212; and He said&#44; 
1 will let all my goodness pass before thee.&#34; Exodus xxxiii&#44; 18&#8211;19. 

Moses was standing in prayer before God on the summit of 
Mount Sinai&#44; in the midst of the desert&#59; and his spirit was 
refreshed by the light of revelation&#44; whilst he was listening 
with delight to the precepts which proceeded from the mouth 
of the Most High &#59; and he enjoyed thus an inexpressible plea&#8211; 
sure&#44; scarcely inferior to that which animates the disembodied 
soul&#44; when she wings her way to Paradise&#44; in holy ecstacy at 
being sent to scenes of inexhaustible bliss&#44; from before the 
judgment throne of the everlasting Father. &#8212; His indeed had 
been a happy lot&#44; his had been an eminence rarely reached by 
mortals &#59; since in prosperity he had never become elated with 
pride&#44; nor had he ever grown faint&#8211;hearted amidst trials and 
dangers. For&#44; nurtured in the bosom of pleasure in the palace 
of the Egyptian Pharaoh&#44; his mind had retained its primitive 
purity&#44; his soul its stainless innocence&#44; and the adopted son of 
the king&#39;s daughter forgot not his brethren that groaned in 
slavery and degradation&#59; and when as a fugitive from the vin&#8211; 
dictive sword of Mitzraim&#39;s ruler he had been compelled to 
seek shelter in a foreign land&#44; where&#44; banished from the 
scenes of his youth&#44; he was not permitted to share the toil 

    <pb n="166"/>

even of his own people : his heart found consolation in the 
goodness of God&#44; in the overruling providence of our Pa&#8211; 
rent in heaven. And there also&#44; like other suffering right&#8211; 
eous ones&#44; he was taught that the innocent are not forsaken&#59; 
for in the land of the stranger he found those capable of ap&#8211; 
preciating honesty and integrity of purpose&#44; and obtained a 
home in the house of the chief of Midian&#44; who bestowed on 
him his daughter as a token of his regard. &#8212; It was now&#44; whilst 
tending the flock of his wife&#39;s father&#44; that Moses&#44; for the first 
time heard the voice of God resound in his hearing&#44; and from 
on high he was deputed to effect the liberation of his brothers 
from slavery and oppression. With fearful signs he was ena&#8211; 
bled to force conviction upon an obdurate king&#59; and when the 
task had been accomplished&#44; when Israel had gone forth to 
freedom&#44; he was acknowledged the chosen prophet and the 
leader of the people of God &#59; and soon he brought them to the 
foot of Sinai&#44; where was imparted to them the law&#44; more pure 
than fire&#44; and more healthful than the spirit of life itself. Who 
can estimate the awe&#44; the fear&#44; the joy&#44; and the gladness of the 
people at that awful hour&#44; when they were led forth from the 
camp&#44; to whei&#39;e the glory of God appeared&#44; &#8212; whilst the trumpet 
sounded &#8212; whilst the earth trembled &#8212; whilst the mountain 
smoked &#59; &#8212; and more still at that ecstatic moment&#44; when the 
terrific voice of the Eternal One spoke: &#39;&#39;I am the Lord thy 
God.&#34; The mind is lost in admiration of the sublimity of the 
scene&#44; and our reason is unable to comprehend&#44; how our an&#8211; 
cestors must have felt&#44; when they were in truth convinced&#44; that 
now indeed they were the chosen people&#44; since it was from 
Heaven that their law was given &#33; &#8212; If thus the community at 
large were enlightened&#44; &#8212; if thus hidden things were revealed 
to them: how much more must he have seen&#44; the man&#44; who 
alone was called to the summit of the mount &#33; Around him 
blazed the fiercest fire&#44; but he remained unscathed &#59; under him 
the earth shook&#44; but his feet were firm &#59; and when all the na&#8211; 
tion of Israel were unwilling to see the glory of God again 
revealed to them as it had been that day&#44; fearing they might 
die: his courage never wavered&#44; for his knowledge of divine 
things was greater&#44; and his faith in divine protection was firmer&#44; 
than that of any other mortal &#59; and he beheld&#44; and witnessed 

    <pb n="167"/>

THE GLORY OF THE LORD. 167 

all&#44; with an unshaken fortitude and a steady gaze&#44; as though it 
were a father coming to visit his child&#44; as though it were a 
fond parent coming to instruct his beloved offspring. 

But soon&#44; alas&#33; the scene was changed &#59; the people who had 
but lately received the law&#44; were misled by folly and presump&#8211; 
tion&#44; and made themselves a molten calf&#44; &#34; the image of a grass&#8211; 
eating ox&#44;&#34; and bowed down to the work of their own hands. 
&#34;God perceived it and was incensed&#44;&#34; to adopt the language 
of Scripture&#44; and He ordered Moses to go down from Mount 
Sinai&#44; because the people of Israel had sinned&#44; whom he had so 
lately led forth from Egypt. The prophet then descended&#44; and 
in his hands were the two tables of stone&#44; inscribed by the 
finger of the Deity with the Ten Commandments&#44; the words 
of the covenant of the Maker of all with his chosen people. 
But&#44; instead of his service&#44; instead of the adoration of the 
Protector of their forefathers&#44; he beheld the calf and the danc&#8211; 
ing&#44; the idol and its senseless worship &#59; and unwilling to de&#8211; 
liver to apostates the record of the covenant of everlasting life&#44; 
he threw from his hands the miraculous tables&#44; and broke them 
at the foot of Sinai. And in sorrow and indignation he com&#8211; 
manded those who had remained faithful&#44; the children of Levi&#44; 
to revenge the Holy Name that had been profaned&#44; and there 
fell a multitude who had bowed the knee before the abomina&#8211; 
tion of the people of Egypt. When the most guilty had thus 
been punished&#44; he went up again on the mount to ask forgive&#8211; 
ness for the transgressors&#44; and he remained there forty days 
and forty nights&#44; without tasting earthly food&#44; to secure preser&#8211; 
vation for those who had proved themselves so unworthy of 
God&#39;s favour&#59; and his prayer was heard&#44; and the threatened 
punishment was averted. 

It was here&#44; and at this time&#44; that Moses&#44; who had seen of 
God&#39;s ways so much more than ever had been before or since 
revealed to man&#44; asked of the Lord to let him see his glory. 
Moses had before this beheld the power of God manifested in 
so many wonderful ways &#59; he had been upheld amidst the 
threatenings of the greatest dangers&#59; he had heard the words 
of the Supreme Wisdom&#44; whenever the welfare of Israel re&#8211; 
quired it&#59; more wisdom and knowledge than ever had been 
confen&#39;ed on man were his : and yet he confessed by his earnest 

    <pb n="168"/>

168 THE GLORY OF THE LORD. 

prayer&#44; that to him too the Deity was a mystery&#44; a mystery 
beyond what all his knowledge and wisdom could ever hope to 
reach. &#8212; Here let us pause. &#8212; &#34;Show me thy glory&#33;&#34; thus 
prayed the most gifted of mortals&#59; not he dared to dive into 
the secrets of creation &#59; not he ventured to lift his searching 
view into the nature and essence of God &#59; for amidst all that 
his mind had conceived&#44; the All&#8211;powerful One yet remained 
hidden&#44; a mystery too great&#44; too holy&#44; to be unravelled &#59; a 
Being too fearful to be approached by the flights of thought. &#8212; 
If thus Moses acted&#44; how darest thou&#44; presumptuous&#44; ignorant 
man&#44; endeavour to pry into that which escaped the knowledge 
of the father of the prophets&#63; weenest thou to be wiser than 
he&#44; who was by God instructed&#63; &#8212; To know what is God &#8212; to 
investigate the nature of his being &#8212; are these studies suitable 
for short&#8211;lived man&#63; are these the points to which his inqui&#8211; 
ries should be directed &#63; when his own being is a secret to him&#59; 
and when he knows not how his own mind works&#44; shall he di&#8211; 
rect his search into the Author of his mind&#63; &#8212; how true it is&#44; 
that only the truly wise discover how insufficient their reason&#44; 
how limited their means of research are &#33; 

The object of his second ascent to Sinai had been attained&#44; 
inasmuch as the transgressions of the sinful people had been 
remitted&#44; and the punishment denounced against all&#44; inflicted 
upon the hardened few only: yet Moses lingered in the Sacred 
Presence&#44; anxious&#44; as said already&#44; for more knowledge&#44; con&#8211; 
vinced that of his own accord he could not penetrate farther. 
Impelled by this desire it was&#44; that he asked of the Eternal 
One: &#34; Show me&#44; I pray Thee&#44; thy glory&#59;&#34; he wanted to be&#8211; 
come more familiar with the being of the Deity&#44; than a view 
of outward nature permits to man &#59; he wished to discover why 
things were organized as they are&#59; to understand&#44; how the 
power of God works in secret every thing which we perceive 
by our senses. It was here also&#44; whilst standing on the mount&#44; 
that he was answered to his prayer by the words of the Al&#8211; 
mighty: &#34; I will let all my goodness pass before thee.&#34; Let it 
be observed in what manner God granted Moses&#39;s wish for ex&#8211; 
tended knowledge. Moses&#44; not satisfied with all he had seen&#44; 
desired to witness the power of Heaven manifested in a more 
striking degree than it had been hitherto in his presence&#59; he 

    <pb n="168"/>

THE GLORY OF THE LORD. 169 

petitioned for an increased sphere of understanding&#44; conceiving 
that which he possessed to be as yet incomplete. But he was 
answered&#44; that to him&#44; as man&#44; no farther knowledge could be 
granted&#44; and that he must&#44; therefore&#44; not hope for a more ex&#8211; 
tended view of the Divine Being &#59; &#39;•&#39; for no man&#44;&#34; says the 
text&#44; &#34;can see me and live&#59;&#34; but in lieu of this&#44; he was pro&#8211; 
mised&#44; as something more suitable for human nature&#44; to have 
the goodness of God more clearly displayed to him&#44; and to be 
shown more strongly than hitherto&#44; how kind and benevolent 
are the ways of the Infinite and Merciful One&#44; towards his 
creatures&#33; How profound a theme for meditation this presents 
to our mind&#33; The goodness of God is his glory&#33; for so was

ledge of the ways of the Lord. Ask we then : •&#39; What is 
God&#63;&#34; we shall discover&#44; that He is good&#44; and that to his 
kindness alone&#44; all owe their being&#44; that to His benevolence 
all are indebted for their preservation&#44; and that to His provi&#8211; 
dence all are compelled lo look for happiness. &#8212; &#34; No man can 
see me and live.&#34; No&#44; not whilst our soul is yet entangled in 
her mortal habiliment can she approach nearer to the Fountain 
of light &#8212; not in this state of decay can she elevate herself above 
the material world &#8212; and not in this life of change and corrup&#8211; 
tion can she comprehend the nature of the Pure Spirit &#33; &#8212; But 
his workings she can discover in the vasty ocean&#44; the star&#8211; 
spangled sky&#44; the murmuring brook&#44; the pathless desert&#44; the 
howling storm&#44; the leaf&#8211;clad forest&#44; in the summer&#39;s heat&#44; and 
the winter&#39;s frost&#59; his deeds of grace she can behold&#44; as He 
provideth sustenance to all that lives&#44; from the mighty elephant 
to the minutest insect&#59; and his universal mercy she can view 
in profound veneration&#44; as his protection is held out over the 
sinner as well as the righteous&#59; and to Him she can fly for 
refuge&#44; to him she can look for consolation&#44; as He is mighty 
to help&#44; and no one can say to him : &#34; What doest Thou &#63;&#34; &#8212; If 
then&#44; traveller on the midnight road&#44; thou art surrounded by 
dangers&#44; dangers too great for thee to overcome : reflect that 
thou art protected by the Father of mercy&#44; and that not a hair 
from thy head can fall to the ground without his suflferance&#44; 
and that nought can injure thee&#44; unless permission from Him be •

the ruthless assassin should bare his murdering blade against 
thy defenceless bosom : turn up thy eye to thy God in undi&#8211; 
minished hope&#44; for He is ever with thee&#44; ever good alike&#44; ever 
kind&#44; and mid suffering and death He can lead thee to immor&#8211; 
tal happiness. &#8212; Suffering brother&#44; who liest on the bed of sick&#8211; 
ness&#44; whose bones are filled with the pains of a burning dis&#8211; 
ease&#44; whose mouth is parched by the fatal fever&#44; whose tongue 
cleaves to the palate in speechless agony: do not despair&#59;&#44; let 
thy spirit not flag&#44; for if thou art even called hence&#44; be assured&#44; 
that He&#44; the Gracious One&#44; will comfort &#8212; support &#8212; and bless 
thee&#44; though death has&#44; closed thy mortal eye&#44; and stopped the 
functions of thy decaying body&#33; &#8212; But thou too&#44; erring bi&#39;other&#44; 
who hast forsaken the path of our God&#39;s holy law&#44; who hast 
by thy acts bid defiance to his all&#8211;wise rule&#44; who hast ever 
striven to gratify the cravings of thy unholy passions &#59; &#8212; thou&#44; 
who now mournest at the thoughts of thy great derelictions&#44; 
who despairest because of thy iniquity&#44; who art unable to re&#8211; 
lieve thyself from the horrid torment of the gnawing worm of 
conscience&#59; &#8212; thou&#44; who seest thyself forsaken by all fearthly 
help&#44; and despised by the very associates of thy crimes: &#8212; yes&#44; 
erring brother&#44; even thou despair not&#44; for though much thou 
hast sinned&#44; although great have been thy transgressions&#44; re&#8211; 
flect&#44; that the Creator is much more merciful by far than thy 
sins are great&#44; that to his beneficence there is no end&#44; and that 
it would be presumptuous folly to set bounds to His forgive&#8211; 
ness&#33; And only return with an unshaken confidence in His 
goodness&#44; only imagine not thy sins too great to be forgiven&#44; 
and thou mayest approach the footstool of Grace with hopes of 
pardon. And if thou art then chastised according to thy mis&#8211; 
deeds&#44; think not thyself rejected&#44; but consider&#44; that our ances&#8211; 
tors&#39; ingratitude was forgiven&#44; but that still a moderate punish&#8211; 
ment was inflicted&#44; to show that&#44; although God is merciful&#44; 
forgives sin and will&#44; not destroy&#44; still sin cannot go without 
retribution. This is the glory of God which was shown to 
Moses&#44; and thus it was made manifest to him&#44; how far it is be&#8211; 
coming for man to search into the ways of his Creator. 

&#34; I will let all my goodness pass before thee&#44;&#34; and so indeed 
it did happen &#59; and the power of God passed before Moses on 
Mount Sinai&#44; whilst he&#44; the chosen servant&#44; stood in the hoi&#8211;

low of the rock at Horeb&#44; and before him was proclaimed : 
&#34; The Eternal Lord is an everlasting Being&#44; merciful&#44; gracious&#44; 
long&#8211;suffering&#44; and abundant in beneficence and truth &#59; keeping 
mercy unto the thousandth generation&#44; forgiving iniquity&#44; trans&#8211; 
gression and sin&#44; but who will not suffer sin to go unpunished.&#39;&#39; 
This is the revelation of the glory of God&#44; and in this we ac&#8211; 
knowledge a kind and just Being&#44; who&#44; when forgiving sin&#44; 
punishes past transgression with paternal chastisement&#44; and thus 
shows&#44; that there is a discrimination between his adorers and 
those that forsake his service &#33; Moses&#44; the man of God&#44; saw 
the cloud in which the glory of the Most High had descended&#44; 
he heard the attributes of God announced&#44; and he bowed his 
head&#44; and threw himself prostrate on the ground&#44; adoring and 
revering his God more than ever&#44; and feeling the presumption 
of seeking the glory of the Creator in any thing else&#44; save his 
goodness&#59; where indeed is sealed up all the mystery of our be&#8211; 
ing and all the hopes of a glorious futurity&#44; after our departure 
hence to dwell for ever in a better world.

you&#44; and protect and comfort you in life and in death. Amen.

the English version&#44; although I am well aware that the word 2VJ&#44; rendered

word instead of used by Moses&#44; must refer to the quality or attri&#8211;

Add to which&#44; that Moses had asked to be made acquainted with God&#39;s

He thought deserving&#59; implying&#44; that it is not for man to ponder too much

DISCOURSE XVII. 


THE DEATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS. 

Glory and adoration to our everlasting King and almighty 
Ruler. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 
Of all things which we call certain&#44; and upon the coming of 
which we confidently rely in our earthly career : nothing is 
more certain&#44; nothing more inevitable&#44; than the close of this 
career&#44; the death of the body. &#8212; In every undertaking&#44; no matter 
how well every thing may have been arranged&#44; if even so&#44; as 
almost to preclude disappointment: disappointment may never&#8211; 
theless ensue&#44; and mar the confident hopes of the deceived 
expectant &#59; but unless the miraculous hand of God interferes&#44; to 
snatch his servants from the jaws of death&#44; as it happened with 
Enoch and Elijah&#44; no human being can escape the return to 
dust &#59;f for no human power is able to avert the impending dis&#8211; 
solution of the bodily organs&#44; or to oppose aught to the sever&#8211; 
ing of the mind from matter. It has been so decreed&#44; ever 
since our first progenitors sinned in Eden&#44; that man should be 
mortal&#44; subject to decay and corruption&#44; and that however long 
the day of death be delayed&#44; come it must&#44; nay&#44; perhaps una&#8211; 
wares&#44; like the thief in the night&#44; who enters the defenceless 
and unwatched dwelling&#44; when no one expects or dreads his 
coming. &#8212; It behoves us&#44; therefore&#44; and every other member of 
Adam&#39;s sinful race&#44; to reflect on : What is life&#63; what is death&#63; &#8212; 
what influence have both upon the constitution and nature of 
man&#63; Life&#44; to judge from our experience&#44; is the state of existence 
in which created beings act and sufier&#59; and death is the state&#44; 
when the body of these creatures ceases to act&#44; and cannot&#44; to 
appearance&#44; be benefited or harmed by the acts of others. But 
this is true of the body only&#44; and in this man is similar to 
the beast&#44; for that too acts while it lives&#44; and is beyond the 
power of harm when dead. &#8212; Yet&#44; if this were all that be&#8211;

longs to man of life&#44; not so much anxiety were needed to 
endeavour to obtain comforts and to obviate evil &#59; not then 
would it be matter of importance to acquire a knowledge 
of more than our eyes can behold or the ears hear &#59; not 
then would it be proper&#44; that men should traverse the 
trackless ocean in quest of the products of foreign climes &#59; not 
then would it be useful to restrain the passions&#44; and protect one 
from the evil intentions of the other&#59; since the mere clay&#44; which 
must perish&#44; and perish too before the thousandth part of all 
desires is satisfied&#44; deserves not more care than the beast of 
the field or the bird of heaven requires&#44; that takes its food 
wherever it finds it&#44; and that dies as soon as the animal func&#8211; 
tions cease to operate from inward decay&#44; or when it falls a prey 
to the cupidity of man or the cunning and superior strength or 
address of other animals. But in addition to the experience de&#8211; 
rived from bodily sensations&#44; and the ideas acquired by means of 
the outward organs&#44; there is a feeling within us&#44; a monitor&#44; 
which teaches&#44; that life is not confined to outward&#44; bodily actions&#44; 
and that death is not the extinction of the vital spark. &#8212; For if 
we pursue a train of thought&#44; we will soon discover&#44; that although 
as men our ideas are inseparable from matter in the various 
shapes in which it exists&#44; we are yet able to extend our search 
beyond the objects which come immediately under our view or 
of which we have any particular knowledge from personal expe&#8211; 
rience&#44; and that in fact very often our greatest joys and our most 
poignant afflictions are produced by imagination and reflection. 
What&#44; I ask&#44; has this thought&#44; unconnected with any particular 
outward object&#44; to do with the dull&#44; inert&#44; selfish mass of clay 
of which our outward forms are made&#63; Is it in the power of 
mere sentient matter to erect&#44; so to speak&#44; a structure of images&#39; 
to delight or depress the feeling&#63; In what manner could the 
animal sensation of the human system enable us to go beyond 
ourselves from a serious contemplation of nature &#8212; and next&#44; to 
let this view of nature exert a permanent influence over us&#44; so 
much so as perhaps to induce us even to change the line of con&#8211; 
duct upon which we have been hitherto acting&#63; And is it not 
notorious&#44; that many a careless one has had his attention arrest&#8211; 
ed&#44; and has been roused to reflection by contemplating&#44; in mo&#8211; 
ments of joy or sadness&#44; the great works of the great Architect&#63; 

15&#42;

174 THE DEATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS. 

&#34;But truly there is a spirit within men&#44; and the mind of God 
maketh them wise &#59;&#34; this we are told by the sacred writer&#44; and 
this our experience&#44; the child of viental reflection teaches&#44; and 
in this our nature is so much elevated above that of the brute&#59; 
and it is by the operations of mind and not of matter that we 
are taught to feel that we are creatures of a merciful God&#44; and 
that to Him our spirit returneth&#44; when its connexion with the 
perishable body is dissolved. &#8212; Life&#44; therefore&#44; is the connected 
existence of a divine spirit with an animal body&#44; which com&#8211; 
pound state enables man to do whatever is necessary for his 
self&#8211;preservation&#44; and to Judge at the same time of things pre&#8211; 
sented to the consideration of his mind&#44; which mind&#44; however&#44; 
is restrained from having a correct and perfect view in all cases 
of the nature and object of things&#44; since it is encumbered with 
sensual organs&#44; which from their constitution are disqualified 
from comprehending aught essentially different from their bodily 
substance. And death is the dismemberment of this connexion&#44; 
by which the body is rendered unfit for the further service of 
the soul&#44; and by which the latter is freed from the encumbrance 
of the clay&#59; and which dissolution renders her exempt from 
calamities and circumstances attendant upon bodily organs. If 
this is admitted to be the nature of man&#44; his life and his death: 
it follows that&#44; since death is not the annihilation of the human 
system&#44; life &#8212; so called &#8212; is a state of preparation&#44; in which it is 
our business to endeavour to acquire the means necessary to fit 
us for the impending altered state of existence &#59; unless one 
could persuade himself that human life had been so admirably 
organized without any reference to an ulterior object. When&#44; 
however&#44; we look inquiringly into nature&#44; we shall find that 
nothing is without its object&#59; since even to our obscured reason&#8211; 
ing powers the causes of many things&#44; animate and inanimate&#44; 
are apparent&#44; and we are able to show how they are connected 
link by link with the great universal principle which pervades 
all. To judge then from analogy&#44; human life also has its ulte&#8211; 
rior reason&#44; and it remains to be discovered what this reason 
may be&#59; or in other words&#44; we ought to inquire: &#34;What course 
are we to pursue&#44; according to the institution of our Creator&#44; 
that we may be ready and prepared for the altered state of ex&#8211; 
istence for which we are destined&#63;&#34; If now we had not a re&#8211;

velation of God to guide us&#44; if we had no conception of his 
intentions&#44; we might live the brief space allotted to us accord&#8211; 
ing to the impulse of our feelings &#59; we might then presume that 
actions prompted by the outward senses are the proper deeds&#44; 
by which we can prepare ourselves for the future. But we 
have a revelation of God&#39;s will&#44; we have a system of rules from 
the All&#8211;wise Father&#44; which were evidently instituted for our 
benefit&#59; and we maintain therefore that it is the law of the Lord 
which points out to us the means we are to employ to prepare 
ourselves for death. Let us then look into the book of revela&#8211; 
tion&#44; let us examine the records of God&#39;s wisdom&#44; and the tes&#8211; 
timony of his rule on earth: and we shall be informed that it is 
his wish that every man should inherit happiness&#44; and be de&#8211; 
serving of unchangeable satisfaction&#44; with this only condition&#44; 
that each and every member of the human family should earn 
this happiness for himself his own acts&#44; or regain the same 
by a sincere repentance and an humble submission to divine 
dispensation&#44; in case he has thoughtlessly lost sight for a time 
of the path of righteousness. For although to sin is contrary 
to our happiness&#44; still the Almighty wull graciously accept a 
forsaking of the evil&#59; inasmuch as our nature is not free from 
evil inclination&#44; nor our mind at all times fit to understand the 
ways of Providence&#59; and as thus sinning&#44; even with forethought&#44; 
may proceed from ignorance and inattention&#44; God will not ut&#8211; 
terly reject the sinner&#44; because He is great and cognizant of our 
weakness. Since as we have said&#44; while the soul is yet con&#8211; 
nected with the body she is prevented from having a perfect 
and correct view of the nature of all things&#44; owing to her re&#8211; 
ceiving her impressions through means of material organs&#44; 
which from their very constitution are unable to comprehend 
things essentially different in their composition from the quali&#8211; 
ties of matter. This being the case in our state of mixed ex&#8211; 
istence&#44; of flesh and spirit&#44; it is not to be wondered at&#44; that&#44; 
misled by appearance&#44; we may be induced&#44; unless we guard 
ourselves carefully&#44; to regard that as important which is really 
trifling&#44; and even to mistake the evil for the good. If then we 
act from these erroneous impressions&#44; trusting to our knowledge 
and judgment as efficient guides&#44; it is almost necessary that we 
should be led into innumerable errors&#44; and practise the evil in&#8211;

stead of the good&#44; and offend our heavenly King by the wick&#8211; 
edness of our works. But if we&#44; fully alive to our imperfec&#8211; 
tions and watchful over the persuasions of bodily organs&#44; firmly 
resolve to be guided by the instructions of divine revelation: it 
is necessary that we should become virtuous &#59; nay more&#44; that 
we should be enabled to go counter to our natural impulses&#44; if 
they interfere with the dictates of God&#39;s will&#59; and we may thus 
be rendered righteous&#44; as far as being righteous is compatible 
with our nature. 

And since now death is the aim and termination of earthly 
life&#44; since from the moment of our birth we verge onward to 
eternity: how sweet must be the departure of him who&#44; having 
always the certain end in view&#44; invariably acted in a manner 
calculated to enable him to enter into&#44; the impending altered 
state of being&#44; into the more immediate presence of God&#44; free 
from the faults which the holy law interdicts &#33; &#8212; Imagine to 
yourselves&#44; brethren&#44; the righteous laid on the bed of his last 
sickness&#44; think of him how his peace is made with God and 
men&#44; how serenely and tranquilly he may look upon death&#44; 
which will once more and indissolubly unite him with his 
Father &#8212; see him how his eye is unclouded&#44; whilst. all around 
him weep &#8212; imagine this&#44; and then answer me&#44; is not such a 
death an object worth living for&#63; Who will say a long life is 
misspent&#44; when such an end crowns the suffering mortal&#44; when 
it is almost evident&#44; even to us&#44; that immortal glory awaits 
him&#63; &#8212; But reverse the picture&#44; and behold the careless sinner&#44; 
to whom it always appeared that the gratification of the senses 
was the greatest good&#44; to whom the acts of religion seemed 
unmeaning deeds of slavish worship&#44; to whom it could not be 
made intelligible that the providence of God watches over 
every act and thought&#44; to reward or punish after death&#44; as well 
as during life : see him&#44; how the blush of shame at last mantles 
on his cheek&#44; confounded at his now exposed sins&#59; behold him 
standing in speechless degradation before his earthly judges&#44; 
who will condernn him to the solitary prison for the wrong 
done to his neighbour&#39;s property&#44; or order him to execution for 
having dyed his hands in a brother&#39;s blood &#59; or if he even be not 
publicly exposed&#44; but suffered to drag on a miserable exist&#8211; 
ence&#44; a burthen to himself and an intolerable load to others&#44;since&#44;

disturb his waking and sleeping thoughts: imagine&#44;brethren&#44;such 
a sinner at his end&#44; and what must his sensations be &#33; He regards

himself &#8212; and yet&#44; he must hence&#44; no longer respite can be grant&#8211;

others&#59; the crowd is admonished to take warning of his igno&#8211; 
minious end&#44; historians will dwell on his horrible agonies&#44; his 
unmitigated sufferings&#44; his dreadful imprecations &#59; and speak&#44; 
who would not willingly undergo the greatest bodily pains&#44; if 
assured that his departure should be smoothed&#44; and be made free 
from such trials&#63; And yet we see persons who run the course 
of vice&#44; exposing themselves thus voluntarily to ignominy and 
shame &#59; but this is owing to their forgetting that they are mor&#8211; 
tal&#44; and because they imagine&#44; that when they have succeeded 
in veiling their misdeeds from public view&#44; they have nothing 
to apprehend from the interference of Providence &#59; when they 
should know that to God they must return&#44; whether they deny 
his superintendence or not&#44; and render an account before Him&#44; 
the Judge&#44; to whom naught is concealed&#44; and to whom the past&#44; 
the present&#44; and the future are alike known &#33; But the j&#8211;ight&#8211; 
eous considers well&#44; that &#34; he is dust&#44; and to dust he must 
return&#44;&#34; and knows that God observes all his ways &#59; he there&#8211; 
fore trains his mind betimes to an obedience to the will of 
Heaven&#44; and when his hour of departure then arrives&#44; he 
descends to the grave like the refulgent sun into the silvery 
ocean at the close of a serene summer&#39;s day&#44; shedding with 
his last ray a glorious&#44; mellow&#44; and hallowed light&#44; as he 
becomes gradually concealed from the enraptured view of the 
admiring beholder &#33; &#8212; It was inspired by feelings of this nature&#44; 
influenced by a knowledge of the beneficial effects of the divine 
law&#44; that the heathen prophet&#44; Bileam&#44; spoke by the inspira&#8211; 
tion of the Almighty&#39;s sacred mind&#44; as follows:

178 THE DEATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS. 

It is indeed for such an end that we are to work and exert 
our energies &#59; for what is all the happiness that may fall to our 
lot on this earth&#44; if we are at last to perish away like the beast 
of the field&#44; or what would be almost worse&#44; if it were not that 
existence even under suffering is better far than non&#8211;existence&#44; 
to be doomed to punishment after death for a period which our 
sins may demand from the justice of God &#63; Well must it be for 
each of us&#44; if we take our life and its close daily and hourly 
into consideration&#44; if w&#44;e suffer neither prejudice nor self&#8211;love 
to blind us&#44; and to persuade us to close our eyes upon our fail&#8211; 
ings and transgressions&#39;. We are but too apt to turn away our 
view from the consequences of one act&#44; for we say&#44; it is but a 
single folly &#59; but every folly&#44; every fault&#44; every sin&#44; will dis&#8211; 
qualifjr us in some respect from relishing the good and holy &#59; 
and where is the necessity of purchasing salvation by repent&#8211; 
ance&#44; when we can enjoy ease of mind and the good&#8211;will of 
God and men by an uniform virtuous conduct&#63; To repent when 
we have sinned&#44; to fly to the arms of our merciful Father in 
sincere confidence of his forgiveness&#44; shows a filial devotion 
to the Almighty&#44; which should be encouraged in every instance 
upon the discovery of an aberration from the righteous way. 
But as repentance is at best but a remedy&#44; it must be evident&#44; 
that it would be far better to adhere always to the law &#59; since 
if we act otherwise&#44; we may be overtaken by death before we 
have time to alter our course &#59; and whom can we blame for our 
dying with all our sins on our head&#44; with all our follies unfor&#8211; 
given&#44; except it be ourselves&#44; who&#44; careless of our spiritual 
welfare&#44; disregard the warning voice which daily speaks to us&#44; 
by the example of others&#44; that life is short&#44; and its termination 
uncertain &#63; &#8212; Besides this great advantage of an uniform virtuous 
life&#44; there is yet another&#44; which is&#44; that it makes the person so 
acting always beloved by all the world &#59; and when the good 
depart&#44; no matter what age they may have reached&#44; their place 
will always seem unfilled by any one of those left behind &#59; and 
when an excellent person is removed&#44; it strikes us as though 
something necessary to our comfort had been withdrawn. We 
do not pity the death of the good&#44; for we feel that their happi&#8211; 
ness is well secured &#59; but we lament for ourselves&#44; that we can 
no longer enjoy their example and be improved by their pre&#8211;

cepts. But let the wicked die&#44; how it almost makes us shud&#8211; 
der to think of their pain&#44; their inglorious perishing&#59; and an 
involuntary feeling of anguish will come over us&#44; and we must 
lament their unhappiness&#44; although compelled to acknowledge&#44; 
that the world has gained by their removal from amongst active 
beings&#44; since now they have it no longer in their power to 
harm others and to injure themselves by their deeds of wicked&#8211; 
ness. &#8212; This is but a small portion of the difference existing 
between the death of the righteous and of the wicked&#44; and the 
few distinguishing traits here exhibited will doubtlessly be 
enough to demonstrate the superiority of virtue over vice&#44; 
although there were no greater pre&#8211;em.inence to the former over 
the latter. 

Although it is unbecoming to make personal allusions to 
the faults of any individual in a public address&#44; I do not 
apprehend that any objection can be made to my passing a 
deserved tribute of respect to the worth of a departed friend&#44; 
one to whom nearly&#44; if not all of those who now hear me&#44; used 
to pay the homage due to age and virtue. I speak of our excel&#8211; 
lent sister&#42; and friend&#44; whom we followed this week to the 
grave. She lived long&#44; and perhaps as happily&#44; as but few mor&#8211; 
tals can ever expect to live. But she deserved this long life 
and this happiness&#44; for during all the period of eighty and five 
years&#44; the breath of slander dared never to fasten upon her&#44; and 
under all the trials to which she was exposed in common with all 
the rest of mankind&#44; she exhibited the fortitude well becomins 
a daughter of Israel&#44; who knows her God&#44; and knows too&#44; that 
to confide in Him is the best support. And also the esteem of 
all who became acquainted with her was cheerfully yielded&#44; 
and unless I am much deceived&#44; there are few or none&#44; that 
did not admire her social and religious virtues&#44; and by whom 
she was not regarded with filial reverence. But at last the hour 
of her dissolution came&#44; and although the close of her life was 

&#42; The late Mrs. Rebecca Phillips&#44; widow of Jonas Phillips&#44; and daughter 
of David Mendes Machado&#44; formerly Reader of the Congregation Sheerith 
Israel in New York&#44; who died about the year 5510&#44; &#40;1750). &#8212; This ex&#8211; 
cellent woman lived to an age exceeding eighty&#8211;five years&#44; and departed this 
life on Tuesday the 10th of Tamuz&#44; in the year 5591&#44; corresponding with 
21st of June&#44; 1831.

painful&#44; yet in mercy the illness that preceded it was of but 
few days&#39; duration&#59; and full of years and honours&#44; we consigned 
her to the tomb&#44; there to sleep till the Father of all wakens the 
slumberers in the dust to everlasting life and happiness. &#8212; 
Should not the example of this excellent person animate us to 
imitate her good deeds&#44; and endeavour to avoid any errors 
&#40;since all mortals are liable to err) which we may discover in 
her ways &#63; Such a line of conduct will render us good and 
religious&#44; and ensure us the favour of God and the love of men. 
Perhaps&#44; however&#44; the uniform prosperity of our late sister may 
not attend every one of us &#59; but we ought to consider&#44; that not 
for reward should we be good&#44; but that through weal and 
wo we are bound to adhere to our righteousness&#44; taking the 
law of God as our guide&#8211;star to the haven of happiness&#59; so that 
living faithfully in the faith and fear of the Lord&#44; we may at 
the last be able to breathe out our spirit as did the righteous 
men of old&#44; and deserve&#44; that our end should be like theirs&#44; 
untrammeled by sin&#44; and freed from the pollution to which our 
mortal body and sinful propensities may have inadvertently 
exposed us. 

May the God of our fathers bless us all with his grace&#44; and 
render our life free from intense bodily suffering&#44; and give us 
every day our necessary support&#44; so that we may be exempt 
from corroding care and temptation to sin &#59; and when the hour 
of our death has come may He make easy for us our departure 
hence&#44; and&#44; receiving us in favour&#44; bestow on us the undying 
light of his presence&#44; and the reward which He has laid by for 
those who confide in Him&#44; and observe his statutes. Amen.

DISCOURSE XVIII. 

THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL. 

Protector of Israel&#33; comfort thy people in their mourning&#44; 
and pardon their transgressions&#44; and lighten the pressure of 
their burden&#44; and remove the shame which they now suffer 
among nations. And 0&#44; send the angel of mercy to heal their 
wounds&#44; and redeem them from destruction&#44; and say to them 
in the words of thy inspired one: &#34;I have found a ransom &#33;&#34; 
Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

Of all virtues&#44; which grace human nature&#44; patriotism is one 
which possesses something so holy&#44; a certain approach to angelic 
disinterestedness: that we may freely say&#44; that&#44; next to assist&#8211; 
ing an enemy in the hour of his distress&#44; it is the noblest feel&#8211; 
ing in which we can indulge. I allude not to the ambition 
which assumes the garb of patriotism&#44; merely to elevate itself 
to distinction in the state &#59; I speak not of the murderous lust&#44; 
which animates the soldier of fortune in his search of an im&#8211; 
perishable name by deeds of daring and violence&#59; but of him&#44; 
who stands forth in his country&#39;s defence&#44; when danger ap&#8211; 
proaches&#44; regardless of consequences&#59; and of the inobtrusive 
citizen who in his humble sphere yields every thing &#8212; life&#44; 
liberty&#44; and wealth &#8212; in the service of his home&#44; his own native 
land : for he only is a true patriot to whom can be awarded 
the merit of loving his country for its own sake&#44; but not for 
the purpose of obtaining lucre&#44; power&#44; or renown. &#8212; Let such a 
patriot be ever so distant from the home of his childhood&#44; ever 
so far from the land of his birth&#44; to it his mind will revert &#59; 
nay&#44; though his countrymen have treated him with ingratitude 
or undeserved wrong&#44; he will still be willing to act the part of 
a good citizen&#44; despite of the ill&#8211;treatment he may have en&#8211; 
countered. And the exile too will think with fond regret of

the spot&#44; where his parents repose in their graves&#44; to the phice&#44; 
where he first indulged in his youthful plays&#59; and no land upon 
earth can awaken in him those feelings of ardour and devotion&#44; 
which his native soil calls up within his bosom. &#8212; If we apply 
these general principles to our own particular condition&#44; it be&#8211; 
hoves us to inquire : &#34; Which is the country that the collective 
nation of Israelites can call their own land &#63;&#34; Is it this land&#44; 
where freedom dwells&#63; Is it the land of the Spaniard&#44; where 
the name of freedom is almost unknown &#63; Is it the wide desert 
of central Asia&#44; where the barbarous Tatar feeds his countless 
herds&#63; Is it the country&#44; where the Russian despot rules with 
tyrannic sway&#63; &#8212; No&#33; no&#33; it is the favoured land of the Kast&#44; 
where the Israelites dwelled of yore&#44; it is the land which God 
covenanted to give to Abraham&#44; to Isaac&#44; and to Jacob&#44; and to 
their seed after them &#59; it is the land of the Lebanon&#44; which the 
dying prophet desired so ardently to see&#59; it is the land&#44; where 
the once beautiful Jerusalem yet stands although in ruins &#59; it is 
the land&#44; where stood in olden days the sacred temple&#44; resplen&#8211; 
dent once in all the beauty of holiness&#44; but which our trans&#8211; 
gressions&#44; alas&#33; caused to be twice destroyed&#44; when our people 
fell into the hand of their enemies&#33; This is the land which is 
the Israelite&#39;s home&#44; and he should always regard himself as 
having an interest in its soil&#44; although he has been born in 
exile&#44; in the country of the stranger&#44; far from the banks of the 
lowly Jordan &#59; for there it was&#44; where our national glory reach&#8211; 
ed its highest elevation&#44; and because we have remained scattered 
and disunited&#44; ever since we were driven thence. &#8212; Do not mis&#8211; 
understand me as saying&#44; that you should not regard the coun&#8211; 
try in which you live as your own&#44; and that you should not 
endeavour to serve it according to the best of your abilities &#59; 
for we are commanded by the prophet&#44; speaking in the name 
of God&#44; &#34; to seek the peace of the city to which we have been 
banished.&#34; As Jews&#44; therefore&#44; and believers in the revealed 
law and the prophets&#44; we are bound to obey the laws of the 
land and to uphold the authorities in every instance&#44; where their 
edicts are not at variance with the commandments of God. 
Every Israelite is accordingly obliged to contribute to the main&#8211; 
tainance of the state&#44; and it would be unpardonable in any one 
to endeavour to avoid paying the government dues by any frau&#8211;

dulent device whatsoever. In inculcating&#44; therefore&#44; a love 
for Palestine&#44; it must hy no means be understood as in any 
manner teaching and enforcing a diminished love for our pre&#8211; 
sent abode&#59; nay more&#44; according to our rules&#44; it is wrong to 
offend against the laws of a despotic country&#59; how much more 
then ought we to observe this regulation in this and other coun&#8211; 
tries&#44; where we have a small share in the legislation&#44; by having 
the equal right to vote for the representatives of the people&#44; 
who enact the laws. &#8212; Still&#44; as we have said in the beginning of 
these remarks&#44; the home of the Israelite is the distant land of 
Moria&#44; where the glory of the Lo&#34;rd used to shine and instruct 
the children of his choice &#59; and if we take but a rapid view of 
our national history&#44; it can be readily shown that we have lost 
much by having been hurried from the boundaries of our own &#8212; 
our father&#8211;land. 

After the flood had swept away the sinful race of men from 
the surface of the earth&#44; and left Noah alone with his family to 
repeople the earth : we find that those born after this catas&#8211; 
trophe learnt in an incredibly short time to dispense with the 
service of God&#44; undeterred by the destruction of their prede&#8211; 
cessors&#44; and they worshipped the most disgusting creatures of 
their fancy&#59; nay&#44; that their apostacy proceeded so far as to 
make it dangerous for any one to avow his attachment to the 
Creator. It was then that a man arose in the land of Chaldea&#44; 
whose name was Abram&#44; the ancestor&#44; as you all know&#44; of our 
people&#44; who acknowledged and worshipped the Most High 
alone&#44; the Maker of heaven and earth. The patriarch&#44; ordered 
by Him he adored&#44; left his native land and his father&#39;s house&#44; 
and wandered unto the neighbourhood of Hebron in the land 
of Canaan&#44; where he erected an altar and spread abroad the 
light which was within him&#44; and he taught an ignorant people 
the knowledge of that Being&#44; to whom alone their reverence 
was due. Now it must be observed&#44; that it was this same 
land&#44; at present known under the name of Palestine&#44; which 
God promised to him as an inheritance for his descendants &#59; 
and He told him&#44; that they should return to it&#44; after a tempo&#8211; 
rary absence&#44; at the expiration of four centuries&#44; and be left in 
the quiet possession of it&#44; whilst they observed the covenant 
and precepts of the Lord. It therefore came to pass&#44; that when 

    <pb n="184"/>

184 THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL. 

the Israelites&#44; the descendants of Abraham by his grandson 
Jacob&#44; surnamed Israel&#44; had been released from Egypt&#44; a de&#8211; 
putation of the people entered the land of Canaan&#44; exactly at 
the expiration of the appointed time&#44; to survey the country 
they were ordered to conquer. And when they had been led 
through the wilderness for a period of forty years&#44; under the 
guidance of Moses&#44; detained so long for their rebellion&#44; ten 
times repeated&#44; and for the sake of fortifying them in faith 
towards the Lord : they were led by Joshua&#44; the servant and 
disciple of Moses&#44; over the Jordan into the land promised unto 
their ancestors. Here they dwelt for the space of nine hun&#8211; 
dred years&#44; governed by their own laws&#44; administered by men 
chosen by and from amongst themselves. And here too they 
might have dwelt for ever&#44; with none to make them afraid&#44; if 
they had been mindful of the covenant&#44; and had observed the 
statutes which alone were the firm foundation of their common&#8211; 
wealth. But&#44; for the law of God they substituted the dictates 
of their own fancy&#59; and following the example of other nations&#44; 
they worshipped idols&#44; things that could not save&#44; and even&#8211; 
tually neglected altogether the precepts of the law. &#8212; It had 
been foretold to them by Moses&#44; that apostacy would be fol&#8211; 
lowed by expulsion from their lovely inheritance&#59; and they 
had&#44; therefore&#44; every reason to expect the threatened punish&#8211; 
ment as the instantaneous consequence of their transgression. 
But the Father of mercy&#44; knowing the weakness of human 
nature&#44; delayed his anger for a long time &#59; and to warn the 
people&#44; and in order to recal them from their errors&#44; He sent 
men&#44; inspired by superior knowledge and renowned for their 
piety&#44; to incite their sinning brethren to repentance &#59; but all 
was in vain&#59; for if even one generation returned and sought 
the Lord&#44; the succeeding one added wicked sinfulness to the 
apostacy of their predecessors&#59; till at length it became an act 
of mercy to expel the children of Jacob from their land&#44; to 
obviate by the timely punishment the utter estrangement of the 
chosen people of God. It therefore happened&#44; that the king&#8211; 
dom of Israel&#44; so called&#44; was subverted by the Assyrians&#44; who 
drove away the inhabitants to the cities of Media and to other 
places&#44; and substituted in their stead various foreign tribes&#44; all 
subject to the sway of the Assyrian king. &#8212; The kingdom of 

    <pb n="185"/>

THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL. 185 

Judah&#44; composed of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin&#44; together 
with the Levites&#44; who had been banished from the rival state&#44; 
ought now to have taken warning at the example of awful re&#8211; 
tribution exhibited before their eyes. In fact&#44; Hezekiah&#44; son of 
Ahaz&#44; king of Judah&#44; rejected his father&#39;s idolatry&#44; and governed 
the people in piety&#44; a worthy successor of his glorious ancestor&#44; 
David&#59; he re&#8211;established the holy worship&#59; and in his days it was 
really that the prophecy of Isaiah&#44; in calling the child&#44; expected 
at the time when Ahaz was threatened by the kings of Israel 
and Syria&#44; &#34;the Prince of Peace&#34; was fulfilled&#44; and it seemed 
that the favour of God had asfain been bestowed on the exhaust&#8211; 
ed land. But the pious king was gathered unto his fathers&#44; and 
all the good accomplished by him was more than counter&#8211; 
balanced by his unworthy son Menasseh&#44; and by all the suc&#8211; 
ceeding kings&#44; with the sole exception of Josiah&#44; who was&#44; as 
we are told&#44; sincerely repentant&#44; a true adorer of God&#44; and an 
enemy to all apostacy. The punishment&#44; therefore&#44; so long de&#8211; 
nounced&#44; could now be no longer averted &#59; and when&#44; under the 
reign of Zedekiah&#44; the last king of David&#39;s line&#44; the measure 
of our sins was nearly overflowing&#44; Nebuchadnezzar&#44; permitted 
by the justice of Heaven&#44; conquered the holy city&#44; and led the 
remainder of the Israelites&#44; that had escaped the slaughter&#44; cap&#8211; 
tives to Babylon&#44; and he left none but the poorer classes&#44; who 
however soon fled to Egypt&#44; to escape the dreaded vengeance 
of the Babylonians for the murder of Gedaliah. Thus was the 
strength of Israel broken &#59; thus was all that was grand and 
beautiful demolished&#44; and Palestine&#44; once so populous and pow&#8211; 
erful&#44; was left without an inhabitant&#59; till at length God inclined 
the heart of Cyrus&#44; king of Persia&#44; to mercy&#44; and he permitted 
the Jews to return and to rebuild their city and temple. Let 
us observe&#44; that by this return of the captives&#44; the Israelitish 
nation was not restored &#59; since the ten tribes&#44; who formerly had 
composed the kingdom of Israel&#44; were yet left in banishment &#59;&#8211; 
and to this day the researches of travellers and wise men have 
not been able to trace their fate &#59; and we are unable to tell 
whether they are living in some remote land as firm adherents 
of the God of their fathers&#44; whose chastening hand they have 
felt&#59; or whether they have&#44; mingling with the nations&#44; learned 
to do as they do&#44; and are now a part of the wild Afghans or

some other barbarous tribe. This deplorable dismemberment&#44; 
the consequence of the crimes of our ancestors&#44; followed in the 
train of the destruction of the first temple &#59; and where has been&#44; 
since that period&#44; the pomp and glory of David and Solomon&#39;s 
reign&#63; the distinguished religious knowledge of the days of 
Hezekiah &#63; or the fervent zeal displayed by all classes under 
Josiah&#63; and when had we the wise admonitions of the pro&#8211; 
phets&#63; or the animating strains of the Psalmists after the re&#8211; 
building of the temple&#63; &#8212; But this second temple was never&#8211; 
theless in a measure much more glorious than the first&#44; since&#44; 
during the period of its existence&#44; the name of the Lord became 
more known to the nations of the earth&#44; and even the enemies 
of the Jews were&#44; by their intercourse with them&#44; taught a 
purer law&#44; and they caught a glimpse as it were of the pure 
truths which are contained in our code. The false ideas of 
Grecian philosophers with regard to the divine nature received 
a shock from which they have never recovered&#44; by the trans&#8211; 
lation&#44; and consequent farther diffusion&#44; of the Pentateuch by 
the seventy elders under the Egyptian king&#44; Ptolemy Lagos &#59; 
and thus it was verified&#44; that &#34; the glory of the second house 
should be greater&#44; than that of the first&#44;&#34; built by Solomon&#44; 
the outward splendour of which far surpassed that of the one 
erected by the handful of exiles&#44; whom Cyrus permitted to 
revisit their desolate land. Add to which&#44; that idolatry&#44; as a 
national crime&#44; was unknown during the entire period under 
discussion&#44; and that the individual zeal of a great number of 
pious persons was now continually exerted to preserve the law 
unmixed&#44; by multiplying copies of the same and expounding 
obscure texts: and we have enough to assert&#44; that the predic&#8211; 
tion of the prophet was literally accomplished. &#8212; But amid all 
this greatness&#44; crime made again its baleful inroads upon our 
state &#59; and the barter for the sacred office of high&#8211;priest &#59; the 
streams of innocent blood that deluged the streets of Jerusalem &#59; 
the dissention of parties&#59; the calling in of the Romans to settle 
domestic disputes for the supreme rule : all&#44; all&#44; tended to sap 
the foundation of the edifice&#44; and once more the structure of the 
Jewish state was pulled down&#44; and every thing was overwhelm&#8211; 
ed in one&#44; vast&#44; dreadful&#44; annihilation&#33; Yes&#44; it was under the 
Roman emperors&#44; that year after year the independence of the

Jews was circumscribed within narrower limits &#59; till the people 
were goaded into revolt during the reign of Nero&#44; and the pro&#8211; 
tracted war that ensued did not cease&#44; till Jerusalem was de&#8211; 
molished and the temple laid in ashes&#33; In a discourse of last 
year&#44; I endeavoured to sketch in few words the horrors of this 
war&#44; the obstinacy of the defence&#44; and the unremitting activity 
of the assailants&#33; But what tongue can describe the misery&#44; 
the agony&#44; and the painfulness of the unavailing struggle&#44; when 
the devoted and heroic defenders at length saw the walls broken&#44; 
and the enemy pouring in through every breach &#59; and when 
they&#44; the famished&#44; after having in vain attempted to stem the 
onward torrent&#44; by exposing their breasts to the merciless in&#8211; 
vaders&#44; beheld the temple &#8212; for which all their energies had 
been exerted &#8212; committed to the flames &#59; and when they saw 
the devouring&#44; unquenchable fire seize on the holy of holies&#44; 
and the unwavering priests of the Lord perish at the steps 
of the altar&#44; which even in death they would not forsake&#33; &#8212; 
This happened on the ninth of Ab&#44; a day marked for the un&#8211; 
fortunate events which befel our people&#44; and on it the sun of 
Israel set&#59; and the contest after this time was merely the last 
throb of the expiring heart which ceased at length to beat&#44; after 
the mortal shafts of the enemy had pierced it to the core. It 
were well if we could say&#44; that&#44; with the destruction of our 
metropolis&#44; the fury of the Romans had been appeased &#59; but 
no&#44; they even unsheathed their swords and plunged them deep 
into the lifeless corse&#44; for those that had escaped the famine&#44; 
the sword&#44; and the conflagration which devastated their native 
land&#44; were exposed to new cruelties by their rutliless captors &#59; 
some were kept to struggle with wild beasts for the amusement 
of the refined Romans in their hours of leisure&#44; and others 
were reserved for a worse fate even&#44; since they were sold as 
slaves in distant lands &#59; and they&#44; who had been reared amid 
luxury and elegance&#44; were compelled to bend their necks be&#8211; 
neath the yokes of their new Egyptian task&#8211;masters&#33; Was not 
this a dreadful fulfilment of the denunciation of Moses&#44; who 
said: &#34; And the Lord will bring thee back to Egypt in ships &#8212; 
and you shall be offered there for sale as male and female slaves&#44; 
and there shall be no buyers&#63;&#34; Thus&#44; my brethren&#44; was our 
unfortunate people treated&#44; because they had not served their

God in sincerity&#59; and for refusing obedience to his mild sway&#44; 
they were trodden under foot and spurned&#44; and their sorrow 
even scoffed at&#44; by those whom he brought over them as the 
instruments of his righteous wrath and indignation&#33; And ask 
we: &#34;What was the subsequent fate of the Jews&#63;&#34; we shall 
be answered by the history of many dark centuries&#44; that they 
were carried into every corner of God&#39;s earth&#44; and that in 
every spot&#44; where they obtained a place of refuge&#44; persecution 
overtook them&#44; and they were surrendered to scorn&#44; to pillage&#44; 
to stripes&#44; to torture&#44; and to the scaffold. &#8212; Have we not then 
cause to mourn&#63; are we not bound&#44; as members of the Jewish 
nation&#44; to pay the patriot&#39;s homage to our far off land&#63; and 
what tribute can we offer&#44; but our sorrow for the overthrown 
walls&#44; our grief for the devastated homes&#44; and our tears for the 
countless millions who fell manfully fighting for their land&#44; and 
for the altars of their God &#59; &#8212; and for those who were butchered&#44; 
because they were descendants of the proscribed race &#59; &#8212; and 
for those&#44; who bled on the scaffold&#44; because they could not be 
base hypocrites enough to deny the truth of the everlasting 
covenant of the Mosaic law &#63; &#8212; But&#44; asks one : &#34; Why shall we 
mourn at this distance from Palestine&#44; and after the lapse of so 
many centuries&#63; what can that regret avail&#44; which we breathe 
forth in our Synagogues and houses&#63; will this reunite the 
Israelites&#63; will this rebuild the temple&#63;&#34; &#8212; To a truly feeling 
mind&#44; to a heart alive to the sublimities of the heavenly law&#44; 
no answer need be made to such questions&#44; for it were useless 
to illustrate that which to pious men explains itself. But we 
will speak to him&#44; who perhaps may waver&#44; and whose heart 
is not entire with the Lord &#59; perhaps our labour may be re&#8211; 
wafded by succeeding to draw into our circle another brother 
to unite with the mourners for Zion &#33; &#8212; It is asked &#59; &#34; Why 
shall we regret Jerusalem in a land where universal freedom 
reigns&#63;&#34; But let me ask in return: Do all Israelites dwell 
here&#63; where is the multitude&#44; who yet suffers every indignity 
in the country of the impious ruler of Russia&#44; who dares 
to style himself self&#8211;ruler&#44; as though he were not amenable to 
God&#39;s tribunal for his deeds of oppression&#63; are those Israelites

feigned apostacy &#63; Yes&#44; brethren&#44; unless Jews in all countries 
of the world had equal freedom&#44; this objection cannot bear the 
semblance of reason&#44; for none can be bold enough to assert&#44; that 
the Israelites are saved by being at rest in one&#44; or a few coun&#8211; 
tries at most&#44; whilst every where else they are suffering and 
oppressed. But even suppose&#44; that in the process of time the 
march of civilization were to break down the walls of preju&#8211; 
dice&#44; and induce all the rulers of the earth to place Jews upon 
a perfect equality with their other subjects or citizens : even 
then&#44; I say&#44; we should have cause to observe&#44; annually&#44; the day 
of the destruction of Jerusalem as a day of humiliation and 
fasting&#44; since under the most favourable aspect of things&#44; we 
cannot indulge the hope&#44; that we shall be permitted to be 
governed by our own laws&#59; and let happen what will&#44; we can 
never form our scattered remains into one united society&#44; till it 
pleases God to restore us to our land &#59; and thus be we slaves or 
citizens&#44; as Jews we should ever regard the non&#8211;possession of 
Palestine as a great national evil&#44; which we cannot enough 
deplore. For let us ask: &#34;Where is the temple &#8212; where the pub&#8211; 
lic sacrifices &#8212; where the imposing worship on the Day of 
Atonement &#8212; where the outpouring of the divine inspiration 
through the Urim and Thumim &#63; Where&#44; again&#44; are the august 
Sanhedrin &#8212; where can we find the simple&#44; just&#44; and prompt 
judgment of the Mosaic code &#63;&#34; &#8212; All&#44; all&#44; has been lost by the 
destruction of Jerusalem and by the dispersion of the tribes of 
Jacob &#33; 

Again&#44; it is asked : &#34; Why should we mourn at this distance 
of time &#63;&#34; But let me ask in return : Does distance of time les&#8211; 
sen the evil&#63; Are we less exiles&#44; because we have been exiles 
for near eighteen hundred years &#63; or&#44; do you wish it said&#44; that 
Jews have lost their national feelings because they no longer 
live in Palestine&#44; and because the punishment inflicted has been 
so long continued on account of their obduracy in not repenting &#63; 
But the time has not yet come&#44; when it can be said with truth&#44; 
that we have ceased to feel like Jews&#44; and let us breathe the fer&#8211; 
vent hope&#44; that such a time may never come. And I appeal to 
you all&#44; brethren&#44; whether you are not always affected with 
sorrow at hearing&#44; that in any quarter of the globe our brethren 
are oppressed. What proves this&#44; but that no time nor place 

    <pb n="190"/>

can reconcile us&#44; not even the most careless&#44; to be indifferent 
spectators of the maltreatment of the Jew as such &#59; and should 
we not then mourn for the event&#44; which was the beginning of 
all these oft&#8211;repeated calamities &#63; 

And in reference to the last objection : &#34;What good can this 
regret do &#63; Can it rebuild the temple&#44; or reunite the Israel&#8211; 
ites&#63;&#34; We reply&#44; that much good may result to the Jewish 
community&#44; by their turning unitedly every year to the state 
of their former splendour and glory&#39;&#44; with a jegret which such 
sad reflection is calculated to call up&#44; for it must tend to bind 
all closely together&#44; when every one feels&#44; that he is in truth a 
member of a noble people&#44; and that all the evil effects of dis&#8211; 
tance of time and place&#44; of scorn&#44; of difficulties&#44; of temptations&#44; 
have been&#44; and will always be unable to sever those sacred ties&#44; 
which bind the Israelites&#44; individually and collectively to their 
Father in heaven. If&#44; then&#44; our regret cannot rebuild the tem&#8211; 
ple&#44; it will keep the religion of our forefathers alive and active 
in our hearts &#59; if our sorrow cannot reunite the nation in one 
land&#44; it will at least link together the hearts of all believers&#44; be 
they ever so far separated by oceans&#44; by deserts&#44; by the eternal 
snows of the pole&#44; or the burning sand of Africa&#39;s inhospitable 
clime. More than this need not be urged in reply to the 
foregoing objections : for if religion is not entirely out of the 
mind&#44; the short explanations given must be amply sufficient to 
remove them. 

Let us then&#44; brethren&#44; unite from year to year&#44; whilst we live 
in foreign lands&#44; to pay the patriot&#39;s tribute&#44; the exile&#39;s tear&#44; to 
the deserted homes of our ancestors &#59; and let us devote the days 
of fasting appointed by the prophets&#44; to mourn over the fallen 
glory of Jacob that has departed&#44; over the sun of Israel that 
has set. &#8212; But no &#33; the sun of Israel has not set &#8212; for ever &#59; true&#44; 
his light is now veiled&#44; his rays we seek in vain with our 
agonized vision &#59; his warmth no more quickens the blood in our 
veins. Yet the time&#44; nevertheless&#44; will come&#44; when he will 
shine forth again with redoubled splendour&#59; when his light will 
be seven&#8211;fold to what it was before its obscuration&#44; when nations 
will bask in his beams&#44; and foreign climes be quickened into 
eternal life by his refulgence. &#8212; But&#44; alas &#33; for our sinful people&#44; 
they delay the time of salvation by their thoughtlessness &#59; they 

    <pb n="191"/>

THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL. 191 

care not for the promised redemption &#59; nay&#44; some even hug the 
chains of their slavery&#44; and say: &#34; We wish not freedom.&#34; 
Can we then wonder&#44; that the anger of God is yet burning&#63; 
Can we be surprised&#44; that our misfortunes are renewed from 
time to time&#44; when we trust to the aid of men for emancipation&#44; 
as we are willing to call it&#44; and accept our birthright as a boon 
from the hands of our former enemies&#44; and forget that it is God 
who procures us enlargement&#63; Have we any right to complain 
of persecution&#44; when we are ever ready to break the laws&#44; as 
.soon as the bonds of servitude are a little loosened &#8212; when we 
are always glad to escape from the burdens of religion&#44; when 
the chains of the oppressor are rendered somewhat less galling&#63; 
And add to this ingratitude towards God&#44; the want of love one 
Jew feels for the other&#59; and see how little unanimity exists 
even in the small councils of our scattered communities &#59; and 
observe how apt every one is willing to play the tyrant in his 
little circle&#44; when he is raised to authority &#59; and the want of 
obedience&#44; which many display to wholesome regulations&#44; 
enacted for the government of the congregations : and then 
answer me&#44; what kind of commonwealth could be formed out of 
such materials&#63; No&#44; God is just&#44; it is ourselves who retard our 
happiness &#59; it is we ourselves&#44; who delay the day of salvation. 
But as there are&#44; thanks be to God&#44; always some in every 
country&#44; in every town&#44; nay&#44; perhaps in every house&#44; in whose 
heart there are seated piety&#44; resignation&#44; meekness&#44; and bro&#8211; 
therly love&#44; so also will the favourable hour of deliverance 
arrive&#44; though tardily. And how can we fear of its not coming 
on account of the delay &#63; Some fearful heart shudders at the 
idea of eighteen hundred years of exile&#59; but&#44; trembler&#33; what 
are a thousand years in the eyes of God&#44; but &#34;as the day that 
passeth&#44; as the watch of a night&#63;&#34; Again we must consider&#44; 
that our captivity has been of incalculable benefit to mankind. 
Look around you&#44; a knowledge of our holy law is spreading &#8212; 
in every country some rays of light are penetrating&#59; and to 
what other cause can this change be attributed&#44; but to the influ&#8211; 
ence of the law&#44; which was given through Moses&#44; and which 
has become more known&#44; more admired&#44; and more followed by 
the nations of the earth&#44; since we were captives&#63; Our enemies 
hated us&#44; but they were enlightened by us&#44; and our wounds

opened to them the fountain of light and happiness. &#8212; Am I 
asserting more than the experience of every one teaches him &#33; 
Who can be so blinded as not to acknowledge this self&#8211;evident 
truth&#63; Away#44; then&#44; with that faint&#8211;hearted ness&#44; which is a 
greater enemy to our belief&#44; than either the destruction of Jeru&#8211; 
salem or the persecution of the dark ages&#44; for whilst our hope 
is undiminished&#44; whilst our faith in God&#39;s salvation remains 
unbroken : no power on earth is able to injure in the least the 
existence of our religion. But let once the insidious misgivings 
of fear&#59; which others are so anxious to instil in us&#44; be listened 
to with complacency&#44; and it is as certain&#44; as any thing which 
has not yet come to pass&#44; that our nation is then nigh its disso&#8211; 
lution. But is there a Jew who would not exert all his energy&#44; 
no matter how little soever his acts may be in accordance with 
the law&#44; to prevent the extinction of our heroic&#44; suffering peo&#8211; 
ple &#63; Who would not deplore the injury which the world at 
large would suffer&#44; if the inheritors of the revelation of the 
Most High should have ceased to be an evidence of his wisdom 
and an example to all mankind &#63; &#8212; Let us therefore all be united 
in our regret&#44; and let us never forget that we&#44; as descendants 
of Israel&#44; have a temple to weep for&#44; and a conquered and 
oppressed people to bemoan &#59; but whilst thus mourning&#44; let us 
not waver in our hopes nor despair of God&#39;s goodness&#44; even if 
our career on earth be closed before the promised salvation 
approaches. We have seen that punishment always followed 
sin&#44; and that Israel was nevertheless at no time left entirely at 
the mercy of the foeman. Can any one then doubt&#44; that the 
other prophecies will be fulfilled as well as those which have 
already been accomplished &#63; And truly&#44; brethren&#44; we may say&#44; 
that if ever hope was well founded&#44; if ever confidence ought to 
visit the human breast&#44; it is the hope which we feel&#44; it is the 
confidence which animates us &#59; for we are promised by the 
prophet : &#44; 

&#34; And the ransomed of the Lord shall return&#44; and come to Zion with loud 
songs of praise&#44; and everlasting joy shall crown their heads &#59; gladness and 
joy they shall ohtain&#44; and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.&#34;

Brethren &#33; 

&#34; Ended is the past year and its curses &#59;&#34; and we have begun 
a new year&#44; and entered upon a new period in our existence. 
Many a one&#44; who in the by&#8211;gone year was linked to a dear 
friend&#44; has seen this bond severed by the rude&#44; unsparing hand 
of death. &#8212; Many&#44; who in former days enjoyed the repose of 
luxury and affluence&#44; now moisten their hard&#8211;earned bread with 
the burning tear of toilsome labour. &#8212; Many who before were 
courted by friends&#44; adored almost by admiring crowds&#44; nay&#44; 
envied by their distanced enemies&#44; are now solitary and for&#8211;

saken&#44; and none so poor&#44; none so miserable&#44; as to render them 
homage. Again&#44; many who before rioted in the enjoyment of 
good health&#44; are now fast approaching the termination of their 
life&#44; and the grave&#44; as it were&#44; is yawning at their feet&#44; eager to 
enfold within its cold embrace the unwilling trembler standing 
on its verge. These are but a small portion of the changes&#44; 
which the past twelve months have witnessed&#44; and thus another 
revolution of the seasons has taught an awful lesson to the 
children of the dust&#44; and has admonished them&#44; to beware of 
clinging too closely to earthly things&#44; since they must so soon 
be wrested from the powerless grasp of the weak and fading 
mortal. 

&#34; Begun has the year.&#34; Again&#44; brethren&#44; the grace of God 
is dawning upon us&#44; who have by his mercy survived&#44; who have 
again been permitted to dwell for a while longer on earth&#44; who 
are yet left to be enabled to acquire a treasure in heaven by 
employing the existence granted to us in deeds of active bene&#8211; 
volence and energetic piety. &#8212; I said&#44; that the grace of God is 
dawning upon us &#59; for indeed&#44; brethren&#44; we are surrounded by 
light effulgent&#44; by the wisdom of an All&#8211;wise Creator&#44; by muni&#8211; 
ficence unbounded&#44; and by care unflagging&#44; and unwearied by 
continued exertion. And enough of grace has been granted us 
by God&#44; to render sickness supportable&#44; galling poverty not 
toilsome&#44; slavery and oppression tolerable&#44; nay death even an 
easy and an onward path to everlasting happiness. &#8212; Some may 
therefore be led to inquire&#44; &#34; Whence all the misery which afflicts 
the world &#63; whence all the calamities&#44; the horrors&#44; and the 
violence&#44; which desolate mankind&#44; if God is as good&#44; as we are 
told He is &#63;&#34; But reflection will soon answer us&#44; that we our&#8211; 
selves are the cause of the manifold evil which exists &#59; for we 
are heedless of the divine light which is beaming upon us &#59; we 
refuse lo listen to the voice that fain would instruct us in the 
way of life &#59; and regardless of the bounty and munificence of 
God&#44; and unwilling to trust to his providential care&#44; we seek 
a way of our own&#44; inconsistent with the happiness of ourselves&#44; 
the welfare of others&#44; and displeasing and abhorrent to our 
Maker. And thus we draw punishment &#8212; the evil &#8212; dow&#8211;n upon 
ourselves and others&#44; as a just recompense for our misdeeds &#59; 
and crime and chastisement must follow each other&#44; since the 

    <pb n="195"/>

THE NEW YEAR. 195 

same cause will always produce a similar effect. And from the 
beginning of the presence of man on earth up to the present 
day&#44; this has been the uniform course of events&#44; and chastise&#8211; 
ment has ever followed in the footsteps of transgression &#59; and 
the Almighty has thus proved to an erring world&#44; that only in 
his favour there is happiness. &#8212; In the heginning peace reigned 
on earth&#44; when the work of creation was finished&#44; and in har&#8211; 
mony all creatures lived with each other&#44; enjoying their ex&#8211; 
istence&#44; as they proceeded perfect from the hand of their Maker. 
The lion rested in the forest along with the deer&#44; and between 
the tiger and the calf was peace&#44; and the lamb went unharmed 
by the wolf. But when Adam&#44; the father of our race&#44; ate of 
the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge&#44; all was changed &#8212; 
and discord followed the path of sin&#44; and it vvas not long before 
death lurked behind every shrub &#8212; before the winds were 
loaded with pestilence &#8212; before the clouds of heaven scattered 
destruction&#44; and the floods of the sea carried desolation in the 
force of their raging billows &#59; beast souglit the life of beast&#44; and 
man gloated over the slaughtered carcass of his brother. The 
same has also been ever since &#59; through sin alone discord springs 
up &#59; and wliere the word of God is disregarded miseries are ac&#8211; 
cumulating&#44;and ever andanon the terrible wrath of the Righteous 
Avenger is manifested in the judgment which He executes on 
sinners. But to punish is not the wish of the Merciful Ruler&#44; 
not to destroy is his pleasure &#59; He will instruct. He will im&#8211; 
prove&#44; He will show his children the way of life&#44; and by the 
precepts of his wisdom He endeavours to lead them all into the 
sanctuary of unending happiness. Now this is the light of 
which we have spoken&#44; the grace&#44; the munificence&#44; and the 
care which we enjoy in our fallen state&#59; it is&#44; brethren&#44; the 
light of the law&#44; the grace and munificence of the divine legis&#8211; 
lation&#44; and the care of wise commandments&#44; which&#44; if carefully 
followed&#44; will make us all happy&#44; all worthy children of the 
God of mercy. &#8212; In the law&#44; which has thus been given&#44; there 
are many commandments of a general nature&#44; for instance&#44; 
those regarding the intercourse between man and man &#59; others&#44; 
however&#44; have an especial reference with regard to the relation 
of the creature to his Maker&#44; and were instituted to impress 
upon his mind that he has duties to observe to the Author of 

    <pb n="196"/>

196 THE NEW YEAR. 

his being as well as to his species&#44; and that he is accountable to 
Him for every act&#44; word&#44; and thought. In this class of duties 
we may reckon the laws relating to the festivals&#44; and the ob&#8211; 
servances which are to be practised on the same&#44; since all 
of them&#44; as may be seen by an inspection of the holy law 
itself&#44; were to serve as mementos of certain miraculous actions 
of the Deity&#44; and to keep alive within us our entire dependence 
on his bounty and grace. &#8212; With regard to the festival which 
we are celebrating this day&#44; we read in Numbers xxix. 1 : 

&#34; And on the first day of the seventh month shall be unto you a holy con&#8211; 
vocation&#44; no kind of work shall ye do&#59; a day of blowing of the cornet it shall 
be to you.&#34; 

You will see from this precept&#44; that we are ordered to sound 
the cornet&#44; or&#44; as we call it&#44; the shophar&#44; on this day&#44; the first 
of the civil year&#44; and according to our received opinions&#44; the 
anniversary of the creation. It now may&#44; perhaps&#44; strike you 
as something singular&#44; that the beginning of the year should be 
celebrated by the sound of the cornet&#44; an instrument used fre&#8211; 
quently in ancient times to call the troops to war&#44; to sound an 
alarm&#44; or at other occasions of solemnity and danger&#59; and you 
very likely will ask yourselves&#44; what can be the meaning of 
this ceremony on this particular day&#63; &#8212; To illustrate this com&#8211; 
mandment let us revert to the organization of our people&#44; and 
to the country whence our ancestors went forth. &#8212; We are&#44; as 
it is well known&#44; descended from Abraham the Hebrew&#44; and 
the country of our first organization is Asia&#59; it was therefore 
so ordained by our Divine Legislator&#44; our God and Father&#44; to 
introduce such symbols and emblems into the frame&#8211;work of 
the law&#44; as were familiar to those who first received it &#59; and 
we have therefore in the imagery of our holy Writings&#44; and 
in some of our ceremonies&#44; very frequent allusions and refer&#8211; 
ence both to our descent and our first habitation. &#8212; The history 
of Abraham&#44; although so familiar&#44; presents&#44; nevertheless&#44; many 

    <pb n="197"/>

THE NEW YEAR. 197 

very striking points for reflection&#44; from which particularly we&#44; 
his descendants&#44; can draw useful and wise lessons &#59; and as the 
sacrifice of Isaac has an especial reference to the subject under 
consideration&#44; permit me to draw your attention to it&#44; as best 
fitted for to&#8211;day&#39;s reflection. &#8212; Abraham had seen the glory of 
his name spread among the children of the East &#59; his riches had 
increased to an immense extent&#44; and his wife Sarah had been 
blessed with the birth of the long&#8211;expected child &#59; and it may 
be said&#44; that in this way th&#42;e whole chain of promises made to 
the patriarch were in a train of fulfilment. For&#44; prosperity had 
been promised&#44; and he was prosperous&#59; greatness of name was 
his&#44; as God had foretold &#59; the child which Sarah was to bear 
had also been given &#59; and Abraham was thus established as the 
favourite of Heaven. The fair fame which he enjoyed had also 
confessedly not been lightly earned &#59; for his love of the Cre&#8211; 
ator had been repeatedly tested&#44; and amidst all these trials he 
had not wavered&#44; nay&#44; his confidence had increased with every 
probation&#44; and the dispensations of Heaven&#44; and the persecution 
of men&#44; had never caused him to relax in his well&#8211;founded 
faith. But to crown all the sacrifices to principle and love 
to God hitherto made&#44; the last and severest was now demanded 
of him&#44; to prove that the man destined to be the father of a mul&#8211; 
titude of nations&#44; and of a people to be the depositary of God&#39;s 
holy covenant&#44; could ofier up every thing to the Lord of heaven&#44; 
even the dearest hope of his heart&#44; and to comply with a man&#8211; 
date which&#44; to appearance&#44; threatened the extinction of the 
most cheering promise ever made to him&#44; that &#34; in Isaac his 
seed should be called.&#34; For the command had gone forth&#44; that 
he should take Isaac&#44; the only son&#44; the beloved&#44; the offspring 
of Sarah&#44; and sacrifice him on one of the mountains of the 
land of JNIoriah. Had Isaac now &#8211;been actually sacrificed&#44; the 
promise just mentioned would have been broken &#59; and yet&#44; 
did Abraham object to this seemingly capricious order &#63; No&#44; 
on the contrary&#44; he obeyed cheerfully &#59; and armed with 
his usual confidence in the unwavering truth of God&#44; he 
thought&#44; that it was unbecoming in him who had received so 
many bounties at the hand of his Master to inquire after his 
unsearchable ways&#44; and he set forth on his perilous journey 
with the intended victim&#44; resolved to fulfil the will of Heaven.

198 THE NEW YEAR. 

The sacred spot is reached&#44; and behold them&#44; the father ready 
to sacrifice his last hope&#44; and the son willing to become a burnt&#8211; 
offering on the altar of his Creator &#33; See on yonder eminence 
the altar is built&#59; the gray&#8211;headed patriarch arranges the wood&#59; 
he binds the yielding one&#59; and now behold the bright knife 
flashing over the head of the victim&#44; and the sacrifice is almost 
fulfilled : &#8212; when lo &#33; the outstretched hand is arrested by the 
messenger of Mercy&#44; for not the sacrifice it was that God 
desired&#44; but the readiness only to obey&#44; and here indeed had 
been exhibited an example of ready obedience&#44; which the min&#8211; 
istring angels could not have surpassed &#59; and the intended sac&#8211; 
rifice was stayed&#44; and the blessing of God was poured out over 
both&#44; and over their descendants after them. In the history of 
this occurrence&#44; we read&#44; that a ram was sacrificed in the place 
of Isaac &#59; this then will give us an explanation of the verse of 
Leviticus xxiii. 25 : &#34; On the first day of the seventh month 
shall be to you a day of rest&#44; of blowing of the cornet in 
remembrance &#59;&#34; in remembrance namely&#44; of the sacrifice on 
Moriah of a ram instead of the devoted servant of God. And 
it is meet that at every new period in our existence especially 
the recollection of this memorable event should awaken in our 
hearts the noblest sentiments of devotion. We should reflect&#44; 
that if Abraham was ready to devote his all&#44; the only son of 
his long&#8211;loved Sarah&#44; born to him at the age of a hundred years&#44; 
simply because he thought his God desired it : we also should 
resolve to follow his example as far as lies within our power&#44; 
and to make daily those small sacrifices to principle&#44; which are 
demanded of us in the service of Heaven. Abraham&#44; as we 
have seen&#44; was ready to yield the dearest possession&#44; that which 
without a miracle could never have been restored &#59; how much 
more ought we to hasten to submit to anv inconvenience in 
the discharge of our duties&#44; and to abstain from pleasures and 
pursuits&#44; if they should militate in the least against our reli&#8211; 
gious obligations. &#8212; Again&#44; we have the exhilarating certainty&#44; 
exemplified in the history of our people&#44; that God blesses the 
child for the virtue of the parent &#59; what father&#44; then&#44; and what 
mother&#44; would not endeavour&#44; if they really love their offspring&#44; 
to secure them a legacy&#44; which all the ills of the world cannot 
dissipate &#59; a treasure&#44; which can never perish &#63; Let us&#44; there&#8211;

fore&#44; every year recal to mind&#44; the noble devotedness of the 
patriarchs&#44; and resolve to follow them in their virtue and im&#8211; 
plicit confidence in God &#59; and let us imagine that the spirits of 
the departed great ones whisper encouragingly in our ears&#44; when 
the loud voice of the shophar resounds in all our dwellings &#33; 

Says the prophet &#40;Amos iii. 6.) : &#34; Should the cornet be 
blown in a city and the people not tremble&#63;&#34; &#8212; Brethren &#33; the 
shophar is not alone to remind you of what your ancestors did 
and suffered &#59; but it speaks also to you as the warning voice of 
God&#44; and as it were&#44; reminds you that there is danger at hand&#44; 
that destruction is hovering near&#44; and it bids you to beware&#44; 
whilst there is yet time to flee into the safe enclosure&#44; before yet 
the enemy&#39;s power entirely overwhelms you. &#8212; Our life may be 
aptly compared to a road on which a stranger ventures in a 
foreign land. Onward he presses&#44; eager to reach his journey&#39;s 
end&#44; and heedless&#44; because unconscious&#44; of dangers which still 
may beset him on all sides. Imagine him now on the brink of 
a precipice in a stormy and tempestuous night&#44; when no light is 
shed to guide his wavering feet. Already one foot is raised 
above the pit&#44; and the next step&#44; the next instant&#44; would hurry 
him into eternity &#8212; when lo &#33; the sound of a signal&#8211;horn reaches 
his ear &#33; He is startled&#44; he halts&#44; and a bright flash of lightning 
reveals to him the giddy height from which he had nearly 
fallen&#44; and he blesses the sound which warned him of the unseen 
danger&#44; that has almost deprived him of life. &#8212; Again&#44; behold 
this traveller toiling up the mountain&#8211;side&#44; vvhen bleak winter 
holds dominion over the frozen earth &#59; no path is visible in the 
trackless snow&#44; and he is yet far distant from the solitary hut 
on the cloudcapt summit&#44; the hospitable shelter of which he is 
seeking. Bewildered and despairing he sinks down exhausted 
and fatigued&#44; and he resigns himself to death&#44; lamenting his 
hopeless lot&#44; and turning his thoughts to his beloved and dis&#8211; 
tant home. But hark &#33; the Alpine horn animates his drooping 
spirits&#44; and the consciousness&#44; that aid is near&#44; inspires him 
with new strength &#8212; he toils again &#8212; and his exertions&#44; renewed 
by hope&#44; extricate him from the folds of earth&#39;s wintry wind&#8211; 
ing&#8211;sheet&#44; and at the friendly hearth of the mountain&#8211;hermit&#44; he 
blesses the horn that bid him hope. &#8212; Returned to his paternal 
roof&#44; the cause of his country calls him to the embattled plain &#59; 

    <pb n="200"/>

but amidst the shock of contending hosts&#44; the weary&#44; wounded&#44; 
warrior is struck down on the field of death : around him are 
the slain of the friend and of the foe&#44; and he faints&#44; unconscious&#44; 
from the loss of blood &#59; night closes around him&#44; and the cool&#8211; 
ing winds call him again into life and consciousness &#59; yet he 
dares not to move for fear of falling a prisoner in the hands of 
the enemy &#59; but suddenly the bugle&#8211;horn of his fellow&#8211;warriors&#44; 
summoning all the stragglers to their country&#39;s standard&#44; teaches 
him that friends are approaching&#59; he raises a faint shout&#44; exerts 
the last remains of his strength&#44; and is speedily welcomed in 
the secure quarters of his conquering countrymen &#33; 

This&#44; brethren&#44; is the voice of the shophar &#33; &#8212; We enter upon 
life&#44; imagining that we are safe&#44; we fear not&#44; that we shall be 
brought to the brink of impiety by the even path which the 
ways of the world open to us. But wo to our heedlessness &#33; 
step by step we are brought nearer and nearer to irretrievable 
ruin&#44; and we are preparing to throw ourselves into the embrace 
of vice : when&#44; our course is arrested by the warning voice of 
God&#44; by a slight demonstration of his disapproval&#44; and being 
thus made acquainted with our folly&#44; we commence the study 
of his law&#44; and gradually we are again brought to return to the 
precepts we have so long forsaken &#59; and when we are once 
more restored to the love of God&#44; we bless the chastening rod 
which taught us to feel the error and unworthiness of our 
worldly conduct. 

Amid the cares of life and itg afflictions we become bewil&#8211; 
dered&#44; and our spirit sinks within us&#44; because of all the misfor&#8211; 
tunes that befal us. We are alone and solitary&#44; there is no 
friend to relieve our wants&#44; no one to speak comfort to our 
desponding souls&#44; and we are almost ready to curse the day 
that first opened to us an existence so full of afflicting sorrows 
and agonizing trials. But of a sudden the word of consolation 
is breathed into our ears&#44; we are extricated from our troubles &#59; 
and led on by the cheering sound of comfort&#44; so richly scat&#8211; 
tered through the pages of the heavenly law&#44; we forget our past 
miseries and the trials which are now ended &#59; and renewing 
our almost suspended exertions in the field of virtue&#44; we toil on 
through the period of our allotment on earth&#44; till at length we 
are received in the mansion of our Father&#44; where we shall be 

    <pb n="201"/>

THE NEW YEAR. 201 

guarded as no miser guards his gold&#44; where we shall be watched 
as no mother watches her tender nurseling. 

Hurried away by temptations which we are not able&#44; because 
not willing&#44; to withstand&#44; we sink almost&#44; as though we were 
wearied with the struggle&#44; into the arms of vice. We yield 
our energies to the destroyer &#59; we fancy&#44; that we have laboured 
enough&#44; we imagine that we have done all which can be 
expected from men &#59; and we are content to lie down amidst 
those already destroyed by passion&#44; and those&#44; who are ready 
to follow on the same path of ruin. Already the night of 
mental darkness is closing around us&#44; already sin is rejoicing 
to enrol us among her votaries : when the aroused knowledge 
of our unworthiness awakens the lethargic sluggards&#44; and we 
gather the remaining small portion of virtue around us &#8212; we 
struggle violently &#8212; we disregard the wounds which sin has 
struck &#8212; and we drag ourselves&#44; slowly &#8212; slowly &#8212; but ever 
onward&#44; till we are again received amidst the friends of God&#44; 
and reassured by the example of our brethren&#44; we are rendered 
equally sincere&#44; though but late&#44; members of the noble frater&#8211; 
nity&#44; whose aim is the service of God and the well&#8211;being of 
their fellow&#8211;men. &#8212; If then&#44; brethren&#44; you hear the sound of the 
cornet&#44; let it appear to you as the warning voice which speaks 
to you symbolically from Heaven&#44; to rouse you from moral 
lethargy&#44; to reanimate you when you are sinking under afflic&#8211; 
tion&#44; and to warn you when you are carelessly exposing your&#8211; 
selves to the temptations of life &#33; 

Says the Psalmist: &#34;God ascends midst the shouting&#44; the 
Lord amidst the voice of the cornet. Sing ye to God&#44; sing ye&#44; 
sing to our King&#44; sing ye. For God is King over all the earth&#44; 
commence the song of instruction.&#34; &#40;Psalm xlvii.) To&#8211;day 
is the anniversary of creation &#59; this is the day&#44; on which we 
annually celebrate the generation of the universe. It is the day 
on which Adam first came into being&#44; and when&#44; rejoiced at 
his existence&#44; he first acknowledged his Maker. Sound then 
the cornet&#33; for God is king. Blow the trumpet&#33; for the Eter&#8211; 
nal ruleth. Commence the shout of thanksgiving&#33; for the 
Merciful One reigneth&#33; Yes&#44; let us at the return of every 
year&#44; again and again acknowledge the supreme rule of our 
Father&#44; in the manner He commanded&#44; and let the first day in

202 THE NEW YEAR. 

every new period be celebrated as a festival in honour of the 
Lord&#39;s enthronement&#33; &#8212; When then the shophar is blown in 
all our dwellings&#44; let us recollect the sacrifice which Abraham 
was willing to make in obedience to the voice of his Creator&#33; 
Let this recollection attune our hearts to God&#39;s service &#59; and 
let this feeling&#44; teaching us to tear our thoughts away from the 
sinful allurements of earthly life&#44; prepare each of us to acknow&#8211; 
ledge and to serve sincerely the Father of his people&#44; as the 
sole King of the world&#44; the Ruler of our destinies&#44; and the only 
Haven of our hope&#33; 

&#34; Begun has the year and its blessings&#33;&#34; May the Supreme 
Disposer of all events grant us a happy year&#44; and ensure us 
freedom of body&#44; disenthralment of mind&#44; personal security&#44; and 
national welfare. May the bondmen be freed&#44; and may to the 
captives of Zion the trumpet of salvation sound&#44; and the great 
shophar recal those who are lost in the land of Assyria&#44; and 
are dispersed in the land of Egypt&#59; and may we all&#44; that hope 
for salvation&#44; be speedily assembled to worship on the holy 
mountain at Jerusalem&#44; in the temple which shall be raised 
above all the hills&#44; as the dwelling of the King of glory &#33; 
Amen&#44; Selah.

THE PASSOVER. 



OUR Father we call upon thee&#33; be gracious to thy 
people&#44; and be merciful to the children of thy servants&#44; and lead 
them by gentle means to the haven of thy blessing&#44; and let 
them see&#44; that in kindness it was&#44; Thou didst punish them&#59; that 
in paternal love Thou didst let them feel the burning of thy 
anger&#44; in order that they might thereby be made more worthy 
of the inheritance Thou didst promise them in this world and 
in the world to come&#33; Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 
It is to&#8211;day the feast of unleavened bread&#44; it is the Passover 
of the Lord&#33; &#8212; But why the festivities of the day&#63; why the 
eating of the unleavened bread&#63; why the holy convocation&#63; &#8212; 
To this we may answer in the language of the law: &#34; Because 
the Lord led us out of the land of Egypt&#42; from the house of 
bondage&#33;&#34; Yes&#44; brethren&#44; it was in those days&#44; when a bar&#8211; 
bai&#39;ous Pharaoh ruled over all the land of Egypt&#44; that the 
Israelites&#44; our ancestors&#44; were held in cruel bondage&#44; compelled 
to work as slaves in the fields&#44; in public buildings&#44; and all kinds 
of heavy labour&#44; and scourged by the lash of merciless task&#8211; 
masters. It had been so pre&#8211;ordained by the will of Him&#44; who 
spoke&#44; and the world came into being&#44; that the descendants of 
Abraham&#44; should be strangers four hundred years&#44; in a land not 
theirs&#44; and be compelled there to submit to labour and injury&#59; 
but that on the other hand the promised blessings and their 
entire freedom were not to be withheld as snon as the appointed 
time had arrived. &#8212; But in the mean while the suffering of Israel 
was grievous in the extreme&#44; for the tyrant&#44; abusing the power 
granted him by the prophecy of God&#44; even slaughtered the 
new&#8211;born children&#44; in order to diminish the numbers of the 
detested people&#44; or perhaps altogether to exterminate them from 

    <pb n="204"/>

the face of the earth. And he thought&#44; that his will could be 
accomplished&#44; that the Protector of Israel would look with 
apathy upon the bodies of innocent babes floating down the 
stream of the Nile&#44; would not watch them as they were swal&#8211; 
lowed up by the remorseless waves &#33; Vain thought&#33; he had 
not yet been taught the futility of man&#39;s warring with the 
Almighty. His arms had been prosperous &#59; wherever he turned 
his eye for conquest&#44; success had followed his path &#59; and should 
he listen to the prayer of the abject slave &#8212; listen to the en&#8211; 
treaty of a powerless and detested subject&#63; No&#44; not Mitz&#8211; 
raim&#39;s king would lower his royal dignity thus &#59; and&#8211; he 
thought himself secure in his palace of splendour&#44; by the side 
of his river&#8211;god&#44; in the midst of his numerous guards&#44; and 
amongst the masses of his false priests and soothsayers. &#8212; But 
lo&#33; the time of the end had arrived&#59; and even in this very 
palace&#44; even surrounded by these priests and wise soothsayers&#44; 
was educated the man&#44; was nurtured the prophet&#44; who was 
destined to free the oppressed&#44; under the guidance of Heaven&#44; 
and who&#44; armed with the instruments of vengeance of the God 
of righteousness&#44; was to humble the oppressor&#44; and to make 
him feel&#44; that the Great King of Israel &#34; rules in the midst of 
the earth.&#34; As said already&#44; Pharaoh had ordered his people 
to throw every new&#8211;born male child of the Hebrews into the 
river&#59; but although his satellites carefully obeyed the ruthless 
decree&#44; the wife of Amram nevertheless succeeded in hiding 
her infant for a space of three months from the searching eye 
of the king&#39;s executioners. Three months she had thus spent 
in unceasing care and watching&#44; when she discovered to her 
sorrow&#44; that her home was no longer a place of safety for her 
innocent and tender offspring. Picture to yourselves the 
mother&#39;s grief&#44; when she was made conscious of the great&#44; the 
apparently inevitable danger&#59; whither should she fly&#63; to whom 
should she look for protection&#63; Her own people&#44; nay&#44; the 
chosen husband of her love&#44; were unable to assist her&#44; for all 
were alike suffering in bondage. And should she go to the 
king to crave his indulgence and pity&#63; but he spurned the 
helpless petitioners&#44; and refused to listen to their entreaty&#59; nay&#44; 
he increased the burden of their labours&#44; when they prayed 
for an alleviation of their task. &#8212; But the virtuous are never

forsaken&#44; and the righteous are never left without a protector &#59; 
and the mother of Moses fully verified this consoling truth by 
her example. &#8212; Rather than beg in vain of hearts which felt 
not for the distresses of others&#44; she resolved to consign the 
precious charge to the hands of the Being who had confided 
him to her. She accordingly made a box of bull&#8211;rushes&#44; and 
having made it water&#8211;tight&#44; she put her child therein&#44; and 
placed it among the rushes on the shore of the Nile&#59; convinced&#44; 
that He&#44; who feedeth &#34; the children of the rav.en when they 
cry&#44;&#34; could&#44; if it pleased his wisdom&#44; protect and rescue the 
helpless infant from his perilous situation. And soon it was 
proved that she had hoped well &#59; for the king&#39;s daughter com&#8211; 
ing to bathe&#44; espied the box among the reeds&#44; and opening it 
she discovered the child &#59; and penetrated with pit&#8211; for the for&#8211; 
lorn babe&#44; proscribed from his very birth&#44; she resolved to rescue 
him from death. &#8212; In short&#44; she adopted the child&#44; and called him 
Mosheh&#44; in commemoration of her having drawn&#42; him from 
the water &#59; and in the palace of the oppressor of his people 
the future messenger of Heaven passed the years of his in&#8211; 
fancy and early manhood. &#8212; Thus much for the early years of 
the chosen lawgiver &#59; and does it not strike you&#44; that his mi&#8211; 
raculous escape from a watery grave&#44; must have early impressed 
a mind like his with the conviction&#44; that there is a great and 
watchful Being ever regardful of whatever is done on earth &#63; 
that his own case must have taught him&#44; that the little no less 
than the great&#44; the humble and lowly no less than the proud 
and lofty are continually under the direction of an All&#8211;wise 
Supreme&#63; And in truth&#44; we should think&#44; that he was so im&#8211; 
pressed&#44; for we see in his early history&#44; that he opposed himself 
to the cause of oppression&#44; although he had every thing to hope 
from it&#44; and nothing could be gained by favouring the suffering 
Israelites. &#8212; At length the time arrived&#44; when the fugitive Moses 
was to effect single&#8211;handed&#44; but armed with superior power&#44; the 
deliverance of his fellow&#8211;sufferers. He was feeding the flock 
of his wife&#39;s father in the wilderness&#44; when the word of God 
was imparted to him : &#34; Go&#44; and I will send thee to Pharaoh&#44;

and thou shalt bring out my people of Israel out of Egypt 
It was at the end of the period&#44; which had been set as the limit 
of the sufferings of our ancestors&#44; that Moses was commissioned 
to lead them forth to the service of the Lord. He was&#44; there&#8211; 
fore&#44; told to go to the king and tell him&#44; that the Eternal Lord 
of heaven and earth had appeared to him&#44; and had ordered him 
to demand the dismissal of his first&#8211;born son&#44; the children of 
Israel&#44; out of Egypt. &#8212; Moses went&#44; and spoke the words of 
the Lord before a despot&#44; who had made unto himself a god&#44; 
who worshipped the water which he drank&#44; the ox who plough&#8211; 
ed his field&#44; and the crocodile whose jaws destroyed many of 
his people. To him Moses spoke as God had told him &#59; but 
Pharaoh too confiding in his power&#44; too much corrupted by the 
flattery of his courtiers&#44; and too much emboldened by the sub&#8211; 
niissiveness of his abject subjects&#44; said contemptuously: &#34;Who 
is the Eternal&#44; whose voice I shall obey to let Israel go &#63; I 
know not the Eternal&#44; and Israel too I will not dismiss.&#34; &#8212; But 
soon even he was convinced&#44; that it is useless to avoid the 
power of the Supreme. Signs and wonders were performed 
in his presence&#59; a staff thrown from the hands of Aaron be&#8211; 
came a serpent &#59; the water of the holy river of the Egyptians 
was changed into blood &#59; the clear stream produced frogs innu&#8211; 
merable&#59; anon the dust was changed into noxious insects&#59; then 
wild beasts in im&#8211;mense masses devoured every thing before 
them &#59; a pestilence smote all the cattle exposed in the fields &#59; 
the bodies of all&#44; of the priests even&#44; were covered with blanes 
and ulcers &#59; hail cut down every thing exposed abroad &#59; again 
locusts devoured the green grass and the young grain&#44; even the 
leaves of the trees&#44; and whatever else the hail had spared&#59; and&#44; 
lastly&#44; an impenetrable gloom&#44; a total darkness&#44; had shrowded 
the fair land of the sun for three days&#59; and yet Pharaoh relent&#8211; 
ed not. Once&#44; indeed&#44; he acknowledged : &#34; The Lord is right&#8211; 
eous&#44; and I and my people are sinners &#59;&#34; but no sooner had the 
plague vanished&#44; than Pharaoh was like himself again &#59; he 
forgot the chastisement&#44; hardened his heart&#44; the flattery of 
his courtiers again induced him to look upon himself as the 
favoured son of his gods&#44; jlnd in consequence&#44; he repeated his 
obduracy and sinned again. Here&#44; let me observe to you&#44; 
brethi&#39;en&#44; that Pharaoh is not the only obdurate sinner&#44; who 

    <pb n="207"/>

THE PASSOVER. 207 

disregards the awful admonitions of Heaven. Even we&#44; our&#8211; 
selves&#44; are very often no better than the tyrant&#44; whose deeds 
we all denounce as cruel and oppressive&#44; and whom we all 
adjudge to have been riglitly punislied. Look&#44; I pray you&#44; at 
some passages of your life&#44; none of us is perfect&#44; for we all 
have sinned&#44; we all have transgressed against the laws of God&#44; 
and reflect&#44; how it occasionally haj)pcned&#44; that some unexpect&#8211; 
ed check was given to your course &#59; how you at first were 
somewhat startled at the singularity of God&#39;s judgment against 
you &#59; but how you afterwards suffered the impression to wear 
off&#34;&#44; which the solemn and well&#8211;intended warning had at first 
produced. It is even so&#59; our pride from time to time whispers 
into our ear. &#34; Be not afraid&#44; thy conduct was justifiable&#44; it was 
the same which any other man in thy situation would have pur&#8211; 
sued&#59;&#34; and in surety&#44; we are led astray&#44; or rather we suffer our&#8211; 
selves very willingly to be blindfolded&#44; and consequently having 
explained every circumstance of the strange occurrence to our 
satisfaction&#44; we sin anew&#44; and heap wilful transgression upon 
former trespasses. &#8212; The same was the case with the king 
of Egypt. He had all along conceived that his conduct to&#8211; 
wards the Israelites was just and right&#44; for&#44; thought he : &#34; Shall 
my slaves&#44; those I have received as such from my predecessor&#44; 
go free&#44; without ransom &#63; they now build my towns&#44; they now 
labour for me in the field&#44; they now dig my canals&#59; and whence 
shall I obtain compensation for their loss&#63; No&#44; Israel shall 
not go free&#33;&#34; And as each plague had passed away&#44; and as 
soon as the punishment was removed&#44; he attributed it to acci&#8211; 
dent&#44; to some chance&#44; which he to be sure could not account 
for&#44; but which he yet did not believe to be a manifestation of 
the power of the Deity&#44; a Deity too&#44; whom neither he nor his 
ancestors acknowledaied. &#8212; His servants also lent their aid to 
inspire him with resistance. They had been accustomed to 
obey him implicitly&#44; to hear with them was to obey&#59; they&#44; 
therefore&#44; did not&#44; durst not&#44; advise him to yield&#44; and they 
even applauded his acts&#44; as we are told in Scriptures&#44; &#34; and 
Pharaoh hardened his heart&#44; he himself as well as his ser&#8211; 
vants &#59;&#34; and then&#44; it must be considered&#44; that the Egyptians 
themselves were individually benefitted by the labours of the 
Israelites&#44; as well as the state. &#8212; Thus&#44; then&#44; Pharaoh resisted 

    <pb n="208"/>

208 &#8211; THE PASSOVER. 

the ten times repeated warning and miraculous manifestation &#59; 
but now the time had arrived&#44; when longer disobedience was 
rendered impossible&#44; when by the most signal calamity that 
ever befel any land the king of Mitzraim was to be taught&#44; 
that it behoves mortals to bow before the throne of the King of 
kings&#44; the H0I3&#8211; One praised be He. &#8212; Moses&#44; in the last inter&#8211; 
view he had with Pharaoh in his palace&#44; spoke : &#39;&#42; Thus speak&#8211; 
eth the Eternal Lord: at the hour of midnight&#44; 1 will walk 
abroad in the midst of Egypt &#59; when every first&#8211;born in the 
land of Egypt shall die&#44; from the fii&#39;st&#8211;born of Pharaoh&#44; who 
is to sit on his throne&#44; to the first&#8211;born of the slave&#44; who 
sits behind the mill&#44; and every first&#8211;born of cattle.&#34; These 
are the words of the terrible denunciation &#59; Pharaoh might 
have averted the blow&#44; which was to reach him no less than 
the meanest of his people&#44; by a timely compliance with the 
righteous demand &#59; but he would not listen&#44; and so the ven&#8211; 
geance of the Lord took its course. At the dead hour of mid&#8211; 
night it was &#59; it was in the night of the fifteenth of the first 
month &#59; it was whilst the Israelites were celebrating their first 
festival of redemption &#59; it was whilst the Egyptians rested as 
they thought secure in their beds: that the destroyer walked 
forth in the land. It was as though a blighting dew had fallen 
in every house&#44; so instantaneous was the destruction&#59; in every 
palace&#44; in every house&#44; in every hovel&#44; in every prison there 
was death&#44; the young dropped down in the midst perhaps of 
the nightly revel&#44; and the aged lay&#44; as it were&#44; strangled on their 
couches. &#8212; And the king &#8212; he beheld his eldest son expiring at 
his feet&#44; the son who&#44; as he had hoped&#44; would have succeeded 
to his kingdom&#44; even he was cut ofi&#39;&#59; nay&#44; the cattle&#44; which the 
Egyptians worshipped&#44; perished&#44; and the images&#44; which they 
had set up for contemplation&#44; for auguries or worship&#44; were 
hurled from their stands&#44; and they crumbled into dust before the 
might Hand that was outstretched in that night. &#8212; In every 
house there was now wailing and lamentation&#44; every one 
thought his time of death would come next&#59; the whole land 
was filled with mourning&#44; the like of which had never before 
l)een known in Egypt&#44; and the impulse to get rid at all hazards 
of the dangerous slaves&#44; on whose account the land had well 
nigh been ruined&#44; became irresistible &#59; and the obdurate king

himself hastened to seek out Moses&#44; to bid him leave Egypt 
instantly&#44; together with the people of Israel. &#8212; Thus was the 
liberty of our people obtained &#59; and in addition the Eg&#39; ptians 
loaded them with presents&#44; every thing seemed to be left to the 
choice of the Israelites&#44; who then went out&#44; even before their 
doughs&#44; which they had prepared&#44; could become leavened&#44; and 
they baked them into unleavened cakes on the road. &#8212; This is a 
brief view of the long captivity&#44; degrading servitude of our 
ancestors&#44; and of obstinate resistance and ultimate forced conces&#8211; 
sions on the part of the king and the people of Egypt. And 
in commemoration of these events&#44; and to perpetuate the me&#8211; 
mory of the hurry in which we went out&#44; so that the bread 
had to be baked without its being suffered to become leavened&#44; 
we were commanded &#40;Deut. xvi. 1&#8212;3): 

&#34;Observe the month of Abib&#44; that thou makest then the Passover in ho&#8211; 
nour of the Lord thy God&#44; for in the month of Abib&#44; did the Lord thy God 
bring thee out of the land of Eg&#8211;ypt at night.&#34; And again : &#34; Seven days thou 
shalt eat unleavened bread&#44; the bread of poverty&#44; for in haste thou didst go 
out of Egypt&#44; for the sake that thou mayest remember the day of thy going 
out of the land of Egypt&#44; all the days of thy life.&#34; 

This&#44; brethren&#44; then&#44; is the reason of our being here this day&#44; 
and this is the cause of our abstaining from every thing which 
is leavened during the Passover. If the stranger now&#44; and 
our children&#44; who arc as yet unacquainted with the wonderful 
deeds of the Lord&#44; which he wrought for us in olden times&#44; 
ask : &#34; Why is this service&#63;&#34; we may answer&#44; it is to remind 
us of the abundant mercies of which we all participated&#44; for if 
it had not pleased the Almighty &#40;to adopt the language of our 
service) to redeem our ancestors from Egypt&#44; then we and our 
children&#44; and our children&#39;s children would even to this day 
have been slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt. And an event like this 

IS&#42; 

    <pb n="210"/>

210 THE PASSOVER. 

is surely deserving of the most solemn commemoration. Look 
upon the state of the world at the time of the Exodus. Idola&#8211; 
try rested like an incubus upon all mankind &#59; the faculties of 
reasonable beings were blunted b)&#39; gross superstition&#59; and had 
God not raised up to himself a people&#44; and gifted them with 
better statutes and more sublime conceptions of himself&#44; what&#44; 
I ask&#44; must have been the condition of the children of Adam&#63; 
It is futile to assert&#44; that the progressive development of rea&#8211; 
son would have efiected a reformation&#44; when we plainly see&#44; 
that the enlightenment of man had gradually deteriorated&#44; 
until he had become&#44; as said already&#44; the benighted idolater. 
Suppose now&#44; this state had continued to this period of time&#44; 
to this age&#44; which we are so apt to call enlightened: is it to be 
believed&#44; that human reason could have progressed&#44; unless an 
event similar to the miraculous deliverance of the Israelites 
had taken place&#63; And in truth&#44; this event was in itself suf&#8211; 
ficient to regenerate the world. First&#44; it was the dawning of 
freedom for every member of the human family&#44; since it is the 
first on record of the unjust power of tyranny broken &#59; and&#44; 
secondly&#44; it was the commencement of a new era in the dis&#8211; 
enthraldom of the mind&#44; since it was then that the light was 
first kindled&#44; which has burned ever since with untarnished 
lustre&#44; and which must ultimately beam with redoubled splen&#8211; 
dour upon every soul &#59; which must at last bring every existing 
reasoning being within the fold of our God&#39;s pasturage&#44; and 
make all nations only as so many members of the same family&#44; 
united by one common tie of unity of interest and uniformity 
of worship. &#8212; This is the event we celebrate&#44; a two&#8211;fold deli&#8211; 
verance&#44; of mind and body&#44; not alone for ourselves&#44; but also for 
all who like us derive their parentage from the founder of the 
human race. &#8212; Let us then reflect seriously upon the cause of 
this festival&#44; and let us in truth&#44; according to the dictates of 
the law&#44; remember the day of our going out of Egypt all the 
days of our life&#44; since it was not merely the humbling of 
Pharaoh&#44; but also the regeneration of the whole world which 
was effected thereby. &#8212; In return for this great favour we can 
render the Almighty nothing but a virtuous conduct &#59; for to 
Him all the acts of man can be of no further importance&#44; &#40;since 
they cannot affect his beatitude&#44;) than as they promote their 

    <pb n="211"/>

own happiness. He wills our happiness only&#59; our deeds can 
neither hurt nor benefit Him&#44; as He is entirely removed from 
the influence of every created being&#44; He who is the Author 
of all that exists. &#8212; Let&#44; therefore&#44; the recurrence of the Pass&#8211; 
over animate us to a renewal of our attachment to our God&#39;s 
holy precepts &#59; let us all join our hearts&#44; our hands&#44; our simul&#8211; 
taneous efforts&#44; to prove to all&#44; that we Israelites are not un&#8211; 
grateful for all the goodness we have received&#44; and are even yet 
receiving&#44; although no longer united under one paternal govern&#8211; 
ment. Let us forget all trifling differences&#44; let every man for&#8211; 
give the sins committed against him by his neighbour&#59; but let 
the proud oppressor of the poor&#44; and the hard&#8211;hearted avaricious 
man&#44; who both look upon the distresses of their fellow&#8211;beings 
with indifference&#59; let them&#44; I say&#44; reflect&#44; that retribution will 
come&#44; when they will find&#44; that neither power nor wealth will 
shield them against God&#39;s almighty power &#59; for He who punish&#8211; 
ed Pharaoh&#44; and the guilty Egyptians&#44; can even now smite the 
sinner&#44; no matter how deeply he may lie concealed&#44; no matter 
how much he may have fortified himself hy silencing his con&#8211; 
science&#44; no matter how long the trespass is past&#44; and he vainly 
dreams his acts lie buried in oblivion. &#8212; In fine&#44; the admonition 
so often repeated in the Pentateuch : &#34; Remember&#44; that thou 
hast been a slave in Egypt&#44;&#34; should remind us of the debt of 
gratitude we owe to God&#44; and thus reminding us&#44; should induce 
us also to love Him who has been so gracious&#59; so that we 
may be rendered good and pious&#44; and worthy of bliss in this 
life&#44; and of happiness hereafter. 

May the grace of the Lord always surround us. Amen&#33;

DISCOURSE XXI. 

THE PENTECOST. 

To the God of Israel&#44; who so often has displayed his glory 
and goodness upon his children&#44; be praise and glory for ever&#8211; 
lasting. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 
In my late address on the occasion of the Passover I 
adverted briefly to the wonders which the Almighty displayed 
in Egypt&#44; and to the miracles and fearful deeds by which He 
brought about the enlargement of our ancestors from cruel 
bondage. This was indeed an act of grace&#44; for which our ever&#8211; 
lasting thanks should ever be cheerfully rendered to Him who 
proved himself so good to the afflicted &#59; who listened to us when 
nothing attainable through human energy was able to assist us&#44; 
and who broke the bonds which centuries of oppression&#44; aided 
by the ingenious devices which cunning and cruelty had 
invented&#44; had well nigh rendered irresistible. &#8212; But with all 
these wonderful acts the deliverance was yet left incomplete. 
The Israelites&#44; as they came from Egypt&#44; were tainted will all 
the vices and superstitions of their late task&#8211;masters&#44; so at least 
we should judge from the tenor of the Bible&#8211;history&#59; and they 
were therefore unfit to be called the people of God&#44; since 
nothing distinguished them from the nations of the earth&#44; save 
their descent from the patriarchs&#44; the original worshippers of 
the Lord of heaven. As thus they needed a reformation to 
make them fit subjects for God&#39;s empire&#44; it pleased Him&#44; their 
Father and the Father of all the world&#44; to come and instruct 
them himself&#44; for the purpose that they might know what 
was pleasing to Him&#44; and that by acting according to their 
newly acquired knowledge&#44; they might live as becomes the chil&#8211; 
dren of God.&#8212; The Lord himself came to instruct the Israelites &#33; 
How sublime the meekness of the Creator must appear to us &#33; 
The children of his adorers&#44; &#34; his friends&#44;&#34; as his record styles 
them&#44; are in trouble&#44; and He saves them &#33; They are sunk in 

    <pb n="213"/>

THE PENTECOST. 213 

ignorance&#44; undeserving of grace&#44; and He instructs and improves 
them&#44; and becomes&#44; in this manner&#44; their Creator in a two&#8211;fold 
sense of the word &#33; He himself&#44; although raised beyond the 
reach of our most elevated conceptions&#44; greater far than the 
most daring flight of fancy can paint him &#59; &#8212; He&#44; I say&#44; conde&#8211; 
scended to instruct in love the children of the dust&#44; whose life 
is like the fleeting shadow &#59; whose deeds are to Him&#44; as though 
they had not been &#59; and whose existence is derived from Him &#33; 
Aye&#44; even as a father teaches his son&#44; as openly as the mother 
speaketh to her daugther&#44; spoke the Everlasting One &#59; and thus 
showed us how in Him&#44; the Most Perfect&#44; meekness is allied 
with sublimity &#59; how in our God condescension is inseparably 
interwoven with unlimited greatness &#33; Yet if we come to con&#8211; 
sider how truly great He is&#44; how every thing existing is exist&#8211; 
ing in Him&#59; how He is contained in nothing&#44; but all is contained 
in Him : we shall cease to wonder&#44; and not deem the descent 
on Sinai&#44; which we celebrate this day&#44; as an act unworthy of 
the dignity of the Deity. He is the source of all wisdom&#44; and 
the intelligence of the greatest sage is intelligence derived 
from Him : why should we then be astonished&#44; that&#44; to effect a 
great good. He should think it consonant with his dignity to 
descend in all his glory&#44; and teach the children of those&#44; who 
had been appointed by Him as the parents of a great nation and 
the blessing of all mankind&#44; the laws which his wisdom had 
instituted as the everlasting&#44; unwavering&#44; and immaculate land&#8211; 
marks of the path of righteousness. &#8212; If&#44; then&#44; our opponents 
sneeringly ask us&#44; if we can be serious in believing in a direct 
revelation of an especial code of laws&#44; we will answer them : 
the God who created man&#44; gifted him with a body&#44; so far supe&#8211; 
rior to that of any other animal &#59; who caused him to walk erect&#44; 
that he with uplifted eyes might contemplate the expansion of 
yon firmament&#44; glittering by day with the brilliant light of the 
sun&#44; and by night illumined by the silvery moon&#44; and the 
myriads of sparkling stars&#44; the suns of other systems &#59; and who&#44; 
to sum up all&#44; has bestowed on him an intelligent mind&#44; a living 
soul&#44; and a thinking spirit&#44; the like of which nothing earthly 
does possess : can He not&#44; if so He wills&#44; speak audibly to the 
ear&#44; and through it to the mind&#44; those things which He may 
believe to be of general and permanent benefit&#63; His ability 

    <pb n="214"/>

&#42; 



then cannot be denied&#44; and that He has actually done so is 
clearly proved&#44; by the fact&#44; that the ten commandments&#44; pro&#8211; 
mulgated to an astonished world for the first time on this day&#44; 
in the year of the world&#44; according to our computation&#44; 2448&#44; 
are yet in existence&#44; are yet known&#44; read and acknowledged &#59; 
and no code&#44; which ever was devised&#44; without acknowledging 
them as the basis of right&#44; has been upheld either in theory or 
in practice. &#8212; Look to the laws of Babylon&#44; their memory is 
forgotten &#59; inquire for the statutes of Greece and Rome&#44; and 
they are no more obeyed &#59; for all were the work of men&#44; bent 
only upon their own aggrandizement&#59; whereas our laws&#44; 
founded upon the wisdom of God&#44; are as new this day&#44; as dear 
to the heart of the lover of his species&#44; as much the established 
code of our nation&#44; as on that day when our adoring ancestors 
stood at the foot of Sinai &#33; &#8212; Another evidence of the divine 
origin of the Decalogue can be found therein&#44; that they have 
never been improved upon since they were first given &#59; what 
but divine Wisdom could be so perfect&#44; what but not being 
derived from human experience&#44; can render any thing free from 
the taint of human work &#8212; imperfection. &#8212; But let me stop 
here : to pronounce a eulogium upon the wisdom of God 
would ill become a fallible&#44; ignorant mortal &#59; for none but God 
himself can know the extent of good which has been and ever 
must be derived from the laws&#44; which He himself made 
known &#33; &#8212; Therefore&#44; let our silence be praise &#59; let our inability 
to express our admiration be the evidence of the depth of our 
feelings&#44; since we can never say enough&#44; even though the most 
eloquent were for ever to expatiate upon the theme&#44; and 
exhaust the richest stores of language. Yet the heart must 
clothe itself in words&#44; or else all communication of ideas 
between man and man would become impossible &#59; so then&#44; 
whatever we express of feeling and of gratitude should always 
be taken as the tribute of the heart of the thinking to animate 
through example and precept those who surround him to an 
equal or superior share of piety and veneration to God &#59; and to 
induce them&#44; by an exposition of the excellencies of the holy 
Torah&#44; to follow the precepts therein contained. &#8212; Having pre&#8211; 
mised these views&#44; let us proceed to the consideration of the 
following verse from the portion we read to&#8211;day : 

    <pb n="215"/>

THE PENTECOST. 215 

&#34;And now&#44; if you will hearken to my voice and observe my covenant&#44; you 
shall be to me the most beloved of all nations&#59; for all the earth is mine&#59; and 
you shall then be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are 
the words thou shalt speak to the children of Israel.&#34; Exodus xix. 5&#8211;6. 

The Almighty had visited our parents in Egypt&#44; and had seen 
them oppressed by slavery&#44; and sunk in ignorance and idolatry. 
They were the descendants of Abraham&#44; to whom God had 
promised&#44; that as soon as the servitude to which his children 
had been destined&#44; should have continued till the end of the 
limited period&#44; they should be redeemed. In consequence of 
this promise&#44; the oppressors of the Israelites were by degrees 
brought to relent of their cruelty&#44; and at length to dismiss 
them&#44; loaded with riches&#59; and thus&#44; as it were&#44; the Almighty 
had bought them for his servants&#44; since through his powerful 
intervention their deliverance from thraldom had been effected. 
It was then that they went forth into the wilderness of Arabia&#44; 
guided through trackless desolation by the protection of God&#44; 
under guidance of his chosen servant. The Egyptians soon 
repented of their having dismissed the Israelites and pursued 
them to the shores of the Red Sea &#59; and here again the arm of 
God interposed &#59; he cau.sed the children of Jacob to pass 
through the divided waters&#44; and sunk the pursuing host of 
Pharaoh amidst the returning billows. At length the redeemed 
arrived at the foot of Sinai&#44; in the third month of their redemp&#8211; 
tion&#44; and halted there by the command of God. This was the 
spot of their present destination&#44; for it was here the Israelites 
were to worship the Eternal Father&#44; upon their going out of 
Egypt&#44; as Moses had been promised. All&#44; indeed&#44; conspired 
to render the present moment and the present spot the best 
adapted to impress feelings of awe and veneration upon their 
minds. For as to the time&#44; it was immediately upon the many 
miraculous benefits heaped upon them&#44; which to deserve they 
could have done nothing&#59; and to do aught in return for them 

    <pb n="216"/>

216 THE PENTECOST. 

must have appeared to them even&#44; uninstructed as they were&#44; 
impossible and inconceivable&#44; as they must have early enough 
discovered&#44; that the Being&#44; who had wrought so many things 
in their favour&#44; was One&#44; to repay whom with benefits was 
impossible. And as to the spot&#44; it was then&#44; and is now as&#34; 
travellers tell&#44; a beautiful mountain&#44; with various peaks&#44; one 
rising above the other&#44; its sides covered with verdure in the 
midst of a frightful and barren desert &#59; and in a country where 
there is no water to refresh the thirsty traveller stands Mount 
Horeb&#44; blessed with a cooling spring. It appears as though it 
were a temple consecrated to the God of benevolence&#44; reared 
with his own hands&#44; blessed by his spirit&#44; and enriched by his 
bounty&#44; to receive the wearied and despairing wanderer&#44; who 
has almost yielded all hope of being saved from the perils of 
his pathless journey. So then the time of the promulgation 
of the law was the period when the Israelites had been practi&#8211; 
cally taught&#44; that the All&#8211;ruling One is capable to convert the 
greatest calamity into blessings : who could raise the humblest 
to a proud eminence&#59; who could punish the obdurate sinner 
with punishment beyond the regular course of nature&#44; and who 
watches over all&#44; the great and the humble&#44; the rich and the 
poor&#44; with the same paternal solicitude. This moment&#44; we 
should judge&#44; must have found the whole congregation in a 
temper of mind to inspire them with gratitude to their hea&#8211; 
venly Benefactor &#59; and their feelings must have induced them to 
prove their gratitude by their conduct. Behold them&#44; then&#44; 
encamped at the foot of the beautiful Mount Sinai&#44; at that green 
island amidst an ocean of sand &#59; behold Moses&#44; who had hitherto 
been with the people&#44; called by a voice of an unseen speaker to 
come up the mount&#44; and imagine the feelings of all his fol&#8211; 
lowers at seeing him obey the mysterious call. Anon he 
appears to listen in breathless attention to an unseen mouth and 
an unheard voice&#44; and at length he descends again to the camp. 
The Israelites had been told&#44; that on this spot they should serve 
God the Lord &#59; his service had hitherto been entirely unknown 
to them&#44; and they knew not&#44; if the frightful worship of the 
heathen idols&#44; where human sacrifices bled on the altar&#44; where 
the yet trembling heart of the immolated victim is drawn from 
the living bosonij where the innocent nurseling is laid upon the 

    <pb n="217"/>

THE PENTECOST. 217 

heated arms of Moloch&#39;s image&#59; they knew not&#44; I say&#44; if the 
service of the Lord niii&#59;ht not require the same horrors&#44; unused 
as they were to any other worship. &#8212; Hut no&#44; Moses came not 
with a message of ahomi nations&#44; he spoke not the words of a 
wrathful but of a beneficent Hcing&#59; and thus ho spoke in the 
name of llim who had sent him : 

&#34;You have seen wbat I bave &#40;h)nn to lOgypt&#44; and bow I have 
borne you upon eagles&#39; wings&#44; and brougbt you to me &#59; and 
now&#44; if you will hearken to my voice&#44; and observe my cove&#8211; 
nant&#44; you sb:dl be lo me the most beloved of all nations &#59; for 
all the earth is mine &#59; and you shall be to me a kinjrdom of 
priests and a holy nation.&#34; 

In this first announcement was distinctly contained the whole 
subject of the intercourse&#44; if I may use the terms&#44; between God 
and the Israelites. He first stales bow c liad been their 
benefactor&#44; and how great the redemption had been&#44; which He 
had vouchsafed to bestow on them. Next how He bad protected 
them&#44; as the eagle covers with her body her young brood&#44; from 
the sword of the Egyptian pursuers and tlie Amalakite army&#59; 
how He had provided them with bread in a land where there 
is no sowing&#44; and how He had caused llic water to &#40;low from 
the bard rock to quench their thirst. And for what bad all 
this great goodness been bestowed &#63; to aggrandize God&#39;s power&#63; 
No &#59; his power is unlimited&#44; and can therefore not be made 
greater. What then was the object of all tbis &#63; Solely to in&#8211; 
troduce amongst mankind a purer worship than the modes of 
various species of idolatry then prevalent&#44; and to re&#8211;establish 
on a firmer&#44; and never to be shaken&#44; footing&#44; the covenant which 
He had made with Abraham &#33; &#8212; &#34; I have borne you upon eagles&#39; 
wings&#44; and brought you to me&#44;&#34; says God &#59; &#34; I have done all 
this for your own benefit&#44; from no motives of enlarging my 
kingdom&#44; for all the earth is mine &#59; wherever 1 tuin my view 
every thing stands ready to my will&#59; the angels of purity&#44; to 
whom no carnal desire is known&#44; are my servants&#59; the sun in 
his course must obey my mandate &#59; the moon in her orbit is 
ready to stop in her career at my bidding&#59; do I speak&#44; the 
waters of the vasty ocean divide and show their deepest chasm &#59; 
and do I but will&#44; the devouring pestilence strides abroad&#44; and 
slays the children of men &#59; and at my nod all nature will return

to a chaotic state&#44; and life and death&#44; spirit and matter&#44; and fire 
and water&#44; become mixed up in one wide mass of confusion and 
desolation. But all I desire is to bring you to me&#44; meaning: 
It is my will to rear you up as a people to my service. You I 
have selected. Long you sighed in hopeless servitude &#59; where 
were the gods of Egypt&#44; whom you used to regard with vener&#8211; 
ation&#63; And when I at length stood forth to relieve you&#59; 
where was again the power of Egypt&#39;s idols to stay my power 7 
Thus have I endeavoured to impress on your minds my great&#8211; 
ness and my glory&#44; and thus prepared&#44; you arc of all nations 
the one best calculated to receive my law&#44; and to become as it 
were members in a covenant with me.&#34; In this manner were 
the Israelites to repay the many blessings showered upon them&#44; 
they were in this address of God called on to adopt his kingdom&#44; 
they should henceforward obey Him as their chief ruler&#59; He 
would be their Legislator&#44; their King&#44; and Protector&#44; and they 
should only obey the laws which He would prescribe. &#8212; Thus also 
says the message : &#34; You shall be a kingdom of priests&#59;&#34; mean&#8211; 
ing&#44; every person of the congregation by obedience to God&#39;s will 
would render himself as a priest&#44; administering before the sanc&#8211; 
tuary of the Lord. In the outward worship&#44; in the service of 
the temple and Synagogue&#44; not every one can be a minister&#44; for 
not every one can by previous education be qualified&#44; nor if 
the whole body of mankind were so qualified could they all 
simultaneously act as ministers. But in the worship of the 
heart&#44; in adoration of the Supreme&#44; in obedience to the law&#44; in 
charity and benevolence&#44; in purity of soul&#44; and in a devout 
spirit&#44; all can join&#44; simultaneously and pei&#39;petually. Virtue and 
fear of God ar&#59;e not qualities inherent to station&#44; age&#44; or sex &#59; 
but the whole mass of men are here capable of joining&#44; since 
virtue is so extensive in its operations&#44; that there is field enough 
for every one to act in righteousness. Nay more &#59; the more 
virtuous deeds are committed&#44; the further will the sphere of 
operation be extended&#44; since the mass of iniquity is thereby dimi&#8211; 
nished&#44; and that of useful piety extended. Thus can every one 
be as a priest&#44; and the whole Israelitish nation be a kingdom of 
priests&#44; when all endeavour to lead a holy life&#44; that is to say&#44;

virtuously themselves&#44; and induce others to do likewise. &#8212; For 
this being holy they were promised the immediate favour of 
God&#44; in fact&#44; a continuation of the mercies which they had 
received already. &#8212; The terms of the covenant were soon made 
known to them &#59; for on the third day the Lord descended in 
his awful glory&#44; and proclaimed to the Israelites his will. And 
what willed He&#63; were his laws those of inhumanity and fero&#8211; 
city &#63; was his yoke too severe a burden &#63; No &#59; He commanded 
only the observance of a pure worship&#44; where reason and not 
ignorance were to lead the people. In place of a multitude of 
adored beings or ideas. He placed before our parents ihe idea 
of One Maker&#44; Ruler&#44; and Preserver of all things. &#8212; In place of 
unmitigated service. He commanded that one day in the week 
every man&#44; even the slave&#44; should cease from labour&#44; and thus 
to celebrate the creation of all by the One Creator &#33; &#8212; In place 
of barbarities&#44; of murders&#44; theft&#44; and false&#8211;swearing&#44; and dupli&#8211; 
city. He commanded that whatever a man was possessed of 
should be inviolably his&#44; and not to be taken from him&#44; ex&#8211; 
cept by a just&#44; impartial&#44; and as far as possible me judicial 
verdict. In fine&#44; the foundation of the covenant is reason the 
most refined &#59; its object humanity and peace. It was for this 
end that the Israelites had been redeemed from bondage&#44; that 
they&#44; moved by gratitude and separated from intercourse with 
the rest of sunken and degraded mankind&#44; might be induced 
cheerfully to adopt a wise and beneficent code of laws devised 
by the Supreme Wisdom &#33; &#8212; How those laws have acted&#44; how 
many and innumerable benefits we have derived from them&#44; 
how many nations have already been blessed with the light 
and wisdom and civilization derived even from their shadoiv : 
1 will not now advert to&#44; as this subject would lead me too far&#44; 
even if I could hope to place it in a light becoming its import&#8211; 
ance before you. However&#44; every one of you can institute an 
estimate for himself by merely taking a survey of the history 
of our people and that of any of the heathen nations. Weak 
in number&#44; and well nigh exterminated by frequent wars and 
persecutions from enemies&#44; we are yet left a proud monument 
of God&#39;s greatness and wisdom. Powerful in numbers&#44; and 
conquering in war&#44; our oppressors have passed away&#44; and per&#8211; 
haps blackened ruins are nearly all that are left to tell : &#34; Here

is the grave of a powerful&#44; a wise&#44; and a great nation &#33;&#34; &#8212; Let 
then the recurrence of this holy festival animate us to observe 
the terms of the covenant under which alone we can prosper &#33; 
I speak advisedly&#44; under the terms of the covenant alone we can 
jjrosper &#33; Without this Israel is weak&#44; is powerless&#44; &#8212; with it 
every thing&#44; in captivity and under sufferings &#33; Nation has vied 
with nation to deprive us of this invaluable treasure : aye&#44; they 
have tortured&#44; slaughtered&#44; and exposed millions to destruction&#44; to 
compel us to lie down with them&#44; to become as low as they 
were&#44; degraded amongst men&#44; and strangers to the pure religion 
of God. But thanks be to the All&#8211;ruling One&#44; we are yet left&#44; 
thou2&#59;h few in number&#44; to celebrate for more than the three 
thousandth time the anniversary of the gi&#39;eat and glorious an&#8211; 
nunciation of the Decalogue&#44; Who then can be so base&#44; so 
unworthy of the name of man&#44; as not to feel a glow of pride at 
the name of Israel&#44; Israel the beloved people&#44; which became 
the depositary of the heavenly purity of the law &#63; Who is 
mean enough to barter away whatever is noble and elevated for 
gain&#44; or a vain&#44; empty&#44; boastful renown &#63; I hope there be but 
few who can sink so low from the elevated sphere pointed out 
to them by their Father &#44; few who care not to preserve 
their inestimable birthright &#33; &#8212; Oh&#44; brethren &#33; let not the ad&#8211; 
monition of one&#44; though so humble and unworthy as he who 
addresses you now&#44; be lost upon you&#44; and let every succeeding 
year find our number of faithful adherents undiminished&#44; and 
let all the world see in our conduct&#44; that we at least humbly 
strive to deserve in some little degree to be called &#34;a kingdom 
of priests and a holy nation &#33;&#34; 

Glory be to God in heaven &#33; and may his blfessed light con&#8211; 
tinually enlighten our souls&#44; and may we thus all be led to 
happiness in a world where there is no darkness&#44; no contention&#59; 
but where all is reason and peace&#44; and all is glory in the 
temple&#44; where God alone is known&#44; where the Eternal alone is 
worshipped. Amen.

DISCOURSE XXII. 

THE VISITATION OF HEAVEN. 

Lord of the universe&#33; Although unworthy through 
our manifold transgressions&#44; we approach the seat of thy mercy&#44; 
to crave thy favour and to seek thy protection. For already 
has the rod of thy anger been stretched out over the nations of 
the earth&#44; and the dreaded punishment has already&#44; even now&#44; 
reached this land&#44; and filled the cities with mourning and wail&#8211; 
ing for those slain by the workings of thy wrath&#33; &#8212; We now 
bend with terror of heart before the awful effects of thy just 
anger&#44; and supplicate thy forgiveness&#44; most merciful Father&#44; 
for the many transgressions and the often repeated disobedience&#44; 
which caused Thee to unloose against guilty mankind the pes&#8211; 
tilence&#44; and to command destruction to go forth over the face 
of the earth &#33; 

The East and the Wpst have alike felt the effects of thy in&#8211; 
dignation&#44; and we have truly been taught&#44; that from thy face 
there is no fleeing&#44; and that there is no shield for the children 
of men from thy anger but in thy mercy. And in vain has 
been human activity&#59; the physician&#39;s skill has been set at 
naught &#59; for Thou hast bidden death&#44; and who can prevail 
against Thee&#63; Nations too have leagued to keep out the de&#8211; 
stroyer from their boundaries &#59; but Thou makest the wings of 
the wind thy messenger&#44; and the myriads of slain&#44; covering the 
fair fields of their lands&#44; proclaim the triumph of thy power. 
Armies also&#44; in the full hope of conquest&#44; have quailed before 
Thee &#59; and they who were not conquered by men sunk before 
the power of thy outstretched arm &#33; 

Behold us now&#44; our Father&#44; supplicating thy protection &#33; 
Thou who art near when all other aid faileth &#33; spare thy 
people from the devouring pestilence&#44; and guard them from the 
evil that is impending. &#8212; We gratefully acknowledge thy favour 
extended to Israel&#44; in having so mercifully shielded them in

222 THE VISITATION OF HEAVEN. 

the midst of the nations visited by this calamity&#59; be further 
gracious to us&#44; and look with compassion upon the remnant of 
thy flock that has escaped &#33; 

Merciful and gracious Lord&#33; humbly do we acknowledge our 
own unworthiness&#44; because of our sins&#59; but Thou hast said&#44; 
that Thou wouldst ever be nigh unto those who call upon Thee 
with truth &#59; and that Thou wouldst never despise the contrite 
and repentant heart &#59; may it then be thy will to take under the 
protection of thy wing&#44; not alone the children of the covenant&#44; 
but also the inhabitants of this city and this land in which we 
reside&#44; and the nations of all earth who may fly to Thee for 
aid&#44; although they obey not thy laws which Thou hast given 
to our ancestors &#33; and shield us and them from destruction&#44; that 
they also may learn to reverence thy name&#44; and to repent of 
the wrong they have done&#44; and be saved according to thy abun&#8211; 
dant kindness. And oh&#44; say to the angel of destruction : 
&#34; Hold&#33; stay thy hand &#59;&#34; so that we all may yet live and 
amend the evil of our ways before we are called hence to ap&#8211; 
pear before Thee in judgment &#33; 

But not upon our virtue do we rely in asking thy favour&#44; 
but solely upon thy kindness&#44; for we have often been taught&#44; 
that before Thee no flesh can be justified &#33; In Thee alone we 
put our trust&#44; Father of mercy&#44; who art everlasting&#44; almighty&#44; 
most merciful and gracious&#44; withholding long thy anger&#44; and full 
of kindness and truth &#59; who preservest thy kindness unto the 
thousandth generation&#44; and who pardonest wickedness&#44; trans&#8211; 
gression&#44; and sin &#59; but who also visitest iniquity with just and 
paternal retribution &#33; &#8212; let now thy goodness be extended to 
thy children&#44; for the sake of the covenant Thou hast made 
with Abraham&#44; with Isaac&#44; and with Jacob&#44; to whom Thou hast 
sworn&#44; that Thou wouldst be their God&#44; and to their children 
after them&#44; and though they should sin Thou wouldst remem&#8211;&#34; 
ber&#44; even in chastisement&#44; thy mercy which is everlasting. &#8212; 
guard then our steps&#44; that we may not stumble&#44; and protect 
us from the pestilence &#34; that walketh in darkness and the de&#8211; 
struction that stalketh forth in mid&#8211;day&#33;&#34; &#8212; And may this be 
thy will&#44; and may the prayer of our lips&#44; and the thoughts of 
our hearts&#44; be acceptable to Thee&#44; our Rock and Redeemer. 
Amen &#33;

THE VISITATION OF HEAVEN. 223 

Brethren &#33; 

Not to celebrate the annual recurrence of some joyful period 
of deliverance are we assembled this day &#59; but to call&#44; as it were&#44; 
more unanimously than each individual can do by himself&#44; 
upon the God of our destinies for an exemption of the dreadful 
scourge&#44; which has been for fifteen years spreading desolation 
in its way&#44; and has at length burst with fearful violence over 
our city&#44; together with many other towns in this hitherto fa&#8211; 
voured hemisphere. We have foi&#8211; a time been indulged to 
behold from afar the punishment which was sent down upon 
distant lands &#59; already we imagined&#44; that here&#44; at so great a 
distance&#44; we should be safe. But&#44; alas&#33; the storm&#44; which has 
been gathering for so long a period&#44; has burst upon us in all its 
awful gloom&#44; with all the suddenness of the lightning&#59; and they 
who deemed themselves &#34;secure in the joy of health and life&#44; are 
thrown upon the bed of wo&#44; and before human aid can com&#8211; 
mence its battle with death&#44; the spirit has flown&#44; and is snatch&#8211; 
ed from this earth&#44; and its cares&#44; and its enjoyments. 

During the progress of this pestilence a rare&#44; perhaps an 
unexampled&#44; spectacle has presented itself to our view. Na&#8211; 
tions&#44; those near and those far from the native soil of the 
dreaded disease&#44; have endeavoured&#44; by non&#8211;intercourse and 
other precautionary measures&#44; to prevent its introduction into 
their lands&#44; so thatit appeared that if human powercould do aught 
in averting the chastisement it W&#39;Ould have been accomplished. 
But no&#44; how vigilant soever the watchmen were&#44; they had not 
the aid of God with them&#44; and &#34; vain is the watchman&#39;s vigi&#8211; 
lance if the Lord guardeth not the city&#59;&#34; and individuals who 
fled from infected places&#44; thinking to escape by distance the 
death they dreaded at home&#44; met it in the solitude of the moun&#8211; 
tain&#44; the seclusion of the forest&#44; and upon the stormy billows 
of the ocean. And if ever Scripture&#8211; truth was verified&#44; the 
history of the cholera has done it as much as any event of 
which we have heard in profane story. I allude to the splen&#8211; 
did description of God&#39;s omnipresence contained in the one 
hundred and thirty&#8211;ninth Psalm of David&#44; where the holy&#8211; 
singer thus speaketh in the fulness of his heart: &#34;0 Eternal 
One&#44; Thou hast searched me&#44; and Thou knowest me &#59; do I sit. 

    <pb n="224"/>

224 THE VISITATION OF HEAVEN. 

do I rise&#44; it is known to Thee &#59; already afar Tiiou probest my 
thoughts&#44; my walk and my couch Thou hast measured for me&#44; 
and prepared all my ways. Before yet a word was upon my 
tongue. Thou&#44; Lord&#33; didst know all&#33; &#8212; Whither shall I go 
from thy spirit&#63; and whither shall I flee from thy face&#63; if I 
ascend to heaven&#44; Thou art there&#44; and if I should lie down in 
the abyss&#44; I should find Thee there &#33; Should I fly on the wings 
of the morning&#8211;dawn&#44; to dwell at the farthest end of the sea : 
even there thy hand would lead me&#44; and thy right hand would 
seize me. If I should say&#44; darkness shall surround me&#33; then 
night even would become light around me&#59; for darkness darkens 
not for Thee&#44; and night shines like the day&#44; and light and sha&#8211; 
dow are to Thee alike.&#34; &#8212; It is this certainty of the entire in&#8211; 
efficacy of human agency which has caused us this day to meet 
here at the house of God&#44; to ask of Him an especial redemption 
from the devouring pestilence which now afflicts us &#59; us&#44; I say&#44; 
for although we may as yet be free from sickness&#44; we know 
not how soon our turn may come&#59; and are we not afflicted&#44; 
when we are conscious that so many of our fellow&#8211;mortals are 
at this very moment groaning and sinking under affliction&#44; 
which no human vigour can long sustain&#63; Let us&#44; then&#44; under&#8211; 
stand the nature of our appeal to the Deity&#44; and let us see if 
the appeal should not have an especial effect upon ourselves&#44; 
before we can expect to have our prayers answered from Hea&#8211; 
ven. As in all investigations&#44; relating to our private as well as 
our public life&#44; we ought to search the Bible for instruction and 
reference&#44; let us adopt this religious course also in the present 
instance. In the Bible we are told&#44; that whenever affliction 
befals us&#44; as soon as we find that our even path of existence 
becomes ruffled: we should turn our attention for succour to the 
Source of all goodness&#44; and commence a rigid inquiry into 
our own conduct&#44; so that&#44; if we have acted amiss&#44; we may 
begin to correct our errors&#44; before we can with confidence look 
for a change in our misfortunes. And thus&#44; says Solomon&#44; in 
the prayer which he pronounced before all Israel at the time 
of the consecration of the temple which he had built for the 
worship of God : &#34; When thy people Israel be smitten down 
before the enemy&#44; because they have sinned against Thee&#44; and 
shall turn again to Thee&#44; and confess thy name&#44; and pray and 

    <pb n="225"/>

THE VISITATION OF HEAVEN. 225 

make supplication unto Thee in this house : then hear Thou in 
heaven&#44; and forgive the sin of thy people Israel&#44; and bring 
them again unto the land of their fathers. &#8212; When the heaven 
is shut up and there is no rain&#44; because they have sinned against 
Thee &#59; if they pray towards this place&#44; and confess thy name. 
and turn from their sin&#44; when Thou afflictest them: then hear 
Thou in heaven&#44; and forgive the sin of thy servants&#44; and of 
thy people Israel&#44; that Thou teach them the good way wherein 
they should walk&#44; and give rain upon thy land which Thou 
hast given to thy people for an inheritance. &#8212; If there be in the 
land famine&#44; if there be pestilence&#44; blasting&#44; mildew&#44; locusts&#44; 
or if there be caterpillars&#59; if their enemy besiege them in the 
land of their cities&#44; whatsoever plague or sickness there be &#59; 
what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man&#44; or 
by all thy people Israel&#44; who shall know every man the plague 
of his heart&#44; and spread forth his hands towards this house : 
then hear Thou in heaven&#44; thy dwelling place&#44; and forgive&#44; 
and do&#44; and give to every man according to his ways&#44; whose 
heart Thou knowest &#40;for Thou&#44; even Thou only&#44; knowest the 
hearts of all children of men)&#59; that they may fear Thee all the 
days that they live in the land which Thou gavest unto our 
fathers.&#34; &#8212; Here&#44; brethren&#44; we have a proper exposition of the 
nature of prayer&#44; and of the objects for which all punishment 
is sent on earth. &#8212; You will have observed already&#44; that in 
many parts of the Bible temporal punishments are uniformly 
threatened as a necessary consequence of dereliction from reli&#8211; 
gious duties. Now&#44; some may ask: &#39;&#34;Why did Moses not 
say&#44; that if you &#40;the Israelites) will not obey the laws I have 
laid before you you shall be punished after death&#44; and specify 
the various degrees of punishment then to be inflicted &#63;&#34; To 
this we should answer: that both this life and the life everlast&#8211; 
ing&#44; are the creation of the same truly infinite Being. But 
man in his human existence&#44; by which I would understand his 
sojourn on earth&#44; is&#44; as said on a former occasion&#44; a compound 
of the finite and infinite &#59; finite in so far as his body is com&#8211; 
posed of material substances &#59; infinite&#44; or at least what our un&#8211; 
derstanding will distinguish by this appellation&#44; in as far as his 
soul does not partake of the nature of matter. Now let it be 
observed&#44; that in this state of being&#44; all ideas conveyed to our 

    <pb n="226"/>

226 THE VISITATION OF HEAVEN. 

mind are borrowed in their limits from the natural world. 
Thus are our joys always founded upon grounds which afford 
us pleasure&#44; profit&#44; or renown&#44; things in themselves positive&#44; or 
considered so by universal consent. And then&#44; also&#44; our grief 
is derived from causes which yield pain&#44; infamy&#44; poverty&#44; or 
contempt. Perhaps&#44; there may be found by an inquirer some 
more diversified and more minute descriptions of feelings&#59; but 
for our present purpose it is enough to adopt merely the fore&#8211; 
going positions&#44; without entering into a complex definition of 
the operations of our mind. &#8212; The truth of these positions is 
too self&#8211;evident to stand in need of argument&#44; and let us&#44; there&#8211; 
fore&#44; proceed to apply them to the subject of our to&#8211;day&#39;s con&#8211; 
sideration. &#8212; Pains and pleasures of this life are positive&#44; that is 
to say&#44; we can either count&#44; measure&#44; or at least survey their 
advantages or disadvantages &#59; Moses&#44; therefore&#44; speaking to 
men&#44; and not to angels&#44; continually drew the attention of his 
hearers to the state of rewards and punishments which could 
befal the nation at large&#44; as an evidence of the divine favour 
or displeasure. To argue from his silence on spiritual punish&#8211; 
ments and rewards after death&#44; that the life everlasting is no 
part of the Mosaic dispensation: would only betray in him 
who makes the assertion the grossest ignorance of many pass&#8211; 
ages in the Bible&#44; which can only be explained upon the as&#8211; 
sumption&#44; that the immortality of the soul&#44; its reward and 
punishment&#44; and the resurrection of the dead&#44; were matters of 
universal belief among the Israelites of the first temple. Moses&#44; 
however&#44; did not speak&#44; when speaking of rewards and punish&#8211; 
ments&#44; with but few exceptions&#44; of the individual Israelites&#44; but 
of the whole nation together&#59; thus&#44; that their prosperity should 
depend upon obedience&#44; and that disobedience would be sure 
to be followed by calamity. We may freely leave it to any 
one to answer&#44; what kind of punishment&#44; whether temporal 
or permanent&#44; should be inflicted upon a nation&#63; Surely the 
temporal appears to our understanding even to be the best 
manner for telling the world in a language not to be mistaken: 
&#34;Upon this land rests the displeasure of God&#33;&#34; &#8212; If then any 
sudden and unexpected calamity comes over a land&#44; or if the 
whole habitable globe even should suffer simultaneously under 
a severe affliction : it becomes us&#44; as religious men&#44; to ascribe 

    <pb n="227"/>

it&#44; not to chance&#44; not to some fortuitous change in the atmo&#8211; 
sphere&#44; not to some telhiric poison&#44; not to some extraordinary 
assemblage of insects&#44; or all these and the like causes combined&#44; 
acting without the expiess agency of the Supreme&#59; but solely 
to his action&#44; by which He wishes to affix his mark of displea&#8211; 
sure upon mankind. Grant even to the deniers of a Provi&#8211; 
dence all they ask&#44; yield to them their assertion&#44; that the air 
we breathe is pestiferous&#59; that the exhalations of the earth are at 
this moment noxious vapours&#59; that death is hidden in the water 
we drink&#44; and in the food we take to sustain life &#59; grant all this 
and more&#44; for all may be true&#44; since we have no means of dis&#8211; 
proving it: and yet we&#44; in common with every thinking being&#44; 
must insist&#44; that it is a judgment of Heaven&#59; for God alone is 
capable of making the air more pestiferous than it commonly 
is: render the earth itself a propagator&#44; as well as the parent&#44; 
of a subtle infection&#44; and cause our drink and food to be filled 
and secretly embued with poison&#44; destructive of life. The 
more natural causes you produce&#44; the stronger becomes the evi&#8211; 
dence&#44; that all we witness this day comes from Him who is the 
Maker of light&#44; and the Creator of darkness. 

&#34; But why should this wrath be poured out upon earth &#63; 
Does God ever ejcercise judgment&#44; without a cause&#63;&#34; &#8212; No 
thought of this kind&#44; brethren&#44; ought ever to enter your 
mind&#59; no Israelite&#44; how little soever he may usually cogitate 
upon matters of religion&#44; should suffer prejudice so gross to 
warp his mind&#44; as to accuse the Supreme of injustice &#33; &#8212; 
&#39;• But the Lord is righteous in all his ways&#44; and upright in all 
his deeds&#33;&#34; the world have sinned&#44; and for the sake of their 
sins has judgment been executed on them. &#8212; We&#44; indeed&#44; flatter 
ourselves often&#44; that the present a2:e is the most enlightened 
one since the creation &#59; we also assume to ourselves a certain 
share of piety&#44; of pure religion&#44; and of freedom from supersti&#8211; 
tion&#44; unknown to our ancestors&#59; and thus fancying&#44; we imagine 
that we live in the peace of God&#44; and need not to disturb our 
minds about the minor points&#44; so we call them&#44; of religious 
observance. &#8212; But we deceive ourselves: we are not more 
enlightened than were many ages in olden times&#59; our viitue is 
at best but very questionable &#59; our piety is often guided by 
interest and ambition&#59; and &#40;I will not include any of my

hearers&#44;) there are many who make religion a profession&#44; an 
axe to chop with&#44; a handle to govern others&#44; and a crown to 
glorify themselves&#44; not before God&#44; for this would be laudable&#44; 
but before men&#44; and this is the very acme of hypocrisy. I do 
not exaggerate &#59; this is not&#44; I acknowledge&#44; a true picture of all&#44; 
but certainly of a vast number of those who outwardly profess 
religion. But what shall I say of the great mass of unbelievers&#44; 
who if even reluctantly compelled to admit the existence of a 
God &#40;I almost shudder when I speak it)&#44; so circumscribe&#44; in 
their vain imaginings&#44; h is power&#44; as merely to constitute Him 
the searcher of hearts&#44; a passive looker&#8211;on on the affairs of this 
world &#63; And what are the consequences of this heresy&#44; and of 
that which asserts &#34;there is no law from Heaven&#63;&#34; but that 
immorality has progressed with frightful rapidity&#44; that disso&#8211; 
luteness and drunkenness show themselves in the face of day&#44; 
and that acts of irreligion are barely thought reprehensible &#33; 
Do these assertions offend us &#63; how much more should we feel 
ashamed&#44; that sheer truth must compel every reflecting mind to 
make an acknowledgment of the distressing fact to himself&#44; if 
even compassion for his fellow&#8211;creatures prevents him from 
speaking aloud his conviction. Do we want proof&#63; our own 
eyes are daily disgusted with the multitude of those&#44; whose 
evident marks of dissipation prove them to be destined to an 
untimely grave. Drunkenness and profanity few of their vota&#8211; 
ries deign even to hide by the flimsy veil of hypocrisy &#59; and 
unfortunately we all here assembled have seen and felt enough 
to convince us&#44; that all religious feelings are often thrown 
aside&#44; even by many grown gray in its service&#44; as a man would 
cast off a worn&#8211;out garment&#44; no longer fit for decent covering &#59; 
and the house of God is deserted&#44; because forsdoth&#44; we must by 
main force compel God to give us riches&#44; and the days of the 
Lord&#39;s appointment are therefore looked upon as no better than 
other days&#44; for the reasoning&#44; that we are not born to starve &#33; 
And is this not true&#63; &#8212; And since no one can gainsay it&#44; why 
then&#44; I ask&#44; shall we express aught of astonishment at the judg&#8211; 
ment which is even now in the course of being inflicted upon 
the earth. It is our sins that have made a division between us 
and our God&#44; and justly do we suffer&#44; for we have been rebel&#8211; 
lious against his words.

Since now we acknowledge In God the Dispenser of the 
punishment&#44; we have to&#8211;day assembled to ask of Him&#44; by&#8211; 
prayer&#44; to stay the evil&#44; and to come to our help &#59; since He who 
has afflicted is alone able to save us &#33; &#8212; But before we dare to 
hope for assistance&#44; we must first look into our conduct&#44; to see 
what requires amendment&#44; what total disuse&#44; and what virtues 
neglected are again to be cultivated&#33; &#8212; God is. merciful &#59; this our 
daily experience teaches us&#44; since He suffers the sun to shine 
upon the wicked as well as the good &#59; sjince He striketh not 
down the sinner at the moment of his transgression&#44; but permits 
him to live and repent. Nevertheless&#44; calamities are the con&#8211; 
comitants of sin &#59; and if even the transgressor imagines&#44; that a 
long course of vice&#44; having so long remained without jusi 
recompense&#44; will for ever remain unpunished : he will to his 
sorrow find&#44; that the Eye above watches unceasingly&#44; and that 
the ears of the Lord are ever open to the cries of the oppressed 
orphan and the complaints of the wronged widow &#59; and punish&#8211; 
ment will come&#44; when&#44; perhaps&#44; least expected. Aye&#44; calami&#8211; 
ties are the rods in the hands of God&#44; and with them He chas&#8211; 
tises the rebellious and careless&#44; that they may return&#44; repent&#44; 
and live &#33; Let this day&#44; then&#44; be the commencement of a sin&#8211; 
cere return to God&#44; and let us be mindful of the words of the 
prophet&#44; who says : 

&#34;O come and let us return unto the Lord&#44; for He has torn and will also 
heal us&#59; He has smitten us&#44; and will also bind up our wounds.&#34; 

Hosea vi. 1. 

Here the Bible teaches us some valuable lessons&#44; which&#44; per&#8211; 
mit me&#44; briefly to enumerate. &#8212; The first is&#44; that whatever befals 
us&#44; be it evil&#44; be it good&#44; is the work of the Lord &#59; chance has 
no agency in the direction of afiairs&#44; and whatever of healing&#44; 
whatever of wounds we find&#44; are therefore to be ascribed to the 
Supreme Source. &#8212; The second consideration is&#44; that nothing 
happens without cause&#44; that is to say&#44; no calamity&#44; either indi&#8211; 
vidual or national&#44; is sent without there is sin for its origin&#44; 
and amendment in its object. &#8212; And a third consequence we are

taught&#44; that by repentance the punishment may be averted 
before it comes&#44; or be suspended after it has ah&#39;eady begun its 
ravages. &#8212; But what is repentance&#63; Is it merely to enter the 
house of God after a long absence&#44; perhaps&#44; and say to Him : 
&#34; our Father&#44; we have sinned &#33;&#34; and repeat thereafter our 
former course &#63; Aye&#44; if even we fast an entire day&#44; nay&#44; perio&#8211; 
dically for forty days&#44; to equal&#44; as far as our feeble strength will 
permit&#44; the time of Moses&#39;s presence on Mount Sinai&#59; is this 
repentance&#44; I ask&#63; &#8212; No&#44; brethren&#44; this is mere lip&#8211;worship&#44; a 
repentance in which the heart has no share&#44; and such conduct 
is denounced by Isaiah&#42; who says: &#34; Forasmuch as this people 
draw near with their mouth&#44; and with their lips do honour 
me&#44; but have removed their heart far from me&#44; and their fear 
towards me is taught by the precepts of men : Therefore&#44; 
behold I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this peo&#8211; 
ple&#44; even a marvellous work and a miracle: for the wisdom of 
their wise men shall perish&#44; and the understanding of their 
prudent men shall be hid.&#34; &#40;Isaiah xxix. 13&#8211;14). &#8212; Repent&#8211; 
ance must not consist in mere outward show&#44; for though men 
might be imposed upon by the specious appearance of the 
seeming repentant&#44; God will not be&#59; and what availeth the 
opinion of the world in matters of virtue&#44; where our Father 
above is the sole judge&#63; &#8212; Nor&#44; although we must condemn 
hypocrisy of the kind just described&#44; can the other species be 
approved of&#44; which would induce a man to speak thus : &#34; I 
acknowledge my error &#8212; I am sorry for it &#8212; I wish it were 
otherwise&#59; but my situation in life compels me to do as others 
do&#59;&#34; or&#44; &#34;vice has grown upon me by long indulgence&#44; as a 
second nature&#44; and my very existence is threatened&#44; if I mend 
now.&#34; How often has repentance been pushed off by such 
pretexts &#33; How numberless are the victims of the most dan&#8211; 
gerous hypocrisy&#33; for a reasoner of this class imagines&#44; there is 
no wrong in his doings &#59; for since he cannot avoid sinning&#44; he 
cannot be blamed&#44; and consequently that he ought not to be 
punished for it. But there is an error of the most fatal kind at 
the bottom of all this. Let us examine&#44; for instance&#44; the drunk&#8211; 
ard&#39;s plea: &#8212; that drinking has become absolutely necessary 
to him&#44; and that abstinence would be followed by death. &#8212; The 
latter assertion may be true &#59; but what then &#63; Was it not wrong 

    <pb n="231"/>

THE VISITATION OF HEAVEN. 231 

in the first instance to commence the sinful course&#63; Now&#44; even 
suppose that his life should be the forfeit of his repentance 

which is&#44; however&#44; very doubtful)&#59; would it not be better for 
him to die in virtue&#44; if he thereby can obtain the forgiveness 
he so much needs&#44; rather than live in degradation and die in 
sin&#63; &#8212; I merely adopt this example as an illustration&#44; and for 
every answer: &#34; I cannot help sinning&#44;&#34; we may find an equally 
strong&#44; and even a much stronger refutation &#33; &#8212; Upon the whole&#44; 
it is as much the duty of the sinner to repent at all hazards&#44; as 
it is the original duty of all men to act uprightly from the 
beginning&#59; and there is no distinction between men&#44; why one 
should be absolutely compelled to be bad&#44; whilst another is 
good. And if we find the circumstances around us calculated to 
draw us into vice and irreligion&#44; we are bound to get rid of 
them &#59; and if we but begin&#44; we shall have soon ample means 
afforded as to carry our reformation into effect&#59; as we are 
taught by our wise men : &#34; Whoever comes to purify himself&#44; 
will be aided from Heaven.&#34; 

Having thus shown the danger of hypocrisy on the one side&#44; 
and self&#8211;deception&#44; which is but another species of hypocrisy&#44; 
on the other&#44; let us go a little farther into the extent of repent&#8211; 
ance. Repentance&#44; to be real&#44; must neither be partial nor tem&#8211; 
porary &#59; and if you once begin to find yourselves in the wrong &#59; 
if you discover&#44; lurking in your bosom&#44; the demon of impiety 
or insincerity&#44; it is your duty to root out the evil. Do not 
merely&#44; to use a physical simile&#44; cover it with a cataplasm&#44; to 
eradicate it by degrees&#44; but go resolutely to work&#44; and apply&#8211; 
ing the knife of reformation&#44; stop not till even the springs and 
roots of the malady are extracted. This alone can be a reforma&#8211; 
tion&#44; upon which the Almighty&#44; who knoweth all secrets&#44; can 
look with pleasure &#59; for every thing short of this is but self&#8211; 
deception&#44; since although we apparently attempt to deceive the 
Deity&#44; we cannot do so&#44; as He knoweth all the secrets of our 
hearts. And much as a sincere repentance is approved of in 
Scriptures&#44; we find a hollow and insincere confession of sin 
denounced as unpleasing and abhorrent to the God of truth &#59; for 
so we read in the seventy&#8211;eighth Psalm : 

&#34; Nevertheless&#44; they sinned again&#44; and they trusted not in 

his wonders. In vain endeavours passed away their lives&#44; and 

    <pb n="232"/>

232 THE VISITATION OF HEAVEN. 

their years in thoughtlessness. They sought Him when He 
smote them&#44; repented&#44; and called on God&#44; well remembering 
that God was their rock&#44; and the Supreme their Redeemer. 
And yet they thought to deceive Him with their mouth&#44; and 
with iheir tongue they lied to Him : but their heart was not 
firm on Him&#44; and they were not true to his covenant&#59; but He&#44; 
the Merciful&#44; forgave the iniquity&#44; destroyed them not&#44; with&#8211; 
drew often his anger&#44; and poured not out the whole of his 
wrath.&#34; 

Let me therefore beseech you&#44; brethren &#33; on this day of wo 
and lamentation&#44; to reflect that we&#44; in part&#44; as members of the 
human family&#44; are&#44; through our misconduct&#44; the cause that the 
pestilence now walketh abroad. And well has the destroyer 
fulfilled the command given him &#33; He appears within the walls 
of a city&#44; and the affrighted inhabitants fly as before the pur&#8211; 
suing sword of a vengeful foe &#33; Anon&#44; the men skilled in the 
craft of healing endeavour to grapple with the enemy &#59; they 
marshal their forces&#44; as well becomes them who ween them&#8211; 
selves to be the guardians of our health&#44; and in truth may 
deserve our thanks&#44; under Heaven&#44; for the care with which 
they apply the skill and experience which God has vouch&#8211; 
safed them. But wo &#33; neither flying nor skilful endeavours 
can shield the city &#59; and in the haunts of dissoluteness&#44; amongst 
the nightly&#39;&#8211; revellers&#44; in the house of the drunkard&#44; soon 
the groans of dreadful sufferings tell&#44; that here breaks a heart 
that expected not the stroke of death&#33; And desolation and 
mourning are carried into the bosom of many a virtuous family 
even &#40;for so is the sad visitation)&#44; and the number of the dying 
are hourly increased&#44; until the very heart within our bosom 
sinks&#44; and the chill of apprehension seizes hold of the stoutest 
mind&#33; &#8212; And all this is the fruit of sin&#44; the consequence of our 
transgression: and yet we hesitate&#44; we seem barely to heed the 
warning&#44; as though it spoke not as loudly as ever the prophet&#39;s 
voice did &#59; &#34; Return ye&#44; for why will you die&#44; house of 
Israel&#33;&#34; And 0&#44; say not: &#34;It is too late now&#44; &#8212; the plague is 
once upon us&#44; we cannot expect to be favoured &#59;&#34; no&#44; it is 
never too late&#44; for come with a sincere heart&#44; and you will be 
heard by your Father&#44; even in the hour of pressing danger &#59; 
for we are promised in the fiftieth Psalm: &#34; And but call upon 

    <pb n="233"/>

THE VISITATION OF HEAVEN. 233 

me&#44; in the day of trouble&#44; I will save thee&#44; if thou but honour&#8211; 
est me.&#34; &#8212; This is the language of God to his children &#59; and it 
is we only who reject the gracious boon by our perverseness 
and obduracy&#44; in thinking too little of the word of the Lord&#44; 
where so many glorious promises are held out&#44; to encourage the 
virtuous in his onward course&#44; and the sinner to repentance. &#8212; 
But neither should the contemptuous say: &#34; The danger will 
soon be over&#44; and in a few days&#44; all will be safe again&#33;&#34; by 
which he would argue&#44; that there is no necessity for repentance. 
But why&#63; is the danger over when the pestilence has passed 
away&#63; may it not return with fearful violence&#44; and sweep off&#44; 
as its first victim perhaps&#44; the very man&#44; who thinks all is 
right with him&#63; And again is this disease the only instrument 
of punishment&#63; we all know that this is not so&#59; and&#44; although 
the present occasion is peculiarly calculated to awaken our at&#8211; 
tention: there are a thousand occurrences in our daily experience 
calculated to admonish us&#44; that we are always in the hands of 
God&#44; and that in the midst of life we are in death&#33; &#8212; Another 
one may say: &#34; Why shall I repent&#44; I see no others doing so&#44; 
and what good can my example do&#63;&#34; Thus reasons the one&#44; 
who is in all his doings guided by fashion&#59; but the wise should 
resolve to do his duty at all risks&#44; to exercise the right&#44; if even 
he stands alone&#59; and as for the benefits of an individual&#39;s ex&#8211; 
ample&#44; every person&#44; even the most humble&#44; can do great ser&#8211; 
vice to virtue&#44; since we know not&#44; by what chain of events the 
efforts of the most lowly&#44; and the example of the most obscure&#44; 
may bring even a king upon his throne to repentance. 

Another objection&#44; which the ignorant may perhaps urge&#44; it 
behoves us to refute. It may be asked: &#34; Since the soul is im&#8211; 
mortal&#44; and since life is so surrounded by dangers&#44; why is it 
desirable&#44; that we should live&#63;&#34; &#8212; If it were&#44; indeed&#44; that every 
human being were entirely isolated&#44; unconnected with any 
other member of the human fiimily&#44; it might be at times&#44; to 
judge superficially&#44; a matter of indifference&#44; whether a man 
were to die or to live. But&#44; as every man is more or less con&#8211; 
nected with others of his species&#44; as upon the life and health of 
one man the welfare of perhaps thousands depends&#44; the sub&#8211; 
ject under consideration assumes a different aspect. The good 
may die&#44; as far as he himself is concerned&#44; with perfect advan&#8211;

tage to himself&#59; but the world cannot well spare him&#44; he is so 
to say a beacon&#44; by which other navigators of the ocean of life 
must steer their course&#33; And what is more animating&#44; what 
more exciting to virtue&#44; than to see the aged&#44; patriarchal sage&#44; 
dispensing the experience&#44; which his long and glorious life of 
wisdom and virtue has endowed him with&#63; And oh&#44; when his 
benignant smile is at length stayed by death&#44; when his benevo&#8211; 
lent eye is at length extinguished&#44; how lightly does the earth 
seem to drop upon the coffin of the departed&#44; and the grass and 
flowers that deck his grave seem to shed fragrance and bless&#8211; 
ing around them&#33; &#8212; And the sinner &#8212; is he fit to die&#63; where are 
his deeds of righteousness with which he can appear before 
God&#63; and he shall&#44; as a matter of indifference&#44; be suddenly cut 
off&#63; And truly&#44; to the world his departure can cause no sor&#8211; 
row &#8212; his presence will scarcely be missed by men&#59; &#8212; but to 
himself&#44; how dreary the prospect&#33; to die &#8212; his sins unrepented&#44; 
his transgressions unforgiven&#44; and his soul doomed to punish&#8211; 
ment&#44; till the Almighty Judge shall have decreed her sufferings 
as sufficient atonement&#33; It is&#44; therefore&#44; that long life is a 
blessing&#59; for the virtuous is blest&#44; whilst blessing others&#44; and 
the sinner is thereby indulged with ability to repent and be 
forgiven&#33; To be forgiven&#33; this idea is the bright star in the 
gloom of trouble&#33; to be forgiven if we repent&#44; for God is kind&#33; 
to be received back again in the mansion of our Father&#44; if we 
return &#33; How long this indulgence may be left us&#44; it behoves 
us not to guess at&#44; since God has called forth the pestilence&#59; and 
we&#44; therefore&#44; should all look upon ourselves as dying men&#44; as 
we know not whose bosom may next be perforated by the 
arrows of death which are scattered abroad. Let this day then 
be the commencement of a serious reformation&#44; so that if we 
are taken hence&#44; we may be admitted into happiness&#59; and that&#44; 
if even this be the last day that we shall be gratified here on 
earth by a view of the heavens&#44; by the light of the sun&#44; the 
verdure of the fields&#44; and the song of the woodland songsters 
when they warble forth their morning hymn to their Maker&#59; 
if even this be the last hour&#44; that we shall be permitted to see 
our friends&#59; if even this be the last time&#44; that we are in the 
house of God &#8212; we yet may be forgiven and received into 
God&#39;s favour&#44; and that&#44; when our soul awakens from the dream

of earthly existence&#44; and the trance of death&#44; she may join in 
with the chorus of angels&#44; and the rejoicings of the saints&#44; 
whose resting place is now round the throne of Glory&#44; over&#8211; 
shadowed by the grace of the Eternal One&#33; 

Lord &#33; grant us life and salvation&#44; spare us from the de&#8211; 
vouring scourge&#44; which Thou hast appointed&#44; to warn nations 
to repentance&#59; but if Thou hast decreed death upon us&#44; or any 
of thy children&#44; let then our departure and pain of dying be an 
expiation for our crimes&#44; and receive us in favour in thy pre&#8211; 
sence. Amen &#33;

reached its highest point of malignity in this place. It declined after the 
middle of that month &#59; but returned two years later&#44; although in a much

pardon Thou our transgressions &#33; 0&#44; our God&#44; we have been 
disobedient to thy will &#8212; do Thou forgive the children of thy

our misdeeds may have merited &#59; and vouchsafe to accept our 
fasting and prayer in pleasure. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 
It is but a few days since we listened in this place to the 
sound of the cornet&#44; which was to renew in our hearts the ac&#8211; 
knowledgment of God&#39;s almighty power&#44; and to rouse our 
minds to devotional feelings and repentance. &#8212; Let us hope&#44; 
that knowing the object of the blowing of the shophar&#44; it has 
not sounded in vain to our ears &#59; &#8212; that in this and other com&#8211; 
munities it has made some hearts conscious of their weakness &#59; 
and that they have been reinduced&#44; feeling the unworthiness of 
their course&#44; to espouse the cause of sacred religion&#44; firmly 
resolved to unite themselves so closely to their God&#44; that this 
bond of union shall never more again be broken. To bind 
ourselves to God &#8212; that is the chief&#44; in fact the only&#44; duty which 
the law demands of us&#44; and by it is understood an affectionate 
regard to the precepts of religion&#44; an entire reliance upon Di&#8211; 
vine Providence&#44; and a cheerful resignation to God&#39;s dispens&#8211; 
ation. &#8212; I say that this feeling may be termed the only duty 
which we have to fulfil &#59; for where the heart is so imbued&#44; 
obedience to the details of the law is the necessary consequence : 
and in return&#44; it is the result of a life of the most devoted piety. 
To effect this end&#44; therefore&#44; is the object of all the command&#8211; 
ments we have received &#59; and to prevent our ever losing sight 
of the same we have many ceremonial observances&#44; which 
uniformly tend to arrest our attention&#44; so that by being often 
led to inquire into the nature of religion&#44; we may be brought 
to apply the circumstances and events connected with them to 
ourselves&#44; and thus be rendered more thoughtful&#44; more contem&#8211; 
plative&#44; and in consequence more rational and more pious &#33; &#8212; 
As a consequence from this exposition&#44; we should never let 
any religious act be performed by ourselves&#44; or see it performed 
by others&#44; without our making an application of it to our situ&#8211; 
ation&#44; and suffering it in this manner to have the desired effect 
upon us. &#8212; The effect desired by the divine law is&#44; primarily&#44; 
obedience &#59; in the next place&#44; action &#59; thirdly&#44; improvement &#59; 
and lastly&#44; our happiness &#33; Observe&#44; brethren&#44; that not one 
religious duty is the result of a mere whim of the Deity &#59; for 

    <pb n="237"/>

no matter how unimportant soever any thing may seem to us&#44; it 
is intended for our moral&#44; and perhaps also our physical&#44; im&#8211; 
provement. &#8212; But what are the fruits of piety &#63; Contentment 
and satisfaction &#59; &#8212; contentment with the lot which the Almighty 
may have assigned us&#44; be it humble&#44; be it high : and satisfaction 
with ourselves &#8212; not that pompous self&#8211;sufficiency which would 
teach us to look upon ourselves as perfect&#44; and every one else 
as far beneath us &#59; but that sort of ease&#44; of calmness&#44; which 
arises from a review of a life unstained by irreligion&#44; not de&#8211; 
formed by moral turpitude. &#8212; And these are the fruits of the 
union with God which was alluded to above &#59; and what earthly 
treasures are beyond them in value &#63; are riches&#44; are power&#44; and 
glory &#8212; are honour and notoriety to be classed with them &#63; 
where are the riches which ever gave contentment and satis&#8211; 
faction &#63; when did power and glory leave a mortal nothing more 
to sigh for &#63; and did you ever see that man who was honoured 
of men and renowned for wisdom&#44; at whose heart the canker&#8211; 
worm of dissatisfaction gnawed not with greedy fatality &#63; &#8212; 
But the truly pious&#44; who looks upon the will of God as the 
purest source of all that is valuable&#44; and who regards his word 
as the essence of wisdom&#44; can never be said to be miserable&#44; 
can never be utterly bereft of all treasures &#59; for he carries that 
within him which no riches can buy&#44; aye&#44; that which the king 
on his throne&#44; even on the very day of triumph&#44; might envy&#44; 
for it is the invaluable treasure of an inward peace of mind. 
And taking this standard then as the standard of happiness&#44; we 
may inquire : &#34; Without an inward peace of mind&#44; how can 
life be happy &#63; without a peace with God&#44; how can our mind&#44; 
our life be peaceful &#63; without a love to God how can we have 
his peace &#63; without his religion how can we love Him &#63;&#34; &#8212; Thus 
should we reason&#44; brethren &#33; and if we do this&#44; we must of 
necessity turn our view from the world without to the mind 
within&#44; and if we find not peace there we will&#44; if we have not 
altogether closed our eyes against the only remedy within our 
reach&#44; endeavour to introduce into our soul the love of God 
and of his law&#44; as a restorative to heal the wounds of our ago&#8211; 
nized spirit. 

This view at once brings us to the inquiry : &#34;If piety is so 
valuable&#44; what means are we to use to acquire it &#63;&#34; To this 

    <pb n="238"/>

we answer&#44; &#8212; obedience and repentance. &#34; What is obedience &#63;&#34; 
It is not merely an acknowledgment in words of the justness of 
the divine commands&#44; not a mere theoretical acquiescence in 
the truth of revelation &#59; but also a cheerful and ever ready 
compliance with the demands of religion. In other words&#44; 
faith and belief alone&#44; though they are the guides to piety&#44; are 
not the sole component parts thereof&#44; for deeds alone can finish 
the beautiful structure of mental greatness&#44; which listening to 
the doctrines of faith and a confidence in their truth have com&#8211; 
menced in the soul of man &#59; or to comprehend the whole in 
one sentence&#44; religion should both be inward and outward &#33; 
&#34; And repentance &#63;&#34; is that state of regret for past misconduct&#44; 
and that atonement for errors which should be resorted to&#44; 
when we discover that our inward peace has been destroyed by 
a neglect of the laws of God&#44; or by an absolute contravention 
to the decrees of the holy Torah &#59; or in other words&#44; we should 
regret our past conduct&#44; and act differently from what we used 
to do&#44; as soon as we discover&#44; that we have strayed from the 
righteous path. Thus also speaks the prophet: 

&#34; Return&#44; O Israel&#44; to the Lord thy God&#44; though degraded by thy sins &#33; 
Turn but with prayer unto the Lord&#44; and say: Tliou Most Perfect&#44; Pardoner 
of sins &#33; accept our return to good&#44; and receive our words as favourably as 
Thou didst the offered steers.&#34; Hosea xiv. 2&#8211;3. 

&#34; Return&#44; Israel to the Lord thy God &#33;&#34; this is the call 
which the Shepherd addresses to the strayed flock&#59; it is the 
language of encouragement spoken by the Almighty himself to 
the reluctant&#44; trembling&#39;sinner&#59; it is the paternal invitation held 
out by the indulgent Father to the oft&#8211;offending and rebellious 
child. To understand now properly this prophetic call&#44; this 
invitation to the purifying and reconsecration of ourselves to 
divine service&#44; let us examine a little more minutely the nature 
of our dependence upon God&#44; the causes of our transgressions&#44; 
and the effect which the indulgence in sin must have upon us. &#8212;

To the first inquiry: &#34; What is the nature of our relation to 
the Deity&#63; in what respect are we said to be depending upon 
Him&#63;&#34; We answer : Man is indebted for his existence and 
preservation to God &#59; that is to say&#44; without a Creator&#44; no being&#59; 
can exist&#44; and without the continued watcht&#39;uhiess of this Crea&#8211; 
tor no created being can be preserved in existence. We are&#44; 
therefore&#44; absolutely speaking&#44; not only the mere works of God&#44; 
with whom He can act as pleases Him best &#59; but also nothing 
without Him&#44; since if He does not bless our efforts all our toil&#8211; 
ing is in vain&#59; and thus too our daily experience proves to us&#44; 
that not to the strong is the battle &#59; not to the swift the race &#59; 
not to the industrious riches&#44; and not to the wise&#44; bread. This 
position being admitted&#44; that we are nothing without God : it 
follows that being so dependent&#44; it should be our study to 
deserve favour&#59; or&#44; what is the same&#44; we should strive&#44; being 
certified of the will of God&#44; to live conformably to the precepts 
contained in the record of the divine will. To the reflecting 
mind&#44; therefore&#44; piety&#44; both theoretical and practical&#44; is the 
most natural&#44; and so far&#44; therefore&#44; from its being the effect of 
ignorance&#44; it springs from the best of knowledge&#44; the know&#8211; 
ledge of ourselves. &#8212; &#34; What now are the causes of sin&#63;&#34; &#8212; 
Man&#44; being unmindful of his origin&#44; and confident in his conceit 
of his own importance&#44; neglects to look with becoming defer&#8211; 
ence to the w&#39;lW of God&#44; and acts not as his reason dictates&#44; 
but as his passions or supposed interests lead. A man so con&#8211; 
stituted in mind imagines himself to be something superior to 
the rest of his fellow&#8211;beings&#44; or he thinks he has too great an 
interest at stake to be able to attend to the duties of a pious life&#59; 
and being thus&#44; as it were&#44; all in all to himself&#44; he weens he 
needs not further improvement &#59; his perfection he conceives to 
be complete&#59; and consequently the voice of religion cannot 
find in him a willing listener&#59; and as soon as this is the case 
the floodgates of sin are opened&#44; and sins upon sins&#44; crimes 
upon crimes&#44; are heaped upon the heart of the selfish&#44; proud 
reasoner&#44; and he stands a hideous spectacle of blasted moral 
deformity. &#8212; Another cause of irreligion can be found in care&#8211; 
lessness and a desire for pleasure&#44; which are to a full as perni&#8211; 
cious as the preceding cause. Some one imagines himself to 
be beneath the notice of Providence&#59; he thinks that to One so

elevated beyond all earthly influence&#44; as the God we adore&#44; 
will not notice &#40;it being&#44; as he thinks&#44; unworthy of the Divine 
Nature) the actions of man&#59; and since God does not regard our 
conduct&#44; it would be needless to pay any attention to the duties 
of religion&#44; by which we are taught to bridle our passions and 
to rein in our desires&#59; and consequently the voluptuary hurries 
on eager for his ruin&#44; till virtue is neglected and sin has become 
a habit too inveterate almost for reformation&#33; &#8212; But who of you&#44; 
brethi&#39;en&#44; sees not the folly of both the above excuses for sin&#63; &#8212; 
One boasts of the superiority of his reasoning &#8212; aye&#44; his superior 
wisdom &#8212; excellent moral energy&#33; &#8212; and in what are they dis&#8211; 
played&#63; in charity&#63; in filial piety&#63; in enlightening the ignorant&#63; 
in devotion&#63; No&#44; in avarice&#44; in the pursuit of ambition&#44; in 
idle declamation&#44; and in dissoluteness&#59; perhaps too in ridiculing 
those who dare to follow the better counsels of reason guided 
by the truths of revelation. &#8212; The irreligious scorns the humble 
believer&#44; and asks him: &#34; What avails all piety&#63;&#34; But with how 
much more justice must the moralist laugh at all the vain pur&#8211; 
suits of mankind who strut&#44; full of their own importance&#44; their 
brief space on the stage of life&#44; and are then hurried hence 
into oblivion&#44; into the total darkness of utter forgetfulness. &#8212; 
Look at the ambitious tyrant&#44; how he is toiling to oppress his 
subjects&#44; look at his fury when seeing his commands unobeyed 
&#8212; and then behold him again struck by the sudden dart of the 
pestilence&#44; and all his power broken&#59; and the veriest menial in 
his palace would not change situations with him&#44; who was but 
a few hours before envied and feared by all mankind&#33; &#8212; The 
philosopher who scoffs at the credulity&#44; so he calls it&#44; of others&#44; 
is not immortal&#59; for years he has poured forth his blasphemy&#59; 
he has even shocked his lellow&#8211;workmen in iniquity by his 
daring attacks on all that is sacred&#59; perhaps he imagines that 
he has succeeded in erecting to his name a monument of great&#8211; 
ness&#44; and that his system of selfish utility will rise triumphant 
above the ruins of religion&#59; but turn your eye upon him now&#44; 
he is smitten down with palsy&#44; hear his indistijict murmurings&#44; 
and the only articulate sounds he has uttered during his illness 
are prayers for a few more fleeting hours of existence&#33; &#8212; Again&#44; 
you call the rich man happy&#59; &#8212; his interest demanded his un&#8211; 
ceasing attention&#44; honest he was always&#44; for he prided himself

upon the name of correct&#44; punctual merchant&#59; but religion 
and the exercise of charity he knew barely by name&#44; they be&#8211; 
longed not to the routine of business&#44; and he therefore had no 
relish for them. But death arrested him in the midst of his 
endeavours &#59; and with not half his wants satisfied&#44; he is borne 
to the grave&#44; and strangers riot in his riches&#33; 

Now tell me&#44; doubter&#44; are such pursuits superior to the 
active pursuit of religion&#44; whereby imperishable good will be 
treasured up&#44; not here &#8212; where all is mortal &#8212; but there in hea&#8211; 
ven&#44; where no canker&#8211;worm destroys the fruit of virtuous 
deeds&#44; where no decay destroys imperishable monuments of 
God&#39;s favour&#44; where no death destroys the life everlasting &#63; If 
even&#44; therefore&#44; interest and wisdom alone were to teach us&#44; 
we ought from preference to choose piety. But it would not 
be consonant with true religion to serve God from motives of 
being rewarded &#59; for what does the law say &#63; &#34; Thou shalt love 
the Lord thy God with all thy heart&#44; with all thy soul&#44; and 
with all thy might &#59;&#34; meaning the love towards God should be&#44; 
not the respect of the servant who hopes for reward when his 
work is done&#44; but like the love which the dutiful child bears 
towards the parent&#44; where all the duties&#44; even those more 
arduous than a servant can perform&#44; are cheerfully submitted 
to without the hope of reward or favour. 

Having thus briefly examined the futility of pride as an 
excuse of sin&#44; let us turn to the second chief reason&#44; careless&#8211; 
ness. &#8212; The careless one saj&#39;s&#44; &#39;• God regards not our course of 
life&#44; it is unworthy of his greatness to imagine that He should 
trouble himself about the conduct of mortals.&#34; &#8212; But is it true&#44; 
that it is beneath the dignity of God &#63; &#8212; Pray&#44; inform us&#44; if 
thou canst&#44; careless sinner&#44; what is deserving of God&#39;s notice  
Is it to regulate the course of the stars&#63; the arrangement of 
nature&#63; the calling into being of all things&#63; These&#44; surely&#44; 
thou too wouldst call objects of grandeur &#8212; transcendant ma&#8211; 
jesty &#59; and yet they all are no more than thou art &#59; for the 
word that formed thee&#44; formed them too&#44; and however little 
thou mayest value thy importance&#44; thou wast created&#44; as well as 
the brightest star in the wide expanse of heaven&#44; for the glory 
of thy Maker &#33; &#8212; If man were thus to take a correct view of 
his. own importance in the scale of beings&#44; he would act as

becomes his dignity&#44; and the station he occupies&#44; as an intelli&#8211; 
gent creature of the Supreme Author&#44; and he would never suf&#8211; 
fer his life to pass away in the pursuits of pleasure and the 
empty nothings of this world. 

The Scriptures too inveigh against this sheltering of ourselves 
behind the idea of our being of but small importance&#44; and they 
emphatically teach us&#44; that nothing&#44; not excepting the acts of 
mortal men&#44; is beneath the notice of God&#44; for He surveys all with&#8211; 
out any effort&#44; and from his all&#8211;searching gaze nothing is hid&#8211; 
den. &#8212; And thus speaks the Psalmist : &#8212; &#34; Lord&#44; how long shall 
the wicked&#44; how long shall the wicked triumph &#33; They oppress 
thy people&#44; and afflict thine heritage &#59; they slay the widow and 
stranger&#44; and murder the fatherless &#59; and say : the Lord sees 
not&#44; and the God of Jacob regards it not. But understand&#44; ye 
brutish among the people &#59; and ye fools&#44; when will ye be wise&#63; 
He&#44; that planteth the ear&#44; shall He not hear &#63; He&#44; that formeth 
the eye&#44; shall He not see&#63; He&#44; that chastiseth the heathen&#44; shall 
He not correct&#63; He&#44; that teacheth man knowledge&#44; shall He not 
know &#63;&#34; &#8212; And if man would but reflect&#44; that to Him&#44; who cre&#8211; 
ated the materials of creation&#44; it cannot make any difference 
of exertion in producing the greatest or the smallest thing 
known &#59; that the same creative energy produced&#44; by word&#44; the 
hosts of constellations and the humble worm of the earth : 
he would never think that any thing could by any possibility 
be hidden from God &#59; for if He knows the course of nature in 
the aggregate&#59; if to his omniscience the beginning and the 
consummation of all is known&#44; can it be otherwise than that 
He should also know all that passes&#44; all that is transacted in all 
creation&#44; if even each star and every planet should be peopled 
by&#39; intelligent beings&#44; who like us act and think&#63; &#8212; But it is use&#8211; 
less almost to argue with one predetermined to sin &#59; he will 
strive to prove to you&#44; that there is no positive wrong in his 
conduct &#59; that it is immaterial upon the whole&#44; if he do this or 
omit doing the other: and either under the plea of insignifi&#8211; 
cance or superior mental endowments he will act as his tastes&#44; 
interest&#44; passions&#44; or folly&#44; may counsel him. 

These briefly are the causes of sin&#44; as far as I can speak of 
them with confidence &#59; much more may be said about the rami&#8211; 
fications in which these causes divide themselves&#44; but the limits

of an address do not permit me to enlarge any more upon them. 
Having thus seen the motives&#44; let us view the effects of trans&#8211; 
gression. To understand the pernicious effects of sin&#44; you 
should look with proper care upon the benefits of virtue&#44; and 
the contrast will teach you&#44; emphatically&#44; the advantages and 
disadvantages of either. &#8212; The virtuous will look upon himself 
as a servant of God&#44; amenable for every part of his conduct to 
a Superior Tribunal. In accordance with this consciousness&#44; he 
will be humble in his own person &#59; not too confident in assert&#8211; 
ing the claims of his own merit&#59; meek and submissive to 
others&#44; where mere superiority of rank or the maintainance of 
pride can be the result &#59; kind to those who are his inferior 
in life&#59; charitable to those who may need his gifts&#59; consi&#8211; 
derate to the unfortunate &#59; respectful to superiors&#44; parents&#44; and 
teachers : he will be the obedient son&#44; affectionate husband&#44; and 
watchful father &#59; withal cheerful in his own mind &#59; in short&#44; he 
will always be at peace with God&#44; his fellow&#8211;men&#44; and him&#8211; 
self &#33; &#8212; But the vicious is haughty&#44; and is&#44; as it were&#44; alone in 
the world&#44; for nothing can&#44; in his estimation&#44; be superior to 
self &#59; and in accordance with this assumption he will be over&#8211; 
bearing in his own. person &#59; always setting forth his superior 
claims to excellence &#59; insolent and arrogant to others&#44; never 
allowing them any superiority&#44; and will consider an offence 
against his dignity as almost the greatest crime &#59; he will be 
cold and distant to his inferiors&#44; even though they possess 
superior merit&#59; niggardly to the poor&#59; oppressive to the 
unfortunate &#59; cringing&#44; low and servile to superiors&#44; although 
he hates them in his heart &#59; rebellious to the comm.ands of his 
parents or teachers : he will be the disobedient son &#59; unkind 
husband&#44; and cruel father &#59; withal gloomy in his own mind &#59; in 
short&#44; he will always be at war with God&#44; with his fellow&#8211; 
beings&#44; and with himself &#33; &#8212; These are the fruits of virtue&#44; and 
these the results of vice. It needs no eloquence to impress 
upon your minds the beauty of the one&#44; and the deformity o 
the other &#59; and yet we hear many descanting upon the plea&#8211; 
sures they enjoy in their course of sin&#44; and laughing at those 
who act differently. Aye&#44; they are for a time intoxicated 
with the maddening draughts of seductive vice &#59; they are over&#8211; 
whelmed with the moral delirium of dissipation &#59; but at length.

be this consummation sooner or later&#44; they awake from their 
unnatural trance&#44; alive to all the horror of their exposed situa&#8211; 
tion&#44; and at the brink of ruin they discover &#40;to employ the 
words of Scripture)&#44; that their way&#44; which had appeared just in 
their eyes&#44; was in truth&#44; the way to death and destruction &#33; &#8212; 
Imagine now&#44; brethren&#44; what indeed you actually see almost 
every hour&#44; the sinner at length regretting the little benefit and 
the immense injury accruing to him as the wages of sin&#44; when 
he discovers&#44; when almost too late&#44; that all the subterfuges&#44; 
which passions invented&#44; are not able to hide&#44; even from his 
jaundiced vision&#44; the destructive end to which he has been 
luirrying : imagine him&#44; I say&#44; at this natural termination of all 
wickedness &#8212; what must his feelings be &#63; whither shall he fly 
for consolation&#63; To his own family &#63; Them he has neglected&#44; 
pei&#8211;haps has been to them the cause of thousand&#8211;fold misery and 
disgrace. To his friends and associates in transgression &#63; &#8212; 
they despise the weak fool who no longer is willing to devote 
heart&#44; body&#44; and soul&#44; to their proceedings : they despise and 
scorn the timid and broken down boon&#8211;companion&#44; and they 
will no longer his fellowship&#59; much less are they disposed to 
follow his advice about resigning their pleasures&#44; and will even 
say : &#34; Yoii speak now&#44; when you are weak and old&#44; of regret&#44; 
and amendment : so too we will do&#44; when we have rioted as 
long as you &#59; when our strength has become exhausted&#44; just as 
yours is now &#59; when our appetite has become cloyed by excess of 
enjoyment.&#34; Shall he turn for refuge to society&#44; to mankind at 
large &#63; No&#44; their enemy he has been &#59; he has trampled upon 
their laws&#44; and has derided their institutions&#59; and even now 
they are leading him off to the place of confinement&#44; there to 
expiate his ofiences against the ordinances of society. &#8212; Where 
then shall he find refuge &#63; &#8212; Even in that venerable faith&#44; which 
to him spoke not with the voice of the parent&#44; because he was 
deaf to its admonitions &#59; even in the bosom of that Church&#44; a 
native in whose covenant he was ashamed to confess himself &#59; 
even in the hope of salvation of that God&#44; whose laws he refused 
to regard with reverence&#44; and after whose inscrutible ways he 
madly dared to search &#59; for thus speaketh the word : &#34; Return&#44; 
Israel&#44; to the Lord thy God&#44; though degraded by thy sins.&#34;

but take this comfort to his agonized soul&#44; and the healing balm 
will not be wanting &#59; and if even much wrong has been com&#8211; 
mitted&#44; let every one who seeks&#44; because he needs&#44; for mercy&#44; 
reflect &#40;as teach our wise men)&#44; &#34;that the gates of mercy are 
never closed &#59;&#34; let him&#44; who is in want of consolation&#44; but 
fearlessly yet humbly approach&#44; and he may rest assured that 
his entreaty shall not be in vain: for as Jeremiah says &#40;Lamenta&#8211; 
tions iii. 25) : &#34; The Lord is kind to those who put their trust 
in Him&#44; to the soul that seeketh Him &#33;&#34; But there must not be 
any species of duplicity in this seeking&#44; in this return to good : 
there must not be holding out the left hand as it were to Hea&#8211; 
ven&#44; and seizing with the right the goods and pleasures of life 
with an unrelenting grasp&#44; for this would not be a return to the 
Lord with all our hearts &#59; on the contrary&#44; it could at best 
amount to no more than merely resigning that part of our 
enjoyments or occupations which has grown intolerable to us&#44; 
from the entire want of satisfaction it has hitherto afforded&#44; or 
the positive pain it may have produced. But a return to the 
Lord&#44; one that deserves the name&#44; should not merely be a 
regret of evil&#44; but a positive return to good&#44; so that we may be 
enabled to say in sincerity : &#34; Pardoner of sins&#44; accept our 
return to good &#33;&#34; for nothing less than this can be satisfactory 
to our heavenly Father&#44; who&#44; knowing every secret of the 
human breast&#44; cannot be deceived by outward appearance&#44; and 
cannot be satisfied whilst He discovers deceit lurking along 
with professed penitence &#33; 

&#34;How then shall we repent &#63; &#8212; What means are we to em&#8211; 
ploy to return to good &#63;&#34; &#8212; As soon as we are made conscious&#44; 
that our conduct is not such as we would like to become known 
to all the world &#59; as soon as we feel a burning sensation of 
shame&#44; of self&#8211;reproach &#59; the moment we feel by reflection or 
the admonition of others that we have acted unworthily of the 
dignity of human nature&#44; unbecoming the duties obligatory 
upon us as children of God : we should unhesitatingly set about 
removing the cause of self&#8211;reproach or the public reprehension &#59; 
we should pretermit repeating the act&#44; and at the same time 
endeavour to make reparation. If we have wronged another 
in his possessions&#44; person&#44; or reputation&#44; we should make repar&#8211; 
ation in kind &#59; that is to say&#44; we should restore the stolen or

wrongfully obtained property&#44; and add the fifth part of the 
value thereto&#44; as the law dictates&#59; if we have committed a 
personal injury&#44; we should endeavour to restore an equivalent 
in personal pleasures to the injured party&#44; as far as may be 
possible &#59; and if we have injured our neighbour in reputation&#44; 
we are bound to make public declaration that we have been 
unjust to him&#44; and we dare not withdraw ourselves behind our 
greatness if the offence has been committed towards an inferior&#44; 
for we should reflect that before God the greatest is no more 
ihan the least&#59; it should therefore make no difference to us 
what standing our wronged fellow&#8211;man may occupy in regard 
to ourselves. Having made reparation&#44; it will next be neces&#8211; 
sary to obtain his forgiveness&#44; if even we should thereby be 
compelled to humble ourselves &#59; and let not the advice of our 
pride ever prevent us from complying in this particular with 
the requisitions of religion &#59; and this part of repentance becomes 
the more necessary if we should be unable to make reparation 
in kind. But in case our offended friend be no longer in life&#44; 
or if the offence be one only between our God and ourselves&#44; 
the repentance due to Heaven should&#44; nevertheless&#44; not consist 
in a mere repentance of the heart alone. Acts&#44; too&#44; should 
in this case&#44; as well as in the preceding&#44; declare our sincerity&#59; 
and although to make a public show under ordinary circum&#8211; 
stances would be inexpedient&#44; yet it is necessary that the acts 
of religion and the inward penitence should become manifest 
enough to others&#44; to prove that a reformation has taken place 
in the mind of the sinner. And oh&#44; let no man be restrained 
from following this course because of the taunts of the irreli&#8211; 
gious world&#44; or from fear of being tliought insincere &#59; nor let 
him be deterred by the difficulties of a thorough reform&#8211; 
ation &#59; but let him proceed&#44; under whatever disadvantages he 
may labour&#44; and he may safely trust that the positive determin&#8211; 
ation to brave all for the sake of his God&#44; will cause the work 
to be of much easier accomplishment than he may himself 
imagine&#59; and let him be mindful of the just advice contained 
in the saying of the rabbles : &#34; Whoever comes to purify him&#8211; 
self will be assisted from heaven &#33;&#34; At the same time if the 
sinner wishes to be forgiven&#44; he must take especial care that 
his repentance consist not merely in one act of reformation &#59;

but as soon as he begins his return to God he must leave his 
evil ways entirely&#44; and endeavour to forget his having been 
accustomed to sin&#59; and as his life has during his season of 
wickedness been rendered miserable&#44; because he had not the 
peace of God&#44; he should strive with all his energy so to live

ings thou wilt meet with will then appear the chastisements of

of former restlessness of spirit thou wilt have mental quietness &#59; 
and in place of the hatred thou once didst feel for thy species&#44; 
love and compassion will reign in thy breast &#59; and in place of 
stubborn resistance to the will of God&#44; thou wilt submit to his 
just decrees with meekness and cheerful resignation &#33; 

A reformation which is to effect this is the one designated by 
the law and prophets as the true offering to the Deity&#44; and this 
is the contrite spirit which God will never despise. &#8212; Let us 
then unite&#44; brethren&#44; at this season appointed by our religion 
as the time emphatically devoted to repentance&#44; to seek again 
our Lord and his goodness &#59; it may be that we shall be graciously 
accepted before Him &#59; it may be that we shall obtain a commu&#8211; 
tation of the evil which may have been decreed against us&#44; and 
be received in favour by the Source of all mercy and forgive&#8211; 
ness &#33; Now indeed is the favourable time &#33; We lately prayed 
here&#44; in this house of God&#44; to spare us in the midst of the pes&#8211; 
tilence which then was raging around us &#33; Our prayer has been 
heard&#44; and not one of our number has been taken away&#44; and 
we are here again to thank the Lord for all his goodness &#33; But 
how shall we thank Him &#63; No words can express the grati&#8211; 
tude we should feel &#33; Many of us have been afflicted with the 
pestilence which has slain its myriads &#59; but none have been 
removed. What then but additional devotion can we offer&#44; 
what else should we do&#44; but to nerve ourselves to live more 
strictly in the ways of the Lord&#44; than we have hitherto been 
accustomed to do &#63; The observances of our religion&#44; strict

though they be&#44; slay no one&#44; let that be borne in mind&#59; and the 
little calls they may make upon our possessions and time&#44; bear 
no proportion to the pains&#44; and time&#44; and wealth we bestow&#44; 
one and all&#44; upon our worldly pursuits. &#8212; Let us be more punc&#8211; 
tual as a body in attending at the house of God &#33; Let me 
entreat you&#44; brethren&#44; in this perhaps my last address to you&#44; 
to forget each of you the peculiar grievance he may have to 
coijiplain of. I know that in a society like ours&#44; where everj&#8211; 
man thinks himself&#44; and in fact&#44; is upon an equality with his 
brother&#44; every man too deems himself of equal importance with 
the other&#44; and imagines his advice deserves to be listened to 
with all due deference&#44; I will admit that this should be so in 
part &#59; yet this grants no one the right&#44; either according to 
religion or common sense&#44; to separate himself from the congre&#8211; 
gation &#59; no one should deem his own grievance too great for 
forgiveness : since if this were so&#44; how can we&#44; any one&#44; the 
best of us&#44; hope for pardon from Heaven &#59; we&#44; who have all 
so grievously sinned &#63; I may&#44; though I hope not to do so. 
offend by my present remarks &#59; but long since have I felt deeply 
in spirit for the loneliness which our place of worship presents &#33; 
no one can imagine how much grief it must cause any sincere 
lover of his religion&#44; to see so little true respect paid to the 
sacred edicts&#44; which have been the admiration of the heathens 
even &#59; to see how we&#44; in this free country&#44; where we are at 
liberty to worship our God&#44; according to our holy faith&#44; without 
molestation&#44; show our stubbornness by seeking every pursuit 
but that of Heaven&#44; frequent every place but the house of God &#33; 
Brethren&#44; this ought not to be &#59; let us wipe this reproach from 
us &#59; let it not be said&#44; and said with truth&#44; that the churches of 
other denominations are filled with attentive audiences&#44; whilst 
our Synagogues are nearly empty &#33; Why should this be&#63; is 
not our faith as pure as the light of heaven &#63; is not our form of 
worship highly impressive &#63; is not our law as ancient as the 
descent upon Sinai &#63; Let us throw off the burden of this 
stigma upon our name&#44; let us be more united&#44; and let each 
person contribute to the public benefit by his purse&#44; as far as 
the means will allow with which God has blest him&#44; and by 
personal attendance where it may be needed. Let not one of 
us all hold back his contribution&#44; because of one silly reason or

other&#59; for be assured&#44; brethren&#44; that before God&#39;s judgment no 
fictitious excuses will avail aught&#44; whatever the world may 
think of them here. 

Since now we must all acknowledge&#44; that we have been sig&#8211; 
nally favoured&#44; much more than our merits deserve : we should 
in an equal degree also be more inclined to religious feelings&#44; 
more ready to be grateful to God for his kindness. I hope 
therefore that my words will have some weight&#44; and let me 
entreat you all to pay for once something more than tran&#8211; 
sient attention to my remarks. We have been spared&#44; not 
one of our number has fallen : let us do our best to deserve 
God&#39;s protection for a longer period. Perhaps this may be the 
last year that many of us shall have the felicity to celebrate a 
Sabbath of Repentance&#44; and to look forward for a Day of Atone&#8211; 
ment &#59; let us not then madly hasten hence before the judg&#8211; 
ment of Heaven&#44; with professions of religion on our lips&#44; whilst 
in truth we do every thing to injure permanently the cause of 
our faith&#44; by pulling down&#44; almost literally&#44; the walls of this 
sacred edifice. &#8212; One strong effort at union is all that is wanting 
to restore the proper respect and attendance at public worship&#44; 
and let it not be said&#44; that sordid interest or private pique pre&#8211; 
vented Jews from being united &#59; when we have in truth so 
much to be thankful for&#44; that we ought to endeavour to deserve 
a little of the good we enjoy. In many other countries the 
Hebrew is oppressed and despised &#59; here he is upon an equality 
with other citizens&#44; and is unmolested in the exercise of his 
religion. Yet in tyrannical countries the Jew has always been 
a true believer&#44; and a zealot in his .faith even to martyrdom &#59; 
let us then prove&#44; that in a free country the Jew is no less 
zealous&#44; no less animated with love of Heaven&#44; although the 
rod of persecution no longer compels him to seek shelter from 
the sword of man under the protection of the Almighty. &#8212; For 
even here we are not raised beyond hope of succour from Him &#33; 
life is yet heir to thousands of ills&#44; to numerous cares&#44; to mani&#8211; 
fold vexations and disappointments &#59; and although free and 
citizens&#44; we cannot expect to combat with these ills successfully 
without the helping hand of the Supreme Protector &#33; And 
then&#44; besides being citizens of these free states&#44; we are also 
members of the Jewish nation&#44; the people chosen by God as

his peculiar treasure &#59; and as such we have to take care&#44; that 
we do not become commixed with the nations of the earth &#59; for 
we have a glorious hope of a restoration to a land once our 
own&#44; under a leader appointed by God to restore peace on 
earth&#44; to judge with justice&#44; and in whose days universal know&#8211; 
ledge and universal liberty shall reign. &#8212; Further&#44; we are chil&#8211; 
dren of salvation&#44; but this salvation every one must earn for 
himself by virtue and piety&#44; whilst in this life of probation &#33; 
Then at last we are children of God&#44; to whom as a Parent we 
owe filial obedience&#44; and humble resignation as our Creator &#33; 
As such then&#44; as men free and untrammelled by oppression&#44; as 
Jews&#44; as children of salvation&#44; and creatures of God&#44; let us 
return to the Lord whom we have forsaken&#44; and seek his for&#8211; 
giveness &#59; so that we ma)&#34;&#8211; be sealed in the book of everlasting 
life when the final decree is sealed in the heavenly tribunal. 

our Father in heaven &#33; we thank Thee for the manifold 
blessings we enjoy &#59; for the many mercies which we have un&#8211; 
deservingly obtained from thy bounty. Humbly do we acknow&#8211; 
ledge that it was thy grace which protected us&#44; thy providence 
which shielded us &#33; We have&#44; Father&#44; no ofierings to bring 
for all this goodness&#44; save the humble but sincere offering of 
truly grateful hearts &#33; shield us further by thy majesty &#59; 
guard us henceforward&#44; that we may not stumble &#59; and enlighten 
our hearts&#44; that we may see how injurious it is to leave thy 
ways&#44; and how refreshing to live conformably to thy will. 
Let the light of thy countenance shine unto us while living on 
earth&#44; and when we depart&#44; take us under the shadow of thy

of thy omnipotence&#44; in the felicity thou grantest to thy servants &#33;

DISCOURSE XXIV. 

THE ADVENT OF MESSIAH. 

Lord of the universe&#44; to whom all power appertaineth. 
bless and protect thy people in their captivity&#44; and guard their 
dispersions lest they fall a prey to their enemies&#44; and hasten 
the time of their reunion on thy holy mountain. Amen&#33; 

Brethren &#33; 
It is often asserted that we Israelites have no definite ideas 
of our religious doctrines&#44; that the light of the Bible&#44; although 
at first given to us&#44; sheds no benignant ray into our minds&#59; in 
short&#44; it is boldly maintained that we grope in darkness&#44; and 
are like the untutored infant in the midst of a collection of 
books&#44; unable to profit by the stores of learning contained in 
them&#44; because he has as yet not been taught to decipher their 
meaning. If by this and the like charges it is meant to be 
conveyed&#44; that we are entirely unable to give as reasonable de&#8211; 
finitions of our tenets as other denominations: then is the charge 
utterly false&#44; for we have those among us who&#44; having deeply 
studied the pages of Sacred Writ&#44; and whose researches having 
entered deeply into the legacies of divine wisdom&#44; can and do 
publicly proclaim what are the duties which&#44; as Jews&#44; we owe 
to God. And can it be said&#44; that the plain and obvious know&#8211; 
ledge so richly spread forth in revelation speaks no longer in 
intelligible terms to our people &#63; who will be bold enough to 
hazard the assertion&#44; that those promises which&#44; more than two 
thousand years ago&#44; were held forth to inspire hope into the 
fainting spirit&#44; to instil confidence into the wavering mind&#44; now 
no longer breathe the holy inspiration&#44; and the same refreshing 
invigoration which are inherent in the oracles of God &#63; &#8212; But if 
we are accused of an indifierence to religious instruction &#59; if 
our adversaries assert that we are not such strict observers of 
the law as we should be &#59; if we are told&#44; that with the best

light we act as though we were in darkness : we must with 
shame confess the truth of these accusations &#59; for although in&#8211; 
struction has been offered to us ever since the promulgation of 
the law&#44; it is lamentable to see how few profit thereby &#59; how 
rarely it is that a public teacher will be listened to&#44; how plea&#8211; 
sant soever his instruction may be. And then&#44; even if he be 
listened to&#44; even if the people should come to hear him&#44; how 
few go away resolved in their minds to profit by the lessons 
they have heard &#59; aye&#44; we listen&#44; we acknowledged the just&#8211; 
ness of the rebuke addressed to our consideration &#59; but we go 
away from the lecture as bad as we entered the place of wor&#8211; 
ship &#59; and if even a virtuous resolution should have for a mo&#8211; 
ment sprung up in our minds&#44; we endeavour all in our power 
to suppress its incipient working and are well nigh ashamed&#44; 
that even for a brief space of time we could find aught blame&#8211; 
able in our course of life. Nay&#44; we perhaps blame the teacher 
for his unjust severity in placing cases before us by which we 
were induced to apply the rules he laid down to ourselves&#44; and 
upon second thoughts we imagine&#44; that no part of the lecture 
could be justly applicable to our case &#59; and to be brief&#44; we 
think&#44; that although others might need instruction and refor&#8211; 
mation&#44; it is not we who are among the number. &#8212; It is owing 
chiefly to these causes&#44; to an overweening confidence in our 
virtue&#44; and to an undue notion of our importance and wisdom&#44; 
that we find so small a share of real religious feeling and a 
proper respect for teachers of religion among us. Hence it is 
that the world and its goods are so highly esteemd&#44; and 
that many&#44; very many&#44; of our people pay but little attention 
to their immortal happiness. It is true&#44; they see riches snatch&#8211; 
ed away from the grey&#8211;headed man&#44; who all his life has been 
the slave to avarice &#59; they behold the young and rich nurseling 
of pleasure borne to the grave : yet whilst poverty does not 
reach them&#44; they dream not that penury may be their lot also 
one day&#59; and whilst they enjoy life and health&#44; they place dis&#8211; 
ease and death at so great a distance&#44; that they appear not worth 
minding &#33; And call their attention to their last day&#44; place be&#8211; 
fore them the horrors of dissolution&#44; and you will perhaps be 
ridiculed as a fanatic and your best admonitions answered by a 
laugh of derision&#33; &#8212; Am I wrong in my remarks &#63; would to

God&#44; that all our people were virtuous and fond of listening to 
instruction&#44; and let me then be accused of speaking ftilsely and 
unjustly severe of them &#59; but whilst the facts are&#44; as I have 
represented them&#44; I must&#44; if I speak at all&#44; boldly express the 
truth&#44; and let no one think that this truth is less mortifying to 
me than it is to any of my hearers &#59; for am I not too an 
Israelite&#63; and are not the fault and the consequent shame mine 
as well as others&#39;&#63; But not through flattering ourselves can 
our moral state be improved&#44; any more than the physician can 
cure his patient by encouraging him to indulge in those ex&#8211; 
cesses which have deprived him of health. &#8212; It was owing to 
the belief&#44; that all my admonitions were useless&#44; belief do I 
say&#63; I am wronging myself&#44; to the absolute fact &#8212; that my 
several addresses had failed to draw our population to the house 
of God&#44; that I had almost resolved never to address you again&#44; 
believing that you did not wish to hear me speak to you upon 
religious subjects. Understand me&#44; I do not say&#44; that I ever 
entertained the idea&#44; that all were unwilling to hear me&#44; for I 
am well convinced that there are some who always urged me 
to persevere &#59; neither should any one imagine that it was of&#8211; 
fended pride&#44; in not receiving hearers enough&#44; which counselled 
me to desist. No&#44; although not indifferent to the approbation 
of those capable of judging&#44; yet would I have willingly forgone 
all praise&#44; would have gladly exposed myself to obloquy and 
hatred&#44; if by so doing I could have advanced the cause of reli&#8211; 
gion and induced a more regular attendance upon our hoi&#34; 
worship &#33;&#42; But failing in this&#44; and discovering that sermons 
in the language of the country were not universally approved 
of &#59; I thought that&#44; all things considered&#44; it would be best not 
to trouble you any more to pay attention to mj&#39; addresses&#44; 
which some no doubt may also have thought an innovation in 
our worship&#44; though in truth&#44; it was first in our S)&#39;nagogues 
and schools&#44; as early as the days of the second&#44; and perhaps too 
of the first temple&#44; that religious instruction was publicly dis&#8211; 

&#42; Several paragraphs of a private nature&#44; and more immediately addressed 
to the congregation of this city&#44; have been omitted&#44; and the parts retained 
are published from no other motives&#44; but that the reproof they contain is ap&#8211; 
plicable to the inhabitants of other places as well as our own.

pensed&#44; and it is from us&#44; that a kindred faith&#44; kindred so far as 
it rests for its tenets upon our Scriptures&#44; has borrowed the 
custom. It was in accordance with tliese views&#44; that I in my last 
discourse announced&#44; that it might probably be the last &#59; and 
do not think me inconsistent&#44; that&#44; with some of my views un&#8211; 
changed&#44; I now again address you. No&#44; it was not mortified 
pride wliich advised me to desist from my labours&#59; nor is it 
caprice which induces me to resume them. I do yet&#44; as I before 
did&#44; doubt my ability to effect any good purpose &#59; but I yield 
to the opinion of others&#44; who have advised me to continue what 
I once have begun&#44; and I shall&#44; therefore&#44; from time to time&#44; 
so it be God&#39;s will to preserve me&#44; give you my views on reli&#8211; 
gious matters&#44; as far as I know&#44; or am acquainted with&#44; the 
tenets of our belief. I do not aim at novelty&#59; but all I shall 
endeavour to accomplish is&#44; to claim your attention to youi&#42; 
permanent concerns&#44; which should from their importance claim 
at least an equal share with your worldly pursuits. Per&#8211; 
haps&#44; I may not see any good arising from my endeavours&#44; 
before my voice be silenced&#44; my heart be stilled&#44; by death&#59; but 
there may&#44; nay&#44; I am almost confident there will&#44; arise some 
one after me&#44; who will be able to follow up with more certain 
success my humble beginning&#44; and thus&#44; although I may not 
live to see it here&#44; I shall have in another state the satisfaction 
not to have striven in vain&#33; &#8212; Having said thus much&#44; which I 
conceived to be due both to you&#44; brethren&#44; and to me&#44; permit 
me to draw your attention to one of the most important tenets 
of our belief&#44; to wit&#44; the Advent of the Messiah&#44; and the res&#8211; 
toration of the Israelites to their former land. &#8212; On this subject 
we read the following in the fourth chapter of Micah : 

&#34; And it shall come to pass at the end of days&#44; that the mountain of the 
house of the Lord shall be prepared above the mountains &#59; and it shall be 

    <pb n="255"/>

THE ADVENT OF MESSIAH. 255 

raised above the hills&#44; and to it shall stream the nations. And many nations 
shall go and say&#44; come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord&#44; and 
to the house of tlie God of Jacob&#44; and He shall teach us of his ways&#44; and 
we will walk in his paths &#59; for &#40;says the prophet) from Zion out shall go the 
law and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.&#34; Micah iv. 1&#8211;2. 

In Isaiah &#40;see the beginning of the eleventh chapter) we 
read : 

&#34;And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse&#44; and a branch shall 
growoutof his roots.&#34; &#8212; And further: &#34;They shall not injure&#44; nor shall they 
destroy in all my holy mountain&#44; for the earth shall be full of knowledge of 
the Lord&#44; as the waters cover the sea. &#8212; And it shall come to pass on that 
day&#44; that the Lord will again display his power&#44; to bring in the remnant of 
his people &#8212; and He will raise up a banner to the nations&#44; and gather the 
exiles of Israel&#59; and the dispersions of Judah He will assemble from the four 
corners of the earth &#33;&#34; 

That the passages just cited relate to a time which has not 
yet been experienced&#44; either by our or any other nation&#44; cannot 
be denied&#59; and whereas the words of Scripture have either 
come to pass or will eventually&#39; do so&#44; we say&#44; that we have 
either felt their fulfilment&#44; or that we look forward to their even&#8211; 
tual accomplishment. The first is knowledge&#44; the latter is 
hope&#59; and although we have no &#39;ocular evidence by which we 
can dive into the future&#44; yet we can compare this future with 
the past&#44; of which we have record in history&#44; or appeal to our 
daily experience&#44; which is the present&#44; and consequently to us 
mortals the best of evidence. Now the question is: &#34;What does 
past history or present experience teach concerning Scripture&#8211; 
promises&#63; or&#44; in other words&#44; has any thing ever occurred 
which tended to verify Scripture&#8211;predictions&#44; and are there any 
events now in progress to verify these predictions &#63;&#34; &#8212; To these 
questions we answer&#44; that many predictions contained in the 
Bible have&#44; in times gone by&#44; seen their fulfilment&#44; and as far 
as the present period is concerned&#44; we also see the effects of 
these accomplishing events daily perpetuated. Not to multiply 
examples&#44; let us refer to the admonitions contained in the books 
of Moses concerning our people. &#8212; They were there promised 
that they should enter the land of Canaan &#59; but that the nature of 
their tenure should be&#44; an exact obedience to the command&#8211; 
ment contained in these books&#44; &#8212; The event proved the truth of 

    <pb n="256"/>

256 THE ADVENT OF MESSIAH. 

the prediction. The Israelites entered Palestine and conquer&#8211; 
ed it. &#8212; Long they lived within its boundaries&#44; and no nation 
was able&#44; during some periods of their history&#44; to withstand 
their power&#44; and yet they were but few in number&#44; living on 
a narrow margin of the eastern termination of the Mediterra&#8211; 
nean Sea &#59; what then&#44; we ask&#44; made them so strong&#63; it was the 
power vouchsafed to them for obedience to the divine will. &#8212; 
Anon they tresj)assed &#8212; they were in truth tired of happiness &#8212; 
and followed the idolatrous course of other nations &#59; again and 
again were they warned of the threatening danger&#44; and they 
laughed at the voice of admonition : but the evil nevertheless 
came over them like a whirlwind&#44; and they were swept from off 
the surface of their land&#44; and fifty &#8211;two years of utter desolation 
saw not the foot of man or domestic beast treading the deserted 
highways of ruined Palestine. &#8212; But seventy years soon elapsed&#44; 
and at their ending a small number of Jews&#44; now no longer the 
united Israelites&#44; returned to repossess their land&#44; and again 
they dwelt therein &#59; but not in that independence and national 
greatness which had been once theirs. A second time the tem&#8211; 
ple was built&#44; and the smoke of sacrifices was again seen to 
arise from the sacred altar&#33; But wo&#33; bloodthirstiness and dis&#8211; 
union broke out among them&#44; and the land&#44; which should not 
1)6 defiled by innocent blood&#44; saw it shed in torrents &#59; the bro&#8211; 
ther murdered the brother at the foot of the altar&#44; and in the 
courts of the temple the aged was slain&#33; The Lord saw it&#44; 
and his anger was kindled&#44; and the ruthless foe destroyed all&#44; and 
passed the plough over thy prostrate ruins&#44; sacred Jerusalem &#33; 
He called thy name Jlelia&#44; he imagined thus to root out thy 
memory from our minds&#33; but he was deceived&#44; holy city&#44; 
residence of the Most High&#44; and even desolate as thou yet art&#44; 
thou hast seen that tyrant&#39;s empire subverted by hords of un&#8211; 
heard of barbarians&#44; whilst thou art even in ruins the Jioly place 
of many nations&#33; In this manner was the prediction of our 
downfal accomplished&#59; and what is more remarkable still is&#44; 
that despite of this entire subversion of our state&#44; our nation 
has not ceased to exist. Whatever interdicting our worship&#44; 
slaughtering&#44; burning and torturing could accomplish&#44; has been 
tried by heathens&#44; Nazarenes and Mahomedans &#59; but yet all 
their toiling has been of no avail&#59; for we have been promised. 

    <pb n="257"/>

THE ADVENT OF MESSIAH. 257 

that even in the land of our enemies we should not be utterly 
forsaken&#44; as even there the Lord would still continue to be our 
Protector and our Father&#33; It is to this jjromised supreme pro&#8211; 
tection&#44; not to any inhei&#39;ent obstinacy of our race&#44; that we have 
hitherto continued a nation&#44; undivided and unbroken&#44; although 
dispersed over all lands&#44; before the Lord. If then any one 
asks for a verification of Scriptural promises&#44; we can point to 
our past history&#44; and to our present experience&#44; and if even we 
cannot convince the unbeliever of the absolute certainty of our 
hope&#44; we believing Israelites have enough to uphold us in our 
faith under whatever sufferings it may please the Almighty to 
aiflict us with. &#8212; Having premised thus much&#44; we will now con&#8211; 
sider the promised future as absolutely certain and inevitable&#44; 
as it is the decree and emanation of the same unending Being 
who before has promised&#44; and fulfilled to the letter the pro&#8211; 
mises He had made. &#8212; The future then&#44; to which we confidently 
look&#44; because it has been predicted&#44; is the change which prophets 
have announced as to come over the nature of things in the social 
organization of mankind. &#8212; A time will come&#44; when the Lord 
will raise up a Branch from the root of Jesse&#44; who shall be the 
ruler of the Israelites&#44; and in whose days universal peace and 
universal knowledge shall reign. &#8212; This prince&#44; so raised up by 
the special interposition of God&#39;s providence&#44; shall be endowed 
with the spirit of prophecy&#44; and be as good as he shall be wise. 
To him justice shall be as it were a girdle&#44; and &#34; truth a belt&#44;&#34; 
that is to say&#44; strict and impartial justice shall be administered 
by him&#44; since the wisdom which shall rest upon him is to be 
the special gift of Heaven&#44; and therefore he will be incapable 
of erring. Besides this&#44; peace shall be every where prevailing&#44; 
and no nation will practise any longer the destructive arts of 
war&#44; because the desire for aggrandizement and oppression&#44; as 
well as the power of executing injustice&#44; shall be removed. &#8212; 
Independently of all this&#44; the outward and temporal tranquillity 
will be more than overbalanced by the spiritual renovation 
which is to take place. &#34; The earth shall be full of the know&#8211; 
ledge of the Lord&#44;&#34; says the prophet&#44; the law of the Most 
High will then indeed become the beacon&#8211;light to all nations &#59; 
and thus many nations shall say: &#34;Let us go to the house of 
the God of Jacob&#44; and He shall teach us of his ways&#44; and we

will walk in his paths.&#34; And the people of Israel who have so 
long and so patiently endured all the contumely and the oppres&#8211; 
sion for the sake of the holy and venerated law &#63; they&#34; shall be 
gathered from amidst all the nations where they have been dis&#8211; 
persed&#44; and they shall be brought back to the land which God 
promised to Abraham when He made with him the covenant 
to give to him and to his descendants the land comprised be&#8211; 
tween the Euphrates and the river of Egypt&#44; a land which shall 
then be fruitful in the extreme&#44; where famine shall be unknown&#44; 
and where no wild beast nor poisonous reptile shall injure or 
destroy&#33; And the temple at Jerusalem &#63; it shall be rebuilt in 
more than its former splendour&#44; and the walls then reared shall 
endure uninjured and unapproached by any foreign invader&#44; for 
the Lord will be around them like a wall of fire&#33; &#8212; Envy&#39; more&#8211; 
over shall be banished&#44; and the divisions and quarrels which 
caused twice our banishment&#44; shall be no more heard of &#59; for 
the reason that oppression both internal and external must have 
ceased&#44; when the anointed king&#44; the Messiah of the Lord&#44; shall 
reign on earth&#33; &#8212; The foregoing is a summary of the many 
coinciding prophecies to be found in the Bible&#44; and it will be 
seen&#44; that the reign of the Messiah is to be one of good will to 
all men. &#8212; It would be out of place in a discourse to mix con&#8211; 
troversial matters&#44; and to recite the opinions entertained by 
others respecting the prophecies cited above. To prove the 
correctness of our ideas were easily possible&#44; but neither is this 
the place nor would it answer any good purpose to do so now. 
Enough&#44; that our hopes are founded upon the evident and literal 
interpretation of the biblical text&#44; and any other explanation is 
unworthy of the sacred oracles&#44; where&#44; if we but knew the 
exact meaning of the words&#44; and if we were but certain to what 
the prophets alluded&#44; when they spoke to a nation having a 
community of feelings and a peculiar mode of expression&#44; we 
should never be at a loss to agree about the import of any sen&#8211; 
tence. But unfortunately&#44; much has been lost in the lapse of 
so many centuries&#44; and among so many and multifarious suf&#8211; 
ferings. &#8212; Yet much&#44; nay&#44; the greater part&#44; is yet very evident&#44; 
and where this is the case&#44; where the words employed by the 
Bible are yet well understood&#44; where the imagery employed 
requires no extraneous elucidation: there&#44; even at this distance 

    <pb n="259"/>

of time and place&#44; we need not seek for any interpretation&#44; 
save what the words employed convey. &#8212; And the passages re&#8211; 
lating to the Messiah are for the most part of this obvious and 
self&#8211;evident nature&#59; and as the promises made there have as yet 
not been literally fulfilled&#44; we say&#44; that their accomplishment 
is yet to take place. Some one may ask: &#34;By what means are 
we to distinguish the Messiah&#63; how are we to ascertain that he &#39; 
is of the descendants of David&#44; since the division of families 
rests no longer upon a sure foundation &#63;&#34; &#8212; To these and similar 
objections we reply: that whenever the true Messiah shall ap&#8211; 
pear he will bring such evidences of his mission&#44; that his truth 
will not be doubted&#59; he will not come to be rejected&#44; he will 
not come to be persecuted and executed like a malefactor&#59; no&#44; 
he is to be the Prince of Israel&#44; the Shepherd David of God&#39;s 
people&#59; the righteous judge of the oppressed&#44; and the arbiter 
of formerly contending nations. How he will verify his mis&#8211; 
sion is not for us to inquire&#59; but enough we know to say&#44; 
that whenever he appears&#44; his mission will be universally ac&#8211; 
knowledged&#44; and his rule every where submitted to&#33; &#8212; &#34; When 
is the appointed time&#63;&#34; to this question we have to answer&#44; 
that nowhere in the prophets is this with distinctness declared&#44; 
on the contrary&#44; such terms&#44; as: At the end of days &#59; at the 
time of the end &#59; at the true end&#44; are employed&#44; to convey us 
an indefinite idea of the time of the advent. Wo then are in 
constant hope of the arrival of the period of universal peace 
and universal knowledge&#44; and thus we have always before us 
the strongest incentive to virtue and repentance&#44; for upon a 
sincere return to the Lord&#44; we are taught&#44; depends the accelera&#8211; 
tion of the time of the arrival of the Anointed. &#8212; But if we will 
not repent&#44; we retard our and the world&#39;s happiness till the 
time which Providence has set as the limit&#44; beyond which the 
regeneration will not be delayed&#59; and when it will be proved 
to all&#44; that it was God who had afflicted Israel for their trans&#8211; 
gressions&#44; and that it was for their sins&#44; that He suffered them 
to linger so long in almost hopeless captivity. And then it will 
be seen&#44; that God alone is King and Ruler of the universe&#44; 
when He will return to Zion in glory&#44; and for everlasting dwell 
in his temple at Jerusalem&#33;

DISCOURSE XXV. 

THE INSTITUTION OF SACRIFICES. 

Thou who art exalted above all existing beings&#44; &#8212; to whom 
the whole that is&#44; is as nothing&#44; &#8212; but who receivest in grace the 
acts of worship of the works of thy hands&#44; receive us in favour 
when we approach Thee with prayer&#59; and accept our humble 
offering when we devote our hearts and souls and our possessions 
to thy will &#33; Amen &#33; 

Brethren &#33; 

When we survey the events of life&#44; and investigate seriously 
the chain of circumstances which occurred since we entered 
into being: we will be struck with the remarkable fact&#44; that 
amidst all our toiling we have rarely been able to accomplish 
any thing very remarkable&#44; either for its wisdom or greatness. 
It is not&#44; that some of us may not be as wise or as good as 
those&#44; who have succeeded in doing mankind essential service&#44; 
and who have raised to themselves&#44; what we would call&#44; lasting 
monuments of greatness&#59; but solely because no opportunity for 

    <pb n="261"/>

display has offered itself to us. &#8212; Man&#44; in fact&#44; to distinguish 
himself&#44; requires that the materials of greatness &#40;if I may use 
the expression) should be laid abundantly within his reach&#44; and 
all that the greatest master&#8211;mind is capable of doing is to 
fashion the materials thus given into something&#44; by which either 
he or others may be aggrandized or benefitted. But then again&#44; 
he cannot work by himself&#59; for give a man ever so many op&#8211; 
portunities he cannot do much&#44; unless aided by others &#59; since 
life is so short and health so uncertain&#44; that nearly every un&#8211; 
dertaking must be left unfinished&#44; if not many work simul&#8211; 
taneously upon the same plan of action. If it were necessary&#44; 
it were easily possible to prove this by the most isolated acts 
of greatness&#44; accomplished by the greatest of mortals&#59; but its 
evident truth&#44; as a general rule&#44; will obviate the necessity. &#8212; I 
speak not&#44; however&#44; of virtuous actions&#44; of deeds of faith&#44; 
but only of worldly affairs&#44; where a man is not so much an indi&#8211; 
vidual&#44; as a part of a general system&#44; or in other words&#44; a member 
of society. &#8212; It is in the latter capacity that he must fail of distin&#8211; 
guishing himself&#44; if he has not the opportunity given by being 
raised above the level of his fellows&#44; since otherwise his acts 
will all be confined to himself&#44; or his immediate connexions&#44; 
and therefore apparently inoperative upon the general mass 
without. &#8212; Great acts&#44; therefore&#44; being difficult of accomplish&#8211; 
ment&#44; and what is more&#44; not being always useful: it would 
seem to follow&#44; that it is inexpedient to be striving for their 
attainment. And in truth&#44; as a general rule&#44; it were best that 
no attention whatever should be paid towards attempting great 
things&#59; for it is through these attempts&#44; whether successful or 
unsuccessful&#44; whether good or bad&#44; that so much evil has been 
entailed upon mankind. &#8212; Besides&#44; if only the truly virtuous 
and highly gifted were to undertake this task&#44; but very little 
evil&#44; comparatively speaking&#44; would be the consequence&#59; but 
the misfortune is&#44; that so many bad and interested men scram&#8211; 
ble for greatness and notoriety&#44; that hardly any thing but posi&#8211; 
tive evil is the general consequence of the almost universal 
desire for distinction. 

It is this knowledge of the utter inefficiency of all our best 
endeavours&#44; which induced our wise men in many instances to 
counsel their hearers : &#34; Try to keep thyself distant from 

    <pb n="262"/>

earthly greatness&#59;&#34; or&#44; &#34; He who pursues honour&#44; will not 
attain her &#59; she will fly from him.&#34; &#8212; &#34; If then&#44; we are not to 
be ambitious&#44;&#34; some one will ask&#44; &#34; what should be the aim of 
our life&#63;&#34; The answer is: if it were that we ourselves were 
perfect and unimproveable&#44; our life would indeed be spent in 
uselessness&#44; unless we attended to actions connected with the 
world&#59; but&#44; since we must&#44; with the smallest share of penetration&#44; 
discover&#44; that we have always an object of attention within 
ourselves: we shall&#44; if we set a proper value upon our improve&#8211; 
ment&#44; have enough to do for the entire brief space of time 
which we are permitted to sojourn in this state of existence. And 
in the attention which we thus pay to ourselves&#44; we may rest 
assured that we adopt the best means of improving ourselves 
and benefitting others&#59; for if we weigh every act and thought 
we shall seldom&#44; if we have correct knowledge&#44; be led into 
error&#44; and the nature of truth is so organized&#44; that benefit and 
instruction must flow out of its contemplation as well as prac&#8211; 
tice. &#8212; And since life&#39;s best efforts are&#44; according to the foregoing 
exposition&#44; to be directed to details more than to entire systems 
of action&#44; it is that&#8211; we have in our religion&#44; revealed to us 
and to the world for our guidance and instruction&#44; so many 
particular precepts&#44; relating to the various stages of
life especially. It was tlie object of our Father&#44; to educate&#44; so 
to say&#44; his children&#44; that they might become worthy members 
of his family&#44; and fit to inhabit the universal palace which He 
has opened for all the living&#44; without distinguishing whether 
they be Israelites or gentiles&#44; whether rich or poor&#44; whether 
wise or foolish&#44; whether powerful and exalted&#44; or oppressed 
and humble. For in God&#39;s mansion the doors are always open&#44; 
the entrance is only closed to the undeserving &#59; as the price of 
admission to its pleasures is a virtuous life&#44; according to the 
best endeavours&#44; guided by the best knowledge a man may 
have received of his duties&#59; and of him who has received much 
light&#44; much virtue&#44; according to his means&#44; will be asked&#59; and 
of the less instructed and less gifted less will be required. &#8212; It 
is&#44; therefore&#44; in the many small and apparently unimportant 
precepts which our law contains&#44; that we discover the great 
wisdom of its institution&#44; since the great acts are unattainable 
by most&#44; but the minor observances are within the reach of all. 



O&#34;.

But unfortunately&#44; although we have so many ways to make 
our Father graciously pleased with our conduct&#44; too many hours 
pass away&#44; even in the life of the best&#44; without an especial regard 
to the holy dictates of religion &#59; too much time is spent in 
worldly occupation&#59; too much leisure is devoted to foolish amuse&#8211; 
ment&#44; so that with many the idea of self&#8211;improvement is hardly 
ever entertained. Again&#44; success in life very often calls forth 
all the latent germs of pride and self&#8211;sufficiency&#44; places before 
its victim the greatest notion of his own greatness&#44; and excludes 
all thoughts of superiority even in his Maker. &#8212; And escapes 
from dangers too&#44; are then but another incentive to vauntin 
as though success in one&#39;s undertakings and escapes from diffi 
culties are the fruits and the necessary consequences of human 
foresight and of a mortal&#39;s exertions &#33; &#8212; And if a man has those 
ideas of pride and obstinacy once engrafted on his mind&#44; he 
will step carelessly&#44; as it were&#44; over the course of life&#44; and heed&#8211; 
less of false paths&#44; will hurry on to the goal of his existence&#44; 
regardless if he has missed the aim of his existence or not. &#8212; 
The reason is obvious&#59; he has confidence in his good intentions 
and prudence&#44; and as he regards not what others say or think&#44; 
he must remain unimproved or perhaps retrograde&#44; hourly&#44; 
trom the point of&#8211; eminence he may have attained &#59; and every 
one at last must discover&#44; that the man&#44; whom during the bril&#8211; 
liancy of a successful career we were apt to regard as wise and 
superior&#44; has ultimately left us no reason to desire&#44; that we 
might be like him. For though his actions may have savoured 
of earthly wisdom&#44; and apparently gilded his very words with 
a specious reasonableness : we will&#44; upon closer investigation&#44; 
discover&#44; that he has been the prey of ambition&#44; and been tor&#8211; 
mented by insatiable desires at those very moments&#44; when his 
outward appearance denoted nothing but calmness to the care&#8211; 
less beholder. &#8212; But religion was bestowed upon us&#44; that we 
might watch ourselves &#59; and besides that we should endeavour 
to be free from the blame of the wise and the good&#44; we should 
also be able to hold up the mirror of God&#44; his holy law&#44; to our 
own souls&#44; and thereby discover&#44; if it be all right within&#44; if all 
our deeds can be as well defended upon true and solid grounds&#44; 
as they may seem right to others. The oftener now we insti&#8211; 
tute this inquiry&#44; the oftener we take this view into our natures&#44; 

    <pb n="264"/>

264 THE INSTITUTION OF SACRIFICES. 

the more apt we must be&#44; of necessity&#44; to discover the errors 
we may have committed&#44; and rectify them. &#8212; Now the greatest 
instruments we have to accomplish this change in our senti&#8211; 
ments&#44; are regret and gratitude &#59; for the former will teach us&#44; 
that there is something unworthy in offending &#59; and the latter&#44; 
that benefits received demand some return on our part. It is 
to these considerations&#44; that we can refer the entire system and 
arrangement of the sacrifices&#44; which we were commanded to 
bring to the temple of God on certain occasions. &#8212; We read in 
Leviticus v. 5 : 

&#34; And it shall come to pass&#44; when he discovers the sin he has commit&#8211; 
ted by doing any one of these&#44; he shall confess the sin he has done &#59; and 
bring his offering to the Lord for the sin he has sinned.&#34; 

In this announcement of the institution of the offering for 
guilt&#44; we are also&#44; at once&#44; shown the object of the ordinance. 
&#34; And he shall confess the sin he has done &#59;&#34; not with careless 
inattention shall man presenthimself before the altar &#8212; not with 
an outward present&#44; but inward obstinacy dare he approach &#59; &#8212; 
no &#59; the first step is&#44; he must confess his sins &#33; Not before a 
man is he to relate the category of his misdeeds &#59; not clothe 
himself with sackcloth &#40;although both may be at times useful&#44; 
when one is done to obtain advice&#44; and the other to promote 
contrition) &#8212; he need not exhibit his feelings to the eyes of 
men as fallible as himself&#59; but before his God he shall pour 
out his heart&#44; to the Almighty he must tell what the greatness 
of his evil has been &#59; for to Him he cannot offer extenuations 
of his conduct&#44; nor can he endeavour to conceal the smallest 
minutia even of all his thoughts. Having thus fortified himself in 
regret he shall bring his offering&#44; an animal free from fault&#44; a 
bird&#44; or even a handful of flour&#44; if this be all his means can 
afford&#44; to the priest&#44; and have it sacrificed according to the dic&#8211; 
tates of the law in atonement for the wrong he has done. &#8212; Let 
us for a moment advert to the solemnity of the occasion. A 
sinner&#39;s own reflections or the admonitions of his fellow&#8211;beings&#44; 
have awakened in him a consciousness of the wrong with 

    <pb n="265"/>

THE INSTITUTION OF SACRIFICES. 265 

which he has burdened his soul. Remorse seizes him &#8212; day 
and night he is agitated by the consciousness of the nothing&#8211; 
ness of his imagined exalted station &#8212; and the rest that is 
denied him&#44; when he reflects upon the oppression the labourer&#44; 
the orphan&#44; the Avidow&#44; and the stranger have received at his 
guilty hands&#44; he now seeks to find in the religion which he 
has hitherto neglected. He reads the Word&#44; and he is told&#44; 
that confession&#44; restitution&#44; and amendment are the means of 
forgiveness &#59; and behold him then pouring out his anguished 
spirit in sincere prayer &#59; again he visits the humble roof of the 
labourer&#44; and gives him the wages which he has unlawfully 
detained from him &#59; he shares the riches which he enjoys&#44; with 
the widow and the orphan he has oppressed &#59; and thus pre&#8211; 
pared&#44; he leads to the courts of God his sin&#8211;offering. Again&#44; 
the fire is kindled upon the altar &#59; the offerer lays his hand 
upon the head of the victim&#44; and while its blood is spilt&#44; he 
imagines : &#34; Thus did I deserve to die for my crimes &#59; but the 
Merciful One has given me an opportunity to regain the happi&#8211; 
ness I have lost by means of the sacrifice which He receives at 
my hands.&#34; The song is chaunted by the singers of the tem&#8211; 
ple&#44; the priest arranges the fat upon the altar&#44; and the multitude 
rejoice at the return of another member to the fraternity of the 
pious &#59; but this is nothing compared to the new affection for 
himself&#44; his God&#44; and the law awakened in the mind of the 
offerer&#44; who with a holy zeal newly rekindled&#44; with love for 
mankind again revived in him&#44; now returns home&#44; a more 
cheerful and more contented man&#44; a new blessing to his chil&#8211; 
dren and an example for others to do likewise&#44; and regain like 
him the happiness which haply their folly has snatched from 
their grasp. 

If regret can have this beneficial influence upon man&#44; the 
other principle&#44; which has been mentioned&#44; gratitude&#44; can and 
should have a similar effect. &#8212; Man has tilled the field&#44; and 
entrusted his seed to the fertile bosom of the earth. He has com&#8211; 
pleted his share of the task&#44; for producing the bread which is 
to nourish him. But what is his labour&#44; if the Lord sendeth 
not the rain and the dew to fertilize the ground &#63; Or&#44; if this 
blessing should come down too abundantly&#44; where is the hus&#8211; 
bandman to obtain the blessed light of the sun to ripen his

fruit &#63; But it is our Protector in heaven&#44; who tempereth sun&#8211; 
shine with rain&#44; and thereby bestows sustenance to the expect&#8211; 
ing children of man &#59; for through his means the fields are 
clothed with verdure &#8212; through his blessing the grain is filled 
with nutritious matter &#8212; and by his provident care the animals 
of the field are clothed with fatness. &#8212; The labourer seeing all 
his endeavours blessed&#44; with a cheerful heart follows the richly 
loaded wagons that bear home the abundance of food which he 
is enabled to lay up for the winter&#39;s store &#59; and having finished 
his annual task&#44; he cannot help reflecting how much he owes to 
God&#44; how utterly useless would his toil have been&#44; if his hum&#8211; 
ble means had not been assisted from a Superior Source. &#8212; The 
festivals of the Lord approach&#44; and they who fear Him hasten 
to the temple&#44; and there bring their peace&#8211;oflferings &#8212; oflered 
through the exuberance of grateful feelings which animate 
them : and one excites the other to deserve henceforward&#44; yet 
oftener&#44; and still greater benefits from the Giver of all good &#33; 

Led by love for riches&#44; or the desire to see foreign lands&#44; 
behold the adventurous one traversing pathless deserts&#44; and 
braving the dangers of the waterless Avilderness. In the midst 
of thirst and hunger&#44; nothing but degtruction seems to await 
him : and even the hope of God&#39;s assistance is almost wrenched 
from him by silent despair. But lo &#33; amidst desolation the 
mercy of the Almighty is displayed&#44; and the exhausted travel&#8211; 
ler reaches his own loved home &#59; and publicly he now declares 
the mercy which has been vouchsafed him &#59; he brings his sacri&#8211; 
fice of tranksgiving to the temple&#44; and whilst narrating to the &#39; 
assembled guests the unmerited favours he has received&#44; he 
resolves to be for the future more obedient to the precepts of 
God&#44; which are more refreshing to the afflicted soul&#44; than the 
spring of pure water in the wilderness is to the tongue of 
man. &#8212; He also&#44; who had been thrown on the bed of sickness &#59; 
and he&#44; who had languished in prison&#44; separated for his crimes&#44; 
or by the malice of enemies from his kindred and friends &#59; as 
also he&#44; who had seen the glories of the Creator displayed upon 
the vast and mighty ocean&#44; &#8212; all in fact&#44; who had been snatched 
from imminent danger&#44; were bound to bring&#44; in acknowledg&#8211; 
ment of their debt of gratitude&#44; a present to the sanctuary 
of God&#44; and publicly declare the goodness which had been 

    <pb n="267"/>

THE INSTITUTION OF SACRIFICES. 267 

bestowed on them. &#8212; These&#44; briefly&#44; were the objects of the 
sacrifices. They were not intended to induce people to get 
rid of their sins by killing a guiltless animal &#59; no such senseless 
idea lays at the foundation of this part of the law. As I have 
said : for sins committed unwittingly and heedlessly&#44; for 
violence done to the property of another&#44; which could not be 
considered as theft&#44; the sin and trespass&#8211;offerings were insti&#8211; 
tuted &#59; but sincere repentance and reparation of the evil done 
were imperiously demanded bef&#40;3re the sacrifice could be 
received. Of the offerings dictated by gratitude nothing more 
need be said in illustration than has been mentioned already&#44; 
since their good tendency must be apparent to any one that 
seriously thinks. &#8212; That bloody sacrifices are expedient cannot 
be denied &#59; for since we are permitted to&#44; and daily do&#44; make use 
of animals for food&#44; is it not entirely consonant with reason to 
devote them also to the service of Heaven&#44; at the same time&#44; 
that we make use of them for ourselves &#63; And as has been said 
already&#44; it was not the mere sacrifice&#44; but the idea which 
accompanied it&#44; which could render it&#44; according to our law&#44; 
an acceptable offering. &#8212; But&#44; brethren&#44; since the temple has 
been laid waste by our adversaries&#44; the sacrifices have ceased&#44; 
for only on the site of the temple can they be brought &#59; no 
longer the consecrated priest administers the burnt&#8211;offerings&#44; 
and the song of the Levite is hushed in the ruined halls of the 
holy temple. &#8212; But let it not be said&#44; that because the outward 
symbols have ceased to be&#44; that regret and gratitude have no 
longer their full influence on our hearts &#33; No&#44; let us&#44; each and 
all&#44; demonstrate by the careful attention we pay to our conduct 
that we feel poignant sorrow when we have transgressed &#59; and 
that for every act of grace we are grateful &#59; and that we are 
fearful of offending and ready to obey our everkind Father. 
If thus we are animated&#44; our life&#44; be it ever so humble&#44; must be 
a series of blessings to ourselves&#44; and to all around us &#59; and if 
we then even occasionally transgress &#40;since no man is perfect) 
we are assured&#44; that the forgiveness which we crave will not 
be denied to our prayers. &#8212; And if&#44; then&#44; no distinction await 
us on earth &#8212; if the selfish of the world will not listen to our 
advice &#8212; if even we see the wicked lord it as masters : we 
should submit to this dispensation with patience and cheerful&#8211;

ness&#44; and reflect that not this life is the entire time which our 
immortal soul is destined to endure. &#8212; And then again&#44; if we 
but reflect&#44; how short a time man can enjoy all sublunary 
good &#8212; howmany times the greatest earthly pleasures are inter&#8211; 
rupted by sorrow &#8212; and how little security there is in their 
possession &#8212; and besides how soon the man&#44; who is praised 
to&#8211;day by the public&#44; is despised and sunk in oblivion &#8212; and how 
futile all fame is : we must be easily reconciled to the humble 
lot&#44; which we&#44; in common&#34; with the immense number of those 
unknown to fame and riches&#44; have received as our sphere of 
action. For the time will come&#44; when the glory of the great 
must vanish &#8212; when the wisdom of the wise will cease &#8212; when 
the power of the rulers will be broken : when they&#44; together 
with their humblest menials&#44; must all appear before the impartial 
Judge&#44; before whom neither glory&#44; nor wisdom&#44; nor power will 
be taken as an excuse for righteousness outraged or virtue 
slighted &#59; and where the beggar will be preferred&#44; provided his 
life has been virtuous and useful&#44; according to his means. &#8212; Let 
it be therefore our constant study&#44; to train our hearts to obe&#8211; 
dience&#44; and let us never neglect to listen to the holy m.onitors&#44; 
which God has planted within us &#8212; regret and gratitude &#59; but 
if we listen to their admonition&#44; and offer a contrite spirit to 
our Maker&#44; we may be assured&#44; that our sins will be for&#8211; 
given&#44; and that we shall be graciously received by Him&#44; who 
promised through his prophet&#44; that the time shall come&#44; when 
the offering of Judah and Jerusalem shall be as acceptable to 
Him as in times of old. May this be his will&#44; and may our 
eyes speedily see the accomplishment. Amen.

DISCOURSE XXVI. 

THE SINFULNESS OF PRIDE. 

God of everlasting&#33; teach us thy ways and fill our hearts 
with knowledge of Thee and thy wonderful works &#59; so that 
adoration of Thee may follow the consciousness in us of thy 
might and wisdom. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

You have so often been struck with the remarkable fact&#44; that 
persons who to all appearance have the same opportunity of 
forming an opinion&#44; will take views so entirely varying of the 
same subject&#59; and that others&#44; apparently possessed of the same 
talents have acquired tastes so very differing&#44; and pursue at 
times such opposite and contradictory lines of conduct&#44; as 
almost to baffle and surprise you. But upon a closer investiga&#8211; 
tion of the springs of action&#44; we shall discover the reason of 
the first mentioned case to be&#44; that those who are to form a 
judgment&#44; have not been all taught alike&#44; and do not possess 
the same degree of information &#59; and of the second&#44; that those 
equally endowed with reasoning powers do not regard things 
from the same point of view&#59; and consequently seeing&#44; as it 
were&#44; the moral world from different positions&#44; they each form 
a different idea of the objects placed within their intellectual 
horizon. This also will account for the difference discoverable 
in the degi&#8211;ees of moral improvement or piety&#44; which we meet 
with amongst the children of man. If all were equally well 
informed&#44; and if all would give their mind the same direction&#44; 
there would be a perfect unanimity of opinion amongst all 
men. There would then be no different sects&#44; and every one 
of the universal religion would act as the most distant from 
him in time or space could do. Because&#44; since actions are in 
sound minds the results of thought&#44; and since thought is the 
effect of information : all consequences of thought or informa&#8211; 
tion would in this case be the same&#44; since the source of them 

23&#42; 

    <pb n="270"/>

270 THE SINFULNESS OF PRIDE. 

would then be of equal extent and equal usefulness in all 
thinking beings &#59; that is to say&#44; men would all be virtuous 
alike&#44; because they must then be acting from an equal degree 
of knowledge&#44; and from an application of this knowledge to 
the same purposes. &#8212; Now&#44; although it is true that the thoughts 
of men cannot be seen&#44; still&#44; as their effects are visible&#44; we can 
determine almost to a certainty the current of ideas in most 
persons &#59; for&#44; since actions are bad or good&#44; useful or injurious&#44; 
we may safely conclude&#44; that the thoughts of the agents also 
are of the same nature &#59; and consequently that those who act 
well are governed by good thoughts&#44; and the doers of evil are 
moved by a bad train of thinking. 

This view brings us at once to the reflection&#44; that if we wish 
to cultivate the duties of religion&#44; it is of the utmost import&#8211; 
ance to us to know&#44; which train of thought is the promoter of 
religious conduct&#44; and which is calculated to abstract us from a 
pious life. Let me premise&#44; that no reflections in ourselves 
and admonitions from others&#44; although they may at first sight 
appear to conduce to what is commonly termed moral improve&#8211; 
ment only&#44; can be considered as not properly belonging to 
practical religious instruction : if their tendency is to improve 
the mind&#44; and to fertilize it for the reception of the seed&#44; which 
is to be derived much better from the oracles of God them&#8211; 
selves&#44; when aided by previous information and attentive study&#44; 
than by lectures and exhortations from even the most gifted. 
These should&#44; therefore&#44; be chiefly directed to remove every 
objection to our holy religion&#44; with which impiety and igno&#8211; 
rance may endeavour to entrap tlie unwary&#44; or which self&#8211;in&#8211; 
terest or passion may frame as excuses to lull a disturbed 
conscience into security. To say something very surprising&#44; 
or to advance new ideas on a subject of the nature of inmiuta&#8211; 
ble religion&#44; would be evidently improper&#44; even if it were 
possible since any thing not before heard of&#44; or not previously 
acquiesced in&#44; must be an innovation attempted to be engrafted 
on the rule of faith&#44; and which would at once stamp doctrines 
thus advanced with the seal of falsehood &#59; and to treat of cere&#8211; 
monies and laws in a lecture&#44; which is to be heard but once&#44; 
can also have no very beneficial tendency&#44; since nothing is easier&#44; 
than that the hearers may not understand very accurately the 

    <pb n="271"/>

THE SINFULNESS OF PRIDE. 271 

instructions of the speaker&#44; or may recollect them but imper&#8211; 
fectly. &#8212; All&#44; therefore&#44; which remains properly as the province 
of oral and public instruction&#44; is to endeavour by rational and 
clear expositions of the nature of religion to call the attention 
of the hearers to the subject&#44; and to answer those objections 
which a person may have made himself or heard made by 
others&#44; or even those which may never have yet been urged &#59; 
and lastly&#44; to place in a clear light the great and overwhelming 
reasonableness which the law has beyond any emanations of a 
mortal&#39;s wisdom &#59; and thus endeavour to induce others to study 
with more diligence&#44; and with a mind better prepared for such 
a study&#44; the Scriptures of the Lord. It is not&#44; believe me&#44; 
brethren&#44; from ignorance that we sin&#44; although we may at 
times flatter our vanity with so silly an excuse&#44; as from want of 
proper training. It is true&#44; we may not know every particular 
iota of religious duties&#59; it may be that we are not fully aware 
of the extent of the sacrifices demanded of us&#44; but we may&#44; 
nevertheless&#44; avoid even in these instances doing unconsciously 
wrong&#44; if we keep within the limits of what is allowed us&#44; and 
not assume for ourselves too much liberty of range in departing 
from what many of us may perhaps think the too minute ob&#8211; 
servances of the ignorant and superstitious of a former age. 
We should be careful not to disregard all&#44; because we cannot 
respect all&#59; and upon the whole&#44; rather mistrust our judgment 
than our information&#44; and rather do many an unimportant 
action&#44; than by too great stickling for the reason of all omit 
doing that which may be very important&#44; although we may not 
so conceive it. 

With these general admonitions prefaced&#44; let us recur to the 
subject which I first introduced for this day&#39;s reflection. &#8212; I said&#44; 
that it is absolutely necessary for the religious man to have a 
good train of thoughts and feelings as the basis of his actions&#59; 
for without this first requisite&#44; virtue is but another name for 
hypocrisy&#44; and piety but the cloak of wickedness. &#8212; On this 
subject&#44; as well as on every other connected with our moral 
improvement&#44; we find wholesome advice in the holy Scrip&#8211; 
tures&#44; and upon referring to them&#44; we will at all times find the 
best guide we can desire to lead us through life. &#8212; Now&#44; of all 
the good habits which are commended in the Bible&#44; meekness 

    <pb n="272"/>

is the most prominent&#44; and pride&#44; on the other hand&#44; is always 
held up as that species of feeling we should above all endeavour 
to avoid. &#8212; We read in the book of Proverbs xvi&#44; 4 : 

&#34; All pride is an abomination of the Lord.&#34; 

If then&#44; we wish not to deserve the displeasure of our God&#44; 
we should strive to eradicate this enemy of our improvement&#44; 
this pride&#44; from our hearts&#44; and never suffer it to obtain the 
dominion over our feelings. &#8212; &#34; But why is pride so destruc&#8211; 
tive&#63; why is religion incompatible with arrogance&#63;&#34; &#8212; We 
answer : When God created men. He ordained to them the 
same origin and the same felicity. It was through sin that 
they forfeited this felicity&#44; and then a uniform termination of 
life&#44; or death of the body&#44; was decreed against all descendants 
of the first sinners. &#8212; In thus far&#44; then&#44; no man has a right to 
assume any superiority over another&#59; and humility&#44; which is 
the proper knowledge of one&#39;s self&#44; will lead its possessor to 
regard all men as brothers&#44; who are&#44; if even dependent upon 
him&#44; nevertheless&#44; of the same beginning&#44; and a similar ending. 
But pride will lead a man to forget that his beginning is the 
same with that of the most degraded&#44; and that the same fate 
awaits him&#44; which is appointed for all the descendants of Adam. 
Let us now rapidly follow the proud man through his career&#44; and 
see what this forgetfulness will lead to. &#8212; In childhood&#44; alas &#33; 
pride often shows itself already&#44; and the infant&#44; corrupted by flat&#8211; 
tery&#44; will spurn the caresses of his nurse as though the touch of 
her&#44; by whose care his life has perhaps been prolonged&#44; were con&#8211; 
taminating to him&#44; one&#44; who is descended from a noble line of an&#8211; 
cestry&#44; noble perhaps in their being distinguished for the perse&#8211; 
verance with which they indulged in foolish pleasures&#44; and their 
subserviency to unjust power. Ridiculous as the exhibition of 
pride is at so early an age&#44; and obvious as the folly thereof is 
to every beholder: children are too often countenanced by their 
parents in such a line of conduct&#44; for they encourage very 
often rather than check this early growth of presumption. &#8212; In 
boyhood the seeds of pride continue to produce their legitimate 
fruit&#44; and the once petulant child shows all the perverseness of 

    <pb n="273"/>

THE SINFULNESS OF PRIDE. 273 

the overbearing boy&#59; and the advice of the teacher is received 
with a frown &#59; his instruction is regarded as the proper appen&#8211; 
dage of the pedagogue&#44; which the noble and rich scholar need 
not acquire&#59; and thus the ideas of self&#8211;sufficiency&#44; early im&#8211; 
bibed&#44; are still stronger confirmed&#44; and the boy attains the age 
of youth with a heart scoffing at all that are imagined inferior 
to the greatness of this proud stripling&#44; and with a mind not 
sufficiently&#44; or perhaps altogether unprepared to contend with 
the temptations which beset the path of life. He now seeks 
the gaieties and amusements which he conceives to be the 
proper province of his exalted rank &#59; habit has already taught 
him to regard wealth and fictitious greatness as the chief glories 
of life &#59; and he&#44; therefore&#44; now utterly abhors those whose 
means or opportunities allow them not to partake of the same 
enjoyments&#59; and he will hate those who may be above him in 
those accomplishments&#44; trifling elegancies&#44; and wealth which he 
so much adores. &#8212; He now seeks to outstrip all in the search of 
refined fooleries&#44; he stops short at no obstacles&#44; and he toils 
and watches in these endeavours much more than the philan&#8211; 
thropist in his exertions. &#8212; Vice too will be courted&#44; provided 
it can bring the perpetrator a name of a dashing&#44; bold fellow&#59; 
and the greater the extravagance&#44; and yea&#44; the greater the 
meanness of the deed&#44; the greater will he conceive to be the 
glory he has earned by his labours. All this time admonition 
dares not to be addressed to his sensitive ears &#59; he is too wise in 
his own conceit&#44; too much trusting to his own wild judgment. 
And if even something of that careless generosity&#44; which men of 
pleasure sometimes possess&#44; should occasionally be displayed&#44; 
some heroic devotion to the interest of mankind&#44; some bold 
exposure to danger to save the life of a perishing fellow&#8211;being: 
we should&#44; nevertheless&#44; not imagine that the exhibition of 
these occasional virtues are the signs of a reformation or legiti&#8211; 
mate fruits of the system our proud voluptuary pursues. Nei&#8211; 
ther is the case. But the most depraved has a human heart&#44; his 
soul is of the same pure origin as that of the most pious&#44; and 
no course of vice can ever entirely destroy the sacred principle 
of righteousness &#59; and thus a man like the one we are speaking 
of may be radically bad&#44; and practise at times acts of great 
devotion to the interests of suffisring mankind&#44; without reform&#8211; 

    <pb n="274"/>

274 THE SINFULNESS OF PRIDE. 

ing&#44; and despite of his otherwise wicked course. &#8212; Besides&#44; 
occasional goodness will give a further zest to pleasures&#44; which 
will be more enjoyed&#44; because of a temporary interruption. &#8212; 
But pleasure must sooner or later become intolerable&#44; as the 
sole pursuit of any one but little removed above the idiot &#59; 
and the proud devotee of worldly enjoyment&#44; therefore&#44; 
will occasionally seek some other occupation. Suppose 
him now in a high office&#44; see him honoured by his country 
on account of the influence which his wealth and rank natu&#8211; 
rally confer upon him &#59; and assume again&#44; which is highly 
probable&#44; that his occupation has been changed without any 
improvement in the unhealth)&#39;&#34; state of his neglected mind. 
He is merged in multifarious employments&#44; and to his heart&#39;s 
delight he can tyrannize over some others besides his own 
personal dependants. They who have to ask favours of the 
official are received with haughty scorn &#59; and wo to those who 
have not carefully studied his disposition&#44; if upon him should 
depend their success or failure. He will endeavour to crush 
those who have not sufficiently valued his importance &#59; and the 
greater the misfortune he can cause the greater will be his de&#8211; 
light&#44; particularly if moroseness and disappointment should 
have followed in the wake of the indulgencies of pleasure&#44; and 
the acquisition of power. &#8212; Or place him at the head of national 
affiiirs&#44; and uncontrolled by the will of others &#59; how terrible 
will then be the effects of pi&#39;ide&#44; and how soon will misery 
follow the train of the tyrant&#44; who may conceive his dignity 
injured by the insolence of any of his subjects &#33; You must 
admit him the best musician&#44; the best gladiator&#44; or the best of 
horse&#8211;racers&#44; or your life is in danger &#59; you must yield your 
paternal inheritance to swell his pleasure&#8211;gardens&#44; or else death 
awaits you &#59; and if you even should commit the offence beyond 
the limits of his dominions he will hire the assassin&#39;s steel to 
remove the hated object from the earth. No entreaty&#44; no 
reasonable exposition of the madness of such proceedings can 
convince one so much raised in his own conceit above the 
opinion of others &#59; and not till a natural death stares him in the 
face&#44; or till perhaps he receives a fatal blow from the dagger of 
some wretch rendered desperate by oppression&#44; will the tyrant 
be led to a consciousness of his folly&#44; which might have been 

    <pb n="275"/>

done a thousand times&#44; if he had not been blinded by pride. If 

It be urged that examples like the foregoing are too rare&#44; and 
too remote for the attainment of persons in the ordinary cir&#8211; 
cumstances of life: it would nevertheless be perfectly just to 
exhibit the natural consequences of a passion&#44; which when car&#8211; 
ried out to its full extent can lead to such deplorable results. But 
we need not go so far&#44; since unfortunately the evil effects of 
pride are too abundant in all relations of our earthly exist&#8211; 
ence. Many a man has been devoted to a righteous life&#44; whilst 
he toiled from day to day to obtain food for himself and his 
family. A sudden&#44; or even gradual&#44; change of circumstances 
places him in a more elevated situation &#59; wealth pours into his 
coffers&#44; and he sees himself regarded for the sake of his riches 
by those whom he at one time conceived so much above him. 
He is pleased with himself&#44; and he says : &#34;My industry&#44; my 
ingenuity&#44; and my prudence&#44; have caused all this&#59;&#34; and in 
consequence of this favourable judgment of his own powers he 
begins to despise his former associates&#44; and learns by degrees 
to forget his formerly entertained opinions. He is ashamed of 
his family connections&#44; they are now too humble to be acknow&#8211; 
ledged by him&#59; and his new&#8211;born importance seeks other 
objects of action than deeds of piety. For why should he&#44; the 
wise&#44; the rich&#44; the great&#44; abide by those rules which the foolish&#44; 
the poor&#44; the humble follow &#63; At first he begins by omitting 
minor observances&#44; but ultimately the chief commandments too 
find no longer obedience in him&#44; and he appears to one who 
knew him in poverty&#44; as an entirely changed man. And what 
changed him what caused him to forget his old friends&#63; what 
induced him to forsake his God &#63; It is not the acquisition of 
riches&#44; but the counsel of overweaning pride which caused all 
this. &#8212; Another man has been used to riches&#44; ease&#44; and affluence &#59; 
but as all earthly things are changeable&#44; so he too meets with a 
change in his circumstances&#44; and the wealth&#44; which he thought 
too great to be dissipated by any event whatever&#44; takes wing&#44; 
as it were&#44; and leaves him in penury. He had always&#44; whilst 
rich&#44; thought himself above the working classes&#44; of a somewhat 
superior clay to those who toil for a living&#59; and shall he 
descend to their level &#63; no&#44; he cannot do this &#59; idleness will 
not support him&#44; so he resorts to beggary&#44; swindling&#44; and per&#8211;

haps highway robbery &#59; and when confined at last in a dungeon 
for his trespasses&#44; he mourns over the weakness which he 
would not conquer&#44; and which prevented him from being a 
hard&#8211;working but honest member of society. 

Another&#44; again&#44; has descended into the depth of learning&#44; he 
has searched into the mysteries of creation&#44; has ascended in his 
imagination to the pinnacles of the starry heaven&#44; and his re&#8211; 
searches have been admired by friends and strangers. No 
longer can he&#44; who once moralized over the ambition of man&#8211; 
kind and ridiculed their vain pursuits&#44; resist the allurements of 
pride &#59; he finds in himself a soul of nobler materials&#44; and the 
admiration which is bestowed on him he conceives to be but 
a poor return for the great benefits which his discoveries have 
conferred on the world. He forgets his mortality &#59; he strives 
to establish a system of morals of his own &#59; he no longer needs 
the law of Moses to guide him who is so much wiser than the 
great king of Israel &#59; and the support of revelation being once 
taken from under his feet he tumbles headlong into the 
abyss of ruin&#44; and in sudden leaps he hastens down to the gulph 
of destruction&#44; and herds there with the foolish and the proud 
of all classes&#44; a warning monument of the weakness of unsup&#8211; 
ported human intellect&#44; and the unsubstantiality of a mortal&#39;s 
greatness &#59; and when his eye catches a glimpse of death&#44; he 
perhaps then feels the full&#42; effects of a wise man&#39;s folly &#59; he calls 
upon a mortal to prolong his life&#44; he will not believe that he 
must at length die&#44; and leave his name behind him as a curse 
and by&#8211;word&#44; and his memory to be despised by those whom 
his sophistry dragged along with him into the stream of unbe&#8211; 
lief and perdition. &#8212; Therefore&#44; says the Bible : &#34; Every one 
proud of heart Ts an abomination to the Lord.&#34; And no matter 
how pride is exhibited&#44; if it be by the king on his throne or 
the lazy mendicant in the street&#44; it is alike an abomination. 
And if a man but reflects on the great glory of God&#44; on his 
omnipotent power&#44; on his all&#8211;searching wisdom : he must 
become ashamed at setting up for himself claims of superior 
excellence. Whatever of greatness&#44; ease&#44; and wisdom is vouch&#8211; 
safed to us&#44; is a gift&#44; or rather a loan&#44; to be demanded back at 
the pleasure of God&#44; For our greatness at its very acme is 
often rendered to nought &#59; our ease may be momentarily dis&#8211;

turbed by pain &#59; and the very excess of wisdom may produce 
aberration of intellect. And God has given us in the Bible so 
many instances of the punishment of the arrogant&#44; and besides&#44; 
daily experience teaches us the lessons of Scripture over and 
over again : that nothing but wilful blindness can prevent us 
from benefitting by those lessons. The Bible speaks of a Pha&#8211; 
raoh and of a Sanherib&#44; kings&#44; who in their might almost 
thought themselves gods and unconquerable &#59; but one was 
drowned in the Red Sea&#44; and the other returned from an 
attempted conquest a fugitive to his own land. &#8212; Then we have 
the example of a Haman&#44; who for the sake of offended pride 
strove to exterminate the descendants of Jacob &#59; and a Korah&#44; 
who wanted to supplant the pious Moses : but one was removed 
by a supernatural punishment&#59; the other expired on the gibbet&#44; 
which he had prepared for the righteous Mordecai &#33; Then we 
read of the proud Nabal&#44; who in private life was ungrateful 
from pride &#59; and God removed him&#44; so as not to be a stumbling 
block to others. But what needs it to multiply examples to 
prove both the dangerous tendencies and the terrible conse&#8211; 
quences of pride and arrogance &#63; &#8212; Parents&#44; therefore&#44; you who 
would delight in the welfai&#8211;e of your children&#44; as you value 
your and their peace&#44; watch with the utmost solicitude the early 
approach of this vice. Check it as soon as it manifests itself &#59; 
and by your encouraging the humble and lowly to enter your 
dwellings on terms of ease and good fellowship&#44; if they are 
good and deserving : teach them early&#44; that those not as much 
favoured with worldly gifts are nevertheless of the same class of 
beings&#44; and deserving of the same regard as the wealthy. &#8212; 
Above all&#44; allow them never to tyrannize over domestics&#44; for a 
small beginning though it may be&#44; it may have a terrible ending. 
&#8212; Youths and maidens&#44; you who have just entered life&#39;s busy 
scenes&#44; beware of the snare that lies hidden at your feet. If 
you feel your station as something so very delightful&#44; and your 
society as something superior to others : check at once the pre&#8211; 
sumption which is almost sure to follow such ideas&#44; and oh&#44; 
believe not that the garment makes the man&#44; or that fashionable 
pursuits exalt you above him who has no time to devote to such 
employments &#33; &#8212; Husbands and wives&#44; ye too must guard your 
hearts &#33; If success has crowned your exertions&#44; if your children

278 THE SINFULNESS OF PRIDE. 

grow up around you in health and beauty&#44; imagine not that 
your exertions were anything else than the means in the hands 
of God to bestow blessings upon you. Humble&#44; therefore&#44; 
your hearts to the Giver of all&#44; that He may continue to you 
his goodness&#44; and instruct your children to revere Him&#44; the 
Father of all &#33; &#8212; And thou too&#44; man of learning&#44; bend thy ear 
to the admonition of God &#33; Thou hast received wisdom above 
thy fellow&#8211;men&#44; much more has been made known to thee than 
to others &#59; strive therefore too to glorify the name of thy Bene&#8211; 
factor&#59; instruct the ignorant in his law&#44; and lead all to adore 
our God&#44; who has made all with so much wisdom &#33; &#8212; If&#44; brethren&#44; 
we always think in this manner&#44; if we constantly guard the 
avenues of our hearts against the approach of pride : we may 
rest assured that we shall not soon be led into the snares of sin&#59; 
for wdien we humbly seek to know God and his ways&#44; we must 
naturally be watchful over our conduct&#59; and if w&#34;e be rich then 
we will bear our fortune with humility &#59; and if poor we will 
cheerfully follow those pursuits by which we can maintain an 
honest name&#44; without in the first case being buoyed up by 
arrogance&#44; or in the other checked by pride. &#8212; And how lovely 
fruits must the law of God bear in the heart thus cultivated&#44; 
and how sweet will the harvest be when the labour of life has 
terminated &#33; &#34; The humble shall inherit the land&#44;&#34; says the 
Lord&#44; and to those who look upon themselves and all as the 
children of One God&#44; the law must always be dear&#44; and happi&#8211; 
ness and peace will crown their efforts much more than even 
their most excited hope dared to expect in this state of exist&#8211; 
ence &#33; 

God&#44; who lookest upon the contrite heart and humble 
spirit&#44; receive our prayer&#44; and guard us from all evil&#44; for the 
sake of thy holy name &#33; Amen.

God of glory&#44; to Thee we raise our eyes in hope of thy assist&#8211; 
ance : save us now&#44; from the evils to which our mortal 
career is subject &#59; and let the light of thy countenance shine 
unto us&#44; as Thou once didst unto our forefathers&#44; when Thou 
didst appear unto them in clouds of brightness&#44; and gavest them 
thy pure and holy law&#44; for their guidance unto happiness. May 
it now be thy will to protect us in our captivity&#44; and cause not 
thy holy name to be profaned among the nations&#44; and let not 
our enemies exult over our misfortunes&#44; lest they should say in 
the pride of their hearts : &#34; Where is their God &#63;&#34; But Thou&#44; 
our God&#44; wilt not sufler thy children to perish&#44; although they 
have sinned to Thee&#44; and Thou hast promised not to cast them 
off&#44; nor to abhor them utterly&#44; if even their transgressions 
should be manifold &#33; &#8212; have mercy upon the lonely sheep of 
Jacob&#44; and let thy chastisement be only directed to soften their 
hearts&#44; and to open their eyes to the evil of their way &#59; so that 
led by the paternal hand&#44; which Thou hast ever extended over 
them&#44; they may return unto Thee with repentance in their 
inward souls&#44; and become worthy of thy forgiveness&#44; and to be 
called again : &#34; You are the people of the Lord.&#34; Amen. 



Brethren 



Full often have we experienced the goodness of God. 
Already at the time when our ancestor Abraham was yet alone&#44; 
the star shining in the East&#44; and sending forth the rays of piety 
into a benighted world : did we experience in him&#44; our pro&#8211; 
genitor&#44; the kindness which the Lord bestoweth on his ser&#8211; 
vants. &#8212; You are all&#44; no doubt&#44; sufficiently familiar with the 
history of Abraham&#44; to understand me when I say&#44; that the 
approbation&#44; which was so miraculously vouchsafed to him was&#44; 
in all human probability&#44; the cause that the worship of God was

spread through the first preacher&#39;s means over a great portion 
of the primitive world. I do not wish to say&#44; that any other 
method would have been impossible &#59; for this would be cir&#8211; 
cumscribing the power of the Almighty within the range of cir&#8211; 
cumstances and casualties. But surely we may be permitted 
to believe that the grace given unto Abraham&#44; and the evident 
favour this great apostle of righteousness enjoyed from on high&#44; 
were&#44; as far as we can judge&#44; the best means of rivetting the 
attention of all mankind&#44; and therefore the best adapted to 
impress upon them&#44; how sweet it is to be a servant of the Being 
who had dealt so bountifully with his adorer. &#8212; Thus early 
chosen as the peculiar treasure of God&#44; we shall find no diminu&#8211; 
tion of kindness if we descend to later periods. &#8212; Isaac selected 
as a sacrifice&#44; to try the faith of his loving father&#44; and rescued 
by the messenger of Mercy&#44; was blessed by God&#44; and promised 
the assistance which his father had never found failing him in 
his hour of need. &#8212; Jacob fled from before the wrath of his bro&#8211; 
ther&#44; and wandered into a distant land for the safety he found 
not in his parental home. &#8212; And was he forsaken &#63; not in the 
least&#59; for even whilst reposing upon the hard rock&#44; he received 
comfort in a dream &#59; and the promise of God&#44; first made to 
Abraham and repeated to Isaac&#44; was renewed to him&#44; and he 
was assured&#44; that in his person and the persons of his descend&#8211; 
ants should the prophecies be fulfilled. &#8212; Refreshed by these 
marks of Supreme favour&#44; he served for many years&#44; as we 
read in the book of Genesis &#59; but even in servitude he saw suf&#8211; 
ficient grounds for thankfulness. A numerous ofispring grew 
up around him&#44; all like their father&#44; untainted by idolatry&#44; and 
undefiled by the abominations of the heathen &#33; &#8212; At length 
Jacob returned&#44; but not to enjoy the ease of life&#44; which his great 
acquired riches might perhaps have induced him to look for&#44; as 
almost certain &#59; for Providence had willed it&#44; that he should go 
into Egypt&#44; with his whole family&#44; there to become the great 
nation&#44; to whom the Lord would be God. Through the force 
of love Jacob was moved to wander thither in his old age&#59; 
and he and his sons all departed from this life in the land of the 
children of Ham&#44; fully impressed with the conviction&#44; that the 
time would come when the Lord would lead the Israelites out 
of that land&#44; into the inheritance which He had given unto

their ancestor&#44; when He made with him a covenant&#44; and com&#8211; 
manded him to walk hefore him and be perfect.&#34; &#8212; The time 
rolled on &#59; but the Egyptians had forgotten&#44; that they owed 
much gratitude to the Hebrew Joseph&#44; who by his Heaven&#8211; 
bestowed prudence&#44; had saved the land from the desolation of 
famine&#59; they weened that Israel would be dangerous to the 
peace of the state&#59; they imagined&#44; like tyrants of more modern 
times also have imagined&#44; that the Hebrew could have no 
communitv of interest with his fellow&#8211;citizens&#59; they therefore 
oppressed them with heavy labour&#44; and all manner of work in 
the field&#44; for the purpose of diminishing their number &#33; But the 
arm of the Lord interposed&#44; and the more the Israelites were 
oppressed&#44; the more they multiplied&#44; and the more they spread 
out. When at length the time of the redemption approached&#44; 
a prophet and messenger were chosen&#44; to apprise Mitzraim&#39;s 
king&#44; that it was the will of the Eternal God&#44; that he should dis&#8211; 
miss the Israelites from his service. Pharaoh refused to obey&#59; 
nay&#44; he increased the burden of the enslaved till even hope 
had fled from the heart of Jacob&#39;s children. But then it was 
that the fearful arm of the Lord was bared over the devoted 
land of Egypt&#44; till at length the oppressor relented&#44; and permit&#8211; 
ted&#44; under the weight of awful visitations&#44; to let the tribes of 
Yeshurun leave his land in triumph. &#8212; They thus went forth into 
the wilderness&#44; deyoted to God&#44; as the newly married bride is 
devoted to her husband&#44; and passed through the Red Sea&#44; 
secure from the pursuing host of the Egyptians&#44; who were sunk 
into the abyss&#44; through which the Israelites had passed in 
safety. &#8212; And when they wanted bread&#44; it was given them 
every morning &#59; and when they asked for water&#44; it flowed for 
them out of the flinty rock. &#8212; Soon after they were brought to 
the foot of Sinai&#44; to receive the law&#44; which was to instruct them 
in the way they were to go&#44; and the statutes and command&#8211; 
ments they were to observe. &#8212; Having in this manner the way 
of life revealed unto them&#44; it was to have been hoped&#44; that 
obedienee would have followed the knowledge of right&#59; but it 
was not so. Misguided by fear&#44; and yielding to inherited pre&#8211; 
judices&#44; they sacrificed to an idol&#44; and called it the god who had 
conducted them out of Egypt. The ungrateful nation now 
deserved to be exterminated &#59; but the Merciful withheld his

anger&#44; forgave their sin and destroyed not&#44; and poured not out 
all his wrath. &#8212; Again they sinned by murmuring against the 
promised land&#44; and for a second time was the decree of 
destruction revoked &#59; and by a wandering for forty years in 
the wilderness and the death of all those who had reached 
man&#39;s estate&#44; when they left Egypt&#44; the sin of ingratitude 
was expiated. They now entered the holy land&#44; under the 
guidance of Moses&#39;s disciple Joshua &#59; they drove out the former 
inhabitants&#44; who had offended God by their wickedness&#44; and 
dwelled in houses they had not built&#44; drank out of cisterns 
which they had not hewn&#44; and enjoyed all delightful products 
which they had not laid up themselves. &#8212; Here they might 
have lived a truly beloved people of God&#44; an admiration to all 
nations&#44; and a beacon&#8211;light to all inhabitants of the earth. &#8212; But 
they were led away by the free lives of the idolaters&#44; the yoke 
of obedience to divine commands was too grievous for them to 
bear&#44; and they stumbled upon the path of corruption. &#8212; But as 
they had been foretold&#44; the punishment denounced speedily 
overtook them&#44; and when oppressed by their enemies they soon 
discovered the difference between the effects of the service of 
Heaven and the results of subjection to men. &#8212; Whenever they 
repented&#44; however&#44; they were graciously received&#44; and were&#44; 
from time to time&#44; saved through means of the judges&#44; whom 
the Lord set up for them. &#8212; Thus elapsed many years&#44; and 
Israel was upon the whole happy under the divine rule by 
which they were governed &#59; till at length tired of the simplicity 
of their own pure government&#44; they required a king to rule 
over them. &#8212; In this foolish demand they were gratified&#44; and 
not alone this&#44; but a wise and virtuous man was selected as 
their chief&#44; who&#44; whilst he sincerely adhered to his piety&#44; was a 
blessing to the people. And when his conduct was such&#44; as no 
longer to entitle him to the favour of God and confidence of 
men&#44; he was told&#44; that his kingdom should not endure&#44; but 
should be given to a better man. This prince was David&#44; 
of eight sons of Jesse the youngest&#44; and at the time of his 
election the shepherd of his father&#39;s flock. To him&#44; the poet&#44; 
the warrior&#44; the patriot&#44; and the devoted servant of God&#44; was 
the care of the Hebrew nation confided&#44; and under him our 
kingdom rose to an indeed proud eminence. &#8212; It would be

foreign to our rapid sketch to dwell minutely upon David&#39;s 
history and to expatiate upon every single act of his life as 
given to us in the Bible. Suffice it to say&#44; that for the few 
sins committed under the peculiar circumstances in which he 
was placed&#44; he displayed on every occasion so humble a resig&#8211; 
nation&#44; so entire a reliance&#44; and so contrite a hope for forgive&#8211; 
ness upon God&#44; that we cannot help admiring that man&#44; who 
among kings of his time the greatest&#44; of conquerors the most 
renowned&#44; and of poets of all ages the sweetest and most sub&#8211; 
lime&#44; never forgot&#44; on any one occasion&#44; his accountability to a 
Supreme Being&#44; although true to human nature&#44; he occasionally 
transgressed&#44; aye&#44; severely transgressed &#59; and yet even here his 
example&#44; although not to be imitated in sinning&#44; is a guide to 
all sinners&#44; yea&#44; the greatest&#44; to return like him&#44; to be like 
him received&#44; under chastisement&#44; again into favour&#44; when 
their repentance and contrition are sincere and heartfelt. 

If Israel had under David&#39;s rule obtained martial power&#44; 
their moral glory was no less advanced by the splendid efforts 
of Solomon&#39;s reign. The temple dedicated to the all&#8211;pervading 
but unseen God&#44; rose noiselessly before the admiring world&#44; 
and the splendour of the arrangem.ents of the service&#44; the 
enchanting sublimity of the choral songs&#44; the thrill of the 
unrivalled music&#44; awakened the attention of even distant 
nations&#44; who now acknowledged&#44; that there was a God in 
Israel exalted above all power&#44; and more sublime than all 
thought&#44; and to whom it&#44; of right&#44; belonged&#44; that all should 
adore Him&#44; and bring sacrifices to his footstool. Whoever 
now had the feelings of a man loving the community of which 
he was part&#44; whosever bosom glowed at the glory of his own 
native land&#44; had at that period enough of cause for exultation&#44; 
and abundant reason to thank God for the many blessings 
bestowed on his people. 

Even after this period&#44; when the splendour of our nation 
was eclipsed&#44; when the kingdom&#44; divided into two warring par&#8211; 
ties&#44; became an easy prey for the invaders : we find&#44; neverthe&#8211; 
less&#44; the kindness of our Lord displayed&#44; who sufiered not 
Israel and Judah to be led into captivity at the same moment&#44; 
and permitted them not to be banished into one corner&#44; lest they 
might be cut off through the malice of their enemies. So that

what we at first might consider as a curse&#44; that is to say&#44; our 
entire dispersion over all the earth&#44; has in truth been our salva&#8211; 
tion. For when was it ever in the power of any one nation 
to harm us all at the same time &#63; where was ever that universal 
monarchy which comprised the whole Jewish nation in its 
boundaries&#63; The disposition to exterminate us has&#44; alas&#33; but 
seldom been wanting&#44; but&#44; thanks to our provident Father&#44; who 
supplied the balsam before the wound was yet inflicted&#44; the ex&#8211; 
ecution has ever been beyond the power and reach of any one 
people&#44; or of all nations combined. 

After the banishment consequent on the sin of our ancestors 
had endured for seventy years&#44; God visited them in their cap&#8211; 
tivity&#44; and they were permitted to rebuild the temple of the 
Most High in Jerusalem. &#8212; The love for idols had by their cap&#8211; 
tivity in Babylon been entirely exterminated&#44; and we&#44; there&#8211; 
fore&#44; find no indications during the existence of the second 
temple&#44; that this sin was ever a general one among the Jews&#59; 
and thus then they flourished&#44; protected by God&#44; and preserved 
a distinct people&#44; although now truly a handful of men among 
nations&#44; since the ten tribes who had been banished before the 
destruction of the first house never returned&#44; and even many 
of the Jews also remained behind in the lands of their captors. 
Many a time&#44; indeed&#44; did heathens pour their numerous armies 
over Judea&#44; forbade the religion of Heaven&#44; and slaughtered 
the followers of a pure worship. But at no time during this 
whole period&#44; and not even when the temple was again laid 
in ruins&#44; and we were a second time scattered as the grains fall 
from a sieve&#44; and were&#44; so to say&#44; encircled on all sides with 
envious and evil&#8211;wishers&#44; was it left in the power of men to 
deprive us of our religion&#44; the solace of our captivity&#44; the com&#8211; 
fort amidst all our sufferings. 

It pleased God&#44; on the day&#42; the recurrence of which we now 
celebrate&#44; to raise us up to be unto Him as a people&#44; more 
dearly beloved than all nations &#59; and the intentions of God&#44; the 
all&#8211;wise and all&#8211;good&#44; cannot be frustrated by the feeble efforts 
of mortals. &#8212; And when on any one spot the burthen of perse&#8211; 
cution laid too heavy upon us&#44; we always had a resting place

given us in anotlier land &#59; and if even it appeared that the 
sword was at any one time fully drawn to smite all&#44; our adver&#8211; 
saries were&#44; in spite of themselves&#44; induced to commiserate the 
fallen state of a people&#44; made great by moral elevation&#44; and 
upheld in olden times by the special favour of the Most High. 
This&#44; brethren&#44; is a brief view of the many mercies which it 
has been our lot to enjoy. It would be impossible to expatiate 
upon all the acts of grace&#44; for they are too many for number&#44; 
and even if we were to say all we know&#44; we should yet be 
liable to the reproof of the wise Rabbi&#44; who checked a man 
once with the question: &#34; Hast thou finished all the praises of 
the Lord&#63;&#34; But enough has been said already to make it ap&#8211; 
parent to every one&#44; that we&#44; as Israelites&#44; owe a peculiar debt 
of gratitude to our Creator. &#8212; If we now take a careful survey 
of all we have received&#44; to see which is the greatest blessing: 
we shall come to the conclusion&#44; that the promulgation of a 
revealed religion from Sinai was the chief good that has been 
bestowed on us. For what would have been the covenant with 
Abraham&#44; if his descendants had not become more enlightened 
in the knowledge of God&#44; than the other nations&#63; &#8212; To what 
end would the redemption from Egypt and the entrance into 
Palestine have tended&#44; but to drive out one pagan people to 
make room for another&#44; equally corrupt and uninformed&#63; &#8212; 
What would have all temporary assistance under affliction&#44; and 
victories over enemies availed&#44; if nothing but the martial shout 
of triumph or the acquisition of a new territory had resulted 
therefrom &#63; &#8212; And what at least could have preserved our na&#8211; 
tional existence&#44; but the law of God&#63; &#8212; Yes&#44; brethren&#44; this 
alone it is which made the covenant with Abraham effectual &#59; 
this made the exodus from Egypt not merely an act of grace 
to one people&#44; but to all nations of the world&#44; although in con&#8211; 
sequence thereof&#44; one nation of barbarous idolaters&#44; given to the 
most revolting acts of cruelty in their pretended worship&#44; had 
to be driven out from a land&#44; the soil of which they had pol&#8211; 
luted by their enormities. &#8212; Again&#44; if assistance against enemies 
and triumph over invaders were granted&#44; they were only another 
shield to preserve the pure worship free from admixture of 
heathen rites. &#8212; And when at length we were banished from off 
the goodly land which the Lord had given us&#44; we owed&#44; and

still owe&#44; our preservation to the doctrines of the faith&#44; the 
observance of which compel us to be unlike other families&#44; and 
render us a separate and distinct people. &#8212; We&#44; therefore&#44; find 
that all the prophets spoke of the law&#44; not as a burden imposed&#44; 
but as a benefit granted&#44; and we are constantly admonished to 
preserve it inviolate and holy. &#8212; And thus spoke Malachi at the 
conclusion of his prophecy&#44; and which also closes the books of 
the prophets : 


&#34; Remember the law of Moses my servant&#44; in which I have commanded 
him on Horeb statutes and judgments for all Israel.&#34; Malachi iii. 22. 

This law of Moses is indeed fit to be the law&#8211;book of an 
enlightened and virtuous people. It enjoins love for One great 
Creator and Preserver of all things&#59; it commands good will 
and peace towards all men&#44; and its object is to regulate the 
inclinations and passions of man&#44; so that the consequence of 
our actions may be a holy and righteous life. &#8212; But&#44; brethren&#44; 
let each of us ask himself: &#34; Have I so acted&#44; as the law de&#8211; 
mands&#63; Do I love my Creator&#63; Am I at peace and on terms 
of good will with all men &#63; Have I subjected my wishes&#44; my 
thoughts&#44; my endeavours&#44; and my passions to the wholesome 
restraint of the divine will&#63;&#34; Wo&#33; wo&#33; that we can answer 
these questions so little satisfactorily to our immortal souls&#33; 
The law says : &#34; I am the Lord thy God&#33;&#34; and again : &#34; Thou 
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart&#44; with all thy 
soul&#44; and with all thy might.&#34; &#8212; Further: &#34; After the Lord your 
God you shall walk&#44; and Him you shall fear&#59; and his com&#8211; 
mandments ye shall keep&#44; and to his voice ye shall hearken&#44; 
and Him ye shall serve&#44; and to Him ye shall adhere.&#34; But 
we have set ourselves above our God&#33; when He commands us 
to love Him&#44; we grumble at his dispensations&#59; we think our&#8211; 
selves wronged by the events which befal us&#44; as though the 
Judge of all the earth ever exercised judgment without a suf&#8211; 
ficient cause&#33; &#8212; We are told&#44; that it is God&#39;s pleasure that we 
should keep the Sabbath as a sign between Him and us for ever&#59;

but we cannot rest&#44; our business compels us&#44; so we say&#44; to 
regard gain of a few pieces of silver more than the pleasure 
of our Father &#33; Yes&#44; a trifling gain&#44; a gain which is often 
snatched from us before it is yet hoarded&#44; we set up as an object 
more desirable than the favour and grace of God&#44; which are 
everlasting&#33;&#8212; And the law itself&#44; the whole of which is alike 
the emanation of the same Supreme Wisdom&#44; we treat as though 
it were a human invention &#59; we reject this as unreasonable&#44; and 
that as obsolete &#59; this could only have been intended for the 
wilderness of Arabia&#44; and that suits not ourselves under this 
or that circumstance. This is the way many of us endeavour 
to lighten the law for themselves&#44; and this is&#44; alas&#44; the cause of 
all the division which so unhappily withholds many from 
coming to this house to worship continually with the congre&#8211; 
gation of the faithful. And if even some men do put faith in 
the whole law&#44; they are often withheld from associating with 
their brethren&#44; through offended pride. Any one receiving an 
offence from one connected with the Synagogue&#44; thinks himself 
entitled to wreak his vengeance upon the house of God&#44; as 
though his outraged feelings &#40;even granting that he has just 
cause to be offended) could authorize him to break the bonds 
which unite him to the holy community. &#8212; Brethren&#44; this 
state of things is not good&#33; we have become a scandal to many 
for the small regard we bear for the law &#33; it is said&#44; that infide&#8211; 
lity is making rapid progress among us&#33; it is asserted&#44; that the 
violation of the Sabbath is regarded as but a trifling offence 
with us&#33; some say&#44; that the Jews have ceased to view forbidden 
food with horror &#59; and those&#44; who see the seats of our Syna&#8211; 
gogues so often unoccupied maintain&#44; that we have lost all 
religious feelings&#33; In truth&#44; I cannot blame any stranger&#44; who&#44; 
viewing things from appearances only&#44; adjudges the modern 
Jews to be no longer a pious people. I know full well&#44; that it 
is not from unbelief&#44; but from too great a regard for personal 
convenience and worldly gain&#44; that most of us transgress &#59; but 
the effects are the same&#44; whether we sin from unbelief&#44; or from 
any other cause. Let us&#44; therefore&#44; remove the stigma &#59; it is 
very easy of attainment&#44; if we but make a serious and united 
effort. They who now neglect the Sabbath&#44; may&#44; if they but 
will&#44; yield obedience to the precept&#44; which says&#59; &#34; Remember

the Sabbath&#8211;day to keep it holy.&#34; &#8212; They who have separated 
themselves from the Synagogue can easily return&#44; and pay their 
devotions in the house dedicated to Israel&#39;s Preserver&#33; &#8212; They 
who have defiled themselves by unlawful living&#44; may&#44; how 
easily&#44; purify their way &#40;although the past cannot be undone)&#44; 
and do as their pious fathers have done before them&#33; &#8212; They 
who have wronged their fellow&#8211;men&#44; let them make restitution 
to those they have injured&#44; and make thus their peace with 
God and men&#33; &#8212; Let the hater of his species accustom his heart 
to find pleasure in the precept: &#34; Thou shalt love thy neigh&#8211; 
bour like thyself&#44;&#34; and he will find satisfaction arising to 
him&#8211; from yielding the unjust hatred which had rendered his 
former existence unhappy&#33; &#8212; And let him&#44; who has by indul&#8211; 
gence of his passions offended his Maker&#44; curb the impetuosity 
of his conduct&#44; and gradually return with sure and unwavering 
steps to the righteous path from which he has perhaps thought&#8211; 
lessly&#44; or even wickedly&#44; strayed. &#8212; If in this manner we all 
&#34; remember the law of Moses the servant of God&#44;&#34; how can 
we fail to become again a pious nation&#44; a holy people&#44; and a 
kingdom of priests&#63; If the next anniversary of the promul&#8211; 
gation of the law should find many wanderers from the way 
of virtue again united to the communion of the adherents to 
our Father in Heaven &#59; if we should then be made glad by 
seeing the service of our pure religion more regarded and better 
and more numerously attended than we have found it hitherto: 
how exultingly we shall point to the agreeable result&#44; and tell 
to others how sweetly yet speaketh&#44; even at this distant day&#44; 
the holy law to the soul of every Israelite &#33; To effect this 
pious object&#44; rests entirely with all and each of us &#59; let each&#44; 
therefore&#44; contribute his share towards this reformation&#44; and let 
no one be deterred from beginning&#44; because one or another has 
not yet set the example. If we accordingly do this to the best 
of our ability&#44; we may rest assured&#44; that upon all occasions&#44; 
when assembled in this house&#44; we shall be blessed&#44; as we are 
promised in the law : &#34; In every place&#44; where I will permit 
thee to mention my name&#44; will I come and bless thee.&#34; 

bless us&#44; Father of mercy&#44; and guide our wavering steps 
through the dangers of life&#44; and receive us at its close into thy

again the dead to everlasting and happy life. Amen.

DISCOURSE XXVIII. 

THE SIN OF INSINCERITY. 

Father of mercy &#33; open thy ears to our prayers&#44; and be 
gracious to us. &#8212; Not for the sake of our goodness&#44; not because 
of our own righteousness do we ask thy aid &#59; for well we know&#44; 
that we have sinned &#8212; well do we know&#44; that our hands are 
soiled with deeds of iniquity&#44; and that our hearts are impure&#44; 
because of the thoughts of deceit and wickedness which we 
have cherished. But Thou&#44; gracious Sovereign of all&#44; wilt not 
judge us according to the strict rules of unpardoning jus&#8211; 
tice &#59; but wilt ever temper the severity of decision with the 
clemency of paternal favour&#59; and mayest Thou&#44; thus judging&#44; 
call us unto thy salvation&#44; and receive our service in favour&#44; 
although we humble mortals do but little of the good&#44; which 
thy grace may have permitted us to accomplish. &#8212; May this be 
thy will&#44; now and for ever &#33; Amen. 



Brethren 



We often are presumptuous enough to complain of the dis&#8211; 
pensations of Heaven &#59; we find fault with our fate&#44; because we 
imagine&#44; that we have not received what we deem our just 
share of the amount of happiness&#44; which we see distributed 
around us. We accuse the Deity&#44; but how wickedly &#33; of 
injustice to our great personal merits&#44; and often compare&#44; fool&#8211;

ishly vaunting&#44; our own moral goodness&#44; mental elevation&#44; and 
social importance&#44; with the same qualities in others&#44; and then 
in the bitterness of our hearts we ask : &#34; Why are we not as 
bountifully dealt with as our neighbours &#63;&#34; &#8212; Apart now from 
the consideration&#44; that it is unbecoming for the creature to rise 
up in judgment against its Creator&#44; there is generally in all the 
like complaints&#44; whether the)&#39; are uttered or merely haunting 
the imagination of the discontented&#44; a great and woful want of 
self&#8211;knowledge at the bottom of this discontent. &#8212; We only 
look to the fact&#44; that others&#44; whom we style happy&#44; are bad&#44; at 
least we think so &#59; and therefore&#44; by contrast&#44; we come to the 
conclusion that we njood and virtuous ones should be more 
happy still. &#8212; But before we should suffer any complaint to 
ripen in our thoughts&#44; we ought to inquire : &#34; Are we what we 
should be &#63; Is our virtue of that sincere&#44; disinterested caste&#44; 
that it will withstand temptation &#63; Is our devotion or our piety 
the effect of habit and imitation&#44; or of conviction and love &#8212; 
pure love of God &#63; Has hypocrisy no part in producing out&#8211; 
ward religion in which the heart has no share &#63;&#34; &#8212; And if we 
often&#44; I may add daily&#44; institute this investigation&#44; it is to be 
feared&#44; that but little unmixed virtue would be found seated in 
our souls. We would often find&#44; that charity is exercised for 
the sake of ostentation &#59; benevolence to one accompanied by 
violence&#44; fraud and oppression towards another&#59; continence 
exhibited before the public gaze&#44; the better to lull the vigilance 
of men to secret debauchery &#59; and outward religion&#44; frequent 
attendance at the house of God&#44; the visiting of the sick&#44; and 
even risking of life to save that of others&#44; frequently not unac&#8211; 
companied by overreaching the defenceless and practising 
wickedness upon the unwary. &#8212; Do I overdraw scenes of 
iniquity &#63; Or rather is this not a true exposition of feelings&#44; 
which lay&#44; alas &#33; but too frequently at the bottom of human 
goodness &#63; And if this is the case&#44; and daily experience con&#8211; 
firms it&#44; we may no longer wonder&#44; why the Almighty in his 
mercy so often lets chastisement fall upon those who practise 
righteousness&#44; that they may be often recalled to investigate 
where the evil is for which they suffer. Already at the 
destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah&#44; Abraham asked of God : 
&#34; Shall the judge of all the earth not do justice&#63;&#34; But&#44; how 

    <pb n="291"/>

true is it&#44; that nothing but justice springs from the Source of 
wisdom and righteousness &#59; it is sinful man alone&#44; who draws 
upon himself the consequence of sin &#8212; the punishment indisso&#8211; 
iubly connected with transgression. Aye&#44; the righteous sins 
often&#44; oftener indeed&#44; than human pride may flatter itself&#59; 
often even&#44; as said&#44; whilst seemingly engaged in pious deeds &#59; 
and it is&#44; therefore&#44; that the punishment&#44; be it light or heavy&#44; 
be it mental or bodily&#44; follows the transgression as sure as the 
flash precedes the sound of the awful discharge of Heaven&#39;s 
thunder. Now we blame our heavenly Father for punishment 
meted out to us &#59; but it is we who have applied the poisoned 
chalice to our own lips&#44; we quaff the fatal draught&#44; and when 
we writhe under the distressing agony of a terrible dissolution 
we pronounce malediction upon the vender of the drug&#44; when 
we alone are to blame&#44; for having mixed the cup&#44; and wilfully 
and knowingly exhausted its contents. &#8212; To follow up the 
simile&#44; the righteous may say : &#34; I will enter into the abodes of 
vice&#44; will partially partake of its practice&#44; that thereby I may 
restore the blunted delight my soul now takes in the exercise 
of unmixed good &#33;&#34; Let him be warned &#59; the deadly poison of 
vice is like the destructive acid&#44; the inward contact with which 
destroys animal life instantaneously. &#8212; And let no one trifle 
with sinful practices&#44; although they be but trifling &#59; they will 
overwhelm the finer feelings of his nature&#44; as it were with the 
suddenness of a volcanic shower&#44; and turn him&#44; whither he will&#44; 
its terrific flight will overtake him&#44; till he sinks exhausted and 
despairing into the gaping jaws of death &#33; Let no man then 
think&#44; that since to err is human&#44; he may safely render himself 
a compound of vice and virtue&#44; of folly and wisdom &#33; woful 
error &#33; unmixed exaltation above all earthly passions should 
be the aim&#44; the constant study of life&#44; and not until this emi&#8211; 
nence is attained&#44; can we cease to be vigilant over ourselves &#33; 
And when is this point gained &#63; never&#44; in our existence &#59; and 
it is well that it is so &#59; we must ever toil upwards&#44; undismayed 
by intervening obstacles&#44; undistui&#39;bed by the howling of the 
storm&#44; which the world&#44; the passions&#44; the cares of life may stir 
up within us&#33; But he who vainly endeavours to hold the balance 
between goodness and sin will fail&#44; and become the ungodly

wanderer&#44; which he so sedulously avoided to be&#44; by bestowing&#44; 
what be imagined&#44; an equal share upon both ways of life. 

These considerations will be better understood&#44; when we 
refer to the portion of the prophet Isaiah which has been read 
to&#8211;day. &#8212; After speaking of the ingratitude and thoughtlessness 
of the Israelites in neglecting to serve God with truth and 
sincerity : he compares himself and Israelites to Sodom and 
Gomorrah&#44; on account of the great destruction which he fore&#8211; 
saw &#59; and then continues : 

&#34; Hear then the word of the Lord&#44; chiefs of Sodom &#33; listen to the law of 
our God&#44; ye people of Gomorrah &#33; To what serves me the multitude of your 
sacrifices&#44; speaks the Lord&#44; I am sated with the burnt&#8211;offerings of rams&#44; and 
the fat of fatted cattle&#44; and the blood of steers&#44; and sheep and rams&#44; I desire 
not. When you come to be seen before me &#8212; who asks this of your hands&#44; 
to tread my courts &#63; &#8212; Bring no longer the ofFering of deceit&#44; it is incense of 
abomination to me &#8212; not new&#8211;moon&#8211;days and Sabbaths&#44; assemblies at festi&#8211; 
vals &#8212; I like not festive rest with wickedness.&#34; Isaiah i. 10&#8211;13. 

&#34; I like not festive rest with wickedness&#44;&#34; says our God&#44; 
and let it be our endeavour to have this solemn lesson con&#8211; 
stantly before us&#44; and derive the benefit from it&#44; which we 
should ever derive from wisdom emanating from the Creator&#39;s 
own words. &#8212; Isaiah had been sent to denounce to the Israelites 
their sinful practices&#44; to tell them that the proud citadel of Zion 
should be left as desolate as the neglected hut in a vineyard&#44; 
and that&#44; but for the grace of God&#44; the destruction should be 
as total as the subversion of the cities of the plain. Perhaps 
they may have pointed to the long row of oxen&#44; of rams&#44; and 
sheep led to the altar to be sacrificed&#44; as an agreeable savour to 
the Lord&#44; to the pomp with which the new&#8211;mbon&#8211;days&#44; the 

    <pb n="293"/>

THE SIN OF INSINCERITY. 293 

Sabbaths&#44; and festivals&#44; were celebrated&#44; to the sweet incense 
which daily was burnt upon the golden altar before the holy of 
holies. &#8212; And to this remonstrance&#44; why punishment ought not 
to come down upon the sinning people&#44; the prophet replies: 
&#34; Hear then the word of the Lord&#44; chiefs of Sodom&#44; listen to 
the law of our God&#44; ye people of Gomorrah&#33;&#34; We read in the 
book of GenesivS of the evil deeds&#44; the unblushing licentious&#8211; 
ness exhibited in these towns&#44; and candour must compel us to 
add&#44; that depravity but little inferior&#44; and brought about by an 
attachment to idolatry and mixture with heathen nations&#44; had 
taken deep root in the times of the prophets&#44; as we must 
gather from their touching admonitions to an unwillingly listen&#8211; 
ing people. &#34; Chiefs of Sodom&#44; people of Gomorrah&#44;&#34; says 
the prophet&#44; you&#44; who practise&#44; both high and low&#44; deeds 
discountenanced by the law of our God&#44; and follow insti&#8211; 
tutions forbidden by the word of the Lord&#44; you will speak 
of sacrifices&#44; of incense&#44; of burning fat&#44; of smoking altars  
You point to the crowded courts of the holy temple&#44; to the 
number of pilgrims that grace Jerusalem at festive seasons&#44; 
and then imagine&#44; that evil cannot come&#63; &#8212; But you are mis&#8211; 
taken&#44; God no longer desires you to tread his courts &#59; the 
presence of sinners&#44; when coming unreformed&#44; for the sake 
of being seen of men&#44; is not pleasant&#44; and He abhors fes&#8211; 
tive celebration&#44; if wickedness and sin accompany it.&#34; &#8212; And 
he continues: &#34;Your new&#8211;moon&#8211;days&#44; and your festivals&#44; 
my soul does hate&#44; they have become a burden upon me&#44; I am 
tired of bearing them. And when you spread out your hands&#44; 
I will hide my eyes from you &#59; and if even you pray ever so 
much&#44; I hear not&#44; your hands are full of blood.&#34; &#8212; The conse&#8211; 
quences of sinning are here strongly exemplified. We are 
commanded to observe Sabbaths&#44; the festivals&#44; to assemble on 
those days in the city chosen as the peculiar seat of God&#39;s ma&#8211; 
jesty &#59; He had promised&#44; that He would come and bless us&#44; 
whenever we obeyed his will in this respect&#44; so far even as to 
preserve our land from the inroads of enemies&#44; when all should 
have gone on their periodical pilgrimages&#59; but when our ances&#8211; 
tors had sinned&#44; their very outward acts of piety were considered&#44; 
not as a mitigation&#44; but as an aggravation of their offence&#59; the 
celebrations of the festivals had become&#44; as it were&#44; a burden 

85&#42; 

    <pb n="294"/>

294 THE SIN OF INSINCERITY. 

too heavy to be borne by the Sustainer of all &#8212; and even the 
prayers of the congregation He would no more hear&#44; if prayers 
were ever so much multiplied&#44; if all were to appear with hands 
outstretched to heaven&#44; because their hands were filled with 
blood. &#8212; Now&#44; if we look at what Moses said in the fourth 
chapter&#44; seventh verse of Deuteronomy: &#34; For where is there 
a nation&#44; ever so great&#44; to whom the gods are as nigh as our 
God&#44; whenever we call upon Him&#59;&#34; we shall at one view have 
before us the difference between serving God in sincerity&#44; and 
assuming piety as a cloak for wickedness. In the one place&#44; 
we need but wish and our wish is fulfilled&#44; as the prophet tells 
us in another passage &#59; and when we transgress&#44; no multiplicity 
of prostrations&#44; no accumulation of words&#44; no show of outspread 
hands will avail&#44; for the eyes of God&#44; as it were&#44; are turned 
with horror from the sight of so much hypocrisy&#44; and his ears 
are closed against the discordant sound of apparent devotion&#44; 
mixed up with the contamination of vice. 

After having in this manner pourtrayed the abhorrence felt 
for wickedness and deceit&#44; the prophet announces what would 
be pleasing to God&#44; and says: &#34; Wash you&#44; cleanse yourselves&#44; 
remove the evil of your deeds&#44; cease to do bad. &#8212; Learn to do 
good&#44; seek justice&#44; restore the robbed property&#44; see justice done 
to the orphan&#44; attend to the suit of the widow&#33;&#34; &#8212; The first 
step in the reformation&#44; must be the purification of the heart&#44; 
that is to say&#44; we must endeavour to find out the sources of our 
hypocrisy and correct our thoughts so as not to produce again 
actions of the kind which our Lord abominates. &#8212; This first 
step taken&#44; active purification should follow: First&#44; to learn 
what is right&#59; so that if a man has acted wrongly from igno&#8211; 
rance&#44; he may not be misled again by the like cause. &#8212; 
Then he should endeavour to dispense justice&#44; restore what has 
been unlawfully obtained&#44; and prevent oppression from de&#8211; 
scending through the practices of others upon the heads of the 
helpless ones. For it is unfortunately but too true&#44; that when&#8211; 
ever any one becomes reduced&#44; people are very apt to begin to 
think ill of him&#44; and for fear that his downward course should 
not be rapid enough&#44; his former friends perhaps even assist 
in lending their aid to break from under his feet the little 
resting place he may have found&#44; to precipitate him the faster 

    <pb n="295"/>

into the gulf of ruin&#59; and&#44; strange as it may seem&#44; the lone 
widow and the fatherless wanderer&#44; as also the friendless 
stranger&#44; are almost daily the victims of the rapacious and de&#8211; 
signing. The prophet&#44; therefore&#44; designates the orphan and 
widow as the chief objects of the care of the sinner&#44; who wishes 
to obtain the favour of God&#59; he should&#44; namely&#44; having hitherto 
practised outward piety for the sake of appearance only&#44; now 
oppose the wrong intended towards the defenceless&#44; though in 
this pursuit he should expose himself to the ridicule and even 
obloquy of a thoughtless world. &#8212; Conduct so contrary to hypo&#8211; 
crisy and time&#8211;serving persevered in&#44; will next tend to obtain 
the forgiveness of sins&#59; as the Lord says: &#34;If your sins be 
like scarlet they shall be white as the snow&#44; and if they be red 
as crimson&#44; they shall be like wffol.&#34; This is the image the 
messenger of Heaven used to express the change which repent&#8211; 
ance&#44; inward and outward&#44; will invariably produce in man&#59; 
the glare of the scarlet is to vanish&#44; and the pure whiteness of 
snow shall take its place &#59; and truly when the heart has under&#8211; 
gone a change from badness and corruption to virtue and entire 
recovery&#44; it is not what it was&#44; nay&#44; it bears not even the least 
resemblance to its former self&#44; but is&#44; as though a heart of 
stone had been removed&#44; and one of flesh substituted in its 
place&#59; &#8212; the want of hope is supplied by hope in the Lord&#44; and 
the absence of peace is superseded by the all&#8211;healing grace of 
God. 

Thus were the effects of sin and the results of piety laid by 
Isaiah before Israel. He told them further&#44; that doing good 
would certainly bring the blessing promised&#44; but that the sword 
should destroy them&#44; if they refused obedience. &#8212; Alas&#33; how&#8211; 
ever&#44; their ears were closed against hearing&#44; and their hearts 
against understanding&#44; and they continued their course of ini&#8211; 
quity&#44; undismayed by the reproof and instructions of those sent 
to admonish them. And the sword was drawn&#44; and the fire 
was kindled&#59; and our virgins&#44; our sages&#44; our tender children&#44; 
and our strong men were slaughtered&#44; and our palaces were 
burnt&#44; and our temple devoured twice by the consuming flame. 
And those&#44; whom the sword had spared&#44; were led into capti&#8211; 
vity&#44; and here we linger distant from all the scenes of our early 
institutions&#44; scattered and dispersed over all the earth &#33; And 

    <pb n="296"/>

those few&#44; who have returned to the land of Palestine&#44; to lay 
their bones near the graves of the fathers of our people&#44; live 
degraded&#44; in fear of enemies and in poverty&#44; in the home of the 
former free and brave Hebrew nation&#33; Aye&#44; so miserable is 
their state&#44; that to this distant land even&#44; they send their ac&#8211; 
credited men to ask for aid&#44; to buy bread for their helpless 
children&#44; and to rescue from the grasp of the cruel creditor 
the bodies of the ancients and sages among them &#33; 

All this has come over us&#44; because we refused to mould our 
actions by the ordinances of the law&#44; because we preferred 
worldly pleasures to the favour of the Everlasting One. &#8212; We&#44; 
therefore&#44; have yet to mourn every year&#44; at this time&#44; the de&#8211; 
struction of all that was sacred in Jerusalem&#44; the slaughter of 
the priests and the burning of the temple. &#8212; And yet&#44; the mourn&#8211; 
ful ninth of Ab&#44; the day on which all these evils occurred&#44; 
scarcely calls up in the bosoms of many of us&#44; any emotion of 
national grief &#8212; since many think it not necessary to mourn for 
all that has been lost&#44; and for the change which has so awfully 
visited our people&#33; Nay more&#44; the law of God&#44; the infraction 
of which was so terribly visited&#44; the truth of which has been 
so awfully proven&#44; is not even now responded to by our hearts&#59; 
we add to this day&#44; yea&#44; more than formerly&#44; wickedness to 
transgression&#44; and brave the thunders of God&#44; as though they 
would not be sent&#44; and smite at length our guilty heads into 
the dust&#33; And truly said Isaiah: &#34;Wo&#33; sinning people&#44; nation 
loaded with wickedness&#44; seed of evil&#8211;doers&#44; destroying chil&#8211; 
dren&#33; &#8212; they have forsaken the Lord&#44; incensed the Holy One 
of Israel&#44; and departed back from the righteous path&#33;&#34; &#8212; In&#8211; 
deed&#44; it is useless to hide the truth from ourselves&#44; that mucli 
private and public sin exists among us&#44; and that the denuncia&#8211; 
tions of the ancient prophet are as yet applicable to our own 
days. &#8212; But this state of things must alter&#44; this unrighteousness 
must cease &#59; for the day will come&#44; when God will revenge 
himself of his opponents&#44; and take vengeance of his enemies&#44; 
at the time when He consigneth to condign punishment those 
who have transgressed his law. &#8212; Then also&#44; will the Lord let 
his hand pass over us&#44; and like the crucible smelt out our 
dross and remove all our allow&#59; and&#44; adds the prophet: &#34; And 
I will reappoint thy judges as formei&#39;ly&#44; and thy councillors as

in old times&#44; and after this thou shalt be called the city of 
righteousness&#44; the trusty town. Zion shall be redeemed 
through justice&#44; and those who return unto her through right&#8211; 
eousness. 

may it be thy will&#44; Father of mercy&#44; to fulfil speedily the 
promises Thou didst make through thy prophets&#44; and raise up 
again thy altars&#44; where offerings of righteousness&#44; and incense 
of purity shall be offered to Thee for everlasting. Amen.

JEWISH RELIGION. 



DISCOURSE XXIX. 

THE DUTY OF INSTRUCTION. 

Thou&#44; who appointest to each man a destiny of good or 
evil as his ways may deserve&#44; and who art ever ready to annul 
the evil decree&#44; when the sinner returneth unto Thee with 
prayer and sincerity: receive now&#44; at this season of forgiveness 
of sin&#44; the supplications which we&#44; thy people Israel&#44; address 
to Thee in the countries of our captivity: and may our prayer 
be as acceptable before Thee&#44; as was the sacrifice without 
blemish which was formerly brought to thy temple as an atone&#8211; 
ment for the transgressions of thy congregation. save us 
from evil&#33; protect us from the contumely of the ungodly 
and the persecutions of the strangers to thy&#39; holy creed &#59; and 
let thy grace be displayed over us&#44; so that all inhabitants of 
the earth may see&#44; that in truth we are called by thy name. 
May this be thy will. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

Again by the favour of God&#44; we are permitted to assemble 
in this house of prayer&#44; and to anticipate the approach of an&#8211; 
other Day of Atonement. To many of us new joys may have 
been dispensed in the year which has elapsed&#59; but many have

had to drink the cup of sorrow. Weal and wo have&#44; as usual&#44; 
chased each other in their circuit round our globe &#59; and&#44; per&#8211; 
haps&#44; the distressed one has been gladdened by an unexpected 
enlargement&#44; and the proud and he who conceived himself 
secure and firmly seated have been moved&#44; and their grandeur 
rendered as naught&#44; and their security been turned into tribula&#8211; 
tion. The picture here presented is an occurrence of every 
day of our life&#59; but its instructiveness is not in the least dimi&#8211; 
nished by its frequency. To him&#44; who does not take heed of 
what passes&#44; the subversion of a world would hardly be more 
than a natural phenomenon &#59; but to the mind alive to religious 
impression&#44; every event speaks of the unerring wisdom of 
God&#44; which orders every thing for the wisest of purposes. To 
a mind so constituted nothing should pass Unheeded &#59; and from 
the evil no less than the good instruction and improvement will 
flow unto him&#44; since he always considers&#44; that the hand of the 
Jjord has done it. Even should he himself be the object&#44; 
against whom the divine judgment is directed&#44; it will cause him 
to reflect and ponder&#44; and consequently to correct the defec&#8211; 
tiveness of his course&#44; and thus it may truly be said : that to 
the wise and righteous light will beam out of darkness &#33; But 
the heedless one will receive the greatest blessings as a matter 
of course&#44; and whatever of punishment he may meet with&#44; he 
will either think a personal injury done to his righteousness&#44; or 
will pass it by without bestowing a thought upon it. &#8212; And be&#8211; 
hold the difierence&#33; The righteous one is meek in prosperity 
and&#44; however exalted&#44; he sees a brother in the humblest of 
beings&#59; and in adversity he humbly bends to the rod which is 
sent to chastise him&#59; but the thoughtless transgressor is insolent 
in prosperity&#44; and when he suffers he vents his wrath in im&#8211; 
precations and ill&#8211;humour&#44; as though the Judge of all flesh 
could be driven to remove merited punishment by the way&#8211; 
wardness of the obdurate child. &#8212; It requires but little penetra&#8211; 
tion to distinguish between the better and the worse of these 
two principles of action&#44; since our life is so constantly diversi&#8211; 
fied by good and evil&#44; by reward and punishment. But&#44; alas&#44; 
the thinking ones are the smaller portion of mankind&#44; heed&#8211; 
lessness and obstinacy are too often characterised as cheerful&#8211; 
ness and firmness&#44; and hence we see so little reformation pro&#8211;

duced by cause&#63;&#44; which any disinterested witness would con&#8211; 
sider sufficiently powerful to call forth serious reflection. Thus 
it happens&#44; that the chastisements which God sends&#44; as our 
holy writings teach us&#44; to warn us of our errors&#44; but too often 
fail to have the good effect for which they are intended. &#8212; 
The Almighty&#44; therefore&#44; knowing the weakness of human 
nature&#44; and also knowing how much one man is apt to be in&#8211; 
fluenced by the words and deeds of the other&#44; and how much 
the cares of life tend to claim almost the whole attention&#44; to 
the exclusion of every thing else&#44; of each mortal&#44; has set apart 
a portion of every year as a peculiar time for reflection and 
repentance&#44; to fix&#44; as it were&#44; more emphatically the wavering 
fancy&#59; to assemble all believers to unite by words and acts in 
devotion and repentance&#44; and to make this short period dedicated 
to the pursuit of penitence and of righteousness as our chief 
occupation. And well is this time chosen. For when we were 
the Israelites of Palestine&#44; not given as now to trading and 
money&#8211;hunting as our chief pursuit&#44; but to manual labour 
and agriculture&#44; the beginning of the civil year was just the 
period of all the most congenial to piety. Behold&#33; every man 
had finished his work in the field&#44; his crop of grain and fruit 
had been housed&#44; and his efforts blessed b)&#39; the bounteous hand 
of God. If ever man can feel grateful&#44; it is surely the time&#44; 
when he has ample cause to be so &#59; and if ever he should feel 
repentance&#44; it is when he has felt the evil effects of transgres&#8211; 
sion. And as our land was always fruitful when we were 
righteous&#44; and as punishment universally followed transgres&#8211; 
sion: every one could easily feel&#44; often even by the result of 
his harvest&#44; if his and his neighbours&#39; conduct had been in the 
spirit of godliness or not. &#8212; Then again&#44; it is the beginning of 
our year&#59; and&#44; therefore&#44; it was proper then&#44; and is no less so 
now&#44; to begin a new period with extraordinary acts of devo&#8211; 
tion&#44; and to repent&#44; even if we should not be conscious of any 
aggravated sin in ourselves&#44; of wrongs committed unwittingly&#44; 
and of faults into which we may have misled others by un&#8211; 
kindness of manner&#44; or by indiscreet advice. It is&#44; therefore&#44; 
incumbent on us&#44; so our wise and blessed teachers tell us&#44; to 
pacify our offended neighbour before the Day of Atonement 
conies&#44; so that he may not stand with aggrieved feelings of 

    <pb n="303"/>

bitterness towards us&#44; when he comes to ask forgiveness for his 
own sins&#59; and to those who have the capacity&#44; it is command&#8211; 
ed to exhort the brethren on this Sabbath of Repentance to a 
contrition of hearts&#44; and a firm purpose to amend whatever of 
fault&#44; stubbornness&#44; and waywardness they may discover in 
themselves. And on this subject&#44; we read the following in the 
book of Ezekiel &#40;chap&#44; xxxiii.): &#34;And the word of the Lord 
came unto me as follows: Son of man say unto the children of 
thy people and speak unto them : A land&#44; when 1 bring over 
it the sword&#59; and the people of the land take one man from 
amongst them&#44; and appoint him as their sentinel&#59; and when he 
sees the sword coming over the land&#44; and he blows the cornet&#44; 
and warns the people: and if the hearer hears the voice of the 
cornet and is not warned&#44; and the sword comes and takes him 
oiF&#59; his blood shall be on his own head &#8212; the voice of the cornet 
he has heard and he has not taken warning&#59; his blood shall be 
upon himself&#59; for he was warned and could have saved his life. 
But if the sentinel see the sword coming&#44; and he blow not the 
cornet&#44; and the people be not warned&#44; and the sword come and 
take one of them: he has been taken away for his sin&#44; and his 
blood I will require of the sentinel.&#34; &#8212; And thus continues the 
prophecy : 

&#34; And thou son of man &#33; I have appointed thee a sentinel for the house of 
Israel&#44; and when thou hearest a word out of my mouth&#44; thou shall warn 
them from me. When I say of the wicked : Wicked one thou shalt die &#59; 
and thou speakest not to warn the wicked from his way&#44; this wicked one 
shall die for his sin&#44; and his blood from thy hand I will require. But thou&#44; 
when thou hast forewarned the wicked from his way&#44; to return therefrom&#44; 
and he do not return from his way : he for his sins shall die&#44; but thou hast 
saved thy soul.&#34; xxxiii. 7&#8211;9.

THE DUTY OF INSTRUCTION. 5 

In the extract here presented to your consideration&#44; brethren &#33; 
you will see&#44; that the duty to admonish others is one solemnly 
enjoined by God in his commands to his prophet. It is true&#44; 
that the holy spirit is no longer displayed over the messengers 
of the Almighty&#44; as palpably as it was in olden times &#59; but the 
effects of the spirit&#44; which was formerly poured out&#44; are yet 
in existence&#44; for the promulgated word is yet in our hands&#44; in 
our mouths&#44; and in our hearts&#59; and thus the command issued 
to Ezekiel to forewarn the sinner is yet operative even at this 
very day In pursuance of this duty&#44; I address you now&#44; since 
unworthy&#8211; as I am&#44; I occupy for the moment the place of 
teacher in the community. No one is more conscious than 
myself&#44; that my own course is not faultless &#59; no one need tell 
me to take the beam from between my eyes&#44; since I never 
would arrogate to mj&#8211;self the idea of perfection &#59; but only as 
one brother exhorts the other to reflection do I wish to be 
viewed&#44; as one of the people&#44; guilty of the same derelictions&#44; 
and actuated by the same sinful propensities&#44; who himself 
derives instruction and correction through those labours by 
which he endeavours to benefit others. To adopt the simile 
of the prophet : the sentinel is not the less threatened by 
the sword&#44; nor the less menaced by dangers&#44; because he stands 
upon a tower to discover the danger at a distance&#44; and because 
he has the cornet by his side to forewarn the townsmen of the 
approaching destruction. &#8212; Brethren &#33; we all have sinned &#59; and 
but rarely are we able to say with truth&#44; that one entire day has 
passed over our heads&#44; that we have employed in doing all the 
good we could&#44; and avoiding all the evil which was avoidable. 
We have&#44; perhaps&#44; neglected to make ourselves acquainted with 
our duties&#59; and our ignorance&#44; through which we sin&#44; has been 
a voluntary one &#59; and we cannot claim an exemption from pun&#8211; 
ishment by the plea of good intentions&#44; and the not knowing of 
the hurtfulness of our doings. &#8212; Or perhaps we have haply dis&#8211; 
covered our faults&#44; and have resolved to amend&#59; but this deter&#8211; 
mination has been deferred from day to day&#44; and we are as bad 
as we were last year and the year before the last. &#8212; Seeing our 
misconduct&#44; we may have thrown the cloak of hypocrisy&#44; 
or the veil of extenuation over it&#59; we may have considered 
our aberrations as unimportant&#44; and which the Almighty would

not notice &#59; in short&#44; we may have done every thing in our 
power to fancy ourselves good and virtuous without our being 
so&#44; and consequently have persevered in a course which ought 
to have been abandoned &#59; and have even wondered&#44; to use the 
language of Isaiah: &#34;Why have we fasted and God has not 
seen&#44; why have we afflicted our souls and He knows it not &#63;&#34; 
But it is entire blindness which causes us to argue in this man&#8211; 
ner&#44; aye&#44; a voluntary one even&#44; for we might liave reasoned 
better if we had taken proper means to form a better judgment. 
We speak of our righteousness &#8212; of our resignation &#8212; of our 
humility &#8212; of our charities &#59; but we imagine vainly&#44; that by 
practising a few virtues&#44; we have exhausted the whole series of 
good deeds &#33; Fatal self&#8211;delusion &#33; even granted that we have 
ourselves done every thing relating to our persons &#59; have we&#44; 
I ask&#44; done all in relation to others &#63; Have we made virtue 
estimable &#63; have we espoused the cause of righteousness when 
we heard it assailed &#63; have we placed ourselves forward to check 
corruption &#63; have we listened with becoming humility to the 
advice and remonstrance of others&#63; have not our slothfulness 
and our timidity prevented us from resisting the wrong &#63; And 
even if we can answer all these queries in a manner to satisfy 
our consciences&#44; we have yet the startling question to meet : 
&#39; How have we educated our children&#63;&#34; We boast about the 
Ijeauty of our religion &#59; we deplore its downfal in the miscon&#8211; 
duct of many around us &#59; we withdraw even from popular 
meetings&#44; because we cannot stem the tide of wrong measures 
enforced against the precepts of the law : but our children we 
neglect&#44; they are to obtain a knowledge of religion by intuition 
or inspiration &#59; we do not trouble ourselves to teach them the 
way they should walk in&#44; we do not show them the path of 
righteousness&#59; all we do is to tell them that they are born of 
Jewish parentage&#44; and leave them then to find their way to the 
knowledge and practice of the precepts revealed to Moses&#44; as 
well as they can &#59; we have discharged our duty by being their 
corporeal parents&#44; and we either have not the abilities or the 
inclination to become their spiritual ones also. And even if we 
tell them a few of the commandments&#44; we are too enlightened 
forsooth to enforce them &#59; we allege to live in a free coun&#8211; 
try&#44; and say&#44; every one has a right to do what he pleases. 

    <pb n="306"/>

THE DUTY OF INSTRUCTION. 7 

Abstractedly speaking&#44; we have a power of doing whatever we 
will&#44; even the most unnatural crimes &#59; but the right to do 
wrong is an absurdity&#44; which none but weak minds can ever 
entertain. This being the case&#44; it is evidently absurd to let our 
children go unpunished&#44; or at all events unreproved&#44; if they 
fail to attend to the religious duties which we ourselves teach 
them&#44; or which an instructor has imparted&#44; to whose care we 
have entrusted their education. But this&#44; alas&#33; is not our mode 
of proceeding&#44; for no matter how little regardful the child is of 
religious observance&#44; we close our eyes against it&#44; and foolishly 
imagine&#44; that riper years will teach him more correctly&#44; than 
our persuasion can do in childhood. But we deceive ourselves &#59; 
for religion is a check upon the inclinations and passions&#44; as has 
been said already very often &#59; if&#44; therefore&#44; the curbing of these 
passions and these inclinations has not been strictly enforced at 
an age when the physical organization of the body is not suffi&#8211; 
ciently developed to permit the child to act as his sensual feel&#8211; 
ings demand : how can it be expected that he will be moderate 
in the enjoyment of unhallowed pleasures&#44; when he feels him&#8211; 
self drawn towards them by the example of others and his 
inward impulse&#44; when he at the same time imagines&#44; that his 
powers of mind and body are now fully equal to their being 
taken in large and immoderate quantities &#63; &#8212; Or we attend care&#8211; 
fully to the education of our children in childhood &#59; we early 
teach them to repeat&#44; when they first begin to lisp with their 
infant stammer&#44; the unity of our God &#59; yes&#44; they are taught to 
say&#39; : &#34; Hear&#44; Israel&#44; the Lord our God is the only Eternal 
Being.&#34; As they advance farther in years&#44; we instil in tliem 
a part of the duties they owe to this only God&#44; make them 
acquainted by degrees with the whole duties of man. But no 
sooner have they reached the age of boyhood&#44; than all restraint 
is at once withdrawn&#44; and they are taught to unlearn all the 
lessons of their childhood &#59; for it is not to be supposed that the 
young gentleman need be an attendant at the place of worship &#59; 
it can hardly be expected of him&#44; that he should abstain from 
forbidden food &#59; and as for Sabbaths and the festivals &#8212; he is 
placed in a situation&#44; where their observance is next to impossi&#8211; 
ble&#59; he is told&#44; that it is the chief business of his life to amass 
money&#44; either as a merchant&#44; a mechanic&#44; a physician&#44; or a law&#8211; 

    <pb n="307"/>

yer&#44; and that he will have done enough to satisfy his parents&#39; 
scruples&#44; if he comes once a year or once in two years&#44; on a 
Kippur or Rosh&#8211;Hashanah&#8211;Day&#44; to appear before the altar of 
God&#44; provided he does all in his power during the rest of the 
time to advance the interest of his parents or his own&#44; and their 
mutual high&#8211;standing in society. And even if we teach our 
children actually and truly how to fear God&#44; we very often 
destroy all good effects by our own irreligious conduct. We 
teach them : &#34; Remember the Sabbath to keep it holy&#44;&#34; and we 
follow our pursuits on this day &#59; what then can they learn &#63; is 
not our good instruction more than counterbalanced by our own 
transgression &#63; Again we complain&#44; that our children will not 
attend at the Synagogue&#44; despite of our commands to that effect &#59; 
but we teach them the example&#44; by staying at home for every 
trifling excuse we can make to lull our inward accuser. &#8212; We tell 
them to abstain from forbidden food &#59; whilst we ourselves cease 
to be strict Jews&#44; as sogn as we leave a congregation. &#8212; We 
tell our children not to tell lies&#44; and not to calumniate or 
speak evil of others &#59; but they see daily&#44; how we prevaricate&#44; 
slander the innocent&#44; and misconstrue the words and deeds 
of others. &#8212; We tell our children to believe in the word of God&#44; 
to adhere to the faith of their ancestors &#59; and they nevertheless 
hear every now and then how we dispute in their presence 
about the fundamental parts of the law even&#44; not to mention 
the minor observances. &#8212; We tell our children&#44; how glorious 
a boon the Almighty has given us in bestowing his holy Torah 
on our ancestors &#59; but it is useless to hide from them&#44; that we 
are ashamed of being at times known as Jews&#44; as though it 
were a disgrace to be descended from that glorious people&#44; who 
were enlightened in a pure knowledge of the Creator&#44; and in 
possession of his wise and saving laws&#44; whilst the Egyptians 
worshipped beasts&#44; the Chaldeans the host of heaven&#44; the 
Phoenicians the Moloch&#44; and the Persians the fire &#59; whilst the 
Grecians were roving sea&#8211;robbers&#59; the Romans not in existence&#59; 
the Gauls and Germans savages roaming through their trackless&#44; 
swampy forests&#59; and whilst the Britons&#44; the predecessors of 
the proud English nation&#44; stalked about naked with their bodies 
painted blue&#44; like modern savages of some southern isle. And 
our children&#44; I assert&#44; must discover constantly by our manner&#44; 

    <pb n="308"/>

THE DUTY OF INSTRUCTION. 9 

that we are well nigh ashamed of being known as the posterity 
of the noble Israelitish people&#44; who were enlightened and reli&#8211; 
gious&#44; whilst the rest of the world was either sunk in barbarism 
or gross idolatry. And how again can our younger ones attain 
sufficient self&#8211;respect to avow their adherence to the Mosaic 
creed publicly&#44; when their guardians and parents are at so much 
pains constantly to surround themselves with those not belong&#8211; 
ing to the covenant&#44; whilst the Jew is excluded&#44; even from the 
Jew&#39;s house&#44; as though he were not fit to associate with the 
distinguished men and women of other sects&#63; Is it now to be 
wondered at&#44; that our children are daily growing more indiffer&#8211; 
ent to our holy religion &#63; that they ultimately throw off its yoke 
altogether&#63; and that we are compelled to call the Romanist&#44; 
the Protestant&#44; and the infidel&#44; by the endearing names of 
uncle&#44; aunt&#44; brother&#44; sister&#44; and cousin &#63; How can we be as&#8211; 
tonished&#44; that the followers of our faith are daily becoming 
fewer amongst our younger members&#44; when their education is 
so wretchedly defective&#44; as has been just exhibited to you &#63; 
And truly&#44; brethren&#44; if our religion were any thing but divine&#44; 
it must long since have died out in many countries&#44; and in this 
country in particular. But there is a germ of life in the insti&#8211; 
tutions handed down from Sinai&#44; which no misconduct of men 
can extinguish &#59; aye&#44; let every roll of the law &#40;but which God 
forfend) be ordered to the flames by some new persecutor yet 
unborn&#44; and let the teachers of our religion be all led out to 
execution : there would still arise teachers and books of the 
law from amid the slain adherents&#44; and from amid the ashes of 
the rolls&#44; and anew would the word be dispensed to the thirst&#8211; 
ing world &#59; for it is written&#44; that the law shall never depart 
from our mouth&#44; nor from the mouth of our remotest descend&#8211; 
ants. &#8212; But I digress&#59; the contemplation of the glorious perma&#8211; 
nence of the treasure preserved in yonder ark before us would 
lead me from my subject&#44; should I suffer my feelings to lead 
me on. &#39; To revert to our subject &#59; if we wish to do any thing 
to advance the cause of our religion&#44; we must begin to attend 
more carefully&#44; than we have been in the habit of doing&#44; to the 
education of our children&#44; so that each parent may have well 
founded hopes&#44; to see arising in his offspring a new generation 
of adherents to the law of God&#44; and have the satisfaction to

know&#44; that&#44; when he is departing to a better world&#44; his de&#8211; 
scendants have been so educated&#44; that he may look forward to 
meeting with them again before the throne of God in bliss and 
happiness. &#8212; Indeed&#44; no other repentance can be of any real 
good &#59; for whilst each man reforms only himself&#44; he has done 
but very little of what his God can with justice demand of him. 
Suppose a spirit should appear before the judgment of the Most 
High&#44; and be questioned what he had done with the charges 
entrusted to his care&#44; and be compelled to answer&#44; that one 
had forsaken the Synagogue for the church of Rome &#59; another 
had joined the Moslem&#44; and a third had become an atheist&#44; 
because he the father had neglected to teach them carefully the 
way they should go &#59; can it be supposed that happiness would 
be awarded to him &#63; No&#44; the voice of thunder would rever&#8211; 
berate in his ears with the dreadful doom : &#34; Be thou consigned 
to punishment&#44; till thy children have expiated their guilt&#44; for 
thou&#44; their parent&#44; and their sentinel&#44; hast neglected to obey 
the precept which sayeth: And thou shalt teach them carefully 
unto thy children&#44; and thou shalt speak of them&#44; when thou 
sittest in thy house&#44; when thou walkest by the way&#44; and when 
thou liest down&#44; and when thou risest up : and because being 
by God appointed their sentinel and guardian thou hast neglect&#8211; 
ed thy trust&#44; and been careless about warning them of the 
danger they were running by entering the way of sin.&#34; &#8212; 
Would this not be a doom deserved by a parent so acting&#63; and 
how many expose themselves daily to it by their entire or 
partial forgetfulness of the sacred trust reposed in them &#59; for&#44; 
brethren&#44; you must know&#44; that the children with which we 
may be blest are not to be looked upon as our sole property&#44; 
and whose religious education we are permitted to neglect or 
promote as may suit our fancy&#59; on the contrary&#44; they are like 
something left by one person in the safe&#8211;keeping of another&#44; 
who receives pay for the trouble he may be at for watching the 
property entrusted to him&#44; but which may be demanded back 
at any moment&#44; unhurt and entire. The parents must&#44; there&#8211; 
fore&#44; take all the pains they are capable of&#44; to instruct their 
children in infancy in their duties&#44; and to show them such 
an example of righteousness in their own persons&#44; that they 
may never be induced either to despise their parents for

their impiety&#44; or to neglect the instruction they receive &#59; and 
when the age of infancy is passed&#44; care should be taken&#39; that 
the lessons of childhood be not eifaced by the license or temp&#8211; 
tation held out&#44; or by downright compulsion to forsake the path 
of religion. If&#44; after all&#44; our offspring should not be according 
to our expectations&#44; we have done our duty&#44; we have warned 
them&#44; and their blood will be on their own heads. 

Brethren&#44; long since have I wished to address you upon this 
very important subject&#59; and I must ask your indulgence for 
having detained you so much longer than it is my custom to 
do. But I need not tell you&#44; that what has been said this day&#44; 
is not half sufficient to discuss the subject in any way commen&#8211; 
surate with its importance&#59; my object was merely to draw your 
attention seriously to this matter&#44; little doubting&#44; but that your 
own reflections will fill up whatever is defective in this slight 
sketch. &#8212; To you&#44; therefore&#44; fathers in Israel&#44; do I address my&#8211; 
self&#59; devote some more time to the personal superintendence 
over the education of your children&#44; and do not leave their 
future happiness entirely to pensioned strangers&#44; who but too 
often think themselves absolved from all responsibility&#44; when 
their scholars are perfect in their lessons&#59; as they say&#44; and 
perhaps with justice&#44; that they are not chosen to teach religion 
and morality&#44; but only the usual routine of sciences and ac&#8211; 
complishments&#44; some of which are&#44; at best&#44; of doubtful useful&#8211; 
ness&#33; &#8212; And you&#44; who are mothers in the house of Jacob&#44; listen 
I pray you&#44; to the advice of a brother&#44; though he be young 
and not as experienced or as virtuous as many of you. In 
your power it is to produce a great reformation in the state of 
our youths. It is said by our wise men: &#34; That for the merit 
of pious women our ancestors were redeemed from Egypt &#59;&#34; 
and I am confident&#44; that even to this day true devotion and true 
piety dwell in many a bosom of the virgins and matrons of our 
people. Try&#44; then&#44; your gentle power of persuasion&#44; which 
you can so powerfully exert &#59; lead your children and your 
wards in the way they should go &#59; point out to them the deceits 
of transgression &#59; tell them how many a noble mind has been 
wrecked upon the devious way of sin&#44; and how many an hum&#8211; 
ble orphan has been raised to eminence&#44; solely by the pursuit 
of virtue&#44; based upon the revelation from Sinai. &#8212; If even some

hours usually devoted to pleasure and recreation should have 
to be abstracted for this arduous undertaking&#44; you will be suf&#8211; 
ficiently rewarded&#44; when 3&#39;ou see your sons grow up round 
your table like the sprouts of the olive in the fertile field&#44; with 
vigorous minds dwelling in uncorrupted bodies. &#8212; If thus we 
are all united&#44; if the teacher&#44; the father&#44; and the mother all 
co&#8211;operate&#44; we may ultimately hope to see a race of firm be&#8211; 
lievers spring up in this country&#44; nay&#44; in this very town &#59; and 
the Synagogue which is now so often nearly empty&#44; will then 
be filled by adorers anxious to hasten to the house of God&#59; we 
shall then not be ashamed of being told&#44; that professing Jews 
partook of the flesh of the prohibited swine in public&#59; we shall 
then not be mortified by finding one Jew despising the other&#44; 
and joining himself in wedlock to the stranger&#59; we shall then 
not be shocked by the public profanation of the Sabbath and fes&#8211; 
tivals&#44; whereas we now witness&#44; perhaps this very day&#44; people 
attending to their usual occupations in open violation of our law. 

As I said&#44; in the beginning of this discourse&#44; this is the 
season of repentance&#44; and the beginning&#8211; of a new year after 
the creation. Shall we not resolve to begin this new period in 
a new and better manner &#63; shall it be said&#44; that year after year 
none of us has amended a faulty life &#63; No&#44; let it be our en&#8211; 
deavour to prove that we have removed the obduracy of our 
hearts&#44; that the heavenly legacy is still dear to our souls&#44; and 
that having been warned&#44; we have been roused to reflection&#44; 
to adoration&#44; and repentance. &#8212; We have heard the voice of the 
cornet&#44; the call of the Lord has been sounded in our dwellings&#59; 
let it animate us to reconsider our doings and to reform the 
evil of our ways &#59; and may we thus deserve to have the decree 
recorded for our benefit and happiness in the book of remem&#8211; 
brance before our everlasting Judge&#44; when the Day of Atone&#8211; 
ment closes: &#34; My children&#44; your sins are forgiven &#33;&#34; 

adorable and unending One&#33; shower over us thy grace and 
protection &#59; let thy wisdom fill our souls &#59; so that&#44; taught of 
Thee&#44; we may be led to a perfect understanding of our duties&#44; 
and know fully the end of our appointment on earth. Lead us 
far from the way of temptation and of contempt&#44; and preserve 
us entire in our dispersion &#59; and let thy mercy prevail&#44; when 
Thou sealest on the approaching Day of Forgiveness of sin

Father of Mercy &#33; who art so highly elevated above 
every thing existing&#44; that even the utmost extent of the uni&#8211; 
verse cannot contain Thee : deign to display thy glory over us&#44; 
and to dwell in the hearts of those of thy children as are of 
devout heart and contrite spirit. So that all mankind may be 
convinced&#44; that to Thee alone&#44; everlasting One&#44; appertain 
the glory&#44; the majesty&#44; and the dominion over all&#44; and be led 
to worship Thee only&#44; in truth and sincerity. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 
Many of you may have heard ridicule cast upon what some 
term the arrogance of the Hebrews in styling themselves the 
chosen people. For our opponents say&#44; that all earth belongs 
to God&#44; and it is unworthy of his greatness to select the fewest 
of people as his peculiar treasure. Besides they aver&#44; that we 
do not show such a superiority above other classes of men as 
would justly entitle us to a distinction so proud&#44; even granting 
that God had chosen us. &#8212; Others again say&#44; that in truth we 
have once been actually the chosen people&#44; but that now we 
are rejected for our rebellious conduct. &#8212; We will briefly ex&#8211; 
amine all these objections&#44; and see whether it is beneath the 
dignity of God to have one people to whom He&#44; the All&#8211;wise&#44;

attaches more importance than to any other &#59; whether we pos&#8211; 
sess any superiority&#59; and&#44; lastly&#44; if it be consonant with Reve&#8211; 
lation&#44; that we should have been rejected after having been 
once chosen. 

We know from the whole tenor of the history of mankind&#44; 

that the children of man in the early ages&#44; as well as in later 

times&#44; did transgress those bounds of righteousness which the 

Almighty had marked out for their guidance. Misled by pride&#44; 

blinded by passion&#44; and heedless of consequences&#44; they followed 

the counsels of their wicked hearts&#44; and said to God : &#34; Go 

away from us.&#34; Till their crimes had readied a height no 

longer tolerable to the just and wise Creator &#59; when He opened 

the windows of heaven&#44; split the fountains of the mighty deep&#44; 

and the rushing&#44; surging waters of the flood swept off the sinful 

race from the face of the earth. But in punishing the sinners&#44; 

the Merciful was not unconscious of the work of his hands&#44; and 

He saved from amidst the destruction the man who had been 

righteous and upright in his generation &#59; and Noah was thus 

saved to repeople the earth&#44; and he became in this manner the 

second father to the intelligent inhabitants of the globe. 

To him also were given statutes and commandments&#44; by 
which a man might walk in the way of righteousness&#59; but his 
descendants also forgot very soon&#44; like the nations before the 
flood had done&#44; their duties towards God&#44; and they instituted 
worships which they had invented through their fancy&#44; and 
they obeyed laws which were counter to the revelation given 
to Noah. &#8212; You will thus see&#44; that twice the world had an 
example of a universal and uniform revelation&#44; and twice also 
an example of the forgetfulness by the world of a revelation 
given to all. The parallel holds good even farther. For&#44; as 
before the flood there was one man righteous more than his 
generation : thei&#39;e also was found in the second general corrup&#8211; 
tion of manners one pre&#8211;eminent for his signal piety&#59; this man&#44; 
as you all know&#44; and as we have noticed on prior occasions&#44; 
was Abraham. We need not recapitulate his history&#44; any 
farther than to mention that God made with him a covenant&#44; 
as the Bible calls it&#44; to make his descendants a people peculiarly 
chosen to the service of God&#44; and that they should observe the 
precepts which the Lord had or should ordain. &#8212; You will ob&#8211;

serve&#44; brethren&#44; that which has just been said will answer the 
first objection started above. The Ahnighty had found&#44; that 
as human nature was constituted&#44; and observing the situation 
of mankind at that period&#44; it would not answer any good pur&#8211; 
pose to give a general revelation for a third time&#59; for we have 
every reason to think that a law so given would have been 
disregarded again and again&#44; and every succeeding generation 
would have departed further from the truth&#44; if it had been the 
common legacy of all&#44; and consequently not valued because of 
its universality. It was therefore that God called Abraham to 
his service&#44; after he had displayed his devotion amidst idolaters&#44; 
that is to say&#44; that the laws given to Noah had found in him a 
faithful adherent&#44; despite the general aberration with which he 
was on all sides surrounded. Abraham was therefore told&#44; that 
he should be blessed&#44; and that at length all nations should be 
blessed through him. What now was the consequence of the 
promise to Abraham &#63; what in fact could it be &#63; It was&#44; that 
to his descendants there should be given a law&#44; a code&#44; of uni&#8211; 
versal application and of everlasting duration &#59; this was a bless&#8211; 
ing to Abraham himself&#44; and one which alone could bless 
ultimately all nations of the earth &#59; for in the spread of the 
tenets of truth every human being can lay a claim to a portion 
of the blessing flowing from such an event&#59; but let conquest 
be extended ever so far&#44; the conquered must suffer&#44; for there 
can be no conquest without sufferers&#59; and riches distributed in 
unbounded plenty will not satisfy the cravings of cupidity and 
the discontents of envy&#44; even if every human being were to be 
placed above want. But truth spread&#44; as we have said&#44; univer&#8211; 
sally abroad&#44; distributed to all human beings alike&#44; is indeed 
that species of treasure through which none are made to suffer&#44; 
and which leaves no room to excite the discontent of the 
envious. 

But&#44; brethren&#44; whilst feeling within ourselves&#44; how great the 
blessing is we possess in the revealed law of our God&#44; we must 
not overlook the astonishing evidence of the most unsearchable 
wisdom which is displayed in the whole arrangement of its 
promulgation. Observe : &#8212; if God had descended in the utmost 
state of majesty&#44; and revealed himself to Abraham&#44; to Isaac&#44; or 
to Jacob&#44; assume the magnificence to have been even exceeding 

    <pb n="315"/>

the descent on Sinai : still it would have been a revelation to 
individuals&#44; and succeeding generations would have doubted 
the evidence of one man&#44; who&#44; though ever so good&#44; might 
have been misled&#44; or might be presumed to relate a falsehood 
in order to magnify his own importance. Therefore a limited 
number of statutes only was given to the patriarchs&#44; which they 
were ordered to observe&#44; and to teach their descendants after 
them. This state of dawning light lasted for about four centu&#8211; 
ries &#59; ray after ray of light had been gradually dispensed&#44; &#8212; 
Adam &#8212; Hanoch &#8212; Noah &#8212; Abraham &#8212; Isaac &#8212; Jacob &#8212; Joseph &#8212; 
and perhaps others&#44; of whom no account has come down to our 
days&#44; because it has no material bearing on the subject of re&#8211; 
vealed religion&#44; had the Word of God made known to them &#59; 
thousands upon thousands of the children of the covenant had 
been added to the original stock of one father and one mother &#59; 
labour and distress appeared to weigh down their spirits as 
well as bodies &#59; all hope had well nigh been extinguished in 
the bosoms of Pharaoh&#39;s bondmen : when suddenly a light&#44; 
not a ray merely&#44; but a bright luminary&#44; burst forth &#59; &#8212; it was 
a Moses&#44; aided by a benevolent Aaron&#44; both true shepherds&#44; 
chosen from among the million&#44; that appeared to fulfil the aim 
of God&#39;s intention. And it therefore came to pass in those 
days&#44; that the glory of our Father was manifestly displayed&#44; 
and guided by his care Israel went out with rejoicing and glad&#8211; 
ness to meet their Supreme Ruler at the foot of the holy Sinai. 
&#8212; Here the consummation of the calling of&#39; Abraham was 
brought about by the legation of Moses&#44; and the revelation of 
God was made visible and audible to all the people. And thus 
not to one great man&#44; but to at least three millions of intelligent 
beings was confided a light&#44; a treasure&#44; a fruitful source of 
blessing&#44; which will in the course of time enlighten&#44; enrich&#44; 
bless&#44; and nourish all nations of the earth. &#8212; If then a caviller 
should ask us : &#34; Why do you believe in the divine legation of 
Moses &#63;&#34; we may boldly answer : Because there were present 
the individuals of an entire people&#44; who all were witnesses of 
the truth of the revelation from Horeb&#44; since all ultimately 
acquiesced in the rule thus divinely made known&#44; and because 
these very&#39; persons rose up in an incredible short time into a 
nation wiser than their former task&#8211;masters&#44; different from them 

    <pb n="316"/>

in language&#44; manners&#44; and associations of ideas&#44; and proved 
themselves in possession of a rule of life&#44; and of notions con&#8211; 
cerning the Deity&#44; far above in purity and truth to aught that 
had ever been attained by the Egyptians themselves&#44; their 
predecessors&#44; or their followers&#44; nay&#44; even to this very day. &#8212; 
Shall we say&#44; that a nation of abject&#44; timid&#44; leprous slaves &#40;for 
this is the character given of the Israelites) could rise in forty 
years to a height so unparalleled by the instruction of one man&#44; 
who had past the age of eighty&#44; and who must be supposed to 
have partaken already largely of the infirmities of age at 
this period &#63; You&#44; my brethren&#44; would no doubt think&#44; that 
the opinion I have just now stated is too ridiculous to be enter&#8211; 
tained by an intelligent mind &#59; yet it has been entertained by 
the unbelievers&#44; and forms their chief point in explaining upon 
merely natural grounds the rise of our people during their 
wanderings in the wilderness. Yet even grant the objection a 
thousand times more importance than it deserves&#44; say even it 
is true : we then should have a miracle still greater than we 
claim to have been performed. &#8212; For our slavery in Egypt is 
undoubted and undenied even by the heathen. Secondly&#44; our 
wanderings in the wilderness are also considered authentic. 
Thirdly&#44; our having a written law different from the written 
law of any other nation is undeniable. Fourthly&#44; it must be 
inferred&#44; that if the Egyptian priests had had a private or 
secret law taught in their mysteries not hitherto promulged to 
the people&#44; they would certainly have been able&#44; and no doubt 
would have attempted&#44; to counteract Moses&#44; by making known 
the same powerful instrument which he had just imparted to 
the Israelites. Fifthly&#44; it does not bear contradiction that the 
Israelites after hovering for forty years about the confines of 
civilized countries&#44; which they were not permitted to enter&#44; 
conquered Palestine and drove out the inhabitants. Now the 
simple question is&#44; how were the Egyptians induced to forego 
the labour of six hundred thousand slaves &#63; Did their huma&#8211; 
nity prompt them to this act of benevolence &#63; &#8212; Further &#59; &#8212; why 
did those slaves enter a frightful wilderness &#63; why did they 
not at once attack a fertile settlement &#63; &#8212; Again&#44; whence did 
they obtain their peculiar statutes &#63; &#8212; And granted they were 
derived from Egyptian sources&#44; what is the reason that the

worship of the Egyptians was in most respects so different &#63; 
And lastly&#44; how did so immense a number of men find subsist&#8211; 
ence in a wilderness where there is not even water to drink &#63; 
If&#44; therefore&#44; we even grant to Moses a n)ind unlike that which 
any other man ever possessed&#44; and a vigour of body but little 
less than angelic: it must still be self&#8211;evident that the workings 
which took place under his administration are too extraordi&#8211; 
nary to have been the result of ordinary human labour. We 
have therefore the strongest evidence of the concurrent testi&#8211; 
mony of our entire people and of a mass of unbroken chains of 
events to establish the reasonableness of a belief in the selection 
of Israel as a people chosen by God to hold&#44; as a depositary&#44; a 
law which was in the first instance to guide them&#44; and at 
length all other families of the earth. &#8212; And in the manner of 
the selection of Israel&#44; I allude to the manner of their prepa&#8211; 
ratory education by a long series of calamities&#44; we must also 
discover the marks of profound wisdom. If the law had been 
given to an opulent people&#44; living in a fruitful country&#44; it might 
have happened&#44; that being too much devoted to afiairs of life&#44; 
the study of the law would have become a secondary con&#8211; 
sideration with them&#44; especially if they would have had to sub&#8211; 
ject themselves to many inconveniences under the new law. 
But what did God do to implant the law in the hearts of the 
Israelites&#63; &#8212; He caused Jacob to go down to Egypt&#44; impelled 
through love for Joseph &#59; there his descendants multiplied and 
became a numerous nation as had been predicted. And when 
the jealousy of the rulers of the land became excited&#44; the All&#8211; 
wise One did not interfere to prevent the contemplated oppres&#8211; 
sion&#44; foreseeing that it&#44; though protracted from age to age&#44; 
would in the best manner subserve to his wise views. But 
when the Egyptians&#44; emboldened by the impunity they had so 
long enjoyed&#44; began to threaten the extermination of their 
servants&#44; as soon as they declared their will of going counter to 
the permission hitherto tacitly extended : the arm of our God 
was interposed&#44; and the oppressed were freed from bondage&#44; 
and led&#44; as you all know&#44; through the desert&#44; after having 
passed the Red Sea&#44; to the foot of Sinai. Miracle after miracle&#44; 
some natural&#44; some preternatural&#44; had been wrought&#44; to prove to 
them how powerful&#44; how kind&#44; how wise&#44; how infinite was the 

    <pb n="318"/>

THE SELECTION OF ISRAEL. 19 

God whom their ancestors had worshipped&#44; and to illustrate&#44; in 
the most striking manner&#44; that the promises made to the good 
will always be kept&#44; and the reward of their virtuous deeds 
will surely come&#44; though delayed for a period&#44; for reasons 
unknown to short&#8211;sighted man. Thus delivered and thus pro&#8211; 
tected&#44; our ancestors were notified that their Deliverer would 
manifest unto them his glory&#44; and make known to them his 
laws. They declared their willingness&#44; with hearts glowing 
with gratitude&#44; and minds filled with adoration. The law was 
then given&#44; to the people thus chosen &#59; and though they occa&#8211; 
sionally rebelled&#44; yet their situation was so that the law of God 
constantly became renewed as often as his power was displayed&#59; 
and this state of their national infancy was consumed by wan&#8211; 
dering for forty years in the desert&#44; where at length the heavenly 
code was so firmly cemented among them&#44; that even now it is 
inextinguishable in the heart of every Israelite. &#8212; Understand 
me well&#44; I do not wish to be understood as saying&#44; that it would 
have been out of the power of God to effect an instantaneous 
change of heart among the Hebrews&#44; or to communicate his will 
at the same moment to all men &#59; but merely as proving that 
God pursued a course&#44; eminently calculated&#44; more so indeed 
than any other our imagination can conceive&#44; to make his law 
acceptable to the Israelites and permanent among their descend&#8211; 
ants&#44; short of changing human nature &#59; which last procedure 
would evidently have been in opposition to the divine economy&#59; 
and that having once given to his code of pure laws and morality 
a lasting and imperishable abode on earth &#59; he at the same time 
had already provided for it a way to the hearts of all mankind&#44; 
who as we have every reason to believe will all ultimately for&#8211; 
sake each his idols of silver&#44; and each his idols of gold&#44; to serve 
Him&#44; the Lord&#44; in sincerity and righteousness. And says 
Isaiah&#44; in the spirit of inspiration : &#34; And 1 will show a sign on 
them&#44; and I will send from them refugees to the nations Tar&#8211; 
shish&#44; Pul and Lud&#44; those that draw the bow&#44; Tubal and Yavan&#44; 
the far islands&#44; that have not heard my fame&#44; and have not seen 
my glory&#44; and they shall tell of my glory among the nations &#59; 
Ixvi. 19. &#8212; What then can be found derogatory to the greatness 
of God in his choosing our nation &#63; Had not our ancestors 
remained ever true to his statutes &#63; Had we not suffered in 
Egypt the necessary schooling to fit us for this great object &#63; 

    <pb n="319"/>

20 THE SELECTION OF ISRAEL. 

And what is more&#44; have we not answered the purpose of our 
selection &#63; Ask of the civilized world&#44; who were the heralds 
of civilization &#33; &#8212; Ask of the philanthropist&#44; who first taught 
mercy to mankind &#33; &#8212; Ask the philosopher&#44; who first pro&#8211; 
claimed the unity of God &#33; &#8212; Ask the preacher&#44; where he 
derives his system of beneficent morality and religion which 
he upholds &#33; &#8212; and all must answer&#44; if they speak the truth&#44; it 
is from the Israelites that all these blessings have flowed unto 
mankind &#59; no other nation had a hand in laying the foundation 
of these great benefits &#59; and they again have derived all from the 
Supreme Teacher&#44; for not the most profound wisdom and expe&#8211; 
rience of men could ever devise any thing half so good and 
beautiful. &#8212; And therefore says the Bible : 

&#34; But you the Lord has taken and brought you out from the iron furnace 
from Egypt&#44; to be to Him a nation of inheritance&#44; as we see this day.&#34; 

Deuteronomy iv. 20. 

The perfect reasonableness of all we have just advanced&#44; sup&#8211; 
ported as it is by revelation&#44; experience&#44; and common sense&#44; 
will be sufficient to answer the first objection&#44; although much 
more can be said&#44; the subject being far from exhausted&#44; by the 
few illustrations which I have laid before you. But the space 
which an address ought to occupy prevents me from going into 
the matter more in detail at present&#44; although it is highly pro&#8211; 
bable&#44; that I may recur to it at another time. &#8212; We will&#44; there&#8211; 
fore&#44; now proceed to the second objection : &#34; What have the 
Israelites gained by their selection &#63;&#34; We are asked&#44; where 
are our palaces&#63; &#8212; where our splendid temples&#63; &#8212; where our 
kings&#63; &#8212; where our national government&#63; &#8212; and what gain 
has a Jew by maintaining his identity&#44; living as he does 
among the multitude who differ from him in laws&#44; in habits&#44; 
and in feelings&#63; &#8212; To these questions&#44; we answer&#44; if national 
grandeur is to be the sole criterion of the importance of 
a people&#44; we have no importance to boast of &#59; and what is 
more&#44; it is extremely doubtful if ever we had many splen&#8211; 
did buildings in the height of our glory&#44; as but one temple 

    <pb n="320"/>

was permitted &#59; and in vain does any one inquire for the 
existence of stupendous works of art which properly belong 
to us alone. Our kings have in truth long ceased to reign&#44; 
and our national government has been dissolved&#44; and our 
people scattered to all climes of heaven. Of power on earth&#44; 
of importance among nations we have no share&#44; not even the 
smallest if properly viewed&#44; any further than the wealth of a 
few individuals has ever been able to afford us. &#8212; But if we 
come to the benefits of the mind &#8212; to the elevation of the 
soul &#8212; to a purity of worship &#8212; to hopes of a glorious futurity &#8212; 
there&#44; indeed&#44; we are blessed above all tongues and nations &#33; 
What care we for palaces as marks of glory &#63; whilst we have 
the precious law as our portion &#59; what can nations boast of 
their splendid temples&#63; when our house of God&#44; the house of 
prayer for all nations&#44; will one day be rebuilt in splendour&#44; far 
outshining all earthly glory &#59; what care we for kings &#8212; for 
governments&#63; when we daily see the power passing away from 
the powerful&#44; and the sceptre hourly wrenched out of the hands 
of princes. But we have in our scattered state even a bond of 
union which binds our hearts to our God and holds us in 
unseen embrace as one people &#59; which makes us observed and 
watched by all mankind &#59; which opens for us the way to the 
favour of God &#59; which unlocks for us the gates of salvation &#59; 
which admits us daily and hourly into the portals of wisdom 
and the fear of the Lord &#8212; which&#44; in short&#44; confers all that can 
make an existence happy and useful &#59; and this is the advantage&#44; 
brethren&#44; which is conferred by the law &#8212; the law given from 
Sinai &#59; the law which has stood the tempests of oppression and 
the ravages of time &#8212; and yet stands unseared&#44; with its lustre 
undiminished &#33; And this law it is which makes us a great 
nation&#44; a people assisted of the Lord&#44; who is the shield of our 
salvation. Aye &#33; truly now we look unsightly&#44; our counte&#8211; 
nance is marred&#44; our bodies are bruised by the blows of those 
that hate us&#44; and we are regarded as struck by God and afflicted. 
But we need not fear&#44; our countenance will be healed&#44; our 
wounds will be bound up &#59; and though the blows fall again and 
again upon our devoted heads&#44; though ever so often despised&#44; and 
called a people stricken for transgressions which we have not 
committed&#44; and persecuted for sins not our own : yet the day

will come when it will be acknowledged that our sufferings 
have been cause of happiness to the nations&#44; who then will see 
the effects arising from a disobedience to the Divine Will&#44; and 
they will all accept the law which&#44; infringed&#44; made us unhappy&#44; 
and which obeyed once did&#44; and will again&#44; make us the light 
and the glory of the world. In the meantime let storms assail 
us &#8212; let us be derided for our littleness &#8212; let kings and nations 
attempt to stamp upon and extinguish the small remnant: the 
end of us will be far happier than theirs&#44; and we will be great 
when the names of our adversaries will only be remembered as 
curses and as warnings. Like the mighty river whose source is 
so small that the foolish may deem he can obstruct the fountain 
by placing his foot upon the insignificant orifice&#44; or over whose 
slender rill&#44; at its outset&#44; the thoughtless schoolboy jumps to 
show that he can bestride the mighty water &#59; but which&#44; at 
length&#44; mingles its rushing waves with the flood of the ocean&#44; 
and bears on its bosom the largest fleet&#44; heedless of the 
attempted obstruction or of the childish ridicule : thus do we 
pursue&#44; though alas &#33; as unconsciously often as the lifeless river&#44; 
our course towards better times&#44; but which we retard by 
neglecting the duties which would cause us to live and prosper 
if we would be mindful of them &#59; &#8212; yet even in this way do we 
instruct the world&#44; and like the stream which makes fruitful 
its banks and blesses thus the country through which it runs&#44; 
we bestow the waters of life everlasting upon the nations of the 
earth&#44; in whose lands we now live. If we are then asked&#44; 
what advantages we have for opposing ourselves to the opinions 
of the majority&#63; we answer&#44; we only fulfil our destiny&#44; the 
object of the call of our father Abraham&#44; fo whom God said &#59; 
&#34; All nations of the earth shall through thee be blessed.&#34; This 
certainty is too sweet to be exchanged for worldly goods or for 
offices on earth&#33; Let the nations then be ever so great&#59; let 
them lord it over our people&#44; and be it ever our lot to be the 
humble&#44; the poor&#44; the despised Jews : yet are we ever the 
greatest&#44; and most wonderful and beneficial community&#44; as from 
us and from our holy Bible light&#44; and civilization&#44; and morality&#44; 
and love of God&#44; have spnead for ages&#44; and will continue so 
to extend these blessings till it be accomplished what was the 
original intention of God. 

    <pb n="322"/>

THE SELECTION OF ISRAEL. 23 

Thus it came to pass&#44; that we have stood the storms which 
have at all times assailed us &#59; for it was our God who always 
watched over us. and no empire ever so mighty and wise can 
prevail against Him&#44; This was strikingly exemplified when 
the Syrian king&#44; Antiochus&#44; swept like a whirlwind over 
Judaea&#59; the righteous mourned&#44; for the brave were slain&#59; and 
the priests wept in private&#44; for the altar was desolate. A hea&#8211; 
then worship was proclaimed&#44; and it was death to call upon the 
Lord of heaven. If ever our religion was seemingly nigh its 
downfal&#44; it was surely at that dark period&#44; when the foreign 
enemy and the infidels at home conspired to destroy the sanc&#8211; 
tuary and to uproot the seeds of righteousness. &#8212; But He who 
throneth in heaven smiled&#44; the Lord looked upon the noise of 
the heathens with contempt&#44; and He smote them&#44; as it were 
with an iron staff&#44; and shivered them like potter&#39;s ware. And 
He raised unto the remnant of Jacob&#39;s house a helper from 
among them&#44; and Judah Maccabeus avenged the house of God 
defiled&#44; the altar broken&#44; and the worshippers slaughtered &#59; and 
in grateful remembrance of the mighty deliverance from anni&#8211; 
hilation&#44; the eight days of Haniickah were instituted as a 
memorial for everlasting. Since that period&#44; our enemies have&#44; 
not pretermitted their exertions &#59; they still have taken counsel 
against the Lord and his chosen people &#59; but all their efibrts 
have resulted in utter discomfiture &#59; and though they have suc&#8211; 
ceeded in gaining the interested and timid&#44; the great multitude 
of us have either met their death in defence of our law&#44; or 
have lived whilst steadfastly maintaining it. And a Titus and 
a Hadrian&#44; though one burnt the temple&#44; and the other passed 
the plough over Jerusalem&#44; a host of persecutors armed with 
physical and spiritual terrors&#44; the horrid inquisition&#44; and lastly&#44; 
the subtle associations who&#44; with the power of worldly wealth&#44; 
or the allurements of offices and distinctions&#44; attempted to call 
off our brethren from their allegiance to God &#8212; have all shared 
an equal disappointment&#44; and they have all had to acknowledge 
that it is useless to attempt a war with Heaven. And thus said 
David : 

    <pb n="323"/>

24 THE SELECTION OF ISRAEL. 

&#34; And where is a single people on earth like thy people Israel&#44; for whose 
sake a deity has gone to redeem them to him as a people&#44; and to make him&#8211; 
self a name.&#34; 2 Samuel vii. 23. 

It will thus be seen&#44; that our selection was made for the 
purpose of rendering the name of God glorious among the na&#8211; 
tions&#44; and to bring all mankind ultimately to the knowledge of 
the righteous way &#59; as the prophet says : &#34; And the nations 
shall go by thy light and kings by the brightness of thy shin&#8211; 
ing&#59;&#34; and the period when this will be accomplished will be 
a time of universal peace&#44; and of the reign of a knowledge of 
the Lord. Is this object of sufficient importance to have war&#8211; 
ranted the Supreme Wisdom&#44; to select unto himself a people 
peculiarly beloved above all others&#63; and is a destiny thus glo&#8211; 
rious not sufficiently great to make every Israelite feel gratified 
at the knowledge of belonging to the descendants of Abraham&#63; 
Surely&#44; brethren&#44; if we are not totally immersed in the whirl&#8211; 
pool of selfishness and pursuits of vain aggrandizement: we 
must be satisfied&#44; even without worldly splendour&#44; with the 
consciousness that our beautiful system will survive all existing 
institutions&#44; and that the remotest posterity of our tyrants and 
oppressors shall at length be brought to bow before the same 
altar with the children of Israel. It behoves&#44; therefore&#44; that 
every Hebrew do his share towards sanctifying God&#39;s name&#44; 
and endeavour to fulfil the prediction of the prophet : &#34;And I 
will be great&#44; and sanctified&#44; and be known before the eyes of 
many nations&#44; and they shall know that I am the Lord&#33;&#34; And 
do you&#44; my brethren&#44; who listen now to me&#44; impress it deeply 
on your minds&#44; and tell it to your friends and to your children&#44; 
that not yet has it become of no moment to belong to the 
chosen people &#59; but that neither is it enough to be only a Jew 
by name. No &#33; we should rise from our supineness&#44; avow 
boldly our sentiments&#44; not fear to be ridiculed because we 
thank God in our prayers&#44; that He has chosen us from all na&#8211; 
tions&#59; and act just so as this proud eminence demands of us. 
Let us support the cause of religion&#44; teach its precepts&#44; and 
never omit any opportunity to display our confidence in our 
heavenly Father&#44; and our subjection to his will. 

Most merciful One&#44; who hast ever been so kind and boun&#8211;

their prayer ascends to thy abode in heaven. Amen.

Note. &#8212; The continuation of this address will be found under Discourse 
XXXII. &#8212; Soon after the above was written&#44; I was seized with a fearful mala&#8211; 
dy&#44; which prevented me from continuing ray labours till after a long and 
painful interruption. I do not vvish to drag myself personally before the 
public &#59; but I cannot refrain from mentioning&#44; that being supposed on the 
point of death&#44; my only brother hastened from a distance to my bedside. It 
pleased our heavenly Father to afflict him with the same disease. Although 
robust&#44; and to all appearance of that physical construction&#44; as to render his 
long surviving me almost a matter of certainty : he yet sunk under his suf&#8211; 
ferings&#44; and tranquil and resigned he breathed out his pure spirit in the 
hands of Him who gave it&#44; in the twenty&#8211;fifth year of his age&#59; beloved by 
many&#44; and hated by none. &#8212; The recollection of his death is doubly agonizing&#44; 
because he had lo receive from friendly strangers the kindness and atten&#8211; 
tion that ought to have been rendered by his brother&#44; who was kept from his 
couch of sickness by sufferings of unspeakable intensity and horror. &#8212; I ask 
the indulgence of the reader for tliis digression &#59; but I could not let this op&#8211; 
portunity pass&#44; without passing a slight tribute to one so worthy and inno&#8211; 
cent as was my deceased&#44; my only brother&#44; Jacob Leeser.

26 THE DUTY OF ACTIVE BENEVOLENCE. 

Brethren &#33; 

We are taught in the books of Holy Writ&#44; not to look upon 
this life as the chief period of our existence&#59; nor upon the 
goods of the earth&#44; the material possessions&#44; as the greatest ac&#8211; 
quirement&#59; nor&#44; lastly&#44; upon sensual pleasures as the highest 
enjoyment. &#8212; And seeing that every thing here below is transi&#8211; 
tory&#44; even the most careless observer is very apt to acquiesce 
in the idea&#44; that life is short and its pleasures uncertain &#59; yet 
there are few&#44; indeed&#44; who are led on to a virtuous and godly 
life through a contemplation of the vicissitudes to which they 
are subject. Indeed&#44; if we look at the haste with which we 
all run after gain &#59; the efforts we make to lay up treasures&#44; and 
the perseverance with which we pursue to our dying day the 
phantom pleasure : we should be led to suppose&#44; that we be&#8211; 
lieved ourselves thus engaged in fulfilling the object of our 
existence. And to confess the truth&#44; many&#44; if not all of us&#44; 
think they have done every thing that was demanded of 
them&#44; if their wealth has increased a hundred&#8211;fold &#59; if their 
houses are splendid &#59; if their appointment is grand&#44; and if the 
voice of mirth is never ceasing in their habitation&#33; They say: 
&#34; Life is short&#44; let us&#44; therefore&#44; enjoy its sweets &#59;&#34; and this 
heartless philosophy is in this manner the cause of many a life 
fooled away in vain pursuits and in endeavours which leave the 
soul wofully deficient in those riches which are to gain her an 
entrance into everlasting happiness. And yet what are riches&#63; 
Who has ever found his thirst for gold entirely gratified by 
immense possessions&#63; And say&#44; what is power&#63; Who was 
ever so powerful&#44; but he sighed foi&#8211; more worlds to conquer &#63; 
And speak&#44; what is pleasure&#63; When pain lurks among enjoy&#8211; 
ment&#44; and death rears his visage where all are gay &#63; It is in 
this spirit that David said &#40;Psalm xxxix. 13): &#34;Hear my 
prayer&#44; Lord&#33; list to my cry&#59; be not silent to my tears &#59; for 
a stranger I am with Thee&#44; a settler like all my forefathers.&#34; 
Here the inspired Psalmist expresses his ideas of his existence 
on earth. &#8211;&#34; For a stranger I am with Thee &#59;&#34; we are like 
strangers&#44; that enter an unknown land&#44; driven there by cir&#8211; 
cumstances beyond their control&#44; and who may be compelled 
to leave again as suddenly as they arrived&#44; or at best after a 

    <pb n="326"/>

short vvarninff. And let us understand the words &#34;with Thee&#59;&#34; 
we are&#44; whilst thus sojourning&#44; under the supervision of Him 
who sent us&#44; we are in his presence &#59; for although unseen&#44; He 
is felt every where&#44; for though unperceived by the human 
senses&#44; the whole world is full of his glory. &#8212; And&#44; continues 
David : &#34; A settler like all my forefathers.&#34; As our forefathers 
were here permitted to act their part and then were hidden 
from view&#44; removed from amidst the living : so are we tole&#8211; 
rated strangers&#44; suffered to take our abode for a time&#44; a very 
brief space of time like those who went before us&#44; till our day 
of removal also arrives&#44; when we are hurried away&#44; no matter 
how many engagements of business are incompleted&#44; how many 
houses left unfinished &#59; no matter if the festive meal be not 
half devoured&#44; whilst yet&#44; perhaps&#44; the mandate of the potent 
has scarcely been uttered to do some mighty work &#59; whilst yet 
the orator&#39;s words are on his lips&#44; and whilst the foot of beauty 
enchants the eye&#44; even of envy&#44; by its evolutions in the mazes 
of the dance. Why then should the spirit of mortal be proud.&#39;&#39; 
Or rather&#44; why should he not endeavour to live according to 
the will of Him&#44; with whom he is a stranger&#63; in whose world 
he is a sojourner&#63; through whose goodness he lives&#63; &#8212; This 
consideration brings us to the whole subject of active religious 
duties&#44; which consist not merely in abstaining from doing harm&#44; 
nor even in bestowing the superfluous and doing that which is 
easy of accomplishment &#59; but in a constant labour in the way of 
goodness&#44; in sacrificing interest&#44; and in doing things unpleasant 
and even contrary to our inclinations&#44; if they should chance to 
present themselves as a part of the work to be performed. &#8212; But 
some one may ask : &#34;Can religion then consist for the greatest 
part of self&#8211;denials and sacrifices of our interest&#63;&#34; Certainly&#59; 
and this is the reason why a religion was revealed&#44; to enable us 
to know when we ought to act counter to our inclination&#44; and 
when to sacrifice our possessions to the service of God. Of 
our own accord we could not know&#44; that we are bound lo give 
charity&#44; to assist the sick&#44; to feed the hungry&#44; to clothe the 
naked&#44; and to bury the dead. For although it is very conso&#8211; 
nant with the finer feelings of our nature&#44; to be engaged in 
these holy offices of kindness: still we find that there are some 
who not only abstain from fulfilling these duties&#44; but who do 

    <pb n="327"/>

28 THE DUTY OF ACTIVE BENEVOLENCE. 

just the opposite &#59; they refuse charity to the poor&#44; and even rob 
the orphan and the widow&#44; so as to render them dependent 
upon a merciless world &#59; some are so callous as to plunder the 
wounded soldier on the field of deadly combat&#44; and answer his 
cry for water to quench his thirst&#44; made intolerable by burning 
fever&#44; by a thrust with the dagger&#59; the miser will turn the 
shivering son of misery unheeded from his door&#59; and many 
will refuse the last rights of humanity to the departed&#44; because 
he is indebted to them for a little silver. All this proves&#44; that 
human nature required a guide to show it what is right and 
pleasing in the eyes of God. And even if we reject the above 
examples&#44; by saying&#44; that of extreme cases of depravity it is 
unfair to draw general rules as to the necessity of a revelation: 
still we may freely say&#44; that the religious duties&#44; properly so 
called&#44; as the observance of the Sabbath&#44; the restitution of 
lands in the fiftieth year&#44; the release of all bondmen&#44; and many 
other laws&#44; although in themselves strictly political &#40;not to 
mention the purely ceremonial) laws&#44; are not the natural off&#8211; 
spring of unassisted reason. But we wander from our subject&#59; 
all I meant to demonstrate is&#44; that religion in every instance is 
a guide to the feelings by which they are to be regulated &#59; and 
to attain perfection &#40;in as far as this quality is compatible with 
our nature) we should fill our minds with those ideas which are 
best calculated to induce an acquiescence in the divine will. 
Now&#44; where the duties demanded of us are mere pleasant 
exercises of humanity&#44; it will require but little efibrt to be 
religious&#59; for instance&#44; the welcoming of strangers&#59; the joyous 
reception of a bride &#59; the restoring of peace between offended 
brothers&#59; still these acts are in obedience to the dictates of the 
law&#44; and we must&#44; therefore&#44; believe that reward will follow 
our execution of them. But there are other deeds of humanity 
to which many may&#44; perhaps&#44; be indisposed from mere affec&#8211; 
tion &#59; and&#44; consequently&#44; to act in obedience to the will of 
Heaven in this respect&#44; requires more or less an effort to subdue 
unhallowed feelings&#44; and to yield ourselves to superior guid&#8211; 
ance. Among duties of this kind&#44; we may enumerate the 
redemption of prisoners&#44; the buying in of a relative&#39;s field &#59; the 
remission of debts in the sabbathic year &#59; restitution of pro&#8211; 
perty unlawfully obtained &#59; the restoring of pledges to the 

    <pb n="328"/>

debtor before sundown&#59; and many other duties enumerated in 
the law. Still&#44; though repugnance may be felt to the exercise 
of these precepts&#44; they are&#44; strictly speaking&#44; moral laws in 
contradistinction to the reliaiious ordinances&#59; and since they 
may be unpalatable to many&#44; we find the law of God remind&#8211; 
ing us of the obligation we are under to fulfil them&#44; and givfng 
us also reasons&#44; ichy we should be careful of their observance. 
It will easily strike you&#44; brethren&#44; what sinful feeling stands in 
the way&#44; when we are told to redeem from bondage a fellow&#8211; 
being. It is avarice&#44; however refined &#59; we speak not of where 
an actual inability exists &#59; but where one has the means in his 
possession and hesitates&#44; because he may allege that he need 
not spend his money for a friend&#44; who may never be .able to 
repay him&#44; or if able&#44; may be ungrateful enough to suffer him 
to lose by his humanity&#59; and he&#44; perhaps&#44; will also fancy to 
himself&#44; that his means are no more than he wants for his own 
use&#44; and that he cannot spare the least of them for the service 
of his Maker&#44; and the benefit of his fellow&#8211;man. Observe&#44; a 
personal unwillingness to do a duty of humanity never enters 
into the consideration &#59; this is always kept out of view&#44; to 
satisfy an uneasy conscience&#44; and to excuse a duty pretermit&#8211; 
ted&#59; and provided we can colour our selfishness with a sufficient 
show of argument&#44; we are perfectly easy&#44; as though we had 
done all that could reasonably be demanded of us. But&#44; though 
we may thus succeed in imposing upon the credulity of others 
and even upon ourselves&#44; for by a series of false reasoning 
every man may lay a flattering unction to his soul: we shall&#44; 
nevertheless&#44; not be altogether successful&#44; for there is One that 
searcheth the heart&#44; and knows the thoughts of man&#44; though 
they be vain. And thus&#44; even if we blind ourselves by 
talking of an inability to comply&#44; of ingratitude in those to 
be served&#44; or the like : we can never be able to hide the 
deformity of an indulged avarice from our heavenly Judge. 
And if we weigh his omniscience against our desire to retain 
what is once ours&#44; we no doubt will be willing to satisfy his 
demands&#44; since we are not able to escape his superintendence. 
Farther&#44; we should consider&#44; that it is by no means certain&#44; 
that we are not to lose the very amount we withhold&#44; even if 
we should not be deprived of all that we value so highly. I

need not tell you&#44; that of hundreds born in affluence the 
majority perhaps die in want &#8212; experience teaches that&#59; and 
if we inquire&#44; how does it happen that industry and means 
employed by one man do not yield the return which they 
yielded to another : we shall be answered&#44; the means of the one 
were blessed by God&#44; from those of the others the blessing was 
withheld. &#8212; Now&#44; how can a man suppose that it will be in his 
power to keep what he once possesses&#44; even by the greatest 
exertion of avarice&#44; when the power of the Bestower of wealth 
stands opposed to him &#63; And assume that he may succeed&#44; 
that all his plans yield the expected return&#44; as the fruit of his 
good calculation &#59; what has he at last obtained&#63; The favour of 
God&#63; for he cared not to spend his wealth in his service&#33; 
But he has acquired masses of shining metal &#59; fine houses in 
many a noble city&#59; lands rich in fruitfulness &#59; ships which 
cover the ocean&#44; and many obedient servants and fawning syco&#8211; 
phants eager for the refuse of his table. Can his expectations 
go farther &#63; and if they do&#44; can they be farther gratified &#63; He 
has worshipped an idol&#44; and it was given him &#59; what more can 
he ask&#63; but he cannot remain with this idol for ever&#44; and his 
wealth is left behind him to be dissipated by a careless spend&#8211; 
thrift&#44; or to be the bone of contention between disappointed 
heirs &#59; or even if he leaves it for charitable purposes&#44; it is 
extremely probable that his mind has become so contracted by 
pursuits of gain&#44; that he is unjust to the living after his death&#44; 
and he leaves those unprovided for who have a natural claim 
on his bounty But go yet farther and say&#44; that his wealth 
should be fairly and honourably divided&#44; and that perfect satis&#8211; 
faction should follow the division : still what merit can he have 
for his charity&#44; when it was only bestowed when he could no 
longer clutch it within his iron grasp &#63; Can this be pleasing to 
God&#63; &#8212; But observe&#44; that&#44; hitherto&#44; we have assumed a uniform 
good luck &#40;as it is termed) attending the efforts of him who 
refuses to give his bread to the poor&#44; and his money to the 
needy &#59; but we all know that success is not a necessary conse&#8211; 
quence of this line of conduct&#44;&#8211; any more than that poverty is the 
concomitant of liberality. &#8212; The question then arises : Since suc&#8211; 
cess is not always attending upon saving&#44; but upon the blessing 
of God&#44; shall we expose ourselves to the punishment of being 

    <pb n="330"/>

deprived of what we value so much by a refusal to comply 
with the conditions upon which we were appointed&#44; so to say&#44; 
trustees under the gift of God&#44; to administer for the portion of 
our existence on earth a share of such worldly riches as may 
come into our hands&#63; And says the prophet &#40;Malachi iii. 10): 
&#34;Bring ye all the tenth part into the treasury&#8211;house&#44; that it 
may serve as provision in my house &#59; and prove me&#44; I pray 
you&#44; in this&#44; if I will not open for you the windows of heaven&#44; 
and pour out over you blessing without measure. &#40;11th verse): 
And I will keep off for you the devouring insect&#44; that it may 
not destroy for you the fruit of the earth&#59; and not unfruitful 
shall be unto you the vine in the field&#44; says the Lord of hosts.&#34; 
We thus see that we are promised worldly success&#44; if we com&#8211; 
ply with the demands of the law &#59; and if we give the tenth part 
of the produce of the earth to the Levite&#44; share our money with 
the poor&#44; and be as it were angels and ministers of comfort on 
earth : we are told that the windows of heaven shall be opened 
to shower blessings down without measure. The earth then 
shall not he devastated by blight and locust&#44; and richly shall 
the vineyard repay the vintner&#39;s toil. Is the condition not 
such that even avarice would ask no more &#63; And can we doubt 
the fulfilment of the promise&#44; when we truly see that the seed 
of the righteous are blessed&#44; and that his children never want 
for bread &#63; &#8212; But discard altogether worldly success&#44; admit 
that the bounty bestowed upon the poor&#44; the time spent in per&#8211; 
sonal deeds of humanity as actually lost to worldly gain : that 
you are so much the poorer by having on sixty Sabbath&#8211;days 
in the year abstained from labour and pursuits of gain &#59; what&#44; 
I ask you&#44; can you allege as a valid reason against obedience 
to the law&#44; when you reflect that by so doing you gain the 
favour of God&#44; the good&#8211;will of men&#44; and a tranquil mind. 
The favour of God &#33; imagine only that you are laying up for 
yourselves treasures imperishable&#59; beatitude unending&#59; bliss 
without measure &#33; And by what means &#63; by gratif3&#39;ing the 
nobler feelings of your nature&#44; feelings&#44; which at best are the 
chief distinguishing characteristics between man and beast. 
And what feelings do you mortify &#63; avarice&#44; cruelty&#44; and envy &#59; 
And what do you sacrifice &#63; money&#44; earthly treasures&#44; things in 
themselves nothing&#44; and only valuable in as far as they may be

the means of doing good. &#8212; And whom do you serve &#63; your&#8211; 
selves &#59; for all the benefit of virtuous actions will be yours &#59; 
God&#39;s happiness cannot be increased by any thing you can 
bestow&#44; nor can you injure Him by any misdeeds of yours. &#8212; 
And who is it that begs of you to try his truth&#63; It is the 
Giver of all&#44; to whom all is indebted for its daily food&#59; as the 
Psalmist says &#40;cxlv. 15&#8211;16) : &#34;The eyes of all look with hope 
towards Thee&#44; and Thou givest them food in its time. Thou 
openest thy hand&#44; and satisfied all that lives with beneficence.&#34; 
And even were a man ever so wealthy&#44; were his means so 
ample that his wealth could not be consumed in his lifetime&#44; 
nor in the lifetime of his children : still it is God who sendeth 
the rain to refresh the earth&#44; who blesses the seasons&#44; and 
crowneth the summer with fruitfulness. &#8212; And who at last 
requires it of you to neglect feelings of selfishness in obedience 
to his laws&#63; &#8212; It is the Author of all. He in whom the world 
exists &#59; the Sovereign of the universe&#44; the Omnipotent Proprie&#8211; 
tor of the land&#44; the King&#44; in whose dominions you are strangers 
and tolerated settlers. And thus we read in the portion of the 
law read this day : 

&#34; And if you say&#44; what shall we eat in the seventh year 1 behold we may 
not sow nor gather in our fruit. But I will command my blessing to you in 
the sixth year&#44; and it shall produce the necessary fruit for the three years. 
And when you sow in the eighth year&#44; you shall eat of the old &#59; till the ninth 
year&#44; till its harvest is housed you shall eat of the old. And the land shall 
not be sold away as property&#44; for mine is the land&#44; for strangers and settlers 
you are with me.&#34; Leviticus xxv. 20&#8211;23. 

In this text are answered all the objections which the timid&#44; 
the avaricious&#44; and the obstinate can raise against the compliance 

    <pb n="332"/>

THE DUTY OF ACTIVE BENEVOLENCE. 33 

with the law. &#8212; To the timid and avaricious&#44; God says : &#34;I will 
command my blessing to you&#34; for compliance. He who fears 
to starve&#44; because he neither sows nor reaps&#44; is thus assured that 
famine and deprivation will not happen&#44; because the land lies 
idle &#59; and the covetous one is notified that he will best consult 
his interest by doing as commanded&#44; for thus alone will his 
labour be blest with immense increase. &#8212; And to the obstinate 
one&#44; God says : &#34; The land shall not be sold away as property&#44; 
for mine is the land&#44;&#34; in reply to an objection he might raise 
against the provision of the law which says&#44; that at the Jubilee 
every piece of land shall revert to the original owner. He 
might say : &#34; The land is my own&#44; why shall I be prevented 
from exchanging it for money&#44; if I please :&#34; to this he is 
answered that the land is not his&#44; but merely a trust&#44; permitted 
him by the real Owner of the soil&#44; the Sovereign Lord of all&#44; 
and the Legislator of Israel. &#8212; To explain at present the happy 
political effect this provision must have upon a people like the 
Israelites were in Palestine&#44; by preventing the growth of a few 
immense estates to the detriment of the many&#44; would detain us 
too long&#59; but enough for our purpose is to mention&#44; that it 
evidently proceeded from a view to render the nation as nearly 
as possible equal&#44; that all might be equally free &#59; and nothing 
therefore is more true&#44; than what was said in another place&#44; that 
the Mosaic legislation was intended and well calculated to 
secure the greatest happiness of the greatest number. A law so 
wise&#44; so entirely based upon the purest principles of philan&#8211; 
thropy ought to be dear to us &#59; and let us therefore endeavour 
to do all that is yet left to us to do. The sabbathic year is&#44; 
alas &#33; abolished by our dispersion &#59; the trumpet of the Jubilee 
no longer proclaims liberty and freedom to the land and to all 
the inhabitants thereof&#59; the festive pilgrims&#8211; no longer crowd 
thy highways&#44; land of Israel &#33; but still we are left fully able 
to exercise charity to the poor&#44; to comfort the afflicted&#44; to love 
our fellow&#8211;men like ourselves&#44; and to keep the festivals of the 
Lord&#44; and to celebrate weekly with devotion and abstinence 
from labour the Sabbath of rest&#44; in honour of the Lord &#8212; undis&#8211; 
mayed by the paltry loss of gain &#8212; mindful that it is an institu&#8211; 
tion of the Creator of all&#44; an emblem of everlasting rest in hea&#8211; 
ven&#44; and a memorial that we were servants in Egypt&#44; and that

DISCOURSE xxxn. 

THE SELECTION OF ISRAEL. 

Sovereign of the universe&#33; we adore Thee&#44; because of thy 
great goodness and glory which Thou hast full often displayed 
over us thy people. From Egypt Thou didst redeem us&#44; and 
didst hear our cries amid our afflictions&#44; because Thou wert 
mindful of the covenant Thou hadst made with our ancestors&#44; 
who walked before Thee in humility and devotion&#44; when dark&#8211; 
ness surrounded the earth and all its inhabitants. After Thou 
hadst rendered us free from earthly tyranny&#44; Thou further 
didst manifest thyself to us&#44; and didst deliver to us thy law 
resplendent with purity and holiness&#44; and thus Thou madest 
our minds also free&#44; and ourselves the subjects to thy holy will &#59; 
and in this manner Thou didst surround us with a shield of 
power&#44; defending us from the contamination of surrounding 
nations. Our tongues are too feeble to express our thanks&#44; our 
words are insufficient to declare thy goodness&#44; and our minds 
are lost in the contemplation of thy infinite wisdom. then 
may it be thy will&#44; Everlasting One&#44; to accept with favour the

insufficient words of our mouths&#44; the humble thoughts of our 
hearts&#44; as the only offering we can bring upon the altar of a 
contrite heart&#44; which Thou hast promised through the mouth 
of thy prophets&#44; Thou wouldst never despise. And protect 
farther thy people&#44; and defend them from the attacks of their 
adversaries&#44; and fortify their hearts&#44; so that they may live and 
serve Thee&#44; till Thou sendest thy anointed one to promulge 
thy law to all the ends of the earth&#44; when all will serve Thee 
in purity and holiness I Amen&#44; 

Brethren &#33; 
On a former occasion we proposed three questions for ex&#8211; 
amination &#59; the first was: &#34; Is it reasonable to suppose that God 
should select Israel as his peculiar people &#63;&#34; the second em&#8211; 
braced the inquiry: &#34; Granted that the selection was reasonable&#44; 
what advantage did the Israelites gain thereby&#63;&#34; and the third 
was : &#34; Whether the Israelites had been rejected after having 
been once chosen&#63;&#34; &#8212; The two first questions were amply dis&#8211; 
cussed&#44; objections stated and refuted&#59; and we came to the con&#8211; 
clusion&#44; that it is perfectly reasonable and consonant with the 
wisdom of God to believe&#44; that He educated our ancestors to 
be worthy to become his servants by a long period of servi&#8211; 
tude in the land of the children of Ham&#44; teaching them by a 
mighty display of his omnipotence&#44; that he is the God to 
whom alone adoration is due from all mankind. This educa&#8211; 
tion was&#44; as we have seen&#44; intended to form a people on whom 
a permanent impression could be made&#44; and who would bfe 
willing&#44; at all times and under all circumstances&#44; to serve the 
God who had redeemed them &#59; and thus to be for all ages the 
depositary of the law of God&#44; and a shining light to the na&#8211; 
tions of the earth&#44; &#8212; In answer to the second question&#44; we have 
clearly demonstrated&#44; that a selection by Supreme Wisdom for 
a purpose so grand is advantage enough&#44; nay&#44; more than any 
other advantage which we can enjoy as individuals or as a na&#8211; 
tion. Only think&#44; that the exertions each of us makes in the 
service of God redounds not only to our own advantage&#44; but 
also to the civilization and redemption of the universe from the 
misrule of superstition and false worships. Surely&#44; an end so 
great&#44; so universally beneficial&#44; is an object for the promotion 

    <pb n="335"/>

36 THE SELECTION OF ISRAEL. 

of which the Almighty might well be supposed to exert his 
wisdom and his care&#44; and a boon sufficiently great to be desired 
by the most exalted people. This is a brief outline of the ar&#8211; 
guments employed to answer the first questions consonantly 
with the assumption of the Israelites&#44; that they were chosen as 
the depositary of the divine will&#44; and that they have just cause 
to be thankful for his benefit thus bestowed&#44; despite of its 
having exposed them at all times to the envy and persecution 
of the nations among whom they dwell. &#8212; Let us now proceed 
to examine by the light of Holy Writ and common reason the 
assertion of our opponents: &#34;&#34; That&#44; though we were once the 
chosen people&#44; we have ceased to be so since a definite period 
of time &#59; or&#44; as they say&#44; Israel the descendant of Jacob is no 
longer the spiritual Israel.&#34; The consideration of this ques&#8211; 
tion involves&#44; as you will easily observe&#44; something of a con&#8211; 
trovertial nature&#44; and therefore you may suppose that it is not 
properly a subject with which we should engage in a public 
religious discourse &#59; but still it is one vitally important to 
us as Jews&#44; and in my examination thereof&#44; which I propose 
laying before you&#44; I shall confine myself to the abstract ques&#8211; 
tion&#44; and if what may be said controverts the doctrines of 
other sects&#44; it shall be done without either attacking them or 
noticing the books from which they are drawn and upon which 
they are founded. I may as well remark in this place&#44; that in 
treating upon any topic of our religion&#44; and in answering ob&#8211; 
jections raised against it&#44; it is quite sufficient to answer merely 
such objections&#44; without reverting to the doctrines of any sys&#8211; 
tem different from ours &#59; for our religion&#44; not alone that its 
excellence is above any other&#44; but it dates also prior to any 
other &#59; and consequently&#44; we may argue the subject as though 
no other rule of faith existed. &#8212; But in some cases it may be 
necessary to advert to systems differing from or adverse to ours&#44; 
when it may tend to confirm ourselves the more strongly in our 
belief: when it is perfectly fair to discuss the subject controver&#8211; 
sially&#59; for this is the only way by which truth can be sifted 
from error. I do not&#44; however&#44; think it at all necessary to 
offer an apology for the inode of discussion which I have adopt&#8211; 
ed : only to point out to you the reasons which usually have 
swayed&#44; and shall in future sway me in the elucidations of our 

    <pb n="336"/>

THE SELECTION OF ISRAEL. 37 

holy law which I may have offered&#44; or may yet continue to 
offer to your serious reflection. 

Let us proceed with our examination of the question pro&#8211; 
posed : &#34; Are the Israelites descended from Jacob the true 
spiritual Israelites&#44; or have they been rejected after their having 
been once chosen &#63;&#34; To come to a clear understanding on this 
very important subject&#44; it is first necessary to know what is 
meant by selection&#44; and next by the term rejection. &#8212; When we 
say&#44; that we were selected as the people of God we mean to 
to say&#44; that we were selected&#44; chosen&#44; elected&#44; or withdrawn 
from among the multitude of nations&#44; separated from an affinity 
with them in their adoration of airy nothings&#44; and set apart to 
be servants to the Most High&#44; and subject to his law. It makes 
no difference by what word we designate this action of God&#44; 
whether we call it a selection&#44; choice&#44; election&#44; or withdrawal&#59; 
it was either or rather all combined &#59; we say we were selected&#44; 
because God in his supreme knowledge knew the disposition of 
our people to be best adapted for his purposes&#44; as we read in 
Deuteronomy xxxi. 21 : &#34; And it shall come to pass when the 
many evils and plagues find him &#40;Israel)&#44; then shall this song 
answer against him as evidence&#44; for it &#40;the song&#44; and con&#8211; 
sequently the law in which it is contained&#44;) shall not be for&#8211; 
gotten from the mouth of his descendants: for I know his 
inclination&#44; as he does this day&#44; before yet &#39;I have brought 
him into the land which I have sworn.&#34; &#8212; This knowledge 
caused Him to choose us then from among the nations. He 
elected us to be his people by withdrawing us from the wick&#8211; 
edness which overspread the earth. Now&#44; from what has been 
said&#44; it must be self&#8211;evident that this choosing was for no other 
purpose than a moral good&#44; and not to make us worldly great&#59; 
and consequently&#44; Israel can be the chosen servant&#44; although 
he be poor&#44; although he be a captive in a strange land. It is 
not to be denied that we were promised prosperity and peace&#44; 
if we would be obedient to the commandments&#59; but all of us 
know&#44; how much ease and freedom from the cares of poverty 
enable the mind to be more devoted to the refined cares for the 
welfare of the soul&#44; since it has not then to wear itself out with 
a constant chafing against the ills of life. So that worldly 
blessings were promised as the means for the furtherance of the

38 THE SELECTION OF ISRAEL. 

grand ulterior object&#44; that is&#44; to raise up a holy people&#44; obe&#8211; 
dient in thought&#44; word&#44; and deed to the will of God. As we 
read &#40;Deut. xxvii. 18&#8211;19): &#34;And the Lord has avouched thee 
this day to be his peculiar people&#44; as He has promised thee&#44; 
and that thou shouldst keep his commandments &#59; and to make 
thee high above all the nations which He has made&#44; in praise&#44; 
and in name&#44; and in honour&#44; and that thou mayest be a holy 
people to the Lord thy God&#44; as He has spoken.&#34; We thus see&#44; 
that the reason of the selection was two&#8211;fold&#59; first&#44; to become 
through obedience holy to God&#44; and&#44; secondly&#44; to deserve 
happiness and to reach felicity through holiness. &#8212; The question 
now arises: &#34;Was this holiness to be permanent or temporary&#63;&#39;&#42; 
By holiness is meant&#44; no more than an obedience to the divine 
will so often and so uniformly exercised&#44; as to invest the doers 
thereof with a peculiar capacity to merit&#44; and to receive&#44; the 
favour of God &#59; and to resist more easily&#44; than others not doing 
so or not so far advanced&#44; the pressure of temptations&#59; and to 
subject ourselves with more readiness and cheerfulness to what&#8211; 
ever good or evil the Almighty may bestow&#59; not to rise above 
ourselves when successful&#44; nor to sink into gloom and despair 
when reverses come over us. It is&#44; moreover&#44; evident&#44; that if 
any course of life&#44; being in conformity to the once declared will 
of God&#44; confers this state of holy feelings at one period of the 
world&#44; it must continue to exert the same influence to the end 
of time. Or&#44; in other words&#44; since it was declared to be lead&#8211; 
ing a holy life in the time of Moses&#44; if a man acted conforma&#8211; 
bly to the law revealed from Sinai : it follows&#44; that to act 
according to the same law at this moment is also leading a 
holy life&#44; unless it can be demonstiated&#44; that at any one time 
since the promulgation of the Decalogue&#44; the Almighty descend&#8211; 
ed in his glory and solemnly abrogated the law He there so 
solemnly enacted&#44; when our forefathers stood at the foot of Sinai 
and saw the lightning flash&#44; heard the thunder roll&#44; and felt the 
mountain move. But where do we find any evidence of such 
an occurrence&#63; At what period was there such a display of 
universal&#44; public&#44; and intelligible legislation of a new code &#63; 
Truth will say: &#34;At no time&#44; in no place.&#34; And as the law 
was enacted for the purpose of being obeyed&#44; or else its enact&#8211; 
ment would have been useless&#44; and as at no time it has been 

    <pb n="338"/>

abolished: to observe its precepts z&#8211;s leading a holy life&#59; and 
consequently&#44; Israel will be a holy people&#44; if they continue to 
live according to the dictates of divine holiness. To sum up 
all that has been said above&#44; in a few words&#44; we may state: that 
the giving of the law was the virtual selection of Israel&#44; and an 
obedience to this law confers upon Israel the just appellation of 
God&#39;s peculiar people&#44; since at no time has any other people 
acted according to the law given to them&#44; and never could 
show any reason&#44; why another law should be considered as the 
divine legislation. 

We must now examine what can be meant by &#34; Israel is re&#8211; 
jected &#63;&#34; From the preceding it must be evident that Israel&#39;s 
rejection can only be imagined as at all possible by a promul&#8211; 
gation of a new code of laws&#44; by refusing which they place 
themselves out of the pale of divine favour. Further&#44; the 
evidence of such a promulgation must be so clear as to leave no 
doubt upon our minds as to its correctness. But to imagine 
even that a new code would or could be given&#44; is to admit a 
caprice in the divine will&#44; a vacillation in the judgment of God&#44; 
which&#44; far be such thought from us&#44; would invest the Divine 
Essence with all the imperfections of humanity &#59; whereas we 
are clearly told&#44; that &#34; God is no man that He could lie&#44; and not 
a son of man that He could repent.&#34; Our assumption&#44; there&#8211; 
fore&#44; based as it is upon reason and revelation&#44; would in itself 
alone be sufficient to do away with the necessity for any further 
argument. Yet where there are objections raised it is proper 
to give them their utmost weight&#44; the more radically to remove 
them. So then&#44; admit that a new legislation were possible&#44; still 
it must be confessed&#44; upon an impartial investigation&#44; that the 
fundamental principles of the moral and even of the ceremonial 
laws of our religion admit of no change. Let us take&#44; for ex&#8211; 
ample&#44; the first commandment proclaimed from Sinai : &#34; I am 
the Lord thy God&#44;&#34; which as you know is an announcement of 
our obligation to believe in a Divinity&#44; everlasting&#44; unchanging&#44; 
and indivisible. Is it possible that any new code &#40;even let it also 
emanate from God&#44; which we however think impossible) could 
contain any thing at variance with this principle &#63; Can God 
himself be at one time nnx &#39;n&#44; Jidonai Echad&#44; the only ever&#8211; 
lasting Being&#44; and cease to be so at another time &#63; Aye&#44; and 

    <pb n="339"/>

40 THE SELECTION OF ISRAEL. 

this is the essence of the law&#44; to know that there is an only 
God&#44; everlasting and unchangeable&#44; Creator of all&#44; Ruler of all&#44; 
Good above all&#44; and Just above all &#59; who&#44; though incomprehen&#8211; 
sible&#44; exists through all eternity&#44; and to whom our conceptions 
of time&#44; age&#44; and change are inapplicable. &#8212; Let us proceed to 
the second commandment and its specifications : &#34; Thou shalt 
have no other gods &#59; thou shalt not make thyself any image &#59; 
thou shalt not bow down to them&#44; and shalt not worship them.&#34; 
This too is unchangeable in its nature. For as God is ever the 
same&#44; so it must always be wrong&#44; under any circumstance&#44; to 
associate with Him&#44; be his name praised for ever more&#44; any 
other existing or imaginary being in worship&#44; as by no contin&#8211; 
gency whatever can aught but the Creator and Father of all be 
God. &#8212; Again : &#34; Remember the Sabbath to keep it holy.&#34; 
This precept too is immutable &#59; from the words of the hbly 
text it appears that its institution was based upon the history 
of the creation&#44; and to for ever remind us&#44; that after all had been 
created as now ordered around us in six days&#44; the seventh was 
no day of creation&#44; or&#44; to use the words of Scripture : &#34; After 
God had finished on the seventh day the work He had done. 
He rested on the seventh day from all the work He had done.&#34; 
Now it is evident that the reasons assigned for the observance 
of the seventh day apply to no other day of the week&#44; for all 
six were days of creation&#44; and but the seventh alone a day of 
abstinence from work. In fact&#44; the etymological meaning of 
the word Sabbath&#44; from the Hebrew verb &#40;shabote)&#44; to 
cease&#44; is cessation&#44; and only by inference rest&#44; for rest is the 
consequence of a cessation from labour. Another reason given 
for the observance of the seventh day is found in the repetition 
of the Decalogue &#40;Deut. v. 15) : &#34;And thou shalt remember 
that thou wert a slave in the land of Egypt&#44; and that the Lord 
brought thee out from thence&#44; with a mighty hand and a 
stretched out arm&#44; therefore the Lord thy God has commanded 
thee to make the Sabbath&#8211;day.&#34; The connection of this reason 
with the other&#44; referring to the creation&#44; has been explained by 
me in another place&#44; and need therefore not be repeated here. 
But from the whole it will appear&#44; that the institution of the 
seventh day of rest was to be permanent and unchanged&#44; as the 
reasons given are also unchangeable&#44; to wit&#44; the creation in six

days and the redemption from Egypt&#44; since tilings past are 
from their nature not liable to be changed&#44; because what is once 
done cannot be undone&#59; for even if the efiect be removed the 
event itself has occurred. We therefore find in our prayers 
the following formula for the kiddush of the Sabbath : &#34; Bless&#8211; 
ed art Thou&#44; Lord our God&#44; Sovereign of the yniverse&#44; who 
hast sanctified us with thy commandments&#44; and hast found de&#8211; 
light in us&#59; and hast caused us to inherit with love and favour 
thy holy Sabbath&#44; as a memorial of the work of the creation &#59; 
for it is the first of the days of holy convocation&#44; in memory of 
our redemption from Egypt&#44;&#34; &#8212; The precept &#34; Honour thy 
father and mother&#44;&#34; must find a place in any divine legislation. 
&#34; Thou shalt not commit murder &#59; thou shalt not commit adul&#8211; 
tery &#59; thou shalt not steal &#59;&#34; &#34; you shall not defile yourselves 
by any creeping thing &#59;&#34; &#34; you shall not lie &#59;&#34; &#34; not follow the 
ways of the people of Egypt &#59;&#34; and in fact all the prohibitions&#44; 
and nearly all the positive commandments&#44; will be found upon 
examination to be of that kind&#44; that no law whatever&#44; if of 
divine origin&#44; could by any possibility gainsay them. The 
proof is easy&#44; but would require more time than can be devoted 
to it now &#59; and each of you can no doubt follow out the argu&#8211; 
ment by your own reflection. Now it follows&#44; that any law to 
be divine must be just such a one as we possess&#59; and any law 
differing therefrom in any material point&#44; inust be&#44; of necessity&#44; 
not of divine origin. For it is impossible to conceive how 
both propositions can be true&#44; that God is One&#44; Eternal&#44; Un&#8211; 
changeable&#44; and Indivisible&#44; and that He is divided&#44; subject to 
change&#44; and consisting of a plurality. &#8212; It cannot be said&#44; that 
we must keep Sabbath on the seventh day&#44; to celebrate weekly 
the wonder of the creation&#44; and to change it to the sixth&#44; first&#44; 
or any other day&#44; to celebrate any thing else. &#8212; It is incompati&#8211; 
ble with reason to admit that God instituted the prohibition of 
certain species of animals&#44; because they would contaminate us&#44; 
and for no reason that we can discover&#44; to abolish the prohibi&#8211; 
tion. &#8212; To institute the order of priesthood in the family of 
Aaron&#44; and then to admit every one to the privilege&#44; again 
without any reason. &#8212; To proclaim statutes and judgments as 
his will&#44; and to revoke them at his caprice without any ground 
for such a change existing&#44; at least such a ground as could satisfy

our reason. &#8212; But as God&#39;s ways are just&#44; as in Him there is no 
fault nor evil&#44; we must come to the conclusion&#44; that such incon&#8211; 
sistencies are not of his sanctioning&#44; and that whatever of error 
there does exist is of human invention &#59; whatever of discrepancy 
to his law may be found has been introduced by men&#44; and not 
by the All&#8211;wise&#44; Unchangeable One. &#8212; But even yield all which 
our opponents can possibly demand &#59; admit for a moment that 
things can be changed : we would ask&#44; where is the evidence of 
such change &#63; where is the warrant for our departure from the 
ways of our ancestors &#63; We may safely say&#44; that there is no book 
warranting a belief in a plurality of the deity&#44; which claims to 
be of divine revelation &#59; there is no such code authorizing the 
transmutation of the Sabbath &#59; there is no law authorizing things 
prohibited in the Pentateuch. And if we admit the authority 
of this book&#44; then it follows that unless there be a superior 
authority&#44; no other law can claim our submission &#59; and as there 
is no other law&#44; consequently the law of the Torah is yet&#44; and 
will be&#44; binding on us and all who may join us. If now it is 
meant by &#34; Israel is rejected&#44;&#34; that the law of Israel has ceased 
to be the law of God : then it has been already established be&#8211; 
yond contradiction&#44; that this position is false and erroneous. 
But if it is meant to be understood that we have ceased to be 
the favourite people of God&#44; and that others acting differently 
from us have now become the elect : then we are also prepared 
with proof to rebut the assertion. Yet even say&#44; that we no 
longer enjoy particular favour&#44; aye&#44; take all that is claimed&#44; 
that the nations of the earth have been chosen : still we will 
reject all overtures to join ourselves to others&#44; we will resist 
amalgamation with all our heart&#44; with all our soul&#44; and with all 
our might. No &#33; never be it said that we serve our God from 
interest&#44; or that we are envious that others too are chosen&#44; even 
if we be rejected. Would to God that all inhabitants of the 
earth were living in his service&#44; walking before Him in fear&#44; 
truth&#44; and sincerity &#59; would that our eyes might see&#44; our minds 
be convinced that the world were filled with true adorers&#44; and 
even if we were&#44; as we are now&#44; poor&#44; humble&#44; trodden under 
foot&#44; and despised. Aye&#44; if annihilation of our national exist&#8211; 
ence were to be the forfeit&#44; let the partial evil be compensated 
by the universal good. Come then weal or wo&#44; prosperity or

affliction&#44; life or death&#44; be it ours to uphold the true law &#59; let us 
be sunken but not degraded &#59; let us even from amidst the depth 
of aflBiction cry to our God&#44; and proclaim aloud his wonders 
which He has done for our ancestors&#44; in redeeming them from 
the bonds of slavery&#44; and giving them a law to free their souls 
from the trammels of sin and the thraldom of superstition. 
But no &#33; Israel is not rejected &#33; Israel is not cast off &#33; Israel 
is yet the chosen people &#59; and the Israelites descended from 
Jacob are still the bodily as also the spiritual Israel. &#8212; For know 
that even at the time when through our great crimes we had 
doomed ourselves to punishment&#44; at the very time when pro&#8211; 
phets&#44; inspired by the Supreme Judge&#44; denounced dispersion 
and captivity over us&#44; Jeremiah spoke thus by divine inspir&#8211; 
ation : 

&#34; Thus speaketh the Lord&#44; If the heavens can be measured above&#44; and 
the fastness of the earth be searched out beneath : then also will I reject the 
whole seed of Israel&#44; for all which they have done&#44; says the Lord.&#34; 

XX xi. 37. 

It were futile&#44; and insulting to your understanding&#44; to prove 
to you by demonstration that Israel here spoken of is the seed 
of Jacob&#44; whom the Lord called Israel&#59; since the whole con&#8211; 
text evidently alludes to no other. It is therefore perfectly 
plain&#44; that we are promised that&#44; despite of our transgressions&#44; 
we shall not be cast off utterly&#44; nor ever be suffered to be lost 
among the nations&#59; as we also read in Lev. xxvi. 44 : &#34; And 
for all that&#44; when they be in the land of their enemies I will not 
reject them&#44; nor despise them to destroy them utterly&#44; to break 
my covenant with them &#59; for I am the Lord their God.&#34; Again 
a promise to the bodily Israel&#44; who though in the land of their 
enemies shall not be totally rejected. 

Having thus shown what is meant by the ierms selection and 
rejection&#44; it must strike you all&#44; that it is perfectly reasonable 
and consistent with revelation to admit the first&#44; but utterly 

    <pb n="343"/>

44 THE SELECTION OF ISRAEL. 

repugnant both to reason and revelation to admit the other. 
It is&#44; nevertheless&#44; very evident why it is constantly re&#8211; 
peated that we are rejected &#59; it is to induce us to forsake the 
God whom we adore&#44; the law that we love &#59; and to mingle with 
the nations&#44; to become an integral part of the great mass of the 
human family&#44; and no longer to exhibit the spectacle of a people&#44; 
dispersed all over the earth&#44; still one and united by a belief in the 
ancient faith&#44; upholden by a hope of better days. But it is 
our duty to reject such calls&#44; whatever advantages may be offer&#8211; 
ed to us thereby&#59; for we must be convinced from the whole 
tenor of our history&#44; that we never can gain the favour of God 
by apostacy: that is&#44; by forsaking that law which He has esta&#8211; 
blished as the standard of right. &#8212; Our opponents&#44; however&#44; say&#44; 
that&#44; if it were true&#44; that we yet continue to be the chosen 
people&#44; that if our law yet continued to be the law of God&#44; we 
would not be suffered to be in captivity and dispersed in every&#8211; 
corner of the globe&#59; and they maintain that we are suffering&#44; 
because we have rejected a better law&#44; and have done certain 
wrongs which they lay as a sin against us. Now&#44; these asser&#8211; 
tions might hold good&#44; if a better law actually existed&#44; or if it 
were true that our dispersion had not been foretold by our own 
prophets&#44; denounced as an inevitable consequence of the non&#8211; 
observance of that very law&#44; which it is alleged has been ab&#8211; 
rogated. &#8212; The first assertion we have already proved as un&#8211; 
founded&#44; for no new law whatever has been promulgated&#44; much 
less a better one &#59; and to the second&#44; we answer&#44; that from 
Moses down to Malachi punishment has been denounced 
against transgression&#44; both punishment in this life and after 
death&#59; and by most of the prophets our very captivity and 
dispersion all over the earth have been especially predicted in 
the manner we see it before us this day. Whatever other 
crimes then we may have committed&#44; it is sufficient to account 
for our situation by referring to the constant infraction of the 
Mosaic law&#44; which we and our ancestors have been guilty of&#59; 
and consequently we must infer&#44; that a further dereliction will 
be still more signally avenged&#44; for God is just and true&#44; and no 
untruth aud injustice can stand before Him. And let not the 
wicked flatter himself with the idea that he will escape the 
punishment under which Israel is suffering&#44; by leaving the holy

church for a junction with the multitude&#59; he will be&#44; it is true&#44; 
no longer a captive&#44; at least in its own estimation &#59; but there 
are other pains far more to be dreaded than even death itself 
inflicted by the persecutor for an adherence to the law&#44; &#8212; No&#44; 
brethren&#44; the law of God is not abolished &#59; Israel is not reject&#8211; 
ed&#59; but only the light of the one is dimmed&#44; because the other 
has sinned. But the day will come&#44; when the lustre of both 
will be resplendent beyond compare&#44; when God will be glori&#8211; 
fied&#44; his law revered&#44; and it be acknowledged by all&#44; that we 
are God&#39;s people&#44; a people faithful to the last&#44; faithful in having 
so truly preserved the law entrusted as a deposit&#44; amid so many 
difficulties &#59; and faithful and true in having resisted for cen&#8211; 
turies of persecution&#44; darkness&#44; and worldly allurement&#44; ming&#8211;&#42; 
ling with other nations&#44; whose heart is not entire with the Lord 
our God. Then&#44; indeed&#44; will all the earth be an altar to the 
Lord&#39;&#59; then&#44; indeed&#44; will He be declared&#44; as in truth He is&#44; the 
great King&#44; whose glory fills the universe &#33; 

It is in our power to do much towards this great end by 
an observance of the law&#59; and wherever there is in our capti&#8211; 
vity a temple of the Most High&#44; there let us assemble&#44; and 
proclaim that we will be persevering in the service of God till 
the end of time. Whenever then a new house of prayer is 
erected&#44; let us regard it as an approach to the great end&#44; as a 
step nearer to the glorious consummation&#44; and let us upon every 
such occasion pray for the welfare of the community who have 
thus roused themselves to the service of the Lord. &#8212; The pre&#8211; 
sent holyday is&#44; as you know&#44; the anniversary of the promul&#8211; 
gation of the law&#44; and it has been chosen by a neighbouring 
congregation&#44;&#42; as a fit time for the dedication of a new house 
of worship to the service of the Most High. Let us then pray 
for the welfare of that community&#44; who have just finished the 
goodly work&#44; and let us invoke blessing and prosperity upon 
their endeavours. 

Lord God&#44; Father of mercy&#33; we beseech Thee to regard 
with pleasure our exertions in thy holy service. Bless us and 
all those who call upon thy name &#59; and may it be thy will 
to infuse thy spirit of grace into the hearts of our brethren&#44;

DISCOURSE XXXIII. 

THE BLESSING OF REVELATION. 

To the God of truth&#44; whose word is truth&#44; be praise and 
glory from all ends of the earth&#44; and may his name be glorified 
by all the children of men&#44; from now and for ever. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

How much have we to be thankful for to our great Father &#33; 
and how can we do enough to show our gratitude&#33; If we look 
upon ourselves as members of the human family at large&#44; we 
will&#44; and must&#44; feel ourselves impelled by gratitude towards the 
Giver of light and life&#44; who&#44; in making man after his image&#44; 
rendered him fit for the habitation of a spirit of wisdom and 
intellect &#59; and not only gave to his outward frame a beauty of 
form superior to that of any other animal&#44; but also infused 
therein a soul&#44; a living principle&#44; an intelligent mind&#44; a spark 
divine&#44; towering above all in majesty and strength. But if 

    <pb n="346"/>

THE BLESSING OF REVELATION. 47 

we go a step further and view ourselves not only as men in 
general&#44; but as Israelites&#44; we shall have yet more cause for an 
indulgence of our gratitude towards the Supreme Disposer of 
all. For though the human mind reaches wonderfully far by 
its own researches&#44; and contains much by its natural organiza&#8211; 
tion : still without further assistance&#44; emanating immediately 
from the Divine Essence&#44; it is but too apt to be misled by the 
semblance of good&#44; and is often induced to mistake the wrong 
for what is right&#44; because its means of information are insuf&#8211; 
ficient or inaccurate. Thus&#44; the most wonderful and compre&#8211; 
hensive intellect&#44; when unassisted by instruction&#44; is apt to be 
in error&#59; since it is next to impossible&#44; during our short stay on 
earth&#44; to obtain correct data to form a correct judgment upon 
every occasion. And this was wisely so ordained &#59; for since 
men are unequal in their capacity&#44; the wise few would have 
obtained unlimited sway over their fellows &#59; and as the wise 
too can be wicked&#44; they might have dictated laws to the rest 
of mankind&#44; whose utility&#44; to say the least&#44; might have been 
questionable. But now&#44; as it is the fixed law of humanity&#44; 
that we are liable to err&#44; the assertions of every man&#44; no matter 
how superior may be his endowments&#44; will always be received 
with caution &#59; and&#44; therefore&#44; if the good fail often of doing all 
the good they propose&#44; the wicked are full as often thwarted in 
their evil endeavours. So we have in this case another exem&#8211; 
plification of the fact&#44; that there exists no evil which is not 
counterbalanced by an equal or even larger share of good. All 
this&#44; however&#44; goes to shovv&#44; that human reason is fallible and 
of itself insufficient to perceive the light which it is able to 
acquire&#59; and we find&#44; therefore&#44; that men who have even made 
great progress in inventions and acquirement of sciences and 
knowledge&#44; have very often been swayed in their moral con&#8211; 
duct by unbelief&#44; superstition&#44; or bigotry. That is to say&#44; 
some wise men in worldly matters have had no adequate per&#8211; 
ception of the nature of the Deity&#44; as we find it declared in 
Scriptures&#44; nor could their morality be compared by the stan&#8211; 
dard laid down in the law of God. Take&#44; for instance&#44; the 
greatest and best of heathen philosophers&#44; Socrates&#44; and admit 
that he proclaimed nothing but what his inventive genius taught 
him&#44; and assume that there is no exaggeration in the accounts 

    <pb n="347"/>

48 THE BLESSING OF REVELATION. 

we have of his virtues and resignation&#44; of which latter&#44; how&#8211; 
ever&#44; there must always be some doubt: still his notions of God 
were far from the ideas as we have them handed down to us 
through Moses. Socrates&#44; as we are told&#44; believed in a God&#44; 
the Creator of the world&#44; and the Judge of mankind &#59; still he 
regarded the heathen gods as powers&#44; though subordinate to 
the Supreme Being. Now&#44; as I have said&#44; Socrates&#44; of all the 
heathens&#44; approximated truth nearer than any other &#59; and yet 
we find that he did not reach all the truth. He was by God 
endowed with great discernment&#44; with acute perception&#44; with 
reasoning powers of no common kind &#59; still he lacked the direct 
revelation&#44; and thus he remained imperfect&#44; when he had 
arrived so far already&#44; that the next step would have been 
truth itself. He might have argued&#44; since God created all 
and judges all&#44; he needs not the assistance of subordinate 
powers &#59; and since He alone is perfect and supremely wise&#44; 
He can have no associates in his dominion &#59; as our beautiful 
hymn so elegantly says: &#34;And He is One&#44; and there is no 
second to be associated with Him in the government &#59;&#34; and 
consequently&#44; no other being&#44; save God alone&#44; deserves the 
worship of man. Nevertheless&#44; with all his powers of reasoning&#44; 
Socrates missed the great end&#59; he imagined&#44; as said&#44; a Creator&#44; 
associated with beings of an inferior&#44; yet of a substantial and 
active power&#44; and he worshipped the idols of the Grecians&#44; and 
respected their tenets. If now&#44; the wisest of heathens erred 
so far&#44; how miserable must have been the mental state of 
those not so greatly favoured &#33; if a Socrates&#39;s reasoning was 
insufficient to teach true wisdom&#44; where can we look for it 
among the great multitude&#63; It is&#44; therefore&#44; that we Israelites 
should reflect upon the great benefit conferred upon us by the 
divine revelation&#44; where we are taught truth without disguise&#44; 
morality without alloy&#44; and religion without superstition&#33; The 
Bible teaches us to acknowledge the existence of a Being&#44; in&#8211; 
finite in time&#44; and greatness&#44; and wisdom&#44; existing before any 
thing else existed : the Creator of matter&#44; the Organizer of 
nature&#44; the Preserver of all things created&#44; and the Governor 
of nature as organized &#59; further&#44; that nature&#44; organization&#44; and 
in short&#44; all existing things&#44; and all the universe&#44; are necessarily 
dependent upon Him&#44; and upon Him alone&#44; but that neither 

    <pb n="348"/>

THE BLESSINGS OF REVELATION. 49 

they&#44; nor any thing else which can be conceived&#44; are necessary 
to his existence or his happiness. So that we can very easily 
imagine God as existing without organization of any thing 
material&#59; but that it is utterly impossible to imagine a world 
without a Creator. This Creator so great is also wise beyond 
compare. He is the Author of wisdom&#44; consequently He is the 
wisest of all. He exists in every thing&#44; and every thing exists 
in Him &#59; consequently the actions of all&#44; and the thoughts of all 
are known to Him. And as his knowledge and greatness pervade 
all&#44; it can cost Him no effort to effect any thing which may please 
his will&#44; and it requires no application of industry to make 
himself acquainted with the thoughts and actions of his crea&#8211; 
tures. &#8212; This is the God of Abraham&#44; of Isaac&#44; and of Jacob&#59; 
He is the adored and adorable One&#44; who displayed to us his 
power and his goodness &#59; and He is the Legislator who dictated 
to the people that he had chosen the law which He desired 
them to observe&#44; that through it they might obtain the enviable 
distinction of being the wisest of nations&#44; and the people most 
nearly connected through actions of piety and holiness with 
their almighty Father. &#8212; We ought&#44; therefore&#44; to display&#44; by 
all means in our power&#44; our gratitude for these signal benefits&#44; 
and we are ungrateful&#44; if we omit any opportunity by which 
we can show that we are not undeserving of the law which 
was given us&#44; that we might&#44; by observing it&#44; become a light to 
the nations of the earth. To prove that our religion is a benefit 
and not a task is almost useless &#59; for what can be more apparent&#44; 
than that a state of barbarism is far inferior to one of civiliza&#8211; 
tion &#59; that civil liberty is immeasurably superior to political 
thraldom&#59; that wisdom is preferable to folly&#59; knowledge to 
ignorance&#44; and&#44; lastly&#44; that mental light &#8212; devotion &#8212; piety &#8212; 
the love of God &#8212; peace&#44; and contentment are to be preferred 
to mental darkness &#8212; superstition &#8212; immorality &#8212; idolatry &#8212; 
strife&#44; and warfare &#33; And the effects of our law are the good 
things we have enumerated&#44; the want of it has ever produced 
the opposite effects&#59; and though among heathens we meet with 
examples of virtue&#44; disinterestedness&#44; and humanity&#44; still we 
find them so blended with grosser desires and superstitious 
practices&#44; that we can by no means view the virtues as at all 
pertaining to heathenism&#59; on the contrary&#44; as exceptions some&#8211;

times met with&#44; of evil even being occasionally the producer 
uf good&#44; or rather of evil not being altogether able to destroy 
totally the inclination to virtue and goodness. Besides&#44; it 
must be borne in mind&#44; that the Grecians and Romans&#44; 
those nations of antiquity of whom we have the most authentic 
accounts&#44; were in all likelihood greatly indebted for much of 
their knowledge of morality to the Bible&#44; although it may not 
have reached them directly. It is well known&#44; that for cen&#8211; 
turies anteceding the birth of Socrates there was a constant 
intercourse carried on between the countries of Asia Minor and 
Greece and its colonies. Many of the Grecians doubtlessly 
often appeared at the courts of the Persian kings and their 
satraps &#59; these were all&#44; more or less&#44; acquainted with the Jews&#44; 
and&#44; therefore&#44; the Jewish law also must have become known&#44; 
and when known it must of necessity have attracted attention&#44; 
if not admiration. Now&#44; if even the Grecians never associated 
with the Jews directly&#44; which is&#44; howevei&#39;&#44; too improbable to 
be believed&#44; still they doubtlessly became familiar with the 
law&#44; as said&#44; at least second handedly. Further&#44; it is likely&#44; 
that a learned man catching a glimpse as it were of those 
sublime truths to which the mass of his countrymen were 
strangers&#44; may have promulgated them&#44; to increase his own 
importance&#44; as an emanation of his own fertile invention&#44; or as 
the special revelation of a deity or a demon&#44; made known to 
him alone. However&#44; we will not insist upon this hypothesis 
as a solution of the doctrines arrived at by the Greek philoso&#8211; 
phers&#44; but merely to show to the unbeliever&#44; that the existence 
of doctrines of a nobler cast than the vulgar superstition can be 
accounted for&#44; on rational grounds&#44; as being derived mediately or 
immediately from the great source of wisdom which now illu&#8211; 
mines the world &#59; and let me add&#44; that this point has been too 
much overlooked by those great admirers of heathen philoso&#8211; 
phy&#44; who one would judge from their mode of speaking&#44; had 
discovered in the remains of Socrates&#44; Plato&#44; Aristotle&#44; and 
Cicero&#44; perfect substitutes for the sublime truths of revelation. 
It belongs not to our discussion in this place to view this sub&#8211; 
ject in all its bearings&#44; although a great deal more could be 
urged in favour of our views in connexion with this very topic. 
But even if we allow the intuitive knowledge of the learned 

    <pb n="350"/>

THE BLESSINGS OF REVELATION. 51 

men of antiquity and of the present time&#44; they merely prove 
the exceptions to the general rule&#44; which we have so often laid 
down and maintained&#44; that the Bible is the only source of true 
civilization and piety&#44; and that every system&#44; however great 
and ingenious&#44; is far behind it in beneficial effects upon the 
general welfare and salvation of mankind. 

Thus also it is not to be denied&#44; that under the dominion of 
the Bible&#44; or in other words in the theocratic state of the 
Israelites&#44; crimes were committed&#44; a state of warfare indulged 
in&#44; violence perpetrated&#44; and idolatry introduced &#59; but this was 
not in consequence of the divine legislation&#44; but in palpable 
and open violation of it &#59; and how signally has this aberration 
been avenged &#33; Our sacred temple was levelled to the ground&#44; 
our cities were burnt&#44; our youths were led to the scaffold&#44; our 
wise men stabbed and slaughtered&#44; and our priests made the 
victims upon the very altar where they administered the sacri&#8211; 
fices of the Lord &#33; The remaining few were led into captivity &#59; 
the light of the law has&#44; through our sins&#44; become dimmed&#59; 
the name of Israel has been rendered a reproach and a by&#8211;word&#59; 
and the worship of the Most High has&#44; alas &#33; to our shame&#44; be 
it spoken&#44; been more and more looked upon with indifference&#33; 
We have been punished for our sins &#59; but instead of our repent&#8211; 
ing and acting differently from the conduct of our ancestors&#44; 
who perished in their transgressions&#44; we have added wilful 
wickedness to their trespasses&#44; and thus perpetuated the wratli 
which had been poured out as a warning to others&#44; as the 
admonishing voice of Heaven : &#34; Go ye and repent&#44; and why 
will ye die&#44; house of Israel &#33;&#34; It will therefore be evident&#44; 
that not by fault of revelation have crimes been multiplied&#44; but 
in despite of its beneficent precepts&#59; and therefore the assertion 
made in the beginning of this address holds true&#44; that we are 
bound by the strongest bonds of gratitude to testify our thanks 
to our almighty Redeemer for the great benefit of a revealed 
religion so bountifully bestowed&#44; and to demonstrate ourselves 
not unworthy of a gift so great&#44; which is to lead us in this 
life&#44; which is to watch over us when we lay ourselves in the 
sleep of death&#44; and which is to delight us when we awake to 
everlasting life&#44; to unending blessedness &#33; Now&#44; from the very 
nature of man&#44; that is to say from his utter incapacity to render

God any benefit&#44; the nature of the gratitude can easily be 
inferred&#44; that is&#44; man to show his being deserving of the gift we 
have just mentioned should actually prize it&#44; look upon it as the 
best gift Heaven could bestow to bless mankind&#44; and prove this 
regard by a due observance of the divine precepts. In short&#44; 
Israel&#44; to be truly grateful&#44; should be truly a faithful&#44; obedient&#44; 
and pious people&#59; no other means exist to prove that God&#39;s gift 
was not unworthily bestowed. But unfortunately a change has 
come over the face of the earth&#44; and the dark ages of supersti&#8211; 
tion&#44; of intolerance and persecution have been succeeded by 
the more direful one of unbelief&#44; of irreligion&#44; and licentious&#8211; 
ness &#59; and a rational belief and a filial devotion to our God 
and Father&#44; are looked on with contempt&#44; and the servants of 
God are held in little repute&#44; tlieir doctrines find but unwilling 
listeners&#44; and religion is&#44; to use the emphatic words of Scrip&#8211; 
ture&#44; thrown behind the back of each of us as something too 
insignificant to deserve the attention of a race so far advanced 
in science and knowledge as to be beyond instruction&#44; as too 
elevated to need to be taught of Heaven. This is a severe 
picture&#44; but to our shame be it said&#44; a true one nevertheless of 
the spirit of our age&#44; and of that which has immediately pre&#8211; 
ceded us. Doctrines have been promulgated&#44; and promulgated 
too with a zeal which would have graced a holy cause&#44; which&#44; 
if followed up in general practice&#44; would totally subvert reli&#8211; 
gion&#44; would sever as it were the bond which unites man to 
God&#44; and would cast loose the ties of civilized society&#44; and would 
give free vent to an unbridled action of the basest passions. 
Aye&#44; and we Israelites especially have felt the sting of the 
serpent of unbelief which has been so dreadfully active &#59; we&#44; 
who of all men should have been the best prepared to resist&#44; 
we have yielded ourselves basely&#44; have been overcome without 
a struggle almost. It is useless to flatter ourselves&#44; that we are 
not open to the reproach of shameful dereliction from the good 
ways of our ancestors&#44; for we have retrograded&#44; and fallen off 
with dreadful rapidity from the path of righteousness. &#8212; Apos&#8211; 
tacy also has become so common&#44; as scarcely to excite any 
longer the least degree of surprise &#59; we have quite contentedly 
mixed ourselves with the nations &#59; we have studiously con&#8211; 
cealed our being Israelites &#59; we have carefully copied the follies

and vices of others&#44; whilst we have ever neglected to imitate 
their virtues &#59; and to be brief&#44; we must be silent&#44; we cannot 
gainsay&#44; when we are told that infidelity has made fearful 
progress amongst us. &#8212; We are ignorant&#44; and wish not to be 
informed &#59; we are spoken to&#44; and will not listen &#59; we are 
admonished to beware of the wrath to come&#44; but too much of 
the world is in our hearts &#59; too many occupations are to be 
attended to &#59; too much wealth must be amassed &#59; too much 
pleasure must be tasted &#59; too many passions must be gratified &#59; 
too much ambition must be nurtured &#59; too much greatness must 
be acquired&#59; and at last too much pride has taken its abode 
within our souls&#44; and has raised such a tumult of passions&#44; of 
grovelling low desires&#44; of exalted ambitious views&#44; of self&#8211; 
importance&#44; that nothing can be heeded but what relates to 
ourselves&#44; as though each individual were all in all&#44; and all 
beyond him as nothing in the balance. We talk of the light of 
science as incompatible with revelation &#59; and when asked&#44; 
why &#63; we begin to hold forth about the absurdity of one part 
of belief&#44; about the blind devotion to dogmas&#44; acquiescence in 
things not understood &#59; and&#44; strange inconsistency &#33; those very 
ones that speak so much of the incompatibility of religion with 
the light of science never examined the doctrines of faith for 
themselves &#59; they are ignorant of the Bible&#44; and&#44; more strange 
to say&#44; of the very sciences which they profess to venerate so 
much &#59; and all their haranguing about the absurdity of belief is 
founded upon hearsay&#44; or upon the assumption that it is unwise 
to suppose that laws enacted three thousand years ago should 
be useful still. It is marvellous how little reason there is for 
Infidelity&#44; how weak the grounds are upon which unbelief rests 
for support&#44; and how the contrary of the foregoing assertions is 
true &#59; for all science tends to confirm the truth of the law of 
God&#44; if properly examined&#44; without the jaundiced view&#44; without 
the hoodwinking of infidelity. But nothing checks us when 
we are determined to follow the bent of our inclinations &#59; 
every thing is then made subservient to our preconceived 
opinions &#59; and it is almost useless to endeavour to argue unbe&#8211; 
lief out of its erroneous notions. Conviction is spurned as 
something contaminating&#44; and sound argument is met by abuse &#59; 
and if even the last is met by mildness and meekness&#44; still

a deaf ear is turned whilst the volcano of passions has not 
exhausted its desolating fire. Is it now wonderful that the 
teachers of the law are silent&#63; that their spirit becomes faint&#63; 
that they almost determine to retire from the contest and to 
mourn in secret over the depravity of the age&#44; over the vine&#8211; 
yard of the Lord because it is desolate &#63; Truly&#44; brethren&#44; this 
is a time of great evil &#59; daily&#44; matters are assuming a more 
dreary aspect &#59; those who formerly yet adhered a little are 
now also falling off&#59; parents who still adhere neglect to teach 
their children the way of godliness&#44; or even permit them&#44; nay&#44; 
compel them&#44; to neglect the holy law for which they them&#8211; 
selves profess a mock veneration &#59; the holy language&#44; in which 
God spoke&#44; in which the law was given&#44; is not regarded&#59; men 
speak of abolishing it&#44; and why &#63; because they are ignorant&#44; 
and are too indolent to make themselves acquainted with it &#59; 
teachers enough there would be if they were desired &#8212; but they 
are not desired&#44; and the knowledge of the Hebrew tongue&#44; and 
the knowledge of the law of God is diminishing&#44; waning&#44; but 
not perishing &#33; For this state of things will not last&#59; the age of 
superstition&#44; of a belief in demons&#44; in witchcraft&#44; in phantoms 
of the imagination which once was so prevalent&#44; that enlight&#8211; 
ened and liberal men doubted of the regeneration of the world&#44; 
has passed away &#59; and the present dreadful time&#44; when every 
thing sacred by age&#44; hallowed through antiquity&#44; is approached 
with rude and unholy hands will also take its flight &#59; when the 
lover of his God&#44; the real benefactor of mankind&#44; the sincere 
Israelite&#44; will again raise his head&#44; when his words will be 
listened to with pleasure&#44; and his instructions received with 
avidity and satisfaction. If not by our own reflection&#44; if not 
by our own impulse we will seek the Lord&#44; then He will visit 
us with punishment&#44; the race of the wicked will be swept from 
the face of the earth&#44; and He will probe the remainder like the 
fanning&#8211;mill separates the wheat from the chaff&#59; and if the 
remainder be but small&#44; they will still constitute&#44; although 
diminished&#44; the people of God&#44; the light of the nations. Often 
and often has Israel sinned&#44; often and often have the wicked 
been plucked out and removed out of the vineyard of the Lord&#44; 
the house of Israel &#59; still has Israel never ceased to be a people&#44; 
still has religion never been wanting of defenders. But why

will we tempt the anger of God &#63; why will we wait till the fire 
is kindled which will consume us &#63; We have every induce&#8211; 
ment to be a religious&#44; a good&#44; a holy people &#59; superstition has 
no hold in our faith &#59; sciences can be encouraged by the sin&#8211; 
cerest&#44; the most pious Israelite &#59; the pursuit of gain within 
lawful limitations is permitted&#44; nay&#44; encouraged by our law &#59; 
pleasure too may be moderately enjoyed &#59; what then is pro&#8211; 
hibited &#63; the excess of every thing &#59; and is it too much to ask 
of man to withhold from inquiring after the essence of the 
Deity&#44; from inveighing against the ways of his Maker&#44; when 
he must be convinced&#44; that no research can reach God&#44; that 
science cannot penetrate Him&#44; and that human ken&#44; human 
infirmity cannot measure the All&#8211;wise &#8212; the Infinite &#8212; the Per&#8211; 
fect &#8212; the Just &#8212; the Omnipotent by the puny scale of the small 
portion of wisdom allotted to us &#63; &#8212; Has not God a right to 
demand of us to observe a day of rest to be devoted to his 
service &#8212; and to confine ourselves in our dealing with the world&#44; 
in the pursuit of lawful gain&#44; to such limits and checks of 
honesty and neighbourly love as He has prescribed in his book 
of law&#63; &#8212; And&#44; lastly&#44; has not Heaven a right to tell man : 
thus far pleasures are lawful&#44; the rest are injurious and unholy&#63; 
Common reason will dictate the answers to our questions&#44; and 
humanity ought to bow with profound reverence to the deci&#8211; 
sion thus given by the all&#8211;wise One&#44; and to submit to his rule 
with meekness and patience. And let us but pursue the lives 
of the godly and of the sinner &#59; and&#44; if nothing else will satisfy 
us&#44; this inquiry must&#44; and dictate to us the lesson which is 
hourly preached by the whole universe : &#34; That in the way of 
piety alone there is life.&#34; The presumptuous sinner says in his 
heart: &#34; There is no Providence.&#34; He pursues the career of 
voluptuousness&#44; of aggrandizement&#44; of ambition&#44; and hesitates 
at nothing &#59; every thing to him is lawful &#59; he defies the Deity : 
he throws out taunts against the Cause of causes : but suddenly 
his end comes&#59; and scarcely is his blasphemy uttered&#44; when 
ofif he is hurried&#44; unconscious even of the moment which 
terminates his worthless existence&#44; and he leaves behind him a 
name&#44; loaded with horrible notoriety&#44; and men say of him : 
&#34; So perished one who forgot his God.&#34; Or even let his fate 
be a milder one&#59; let him be smitten with sickness&#44; the com&#8211;

mon lot of humanity&#59; let him be conscious of the approach of 
death &#59; what agony&#44; what horror fill his mind &#33; I speak not of 
the ignorant&#44; the brutelike infidels&#44; for they are never cited as 
examples by their admirers&#44; but of those who employed their 
talents in misleading the world&#44; or who concealed a course of 
infamy under the outward cloak of conformity with religion &#59; 
no sooner do they feel that their end is coming&#44; than they dread 
its approach&#44; they curse themselves&#44; beg of men to grant them 
life &#33; life &#33; they hope when too late to make amends for past 
misconduct&#44; and at length pass away with the horror of disso&#8211; 
lution before their eyes&#44; and filled with dread at meeting their 
awful Judge who will not&#44; cannot&#44; pass over talents shamefully 
wasted&#44; a life misspent in wickedness&#44; hypocrisy&#44; or unbelief. &#8212; 
Thus perished a Korah&#44; a Dathan&#44; and an Abiram &#59; thus perish&#8211; 
ed a Voltaire&#44; and many an infidel of modern and ancient times. 
But let us look at the reverse of the picture. There walks the 
righteous&#59; his heart is true with his Maker&#59; his mind is filled 
with love towards mankind &#59; in short&#44; he is the child of God&#44; 
the brother of mankind &#59; and when his task is ended&#44; he can 
look with composure upon his reunion with God&#44; for he is 
conscious he has nothing to dread in the judgment to come. 
And thus departed Jacob&#44; Moses&#44; Elisha&#44; and many other good 
men of Israel&#44; as well as of other nations&#44; and no doubt thus 
will pass away many now living&#44; and many yet to be born. 
We&#44; therefore&#44; read in the portion of the law read to&#8211;day 
&#40;Numbers xxiii. 14): 

&#34; May my soul die the death of the righteous&#44; and may my end be like 
him.&#34; 

Bileam had been sent for by the king of Moab&#44; to pronounce 
a malediction upon Israel&#44; vainly imagining that this would 
enable him to exterminate the dreaded and hated race. For 
reasons known to him&#44; God at first refused to letBileam depart 
upon this errand&#44; but ultimately He told him that if he pleased 
he might go&#44; but should not dare to say any thing after his 
arrival contrary to the word of God which might be revealed. 
The gentile prophet felt himself elated with this concession. 

    <pb n="356"/>

and at once resolved to go&#44; and the very next morning he com&#8211; 
menced his journey&#59; upon the way a messenger of the Lord 
opposed his progress&#44; for the reason given : &#34;Because the hated 
journey had been too suddenly resolved upon &#59;&#34; but still he 
was allowed after a slight detention to proceed &#59; and when ar&#8211; 
rived at the court of the king of Moab&#44; he accompanied the 
latter to the hill of the national idol&#44; Baal&#44; where he could see 
a part of the Israelitish camp. Here he prepared several sacri&#8211; 
fices and awaited in a lonely spot the revelation of God. The 
revelation came&#59; but in place of a curse&#44; he was filled by in&#8211; 
spiration with amazement and respect for the glory and great 
destination of our people&#44; when we had not yet existed quite 
forty years. And thus he spoke : 

&#34; From Aram did Balak lead me&#44; Moab&#39;s king from the 
mountains of the East&#44; come curse for me Jacob&#44; and come 
denounce Israel. What shall I curse&#44; whom God not curses&#44; 
and what shall I denounce&#44; whom God not denounces&#63; For 
from the top of rocks I see him&#44; and from hills I behold him &#59; 
behold the people&#44; it dwells alone and is among nations not 
numbered. Who counteth the dust of Jacob&#44; and numbereth 
the fourth part of Israel &#63; May my soul die the death of the 
righteous&#44; and may my end be like him &#33;&#34; 

Filled with the knowledge of the future greatness of the then 
wandering people&#44; a nation then without a home&#44; a nation then 
without a country&#44; save a small strip of land along the Jordan&#39;s 
banks&#44; Bileam assured his friend Balak&#44; the king of Moab&#44; that 
it is useless to curse those whom God wishes to bless &#59; and in 
another place he predicted the further rise and progress of the 
star which shall rise from Jacob&#44; and the rod which shall uprise 
from Israel&#44; and alluded thus to the kingdom of the blessed 
anointed of the Lord&#44; whom Jacob foretold when his end was 
approaching&#44; whom Moses saw in his prophecy&#44; and of whom 
Isaiah so beautifully sung&#44; when predicting: &#34; And a rod shall 
come from Jesse&#39;s stem&#44; and a branch shall flourish from his 
roots.&#34; And then placing before his eyes the whole glory of 
the people&#44; as a nation and as individuals&#44; he wished that his 
death might be the tranquil&#44; the peaceful death of Jacob&#44; whom 
God called Israel&#44; and that he might partake of the happiness 
which was at length to befal the nation springing from him.

Sabbath a delight&#44; honoured as a holy day of the Lord&#44; and 
thou honourest it by abstaining from following thy usual occu&#8211; 
pations&#44; or seeking thy own pleasures&#44; or speaking words : then 
shalt thou find delight in the Lord&#44; and I will cause thee to 
ascend upon the high places of the land&#44; and will let thee enjoy 
the heritage of thy father Jacob &#8212; for the mouth of the Lord 
has spoken it.&#34; 

our Father above&#44; fill us with thy grace&#44; let us receive thy 
blessing&#44; and when the hour of our departure comes&#44; strengthen 
us with thy spirit&#44; and lead us without perturbation&#44; without 
the fear of death&#44; from this life unto thy judgment&#44; and grant

DISCOURSE XXXIV. 

THE PERMANENCE OF THE LAW. 

Protector of Israel&#44; Thou who hast ever shielded thy 
people in their dispersion and captivity&#44; bestow also upon us 
thy watchfulness and goodness&#44; and defend us from the attacks 
which our adversaries and the enemies of thy holy law may 
plan against us&#44; and fortify us in thy faith &#59; so that we may 
always exist to glorify thy exalted name&#44; and proclaim thy 
glory in whatsoever place whither thy providence may lead us. 
Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 
In a former address to you I attempted to exhibit some few 
reasons&#44; why we should prefer the light of revelation to the best 
doctrines elicited through reflection by the most eminent of 
heathen philosophers&#44; even conceding that these doctrines 
should have originated with the heathens themselves. It was 
then shown how far from truth were the noblest conceptions of 
the human mind&#44; and how simple&#44; yet how beautiful were the 
institutions which Moses delivered unto Israel&#44; no less in prac&#8211; 
tice than in precept. But still some doubter may say: &#34;That 
it is one thing to admit the beauty and usefulness of these in&#8211; 
stitutions&#59; yet something very different to believe them as 
essential to salvation&#44; or to concede their unwavering truth and 
permanency.&#34; &#8212; Now if it were&#44; that doubts occur only to the 
minds of the vicious or the non&#8211;Israelites&#44; it were perhaps use&#8211; 
less to trouble you&#44; my brethren&#44; with a refutation of such 
doubts&#59; but unfortunately&#44; Israelites also do doubt&#44; and even 
to the most pure in mind the intercourse with the world will 
occasion perplexing inquiries&#44; which it may not be in his power 
so soon to solve&#44; as may be conducive to establish his peace 
of mind. &#8212; We see around us men of various persuasions&#44; and 
some also of no fixed moral principles&#59; still every one claims 

    <pb n="359"/>

60 THE PERMANENCE OF THE LAW. 

of being in the right way&#44; as though the right way&#44; which 
from its simplicity and truth can be but one&#44; were manifold 
and diversified. We may go a step further and maintain that&#44; 
strictly speaking&#44; there are but certain fixed actions&#44; to do which 
is to do right &#59; but where shall we find two persons exactly 
doing the same things&#44; even assuming that they should main&#8211; 
tain the same opinions&#63; But this consideration&#44; of the uncer&#8211; 
tainty whether we act at all times right or not&#44; needs not to 
disturb us too much&#59; since our almighty Father&#44; knowing our 
imperfect organization&#44; expects not perfection from us&#59; as the 
Psalmist says : &#34; And their heart was not true with Him&#44; and 
they trusted not in his covenant. But He&#44; the merciful One&#44; 
pardoned their sin&#44; and would not destroy&#59; and often kept back 
his anger&#44; and awakened not all his wrath. And He remem&#8211; 
bered that they were flesh.&#34; &#40;Psalm Ixxviii.) Still in point of 
fact&#44; there is but one right way&#44; and this way is the one pointed 
out by the revelation of God. For&#44; the man of no principle&#44; 
except his own vague ideas of right and wrong&#44; can have no 
guide save interest and expediency&#59; and as these guides are 
different with different persons&#44; and constantly changing their 
position with the same persons even&#44; it follows&#44; that to measure 
the right by this standard would be to admit a constant change 
in its quality and application &#59; and that which is wrong in one 
would be right in another &#59; and what was condemned to&#8211;day 
might meet our approbation to&#8211;morrow. Such a rule of life 
would&#44; in place of tranquilizing the mind and establishing peace 
in society&#44; tend to disturb both the mind of the individual&#44; and 
the welfare of the world at large&#44; to such a degree&#44; that the 
contemplation of it presents nothing but horror to the lovers of 
their species. &#8212; Where next shall we look for the desired stand&#8211; 
ard&#63; From men in general&#44; let us ascend to the favoured few&#44; 
who are endowed with powers of intellect beyond their fel&#8211; 
lows &#59; but are they capable of deciding so unerringly as to 
become our guides&#63; do their bodies not sicken&#63; do their 
thoughts never become clouded&#63; remains their judgment always 
unimpaired&#63; and has interest nothing to do in making their 
opinions turn to the right and left &#63; and&#44; lastly&#44; are they infal&#8211; 
lible in their decisions&#63; To all these questions&#44; we must re&#8211; 
turn an answer unfavourable to the idea of the expediency of 

    <pb n="360"/>

adopting the promulgation of any one wise man as the standard 
oftright&#44; for even a Solomon may be obnoxious to the want of 
perfection&#44; in goodness&#44; in wisdom&#44; and in consistency. &#8212; Let us 
next go into the assemblies of the honoured and great ones of the 
land &#59; but there we shall find confusion even worse confused. 
Interest there rules with a potent hand&#59; popular favour is to 
be courted&#59; popular applause is to be won &#59; the million is to be 
propitiated &#59; and each individual bows at the altar of fear and self&#8211; 
aggrandisement&#44; and sacrifices to them often the dearest interest 
of his country&#44; and tramples upon the rights and liberties of his 
fellow&#8211;men&#44; to gratify his own vaunting ambition. Even if 
there arises occasionally a fearless man&#44; who dares to hold up 
the mirror to the corruption which overspreads the state&#44; who 
is bold enough to tell his compeers that they are ruining the 
commonwealth by the reckless course they are pursuing&#44; where 
does he find listeners &#63; where are those that follow his stan&#8211; 
dard&#63; And even let us suppose the patriot&#8211; triumphant &#8212; does 
he not become in his turn the tyrant &#63; Does he not practise the 
same revolting acts of oppression which caused the downfal of 
those against whom he strove so valiantly &#63; And let us not 
forget the awful lesson which the history of a civilized country 
taught us not many years back&#44; and whose crimes in the way 
of moral and political reform&#44; or revolution I should have said&#44; 
were so great as to cause one of the greatest defenders and pro&#8211; 
moters of its excesses to exclaim on the scafibld&#44; as she yielded 
up her head to the axe of her executioner: &#34; liberty&#44; liberty&#44; 
how many crimes are committed in thy name&#33;&#34; Assemblies 
of the wise therefore cannot teach us what is right. &#8212; Let us 
next go among the religious sects&#44; among whom the earth is 
divided. But there too the weakness of human nature will 
astound and baffle us. One will claim its doctrines to be de&#8211; 
rived from a god who walked on earth &#59; and look into its rules 
and you will see them claiming human sacrifices as a pleasant 
offering to its gods&#44; and its temples you will find defiled by the 
blood of innocents. Another sect will teach you that all but 
its own adherents are children of perdition&#44; and that its doctrines 
must be preached unto all men by fire and the sword. Another&#44; 
and a numerous people it is&#44; and its power is widely extended

over the earth&#44; its armies and its fleets are the terror of all 
nations&#44; and its wisdom and its learning may well excite c>ur 
astonishment&#44; teaches that for the sake of saving mankind from 
everlasting damnation a portion of the deity became enclosed 
in a body of flesh&#44; dwelt for a space of time among men&#44; and 
then sufiered death by the hands of those whom to save he was 
sent. Further&#44; that salvation is to be obtained only through a 
belief&#44; or faith&#44; as it is termed&#44; in these supposed facts&#44; and that 
he&#44; thus deputed&#44; abrogated the covenant which the Lord of 
hosts had made with Israel&#44; and that further by our unwilling&#8211; 
ness to accept of the new covenant&#44; as it is called&#44; we forfeited 
our right and former claim as the elect people&#44; and more still&#44; 
that those nations who have adopted the new creed have been 
chosen in our stead&#44; and that the new dispensation has been 
substituted as a better one and to the exclusion of the first 
covenant of God. Here you have briefly laid before you a 
view of the various rules of life which have obtained currency 
among men&#44; and&#44; with the exception of the small number of 
Israelites&#44; all other men&#44; under various modifications&#44; are mem&#8211; 
bers of these various creeds&#44; that is to say&#44; they are either 
heathens&#44; Mohamedans&#44; or Nazarenes. To sift the evidences 
by which each of these various systems is supported&#44; and to 
prove its insufiiciency as the universal rule of right is easily 
practicable. For as to heathenism and the law of Mohamed&#44; 
they can scarcely be presumed by their very followers to be 
based upon historical truth&#44; even setting out of sight their doc&#8211; 
trines of doubtful morality&#44; although it may freely be conceded 
that the followers of these systems may nevertheless and in 
spite of the defectivenessof their codes be good and moral men. 
An extended examination need not be gone into&#44; as we live not 
among followers of Brahma and Mohamed&#44; and since we are 
never in these countries invited to join those sects. But in re&#8211; 
ference to the third class&#44; the Nazarenes&#44; we can briefly answer 
them : you say the ancient law was abrogated&#59; admit it for 
argument&#39;s sake&#59; but the question recurs&#44; where are the new 
duties laid down in the new code which are to be followed in 
lieu of the precepts admitted by you also as of divine origin&#63; in 
what passage of your books have you any special legislation&#44; un&#8211; 
less it be a reference to the law and the prophets&#63; And if the

law and the prophets are sufficient to refer to&#44; without enacting 
new laws&#44; how can it be possible then that the law has been 
abrogated &#63;&#8212; Farther&#44; to establish the truth of any system based 
upon&#44; as it is alleged&#44; and confirmed by&#44; and confirming the 
books of our canon&#44; it must first be established that the new 
does not contradict and overthrow the old &#59; but I need not tell 
you&#44; brethren&#44; that the doctrine of the sacrifice of a portion of 
the deity to satisfy the other portion is nowhere&#44; as far as we 
Jews understand the Scriptures&#44; as much as alluded to &#59; for 
God and man to be one is repugnant to our ideas of the purity&#44; 
indivisibility&#44; and holiness of God &#59; that the claim for a new&#8211; 
code being established upon the ruins of the old is plainly con&#8211; 
tradictory of two various prophecies&#44; one of which says : &#34; And 
in thee also &#40;meaning Moses&#44;) they shall believe forever.&#34; 
Exodus xix: 9. &#59; and the other enjoins : &#34; Remember ye the law 
of Moses my servant&#44; which I have commanded him in Horeb 
for all Israel&#44; statutes and judgments.&#34; Malachi iii. 22. So then 
it will appear that the first prophet under the Mosaic dispensa&#8211; 
tion&#44; as well as the last of the series of those illustrious men&#44; 
who taught the world wisdom and piety&#44; testified as emphati&#8211; 
cally as words can make it&#44; that the law and statutes proclaimed 
at Horeb were to be permanent&#44; fixed&#44; and unchangeable. And 
we come at length to the proposition which clearly follows from 
what has just been said&#44; that the books called the Old Testa&#8211; 
ment by the Nazarenes are either false or true alone&#44; to the 
exclusion of any other book or system&#44; and that admitting their 
truth and the necessity of obeying them to ensure salvation 
does in no way concede the truth of any other additional book 
or code&#44; or the obligation of believing a single word or idea 
in addition to what they contain. &#8212; We are fully aware&#44; that 
each class of men and also every individual supporting certain 
ideas concerning the rule of right can&#44; by some show of reason&#44; 
maintain their own side of the question&#44; and to the superficial 
observer they may appear to refute triumphantly all objections &#59; 
but let me assure you&#44; that in no one instance yet have our 
opponents been able to gainsay our assertions&#44; and only by 
imposing silence on us through the terror of persecution have 
they answered our arguments. Let it not be imagined&#44; how&#8211; 
ever&#44; that it is arrogance in us to assume that we alone are 

    <pb n="363"/>

right &#59; for even I&#39;ejecting all belief in revelation&#44; it must still 
be confessed&#44; that at a very early period we alone rejected the 
follies of superstition&#44; and adopted a system of moral philoso&#8211; 
phy in the highest degree sublime and beautiful&#44; as has been 
shown on a former occasion&#44; so that in place of a disbelief in a 
direct revelation removing our astonishment&#44; it increases it the 
more. We have now arrived at the following conclusions&#44; that 
a belief in a revelation is the only consistent belief&#44; since&#44; 
besides its reasonableness&#44; all the world&#44; with but few excep&#8211; 
tions at most&#44; acquiesce in it under some shape or other&#59; 
and that it is equally reasonable to look for the rule of right in 
the Mosaic revelation alone&#44; though we do maintain&#44; that 
it is futile to look for it elsewhere. Understand the question 
well &#59; it is not said that no other person but a Jew can be good&#44; 
but merely that no one can be upon the right way&#44; unless he 
obeys the statutes of the Mosaic code&#44; and that moreover it is 
not being a believer merely of the doctrines of this law which 
constitutes the Israelites&#44; but the obeying them. Having pre&#8211; 
mised thus much&#44; and shown where we can find an unvarying 
guide to righteousness and justice&#44; we will dispense for the pre&#8211; 
sent with all arguments to prove the tenets of our religion to be 
good and beneficial&#44; and merely confine ourselves to the subject 
we proposed for our consideration&#44; to prove the necessity of 
believing in the truth of the law&#44; its permanency&#44; and its neces&#8211; 
sity to insure our salvation. It needs not much penetration to 
discover&#44; that the God who created all&#44; and who governs all&#44; is 
able to punish and reward every man according to his merits. 
Farther&#44; that if we see certain acts of God upon earth coming 
in consequence of certain acts of men&#44; we must say&#44; that 
because of these acts of men God acted so on his part. And 
lastly&#44; if certain events have been foretold as sure to happen in 
consequence of certain deeds&#44; we must acknowledge&#44; if the pre&#8211; 
diction is verified&#44; that because of the conditions accomplished&#44; 
the predicted events came to pass&#44; and consequently that the 
person who made the prediction was accurately informed of the 
future&#44; that is to say&#44; he spoke the truth &#59; and as no man can of 
his own accord know what the future will bring forth&#44; he must 
have been informed by the omniscient One&#44; or in other words&#44; 
that the person thus speaking was a prophet of God&#44; and by Him 

    <pb n="364"/>

inspired to speak a message to mankind for their guidance and to 
warn them of the consequence of their doings. If now we apply 
these conditions to our law&#44; we shall find that it can stand the 
test of these principles of sound reason. For as to its doctrines 
in the first place&#44; we are taught to believe that only from the 
Creator alone proceed all events&#44; that through his blessing 
countries are at peace and happy &#59; the fields are clad with ver&#8211; 
dure &#59; the trees loaded with fruit&#44; and beasts and men sated 
with bounty. In the next place we must discover that in con&#8211; 
sequence of our people disobeying the will of God&#44; as laid down 
in the Bible&#44; they were visited with signal punishment&#44; and as 
reasoning beings we must conclude that the punishment was 
sent by the all&#8211;wise Judge to avenge the infraction of the law. 
Lastly&#44; upon inspecting the Bible&#44; we shall find a number of 
predictions made at various times from Noah&#44; the second father 
of mankind&#44; to the termination of the prophecies&#44; some of 
which have been fulfilled&#44; others which are now in process of 
being fulfilled&#44; and others&#44; to judge from analogy&#44; which will 
eventually be accomplished. All this proves&#44; that those per&#8211; 
sons who pronounced these predictions were inspired by the 
Disposer of events&#44; and consequently&#44; that as children of this 
Disposer of all&#44; we are bound to believe and confide in his 
annunciations&#44; for to disbelieve would be in efi&#39;ect to deny the 
truth&#44; which&#44; even if there were no punishment consequent 
upon disbelief&#44; would be to confide in our reason&#44; or what we 
might be pleased to call reason&#44; in preference to yielding our 
judgment to Him who is infinitely wise and infallible. To 
demand therefore to rest our hopes of salvation in a belief of 
the holy law and to obey its precepts&#44; is only to ask of us mor&#8211; 
tals to confide and acquiesce in the judgment of the source of 
all wisdom&#44; and to follow those rules&#44; &#40;which&#44; coming from One 
who never changes&#44; must naturally be unchangeable&#44;) as have 
been laid before us as the everlasting rule of life. It will there&#8211; 
fore strike you&#44; brethren&#44; that the denunciation of punishment 
was not a mere idle threat&#44; and that the punishment itself was 
not sent merely to gratify a feeling of revenge&#44; for revenge is 
a passion&#44; and passions are incompatible with the nature of the 
Deity&#59; but the punishment was announced as impending to 
warn mankind of the dangers they were incurring for disobe&#8211;

dience : and when they turned a deaf ear to the admonitions so 
kindly vouchsafed&#44; punishment&#44; the natural consequence of sin&#44; 
soon followed to prove the truth and justice of God. It is thus 
therefore&#44; that the accomplishment of the words of the law 
proves its truth&#44; and its truth being proved&#44; it remains for us to 
adopt its precepts and to follow the path pointed out by it as 
the road to everlasting life. 

Permit me now to draw your attention to the terrible admo&#8211; 
nition which Moses pronounced a few days before his removal 
to the land of everlasting life&#44; when he was about to resign the 
shepherd&#39;s staff&#44; he had wielded so long and so faithfully over 
the flock of the Lord&#44; into the trusty hands of his servant and 
follower&#44; Joshua&#44; the son of Nun. Many miracles had been 
wrought through him &#59; many a time had doctrines of peace&#44; 
laws of life&#44; and statutes of salvation been promulged through 
him &#59; many battles had been fought under his guidance &#59; often 
also had sinners been rebuked through the spirit that spoke 
within him &#59; and just before his departure he only needed yet 
to leave behind him a measure by comparing which with future 
events all succeeding ages maght have an unerring means to 
verify the revelation given to the Israelites at the time they 
went out of Egypt. Blessings were promised for obedience: 
temporal prosperity on the one hand&#44; and a spiritual holiness 
on the other &#59; a peaceful people and a holy nation should Israel 
become&#44; if they would consent to be in truth the adorers of the 
God of their fathers. But the wrath of Heaven was to be kin&#8211; 
dled against them&#44; if they transgressed the covenant which had 
been made with them&#44; to prove to them in their latest genera&#8211; 
tion&#44; that only through obedience to the divine will&#44; could 
Israel be happy. dreadful indeed were the words which fell 
upon the ears of our ancestors&#44; when they were told that : 
&#34; They should grope about at midday like the blind gropes 
about in the dark&#44;&#39; aye&#44; that their afflictions should be so great&#44; 
that they should be so far removed from friendly assistance&#44; 
as the blind who gropes his way in darkness with no 
kind hand to save him from stumbling&#59; and how truly has 
this been fulfilled &#33; Ages of suffering have passed over us. 
and even now our afflictions are not ended &#33; How many 
thousands were slaughtered&#44; how many innocents were plun&#8211;

dered for no evil they had done&#44; but solely because they 
bore the hated name of Jew&#59; and who heeded their sufferings&#63; 
Who cared for the blood that flowed &#63; Who minded how many 
stakes were kindled &#63; It was but the Hebrew that laid in the 
dungeon&#59; it was but the Israelite that groaned under the blow &#59; 
it was but the Jew that shrieked as the flames slowly devoured 
him &#33; And were it not that we had been dispersed&#44; were it 
not that persecution could not overtake us simultaneously 
in all countries&#44; the name of the seed of Jacob had long since 
perished. But thanks be to Him who woundeth and also 
healeth&#44; and who prepareth the balsam&#44; even before the blow 
is struck&#33; He caused us&#44; when wandering from our land&#44; to be 
scattered wherever mankind dwelt&#44; and alwa3&#39;s caused some to 
compassionate us&#44; when others laid snares for our feet. So 
that we were preserved in diminished numbers&#44; but still pre&#8211; 
served&#44; a nation one and undivided&#44; to glorify the Name&#44; the 
honoured and fearful&#44; the everlasting Lord our God. In this 
also we discover the quality of goodness of the most extended 
manner and of that mysterious nature which the prophet alluded 
to when saying: &#34; In anger thou rememberest to be merciful.&#34; 
&#40;Habakkuk iii 2.) It were easy and at the same time highly in&#8211; 
structive to compare every one of the curses with its accom&#8211; 
plishment &#59; but this would lead us farther than necessary&#44; and 
I believe that every one of you can find no doubt a multitude 
of illustrations from his own reading and observation. But 
one of the most striking I will merely refer to before closing 
the subject for the present&#44; and elucidate a little more largely 
its literal accomplishment. 

&#34; And thou shalt become an astonishment&#44; a proverb and a by&#8211;word among 
all the nations whither the Lord will lead thee :&#34; Deut. xxviii. 37. 

If ever any prophecy was triumphantly vindicated by its 
accomplishment it is surely this dreadful one spoken by the 
father of the prophets. Understand its full import&#44; and you 
will need no further illustration of the truth of Moses. The 
Israelites were at that time a wandering people&#44; scarcely known 

    <pb n="367"/>

to those nations even that were leading their usual predatory 
and erratic life in the great deserts of Arabia&#44; where the Israel&#8211; 
ites had been tarrying for forty years. It was but a few months 
previous to this time&#44; that the first dawning of the accomplish&#8211; 
ment of the promise relative to the inheritance of the land of 
Canaan had taken place&#44; and Moses himself announced that he 
would have to leave the actual fulfilment of the promises made 
through him to be brought about by another. Yet it was under 
such circumstances&#44; where no human wisdom could foresee 
what actually has occurred&#44; that the gifted above all men laid 
the coming&#44; dark&#44; frowning&#44; future&#44; before the people whom he 
had guided&#44; and warned them of the dismemberment of that 
splendid&#44; happy government which had been just established&#44; 
and told them that the national name should become a proverb 
and a by&#8211;word among all the nations of the earth. And&#44; alas&#33; 
how has our people been hurled about&#33; How has our mighty 
state fallen&#33; And how has the enemy&#44; that ne&#39;er before durst 
even to approach the walls of Jerusalem&#44; the chosen city of the 
Lord&#44; and where He had promised to let his glory dwell&#44; broken 
down its walls&#44; battered its gates&#44; devastated its houses&#44; pro&#8211; 
faned the temple&#44; and burnt down the sanctuary with the fire 
of desolation&#33; And the remnant of Israel &#8212; how have they 
been scorned&#44; derided&#44; hated&#44; and spurned&#33; How insultingly 
have our foes borne their triumph &#59; and although the age of 
active persecution may be said to have passed away from many 
countries&#44; still how little fellow&#8211;feeling is manifested for the 
Jew&#33; Aye&#44; we are said to dwell in darkness&#44; when the law of 
God is our light. The Almighty is invoked to change our 
heart&#59; yet it is not to bring us back to his service&#44; but to cause 
us to adopt systems which we loathe&#44; against which our spirit 
revolts&#44; and which we have rejected amidst persecutions in&#8211; 
numerable&#44; which we scorned&#44; though contumely and death 
were our only other alternative&#33; Besides&#44; how many means 
are tried to wipe away the hated name of the Hebrew from 
amongst men&#33; How many bribes are offered for apostacy &#8212; 
how many snares laid to lead us astray&#59; &#8212; to the Jesv as such 
the gates of preferment are closed&#59; but let him only pretend to 
change&#44; and riches&#44; honours&#44; pleasures&#44; and offices are ofiered to 
him as the reward meet for his baseness&#33; And if we come to

claim from the land where we are born&#44; whose burdens we 
bear equally with the other inhabitants&#44; whose homes and 
whose liberties we are willing to defend with our treasures&#44; with 
our blood&#44; and with our lives &#59; we are told&#44; that it is impossible 
to put us on a level with other men&#44; that it would be blasphemy 
to think of emancipating the Jew&#44; as they call it &#33; But have 
we no claims upon mankind &#63; Is not civilization indebted to 
us&#63; Would sciences have flourished had we not been&#63; Would 
the liberties of mankind have been so well secured were it not 
for our law&#44; the promulgation of which broke the bonds of 
slavery&#44; and rent asunder the chains of superstition under which 
all Europe groaned during the middle ages &#63; But what avails 
it to hold up our claims to the equality of rights&#44; which if even 
conceded in words&#44; would in all likelihood be denied to us in 
eflfect&#44; as long as the prejudice against our name does last&#44; and 
whilst other sects look upon us as their inferiors&#44; or as heretics 
to be pitied for their blindness even if tolerated from mere 
compassion. Virtue&#44; wisdom&#44; and learning&#44; nay the comliness 
of the outward person are considered as qualities of rare occur&#8211; 
rence amongst Jews&#59; and low cunning&#44; grovelling meanness&#44; a 
desire for overreaching the unwary&#44; and base ingratitude&#44; are 
looked upon as the proper characteristics of the Hebrews. 
And when our excellences are too marked&#44; when our virtue 
is too self&#8211;evident&#44;when our disinterestedness challenges a doubt 
even&#44; it is then said: &#34; It is a pity they are Jews&#33;&#34; Let no one 
say&#44; that this is a picture of vulgar prejudice merely &#59; would 
that it were so&#33; It is our portion from the world&#44; whether 
learned or unlearned&#59; it is the contumely attached to us for 
our manifold transgressions&#44; it is the indelible stain which God 
has fixed upon our race for their stiffnecked disobedience. 

&#34; Thou shalt be an astonishment&#44; a proverb&#44; and a by&#8211;word.&#34; 
If a man reverts to our history and follows our onward course 
from a nomadic tribe to a powerful kingdom under the wise 
Solomon with so many bounties scattered over a fertile soil&#44;with 
institutions so greatly tending to spread peace and contentment&#44; 
with a Providence watching as it were peculiarly over our 
Avelfare : astonishment will he excited at our blindness in 
throwing away such blessings by the sheer folly of obeying our 
own impulses in preference to the dictates of Heaven&#33; &#8212; If ad&#8211;

monitions are addressed to a people and they are warned by 
their preachers&#44; they will be told&#44; that their punishment will 
be equal to that of Israel unless they repent&#33; &#8212; If an outcast 
from divine favour is to be painted&#44; the picture of the dispersed 
Jewish nation recurs to the mind of the thinking&#59; and be the 
sect heathen&#44; Mahomedan&#44; or Nazarene&#44; nay&#44; even the blind 
infidels&#44; they value themselves especially that they are exempt 
from the curse of being numbered amongst us&#33; &#8212; Thus&#44; great 
God&#44; has thy anger reached us&#59; thus&#44; merciful One&#44; have thy 
arrows pierced our hearts&#33; But just are thy ways&#33; We were 
tired of serving Thee&#44; we loathed thy covenant&#44; we sought to 
imitate the ways of those who knew not thy service&#59; and we 
now must serve those whose friendship we courted&#44; and bear 
the shame of our iniquities&#33; 

Yes&#44; brethren&#44; we were warned &#59; the outraged covenant 
cried aloud for vengeance&#59; but what did we care &#63; we vainly 
thought the evil would not come&#44; perhaps we fancied the 
Almighty unconscious and heedless of our course&#59; but the evil 
at length did come&#44; and we were thus taught that the law given 
through Moses was true&#44; unchangeable and necessary to our 
welfare. Even the persecutions we have had to endure since 
our dispersion have tended to confirm the truth of prophecy&#44; 
and to keep us unmingled and unpolluted by an intercourse 
which the hollow friendship of the gentiles would perhaps 
have produced. Israel has been shaken by the storms of ad&#8211; 
versity&#44; but not overwhelmed&#44; as the prophet of Shiloh&#44; the 
aged and blind Achijah&#44; spoke to the wife of Jeroboam: &#34; And 
the Lord will smite Israel&#44; as the reed is shaken in the water&#44; 
and drive Israel from off this good land&#44; which He has given 
to their fathers&#34; &#40;1 Kings&#44; xiv. 15)&#44; because they had incensed 
the Lord. The .punishment as we have seen has not been 
withheld&#44; but neither has the blessing been denied&#59; for as the 
reed can be shaken by the flood and wind&#44; but through its 
natural elasticity resists them both&#44; so that it is not broken by 
what would have felled the mighty oak or rooted up the cedars 
on Lebanon : so have we also constantly risen after every per&#8211; 
secution&#44; and have remained unbroken despite of the thousands 
of ills which have assailed us : and regardless of the contempt 
of the world&#44; and heedless of the calumnies of the gentiles&#44; we

are still the most beloved&#44; the protected people of the Lord. 
Can there be a stronger argument of the truth of the law&#44; which 
has preserved a handful of people entire&#44; when the mightiest 
empires have been swept away and have left not a wreck even 
behind &#63; Let this therefore be our consolation&#44; that we are in 
possession of the rule of right &#59; a rule handed down to us from 
heaven&#59; a rule under which in God&#39;s own good time all nations 
will be made happy&#44; when it will be fulfilled what Isaiah fore&#8211; 
told: &#34;Rise and shine for thy light has come&#44; and the glory of 
the Lord has shone out upon thee. For&#44; behold&#33; darkness 
covers the earth&#44; and a thick fog the nations&#44; but over thee the 
Lord will shine and his glory will be seen over thee. And 
nations shall go by thy light&#44; and kings by the brightness of 
thy shining. &#40;Ix. 2.)

Brethren &#33; 

Human life has been aptly compared to a journey&#44; which 
every one has to travel to its close. On this journey all are met 
by dangers which they must overcome&#44; and by adventures which 
they must encounter&#44; and no rest can be expected till the jour&#8211; 
ney is finished&#44; as the dangers thereof are constantly renewed&#44; 
and constantly varying their position&#44; so that the utmost vigi&#8211; 
lance is requisite to remain unharmed amidst the difficulties&#44; 
and to avoid getting into devious by&#8211;ways&#44; which encircle the 
road of life on all sides. But suppose a traveller should lose 
his way&#44; and find himself at a distance from the path he is to 
travel&#44; would it not become necessary for him to endeavour to 
regain the highway&#44; if he is at all desirous of reaching his origi&#8211; 
nal destination&#63; and if he is unable to correct himself&#44; would it 
not be well to ask of those whom he meets for directions how 
to proceed&#63; And if he is unmindful of his progress&#44; if heed&#8211; 
lessly he takes no care whether he be right or wrong&#44; whom but 
himself can he blame&#44; if at last he finds his onward pi&#8211;ogress de&#8211; 
barred by insurmountable obstacles&#63; Just so it is with those 
who travel the path of life &#59; for whether we are willing or un&#8211; 
willing to make any exertions&#44; we are once here&#44; and even must 
exist our allotted space below&#44; till our Father calls us back to 
Him. And whilst here&#44; we must be agents&#44; must be active ac&#8211; 
cording to the capacities with which we have been gifted&#44; and 
according as we endeavour to fulfil the will of our Maker&#44; 
we are either good or bad. During our entire course&#44; however&#44; 
we are constantly allured by the world without us&#44; either to 
good or to evil &#59; some circumstances&#44; some persons&#44; call us to 
the house of God to worship and to adore &#59; but there are not 
wanting opportunities nor men that call us away into vice and 
sin. The dangers which thus threaten us&#44; and which&#44; let me 
add&#44; threaten us from the moment we begin to think&#44; are two&#8211;

fold &#59; first&#44; those produced by circumstances which&#44; as it were&#44; 
address our senses silently&#44; yet with a language not to be mis&#8211; 
understood &#59; the others may be termed the results of evil com&#8211; 
munication&#44; which allure the unwary by false pretences&#44; and by 
colouring the wrong with all the appearance of right. The 
means of ascertaining what is right are given by the pre&#8211; 
cepts laid down for us in the law&#44; and if ever an opportunity 
presents itself for disobeying them&#44; if this opportunity be ever 
so tempting&#44; we must remain firm&#44; because we are certified&#44; that 
to disobey would be to sin against the declared will of Heaven. 
So the antidote to sin&#44; in the first instance&#44; is the knowledge of 
the law&#44; for without this knowledge our very ignorance must 
misguide us. When evil associates assail us to go along with 
them the road to destruction&#44; if they endeavour to counteract 
the knowledge of the right which we possess by impressing 
upon us its futility&#44; and that there is no necessity to abide by 
precepts which are confessedly a restraint upon our natural in&#8211; 
clinations : we should tell ourselves that the law is not futile&#44; 
when we discover at every step&#44; that obedience to it brings 
comfort to the doer thereof&#44; and promotes peace and goodwill 
among mankind&#59; and that&#44; if there were no other punishment 
even save the diseases of the body and the infirmities of the 
mind&#44; consequent upon the indulgence of the carnal desires&#44; 
this alone would already be enough to account for the restraints 
laid upon us by the dictates of the divine law. But&#44; alas &#33; how 
great is the number of those who become sinners by opportu&#8211; 
nity &#33; how great the number of those who listen to evil advice&#44; 
and who leave the right &#8212; pursue the evil &#8212; and die before the 
knowledge of their own wrong has impressed itself upon their 
minds &#33; It is strange indeed&#44; that seeing so many evils conse&#8211; 
quent on sin&#44; man could yet be seduced to prefer it to piety&#59; 
but still the fact is&#44; that sinning is the lot of mankind&#44; and pun&#8211; 
ishment their consequent doom. And because our Father in 
heaven knows our natures. He does not inflict punishment im&#8211; 
mediately after the sin has been committed&#44; but withholds&#44; to 
use the Bible language&#44; &#34; his anger&#44;&#34; and waits to see whether 
the sinner will not repent and return to the practice of the right. 
Now the question is: &#34; How is a man to do&#44; when he finds that 
he has been sinning&#63; what should his conduct be to regain the

favour of God&#44; which he has lost&#63; how shall he ward off the 
punishment which so justly threatens him &#63;&#34; A man conscious 
of having been guilty of pursuing the wrong should&#44; in the first 
place&#44; cease at once&#44; and altogether sinning in the manner he has 
been accustomed to do. He is not doing what is demanded of 
him as the first step to repentance&#44; by deferring his reformation 
from day to day&#44; or by breaking off by degrees. For instance&#44; 
if he has been in the habit of eating forbidden food three times 
a day&#59; of violating the Sabbath four times a month&#59; of wrong&#8211; 
ing his fellow&#8211;men once a week &#59; it will not be enough for hrm 
to begin with reducing the amount of his sinning to once a day&#44; 
twice a month&#44; or once in two months&#59; no&#44; this is not repent&#8211; 
ing&#44; this is only to trifle with the Deity&#44; as though we were tell&#8211; 
ing Him&#44; in effect: &#34;Wait&#44; my Lord God&#44; I cannot now reform 
all at once&#44; my habits are too much confirmed&#44; I will mend by 
degrees&#59; I shall indeed be good as soon as my convenience will 
let me.&#34; Indeed&#63; is this repentance&#63; can we thus hope to 
blind the all&#8211;knowing One &#63; Will He believe that our heart 
actually regrets our conduct&#44; when we still cling to it with an 
affection which betokens not a sorrow for past conduct&#63; And 
yet vve hear persons speaking&#44; that they now do wrong&#44; because 
they cannot help themselves&#59; that is to say&#44; their convenience or 
their worldly interest are served by their misconduct&#59; but at some 
future times&#44; in a year or two&#44; when they are rich enough&#44; when 
their health has been too much injured to permit them to par&#8211; 
ticipate in farther excesses&#44; 0&#44; then they will repent entirely&#44; 
but in the meantime some slight reformation mustsufiice. But 
no&#44; brethren&#44; slight reformation is not the way of repentance&#59; a 
ruined house may be sustained by a large number of props 
strongly wedged against the firm ground&#59; but still the ruin is 
not thereby repaired&#59; just so is it with the sinner&#59; if he does 
not build up for himself a new building of righteousness in 
place of the defective one he has been inhabiting in his folly&#44; 
it is but a ruin he inhabits&#44; and sooner or later&#44; the feeble support&#8211; 
ers of the tottering fabric give way&#44; and he&#44; the deluded inhabi&#8211;&#44; 
tant&#44; is crushed by the falling mass when he vainly dreamt 
himself secure. If therefore a man wishes to repent&#44; he must 
cease his unrighteousness at the very instant&#59; delays are dan&#8211; 
gerous&#59; who knows&#44; but before another day has elapsed&#44; his

life on earth may be suddenly cut short&#44; and he be thus called 
hence with all his unforgiven sins on his head&#33; A man mav 
have been deluded&#44; he may have framed excuses for his wrongs&#44; 
whilst he committed them&#59; but this should not be any reason 
for his continuing to act contrary to law&#44; when he discovers 
the error of his ways. If now he has ceased to do wrong&#44; he 
should carefully endeavour to repair in some measure&#44; and to 
the extent of his ability&#44; the wrong he has been doing&#59; he must 
be particular in his religious conduct&#44; and leave no opportunity 
unimproved to do just the opposite of his former sinful con&#8211; 
duct. And in this active reformation he must not regard any 
personal inconvenience he may have to encounter&#59; no pecunia&#8211; 
ry loss must deter him&#59; no fear of ridicule of his former asso&#8211; 
ciates must influence him&#59; for if he does not yield his heart 
entirely to his God&#44; if he esteems the fleeting benefits of riches 
and of pleasure more than he loves the favour of his Maker&#59; 
if he fears more the sneers of the ungodly than the frowns of 
his omnipotent Judge: no reformation has taken place&#44; and his 
sin is not removed&#44; his recovery has at least not been complete. 
But after a man has even actually left off the evil of his ways 
and returned to the practice of the precepts of the law&#44; he 
should still endeavour to satisfy his conscience by acts of pe&#8211; 
nance. Our wise men have recommended&#44; in consonance with 
the annunciations of the prophets&#44; the exercise of the following 
virtues: prayer&#44; fasting&#44; and charity. Prayer we all know to 
mean an outpouring of the heart to our Maker. But this 
prayer should be sincere&#44; the outpouring should go the whole 
length of the sin&#44; and the returning sinner should&#44; in offering 
up his heart&#44; go over the whole course of his misconduct&#44; paint 
to himself his wickedness in its proper deformity&#44; and not en&#8211; 
deavour to frame excuses to himself to ease his troubled con&#8211; 
science&#59; but he should state explicitly&#44; without extenuation&#44; 
the whole of his deeds&#44; and if his mind is troubled&#44; if his feel&#8211; 
ings are pained by the humiliation he submits to&#44; he may rest 
assured that he will ultimately be benefitted by the sincerity 
of his devotion&#59; his feelings will become purified&#44; his mind 
will become elevated&#44; his beating heart will become calmed&#44; 
and ever after he will bless the hour in which he revealed him 
self to himself&#44; and look upon his confessed sins as warnings&#8211; 

    <pb n="375"/>

which will for ever deter him from recurring to his course of 
vice. 

In the same manner&#44; as prayer is the expression of feeling 
in words&#44; so is fasting the expression of contrition in acts. 
By fasting&#44; the sinner reminds himself&#44; and makes an impres&#8211; 
sion on his mind&#44; of the wrong he has been doing&#59; and if the 
fasting follows upon a sincere change of heart&#44; the having once 
done actual penance&#44; will always prevent him from falling into 
the same error&#44; should it ever present itself again to him. It 
is not that God wishes us to punish ourselves&#44; that our depri&#8211; 
vation may be a pleasure to Him &#59; only that our repentance 
may be done in such a manner as to remain unforgotten by us. 
Mere sorrow&#44; even anguished feelings may&#44; after a while&#44; fade 
from the memory&#59; but active repentance&#44; bodily affliction&#44; 
fasting with a knowledge of our sins&#44; can hardly ever be obli&#8211; 
terated from the mind &#59; and besides&#44; whilst fasting the sinner 
will revert constantly to the reason of the penance&#44; and in this 
manner perfect the change of heart&#44; which thought and prayer 
have begun. 

As a third means of propitiating the favour of Heaven&#44; we 
are taught to do charity&#44; not merely to dole out alms to beg&#8211; 
gars&#44; but to bestow our aid to the afflicted&#44; to right the op&#8211; 
pressed&#44; succour the poor&#44; and save the tottering brother from 
falling. If a person having sinned&#44; especially against his 
fellow&#8211;man&#44; and being conscious of his transgression&#44; wishes 
to show his love of God&#44; revived now in him through repent&#8211; 
ance : he should prove that he is now willing and anxious to 
follow his Maker in deeds of benevolence and charity&#59; and in 
place of his having been hard of heart and unmerciful&#44; he 
should&#44; being regenerated&#44; be the friend of the poor&#44; the father 
of the orphan&#44; the protector of the widow&#44; and merciful to 
those whom the world uses despitefully. &#8212; Even if a man should 
not be blessed with riches&#44; and be thus unable to give away 
much in charity&#44; then let him give according to his means&#59; 
and if it be altogether out of his power to give&#44; then let him 
do personal acts of kindness to all who may stand in need of 
them &#59; and there are surely always enough that mourn&#44; and 
over the face of sinful earth sorrow is at all times widely spread. 
Aye&#44; let him who repents enter the abode of sorrow&#44; let him 

    <pb n="376"/>

PRAYER&#44; FASTING&#44; AND CHARITY. 77 

speak comfort to the prisoner&#44; let him dry the tear of the weeping 
orphan&#44; let him endeavour to calm the tumultuous heaving of 
the widow&#39;s grief&#44; let him stand by the couch of sickness and 
wipe away the damps of death from the brow of the departing &#59; 
let him proclaim the goodness of God to him who is despair&#8211; 
ing : and he may rest assured that his return to good&#44; will be 
the most acceptable offering which the sinner can bring to his 
offended Judge. &#8212; As a further step in a permanent repentance 
it were well&#44; that a man should associate with those who fear 
the Lord&#44; eschew the society of the evil&#8211;disposed&#44; avoid temp&#8211; 
tation &#59; and if his fall is at all owing to ignorance&#44; let him go 
to the houses where the law of God is taught&#44; even let him&#44; 
confessing his ignorance&#44; ask advice of those who are better 
informed than himself&#44; just as a traveller&#44; who has gone astray 
asks of those whom he meets&#44; which is the road he ought to 
go. And even one&#44; to whom the statutes of the Lord are fami&#8211; 
liar&#44; should again and again revert to them&#44; frequently read 
and study the life&#8211;dispensing word&#44; and upon every act consult 
what God wills he should do&#44; as a wayfarer looks up to the 
post which at the crossings of the road marks out the path 
which leads him to the haven of his designation. &#8212; Thus forti&#8211; 
fied by prayer&#44; by penance&#44; by charity&#44; and by a study of the 
holy Word&#44; may the repentant sinner freely look upon himself 
as having regained the way of righteousness&#44; and as being again 
likely to become deserving of the divine mercy. &#8212; And although 
our transgressions may be manifold&#44; the mercy of God is still 
greater&#59; if even our sins are countless&#44; the kindness of God is 
still more beyond measure. So&#44; let no one who has sinned 
despair of mercy&#44; let him not look upon himself as an outcast 
from divine favour &#59; but no matter how heavily thy conscience 
be laden&#44; erring brother&#33; come and call upon thy Father and 
Creator&#44; and throw thyself for protection and forgiveness before 
his footstool. Lay open before Him thy heart&#44; and receive the 
reward meet for thy confidence &#59; for know that we are promis&#8211; 
ed&#44; that even if our sins be as red as scarlet&#44; they shall be made 
as white as snow through repentance. &#8212; God has promised us 
forgiveness if we seek it&#59; and it is therefore adding unbelief to 
our other sins&#44; if v&#33;e despair of the fulfilment of the promises 

7&#42;

of mercy. And thus speaks the prophet Hosea in his address 
to Israel : 

&#34; Return&#44; O Israel&#44; unto the Lord thy God&#44; althoug:h degraded through 
thy iniquity. Take but prayers with you&#44; and return to the Lord &#33; Speak 
to Him: O Thou&#44; who forgivest all iniquities&#44; receive graciously our doing 
good&#44; and with our lips we will repay the steers of sacrifice.&#34; xiv. 2&#8211;3. 

Here we are told the consoling truths&#44; that repentance will 
be availing though the iniquities he has been committing have 
brought man to stumbling &#59; and that no sacrifices are absolutely 
necessary but an amendment of the heart&#44; a return to good&#44; and 
an outpouring of a contrite spirit. If sacrifices were alone 
capable of affording atonement&#44; there could at this moment&#44; no 
atonement be made for captive Israel &#59; for we have no temple&#44; 
no priest&#44; no sacrifices. But our Father&#44; when He cast us out 
from our land&#44; did not by punishing us&#44; cast us off from his 
grace &#59; and He is yet our God&#44; although we no longer can lead 
the steer of sacrifice to his holy courts to atone for the trans&#8211; 
gressions of our people on the Day of Atonement. But when 
we assemble in the minor temples in all places of our habita&#8211; 
tions&#44; and institute there a rigid inquiry into our conduct&#44; con&#8211; 
demn sincerely whatever wrong we find&#44; lay our case before 
God&#44; and come away amended in deeds&#44; and resolved in mind 
to be obedient henceforward : we are promised&#44; that God will 
heal the wounds of our apostacy&#44; love us again in his favour&#44; 
and take away his anger from us. Like the blessed dew He 
will be to us&#44; we shall bloom like the rose&#44; and take root like 
the forests on Lebanon. These are the promises of the Lord&#44; 
and we may&#44; therefore&#44; freely give up ourselves to the guid&#8211; 
ance of our better feelings&#44; which constantly draw us to the 
righteous way. And what hinders us&#63; Interest&#44; in the first 
place&#59; because we might lose worldly gain&#44; if we are religious. 
Next&#44; pride &#59; we cannot confess to the world that we have been 
in the wrong in our former doings. Lastly&#44; false shame &#59; we 

    <pb n="378"/>

PRAYER&#44; FASTING&#44; AND CHARITY. 79 

cannot bear to lose the name of an independent spirit&#44; of a deep 
philosophical thinker&#44; which had been given to us for our for&#8211; 
mer contempt of all religious duties. Superadd to these chief 
causes in some&#44; the ruling moral supineness in others&#44; that in&#8211; 
activity which rather yields to the evil passions than grapples 
with them&#44; and you have the whole amount of obstacles to a 
thorough reformation. And are these so very formidable &#63; 
Let us view worldly interest in its strongest points&#44; admit that 
a violation of the law can produce a rich harvest of wealth and 
renown&#59; and still a man must be very short&#8211;sighted if he cannot 
see that these ends never can satisfy all the cravings of the 
mind. And let a person&#39;s riches be ever so great&#44; either he is 
compelled to leave them&#44; or he is not permitted to enjoy them 
even during his whole life &#59; and the man of power does not 
repose on a bed of roses &#59; envy assails him &#59; hatred pursues all 
his steps&#44; and deadly revenge lays schemes against his life. 
Add to which&#44; that no man dies with half of his desires grati&#8211; 
fied&#44; and then answer for yourselves&#44; whether there is aught 
in riches or in power so very tempting&#44; as to sacrifice the ever&#8211; 
lasting interest of the immortal soul to their acquisition or 
retention. 

Pride&#44; I said&#44; will not suffer us to confess ourselves to have 
been in the wrong &#59; but though we can carry a bold front before 
the world all the days of our life&#44; it is impossible to escape the 
notice of God &#59; and consequently it were better at once to 
mortify our pride by an acknowledgment of our error&#44; than to 
incur the inevitable tendency of an unreformed life of sin. 
Further&#44; we should reflect&#44; that but the first beginning will be 
painful&#59; and if we have once conquered our pride&#44; have once 
acknowledged our wrong&#44; the subsequent religious conduct of 
our reformed life will never pain our self&#8211;love any more&#59; on 
the contrary we will look back with satisfaction upon the hour 
when we humbled our pride&#44; when we yielded our spirit&#44; to the 
divine inspiration of repentance. 

False shame also is an obstacle&#44; as has been said &#59; a man has 
had a name of an independent philosopher&#44; and if he should 
yield submission to religion&#44; he of course loses this envied dis&#8211; 
tinction. But what does he lose thereby&#63; he is praised for 
the possession of a positively injurious quality&#44; a blind over&#8211; 

    <pb n="379"/>

80 PRAYER&#44; FASTING&#44; AND CHARITY. 

weaning confidence in his own wisdom&#44; and by repentance he 
yields his judgment to God&#39;s guidance &#59; and thus though he 
humbles himself&#44; and confesses that his own knowledge has been 
no just guide&#44; he thereby acquires a safer conductor&#44; for the pro&#8211; 
fession of the holy law will enable him the better to lead a life 
of piety&#44; humility&#44; and benevolence &#59; and he will earn in place 
of the admiration of the idle&#44; the worthless and the ignorant&#44; 
the satisfaction of the Searcher of hearts&#44; the Knower of all 
secrets&#44; the Judge of all flesh&#44; of Him who punisheth iniquities 
and rewardeth obedience &#33; 

And as to moral supineness preventing reformation&#44; the sinner 
should be reminded that&#44; as with pride&#44; the first effort alone is 
really painful&#44; and by degrees&#44; even the most cherished debauche&#8211; 
ries and extravagancies will become absolutely nauseous &#59; and 
when once a person has confirmed himself in the practice of mo&#8211; 
rality&#44; moderation&#44; and religious observances&#44; no one more than 
himself will be surprised at his blindness and folly in having 
been so long the slave of vice and infidelity. &#8212; Let us&#44; therefore&#44; 
join heart and hand&#44; and resolve firmly to return to the Lord&#44; 
and let each leave off the wrong that is in his hand&#44; and endea&#8211; 
vour to repair as much as possible&#44; the evil he has committed. 
&#34; Let&#44;&#34; as Isaiah says&#44; &#34; the sinner leave his way&#44; and the man 
of wrong his thoughts&#44; and let him return unto the Lord&#44; and 
He will have mercy on him&#44; and to our God&#44; for He is great 
in pardoning.&#34; Thus has the Lord promised &#59; and we the 
children of the first believers&#59; we the descendant of Abraham&#44; 
who left his father&#39;s house by command of God &#8212; of Isaac&#44; who 
was willing to die a sacrifice on the altar of the Lord &#8212; of 
Jacob&#44; who even among idolaters and in servitude never gave 
up his innocence&#59; &#8212; we the inheritors of the everlasting cove&#8211; 
nant&#59; surely we ought not to disbelieve&#44; to hesitate&#44; to despair 
of mercy&#59; and although stumbling through our sins&#44; let each 
recurrence of the season of repentance impress us with the 
necessity of repenting and returning to the way of righteous&#8211; 
ness. And 0&#33; may our eyes live to see the day&#44; when all Israel&#44; 
returning to the God of their fathers in truth and righteousness&#44; 
will exclaim again as in days of old : &#34; The Lord is the God&#44; 
the Lord is the God.&#34; Such a Day of Atonement will indeed

Lord say at its close : &#34; I am now willing to die&#44; since over the 
regenerated earth again walks peace&#44; and in the habitations of 
men again dwell piety and the grace of the Lord.&#34; 

Father of mercy&#33; grant our portion in life and happiness&#44; 
and shield us from famine&#44; from war&#44; and from pestilence &#59; and 
let the year which has just begun be to us and all Israel a year 
of joy&#44; of peace&#44; of light in the law&#44; of health&#44; of content&#8211; 
ment&#59; a year in which thy people may not need the assistance 
of each other or of a foreign people &#59; a year in which Thou 
mayest restrain mortality&#44; pestilence&#44; and destruction from us &#59; 
and upon the people&#44; amongst whom we live grant peace&#44; and 
plenty&#44; and let their hearts be inclined to mercy towards us 
and all Israel our brethren. And 0&#44; Protector of Jacob &#33; arrest 
the arm of persecution&#44; stay the evil advice which our enemies 
give&#44; baffle their thoughts&#44; and render as naught their intentions&#44; 
and show to all nations of the earth&#44; that Thou art our Father 
and Redeemer &#59; and let it be thy will&#44; God of our fathers&#44; to 
let thy glory again dwell among us&#44; and send thy anointed to

82 THE JEWISH FAITH. 

Brethren &#33; 

The religion&#44; by the bestowal of which&#44; God has favoured 
us&#44; demands of us two things &#59; namely&#44; believing or faith&#44; and 
deeds&#44; or in other words active religion. Without a motive 
for action we do not act&#44; and consequently without a motive 
for religious conduct we would certainly not be religious &#59; and 
consequently if we wish to be religious&#44; or to speak more pro&#8211; 
perly&#44; if we are really anxious to secure that great share of hap&#8211; 
piness which flows from an obedience to the divine law&#44; we 
must fortify ourselves previously by an acquisition of such 
feelings as best conduce to such a desirable consummation &#59; or 
what is the same&#44; we must endeavour to grow in faith&#44; and 
strengthen thereby the growth of good deeds &#59; for faith alone 
can be the producer of outward actions&#44; if these actions are to 
have the least claim to sincerity. It is true&#44; any one can prac&#8211; 
tise the same line of conduct pursued by another&#44; without being 
in the least imbued with the feelings of the latter&#59; he may 
accommodate himself to an outward conformity from interest&#44; 
from fear&#44; or even because he would as leave do one thing as 
the other &#59; but it must be evident to even the most charitable 
judge of human infirmities&#44; or the most indulgent palliator of 
human faults&#44; that the conduct of such a hypocrite&#44; coward&#44; or 
indifferent one&#44; cannot in any degree be considered as deserving 
of the smallest degree of approbation &#59; because there is wanting 
that inward impress of hallowed thought which can evidently 
alone stamp it as possessing value and real usefulness. For&#44; let 
the hypocrite be removed from observation&#44; will his conduct 
not change &#63; Let the fearful coward be beyond the fear which 
spell&#8211;bound him&#44; where will his conformity have flown to&#63; 
Let him&#44; who amongst faithful Israelites is an Israelite in his 
outward practice&#44; be placed among those acting otherwise&#44; will 
his indifference not induce him to agree with his present asso&#8211; 
ciates&#63; These questions answer themselves&#44; and unfortunately 
examples are not wanting to prove that they are not based upon 
mere supposition. It remains therefore for us to find out pre&#8211; 
cisely those principles which when cherished will induce&#44; 
amongst all men&#44; a uniform course of action&#44; as far as uniformity 
can be reached by so many thinking beings and who are all 

    <pb n="382"/>

placed in different circumstances&#44; and all labouring under the 
disadvantage of a want of uniformity of instruction and intel&#8211; 
lectual endowments. &#8212; To premise c.we all&#44; every human being&#44; 
even the suicide&#44; constantly strive by every act&#44; unless we are 
at the moment under absolute constraint&#44; to improve our happi&#8211; 
ness&#44; or to avoid an intolerable evil&#44; which two motives&#44; if pro&#8211; 
perly considered&#44; will be found to be identically ihe same &#59; for a 
removal of any evil&#44; let it be ever so small&#44; is an absolute 
increase of happiness to an equal amount. Since now the pur&#8211; 
suit of happiness is our ruling motive&#44; and since every one 
thinks himself properly in pursuit thereof: it is evident&#44; since 
we see men differing so widely in their conduct&#44; and since the 
two extremes of a thing cannot be the same&#44; that it is owing to 
the want of proper information or correct training&#44;which train&#8211; 
ing is in most instances&#44; if not in all&#44; the parent of information. 
And although each one thinks himself acting correctly and in a 
manner which will best secure happiness to himself and those 
dependant upon him : still it is evident that misery is the result 
of many a one&#39;s conduct&#44; misery to himself and misery to 
others. Now it is not to be denied&#44; that there is hardly any 
line of conduct&#44; or we may at once admit for argument&#39;s sake&#44; 
that there is none&#44; which will exempt us from evil &#59; but it is 
equally true&#44; that many ways there are which will be more 
useful than others &#59; and as believers in an overruling Pro&#8211; 
vidence we must say&#44; that upon the way of righteousness&#44; there 
is&#44; when properly viewed&#44; no evil whatever &#59; as even the appa&#8211; 
rent ills are always leading to some beneficial ending. It is 
therefore at once incumbent on us to seek this way which will 
lead to so glorious a result&#44; and not alone this&#44; but to acquire 
such feelings&#44; to the exclusion of all others&#44; as will prevent us 
from ever leaving this good way&#44; when once we have entered 
upon it. And let it be observed&#44; that it is mainly for our own 
sakes that we should do so&#44; for by the accruing happiness no 
one will be more benefitted than ourselves.&#34; 

As following from what has been said we will now maintain&#44; 
that a belief and an acquiescence in religious doctrines&#44; clearly 
defined and well understood&#44; will hold the mind devoted to 
religious conduct&#44; and what is the same will insure happiness. &#8212; 
Some persons may object to creeds&#44; as demanding an acqui&#8211;

escence in things not understood&#44; in doctrines not consonant 
with reason &#59; but such on opinion is entirely erroneous&#44; and 
shows an ignorance with those doctrines which are attempted 
to be undervalued. &#8212; We will proceed now to the consideration 
of the doctrines of faith&#44; which are the foundation of the reli&#8211; 
gion which we profess. In the first place&#44; we have as the foun&#8211; 
dation of all religion&#44; the belief in the existence of a God &#59; 
secondly&#44; we are to acknowledge that this God made known to 
mankind his will for their guidance&#59; and thirdly&#44; that we 
are accountable to this God for a dereliction from&#44; or to be 
rewarded by Him for an obedience to&#44; his will as to us 
declared. I have said that the foundation of our religion is 
entirely consonant with reason&#44; and that besides its doctrines 
can be clearly defined and readily understood &#59; it will there&#8211; 
fore be now necessary to elucidate this assertion entirely to 
your satisfaction&#44; although this may by some be considered as 
hardly necessary&#44; where the proof is so obvious. &#8212; The first 
fundamental principle says : &#34; There is a God.&#34; Yes&#44; there is 
a God &#33; all nature cries&#59; there is a God&#33; who made all that our 
eyes behold and that our thoughts can conceive &#59; there is a 
God &#33; the angels exclaim&#44; who is far removed beyond the ken 
of the purest&#44; and greatest&#44; and wisest of all existing beings &#59; 
there is a God &#33; the saints respond&#44; who is blessed beyond all 
conception&#44; who is good beyond the reach of the imagination. 
If we but cast our eye upward to the starry firmament&#44; and 
behold the myriads of suns sending down their beaming light 
upon us &#59; when we see the quiet moon winging its circuit round 
our planet&#44; when we regard the bright light of the glorious 
sun&#44; which refreshes and quickens all here below : we must 
acknowledge that one&#44; great&#44; and mighty Architect made them 
all&#44; and appointed to each and all the courses they are to pur&#8211; 
sue&#44; till their task is ended&#44; till their end has come &#59; when they&#44; 
the great monuments of God&#39;s wisdom&#44; too&#44; may pass away &#59; 
and thus show&#44; that He alone endures for ever. &#8212; Go abroad from 
your dwellings&#44; and gaze on the fields clad in the spring&#8211;time 
with the mantle of green &#59; see the trees putting on their leafy 
garment &#59; and see in summer the golden fruit ripen in the 
wide&#8211;spread plain &#59; and in autumn the clustering grapes sus&#8211; 
pended from the vine &#59; and in winter the dazzling snow shroud&#8211;

ing the face of the land to render again fruitful the exhausted 
soil : and then say&#44; whether or not there is one wise Creator 
that organized all so beautifully and for so benign a purpose. 
And look upon the streamlets&#44; how they bubble forth from the 
flinty rock or the marshy fen&#44; how the)&#39; swell and unite into a 
mighty stream&#44; till the heaving ocean receives the lengthened 
and majestic river &#59; and that highway of nations itself&#44; the salty 
and unfathomable deep which surrounds the earth &#8212; and gain&#8211; 
say&#44; if you can&#44; that our Father above breaks the rock with his 
potent might and bids the waters flow&#44; and gathers the streams&#44; 
bears onward the waves&#44; and piles as it were in the hollow of 
his hand the restless&#44; swelling ocean&#39;s flood&#44; and sets to it a 
limit&#44; saying : &#34; Thus far only shalt thou come &#33;&#34; &#8212; And who is 
it&#44; mortal proud&#44; who causes the invisible wind to blow &#59; 
who is it that bringeth up clouds from the ends of the earth : 
at whose bidding does the thunder roll&#44; and at whose command 
does the lightning flash &#59; at whose nod does the earth&#8211;globe 
tremble&#63; unless it be our almighty God&#63; &#8212; and say&#44; who pro&#8211; 
videth food for thee &#59; who is so bountiful to all that has life &#59; 
who so kindly sustains all&#44; if it is not He who formed all that 
exists &#63; &#8212; And reflect upon thyself&#44; and contemplate the won&#8211; 
derful construction of the animal frame&#44; gifted with strength 
and beauty &#59; and thy sentient soul&#44; she&#44; that feels&#44; and thinks&#44; 
and plans&#44; and resolves&#44; and longs for happiness &#59; and then 
answer&#44; if not an all&#8211; wise Power has organized thee and all else 
around thee &#33; &#8212; And thus it is&#44; whether we engage in the study 
of the heavenly spheres&#59; the earth on which we live&#59; the 
beasts of the field&#44; the fowls of heaven&#44; and the fishes of the 
sea &#59; or if we&#44; leaving all outward nature&#44; revert to ourselves : 
we will ever arrive at the point to which all contemplation 
must at length lead &#8212; the existence of a Creator&#44; the Cause 
of causes&#44; the Power of powers&#33; &#8212; And where is that gloomj&#8211; 
fanatic&#44; that lost son of humanity&#44; who&#44; because he cannot con&#8211; 
ceive what is God&#44; doubts his existence &#63; How miserable 
must he be&#44; to find himself in this world surrounded by dangers&#44; 
encircled by misfortunes&#44; which he himself cannot remove&#44; 
and which he believes there is no being capable of removing. 
And let him pursue his own reflections&#44; does he at length not 
come to a proposition which is in effect an acknowledgment of

a Creator&#44; though he does wish to confess it in so many words&#63; 
Ask him&#44; what he considers the origin of things to be&#59; and he 
must say&#44; to solve the mystery of existence&#44; that there existed 
matter&#44; and that through an arrangement which he cannot ex&#8211; 
plain &#40;mind brethren&#44; the atheist is not in the least nearer to 
knowledge because of his reckless denial) things were so 
ordered&#44; fortuitously of course&#44; as we find them &#59; but is it not 
evident to every one&#44; except to the wilfully blind&#44; that this 
fortuitous Arranger&#44; but which in effect must be an intelligent 
mind&#44; is actually a God&#44; a Creator&#44; and&#44; what follows of itself&#44; 
a Preserver&#63; The truth is&#44; there is nothing more absurd than 
the denial of a Creator&#44; for there is no conceivable theory 
of explaining the existence of any organization without Him. 
And as said&#44; though we confess&#44; that we know not what God 
is&#44; how He exists&#44; when his existence began: still we have a 
starting&#8211;point upon which to rest our system&#59; we adore Him&#44; 
who is inconceivable&#44; we submit to him&#44; who is removed from 
our research&#44; and in our affliction we call upon Him&#44; who&#44; 
having made all according to his will&#44; can order things&#44; can 
arrange his creation as may be pleasing to Him&#44; at all times&#44; at 
all seasons&#44; and under all circumstances. And he who denies 
this&#44; is he any wiser than we &#63; Are his ideas of his own origin 
anj&#39;&#8211; more satisfactory &#63; Is his system&#44; to use the cant phrase&#44; 
a phrase much abused by the ignorant or would&#8211;be&#8211;wise&#44; is his 
system&#44; I meant to say more philosophical&#44; or does it not 
lead&#44; as briefly exhibited already&#44; to the most monstrous 
absurdities and contradiction &#63; &#8212; No brethren&#44; atheism is un&#8211; 
reasonable&#59; and there is no reason whatever for a thinking man 
to adopt the horrible system of absurdities which it must pro&#8211; 
duce. I will not now enter upon the practical evils of social 
disorganization which must follow in its train&#59; since my present 
object is merely to show its folly and unsoundness&#44; and to ex&#8211; 
hibit briefly the beauty and consistency of the first tenet of our 
holy law&#44; which demands : &#34; There is a God.&#34; 

This God&#44; who is so infinite&#44; so immeasurably great&#44; has 
thought fit at different times to reveal himself to certain persons 
of both sexes&#44; and of various nations&#44; to make known through 
them the doctrines and laws&#44; by which He wished mankind 
should be governed&#44; without however depriving any one of the

free will to adopt or reject these precepts&#59; or to express myself 
more distinctly&#44; laws were given by obeying which we should 
be acting according to the will of our Maker&#44; and by doing so 
deserve his favour&#44; but whilst the way was pointed out to us&#44; 
no actual compulsion was laid upon our inclinations&#59; for though 
instructed&#44; we can&#44; if our wayward fancy should incline us&#44; 
act in such a manner as though no law had been given&#44; and 
conduct ourselves contrary to&#44; and in defiance of&#44; the will of 
God. &#8212; It is not necessarj&#39; at this moment to prove the reason&#8211; 
ableness of this principle&#44; since I have so often before to&#8211;day 
called your attention to the subject&#44; and I trust the little I have 
advanced has been more than enough to remove doubts&#44; at 
least so far as to answer objections. To me indeed it appears 
superfluous to argue the subject&#59; for God&#39;s ability to communi&#8211; 
cate his will&#44; if He is so disposed&#44; cannot be doubted&#59; and 
He who provides for the wants of the animalcules&#44; a million 
of which will barely cover the end of this finger&#44; could&#44; 
and must have given to man&#44; the crown of his creation&#44; a 
guide to his mind&#44; a prop to his soul which should be a 
shield against evil and a guardian that should point out&#44; and 
lead on to everlasting happiness. &#8212; A few words at this time 
only will I add with reference to the record of the divine 
revelation which we now possess&#44; and which as you well 
know&#44; it is our duty to obey. In the first place a great 
injury is done to religion by the ignorant looking upon it as the 
work of Moses. But how often must it be repeated&#44; that Mo&#8211; 
ses was not the author of a single enactment&#44; but that he acted 
merely as the messenger whom the Israelites themselves had 
selected to communicate to them whatever God might reveal to 
him for their guidance&#63; If it were indeed that the Mosaic law 
had no better foundation than human ingenuity&#44; then for a cer&#8211; 
tainty&#39; it would be unreasonable to demand implicit obedience 
to its tenets&#44; any more than to the works of Solon&#44; of Confu&#8211; 
cius&#44; of Matthew&#44; or of Paul. But if we look upon it accord&#8211; 
ing to its real merits&#44; if we behold in it the workings and the 
immediate inspiration of the Deity: then indeed the case is en&#8211; 
tirely altered&#44; and the enactments it contains in this case de&#8211; 
mand&#44; not alone our attention&#44; but an entire and confiding obe&#8211; 
dience. And do not the various statutes&#44; independently of

every other consideration&#44; deserve&#44; from their extreme utility&#44; 
all that the advocates of their sanctity ask for them &#63; What 
law does so well secure the liberty of the citizen&#44; the adminis&#8211; 
tration of justice&#44; the righting of the oppressed&#44; or watches with 
so much solicitude over the security of the helpless female&#44; the 
bereaved orphan&#44; the unprotected stranger &#8212; even the slave&#44; 
who&#44; to escape from his tyrant&#39;s oppression&#44; comes to seek the 
protection and security of the divine code&#63; Come&#44; and let us 
take a few of the laws&#59; for instance: &#34; Remember the Sabbath 
to keep it holy&#59;&#34; doubtlessly&#44; he who luxuriously&#44; in the arms 
of riches&#44; in the possession of plenty&#44; idles away his whole life&#44; 
may not feel the force&#44; the benignity&#44; the extreme wisdom&#44; let 
me add&#44; of the commandment&#59; but go amongst the multitude&#44; 
who&#44; true to the curse pronounced against the sinning progeni&#8211; 
tor of our race&#44; &#34;earn their bread by the sweat of their brow&#44;&#34; 
go and see how gladly they celebrate the weekly Sabbath&#59; how 
joyfully they welcome the heavenly bride&#59; go and see them at 
their holyday repast&#44; with how much religious zest the viands 
of the body even are enjoyed&#44; because it is the Lord&#39;s holy 
and blessed day: and then say&#44; if you can&#44; whether such a 
spread of hilarity among so many intelligent creatures&#44; who&#44; 
though poor&#44; are as much entitled to repose and enjoyment as 
the irresponsible autocrat of a mighty kingdom&#44; is not a work 
for the ordination of which the loving Father of his creatures 
might not employ himself&#44; consonantly with his dignity and 
wisdom &#63; In short&#44; all who labour&#44; be they farmers&#44; mechanics&#44; 
teachers&#44; servants&#44; judges&#44; or scholars&#44; all must equally be re&#8211; 
joiced when weekly their toils are suspended&#44; when they are 
left to acquire new strength for renewed exertion. &#8212; &#34; Honour 
thy father and mother&#34; is another precept&#59; this too may not be 
palatable to the idle and vicious offspring&#44; who&#44; when their 
father grows old&#44; when their mother becomes helpless&#44; may 
think that the aged ones have lived long enough&#44; and may even 
think it a mercy to terminate by one blow the sufferings of de&#8211; 
crepid old age. But were the parents to think so&#44; and cast off 
the puling&#44; helpless&#44; almost unconscious&#44; tender nurseling&#44; where 
would these same vain&#44; arrogant ones be&#63; what but a mother&#39;s 
care watched over the infant&#44; called forth its nascent intelligence 
by maternal endearment&#44; hung with hope and fear over the

couch of early suffering&#63; who but a father would toil from 
early dawn till the hour of eve&#44; under the rays of the scorch&#8211; 
ing sun&#44; amidst the war of elements&#44; in the piercing blast of a 
winter&#39;s storm&#44; to provide bread for the infants whom it is his 
joy to call his own offspring&#44; the children of his beloved wife&#63; 
And these are the beings whom unbelief would forsake&#44; when 
they in turn become helpless&#44; when they are helpless perhaps 
through fatigue endured&#44; through expenses incurred for those 
ingrates who now anxiously hope for their dissolution&#33; &#8212; Again 
says the law: &#34; Thou shalt not commit adultery&#59;&#34; &#34;there shall 
be no incest among you.&#34; And how eloquently do these pre&#8211; 
cepts appeal to the feelings. Among heathen nations&#44; and 
even among the enlightened people of the present day&#44; the fe&#8211; 
male was or is yet looked upon as an instrument of pleasure&#59; 
and when once contaminated by the touch of vice&#44; she is cast 
abroad as something too unclean for the touch&#44; as one abandoned 
to merited opprobrium&#44; nay&#44; as one placed beyond the pale of 
compassion. And it is to protect the thoughtless and perhaps 
too confiding woman that these statutes were enacted&#59; to banish 
from the heart of society that portion which&#44; as an eloquent 
female writer observes&#44; is at once the victim and parent of vice&#59; 
and therefore we have so many details in the Pentateuch which 
are to regulate the judges of Israel in their decision in all cases 
of incest and immorality. This is the law in which we are to 
have faith&#44; and against which the voice of unbelief ought not to 
be raised&#59; and especially it is horrible to hear females uttering 
aught of disrespect against the holy tenets&#59; and to me it appears&#44; 
that although in man infidelity is unpardonable&#44; it appears 
doubly offensive and unnatural in woman&#44; whose very estima&#8211; 
tion&#44; and rank&#44; and welfare in society are chiefly based upon 
the benign code which we profess. Were I to follow my own 
inclination&#44; were I as eloquent as the subject deserves&#44; I would 
for hours descant upon the theme&#44; and not leave it till all had 
acknowledged themselves convinced&#59; but my tongue is feeble&#44; 
my mind insufficient to reach the end&#59; and you&#44; sons and 
daughters of Israel who hear me&#44; surely need not for my ad 
monition to exhort you to uphold that which your own hearts&#44; 
your own convictions&#44; must tell you&#44; is beyond price invalu&#8211; 
able. 

    <pb n="389"/>

90 THE JEWISH FAITH. 

We now come at length to the last fundamental principle of 
our religion&#44; which teaches: &#34; God will reward the righteous 
according to his righteousness&#44; and give to the wicked accord&#8211; 
ing to his wickedness.&#34; A very few words will suffice in 
explanation. God&#44; the Creator of all&#44; has made his will known 
to mankind for their government &#59; but as said already He gave 
them a free will to obey or not to obey. At the same time He 
declared&#44; that by obedience life would be obtained&#44; but the 
consequence of disobedience should be death. Now&#44; as the 
conditions are known&#44; and as God is all&#8211;powerful&#44; it follows 
that obedience or righteonsness will meet with reward or life &#59; 
disobedience or wickedness with punishment or death. And 
as the Creator&#39;s power is not limited by time or space&#44; reward 
or punishment will be the certain consequence of our conduct&#44; 
either in this life&#44; or after death when we shall have entered a 
new state of existence. And thus says David : &#34; Whither shall 
I go from thy spirit&#44; and whither from thy face shall I fly&#63; If 
I ascend to heaven Thou art there&#44; and if I should lie down in 
the abyss&#44; I should find Thee.&#34; &#8212; These now are the feelings 
which we should cultivate to be sincerely religious &#59; we must 
believe in the existence of God&#44; in the promulgation of his law&#44; 
and in the certainty of reward and punishment. A faith like 
this&#44; in principles perfectly reasonable and clearly understood&#44; 
must step by step promote a holiness of heart&#44; a readiness to 
acquiesce in and to exercise the duties of religion. A faith 
like this may be properly termed&#44; a justifying faith&#44; because it 
preserves the mind pure and undefiled from the access of sin 
and corruption &#59; and if even sin should have already been com&#8211; 
mitted&#44; it will tend to clear away the impurities&#44; the dross of 
wickedness&#44; and produce a cleansing of the spirit and a rege&#8211; 
neration of the inward man&#44; and render him a just and worthy 
servant of the Lord. &#8212; As a consequence of being in possession 
of faith&#44; a man will be imbued with resignation to God&#39;s de&#8211; 
crees and a sincere belief&#44; that all that happens is from a good 
and wise purpose &#59; further&#44; it will cause a filial reliance upon 
God&#39;s promises&#44; and prevent the righteous from ever despairing&#44; 
although he see not the fruits he might hope for from his well&#8211; 
directed conscientious exertions. &#8212; Such a faith it was which 
animated our glorious ancestor Abraham. He stood forth

amidst the heathens&#44; a shining light amidst the darkness&#44; and 
proclaimed the unity and eternity of the Creator of all. Abra&#8211; 
ham had been promised that in him all families of the earth 
should be blessed&#44; and that he should be the progenitor of a 
numerous nation. Time had passed on&#44; and the Patriarch had 
reached perhaps his eighty&#8211;fifth year&#44; and still he was childless. 
But now he was assured&#44; that despite of unfavourable appear&#8211; 
ances the promise of a numerous progeny should eventually be 
fulfilled. And says the text: &#34; And He led him out abroad&#44; 
and said. Look up I pray thee&#44; and count the stars if thou canst 
count them &#59; and He said to him. Thus shall be thy descend&#8211; 
ants.&#34; And continues the sacred writer : 

: &#39;1 &#39;ID &#39;Nn3 : npi)i )h n:3£rnn &#39;nn pDN&#42;ni 

&#34;And he believed in the Lord&#44; and He reckoned it to him as righteous&#8211; 
ness.&#34; Gen. XV. 6. 

Abraham thus&#44; as we see&#44; believed firmly&#44; confidingly in God 
and his promises&#59;&#44; undismayed by the improbability of the fulfil&#8211; 
ment&#44; and we have it here recorded that this faith was reckoned 
as an exertion of righteousness &#59; and this shows us&#44; that thoughts 
as well as actions are meritorious in the sight of the Searcher of 
hearts. &#8212; And the promise so solemnly given and so truly be&#8211; 
lieved has been fulfilled&#44; and we are here this day the witnesses 
of the truth of prophecy and of the unwavering righteousness 
of God &#59; for we are the children of Abraham&#44; the fulfilment of 
a long cherished promise. And should we waver&#63; should we 
hesitate&#63; should we doubt&#63; No&#44; let it be our constant endea&#8211; 
vour to fortify ourselves in faith&#44; and to increase in righteous&#8211; 
ness&#44; and let it never be laid to our charge that we have basely 
dishonoured the name of Abraham&#44; the friend and adorer of 
God &#33; 

May we all live in righteousness and holiness&#44; and may the 
workings of faith&#44; proved by deeds of devotion to God&#39;s holy 
law&#44; cause our prayers to be acceptable before the throne of 
Him&#44; who lives for ever and whose glory filleth all the uni&#8211; 
verse &#33; Amen.

MYSTERIOUS and omnipotent Being&#44; who art so far exalted 
and removed beyond our mortal research&#44; fill our hearts with 
meekness and devotion&#44; that we may implicitly resign ourselves 
to tiiy guidance&#44; and submit with patience to thy all&#8211;wise dis&#8211; 
pensations. And our Father &#33; if Thou sendest sufferings to 
our hearts&#44; if Thou leadest us through the valley of the shadow 
of death&#44; because of our transgressions : do Thou lead us&#44; do 
Thou support us with the right hand of thy salvation&#44; and guide 
us safe and unscathed&#44; and cause our faith in thy goodness to 
remain undiminished &#59; and let us be instructed by thyself&#44; that 
the pains which thou dispensest are sent to cement the stronger 
the ties&#44; by which Thou drawest thy children closer unto thy&#8211; 
self&#59; and that it is by tribulations only that our sins are washed 
away&#44; and we are rendered again pure and unspotted&#44; and worthy 
of thy unending grace and favour. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 
Often indeed it happens that we humble&#44; uninstructed&#44; and 
short&#8211;sighted mortals presume to call in question the decrees of 
the Deity&#44; and as it were the creature arraigns&#44; and sits in 
judgment over&#44; the all&#8211;wise and blessed Creator&#44; Vain pre&#8211; 
sumption&#33; sinful audacity&#33; how can we&#44; the worms of the earth&#44; 
whose being is limited to the shortest span&#44; whose mind is in&#8211; 
carcerated within a mortal habiliment&#44; whose ideas are weaken&#8211; 
ed&#44; whose perception is blunted by sorrow&#44; by sickness&#44; by 
pains&#44; by passions &#8212; how can we &#8212; how dare we &#8212; mistrust the 
wisdom&#44; the goodness&#44; the infallibility of Him&#44; who is &#34; old 
of days&#44;&#34; whose mind is unsearchable&#44; to whom every thing 
is known&#44; to whom all existing things are as naught&#44; who is 
never disturbed&#44; never influenced&#44; by sorrow or by suffering&#44; 
by passion or by ignorance &#63; who when He judges&#44; judges with

mercy&#63; who when He punishes&#44; sendeth the balsam before the 
wound is struck&#63; &#8212; And what are to Him the earth and all that 
fills it&#44; the sea and the mighty monsters of the deep&#44; the birds 
that seek the expanse of firmament&#44; &#8212; when all that is in being 
is derived from Him alone&#44; &#8212; when all that breatheth is to Him 
accountable&#63; &#8212; And still&#44; despite of the immeasurable difference 
which divides us ffom Him&#44; our God&#44; we are yet weak enough&#44; 
vain enough&#44; presumptuous enough to judge Him by the weak&#44; 
imperfect standard of our intellect &#33; And in reading the records 
of revelation we are very often led away by our ignorance to im&#8211; 
pugn the justice of God in his actions towards men&#44; as though 
He could view things with human feelings&#33; It must strike you 
as self&#8211;evident from the very nature of things&#44; that such a mode 
of reasoning&#44; which would apply to God&#39;s actions the standard 
of humanity&#44; must be erroneous&#44; and lead to pernicious con&#8211; 
clusions&#44; in as far as it would weaken our attachment to the 
doctrines of the Bible&#44; and render us lukewarm in the execu&#8211; 
tion of its precepts. It is&#44; therefore&#44; necessary&#44; that our studies 
and our researches&#44; as well as our conduct&#44; should be characterised 
by a deep humility and by a sincere single&#8211;heartedness&#44; which 
should induce us to approach the word of God with fearfulness 
and with a weak reliance upon our own wisdom&#44; and with a 
perfect consciousness&#44; that the divine Author of our legislation 
could not err in his decrees any more&#44; than in the line of con&#8211; 
duct He chose to pursue to our ancestors and to the nations 
whose history is interwoven with our own. If we approach 
the investigation of the Scriptures in this spirit&#44; we shall hesi&#8211; 
tate in our judgment upon points which at first sight might 
appear unreasonable &#59; and we will&#44; as a necessary consequence 
of our perfect reliance upon the truth of what is written down 
in the holy Text&#44; shape our conduct in strict conformity to its 
behests&#44; as by so doing we follow the persuasions of unwavering&#44; 
uncorrupted&#44; and unchanging truth. But should we on the other 
hand approach to the investigation of the Bible&#8211;text with a de&#8211; 
termination to use our own wisdom as a sure and safe guide&#44; and 
set to work to accommodate the events of history to our views of 
right and wrong&#44; add to which&#44; that our understanding of the text 
may at the same time be in some degree defective and our ac&#8211; 
quaintance with history and the operations of the human heart

deficient: it is absolutely necessary&#44; that we will end by cavilling 
at the justice of God&#44; and as a natural consequence&#44; our vene&#8211; 
ration for the words and precepts of Scripture will become 
weakened &#59; and this again will lead to unbelief&#44; and unbelief to 
irreligion and immorality&#44; and these again to the loss of happi&#8211; 
ness which is so abundantly to be found in the practice of the 
commands of the holy law. &#8212; Humility&#44; however&#44; in an inves&#8211; 
tigation so important&#44; not alone to ourselves&#44; as individuals&#44; 
but to all in any degree connected with us&#44; will teach us&#44; even 
if the subject matter is capable of no explanation whatever&#44; that 
we must submit&#44; where there is no means of arriving at know&#8211; 
ledge&#44; and that the Almighty is as incapable of injustice&#44; as his 
wisdom is incapable of error. Besides&#44; it must be considered&#44; 
that if to&#8211;day&#44; with the information in our power&#44; any thing 
or event is inexplicable to us&#44; the case may be altogether difier&#8211; 
ent to&#8211;morrow&#44; if our sphere of knowledge be then more ex&#8211; 
tended. So far&#44; therefore&#44; is an acquiescence in religious truths 
an evidence of credulity and ignorance&#44; that it may be viewed 
as proof of a purer than worldly wisdom &#59; since it may be based 
upon a knowledge of our capacity of arriving daily and hourly 
at more information&#44; and the assurance that after a long life 
spent in the pursuit of knowledge&#44; there is an immense field 
yet unexplored. And thus it happened with one of the most 
remarkable men in a preceding age&#44; whose discoveries in phi&#8211; 
losophy have opened a new career to subsequent discoverers&#44; 
and whose virtue was equal to his learning. At the close of a 
long life&#44; when he might be supposed to have done as much as 
lay in human power&#44; he is said to have spoken of his own 
attainments : &#34; I am but like one who has been picking up 
shells on the borders of the great ocean of truth.&#34; This good 
man&#44; whose candid confession thus feelingly spoken may well 
tend to strike with shame the presumptuous scoffer and the 
vain glorious egotist&#44; was not one of our brethren &#59; yet we 
inust respect virtue wherever we find it&#44; and wherever we see 
the stamp of the similitude to our heavenly Father impressed 
on a man&#44; there too should our esteem and our love be directed. 
But I am leaving the subject I intended presenting to your 
reflection to&#8211;day&#59; and not to exhaust your patience&#44; I find it 
necessary to curb the indignant feelings which ever rise within

me when I hear&#44; or fancy I hear&#44; the wisdom&#44; the righteous&#8211; 
ness&#44; or the goodness of God called into question&#44; be this pro&#8211; 
ceeding from ignorance&#44; from unbelief&#44; or from wickedness &#59; 
since I conceive either motive extremely prejudicial to&#44; if not 
altogether subversive of&#44; true piety.&#8212; Of all objections raised 
against the authenticity of the Mosaic records&#44; none have af&#8211; 
forded more fruitful themes of declamation to infidels or those 
who blindly follow their silly outpourings&#44; than the conduct of 
the Deity with regard to the tyrannical king of Egypt&#44; who 
oppressed so cruelly our ancestors for many years&#44; keeping 
them under the most horrid slavery&#44; and dooming the name of 
Jacob to extermination by slaying every male child as soon as 
it entered the world. Let us&#44; therefore&#44; calmly investigate the 
text&#44; and see whether it contains aught disconsonant with the 
rule of everlasting justice. We read in Exodus x. 1&#8211;2 : 

&#34; And the Lord said unto Moses : Go unto Pharoah &#59; for I have caused to 
be heavy his heart and the heart of his servants&#44; for the sake that I might do 
these my signs in the midst of them. And for the sake that thou mightest 
tell in the ears of thy son and of thy son&#39;s son that which I have wrought in 
Egypt&#44; and my signs which I have done in them &#59; and you shall know that . 
I am the Lord.&#34; 

As I have just said&#44; against this passage it is alleged&#44; that it 
is unbecoming in God to harden Pharaoh&#39;s heart&#44; and then 
punish him for disobedience. This I believe is the substance 
of the charge as far as I have ever understood it&#44; and stating it 
in this form 1 have given it&#44; I may safely aver&#44; its strongest 
bearing. I will not in refuting it overwhelm you with an ap&#8211; 
peal to the inscrutable wisdom of God&#44; to his unwavering 
justice&#44; although this would at once convince us that radically 
there can be nothing wrong in the passage &#59; for we may freely 
say&#44; that God knew better than we can know&#44; how far he was 
justifiable to proceed towards Pharoah without our even daring 

    <pb n="395"/>

to presume to impugn his justice. This indeed would be 
enough to the humble believer&#44; who always places the Lord 
before his eyes&#44; and whose heart is entire with his God. But 
there are many whose faith is not well founded&#44; who are vain&#8211; 
glorious&#44; wise in their own eyes&#44; who call perhaps&#44; in their 
ignorance&#44; the light darkness&#44; and the darkness light &#59; and who 
still&#44; whilst always cavilling and fault finding&#44; consider them&#8211; 
selves as Israelites in deeds and in mind &#59; and for the sake of 
such&#44; if any there be among my hearers&#44; and for the sake of 
those who have no confidence in revelation&#44; we will endeavour 
briefly to give convincing ansAvers to their doubts and objec&#8211; 
tions. &#8212; It is a fact well authenticated&#44; perhaps by the experience 
of every human being&#44; that the habit of doing any thing lessens 
its importance in the eyes of him who does it. Be this habit 
one of virtue or of vice&#44; it matters not &#59; for by habit vice be&#8211; 
comes as necessary to man as the exercise of virtue. Ask the 
drunkard&#44; why he does not leave off resorting to the intoxi&#8211; 
cating draught&#59; the gambler&#44; why he does not shun the gaming 
table &#59; the debauchee&#44; why he forsakes not the haunts of the 
ungodly&#59; the man of quarrel and of violence&#44; why he consti&#8211; 
tutes himself the bane and curse of his friends : and they will&#44; 
one and all&#44; tell you that habit has made sin so necessary to them&#44; 
that it is in vain they strive against it. This&#44; it is true&#44; is not 
the case&#44; because any habit can be corrected &#59; still it elucidates 
the difficulty under which sin places her votary&#44; and it proves 
the greatness of the tyranny which the spirit of ungodliness 
exercises over his devoted slaves. If now&#44; as in course He must&#44; 
the Almighty visits the sinner with retribution&#44; one warning 
will seldom effect any good &#59; the heart loves its perverseness&#44; 
and it may not&#44; nay it will not&#44; distinguish the hand&#8211;writing on 
the wall as it were&#44; which terrified amidst his unholy revels 
the wicked Babylonian monarch. It is not&#44; believe me&#44; Bel&#8211; 
shazzar alone that revels till the clutch of death is on his throat&#59; 
would to God it were so &#33; but alas&#44; millions there are who 
sport in sin&#44; weening the evil day will never come&#44; and they 
fancy themselves placed beyond the reach of retribution. Their 
power is great&#44; their riches are extensive&#44; their fair fame stands 
unimpeached in the eyes of the world&#44; they are beloved by 
their kindred&#44; their health is robust&#44; and their age is yet of the

spring of life&#44; what have they to fear &#63; let others tremble who 
are less favoured&#59; let those worship who are needy &#59; let those 
practise abstinence who cannot help themselves&#59; let those 
court popularity by benevolence and good deeds who are not 
popular already: what indeed have they&#44; the great and favoured&#44; 
to look for or to fear &#63; Let now as said a small warning be 
sent to them&#59; let them. for instance&#44; be thrown on the couch of 
sickness&#59; do you believe that they will repent of their errors&#63; 
or rather will they not regard disease as inherent to man&#44; as a 
thing not worth noticing &#63; Or let the Almighty send his angel 
ofdeathinthe midst of their dwelling&#44; let him strike down 
the stem from which they have sprung&#59; let him pluck away 
the tender shoot which is to transmit their name to after&#8211;ages&#59; 
let him take away the partners of their earthly journey&#44; whom 
God has assigned them as their associates on life&#39;s weary pil&#8211; 
grimage: will they repent&#63; no&#59; death&#44; they will say&#44; is 
humanity&#39;s lot&#44; and the warning of God is forgotten. &#8212; Let us 
apply these facts to the case of Pharaoh. The Egyptians in a 
former age had received with becoming hospitality the father 
and brothers of their great benefactor Joseph&#44; who had saved 
the country from a desolating famine through his Heaven&#8211;inspired 
wisdom. Another generation succeeding had overlooked what 
Joseph had done &#59; and as the Israelites had in the meantime 
grown numerous and powerful&#44; so that the land had become full 
of them&#44; they inspired with unfounded fear the nation among 
whom they dwelt. The Israelites had a woi&#39;ship difi&#39;ering from the 
Egyptians&#44; and the worshippers oi Jidonal Shadai&#44; the Lord Al&#8211; 
mighty&#44; found no sympathy with the followers of the personified 
sun and moon&#44; the idols Osiris and Isis. Fear begat jealousy&#44; and 
by degrees slavery was decreed the doom of the hated race&#44; and the 
Israelites were compelled to &#34; build treasury&#8211;towns for Pharaoh&#44; 
even Peetom and Rangmesses. And they embittered their lives 
with hard labour&#44; in clay and in bricks and in all manner of work 
in the field&#44; and in their work&#44; in which they made them work 
slavishly.&#34; And as if to add insult to injury&#44; the people who were 
oppressed were soon viewed as inferiors&#44; and Jacob&#39;s blood was 
looked upon as contaminating to the children of Ham. Yet the 
increase of the enslaved people was not checked&#44; and &#34; the 
more they were oppressed the more they multiplied&#44; the more

they spread out.&#34; And now murder was to be added &#59; first 
Hebrew women were ordered to be the executioners of a 
tyrant&#39;s will &#59; but the noble courage of female heroism dis&#8211; 
dained to purchase kingly favour at the expense of the wrath 
of God. And when he found himself foiled&#44; and his mandates 
laughed to scorn&#44; he commanded truer executioners to do his 
work&#44; and every Egyptian was empowered to throw every 
Hebrew boy&#44; as soon as born&#44; into the Nile. Does not such con&#8211; 
duct deserve punishment &#63; Should the people go unrewarded 
with condign visitation who so faithfully seconded an ungodly 
and murderous mandate&#63; &#8212; And when even our Moses was 
saved only through an overruling Providence&#44; when the child 
of the chief of his tribe was not safe within the mother&#39;s fond 
embrace &#59; where&#44; I ask you&#44; could there be safety &#63; And even 
after the death of this oppressor&#44; the burden of the Israelites 
was not much if any diminished &#59; and when at length Moses 
had reached his eightieth year&#44; the merciful One determined 
that now the cup of misery of his people was full &#59; and that 
the moment had arrived when they should be led forth from 
bondage &#59; and that the probation by which they should be edu&#8211; 
cated in the fear and the knowledge of the Lord had been com&#8211; 
pletely endured. Moses was therefore despatched to Egypt&#39;s 
king in the name of the eternal Lord&#44; the God of Israel&#44; to 
demand the release of the captives. The idolater knew not the 
Deity in whose name the prophet spoke&#44; his priests&#44; his conju&#8211; 
rors&#44; his deceivers had not taught him to fear the unseen&#44; the 
incomprehensible&#44; the not&#8211;to&#8211;be&#8211;figured God &#59; and is it likely 
that he should obey a mandate of so monstrous a nature without 
som.e striking&#44; some convincing&#44; proof&#63; A proof of Moses&#39;s 
truth he demanded. Aaron&#44; by his brother&#39;s command&#44; threw 
down his staff&#44; and it became a serpent&#59; but then the magicians 
pretended to do the like by their mysterious arts&#44; &#34;and Pha&#8211; 
raoh&#39;s heart was hard &#40;or strong)&#44;&#34; to use the Bible&#8211;phrase&#44; &#34; and 
he did not hear to them&#44; as the Lord had spoken&#44;&#34; when He 
said : &#34;And I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go&#44; 
and not even with a strong hand &#59; and I will stretch out my 
hand&#44; and I will smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will 
do in the midst thereof&#44; and after that he will dismiss you.&#34; 
Here then we have the plan of God at once displayed. Moses

was to be sent with the demand for the liberation of the cap&#8211; 
tives &#59; but God&#44; knowing the heart of man&#44; told Moses for his 
guidance&#44; and to inspire him with confidence&#44; that upon his 
first demand&#44; upon the first punishments even&#44; nothing but con&#8211; 
tumely was to be looked for &#59; and thus speaks the verse : &#34; And 
I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go&#44; and not 
even with a strong hand.&#34; This assurance was truly necessary 
to be given&#44; for even the messenger himself&#44; true to human 
weakness&#44; despaired of success&#44; when his first attempt to benefit 
his brethren brought down upon them increased oppression and 
hardship. &#8212; And when Moses spoke of retribution he said : 
&#34; That the first&#8211;born should be slain as a consequence of non&#8211; 
compliance by Pharaoh.&#34; Whilst therefore the death of these 
had not taken place&#44; the prophet would have been looked upon 
as a deceiver &#59; it was therefore so ordained&#44; if we take the 
words &#34; hardening of heart&#34; as they are commonly understood&#44; 
that Pharaoh should not finally relent till the prediction had 
been fulfilled. &#8212; Another motive for this conduct of God is given 
in the text I have taken : &#34; That I might do these ray wonders 
in the midst of them &#59; and for the sake that thou &#40;the Israelites) 
mightest tell what I have done in Egypt &#8212; and you shall know 
that I am the Lord&#44;&#34; &#8212; that is to say&#44; that He the Lord is all&#8211; 
powerful and irresistible&#44; and that his will is to be obeyed&#44; no 
matter if a man were ten times to oppose himself to the warn&#8211; 
ings siven him&#44; if ten times he were to resist the evidence of 
punishment&#44; that his conduct is hateful in the sight of Heaven. 
And can any one say&#44; that Pharaoh and his people did not de&#8211; 
serve the punishments&#44; the more so&#44; as they did last but a short 
time&#63; But despite of the brevity of their duration&#44; they were 
eminently calculated to strike terror from the severity of their 
effects&#44; and to fill the heart with admiration of God&#39;s power 
from the suddenness and awful ness and wonderfulness with 
which they were sent. There is every reason to believe that the 
Israelites also had&#44; in the lapse of time&#44; become greatly like their 
masters&#44; addicted to idolatry&#44; and that the pure worship&#44; which 
Abraham had proclaimed&#44; had by degrees faded also from their 
memory. What better method could God now employ to re&#8211; 
instruct them of his greatness and power&#44; than by punishing 
signally&#44; and in different manners&#44; those that ruled over them 

    <pb n="399"/>

with oppressive sway&#63; What could better confirm in their 
minds that it was the Creator of all who had come to redeem 
them&#44; when they with their own eyes beheld the order of nature 
subverted&#63; and must not in this way ignorance itself have been 
taught to acknowledge that no one&#44; but He who made all&#44; could 
work those miracles which Moses was the agent to perform&#63; 
That the lesson was effectually and indelibly inculcated&#44; no one 
can deny&#59; for even to this day we tell to our children of the 
signs which the Lord has done in Egypt&#59; and we ourselves 
know&#44; and other nations will be brought to know&#44; that He is 
the Lord&#44; whose being is without end&#44; and whose power is 
without limit. And all this was effected by punishing those 
meriting punishment&#44; and by delaying a few days only the re&#8211; 
demption which no earthly power was able to retard beyond a 
brief space&#59; for Pharaoh himself at last said: &#34;Go you out 
from the midst of my people.&#34; 

The foregoing explanation is founded upon the assumption 
that the words &#34; I will harden Pharaoh&#39;s heart&#34; mean to express 
an active interference of the Deity to prevent him from doing 
what was asked of him. And we have seen that even then 
there is no cause whatever for any reasoning man to complain 
of the justice of God. In acquiescing in the usual version of 
the words &#39; I did so 
merely&#44; because I do not wish to be looked upon as though I 
were anxious to strike out a path of my own in commenting on 
the Bible&#44; Nevertheless it appears to me that the phrases I have 
quoted: &#34; I will strengthen his heart&#44;&#34; and &#34;I will make hard 
the heart of Pharaoh&#44;&#34; mean nothing more than that the Al&#8211; 
mighty would allow Pharaoh to act according to his natural 
inclination&#44; consonantly with his ignorance of the eternal Lord&#39;s 
power&#44; and in conformity with his long course of sinning and 
tyranny And let it be observed&#44; that it would have sounded 
incredible&#44; were the Mosaic record to have told that the king of 
Egypt had dismissed half a million and more of able&#8211;bodied 
workmen&#44; who built his cities&#44; his palaces&#44; and his canals&#44; by 
the command of an outcast and a refugee from justice&#44; like 
Moses confessedly was&#44; or after an unusual occurrence or two&#44; 
even if there had been a flow of blood in the river&#44; or a swarm 
of frogs&#44; of noxious insects&#44; of wild beasts&#44; and of locusts.

THE PUNISHMENT OF PHARAOH. 101 

Nay&#44; wc may add the plagues of a pestilence among cattle&#44; and 
blains upon the bodies of men. We will not refer to the other 
plagues&#44; because they were decidedly too terrific to be lost sight 
of&#44; or to be regarded as of trifling import: still&#44; when the hail 
had ceased&#44; and the three days&#39; gloom had been dispelled&#44; it may 
again be said that they were not of that stamp to make a proud 
despot waver&#44; who was considered among his people but little 
less than a god. We may therefore assume&#44; that the words: 
&#34;I will harden Pharaoh&#39;s heart&#44;&#34; are only intended to convey&#44; 
that God would not use any direct influence to bring about a 
change of heart or purpose in the king&#44; which we must assume 
Avould have been in his power&#44; as the Proverbs say: &#34;The 
heart of kings is like water in the hand of the Lord&#44; to whither&#8211; 
soever He willeth He turneth it&#59;&#34; so also the prophets: &#34;Assy&#8211; 
ria is the rod of my wrath&#59;&#34; &#34; Cyrus my servant.&#34; And God 
merely announced to Moses&#44; that nothing but intense conviction&#44; 
brought about by the force of circumstances&#44; should induce 
Pharaoh to relent&#44; just as is the case with an ordinary sinner&#44; 
who perseveres in his misconduct till destruction threatens him 
openly. Thus also answered Moses&#44; when Pharaoh&#44; during the 
plague of hail&#44; whilst thunder and lightning and icy stones ter&#8211; 
rified by their unusual violence a land in which storms are un&#8211; 
known&#44; said: &#34;The Lord is the righteous One&#44; and I and my 
people the sinners&#59;&#34; &#34;And thou and thy people&#44; I know&#44; that 
not yet you are afraid of the Lord God&#59;&#34; and immediately 
thereupon we read: &#34;And when Pharaoh saw that had ceased 
the rain and the hail and the thunder&#44; he repeated to sin&#44; and 
made heavy his heart&#44; himself and his servants.&#34; Let it at the 
same time be observed&#44; that in no one place is it said at the an&#8211; 
nouncement of a plague that the Lord would prevent Pharaoh 
from complying&#44; if he were so minded. It follows&#44; in conse&#8211; 
quence&#44; that Pharaoh could have averted the punishment&#44; like 
at a later period the people of Nineveh did&#44; who&#44; by command 
of their king&#44; returned in sincere repentance&#44; thinking: &#34;Who 
that knows himself guilty&#44; let him return&#59; then the Almighty

sacrifice to the Lord: till&#44; and only when&#44; the storm burst over 
his own heart&#44; and when his own son&#44; his first born&#44; who was to 
have sat on his throne&#44; perished before his father&#39;s eyes&#44; when 
every house was one of mourning&#44; when in every home there 
was a corpse&#44; when the land was filled with unheard&#8211;of lamen&#8211; 
tation. Then was no longer any resisting the evident power 
so strongly displayed&#44; and through the midst of his intense suffer&#8211; 
ings the order for the dismissal of the Israelites was given&#44; and 
they were fairly driven outof the land. If this view of thcsubject 
be the correct one&#44; which I conscientiously believe it to be&#44; it 
leaves no other difficulty to encounter&#44; than the prediction cited: 
&#34;And I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go.&#39;&#39; 
For some one might say: &#34;How could Pharaoh relent&#44; if God 
knew beforehand how he would act&#63;&#34; But this same question 
would be a conclusive argument against our possessing a free 
will in any thing&#44; for our not doing what God knows before&#8211; 
hand would be counteracting his omniscience. But here&#44; 
brethren&#44; our inquiry must stop &#59; we are fi&#39;ee agents&#44; and so 
was Pharaoh&#44; as well as all other sinners&#59; and how far to recon&#8211; 
cile this fact with the knowledge of God&#44; is not for us to inquire&#59; 
for this would be arrogating to ourselves wisdom and knowledge 
equal to the ever&#8211;blessed and exalted One. But at this point 
we should submit&#44; and never disturb ourselves with the perplex&#8211; 
ing reflection&#59; for no human research will ever be able to under&#8211; 
stand a question which there are no means of solving&#44; unless 
God himself should vouchsafe an especial revelation&#44; and ten&#8211; 
der us a greater share of knowledge of his ways than is yet in 
our possession. 

In the foregoing&#44; I have briefly endeavoured to answer an 
objection on which infidels so much rely. I approached it&#44; as 
I have done on other questions&#44; with no view of showing my 
skill as a disputant&#44; but solely as an humble vindicator of the 
pure word of God. &#8212; I trust&#44; that his spirit has guided me 
sufficiently to confirm your minds&#44; if not altogether to remove 
every doubt. One more worthy&#44; more learned&#44; and more able&#44; 
might doubtlessly have done the subject more justice &#59; but such 
as I am&#44; I sincerely hope&#44; that the arguments adduced and the 
illustrations given have proved to you &#40;at least they have done 
so to myself) : That &#34; the law of God is perfect&#44; it refreshes

the soul &#59; the judgments of the Lord are upright&#44; they are 
righteous together&#44;&#34; and that objections raised only tend to 
confirm the believer the stronger in his well&#8211;founded faith. 
Aye&#44; believing in the Lord&#39;s truth&#44; and confiding in his law&#44; 
are the balm of life&#44; the source of peace of mind on earth&#44; and 
of unending delight hereafter&#59; but to doubt of his rectitude&#44; to 
waver in our faith&#44; will lead to inevitable destruction. It is 
not blind faith&#44; a confidence in things or dogmas not under&#8211; 
stood&#44; that is demanded &#59; but a conviction that in God there is 
no fault&#44; and that whatever is inexplicable to us of his work&#8211; 
ings toward ourselves and others is ascribable&#44; not to Him&#44; but 
to our imperfect vision and to our circumscribed knowledge&#44; 
which cannot be removed till we have cast off the mortal coil&#44; 
which now encumbers our souls in this state of probation. And 
thus we read in the last verse of Hosea : &#34; Who is wise and 
marks it&#44; intelligent and knows it&#44; that faultless are the ways 
of the Lord&#44; and the righteous walk therein&#44; but the wicked 
stumble upon them.&#34; Let us then be the righteous&#44; whose 
meekness sees nothing but justice in the ways of God &#59; and let 
us shun the thoughts of the wicked&#44; who would dare to rise in 
judgment against Him who is Almighty in strength and All&#8211; 
powerful&#44; and whose wisdom is without measure &#33; 

Father I Thou spokest through thy prophet that Thou 
wouldst be a small sanctuary to us in our captivity. do Thou 
fulfil thy promise to us who pray for thy assistance in this 
house&#44; which thy children have consecrated to thy service&#33; 
Ten years&#44;&#42; we acknowledge it in humility and thankfulness&#44; 
have now elapsed since the doors of this house of prayer were 
first opened to admit the faithful to the footstool of thy glory 
which invisibly sits enthroned among us. let thy light spread 
from this spot unto the minds of thy children&#44; let them see the 
righteousness of thy ways&#44; and may for many years assemblies 
after assemblies of the faithful come here to worship Thee in 
truth and sincerity. And 0&#44; vouchsafe thy protection to this con&#8211; 
gregation&#44; and preserve them free from corroding care&#44; from

RECOMPENSE AND RETRIBUTION. 105 

Brethren &#33; 
Institutions&#44; human and divine&#44; have been devised to prevent 
the doing of evil&#44; commands upon commands have been pro&#8211; 
mulgated to admonish the world from the commission of wrong&#59; 
and yet we see the right&#44; the universally acknowledged right&#44; 
disregarded&#44; and the universally admitted wrong daily prac&#8211; 
tised. This fact is by no means flattering to our self&#8211;love&#44; nor 
is it without its baneful effects upon the spectators of the wrong 
that is done. The evil committed by the parent is an excuse 
for the child and the grandchild to go and do likewise&#44; and the 
way of death&#44; if trodden by the mother&#44; appears a path leading 
to endless pleasures to the thoughtless daughter. The pretext 
is that the child need not be better than the father&#44; as though 
the wrong committed by one could be beautified by its being 
farther propagated in a succeeding generation. And what can 
be more absurd than such reasoning&#44; if reasoning it can be 
called &#63; is one man to stammer because his father was heavy of 
speech&#63; is one to limp because his mother was lame&#63; is one 
brother to endeavour to become cross&#8211;eyed&#44; because the eldest 
of the family has unfortunately an obliquity of vision&#63; True&#44; 
the moralist has to acknowledge&#44; that the mania called fashion 
has at times made lisping seem a beauty in speaking&#44; and has 
imposed upon the multitude modes of dress and habits of life 
extremely pernicious to health or even to personal beauty which 
is endeavoured to be promoted. But is it reasonable that reli&#8211; 
gion and morality should accommodate themselves to deformity&#44; 
because deformity has become fashionable&#44; or because an exam&#8211; 
ple of this kind has been set by one high in authority&#44; renowned 
for wisdom&#44; or loved as an esteemed parent&#44; teacher&#44; or friend &#63; 
What has another&#39;s doing wrong to do with my own course of 
life&#63; am I less accountable&#44; because I have associates in sin&#63; 
is my turpitude less heinous&#44; because another is equally guilty 
with myself&#63; &#8212; All these questions need only to be stated to 
answer themselves&#44; and the cause of virtue&#44; of piety&#44; and of 
religion&#44; which are all the same thing&#44; obedience to God&#39;s law&#44; 
must be furthered by a proper investigation of the same. &#8212; 
Now it maybe asked: &#34;How is it that so much crime is constant&#8211; 
ly practised&#44; since the knowledge of the right is so universally 

    <pb n="405"/>

106 RECOMPENSE AND RETRIBUTION. 

spread abroad &#63;&#34; &#8212; To this it may be answered&#44; that the apparent 
impunity with which many commit crimes causes others to 
view sin as a thing not so much to be abhorred &#59; and looking 
only at the surface of things&#44; if an action is not very abhorrent&#44; 
it may be attempted&#44; and if it be once attempted&#44; the commis&#8211; 
sion of it&#44; and the satisfaction its contemplation in thoughts 
affords&#44; render it at length as something more desirable even 
than the opposite virtue. But the impunity with which sin is 
practised is more apparent than real &#59; for though the lightning of 
Heaven does not immediately consume the blasphemer&#59; for 
though the sudden pestilence does not annihilate instantly the 
Sabbath&#8211;breaker &#59; for though the earth does not open and swal&#8211; 
low up&#44; like in times of old the rebellious Korah&#44; those who 
violate the covenant of Abraham&#44; to whom God spoke : 
&#34;Walk before me and be perfect:&#34; still the sinners may rest 
assured that their sin is not forgotten&#44; and that not one action 
of theirs will go ultimately without its condign visitation. And 
then God&#44; our Father&#44; is a merciful Being&#44; who waits with long 
patience and paternal kindness to see whether the strayed 
one will not return to his embrace&#44; and throwing off his 
load of guilt&#44; exclaim in the sincerity of a renovated heart : 
&#34; Father&#44; thou who knowest the weakness of the human heart&#44; 
receive in kindness the returning&#44; repentant child.&#34; &#8212; But even 
grant&#44; that the sinner will never repent&#44; that year after year&#44; 
month after month&#44; week after week&#44; day after day&#44; nay&#44; hour 
afterhour&#44; he increases the amount of debt he incurs to God: yet 
we may rest assured&#44; that no length of time&#44; no distance of place&#44; 
and no change of circumstances will hide the malefactor from the 
all&#8211;seeing Eye&#44; whose search penetrates into all secrets&#44; into all 
space&#44; and into all time. And thus&#44; therefore&#44; if even no cloud 
whatever should darken the prosperity of the wicked one&#44; if no 
gnawing&#44; no compunction&#44; of a disturbed overcharged con&#8211; 
science should ever disturb his waking thoughts or his sleeping 
hours : still a life of earthly bliss may be followed by those 
awful torments&#44; pains and punishments to which the holy Scrip&#8211; 
tures allude&#44; but of which no particular description has been 
vouchsafed to us. And of this speaks Isaiah in the end of his 
prophecy : &#34; And they will go out and look at the corpses of 
the men&#44; who have acted wickedly towards me &#59; for their worm

shall not die&#44; nor their fire be quenched &#59; and they shall be an 
abomination to all flesh.&#34; It is true that many persons ridicule 
the idea of punishment after death &#59; hut their ridicule does in 
nowise remove the fact of its being so. And grant&#44; that the 
belief we entertain were not founded upon fact : at all events 
there cannot be any doubt of the possibility of a continuance to 
exist after this mortal body has been dissolved again into dust 
and ashes&#44; and of the likelihood&#44; that as there is an existence 
separate and distinct from earthly existence&#44; there may also be 
reward and punishment separate and distinct from earthly 
reward and punishment. &#8212; We must admit&#44; that the existence 
of a soul entirely severed from the body&#44; the existence of a 
spirit without the slightest attributes of matter&#44; is something 
very difficult of comprehension to us&#59; but on the other hand&#44; 
such a state of things is not by any means impossible&#44; even 
according to the views of a worldly philosophy &#59; and no one 
dares to deny at least this possibility&#44; till he has&#44; more than 
has been done hitherto&#44; found out the hidden properties of mat&#8211; 
ter &#8212; what are the vital fluids of inorganic nature&#44; such as heat&#44; 
light&#44; and electricity&#59; what is the ultimate consistency of mate&#8211; 
rial things&#59; and by what conformation&#44; unless it be a vital spark&#44; 
a part of the Deity from above&#44; man alone is enabled to use an 
articulate language at will&#44; and make thousands of changes in 
a few elementary sounds&#44; till he has elicited the innumerable 
variety of words and of syllables which constitute the languages 
of mankind &#59; by what means&#44; unless it be by a thinking soul&#44; a 
spirit apart from matter&#44; he can overcome almost every obstacle&#44; 
which inert matter or brute force oppose to his progress. I 
could multiply these unanswerable arguments a thousand&#8211;fold &#59; 
I might instance all the improvements in the arts and sciences&#44; 
the progress in civilization&#44; which late years have witnessed&#44; 
to prove the existence of a peculiar essence&#44; which we for want 
of a better term call the human soul&#44; which is different&#44; in 
every sense of the word&#44; from organized nature which sur&#8211; 
rounds us &#59; but it would be useless and moreover tiresome to 
you&#44; my brethren&#44; who with me&#44; as Jews and as believers&#44; fully 
believe in the permanence of our soul in being after the separa&#8211; 
tion of the body. &#8212; And can it be possible&#44; even if there were 
no light from revelation to inform us&#44; that a system so noble&#44;

SO incomprehensibly great&#44; could have been created for no other 
purpose than to enable a handsomer mould of clay than that of 
the dog to live only for a brief space of time&#44; more comfortably 
perhaps&#44; but at last&#44; just like a dog&#44; to eat&#44; to drink&#44; to sleep&#44; to 
fight&#44; to snarl&#44; to propagate its species&#44; and to sink at length 
into death&#44; into darkness&#44; into oblivion&#44; into non&#8211;existence &#63; 
What needed man the inextinguishable thirst for knowledge&#44; 
the inexhaustible desire for ulterior happiness&#44; if he were cre&#8211; 
ated for no other end &#63; Would he for that alone be enabled to 
cross the ocean in search of wisdom &#59; ascend beyond the clouds 
in search of knowledge &#59; dive into the depth of the sea&#44; go 
down into the bowels of the earth in search of adventure&#44; and 
direct his searching gaze into the starry heaven : would God 
have given him such vast extensive powers&#44; I ask&#44; merely that 
he might be liable to more distress&#44; subject to more misfortunes&#44; 
exposed to more diseases than the dog&#44; but like him to die 
away into non&#8211;existence&#63; &#8212; The idea is too monstrous to be 
assumed&#44; even for argument&#39;s sake&#44; as reasonable &#59; and we may 
freely assert&#44; that the doctrine of the immortality of the soul 
Avill only be disputed by the wicked transgressor of God&#39;s 
law&#44; who thereby vainly hopes to steel his heart against the 
self&#8211;accusations of his own conscience&#44; that he may be enabled 
to follow the path of sin without any compunctious visiting of 
his inward monitor. &#8212; For the sake therefore of following the 
bent of a sinful inclination&#44; for the purpose of chiming in with 
a pernicious fashion Avhich leads to ungodliness&#44; does the reck&#8211; 
less sinner deny the most consolatory hope which religion and 
revelation impart&#44; and thereby he incurs the more deservedly 
the very punishment which he vainly strives to reason away&#44; 
as though reasoning&#44; even the most plausible&#44; were in the least 
able to remove what is true. &#8212; But brightly beams the light of 
hope for those who are watchful over their deeds&#44; for the hum&#8211; 
ble and the pious&#44; who&#44; vvhen suffering the ills which as men 
they cannot even desire to escape&#44; look upon the world beyond 
the grave as their true abode&#44; where they may dwell securely&#44; 
unburthened from care and sorrow&#44; released from pain and 
grief&#44; enlightened in wisdom&#44; purified by trials&#44; and blest of 
their Maker&#44; and basking in the sunshine of his unending and 
unchanging favour. And thus said Solomon in his Eccle&#8211;

siastes eighth chapter&#44; 11th and 12th verses : &#34; Because punish&#8211; 
ment does not follow evil deeds quickly&#44; therefore becomes the 
heart of the children of men careless and practises the evil. &#8212; 
But let the sinner commit sins a hundred&#8211;fold&#44; and experience 
indulgence: yet am I convinced&#44; that true happiness will be 
the sure recompense of those that fear God&#44; whilst they 
fear Him.&#34; &#8212; And yet people doubt&#44; and become faint&#8211;hearted 
under every tribulation&#44; and when sorrow and trouble enter 
their doors in the round which the evil destiny takes in 
the world&#44; they imagine their own misfortune the most grie&#8211; 
vous&#44; and they accuse the Deity of injustice in heaping so 
much distress upon them who are so very innocent&#44; so very 
charitable&#44; so much devoted to the practice of religious duties&#33; 
And as they see their neighbours&#39; faces drest up with smiles&#44; 
as they behold their friends in apparent happiness&#44; as they do 
not discover that their enemies have any cause to complain : 
they come to the conclusion that they themselves alone are un&#8211; 
happy &#59; and they ask&#44; what advantage it can be to them that 
they practise so much self&#8211;denial in the cause of religion 
and the exercise of humanity&#44; since they are exposed to trials&#44; 
from which others are exempt &#63; Weak souls&#44; like these we 
have been describing&#44; are but too apt to yield their shallow 
piety to their misfortunes&#44; and their untried honesty becomes 
changed into fraud and deceit&#59; as they conceive that piety and 
rectitude do not bring any advantage&#44; because they have found 
out&#44; that they in the exercise of both suffered misfortunes which&#44; 
as said&#44; they believe others did not encounter. &#8212; But such arguing 
is altogether false. Those&#44; whose faces bear the everlasting 
smile are not necessarily happy&#59; those whom the world terms 
fortunate are not always to be envied&#59; and but lift the veil 
which hides their inmost heart&#44; and you might weep over the 
distresses of the smiling sufferer&#59; could you but dive into the 
soul of the envied happy one&#44; you would be startled at the ac&#8211; 
cumulation of wo you would there discover. And as for the 
idea that those who are irreligious and dishonest have the ad&#8211; 
vantage over you who are suffering the accumulated ills of life: 
it is all again but outward show&#59; impiety&#44; although it scoffs&#44; is 
still but a wretched defence against the canker&#8211;worm of con&#8211;

the deceived friend&#44; from the confiding stranger&#44; the beguiled 
widow&#44; and the helpless orphan&#44; though a credulous world flatter 
and fawn upon him&#44; he too is at heart a wretch&#44; tormented be&#8211; 
yond endurance&#44; fearing exposure&#44; dreading the loss of a repu&#8211; 
tation which he has endeavoured to establish&#44; and trembling at 
the thought of being deprived of that ill&#8211;gotten wealth&#44; to ob&#8211; 
tain which he has sold his im.mortal soul to perdition. &#8212; This 
much may be said in answer to the complaint&#44; that we alone 
are suffering. And in reply to the accusation of God&#39;s justice&#44; 
as though He punished us when not deserving it&#44; we should 
consider that not one of us is free from fault&#44; that not one of us 
can boast of having never infringed the laws which God has or&#8211; 
dained. If then we do suffer&#44; let us not forget that we are sinning 
mortals&#44; and that the infliction is sent to admonish us that we have 
erred&#44; or to warn us that the path we were intending to pursue 
was one of perdition. For God&#44; who knows the thoughts of men 
even before they are accomplished&#44; sends us tokens of displeasure 
at our intended conduct&#44; if we have in other cases followed his 
will &#59; as the prophetess says: &#34;He guards the feet of his righteous 
ones&#59;&#34; and as Ezekiel says in another place: &#34;And what rises 
on your heart shall not be done.&#34; Now therefore&#44; if such a 
warning is sent&#44; we should&#44; in place of repining&#44; investigate 
and see in what we have been sinning&#44; and amend our lives 
whilst there is yet time&#44; before the sands in the hourglass of 
life have entirely run to waste &#59; and if we intended any wrong&#44; 
if our uniform prosperity caused our hearts to wax proud and 
our soul to become presumptuous : we should bow with thank&#8211; 
fulness to the chastisement&#44; and bless the all&#8211;wise One for 
having stretched out as it were his potent hand&#44; and snatched us 
as a firebrand from amidst the consuming fire. &#8212; But if we 
grumble at the dispensation instead of repenting &#59; if we will 
not heed the warning when it is kindly given &#59; if we resist the 
whisperings of the holy spirit which tells us to beware&#59; if we in 
short hurry down the road which leads to the pit of destruction : 
who is it that is blameable&#63; is it He whose ways are all just 
and true&#63; or we&#44; the sinning&#44; foolish worms of the earth&#44; who&#44; 
despite of our short&#8211;sightedness and our exposure to fallibility 
and corruption&#44; dare to measure our insufficient righteousness&#44; 
be this ever so great&#44; against the justice of Him who cannot

err &#63; Besides it must not be forgotten&#44; that perhaps there 
never was an infliction sent upon the righteous which was be&#8211; 
yond their endurance&#44;&#42; and those who have stood firm amidst 
their trials&#44; how purely have they com.e out of the furnace in 
which their integrity had been probed. &#8212; Besides the cause of 
sin just exposed there is another which assumes the air of a 
philanthropic and even a pious cast of reasoning&#44; and thus 
militates against the dictates of revealed religion. Persons 
wishing to free themselves from religious observances assert 
constantly&#44; that the law could not possibly have been intended 
to act with such burthensome severity upon us. They say&#44; 
the benignant Being whom we adore could not have any 
pleasure in our punishing our bodies with fasting&#59; He who 
loves all his creatures alike could never think to lay Israel 
under so many and disadvantageous restrictionsas regards the ob&#8211; 
servance of the Sabbaths and theholydays&#59; the abstaining from 
forbidden food &#59; the restriction with regard to forming family 
connections with persons of other nations&#44; and laws of similar 
import&#59; and some even inveigh with apparent bitterness and 
sincerity against the sealing of our children with the covenant 
of Abraham&#44; as cruel and barbarous. &#8212; And such reasoning as 
this it is by which people mislead themselves and others &#59; 
&#34; God&#44;&#34; they say&#44; &#34; could not command such things&#59;&#34; but we 
say and maintain He did command them&#44; and moreover threatens 
punishment for non&#8211;obedience. Now even wave this &#59; and 
what does the objection amount to &#63; to no more than this&#59; that 
whereas persons find the Jewish law demanding certain trials 
of their faith&#44; which cannot under ordinary contingencies cause 

&#42; This brings to my mind the aftecting history of an Israelitish female&#44; 
who in the midst of the sack of the town in which she lived saw a brutal 
soldier entering her apartment. He endeavoured to seize her&#59; &#34; Stop&#44;&#34; she 
said&#44; &#34;I can give you a charm which if yon wear it will prevent your being

perfectly in earnest&#44; and to prove my sincerity you may fire at me as I hold 
this paper to my heart.&#34; She stood firm &#59; held a paper upon which the pre&#8211; 
tended charm wns written to her lieart&#44; the j&#8211;oldier fired&#44; and to his amaze&#8211; 
ment the Jewisli maiden lay a bleeding corpse at his feet&#59; she died&#44; but her 
spirit came undefiled before her Maker. Thus we see that&#44; as this example 
partly illustrates&#44; there is no situation in which the righteous are altogether 
without that heavenly assistance which always comes to their aid.

the most remote actual harm&#44; and being unwilling to make any 
sacrifices whatever except such as tally precisely with their 
notions of justice and conscience&#44; they reject them at once 
as unreasonable. Is this not true &#63; But let us take a few 
of the objections and review them in brief detail. &#8212; &#34; God 
cannot wish that we should fast&#44;&#34; the lukewarm assert. 
But we say He does wish it&#44; provided the punishing of the body 
is accompanied by a sincere repentance and by a knowledge 
why and wherefore we fast&#44; that is to say&#44; that in doing pen&#8211; 
ance we direct our thoughts and our prayers to the almighty 
One from whom all forgiveness must come. &#8212; Even without 
this absolute preparation for repentance there is one day of 
penance ordained&#44; on which every Israelite is to abstain from 
food and drink &#59; by which it was intended to effect&#44; that at the 
annual recurrence of so solemn a day&#44; many&#44; if not all&#44; should 
be led to look into their deeds and to amend whatever they 
may find defective&#44; and to endeavour to heal up breaches of 
social friendship and brotherly love&#44; which clashing interests 
may have interrupted in other periods of the year. &#8212; Is such an 
institution reasonable &#63; &#8212; From amidst the mass of idolaters&#44; 
worshippers of graven and hewn images&#44; God wanted to select 
a people to be his own peculiar treasure for ever &#59; and He 
appeared to them when they groaned under heavy afflictions&#44; 
and He redeemed them from servitude to freedom on the day 
the anniversary whereof we are soon to celebrate. &#8212; His people 
they were to be&#44; to receive his holy laws as a trust&#44; but which 
should ultimately be the rule of life for all mankind&#44; when they 
had become fit for the pure ideal worship of his holiness and 
greatness. To prevent their being mixed up with other nations 
He cast their lot in the most lovely portion&#44; and He surrounded 
Jacob with a wall of defence as it were&#44; by imparting to them 
peculiar statutes and ordinances&#44; and He gave them in love and 
kindness&#44; his Sabbaths of rest and his holydays for rejoicing&#44; 
and He interdicted them from mingling in the indulgencies of 
the animal frame with the nations of the earth &#59; and He there&#8211; 
fore forbade things to these permitted &#59; and also&#44; as the Israel&#8211; 
ites were but the fewest of nations. He ordained that no Jew 
should take as the wife of his bosom the daughter of the 
stranger&#44; lest by so doing the name of Jacob might become lost

from amongst the nations of the earth. &#8212; And from our birth we 
were bought as God&#39;s servants&#44; and tlierefore when one week 
has passed over the infant&#39;s head the seal of God&#39;s covenant&#44; 
holy and everlasting&#44; is to be impressed on him &#59; and God says : 
&#34; For my servants are the children of Israel.&#34; By this cere&#8211;

as was commanded&#44; and the parent that can refuse his child this 
induction into the holy covenant has left it imperfect &#59; for only 
through its observance was Abraham made perfect. &#8212; But alas &#33; 
we have fallen upon evil times &#33; Philosophizing by ignorant 
and presumptuous pretenders is the order of the day&#44; and well 
nigh have those&#44; who would gladly raise their voice against the 
spreading corruption&#44; been rendered dumb&#44; since they perceive 
their counsels neglected&#44; and their solemn admonitions un&#8211;

wishes not the truth to be told &#59; yes&#44; we can sin&#44; we can glory 
in sinning &#59; but let no one dare to tell us that we are sinning&#59; 
we must needs hate him who reveals us to ourselves &#59; and thus 
we go on calling our teachers bigots and fanatics&#44; and flatter 
ourselves that this is the real balsam which must and will for

priestcraft &#33; all is the invention of ignorance &#33; all the machina&#8211;

we turn away our unwilling ear&#44; and say : &#34; We are already

ancestors.&#34; &#8212; But sons and daughters of Israel &#33; shall it indeed

such wickedness consummated &#33; &#8212; In the meantime&#44; God will 
always preserve men&#44; as instruments&#44; who will be deputed to

the voice of one be hushed by death&#44; another will be there to 
supply his place&#44; and if one should like Jonah be afraid from 
one cause or another to announce the word that is within him&#44; 
another and another yet will be at hand to fulfil the sacred mis&#8211;

and can we believe that the world&#44; that we&#44; should so much 
retrograde&#44; as to have none willing to go out with God&#39;s mes&#8211; 
sage upon his lips&#63; No&#44; let sinners not flatter themselves&#44; that 
the voice is dead which spoke through Moses. God never dies&#44; 
and even were there not a single man to speak&#44; the word itself 
survives still&#44; and will yet longer survive and strike terror into 
the heart which yields itself to sin. 

Thus I have endeavoured to give&#44; as briefly as I could&#44; 
answers to the questions which presented themselves to our 
view &#59; the task however has been but very imperfectly accom&#8211; 
plished&#44; since so little has been saidof what suggests itself upon 
even a cursory view of the subject. But as it is one so fruitful 
in contemplation&#44; I may call your attention to it again perhaps 
in a short time. &#8212; Having now in a measure exposed by the 
light of reason and sound common sense&#44; alone the folly of the 
motives of sin&#44; let us turn our attention to the concurrent 
announcements of prophecy&#44; which treat upon the subject. Mala&#8211; 
chi says&#44; chapter iii&#44; verse 5 : 

    <pb n="414"/>

RECOMPENSE AND RETRIBUTION. 115 

&#34;And I will approach to you for judgment&#44; and I will be a swift witness 
against wizards&#44; and adulterers&#44; and those that swear falsely&#44; and that withhold 
the pay of the hireling&#44; and that injure the widow&#44; the orphan&#44; and tlie 
stranger&#44; and did not fear me&#44; says the Lord of Zebaoth. For I the Lord 
change not&#44; and you&#44; children of Jacob do not perish.&#34; 

Here the prophet announces the punishment which is to 
befal the transgressors against the law of God&#44; and confirms 
the certainty thereof&#44; by stating that He&#44; the Lord&#44; changes not&#44; 
and consequently&#44; if the punishment be even deferred&#44; the 
day of judgment will come at length&#44; when the unchangea&#8211; 
ble One will be sure to mete out even&#8211;handed justice. And 
continues the prophet : &#34; And you shall go out and see the 
difference between the righteous and the wicked&#44; between him 
that served God and him that has not served Him. For behold 
the day will come burning like a furnace&#44; and all the transgres&#8211; 
sors and evil&#8211;doers shall be like straw&#44; and it shall burn them 
up the day that comes&#44; says the Lord of Zebaoth&#44; who will not 
leave them root nor branch.&#8212; But to you who fear my name&#44; 
the sun of righteousness shall shine&#44; and healing shall be in his 
wings.&#34; In the same strain speaks Isaiah&#44; chapter Ixv : &#34; I 
have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people&#44; 
that go the way which is not good after their own thoughts : a 
people that sit upon graves&#44; and lodge among the monu&#8211; 
ments&#44; that eat the flesh of the swine&#44; and broth of abominable 
things is in their vessels&#44; that say&#44; Stand by thyself&#44; come not 
near me &#59; I am holier than thou &#59;&#39; these are smoke in my 
nostrils&#44; a fire that burns all the day.&#34;&#8212; And says Isaiah: 
&#34; Thus says the Lord : As the new wine is found in the grape &#59; 
and one sayeth destroy it not&#44; for a blessing is in it : so will I 
do for my servant&#39;s sake&#44; not to destroy the whole &#59; and I will 
bring out from Jacob a seed&#44; and from Judah an inheritor of my 
mountains &#59; and my elect shall inherit it&#44; and my servants shall 
dwell there. &#8212; But you that forsake the Lord &#8212; behold my ser&#8211; 
vants shall eat and you shall be hungry &#59; behold my servants 
shall drink&#44; and you shall be thirsty &#59; behold my servant shall 
be glad&#44; and you shall be ashamed &#33; Behold my servants shall 
shout from a joyous heart&#44; and you shall cry from a heart of 
pain&#44; and howl from a broken spirit&#44;&#34; &#8212; And in conclusion he 
says of the righteous : &#34; And it shall come to pass&#44; that ere they

call and I will answer&#44; whilst yet they are speaking&#44; I will 
hear.&#34; &#8212; Ezekiel also confirms the foregoing promises&#44; when 
saying&#44; chapter xx : &#34; As sure as I live&#44; says the Lord God&#44; 
if not with a strong hand and an outstretched arm&#44; and with 
wrath poured forth I will rule over you.&#34; &#8212; And farther: &#34;And 
I will cause you to pass under the rod&#44; and bring you then in 
the covenant which has been handed down. And I will select 
from among you those that have rebelled and transgressed 
against me&#44; from the land of their sojourning I will bring them 
out&#44; but to the land of Israel they shall not come&#44; and you shall 
know that I am the Lord.&#34; &#8212; I have in the above endeavoured 
to give you a few passages&#44; selected from a very large number&#44; 
to prove that the judgment of God must sooner or later over&#8211; 
take the transgressors&#44; and if his mercy should delay the pun&#8211; 
ishment&#44; it is nevertheless only deferred&#44; not relinquished. &#8212; 
What has thus been proved by common sense and Holy Writ&#44; 
and what your own experience so amply confirms&#44; requires no 
admonition to recommend to your serious attention. Let it 
then sink deeply into y&#8211;our hearts&#44; you who are from the house 
of Israel&#44; you who have in your ancestors partaken of the mira&#8211; 
culous deliverance from Egypt&#59; let it be a lesson never to be 
forgotten&#44; that upon the way of religion there is ultimate life&#44; 
although the path be beset by dangers and pain &#59; and that the 
road of sin leads to destruction&#44; although its first appearance 
may be ever so inciting&#44; and seemingly invite to a multitude 
of pleasures. &#8212; You who are fathers &#33; you who are mothers &#33; 
impress on your children&#39;s minds&#44; that those alone who love 
God can have peace&#44; but that to the wicked there is no peace &#33; 
and you youth and maidens who wish to reach a happy old age&#44; 
and who desire a tranquil and peaceful end&#44; remember that 
long life and happiness&#44; and peace of mind&#44; and the favour of 
God are only to be found upon the way of righteousness.

Brethren &#33; 

To the man whose eyes are opened by a knowledge of the 
way of righteousness&#59; to the soul that adores her God and 
Creator&#59; to the mind filled with love for mankind&#59; it must he a 
matter of surprise and grief to observe&#44; among the multifarious 
and varied classes that constitute the mass of mankind&#44; so little 
perception of the utility and necessity of a religious education 
for their children&#44; or of the duty every one is under to make 
himself familiar with the behests of revelation. What pains 
are not taken to teach our children the tongues of various na&#8211; 
tions&#59; how much labour is not spent in the pursuit of worldly 
sciences&#59; what stress is not laid upon the acquisition of mere 
accomplishment even&#59; &#8212; but only touch the subject of religion 
and branches therewith connected&#44; and you are at once told&#44; 
that it is quite useless to learn Hebrew&#44; a language no more 
spoken&#44; consequently of no practical use&#59; and as for religious 
knowledge &#8212; that can be obtained by reading the sacred writings&#59; 
and morality can be gotten very easily by going to churches 
of the various sects amongst whom we live&#59; practical know&#8211; 
ledge of political sciences are promulgated in worldly schools&#59; 
and consequently there can be no necessity for spending years 
and months and days in the obtainment of religious informa&#8211; 
tion&#44; properly so termed. That such reasoning prevails&#44; cannot 
be denied&#44; and that it is very fallacious and very pernicious&#44; 
must be evident from the first view a candid man takes of the 
subject. Still so many are misled&#44; and so many have become 
irreligious&#44; immoral&#44; and I fear infidel&#44; that I beg you&#44; my 
brethren&#44; to bear with me whilst I endeavour to show the ne&#8211; 
cessity of a particular religious education for our children&#44; and 
the obligation which rests upon parents to qualify themselves 
for the holy task incumbent on them&#44; as fathers and mothers&#44; of 
bringing up the pledges of conjugal love&#44; the trust confided to 
them by God&#44; in a way which best comports with the love and 
duty which the creature owes to the Creator&#44; and which secures 
in the best possible manner individual and general happiness.

I have alluded to a knowledge of the Hebrew as in some man&#8211; 
ner connected with religion&#59; and since all our forms of worship 
and our sacred records are in that language: it may not be out 
of place to offer a few observations to prove the necessity of 
retaining it in our worship&#44; and to deprecate a substitution of 
any other in its stead. A national tongue binds together the 
people speaking it in one bond&#44; and cements a union hardly 
otherwise attainable. Such a thing may be&#44; as nations or tribes 
speaking different languages to be governed by the same law&#59; 
but where is that fellow&#8211;feeling&#44; that brotherly attachment which 
people of the same speech feel&#63; Not to go farther than a 
neighbouring country&#44; which was conquered now about eighty 
years ago&#44; where the people have never been molefeted&#44; as far 
as I know&#44; in their laws&#44; privileges&#44; and even mere prejudices&#59; 
add to which that the benefits of an extension of wholesome 
laws&#44; of freedom from public burdens&#44; of a wide&#8211;spreading 
commerce have been conferred: and still the difference of lan&#8211; 
guage between the rulers and the ruled has been the constant 
cause of heart&#8211;burning and contention&#44; and a united effort for 
the public good is hardly thought of. Let us apply this single 
fact&#44; which can be strengthened by a thousand others&#44; from an&#8211; 
cient and modern story&#44; to our own case. In the land of the 
East&#44; where first were cradled the germs of civilization and 
knowledge&#44; our nation sprung up like a tender sprout&#44; like a 
feeble shoot&#44; from amidst the multitudes of nations. Abraham 
wandered out of his father&#39;s idolatrous home and went forth 
over the fair regions of the South&#44; the harbinger of peace 
Avherever he came. He spoke the language of Shem his ances&#8211; 
tor&#44; &#8211;a language forcible and clear&#44; full of elegant imagery and 
true to nature in its figures and sublime conceptions. With 
the growth of the people the language also grew into a national 
dialect&#44; and even in the midst of the powerful and polished 
state of Egypt the Israelites still retained the language of He&#8211; 
ber. Think you it was a close bond during their dreadful suf&#8211; 
ferings&#63; Most undoubtedly&#59; and what better could have been 
found to make their hearts glow with rapturous hope&#44; when the 
father bondman told to the child&#44; whose prospect too was 
slavery and bondage&#44; of the wonders which God had displayed 
unto their simple shepherd&#8211;ancestors&#44; and how He had promised 

    <pb n="419"/>

&#40;using the sacred words of the holy Jacob &#59;&#63; 
And God will be with you&#44; and bring you 
back to the land of your fathers&#63;&#34; Think you that hope 
could have fled at words like these&#63; Think you that the lan&#8211; 
guage too did not fall on the ear like sweet music which bids 
the mourning soul rejoice&#63; &#8212; Anon the law was given&#44; and in 
words clear and distinct the Most High announced his will. &#8212; 
The words spoken we have read this day&#44; and the language 
again was the language of Abraham. Israel conquered the land 
of promise&#44; and dwelt in their inheritance in security. And 
nobly too did the language do its work&#44; and there arose a 
Deborah to sing the song &#59; there was a David&#44; who attuned his 
harp to inimitable and undying praise&#59; there was a Solomon&#44; 
whose wisdom yet teaches the world&#59; an Isaiah&#44; whose elo&#8211; 
quence yet rouses the heart&#59; a Jeremiah&#44; who yet bids the tears 
to flow at the downfal of the populous city&#44; and a host of others&#44; 
whose genius and whose piety must in all ages command admi&#8211; 
ration. And when Israel fell&#44; because they had become sinful&#44; 
and when the language was supplanted by the speech of various 
nations: it found restorers in Ezra&#44; Nehemiah&#44; Zechariah&#44; and 
Malachi&#44; besides many more who assisted them in the holy 
ta&#39;sk. And although the Hebrew has been banished by our dis&#8211; 
persion from being our every&#8211;day language: it yet holds&#44; I may 
freely say&#44; a higher place&#44; it contains all that remains of the 
wisdom of our ancestors&#59; nay more&#44; it holds all the commands 
which God revealed to mankind for their guidance &#33; This is 
the Hebrew&#44; and this is briefly its history. Despite now of 
our dispersion &#8212; despite of our being&#44; alas &#33; known as Ameri&#8211; 
cans&#44; Englishmen&#44; Frenchmen&#44; Germans&#44; Poles&#44; Grecians&#44; Ta&#8211; 
tars&#44; and by numerous other names: still the Hebrew has always 
maintained its position in the love and the heart of all true 
Israelites&#44; and has also constituted the bond which has kept uni&#8211; 
ted the captivity of Jacob in all parts of the world &#33; And here 
comes one from the burning plains of Africa&#59; there another 
from the icy fields of the Arctic regions&#59; yonder pilgrim calls 
the highlands of middle Asia his home&#59; and this one is an exile 
from Spain&#39;s blood&#8211;stained sierras. And listen &#33; as the mes&#8211; 
senger addresses the throne of Grace&#44; how a simultaneous Amen 
bursts from all their lips &#33; the language they hear is not to them

the language of the stranger&#44; the sounds&#44; though ancient sounds&#44; 
are to their ears familiar as the first breathings of childhood&#39;s 
years&#44; and in the land of the stranger&#44; where they all meet but 
as strangers&#44; the holy tongue is their bond&#44; and by it they do 
meet as a band of brothers&#44; and all thus unite to call with one 
voice upon their God&#44; who is truly the Preserver of Israel. &#8212; 
Does it then comport with reason to retain the knowledge of so 
great a gift &#63; or shall we idly throw it off as a thing whose value 
is lost&#59; forsake it as a spring whose waters are dried up&#63; Never 
may this be&#33; The blessing this inheritance has always bestowed 
is of yet daily recurrence&#44; and who would madly neglect what 
is to him of vital importance&#63; Thus you have presented to 
you&#44; brethren&#44; an illustration&#44; an argument would require more 
time&#44; of the object and advantage of the Hebrew to us&#44; as Jews. 
It is&#44; namely&#44; our national&#44; our vernacular tongue&#59; it is one of 
the links in that great chain which has ever firmly bound Israel 
together as one nation. I take it for granted&#44; that there are but 
few who wish its knowledge altogether extirpated&#59; but still there 
are also an immense number&#44; especially in this country&#44; and I 
grieve to say in this city&#44; perhaps among those who now hear me&#44; 
that think but lightly of the importance of its acquisition. But as 
the acquaintance with an instrument so valuable must be in the 
same proportion useful&#44; it is certainly a matter of surprise that no 
more is done to further the means of its attainment. As a mere 
matter of curiosity much is studied&#59; more things again receive at&#8211; 
tention solely because they are elegant&#59; and therefore it is incon&#8211; 
ceivable&#44; how a Jew can rest satisfied with an entire ignorance of 
his sacred language when the opportunity for the removal of such 
unpardonable ignorance is within his reach. Even if means were 
not readily at hand&#44; I should still think it the duty of every 
Israelite&#44; no matter of what sex&#44; station&#44; or capacity&#44; to en&#8211; 
deavour to remedy the defect with regard to teachers&#44; or in 
other words&#44; schools should be established wherein the instruc&#8211; 
tion of the Hebrew should be one of the principal objects of 
education. If this were done&#44; if the acknowledged defect were 
to be encountered by a united effort&#44; it is impossible but that 
the blessing of God would attend the undertaking&#59; and even in 
this western world&#44; almost at the opposite extreme whence 
civilization commenced her course&#44; even here I say&#44; men

honouring their brethren by their splendid acquirements in the 
learning of our ancients&#44; and in a correct knowledge of biblical 
criticism&#44; would crown the effort so piously undertaken and so 
happily accomplished. &#8212; But I speak of anticipations&#44; of things 
I fear hardly to be realized &#33; &#8212; too much of self&#8211;aggrandisement 
is the order of the day &#59; &#8212; disinterested exertions for public 
good are occurrences but rarely witnessed &#59; &#8212; and an enterprize 
which instead of bringing gain might occasion pecuniary loss&#44; 
is not of the nature to claim the attention of capitalists&#44; of men&#44; 
who&#44; having already as much or more than they can consume 
in all human probability&#44; must still go on increasing their stock 
of uncounted wealth&#44; till all at once death arrests their extended 
grasp ere the perhaps intended good was even commenced. 
Some may think that I am too unjust towards those whom the 
world calls rich&#44; it may appear to savour of disappointment to 
charge upon a class the transgressions of a few : but in reply to 
this I have merely to remark&#44; that the fact of nothing or next 
to nothing having been done in so many places&#44; and among 
others in this very town&#44; warrants me in saying that persons 
having the power to lend a helping hand cannot be very sincere 
in their professions towards furthering an education&#44; the ne&#8211; 
cessity of which has been amply shown&#44; whilst they rest satis&#8211; 
fied with merely giving vent to expressions of good wishes&#44; and 
leave actions to others than themselves. Our nation suffers 
much in the estimation of the gentile world by such inexcu&#8211; 
sable negligence&#59; and those&#44; who value such a standing and 
fame among the non&#8211;Israelites so highly&#44; may rest assured that 
their indifference towards their own brethren and their own 
religious interests does by no means raise their standing&#59; on 
the contrary&#44; if we exert ourselves for ourselves a little more 
energetically than we do&#44; we may certainly succeed in obtaining 
the admiration of the gentiles&#44; although their love may be 
denied to us&#44; which I must sincerely declare is hardly attain&#8211; 
able by an opposite course even. Yet let us hope&#44; at least let 
hope not die away altogether&#44; that the ancient spirit of devotion 
may one day be rekindled&#44; and that the lukewarmness for the 
holy cause may be succeeded by an earnestness and zeal cha 
racteristic of a renovated love for righteous exertions. If this 
should happen&#44; willingly would I be charged with having 

    <pb n="422"/>

falsely accused and unjustly judged persons whose real value&#44; 
and the depth of whose piety I had underrated. Yet&#44; till this is 
made manifest&#44; let the humble individual who now addresses 
you not be blamed for giving utterance to what he honestly be&#8211; 
lieves to be the truth&#44; especially as the words employed cannot 
wound the feelings&#44; pride&#44; or self&#8211;love&#44; or whatever else you 
may term it&#44; of any one. &#8212; The consideration of the foregoing 
has almost insensibly drawn me from my purpose &#59; I certainly 
had but intended merely to touch the importance of the Hebrew 
language &#59; but if I should have succeeded in arresting your at&#8211; 
tention upon this interesting subject&#44; I shall consider it as having 
done a service in the promotion of religious education. 

Let us now revert to the general necessity there is for persons 
to become familiar with religious duties&#44; and of the obligation 
they are under to impart the knowledge so obtained to the rising 
generation. Some one may now object : &#34; That religion is so 
plainly taught in the Bible&#44; that it requires no other study or 
investigation than reading the Scriptures.&#34; No one will deny 
that the sacred writings contain alone the whole system of re&#8211; 
velation&#44; and that their study and perusal must greatly improve 
the understanding. Nevertheless it is not to be lost sight of&#44; 
that a great share of knowledge and of pious feelings are a prg&#8211;&#8211; 
requisite towards entering upon this important study. &#8212; Take 
for example&#44; that one should not be able to read&#44; what use 
should he make of the book placed in his hand &#63; &#8212; Suppose 
again one were blind&#44; how is he to read &#63; &#8212; Again&#44; let us take a 
worldly man&#44; constantly engaged in business&#44; what time will 
he find to read &#63; These are obvious cases&#59; but there are an 
immense number of others equally powerful though less ap&#8211; 
parent in preventing persons from reading the Bible with profit. 
A person reading may not understand the phraseology em&#8211; 
ployed &#59; he may be ignorant of every collateral information 
which could enable him to comprehend the subject he peruses. 
Another again may have seen wickedness daily practised&#59; 
another in his youth may have heard the Bible&#8211;tenets abused 
and ridiculed&#44; perhaps by his very parents : in all such cases&#44; 
I would ask&#44; what efiect can mere reading have&#44; without ad&#8211; 
mitting a direct miracle almost&#44; but to leave the reader either 
ignorant as he was before&#44; or as wicked as he was when he began.

124 RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. 

It is not necessary to argue a thing so very plain any further&#44; 
especially when we daily see&#44; that without previous instruction 
but little is learned by intelligent and great minds even. There 
are so many avocations in the world&#44; so much there is always 
to distract our attention&#44; that we hardly can fix our minds to 
any particular pursuit or to any one especial study. If we are 
therefore to profit by any thing&#44; or to become eminent in any 
calling&#44; we must begin to learn early&#44; and to apply at a later 
period the knowledge obtained by such slow degrees and at the 
expense of so much pains and labour. &#8212; Ask the musician when 
he began his brilliant career &#63; generally the answer will be : 
&#34; When I was a child.&#34; &#8212; The accomplished dancer : &#34; I began 
at seven years old.&#34; To go to higher accomplishments : a 
painter evinced talents as a boy which had to be cultivated by 
a life of application &#59; the advocate commences his studies when 
he begins to speak&#44; and at his death at an advanced age he has 
yet much to learn&#59; the physician on the day of his departure&#44; 
perhaps&#44; finds his whole theory of medicine to have been falla&#8211; 
cious&#59; in short every pursuit&#44; from the smallest to the highest&#44; 
requires its apprenticeship&#44; without which nothing can be 
gained&#59; and yet to hear persons speak we should suppose that 
religious knowledge&#44; the perception of our duties and appoint&#8211; 
ment on earth&#44; the study of the word of God were matters&#44; which 
can be picked up as it were by the child as he goes along in 
the world&#44; or that perhaps such high knowledge is intuitive&#44; 
and therefore to be obtained without any labour whatever. But 
who will maintain in sober earnestness that we learn our duties 
from our own invention &#63; or rather&#44; is it not reduced to an un&#8211; 
controvertible certainty that all knowledge&#44; even that of morals 
and religion&#44; so called by way of distinction&#44; must be acquired 
by slow degrees&#63; How then is the child to become religious &#63; 
how is he to read the Bible understandingly&#44; if instruction 
upon the most essential subject of life is to be withheld from 
him &#63; &#8212; Some however may say: &#34; That they will admit&#44; that 
male children should be carefully instructed&#44; that it is perfectly 
reasonable that those who are to become&#44; as it is called&#44; &#39; the 
lords of creation&#39; should be qualified for their stations by a 
careful training&#44; that their morals should be carefully attended 
to and their mental culture strictly watched over. But females.

they aver&#44; need not that knowledge&#44; theirs being a more de&#8211; 
pendant lot&#44; it is immaterial whether they are high&#8211;learned in 
sacred literature or versed in the holy tongue&#59; in short for 
them superficial reading is enough&#44; for them it were sufficient 
if the lighter branches of elegant learning were cultivated by 
them.&#34; As usual&#44; this reasoning contains with some sprinkling 
of soundness a great share of fallacy&#44; which will be apparent 
upon a slight review of the question. It is not to be denied&#44; 
that it is almost entirely useless for the female to become 
learned in the strictest sense of the word&#44; it would indeed unsex 
her&#44; if she were to study the legal profession &#59; if she were to 
step abroad as a physician&#59; if she&#44; forgetful of feminine decorum&#44; 
would lay on the harness of war&#44; and wage a mortal combat 
with the enemy. Well has it been commanded : &#34; There shall 
not be man&#39;s apparel upon a woman&#44;&#34; for the female&#39;s sphere 
is not the highway&#44; not the public streets&#44; not the embattled 
field&#44; not the public halls. But her home should be the place 
of her actions&#44; there her influence should be felt&#44; to soothe&#44; to 
calm&#44; to sanctify&#44; to render happy the rugged career of a father&#44; a 
brother&#44; a husband&#44; or a child. Yet&#44; how is she to become quali&#8211; 
fied for this holy&#44; for this noble&#44; task&#44; if you leave herminda blank 
&#8212; a barren waste &#8212; open to the evil seed which the world&#39;s cor&#8211; 
ruption is but too apt to scatter&#63; Behold this woman&#44; watch her 
well&#44; and then decide upon her claims to your regard and affec&#8211; 
tions. She is proud&#44; vain&#44; frivolous&#44; ignorant&#44; vicious&#44; and you 
despise her&#44; she no doubt is undeserving of your regard &#59; but 
the fault is hardly hers&#44; it is her parents and teachers that are 
to blame. God had given her beauty&#44; a mind&#8211; alive to the 
charms of nature &#59; a soul delighting in the romantic and the 
affectionate&#59; wealth also had not been denied her&#44; since her father 
has all which a covetous world might desire. Now mark how 
this girl is educated. Before she can lisp she hears her charms 
praised &#59; her will is almost law to the dependants of the family&#59; 
the rod of correction she never is made to feel&#44; no matter what 
her faults may be &#59; the word of reproof even is but sparingly 
administered &#59; her schooling&#44; next&#44; is not of the highly morally 
elevated&#44; but again the frivolous&#44; the showy &#8212; grant it be elegant&#59; 
but her soul is all the time uncultivated&#44; because that is never 
regarded as of the least importance to her &#59; her beauty is to win

admiration &#59; her accomplishments are to captivate&#44; and her wit 
is to dazzle. And lo &#33; the bashful girl grows into the lovely 
woman&#59; flatterers crowd round her in greater number&#59; menials 
in larger swarms now await her commands&#59; she has perhaps 
rivals to encounter upon the path of conquest which she has 
chalked out for herself&#44; or which fond&#44; foolish parents have bid&#8211; 
den her to tread &#59; and what can you expect should be the result&#44; 
but that she should be proud &#8212; vain &#8212; frivolous &#8212; ignorant &#8212; 
vicious &#8212; revengeful&#44; and perhaps at last morally depraved &#63; &#8212; 
This indeed is but a fancy picture of a spoiled beautiful heiress&#59; 
but does it not apply almost to every female in a greater or less 
degree&#44; who has the advantage&#44; or rather the curse of an 
elegant education and a fashionable parentage&#63; At the same 
time the daughters of the commonly so called lower classes are 
in many respects but little better circumstanced&#59; since moral cul&#8211; 
ture is with them also much neglected at the expense of worldly 
and vain acquirements. &#8212; I do not wish to say&#44; that my observa&#8211; 
tions hold universally true&#44; but their general correctness cannot 
be gainsayed. All this must tend to prove that between the 
two extremes&#44; between unfeminine learning and useless acquire&#8211; 
ments&#44; the true course should be sought for. Our daughters 
then should learn early&#44; even whilst yet infants&#44; that they&#44; 
as well as the other sex&#44; are creatures and dependants of God &#59; 
they too should be early told of the greatness&#44; the mercy and 
the unending goodness of the Almighty&#59; they should be taught 
to direct their hopes in affliction&#44; and their confidence in pros&#8211; 
perity to the Giver of all good &#59; they should be informed&#44; that 
beauty is perishable&#44; wealth is fleeting&#44; joy evernescent&#44; and wis&#8211; 
dom fallacious &#59; they should be impressed with the conviction 
that flattery is a pernicious gift&#44; dangerous to the receiver&#59; that 
the world will crouch and cringe to the prosperous&#44; and turn 
away with disgust and loathing the confiding one whom they 
themselves have corrupted &#59; above all the father should betimes 
commence to teach his daughter the way she should go &#59; he 
should&#44; so to say&#44; be her guide on the road to eternal life &#59; he 
should bid her look into the sacred page to gather wisdom and 
hope from the undying words of Holy Writ&#59; and admonish 
her to cull the antidote to affliction from those records where it 
is taught to us that the virtuous are never forsaken &#59; especially 

    <pb n="426"/>

RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. 127 

however let him inform her&#44; how becoming is meekness&#44; and 
how lovely is modesty in the beautiful woman&#44; how much more 
commanding her loveliness must be&#44; if she bears it as a gift of 
Heaven&#44; not as some gaudy jewel of which the wearer may be 
proud. &#8212; Think you that an education based upon such princi&#8211; 
ples must be beneficial &#63; Even if the time consumed in this 
training should preclude the acquisition of accomplishment : 
still far better will it be that our daughters grow up religious 
women and excellent housewives&#44; than that they be elegant 
musicians&#44; skilful painters&#44; graceful dancers or pretenders to 
sciences&#44; which to the great majority of females must be quite 
useless. &#8212; If time is left&#44; if the parent&#39;s means will permit it&#44; 
then some of the more showy branches might with advantage 
be added&#59; but care should always be taken&#44; that they be viewed 
as secondary&#44; and that religious instruction and useful solid 
information should be the first&#44; the most important pursuit. &#8212; 
Whilst on the subject I cannot dismiss it without adding a few 
words as to the books which are generally considered fit for 
female reading &#59; I allude to the whole class of fictitious writings&#44; 
by which I mean romances&#44; novels&#44; and dramas. That some 
are good&#44; others harmless&#44; is not to be denied&#59; but the majority 
of them contain false views of morality &#59; a perverted philoso&#8211; 
phy&#44; and a mawkish sensibility are generally their chief per&#8211; 
vading characteristics &#59; and when&#44; as it is often the case&#44; the 
young mind has not been stored with sound religious know&#8211; 
ledge&#44; this kind of literature destroys almost entirely all sound 
principles&#44; and well nigh may it reduce one to the awful state on 
which the prophet pronounced the curse : &#34; Wo to those who 
say to the good evil&#44; and to the evil good.&#34; It were therefore 
far better&#44; if the whole of such works were banished or set out 
of the reach of the young&#59; but if this cannot be done&#44; at least 
do teach the females&#44; at least prepare them with that kind of 
information&#44; which may act as the antidote to the poison they 
so plentifully imbibe. &#8212; In this manner then let us proceed in 
the education of our children: let religion form the basis both for 
males and females&#44; on which the superstructure of useful and 
ornamental knowledge can then be profitably built &#59; for with&#8211; 
out the former&#44; as has been shown&#44; the latter can never produce 
good and wholesome fruits.

In reply to the other assertion: &#34;That Israelites need not give 
an&#39;especial religious instruction to their children&#44; since morality 
is taught in the churches of other sects&#44; and political rectitude is 
taught in the schools&#44;&#34; we have simply to answer : That much 
good as may be taught in these places&#44; &#40;we would not be 
illiberal enough to deny this&#44;) still much is left untaught which 
to us at least is highly important. The gentile preacher will 
admonish you to be obedient to God&#39;s will and to be pious&#44; 
meek&#44; and patient. But what are the duties he includes in obe&#8211; 
dience &#63; They are few indeed compared to our wants &#59; he will 
not tell you to observe holy the seventh day &#8212; he will not tell 
you to remember the going out of Egypt &#8212; not speak of the 
glorious announcement of the law on this holy festival &#8212; not 
he will inform you how to be holy&#44; as Israel should be holy&#44; to 
the Lord &#8212; not he can teach you to abstain from unlawful 
food &#8212; not he may direct your hopes to a future happy restora&#8211; 
tion &#8212; not he may instruct you&#44; to sum up all in one single 
idea &#8212; not he can instruct you to look up to yon heaven and to 
behold there the workings of one&#44; holy&#44; everlasting&#44; unchangea&#8211; 
ble Being&#59; for to him the Deity is divided&#44; to him the Creator 
is changeable. Even let him feel the beauty and the force of 
the idea of one God&#44; does he not then inculcate that the holy law 
is abolished&#8211;&#44; that the law of Moses&#44; the promulgation of which 
we celebrate this day &#8212; that this law has been annulled &#63; to make 
place for what &#63; For an offspring&#44; a changeling rather&#44; whose 
beauty by no means equals the parent&#39;s lustre &#33; &#8212; But his elo&#8211; 
quence attracts you&#44; the powers of his capacious well&#8211;regulated 
mind make you willing listeners&#59; you go&#44; because his&#44; as you 
say&#44; is the purer morality&#44; divested of doctrinal jargon&#44; free 
from religious prejudice&#44; open alike to all mankind. &#8212; But go 
ye as believers in revelation&#44; or as listeners of an exhibition 
of splendid eloquence &#63; If the latter&#44; well indeed&#44; then admire 
for ever the eloquent fervour&#44; listen to well&#8211;turned phrases&#44; 
shout approbation to morality without religious restraint&#44; with&#8211; 
out doctrines of faith&#44; if such a thing be not an utter fallacy. 
Yet&#44; if you are believers&#44; if you are Israelites&#44; not in words but 
in your inmost hearts&#44; then you cannot be much benefitted by 
such advice &#59; true&#44; it may raise your admiration of God&#39;s 
power &#59; the orator may tell you in the words of the holy Book&#44; 

    <pb n="428"/>

RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. 129 

to adore and to love the Lord&#44; and excite in your mind reli&#8211; 
gious adoration. Still where are the instructions which are to 
be based upon such fervour &#63; Do the preacher&#39;s words teach 
you ought thereof &#63; or rather does he not raise a craving within 
you which he fails&#44; utterly fails&#44; to satisfy &#63; To the house of 
our God then bend your steps&#44; perchance there is one who is 
empowered to scatter the seeds of life&#44; unknown to fame he 
may soever be&#44; not burning eloquence may flow from his lips&#44; 
not the goods of the world may be his portion&#44; perhaps not 
even beloved may he be&#44; because he is too uncomprising&#44; too 
unyielding to the follies of the age : nevertheless he teaches 
what our ancients taught&#44; he promulges the holy Word which 
was announced in times of yore from the blessed Sinai &#59; and 
will you turn to him a deaf ear&#44; which was willingly lent to 
eloquence &#63; will you not bear with him&#44; whilst he points out 
the way you should travel to insure your salvation &#63; I hope 
your hearts&#44; my brethren &#33; may be with him who is one of you&#44; 
one from the same line&#44; from the seed of the house of Jacob &#59; 
and that feeling the necessity of religious instruction it will be 
your endeavour to have always such a teacher&#44; who will fear&#8211; 
lessly speak to you of the deeds you have to do and the way 
you have to walk&#44; instead of resorting to places where with the 
wholesome water inefficient&#44; or noxious drugs even&#44; may per&#8211; 
chance be mixed. 

In reference at last to the assertion : &#34; That political know&#8211; 
ledge can be obtained at schools where worldly sciences are 
taught&#44;&#34; it would be needless&#44; after what has been said already&#44; 
to do more than merely call your attention to the absurdity of 
the position&#44; that political knowledge should efiect the least good 
in reforming individual wickedness&#44; since the whole system is 
based&#44; from its very nature&#44; upon expediency and utility. 

Nothing is left&#44; therefore&#44; to us as Israelites&#44; but to apply 
ourselves&#44; as in olden days&#44; to the study of the law &#59; to engage 
in this pursuit with all the light which modern discoveries in 
science so abundantly furnish&#44; and to do according to the know&#8211; 
ledge we may acquire. &#8212; If it is thus our duty to learn&#44; it is no 
less necessary to teach others what is so beneficial to ourselves&#59; 
and if a parent should unfortunately not be well instructed 
himself&#44; he is bound to seek a teacher who shall supply the 

    <pb n="429"/>

place which he should have occupied. That this is commanded 
in the law&#44; as much as any other religious duty&#44; appears from 
the last commandment which Moses gave before his death : 

&#34; And he said to them : Turn your heart to all the words which I testify 
towards you this day&#44; that you may command them your children&#44; to observe 
to do all the words of this law. For it is not an empty thing for you&#44; but it 
is your life&#44; and through this very thing you will have length of days upon 
the land&#44; which to inherit you are to cross the Jordan.&#34; Deut. xxxii. 46&#8211;47. 

Here we have clearly pointed cfut to us the obligation under 
which every Israelite lies to acquire a sufficient knowledge&#44; be 
it much or be it little&#44; of the laws of our God. Further&#44; it is 
also made a duty to teach the same to our children&#44; that they 
also may learn to observe to do accordingly. For the reason 
given&#44; that it is not a matter of indifference&#44; one to which we 
might attend or not&#44; as our fancy or inclination might dictate &#59; 
but to which we should resort&#44; as the patient snatches with 
eagerness after the medicinal draught which&#44; he believes&#44; has the 
power to stay the outstretched arm of death. Aye&#44; and does 
the sufferer eagerly follow the advice of the fallible earthly 
physician&#44; whose well&#8211;intended medicaments may after all slay 
in place of reviving: how much more should we hasten to re&#8211; 
ceive with eagerness the fruit of life&#44; the certain remedy for 
our fainting soul&#44; which the infallible Physician so graciously 
ofiers and so beneficially bestows&#33; &#8212; This is the herb of life&#44; 
this is the healing balsam which must restore life into decay&#44; 
which must&#44; to use simple language&#44; restore peace into the mind 
where even sin and excesses may for a time have caused peace 
and contentment to fly. &#8212; Let it then be our study to learn our 
duties&#44; and let us also bestow upon our children what we have 
found to be so beneficial in prosperity&#44; and so healing amidst 
tribulations. Then&#44; indeed&#44; may parents rejoice in the number 

    <pb n="430"/>

of their offspring&#44; when they behold them all the children of 
righteousness&#44; true and faithful servants of the Most High. 
Then&#44; indeed&#44; may the female rejoice in her beauty and love&#8211; 
liness&#44; when she is armed against the snares and temptations of 
life. Then can we hail our mothers as our benefactors&#44; our 
fathers as spiritual progenitors&#44; our sisters as our best friends&#44; 
our wives as faithful companions&#44; and our daughters as springs 
of hope for the future. &#8212; The brother too may not then mistrust 
the brother&#44; nor will the son rebel against the father&#44; and the 
husband will be the protector of his wife&#44; and the guardian of 
her innocence and honour. Is this the legitimate effect of a 
religious education &#63; It is &#33; May it then be the will of Heaven 
to make it prosper among us&#44; that all may be true to our Maker&#44; 
and faithful to our God &#33; 

our Father &#33; another festival again has sped along to cause 
us to rejoice in thy goodness&#44; and to bring us to pray in thy 
holy house. Many are the evils. Thou knowest it&#44; Lord &#33; 
under which we labour&#33; In thy indignation&#44; in thy just wrath&#44; 
because of our transgressions. Thou didst call unto the invader&#44; 
who levelled our sanctuary to the ground. Wanderers now we 
are upon the face of thy earth&#44; neither temple to journey there&#8211; 
unto&#44; nor priest have we to make atonement for us. be Thou 
then our sanctuary&#44; be Thou our priest&#44; and receive our offered 
prayers instead of the incense and sacrifice. Enlighten too our 
minds&#44; that we may behold wonders out of thy law&#44; which 
Thou didst proclaim unto our parents on this day of Pentecost&#44; 
the recurrence of which we now celebrate. And may it be 
further thy will to preserve us entire in our captivity&#44; and bless 
those means which thy servants take to cause the spread of a 
knowledge of Thee. And do Thou display over us thy mighty 
arm&#44; and let it be thy will that all nations may be brought to 
see thy glory&#44; and join themselves unto those whom Thou didst 
call thy people&#44; and thy first&#8211;born&#44; and thy treasure. &#8212; grant 
us life&#44; and grant us prosperity&#44; and hasten the approach of thy 
anointed&#44; whom Thou hast promised to redeem us from capti&#8211; 
vity. &#8212; May this be thy will &#33; Amen.

DISCOURSE XL. 

THE TRANSGRESSION OP ISRAEL. 

Lord of the universe&#44; listen to our prayer when we call on 
Thee&#44; and grant us the favour of thy countenance on the day 
on which we approach to seek thy protection &#33; And 0&#44; cast 
us not oif entirely from before Thee&#44; although we have trans&#8211; 
gressed&#44; we and our fathers&#33; And if we have sinned as mortals&#44; 
if we have lost sight of thy holy ways as erring sons of the 
earth: do Thou extend thy forgiveness as it becometh thy 
greatness and holiness&#59; for we know Thee as a God who par&#8211; 
donest iniquities&#44; and who long withholdest thy anger&#44; and 
pourest not forth thy wrath over the sinful and wayward child&#33; 
&#8212; May this be thy will&#44; andjmayest Thou ever spare us according 
to thy infinite mercy &#33; Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 
Not only in this age in which our lot is cast&#44; but also in days 
gone by men have been ever prone to follow the path of evil&#44; and 
have foolishly forsaken the law of righteousness to gratify their 
sinful inclinations. And although it must be acknowledged 
that at some periods wickedness does more extensively prevail 
than at others: still it may be maintained&#44; that mankind are 
ever the same with but trifling differences. We therefore oc&#8211; 
casionally witness an entire generation almost leading a life dis&#8211; 
pleasing to Heaven&#59; and then again when punishment is sent&#44; 
they turn and seek the Lord&#44; and forsake the evil of their ways. 
The philanthropist and the adorer of his God&#44; need therefore 
never despair of a regeneration of their fellow beings&#59; for even 
though all appear to be sinning&#44; there always will be those 
who will never swerve from the service of the Creator&#44; through 
whom the others will again be led to a knowledge of the way 
of truth. But also universal virtue has at no time prevailed &#59; 
and after centuries of adherence to religion&#44; the march of 
wickedness has often marred the beautiful structure of holiness 
and spread desolation over the fields&#44; towns and temples upheld

only by virtue&#44; piety and devotion. All this has been abun&#8211; 
dantly verified by the history of our people. There had been 
times&#44; during the continuance of the Hebrew commonwealth&#44; 
when virtue was loved&#44; when the law of God was honoured&#44; 
and when the throng of worshippers crowded the temple at 
Jerusalem. But through the folly of rulers and people a change 
had come by degrees over the fair scene&#59; and in place of virtue&#44; 
murder and incest were committed&#59; in place of the law of God&#44; 
heathen rites were honoured&#59; and instead of crowds at Jeru&#8211; 
salem&#44; the temples of the numberless idols of Judah received 
the thoughtless multitude. Thus was the people circumstanced&#44; 
which had once been chosen as a peculiar treasure of righteous&#8211; 
ness and sanctity&#44; and thus far had the Israelites sunk from 
their high estate. But still they vainly imagined themselves 
free from guilt&#44; and they did not in their obduracy look upon 
their mischievous conduct as blameable. At such doinss the 
indignation of God was kindled&#44; and He resolved to let the 
punishment denounced take its natural course&#44; that it might be 
accomplished what had been foretold&#44; that the Israelites should 
be cast out from their delightful land&#44; if they at any time were 
to disobey those precepts&#44; through the observance of which 
alone they could lay claim to the lovely inheritance. Now&#44; 
though the conditions had been clearly proposed&#44; and there 
could be no possible doubt as to their meaning and bearing: 
still the merciful One delayed his just indignation&#44; and sent his 
servants the prophets to warn the apostate race of the danger 
they were voluntarily incurring by the course they Vv&#39;ere pur&#8211; 
suing. Our people had in form.er times seen and felt how great 
was the difference between following the will of God and dis&#8211; 
obedience to his precepts. Moreover they had before them 
the holy law which denounced awful visitation as a natural 
consequence of leaving the path of right. Still&#44; as the threat: 
&#34; And you shall be speedily lost from off the good land which 
the Lord gives to you&#44;&#34; had remained hitherto unfulfilled&#44; al&#8211; 
though they defiled their lovely country by their abominations 
and their idolatry: our ancestors possibly imagined&#44; that the 
other punishments&#44; short of this&#44; were events&#44; in the ordinary 
course of nature&#44; to which all nations&#44; whether Israelites or 
not&#44; are alike subject. But they heeded not&#44; that in all occur&#8211;

rences of life it is the superintending Providence that rules&#44; and 
thatnothing&#44; evenif it be only a daily adventure&#44; issent without a 
high object from the Source of all. They thus continued to sin&#44; 
till even the house of God witnessed in its sacred precincts the 
murder of the priest and the prophet &#8212; as though the evil day 
would never reach them. blind delusion &#33; short&#8211;sighted 
sinfulness &#33; does the Almighty not see&#44; because his arrows do 
not fly instantaneously &#63; does the Judge of all slumber&#44; because 
sudden destruction overtakes not the transgressor &#63; and cannot 
the Omnipotent repay iniquity to its perpetrator&#44; solely because 
He mercifully delays the punishment &#63; &#8212; Most truly&#44; 0&#44; our 
God&#44; have we experienced&#44; that although Thou art slow of 
anger&#44; thy punishment strikes home&#44; and thy arrows sink deep 
into the sinful heart&#44; and that thy vengeance is only retarded&#44; 
not withheld. Yet&#44; though so great were our misdeeds&#44; our 
heavenly Father let the merited retribution take place by de&#8211; 
grees: first&#44; a part of the kingdom of Israel was overrun by 
one Assyrian king&#44; and then the remainder were led away by 
his successor. In this manner was fulfilled in part the denun&#8211; 
ciations of Moses&#44; which had been confirmed by a constant suc&#8211; 
cession of inspired men&#44; one of whom predicted &#40;1 Kings&#44; xiv. 
15): &#34; And the Lord will smite Israel&#44; like the reed bends in the 
water&#44; and He will expel Israel from off this good land&#44; which 
He has given to their fathers&#44; and scatter them on the other side 
of the river&#44; because they have made their idol&#8211;groves&#44; incen&#8211; 
sing the Lord.&#34; Although the curse had been thus partially ful&#8211; 
filled&#44; the men of Judah&#44; it is possible&#44; did not altogether grieve 
for the downfal of the rival kingdom&#44; with which they had waged 
many bitter and bloody wars. Perhaps also they fancied themselves 
&#34;secure&#44; because they had within their boundaries the holy temple 
which God had chosen as the residence of his holy name. Per&#8211; 
haps too they did not conceive their transgressions to be quite 
so heinous as those of the Israelites&#44; because they had occasion&#8211; 
ally repented&#44; which the latter had never done. Thus they 
lulled themselves into a fatal security&#44; and the amount of their 
iniquities was fearfully swelled&#44; till they too were ripening 
fast for destruction. &#8212; Again the spirit was poured forth&#44; and 
men arose who yet shake the world by their fervour and 
eloquence. They went out with the word of life on their lips&#44; 

    <pb n="434"/>

and whilst announcing the impending evil&#44; they intreated their 
brothers to avert it by a speedy return to righteousness. &#8212; But 
they addressed deaf ears&#44; their words fell like seed upon an un&#8211; 
fruitful soil&#44; upon unwilling hearts &#59; and it therefore occurred 
which had been so long foretold&#44; and down fell the glory of 
our nation&#44; the crown of our head was hurled to the ground&#44; 
and the bright gems were dimmed&#44; and the pure gold was 
tarnished&#59; &#8212; our temple was burned&#44; our holy city rendered the 
abode of the wild beasts of the desert&#44; and our nation scattered 
to the four corners of heaven&#44; so that years rolled over our de&#8211; 
vastated land&#44; during which not the foot of man nor of cattle 
trod its desolate soil. &#8212; Long is the time since this calamity 
befel us&#44; centuries have sped along in their unceasing course&#44; 
and nations have sprung up and nations have passed away: and 
nevertheless we are yet left to mourn for the bereavement we 
then suffered&#44; for never have we again risen to our pristine 
greatness&#59; and though undcstroyed&#44; because indestructable&#44; 
our glory and our power have at no time since attained any 
considerable eminence. Still we are the same that we have 
been in old times&#44; the descendants of the same illustrious race&#44; 
and the inheritance of the most favoured and most pious and 
most devoted of men is yet in our possession&#59; for the books of 
the holy inspirations&#44; which tell us of the outpourings of the 
spirit which God graciously revealed to Adam&#39;s sinful progeny&#44; 
have not perished amidst the troubles and afflictions which 
befel us. As has been said already&#44; the Israelites fancied that 
they were secured from the evils which had been predicted&#44; 
and conseOjUentl)&#8211; the banishment which had overtaken one 
portion of the people was not regarded as a warning by the 
other&#44; and they therefore sinned&#44; as though the dreaded future 
would never arrive. But all the while their evil day was 
drawing nigh&#44; and the enemies of our race were already buckling 
on their armour for the deadly conflict against the far&#8211;famed 
Jerusalem. And this period so pregnant with wo was chosen 
by God to send another of those devoted messengers&#44; who&#44; 
among the prophets that had been deputed&#44; was one of the 
greatest&#44; and one that was indeed the man of sorrow &#59; who&#44; 
during his mission&#44; and after the event had so dreadfully veri&#8211; 
fied the truth of the words he had spoken&#44; suffered many and

various mishaps&#44; in the persecutions he encountered&#44; and the 
evils he witnessed as befalling his beloved nation&#44; the holy 
city&#44; and the sacred temple. This man was Jeremiah&#44; and he 
was told to go and to warn the people of the impending storm&#44; 
that by repentance they might haply escape its outbreak. In 
the opening of the book of his prophecies we are presented 
with a succinct account of his appointment to the sacred 
calling of prophet&#44; to which dignity he was raised whilst yet 
very young. He at first hesitated to accept the holy trust&#44; but 
he was told : &#34; Not to say : I am young&#44; for to whithersoever 
I send thee thou shalt go&#44; and whichsoever I command thee 
thou shalt speak&#59; be not afraid of them&#44; for I am with thee to 
save thee&#44; says the Lord.&#34; From this we are to learn&#44; that it 
matters not what age the teachei&#8211; may be&#44; but&#44; however young 
or otherwise unimportant&#44; the word of salvation must be re&#8211; 
ceived with becoming deference from his mouth &#59; for it is not 
the man nor his glorification which is the object in view&#44; but 
the end is the spread of righteousness&#44; and the effect is the 
sanctification of the Creator of the universe&#44; and this can be at&#8211; 
tained by the instrumentality of any one whom He&#44; who thrones 
above&#44; may select in his wisdom. &#8212; Jeremiah no longer refused 
to go forth&#44; and&#44; accepting the trust together with its dangers 
&#40;for then&#44; as now&#44; the adnionisher of the people on account of 
their wrongs and backslidings was not beloved) he received his 
mission by&#44; to adopt the figurative language of Scripture&#44; a 
touch from the Supreme Hand on his lips&#44; or&#44; in other words&#44; by 
the infusion in him of an accession of wisdom&#44; of knowledge&#44; and 
of a higher moral courage&#59; and the Lord said to him &#39;&#39; Behold&#44; I 
have given my words in thy mouth.&#34; Nextinorder follow several 
visions which Jeremiah saw&#44; which as prophet he had to tell 
as a part of his mission to the people&#44; and were intended to 
impress on their minds the intention of God to cause the threat&#8211; 
ened evil soon to come over them. They had thought them&#8211; 
selves safe&#59; but now it was announced that the evil was hastening 
to overwhelm them. God also showed to Jeremiah the northern 
hordes&#44; who would sweep over the plains and mountains and 
bring destruction even to the gates of Jerusalem itself &#8212; Jerusa&#8211; 
lem which then was thought too strong and too impregnable 
to fear the approach even of the foeman. &#8212; Having announced to 

    <pb n="436"/>

THE TRANSGRESSION OF ISRAEL. 137 

the people what punishment was in store for them&#44; he tells them&#44; 
how much satisfaction God had received from their former love&#44; 
when they went after Him confidingly&#44; like the youthful bride 
follows the chosen of her heart&#44; unto the desert&#44; to receive 
there the confirmation of the holy espousals &#8212; the law which 
was proclaimed from Sinai. &#8212; But now&#44; continues the prophet&#44; 
speaking in the name and the person of the Deity: &#39;&#34;&#39;Hear ye 
the word of the Lord&#44; house of Jacob&#44; and all ye families of 
the house of Israel. Thus says the Lord&#44; what evil have your 
ancestors found in me&#44; that they have distanced themselves 
from me&#44; and that they went after vanities and became vain &#63;&#34; 
&#63;Iere we have the folly and wickedness of the transgressors 
among our people placed in a strong light before us. First&#44; we 
are told how much was regarded the filial devotion&#44; and how 
everlastingly would be remembered the submission to God&#39;s 
guidance. But now look upon the contrast: the very nation 
that had obtained Heaven&#39;s favour in so singular a manner&#44; is 
the very one that forsakes Him withoat any cause &#59; the very 
one that seeketh vanity&#44; where the opposite reality is so great&#44; so 
palpable&#44; so powerful&#44; so wise&#44; so good &#33; Could they allege&#44; that 
God was not so great as formerly&#63; or does perhaps the sinner of 
our own day imagine&#44; that the power of the Lord is lessened&#63; 
when they must have known&#44; and when we daily experience&#44; that 
He is ever the same&#44; and that his is the everlasting majesty &#33; 
Could they aver&#44; that the Lord spoke no more from Sinai &#63; 
or will the transgressors of our time say&#44; that the divine legis&#8211; 
lation has not been renewed before their own eyes &#63; can this be 
an excuse for trespassing and sin &#63; &#8212; But are not the effects of 
divine omnipotence daily manifested around us&#63; is perhaps the 
light of the sun ever in aught diminished&#63; do the stars now 
shine with less than their wonted splendour&#63; is the blue of 
heaven less intense and less beautiful&#63; does not the nourishing 
earth still yield her manifold productions&#63; do not the seasons 
roll on thus far in unending&#44; unchanging&#44; and unvarying suc&#8211; 
cession&#63; &#8212; And &#33; are not the wonders of revelation the 
same they were on the first day of their announcement&#63; can&#44; 
therefore&#44; any one seriously say&#44; that God is less manifest now 
than formerly&#63; &#8212; And say you his power is lessened&#63; when it 
is nowise diminished by age and care&#44; when in Him succeeding

ages have not discovered aught of decay&#44; of uncertainty of 
purpose&#44; of a lack of energy&#59; when all with Him is as from 
the beginning&#44; when He is unending in power and unlimited in 
might&#33; &#8212; And He who is old of days and unchanging in pur&#8211; 
pose is no less wise than powerful&#44; and since his acting vigour 
is unimpaired&#44; the knowledge which is his&#44; the wisdom which 
is himself&#44; is also left unchanged &#59; and doubt you it&#44; when you 
see that daily new wisdom is brought to light&#63; and say you&#44; it 
is the inventive faculty of man which produces these wonders&#33; 
but whence does wisdom come to man &#63; say&#44; who is it that 
causes his mind to swell with intelligence&#44; unless it be He&#44; who 
teaches man understanding&#63; &#8212; Sinners&#44; perhaps say&#44; God is no 
longer so kind as formerly He was wont to be &#59; He beheld the 
suffering of our ancestors in Egypt&#44; and He saved them &#59; but 
where now are his mercies of which our fathers have spoken &#63; 
But consider a moment and reflect what blessings we&#44; though 
unworthy&#44; daily receive&#44; and we will cease to complain &#59; true&#44; 
we linger in captivity&#44; as also did a portion of Israel at the 
time of Jeremiah &#59; but then are not our sins and our ancestors&#39; 
sins the division between our God and ourselves&#63; where is the 
repentance&#44; the return to righteousness&#44; which has been asked 
at our hands&#63; when did we ever return to the Lord in sincerity 
and truth&#63; &#8212; Oh no. He is always the same&#44; ever great&#44; ever 
manifest&#44; ever powerful&#44; ever wise&#44; ever good &#59; but we do as 
the prophet says : &#34; And when I brought you into the land of 
Carmel to eat of the fruits and good products&#44; you came and 
made unclean my land&#44; and my inheritance ye rendered an 
abomination. The priests said not. Where is the Lord&#59; those 
that laid hold of the law did not know me&#59; the shepherds 
rebelled against me&#59; and the prophets prophesied by Baal&#59; and 
after that which cannot help they went.&#34; Is this not true&#44; aye&#44; 
even to this very day&#44; of many of us&#44; I fear to say&#44; of most 
of us&#63; is there not&#44; therefore&#44; cause enough for the anger of 
God which was once poured out to continue its action on us&#44; 
or as the Bible says : &#34; Therefore&#44; yet will I strive with you&#44; 
says the Lord&#44; and with the children of your children will I 
strive&#63;&#39;&#39; Yes&#44; we alone are the cause that God&#39;s favour is not 
bestowed on us&#44; we are indeed the obstinate&#44; obdurate genera&#8211; 
tion&#44; whose eyes are blinded to the effects of our misdeeds &#59; we

sin&#44; and then arraign the Supreme&#39;s goodness for applying the 
merited chastisement. &#8212; And if this was true in Jeremiah&#39;s 
time&#44; it is not the less so at this very hour. How little regard 
is paid to the dictates of the law &#33; every one&#44; alas&#33; forms a code 
for himself&#44; he does&#44; as it were&#44; set up an idol of his own&#44; to 
which he pays his homage. One worships his money&#44; and to 
it he sacrifices the eternal repose of his neglected soul. To 
him no Sabbath bids the weekly rest to come&#59; to him no holy&#8211; 
days of the Lord are days of rejoicing &#59; the season of atone&#8211; 
ment for sins is to him like all others&#44; a season for the pursuit 
of vile lucre&#59; and often honesty and probity are made cloaks&#44; 
only assumed to hide his turpitude which the laws of the land 
would signally punish&#44; if his real acts were discovered. An&#8211; 
other is a sensualist&#44; and what are to him the precepts which 
inculcate holiness and chastity&#63; even into the house of God he 
goes benumbed by the intoxicating drink which he loves &#59; even 
in midnight hours he seeks to gratify his lust&#44; and for the sake 
of pleasing his palate he will devour whatever the law of God 
has interdicted to us. &#8212; Again&#44; one is ambitious of rising to dis&#8211; 
tinction in a world which loves not Israel and their institutions&#59; 
at least he fancies so &#59; and behold his twistino&#8211; and turninir to 
assimilate himself to the world at large &#59; see what pains he 
takes to convince others&#44; perhaps himself&#44; that the name of 
Jew is hateful to him &#59; see how eagerly he catches at the small 
favours which the gentiles are graciously pleased to give to him&#44; 
like the thankful dog that licks his master&#39;s hand for a useless 
bone or a wasted crum&#44; thrown into his expectant&#44; hungry 
mouth : and straightway this would&#8211;be&#8211;great one withholds 
circumcision from his sons&#59; induces his daughters&#44; under fo&#8211; 
reign guidance&#44; into the mysteries of a divided deity&#59; he pro&#8211; 
claims his regret that he was born a Jew&#44; if his birth is known&#44; 
and if not&#44; he carefully conceals his origin&#44; and at length&#44; to 
use again the Scripture words : &#34;And they mingled among the 
nations and they learned of their ways &#59;&#34; or he&#44; perhaps&#44; altoge&#8211; 
ther forsakes the hopes of his infancy and the trust of his 
maturer years&#44; and he renounces&#44; horrible thought &#33; his 
hopes in heaven and his belief in the all&#8211;wise&#44; true and only 
ONE God and everlasting Creator&#44; and he sells his soul to dam&#8211; 
nation&#44; and his name for a curse and a by&#8211;word for the purpose

of obtaining worldly fame&#44; for a renown which when obtained 
is not worth the possession&#44; and may prove a burden and a 
hindrance to him&#44; even before his days are closed on earth&#33; &#8212; 
And&#44; says the prophet concerning conduct similar to that just 
exhibited : 

&#34; Be astounded at this ye heavens&#44; and shudder &#33; they are very much cor&#8211; 
rupted&#44; says the Lord. For two evils my people have done &#59; me they have 
forsaken&#44; the spring of living waters&#44; to hew themselves cisterns&#44; cisterns 
that are broken&#44; which cannot hold the water.&#34; Jeremiah&#44; ii. 12&#8211;13. 

This was spoken but a short time&#44; not fifty years&#44; before the 
destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar. The people in&#8211; 
deed had become very corrupt &#59; gross idolatry was the disgrace 
of our people&#59; on every hill&#44; under every green tree idols were 
seen&#44; to which they senselessly offered adoration &#59; but though 
their folly was proved to them&#44; they still continued to defile 
themselves&#44; nothing heeding the voice which so feelingly called 
to them to consider the folly of their way&#44; in &#34; saying to the 
wood&#44; thou art my father&#44; and to the stone&#44; thou hast born us.&#34; 
But&#44; alas&#33; the messengers of God remained unheeded&#44; their 
advice was listened to only to be contemned &#59; for at that time 
already there were not wanting those who looked upon the 
really wise&#44; the servants of God&#44; as fanatics and bigots. But 
at length the evil&#44; the advent of which was not believed&#44; came 
and swept away wall and temple&#44; city and people&#44; priests and 
judges&#59; and then was seen the slaughter of the mother upon 
her babes&#44; and of the father upon his children&#44; and together lay 
slain the teacher with his scholars&#44; and the bride and the bride&#8211; 
groom &#59; and there arose the shouts of assailants and the groans 
of the vanquished&#44; and in the prostrate ruins of God&#39;s house 
were heard the hated voice of the triumph of the adversary&#44; as 
he strode conquering and rejoicing over the desolation which 
his arms had been permitted to achieve. &#8212; Hah &#33; dreadful in&#8211; 
deed was that day&#44; when the glory of Israel sunk&#44; when the 

    <pb n="440"/>

THE TRANSGRESSION OF ISRAEL. 141 

sun of our prosperity set in a sea of blood. &#8212; True&#44; the temple 
was once more rebuilt&#44; and again a remnant was permitted to 
reoccupy the sacred soil &#59; but a second time also&#44; the terrible 
scenes were re&#8211;enacted with more heightened effect&#44; and the 
slaughter was ten&#8211;fold increased under the command of the Roman 
Vespasian and his son Titus&#44; since when we have been wan&#8211; 
derers&#44; and an easy and ready prey to any one who chose to 
persecute us. &#8212; All this was caused by our sins&#44; because we 
would not listen to the warning voice of instruction&#44; which 
would fain have arrested our steps on the road of ruin. Our 
ancestors&#44; however&#44; were obdurate&#44; and our present state is an 
evidence of their folly and wickedness. 

It is now the period in which the calamitous subversion of 
our state twice occurred&#59; let it act as a wholesome check to 
our own obduracy&#44; and let us reflect&#44; that we too are sinning&#44; 
and hewing out for ourselves cisterns which will not hold the 
living waters. Aye&#44; heap up wealth in masses&#44; avaricious one&#59; 
still thou hast not laid up imperishable treasures &#59; thy cistern is 
a broken cistern&#44; and not a drop of the water of life will remain 
in it&#44; unless the breach is healed by a recourse to the holy law. 
Sensual one&#44; weenest thou that thy tasting of all pleasures will 
avail thee aught at the final day of judgment &#63; sinful man&#33; no&#44; 
thy birthright thou hast sold for a mess of pottage&#59; and when 
thy doom is sealed thou wilt thyself acknowledge&#44; that thy 
cistern has been a broken one&#44; and that it held not the living 
waters&#33; &#8212; And thou too&#44; man of ambition&#44; of worldly vain glory&#44; 
seest thou not that thy worship was the worship of a false 
delusive idol&#63; worldly honour thou didst crave&#44; and thou didst 
not hesitate in thereby offending Him who has given thee life 
and wisdom. Go meet&#44; then&#44; thy doom&#44; and teach by thy ex&#8211; 
ample and misery&#44; that those who forsake the Lord and his law 
have hewn themselves broken cisterns which hold not the liv&#8211; 
ing waters. &#8212; Brethren&#33; seed of Jacob&#33; children of Israel&#33; open 
your hearts to the instruction which God has vouchsafed to you&#59; 
and let it be your endeavour to deserve&#44; by serving Him in 
truth&#44; a return of his favour&#59; and feel and know&#44; that only 
through obedience can we Israelites be happy&#44; and only through 
adherence to the law can we deserve God&#39;s kindness and pro&#8211; 
tection.

Thou&#44; who art ever the Guardian of Israel&#44; shield us by 
thy protecting wings&#44; and watch over us lest the nations swal&#8211; 
low us up in their wrath. We know that we have sinned&#44; but 
do Thou&#44; merciful God&#44; prove to us thy superabundant kind&#8211; 
ness&#44; and judge us not according to our misdeeds&#44; but according 
to thy mercy which is unending. And may it be thy will to 
revisit our captivity&#44; and number us like the shepherd numbers 
his flock&#44; that not one of them may escape his tender care&#44; and 
lift up thy hand a second time to restore the remnant of the 
flock which has escaped to thy holy mountain&#44; there to worship 
Thee for ever. Amen&#33;

DISCOURSE XLI. 

THE INSTITUTION OP PRAYER. 

OUR God and Father hearken to our prayers and listen to 
the supplications which we pour out before Thee. And grant 
us thy forgiveness on that fearful day which Thou hast appointed 
as the time of judgment for thy creatures&#59; and when Thou siftest 
our deeds and probest our transgressions&#44; mayest Thou say: &#34;I 
will redeem them from going to destruction&#44; I have found a 
redemption.&#34; May this be thy will. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 
The season has again arrived when the descendants of Israel&#44; 
who have but a spark of the holy fire left unquenched within 
their bosoms&#44; will hasten to the house of prayer to offer up their 
devotion to their God. And sweet indeed is the incense thus 
sacrificed on the altars of our Father&#44; and truly grateful in the 
Supreme Presence is the odour of such offerings&#59; for the humble 

    <pb n="442"/>

THE INSTITUTION OF PRAYER. 143 

outpourings of the heart that knows its weakness will never be 
despised by the Disposer of human destinies. But prayer to be 
acceptable&#44; to be a truly agreeable offering&#44; should be prompted by 
holy feelings&#44; and be based upon a knowledge of our unworthi&#8211; 
ness and the acknowledgment of the evil of our ways. Many 
a one may enter these walls&#44; many a one may utter his orisons&#44; 
but his heart may be far away&#44; wandering after his worldly 
pursuits&#44; and whilst his lips are praying&#44; his thoughts may be 
engaged in speculating on objects of pecuniary gain and inter&#8211; 
ested in matters far from appertaining to the worship of God. 
Many persons praying&#44; or rather assembling under such disad&#8211; 
vantageous and ungodly circumstances&#44; there actually are&#44; and 
it is therefore necessary that we should endeavour to find out 
the proper feelings which ought to accompany us to the house 
of God. To come to a correct understanding on this point&#44; we 
must consider : first&#44; to whom we pray &#59; secondly&#44; for what 
cause we pray&#44; and lastly&#44; what is to be effected by our prayers. 
Well has one of our wise men said: 
&#34; Know before whom thou art standing.&#34; In this simple sen&#8211; 
tence we are reminded&#44; that our Hearer is not an ignorant man 
who understands not our words&#44; who knows not our wants: 
not a wise man who may be deceived by our superior cunning&#44; 
or circumvented by our appearance&#59; not even a mighty&#39; poten&#8211; 
tate who may not be able by the insufficiency of his power to 
grant all our requests: but it is our God&#44; who fully comprehends 
our words&#44; and is acquainted with our Avants&#44; aye&#44; even before 
our lips give utterance to them&#59; He is also wise&#44; it is beyond our 
cunning to deceive Him&#44; and no assumed appearance&#44; however 
ingeniously contrived&#44; can impose on his credulity&#44; for to Him 
who is all&#8211;seeing the inmost recesses of thought are laid open&#44; 
and He knows the secret motives of the most mysterious action 
perpetrated in the darkest corner&#44; the farthest removed from all 
human ken&#59; and at last his power is unbounded&#44; and we need 
not fear in Him any inadequacy or inability to comply with our 
demands&#44; if they are consonant with our ultimate good&#59; and as 
his power is unlimited by time or circumstances&#44; we need not 
fear that our prayer has not been answered&#44; because our request 
is not immediately granted&#44; for since God is not less good than 
wise and powerful&#44; we should consider that our petition may be 

    <pb n="443"/>

144 THE INSTITUTION OF PRAYER. 

granted at a period remote from the present&#44; when it may 
redound more to our advantage and the repose of our soul. If 
now we come to pay our adorations&#44; it is obviously our first 
duty to remove all deceit and duplicity from our heart&#59; to 
endeavour to be fully impressed with the conviction&#44; that 
nothing but undivided sincerity will avail us&#44; since by no possi&#8211; 
bility can we hope to deceive. Secondly&#44; to come with humble 
confidence with our Father&#44; and not be deterred by the magni&#8211; 
tude of our wants&#44; nor by the unworthiness of ourselves&#44; from 
laying our desires open to Him. And lastly&#44; to wait with 
becoming hope and resignation the fulfilment of our petition&#44; 
not to be depressed at finding ourselves rejected for a brief 
space&#59; nor to be elated with pride when we witness the accom&#8211; 
plishment of our wishes&#59; nor may we be looking upon our&#8211; 
selves as righteous beyond our neighbours&#44; because our prayer 
has been answered. But we should consider that if our wishes 
are not done&#44; that perhaps we in our ignorance have desired that 
which&#44; if granted&#44; would be hurtful to us&#44; and that perhaps our 
previous sins have deprived us of the asked advantage. In either 
of these cases&#44; we should endeavour to amend our course and 
watch our own feelings narrowly to seek out the error which will 
at length&#44; upon an honest investigation&#44; be discovered in our&#8211; 
selves. In cage&#44; however&#44; that our petition is granted&#44; it would 
be ridiculous in the extreme&#44; if&#44; because God has been kind and 
merciful to us&#44; we should therefore wax proud in our hearts and 
look upon others with contempt&#59; since this indeed would at 
once prove that we are absolutely unworthy of the favour of 
God&#59; for&#44; if we fairly examine our course of life&#44; and reflect 
how often we have vexed God by our sinfulness&#44; and how often 
we have been remiss or lukewarm in the practice of the right&#8211; 
eousness demanded at our hands: we will surely have no cause 
to elevate ourselves above our neighbours&#44; who&#44; if even acknow&#8211; 
ledgedly more wicked than we&#44; may not have had the oppor&#8211; 
tunities for improvement nor the benefits of a holy example 
which to enjoy may have been our happy lot. 

Whenever then we go to pour out our heart in prayer&#44; it 
should be done with a sincere confidence on the unlimited 
bounty of God&#44; and with a firm reliance that whatever He may 
vouchsafe to decree that alone is the best and most conducive 

    <pb n="444"/>

THE INSTITUTION OF PRAYER. 145 

to our own welfare and the happiness of others. And in this 
spirit our wise men relate&#44; that the high priest during his 
annual officiating in the holy of holies prayed&#44; that &#34; the peti&#8211; 
tion of wayfarers may not be listened to&#44; to stay the blessing of 
the descending rain when the world is in need thereof&#44;&#34; for 
to grant the request of such an individual thus praying would 
be to the detriment and injury of the many. It is therefore 
not acting in the spirit of becoming deference&#44; if the petitioner 
comes to the throne of Grace with a long recital of his own 
merits &#59; for let a man observe ever so many Sabbaths&#44; let his 
charity be ever so unbounded&#44; let his philanthropy indeed 
cheer up the countenance of all that suffer : still all these vir&#8211; 
tues and many others superadded cannot&#44; should not&#44; make an 
erring mortal think&#44; that now his claims to divine grace are 
established on so firm a footing&#44; that he may ask in a tone of 
authority or appeal with a confidence of assured success. If 
one prays in such a spirit of arrogance&#44; he deserves not that He 
that answereth prayers should vouchsafe to him his request&#44; 
since the first requisite towards obtaining grace&#44; humility and 
devotion&#44; are supplanted by pride and arrogance. And in this&#44; 
as in many other points&#44; we have a beautiful example of piety 
set us by our great teacher&#44; who was indeed the shining light 
and the guiding star sent to lead a newly redeemed people to a 
happiness which should not be merely temporal and confined 
to one spot&#44; but lasting and universal &#59; and thus though the 
land of Palestine&#44; our temporal inheritance&#44; has been rendered 
desolate&#44; though Jerusalem our holy city is now surrounded 
with wastes and ruins : yet the law is not wrested from us&#44; 
and the examples of holiness and piety it contains flow indeed 
into our souls to refresh and invigorate them&#44; like the meadow 
stream which meanders along through grassy banks and shady 
groves&#44; fertilizing the soil in its course&#44; which otherwise would 
be barren and dreary. In Moses&#39;s own family there was afflic&#8211; 
tion &#59; his brother and sister&#44; they who had been associated 
with him in the holy work of redeeming their fellow&#8211;believers&#44; 
had sinned against him their brother and teacher&#44; and God&#44; 
incensed at their misconduct&#44; and ever acting up to that great 
principle&#44; that the greater the piety of an individual the 
more strictly will also be the retribution&#44; punished Miriam 
VOL. ir. &#8212; 13

with leprosy&#44; that loathsome disease&#44; which caused the infected 
to be removed out of the community of Israel and compelled 
them to live in solitude. Seeing his sister&#39;s affliction&#44; Moses 
did not remind God of the many acts of devotion&#44; not of the 
many good works wrought by him &#59; but he called simply in the 
most humble and confiding manner on the Healer of the sick 
to grant her relief&#44; saying : &#34; God&#44; I pray thee&#44; do thou heal 
her.&#34; You will observe&#44; brethren&#44; that these few words&#44; 
including every thing which was needed&#44; presented without 
parade or ostentation&#44; were graciously received&#44; and the leper 
was healed after a probation of seven days had elapsed. An 
example from so high a source should not be without its effect 
upon us&#44; and as Moses did&#44; so should we also do &#59; in whatever 
trouble and sorrow we may be plunged&#44; whatever joy may 
elevate our hearts&#44; we should resort in all humility&#44; free from 
pride and arrogance&#44; either to lay our wants in sincerity before 
God&#44; or to offer Him our thanks with heartfelt gratitude. And 
if we come in this manner&#44; as children that come before their 
father&#44; we need not tremble at the immeasurable distance 
which divides us from the Most High &#59; we need not then be 
struck with fear&#44; because we are sinful and He is great &#59; but we 
may be comforted with the assurance that our offering will be 
received and our supplication listened to with favour&#44; for He 
the Ruler and Preserver of all things feels for&#44; and cares for&#44; 
all his creatures&#44; from the greatest to the lowest. 

Next let us consider the second question proposed : &#34; For 
what cause shall we pray &#63;&#34; It must be evident to every one 
gifted with common sense&#44; that there are many circumstances 
and occurrences in life&#44; where all human agency is incapable 
of rendering us the least service. There are moments&#44; when 
the heart is full to overflowing with joy or with sorrow&#44; when 
we are in danger&#44; either of being corrupted by pride or of 
sinking into the slough of despair. Aye&#44; there are seasons&#44; when 
we would shun to confide to any human ear what lays heavily 
on our mind&#44; when we are disgusted&#44; satiated with things of 
evanescent life&#44; when we are wearied with the same dull round 
of care and labour which constantly oppresses us&#44; and when 
the sight of a fellow&#8211;mortal becomes almost loathing&#44; and when 
the words of encouragement&#44; of censure&#44; or of praise will fall 

    <pb n="446"/>

THE INSTITUTION OF PRAYER. 147 

on our ears like the rattling of the bones of some suspended 
malefactor&#44; hateful beyond endurance. Again there are times&#44; 
when we are forsaken by all the world&#44; when for foul suspicion 
we are cast into a dungeon&#44; exposed to a public trial&#44; condemned 
to an ignominious punishment&#44; and left to pine in solitude&#44; 
vainly recurring to our former life&#44; and regretting too late that 
we gave way to temptations&#44; when an opposite course might 
have given us comfort and prosperity. &#8212; The child too may fol&#8211; 
low to the tomb the remains of his last beloved parent&#59; the 
father may weep over the early bier of his only offspring&#44; 
and the husband may mourn over the grave of the dearly&#8211; 
beloved and early&#8211;called wife of his bosom : who is there that 
can speak consolation to them &#8212; what on earth is there to bid 
their hearts rejoice&#44; they&#44; to whom all around is gloom and 
despair &#63; And even heap riches up for either: and the son will 
tell you that yonder grave hides the guide of his youth&#44; the 
friend of his infancy&#44; and the author of his existence. And the 
father&#39;s only hope&#44; the stay of his old age&#44; is closed up in the 
cold earth&#44; and he heeds not the world&#39;s greatness because he 
is no more &#33; &#8212; The husband has lost her&#44; who was to him dearer 
than life&#44; the mother of his children&#44; the partner of his joys and 
of his sorrows&#44; her with whom he vainly hoped to pass down the 
vale of life in harmony and concert&#59; and her&#44; the life of his 
life&#44; death has snatched from him in the bloom of youth and 
usefulness. &#8212; In all such instances it should be our duty to 
resort to prayer&#44; either to unburthen ourselves of the load 
which oppresses us in the presence of Him&#44; who can alone 
remove the weight&#44; or to give vent to our surcharged feelings 
and ask consolation and assistance of the Lord of consolations 
and the Saviour of mankind. &#8212; When the measure of thy joy 
has suddenly become filled to excess&#44; when thy giddy brain 
refuses to bear with meekness the exuberance of the blessings 
received&#44; mortal man : hie thee to the house of God&#44; and 
sacrifice there to Ilim thy thanks&#44; and humble thyself at his 
feet&#44; and reflect that He who gave thee joy can take away again 
the gift He has bestowed &#59; and thou wilt return to thy dwelling 
with the peace of God within thee&#44; filled with humility and 
lowliness anent thy perishable greatness&#44; and imbued with love 
and kindness towards all&#44; who like thee are inhabitants of the

mortal clayey dwellings. &#8212; If thou art wearied with the cares of 
life&#44; if the burden of existence has become too heavy for thee: 
seek again relief from thy God. Reflect that it is thy appointed 
lot to earn thy bread with the sweat of thy face&#44; and that thy 
lot is not heavier than that of others since no one&#44; however 
exalted&#44; is free from care and sorrow. And if this reflection 
fails to give thee comfort&#44; then forget all thy dissatisfaction 
and lay open thy heart to thy Maker&#44; ask of Him for strength 
and support : and surely thy prayer will be answered&#44; and thy 
toil will be lightened&#44; and thy burden will be eased &#59; and thou 
wilt again mix with the cheerful groups of associates&#44; and 
smile with the smiling&#44; shed a tear of sympathy with the 
afflicted&#44; feel a new interest in life&#44; and gladly do those duties 
which the station assigned to thee may demand at thy hands. 
Away then will fly the spirit of despondency&#44; and the gloom of 
despair will vanish &#59; and the fields will smile again in verdure 
clad&#44; the blithsome song of the feathered minstrels will again 
sound sweet&#44; the flowers will again send forth their odours&#59; and 
reconciled to thyself and nature&#44; thou wilt thank God&#44; who has 
through darkness led thee to feel the more strongly his love 
and power. 

Thou &#33; who languishest in captivity&#44; imagine not that thy 
hope has fled for ever. No &#8212; sinner though thou art&#44; for&#8211; 
saken though thou deemest thyself&#44; though a prison holds thy 
fettered limbs : there is One above that watches&#44; that cares 
for thee. &#34; He sleepeth not&#44;&#34; says the holy singer&#44; &#34; the guar&#8211; 
dian of Israel&#44;&#34; and He who so bounteously cares foj&#8211; all his 
creatures has not forgotten thee&#44; the captive and forlorn. 
lift but thy obdurate heart to Him &#33; cease but thy vain 
repining&#44; let but a holy hope invigorate thy heart: and instan&#8211; 
taneously will enlargement come to thee even in thy captivity&#59; 
and the sunbeam which lights up thy narrow cell will teach 
thee&#44; that the light of heaven is not yet quenched&#44; that the 
goodness of the Creator is not ended&#44; although thou for thy 
crimes art doomed to suffer. If thus thou thinkest&#44; thy cap&#8211; 
tivity will be a blessing to thee &#59; since it has rescued thee from 
the grasp of sin&#44; and united thee again to thy God and Lord. &#8212; 
And if thou art suffering innocently&#44; if thou languishest for the 
glorification of the holy Name&#44; if heathens in their triumph

punish thee&#44; because thou refusest to join their unhallowed 
rites : then surely thou mayest feel comfort in the know&#8211; 
ledge that the God for whose laws&#39; sake thou sufferest&#44; will 
number thy tears&#44; so that not one of them shall be forgotten&#44; 
and He will treasure them up in his receptacle&#44; and will cleanse 
thy soul&#44; and purify thy heart&#44; till thou at the end of days wilt 
shine forth among the righteous ones&#44; with the effulgence of the 
stars for ever more. 

And thou son &#33; who mournest for thy father &#8212; parent &#33; who 
complainest because thy only one is taken &#8212; husband &#33; who 
bewailest a beloved wife&#44; all ye come hither to the temple of 
our heavenly Father. Ye lament the loss of earthly friends&#44; 
friends deservedly dear&#44; deservedly valued &#59; but reflect who it is 
that decreed their doom &#33; From our constitution&#44; our bodies 
must be given to decay&#44; our flesh must again be changed to the 
dust&#59; &#34; for dust we are and to dust we must return.&#34; Can we 
ward off&#34; the shafts which are constantly flying&#63; Is there not a 
period set to our days &#63; What matters it then&#44; whether a few 
brief years more or less have been assigned to us&#44; provided we 
do our duty as men&#44; and endeavour to deserve the favour of our 
Maker&#63; Since&#44; therefore&#44; death is inevitable&#44; it is necessary 
that friends must always be prepared to meet with becoming 
resignation the day when their connection must be severed for 
a period&#44; a period I say&#44; for a reunion must take place before 
many years have completed their course. Instead therefore of 
lamentations carried to a sinful excess&#44; ye should reflect that 
God took away your relatives&#44; because their task was done &#59; and 
only hope that they now enjoy rest and happiness in the pre&#8211; 
sence of their Maker. And in place of repining&#44; pray fervently 
that strength may be given you that you also may live in piety 
and holiness&#44; so that when your course too is ended&#44; you also 
may meet in yonder life with that beatitude which&#44; it is to be 
hoped&#44; God has already decreed to those who were so dear to 
you. If you act and pray thus&#44; you will be resigned to the 
decrees of Him&#44; all whose ways are just&#44; and you will cease to 
complain of your hard fate&#44; which is at best but the common 
portion of humanity. &#8212; In short&#44; upon every occasion&#44; where we 
may require heavenly counsel or heavenly assistance we should 
resort to prayer&#44; and express fearlessly&#44; with a sincere outpour&#8211; 

13&#42; 

    <pb n="449"/>

150 THE INSTITUTION OF PRAYER. 

ing of the spirit&#44; whatever we stand in need of. This also we 
are taught in the first book of Kings&#44; viii. 38 &#8212; 40: 

&#34; Every prayer and every supplication which any man may make&#44; of all 
thy people Israel&#44; who may know each the affliction of his heart&#44; and spread 
outhis hands to this house &#59; and do Thou hear in heaven&#44; thy dwelling place&#44; 
and forgive&#44; and do to each man according to his ways&#44; in as much as Thou 
knowest his heart&#44; for Thou alone knowest the heart of all the children of 
man. That they may fear Thee all the days which tliey live upon the land&#44; 
which Thou hast given to our fathers.&#34; 

In this beautiful extract from the fervid prayer of Solomon 
at the dedication of the temple we have a brief elucidation of 
the whole object and scope of prayer &#59; for here he lays down 
with the utmost precision&#44; that every man&#44; no matter how 
heavy his guilt or affliction may be&#44; provided the heart be sin&#8211; 
cere&#44; should come and prostrate himself before God&#44; spread out 
his hands as it were towards the temple&#44; and ask for whatever 
his case demands from Him who promised to let his glory 
dwell among us. And even to this day &#34; it is to the East that 
the Hebrew bends&#44;&#34; it is in the direction of that holy temple 
from which our sins have caused us to wander&#44; that we direct 
our face during our prayers&#44; and in this manner we contribute 
to keep alive the sacred flame within our bosom which&#44; yet 
burns with a yearning towards those hallowed fields and those 
venerated shrines from which we have been driven. Let it 
then be our endeavour to call for assistance on Him who is able 
to assist us amidst every danger and to rescue us from all tribu&#8211; 
lations. And every morning too&#44; and when the sun is bending 
his face towards the west&#44; and every evening when the glorious 
light of day has set&#44; and every night before we seek our couch&#44; 

    <pb n="450"/>

let us pour out our orisons to our heavenly Father&#44; and let us at 
every hour&#44; at every period of our life&#44; constantly thank Him 
for the many favours He has so graciously bestowed. 

The third part of our subject : &#34; What is to be effected by 
our prayers &#63;&#34; now demands our consideration. &#8212; Persons may 
ask : &#34; What needs God our prayers&#44; when He is assuredly 
acquainted with our wants before we express them in words &#33;&#34; 
No one more cheerfully acknowledges God&#39;s all pervading 
omniscience than we do &#59; still it must be admitted that prayer 
is necessary&#44; not &#40;as m.ay be erroneously supposed) to inform 
God&#44; but to impress on our oiun mind our dependance&#44; yes our 
entire dependance for every comfort and blessing we enjoy. 
Worldly men are but too apt to think much of their own 
power&#44; as it were their strong arm is enough for them&#44; and 
they accordingly never or but rarely pray&#44; for in effect they 
think themselves placed beyond the necessity of asking assist&#8211; 
ance from God &#59; hence too they are proud&#44; vain&#44; selfish and 
self&#8211;sufficient. But suddenly their evil day comes and their 
riches take unto themselves wings and fly away &#59; the number 
of their children is diminished by death &#59; their intellect is 
reduced to madness&#44; and they present a striking example of 
what man is when God&#39;s protection is withdrawn. But the 
humble and meek&#44; who daily resort to commune with the 
invisible Power that surrounds all&#44; who express in words the 
filial confidence they really feel&#44; are truly&#44; and in every sense 
of the words&#44; removed beyond the chances and changes of life. 
To them&#44; even in misfortunes and sufferings there are peace 
and enjoyment&#44; and the world may exhaust its malice against 
them&#44; without disturbing the sacred trust they feel in Heaven. 
Besides&#44; the Bible does teach us&#44; that God grants the prayers 
of his adorers. Now&#44; though He is not made more conscious 
of our wants than He was before we prayed : still we must look 
upon prayer like upon any other virtuous act&#44; which is to be 
performed&#44; for the sake of making ourselves worthy of the 
favour of God&#44; &#8212; If we go to pray&#44; for any calamity&#44; or in any 
tribulation&#44; or in any impending danger&#44; it is obviously neces&#8211; 
sary that we must look into our own hearts to see if all is right 
there&#44; and we must examine our conduct both past and present 
to observe whether or not sin and corruption lurk there as the

parents of evil. In this manner we take God to witness&#44; so to 
say&#44; that we wish his protection&#44; in lieu of which we prepare 
ourselves to become his servants more intimately than we 
have been hitherto. Now&#44; God does not need our words to 
satisfy Him of our intentions&#44; but we need it &#59; the heart to feel 
truly should clothe its thoughts in words&#44; this makes the im&#8211; 
pression more lasting&#44; it fixes the more strongly the reformation 
that is once begun &#59; and who knows but that the Almighty 
may do according to all that we ask&#44; when He perceives that 
by preparing ourselves truly for prayer we have changed for 
the better&#44; and now abhor the evil which we formerly loved &#63; 
No wonder need therefore be expressed that the Omniscient 
has told his people to pray to Him and to call on his holy 
name &#59; He asks for a devotional spirit&#44; for pure and elevated 
thought&#44; and as a reward for such a petition He promises to 
relent &#40;to use human expressions&#44; since even of the holiest 
things we must speak as men do) from the intended evil &#59; not 
as though He&#44; the unchangeable One&#44; had changed his purpose&#44; 
but because man has himself rescinded the evil&#44; menaced for 
his misconduct&#44; by a change of his deeds&#44; and has thus secured 
a change of fate&#44; a reversion from the curses to the blessings. 
Just as at the making of the golden calf God did not utterly 
destroy the Israelites&#44; because Moses prayed&#44; and because there 
were yet multitudes left who had never swerved from the 
righteous path&#44; and had remained true when many went astray. 
brethren&#44; let this lesson not be lost upon you &#59; return to the 
Lord with prayer like the men of Nineveh&#44; and God may 
revoke the evil&#44; and you may not perish. The season of repent&#8211; 
ance is at hand &#33; soon will the sound of the shophar announce 
in all the assemblies of the remnant of Israel that the New 
Year has arrived&#44; that we have again lived to commence a new 
season from the creation of the world. How many hours of 
anguish have passed over our heads in the year that has passed 
and gone &#59; how many bitter tears have flowed to the memory 
of the departed &#59; how many sighs have been heaved over for&#8211; 
tunes lost&#44; over riches foolishly squandered &#59; how many hours 
of regret have we purchased ourselves by our forgetfulness of 
the Lord&#39;s behests&#44; commanded to our ancestors &#33; And shall 
the season of prayer pass away&#44; and not one of us return to the

bosom of the great Father whom we have fatigued&#44; as the 
prophet says&#44; by our works &#63; shall all the admonitions have 
been vouchsafed&#44; and still our hearts remain obdurate &#63; shall 
the day never come when the sinners will seek again the fold 
from which they have strayed &#63; Let us hope&#44; at least&#44; for better 
things&#44; and let us trust that many will come to join the band of 
brethren who have yet the fear of God in their hearts&#44; and that 
the number of worshippers may be increased thousand&#8211;fold 
who know before whom they pray&#44; who pray to the Lord in 
their affliction&#44; and who are drawn closer to Him every time 
their mouth uttereth the praise of God. Let then all Israel 
listen with fear to the voice of the cornet when it sounds like 
the alarum through the land&#44; let it rouse them to exertion for 
the behalf of their souls &#59; so that&#44; universal piety prevailing&#44; 
we all may live to behold the banner raised on the mountains&#44; 
when the glorious Messiah comes to spread good&#8211;will and 
holiness over the surface of all the earth. 

Hearer of prayer &#33; to Thee all flesh cometh &#33; grant Thou 
our desire&#44; and raise up to us teachers of righteousness in 
whose mouth thy word may dwell&#44; that they may teach thy 
people of thy ways. &#39; Teach them what they shall say&#44; make 
them understand what they shall speak&#44; that they may com&#8211; 
municate to others of thy children the holy love that burns 
within them. And grant to all thy adorers&#44; be they wise or 
foolish&#44; great or humble&#44; thy blessing&#44; and inscribe all within 
the book of life&#44; when Thou approachest to judge the children 
of thy hand. Be this thy will&#44; and may the words of our 
mouth and the thoughts of our hearts&#44; be acceptable before 
Thee&#44; our Rock and Redeemer. Amen.

DISCOURSE XLII. 

CAUSES AND REMEDIES OF SIN. 

Sovereign of the universe&#33; to adore Thee&#44; we thy children 
have assembled to call on Thee&#44; our Father and King. hear 
Thou in Heaven thy dwelling place&#44; and forgive our iniquities&#44; 
as Thou hast pardoned them even from Egypt to this day. 
And if our sins be crying for punishment&#44; remember Thou 
then the words Thou hast spoken through thy messenger : &#34; If 
your sins be like scarlet they shall become white like snow&#44; 
and if they be red like crimson they shall be like wool.&#34; Re&#8211; 
member too that we are mortal&#44; prone&#44; and inclined to sin&#59; and 
if we have given way to temptations&#44; if we have yielded to the 
unholy impulse of our passions : wipe Thou away the stain of 
guilt from our souls&#44; and purify us in thy kindness and in 
mercy&#59; so that we may walk acceptably before Thee and guid&#8211; 
ed by thy wisdom. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 
When we look upon one of the outcasts of human society&#44; 
made outcast by his own folly and crime: we who have not yet 
sunk so far must wonder&#44; how one&#44; who like us bears the im&#8211; 
press of God&#39;s image on his countenance&#44; could become so mi&#8211; 
serably degraded. It is to us incomprehensible&#44; how any one 
can feel the least joy in wallowing drunk in the mire&#59; how any 
one&#44; calling himself the father of a family&#44; could stake his last 
shilling at the gaming table&#59; how the husband could leave his 
chosen wife&#44; the mother of his children&#44; to riot in the embrace 
of a wanton &#59; how any one at all imbued with reason&#44; could 
forswear his God&#44; and doubt in the existence of the Creator. 
In short&#44; the utter degradation by crime&#44; displayed in all its 
horrors before us&#44; is a spectacle not alone revolting&#44; but of 
astonishment also&#59; since with ever so humble an opinion of 
ourselves&#44; with ever so much charity and indulgence towards 

    <pb n="454"/>

CAUSES AND REMEDIES OF SIN. 155 

human failings and frailties&#44; we cannot avoid looking upon our&#8211; 
selves with some satisfaction that we are not degraded like 
those sinners. But whilst we experience this feeling&#44; it should 
be mingled with thankfulness to God&#44; for having preserved us 
from temptations&#44; and given us strength to withstand the allure&#8211; 
ments by which others fell &#59; for though nothing is more esta&#8211; 
blished than that every one must make the beginning to be 
good&#44; still it is equally certain&#44; that divine assistance is afforded 
to whomever makes the beginning&#44; in the words of our sages : 
&#34; He that comes to purify himself 
will be assisted from Heaven.&#34; If we view the grievous sin&#8211; 
ners in this light&#44; our abhorrence for their actions will not be 
coupled with pride&#44; and their fall will in truth be a warning to 
us&#44; that we may avoid sinning as they have done. For when 
we come to look into the history of the persons exhibited 
above&#44; we must be soon convinced that they were born as 
virtuously as we have been&#44; with just the same feelings&#44; pas&#8211; 
sions&#44; and propensities&#44; besides which&#44; it is very often the 
case that their and our education was precisely alike&#44; at least to 
outward appearances. It may also be taken for granted&#44; I 
would almost venture to say as an established maxim in morals&#44; 
that no man becomes suddenly wicked. The question then for 
us to ponder on is : &#34; How have these men become so lost to 
all sense of duty&#63;&#34; There are two ways at least in which the 
mystery can be solved. First&#44; it may be defect in education&#44; 
which in being of the outward kind may leave the heart unim&#8211; 
proved&#44; and expose it thus to be ensnared by the power of sin. 
Let us suppose an example : There was a man&#44; who in his 
childhood was instructed in accomplishment&#44; in arts&#44; and in 
sciences&#44; but the law of God was not impressed on his soul. 
As a boy he was left to his uncontrolled will&#44; and his inclina&#8211; 
tions had not the curb of restraint laid on them. His passions 
showed themselves in petty tyranny over his fellows&#44; but he 
went unwhipped of the rod of a father&#39;s correction. He next 
grew up to manhood&#39;s years &#59; but the homage his talents justly 
received from the world&#44; was by no means calculated to lessen 
the opinion he entertained of his own importance. His arro&#8211; 
gance was even nourished&#44; at seeing others&#44; whom common 
parlance stigmatized as of inferior birth and meaner grade in 

    <pb n="455"/>

life&#44; endeavouring to outstrip or rival him in the path of pre&#8211; 
ferment. Do you think that he could have been left unconta&#8211; 
minated in moral conduct&#44; whilst his moral feelings had become 
gradually vitiated&#63; Is it likely that no crime&#44; however secret 
and well covered&#44; or that no act of disobedience to paternal 
authority and the divine will had been committed&#63; It would 
be over charitable to suppose a favourable reply&#59; but even 
assume that all hitherto had been right within&#44; yet it is certain 
that an outward morality without a holy conviction&#44; and withal 
undermined by pride could be no safeguard against temptation. 
And lol an offence against his dignity was committed&#44; say one 
of his friends or himself should have been publicly insulted: 
and he&#44; unguarded and corrupted in mind&#44; seized the weapon of 
deadly strife and his guilty hand was imbrued and dyed red in a 
brother&#39;s blood. &#8212; You say&#44; perhaps&#44; that one so guilty from 
such a cause is a mere fiction&#59; alas&#44; no brethren&#33; the examples 
of dreadful reality are but too common&#44; and many a family 
now mourns over their blighted hopes brought about by the 
indulgence of unguarded and unchecked anger&#44; vented in mur&#8211; 
der and homicide. &#8212; Let us take another case&#44; not one for which 
the angry Judge above would demand : &#34; Where is thy bro&#8211; 
ther&#44;&#34; and condemn one whom accuses the innocent blood 
crying from the polluted earth &#59; but of an infatuated voluptuary&#44; 
a devotee to pleasure&#44; who is ruining his health and happiness 
upon the path he has chosen to tread. Again&#44; let us suppose 
him to belong to the better classes&#44; a man of education and 
refinement&#44; endowed with reason of a higher degree&#44; and in 
possession of wealth and power. Of course all these advan&#8211; 
tages tend to give him a certain importance in the eyes of 
society as well as in his own. And should he&#44; the man of re&#8211; 
finement&#44; of intellect&#44; of renown&#44; of wealth&#44; and of standing&#44; 
submit to be controlled by antiquated statutes by which the 
unlettered peasant is governed&#63; should he belong to the com&#8211; 
mon herd of common&#8211;place moral people&#44; who fear God as 
their fathers have done before them&#63; Not so can our genius 
act &#59; and behold&#33; he runs riot in his excitements&#44; in his pur&#8211; 
suits of novelty and enjoyment&#44; and he falls deeper and deeper 
into moral debasement&#44; and he grows cloyed with tasting the 
high seasoned food his appetite has so long craved&#44; and he per&#8211;

haps leaves his once loved home&#44; a voluntary exile&#44; and his 
heart becomes soured to all approaclies of humane feelings&#44; and 
he sinks&#44; a prey to the gnawing of an overloaded conscience 
and the oppression of a heart destroyed by remorse&#44; into an 
early and untimely grave&#44; a monument dire of the effects of 
unregulated passions and desires uncurbed by religion and mo&#8211; 
rality. &#8212; In the two instances here exhibited&#44; we have seen how 
a disregard to the inculcation of sound religious and moral 
principles in childhood may cause many a noble soul to be lost&#44; 
by leaving them unguarded against the approach of sin&#44; or 
rather by removing all defences by which the enemy can be 
warded off&#44; &#8212; It must be apparent that sinning even to degrada&#8211; 
tion in such cases&#44; is a result to be expected&#44; and in place of 
wondering that so many become lost&#44; it is very remarkable 
how any one in such circumstances ever escapes the contamina&#8211; 
tion &#8212; Besides those of the gifted and higlier classes&#44; the un&#8211; 
educated and poor are no less subject&#44; under similar conditions&#44; 
to enormities only varied in shape&#44; nature&#44; and appearance by 
the difference of station and opportunity&#59; and in truth our 
daily experience proves&#44; how much and how awfully responsi&#8211; 
ble parents&#44; particularly of the humbler classes&#44; must be to 
God for the neglect which they suffer their cliildren to expe&#8211; 
rience in not attending to&#44; and watching over&#44; and curbing the 
first outbreakings of tlie evil passions. It were easy to pourtray 
to you a poor man&#44; who might have been an ornament to his 
station&#44; become degraded from similar causes&#44; only acting in a 
different manner&#44; which we have shown to be so pernicious in 
the wise and wealthy&#59; but it is needless to fatigue your pa&#8211; 
tience by detaining you with a recital of examples which&#44; alasl 
are so numerous that any one of the least experience must be 
acquainted with many. 

A second reason of moral debasement may be found in the 
carelessness with which we are apt to watch ourselves&#59; and 
unfortunately from this cause proceeds the ruin of many a 
noble&#8211;mind from whose former course of life&#44; and from whose 
previous training better results might have been expected. As the 
world is constituted&#44; we are always surrounded by temptations 
in a greater or less degree&#44; and in combatting these success&#8211; 
fully consists the duty of our life. But how many do fail in

this&#33; how many yield&#44; totter&#44; and stumble &#33; how few are who 
remain steadfast&#44; undismayed&#44; and unblinded by the manifold 
allurements&#33; True&#44; no one becomes depraved from yielding 
to the first temptation &#59; but the road to evil has certainly been 
trod&#44; and the downward path made more pleasing&#44; at least less 
abhorrent to the imagination. &#8212; Imagine a man that has for 
years been sober and abstemious in his habits&#59; hitherto his life 
has been one of ease and comfort&#44; his children have grown up 
around him in strength and beauty&#44; and he is called among the 
happy&#44; one of the happiest &#59; but human prosperity is not ever&#8211; 
lasting &#59; and his evil hour also has arrived &#59; his wealth has be&#8211; 
come impaired by unfortunate speculations&#44; or some other evil 
befals him which to him is grievous to bear &#59; he has heard that 
wine drowns sorrow&#44; and he resorts to it for relief as a trial &#59; 
he stupifies his brain into temporary forgetfulness by the ene&#8211; 
my he puts into his mouth that robs him of his reason &#59; but 
anon&#44; he awakes&#44; he feels perhaps degraded at his weakness&#44; 
and finds his sorrow more agonizing than before &#59; a deeper po&#8211; 
tation will be the next step&#44; and his inebriety will be of longer 
duration &#59; till by degrees&#44; seeing his misery increasing&#44; his 
health waning&#44; he resorts to drink as his sole comforter&#44; ima&#8211; 
gining that his greatest enemy&#44; the chief promoter perhaps of 
his sorrow&#44; the consummator of his sufferings&#44; could be the 
healing balm which his wounded spirit demands: and you at 
length see him the outcast&#44; wallowing in the mire&#44; a disgrace&#44; 
a spectacle&#44; a by&#8211;word&#44; when he might have been&#44; as he once 
was&#44; an example of abstinence&#44; of virtue&#44; and of piety&#33; Do 
I exaggerate&#63; &#8212; Alas&#44; no&#33; the annals of degradation speak also 
of like examples too numerous for the happiness and welfare of 
society &#33;

decided&#44; a fortune has been lost and won&#44; and he&#44; the man who 
was once happy at his own fireside&#44; is reduced to absolute 
beggary&#44; and&#44; when he returns home&#44; he cannot give his children 
bread&#44; when they cry in their hunger. And yet he was not 
always vicious &#33; In an evil hour he was allured to the fatal 
spot to become a spectator of the sins of others&#59; he staked a 
trifle&#44; it mattered not to him whether he lost or won&#59; he won&#44; 
became excited at play&#44; doubled&#44; trebled his stake&#44; won again&#44; 
and his brain whirled round at the prospect of so suddenly&#44; and 
with so little labour&#44; increasing his fortune&#59; another night 
again witnessed his presence in the sinful assembly&#44; and his 
renewed rage for gold&#44; for unholy lucre &#8212; shall I pursue the 
gambler farther&#63; no&#44; the picture becomes too disgusting&#44; in 
short&#44; his sinning is complete &#8212; and the last scene wc have de&#8211; 
scribed &#33; he leaves the house&#44; where he hoped to become 
wealthy and overloaded with treasure&#44; a houseless beggar&#44; in 
brief&#44; a ruined gambler&#33; 

Another man has walked in the fear of his God from infancy &#59; 
a virtuous mother early implanted in his bosom the tender 
seeds of piety&#59; beautiful also were the fruits they bore&#44; and he 
was known among his associates for his retiring modesty and 
benevolence&#59; but&#44; in a moment of unguarded confidence&#44; he 
ventured amona&#59; those who scoff at Providence and scorn the 
power of the Most High. He listened to their wild harangues&#44; 
he was startled by their avowal: &#34; Let us eat&#44; let us drink&#44; let 
us enjoy our existence whilst we may&#44; for to&#8211;morrow we die.&#34; 
They spoke of the delights of sensual enjoyment&#44; of liberty&#44; 
and of equality &#8212; how the rich ought to have no advantages over 
the poor &#8212; how all the produce of industry ought to be equally 
divided. He was fired at their seeming candour&#44; for their 
sophistry as yet concealed their ulterior tenets. Anon they 
went further&#44; they said&#44; that there is no heavenly law &#8212; religion 
has no foundation in fact &#8212; morality is a restraint on the incli&#8211; 
nations&#44; an abridgement of our personal liberty&#44; an invention of 
priests and of tyrants&#44; who want to rule the world by keeping 
them under the restraint of ignorance and superstition. He&#44; 
who had once admitted that pleasure is an object worth living 
for&#44; had also to admit the superfluity&#44; the injuriousness of re&#8211; 
ligious restraint. Next&#44; the retribution after death was de&#8211;

nounced&#59; and the new convert embraced also the doctrine of 
everlasting sleep. Thus initiated&#44; what waste him the Creator&#63; 
no law&#44; according to those pernicious notions&#44; was given&#59; 
pleasure is the grand object of life&#59; there is no life after death&#59; 
no reward &#59; no punishment. And at last he heard proclaimed 
aloud what the fool says in his heart: &#39;•&#39; There is no God&#44;&#34; and 
the madman grasped at this idea to slay within him the last 
lurking affection for the religion of his ancestors &#59; and now&#44; 
he too&#44; like his teachers&#44; scoffed against all that is holy&#44; he bid 
defiance to the power of Heaven&#44; imagining that the watchful 
Eye was closed for him&#44; because he denied his existence. What 
course of crime was now open for him&#33; with adulterers he har&#8211; 
boured&#59; with blasphemers he revelled&#44; with murderers he as&#8211; 
sociated&#44; and on the altar of blood&#8211;stained liberty he immolated 
his benefactors&#44; his friends&#44; and his kindred&#44; and exhibited 
even his father&#39;s head as an evidence of his virtue &#33; abused 
word&#44; when thus applied to dignify liorrors and crimes. &#8212; But 
his doings did not last for ever&#44; and a sudden and awful death 
closed his career&#44; whilst yet uttering his imprecations against 
the Supreme Judge&#44; aye&#44; on the very day on which he bid de&#8211; 
fiance&#44; on which he denied his existence&#44; he was made to feel 
his power&#44; and hurried hence&#44; to answer at that dread tribunal&#44; 
for his misdeeds&#44; and for the grace abused&#44; and for the law he 
had forsaken. 

Yet another who forsook the path of righteousness had borne 
in better days the character of an upright man&#59; he was fair in 
his dealings&#44; and nothing unlawfully obtained was found in his 
possession. To the widow he was a protector&#44; and a guardian he 
was to the orphan. But his hour of trial came&#59; the prosperity 
of his early years was declining&#44; and in his tribulation he called 
not on God for assistance&#44; he sought not for aid from the merci&#8211; 
ful One&#44; and he relied on his ingenuity to extricate himself 
from his difficulties. False shame prevented him from laying 
his distressed situation open before his friends&#44; his resolution 
wavered&#44; and he appropriated to his own use the substance of 
the widow and of the orphan entrusted to his care&#44; and he asso&#8211; 
ciated at length with plunderers and shared their spoils&#44; till his 
turpitude became known to the ministers of the law&#44; and he was 
punished for the injuries he had done to his fellow&#8211;men. &#8212; More

examples might be furnished&#44; we could follow sinners of every 
kind step by step from tlie first petty crime to the consumma&#8211; 
tion of daring deeds and high&#8211;handed outrage&#59; but enough has 
been shown to prove that the first step taken in sin makes 
sinning easy and pleasant&#44; and that therefore we need not ex&#8211; 
press so much surprise at the sight of great criminality in others&#44; 
when we reflect how nearly we are at all times exposed to 
become what they are already. Let no man think himself 
secure in his imagined excellence&#44; for confidence is the forerunner 
of deterioration &#59; but when we are watchful&#44; and regard with 
care every step we take&#44; we may then hope to maintain that 
degree which we have once attained&#44; and if we look upon 
every act of piety&#44; no matter how trifling&#44; as useful&#44; we will in&#8211; 
deed attain an enviable degree of moral excellence. Like the 
fair creation of God is made up of little creatures as well as large 
ones&#44; as the humble violet is no less fragrant than the magnifi&#8211; 
cent citron: so has every good act its beneficial effect&#44; so does 
every obedience to God increase and strengthen the purity of 
our souls. And thus taught Ben Asai&#44; one of the early sages 
of our nation : &#39;n p mm nSp miTDb &#34;&#44;&#8211;i &#39;in 
n&#34;iD>&#39; ninu &#34; Run after every little good act&#44; and fly from sin&#59; 
for one good act is the forerunner of another&#44; and one sin pro&#8211; 
duces another sin.&#34; And of this we may be assured&#44; that no 
matter how unpleasant any good act may appear at first&#44; its repe&#8211; 
tition will be easier than its first accomplishment&#59; and therefore 
if the beginning is once made&#44; we may with more safety look 
forward to a good ending. In the same way the first step in 
crime is the chief&#44; and is the precursor of a long list yet to fol&#8211; 
low&#44; each greater in magnitude&#44; and each easier of accomplish&#8211; 
ment &#40;as far as the will is concerned) than the other. If we 
therefore wish to preserve our virtue&#44; we should watch ourselves 
with care&#44; and withstand every temptation&#44; which might tend 
to draw us froni the right path. And moreover it is necessary 
that we should frequently examine ourselves dispassionately&#44; to 
discover if we have erred &#59; and if our investigation should con&#8211; 
vict us as wrong&#44; it is our duty to set about at once altering the 
defects&#44; and not wait till our debt to God has become heavy&#59; 
for who knows if we will ever be able to alter&#44; since every day 
may be our last. But if we have gone astray widely from the

way marked out by God&#44; if indeed in our obduracy we have 
added sin to sin&#44; till we are ripe for punishment&#44; be the cause 
carelessness&#44; pride or temptation: we should stop short in our 
career&#44; as soon as we make the discovery&#44; and not endeavour to 
hide our sins behind the plausible excuse&#44; that our passions are 
stronger&#44; or our opportunities greater than another&#39;s. In refu&#8211; 
tation to the first plea&#44; or excuse for sin&#44; we may answer&#44; that it 
is not the positive strength of an individual&#39;s passions or natu&#8211; 
ral inclination to sin which is the reason of one man&#39;s being 
better than another&#44; but that one has them under better control 
than the other. For if we will watch ourselves and check the 
rising inclinations&#44; we will be able to overcome strong impulses&#44; 
and we can be virtuous in despite of them&#59; and therefore also 
we find many a one with such a temperament always walking 
humbly before God and mindful of his commandments. On the 
other hand sluggish passions and weak inclinations may outgrow 
our strength of combating them&#44; if we yield ourselves to their 
sway&#59; and in the same manner we find indolent persons&#44; who 
never displayed any fire&#44; either of genius or activity&#44; acting the 
parts of very wicked men. &#8212; With regard to the second excuse 
that our temptations have been great&#44; we may remark&#44; that 
temptations might be a valid excuse&#44; if we were not informed as 
to the extent and nature of our duties&#59; but this is not the case&#59; 
God&#39;s law is explicit&#44; and whatever is prohibited there should 
be avoided&#44; as we would avoid destruction and death&#44; no matter 
how great the incentive and opportunity for transgression may 
be. In matters of common honesty&#44; no person would think of 
excusing himself for stealing&#44; by saying&#44; that he was left in a 
room where he saw treasures of which he could not refrain from 
stealing&#59; and yet in religious and moral misdeeds we hear con&#8211; 
stantly excuses&#44; not the least more reasonable&#44; offered in defence 
of every species of wrong. So will the Sabbath&#8211;breaker tell 
you&#44; that he measures the small amount of worldly gain against 
the positive enactment of the law&#59; the man that gives way to 
his anger and commits an act of violence&#44; that he was provoked 
to do an unlawful deed by the offences of another&#59; the disobe&#8211; 
dient child&#44; that his father asked an act of obedience more than 
he&#44; the child&#44; thought consonant with reason&#59; and lastly&#44; he that 
forswears his religion&#44; professes his motives to be worldly pre&#8211;

ferment. And are grounds like these sufficient to excuse our 
sinning&#63; and what better excuses can sinners make&#63; To avoid 
such a ruinous course&#44; we should rend the veil from our soul&#44; 
expose her nakedness&#44; and view her deformity with an unquail&#8211; 
ingeye. We must expect to find ourselves very sinful&#44; and we 
should not endeavour to gloss over half of our faults. If now 
we turn away our eyes from our errors&#44; and imagine ourselves 
better than we are&#44; there is no hope of our ever reforming&#59; but 
if we seriously grapple with the evil&#44; and analyze our feelings 
carefully&#44; place our turpitude in its natural hideousness before 
ourselves&#44; we may look forward to the time when we may be 
freed from the burden of our sins. To effect a reformation&#44; we 
should&#44; in the first place&#44; after discovering our wrongs&#44; endea&#8211; 
vour at once to discontinue them&#44; and not leave off by degrees&#44; 
for this would be compromising with our conscience. Let the 
profane scoffer not merely omit abusing those who believe&#44; but 
at once he himself must think and speak respectfully of the 
Deity&#44; and thus prepare himself for further amendment&#59; the 
same may be said with regard to other sins. Having once left 
off sinning&#44; we should set about a thorough reformation&#44; or in 
other words&#44; a change of conduct&#44; and endeavour to act in every 
way conformably to the law of God&#44; and prove in this manner&#44; 
that the detestation of our crimes is inwardly felt and our reno&#8211; 
vated love of righteousness sincere and undivided. On former 
occasions we have dwelt at greater length upon the means of 
repentance&#44; such as fasting&#44; prayer and charity&#59; and it is there&#8211; 
fore merely necessary to refer to them now&#44; and to state&#44; that to 
promote the growth of righteousness&#44; we should&#44; after the cus&#8211; 
tom of our ancestors&#44; fast with contrition&#44; pray with devotion&#44; 
and distribute charity to the needy&#44; to compensate in as far as 
lies in our power the wrong we have done&#44; or to use the word 
of our ancients&#44; to correct the evils in the sum of universal 
right which we have caused by the unholiness of our deeds. Now 
it may be asked: &#34; Who should repent&#63; will the great sinner&#39;s 
repentance be available&#63; need the man who formerly was right&#8211; 
eous repent&#44; or will his prior good conduct counterbalance his 
present sins&#63;&#34; To these questions we have distinct answers 
given by the prophets&#44; especially in the book of Ezekiel&#44; chap&#44; 
xviii.&#44; beginning at verse 20: 

    <pb n="463"/>

164 CAUSES AND REMEDIES OF SIN. 

&#34;The soul that sinneth shall die&#59; the son shall not suffer for 
the sin of the father&#44; and the father shall not suffer for the sin 
of the son&#59; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon 
him&#44; and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. &#8212; 
And the wicked&#44; if he returns from all his sins which he has done&#44; 
and keeps all my statutes&#44; and does justice and charity&#44; living 
he shall live&#44; he shall not die. All his transgressions which he 
has done&#44; shall notbe remembered tintohim: for the righteousness 
which he has done he shall live. Do I then desire the death of the 
wicked&#63; says the Lord God&#59; but that he should return from 
his ways and live. &#8212; And when the righteous returns from his 
ways and does wrong&#44; like all the abominations which the 
wicked has done&#59; shall he do them and live &#63; All his righte&#8211; 
ousness which he has done shall not be remembered&#44; in the 
iniquity he has committed and in the sin he has sinned&#44; in them 
shall he die.&#34; 

And further&#44; says the prophet : 

&#34; Throw from off you all your transgressions which you have transgressed 
in&#44; and make yourself a new heart&#44; and a new spirit&#59; and why will you die&#63; 
house of Israel &#63; For I desire not the death of the guilty one&#44; says the Lord 
God&#44; return then&#44; and live. Ezek. xviii. 31&#8211;32. 

We have in this passage a perfect exposition of the various 
cases&#44; stated to you this day&#44; of righteous men relapsing into 
sin&#44; and it is emphatically stated&#44; that none of their good deeds 
shall be remembered&#44; when they become transgressors. If&#44; 
now&#44; one who once loved virtue has yielded himself to vice&#44; he 
must not think to escape punishment&#44; for retribution will be 
awarded to him in the same manner it is to others &#59; nor must 
he think that his former good actions will save him from be&#8211; 
coming wicked&#44; since we are told from high authority&#44; and ex&#8211; 
perience proves it&#44; how little recollection of former goodness 
will rescue a man from a downward course of evil&#59; and he that 
relies upon his attained eminence is but too likely to fall &#59; and

he that looks with pride and disdain upon others worse than 
himself&#44; and feels a self&#8211;exultation unmixed with lowliness&#44; 
meekness&#44; and gratitude&#44; before God&#44; is already far advanced 
on the road to sin&#44; for security and carelessness have destroyed 
many a one. If&#44; therefore&#44; a righteous man should be betrayed 
into sin&#44; let him arrest his step at the outset&#44; and return at 
once with prayer and repentance. But far better would it be 
that the first step in sin never be taken&#44; and better would it be 
that we never knew what pleasure is given by transgression&#44; 
than that we should feel one moment of remorse and compunc&#8211; 
tion. For our pursuit of virtue may be compared to the ascent 
of some slippery and icy mountain&#59; we have the strength to 
toil onward&#44; we have the capacity to reach the summit&#44; but if 
we loiter on the way&#44; if we&#44; by carelessness or design&#44; suffer 
our feet to slip: we cannot know where we may be able to 
halt in our descent&#44; and if we even succeed to recover our firm 
footing by grasping at some shrubs that here and there are 
placed in our way&#44; still we have to retrace the same weary 
rout which we had already once overcome&#44; when our foot lost 
its hold. And&#44; says the prophet: &#34; If thou leavest me one day&#44; 
two days I will forsake thee&#44;&#34; meaning&#44; that as man is bound 
to make the beginning in amendment&#44; he will have to do an 
increased number of holy actions to regain the favour of God 
he has lost. &#8212; If in this way the righteous one too requires care 
and repentance&#44; the wicked on the other hand should not de&#8211; 
spair of hope and pardon. The invitation to purify ourselves 
is held out to all men&#44; and no matter how great the sins&#44; we 
should consider&#44; that it is not for us to set limits to God&#39;s 
kindness. Nor should we say: &#34;We cannot repent&#59;&#34; for we are 
told that we should make ourselves a new heart and a new 
spirit&#44; consequently it is within our power to change ourselves&#44; 
whenever we please. It is only obduracy which withholds us&#44; 
it is only our deafness to the affectionate invitation which is a 
clog upon our reformation. But what do we gain if we perse&#8211; 
vere in sin &#63; only a temporary gratification of our appetites&#44; or 
may be we succeed in making the world believe that we think 
nothing blameable in our conduct. And what do we lose there&#8211; 
by&#63; we jeopard the everlasting peace of our souls&#44; and incur 
and confirm the just indignation of our God whom our pre&#8211;

tensions cannot deceive. And why should pride prevent us 
from acknowledging to the world that we have been wrong &#63; 
must I persist in violating the Sabbath&#44; because I did so once 
publicly&#63; must I nightly resort to the gaming house&#44; because 1 
was once seen there &#63; must my drunkenness be of daily occur&#8211; 
rence&#44; because I was once drunk&#63; must forbidden food be daily 
tasted&#44; because I once transgressed&#63; m.ust I become a prowling 
thief&#44; because I am known to have wronged a neighbour once &#63; 
Surely the absurdity of such reasoning is too apparent to need 
a refutation &#59; and yet it would appear that daily such motives 
prompt men to sfn&#44; or to persevere in sinning. How many 
children have not been permitted to enter the covenant&#44; because 
their parents had once foolishly spoken against its necessity&#33; 
how many intermixtures with gentiles have taken place&#44; because 
one of a family began to set the example &#33; and how many 
persons publicly violate the holy Sabbath&#44; disregard holiness of 
life&#44; live in incest&#44; indulge in drunkenness&#44; love dishonesty&#44; 
because they love the evil which others do&#33; Yet&#44; if we but re&#8211; 
flect&#44; we must clearly see that we are&#44; in thus doing&#44; treading 
the way of death &#8212; yes&#44; death of the soul&#44; perhaps too the death 
of the body&#59; and still there is that remedy which the great 
Father has vouchsafed&#44; it is called repentance &#8212; a return from 
the evil&#44; and a return to the good. But&#44; if we come to repent&#44; 
we must not look upon one or another of our crimes as more 
amiable than the other&#44; for the prophet teaches: &#34;If the wicked 
return from all his sins&#44;&#34; and thus&#44; not one should be retained&#44; 
if we truly wish to be forgiven. &#8212; If we thus come prepared by 
repentance&#44; if we superadd deeds of virtue&#44; if we approach with 
an humble faith in God that He will forgive us in his mercy : 
we may then hope with confidence that we will be restored to 
favour&#44; that we have corrected the evil which we have com&#8211; 
mitted. &#8212; When we have&#44; in this manner&#44; accomplished the de&#8211; 
sire of God&#44; we will willingly again submit to his guidance&#59; 
and if He chastises us then for our former sins&#44; we will subject 
ourselves with resignation to the decree which dooms us to 
suffer&#59; and even should our body sink into death&#44; we will glorify 
the infinite One&#44; who has suffered us to live long enough&#44; that 
we might regain his lost favour&#44; and not snatched us hence in 
our sinfulness &#33;

Brethren &#33; the prophet says in the name of God : &#34; I desire 
not the death of the guilty one&#44; return ye and live &#33;&#34; Thus we 
are warned&#59; but do we heed it&#63; Does not the Holy Spirit 
speak to unwilling ears&#63; It was so in ancient days&#44; when the 
temple fell a sacrifice to our transgressions &#59; but we have yet 
been spared to glorify God by our conduct &#59; let us then hope&#44; 
that there are many to whom the warning will come like a 
refreshing shower to quicken into life the seeds of piety which 
have long lain dormant. This season is emphatically called that 
of repentance&#59; may it then be indeed accomplished that many a 
repentant heart will seek the Lord and his righteousness&#44; and 
return to Him in sincerity and love &#59; so that when the coming 
Day of Forgiveness of sin closes&#44; many a newly accepted child of 
God may cry out in the congregation of the faithful&#44; in the ful&#8211; 
ness of faith : &#34; The Lord is the God&#44; his kingdom will endure 
for ever &#59; He is our God&#44; and there is none besides Him.&#34; 

Lord God &#33; shower over us thy blessings and extend over 
us thy protecting arm. Forgive us our trespasses and purify us 
from our iniquities&#44; and do not destroy us utterly according to 
thy mercy &#59; and do Thou according to thy promises receive 
thy children that pray to thee &#59; and stay the avenger&#44; and with&#8211; 
hold thy anger from the sinful creatures of thy hand that call 
on thee. And do Thou comfort our souls&#44; and refreshen our 
spirit with thy grace&#44; and let us experience on this day and for 
ever&#44; that Thou art still the Father&#44; and Protector&#44; and Guardian 
of Israel &#59; and on the day&#44; which Thou hast appointed as the 
period on which atonement is made for us&#44; let it be thy will to 
inscribe in thy books of remembrance : &#34;My children your 
guilt is blotted out&#44; you shall not die.&#34; &#8212; Let this be thy will&#44; 
and mayest Thou speedily send the redeemer to Zion. Amen.

DISCOURSE XLIII. 

THE SPIRIT OF THE A.GE. 

OUR God and Creator &#33; we thy people are here assembled 
this day to offer up to Thee the grateful thanks of our hearts 
for the many favours which we have received from thy bounty. 
When in darkness the world was sunk&#44; Thou calledst forth thy 
servant Abraham to shine like the light of the bright beacon 
on the bosom of the trackless ocean. Amidst idolatrous nations 
Thou didst preserve his son and his grandson&#44; till people igno&#8211; 
rant of thy worship learned to adore thy name. When Jacob 
went down to Egypt to fulfil his destiny&#44; and the destiny of 
his house&#44; in the land of the sons of Mitzraim: thy glory went 
thither with him&#44; and he did not leave this earth&#44; till his eyes 
had foreseen thy kingdom&#44; that is to spread over all flesh. His 
children Thou didst not forsake&#59; and when they had&#44; unto the 
fourth generation&#44; endured the oppression of the princes of 
Noph&#44; Thou sentest thy servant Moses to work great things in 
thy name &#59; and Pharaoh acknowledged thy almighty power&#44; 
Lord&#44; and let thy children go free from bondage &#59; and they 
went forth to follow thy guidance in the howling wilderness. 
There&#44; Thou gavest them water out of the arid rock&#44; and from 
heaven Thou bestowdest on them&#44; in abundance&#44; bread never 
before tasted by men. But their souls too Thou didst disin&#8211; 
thral. Thou banishedst the gloom of superstition and false wor&#8211; 
ship from their minds&#44; and yon favoured Sinai witnessed thy 
descent to speak unto thy people&#44; and to command them the 
path they should follow in serving Thee. But still thy good&#8211; 
ness did not end here &#59; and ever hast Thou been the Guardian 
of Israel&#59; ever hast Thou watched over us&#44; that we have not been 
cut oft&#39;&#44; and that the burden of misfortune has not crushed us. 
do Thou&#44; in thy mercy then&#44; continue to bless us&#44; to preserve 
us&#44; and to protect us &#59; and if not for our sakes&#44; if our sins are 
too great&#44; if our transgressions cry aloud for retribution : do 
it for the sake of thy abundant mercies&#44; and for the sake of the

covenant Thou didst make with our ancestors&#44; when Thou 
chosest them as thy own people and treasure &#33; Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 
If a public teacher were to consult his own ease and popu&#8211; 
larity&#44; he would assuredly never undertake to grapple with the 
follies of the age&#44; which he&#44; by his own individual exertions&#44; 
certainly cannot hope to overcome. Nothing but ill will&#44; per&#8211; 
haps hatred&#44; perhaps taunts&#44; can be his reward from those 
whose faults he may unwittingly expose&#44; and very many others 
will think that remarks&#44; which may wound the self&#8211;love of any 
class of his hearers&#44; had better be omitted. Besides this&#44; no 
sooner does any one presume to teach&#44; than the tongue of 
detraction is busy with his character&#44; and even the wicked will 
search for trifles&#44; for small foibles&#44; magnify them by the light 
of envy and malice&#44; and declare that one so bad as he is&#44; has no 
right to presume to correct others equally good and vir&#8211; 
tuous with himself. Add to this&#44; that words will rarely effect 
reformation&#44; at least an immediate one&#44; in those for whose im&#8211; 
provement he is anxious&#44; and the feeling of mortification which 
the generally sensitive philanthropist experiences at seeing his 
advice contemned : and any one can easily determine&#44; that he&#44; 
who lifts up the voice of warning to his fellow&#8211;men&#44; has under&#8211; 
taken not an enviable task. Yet it is necessary that there 
should be guides to show the way &#8212; sentinels to warn of the 
comino&#59; storm &#8212; leaders to commence ever the work of reforma&#8211; 
tion &#59; and for the people in general it is requisite that they 
should look with respect upon their teachers&#44; and listen with 
deference to the advice which they may offer in accordance 
with the law of God. Let no one think&#44; that the teacher can 
take any pleasure in exposing faults&#59; for he that would be guilty 
of such an odious outrage deserves not to be called to the chair 
of instruction in Israel&#59; but that he is moved by a love towards 
his fellow&#8211;men to exhort them in time to escape from the ven&#8211; 
geance of the outraged covenant&#44; which will be executed on 
the hardened sinner who transgresseth and repenteth not. 
Is not the teacher himself one of the people &#63; is not their 
glory his glory &#63; is not their shame his shame &#63; &#8212; Why then 
should he be blamed when honest truth compels him to speak

against the misdeeds which he sees wrought around him&#44; by 
Avhich right is neglected &#8212; religion slighted &#8212; evil practised &#8212; 
and wickedness fostered &#63; &#8212; The same already happened to 
Jeremiah&#44; whose misfortune it was to live in wicked times&#44; 
when the law of God had been almost forgotten&#44; and when 
the last remains of our national glory were fast sinking to 
decay. He often had announced the punishment that would 
inevitably follow&#44; and as a recompense for his faithfulness the 
powerful sinners of those days visited him&#44; the humble prophet&#44; 
with unmerited persecution. I must refer you to the twentieth 
chapter of his book&#44; where you can read the details&#44; and where 
also you will find the almost surprising fact that Jeremiah was 
an unwilling agent&#44; equally so with Moses in the time of Pha&#8211; 
raoh&#44; mistrusting&#44; like the great prophet&#44; his power to arrest the 
evil&#44; which to denounce he was sent. He says&#44; speaking to 
God: &#34; Thou hast persuaded me&#44; Lord&#44; and I was persuaded. 
Thou hast given me strength&#44; and didst prevail &#59; &#40;but) I have 
become an object of derision the whole day&#44; every one does 
mock me. For whenever I will speak&#44; I must cry aloud&#44; must 
proclaim violence and destruction&#59; for the word of the Lord 
has become to me shame and derision the whole day. &#8212; And I 
have said&#44; I will not mention Him&#44; nor speak any more in his 
name&#44; but it was then in my heart like burning fire&#44; enclosed 
within my bones&#44; and I was tired of enduring it&#44; and never shall 
I be able.&#34; Here we see how gladly the prophet would have 
refrained from obtruding his advice upon the unwilling ears of 
the multitude&#44; knowing that the more he spoke in the name of 
the Lord&#44; the more he would find himself despised and hated &#59; 
but the word would not be thus restrained&#44; the message of 
which he was full could not thus be suppressed&#44; and he felt as 
though a burning fire was consuming his heart and wasting his 
bones&#44; until he had spread the message of Heaven before the 
people&#44; and had cried it aloud in their ears&#44; so that even unwill&#8211; 
ing they were compelled to hear. &#8212; Now&#44; as an humble and 
unworthy follower of the great ones of former days&#44; with 
powers far inferior beneath the least on their list&#44; with a perfect 
consciousness that much may be alleged against myself&#44; with a 
full knowledge that I have sinned as others have sinned: I think 
it my solemn duty to inveigh against the many derelictions 

    <pb n="470"/>

THE SPIRIT OF THE AGE. 171 

which I daily see practised by the remnant of Israel. I know 
full well&#44; as well as any one can inform me&#44; that in all likeli&#8211; 
hood but few will listen with patience to any thing I have to 
say&#44; fewer yet will apply the moral to themselves&#44; and fewer 
still will leave the place of worship amended in heart and 
resolved to alter their doings&#59; but nevertheless I must discharge 
what I consider my duty&#44; let the result be what it may&#59; perhaps 
the heart of one may suddenly feel and acknowledge the power 
of the Lord&#44; and who knows but that one sheep may return to 
the sheep&#8211;fold of the great Shepherd&#44; when it hears that it has 
strayed in its wanderings&#44; and that the return way is not impe&#8211; 
ded by obstacles which cannot be surmounted. 

Brethren&#33; the painful truth must force itself upon the con&#8211; 
viction of every one who thinks&#44; that the present age is not one 
of religion&#44; but that&#44; on the contrary&#44; the duties which the law 
demands are daily more and more neglected. &#8212; Why is this&#63; 
why is the house of God empty &#63; why are the Sabbaths and 
festivals neglected&#63; why do those fall off who formerly were 
true and steadfast&#63; why does the father show the evil example 
to his sons&#44; and the mother to her daughters&#63; It is&#44; because 
the age has learned to love gain more than the law&#44; riches 
more than virtue&#44; the perishable more than the everlasting&#44; in a 
word&#44; to love the outward world more than the almighty God&#33; 
But why should we of the present day be so much more sedulous 
in the pursuit of wealth&#44; than were our forefathers&#63; have we 
any claim to a longer duration of life than they had&#63; It may&#44; 
indeed&#44; be freely conceded&#44; that the present age has made won&#8211; 
derful advances in the useful sciences&#44; in refinement and luxury&#59; 
all the elegancies of life are now more appreciated and more 
accessible than they were before our days&#59; and a general spirit 
of enquiry&#44; for good or for evil&#44; is spread abroad&#44; before which 
error and fanaticism will ere long have to retire. All this the 
moralist will cheerfully acknowledge&#59; but he will instance it 
as an additional motive for gratitude to the supreme Ruler&#44; for 
having showered down so many more blessings on us than on 
our fathers. But how do the worldly repay this kindness&#33; In&#8211; 
stead of repairing to the house of God to return their thanks to 
the Dispenser of all good&#44; their feet do but seldom seek the 
sacred threshhold&#59; and if they do go&#44; they arrive at so late an

hour&#44; as to disturb by their entrance the assembled worship&#8211; 
pers&#59; and when there&#44; their indecorous behaviour&#44; their inatten&#8211; 
tion&#44; their conversation where silence should reign&#44; their looks of 
disdain&#44; as though they honoured the worship by their presence: 
all prove that their hearts are not engaged in the divine service&#44; 
and that their attendance for the once or twice a year is but a 
mere outward show&#44; a display more of their adherence to 
religion than a sincerely felt devotion. And when do many 
of these persons come&#63; on the usual day of the weekly rest&#63; on 
a festival&#44; when their business might suffer by their absence &#63; 
No &#8212; only on such days when their business cannot be attended 
to&#44; when the laws of men forbid work to be done &#59; but at other 
times the world is more loved than God&#44; and the courts of his 
holy house are left untrodden of their feet. And do reasoning 
men call this devotion &#63; do Israelites call this worshipping the 
God of their fathers &#63; Wo&#44; wo&#44; on the sinning generation &#33; 
this is mockery &#33; this is profanation &#33; not such is the service 
which the Lord desires&#44; not such the servants. For already 
against the sinners of his own day did Isaiah testify &#40;i. 10&#8211;13): 
&#34; Hear ye the word of the Lord&#44; chiefs of Sodom&#44; hearken to 
the instruction of our God&#44; people of Gomorrah. To what 
purpose serves me the mass of your sacrifices&#44; says the Lord&#44; I 
am sated with the burnt&#8211;offerings of rams&#44; and the fat of fat&#8211; 
lings&#44; and the blood of steers&#44; of lambs&#44; and of wethers&#44; I 
desire not. When you come to be seen in my presence &#8212; who 
asks it at your hands to tread my courts &#63; Bring no more the 
offering of falsehood&#44; it is to me incense of abomination &#8212; new&#8211; 
moons&#44; Sabbaths&#44; festivals &#8212; I cannot endure sin with festivity.&#34; 
From this it will clearly appear how odious is to God that 
pretended holiness&#44; where the outward conformity does not 
find a responding feeling in the heart &#59; and no matter how 
much soever we have succeeded in glossino&#59; over our faults&#44; no 
matter how much polishing we have applied to the unsightly 
surface : we may be perfectly assured&#44; that the inward cor&#8211; 
ruption will not escape Him to whom all is known. &#8212; No&#44; 
brethren&#44; this is not the way which can be pleasing to our 
heavenl)&#39; Father &#59; if we are bad&#44; if we are sinners&#44; do not let 
us figure in our minds an image of excellence and apply it to 
ourselves &#59; if we have transgressed the law let us not&#44; in the

name of justice&#44; lay claim to the title of pious and virtuous 
men &#59; for in this way we would add to our other sins the crime 
of insulting the Holy Spirit&#44; which we yet cannot deceive. 
As well might an Israelite sit down to a tabic covered with 
forbidden food and ask God&#39;s blessing upon the sinful meal &#33; 
Would such worship not better be omitted &#63; And yet this is 
the spirit of our age as it was of Isaiah&#39;s&#44; that on high occasions 
we now and then show our faces in God&#39;s temple&#44; we bring 
our sacrifice&#44; we display a certain zeal and energy for a moment&#44; 
and imagine that in this way we have satisfied our conscience &#59; 
but no sooner does interest call&#44; no sooner become crime and 
sin a little more profitable than virtue and piety&#44; than we for&#8211; 
sake the standard of the Lord&#44; &#34; we see the thief&#44;&#34; to use the 
words of Scripture&#44; &#39;•&#39; and run after him&#44; and have our portion 
with adulterers.&#34; And do we not see hourly the bitter fruits 
of this mockery of religion &#63; Where is the wholesome disci&#8211; 
pline which parents should exercise over their children &#63; it is 
sacrificed to interest &#59; the father fears that his son may not 
become great enough and rich enough &#59; and straightway he 
permits him&#44; nay teaches and in a measure compels him&#44; to 
desecrate the Sabbath&#8211;day&#44; whilst he perhaps himself makes his 
appearance at the Synagogue&#44; and even pretends to direct and 
lead others. &#8212; But&#44; brethren&#44; I must put it to your own con&#8211; 
science to answer the question without self&#8211;love or self&#8211;decep&#8211; 
tion&#44; whether it is really necessaiy for the advancement of your 
children&#44; that religion should be so totally neglected &#63; whether 
it is absolutely requisite that your offspring should be taught by 
you to despise God&#39;s law &#63; &#8212; In yon Decalogue which surmounts 
our ark of the law&#44; in yon Decalogue which the Lord gave 
to his people for their government&#44; it is written : &#34; Thou shalt 
honour thy father and thy mother&#44;&#34; and you are right in exact&#8211; 
ing implicit obedience from your children&#44; in accordance with 
the law of God. But the same Decalogue also teaches : &#34; Re&#8211; 
member the Sabbath&#44;&#34; and this you imagine may be safely left 
unenforced. Are you so blind as not to see&#44; that you cannot 
obtain your children&#39;s esteem&#44; if you show them the example&#44; 
or permit them to neglect this precept&#63; Will not the ciiild 
reason thus : &#34; The obedience I owe my parents and to the law 
of God rest upon the same foundation&#44; and if one is unneces&#8211;

sary&#44; the other is equally so.&#34; But you may perhaps say&#44; that 
this reasoning is never resorted to &#59; nevertheless&#44; experience 
may be safely appealed to&#44; to prove&#44; that filial obedience has 
much deteriorated under the shameful want of religious educa&#8211; 
tion from which so many of the rising generation suffer. 
Formerly the father spoke&#44; and no one of his family would 
contradict him &#59; but now&#44; the son rises in judgment against the 
father&#44; and the daughter against the mother &#59; and that defer&#8211; 
ence to parental authority in general&#44; and that respect for old 
age&#44; which was once so becoming in youth&#44; is&#44; alas&#33; fast wearing 
away among us &#59; and even the union of families and the unani&#8211; 
mity of interest and wishes are disappearing before the selfish 
pursuits of the individual members of the household. I may 
perhaps&#44; be charged with overdrawing the picture&#44; and of add&#8211; 
ing fictitious traits to my portrait &#59; but I believe that I have 
underrated the truth&#44; and that the evil is yet greater than I 
have stated. And why is it so&#63; because the children are not 
early taught to love God above all things&#44; and that his favour 
is to be prized more than riches &#59; and if even it should have 
been taught in infancy&#44; no sooner is the boy old enough to 
aspire to a profession&#44; or to embark in trade&#44; than he is flatly 
told&#44; that now&#44; as he has to make his living&#44; he may neglect 
the Sabbath&#44; and eat whatever is put before him &#59; it is his busi&#8211; 
ness to get along in the world&#44; but not to be stopped by specu&#8211; 
lative opinions. I know well enough&#44; that there are honourable 
exceptions to this almost universal degeneracy&#59; but too many&#44; 
alas&#33; do as I have represented it &#59; and the consequences may 
easily be calculated on with certainty: the child grows up with&#8211; 
out any religion whatever&#44; he neither fears God&#44; for that his 
parents have not taught him&#44; and he honours not these&#44; because 
he cannot see from his own reasoning that they deserve it from 
him. And when such a one is asked&#44; why he is not religious&#44; 
he answers&#44; that he does know little or nothing about it&#44; not 
having had any instruction and but little of example before 
him&#44; and he blames his parents for not educating him a servant 
of the Lord. It is indeed true&#44; that an excuse of this kind is 
not enough to justify a want of religion in any one&#59; since the 
means of self&#8211;education are at present so plentifully scattered 
about&#44; that whoever wishes it can learn&#44; and there are enough

righteous yet left whose example may safely be followed. But 
this does in nowise do away with the blame attachable to pa&#8211; 
rents and guardians for the entire want of&#44; or the little care 
devoted to&#44; a religious domestic education &#59; for no matter how 
much a child may learn at school&#44; when removed from his 
parents&#39; eye&#44; it is the domestic fireside nevertheless&#44; where 
the word of God should be made dear to him. For what does 
the Bible teach&#63; &#34; And thou shalt teach them &#40;the words of 
God) diligently unto thy children&#44; and thou shalt speak of 
them&#44; when thou sittest in thy house&#44; when thou walkest by 
the way&#44; when thou liest down&#44; and when thou risest up.&#34; I 
may freely leave it to the reflection of my auditors to deter&#8211; 
mine&#44; whether this is their mode of doing&#44; whether they make 
the law of God lovely in their children&#39;s eyes&#44; whether they 
show them by their example&#44; no less than by precept&#44; the way 
they ought to go. But&#44; alas&#33; how many parents are deficient 
In this respect&#33; how much of frivolity&#44; how much of trifling&#44; 
do the children see from their elders &#33; how anxious are the 
pursuits of pleasure and of gain persevered in&#44; whilst religion 
lies in one corner&#44; neglected and unheeded. The child soon 
perceives that its parents labour on the Sabbath&#44; that they do 
not go to the place of worship even if the weather be inviting&#44; 
but that the dancing rooms&#44; the concert&#8211;halls and the theatres&#44; 
are crowded even amidst the stifling heats of summer and the 
terrific storms of winter &#59; in short&#44; the child sees the house 
of God empty&#44; and the resorts of pleasure thronged to over&#8211; 
flowing. Suppose now&#44; that an innocent child in the simpli&#8211; 
city of his heart&#44; should ask his father&#44; why he goes not to the 
Synagogue whither he himself had been sent in the company 
of an esteemed relative&#63; or&#44; suppose that a daughter should 
demand of her mother the reason for her being prohibited from 
doing her little playful work&#44; while the parents are engaged in 
the pursuit of their usual avocation &#59; &#8212; I ask&#44; what must be the 
parents&#39; feelings&#63; or how can they hope that their children 
should be better than themselves&#44; if shame seals their lips&#44; or 
if such examples are perpetually exhibited. 

And still some parents desire to be called Israelites&#44; and are 
unwilling to suffer an imputation of a disregard of religion to 
be fastened on them. Vain delusion&#33; the substance is yielded&#44;

and the shadow grasped&#33; And their children they will not 
permit&#44; as is but just and proper&#44; to mingle in marriage with 
other nations&#33; But how can this be prevented by the system 
of education so generally pursued&#63; For&#44; correct religious know&#8211; 
ledge is not at all&#44; or at least but imperfectly&#44; imparted&#44; and 
they must see&#44; that to their elders at least&#44; worldly interest 
is the paramount good&#59; how can it then be expected of them&#44; 
that they should abstain from following their perverted notions 
of right&#44; when inclination&#44; passion&#44; and interest call&#44; merely 
to gratify a parent&#39;s whim&#63; &#8212; And even suppose that the rising 
generation should be&#44; like the present one&#44; vacillating between 
the service of pleasure and money on the one&#44; and that of God 
on the other hand&#44; what can be the benefit to piety and true 
morality thereby&#63; But even this can hardly be expected&#44; if 
things are not changed&#59; for daily more and more will fall off&#44; 
our number already too small&#44; especially in this favoured 
country&#44; will be gradually diminished by apostacy&#44; by inter&#8211; 
marriage&#44; and by death&#59; and&#44; to speak in human probability&#44; 
in less than the age of one man the name of Israelite will 
hardly be known in this land&#44; save as an object of memory&#44; to 
be referred to as something that has been. I do not say that 
this will be the actual result&#44; but only that the misconduct of 
our people tends towards it. &#8212; For lift up your eyes&#44; who are 
in the habit of attending in this house to adore the God of your 
fathers&#44; and see how few young men resort hither&#44; of how 
many families not even one attends on the Sabbath&#44; how many 
middle&#8211;aged persons are known to follow their pursuits on the 
holy day&#44; and how many children are put to work on the day 
which God ordained should be observed&#44; even by the stranger 
and the slave&#44; nay&#44; the ox and the ass &#8212; see how many children 
are without the means of being informed of their eternal wel&#8211; 
fare&#44; when the fault might easily be remedied by a concerted 
action: I say&#44; view all this&#44; as I have done&#44; with anguish&#44; with 
sorrow&#44; with regret&#44; and with shame at such degeneracy of 
Israel&#44; and then blame the philanthropist&#44; if you can&#44; when he 
declares that our people are hastening along the downward 
path of ruin and destruction. It is useless to deny it&#44; that we 
have fallen upon evil days&#59; for but rarely has the religion of 
God been so much neglected as it now is&#44; and the result thereof

will be dreadful indeed if the evil is not speedily arrested. We 
flatter ourselves occasionally with the reflection&#44; that we must 
needs be better than our forefathers &#59; for they worshipped 
idols&#44; which we do not. &#8212; Admitted&#59; but have we not our idols 
too &#63; They indeed worshipped images&#44; the works of their own 
hands&#44; they only however wanted to imitate their neighbours&#44; 
they wanted to be rid of the bui&#8211;den of the law&#44; they did not 
wish to serve God&#44; that they may be allowed to drink wine 
out of basons&#44; Avallow in forbidden luxuries&#44; profane the 
Sabbath&#44; and follow the evil desires of their hearts. For we 
read in the xxviii chapt. of Isaiah&#44; how the people of his day 
had become corrupt&#44; by following pleasure and gluttony and 
neglecting the law&#44; and they fancied&#44; to use the prophet&#39;s 
words: &#34;We have made a covenant with death&#44; and with the 
grave we have made a contract&#44; the overflowing stream when it 
passes will not come over us&#59; for we have made lies our pro&#8211; 
tection&#44; and with falsehood we cover ourselves.&#39;&#39; They thus 
imagined&#44; that whatever evil might pass over the world would 
not come to them&#44; they were in their own notions amply se&#8211; 
cured by their doings&#44; although they left unminded the law of 
their God. &#8212; In the .same manner we also have our idols&#44; if not 
precisely stocks and stones&#44; certainly those having equally per&#8211; 
nicious consequences. Our worship of the present day&#44; as in&#8211; 
dicated already&#44; are the pursuits of pleasure and gain. Do we 
not sacrifice to them all that we hold dear&#63; the peace of our 
own souls&#44; the welfare of the community&#44; and the moral eleva&#8211; 
tion of our children&#63; Do we not also neglect the law of God &#63; 
Do we not look upon the Sabbath&#8211;breaker with perfect com&#8211; 
plaisance&#63; Do we not swallow the things which God has de&#8211; 
clared unclean&#63; Do we not seek riches as the thing the most to be 
desired &#63; Do not men spend day after day&#44; week after week&#44; 
month after month&#44; in one constant round of unceasing exer&#8211; 
tions to obtain a larger portion of their idol&#63; And what at 
last is the great advantage in being so immensely rich&#63; suppose 
your gold is too much to be counted &#8212; suppose your ships cover 
every ocean &#8212; suppose you have possessions in all parts of the 
world &#8212; have you therefore arranged your covenant with death&#63; 
will the grave not ere long claim its own&#44; and enclose your 
body within the dark gloomy dwelling &#63; And even before this 
period arrives&#44; may not the sweeping stream &#8212; the devouring

flame &#8212; the destroying storm &#8212; the vicissitudes of trade &#8212; carry 
off the idol you so ardently love&#63; And then you will call down 
maledictions on your own head&#44; for having neglected those 
interests which neither the stream&#44; nor the fire&#44; nor the storm 
can injure&#44; the peace everlasting&#44; the treasury of virtue&#44; which 
can be obtained only by serving God. 

But in the very pursuit of wealth there is at times something 
so heartless&#44; that the man of feeling&#44; even if we leave religion 
totally out of view&#44; ought to shrink from it as he would from 
destruction. Those often&#44; who are striving to outdo their neigh&#8211; 
bours&#44; resort to such m.eans to oppress the less cunning&#44; that 
many a one whom the laws cannot punish for a positive 
infringement&#44; is yet so guilty in moral equity&#44; that he is 
scarcely more honest than a highway&#8211;robber. Many a one is 
attended by menials&#44; who acquired his gain by underhanded 
trickery. The world knows perhaps nothing of the knavery 
of such people&#59; they are perhaps called honest&#44; upright&#44; honour&#8211; 
able&#44; and worthy members of the community &#59; but who with 
the smallest portion of humanity would wish to have fraudu&#8211; 
lently sent a husband to an early grave&#44; and turned his widow 
and children adrift to gain a pittance by daily labour&#44; reduced 
from affluence to poverty &#33; Who would like to live in a palace&#44; 
the very stones of which are cemented&#44; so to say&#44; by the tears 
of a ruined partner&#44; or of a defrauded public who confided in 
his honesty&#44; but found themselves outwitted and overreached 
by superior address&#44; without being able to punish the wrong 
they deeply feel&#44; but cannot expose &#33; &#8212; If you now do bow to 
such idols&#44; are you less idolaters than were the Israelites of old &#63; 
If you forget justice &#8212; love &#8212; good&#8211;fellowship &#8212; religion &#8212; kin&#8211; 
dred &#8212; friends &#8212; and God&#44; merely to obtain gold&#44; which avails 
nothing in the grave : are you not cherishing a false wor&#8211; 
ship &#63; &#8212; And if you yourselves think such pursuits unworthy of 
yourselves &#8212; if you believe yourselves bound to love and wor&#8211; 
ship our Father in hea&#39;ven beyond any thing that exists &#8212; how 
can you wish your children and those entrusted to your care to 
do what you think evil &#63; how can you teach&#44; or even permit 
them&#44; to slight the religion in which we all were born &#63; Is it 
reasonable&#44; that you can be justified in inducing them to depart 
from those duties&#44; which you yourselves look upon as necessary 
to your happiness &#63; 

    <pb n="478"/>

And in the same degree as the pursuit of gain is injurious to 
the finer moral perceptions&#44; we may assert&#44; that&#44; without doubt&#44; 
every one who has had any experience&#44; must often have felt how 
unsatisfactory are the enjoyments of pleasure and the possession 
of riches. We think we should be extremely happy to see some&#8211; 
thing which we hear highly spoken of&#44; to hear a celebrated 
singer&#44; to taste a particular food &#59; but no sooner has experience 
come&#44; than we despise the bauble that allured us. We fancy that 
the possession of a given sum would satisfy all our reasonable 
desires &#59; God blesses us&#44; and the wish is obtained &#59; but as if by 
magic another and a larger boon&#44; is at once coveted&#44; and when 
this is got&#44; more and more will be thirsted for to still the yet 
unquenched desire for gold &#59; just like a spoiled child that cries 
for a rattle or some other toy which&#44; when obtained&#44; it breaks 
wantonly after being delighted with it for a brief space&#44; and 
now it cries for a handsomer and more valuable plaything. &#8212; 
Virtues on the contrary are never cloying&#44; never despised when 
once acquired &#59; and it may safely be asserted&#44; that few would 
take the money back&#44; which they have expended in charity&#44; 
even if it were offered to them&#44; with an understanding that 
every merit of the gift should thus be cancelled &#59; for there is 
so much holiness in rectitude and virtue&#44; that hardened indeed 
must be that sinner who could part with the least of his 
acquired mental and spiritual riches. 

It was said in the commencement of our subject&#44; that we had 
no more right to neglect religion than our fathers had before us. 
But few indeed there are who would deny this in theory : yet 
how many deny it in practice&#44; nay even in words &#33; We thus 
hear it often alleged&#44; that our fathers were ignorant&#44; but that we 
in a more enlightened age should be above such prejudices. 
Now&#44; no one will gainsay the evident fact that this age has 
made improvements&#44; wonderful improvenients&#44; if you will&#44; 
upon the discoveries of former periods &#59; but it is utterly denied&#44; 
that in moral sciences the smallest advance has been achieved&#44; 
simply because it is impracticable. The man who builds a 
steam&#8211;engine&#44; which travels through an entire degree of lati&#8211; 
tude in one brief hour&#44; so as almost to annihilate time and 
space&#44; has thereby conceived no stronger or better notions of 
God&#44; and of the nature of his Maker&#44; than the laborious farmer

who drives his ox&#8211;cart&#44; at a space perhaps sixty times slower. 
There is no connection whatever between the outward and the 
inward world&#44; any more than that&#44; if new benefits are vouch&#8211; 
safed through inventions and improvements to mankind&#44; more 
gratitude should be shown to the Giver of wisdom&#44; and a 
greater promptness displayed to engage in his service. What 
would a human master think&#44; if his servants for a few pennies 
of daily wages would toil from morning till night&#44; but as 
soon as he gave them a bag of silver for their pay&#44; they 
should simultaneously refuse doing any work whatever&#44; or 
at least no more than they might call enough &#63; &#8212; What would 
any one call it&#44; but sheer ingratitude &#63; &#8212; And yet we act so 
towards God &#33; When the name of Jew was a passport to ill&#8211; 
treatment&#59; when we were oppressed in the whole world&#59; when 
many tears and few joys were our lot&#44; we were cheerful&#44; will&#8211; 
ing&#44; servants to our God. The world then admired our con&#8211; 
stancy&#44; our devoted heroism. But now enlargement has been 
given to us&#44; persecution for opinion&#39;s sake is no longer the 
fashion&#44; and especially in this land we can worship God without 
let or hindrance&#44; we here have a perfect equality with the 
other inhabitants : yet here it is&#44; where our religion is the most 
neglected&#44; where we have truly succeeded in making our name 
a by&#8211;word for carelessness and neglect of our glorious hope. 
When punished we were good&#44; when free we are wicked. &#8212; Is 
that the gratitude which we are to offer to our Father and hea&#8211; 
venly Master &#63; Is it thus we are to celebrate the Passover and 
our redemption from slavery &#63; Is it thus that we can hope for 
a continuation of the divine favour&#63; Certainly not&#44; and indeed&#33; 
indeed &#33; we may justly fear that ere long the weight of God&#39;s 
vengeance will fall heavily upon us who are guilty of sinning 
against his just decrees. For we imitate the vices of the gen&#8211; 
tiles&#44; but neglect their virtues. They pursue gain and pleasure&#44; 
and we do likewise. But they devote money to public wor&#8211; 
ship &#59; they establish schools for the education of their poor &#59; 
they hasten to their churches&#59; they honour the teacheis of 
their religion &#59; they&#44; many of them at least&#44; try to serve God&#44; 
although in some respects erroneously &#59; but we are backward 
in supporting the worship of olden days &#59; we hardly think&#44; that 
there are poor who too ought to partake of an education that

they might learn to fear the Lord &#59; we stay away for months 
from the holy but humble Synagogue &#59; we honour not those 
in whose mouths the law of God dwells &#59; and we cannot devote 
the necessary time to serve our Maker &#8212; and yet we alone have 
the true law to guide our erring footsteps. &#8212; Is this to last for 
ever &#63; Is this indifference to have no end &#63; Is there never to be 
harmony among us to effect jointly measures for public benefit&#63; 
How long shall the spectacle be witnessed&#44; that the good which 
one proposes is to be thwarted by the folly of another : and 
that the good of our scattered congregations is to be lost sight 
of&#44; because those whose business it is will not meet and discuss 
in friendship and concert the necessary measures &#63; &#8212; Believe 
me&#44; brethren&#44; that there exists a great mass of evil &#59; but it can 
be removed&#44; when once we are anxious to effect a reformation&#44; 
and when we are truly conscious of our errors. &#8212; Repentance 
and changes&#44; even great ones&#44; are within the compass of proba&#8211; 
bility&#44; and of this too the Bible speaks. A remarkable instance is 
found in the king Josiah&#44; as we read in the Haphtorah of to&#8211; 
day. His father and grandfather had been excessively sinful&#44; 
and their abominations had filled the land with wickedness. 
Josiah was very young when he became king &#59; but no sooner 
was he made conscious of the sins he was unwittingly com&#8211; 
mitting&#44; than he returned in truth to the Lord &#59; and did&#44; not like 
Pharaoh of Egypt&#44; who spoke : &#34;Who is the Lord &#63;&#34; and who 
refused to obey the prophet&#39;s mandate to let Israel go free &#59; 
but like his ancestor David&#44; who submitted to the decree of 
God&#44; whom he had offended. The Passover in commemoration 
of the Exodus had for years been neglected &#59; but now Josiah 
restored it in all its former splendour&#44; and he purified the 
land of the images which filled it. &#8212; Of him too it is said&#44; 
2 Kings&#44; xxiii. 25: 

&#34; And like him there was before no king&#44; who returned unto the Lord 
with all his heart&#44; with all his soul&#44; and with all his might&#44; like all the law 
of Moses&#44; and after him arose none other.&#34;

182 THE SPIRIT OF THE AGE. 

Here we see that a son of a wicked king&#44; and who surely 
did not lack those who would have ministered to his vices&#44; was 
truly repentant and followed the law. Let such an example 
not be lost upon us. True&#44; the spirit of the age is avarice &#59; let 
us&#44; who are of the house of Israel&#44; resist it &#59; let us in our en&#8211; 
deavour to obtain a living not overstep the legitimate bounds &#59; 
and if riches should be found unattainable with a strict adher&#8211; 
ence to the law&#44; then let us prefer to be poor&#44; let us then enrich 
our souls though we be humble. Thus many of our forefathers 
became the great ones of the earth &#59; thus they earned them&#8211; 
selves imperishable fame&#44; better far than gold and silver &#59; and 
thus too can we all arrive at that glorious state&#44; that we can 
depart this life and leave not one behind to curse our name&#44; and 
be assured&#44; that there will be many who will honour our memory 
and bless the day that we were permitted to see the light of the 
world. 

Do Thou&#44; our Father&#33; grant us thy salvation&#44; and remove 
from our bosom the heart of stone&#44; and give us the heart of 
flesh which Thou hast promised &#59; so that we all may serve 
Thee&#44; and deserve thy favour which is unending. Amen. 

Note. &#8212; This Discourse should properly he the forty&#8211;eighth&#44; in order of 
time &#59; but it is inserted in this place to allow the seven lectures on the Mes&#8211; 
siah to follow each other consecutively.

DISCOURSE XLIV. 

THE MESSIAH. 

OUR God and Lord&#33; through the mouth of thy prophets 
Thou hast promised hope and salvation to thy people&#44; and hast 
announced unto them&#44; that they should ever find in Thee pro&#8211; 
tection and salvation. Do Thou&#44; therefore&#44; now display over 
us thy almighty power&#44; and manifest towards us thy wonder&#8211; 
ous deeds&#44; that the gentiles may not say: &#34;Where is&#39; their 
God.&#39;&#39; But let them see&#44; and let them feel&#44; that oppress and 
deride thy children&#44; that Thou art the Lord&#44; and that thy 
reign extends from the beginning to the consummation of all 
created things&#44; and that for ever and ever Thou art God. 
Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

Often&#44; doubtlessly&#44; has the subject of the advent of a Mes&#8211; 
siah been urged upon your attention&#44; both by Israelites and those 
who are of a different persuasion. Full often&#44; too&#44; has this subject 
been learnedly and ably handled by controversial writers and 
oral disputants &#59; and&#44; nevertheless&#44; professed believers in reve&#8211; 
lation are nowise agreed as to the nature of the Messiah&#44; nor 
the object and intent of his mission. Still&#44; because the doctrine 
of the coming of this peculiar favourite of God is so vitally 
important&#44; it is absolutely necessary to endeavour to obtain 
some correct idea concerning him&#44; despite of the many erro&#8211; 
neous and generally false notions and doctrines&#44; promulgated 
chiefly by persons interested in maintaining views materially 
differing from ours. &#8212; Let us elucidate&#44; first&#44; the nature of the 
Messiah by the light which Scripture&#44; the only true test&#44; afibrds&#44; 
and next&#44; we must by the same rule trace out the extent and 
scope of his mission. 

Our opponents aver that the deity is of a divided nature&#44; that 
is to say&#44; that although God be one&#44; there still exists a modi&#8211; 

    <pb n="483"/>

184 THE MESSIAH. 

fication in this oneness&#44; to use an expressive word&#44; which per&#8211; 
mits God to divide himself into god and man&#59; or in other words&#44; 
one part of the deity could&#44; and at one time did&#44; invest himself 
with all the attributes of humanity and mortality&#44; whilst the 
other portion retained the divine attributes and the superin&#8211; 
tending power over all nature&#44; and even over the other portion 
of himself which had become man. All this was done&#44; because 
in the fall of Adam all mankind are averred to have earned 
everlasting condemnation &#59; and therefore it is contended&#44; that 
to insure them salvation&#44; God himself had to descend into the 
body of the seed of the woman &#40;Eve)&#44; to be enabled&#44; by the as&#8211; 
sumption of the human form&#44; to offer himself an atonement for 
the sins of mankind to the other portion of the deity not invested 
with humanity. From all which it would appear to be the opi&#8211; 
nion of the sect alluded to&#44; that&#44; to be able to effect the salvation 
of man&#44; God had to sacrifice himself to himself to make it possi&#8211; 
ble for him to save&#44; unto happiness and salvation&#44; the creatures 
whom he had formed for happiness and salvation. This incar&#8211; 
nation of the deity moreover&#44; which it is alleged was to be&#44; 
and actually was sacrificed for the sins of man&#44; they call Christ&#44; 
or Messiah&#44; which rendered into the vernacular tongue&#44; means 
the anointed chief or priest&#44; appointed to this station by having 
been consecrated with oil&#44; by anointing with which priests and 
chiefs among us used to be appointed. In short&#44; they say that 
the Messiah whom the prophets foretold was to be a god&#44; and 
a portion of the deity&#44; that through him alone the salvation of 
all men was to be effected&#44; and that lastly&#44; this personage&#44; 
or to use their term&#44; this divine personage&#44; has made his appear&#8211; 
ance already&#44; and that&#44; therefore&#44; the prophecies alluding and 
referring to a redeemer to be sent have been already accom&#8211; 
plished. I believe&#44; brethren&#44; that I have stated to you&#44; with 
as much candour and fairness as I was able to summon&#44; the 
nature&#44; attributes&#44; and scope of the Nazarene doctrines&#44; which 
I did&#44; in order to lay before you a concise view of our ideas on 
the same subject&#44; and to prove&#44; how they are deducible and 
strengthened by the plain import of the text of Holy Writ. &#8212; 
First&#44; we contend that the everblessed God is not capable of 
division or change &#59; and&#44; secondly&#44; we maintain that nowhere 
is there even a remote allusion to prove the necessity of the 

    <pb n="484"/>

THE MESSIAH. 185 

intervention of a mediator to insure salvation. &#8212; God&#44; according 
to our opinion&#44; is infinite&#44; immeasurable&#44; and indivisible &#59; that 
is to say&#44; we have no conception of the period when his exist&#8211; 
ence began&#44; nor can we conceive any possibility of his ceasing 
to exist&#59; immeasurable we call Him&#44; because the immense 
extent of space is not able to hold Him&#44; He does not exist 
in the world&#44; but the world exists in&#44; as well as through Him &#59; 
and indivisible we believe Him&#44; because no material body can 
separate Him into parts&#44; no walls can bar Him out&#44; no seas can 
withstand Him&#44; and no darkness can screen us from his presence. 
And thus also we are taught in the one hundred and thirty&#8211; 
ninth Psalm : &#34; Whither shall I go from thy spirit&#63; and whither 
shall I flee from thy face&#63; If I ascend to heaven&#44; Thou art 
there&#44; and if I should lie down in the deep&#44; I should find 
Thee.&#34; The whole of this eminently beautiful&#44; devotional 
Psalm must be familiar to you&#44; and it is therefore enough to 
refer you to it&#44; for the sake of proving that the Bible&#8211;doctrine 
of the Deity is an entire omnipresence and a perfect indivisi&#8211; 
bility. &#8212; Now&#44; what can be meant by the idea of god father and 
god son&#44; but that the divine essence is divided into two and 
distinct persons&#44; of whom one must of necessity have the 
priority of existence &#63; For&#44; grant that the existence of both is 
coeval&#44; or that they were always co&#8211;existent&#44; then it must 
follow that there are two independant powers &#59; for&#44; if one of 
the persons be more powerful than the other&#44; how can there be 
harmony and concert &#63; or even grant this&#44; on account of the 
perfection of the divine nature&#44; it yet is left to be determined&#44; 
who of the two is the creator &#63; The absurdity of a divided 
deity is thus made perfectly manifest&#44; it being so completely 
disconsonant with common sense&#44; besides which the holy law 
plainly declares: &#34; Hear&#44; Israel&#44; the 
Lord our God is the sole eternal Being&#44;&#34; or according to the 
common version&#44; &#34;the Lord our God&#44; the Lord is one&#33;&#34; 
This certainly means that a plurality of the divine power is 
entirely dissonant with the doctrines of revelation. But&#44; say 
the Nazarenes : &#34; We do not say that there are two gods&#44; but 
that the father and son are one.&#34; Let us examine this doctrine 
also by the same standard we just now adopted. The father&#44; I 
presume&#44; we must suppose to be the creator of all&#44; and conse&#8211; 

16&#42; 

    <pb n="485"/>

186 THE MESSIAH. 

quently the elder power&#44; and of course the son&#44; as well as 
every thing else in nature&#44; is a creature or an emanation from 
the creator. If you admit this&#44; and you must come to this at 
last&#44; then&#39; it follows that God has at one time or the other 
divested himself of a portion of his power and conferred it 
upon another personage &#59; or worse&#44; that He has divided himself 
into two or perhaps more parts. But independantly of the 
entire unintelligibleness of such an opinion&#44; it is contradicted 
by&#39; the plain letter of Scripture&#44; which says&#44; Isaiah xlii. 8 : 
&#34; I am the everlasting One&#44; this is my name&#44; and my glory to 
any other I will not give&#44; nor my praise to images.&#34; Ibid&#44; 
xliii. 10&#8211;12 : &#34; You are my witnesses&#44; says the Lord&#44; and my 
servant&#44; whom 1 have chosen &#59; that you may know&#44; and believe 
me&#44; and understand that I am He &#59; before me no god was 
formed&#44; and after me there will be none. I&#44; only I&#44; am the 
Lord&#44; and there is none beside me a saviour. I have myself 
told&#44; and saved&#44; have caused you to hear&#44; and among you was 
no stranger god &#59; and you are then my witnesses&#44; says the 
Lord &#8212; and I am God.&#34; Ibid. xliv. 6 : &#34; Thus says the Lord&#44; 
Israel&#39;s King and his Redeemer&#44; the Lord of the universe : I 
am the first&#44; and I am the last&#44; and without me there is no 
god.&#34; Verse 24 : &#34;I am the Lord who make all &#59; who spread 
out the heaven by myself&#44; and alone extend the earth.&#34; And 
in this same manner also speaks Jeremiah x : &#34;But the Lord 
God is truth. He is the living God and the everlasting King &#59; &#8212; 
Yes&#44; thus ye shall say to them&#44; the gods that made not the 
heaven and the earth shall perish from the earth and from 
beneath these heavens.&#34; All these passages&#44; which could be 
fortified by innumerable others&#44; clearly demonstrate&#44; that the 
God of the Bible is not of a divided nature&#44; but of simple 
essence and of eternal duration. What are the words we have 
quoted : &#34; I am the first&#44; and I am the last&#44; and without me 
there is no God&#63;&#34; This verse surely means to say&#44; that the 
Creator God is alone the King and Redeemer&#44; for besides Him 
no other god exists : how then can there be a second personage 
to share the honours of the Supreme &#63; How can reason bear 
it&#44; to assert in one phrase that one God alone does all&#44; and 
claims all the honour of worship&#44; and in another moment to 
maintain that&#44; nevertheless&#44; there are two parts composing the 



I

THE MESSIAH. 187 

same one&#44; both claiming and deserving the same regard and 
adoration &#63; &#8212; We could carry this argument out to a much 
greater length&#44; but it is not expedient to treat the subject in a 
controversial light&#44; any further than to exhibit to your under&#8211; 
standing the absurdity and the contradiction to revelation which 
are presented in the idea of a plurality in the deity&#44; or of a 
division in the divine essence. From all the above we must 
deduct&#44; as a natural consequence&#44; that Messiah cannot be god&#44; 
since that would say&#44; in effect&#44; that God himself is the Messiah&#44; 
or that a portion of himself were the Messiah&#44; both of which 
doctrines have been shown to be fallacious. &#8212; In the second 
place&#44; especially with reference to the object of the sending 
of this messenger&#44; he is not to come to save sinners&#44; much 
less to die in atonement for them&#44; because we believe&#44; and 
can prove&#44; that God requires no assistance to enable Him 
to save the man whom He has created. Where tirst the 
idea of a vicarious sacrifice took its rise we are not able to 
determine&#59; but of one thing we are perfectly certain&#44; that not 
the most distant allusion is found in the Bible&#44; which if 
rationally interpreted&#44; will bear an interpretation favourable to 
this doctrine. And let us take a calm view of the assertion&#44; 
that God could not forgive man for the original sin committed 
by Adam&#44; till a vicarious atonement &#40;for this I believe&#44; is the 
term employed) was made&#59; and what does it amount to&#63; but 
that God is unable to forgive sins&#44; which is a monstrous absur&#8211; 
dity&#44; even admitting that by the sins of our original progeni&#8211; 
tors we were debarred from all admission into happiness. But 
is this true&#63; By no means&#59; for as regards the first&#44; God emphati&#8211; 
cally styles himself the Forgiver of sins&#44; the Pardoner of in&#8211; 
iquities&#44; expressed in the two Hebrew words nbiD and hnn 
consequently He requires no one person or not any one thing 
to authorize Him to forgive&#44; if He&#44; the All&#8211;wise&#44; thinks that the 
atonement made&#44; or suffered&#44; or even contemplated by the sin&#8211; 
ner&#44; be enough. As also we read in Exod. xxxiv. 6&#8211;7&#44; &#34; The Lord 
Everlasting&#44; is a God merciful and gracious&#44; long of anger and 
great in kindness and truth&#59; He preserveth kindness unto the 
thousandth generation&#44; pardoning iniquity&#44; transgression and sin&#44; 
yet suffereth not guilt to pass unpunished.&#34; Here the words 
employed&#44; as plainly as words can speak&#44; distinctly announce 

    <pb n="487"/>

188 THE MESSIAH. 

that every sin will be visited with God&#39;s indignation&#44; that every 
sinner must be punished&#59; yet that&#44; nevertheless&#44; there is a 
remedy&#44; a return to righteousness&#44; a change of conduct&#44; which 
will cause God to show himself not as the Avenger of outraged 
righteousness but as the merciful Father&#44; who will bear with the 
fault of the child&#44; when he alters&#44; chastise with moderation&#44; and 
then forgive the guilt. This is so beautifully expressed by 
the word Niyj which originally means to hear&#44; to carry&#44; to suf&#8211; 
fer&#44; and thus it expresses the indulgent kindness of the Father 
of all more strongly&#44; than any other term implying forgiveness 
could have done. All this must tend to prove that the eternal 
Lord of all is of himself able&#44; without assistance or interven&#8211; 
tion&#44; to bear with and to forgive whatever sins may have been 
committed from nature&#39;s birthday to her dissolution&#59; He is&#44; 
indeed Si3&#39; Sd all sufficient and truly the almighty God&#44; 
able to effect everything&#59; and there consequently can be no 
being able to afford and grant him the slightest assistance. &#8212; 
Yet it may be said: &#34;True&#44; God is able&#59; but was He willing&#63; 
was not death decreed in consequence of Adam&#39;s sins&#63;&#34; To 
this we answer&#44; that death was indeed decreed&#59; but not death 
of the soul&#44; not the damnation of the vital principle&#44; but the 
decease only of what is naturally mortal&#44; when divested of that 
etherial spark which bestowed on it life and motion. Am I 
understood&#63; &#8212; Yet with regard to everlasting damnation having 
been the portion of every one that died before a given period&#44; 
it is absolutely contradicted&#44; not only by the spirit&#44; but by the 
letter of the Bible also. First&#44; nowhere in direct terms is it 
announced that a Messiah should come to redeem souls from 
purgatory&#59; and secondly&#44; we are taught that we have power 
over sin&#44; as God said to Cain: &#39;• If thou doest act well thou wilt 
be accepted&#44; but if thou doest not act well&#44; sin will rest at the 
door&#44; and to thee is his desire&#44; but thou canst rule over him&#44;&#34; &#8212; 
Here a direct dominion over sin is conceded to man. Further&#44; 
in Leviticus xviii. 5&#44; we read: &#39;&#39;And you shall observe may 
statutes and my judgments&#44; which a man is to do and live 
through them&#44; I am the Lord&#44;&#34; Deut&#44; xxxii&#44; 47: &#34; For it is 
not an empty matter for you&#44; on the contrary&#44; it is your life.&#34; &#8212; 
Solomon&#44; the wise king of Israel&#44; speaking of the divine wis&#8211; 
dom&#44; the fear of the Lord&#44; and the knowledge of the law&#44; says 

    <pb n="488"/>

THE MESSIAH. 189 

&#40;Prov. viil. 35): &#34;For he that finds me&#44; has found life&#44; and has 
obtained favour of the Lord.&#34; Chap&#44; ix&#44; 11: &#34;For through 
me thy days will be many&#44; and multiplied will be to thee the 
years of life.&#34; Chap&#44; iii : &#34; Long life are on her right&#44; on her 
left riches and honour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness&#44; 
and all her paths are peace. A tree of life is she to those that 
lay hold of her&#44; and her supporters are happy.&#34; In Ezekiel&#44; 
also&#44; chap. xx. we have a confirmation&#44; &#40;if any confirmation 
could even be needed to fortify the doctrines of the blessed 
Moses&#44;) in the following words: &#34;And I gave unto them my 
statutes&#44; and my judgments I made known to them&#44; which a 
man is to do and live through them. And also my Sabbaths I 
gave to them to be for a sign between me and them&#44; to show that 
I am the Lord that sanctified them.&#34; All these passages&#44; se&#8211; 
lected without any particular care from various books of Scrip&#8211; 
ture&#44; go far to prove&#44; that God in giving the Sabbath and the 
statutes&#44; contained in the law delivered from Sinai intended&#44; 
that their observance should insure life and happiness&#59; and 
unless any one can show&#44; what indeed some have asserted&#44; that 
the Israelites had no fixed idea of a reward and punishment 
hereafter&#44; it is also evident that salvation of the soul must be 
there included&#44; since no other requisite is ever spoken of or even 
alluded to. And that the Israelites knew of a hereafter&#44; can 
also be demonstrated by various scriptural passages&#44; all admit&#8211; 
ting of but one interpretation. When Abigail&#44; the wife of 
Nabal&#44; the Carmelite&#44; met David to dissuade him from his 
intended violence against her husband&#44; she said&#44; among other 
things: &#34;And a man rose to pursue thee and to seek thy soul&#59; 
but may the soul of my Lord be bound up in the bond of life 
with the Lord thy God.&#34; &#40;1 Samuel xxv. 29.) &#8212; In this passage&#44; 
the word for soul is used twice&#44; first&#44; with regard to the 
injury intended by the man Saul against David&#44; secondly&#44; in 
the blessing pronounced upon the latter. Though now the word 
Naphesh often means person&#44; yet the phrase ty£)J typn means to 
take life&#44; or to separate soul and body&#44; and consequently has 
then no material reference&#59; therefore&#44; when the word is used 
again in the next sentence&#44; it must needs bear the same mean&#8211; 
ing&#44; and refer then to the spiritual soul also&#59; or in other words&#44; 
Abigail prayed that the pious shepherd of Israel&#44; whom she 

    <pb n="489"/>

addressed&#44; might be found acceptable before the Lord his God&#44; 
and be ultimately rewarded by Him with life unending&#44; despite 
that now a man&#44; distinguished and great&#44; endeavoured to hunt 
him down&#44; and to seek his death. Also in the book of Psalms 
David expresses his hope of a glorious permanence in the fol&#8211; 
lowing glowing words: &#34; I will bless the Lord who has coun&#8211; 
selled me&#59; also in the dark nights when my thoughts oppress 
me&#44; have I placed the Lord ever before me&#44; for He is at my 
right hand&#44; that I cannot be moved. Therefore is glad my 
heart&#44; and it rojoices my glory &#40;the soul)&#44; and also my flesh &#40;the 
body) will rest securely. For Thou leavest not my soul to the 
grave&#44; Thou wait not suffer thy pious one to see corruption. 
Thou makest known to me the path of life &#59; the fulness of the 
joy is before thy face&#44; the pleasures on thy right hand are un&#8211; 
ending.&#34; &#40;Psalm xvi. 7&#8211;11.) Also&#44; in Psalm xxvii. 13 : &#34;Did 
I not believe to behold happiness from the Lord in the land of 
life.&#34; &#8212; The foregoing quotations must certainly tend to prove&#44; 
almost to demonstration&#44; that the Israelites had a perfect notion&#44; 
and a beautiful one too&#44; of the true happiness which awaits the 
righteous&#44; and that they expected to reach this happiness 
through a righteousness founded upon the execution of the so 
much undervalued observance of the tenets of the Mosaic reli&#8211; 
gion. If now&#44; as it must be evident&#44; happiness and life could 
be reached through these means at the time of the prophets&#44; it 
is apparent&#44; that&#44; unless a limitation had been mentioned&#44; the 
same means now must produce&#44; and this inevitably so&#44; the same 
results &#59; or to state the matter so as the offer an answer to the 
objection raised&#44; that God is willing and able to save mankind 
unto salvation&#44; without the intervention of a mediator or a 
vicarious sacrifice to be offered up as an atonement for the ori&#8211; 
ginal sin of Adam&#59; since a man&#39;s own righteousness&#44; based upon 
an observance of the law of God&#44; is enough to save him. By 
this&#44; however&#44; we do not mean to say&#44; that any man can set 
up a measure or a quantity of righteous deeds&#44; beyond which 
he need not go to insure the desired happiness &#59; but that&#44; if a 
man has done all in sincerity and truth&#44; that ever was in his 
power of accomplishing&#44; he will doubtlessly receive the favour 
of that Being&#44; whom in sincerity he has endeavoured to wor&#8211; 
ship. Consequently&#44; the doctrine maintained by us cannot be

charged with the defect of a tendency to render us proud and 
careless&#59; but&#44; on the contrary&#44; it will cause us to be circumspect 
and humble&#44; since by these means alone&#44; we will be induced 
to make exertions to obtain the favour of the Lord&#44; which to 
do has been placed altogether within our power&#59; for&#44; in addi&#8211; 
tion to the gift of a rational soul&#44; our God and King gave us 
his law for our government&#44; by doing which a man may live 
virtuously and reach life and happiness. 

In the foregoing&#44; it has been briefly shown&#44; that the Deity is 
not divisible&#44; and that&#44; consequently. He never could have been 
divided &#59; add to which&#44; that God is a pure spirit&#44; not liable to 
change or decay&#44; not visible to&#44; nor tangible by the senses : and 
it must be conceded&#44; that the divine essence&#44; or God himself&#44; 
never could have been inclosed within a mortal body&#59; for to 
have thus been mixed up with mortality would have rendered 
the godhead liable to change&#44; death&#44; and corruption &#59; and then 
the deity&#44; while on earth in such a body&#44; must have been tan&#8211; 
gible&#44; material&#44; and visible to the eyes&#59; and does not the pro&#8211; 
phet say : &#34; And to whom will you compare God&#44; and what 
form will you liken to Him&#63;&#34; &#40;Isaiah xl. 19.) But even let this 
pass&#59; still if this personage did actually appear&#44; and actually 
was slain ignominiously to effect an atonement for mankind : 
what need is there for any exertion to live virtuously&#44; since a 
complete atonement must have been made&#63; And if it is con&#8211; 
tended&#44; that the death of the Messiah was only to remove the 
disability to happiness which before existed : then we ask&#44; what 
was the state of the righteous of former times&#63; were they 
saved or not&#63; if the first&#44; how could they be happy with the 
original sin unatoned for&#63; and if the last&#44; how could God give 
them a law&#44; which after all could not satisfy his indignation &#63; 
But pass over this objection also&#44; as more ingenious than .solid : 
yet we may ask&#44; what are men of the present day to do to 
obtain felicity after once their disability has been removed &#63; 
what law are they to obey&#63; Our opponents do not say that 
our law is to be followed&#59; and yet we may boldly say&#44; that they 
have none of divine origin to oflfer in its stead. The Messiah 
is acknowledgedly but an agent&#44; even grant him to be a part of 
the Deity&#59; and what right has he then to abrogate the old&#44; and 
institute a new law &#63; And even grant this also : still the ques&#8211;

tion recurs&#44; where is the new code&#44; where is the public legis&#8211; 
lation&#44; where is the evident manifestation of divine glory&#44; like 
the glorious descent on Sinai &#63; The doctrines&#44; in short&#44; of the 
incarnation&#44; of the vicarious atonement&#44; and of the new reli&#8211; 
gion in all its modifications&#44; are all obnoxious to the objections 
just indicated &#59; and although so briefly stated&#44; yet the demon&#8211; 
strations and proofs drawn from Holy Writ&#44; faithfully and 
honestly drawn&#44; must convince every Israelite&#44; and to these 
alone I address myself&#44; that the doctrine of a plurality in the 
divine Author of all&#44; is blasphemous &#59; that the doctrine of an 
incarnation is incompatible with the nature of God as pro&#8211; 
nounced through the mouth of the prophets &#59; that the doctrine 
of an appeasing offering being requisite to satisfy God&#44; and to 
enable Him to save mankind&#44; when otherwise He would not 
be able&#44; is unsupported and contradicted by Scripture&#44; since 
God always announces himself as the only Redeemer and Sa&#8211; 
viour&#44; from whom all redemption proceeds&#44; and that all beings 
act under Him and ruled by his guidance &#59; and by inference as 
well as by direct argument we have arrived at the conclusion&#44; 
that God is one and alone&#44; without division&#44; without similitude &#59; 
uncorporeal&#44; therefore&#44; untangeable&#44; and immortal&#59; that He has 
never delegated his power to any other being&#44; and without this 
no other power equal to Him can exist&#59; that He has never 
doomed man to utter hopelessness&#44; but that He has establish&#8211; 
ed statutes and ordinances which&#44; when observed&#44; will lead to 
happiness&#44; here and hereafter &#8212; In illustration of this&#44; we read 
further in Isaiah &#40;xli. 4) : 

&#34; Who effected and did this &#63; who called forth the generations from the 
beginning 1 I the Lord&#44; the first&#44; and with the latest&#44; I am the same.&#34;  

These predicates and attributes belong but to the One&#44; before 
whom walked our patriarch Abram&#44; whom God called out from 
Ur in Chaldea&#44; that he might become a shining light to those 
that dwelt in darkness &#59; no other being there exists that shareth 
his glory&#44; and none ever will be&#44; our God &#33; who will rule

with Thee&#44; none can ever exist to whom Thou canst be com&#8211;

THE MESSIAH. 

In thy name may thy people be blessed&#44; and may their suf&#8211; 
ferings be removed by thy mercy&#59; and do Thou cause those 
that are captives in the whole world&#44; thy earth&#44; to be gathered 
together on thy holy moantain&#44; to serve Thee there&#44; according 
to the commands of thy law&#59; and may thy servant be speedily 
sent to rule and guide them&#44; as the shepherd governs his flock. 
Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 
On the subject of Messiah&#44; which was lately offered to your 
consideration&#44; it was exhibited to you&#44; that&#44; according to the

doctrines which are obviously deducible from Scripture&#44; the 
person promised to be sent is not to be a divinity&#44; nor if he 
were&#44; would it be necessary for him to atone for the sins of 
the world. This argument was considered necessary to prove&#44; 
that there was no intention to predict the advent of a being 
whose nature should be differing from man&#39;s&#44; and whose actions 
should have the effect of reconciling the indignant and offended 
Creator to his creatures. It will not be denied&#44; that the idea 
of a god coming down full of love and compassion&#44; and assum&#8211; 
ing a nature and appearance foreign to him to work an entire 
change in the regulation and economy of the world&#44; is a highly 
poetical one&#59; but&#44; nevertheless&#44; it cannot become a matter of 
faith&#44; one to found our belief upon&#44; if it at all clashes with the 
sublime truths of the holy law&#44; which was given to us to be as 
it were the guide and instructor for every thing relating to the 
divine nature &#40;if I may make use of so profane a word) and to 
the divine economy&#44; and to the conduct of God towards man&#44; 
the chief and best work of his hands. In no part of the canon 
of our Bible does it say&#44; that a deity should be delegated&#44; in 
no one verse is it taught irl so many words that the Deity who 
spoke through the prophets would cause a division in Himself 
to ensue&#44; and in no one passage does it say&#44; that there can be 
no salvation except through the death of such a messenger. &#8212; 
The idea&#44; in short&#44; notwithstanding its poetical beauty&#44; is no 
scriptural idea&#44; but an invention of heathen poets&#44; whose works 
teem&#44; full of reports of incarnations&#44; and of bodily appearances 
of divinities on the earth&#44; and of divisions of the gods&#44; and of 
progenies and children of these gods&#44; some of whom were classed 
among the immortals&#44; others again among those liable to change 
and corruption. &#8212; We cannot deny&#44; that many passages in the 
Bible have been tortured to show a delegation of the divine 
holiness to another &#59; but still we do maintain that without unfair 
reasoning no one passage bears a direct and evident interpreta&#8211; 
tion to this effect&#59; and&#44; inoreover&#44; we contend that&#44; were it 
that such were the faith upon which our salvation depended&#44; it 
would not have been indicated in obscure wording&#44; but in a 
direct announcement like the first precept in the Decalogue : 
&#34;I am the everlasting One&#44; thy God&#44; who have brought thee 
out of the land of Egypt&#44;&#34; where the evident words leave no 

    <pb n="494"/>

room for doubt or uncertainty. Much has been written and 
said on the subject of this our difference from other sects &#59; but 
the books and arguments are not accessible to many&#44; besides 
they are generally stated in too learned a way as to become 
generally useful &#59; I therefore&#44; propose to devote some little 
time to the elucidation of several texts&#44; before I proceed to un&#8211; 
fold our views of the nature and object of the Messiah. &#8212; At 
the same time&#44; I must do myself the justice to state&#44; that 
although I thus undertake to attack&#44; to a certain extent&#44; the opi&#8211; 
nions of the majority of the people among whom we live : it is 
not done for the sake of making a display of our own views to 
those entertaining contrary opinions&#44; but solely to instruct those 
among us who may entertain doubts&#44; or be not well informed&#44; 
on this subject&#44; as to what is generally thought thereof by Jews&#44; 
and to enable them&#44; in some&#39;measure&#44; to give reasonable answers&#44; 
when they are asked for the reasons of their faith. It is a long 
time already since these considerations were presented to rny 
mind &#59; but never&#44; until now&#44; could I resolve to speak of them 
in a public address. To be altogether silent &#8212; permit me to 
remark &#8212; would appear&#44; as though we Jews had not the courage 
to speak of things pertaining to our religion in our own assem&#8211; 
blies &#59; now&#44; although it is abhorrent to all correct sentiment to 
attack others&#44; or to wound their feelings in so essential a point 
as religion : still would that cowardice be much more blame&#8211; 
worthy which would prevent Jews from speaking of their 
own laws in their own assemblies&#44; in a country&#44; where equal 
rights are guaranteed to all the inhabitants by the consti&#8211; 
tution and the laws of the land. Whilst we&#44; therefore&#44; 
concede to every sect the right of temperately discussing 
any thing relating to their own and even to our persua&#8211; 
sion : we also claim and have the same right&#59; and&#44; if tem&#8211; 
perately exercised&#44; no one can&#44; and no one ought&#44; to com&#8211; 
plain. Complaisance and forbearance are&#44; truly speaking&#44; great 
virtues which ought to be strictly cultivated: but their exercise 
should never degrade them into the kindred vices of affected 
politeness and meanness&#59; and better far would it be were our 
mouths stopped by the violent arm of arbitrary rule&#44; than that 
we should surrender tamely to worldly expediency what we 
refused to yield amidst the heavy persecutions we had to en&#8211;

counter &#8212; I mean the right of honestly believing the truth and 
boldly expressing what we believe. And let me add&#44; that if 
we once submit&#44; and give up tacitly this precious right of ex&#8211; 
pounding our laws according to our received opinions: the 
enemies of Judaism have achieved a victory for which they 
have so long striven in vain&#59; as they have then succeeded to 
make the laws of God by degrees forgotten&#44; from us&#44; and the 
next step would then be of easy attainment &#59; for&#44; when our 
ordinances are forgotten&#44; theirs will be easily substituted in 
their place&#44; and Israel&#44; which God in his mercy forfend&#44; will 
have ceased to be a nation. But there lives that One above who 
will prevent such a calamity&#44; and that time will never arrive 
which shall witness the quenching of the glorious light&#44; which 
has been ordained the guiding star of all mankind&#33; &#8212; I fear 
that I have said already too much&#59; since no apology for the 
discussion proposed is necessary to justify myself towards 
any Israelite&#44; and I doubt whether any can at all be looked for 
by one who does not believe with us. Let us&#44; therefore&#44; 
without further preface&#44; proceed to the illustration of the 
various texts upon which our opponents rely as a justification 
of their doctrines&#59; and I have only to remark&#44; that I shall 
not go over the whole ground&#44; but merely select a few of the 
most prominent&#44; believing&#44; that it will be easy for any one 
to explain the Bible&#8211;texts to himself&#44; if he has been made ac&#8211; 
quainted with the interpretation of a few selected from various 
parts of Scripture. &#8212; Some persons have fancied that they could 
discover in the phraseology of the Bible an allusion to a plurality 
in the Deity&#59; among the rest&#44; the text in the first chapter of 
Genesis: &#34;And God said: We will make man in our image&#44; 
in our likeness&#44; and he shall rule over the fish of the sea&#44; and 
ovai&#39; the birds of heaven&#44; and over the cattle&#44; and over all the 
earth&#44; and over all the creeping things that move on the earth&#44; &#39;&#42; 
&#34;And God said we will make man&#44;&#34; is alleged&#44; refers to a 
plurality in the Deity&#44; say father&#44; son&#44; and ghost&#44; who con&#8211; 
sulted and agreed to make the creature called man after the 
image of God&#59; first&#44; in the nature and constitution of his soul&#44; 
and also&#44; measurably&#44; of the body&#44; since the son of god took the 
body of man&#59; secondly&#44; in his place and authority&#59; and&#44; lastly&#44; 
in his purity and rectitude. That a construction of the verse 

    <pb n="496"/>

THE MESSIAH. 197 

in question should at all be used to prove a plurality in the 
Deity is a matter of surprise&#59; but surely a consultation and 
agreement in the persons&#44; were any existing&#44; of the Godhead&#44; 
can in nowise be inferred. To the definition of the words 
&#34; image and likeness&#34; as just exhibited&#44; which&#44; by the way&#63; 
was given in the very words of a work in great authority 
among the Nazarenes&#44; we could make but little objection&#44; ex&#8211; 
cept with regard to the body of man having been dignified by 
an assumption of it by a part of the Deity&#44; which we deny as 
having taken place&#44; and&#44; consequently&#44; cannot think it implied 
under the words &#34; image and likeness.&#34; &#8212; It strikes me&#44; that the 
whole difficulty of explaining the verse we have quoted&#44; can 
be removed&#44; if we consider&#44; that the Hebrew&#44; as well as every 
other language&#44; I believe&#44; has words which have a phir a Korm&#44; 
yet are&#44; in their signification&#44; singular. Now&#44; in construing 
a word of this kind&#44; the writer may employ the verbs&#44; adjec&#8211; 
tives&#44; pronouns&#44; and nouns&#44; referring to it&#44; either in the sin&#8211; 
gular&#44; according to its signification&#44; or in the plural&#44; according 
to its form. The whole&#44; then&#44; resolves itself into a gram&#8211; 
matical construction of a sentence&#59; and if no rule of propriety 
is thereby violated&#44; and if the meaning is not rendered ambi&#8211; 
guous or uncertain&#44; the singular and plural both are employed 
in Hebrew alternately&#44; as can be shown by examples taken 
from the only remains of the Hebrew&#44; which are found&#44; as 
all know&#44; in the Bible solely. &#8212; The term D&#39;hSn&#44; which is com&#8211; 
monly rendered God&#44; is one of this class of words&#44; and has 
the appearance of a plural&#44; though actually a singular. Many 
reasons and explanations have been given why the plural form 
should be employed to designate the Deity&#59; but it must be ob&#8211; 
served that is not by any means the only name applied to God 
in our holy language&#44; but is one of the many which have been 
given to Him&#44; and is like them expressive of some particular 
quality inherent in Him. So we call Him nty Sn the All&#8211;sufficient&#44; 
because He is able to accomplish every thing which He may 
desire &#59; nii3 or Creator&#44; because He alone produced existence 
out of non&#8211;existence&#44; a material world out of nothing &#59; SiD&#39; 2 
the Almighty&#44; because his power is universal&#44; and his kingdom 
extends over all &#59; further &#39;7« God&#44; or&#44; more properly speaking&#44; 
the Power&#44; because to Him all power appertaineth&#44; and all to 

17&#42; 

    <pb n="497"/>

198 THE MESSIAH. 

Him is accountable. Many other names&#44; expressive of his 
glory&#44; belong also to Him &#59; but it is foreign to our purpose to 
enumerate them&#44; and we must therefore conclude the number 
by adding the last term by which He revealed himself to our 
forefathers&#44; and particularly to Moses&#44; the name which ex&#8211; 
presses his essence to be permanent&#44; ever being&#44; never ending &#59; 
profane lips&#44; like ours&#44; must not utter the ineffable word&#44; but it 
declares God as the eternal One&#44; who ever was&#44; ever is&#44; and 
ever will be&#44; without change&#44; without division. It will be 
perceived&#44; from an inspection of the Bible&#44; that not one of the 
names&#44; just enumerated&#44; is ever found in the plural either of 
termination or signification&#44; but always in the singular&#44; without 
a solitary exception. Now&#44; it appears to me&#44; if I dare to give 
an expression to my ideas&#44; without having the support of any 
commentator known to me&#44; that the word D&#39;vha is the plural 
of SkS in its signification of poiver&#44; and should accordingly be 
rendered the powers&#44; and as applied to God&#44; He in whom all 
powers are centred. To prove the plausibility of this inter&#8211; 
pretation is perfectly easy &#59; for the word elohim very often is 
applied to men to denote chief or judge&#44; either in singular or 
plural&#44; and also to false deities&#44; again either singular or plural. 
In fact&#44; whenever the word God receives suffixes in Hebrew&#44; the 
plural form is almost invariably adopted with but few exceptions 
To those who are unacquainted with the Hebrew grammar I 
offer&#44; as an explanation&#44; that those words&#44; which are termed in 
&#39;EingVish 2)ossessive pronouns&#44; or pronouns denoting possession&#44; 
are expressed in Hebrew&#44; not by entire words&#44; but by letters 
or syllables attached to the end of the word to which they 
refer&#44; and these so called suffixes are differently attached to the 
plural from the singular. I hope this brief explanation is 
sufficiently intelligible &#59; and assuming it to be so&#44; let us con&#8211; 
tinue the argument. The plural suffixes are used with the 
plural&#8211;looking elohim&#44; even if denoting a single idol&#44; as we 
read in the address of Jephtha&#44; to the king of the Ammonites 
&#40;Judges xi. 24) : &#34; Behold that which thy god ynSx Kemosh 
gives thee to inherit&#44; that only thou mayest possess&#44; and that 
which the Lord our God has driven out before us&#44; that even we 
will possess.&#34; In this passage no one can say&#44; with any show 
of reason&#44; that the word ynb« refers to any other than one idol&#44; 

    <pb n="498"/>

THE MESSIAH. 199 

since his name is mentioned&#44; namely&#44; Kemosh &#59; and when&#44; in 
the second part of the verse&#44; iJ&#39;nbN is used&#44; it certainly cannot 
mean any thing else save the one God&#44; not a plurality&#44; and 
refers therefore to the Lord Eternal&#44; whom the Israelites call 
their God. &#8212; Without one word more added to what has just 
been said&#44; the argument appears to me perfectly conclusive &#59; 
but we may carry the illustration&#44; for the sake of greater clear&#8211; 
ness&#44; a little farther. The plural&#44; in connexion with the 
Deity&#44; is used in but few other passages&#44; the whole number 
amounting to but six&#44;&#42; besides the one under consideration&#44; as 
far as I can recollect at the present moment&#44; and I very much 
doubt whether any more can be found &#59; and in explaining 
them we must be struck with the little authority they can give 
to a belief in a divided deity. &#8212; The first is in chap. iii. v. 22&#44; 
of Genesis&#44; immediately after the account of Adam&#39;s fall : 
&#34; And &#40;He) the Lord God said : Behold&#44; the man has become 
like one of us&#44; to know good and evil.&#34; Here &#34;like one of 
us&#34; is employed to convey the idea that man had acquired a 
superior degree of knowledge of good and evil to what he had 
before. Immediately thereafter we read&#44; that God placed angels&#44; 
named cherubim&#44; to guard the entrance of the garden&#44; to pre&#8211; 
vent the re&#8211;entrance of man. Is it not now more than probable&#44; 
that in the mighty assembly of his ministers&#44; who&#44; as the 
prophets say&#44; surround his glory&#44; the Almighty thus spoke : 
&#34; Behold man has now become like one of us &#40;here assembled) 
to distinguish between good and evil&#63;&#34; and it then means&#44; that 
Adam had actually reached that knowledge which the serpent 
had foretold to Eve&#44; saying: &#34;And you will become like 
elohim &#40;properly rendered divine beings or angels&#44; to distin&#8211; 
guish them from Adam or sons of earth&#44;) knowing good and 
evil.&#34; Adam and Eve had accordingly seen this truly verified&#44; 
but&#44; alas &#33; their innocence too had fled with their ignorance&#44; and 

&#42; Since writing the above&#44; I have found at least one more example of the 
kind spoken of in the text &#40;2 Samuel vii. 23)&#44; which however refers to an 
idol&#44; or any thing acknowledged as god&#44; and yet in the continuation the 
pronoun referring to it is used in the singular. &#8212; I do not recollect any 
more similar passages above referred to &#59; but I have no doubt&#44; that&#44; if any 
should be found&#44; the explanations given in the text will be enough to explain 
them. 

    <pb n="499"/>

they had offended God by seeking to dive farther than his 
command had permitted them. The doctrine of the plurality 
you will see is nowise benefitted by this passage &#59; for acknow&#8211; 
ledging that it is after all&#44; like the whole account of the 
temptation&#44; awfully mysterious&#44; since it refers to a state of 
things of which we can&#44; from our altered state&#44; form no con&#8211; 
ception : we may yet claim that our explanation bears the evident 
marks of orthodoxy&#44; which can be further proved by a 
reference to the vision of Micaiah son Yimlah&#44; which you can 
find in the twenty&#8211;second chap&#44; of the 1st Kings&#44; beginning 
with verse 19. 

The second passage is also in Genesis&#44; chap. xi. v. 7. Speaking 
of the building of the Babylonian tower&#44; God is represented 
as saying : &#34; Come on&#44; let us descend&#44; and let us mix there 
their language&#44; that one may not understand the speech of the 
other.&#34; If the explanation of the last quoted passage has ap&#8211; 
peared reasonable&#44; then this one must and ought to be similarly 
explained &#59; but after all it may be taken as a mere soliloquy of 
God&#44; expressive of his intentions. But&#44; if I may urge my views&#44; 
I would respectfully refer to where God&#44; in speaking imme&#8211; 
diately to Abraham of his intentions to subvert Sodom and 
Gomorrah &#40;Genesis xviii. 21 )&#44; says: •&#39; I will now descend and 
see&#44;&#34; where the singular is used&#44; because the person addressed 
being mortal could not become a party in the transaction&#44; nor 
be employed as the agent&#44; and God therefore simply announced 
to him the intention He entertained of&#44; as it were&#44; descending 
unto the regions of the earth&#44; and to investigate the reported 
misconduct of the cities of the plain. And when again we 
find God speaking in the heavenly council of his ministering 
seraphim &#40;Isaiah vi. 8)&#44; we read : &#34;And I heard the voice of 
the Lord saying : Whom shall I send&#44; and who will go for us &#63; 
and I said&#44; Here I am&#44; do Thou send me.&#34; &#8212; Has our interpre&#8211; 
tation been thus clearly established&#63; &#8212; I hope so&#59; but more 
amplification would show it better&#44; yet I am admonished by the 
time already consumed not to dilate too largely&#44; although the 
subject is&#44; to me at least&#44; so highly interesting. 

The third instance is found again in Genesis&#44; xx. 13&#44; where 
Abraham&#44; speaks of God having caused him to wander away 
from his father&#39;s house&#44; and uses the verb in plural&#44; which can 

    <pb n="500"/>

THE MESSIAH. 201 

be justified on the ground laid down&#44; that a noun having a 
plural termination&#44; though a singular meaning&#44; may have the 
verb agreeing with it&#44; either according to the termination or 
the meaning&#59; and if this is not satisfactory&#44; we may say that 
Abraham&#44; perhaps&#44; in addressing a heathen king who knew 
not exactly the true worship&#44; used the language customary in 
the country&#44; without thereby intending to convey the idea of a 
plurality in the Deity. At all events&#44; any arguments from this 
verse in favour of such a doctrine&#44; must be too far&#8211;fetched to bear 
any authority whatever. 

The fourth example is also in Genesis&#44; in the history of 
Jacob&#44; chap. xxxv. 7: &#34;And he built there an altar&#44; and he 
called the place&#44; &#39; The God of Bethel&#44;&#39; for there had appeared 
to him the elohim&#44; when he fled before his brother.&#34; Here the 
word elohim is again employed as a plural&#59; still&#44; this passage&#44; 
of all yet quoted the most favourable to our opponents&#44; will 
be found&#44; upon examination&#44; to afford them no tenable ground&#8211; 
For&#44; upon referring to the event alluded to&#44; we read in the 
account of Jacob&#39;s dream &#40;Genesis xxviii. v. 12): &#34;And he 
dreamt&#44; and behold a ladder was standing on the earth&#44; and its 
top was reaching heavenward&#44; and the angels of God were 
ascending and descending on it.&#34; What then did Jacob see in 
his dream at Bethel&#44; when he fled before his brother &#8212; a multi&#8211; 
tude&#44; or one being only&#63; &#8212; a multitude surely&#59; &#8212; but what con&#8211; 
stituted this multitude&#44; divinities or creatures&#63; &#8212; creatures surely 
although of the highest order&#59; and they were sent by God to 
comfort him in his trouble&#44; when sleep had weighed down his 
eyelids&#44; whilst he was reposing on the flinty rock for a pillow&#59; 
and among this host of ministers also appeared the Creator&#44; and 
in his own glory comforted and assured his servant by pro&#8211; 
mising him his protection. But does elohim mean angels &#63; 
certainly&#44; for after the angel had disappeared from the eyes of 
Manoah and his wife&#44; the former said : &#34; We must die&#44; for we 
have seen an elohim&#44;&#34; meaning an angelic being&#44; for immediately 
before we are told: &#34; Then knew JNIanoah that he was an angel 
of the Lord.&#34; And Manoah&#39;s wife too better informed perhaps&#44; 
at all events better judging&#44; answered: &#34;If the Lord had wished 
to slay us He would not have accepted from our hand burnt 
and meat offering&#44; and would not have let us see all this&#44; nor

at this time have suffered us to hear like that we have heard.&#34; 
&#40;Judges xiii. 21&#8211;23.) The explanation here attempted is per&#8211; 
fectly rational&#44; and will&#44; I trust&#44; be enough to clear away the 
seeming difficulty of this passage&#44; and the plural is then only 
used to refer to the multitude of angels that appeared to Jacob 
in his dream. 

The fifth example is found in Joshua xxiv. 19&#44; and constitutes 
a part of the address of this great leader to the Israelites before 
his death. He says : &#34; You may not be able to serve the Lord&#44; 
for He is the holy Gods.&#34; I have rendered the words Elohim 
kedoshim literally&#44; as though they referred actually to a 
plural number&#59; but who does not see that the singular
is fatal to the assumption of the idea of a plurality being actually 
entertained &#63; and&#44; to give a rational commentary&#44; we must say&#44; 
that Joshua emplo3&#39;ed again the grammatical license of con&#8211; 
sidering the word elohim both according to its nature and ap&#8211; 
pearance&#44; and therefore he uses the adjective in the plural 
to agree with the latter&#44; and the pronoun in the singular to 
refer to the former. 

The sixth example we have in Isaiah vi&#44; and has already 
been explained&#44; and I hope that conviction has been wrought to 
demonstrate&#44; that no reliance whatever can be placed upon an 
argument founded upon few plural constructions of the word 
Elohim&#44; especially as the doctrine plainly taught&#44; says that God 
our God &#40;Elohim) is one. &#8212; In addition to the foregoing&#44; it 
must be borne in mind&#44; that there are a number of other words 
in Hebrew &#40;like in most other languages&#44; as has been men&#8211; 
tioned already) that are used as plurals&#44; although having singu&#8211; 
lar meanings&#44; among which we may enumerate D&#39;J3 face&#44; Dni&#59;&#63;j 
youth&#44; D&#39;D water&#44; ury heaven&#44; and many others which&#44; having 
no singular form&#44; are always construed as plurals&#44; although 
often applied to individual things. The argument which has 
been drawn from the verse quoted from the first chapter of 
Genesis&#44; therefore&#44; appears so weak upon a calm review&#44; as 
hardly to merit a refutation &#59; but as it is so constantly repeated 
and pressed on our view&#44; I hope the time will not be considered 
by you&#44; my brethren&#44; as misspent&#44; which has been devoted to 
its overthrow. In dismissing this subject for the present I 
have only to add&#44; that but little exception would ever have been 

    <pb n="502"/>

THE MESSIAH. 203 

taken to the verse &#34; Let us make man&#44;&#34; had it not been&#44; that 
in accordance with the doctrines of the heathens the phirality 
of the deity had been promulgated by a people deriving their 
faith and their laws from our holy code&#44; only with such excep&#8211; 
tions as would tend to make them more pleasant and easy to the 
larger mass of Adam&#39;s descendants&#44; who might not wish to be 
bound down by abstract ideas and a multiplicity of ceremonial 
observances. &#8212; And of all the abstract tenets of our Heaven&#8211;born 
religion&#44; against which the heathens most strove&#44; and which 
was ever the most unintelligible to their besotted minds&#44; 
the belief in one God&#44; undivided and immutable&#44; must be pre&#8211; 
eminently distinguished &#59; since the very simplicity of this faith 
was to them quite incomprehensible &#59; for there&#44; when their 
priests most pretended to mysteries and secrecy&#44; our teachers 
were candid and open &#59; hence those of our nation&#44; who brought 
a reformed religion to these heathen&#44; retained a multiplicity of 
the deity&#44; whilst in conformity with their own belief they pro&#8211; 
mulgated the worship of the one God. 

The idea of a saving redeemer to die for the sins of the world&#44; 
the Nazarenes maintain&#44; is taught in Genesis iii. 15&#44; where we 
read as a continuation of the curse upon the serpent : &#34; And 
enmity I will put between thee and between the woman&#44; and 
between thy seed and her seed &#59; he shall bruise thee in the 
head&#44; and thou shalt bite his heel.&#34; This verse is so explained 
to favour the idea of the atonement so often already alluded to: 
&#34; Enmity should arise between Satan or the devil&#44; who had 
entered the body of the serpent to tempt Eve&#44; and between the 
woman and her race &#59; still the seed of the Avoman&#44; meaning the 
god&#8211;man&#44; should ultimately overcome the power of Satan&#44; but 
he should thereby suffer the loss of his material life&#44; which is 
represented under the words of &#34; he shall bruise thy head&#44; and 
thou shalt bite his heels.&#34;&#8212; This explanation is according to 
the opinion entertained by a vast majority of the followers of 
the new creed &#59; a majority I say&#44; for there is among them a 
great multitude who differ very widely in their doctrines from 
the majority. But it needs not much sagacity to see&#44; that this 
mode of commenting would lead &#8211; to making the Bible&#8211;text 
mean any thing or nothing. If it is offered as a mere accom&#8211; 
modation of certain views to this or any other text&#44; we can 

    <pb n="503"/>

have but small objection to make &#59; for then it would amount to 
no more than seeking a parallel only in words whose obvious 
meaning is something very different &#59; and such fanciful con&#8211; 
struction can in nowise serve as argument. &#8212; But&#44; if the doc&#8211; 
trines so fancifully supported are forced upon us as of funda&#8211; 
mental importance&#44; and as proven by the holy Text: then&#44; indeed 
we must solemnly protest against any sueh assumption. &#8212; It 
must however be evident&#44; that the curse was levelled against the 
veritable serpent&#44; the so called snake&#44; which in truth now has 
the qualities denounced in the curse. How this serpent could 
have spoken and tempted our first parents is indeed more than&#44; 
I believe&#44; any man is able to tell precisely&#44; and we must 
reckon the whole account amongst those mysteries into which 
our research cannot fully penetrate. But we have the Bible as 
warrant for believing&#44; that allured in an extraordinary manner&#44; 
and greatly prompted by curiosity. Eve tasted the forbidden 
fruit&#44; and Adam by her tempted&#44; sinned with her. In his 
indignation&#44; coupled with mercy&#44; the Almighty called our 
parents&#44; who had forfeited their life&#44; to an account for their 
misconduct&#44; and ordained their punishment&#44; and also that of 
their original tempter. Before their sin there was no death&#44; 
and the lion slew therefore not the innocent steer&#44; the wolf 
devoured not the harmless lamb&#44; the kite&#39;s destructive talons 
dealt not death to the hen and her brood&#44; not in circling eddies 
pursued his prey the eagle&#44; nor in the cleft of the barren 
rock lay the coils of the poisonous viper. But sin changed 
the harmony of nature&#59; and the beasts of the field broke their 
truce with man&#44; and those that had hitherto been harmless and 
playful now strode abroad with the eager desire for slaughter&#44; 
armed with the voracious mouth&#44; with the sharpened talon&#44; or 
with the destroying&#44; withering fang: and thus the former com&#8211; 
panions&#44; and among them the tempting&#44; glowing&#44; beautiful 
serpent&#44; became the enemies and terror of man. Still&#44; though 
hated&#44; his dominion was not to cease over God&#39;s creation&#44; and&#44; 
therefore&#44; power was left him to crush the serpent&#39;s head&#44; lite&#8211; 
rally crush it&#44; although the latter was armed for deadly strife. 
Where in this is there any evident allusion to a redeeming 
Messiah &#63; We pause for an answer. Now&#44; we will even grant&#44; 
that in this denunciation of the tempter God had an allusion 

    <pb n="504"/>

THE MESSIAH. 205 

to the power of man over sin &#59; still&#44; what reference can that 
have to the Nazarene doctrine of a redeemer&#44; who is to be both 
god and man &#63; &#8212; And to illustrate&#44; that our view is supported 
by other texts in the Bible&#44; and that it is sin only which exposes 
us to the enmity of the beasts of the field&#44; but that virtue will 
remove the danger&#44; let us refer to the sublime Psalm&#44; written 
by the prophet Moses&#44; and the man who best knew the ways 
of God with man. It is in the Psalm xci. 10&#8211;13&#44; we read : 
&#34; No evil can befal thee&#44; and no plague can approach thy tent. 
For his angels He commands concerning thee to guard thee in 
all thy ways. On hands they must bear thee&#44; that no slone 
may hurt thy foot. On leopard and adder thou canst tread&#44; 
tread down the lion&#39;s whelp and serpent.&#34; It is thus seen that 
sin arms nature against us&#44; and by virtue we obtain peace &#59; and 
this is the doctrine which is taught also in Gen. iii. 15. 

The elucidation of these two points has unexpectedly detain&#8211; 
ed us so long&#44; that for to&#8211;day it will not be practicable to go 
through the whole important subjects in dispute&#44; and time&#44; 
therefore&#44; is left lis to speak of but one more. &#8212; In the blessing 
given to Abram&#44; when God ordered him to leave his father&#39;s 
house&#44; we read among others &#40;Genesis xii. 3) the following : 
&#42;&#39; And I will bless those that bless thee&#44; and him that curses 
thee&#44; I will curse&#44; and through thee all families of the earth 
shall be blest.&#34; Were any one to read this annunciation of 
happiness for the first time&#44; he never would imagine that any 
other than the Patriarch himself is spoken of&#44; and those imme&#8211; 
diately connected with him by family descent. But no&#44; this 
simple and obvious mode of commenting on the Text&#44; is not 
satisfactory to our Nazarene interpreters&#44; and they again make 
this passage also subservient to an announcement of the coming 
of their messiah. They accordingly say: &#34; That this crowning 
blessing refers to the messiah the divinity&#44; 1&#44; in whom only 
all that are blessed are blessed &#59; 2&#44; in whom all that believe&#44; of 
whatever family they may be&#44; are blessed &#59; 3&#44; in whom some 
of all nations are blessed &#59; 4&#44; since there are some blessings&#44; 
such as the new law propagated under his name&#44; which are 
common to all mankind.&#34; I again extract almost verbatim&#44; 
from the book of high authority already referred to&#44; and con&#8211; 
sequently the argument is fairly stated. Now we have no ob&#8211;

jectioii to admit that the Messiah whom we expect is to be the 
crowning blessing&#44; perhaps he also may have been alluded to 
in the promise made to Abraham&#44; as also our sages teach : &#34; The 
Messiah&#39;s name was created before this earth was made &#59;&#34; but 
that&#44; nevertheless&#44; Abram himself and all Israel his descend&#8211; 
ants are at least included&#44; is evident&#44; first&#44; from the very con&#8211; 
text of which the verse quoted makes a part &#59; secondly&#44; from 
the blessing given to Isaac: &#34;And I will multiply thy 
descendants like the stars of heaven&#44; and I will give to thy 
descendants all these lands &#59; and they shall bless themselves in 
&#40;or through) thy descendants all the nations of the earth 
&#40;Gen. xxvi. 4)&#59; and lastly&#44; from the portion read this day&#44; as 
the day&#39;s lecture : 

&#34; And thy descendants shall be as numerous as the dust of the earth&#44; and 
thou shalt spread out to the East&#44; the West&#44; the North&#44; and the South&#44; and 
in thee and in thy seed all the families of the earth shall be blest.&#34; 

Gen. xxviii. 14. 

Can any words more plainly say&#44; that the seed spoken of 
shall not be only one individual&#44; but a people&#44; a numerous 
people&#44; who shall proclaim the glory of God in the heathens&#39; 
lands&#63; And who are this people &#63; who but the children in the 
flesh&#44; as well as spirit&#44; of Abraham&#44; Isaac&#44; and Jacob&#44; to whom 
God made his covenant known&#63; &#8212; True&#44; these descendants now 
are despised&#44; their countenance is marred&#44; their wisdom slighted&#59; 
but who knows not that arrive will that bright day&#44; when in&#8211; 
deed their light will shine&#44; when from them teachers will go 
out and proclaim God&#39;s name to the far islands of the sea&#63; &#8212; 
The time is delayed&#44; because of our sins&#44; but come it will&#44; and 
then God will be declared One&#44; and his name will be One. 

Do Thou our Father&#44; hasten this time&#44; for to Thee are our 
eyes directed &#59; and do Thou comfort those that mourn for their 
sins&#44; and seek salvation in Thee only&#44; who art our Father&#44; 
King&#44; and Redeemer &#33; Amen.

DISCOURSE XLVI. 



THE MESSIAH. 



Remember us&#44; Lord &#33; in thy kindness&#44; and have mercy 
upon us the erring and scattered flock&#44; and raise unto us a shep&#8211; 
herd&#44; who shall guide us in thy holy name&#59; and send unto us a 
prophet who shall again instruct us of thy will. And cause us 
all to behold thy glory&#44; when Thou again wilt dwell before our 
eyes in Jerusalem&#44; thy holy city&#44; as in days of old and as in 
years of former times. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

If one were to form his ideas of prophecy from the vague 
assertions which are constantly hazarded respecting it: he 
would assuredly never arrive at any satisfactory knowledge 
concerning this great fund of divine wisdom&#44; which God in his 
kindness transmitted to us through a long succession of holy 
and inspired men&#44; who went out&#44; and spoke&#44; and wrought awful 
things&#44; by and through his sacred name and power. To believe 
every thing&#44; therefore&#44; which is alleged to be founded on pro&#8211; 
phecy would be to believe absurdities and contradictions innu&#8211; 
merable&#59; for the recklessness of false interpreters has dared to 
invade even this sanctuary of God and to fortify their errors and 
falsities by arguments deduced therefrom. It is accordingly 
the manifest duty of every Israelite&#44; who truly confides in the 
faith in which his forefathers believed&#44; lived&#44; suffered&#44; and died&#44; 
to arrive at a certain and fixed knowledge of the dogmas on 
which his belief is founded&#44; and to endeavour to attain a suf&#8211; 
ficient understanding of the sacred Text&#44; to be able at one glance 
to distinguish the false from the true&#44; the evil from the good&#44; 
the absurd from the reasonable&#59; in short&#44; ignorance of his 
religion and its tenets is&#44; in a Jew&#44; a positive crime&#44; which 
nothing but an inability to arrive at knowledge can in the least 

    <pb n="507"/>

208 THE MESSIAH. 

excuse. And in the same measure as knowledge derivable from 
instruction is difficult of access&#44; he is bound to search the Scrip&#8211; 
tures for himself&#44; and&#44; with an humble diffidence in his own 
power of discernment&#44; to proceed upon the principles which have 
been handed down to us&#44; and which are so widely and univer&#8211; 
sally disseminated&#44; fhat hardly any one&#44; called an Israelite&#44; can 
be absolutely ignorant of the whole of them&#44; unless he never had 
enjoyed the blessings of converse and intercourse with his bre&#8211; 
thren in faith. &#8212; It being thus admitted&#44; that every one ought to 
learn&#44; it follows as a natural consequence&#44; that every one&#44; capable 
of teaching&#44; should endeavour to disseminate the knowledge 
that is within him&#44; to propagate as far as in him lies&#44; and to 
perpetuate to the extent of his abilities&#44; the knowledge and the 
love of the truth&#44; which is at last the same with the knowledge 
and love of God&#44; since the God to whom Israel bend in submis&#8211; 
sion&#44; since the Lord whom we worship&#44; is Himself the truth. 
In furtherance of this object let us revert to the exposition of 
prophecies applied by our opponents to fortify their doctrines 
of the Messiah in opposition to ours. A variety of passages 
referring to the alleged plurality of the deity and to a saving 
redeemer have already been expounded&#44; and it has been shown 
that no literal explanation will warrant the doctrines drawn 
from them&#44; and a fanciful commentary can never&#44; and ought 
never&#44; to be taken&#44; or even urged as argument. The number of 
similar passages being very great&#44; it would no doubt be useful 
to go over the whole ground&#59; but it is time that a connected view 
should be concisely exhibited&#44; and the subject speedily closed&#59; 
I am therefore compelled to select but a few more&#44; and leave 
the remainder for some future and more fitting opportunity. To 
proceed however without further preface&#44; I must draw your 
attention to the fact that the Nazarenes of every degree have 
entertained as a favourite notion&#44; that the time of the advent of 
the Messiah was so distinctly pointed out&#44; that his appearance 
at a certain stated and fixed period was absolutely necessary to 
verify the predictions relating to him. &#8212; Predictions&#44; therefore&#44; 
have been selected&#44; and a multitude of arguments have been 
adduced to prove&#44; that they have been fulfilled to the letter at 
a certain given period in by&#8211;gone times. &#8212; One of the most 
favourite of this kind is found in Genesis xlix. 10 : 

    <pb n="508"/>

THE MESSIAH. 209 

which is rendered: 

&#34; The sceptre shall not depart from Judah&#44; nor the lawgiver from between 
his feet until Shiloh come&#59; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.&#34; 

The interpretation of this translation is so given by the Na&#8211; 
zarenes: The kingdom when once given to Judah&#44; which was 
accomplished in the person of David&#44; son of Jesse&#44; from 
Bethlehem&#44; should never depart from the tribe of Judah or 
from those immediately connected with it&#44; till the time that 
Shiloh shall come&#44; to whom the nations shall assemble&#59; but im&#8211; 
mediately before his coming the kingdom should cease&#44; which&#44; 
it is said further&#44; was accomplished at the accession of Herod&#44; 
of Edumean descent&#44; at the downfal of Hyrcanus the Second&#44; 
the last of the Asmonean princes. An.d very often indeed has 
this prophecy of Jacob been triumphantly advanced&#44; together 
with the assertion&#44; that&#44; since the Israelitish kingdom is extinct&#44; 
therefore the Messiah must have come. &#8212; But in answer to 
this bold affirmation&#44; even allowing that there should be no error 
in the common Bible&#8211;translation as adopted by all Nazarenes&#44; 
we must as boldly maintain that the alleged fulfilment tallies 
in nowise with the Text&#59; and&#44; strange as it may appear&#44; that 
an assertion of so many learned and philosophic men should be 
totally erroneous&#44; the fact is nevertheless so. In the first place&#44; 
if Jacob meant to say&#44; that Judali&#39;s descendants should always 
be the chiefs of the nation of Israel&#44; then the prophecy never 
was fulfilled &#59; for&#44; up to the time of David&#44; at least six hundred 
years from Jacob&#39;s departure&#44; there was no pre&#8211;eminent prince 
from Judah&#39;s tribe. But grant that the meaning should be&#44; that 
from the commencement of the kingdom it should never cease 
till the coming of the Messiah: then he ought to have come&#44; 
according to the most moderate calculation&#44; four hundred years 
before the alleged advent&#44; or according to some chronologisls&#44; 
six hundred years. For&#44; when Zedekiah was captured by the 
Chaldeans after his flight from Jerusalem&#44; the kingdom of Judah 
actually ceased&#59; and no history that I know of has left us any 
record&#44; that any other king from that family ever reigned&#44; even 
for one single day&#44; over the restored Jews&#44; including Judah 

IS&#42; 

    <pb n="509"/>

210 THE MESSIAH. 

Benjamin&#44; and Levi&#44; much less over the never hitherto restored 
kingdom of Israel. And to say&#44; that the rule of satraps under 
the Persian tutelage and dominion can be called the wielding 
of the sceptre implied in the prophecy&#44; is evidently using a 
standard of criticism not applicable to Scripture &#59; and&#44; further&#44; 
to say that the kingdom of the Asmonean princes&#44; who were 
descendants of Aaron&#44; and consequently not belonging to the 
tribe of Judah&#44; was also in accordance with the prophecy&#44; is 
perfectly absurd&#44; for the blessing was addressed to Judah only 
and not to Levi inclusive&#44; and therefore it is not possible to 
suppose that the fulfilment in the persons of Levi&#39;s descendants 
could at all verify the prediction with regard to Judah. And 
for that matter&#44; since Herod was a professing Jew&#44; as nearly 
all the people called Edumeans were in those days: he might 
have been included in the prediction according to the above 
latitudinarian exposition &#40;for&#44; according to our laws&#44; the pro&#8211; 
selyte is equal with the native son of Israel&#44;) if such an ex&#8211; 
planation had suited the Nazarene creed. If then this prophecy 
meant that Messiah must come as soon as Judah&#39;s sceptre be 
broken&#44; Zedekiah&#39;s flight ought to have been the time &#59; and 
therefore&#44; if the argument is good against our hopes of a 
coming Messiah&#44; it is good also against the belief of those 
differing from us&#44; as has been amply shown&#44; and I doubt whether 
evasions ever so subtle will be able to countervail the plain 
reasoning just exhibited. But&#44; it is likely&#44; highly likely&#44; that 
the common version is incorrect&#44; and accordingly a translation 
has been given by various persons of our people and those 
agreeing with them&#44; which gives the prophecy quite a different 
appearance&#44; and it is then perfectly reconcileable both to pro&#8211; 
phecy and history. The difference depends upon the meaning 
of the two particles o n&#59;&#42; which when united as one compound 
mean until that &#59; but &#34; by itself is often applied to de&#8211; 
signate eternity&#44; and should then be rendered with ybr et r &#59; 
and &#34;3 by itself means because&#44; foi&#44; inasmuch&#44; or&#44; in short&#44; 
is a particle denoting the consequence of an antecedent sentence. 
If then we sever these words and connect one with the first&#44; 
and the other with the second part of the verse&#44; it should be 
rendered thus : &#34; The sceptre shall not depart from Judah&#44; and 
the lawgiver not from between his feet &#40;that is&#44; from his de&#8211; 

    <pb n="510"/>

THE MESSIAH. 211 

scendants) for ever&#44; inasmuch as the Shiloh shall come&#44; and to 
him shall be the assemblage of the nations.&#34; If this interpreta&#8211; 
tion is correct&#44; and it is certainly perfectly reconcileable to the 
Hebrew &#34;&#34; idiom : Jacob meant to say&#44; that Judah should be the 
chief tribe&#44; whi&#44;ch indeed it was&#44; both in the number and the 
bravery of its men &#59; that from it should go out the rulers of the 
nation &#59; and that&#44; if ever through the means of transgressions 
the kingdom should be removed for a time&#44; the removal should 
not be everlasting&#59; for the king Messiah should arise&#44; to whom 
all nations are to assemble to learn of him the laws of God&#44; in 
which they are to walk&#44; and which they are all ultimately to 
obey. It would from this appear&#44; that the chief excellence 
which Judah was to have above his brothers&#44; over Reuben&#44; be&#8211; 
cause he had grievously sinned&#44; and over Simeon and Levi&#44; 
because by their headstrong violence they had grieved their 
father and done injustice to others&#44; and over the others because 
over them he had the right of prior birth&#44; was to consist in the 
descent of the Messiah from his family&#44; in whom the kingdom 
and the legislation were for ever to remain&#44; and who was to be the 
harbinger of peace and knowledge to all mankind. We merely 
wish to ask&#44; has such a personage&#44; uniting these qualities&#44; 
ever been known on earth &#63; and where then is the hopeless&#8211; 
ness which the world says is ours in looking forward for his 
coming: &#63; 

Having said thus much already in elucidation of this verse&#44; 
it is with extreme diffidence that I venture to offer views of my 
own on the subject&#44; especially as I am ignorant whether I am 
supported in them by others or not. &#8212; But trusting that the 
matter has also a considerable share of interest for you&#44; my 
brethren&#44; I will even continue&#44; and throw myself on your 
indulgence for detaining you longer on this point&#44; than may 
seem at first sight necessary. In looking over the Scriptures 
with reference to the doctrines of the Messiah&#44; I have been so 
struck with the extreme unity of agreement of the various pro&#8211; 
phets&#44; as to amount to astonishment. Much as I had read 
before&#44; often as I had studied the oracles of our faith : I yet 

&#42; The accent on n&#59;&#39; is a disjunctive&#44; which would evidently imply&#44; that&#44; 
according so the Massoratist&#44; it is not connected with the word &#39;&#39;D&#44;

found new cause for admiration over the extreme beauty and 
harmony discoverable in the scheme of revelation which we 
possess&#44; and I was filled with thankfulness&#44; that we have been 
permitted to inherit such a store of rich blessings&#44; full of wis&#8211; 
dom and consolation. Long before our times&#44; said a sacred 
singer : &#34; Had not thy law been my entertainment&#44; I long since 
would have perished in my misery &#59;&#34; and well may Israel 
collectively say now what the holy seer exclaimed in by&#8211;gone 
days&#44; when the spirit of prophecy was yet rife on earth. In 
judging therefore of any one passage which may be presented 
to us&#44; we must not judge of it as one isolated sentence&#44; but as a 
part of a great scheme&#44; with which it must&#44; and doubtlessly 
does&#44; agree. If then we even admit&#44; that the received version 
of the Nazarenes is correct&#44; it certainly will not militate against 
our religion. For&#44; the verse in question contains a two&#8211;fold 
promise &#59; of the scejjfre&#44; and the law&#8211;giver&#44; or rather law&#8211; 
dispenser. It would accordingly mean&#44; that both&#44; the kingdom 
and the dispensation of the divine law&#44; should never be at the 
same time taken from Judah&#39;s descendants&#44; up to the time when 
Messiah should hold universal dominion over the earth. And 
thus the kingdom conferred on Judah shall never cease &#59; 
and though Judah&#39;s immediate descendants did not at once hold 
the sway&#44; yet at a later period David was chosen&#44; and in him 
began the commencement of the fulfilment &#59; and with regard to 
the continuance thereof after a suspension &#40;understand a sus&#8211; 
pension&#44; but not an abolition) of the kingdom we have an ample 
account in the book of the prophecies of Jeremiah. Jeremiah 
lived during the reigns of the latter kings of Judah&#44; when the 
wickedness of the people had rendered them ripe for destruc&#8211; 
tion &#59; he was accordingly deputed to predict the death or 
downfal of three kings : Jehojakim&#44; Jochoniah&#44; and Zedekiah&#44; 
through the king of the Chaldeans&#44; Nebuchadnezzar&#44; After 
stating the utter subversion of the kingdom of Judah&#44; and testi&#8211; 
fying against Jochoniah that none of his descendants should 
ever rule over the land of Israel : he continues in chap&#44; xxxiii. 7&#44; 
as follows : &#34;And I will bring back the captivity of Judah and 
the captivity of Israel&#44; and build them up as at first.&#34; And in 
verse 14&#44; we read in continuation : &#34;Behold days will come&#44; 
saith the Lord&#44; when I will fulfil this good word which I have 

    <pb n="512"/>

THE MESSIAH. 213 

spoken over the house of Israel and over the house of Judah. 
In those days&#44; and in that time&#44; I will let sprout to David the 
sprout of righteousness&#44; and he shall exercise justice and right&#8211; 
eousness in the land. In those days shall Judah be saved&#44; and 
Jerusalem shall dwell in safety &#59; and this is the name which He 
will call her : &#39; The Lord is our righteousness.&#39; For thus 
saith the Lord&#44; it shall not be cut off to David a man sitting on 
the throne of the house of Israel. And to the priests the 
Levites&#44; there shall not be cut off a man before me&#44; who bring&#8211; 
eth burnt&#8211;offerings&#44; and sacrificeth meat&#8211;offering&#44; and prepareth 
sacrifices&#44; all the days.&#34; In the same manner spoke Hosea&#44; 
iii. 4&#8211;5 : &#34; For&#44; many days shall the children of Israel dwell 
without king&#44; without chief&#44; without sacrifice or altar&#44; without 
ephod or oracle. After this&#44; however&#44; shall the sons of Israel 
return and seek the Lord their God&#44; and David their king &#59; and 
they will adhere to the Lord and to his goodness in fear&#44; in the 
latter days.&#34; Also to David was said by Nathan the prophet 
&#40;2 Samuel vii. 16) : &#34;But thy house and thy kingdom shall 
stand for ever&#44; thy throne shall be firm for ever.&#34; These 
extracts will give us a convincing commentary on Jacob&#39;s pro&#8211; 
phecy&#44; and all tend to show that the suspension of the king&#8211; 
dom during the long&#8211;endured captivity does not indicate that the 
reign of Judah is over &#59; on the contrary that the time will come&#44; 
when the captives of Judah and Israel will all be gathered&#44; and 
over them shall rule the king David &#59; and to quiet the fears 
which some might entertain at the length of the captivity and 
the threatened extinction of David&#39;s line&#44; the Lord promised 
that never should that time arrive&#44; when there should be want&#8211; 
ing a man to David&#44; capable of holding sway&#44; for He distinctly 
stated&#44; at the very time that both kingdom and temple ceased&#44; 
when both chief and priest were banished&#44; that Aaron no less 
than David should always be blessed with capable successors&#44; 
ready and able to tread in their fathers&#39; footsteps. Although&#44; 
therefore&#44; the regular tables of descent have been lost in the 
long course of persecutions: there are yet numbers who boast of 
a descent from David&#44; and thousands there are&#44; whom the uni&#8211; 
versal voice of Israel hails as the offspring of Aaron&#44; the Lord&#39;s 
anointed&#44; and at all festivals the priestly blessings are dispensed 
by those who are sanctified with the commands given to the 

    <pb n="513"/>

214 THE MESSIAH. 

father of all the priests. &#8212; And lastly&#44; with regard to the law&#8211; 
givers and those to whom the law of God is familiar&#44; we may 
simply state&#44; that at no time has the lawgiver been removed 
from the feet of Judah &#59; for never yet was that time&#44; when the 
law had not its friends&#44; cultivators&#44; and expounders &#59; and in 
the same spirit spoke Isaiah&#44; lix. 21 : &#34;And my covenant with 
them is this&#44; saith the Lord : My spirit which is upon thee&#44; and 
my words which I have put in thy mouth&#44; shall not depart from 
thy mouth&#44; and out of the mouth of thy children&#44; and out of the 
mouth of thy children&#39;s children&#44; saith the Lord&#44; from now 
and for ever.&#34; This prediction has certainly been accom&#8211; 
plished &#59; and more yet&#44; the descendants of Judah are at the pre&#8211; 
sent moment constituting the greatest part of the Jews&#44; and 
moreover the descendants of David are not extinct : further 
the suspension of the kingly rule was according to the prophe&#8211; 
cies&#44; and to avenge the many crimes of the Israelites &#59; what 
contradiction does our belief then offer to the prophecy of 
Jacob &#63; or rather are not our hope&#44; and our belief&#44; and the fore&#8211; 
telling of our prophets of a later period confirmatory of&#44; and 
conformable to&#44; and best explaining&#44; the closing inspiration of 
the dying Israel &#63; &#8212; Assuredly&#44; brethren&#44; and it requires a hardi&#8211; 
hood&#44; not very enviable in the possessor&#44; to assert&#44; that we are 
feeding on a vain hope and indulging a fruitless longing. &#8212; On 
the contrary&#44; our trust is firmly placed &#8212; placed on the word of 
Him who does not err&#44; and all whose ways are just and true &#33; 

Having dismissed this subject&#44; although much could have 
been added which would have stronger confirmed our views of 
a redeemer yet to come : we will now turn to chapter xviii. 
of Deuteronomy&#44; beginning at verse 14. &#8212; We read there as 
follows: &#34; For those nations&#44; which thou shalt drive out&#44; listen 
unto observers of time and diviners &#59; but as for thee&#44; the Lord 
thy God has not suffered thee to do the like. A prophet from 
among thyself&#44; from thy own brethren&#44; like unto me&#44; will raise 
unto thee the Lord thy God&#44; to him ye shall hearken.&#34; 
When we consider to whom Moses spoke&#44; and what he knew 
himself to be: it is wonderful&#44; and surpassing strange&#44; how 
any one could apply so plain a passage&#44; not to a prophet&#44; but 
to a redeeming Messiah. And more wonderful still it is&#44; that 
the Nazarenes of every shade and complexion refer to it&#44; as a 

    <pb n="514"/>

THE MESSIAH. 215 

convincing argument&#44; in favour of their assumed theory. To 
enable you however to judge of the fairness of the interpreta&#8211; 
tion&#44; adopted by the people referred to. I will now lay before 
you an abstract of the favourite work&#44;&#42; already spoken of on a 
former occasion. These are the words: &#34; Some think it is the 
promise of a succession of prophets&#44; that should for many ages 
be kept up in Israel. &#8212; These prophets were like unto Moses&#44; 
though far inferior to him&#44; Deut. xxxiv. 10. &#8212; Whether a suc&#8211; 
cession of prophets be included in this promise or not&#44; we are 
sure that it is primarily intended as a promise of Messiah&#44; and 
it is the clearest promise of him that is in all the law of 
Moses.&#34; &#8212; &#34;Observe&#44;&#34; continues this writer&#44; &#34;what it is&#44; that 
is here promised concerning Messiah &#59; what God promised 
Moses at Mount Sinai&#44; which he relates&#44; verse 18&#44; which he 
promised the people&#44; verse 15&#44; in God&#39;s name &#59; &#91;1&#91; That 
there should come a prophet&#44; great above all the prophets&#44; by 
whom God would make known himself and his will to the 
children of men&#44; more fully and clearly than ever he had done 
before. He is the light of the luorld&#44; as prophecy was of the 
Jewish church. &#91;2&#91; That God would raise him up from the 
midst of them. In his birth he should be one of that nation. 
In his resurrection he should be raised up at Jerusalem&#44; and 
from thence his doctrine should go forth to all the world. &#8212; 
&#91;3&#91; That he should be a prophet like unto Moses&#44; only as 
much above him&#44; as the other prophets came short of him. &#8212; 
&#91;4&#91; That God would jjut his luords in his mouth&#44; verse IS. 
What messages God had to send to the children of men&#44; he 
would send by him&#44; and give him full instructions what to say 
and do as a prophet.&#34; &#8212; It is needless to extract any further&#44; 
having in the foregoing exhibited the entire strength of the 
argument. Now&#44; I am unable to perceive what we can lose by 
even admitting the construction thus falsely placed on Moses&#39;s 
prophecy &#59; for granting it perfectly correct and legitimate&#44; we 
might still say&#44; and aver&#44; that we expected the fulfilment as 
yet to come. But&#44; much as we might gladly refer this annun&#8211; 
ciation to the great messenger&#44; to whose coming Israel has ever 
looked forward with hope and with prayer : candour and truth

compel us to discard such an explanation &#59; since the whole 
context plainly shows&#44; that by the successors of Moses are 
understood those men&#44; who promulgated&#44; after the great teacher&#39;s 
demise&#44; the law and knowledge of God&#44; and to no one else. 
What was it the Israelites had asked at Horeb &#63; It was that&#44; 
not desiring any more to see themselves the glory of God 
evidently revealed&#44; fearing to die in case a public legislation&#44; 
like that on Sinai&#44; were repeated&#44; &#8212; they wished for a mediator 
to announce to them in future the will of God&#44; and that they 
would be willing to obey the commands thus given through an 
agent&#44; as much as those announced by God himself. God 
having once given them in his honour and glory the standard 
of the ten precepts&#44; upon which He wished to found the entire 
code of laws He intended promulgating&#44; was satisfied with this 
request &#59; He ordered&#44; therefore&#44; the people to return home to 
their usual occupations&#44; but told Moses to remain on the 
mount&#44; to be further instructed of the ways and will of his 
Maker. What&#44; now&#44; was the request of Israel &#63; not for a 
redeemer to save their souls&#44; or to go abroad to give light unto 
the heathens&#44; not for a mediator to die for their sins and to 
atone for the sin of Adam &#59; but simply for one or more per&#8211; 
sons&#44; human beings&#44; to let them know what was God&#39;s wish 
and will. In granting them this reasonable request&#44; the answer 
ought evidently be like the question &#59; and consequently God 
granted what the people asked : they asked for a teacher&#44; and 
a teacher was vouchsafed. Moses&#44; the first prophet in rank 
and holiness&#44; was the first deputed&#44; and not to leave the flock 
without a shepherd&#44; successors in the prophetic calling were 
promised &#59; and not only promised&#44; but also sent&#44; to further 
speak&#44; exhort&#44; teach&#44; and admonish in the name of the King of 
kings&#44; the God of Israel. And thus there were the warrior 
Joshua&#44; valiant and true &#59; the righteous Samuel&#44; who judged 
the people after the manner of Moses &#59; the king David who 
never forgot&#44; even when sunk through sin&#44; to return with prayer 
to his offended Maker&#59; and after him Elijah who never suffered 
the pangs of earth&#39;s dissolution &#59; the inspired Elisha who poured 
water on Elijah&#39;s hands&#59; Isaiah whose greatness of endowment&#44; 
fervour of piety&#44; and high descent&#44; alike mark him eminent 
among the holy of the earth &#59; again the ardent Jeremiah&#44; the man

of sorrow&#44; whose eyes beheld&#44; in the desolation of the holy 
city&#44; what Moses already&#8211; had foreseen &#59; and Malachi too&#44; 
the last among these preachers&#44; who again exhorted the people 
of the second temple to remain steadfast in the law given 
through Moses&#59; besides numerous others&#44; who all spoke in 
conformity with the law given through the father of all the 
prophets. And therefore we read in continuation : &#34;And it 
shall be&#44; the man who does not hearken to my words which he 
may speak in my name&#44; I will require it of him. But the 
prophet who shall be wicked enough to speak a word in my 
name which I have not commanded him to speak&#44; or who shall 
speak in the name of other gods&#44; this prophet shall die.&#34; &#8212; 
Moses therefore evidently speaks of messenger&#8211;prophets who&#44; 
being men&#44; may be liable to be sinful&#44; and not of a divinity who 
from his very nature should&#44; in reason&#44; be exempt from sin 
and falsehood. Besides we may boldly challenge the supporters 
of the above argument to produce that passage&#44; whei&#39;e it is said 
that a prophet greater than Moses was to be looked for &#63; on 
the contrary it does appear from the whole tenor of revelation 
that Moses was absolutely to be&#44; and for ever&#44; the greatest of 
his brethren&#44; as it is his law&#44; or rather the law called by his 
name&#44; and given through his agency&#44; which is to be the stan&#8211; 
dard of the truth or falsehood of any prophet. And even 
Messiah himself&#44; were he to appear this instant among us&#44; and 
were he to declare in so many words&#59; &#34; The son of man is lord 
even over the Sabbath&#8211;day&#44;&#34; or &#34; Eat&#44; for what I have declared 
clean do thou not call unclean&#44;&#34; we would be compelled to 
disobey&#44; for we should have to look on such an announce&#8211; 
ment as a temptation purposely put in our way&#44; by which we 
may be tried : &#34; Whether we love the Lord our God with all 
our heart and with all our soul&#34; &#40;compare with Deut. xiii. 4). 
No&#33; no prophet can of his own account&#44; not even by a direct 
message&#44; abrogate any part of the law or add any new precept 
to the same &#59; for the law having been publicly given&#44; and 
therefore not resting for confirmation on any miracles wrought&#44; 
cannot be abolished&#44; except by an equally public act of God&#44; 
similar to the descent on Sinai&#44; and no evidence short of this 
ought ever to satisfy us. &#8212; Now it will be apparent that&#44; when 

VOL. II. &#8212; 19 

    <pb n="517"/>

218 THE MESSIAH. 

Moses speaks of a prophet like himself&#44; he means one who is 
to announce his mission&#44; like he himself was wont to do&#44; with 
&#39;n ncN no &#34; Thus speaketh the Lord &#59;&#34; this can only apply to 
man and not to the Deity. Besides we also contend&#44; that the 
whole passage from the eighteenth chapter of Deuteronomy 
under question must refer to one class of persons&#44; as we cannot 
discover any break or want of connection in the whole message&#59; 
if then the first part refers to the Messiah&#44; the latter part must 
likewise do the same&#59; and can it be believed&#44; that the command 
should be to slay the Messiah&#44; in case he should speak falsely in 
the name of God &#63; can it be possible that of one so highly 
endowed it could be presumed that he should predict what 
would never happen &#63; The absurdity of an affirmative to these 
simple questions is too clear to require any further discussion &#59; 
and consequently the passage does not speak of one man but of 
an entire class&#44; such&#44; as said already&#44; were to be&#44; and actually 
did&#44; make their appearance on earth &#59; and the phrase like me&#44; 
does not then absolutely imply equals with Moses&#44; but only 
persons deputed in a similar manner to speak a message in 
God&#39;s name&#44; and protected by Him&#44; and instructed by Him. 
The prophetic office being thus established it was natural enough 
that wicked men would at times speak falsely in the name of 
God &#59; and tests were therefore established by which the truth 
or falsehood of prophecy could be established. &#8212; For a long 
period did these prophets follow each other in regular succession&#44; 
till the scheme of revelation was completed &#59; for Moses&#44; let it 
be understood&#44; was the instrument of the law&#44; and consequently 
in teaching all the duties was by no means to write down all 
the religious truths and doctrines. The last was accomplished 
more and more by every succeeding prophet&#44; till the whole 
was finished by Malachi &#59; after him the prophecy ceased&#44; or 
rather was suspended&#44; and in him we see the last spark of holy 
fire yet illuminating the earth&#44; before its light was hid for a 
long period&#44; after the announceinent of the Lamentations : 
&#34; Her prophets also found no revelation from the Lord.&#34; But 
we arc promised that the time will come&#44; when God will pour 
out his spirit over all flesh&#44; when our maidens and our youths 
will again receive the spirit of prophecy&#44; and when again the 
glory of God will be revealed as of old&#44; &#40;see Joel iii. 1&#44;) and

then indeed will be again fulfilled the promise made to Moses : 
&#34;A prophet the Lord thy God will raise up to thee from among 
thy brethren&#44; like unto me&#44; him ye shall obey.&#34; 

Lord&#44; do Thou accomplish this speedily&#44; and may we in

THE MESSIAH. 

OUR God&#44; and God of our fathers &#33; in thy just indignation 
Thou didst in former times hurl us out of our inheritance be&#8211; 
cause of our sins &#59; and Thou hast since then often caused ns to 
pass through fire and through water&#44; and given us rulers severe 
and cruel&#44; that we might be taught the difference between serv&#8211; 
ing Thee&#44; the merciful and holy One&#44; and of submitting to 
the yoke of oppressors and enemies&#44; whom our transgressions 
placed over our heads. And long has the captivity pressed 
down our spirit&#44; and we have remained dumb like the sheep 
before her shearers &#59; we have become an object of derision and 
of contempt to nations that are strangers to thy worship&#44; and 
we have been plundered by those who not yet have learnt thy 
service. But by thy holy name Thou hast sworn that not for 
ever should thy anger last&#44; and that Thou wouldst at one time 
remember the captives of Israel&#44; and restore them to their land &#59; 
and that again vineyards should be planted&#44; and fields killed&#44; 
in the deserted hills and wasted plains. may it then be thy 
will soon to fulfil the blissful promise&#44; and may the heart of thy 
servants be gladdened&#44; by the mercies which Thou wilt display

among them&#44; so that all nations may exclaim : &#34; Happy the 
people to whom the like has happened&#44; happy the people&#44; whose 
God is the eternal Lord.&#34; Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 
In reviewing the history of the world we must discover&#44; 
that out of every apparent evil some permanent good is pro&#8211; 
duced&#44; and if even individual suffering should be the conse&#8211; 
quence&#44; a public benefit will generally ensue&#44; apparent even to 
our own views&#44; to the imperfect vision of men&#44; who cannot 
thoroughly understand the reason and connection of things. 
This being admitted&#44; and who can doubt it&#63; &#8212; it is absolutely 
necessary to believe&#44; that every&#39; thing that occurs must be bene&#8211; 
ficial&#44; or in other words&#44; that every occurrence will be directed 
to a beneficial end by the Disposer of all. &#8212; If even then we 
see one nation disappear and another spring up from the ruins 
of the other&#39;s greatness&#44; we should not complain of the apparent 
evil &#59; for we may rest assured&#44; that the former having fulfilled 
the circle of its usefulness&#44; the new has taken its place as one 
better calculated to lead the way in the measure of improvement 
which the world requires. &#8212; It thus happened&#44; that Egypt 
flourished for a while&#44; nay&#44; Jacob went down there to fulfil his 
destiny of becoming the great nation&#44; and amid his powerful 
and civilized rulers he and his family grew up into a people 
mighty and distinguished. And when the Egyptians oppressed 
the strangers whom they had received as friends&#44; God&#39;s power 
was displayed&#44; and midst avenging judgments Israel was freed 
from Egyptian thraldom. Still&#44; Egypt was permitted to rule&#44; 
even as the instrument of punishment to the Israelites&#59; but at 
length it fell before the northern warrior Nebuchadnezzar&#44; who 
had trampled down the kingdoms and states of Central Asia. 
He swept like a whirlwind over the world&#44; and his path was 
over ruins of empires and the wreck of cities&#44; and even the 
holy temple was given into his hands&#44; and he broke the&#8211; walls 
of Jerusalem&#44; and led the people captives unto Babylon. &#8212; He 
had fulfilled his mission : when he was made to feel the awful 
greatness of the Lord&#44; and was taught wisdom from the mouth 
of God&#39;s servant&#44; and convinced that he had been but an agent 
in a great work&#44; the work of regeneration&#44; constantly progress&#8211;

ing to a fulfilment. &#8212; Nebuchadnezzar&#39;s kingdom succumbed to 
Cyrus the Persian&#44; and the Israelites were again permitted to 
dwell in their former dwelling&#8211;places &#59; and again was seen the 
spectacle of a powerful nation ruling for a while over extensive 
lands&#44; till their doom was hastened by cruelty and wickedness&#44; 
and the consequent moral and physical degradation &#59; and the 
Grecian Alexander&#44; as it were&#44; brushed away the tottering 
throne of Darius III.&#44; the last ruler of Persia of the successors 
of the great Cyrus. &#8212; A new period seemed now to open&#44; a new 
era ajipeared to greet the world &#59; refinement chased away bar&#8211; 
barism &#59; the elegant arts and sciences supplanted rudeness and 
ignorance &#59; and towns arose where elegance and luxury hitherto 
almost unknown became universal. But all this outward ele&#8211; 
gance&#44; this tinsel beauty&#44; was weakness itself&#44; it lacked a soul 
there was not the life of holy truth in all the fabric&#44; and it tum&#8211; 
bled and was frittered away by the iron arm of Roman conquest&#59; 
and the crazy building of a vainglorious philosophy&#44; the gaudy 
show of enervating sensuality&#44; sunk ingloriously before the 
merciless children of conquest that swarmed in numberless 
legions from the shores of the beautiful Italy. Thus was trans&#8211; 
ferred the seat of empire from the Nile to the shores of the 
insignificant Tiber&#44; and Rome was hailed the mistress of the 
world. &#8212; And Judea too fell beneath the revsistless power&#44; and 
the Jewish leaders were carried in triumph through the hostile 
city&#44; and those sons of Jacob that had escaped the slaughter 
were led into slavery and banishment. &#8212; Rome&#39;s triumph&#44; how&#8211; 
ever&#44; was not unending&#44; and the town that had vainly styled 
itself eternal was sacked by unheard of barbarians breaking 
forth from the very centre of Asia&#44; the cradle of mankind. &#8212; 
Again&#44; these barbarians felt the force of elegance and learning&#44; 
they occupied the fields which they had laid waste&#44; and reared 
kingdoms&#44; and aimed for universal empire. &#8212; Well nigh the 
scheme succeeded&#44; and all Europe listened to the command of a 
ruler unknown in ancient times&#44; and the head of a religious sect 
dictated laws and disposed of empires from his seat at Rome&#44; 
and dared to call himself God&#39;s vicegerent on earth. Every 
thing seemed at one time to yield to this almost magic spell&#44; 
and kings and nations poured out their blood at the bidding of 
this fancied power for the recovery of a fancied treasure&#59; and

the right of thinking and of worshipping God after the dictates 
of the law was called a crime&#44; because it gainsayed the doctrines 
of the Roman pontiff. And straightways the torch of perse&#8211; 
cution was kindled&#44; and in every town blazed the stake&#44; and in 
every place was erected the gallows&#44; in every district was set 
up the scaffold&#44; to immolate the victims on the altars of a false 
belief. &#8212; Where now was refuge for Israel&#63; &#8212; Hardly had perse&#8211; 
cution ceased at one spot&#44; because of the want of objects for 
slaughter&#44; when the rage showed itself at another&#44; and the star 
of Jacob seemed nigh its setting for ever. But again the power&#44; 
which seemed so strong&#44; was broken&#44; and before the words 
of an humble man nations&#44; once ready to strike in its cause&#44; 
buckled on their armour against its head and his supporters&#44; and 
by degrees the fire of persecution was smothered&#44; and in some 
measure was enlargement vouchsafed to Israel to recover fresh 
strength to meet the fulfilment of their destiny&#59; &#8212; this was the 
will of heaven. &#8212; Who can say&#44; after candidly viewing the 
history of the world&#44; as we have just done&#44; that every step has 
not been an improvement &#63; and do we not clearly perceive&#44; in all 
the mutation of empire&#44; the evident finger of God displayed in 
the preservation of our nation amidst all the vicissitudes of for&#8211; 
tune&#63; There flourished the Egyptians &#8212; but where are they&#63; 
the Assyrians &#8212; but they are no more&#59; &#8212; the Babylonians &#8212; 
their very memory is forgotten&#59; &#8212; the Persians &#8212; but their em&#8211; 
pire has not left a wreck behind&#59; &#8212; the Grecians &#8212; but their very 
religion is now a theme of ridicule&#44; and what remains of their 
state is not a resemblance of its former greatness&#59; and lastly&#44; &#8212; 
the Romans &#8212; how powerful were they not once&#44; the words: &#8212; 
&#39;• The Senate and the Roman People&#34; struck terror in the most 
distant lands&#59; but long since has this greatness ceased&#44; and this 
terror has not for ages past oppressed the world. &#8212; Again&#44; the 
religion of Rome after the downfal of its empire&#44; which as said 
was nigh becoming universal&#44; has lost its power of harming&#44; for 
the nations&#44; which it once kept in subjection&#44; have each almost 
adopted a reformed system&#44; as they term it&#44; of their own&#44; and 
men now legislate on the most sacred topics as though the eter&#8211; 
nal concerns of the soul could be regulated like a matter of state 
policy by the voice of a despot&#44; who speaks in the name of his 
people&#44; or by an assembled body of politicians&#44; or even at

length by some learned philosopher or divine&#44; who builds up 
systems or pulls them down&#44; as it happens to suit his fancy. &#8212; 
Yet under all circumstances&#44; whether as rulers or as slaves&#44; 
whether prosperous or oppressed&#44; we the Israelites have main&#8211; 
tained untact God&#39;s greatest and best gift&#44; we have preserved 
the law&#44; we have adhered to the revelation from Sinai &#59; we have&#44; 
in a word&#44; continued true to the character of a people of God&#44; a 
beloved treasure&#33; This is no vain boasting&#44; this is no idle 
grandiloquence&#59; no &#8212; brethren it is the sober truth&#44; an unde&#8211; 
niable truth&#44; which our worst opponents dare not&#44; cannot&#44; gain&#8211; 
say&#33; &#8212; But not for our own glorification did the Almighty pre&#8211; 
serve us&#44; not to show us up as something curious was all this 
effected&#59; but for a far nobler end&#44; that we might become the 
means gradually to amend the rest of mankind&#44; and at length to 
be the agents in spreading salvation&#44; both temporal and perma&#8211; 
nent&#44; to the ends of the earth. 

Do you now see what is meant by the reign of the king Mes&#8211; 
siah &#63; is it now clear to you what is to be his mission &#63; &#8212; what 
his doings&#63; &#8212; what his character&#63; &#8212; Evidently the reign of the 
Messiah must be one of happiness and peace&#59; his mission must&#44; 
in the first instance&#44; be to the Israelites&#44; and then to the rest of 
mankind&#59; his doings in this mission must be characterised by 
truth&#44; justice&#44; and rectitude&#59; and his character must be like 
that of prophets of old &#8212; like Moses&#44; like Samuel&#44; like Elijah&#44; 
one of piety&#44; and hope&#44; and entire singleness with the Lord his 
God. &#8212; In all this he needs not any attributes of divinity&#44; no 
delegation of any more of the divine power than was awarded 
before this to extraordinary men who acted in the name of God&#44; 
and by his will&#44; in a sphere of greatness and glory which had 
been marked out for them. It will moreover be obvious to you. 
that the mission of such a gifted one&#44; endowed above all men 
with wisdom&#44; with understanding&#44; and with power&#44; and wholly 
guided in all his acts by a holy will&#44; and protected by divine 
favour&#44; is an object over which God may be supposed to watch 
&#40;to speak in the language of man) with particular solicitude&#59; 
and that besides&#44; the period of this mission will not be hastened&#44; 
before every thing in the whole earth is in such a state of pre&#8211; 
paration&#44; that the greatest effect can be produced in the shortest 
time&#59; and that&#44; as we are totally ignorant of the counsels of 

    <pb n="523"/>

224 THE MESSIAH. 

God&#44; any farther than He has been pleased to communicate 
them to us through his prophets&#44; it would be idle presumption 
in us to fix this period with exactness&#59;&#44; or to declare the world 
at one time more ripe for the expected coming than the other. 
Let me here at once remark that&#44; therefore&#44; it will avail nothing 
in an argument to assert&#44; that the coming of the Messiah must 
have been fixed by prophets for a definite period&#44; because Jews 
at one particular time looked for him with anxiety&#59; for even 
granting that they were really expecting the Messiah at the 
time so often dwelt upon by our opponents : still that argues 
nothing more than that the hope of deliverance from thraldom 
vvas strong in the minds of our people&#44; and that they looked 
forward with hope for the arrival of the son of David&#44; to do 
for them at that time what the prophets had announced he 
should do&#44; at what they called &#34;the end of days&#44;&#34; meaning a 
period remote and distant from the time of their prophecy. &#8212; 
Even grant that many persons started up&#44; claiming the dignity 
of Messiah in their own persons&#44; and deceiving many by pre&#8211; 
tended miracles&#59; nay&#44; grant that this feeling of hope was so 
strong that even the learned and the good were misled: it 
amounts to no more than that&#44; at a period of almost unheard&#8211;of 
distress&#44; our nation&#44; true to their faith&#44; looked towards Heaven as 
the source of their deliverance&#44; but that for the sake of their 
great criminality&#44; their prayer was not granted&#44; although many 
were misled by an appearance of a counterfeit fulfilment of their 
wishes. To draw from such a deplorable state of confusion 
and dismay an argument in favour of the claims of any indi&#8211; 
vidual&#44; chiefly because he lived at that very period of time&#44; is 
resting upon a very weak foundation&#59; and bad indeed must be 
that cause which would rest for support upon grounds so entirely 
devoid of cogency and force. 

According to the views just exhibited&#44; which are but a natu&#8211; 
ral deduction of sound reasoning&#44; without a resort to revelation&#44; 
we have established&#44; first&#44; that a change in the order of things&#44; 
as relates to the moral state of man&#44; may safely be looked for &#59; 
secondly&#44; as God always acts through the agency of men&#44; that 
the expected change will be wrought through a man whom&#44; for 
the sake of distinction&#44; we will call the Messiah&#44; or the anointed&#44; 
chosen&#44; chief&#44; the instrument in the hand of God&#59; thirdly&#44; that 

    <pb n="524"/>

THE MESSIAH. 225 

this chosen agent will&#44; and must&#44; be eminent in all the virtues 
which adorn human nature&#44; and that his mental endowments 
will correspond with his high office&#59; fourthly&#44; that the Israel&#8211; 
ites&#44; the visible evidences of God&#39;s power&#44; will be benefitted in 
a high degree by the arrival of the deliverer&#59; and lastly&#44; that 
all nations will&#44; under his reign&#44; be led to a knowledge of the 
true and only God. Having thus stated our views&#44; it is now 
necessary&#44; according to our usual custom&#44; to fortify every posi&#8211; 
tion by scriptural arguments&#44; in order to show that in this&#44; as 
well as in every other consolatory doctrine&#44; Scripture tallies with 
reason. 

Our first position is: &#34;That a change will come over the moral 
state of man.&#34; Every philanthropist&#44; of every age&#44; I am well 
nigh tempted to assert&#44; has revolved in his mind the means of 
preventing a resort to arms to settle national and individual dis&#8211; 
putes. But as often as one thought he had discovered the de&#8211; 
sired remedy&#44; some untoward mishap proved that the means 
were inadequate&#44; and that the beautiful vision had vanished 
into thin airy nothing. &#34; Bloodshed is sinful&#44;&#34; teaches the phi&#8211; 
lanthropist&#59; &#34;War to the knife&#44;&#34; is the patriot&#39;s word&#44; who 
sees his country invaded and her sanctuaries violated: &#34; Ag&#8211; 
gression is indefensible&#44;&#34; is the motto of the peace&#8211;lover&#59; but 
anon you are aroused by the war&#8211;whoop of the savage&#44; and the 
cries of your bleeding infants &#8212; the sight of your murdered 
wife&#44; rouse in you all the feelings of revenge which can prompt 
the bereaved father&#44; the lone husband&#44; to deeds of daring and 
a patient endurance of all the hardships and fatigues of war. &#8212; 
Who then can cry out &#34; peace&#44;&#34; when there is no peace&#63; where 
is that concert of action by which modern diplomacy assayed 
to quench the torch of war &#63; and is it not reasonable to presume 
that all new schemes will fail&#44; as all others hitherto have utterly 
failed&#63; But yet&#44; that scheme which in human hands is but a 
Utopian attempt&#44; which can never hope for success&#44; in higher 
keeping will&#44; must&#44; yield the blessed fruit&#59; and not for ever shall 
the brother bewail the slaughtered brother&#44; nor the father mourn 
for the early&#44; gory&#44; grave of his beloved offspring. And&#44; says 
the prophet&#44; in speaking of human attempts &#40;Malachi&#44; chap. i. 
4): &#34;For if Edom even say: &#8212; We are destroyed&#44; but we will 
rebuild the waste places&#59; but thus says the Lord of hosts: Let 

    <pb n="525"/>

them build&#44; and I will pull down&#59; and people will call them: 
The country of desolation&#44; and the people over whom the Lord 
is angry for evermore&#59;&#34; &#8212; for not to human hands&#44; not to a mor&#8211; 
tal&#39;s foresight&#44; will the Lord yield the superintendence of his 
creation&#44; an interference in his high prerogative of Ruler of the 
universe. But in the Lord&#39;s own good time will be accom&#8211; 
plished what Isaiah foretells: 

&#34; And it shall come to pass at the end of days&#44; the mountain of the house 
of the Lord will stand firm on the top of the mountains&#44; and will be raised 
above the hills&#44; and to it shall stream all the nations.&#34; ii. 2. 

And then Isaiah continues: &#34;And go will many nations and 
say : Come and let us go to the mountain of the Lord&#44; to the 
house of the God of Jacob&#44; and He shall teach us of his ways&#44; 
and we will walk in his paths&#59; for out of Zion shall go the 
law and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And he shall 
judge between nations&#44; and correct many people&#44; and they 
shall beat their swords into ploughshares&#44; and their spears into 
pruning&#8211;hooks&#59; no nation shall lift sword against nation&#44; and no 
more shall they learn war.&#34; &#8212; But little need be added in ex&#8211; 
planation of a text so plain and self&#8211;evident. The prophet 
speaks of a change that is to take place&#44; and describes it as two&#8211; 
fold&#59; one is&#44; the evident exaltation of the religion of the Lord 
as the universal law of the world&#44; and the other&#44; the perfect 
state of peace that is to prevail in consequence of the adoption 
of the holy law. &#8212; Now this is precisely that condition of society 
which has been so long and so ardently desired&#44; and this we 
call in one word the days of the Messiah. Now&#44; can any one 
maintain that this condition has been brought about&#63; is there 
now one law&#44; one faith&#44; and one God universally acknowledged&#63; 
is every sword beaten into a ploughshare&#63; is every spear turned 
into a pruning&#8211;hook &#63; or rather&#44; does not the land resound with 
preparation for strife &#63; do not nations plot each other&#39;s down&#8211; 
fal &#63; does not daily the deep&#8211;mouthed canon thunder forth 
death and destruction to its doomed hundreds &#63; do not yet 
hostile fleets from the far North and from the distant West sail

forth in all the gay array of martial prowess and settle the 
deep hatred of their rival nations in the far golden regions of 
the sunny East&#63; And this you call peace&#63; such discord you 
call harmony &#63; &#8212; Or perhaps you imagine that the prophet spoke 
of mental peace&#44; of agreement in religious tenets&#44; a universal 
acquiescence in one rule of life. &#8212; But even this has not been 
attained. For how many are the creeds now which mankind 
acknowledge I There is the ignorant negro&#44; who literally says 
to the stone : &#34;Thou art my father&#59;&#34; and the barbarous South&#8211; 
Sea islander&#44; who sacrifices his captives to his dreadful image &#59; 
and there the indweller of the laud of China&#44; with his absurd 
mockeries in place of worship&#59; again the adherent of the 
lama&#44; believing in a perpetual reign of their man&#8211;idol on earth&#59; 
and there you will behold the melancholy Hindoo&#44; rolling in 
the sand to be crushed by the wagon of his false homage&#44; or 
wallowing in the swamp of the Ganges&#44; to be devoured by the 
crocodile or the shark &#59; and there stands the fierce Arab&#44; 
defying all law&#44; an enemy to all men&#44; and trusting only lo his 
good lance&#44; and he says: &#34; There is but one God&#44; but Mahomet 
is his prophet&#44;&#34; and his religion is one of forms mostly&#44; and 
his beatitude but sensuality &#59; &#8212; again behold the Romanist&#44; 
seeking in the elected head of his church the vicegerent of his 
god &#59; and the numerous sects of another belief next present 
themselves&#44; all maintaining that each alone is right : and now 
you have a picture of discord in place of the harmony pro&#8211; 
phesied. And yet you say that the reign of the Messiah has 
endured already near two thousand years &#63; when shall we look 
for harmony &#63; is the dispute of sectarians waxing less angry as 
time advances &#63; are not daily new and often monstrous absur&#8211; 
dities propagated in the name of the king of peace&#63; and where 
is this all to end &#63; You perhaps say&#44; at a second coming of 
the Messiah &#63; So then you acknowledge that the first alleged 
coming failed of accomplishing all that was necessary &#59; but we 
too hope for a coming of Messiah&#59; but it is the first&#44; the only 
coming&#44; when all will be fulfilled and accomplished to the 
letter&#44; which has been foretold concerning his ministry. For&#44; 
in looking through the Scriptures to be informed on this im&#8211; 
portant subject&#44; we are constantly referred to the prince in 
whose days all shall dwell in safety &#59; but in no one instance is

an allusion even made in so many words&#44; to a second appearance 
after his removal from the eyes of the world. &#8212; On the contrary&#44; 
a permanent reign is foretold : &#34; And my servant David shall 
be prince over them for ever&#44;&#34; says Ezekiel&#44; chap&#44; xxxvii. 25&#44; 
which verse surely&#44; if it has any meaning&#44; which nobody can 
deny&#44; must indicate an everlasting state of blessedness&#44; from 
the coming of the Messiah till all shall be resolved again into 
chaos&#44; if this be the ultimate will of God&#44; and a reproduction of 
a better earth and a better heaven. And who knows to a cer&#8211; 
tainty&#44; what is precisely meant by the new creation which is 
foretold in Isaiah Ixvi. 22 &#63; The words are : &#34; For like the 
new heavens and the new earth&#44; which I make&#44; will stand 
before me&#44; says the Lord&#44; thus shall stand your posterity and 
your name.&#34; Now&#44; this may mean&#44; that when this earth and 
all the present system of nature shall have existed during a 
certain period&#44; then a different system&#44; one more perfect than 
the one now existing&#44; shall be established&#44; which after its 
formation shall stand permanently before its Creator &#59; such an 
idea&#44; let me remark&#44; is by no means discordant with the prin&#8211; 
ciples of men of science&#44; who have endeavoured to seek 
wisdom from the records of nature itself. &#8212; Yet&#44; in the midst 
of this change&#44; the upholding of Jacob&#39;s progeny is not to 
be lost sight of&#44; and consequently the Messiah&#39;s reign is not 
even then to terminate. &#8212; Another meaning of this verse may 
be&#44; that it is the intention of God to remodel the moral 
state of the earth&#44; and to infuse in all created things a spirit 
of love and unity&#44; and thus a new creation will be effected in 
the moral and spiritual world&#44; though the physical and material 
substances have undergone no perceptible change. In every 
view of this difficult question&#44; however&#44; it will be perceived&#44; 
that the reign of the Messiah and the existence of the Israelitish 
people shall be unending while the world lasts. &#8212; All the above 
clearly proves&#44; that according to the revelation of the prophets 
a great moral&#44; and perhaps too a physical&#44; change is impending&#44; 
when the discord and strife which now distract the world shall 
no longer be experienced. Whatever events&#44; please to observe&#44; 
have taken place in by&#8211;gone days&#44; whatever events are now 
occurring&#44; and whatever events will come to pass in future 
times&#44; all will tend ultimately to the consummation of this

great change. If now one nation rises in blood&#44; and shoots up 
its branches from the ashes of a slaughtered people &#59; if we see 
apparent injustice even permitted to tread down upon the head 
of fallen greatness : we may rest in the hopeful assurance&#44; that 
all is so wisely ordained&#44; all so nicely balanced&#44; that&#44; when the 
end of all this warfare and this unhappiness shall have arrived&#44; 
we will discover that all has truly happened for the best&#44; and 
all has been so ordained by the counsel of liim who supervises 
all our conduct&#44; that nothing but justice&#44; nothing but righteous&#8211; 
ness&#44; will be the ultimate result&#44; and that the course of events 
was so organized as to bring about&#44; in the best manner&#44; the 
end which&#44; in the mind of God&#44; is already come to pass&#44; which 
with Him is the past already&#44; but which to us is yet the future&#44; 
and the accomplishment of which we have yet to expect. &#8212; 
What matters it then&#44; that first the Egyptians flourished&#44; and 
next the Assyrians and Babylonians&#44; then the Grecians&#44; after 
them the Romans&#44; whether it be roaming savages that scour 
the forest&#44; or bigoted Spaniards that devoted millions of vic&#8211; 
tims to destruction &#63; all&#44; all are in his eyes but vanity&#44; but like 
the dust that adheres to the polished scales &#8212; all their doings 
are nothing in his estimation&#44; and He looks upon their efforts at 
greatness&#44; upon their puny striving at renown&#44; with derision and 
with scorn&#44; as the Psalmist says &#40;ii. 1&#8211;4) : &#34; Why do the nations 
storm&#44; and people attempt vanity &#63; &#8212; He that thrones in heaven 
laughs&#44; the Lord scorns them.&#34; Not as though the holy One 
indulged in spiteful malice&#44; but to make the human ear under&#8211; 
stand the utter weakness of human ambition. &#8212; In short&#44;all is sub&#8211; 
servient to the great end that is approaching&#44; slowly perhaps&#44; to 
us&#44; whose years are appointed to the short space of seventy annual 
revolutions&#44; or perhaps to the frosty age of eighty&#59; but quickly&#44; 
speedily&#44; to Him&#44; whose age no numbers can indicate&#44; whose 
existence is not limited by time or space. &#8212; As yet&#44; however&#44; 
the state of warfare is not over&#59; as yet oppression stalks abroad&#59; 
as yet Israel is compelled to bend his head under the heavy 
yoke which oppressors fasten on his neck&#59; as yet wickedness 
assumes the right of giving the law to innocence&#59; and conse&#8211; 
quently the altered state of the world has not arrived&#44; the INIes&#8211; 
siah has not yet been sent. But the time of this great event 
may be very near&#44; nearer than any one imagines&#44; &#8212; the wrathful

time of trial may be approaching&#59; but where is the preparation 
which is needed to pass the fiery ordeal &#63; And what says the 
prophet&#63; &#40;Malachi iii. 1&#8211;4): &#34;Behold&#44; I send my angel&#44; who 
shall make clear the way before me &#59; and suddenly will come 
to his temple the Lord whom you are seeking&#59; and the angel of 
the covenant&#44; whom ye are desiring&#44; behold &#33; he comes&#44; says 
the Lord of hosts. But who can endure the day of his coming&#63; 
and who can stand when he appears&#63; for he is like the fire of 
the refiner and the soap of the fullers. And as sitteth the 
refiner and purifies the silver&#44; so he will cleanse the children of 
Levi and purify them like the gold and like the silver&#44; that 
only those shall be the Lord&#39;s &#40;servants) who bring theofiering 
in righteousness. Then will be pleasant to the Lord&#44; the offer&#8211; 
ing of Judah and Jerusalem&#44; like in days of olden times and 
years of former days.&#34; &#8212; The refiner will come and sift the 
sinners from among the community of the righteous&#59; &#8212; and 
what will stand the test of the Messiah&#39;s fire&#63; will it be a mass 
of wealth&#63; &#8212; a renown for greatness in eloquence or prowess in 
arms&#63; &#8212; will it be the love which one bears for pleasures and 
sensuality&#63; &#8212; No&#44; it will be the love which we bear to God&#44; the 
readiness which we show to obey his laws&#44; and the mass of 
virtues&#44; which alone is our true inheritance in this world&#44; here 
whilst living&#44; and in yonder life&#44; when our soul has departed 
to the place of its first origin. &#8212; 0&#44; let it then be our aim to 
observe the precepts of the Lord&#44; and let us ever be willing 
and prepared to yield ourselves obedient servants to his will&#44; 
as our ancestors were on that day&#44; when assembled by the faith&#8211; 
ful Moses they stood at the foot of Sinai&#44; and heard announced 
from amidst the fire the ten commandments which God insti&#8211; 
tuted as the terms of the covenant between Him and Israel. 
Now&#44; these are the riches which we possess&#59; these are the 
blessings which God wishes to spread over all the earth &#59; these 
are the gifts which the Messiah is to distribute to all people &#59; 
and when he&#44; therefore&#44; is sent to rejoice the hearts of all men&#44; 
nations indeed will exclaim: &#34;Let us go to the house of the 
God of Jacob&#44; and let Him teach us of his ways and we will 
walk in his paths&#44;&#34; and then truly will it be fulfilled what the 
prophet says : &#34; That from Zion shall go out the law and the 
word of God from Jerusalem.&#34;

our Father and King &#33; hovv long shall we hope&#63; how long 
shall we pray&#63; and when wilt Thou hear us&#63; for ages we have 
hoped for peace&#44; but our prayers were not heard &#59; we looked 
for quiet&#44; but the oppressor was suffered to lord over us &#33; 
let it now be thy will to hasten the days of our deliverance&#44; 
and cause it to be verified in our days&#44; that the angel of the 
covenant and the son of David thy servant may come to glad&#8211; 
den our hearts with thy salvation &#59; and then our joy will be 
complete&#44; when Thou barest thy holy arm before all nations&#44; and 
provest to the whole world that Thou&#44; Lord&#44; art God alone&#44; 
and that besides Thee there is none in heaven&#44; and none like 
unto Thee among the powers of the earth &#59; but that to Thee&#44; 
truly&#44; belong the kingdom and the adoration of all mankind &#33; 
Amen.

DISCOURSE XLVIII. 



THE MESSIAH. 



Thou &#33; Shepherd of Israel&#44; hear our supplications&#44; and 
let thy countenance shine unto us&#59; renew in us a pure heart&#63; 
and infuse in us thy holy spirit&#44; that we may know how to 
serve Thee and to fear Thee all the days that we live on the 
earth. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 
In the view we have taken thus far of the subject of the 
Messiah&#44; we have arrived at the conclusion&#44; that both reason 
and Scripture warrant us in looking forward to a change that 

    <pb n="531"/>

232 THE MESSIAH. 

is impending over the moral state of man. This change&#44; we 
have shown&#44; must produce a state of universal peace all over 
the earth&#44; so that no one&#44; be he weak or strong&#44; need to fear 
or to ward off the attacks of his neighbour. We have also 
proved&#44; that this state is not the present state of the world&#44; and 
consequently&#44; that the predictions of the prophets have in this 
respect&#44; not yet seen their fulfilment&#59; and whereas the announce&#8211; 
ment of the prophets must be true as the emanation of the holy 
Spirit: it is reasonable&#44; and consonant with religion&#44; to look 
forward with an unwavering confidence to the fulfilment of the 
prophecies relating to the state of universal peace. &#8212; The se&#8211; 
cond deduction laid down was&#44; that this change was to be ef&#8211; 
fected through an agent&#44; whom we call the Messiah. On this 
subject so much has already been said incidently&#44; that we might 
pass over to the next point&#44; which you perhaps recollect was 
the character of this messenger &#59; but it being perhaps best to 
draw some more light from Scripture&#44; we will illustrate it a 
little more at large. &#8212; Already in the book of Genesis we find&#44; 
that Jacob prophesied of a Shiloh&#44; to whom the nations should 
assemble. This evidently refers to a messenger&#44; whom God 
was to send to fulfil the object of the world&#39;s regeneration. 
The prophecy&#44; it may freely be admitted&#44; is not very explicit 
as to the manner in which this was to be effected&#59; but later 
prophets afford us more ample and enlarged details&#44; and as the 
whole Bible is but one entire&#44; as has been demonstrated on 
other occasions&#44; one part must always be taken to illustrate the 
other. And we are&#44; tlierefore&#44; warranted in the belief&#44; that 
Jacob spoke of the same teacher&#44; whom the seers of later ages 
foresaw in their visions. One remarkable phrase you must 
particularly note in all prophecies concerning Messiah&#59; it is 
that the words : D&#39;n&#39;n nnnx2 &#34; In the end of days&#34; are employ&#8211; 
ed in nearly all&#44; from Jacob&#44; the earliest one who spoke of the 
Messiah&#44; to the latter days of the first&#44; nay&#44; even down to the 
commencement of the second temple. This would seem to 
prove&#44; that not one of the prophets contemplated the desired 
advent as absolutely close at hand&#44; and that the rebuilding of 
the house of God by Ezra and his associates was not viewed as 
an accomplishment of the promised happiness of the people of 
Israel. This&#44; it will be easily seen&#44; is an important point in 

    <pb n="532"/>

THE MESSIAH. 233 

our argument&#44; and which scarcely can be overthrown by any 
thing that has been advanced against us&#44; so far as my knowledge 
thereof extends. So then&#44; it would appear&#44; that Jacob the first 
prophet&#44; who predicted the Messiah in distinct terms&#44; referred&#44; 
no less than his successors&#44; his advent to a period remote&#44; more 
or less&#44; according to the fitness of the world for the altered 
state that is to follow in his footsteps. &#8212; Bileam&#44; in his advice to 
Balak to mislead Israel to sin&#44; also spoke &#40;Numb. xxiv. 14): 
&#34; And now I am ready to go to my people &#59; come&#44; I will coun&#8211; 
sel thee&#44; what this people will do to thy people at the end of 
days.&#34; And in ver. 17&#44; he says&#44; foreseeing the exalted glory 
of Israel : &#34; I see him&#44; but he is not yet now&#44; I behold him&#44; but 
he is not near&#59; a star steps forth from Jacob&#44; and a stem arises 
from Israel&#44; and he will bruise the corners of Moab&#44; and tread 
down all the children of Seth.&#34; Ver. 19: &#34; A ruler shall come 
from Jacob and destroy the remainder from the city.&#34; In this 
passage&#44; so corroborative of the Patriarch&#39;s words&#44; an agent&#44; 
nay&#44; a human agent is distinctly announced&#44; and we are told&#44; 
that his advent was seen by the gentile prophet&#44; although it 
had not then been witnessed&#44; nor was it to be near at hand &#59; and 
that to the messenger was to belong the earthly rule over the 
nations. This remarkable prediction is further supported by 
Isaiah&#44; chap. Ix. 12 : &#34; For the nation and the kingdom that 
will not serve shall perish&#44; and the nations shall be utterly laid 
waste &#59;&#34; and by Jeremiah xlvi. 27&#8211;28 : &#34; But fear not thou&#44; 
my servant Jacob&#44; and be not dismayed&#44; Israel &#59; for behold&#44; 
I will save thee from afar ofi&#44; and thy seed from the land of 
their captivity &#59; and Jacob shall return and be at rest and at 
ease&#44; and none shall make him afraid. Thou &#8212; do thou not fear 
my servant Jacob&#44; says the Lord&#44; for I am with thee&#44; for I will 
make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee &#59; 
but of thee I will not make a full end &#59; I will correct thee in 
judgment&#44; but never destroy thee altogether.&#34; &#8212; Although these 
two passages do not speak of the Messiah&#44; I am induced to cite 
them at this stage of the argument to exhibit at one view the 
connection between the various predictions delivered at so 
great distances of time&#44; and under varying circumstances. 
Having now touched this point&#44; it may be as well to state at 
once that the annihilation of the gentiles does not allude to the 

20&#42; 

    <pb n="533"/>
    
234 THE MESSIAH. 

extermination of the individuals composing the mass of man&#8211; 
kind &#59; but only to their national existence&#44; which will be 
effected&#44; the more fully to reduce the whole remainder of the 
human race to peace and harmony. The individuals&#44; however&#44; 
are not to be cut off&#44; but are to become servants of the Lord&#44; as 
will be shown hereafter. &#8212; It will be seen from the foregoing&#44; 
that the idea of a redeeming human agent&#44; acting under the 
evident supervision of God&#44; was distinctly known to the Isra&#8211; 
elites&#44; as early as the days of Moses&#44; and even before &#59; this also 
is a very important point in our argument&#44; and must do away 
with the assumption which has been hazarded&#44; that the early 
Israelites knew nothing of a Messiah. &#8212; If we now trace the 
prophecies downwards&#44; including several other allusions of 
Moses&#44; we shall find the great hope for a human saviour under 
God constantly kept in view &#59; but it would require much time 
to cite the whole and to illustrate them. We must therefore 
proceed at once to the distinct annunciation of the redeemer&#44; 
and his character&#44; which we find in the books of the later pro&#8211; 
phets&#44; from which indeed most of our doctrines must be con&#8211; 
firmed&#44; as they are more ample in detail than the scattered pre&#8211; 
dictions of former periods. &#8212; Let us begin with Isaiah &#59; in his 
eleventh chapter he says : &#34; And there shall come forth a rod 
out of the stem of Jesse&#44; and a branch shall grow out of his 
roots. And on him shall rest the spirit of the Lord &#59; the spirit 
of wisdom&#44; and of understanding&#44; the spirit of counsel and of 
might&#44; the spirit of knowledge and of fear of the Lord. &#8212; And 
he will be aniine legis&#8211; 
lation had lost its influence among them. All the prophetic 
imagery is therefore drawn from the pursuits of husbandry&#44; 
with but few exceptions. Jeremiah&#44; now&#44; had uttered his com&#8211; 
plaints against the wicked rulers&#44; by whose mismanagement the 
people went to ruin&#59; he styled them: &#34; Shepherds that destroy 
and scatter the flock of God&#39;s pasture&#44;&#34; and announced at 
the same time that these bad shepherds should be punished. 
But he says: &#34; That though the flock had been scattered&#44; the 
remainder should be gathered to their former fold&#44; where they 
should increase and multiply&#59;&#34; and he then continues with 
the passage quoted: &#34;And I will raise unto them shepherds 
who shall feed them&#44;&#34; meaning that at the restoration of the 
people under the king Messiah&#44; who is to be the righteous plant 
from David&#44; leaders should arise who will be different&#44; far dif&#8211; 
ferent&#44; from the officers of the Jewish kings&#44; who oppressed the 
poor and misled the wealthy. From this we again learn the 
character of the redeemer: he is to be a leader after God&#39;s own 
mind&#44; just and equitable&#44; free from the taint of injustice&#44; and 
perfectly submissive to the behests of the Lord. Under him 
security is to reign&#59; no one there shall be to make the remnant 
of Israel afraid&#44; for they shall dwell free from aggression and 
assault. The name of the prince&#44; too&#44; as well as of the glorious 
city&#44; shall be: &#34;The Lord our Righteousness&#44;&#34; but as yet the 
city of Jerusalem is not inhabited securely&#59; its name is not 
tip nor has that man arisen who is the leader of all Israel&#44; 
and who is honoured with the same name&#33;

    <pb n="542"/>

242 THE MESSIAH. 

As shown already prophets say much relative to the high 
characteristics of the coming king but the limits which must 
be given to a public address will not permit me to adduce them 
all. We must therefore be satisfied for the present with 
adverting only to the passage from Zechariah&#44; already quoted&#44; 
to show the expectations we entertain of a Messiah to be conso&#8211; 
nant with Scripture. &#34; Rejoice greatly&#44; thou daughter of Zion&#44; 
for thy king will come to thee&#44; righteous and victorious he is&#44; 
meek and riding on an ass&#44; on a colt the son of the she&#8211;ass.&#34; &#8212; 
We have been taunted by our opponents with expecting a mere 
temporary king&#44; a warrior and a conqueror. &#8212; To this we reply&#44; 
that we expect in the Messiah a two&#8211;fold character &#8212; the one 
purely spiritual&#44; as has been shown already&#44; and as I intend 
proving hereafter in a subsequent address &#59; but the other cha&#8211; 
racteristic is certainly temporary&#44; and no one&#44; we are free to say&#44; 
can be the Messiah&#44; who does not unite both in his own per&#8211; 
son. &#8212; From Ezekiel especially&#44; and also Obediah and Zechariah&#44; 
it appears that great wars will be waged in Palestine at the time 
of the end &#59; and farther that this will be a time of great tribula&#8211; 
tion to Israel. We are also told&#44; that our people will&#44; by the 
aid of God&#44; escape from the threatened extirpation&#59; and now this 
aid of God will be rendered through an agent&#44; who is the Mes&#8211; 
siah &#59; he is therefore called righteous and victorious&#44; literally 
however&#44; a helped one&#44; meaning guided and assisted of God. 
If this temporal character of warrior in the holy cause of 
defending his people and of subjecting barbarians&#44; who come to 
kill and destroy&#44; derogates from his high dignity in the estima&#8211; 
tion of our opponents : they are perfectly welcome to all the 
addition to their argument which they can derive from it &#59; ive 
see nothing in it save a farther proof of the goodness of God&#44; in 
protecting his people from destruction against a&#44; perhaps&#44; united 
world. But let it not be lost sight of&#44; that immediately after 
speaking of the victoriousness of Messiah&#44; the prophet calls him 
&#34; meek riding on an ass&#59;&#34; and why so humbly mounted&#63; why 
not on a prancing war&#8211;steed &#63; why not bedecked with the spoils 
of the vanquished&#63; Because says Zechariah: &#34; I will destroy 
the chariot from Ephraim&#44; and the horse from Jerusalem&#44;&#34; the 
king himself&#44; therefore&#44; wnll not appear on a beast of war&#44; but 
on an humble animal of labour&#44; for meekness will be the cha&#8211;

racter of him&#44; as well as it was of Moses&#44; and he will in his own 
person teach humility and love of God &#59; and then&#44; &#40;after the 
wars of these times are over&#44;) &#34; destroyed shall be the bow&#44; for 
peace he shall speak to the nations&#44; and his rule shall be from 
sea to sea&#44; and from the river to the ends of the earth.&#34; So 
that the temporal actions of our future hope shall redound as 
much to the benefit of mankind as his spiritual gifts will be&#44; for 
those will pave the way for peace and happiness &#59; these will 
establish the same on a foundation which shall never be moved. 
I regret exceedingly&#44; that I cannot dwell longer on ihe subject&#44; 
and examine more at length the objections so often made : but 
I trust&#44; that what has been said will prove&#44; that our opinions 
are altogether founded on the word of God&#44; and are conforma&#8211; 
ble to the dictates of reason. God&#44; understand well&#44; works 
through natural means and &#8211;natural agents&#44; and consequently 
these will always be resorted to in some measure&#44; even at the 
performing of great miracles. 

Connected however with the advent of the son of David is 
the mission of another glorious name&#44; that of Elijah the prophet&#59; 
for we read&#44; Malachi iii. 23&#8211;24 : 

&#34; Behold I send unto you Elijah the prophet&#44; before comes the day of the 
Lord&#44; the great and fearful&#59; and he will bring back the heart of the fathers 
to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers.&#34; 

So then it appears that love and truth are to pave the way 
for the great day of the Lord&#44; and Elijah is to come to be the 
precursor of the redeemer. No Elijah has yet come to gladden 
the hearts of the parents and the children &#59; consequently the 
great day has not yet arrived. &#8212; The message of love has not 
yet been announced &#59; discord and contention yet disturb the 
peace of the family home &#59; &#8212; where then is the fulfilment of the 
prediction &#63; But the God of truth has spoken the word by his 
servant&#59; He that never errs has said&#44; that the coming time shall 
teem with salvation &#59; &#8212; let it then be our endeavour to fortify

ourselves in faith&#44; and to deserve the blessings which will fol&#8211; 
low the footsteps of the Lord whom we are seeking&#44; and of the 
angel of the covenant whom we desire. 

May it be the will of our Father to guard us on the path of 
life which we are pursuing &#59; may He pour out his blessing 
over us&#44; and yield to each man the good desire of his heart &#59; 
and may He to his chosen nation especially give his grace&#44; and 
enlighten their hearts&#44; even in the lands whither they have 
wandered for their manifold transgressions&#44; that they may learn 
to discern between the true and the false&#44; the good and the 
evil. May He deliver them from the snares of the ungodly&#44; 
who constantly aim to rob them of their hope and their support&#44; 
the law which He himself has given &#59; so that all the house of 
Israel&#44; and after them the whole race of man&#44; may be found 
worthy in His eyes&#44; to send down from heaven Elijah the 
angel of the covenant&#44; and cause His anointed one to come to 
gladden us with peace and salvation. Amen.

DISCOURSE XLIX. 



THE MESSIAH. 



To Thee&#44; King of glory&#44; do we turn our eyes &#59; on Thee&#44; 
Father of mercy&#44; do we call&#44; to grant us salvation and peace&#44; 
and to cover us and all the earth with the panoply of thy grace 
and bounty &#33; 0&#44; our God&#44; Thou hast said&#44; that the earth 
should be full of knowledge of Thee&#44; and that no nation should 
lift up sword against nation&#59; do Thou now&#44; according to thy 
promise&#44; and cease&#44; by thy potent might&#44; the strife and conten&#8211; 
tion which at present desolate the earth &#59; and remove speedily 

    <pb n="545"/>

THE MESSIAH. 245 

the yoke of oppressions which the humble ones are suffering 
from the hands of those stronger than they &#33; And cause Thou 
the redeemer&#44; even David thy servant&#44; to be sent unto us to 
gladden our hearts&#44; and to bid those rejoice who now mourn 
for Zion&#44; the city of thy holiness &#33; May this be thy will&#44; 
speedily&#44; and in our days &#33; Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

Let us once more revert to the elucidation of the doctrines 
connected with the Messiah&#44; or&#44; as we have explained the word 
in our last lecture&#44; to the man&#44; descended from David&#44; endowed 
with high intellect and virtue&#44; deputed&#44; or anointed&#44; by the 
Most High to work out the change of which the prophets speak 
as impending over the outward world. &#8212; It is evident&#44; even 
without resorting to the Bible for proof&#44; that&#44; consistently with 
the truth of God&#44; the people&#44; whom He once chose of all 
nations as the depositary of his will and law&#44; cannot&#44; by any 
possibility&#44; be excluded from participating in the benefits re&#8211; 
sulting from the mission of the high functionary&#44; whom all 
their seers taught them to expect. For to argue otherwise 
would&#44; to say no more&#44; be impeaching the wisdom of God&#44; for 
having selected a family as the recipients of the highest trust&#44; 
who would&#44; on the first and greatest opportunity&#44; utterly fail of 
answering the end intended&#44; and show themselves entirely un&#8211; 
worthy of the great grace vouchsafed unto them. For&#44; what 
other reason could there be to deny them a share in the hap&#8211; 
piness to be brought through the JNIessiah &#63; would God be un&#8211; 
kind to those&#44; once called his children&#44; without a very powerful 
motive for their rejection &#63; Let us pause one moment&#44; and see 
what this powerful motive can be&#44; even supposing that one 
should exist. It cannot be a denial of the Deity himself&#59; for&#44; 
amidst all the apostacies of the Israelites&#44; we never yet saw the 
period when a total neglect of the Deity and his commands 
took place&#44; and relying upon the historic records of the Bible&#44; 
there was accordingly no time in all the seasons of trouble and 
destruction&#44; when our nation was utterly forsaken by the Lord&#59; 
and convulsions&#44; Vvhich overthrew and annihilated other em&#8211; 
pires&#44; compared to vvhich our state was hardly as a small corner&#44; 

21&#42; 

    <pb n="546"/>

246 THE MESSIAH. 

merely purified our people&#44; and even if diminished in number 
by every passage through the smelting furnace&#44; a hardier&#44; a 
firmer&#44; a purer body always emerged after every trial. All 
this proves that mere sinning will not deprive us entirely of 
the grace of God &#59; we must therefore seek for the cause of such 
a supposition farther even than the nearly universal apostacy wit&#8211; 
nessed in the days of the kings of Judah and Israel. It must be 
the rejection of the Messiah when he comes. But it requires but 
small penetration to discover that this course can never take 
place. We ask : &#34; To whom did the prophets speak&#44; when 
predicting the redeemer &#63;&#34; the Bible answers : &#34; To the sons 
of Israel.&#34; &#34; To whom again did God speak when saying&#44; that 
even in the land of their enemies He would never forsake them&#44; 
though their sins had banished them from their lovely inheri&#8211; 
tance &#63;&#34; The Bible again answers : &#34;To the sons of Israel.&#34; 
&#34; To whom were the prophets like Moses promised &#63; in the 
midst of whom walked in humble guise the man that never 
tasted the cup of death &#63; whose ancestors stood at the foot of 
the burning mount to receive the law of the King of glory &#63; 
whose forefathers were called the friends of God &#63;&#34; &#8212; &#34; None 
others than the people of Israel &#33;&#34; And yet we can assume&#44; 
that they alone should&#44; of all mankind&#44; wilfully place them&#8211; 
selves out of the pale of God&#39;s mercy by rejecting the mes&#8211; 
senger&#44; whom He purposed sending from the beginning&#44; nay&#44; 
whilst they ostensibly profess to be guided by the ordinances of 
the law which he gave to ihem as his will &#33; could blindness be 
carried farther &#63; And assuming this is possible&#44; what can be 
thought of the wisdom that selected such a people of all others 
as the guardians of the law &#63; is it possible to suppose&#44; that the 
religion to be upheld by the advent so much desired can be 
spread to the limits of the earth&#44; whilst its first possessors are 
false to their trust&#44; in even rejecting the messenger&#44; and there&#8211; 
by incurring a punishment greater far than was sufiered for 
apostacy and the worship of idols &#63; &#8212; We could multiply ques&#8211; 
tions like these&#44; and endeavour to strengthen conviction yet 
farther &#59; but what needs it to adduce arguments to prove that 
the sun sheds light at the noon of day&#44; and what proof do you 
require&#44; that God&#39;s wisdom is unerring&#44; and that his means 
always accomplish their object&#63; We must therefore dismiss the 

    <pb n="547"/>

THE MESSIAH. 247 

absurd idea&#44; that the Messiah is not for the Israelites&#44; and we 
must assume that the son of David will also to our nation bring 
salvation and peace&#44; among the rest of the sons of Adam. 

Let us now see what our nation stands in especial need of&#44; 
and what have always been the causes of our weakness. We 
need&#44; more than any thing else&#44; an entire and perfect union &#59; 
since our present existence can hardly be called national&#44; being 
dispersed&#44; as we are&#44; in unimportant numbers all over the 
globe &#8212; oppressed in many countries&#44; tolerated merely in others&#44; 
and regarded as equals in but few indeed. To such a state of 
degradation have we&#44; the people of God&#44; been reduced&#44; and it 
is thus we suffer the burden of our iniquities. Now&#44; it is not 
to be denied&#44; that to a nation&#44; that has been once independant 
and free it is of vast importance and of paramount interest to 
enjoy an equal share of liberty of action as formerly&#44; and hence 
no efforts&#44; however heroic&#44; are held as too dearly applied&#44; that 
will produce this result. And tell a conquered people&#44; to cease 
longing for a reinstatement of their government&#44; because their 
new rulers govern with justice and moderation: and you will 
be answered&#44; that nothing can compensate for precious laws 
abolished&#44; for homes desolated&#44; and for altars overturned. This 
sentiment of regret has never been a stranger to the captives of 
Judah &#59; and many have been the tears that flowed for thee&#44; 
holy Zion &#33; many have been the sighs heaved at remembering 
thee&#44; sacred city of Salem &#33; and let thy children&#44; land of 
Israel&#44; land of loveliness&#44; wander whither they may&#44; unto thy 
distant shores they will turn in their prayers&#44; and bless the 
dust in which sleep their fathers &#8212; their fathers &#33; &#8212; their pro&#8211; 
phets &#33; &#8212; the friends of their God&#33; And should we not weep 
over our fallen state&#44; when we see the ordinances of the Lord 
held in light esteem &#63; when in no one country the code of 
Moses is obeyed &#63; when as slaves or as citizens our brothers are 
constantly enticed away to forsake the religion of their fathers&#63; 
when&#44; alas &#33; the arts of our adversaries on the one side&#44; and the 
open violence of the persecutor on the other&#44; have been equally 
effective in drawing away many a faint&#8211;liearted Israelite Irom 
his hope &#8212; from his only stay of salvation&#63; Shall we not 
mourn&#44; that in the land of JNIoriah the stranger worships in his 
false belief&#44; and that the cities of our beloved land are the 

    <pb n="548"/>

248 THE MESSIAH. 

dwelling of robbers&#44; the abode of ravenous beasts&#63; that the 
fields are deserted&#44; and the plains rendered desolate &#63; Shall we 
not call in our agony to the Lord&#44; when we are told&#44; that to us&#44; 
of all men&#44; the rights of man must be denied&#44; that the children 
of the faith are unworthy of trust &#8212; destitute of honour &#8212; solely 
because they build their faith on one God &#8212; on one law&#63; Shall 
we not pray to Him&#44; who is alone the Lord of vengeance&#44; to 
require the blood&#44; the innocent blood&#44; of his servants that has 
flowed in streams unmeasured&#44; because they would not forsake 
Him&#44; their Father and God &#63; &#8212; Aye&#44; surely&#44; these and many 
more have been . the consequences of our dispersion and 
dismemberment&#44; and it is&#44; therefore&#44; reasonable to hope&#44; that&#44; 
since God will send the Messiah to restore peace on earth&#44; 
He will also cause our dispersions to be gathered and united 
again in a land&#44; which was their own&#44; the land of Palestine in 
which their forefathers dwelt. Upon a farther search into our 
history we will discover&#44; that nearly all the calamities&#44; to which 
our nation has ever been subject&#44; had their origin in a want of 
unanimity among ourselves&#44; and the absence of a devotion to 
God. If now all the dispersed Israelites should be assembled 
together in one body&#44; and there should be a diversity of inter&#8211; 
ests prevalent among them&#44; no permanent union could be 
thought of. And if even a political unit of feeling should 
exist&#44; but a rebellion towards God be encouraged : the peace 
thus upheld would be of small advantage&#44; whilst every act of 
ours would anew call down the oft&#8211;experienced vengeance of 
Heaven. Just as at the time of Jeroboam&#44; division of the 
kingdom into Judah and Israel caused at first contention 
among the rival chiefs&#59; and when the latter&#44; in order to make 
more complete their severance from the family of David&#44; 
induced their subjects to throw off the yoke of the divine law : 
expulsion from their land and banishment to distant climes 
were the doom of the wicked and apostate race. Would it 
then be wise in God to gather the Israelites without removing 
these great stumbling&#8211;blocks &#63; Assuredly not&#44; especially as 
we always see&#44; that the actions of God on earth never fail of 
effecting a useful end. We must therefore come to the conclu&#8211; 
sion&#44; that at the appropriate time a reassemblage of all the 
children of Israel will take place&#44; and that the returning 

    <pb n="549"/>

captives will be without envy towards each other&#44; and all 
devoted&#44; heart and soul&#44; to the service of their Maker. You 
will observe&#44; brethren&#44; that in all these deductions we have not 
quoted a single Bible&#8211;text&#59; and still we may freely challenge the 
exposition of the want of a single connexion between the argu&#8211; 
ment and the conclusion arrived at&#44; although merely deduced 
from common reasoning. But these views&#44; thus proved to be 
reasonable&#44; are also perfectly&#39; consonant with the doctrines and 
the evident text of the prophecies &#59; and according to our usual 
method&#44; we will now proceed to adduce a number of parallel 
passages from various prophets&#44; all tending to prove the inten&#8211; 
tion of God to preserve the Israelites amidst their captivity&#44; 
and to restore them again to their former land&#44; united under 
one head and devoted to the laws given through the servant&#44; 
faithful in the whole house of the Lord. &#8212; Moses&#44; the father of 
the prophets&#44; speaks thus &#40;Deut. xxx.&#44; beginning at verse 1) : 
&#34; And it shall come to pass&#44; when all these things have come 
over thee&#44; the blessing and the curse&#44; which I have laid before 
thee&#44; and thou wilt reflect in thy heart&#44; in the midst of all the 
nations&#44; whither the Lord thy God has banished thee &#59; and 
thou do return unto the Lord thy God&#44; and hearken unto his 
voice&#44; according to all I command thee this day&#44; thyself and 
thy children&#44; with all thy heart and all thy soul : then will 
the Lord thy God restore thy captives&#44; and will return and 
gather thee from all the people&#44; whither the Lord thy God has 
scattered thee. If thy dispersions shall be at the end of heaven&#44; 
from there even the Lord thy God will gather thee&#44; and thence 
He will take thee. And the Lord thy God will bring thee 
unto the land which thy fathers possessed&#44; and cause thee to 
possess it&#59; and He will do good unto thee&#44; and multiply thee 
above thy fathers. And the Lord thy God will circumcise 
thy heart and the hearts of thy descendants&#44; to love the Lord 
thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul&#44; that thou mayest 
live.&#34; In the same book &#40;xxxii. 36) we read : &#34; For the Lord 
will judge his people&#44; and have compassion on his servants&#44; when 
he sees that the power is gone&#44; and the strong and the fortified 
are no more.&#34; In these two striking passages we are distinctly 
told&#44; that a state of things&#44; like the one now existing&#44; would one 
day be experienced&#44; that it should be &#34; a day of trouble to 

    <pb n="550"/>

250 THE MESSIAH. 

Jacob &#59;&#34; but that nevertheless the remnant would not be cut off&#59; 
but that at the end of days a change is to come over the face of 
the desolation&#44; so that the captives should return from the most 
distant climates&#44; and&#44; converted to the service of the Lord&#44; 
live peaceably in their own land&#44; worthy servants of the Most 
High&#44; and eminently deserving of his favour. But before this 
could come to pass&#44; all the previously announced evil must 
have occurred&#44; even to the extent of an entire dismemberment 
of the people&#44; in small bodies&#44; all over the earth&#59; although at 
the moment the prophecy was spoken they were travelling 
under one leader in the desert of Arabia&#44; separate and distinct 
from every other nation. Without any farther reference every 
one must be struck with the exact state of the Jews so pointedly 
foretold&#44; and the precise accomplishment of the blessings for 
obedience&#44; and the curses for rebellion so emphatically an&#8211; 
nounced. Without even the concurrence of other prophets the 
events actually experienced would stamp the prediction of 
Moses as true and proved &#59; but the confirmation becomes 
doubly strong&#44; when we draw in the testimony of other mes&#8211; 
sengers&#44; all speaking before the banishment had been wholly or 
partially come to pass. &#8212; Let us refer to Isaiah &#40;xi. ch&#44; beginning 
v. 10): &#34;And it shall be on that day&#44; the root of Jesse&#44; who 
stands as the banner of people&#44; to him the nations shall come 
to inquire&#44; and his rest shall be glorious. And it shall come 
to pass on that day&#44; the Lord will again stretch forth his hand 
to buy the remnant of his people that will be left from Assyria&#44; 
and from Egypt&#44; and from Patross&#44; and from Ethiopia&#44; and 
from Elam&#44; and from Shinar&#44; and from Hamath&#44; and from the 
islands of the sea. And He will raise a banner unto the 
nations&#44; and gather the banished of Israel&#44; and the scattered 
of Judah He will assemble from the four corners of the earth&#33;&#34; 
The prophet here speaks in confirmation of Moses. He first 
alludes to the king Messiah&#44; the root of Jesse&#44; and asserts&#44; that 
he should become a teacher&#44; not alone to Israel&#44; but to the 
whole world besides&#59; not that he should go after them&#44; but 
that they should seek him out&#44; to inquire of him the way of 
salvation&#44; as was also said in the second chapter: &#34;From Zion 
shall go out the law and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.&#34; 
The next assertion is&#44; that the Israelites should not be left in a 

    <pb n="551"/>

THE MESSIAH. 251 

scattered state&#44; but that from every place&#44; whithersoever they 
may have wandered&#44; they should be called together into one body. 
The Bible mentions the countries of Asia and Africa&#44; and 
even the islands of the sea&#44; those distant regions&#44; where at that 
time none of the scattered of Judah dwelt&#59; since the destruction 
of the kingdom of Judah did not take place till long after the 
death of Isaiah. It must also be taken into account&#44; that only a 
remnant were to return&#33; a remnant&#44; understand&#33; for the greater 
part should perish in the enemy&#39;s land. How fearfully has 
this been verified &#33; Had our numbers not been thinned by the 
wars of extermination waged for the liundredth time against us&#44; 
and by the destroying persecutions which spared neither age 
nor sex : our nation would by this time not have been the in&#8211; 
significant body it is now &#59; but still a remnant has been left&#44; 
an indestructible remainder has survived&#44; and this very hand&#8211; 
ful&#44; compared to the rest of mankind&#44; continues to this very 
hour the special object of care to an overruling Providence&#44; and 
is the subject of the outpourings of the divine spirit over men&#44; 
the wisest and most virtuous with whom the world was ever 
blest. &#8212; After having stated the intended gathering from the 
four corners of the earth&#44; Isaiah continues : &#34; Then shall depart 
the envy of Ephraim&#44; and the enemies of Judah shall cease &#59; 
Ephraim shall no longer envy Judah&#44; and Judah no longer be 
the enemy of Ephraim.&#34; Chap. li. 11&#44; we read: &#34; And the 
ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with re&#8211; 
joicing&#44; and everlasting joy shall be on their heads&#44; pleasure and 
joy they shall overtake&#44; and flee away will trouble and sighing.&#34; 
&#8212; Chap. lii. 2 : &#34; Rouse thyself out of the dust&#44; sit down in 
glory&#44; Jerusalem&#44; open the bonds on thy neck&#44; captive daughter 
of Zion. For thus saith the Lord&#44; for nothing you were sold&#44; and 
not for silver shall you be redeemed&#59;&#34; ver. 6: &#34; Therefore shall 
my people know my name. Verily on that day&#44; for I am He that 
speak it&#44; here I am ever. How lovely are on the mountains 
the feet of the announcing messenger&#44; that bringeth tidings of 
peace&#44; that announceth the good&#44; that bringeth tidings of salva&#8211; 
tion&#44; that sayeth to Zion : &#39;Thy king reigneth.&#39; The voice 
of thy watchmen&#44; they all raise their voice&#44; they shout&#44; for eye 
to eye they shall see&#44; when the Lord returneth to Zion. Siiout 
loudly together&#44; ruins of Jerusalem&#44; for the Lord has comforted

his people&#44; has redeemed Jerusalem.&#34; Chap. lix. 19: &#34;And 
they shall fear from the West the name of the Lord&#44; and from 
the rising of the sun his glory &#8212; and for Zion shall come the 
redeemer&#44; and for them that return from their sin in Jacob&#44; 
says the Lord. And this is my covenant with them&#44; says the 
Lord : My spirit which is upon thee&#44; and my words which I 
have put in thy mouth&#44; shall not depart thence&#44; and out the 
mouth of thy children&#44; and out the mouth of thy children&#39;s chil&#8211; 
dren&#44; says the Lord&#44; from now and for ever.&#34; What has just 
been adduced from the two prophets only will go to maintain 
our positions&#44; that though the Messiah is certainly to be the 
harbinger of peace to the whole earth&#44; it never entered into the 
contemplation of the seers of God to exclude the children of 
the covenant from a participation in the promised happiness. 
For what does Moses say : &#34; And the Lord will circumcise thy 
heart&#44; that thou mayest love the Lord thy God&#44; that thou 
mayest live.&#34; Does this not prove that on no account would 
the Almighty suffer his people to reject the chosen redeemer &#63; 
&#34; That thou mayest live&#44;&#34; says the prophet. Does not this 
presuppose that no crime deserving of rejection should be done 
by the Israelites with regard to Messiah &#63; And says Lsaiah : 
&#34; And for Zion shall come the redeemer&#44; and them that return 
from sin in Jacob.&#34; If even there could be a doubt about the 
meaning of the word Zion&#44; which as some suppose means all 
those as have been brought by grace under the dominion of the 
Lord&#44; to which explanation&#44; let it be remarked&#44; we would not 
much object&#44; if taken merely as an accommodation and not as 
argument : still the words : &#34; And them that return from sin in 
Jacob&#44;&#34; would fix the prophecy upon the literal descendant of 
the patriarchs especially&#44; for it is they who have transgressed&#44; 
and have drawn upon themselves the indignation of the Lord. 
Besides the concluding words of the covenant : &#34; From now 
and for ever&#44;&#34; confirm the construction of the passage in favour 
of the theory we are advocating in our address of this day. 
For at the time of Isaiah the spirit of God and his word were 
only in the mouth of the Israelites&#44; consequently when he says&#44; 
&#34; from now&#34; &#8212; from the moment I am speaking &#8212; it must be 
referring to those blessed with the possessions of the Word&#44; and 
of these possessors he says&#44; &#34;that the spirit should never 

    <pb n="553"/>
    
THE MESSIAH. 253 

depart from them&#44; consequently to them too&#44; and for them the 
redeemer must come &#59; and to their Zion&#44; the city of Jerusalem&#44; 
he will repair to plant there&#44; on the mountains of Israel&#44; the 
standard of salvation&#44; to which the nations shall flock. The 
restored Zion&#44; the rebuilt temple&#44; must be possessed by those 
who&#44; sold for no price&#44; are to be redeemed without silver&#59; they 
who&#44; for their sins expelled from the most lovely inheritance&#44; 
will be restored to their home by repentance and good deeds. 
In their restored land also they shall dwell for ever&#44; with none 
to make them afraid&#44; and the storm of desolation&#44; and the besom 
of destruction&#44; which have so often passed over them&#44; shall no 
longer be felt&#44; for no one that is unclean of heart and defiled by 
wickedness will any longer pass among them. &#8212; And to illus&#8211; 
trate this farther&#44; we will extract one more passage from Isaiah&#44; 
chap. liv. V. S : 

&#34; In a short anger I have hid my face from thee&#44; but in everlasting kind&#8211; 
ness I have mercy on thee&#44; says thy Redeemer the everlasting One.&#34; 

And he continues emphatically : &#34; For like the flood of Noah 
this shall be to me&#44; as I have sworn&#44; that the flood of Noah shall 
no more pass over the earth&#44; thus I have sworn not to be angry 
any more over thee or to injure thee. For mountains may 
move&#44; and hills may waver &#59; but my kindness from thee shall 
not move&#44; and the covenant of my peace shall not waver&#44; says 
the Lord that has compassion on thee.&#34; 

Can words be more forcible &#63; can love be more ardent&#63; can 
truth be more unwavering&#44; than are here presented to us &#63; &#8212; 
Israel forsaken &#63; Jacob rejected &#63; As well may the mother for&#8211; 
get her offspring&#44; cease cherishing the child of her own body &#59; 
yea&#44; if these even could be forgotten&#44; God would not forget us&#44; 
never would He deny us the hope of his salvation. But verily 
the redeemer will be sent to comfort the captives of the lonely 
people&#44; who have so long borne the contumely of a proud 
world&#44; because they have forsaken the law of their Father&#44; who 
redeemed them from bondage to be his people and treasure &#33;

THE MESSIAH. 



Lord op glory &#33; we call on Thee for protection&#33; How 
long yet shall thy children sufifer&#63; how long yet shall thy 
inheritance sojourn in the land of the stranger&#63; May it be thy 
will&#44; gracious Father&#33; again to have compassion upon those 
that have so long borne the weight of thy wrath&#44; and gather 
them from all nations&#44; and unite them as one people on the 
mountains of their heritage&#44; even the land of Israel&#44; which 
thou hast sworn to give unto their fathers&#44; and their children 
after them&#44; as an everlasting possession. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 
In our last address&#44; on the subject of the expected deliverer&#44; 
we adduced concurrent testimony from two prophets&#44; to prove 
that a great benefit is to result to Israel from his mission. &#8212; In 
continuation we must observe&#44; that the disposition to forsake 
the covenant of the Lord has always been the source of the 
greatest misfortunes that befel us&#44; ever since we were a people. 
If now a time should appear&#44; when a greater love and a more 
uniform adherence to the law of Heaven were to be cultivated: 

    <pb n="555"/>

THE MESSIAH. 255 

then it is also reasonable to suppose&#44; that the happiness of the na&#8211; 
tion so acting would be more amply secured than by any other 
means known to us&#59; since &#34;the ways of religion are the ways 
of pleasantness&#44; and all her paths are peace.&#34; And that such a 
time is impending&#44; appears clearly from the prophecies of Jere&#8211; 
miah&#44; who says &#40;iii. 14&#8211;17): &#34;Return&#44; backsliding children&#33; 
says the Lord&#44; although I felt disgust towards you&#59; now I will 
take one out of a city&#44; and two out of a family&#44; and bring you 
to Zion. And I will give you shepherds after my own heart&#44; 
and they shall feed you in knowledge and understanding. And 
it shall come to pass&#44; when you increase and multiply in the 
land in those days&#44; says the Lord&#44; men shall no more say&#44; &#39;The 
ark of the covenant of ihe Lord&#44;&#39; for it shall not come into 
the thoughts&#44; and people will not remember it&#44; and not men&#8211; 
tion it&#44; and nothing shall be done any more through it. But in 
those days they will call Jerusalem&#44; The throne of the Lord&#44; and 
unto it all the nations shall assemble&#44; to the name of the Lord&#44; 
unto Jerusalem&#59; and they shall no more go after the wicked&#8211; 
ness of their bad heart.&#34; The meaning of this prophecy seems 
to be&#44; that at the time of the advent&#44; God will select the few 
that escaped the many persecutions and the great hardships of 
a long captivity&#44; and restore them to their former land&#44; where 
He will appoint rulers who&#44; mindful only of justice and truth&#44; 
shall rule the people after the holy law&#44; which is&#44; in truth&#44; 
knowledge and understanding. In those days the Israelites 
shall multiply and increase&#44; and none shall disturb them&#59; and 
no one shall any longer swear by the ark of the covenant&#44; for 
the whole congregation&#44; in all their assemblies&#44; shall be holy&#59; 
wonders shall be wrought every where &#59; God&#39;s majesty shall 
appear at all places&#59; and to the throne of the Lord at Jerusalem 
shall flock the nations to worship the holy Name&#44; the ONE 
God&#59; and no more shall wickedness of heart mislead them to 
sin. How strangely&#44; how strongly&#44; does this agi&#39;ee with the 
annunciation of Isaiah&#33; and the coincidence is the more re&#8211; 
markable&#44; since the phraseology is so entirely different. In 
farther confirmation of the foregoing&#44; let us examine the thirty&#8211; 
first chapter of the same book&#44; ver. 1 : &#34; In those days&#44; says the 
Lord&#44; I will be God to all the families of Israel&#44; and they shall 
be my people.&#34; Ver. 27&#8211;34: &#34;Behold days are coming&#44; says 

    <pb n="556"/>

256 THE MESSIAH. 

the Lord&#44; when I will sow the house of Israel&#44; and the house 
of Judah&#44; seed of man and seed of cattle. And it shall hap&#8211; 
pen&#44; that as I have watched over them to break in&#44; to batter&#44; to 
pull down&#44; to destroy&#44; and to do evil : thus will I watch over them 
to build up and to plant&#44; says the Lord&#44; In those days they 
shall no more say. The parents have eaten green fruit&#44; and the 
teeth of the children are blunted&#59; but every one for his own 
sin shall die&#59; each man that eats green fruit&#44; his teeth shall be 
blunted. Behold days are coming&#44; says the Lord&#44; when I will 
make with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new 
covenant. Not like the covenant which I made with their fathers&#44; 
on the day&#44; when I took hold of their hand to bring them out of 
the land of Egypt&#44; which my covenant they violated&#44; and I felt 
disgust towards them&#44; says the Lord &#59; for this is the covenant&#44; 
which I will make with the house of Israel after those days&#44; 
says the Lord : I have placed my law in their inmost part&#44; and 
upon their heart I will write it&#44; and I will be their God&#44; and 
they shall be my people. And not shall they any more teach 
one his neighbour and one&#39; his brother&#44; saying: &#39; Know ye the 
way of the Lord &#33;&#39; for they all shall know me&#44; from their 
small to their great ones&#44; says the Lord&#44; for I will pardon their 
transgression&#44; and their sin I will no more remember.&#34; &#8212; In 
order to present a connected view of the message spoken to 
Jeremiah&#44; I have extracted a considerable part of it&#44; although 
against our usual custom to make so long a quotation. It will 
be perceived&#44; that we are promised two things: the first&#44; tem&#8211; 
poral security in our own land &#59; and the second&#44; a renewal of 
the covenant which the Israelites had broken&#44; much to the dis&#8211; 
pleasure of their God. The first promise requires at present 
no exposition&#44; having spoken on the subject on former occa&#8211; 
sions&#59; but concerning the new covenant a few words&#44; by way 
of explanation&#44; may perhaps be useful. The words are : 
&#34;Behold&#44; days are coming when I will make with the house of 
Israel and the house of Judah a new covenant.&#34; The parties 
are stated&#44; not to be the nations of the earth&#44; not a spiritual 
Israel&#44; but the actual descendants from the line of Jacob&#44; the 
houses of Israel and Judah. If a spiritual nation were m.eant&#44; 
the prophet would not have particularized&#59; for the double fami&#8211; 
ly is not applicable to a spiritual symbol&#44; but only&#44; as said&#44; to 

    <pb n="557"/>

THE MESSIAH. 257 

the nation that was at that time divided into the two contending 
divisions. Says the Text : &#34; Not like the covenant which I 
made with their fathers&#44;&#34; for this covenant was over and again 
neglected by the parties to be benefitted by its institution &#59; but 
a new contract&#44; a new agreement&#44; of a more permanent kind&#44; 
is to be entered into&#44; to observe the laws emanating from God&#44; 
or in the words used in the Bible : &#34; I have placed my law in 
their inmost part and upon their heart I will write it.&#34; What is 
this that is to be written&#63; &#8212; the new covenant.&#39;&#39; or if you will&#44; 
a new law&#63; by no means &#8212; the law of God which was given in 
former days&#44; this is to be written upon the heart of the peo&#8211; 
ple &#59; by which figurative phrase is to be conveyed&#44; that hence&#8211; 
forward the ordinances and statutes of the law should be indeli&#8211; 
bly fixed in the affection of our nations&#44; so that they should 
never depart therefrom. Nay&#44; more&#44; the knowledge of God 
and his precepts shall be so universally diffused&#44; that no one 
will need to ask for instruction concerning his duties&#44; since all 
shall be taught by the Creator himself. Where is here to be 
discovered the smallest allusion or the most remote reference to 
a new dispensation&#44; or a change in the commandments which 
were to be&#44; and are&#44; immutable&#63; It is idle to assert&#44; that the 
words covenant and law are synonymous&#59; for if this were so&#44; 
why do we always find the former used when a contract be&#8211; 
tween parties is meant&#44; and the latter when duties to be exe&#8211; 
cuted are spoken of&#63; And so we read in Genesis xvii. 8&#8211;10 : 
&#34; And I will give unto thee&#44; and to thy descendants after thee&#44; 
the land of thy sojourning&#44; all the land of Canaan&#44; for an ever&#8211; 
lasting inheritance &#59; and I will be their God. And the Lord 
said to Abraham&#44; But thou must observe my covenant&#44; thou 
and thy descendants after thee&#44; for all their generations. This 
is my covenant which ye shall observe between me and between 
you&#44; and between thy descendants after thee&#44; circumcise unto 
yourselves every male.&#34; Ver. 21 : &#34;But my covenant I will 
erect with Isaac.&#34; So also in Exodus xix. 5 : &#34; And now if 
you will hearken to my voice and observe my covenant&#44; you 
shall be to me a dearly beloved people more than all nations&#59; 
for all the earth is mine.&#34; In these passages&#44; it will be feeen&#44; 
the word covenant is used&#44; although applied to the law&#44; in the 
sense of a contract&#44; by which the people and the father of this 

22&#42;

people&#44; Abraham&#44; were to be bound by certain stipulations&#44; in 
return for which they should receive the more immediate and 
constant protection of God. But a much stronger exemplifica&#8211; 
tion we find in Leviticus xxvi. 14&#8211;15 : &#34; But if you will not 
hearken to me&#44; and not do all these commandments &#59; and if you 
will despise my statutes&#44; and your soul find disgust in my judg&#8211; 
ments&#44; by not doing all my commandments to destroy my 
covenant.&#34; Here&#44; the not doing the commandments is termed 
breaking the covenant&#44; or&#44; we are told&#44; that the people by not 
doing the duties of religion&#44; which is their part of the contract&#44; 
would forfeit God&#39;s love and favour&#44; which&#44; on his part of the 
contract&#44; was to be bestowed in return for obedience. &#8212; So also : 
&#34; And He told you his covenant&#44; which He commanded you to 
do&#44; the ten commandments.&#34; Deut. iv. 14. And: &#34;It shall 
come to pass&#44; if you will hearken to these judgments&#44; and ob&#8211; 
serve and do them : then will the Lord observe to thee the 
covenant and the kindness which He has sworn to thy fathers.&#34; 
Ibid. vii. 12. Farther: &#34;And they shall say. Because they 
forsook the covenant of the Lord the God of their fathers&#44; 
which He made with them&#44; when He led them out of the land 
of Egypt. And they went&#44; and served strange gods&#44; and 
bowed down to them&#44; gods that they did not know&#44; and that He 
had not assigned to them.&#34; Deut. xxix. 24&#8211;25. It will be per&#8211; 
ceived from the various texts from the Pentateuch just given&#44; 
and which might be multiplied at pleasure&#44; that the words 
Berith covenant&#44; and Torah law&#44; are not the same &#59; and&#44; con&#8211; 
sequently&#44; when the prophet speaks of a new covenant&#44; he 
refers to a new contract or bargain&#44; to use a well&#8211;known homely 
phrase&#44; which should be so strongly adhered to&#44; that no infrac&#8211; 
tion of the law&#44; which is to be strictly observed on the part of 
the Israelites&#44; should ever take place any more&#44; as had been 
frequently the case before the time of the end&#44; and for which 
the infringers of the agreement between their God and them&#8211; 
selves had drawn upon themselves the wrath and indignation of 
Heaven. But now&#44; when no longer ignorance of the details of 
the law will be found among the people&#44; v.&#8211;hen all will know 
the Lord from the greatest to the least : then will the Almighty 
be their God&#44; and they shall be his people&#44; over whom He will

watch with particular care&#44; and whose sin He will have for&#8211; 
given. 

Of the other benefits&#44; to result from the coming of Messiah&#44; 
Jeremiah speaks no less than his great predecessor&#44; Isaiah. To 
place the matter in a strong light before you&#44; we will extract 
one passage referring to the punishment&#44; and another relating 
to the consolation of Israel. Chap. xvi. 9 : &#34; For thus says the 
Lord of hosts&#44; the God of Israel&#44; Behold&#44; I will cause to cease 
from this place before your own eyes&#44; and in your own days&#44; 
the voice of joy and the voice of gladness&#44; the voice of the 
bridegroom and the voice of the bride.&#34; But in chap&#44; xxxii. 
3G&#8211;41&#44; we are told : &#34; And now&#44; therefore&#44; thus saith the Lord 
God of Israel to this city&#44; which you say is given in the hands 
of the king of Babylon&#44; with the sword&#44; and famine&#44; and pes&#8211; 
tilence : Behold&#44; I will gather them from all the lands&#44; whither 
I have driven them&#44; in my wrath and my anger&#44; and great 
indignation &#59; and I will bring them back to this place&#44; and will 
make them dwell securely. And they shall be my people&#44; and 
I will be their God. And I will give unto them one heart and 
one way to fear me all the days&#44; in order that it may be good 
to them and to their children after them. And I will make 
with them a new covenant&#44; that I will not leave them again to 
do good unto them &#59; and my fear I will give into their heart&#44; 
that they shall not depart from me. And I will rejoice over 
them to do them good&#44; and I will plant them in this land in 
truth&#44; with all my heart and all my soul.&#34; &#8212; And then&#44; conti&#8211; 
nues Jeremiah&#44; chap&#44; xxxiii.&#44; after adverting to the destruction 
which Jerusalem was at that moment suffering through the 
Chaldeans : &#34; Behold&#44; I will cause to come unto her healing 
and recovery&#44; and I will heal them &#59; and 1 will lay open to 
them a blessing of peace and truth. And I will bring back the 
captives of Judah&#44; and the captives of Israel&#44; and build them 
up as at the first. And I will purify them from all their sin&#44; 
which they have sinned against me&#44; and I will pardon all their 
transgressions which they have sinned to me&#44; and which they 
have rebelled against me. And she &#40;Jerusalem) shall be to me 
a name of joy&#44; praise&#44; and glory &#8212; and to all the nations of the 
earth&#44; who will hear all the good which I do to them &#40;the Israel&#8211; 
ites)&#44; and they shall tremble and shake on account of all the

good and on account of all the peace which I do unto her. &#8212; 
Thus says the Lord&#44; There shall yet be heard in this place&#44; 
which you say is desolate without man and without cattle&#44; in 
the cities of Judah&#44; and in the streets of Jerusalem that are 
waste without man&#44; and without inhabitant&#44; and without cattle : 
the voice of joy and the voice of gladness&#44; the voice of the 
bridegroom and the voice of the bride&#44; the voice of them that 
say : &#39; Praise ye the Lord of hosts&#44; for the Lord is good&#44; for 
to everlasting is his mercy&#44;&#39; that bring a thank&#8211;offering to the 
house of the Lord&#44; for I will bring back the captives of the 
land as formerly&#44; saith the Lord. &#8212; Thus has spoken the Lord 
of hosts&#44; There yet shall be in this place&#44; that is desolate with&#8211; 
out man and even cattle&#44; and in all its cities&#44; a place for shep&#8211; 
herds&#44; who make the sheep lie down &#59; in the cities of the 
mountain&#44; in the cities of the plain&#44; and in the cities of the 
South&#44; and in the land of Benjamin&#44; and in the neighbourhood 
of Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah&#44; the flocks shall again 
pass under the hands of him that counts them&#44; says the Lord&#34; 
&#40;ver. 6&#8212;1.3). In continuation&#44; the prophet speaks of the Mes&#8211; 
siah by name&#44; calling him David&#44; and predicts that security 
shall prevail all over the land. The announcement just given 
is also confirmed by Zechariah : &#34; Thus saith the Lord of 
hosts&#44; I have revenged for Zion a great revenge&#44; and a great 
anger I have revenged for her. Thus saith the Lord&#44; I have 
returned to Zion&#44; and I will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem &#59; 
and Jerusalem shall be called &#39; The city of truth&#44;&#39; and the mount 
of the Lord of hosts&#44; the &#39; Holy mountain.&#39; Thus saith the 
Lord of hosts&#44; yet shall dwell old men and old women in the 
streets of Jerusalem&#44; each with his staff in his hand from great 
age &#59; and the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls&#44; 
playing in its streets.&#34; Chap. viii. 2&#8211;5. &#34; Thus saith the Lord 
of hosts. Behold I will save my people from the land of the 
rising and from the land of the setting of the sun. And I will 
bring them&#44; and they shall dwell in Jerusalem&#44; and they shall 
be my people&#44; and I will be their God&#44; in truth and in righte&#8211; 
ousness.&#34; Ibid. 7&#8211;8. Further: &#34; And I will bring them back 
from the land of Egypt&#44; and from the land of Assyria I will 
gather them&#44; and to the land of Gilead and to the Lebanon I 
will bring them&#44; but it shall not be enough for them.&#34; x. 10.

THE MESSIAH. 261 

&#34; And I will make them strong in the Lord&#44; and in his name 
they shall walk&#44; saith the Lord.&#34; Ibid. ver. 12. 

These extracts clearly prove&#44; that the restoration of Israel is 
to be accompanied by a change of the heart&#44; which change will 
produce an acquiescence in the decrees of Heaven and a uni&#8211; 
formity of sentiment and action. Ezekiel&#44; one of the seers of 
the Lord&#44; also confirms the above messages in different parts of 
his book&#44; and speaks of a union and good fellowship that are 
to prevail among the people of the Lord&#44; and of an entire de&#8211; 
pendence they are to show towards their Maker. These are 
his words : &#34; Therefore say to the house of Israel&#44; thus saith 
the Lord God&#44; Not for your sakes will I do it&#44; house of Israel&#44; 
but for the sake of my name&#44; which you have profaned among 
the nations whither you have gone. And I will sanctify my 
holy name which has been profaned among the heathen&#44; which 

you have profaned among them. And I will take you from 

among the nations&#44; and gather you from all the countries&#44; and 
bring you to your own land. And I will sprinkle upon you 
clean water and you shall be clean&#59; from all your uncleanliness 
and from all your abominations I will cleanse you. And I will 
give you a new heart&#44; and a new spirit I will put within you&#44; 
and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give 
you a heart of flesh. And my spirit I will put within you&#44; and 
I will cause&#44; that in my statutes you shall go&#44; and my judgments 
keep and do them. And you shall dwell in the land which I 
have given to your ancestors&#44; and you shall be my people&#44; and 
I will be your God.&#34; xxxvi. 22&#8211;28. And in continuance we 
read: &#34; And speak to them. Thus saith the Lord God&#44; Behold 
I take the children of Israel from between the nations whither 
they have wandered&#44; and I will gather them from around&#44; and 
bring them unto their own land. And I will make them unto 
one nation in the land&#44; on the mountains of Israel&#44; and one 
king shall be to them all as king&#44; and they shall be no more 
tioo nations&#44; nor be any more divided into two kingdoms. 
And they shall not defile themselves any more with their idols&#44; 
and with their abominations&#44; and with all their transgressions &#59; 
and I will save them from all their places where they have 
sinned&#44; and I will purify them&#44; and they shall be my people&#44; 
and I will be their God. And my servant David shall be king 

    <pb n="562"/>

262 THE MESSIAH. 

over them&#44; and one shepherd shall he to them all&#44; and in my 
judgments they shall walk&#44; and my statutes they shall observe 
and do them. And they shall dwell upon the land which I 
have given to my servant Jacob&#44; in which their fathers have&#42; 
dwelt &#59; and they shall dwell there&#44; themselves and their chil&#8211; 
dren&#44; and their children&#39;s children for ever&#44; and my servant 
David shall be prince to them for ever. And I will make 
with them a covenant of peace&#44; an everlasting covenant it shall 
be with them &#59; and I will place them&#44; and multiply them&#44; and 
fix my sanctuary among them for ever. And my residence 
shall be over them&#44; and I will be their God&#44; and they shall be 
my people. And the nations shall know&#44; that I am the Lord&#44; 
who sanctify Israel&#44; when my sanctuary is among them for 
ever.&#34; xxxvii. 21&#8211;28. 

How any one professing a veneration for the prophecies of 
the Lord can at all misapprehend the obvious import of these 
consolatory messages&#44; is indeed suprizing&#44; and our astonishment 
will not be a little increased&#44; when we discover that the same 
sentiments are expressed by other prophets besides those 
already cited. For so says Hosea : &#34; And I will make for 
them a covenant on that day with the beasts of the field&#44; and 
with the fowl of heaven&#44; and the creeping things of the earth &#59; 
and the bow&#44; and sword&#44; and war I will break from the earth&#44; 
and they shall dwell securely. And I will betrothe thee to me for 
ever&#59; and I will betrothe thee to me with righteousness and with 
justice&#44; and with kindness and with mercy&#59; and I will betrothe 
thee to me with faith&#44; and thou shalt know the Lord. ii. 20&#8211;22&#8211; 

Joel says : &#34; And you shall know that I am the Lord your 
God&#44; dwelling in Zion my holy mountain &#59; and Jerusalem shall 
be holy&#44; and strangers shall no more pass through it.&#34; iv. 17. 

Amos predicted : &#34; And I will return the captives of my 

people Israel and I will plant them upon their land&#44; and 

they shall no more be driven from their land&#44; which I have 
given them&#44; says the Lord thy God.&#34; ix. 14&#8211;15. 

So also Zephaniah : &#34; At the time I will bring you&#44; and at 
the time I will gather you &#59; for I will give you name and 
praise with all the nations of the earth&#44; when I bring back your 
captives before your eyes&#44; says the Lord.&#34; iii. 20. 

From the whole of the extracts adduced&#44; it will be clearly 

    <pb n="563"/>

THE MESSIAH. 263 

perceived&#44; that&#44; when the time of the Lord arrives&#44; the follow&#8211; 
ing must take place. First&#44; the Israelites will be assembled 
from all the countries&#44; where they are now scattered. &#8212; Secondly&#44; 
division and contention among themselves will no more take 
place. &#8212; Thirdly&#44; they are to dwell securely each under his 
own vine and each under his own fig&#8211;tree&#44; undisturbed by any 
foreign foe or invader. &#8212; Fourthly&#44; plenty and fruitfulness are 
to prevail in all the land of Israel&#44; which is to be far more 
extensive than it was at any time before. &#8212; Fifthly&#44; the rule of 
the Messiah will prevent the exercise of injustice and oppres&#8211; 
sion. &#8212; And lastly&#44; the universal acquiescence in the will of 
God&#44; will preclude the recurrence of the pouring out of the 
wrath of Heaven over the Israelites&#44; or in the words of the 
prophet : &#34; The sin of Israel will be sought and shall be no 
more&#44; and the transgression of Judah will not be found.&#34; &#8212; 
These in short are the advantages which are to result to our 
people from the advent of the anointed of the Lord &#59; and 
although the prophets furnish yet more ample and minute 
details of events to occur in those days : still as the subject has 
been so long kept under your consideration&#44; it is necessary to 
bring it to a close at present &#59; I do not however relinquish the 
idea of resuming the discussion at a later period of more 
leisure&#44; when I trust to be able to treat it more clearly and 
intelligibly than I have done at present. 

We will now proceed to elucidate the last inquiry which we 
proposed : &#39; What benefit is to result to the world at large 
from the mission of the son of David &#63;&#34; This question has 
almost been answered already incidently&#44; when discussing the 
other points in the course of our investigation &#59; but still we will 
add a few especial elucidations drawn from the prophets. &#8212; In 
a preceding lecture we remarked&#44; that the desired object of many 
philanthropists&#44; the prevalence of universal peace&#44; will then 
be accomplished &#59; but what is more&#44; not peace alone&#44; but a 
universal religion is also to prevail&#44; and the knowledge of God 
and his commands is to spread all over the earth. &#8212; For so 
says Isaiah : &#34;And many nations shall go and say&#44; Come let us 
go up to the mountain of the Lord&#44; to the house of the God 
of Jacob&#44; and He shall teach us of his ways&#44; and we will walk 

    <pb n="564"/>

in his paths&#44; for from Zion shall go out the law and the word of 
God from Jerusalem. And He shall judge between the people&#44; 
and decide for many nations &#59; and they shall beat their swords 
into ploughshares&#44; and their spears into pruning&#8211;hooks &#59; no 
more shall lift up nation to nation the sword&#44; and they shall 
learn no more war.&#34; ii. 3&#8211;4. &#8212; &#34; And the Lord shall be exalted 
alone on that day. And the idols shall be utterly destroyed. &#8212; 
On that day man shall throw away his idols of silver and his 
idols of gold&#44; which they had made for worship.&#34; lb. 18&#8211;20. &#8212; 
&#34; They shall not injure and they shall not destroy&#44; in all my 
holy mountain&#44; for the earth shall be full of knowledge of the 
Lord as the waters cover the sea. And it shall be on that day&#44; 
the root of Jesse&#44; who stands as a banner for the people&#44; to him 
nations shall come to inquire&#44; and his rest shall be glorious.&#34; 
Ibid. xi. 9&#8211;10. &#8212; &#34; And I will do a sign with them&#44; and I will 
send from them those that escape to the nations Tarshish&#44; Pul 
and Lud&#44; that draw the bow. Tubal and Javan&#44; the distant 
islands that have not heard my fame and have not seen my 
glory&#44; and they shall tell my glory among the nations.&#34; Ibid. 
Ixvi. 19. 

And so also says Jeremiah : &#34; The Lord is my strength&#44; my 
protection&#44; and my refuge&#44; on the day of affliction &#59; to Thee 
nations will come from the ends of the earth&#44; and say&#44; But 
falsehood have we inherited from our fathers&#44; nothings in which 
there is no profit. Can a man make to himself gods &#63; but they 
are not gods. Therefore&#44; behold&#44; I will let them know at this 
time&#44; I will let them know my hand and my strength&#44; and they 
shall know that I am the Lord.&#34; xvi. 19&#8211;21. 

Micah&#44; in the commencement of the fourth chapter&#44; fully 
confirms the prophecy of Isaiah&#44; with regard to the cessation of 
war&#44; and says&#44; emphatically&#44; that there should be none to make 
the peaceable inhabitants afraid&#59; and Habakkuk&#44; in almost the 
words of the same prophet&#44; announces: &#34; For the earth shall 
be filled to know the glory of the Lord&#44; as the waters cover the 
sea.&#34; ii. 14. 

But of all the prophecies relating to this great and eventful 
change&#44; none is more explicit than Zephaniah&#44; who says: &#34;The 
Lord will be terrible unto them&#59; for he will famish all the 

    <pb n="565"/>

THE MESSIAH. 265 

gods of the earth: and men shall worship Him&#59; each from his 
place&#44; even all the isles of the heathen.&#34; ii. 10. And after 
adverting to the judgment of God&#44; he continues: 

&#34; But then I will change unto the nations a pure language&#59; tliat they may 
all call on the name of the Lord&#44; and serve Him with one spirit.&#34; iii. 9. 

It will thus appear that the will of God has been announced as 
desiring to bring all the nations under his rule&#44; that all shall call 
upon his name and serve him alone. This is farther confirmed 
by Zechariah who says: &#34;And there shall come many people and 
mighty nations to seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem&#44; and to 
offer their prayers before the Lord.&#34; viii. 22. So also Malachi 
&#40;i. 11): &#34; For from the rising of the sun to his setting my name 
is great among the nations&#44; and at every place is sacrificed and 
brought to&#34; my name a pure offering&#59; for my name is great 
among the nations&#44; saith the Lord of hosts.&#34; David speaks of 
the same change&#44; when saying: &#34; All the nations that Thou hast 
made shall come and bow down before Thee&#44; Lord&#44; and 
honour thy name.&#34; Psalm Ixxxvi. 9. 

Yes&#44; brethren&#33; the time will come&#44; when all nations will be 
brought to acknowledge alone the God that made the heavens by 
his might&#44; and the earth&#44; and all that fills it&#44; and serve Him in 
truth and sincerity. We cannot determine whether the whole of 
the Mosaic law is to be obeyed&#59; but it is most likely&#44; to judge 
from the language of Zechariah&#44; that a part only of the com&#8211; 
mandments&#44; such as are best suited to the gentiles&#44; will be im&#8211; 
posed on them&#59; at all events the religion of Heaven will be 
made the standard of right for all nations&#44; who are to leain 
&#39;• of the ways of the Lord.&#34; But as yet many people walk in 
ignorance&#59; &#34; they bow to vanity and emptiness&#44; and pray to 
gods that cannot help&#59;&#34; but one after the other will have the 
light made to dawn upon them&#44; till in yon glorious time the truth 
will be fully revealed. Already has one entire class of men a 
religion analagous to ours&#59; they declare the Lord to be God 
alone&#59; but they found their belief upon the sayings of a false

prophet. Another class&#44; smaller in number&#44; but more endowed 
with the blessings of education&#44; have separated themselves 
from the believers in a division of the deity&#44; and now believe 
in one God&#59; but they also put faith in a person whom we ac&#8211; 
knowledge not as a prophet sent to speak in the name of the 
Lord. But still the light is spreading&#59; aye&#44; despite of efforts 
of men&#44; truth will ultimately triumph&#44; when &#34; the glory of 
God will be revealed&#44; and all flesh shall see that the mouth of 
the Lord hath spoken it.&#34; Aye&#44; onward will be the march of 
lisht&#44; till it will be verified what was foretold: &#34;And I will 
display my greatness and holiness before the eyes of many 
nations&#44; and they shall know that I am the Lord.&#34; Higher 
and higher will rise the reverence for God&#59; more and more 
families will be taught to honour his holy Name&#33; superstition 
will yield her empire&#33; false worship will sink into oblivion&#33; 
unbelief will stand abashed&#33; and truly&#44; when our redeemer&#44; 
David&#44; son of Jesse of Bethlehem&#44; is sent: the universal law 
will be every where acknowledged&#44; truth will dwell in all 
places&#44; and in every house there will be worshippers of the 
Lord&#44; in every bosom there will beat a heart that acknowledges 
no prophet as the teacher of a heavenly law but Moses&#44; and no 
God save our almighty Father and Ruler&#44; who spoke all these 
words through his servants&#44; and faithfully kept his promises to 
those who hope for Him&#44; and long forthe time when He will dwell 
again in Zion. In those days and in that period will be fulfilled 
what the prophet predicted: &#34;The Lord shall be One&#44; and his 
name ONE.&#34; And all mankind shall then acknowledge&#44; that 
the Everlasting alone is King&#44; Creator&#44; and Preserver&#44; and to 
Him alone appertain the power&#44; and the glory&#44; and the do&#8211; 
minion&#33; 

This is the reign of the Messiah &#59; and this is the change 
which is impending. In the whole of the exposition laid be&#8211; 
fore you the Scriptures alone have been consulted&#44; and the 
subject was allowed to unfold itself gradually to your reflec&#8211; 
tion &#59; nothing unreasonable was brought forward in the course 
of the argument&#59; and thus&#44; by the favour of Heaven&#44; I have 
been permitted to add another demonstration to the well esta&#8211; 
blished fact&#44; that reason and revelation are not inconsistent. It 
is now time to draw my labours to a close&#59; and let me breathe 

    <pb n="567"/>

THE MESSIAH. 267 

the fervent hope&#44; that the pains and care&#44; which have been 
very great&#44; bestowed upon so interesting a subject&#44; may not 
have been without a commensurate share of benefit &#59; for myself 
at least it has been the case&#59; and the more I entered into the 
study of the scheme of revelation&#44; the more rivetted became 
my astonishment and veneration &#59; astonishment at the consis&#8211; 
tency of the whole chain of predictions &#59; and veneration for 
that great Being that spoke all&#44; and has also fulfilled&#44; as we daily 
see &#59; for in all our captivity&#44; and in all our wanderings&#44; it was 
his holy Spirit that ever upheld us. This beneficence will also 
guide the whole world&#44; and ultimately all will like us be led to 
fall down and worship before Him&#44; who is the Lord alone&#44; un&#8211; 
ending and omnipotent&#44; and without whom there is neither 
God&#44; Saviour&#44; nor Redeemer &#33; 

Sovereign of the universe &#33; Upheld by thy bounty&#44; sustain&#8211; 
ed by thy grace&#44; we have been preserved before Thee unto this 
day &#33; let us experience thy favour henceforward&#44; and guide 
us in thy knowledge to thy service. And cause thy spirit to 
breathe comfort into our souls when we are afliicted &#59; and cause 
all the sons of men to be enh&#39;ghtened of thy wisdom &#59; so that 
they too may be brought to thy worship&#44; as are the children of 
thy servants&#44; to whom Thou didst promise&#44; that Thou would 
be their God&#44; and never forsake them even in their captivity 
and sufferings. &#8212; do now display thy glory&#44; as Thou hast 
said&#44; and build up the temple where thy name is to dwell for 
ever&#44; and send the redeemer&#44; even thy anointed one&#44; to heal 
the wounds which we have been struck for our manifold trans&#8211; 
gressions. do it for the sake of thy holy name&#44; that has 
been profaned among the nations &#59; and let all the world see&#44; that 
thou art God in Israel&#44; and that there is none like Thee&#44; 
Thou&#44; who art our Creator&#44; God&#44; and King &#33; Amen.

Note. &#8212; The discourses on the subject of Messiah must not be viewed as 
a complete treatise&#44; but merely as an illustration of the doctrines connected 
therewith. I must also distinctly state&#44; that I hold myself alone responsible 
for the arguments and sentiments advanced&#44; and that whatever of error and 
deficiency may be discovered should not be laid as a fault against our reli . 
gion&#44; but solely to my inadequacy of doing the subject complete justice. I

would likewise state&#44; that when I began the discussion&#44; I thought of finish&#8211; 
ing it in one&#44; or at most&#44; in two lectures &#59; but by degrees&#44; becoming more 
interested than I myself at first expected&#44; I continued during several months&#44; 
and had at length to finish it&#44; almost abruptly&#44; because I had to draw the 
matter to some sort of a conclusion&#44; before these volumes had entirely gone 
through the press. I do not&#44; however&#44; ask to be excused for gross errors&#44; 
which I trust will not be found&#59; but only to receive the reader&#39;s indulgence&#44; 
if he should not find all he may wish or expect from me. But&#44; as I have 
said in the text&#44; I do yet hope of resuming the discussion at some future 
period &#59; and in the meantime I would be greatly obliged for any hints&#44; ad&#8211; 
vices&#44; or corrections from any one&#44; whether Israelite or not &#59; as I think&#44; that 
by a mutual interchange of opinions&#44; candidly and temperately exhibited&#39; 
the truth and holiness of the divine law will be best proved to the satisfac&#8211; 
tion of the many&#44; and the happiness and welfare of all.

Annual Report &#8212; Address &#8212; Psalm xc&#44; in conclusion. After which a liberal col&#8211;

PRAYER. 

Sovereign of the universe &#33; In thy house assembled&#44; we 
approach thy mercy&#39;s seat to ask thy blessing upon our humble 
endeavour. We know&#44; our Father &#33; that our strength is like 
weakness I)efore Thcc &#59; and that our wisdom is like folly before 
thy wisdom &#59; and that all our virtue must appear imperfection 
before thy holiness. &#8212; We humbly&#44; therefore&#44; beseech Thee to 
grant us thy assistance in our earnest striving to serve Thee&#44; 
and cause&#44; cause&#44; naught but what is pleasing and good in 
thy eyes to result from our labour. Let thy name be sanctified 
through us&#44; and may&#63;&#34; nothing occur through our means&#44; by 
which others might be led to sin. Open our hearts to a know&#8211; 
ledge of thy law&#44; and remove from us the heart of stone&#44; and 
give us a heart of flesh&#44; and a spirit willing to serve Thee. &#8212; 
Give also to us all&#44; and to each of thy children&#44; our daily 
bread&#44; and cause thy blessing to alight upon the work of our 
hands &#59; so that we may&#44; each and all&#44; receive our maintainance 
from thy hand which is full&#44; and open&#44; and holy&#44; and ample&#44; 
and which scatters bounties to all flesh and creatures&#44; that were

created by thy potent word &#59; and cause us not to stand in need 
of the gifts of flesh and blood&#44; nor of their loans &#59; for their 
gifts are small&#44; and their shame is great. But&#44; if Thou hast 
decreed poverty and affliction as our lot on earth : then give 
us firmness to bear thy dispensations without repining&#44; and let 
our sorrows rise up to Thee&#44; as an atonement for our misdeeds&#44; 
and hear our prayer in thy holy abode&#44; in order to purify our 
hearts and to cleanse us from our transgressions &#59; so that&#44; shield&#8211; 
ed by thy grace&#44; we may live to please Thee&#44; and to merit 
thy mercy and forgiveness&#44; Thou&#44; who art our Father&#44; King&#44; 
and God &#33; Amen. 



ADDRESS. 

duty and scope of charity&#8211; 

Ladies and Gentlemen &#33; 

In the report of the managers which has just been read&#44; there 
have been exhibited to you the proceedings of a number of 
benevolent daughters of our people&#44; who for near twenty years 
have&#44; with means quite inadequate for so noble a purpose&#44; 
endeavoured to succour the distresses of their fellow&#8211;beings. 
There always has been&#44; and whilst society is organized as it 
now is&#44; there always must be&#44; a great share of suffering &#59; and 
whether the cause be inability to labour&#44; sickness&#44; loss of for&#8211; 
tune&#44; or lastly&#44; improvidence even : the sufferers have a claim 
upon the sympathies and means of those who are blessed with 
the opportunity and ability of granting relief. &#8212; But if indivi&#8211; 
duals be ever so kind&#44; if their hearts are ever open to the calls 
of humanity : still the poor&#44; especially if he has seen better 
days&#44; must feel some hesitation to lay his distressed situation 

    <pb n="571"/>

DUTY AND SCOPE OF CHARITY. 271 

open before them&#44; justly dreading a refusal&#44; even allowing that 
he should not fear&#44; nor need to fear&#44; being treated with unkind&#8211; 
ness&#44; besides having his petition unattended to. If&#44; however&#44; 
the sufferer knows that a society exists&#44; established for no other 
purpose&#44; acting from no other motive&#44; than dispensing good to 
all according to its ability : then he has a fund which he may 
call his own&#44; and friends in the managers of the charity&#44; who 
will soothe and solace him&#44; and look into his wants&#44; and relieve 
them&#44; whilst the fund for distribution is not totally exhausted. 
It is indeed a pursuit well worthy the daughters of our ancient 
race&#44; to become as it were the patrons of the needy ones &#59; to 
enter their humble dwellings&#44; perhaps in the dreary season of 
blighting winter&#44; and seek out a fellow&#8211;sister who&#44; like them&#44; 
may once have been radiant with youthful bloom&#44; shining forth 
with all the elegance of splendid attire&#44; and attractive by the 
sallies of wit and intelligence. &#8212; But through the vicissitudes&#44; 
to which all are liable&#44; sad reverses have befallen her &#59; one by 
one her friends have departed &#59; relative after relative was 
borne to the grave &#59; her worldly substance was swallowed up by 
unforeseen mishaps &#59; and now&#44; in some distant quarter of a large 
city&#44; she has been overtaken by the cold chill of winter&#44; with 
her resources exhausted&#44; and without the ability of earning the 
merest necessaries of life. The managers of a charity&#44; like the 
one before us&#44; enter her abode. The cheerful flame again visits 
her cold neglected hearth &#59; the exhausted larder is replenished&#59; 
and the lonely sufferer&#39;s heart is lightened by the kind 
and cheerful converse of the friendly sister&#44; and to heaven 
ascend the grateful thanks&#44; and upon the benevolent is poured 
out the blessing of a soul snatched from the gloom of despair&#44; 
now rejoicing over the timely assistance&#44; sent almost as was to 
the prophet of old the widow of Zarepta&#44; to feed him in the 
days of famine. &#8212; But my friends &#33; also like the means of the 
benevolent widow&#44; the funds of our society are but limited&#44; and 
often indeed have the managers had to husband their resources 
carefully and sparingly&#44; in order to enable them to grant a mode&#8211; 
rate relief to all standing in need of their assistance. And in sea&#8211; 
sons of severe cold&#44; their charitable intentions&#44; especially with 
regard to providing fuel for the poor&#44; which necessary article&#44; 
is often&#44; as you all know&#44; beyond the reach of those who most 

    <pb n="572"/>

272 DUTY AND SCOPE OF CHARITY. 

need it : the wants of the necessitous poor have not been ade&#8211; 
quately supplied &#59; since the managers&#44; in order to let none go 
unassisted&#44; had to divide the means at command in small por&#8211; 
tions among the many that needed. It is not to be denied 
that&#44; prompt to the call of distress&#44; our brethren always have 
been&#44; and no doubt always will be&#44; ready to dispense the bless&#8211; 
ings of benevolence to all that want &#59; I only need to call to 
mind one instance of not very old occurrence&#44; where sojourners 
and wanderers were amply provided for&#44; as soon as their neces&#8211; 
sities were made public. Still this does nowise do away with 
the propriety&#44; the duty I may say&#44; of better endowing a charity 
like our Ladies&#39; Benevolent Society&#44; and of strengthening their 
hands&#44; in order to enable them to permit the stream of their 
benevolence to flow in a broader and deeper channel. Perhaps&#44; 
hard thoughts may have been entertained at times&#44; when the 
relief was not so promptly and amply bestowed as those who 
interested themselves for the distressed ones thought it ought to 
be. But it should be remembered&#44; that before any thing is given&#44; 
it is the duty of the managers to investigate and look into the 
cases presented to them&#44; to prevent any improper waste of the 
fund entrusted to their care&#44; and to see that not the least thereof 
be diverted into improper channels. Nevertheless&#44; after satis&#8211; 
fying themselves that the applicant is fully deserving of aid&#44; it 
often happens that with the best intentions the managers have 
to stint their charity&#44; much to their sorrow&#44; because of the in&#8211; 
sufficiency of their means. It is to be regretted that&#44; as appears 
from the report of the board&#44; a part of their available means 
derived from interest on a certain investment&#42; has failed this 
year &#59; and the same may happen again&#44; and be another proof 
of the insufficiency of human caution and foresight to secure 
against unwelcome visitations. The more necessity there is 
for promptness of action in those charitably disposed. A season 
is approaching&#44; when in the ordinary course of events much 
suffering among the poor must be expected. This is the case 
in ordinary times&#44; when the Almighty has poured out ample 
stores over the earth for the sustenance of man. But in his 
wisdom&#44; which none of us dare to question. He has caused the

visitation of stinted crops to fall upon tliese shores&#44; that almost 
uniformly have hefore this teemed with plenty. In addition 
to this&#44; from the combination of the labouring and producing 
classes&#44; the price of almost every thing that enters into the use 
and consumption of a family has been raised to an exorbitant 
height. It must therefore be self&#8211;evident&#44; that many must be 
the poor&#44; who may not be able to procure their usual portion 
of comforts and necessaries&#44; if the coming winter should even 
be but moderately rigorous. But should it hold the earth in its 
icy fetters with the same severity&#44; and for an equal space as last 
year: who will be able to calculate the amount of suffering 
that would ensue&#33; Many persons who now can live&#44; and hitherto 
always have lived&#44; by the labour of their own hands&#44; will then 
not be able to do so any more&#44; and unless He who giveth food 
&#34; to the children of the raven&#44; when they cry&#34; sends them un&#8211; 
expected aid and enlargement: they will have to seek assistance 
from their fellow&#8211;mortals&#44; from those &#34; whose gifts are small&#44; 
and whose shame is great.&#34; Would it then not well befit de&#8211; 
scendants of Abraham&#44; to arise in time&#44; and to provide the 
&#34; poor man&#39;s treasure&#34; with means&#44; in order that it may bestow 
its blessings to all who may need &#63; &#8212; The institution in whose 
behalf this appeal is made to you&#44; does not so much give money 
as purchase the things needful&#44; which alone are given to its 
pensioners &#59; and in its managers you have ladies&#44; the wives&#44; 
sisters&#44; daughters&#44; and relatives of your ownselves&#44; and no en&#8211; 
comium&#44; need be passed upon them or their exertions to induce 
you to believe&#44; that whatever is placed under their charge will 
be well bestowed. &#8212; And for what is your bounty asked &#63; &#8212; Is 
it to rear up splendid palaces for the residence of the oppressors 
of the people &#63; is it to send your substance to feed sufferers in 
a distant land &#63; &#8212; No&#44; it is none of these &#59; you are called upon 
to remember the poor within your own gates&#44; to succour the 
distressed that are amongst yourselves&#59; to cheer the heart of 
some lonely widow &#59; to illumine with joy the humble home of 
the fatherless&#59; and to solace the indigent mother amidst her 
toils to provide food and garments for her needy offspring. 
Shall I paint to you the anguish which such a mother must feel&#44; 
when she looks with apprehension dire to the coming days of 
wintry frost&#44; with the certain conviction that her unremitted toil 

    <pb n="574"/>

274 DUTY AND SCOPE OF CHARITY. 

will not give bread even to her heljDless babes &#63; Shall Texhibit 
her to you despairing&#44; when the last handful of fuel is thrown on 
the almost dying embers &#8212; when the last morsel of coarse food is 
devoured &#8212; when the hungry &#8212; half famished &#8212; almost naked in&#8211; 
nocents huddle together on the miserable pallet in a night when 
fearfully rages without the winter&#39;s blast&#44; and drives in the sleet 
and snow through the open crevices of the almost roofless cottage&#63; 
Say&#44; shall I lay open this mother&#39;s heart&#44; as she in despair calls 
on her God to take her&#44; together with her suffering little ones&#44; 
unto his heavenly abode &#63; Is your charity to slumber&#44; till such 
a dreadful picture of suffering humanity is absolutely brought 
under your observation&#63; And yet such objects of distress have 
been &#59; yes&#44; the poor have perished from want of warmth&#44; from 
lack of food&#44; whilst the sons of affluence rolled over the frozen 
ground ensconced within their chariot of ease&#44; enrobed with 
the skin of the costly sable&#59; when their table was covered with 
untasted luxuries &#59; yes&#44; when the winter&#39;s chill was absolutely 
banished from their carpeted halls &#59; when the useless fires 
blazed within every corner of their splendid chambers &#59; when 
the wine cup passed round the social circle &#59; when the merry 
song was heard&#44; and blithesome music ravished the soul. But 
will you&#44; beloved friends&#44; be the luxurious rich&#44; the heartless 
worldlings&#44; living at ease&#44; rioting in pleasure&#44; tasting of dainties&#44; 
whilst near you a brother suffers&#44; whilst in your city a fellow&#8211; 
mortal groans under poverty&#39;s weight &#63; No&#44; this may never be&#59; 
no&#44; the descendants of Israel will not suffer this reproach to rest 
on themselves &#33; for at all times&#44; ennobling charity has charac&#8211; 
terised our people&#44; and liberality of heart and kindliness of feel&#8211; 
ing have ever remained a peculiar feature in our disposition &#59; 
yea&#44; amidst the persecution of tyrants&#44; amidst the stunning scorn 
of our oppressors. And what does the law&#44; which we all 
revere&#44; say on the subject of charity &#63; It commands us to open 
our hearts to the calls of the sufferers&#44; and to give according to 
the blessing of the Lord which has been vouchsafed to us. We 
are commanded&#44; to leave a corner of the field for the stranger&#44; 
the widow&#44; and the orphan &#59; the sheaf forgotten in the field 
must go to the same destination : the fruit&#8211;tree when once 
plucked&#44; the gleanings must be for the poor &#59; but as now the 
Israelites no longer are an agricultural people&#44; and as we no 

    <pb n="575"/>

DUTY AND SCOPE OF CHARITY. 275 

longer live in one community secure and isolated &#59; it is still 
our duty to observe the spirit of these precepts. Let the rich 
therefore give a corner of his amassed wealth into the poor 
man&#39;s treasure &#59; let the husbandman and merchant&#44; when set&#8211; 
tling their yearly accounts&#44; drop their superfluous gains into the 
grainery of the Lord&#44; and thus swell their amount of virtues by 
the small largess which they let fall to the share of their sufler&#8211; 
ing brethren. &#8212; Yet charity&#44; to be an acceptable offering to the 
Deity&#44; should not be a mere unwilling gift&#44; but it should flow 
spontaneously from the heart of the giver &#59; as we read in 
Deut. chapter xv. beginning at verse 7 : &#34;If there should be a 
needy one among thee&#44; one from thy brethren&#44; in one of thy 
gates&#44; which the Lord thy God gives thee : thou shalt not harden 
thy heart&#44; and shalt not close thy hand against thy brother the 
needy. For thou shalt open thy hand to him&#44; and lend unto 
him according to the want he may want. Take heed unto thy&#8211; 
self&#44; lest there be any thing godless in thy heart&#44; saying&#44; The 
seventh year&#44; the year of remission&#44; is nigh &#59; and thy eye would 
thus be bad against thy brother the needy&#44; and thou wouldst 
not give to him &#59; and if he should call concerning thee unto the 
Lord&#44; it would be a sin in thee. Thou must give unto him&#44; 
and thy heart must not grieve&#44; when thou givest to him&#59; for on 
account of this thing the Lord thy God will bless thee in all 
thy works&#44; and in all the doings of thy hands. For the needy 
will not cease from the midst of the land : I therefore com&#8211; 
mand thee&#44; saying&#44; thou shalt open thy hand to thy brother&#44; 
to thy poor&#44; to thy needy one&#44; in thy land.&#34; From this 
eloquent passage it appears&#44; that unwilling charity is not 
what the Lord desires &#59; but we are exhorted to let our libe&#8211; 
rality be accompanied by a willingness of heart&#44; knowing as 
we must do&#44; that by whatever we bestow we make a loan&#44; as it 
were&#44; to our heavenly Father&#44; who will increase our store as a 
recompense for our hastening to the relief of his children&#44; 
the poor&#44; our brethren&#44; that are amongst us. In furtherance 
of this divine behest it has been our custom from time imme&#8211; 
morial to form&#39; ourselves into societies&#44; and to raise &#44; so to 
say&#44; treasures in the name of the Lord&#44; for the relief of 
the needy. Some of these have for their object the relief 
of the sick and the burial of the dead &#59; may these be spread 

    <pb n="576"/>

into every congregation of Israelites&#44; and tlieir means be 
blest. Others are to give relief to the portionless traveller&#44; 
and to bestow largesses unto those that are needy &#59; may the 
Lord bless these also&#44; and cause them to prosper and multiply 
in the land. Others are to dispense the blessings of education 
to the children of the necessitous&#44; and to teach them how to 
serve their Creator and God&#44; and to walk in his ordinances &#59; 
may these too be blessed&#44; and may hopeful fruits answer the 
expectation of their benevolent founders. Others again there 
are&#44; whose object is to apportion dowerless maidens&#44; and 
to cause the helpless orphan to dwell in the house of her hus&#8211; 
band in humble content&#59; may our Father look upon these with 
favour&#44; and cause many happy matrons to call for blessings upon 
the friends of their helpless youth&#33; Others at last there are&#44; 
that&#44; like our Female Benevolent Society&#44; enter the abode of 
wretchedness&#44; to look carefully into the wants of suffering 
sisters and brothers of Israel&#44; and to cause every visit to be an 
earnest of relief and assistance &#59; to cheer the soul of the afflict&#8211; 
ed&#44; and to rescue ignorance from the way of destruction. 
Surely such institutions deserve the benison of Heaven &#59; and 
those&#44; whom He above blesses&#44; merit the favour of man &#33; Shall&#44; 
then&#44; our sisters appeal in vain to you&#44; my beloved hearers &#63; 
Shall your own mothers&#44; wives&#44; sisters&#44; relatives and friends&#44; 
be compelled to tell the suffering poor&#44; that their treasury is 
empty and their funds exhausted&#63; May this disgrace never 
attach to our name &#59; on the contrary&#44; sons of Israel&#44; you whom 
the Lord has blest&#44; open your hearts to the appeal of the dis&#8211; 
tressed&#44; before it is uttered loudly in your ears &#59; fill to overflow&#8211; 
ing the store of the benevolent&#44; and enable them&#44; to go on 
prosperously in their goodly task&#44; and to relieve and to succour 
all on whom the heavy hand of misfortune may fall. &#8212; And you&#44; 
daughters of Yeshurun&#44; who have so nobly embarked in the 
cause&#44; go on and prosper&#44; for the Lord your God is with you &#59; 
go on&#44; scatter consolation into the hearts of the afflicted&#44; and 
light up with joy the countenance of the mourners&#59; go on&#44; 
restore warmth and the genial flame to the deserted hearth&#44; and 
replenish the larder that is exhausted &#59; go on&#44; rescue from sin 
those whom dire poverty tempts to transgress &#59; and forget 
not the task&#44; most delightful of all&#44; to instruct the young mind&#44;

to awaken the tender soul to a knowledge of the Creator&#44; and 
assist the distressed mother to enable her to rear up the chil&#8211; 
dren that the Lord has given her&#44; a joy to herself&#44; an honour 
to you&#44; and servants to their Maker. If all thus combine&#44; if 
our brothers and sisters go hand in hand doing and bestowing 
good : how joyfully must life then pass away&#44; and how sweetly 
will then rise to Heaven the incense of thankful hearts&#44; recalled 
from despair&#44; and taught in their hour of distress&#44; that even to 
this day our ancient race are true to their pristine virtue &#59; and 
that they are still worthy of being called the children of the 
Lord.

PRAYER. 

Lord God of fathers&#44; we call upon Thee&#44; to bestow on us 
the watchfulness of thy providence&#59; for we well know&#44; and we 
have been taught that before Thee all is naught&#44; and that from 
thy omnipotence there is no fleeing. &#8212; In old times it was that 
Thou decreedst punishment against thy chosen people Israel&#44; 
because they had sinned and transgressed thy righteous com&#8211; 
mandments&#59; and they who thought themselves secure behind 
their impregnable walls&#44; within their fortresses of strength&#44; 
were led away captive before their foe &#33; &#8212; And their oppressors 
too have felt the weight of thy power&#59; and Babylon&#44; and Persia&#44; 
and Greece&#44; and Rome&#44; they who mocked the sorrows of the 
children of thy inheritance&#44; have been overthrown&#44; when their 
day of sorrow came&#44; and all have proved in their turns&#44; that 
before Thee no mortal power can stand&#44; and that thy will builds 
up nations&#44; and that&#44; in thy justice&#44; kingdoms perish and are as 
though they had not been &#33;

ON THE OBJECTS OF CHARITY. 279 

But in our own day&#44; too&#44; we have witnessed the manifesta&#8211; 
tions of thy might. For Thou spokest&#44; and the destroyer 
hastened onward on his message of death&#44; and thousands fell 
beneath the sword that was drawn over many a devoted land. 
Aye&#44; and vain were the efforts of impotent men &#59; and on the 
high mountains&#59; in the barren deserts&#59; by the verdant rivers: 
on the pathless ocean &#59; in the sunny South&#44; and in the cold of 
the North&#44; were the slain of thy awful visitation &#59; and we were 
emphatically taught&#44; that thy goodness alone saved us&#44; that thy

despair the contest against the minister of thy vengeance upon 
the sinful sons of the earth &#33; 

The warning passed on&#44; and the danger was over&#44; and we 
soon forgot Thee&#44; who hadst saved us. But again Thou calledst 
on the curse of war&#44; and lands that weened they were secured 
in peace and prosperity&#44; heard the din of arms and prepara&#8211; 
tion for battle resound in their boundaries&#44; and blood has flowed 
in streams &#59; because men thought not of Thee&#44; and trusted in 
their own wisdom and power. &#8212; Anon&#44; Thou beheldest how 
vain men trusted too much in their riches&#59; they imagined that 
they need not serve Thee&#44; because their wealth was extensive 
and their possessions widely spread &#59; but Thou commandedst&#44; 
and the flames&#42; went forth&#44; and houses that seemed to bid de&#8211; 
fiance to time&#44; crumbled into ashes in one single hour&#59; human 
efforts stood aghast&#44; mortal striving was vain against thy power&#44; 
and thy fire went on spreading and desolating&#44; till the proud were 
made to feel thy greatness&#44; and till the heart of the arrogant 
was made humble before Thee. For they who in their man&#8211; 
sions gay listened in the evening&#8211;hour to the sound of the 
merry viol&#59; the light&#8211;hearted who in mirth expected a joyful 
morrow &#59; the lordly bridegroom&#44; at whose side smiled the lovely 
bride: saw not the sun rise over their splendour&#44; because one 
night of desolation had robbed them of all the wealth on which 
they had built their hopes. &#8212; Yet we heeded not&#44; and we wended 
our way&#44; regardless of thy covenant&#44; heedless of the coming

had always nourished&#44; have failed to give their return to the 
expectant husbandman&#44; and the measure of bread has been 
lessened by the unfruitfulness of the seasons. &#8212; Thus we have 
seen thy workings manifested before our eyes&#59; do Thou en&#8211;

who art the Friend of the stranger&#44; the Protector of the widow&#44;

children&#44; who have met in this thy sanctuary&#44; to devise means

who in this manner endeavour to imitate thy deeds of mercy.

their striving&#44; and that they&#44; who are now obdurate of heart 
and forgetful of thy power&#44; may be led through these to fall 
down and worship at the foot of thy throne &#33; &#8212; And let thy 
name be sanctified through our humble works&#44; and may our 
acts of piety&#44; feeble and few though they be&#44; redound to diffuse 
the knowledge of thy glory and be the cause of manifold bless&#8211; 
ing to us&#44; and all thy people Israel. &#8212; And we further petition 
Thee&#44; Sovereign Lord of the universe&#44; that as through thy 
kindness this devastated city has been rebuilt with more than 
its former strength and beauty. Thou mayest also speedily 
cause the cities of our own heritage to rise from their ashes&#44;

our Father &#33; and let our ears be gladdened and our hearts be 
rejoiced by the announcement of the joyful tidings&#44; that to

ADDRESS. 
on the objects of charity. 

Brethren &#33; 

It was in ancient days&#44; when the worshippers of the true 
God were few&#44; aud the mass of mankind sunk in superstition 
and ignorance&#44; that the Lord of the universe descended in his 
majesty to give unto his chosen people laws and statutes for 
their guidance. Centuries have elapsed since that glorious 
day &#59; empires have risen &#8212; and empires have fallen &#59; &#8212; nations 
were born &#8212; and nations perished &#59; and &#8211; still the legacy of 
Heaven is the guide&#8211;star of Jacob&#39;s children&#44; still the revelation 
from Sinai is the law which the Israelites obey &#33; Aye &#8212; this 
has been the instrument in the hands of our Father above of 
preserving us amidst all the sufferings and chastisements we 
had to encounter&#44; because of our manifold transgressions &#59; and 
we have been spared&#44; miraculously upheld&#44; amidst the wreck 
of kingdoms&#44; and the annihilation of entire nations&#44; by this 
best gift which the Creator could confer upon the works of his 
hands. And although we have been often rebellious and dis&#8211; 
obedient to the divine mandates : still there never yet was a 
time&#44; when the blessed law did not strike a chord of harmony 
in our hearts &#59; for despite of sin we have remained a faithful 
people&#44; since the divine revelation has at all times found its 
defenders among the descendants of the patriarchs&#44; the friends 
and adorers of the God of heaven and earth &#33; 

One of the characteristics of our nation&#44; and one which is so 
strictly enforced in the reords of revelation&#44; has always been our 
kindness to them as need our assistance &#59; and the assembly this 
day in the house of God proves&#44; that the ancient spirit of bene&#8211; 
volence is not extinct among my hearers. For what brings you 
here&#63; is it to listen to sounds of enchanting music&#63; is it to 
partake of the viands at some festive board &#63; or is it perhaps to

celebrate the achievement of some mighty conqueror &#63; or to do 
homage at the throne of earthly power &#63; No&#44; my friends &#33; you 
came hither to be excited to feelings of kindness and devotion &#59; 
you bent your steps to this holy edifice&#44; consecrated to our 
almighty Father&#44; to raise your eyes&#44; to elevate your thoughts&#44; 
to yield your hearts in adoration of Him&#44; and you are here as&#8211; 
sembled to be prepared to give of the treasures with which you 
are blest to the poor within your gates&#44; and to assist with your 
substance and with your counsel the unprotected orphan&#44; 
whose parents were removed before the charges entrusted to 
their keeping had reached that age&#44; when they need no longer 
the watchful eye of the father&#44; and the tender care and pro&#8211; 
tecting mercy of the mother &#33; And well it is that there 
are those who feel for another&#39;s wo I for turn we where we 
will&#44; we must discover many on whom have fallen the laurthens 
of afflicting poverty&#44; and who suffer ills from which no human 
exertions are able to extricate them. When the benevolent 
then looks into their wants&#44; and remembers that the sufferers 
are men like himself&#44; and that our God demands that he should 
succour the needy : the glow of kindliness at once warms his 
heart&#44; and with the hungry the loaf is divided&#44; and the naked 
go not away unclothed. And although by such deeds of 
charity the needy are certainly benefitted : it may nevertheless 
be maintained that the giver is also blest. For who would be 
heardhearted enough&#44; unl&#8211;ess he loved gold more than any thing 
else on earth&#44; and lived only for himself&#44; to enjoy the comforts 
which his means will afford him&#44; if a trifle freely bestowed 
would tend to alleviate the sufferings of his neighbour &#63; who but 
the arrogant would be willing to luxuriate alone in the pleasures 
of science and refined life&#44; if made conscious&#44; that by his ex&#8211; 
ertions many a poor might be snatched from ignorance and 
vice&#44; to become&#44; like himself&#44; an ornament of human nature &#63; 
Yes&#44; brethren&#44; much as we may excuse ourselves for neglect of 
charity&#44; by averring that we are unable to relieve all the suf&#8211; 
fering&#44; and to remove all the evil that come under our notice : 
it may freely be maintained&#44; that&#44; if concerted efforts were 
made&#44; if one would take counsel with the other&#44; and proceed 
hand&#8211;in&#8211;hand to further the goodly cause&#44; sufferings would be

relieved that are now galling and almost force the humble to 
despair&#44; and evils would be remedied that now threaten at 
times the subversion of social organization and order. 

It was for the furtherance of these objects that the members 
of the society&#44; who celebrate their anniversary this day&#44; formed 
the bond of union&#44; to relieve the distresses of the stranger&#44; of 
the unprovided poor&#44; of the unprotected widow and orphan&#44; and 
of those who may be overtaken by the rigours of winter with&#8211; 
out adequate comforts to combat with the severity of the season. 
In the countries beyond yon great water&#44; that washes the con&#8211; 
fines of this extensive city&#44; many of our brethren find them&#8211; 
selves unable to procure the necessaries of life by their labour. 
Or&#44; again&#44; oppressed by tyrannical rulers&#44; because of their 
descent from the great names of former ages&#44; suffering under 
the opprobrium of being members of the Jewish nation&#44; they 
find a longer residence in their native land next to impossible. 
They hear&#44; that in this favoured clime industry is rewarded by 
a full return&#59; they are told&#44; that in these States&#44; which are free&#44; 
and long may tlieir freedom continue&#44; the sons of Israel are 
permitted to assemble and call upon their Father in heaven 
after their ancient manner without let or hinderance. They 
make therefore every exertion to reach these shores. Behold 
them descending from the baik that carried them hither&#59; their 
means are exhausted by reason of long travel &#59; they are igno&#8211; 
rant of the manners and the language of the new home they 
have been seeking &#59; to whom shall they apply &#63; to individuals 
the burden would become too heavy &#59; and even if some one 
blest with extraordinary riches and possessed of unbounded be&#8211; 
nevolence could be found&#44; still his own occupations&#44; which every 
one must have&#44; would prevent him from giving due attention 
to the cases of the distressed strangers. But if there exists an 
institution like our society&#44; they may apply to the persons 
selected to bestow the charity with a well&#8211;founded hope&#44; that 
every thing will be done to relieve their wants and to aid 
them with wholesome advice&#44; and to point out the way by 
which not alone present distress may be relieved&#44; but which 
will enable them to obtain an honest livelihood for themselves 
by their own exertions&#44; and be thus enabled to dispense the 
bounties of benevolence to those who may come after them.

And when they find themselves blessed with ease and compe&#8211; 
tence&#44; they will thank our God&#44; that He had caused to prosper 
an association whose aim it is to do good without hope of 
reward. 

Many a one has been in affluence in days gone by &#59; he had 
hoped&#44; that his latter days would be free from want and care. 
But who is able to rely with confidence upon the stability of 
aught in this evanescent world&#63; His fortune was dissipated 
little by little&#44; from the effects&#44; perhaps&#44; of too much confidence 
placed in the undeserving&#59; or from the suddenness of political 
changes which caused his well&#8211;laid plans to fail &#59; or from the 
weight of diseases with which he or his family may have been 
afflicted. Could he&#44; who had seen better days&#44; resort to begging&#44; 
perchance to be refused and spurned by those through whose 
villany he was reduced to his present distressed situation &#63; 
No&#44; not whilst a society exists&#44; who in relieving feel no interest 
in making the applicant ashamed&#59; who in bestowing need not&#44; 
will not&#44; publicly proclaim that a fellow&#8211;being has been reduced 
to poverty&#59; who in succouring distress will screen the wounded 
and tender feelings which the needy often experience. And 
when in his old days comfort dwells in his house&#44; he will ask 
the peace of Heaven upon the benevolent that cheered his de&#8211; 
clining years. 

In the day of youthful vigour man treads lightly the path of 
life. Fortune seems to smile on his enterprize&#44; and he dreads 
not the coming day of evil. He enjoys life&#44; because of the 
buoyancy of his heart&#44; and he dreams not that it is incumbent 
on him to husband his resources and to lay up provision for 
his family&#44; because of the coming day of death. But alas &#33; the 
enemy may be lurking near&#44; although unperceived &#33; and sud&#8211; 
denly the youthful aspirant is taken from the midst of his pur&#8211; 
suits&#44; and he is borne to the silent&#44; dark&#44; and narrow grave. 
When living&#44; the world thought him prosperous &#59; but the gay 
outside deceived them &#59; and when the lonely widow looks into 
the deranged affairs of her departed husband&#44; she discovers that 
beggary and want are before her. From a heartless&#44; selfish world&#44; 
that only laugh with the prosperous&#44; but frown upon the un&#8211; 
happy&#44; she may not&#44; cannot&#44; look for support in her straits &#59; 
but when the helping hand of a society like ours is near&#44; she 

    <pb n="585"/>

ON THE OBJECTS OF CHARITY. 285 

has friends who will console and assist her &#59; and when her 
heart has ceased to mourn&#44; she will lift up her soul to God&#44; 
and thank Him that he raised up to her friends in the hour of 
trouble&#44; of need&#44; and affliction. 

But above all do they deserve protection&#44; whose natural 
guardians have been early removed&#44; who are left&#44; as it were&#44; 
desolate and lonely on the ocean of life&#44; with no guide&#8211;star to 
point out the way&#44; with no watchful steersman to guard against 
the shoals&#44; the rocks&#44; the waves of existence. How many are 
there thus forsaken 1 and how many who are lost because of the 
want of some kind friend to protect and shield at the very time 
of life&#44; when care and watchfulness are doubly required. It 
may well comport with the views of the proud and selfish to 
leave those to go to destruction&#44; who have no wealth to bestow&#44; 
no favours to grant. But how would they feel&#44; were they to 
be made conscious that they should die in want&#44; their wives be 
left helpless widows&#44; and their children unprotected orphans &#63; 
And is this end so very improbable to those even who deem 
themselves firmly seated&#63; ask the annals of poverty&#44; what are 
the sons of the great and wealthy &#63; and you will be told&#44; that 
they are among the miserably poor &#59; and descendants of kings 
are houseless wanderers&#44; strangers and exiles from the countries 
which their fathers governed &#33; It may indeed be said&#44; that&#44; 
the higher the prosperity&#44; the nearer man is to his fall. And 
such a fall &#33; from a proud eminence to the lowest degradation &#33; 
from the royal banquet to the scafiold&#44; from the palace to the 
prison &#33; Should the rich man then not remember in his pro&#8211; 
sperity the fatherless and the widow&#44; in order that when his 
own children and the wife of his own bosom may call&#44; they 
too shall find fathers and protectors in benevolent friends&#44; &#8212; 
friends&#44; raised to eminence and distinction peradventure by the 
fruits of the very charity bestowed by him from his useless 
superfluities in the days of his ease and prosperity&#63; And ask&#44; who 
sitamong the great of the land&#63; whose advice is listened to among 
the counsellors and governors &#63; who are they that scatter 
blessings wherever they go &#63; and you will be told&#44; they are the 
sons of the lonely widow&#44; the children of humble parents&#44; the 
orphan who neither had a father&#39;s care nor a mother&#39;s love&#44; 
raised by a life of integrity&#44; of virtue&#44; and of kindness&#44; to the 

    <pb n="586"/>

proud eminence which they now enjoy. And is it not something 
animating to the charitably disposed to believe that&#44; by his exer&#8211; 
tions&#44; some one may perhaps be raised from an humble condition&#44; 
perhaps from vice and its concomitant degradation&#44; to a sphere 
of usefulness and happiness&#63; But there are those so acting&#59; 
there always have been friends of their species&#44; who disdained 
not to spend their time and their means&#44; however small&#44; to 
effect so noble a work. There once lived&#44; in a distant land&#44; a 
man who walked humbly before his Maker. Industrious he 
was&#44; but fortune smiled not upon his exertions. It pleased 
Him&#44; who thrones in heaven&#44; to afflict him with sufferings long 
and severe&#44; almost beyond endurance&#59; yet he repined not&#44; but 
yielded a cheerful submission to the just decrees of his God. 
Anon&#44; the wife of his heart&#44; was taken away to the realms of 
bliss&#44; where her virtues will shine for ever&#44; amid the servants 
and adorers of the Lord&#59; and he was left to struggle on a few 
brief years longer&#44; to provide by the sweat of his brow for the 
wants of his offspring. But his end also soon approached&#44; 
before they for whom he toiled were old enough to battle with 
the world and its dangers. Yet the children of the righteous 
were not forsaken&#59; and after the father had resigned his spirit 
in tranquillity&#44; and joy at a release from his long&#8211;endured pain 
and hardship&#44; they each found friends to be to them in a father&#39;s 
place&#44; although his love and tender care could never be com&#8211; 
pensated by acts of the kindest relatives and indulgent friends. 
And one there was who&#44; feeble of strength&#44; and often and early 
subject to bodily disease&#44; was unable to labour for the support 
of his weak frame. Was he now left to struggle in hopeless 
and sickening toil for a scanty and tearful support&#63; No&#59; for 
there was a man&#44; beloved of God and honoured of all that 
knew him&#44; who&#44; though blest with but small means&#44; had yet 
always a mite for those that were needy. He felt for the or&#8211; 
phan&#8211;boy&#44; took him as his own child&#44; watched over his youth 
with paternal care&#44; instructed him in the way of righteousness&#44; 
and taught him to fear the Creator&#44; and to look to Him for 
support in all his afflictions. And when the youth needed far&#8211; 
ther assistance&#44; more than the beloved teacher himself could 
give&#59; when the light of more extended knowledge was required 
for his mind: he induced other sons of Israel to lend their aid 

    <pb n="587"/>

ON THE OBJECTS OF CHARITY. 287 

to finish the good&#33;&#39;&#39; work which he had begun. Years passed 
away&#44; and the orphan sought a home in a distant land&#44; where 
the relatives of his mother offered him the welcome of a father&#39;s 
house&#59; there his efforts have been blest&#44; and those are now his 
friends&#44; that&#44; but for the assistance of the blessed teacher in 
Israel&#44; would never have known his name. The benevolent one 
has gone to his reward before the Father whom he so faithfully 
served&#44; whose laws he so faithfully taught&#59; and the orphan&#44; who 
wept over his father&#39;s bier as one almost forsaken&#44; now ad&#8211; 
dresses you&#44; and pleads for the stranger&#44; the widow&#44; and the 
fatherless&#33; 

Although it must be admitted that the task of protecting the 
children of persons not connected with ourselves&#44; must be&#44; in 
a measure&#44; highly laborious and unpleasant&#44; especially if&#44; by 
previous neglect&#44; their manners should have become corrupted&#44; 
and their minds vitiated: still we ought not to forget&#44; that the 
children are not to be blamed for the negligence of their pro&#8211; 
genitors&#44; and that&#44; if they are vicious and stubborn&#44; proper 
means should be employed to cure them of these obstacles to 
moral improvement. Of all means which are likely to effect 
this end&#44; none seems to me more promising than an extended 
system of useful scientificand religious education&#44; of which all the 
children of persons of our persuasion should be permitted to par&#8211; 
take&#59; not so much a free&#8211;school&#44; but one open to all&#59; to thewealthy 
for a moderate contribution&#44; and to the poor for whatever they 
can give&#44; or without any price whatever&#44; if their means will 
not permit them to pay. It must be apparent to the most casual 
observer&#44; that many of the evils to which society is exposed&#44; pro&#8211; 
ceed from two greatcauses&#59; first.thewant of information&#59; second&#8211; 
ly&#44; the want oi correct instruction. Absolute ignorance will be 
conceded on all sides to be very&#34; pernicious&#44; as such a deficiency 
will leave the mind open to be influenced by all impulses which 
the world may instil&#44; and to be ruled by passions and desires to 
which the best of men are subject&#44; but which they keep down by 
moral government. But if we come to examine the bad conse&#8211; 
quences arising from a want of correct instruction&#44; we will soon 
find that they are fully as pernicious as the effects of ignorance. 
Take for instance a young man conversant with all the learning 
of the schools&#59; imagine him to be accomplished in the arts of

riding&#44; dancing&#44; music&#44; and painting &#59; add to these as many 
other things as you please&#44; but leave out a careful religious 
training&#44; which is most likely the only subject either slightly 
touched upon or altogether pretermitted : what&#44; I would ask 
can you expect from the heartless&#44; finished gentleman&#44; as 
he is termed &#63; Does he bear love for God &#63; &#8212; by no means&#44; this 
was not included in his course of discipline &#59; does he look upon 
his acquirements with meekness&#63; is he humble &#63; is he modest&#63; 
not at all &#59; for he was praised for his knowledge in his own 
presence&#44; and he has not yet learned that others can be as wise 
as himself &#59; &#8212; does he love his fellow&#8211;men &#63; no&#44; not he&#44; for they 
are all his rivals&#44; they stand in the way of his preferment&#44; or 
else&#44; they are too low&#44; too mean&#44; too much beneath his notice. 
And what are the effects of such an education &#63; &#8212; ask the 
beguiled maiden&#44; whose sinful course has driven her from a 
father&#39;s home &#33; ask the deceived associate&#44; who confided too 
firmly upon the word of his supposed friend &#59; ask the heart&#8211; 
broken mother&#44; when she laments too late that she did not teach 
her son to adore and fear his Maker and to walk in his statutes&#44; 
as his fathers had done before him &#33; It is needless to expatiate 
at greater length upon a proposition so evident. And as Isra&#8211; 
elites cannot gain a knowledge of their religion from strangers : 
it is evidently a duty incumbent on them to provide teachers 
of their own&#44; who&#44; besides being capable of imparting useful 
knowledge and elegant accomplishments&#44; should also be quali&#8211; 
fied&#44; both by character and information&#44; to teach the holy reli&#8211; 
gion we profess. There are abundant materials in this city&#44; 
the chief residence of our brethren in America&#44; for the forma&#8211; 
tion of an institution on Jewish principles &#59; and doubtlessly&#44; if 
sufficient encouragement were held out&#44; men of distinguished 
talents would soon be found&#44; who would gladly assume the 
hopeful task of rearing up our youths and our maidens in the 
knowledge and the service of their Creator and God. And if&#44; 
in addition to this&#44; associations should be founded&#44; whose aim 
it would be to procure employment for our young men without 
a profanation of the Sabbath &#59; who would endeavour to elevate 
the character of our people by making of our poor something 
more useful than itinerant traders : a blessed spectacle would 
speedily be exhibited&#44; of our community regenerated from

many faults laid to their charge &#59; for our houses of worship 
would be filled with devout&#44; attentive adorers &#59; the Sabbath of 
the Lord would become a delight to many&#44; now strangers to its 
blessings &#59; the family circles on the festivals would be again 
completed &#59; and in short we should be distinguished for some&#8211; 
thing more than merely a successful pursuit of wealth : and no 
more would attach to our name the reproach of a people bent 
on the acquisition of earthly goods and forgetful of their perma&#8211; 
nent happiness. &#8212; And never tell me&#44; that it is impossible to 
earn a livelihood without transgressing the divine mandates &#33; 
for how is it that our forefathers lived at ease and respected&#44; in 
countries where they were subject to oppression and maltreat&#8211; 
ment &#33; How is it that so many even here find time to serve 
their heavenly Father&#44; and yet are blest with all that their 
hearts can desire &#63; It may be that there are great difficulties in 
the way of a strict religious course in large commercial cities&#44; 
where the competition in every employment is so very great&#59; but 
still it seems to be utterly impossible to justify the so general 
forgetfulness of religious duties on these grounds&#44; especially as 
honest candour would seem to warrant the assertion that con&#8211; 
certed exertion would do a great deal towards combating&#44; if not 
entirely removing&#44; the evil. 

Both the objects just mentioned&#44; the diffusion of religious 
knowledge&#44; and the promotion of a stricter conformity to re&#8211; 
ligious observances&#44; seem to be properly within the province of 
our society. For their laws say : 

&#34;The funds of this society shall be applied to the following 
purposes : &#8212; 

1st. Relief to the orphans and widows of deceased members. 

2d. Elementary and Religious Education&#44; and Trades&#44; to 
such Orphans&#44; and to the Children of Indigent Jews&#44; 
giving a preference to those of indigent or deceased mem&#8211; 
bers. And in all cases&#44; where evidence of superior talent 
in any child shall manifest itself&#44; to extend&#44; if practicable&#44; 
a liberal education. 

3d. Aid to all Jews in distress under such regulations as 
may hereafter be prescribed.&#34; 

It will be seen from the foregoing&#44; that the founders of the

society contemplated such an institution as I have been urging 
upon your attention &#59; for it is not to be supposed&#44; that Religious 
Education could be obtained at any other than our own schools&#44; 
nor is it credible&#44; that after a child should have been religiously 
educated&#44; he should be bound out to a stranger and compelled 
to eat of food prohibited by the law&#44; and to labour on the days 
which&#44; as he was taught&#44; are consecrated to the service of 
Heaven. &#8212; This surely could never have been the intention of 
the benevolent&#44; who associated themselves to diffuse the blessings 
of charity. Let them therefore rouse themselves to establish 
the good work which they have contemplated &#59; let them draw 
the children of the rich&#44; of the moderate in circumstances&#44; and 
of the poor&#44; into one common school&#44; where all may uniformly 
be taught the religion of our Father in heaven&#59; and if it should 
then unfortunately happen&#44; that indigence or early bereavement 
throw any child upon the bounty of the world&#44; the managers 
will not have to contend against ignorance&#44; and against vice&#44; 
brought on by the not knowing the way of life and salvation &#33; 
It is to be hoped&#44; that should such a seminary be commenced&#44; 
none but worthy men should be appointed as instructors&#59; 
and that&#44; on the other hand&#44; the wealthy would not disdain to 
let their children mix in fellowship and brotherly love with 
the offspring of the humble &#59; for who knows&#44; but that the de&#8211; 
scendants of the affluent may in after&#8211;life be indebted for aid to 
those who were inferiors to them in youth &#59; besides it would 
teach them to place a proper value upon the fleeting possessions 
of our earthly existence&#44; when they discover that the poor too 
have feelings like them.selves&#44; and are endowed by the Creator 
with the same intellect&#44; and are from their worth deserving of 
respect and kindness. And if teachers should come among 
you&#44; then treat them with proper regard&#44; you who are 
fathers and mothers in Israel &#59; endeavour to second their ex&#8211; 
ertions to benefit your children&#44; and let these hear nothing from 
you which could in the least tend to induce them to esteem 
lightly their spiritual parents &#33; Can any one doubt that happy 
fruits would be the result of such a pious course. And what 
can be the end&#44; if something is not done&#44; and speedily done&#44; to 
arrest the growing evil&#44; and to check the forgetfulness of the

divine mandates&#44; which has spread its poison so fatally for many 
years over the younger part of the Jews &#63; 

Doubtlessly the society&#44; who wish to take charge of the poor&#44; 
the orphan&#44; and the widow&#44; have not means enough to accom&#8211; 
plish all their benevolent plans &#59; but year after year their funds 
are accumulating&#44; and when their wealth has greatly increased&#44; 
they then will be able to do whatever the founders at first pur&#8211; 
posed. But shall the rising generation in the mean time lan&#8211; 
guish and thirst for the word of God&#44; and find no one to satisfy 
their desire&#63; Shall the poor apply in vain to an exhausted 
treasure&#44; when sickness oppresses his humble home&#44; when 
penury checks his hopeless labour&#63; Shall the orphan be cast 
abroad&#44; with none to feel compassion for his helpless state &#63; 
Shall the widow&#44; she&#44; perhaps&#44; who in better days bestowed her 
bread to the hungry and clothed the naked &#8212; shall she in her 
old days be allowed to suffer&#44; because there is no one to plead 
for her&#44; when distress overtakes her &#63; &#8212; Never be this said of 
men&#44; of Israelites &#33; There are here now present those who 
are greatly blessed&#44; with means beyond their wants &#59; let them 
open their hearts&#44; and give freely unto the treasure&#44; whence&#8211; 
the sufferings of many may be relieved&#44; through which many 
may be rescued from ignorance&#44; from ignominy&#44; and ii&#39;religion &#33; 
They&#44; whose substance is not so extensive&#44; let them also give 
according to their abilities&#44; and let them be assured&#44; that no 
loss will accrue from the bounty bestowed&#44; to benefit the people 
of the Lord&#44; the poor&#44; the needy&#44; and the afflicted. &#8212; And&#44; 
lastly&#44; the poor also&#44; let them give their trifle&#44; and let them be 
convinced&#44; that though the gift be small&#44; the ever&#8211;kind Father 
will yet look upon the heart&#44; and bless the sincere offering that 
is made in his service. If all thus contribute&#44; and if all will 
lend their aid and counsel to further the goodly work &#8212; blessing 
and prosperity will attend the efforts of our society&#44; and they 
who are now but few in number &#40;which it is hoped may this 
day be increased manifold) will be the supports of the poor&#44; 
the props of the widow&#44; and the fathers of the fatherless. And 
will not our God bless his servants that thus endeavour to 
glorify his holy NAME &#63; Assuredly&#44; for these are the words 
of the inspired one&#44; who says : 

    <pb n="592"/>

&#34; Bring&#8211; ye all the tenth part into the treasury&#8211;house&#44; that it may serve as 
a provision in my house &#59; and prove me&#44; I pray you&#44; in this&#44; says the Lord 
of hosts&#44; if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and shower you 
down blessing&#8211; without measure.&#34; Malachi iii. 10. 

Here&#44; friends and brethren&#44; you have the distinct announce&#8211; 
ment&#44; that benevolence will not be followed by temporary loss&#44; 
besides that it brings imperishable treasures. Do you then&#44; 
prove the Lord in this&#33; open your stores of wealth&#44; fill up his 
treasury to overflowing&#44; and strengthen the handsof the stewards 
in God&#39;s household&#44; that they may be enabled to give provision 
to the poor who live in the world&#44; his land &#59; perhaps the Lord 
may see it and receive your doing in favour&#44; and cause much 
good to result from your effort &#59; and perhaps He may stay&#44; in 
his mercy&#44; the devouring flame&#44; that it consume not again the 
labours of many years&#59; perhaps He may decree blessing on the 
crops that are growing&#44; and send plenty&#44; and health&#44; and con&#8211; 
tentment to the inhabitants of this city and of this country. &#8212; 
Come &#33; rouse yourselves men of Israel &#33; rise in your strength 
sons and daughters of Yeshurun &#33; join in with the band of the 
faithful who have not relinquished the task of ministering to 
the wants of their fellow&#8211;mortals&#33; and let not this day pass 
before you have all resolved to serve the Almighty&#44; the ever&#8211; 
lasting One our God&#44; and to love and to fear Him all the days 
that you may live on this earth &#59; so that you may be favourably 
received in the embrace of the ever&#8211;blessed Father&#44; when your 
race is run&#44; when you will receive the recompense meet for 
those who remained true and firm to the commands of the law&#44; 
undismayed by temptation&#44; unswayed by interest&#44; loving and 
adoring the Being who is God alone&#44; and whose rule is from 
everlasting to everlasting. 

May the God of our fathers be with you all&#44; and bless&#44; guard&#44; 
and save you&#44; and give you peace and contentment here below&#44; 
and happiness and satisfaction in yonder mansions of bliss&#44; when

your souls have sped hence&#44; to receive at his judgment&#8211;seat their 
portion with the righteous who have obeyed his will &#59; and may 
you rise again to unending life and imperishable happiness at 
the day&#44; when the slumberers in the dust shall be quickened 
unto life before the Father of all &#33; Amen.
