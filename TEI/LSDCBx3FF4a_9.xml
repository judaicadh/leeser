                was rather<lb/> weak <add>poor</add> from my youth on. Do you know the parable which
                the <persName>Gaon Ezekiel<lb/> Landau</persName>*, may his memory be for a

                    <persName>Frankel</persName>. My brother-<lb/>in-law was not the man for this.

                con-<lb/>tains much that isn't so, realizes the statement “Through the praise<lb/>

                view, especially the one printed here from the manuscript in <lb/>
                <placeName>Vienna</placeName>. It is supposed to contain all the historical
                references. It<lb/> sheds much light upon the charlatan teachings of Christianity
                and<lb/> its lying apostles. That they wrapped themselves in the mantle of<lb/>
                Essenism*, I clearly indicate.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I beg of you to deliver one package with the enclosed letter<lb/> to
                the Chazan <persName>Pappe</persName>. You will please me by sending at once per
                express,<lb/> 4 of your bound prayer books, but at a cheap price. The second part
                is<lb/> now much too expensive. For me you must make it cheaper.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Have you read my article in the “Messenger” about the<lb/>
                “Shochetim” ? It is....somewhat moderate, but in <placeName>New York</placeName>
                everything<lb/> is spoiled. On the one side reform, on the other side those who
                hate<lb/> Jewish knowledge, who play at orthodoxy in order to make a living,
                and<lb/> on the third side, the five Houses of Trampling- I put an <hi
                    rend="underline">s</hi> instead of<lb/> an <hi rend="underline">sh</hi>*. This
                much I accomplished; <persName>Raphall</persName> does not lend his support any<lb/>
                more, and <persName>Rabbi Menachem Goldsmith</persName>, he who forgot to study, not
                that he<lb/> forgot his studies, will no longer examine the shochetim.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I have spoken to the old <persName>Halpern</persName>. My articles
