			<p><addressee>Revd. Isaac Leeser</addressee></p>
          <p rend="indent(1)"><placeName>Philadelphia</placeName></p>
          <p rend="indent(3)">My dear friend.</p>
          <p rend="indent(5)">By last packet I wrote you<lb/> a short letter relative to our new Code of Laws&#44; which were sent<lb/> by <persName>Mr. David</persName> hand to be transmitted to you for printing.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I am truly apprehensive&#44; from the present dreadful<lb/> stagnation of commerce&#44; arising from events in <placeName>Europe</placeName>&#44; and the revolution<lb/> in <placeName>Venezuela</placeName>&#44; which is <add>&#63;</add> our congregation of its members&#44;<lb/> that we shall have a sound and useful Code of Laws when there<lb/> is only the shadow or skeleton of a community. You can have<lb/> no idea of the manner in which emigration from this spot has<lb/> reduced our numbers. Between the time of my first arrival here<lb/> and the present&#44; there is a difference of from 35 to 40 regular<lb/> Sabbath attendants at public worship&#44; grown men. Some are dead&#44;<lb/> others gone away&#44; and others&#44; once in business&#44; now in situations<lb/> which prevent them from visiting the House of God&#44; as formerly.<lb/> It is really sad to contemplate. Add to this&#44; the alteration in<lb/> circumstances&#44; Even of the wealthiest&#44; joined to the dislike of others&#44;<lb/> from captions or other motives&#44; to contribute to the support of the<lb/> synagogue&#44; and you will ascertain by what a slight tenure I<lb/> hold my present appointment&#44; and the small likelihood there is<lb/> of obtaining&#44; in a short time&#44; half the remuneration I now receive.</p>
		<pb n="2"/>
			<p>I should be really at a loss how to give my family bread&#44; were<lb/> it not for the school&#59; which the goodness of God has prospered to be<lb/> a provisional in these difficult times. I have so often written you<lb/> on this subject&#44; that you must be nauseated with it&#59; I will therefore<lb/> merely say further that religious prospects here&#44; or rather the<lb/> upholding of a place of worship in its integrity are full of gloom<lb/> anxiety&#44; and doubt.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)"><placeName>New Orleans</placeName> comes opportunely and makes me<lb/> offers&#44; not in an official shape&#44; but thro&#39; <persName>Mr. G. Kursheedt</persName>&#44; who<lb/> nevertheless appears to be the chosen medium of ascertaining my<lb/> sentiments. He speaks of &#36;2000 p annum and the handsome<lb/> emoluments <del>likely</del> sure to result from a school. His letters thro&#39; some<lb/> neglect&#44; miscarried. All was report until the present month.<lb/> As I know nothing of the congregation&#44; I have written him for<lb/> further particulars&#44; of which I will keep you informed. There are<lb/> two things which oppose themselves&#44; at this moment to my going.<lb/> One&#44; the climate&#59; the other&#44; that independence and freedom of<lb/> action which here&#44; as a minister I enjoy in their fullest extent.<lb/> In the internal management of the synagogue here I have no superior<lb/> to dictate to me in the capricious and often tyrannical tone of<lb/> <sic>of</sic> a Parnass. I feel myself too old to go again into leading things.<lb/> It must be with me &#8220;Aut Caesar aut nullus.&#8221; I cannot consent to<lb/> barter these privileges for gold&#59; if they be not therefore&#44; conceded&#44; the<lb/> matter terminates. I have offered to serve the congregation here for</p>
		<pb n="3"/>
			<p>nothing&#44; or if they will not agree to that even <hi rend="underline">now</hi>&#44; I would take<lb/> &#36;500 a year&#44; rather than submit&#44; at my time of life&#44; to restrictions<lb/> which my high spirit will not brook&#44; in another community.<lb/> I do not think my views will suit <placeName>N. O.</placeName> If they do&#44; it will be a<lb/> pleasing disappointment.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I believe I wrote you that&#44; when last in<lb/> <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>&#44; <persName>Carillon</persName> requested me to obtain the situation in <placeName>N. O.</placeName> for him.<lb/> I gave him a flat denial&#44; and he is very aroth<add>&#63;</add> with me in consequence.<lb/> He subsequently wrote me&#44; that if I would give him introductory letters<lb/> and he obtained the appointment&#44; his first duty would be to get a <add>Hebrew</add>.<lb/> A large concession truly&#33; but the charmer could not charm me.<lb/> To a Congregation like that of <placeName>N. O.</placeName> <persName>Carillon</persName> would be a most<lb/> dangerous man. By the bye&#44; I see the London Jewish Chronicle<lb/> has copied a paragraph from a <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> paper&#44; written either by<lb/> <persName>Carillon</persName> or one of his clique&#44; that <persName>Mendes</persName> and I have abolished<lb/> the second days holidays&#44; that the synagogue is closed on those<lb/> days and that these alterations in our former opinions are entirely<lb/> owing to the arguments of <persName>Rabbi Carillon</persName>. On the part of <persName>Mendes</persName><lb/> it has been denied&#59; I did not think <persName>C</persName> of sufficient consequence<lb/> to put forth a disclaimer. My opinions of the second days are the<lb/> same as they ever were&#44; but while persons are willing to visit the<lb/> House of God on those occasions&#44; they will always find me sanctioning<lb/> the act. Individual synagogue amendments or even return to<lb/> primitive customs do not suit me. I want to see the whole join. I never</p>

			<p>was and never will be <persName>Mr. Carillon&#39;s</persName> disciple. You could under<lb/> the head of news items contradict the <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> paragraph&#44; and oblige<lb/> your old friend thereby.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">Who is <persName>W&#95;</persName>&#63; I mean your correspondent in the<lb/> Occident. He writes well&#44; and is evidently a deep thinker.<lb/> Your tactics&#44; as regard <add>Hebrew</add> show your profound generalship.<lb/> The shield of <persName>Fabius</persName> and sword of <persName>marcellus</persName> have you defended<lb/> yourself with. <persName>S. M. Isaac&#39;s</persName> letter is amusing. He is much<lb/> improved.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I have no further news to communicate.<lb/> <persName>Mrs. Nathan</persName> sends her love as usual. Please remember us<lb/> both to all our old friends&#44; and with best wishes for your<lb/> health and prosperity</p>
          <p rend="indent(7)">I am</p>
