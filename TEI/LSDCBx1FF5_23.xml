                                        relative to our new Code of Laws, which were sent<lb/> by
                                                  <persName>Mr. David</persName> hand to be
                                        transmitted to you for printing.</p>
                              <p rend="indent(1)">I am truly apprehensive, from the present
                                        dreadful<lb/> stagnation of commerce, arising from events in
                                                  <placeName>Europe</placeName>, and the

                                        You can have<lb/> no idea of the manner in which emigration
                                        from this spot has<lb/> reduced our numbers. Between the
                                        time of my first arrival here<lb/> and the present, there is
                                        a difference of from 35 to 40 regular<lb/> Sabbath
                                        attendants at public worship, grown men. Some are dead,<lb/>
                                        others gone away, and others, once in business, now in
                                        situations<lb/> which prevent them from visiting the House
                                        of God, as formerly.<lb/> It is really sad to contemplate.
                                        Add to this, the alteration in<lb/> circumstances, Even of
                                        the wealthiest, joined to the dislike of others,<lb/> from

                                        the<lb/> synagogue, and you will ascertain by what a slight

                                        I have so often written you<lb/> on this subject, that you

                                                  <persName>Carillon</persName> requested me to

                                        would be to get a <add>Hebrew</add>.<lb/> A large concession

                                        copied a paragraph from a <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>
                                        paper, written either by<lb/>
                                        <persName>Carillon</persName> or one of his clique, that

                                        abolished<lb/> the second days holidays, that the synagogue
                                        is closed on those<lb/> days and that these alterations in
                                        our former opinions are entirely<lb/> owing to the arguments
                                        of <persName>Rabbi Carillon</persName>. On the part of
                                                  <persName>Mendes</persName><lb/> it has been

                                        consequence<lb/> to put forth a disclaimer. My opinions of
                                        the second days are the<lb/> same as they ever were, but
                                        while persons are willing to visit the<lb/> House of God on
                                        those occasions, they will always find me sanctioning<lb/>
                                        the act. Individual synagogue amendments or even return
                                        to<lb/> primitive customs do not suit me. I want to see the
