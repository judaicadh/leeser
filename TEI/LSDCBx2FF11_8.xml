            <p rend="align(right)">(In <sic>hebrew</sic>) <persName>Washington's</persName>
                birthday.</p>
            <p>My dear Doctor</p>
            <p>I commence my note of acknowledgment with writing a name which<lb/> is not according
                to <sic>hebrew</sic> grammar quite correct; for silent she<lb/> in the middle of a
                word being an impossible syllable according<lb/> to our idiom, but so much is vague
                in the barbarous tongue called<lb/> English. It is rather laughable for you to peak
                of old age,<lb/> as preventing you from reading my <hi rend="underline"
                    >beautiful</hi> clear handwriting.<lb/> Is it not rather a hint that my power of
                tracing letters is<lb/> by reason of lapse of years<lb/> on my part? “<sic>Sin</sic>
                we <sic>wore</sic> first acquaint,”<lb/> near forty years have elapsed, and the
                headless stranger<lb/> whom you welcomed on the <date>second of <sic>may</sic>
                    24</date> has now almost filled<lb/> up the measure of his troubles(?) and
                behold the dark shadows<lb/> of the picture interposing themselves on his sunlight;
                and if<lb/> you feel that time has flown past you not without leaving his<lb/> mark,
                for good or ill, can it be otherwise with me? I can indeed<lb/> make my figures a
                little <sic>mor</sic>
                <sic>palinly</sic> if I choose to draw my<lb/> pen more carefully over the paper;
                but every moment so devoted<lb/> is so much taken form the rapidity of
                    <sic>time8s</sic> flight, and then<lb/> 1 and then <add>?</add> scratch so much
                for the men of the press who<lb/> are all readers of <sic>heiroglyphics</sic>, that
                i have come to fancy <sic>al</sic><lb/> the world printers, if not players in the
                Shakespearian sense.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">“the hand of every man seals his deeds<lb/> in the book of the
                divine record” is a beautiful opinion of the<lb/> ages of
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>, and in this regard we all make our mark;
                hence<lb/> you can <sic>readilly</sic> imagine that I have some good reasons
                for<lb/> carefully writing, and especially to you who are a <add>?</add><lb/> Now I
                have given you quotations enough, and I trust ample apolo<lb/> for the trouble that
                I cause you have to get to the depth of<lb/> my last <add>?</add> mysterious
                contents.</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Well good doctor, I know not that <sic>i</sic> have written for years<lb/> as much
                light correspondence as above. I have<lb/> a few to whom I write more than mere
                business, except <persName>H. N Nathan</persName><lb/> of <placeName>St
                    Thomas</placeName> now, though late of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>. It is
                with me the<lb/> constant roll of the wheel of labor, writing for the public,<lb/>
                speaking to the people, and reading to qualify myself for<lb/> these tasks.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I must still fall back on my idea of <add>?</add><lb/> in lending
                the book, money should not have been mentioned.<lb/> Though nearly the whole of the
                plan may be useless, still the<lb/> idea of the ventilating chimney, I think is
                worth adapting. I<lb/> know not whether your architect will have the ght<add>?</add>
                of it. At the<lb/> same time the work may be fitly placed in the library of the<lb/>
                hospital, when erected as a mention of what had been done<lb/> elsewhere. When it is
                ready for opening I shall, if living, give<lb/> you a few useful books of my own
                manufacture! Only think how<lb/> I speak of literature, as an article of ordinary production,<lb/>
                <add>?</add>; but it is true nonetheless.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I had the pleasure of a visit yesterday of <persName>Miss R E
                    Cohen</persName><lb/> and <persName>Miss Laura Mordecai.</persName> They were
                both well and I was truly<lb/> glad to see them.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Let me hear how you progress with the hospital, which I<lb/> trust
