			<p rend="indent(1)">By invitation of <persName>Rev. Mr. Bokum</persName> one of the Vice Presidents and trav&#45;<lb/>elling agent of this society&#44; we attended on the even. of the <date>27<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> ult. a <add>&#63;</add><lb/> of a meeting held for the purpose of organizing an auxiliary society in<lb/> this city.  From his speech based upon the XXXVII of <persName>Ezekiel</persName> from 1&#45;15<lb/> verses &#40;which is strangely enough as our readers know is one of He<add>&#63;</add> of<lb/> the <date>Passover</date>&#41; we learned that the society has in view to heal the &#8220;dry<lb/> bones&#8221;&#44; the remnants of the house of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; who are scattered &#8220;in the valley&#8221;<lb/> meaning the whole earth&#44; in such a manner that the spirit of the gospel<lb/> may reach and animate them.  But this favor to our race is not to be<lb/> forced upon us as of old by the fire &#38; the sword&#44; nor as in modern<lb/> times by abuse &#38; exclusion from public employment&#44; which procee<lb/>dings be characterized as anti&#45;christians &#38; barbarous &#40;yest how many<lb/> anti&#45;christians and barbarians do exist according to this view&#44; not omitting<lb/> the <persName>king</persName> of <placeName>Prussia</placeName> and the <persName>queen</persName> of <placeName>England</placeName> in whose countries the Jews are<lb/> not equals with their Christian neighbours&#41;&#59; but by acts of kindness&#44;<lb/> charity and benevolence&#59; he urged it at the gospel should not be forced upon our notice<lb/> by words of the preacher but to teach us its practical effects by itself<lb/> <del>kindness</del> <add>&#63;</add> as should prove to the Jews that its spirit is one of real<lb/> goodness &#38; virtue.  He stated that with this view the society had through<lb/> its agent in <placeName>N. Y.</placeName> given away a great deal of money to the poor from<lb/> &#36;5 and up to one hundred Dollars to one individual&#59; but that in<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> instance had the charity been improperly applied by the recipients.<lb/>  <add>&#63;</add> last is high praise in favour of the <add>&#63;</add> of the poor Jews in the<lb/> city many of whom are in abject want of even the necessities of life<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> the <add>&#63;</add> of <persName>Mr. Finestro</persName>.  <persName>Mr. Bokum</persName> farther gave an account</p>

				<p>of his progress thus far in human <add>&#63;</add>&#44; and spoke of a public meeting<lb/> with <persName>Mr. Lawrence Blumenthal</persName> at <placeName>Chambersburg</placeName>&#44; who by the<lb/> courtesy of <persName>Mr. Bokum</persName> obtained the permission of making an exposition<lb/> of the tenets of Judaism before a crowded church in that town.<lb/>  &#40;We may probably have to say something more of this address of our<lb/> friend in a future number.&#41;&#8212;He also advocated to the establish&#45;<lb/>ment of a <add>&#63;</add>prick at <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> in the person of a known<lb/> of state under the patronage of the <persName>Queen</persName> of <placeName>Britain</placeName> and the<lb/> <persName>King</persName> of <placeName>Prussia</placeName>.  He spoke of the alleged infidelity of which we<lb/> have lately heard a good deal as existing among our people&#44;<lb/> and he ascribed it&#44; as also the same phenomenon among<lb/> the catholics&#44; to our acceptance of tradition for us as contained in the Talmud<lb/> and <del>for them as embraced in</del> the so called superstitious practices ari&#45;<lb/>sing therefrom&#59; and he alludes to the new congregation established<lb/> in <placeName>London</placeName> in opposition to rabbinical authority&#44; as a legitimate<lb/> consequence of the missionary labours of the <placeName>London</placeName> Society<lb/> for evangelizing the Jews&#44; who he averred had opened by their<lb/> publication &#38;c the eyes of our brethren in <placeName>England</placeName> to the errors<lb/> of their <add>&#63;</add> to the Talmud.&#42; &#40;&#42;How will our friends of<lb/> the new congregation of <placeName>B<add>&#63;</add> Street</placeName> relish the allegation<lb/> that their reform is the legitimate result of a society<lb/> the object of which is the destruction of the Jewish religion&#63;<lb/>  For our part we should be sorry indeed were any one to ascribe<lb/> any act of ours to the result of such unfriendly advice&#59; and we<lb/> hope that they will boldly deny the assumptions of the missionary.<lb/>  We will <add>&#63;</add>say&#44; that this is not the first time that the opponents<lb/> of Judaism have gloried over the secession &#40;and have feigned to</p>

				<p>discover therein a gradual approach to Christianity.  We<lb/> think that&#44; much as we differ from the gentlemen who have<lb/> too hastily adopted a new form of worship&#44; that they will be<lb/> grieved as much as we were mortified to hear such notices<lb/> ascribed to them&#59; and if they feel inclined we offer them our<lb/> magazine to reply to these unfounded charges&#44; they may<lb/> please to entrust us with a temperate <del>reply</del> exposition calculated<lb/> for our paper.&#93;&#8212;<add>He stated also that is the object of <persName>Mr. <add>&#63;</add></persName><lb/> to employ missionaries to the Jews in all large<lb/> <add>&#63;</add>&#44; and to station one of them in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>.</add>  He referred likewise to our labours&#44; and<lb/> stated something about a controversy which we might probably wage<lb/> against each other&#44; for the sake of ministerial conviction&#59; and in demanding<lb/> public support for the Jewish Chronicle he stated that the managers will<lb/> carefully exclude everything calculated to offend&#59; and nothing should<lb/> be said which could wound the feelings of an Israelite.</p>
				<p>The above is a meager <sic>synnopsis</sic> of the Rev. gentleman&#39;s<lb/> remarks&#44; which appeared to be contemporaneous&#59; we were not in a favourable<lb/> position to take note&#44; if even we had been inclined to do so&#44; yet we<lb/> think that we have reported him fairly and for our purpose fully.<lb/>  Our readers will see from the above that the weapons are changed&#44;<lb/> but that our religion is nevertheless to be attacked.  Flattery &#38; money are<lb/> to do what violence in <del>the first instance</del> old and coarse rudeness in<lb/> more modern times failed to accomplish.  We trust that there<lb/> is not much danger to be apprehended from such means&#44;<lb/> nevertheless there may be a few &#8220;whose heart is turning<add>&#63;</add> this<lb/> day from the Lord their God&#59;&#8221; and it <sic>behoves</sic> us then to omit<lb/> no means in our power to counteract such deeds of our oppo&#45;<lb/>nents.  Of one thing our Jewish friends may rest assured&#44; that if money<lb/> can purchase <hi rend="underline">souls</hi>&#44; they will be ready paid for&#59; because we see</p>
			<pb n="7"/>
				<p>4</p>
				<p>that there is a false species of philanthropy spreading<lb/> over the land which is anxious to catch every straggler and to<lb/> take away any wandering sleep that has missed our fold.  As<lb/> for us we are concerned we regard an inimical everyone who comes<lb/> to deprive us of our religion&#44; be the means or the <add>&#63;</add> what they may&#59; and though we are personally friendly<lb/> to <persName>Mr. Bokum</persName>&#44; both as a gentleman and a preacher&#44; we certainly<lb/> must look upon the efforts he is making as by no means an evidence<lb/> of good will towards our belief.  We cheerfully accord to him the praise<lb/> of moderation and candour&#59; but it would be much better were all<lb/> this moderation &#38; candour exerted to allay prejudices instead of<lb/> drawing away perhaps some <hi rend="underline">unworthy</hi> members from our church.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Respecting the charge of infidelity&#44; we fear that there is some<lb/> truth in it&#59; we do not believe that modern Jews are skeptics&#44; but<lb/> that a practical infidelity regarding religious duties has obtained<lb/> alas&#33; too much currency cannot be denied.  We mean not to enter into the discussion<lb/> this month&#59; but only to call the attention of our brethren to the fact<lb/> that others besides Jews watch their conduct and that their<lb/> neglect of religion brings them to honour&#44; and even causes<lb/> them to be suspected of unbelief in that blessed faith for which<lb/> many would shed their last drop of blood&#44; altho their<lb/> conduct bet<add>&#63;</add> so much indifference.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Lastly with regard to our own self we have never promised<lb/> to wage a controversy with any man.  We probably shall<lb/> admit controversial articles if we think proper&#59; but nothing<lb/> shall induce us to be always tilting like some anxious knight errant<lb/> against all comers.  Indeed no one shall provoke us&#44; if we can</p>
			<pb n="9"/>
				<p>5</p>
				<p>keep our temper&#59; and we will use our discretion in this<lb/> as in every thing else&#44; and act independently <del>from</del> of all parties.<lb/>  The Occident was commenced to diffuse knowledge in our<lb/> religion&#59; and this we mean to do whilst we continue its editor&#59;<lb/> avoid mere controversy which is only a trial of skill&#8212;is therefore evidently not <del>fit</del> suited to our<lb/> object.  We nevertheless assure our friends that we neither fear<lb/> nor want religious arguments&#59; all we meant to say&#44; we will not<lb/> be provoked for any special object&#59; which would evidently be<lb/> the case were we to enter the lists regularly once a month<lb/> against the Jewish Chronicle or its reverend editor.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Nonetheless we thank <persName>Mr Bokum</persName> for his conciliatory<lb/> manner&#44; and we hope always to meet him with equal<lb/> courtesy both personally and if occasion demands it before<lb/> the public.  With these remarks we take our leave for<lb/> the present from the AS.M.C.I. but likely not longer than<lb/> next month.</p>
