			<p rend="indent(1)">We have already published <persName>General Grant&#39;s</persName> in&#45;<lb/>famous order expelling the Jews from his mili&#45;<lb/>tary department.  We now give the published<lb/> record of the <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName> Superior Court in re&#45;<lb/>ference to the suit brought by <persName>Jesse Grant</persName>&#44; father<lb/> of <persName>General Grant</persName>&#44; to recover his share of the<lb/> profits of the cotton speculation in which he<lb/> was engaged with the <persName>Mack Brothers</persName>&#44; his Hebrew<lb/> partners.</p>
				<p rend="align(center)">SUPERIOR COURT.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#34;General Term&#45;<persName>Jesse R. Grant</persName> vs. <persName>Mack<lb/> Brothers</persName>.  <persName>Judge Hoadly</persName> delivered the opinion.<lb/>  The case was reserved from special term on<lb/> demurer to the petition.  The action was insti&#45;<lb/>tuted for the settlement of a partnership ac&#45;<lb/>count.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#34;The plaintiff avers that in <date>December&#44; 1862</date>&#44; he<lb/> entered into partnership with defendants&#44; for the<lb/> purchase of  cotton in the Military Department<lb/> of <persName>U. S. Grant</persName>&#59; the condition of the agreement<lb/> that defendants were to furnish the capital and<lb/> the men to purchase and ship the cotton&#44; and<lb/> the plaintiff to procure at the headquarters of<lb/> <persName>General Grant</persName> a permit to purchase it&#44; secure the<lb/> transportation&#44; and such other facilities as might<lb/> be consistent with the usages and interests of<lb/> the army.  The plaintiff was to receive one&#45;fourth<lb/> share of the net profits of sales after deducting<lb/> fro mgross proceeds the necessary expenses.<lb/>  The petition further states that there was a real&#45;<lb/>ized profit in the defendants&#39; favor of not less<lb/> than &#36;40&#44;000&#44; and that they refuse to render an<lb/> account&#44; or pay the plaintiff his proportion.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#34;The defendants claim that the plaintiff con&#45;<lb/>tributed by his own showing neither capital nor<lb/> lawful service to the copartnership&#44; and that<lb/> their agreement to pay him a share of the<lb/> profits is&#44; therefore&#44; without sufficient consider&#45;<lb/>ation.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#34;The Court cannot presume that the plaintiff<lb/> intended to allege that he undertook that which<lb/> was prohibited by law.  His acts and promises<lb/> may have been illegal&#44; and the partnership one<lb/> for a forbidden enterprise&#59; but in the absence of<lb/> an answer so averring the Court cannot assume<lb/> it&#44; unless the averments are inconsistent with<lb/> any other theory.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#34;The purchase of cotton in the military de&#45;<lb/>partment commanded by <persName>General Grant</persName> was il&#45;<lb/>legal&#44; unless carried on by permission of the<lb/> President&#44; obtained through the Treasury De&#45;<lb/>partment.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#34;The plaintiff avers that he was to go to the<lb/> headquarters of <persName>General Grant</persName> and procure a<lb/> permit to purchase cotton.  Whether this was<lb/> expected to be obtained from the General<lb/> himself&#44; from some member of his staff&#44; or a<lb/> Treasury agent at headquarters&#44; is not stated.<lb/>  Whether the plaintiff was to procure it as a per&#45;<lb/>sonal favor&#44; or by the use of personal influence&#44;<lb/> or in the ordinary mode of business&#44; is not<lb/> shown.  The Court could not presume he was to<lb/> get his permit from an officer not authorized by<lb/> law to give it&#44; or that he was to procure it as the<lb/> reward of personal&#44; political or other illegiti&#45;<lb/>mate influence.  They must rather infer that he<lb/> proposed to solicit and procure a permit in the<lb/> ordinary and proper way&#44; from a Treasury agent<lb/> having authority to issue it.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#34;Again.  It is averred that plaintiff was to and<lb/> did secure transportation.  This may have been<lb/> done by procuring from some quartermaster&#44; or<lb/> other officer controlling it&#44; the improper and ille&#45;<lb/>gal use of Government horses and wagons&#44; or<lb/> steamboats&#59; or he may have hired horses and<lb/> wagons from the people of the country&#44; and se&#45;<lb/>cured steamboat transportation in the usual<lb/> way.  The mere fact that he was to procure<lb/> transportation at the headquarters of <persName>General<lb/> Grant</persName> is not decisive.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#34;The other item of service&#44; the &#39;procuring of<lb/> such other facilities as might be consistent with<lb/> the usages and interests of the army&#44;&#39; is open to<lb/> the same double reading.  The facilities&#44; what&#45;<lb/>ever they were&#44; may <emph rend="italics">have been procured by honest<lb/> or dishonest influences</emph>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#34;For these reasons&#44; the <sic>defence</sic> suggested must<lb/> be presented by answer.  The theory that the em&#45;<lb/>ployment of the plaintiff was to procure the ille&#45;<lb/>gal co operation of the military in a private en&#45;<lb/>terprise must be alleged by sworn answer.  If<lb/> true&#44; it was equally disgraceful to the defendants<lb/> and the plaintiff&#44; and&#44; if proven&#44; would insure<lb/> the dismissal of the petition with reprobation to<lb/> the two parties&#44; upon the principle&#44; among oth&#45;<lb/>ers&#44; <emph rend="italics">in pari delicto&#44; potior est condito defendentis</emph>.<lb/>  Demurrer overruled and leave to answer.&#34;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Judge Storer</persName> agreed with the other members of<lb/> the Court on the question of the pleadings&#44; &#34;and<lb/> felt constrained to say that the whole of the<lb/> trade&#44; as disclosed in this proceeding&#44; was not<lb/> only disgraceful&#44; but tends directly to disgrace<lb/> the country.  It is the price of blood.&#34;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The following comments from the <placeName>New York</placeName><lb/> <emph rend="italics">World</emph> will show the enormity of the infamy of<lb/> this cotton speculation&#44; and the reason why <persName>Gen&#45;<lb/>eral Grant</persName> expelled the Jews&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#34;Even if it should turn out that <persName>Jesse Grant</persName><lb/> had a Treasury permit for this particular specula&#45;<lb/>tion&#44; that fact would not relieve the reputation<lb/> of <persName>General Grant</persName>.  If <persName>Jesse Grant</persName> had such a<lb/> permit&#44; he must have got it through his son&#39;s in&#45;<lb/>fluence.  By his own showing&#44; he obtained it at<lb/> his son&#39;s headquarters.  Except for his relation&#45;<lb/>ship to the Commanding General&#44; any other citi&#45;<lb/>zen could have procured it as easily as he.  What<lb/> he made a matter of bargain and sale was his in&#45;<lb/>fluence with <persName>General Grant</persName>&#59; what he stipulated<lb/> to receive for it was one&#45;fourth of the net profits&#44;<lb/> although he put in no capital and ran no risk.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#34;There is still a darker shade to this transac&#45;<lb/>tion&#44; but it is not yet so well authenticated.  A<lb/> correspondent writes to us upon information<lb/> which he received of one of <persName>Jesse Grant&#39;s</persName> neigh&#45;<lb/>bors&#44; that when <persName>Grant</persName> the father told <persName>Grant</persName> the<lb/> son that the <persName>Macks</persName> refused to settle with him&#44;<lb/> the General sent them word that unless they<lb/> promptly did so he would expel all the Jews<lb/> from his department&#44; a threat which he soon<lb/> after made good by his well&#45;known order for the<lb/> expulsion of the Jews.  This is the first explana&#45;<lb/>tion we have ever seen of the motive of that un&#45;<lb/>accountable and discreditable order&#44; and if <persName>Mack<lb/> Brothers</persName> are really Jews&#44; the explanation is not<lb/> incredible&#44; considering that the main fact of the<lb/> cotton speculation is fully established.&#34;</p>
