				<p>on <date>Friday</date> night &#38; <date>Sabbath</date> morning to evening&#59; I lent him my private<lb/> memorandum book of names that he might call<add>&#63;</add> up and make the<lb/> offerings himself&#44; nevertheless not a line or a message acknow<lb/>ledging my politeness has been received.  Upon the whole the whole have<lb/> treated me&#44; as though I were nothing&#59; yet I am glad that I overcame<lb/> my own ill&#45;will&#44; and offered him to take his seat at the Tebah in<lb/> future&#44; altho strictly speaking he is hardly Hazan.  He however<lb/> read very well and accurate&#44; tho&#39; neither I as well as those that<lb/> spoke in my hearing approved of his style&#59; he sings hardly loud<lb/> enough to lead the congregation in the psalms&#44; which certainly would<lb/> be a great defect.  But the could learn a good deal in practice&#44;<lb/> if he gets in&#44; which is&#44; I repeat again&#44; by no means unlikely if<lb/> the same indifference towards congregational matters prevails<lb/> which has existed these many years.  The opinions and votes of<lb/> the congregation are publicly canvassed<add>&#63;</add>&#44; and wherever <add>&#63;</add> I find my&#45;<lb/>self the object of conversation.  I am truly sick of it&#44; and it <add>&#63;</add><lb/> worries me to bear with the ill&#45;natured remarks&#44; and the <add>&#63;</add><lb/> of truth of which <hi rend="underline">gentlemen</hi> &#38; <hi rend="underline">ladies</hi> even are guilty.  So they public<lb/>ly complained that I had refused him to read&#44; when you know&#59;<lb/> &#38; they also know that I made the offer before he came provided<lb/> I should be asked.  No one surely could expect that I should go<lb/> forward and offer to give him the opportunity of injuring me.<lb/>  Yet so in the world&#44; no matter what you do&#44; you may do <add>&#63;</add><lb/> and persons even whose children I have taught gratis for<lb/> years and gave them books in the bargain&#44; they also talk&#44;<lb/> altho&#39; they have no vote&#59; and if I get hold of them&#44; then<lb/> they never said a word.  It is truly a foul conspiracy&#44; Lately<lb/> up to support a poor brother&#44; without putting the Land<add>&#63;</add> in<lb/> Locket or give to him a farthing&#59; and if the congregation</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>do not see through the scheme&#44; the more in the pity.  <persName>Mr. Moss</persName> &#38; all his<lb/> family except <persName>F. Samuel</persName> as in my favour&#59; and if it were not that<lb/> he would have to do something for his brother&#45;in&#45;law&#44; he would himself<lb/> be the last to support young <persName>Lyons</persName>&#59; but <hi rend="underline">poverty</hi> alters the case&#44;<lb/> and as no one likes to lay out money when <add>&#63;</add> will do&#44; insinu<lb/>ations and falsehood&#44; and perhaps underbidding&#44; and may be a young<lb/> bride will be brought into play to carry the point&#59; I tell you<lb/> merely what people publicity mention&#44; I cannot and will not<lb/> resort to such tricks&#59; I will not marry unless I see fit&#44;<lb/> I say <persName>Lyons</persName> reads well&#44; because he does so&#44; yet they have<lb/> said as much as if he were far my superior&#44; and now<add>&#63;</add><lb/> his own performance has not proved this.  I will not attend<lb/> to what is whispered here and there&#59; but if I would I could<lb/> no doubt  unveil such villainy&#44; as would astonish an honest<lb/> man.  I heard that a certain <hi rend="underline">lady</hi> walked up to <persName>Miss Gratz</persName><lb/> &#40;<add>&#63;</add> on <date>Friday</date>&#41; after the service&#44; and asked her &#8220;how she<lb/> liked the new Hazan&#63; to which she shall have replied&#59; you mean<lb/> the young man that read&#59; he reads well enough&#44; but I knew not<lb/> that he was Hazan yet&#44;&#8221; or some such <add>&#63;</add> reply.  On <date>Sunday</date> evening<lb/> <persName>Miss Gratz</persName> and <persName>Mr Moses</persName> characterised the doing of the <persName>Moss</persName><lb/> family as shameful&#44; and <persName>Mr M.</persName> remarked&#44; that he would be against<lb/> them&#44; if it were only because they had acted so wickedly.  I again<lb/> say&#44; that the bringing out of <persName>Mr. Lyons</persName> was planned a year ago&#44; and<lb/> whilst appearing friendly to me&#44; not a stone was left unturned to<lb/> carry the point in view.  Altho&#39; I hope to be able to maintain my&#45;<lb/>self without the office&#44; I should be sorry to see <persName>Lyons</persName> elected&#44; simply<lb/> because the whole course has been so entirely afforded to religion.</p>
