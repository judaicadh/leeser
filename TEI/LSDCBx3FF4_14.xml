            <pb n="1"/>
            <p>on <date>Friday</date> night &amp; <date>Sabbath</date> morning to evening; I lent
                him my private<lb/> memorandum book of names that he might call<add>?</add> up and
                make the<lb/> offerings himself, nevertheless not a line or a message
                acknow<lb/>ledging my politeness has been received. Upon the whole the whole
                have<lb/> treated me, as though I were nothing; yet I am glad that I overcame<lb/>
                my own ill-will, and offered him to take his seat at the Tebah in<lb/> future, altho
                strictly speaking he is hardly Hazan. He however<lb/> read very well and accurate,
                tho' neither I as well as those that<lb/> spoke in my hearing approved of his style;
                he sings hardly loud<lb/> enough to lead the congregation in the psalms, which
                certainly would<lb/> be a great defect. But the could learn a good deal in
                practice,<lb/> if he gets in, which is, I repeat again, by no means unlikely if<lb/>
                the same indifference towards congregational matters prevails<lb/> which has existed
                these many years. The opinions and votes of<lb/> the congregation are publicly
                    canvassed<add>?</add>, and wherever <add>?</add> I find my-<lb/>self the object
                of conversation. I am truly sick of it, and it <add>?</add><lb/> worries me to bear
                with the ill-natured remarks, and the <add>?</add><lb/> of truth of which <hi
                    rend="underline">gentlemen</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">ladies</hi> even are
                guilty. So they public<lb/>ly complained that I had refused him to read, when you
                know;<lb/> &amp; they also know that I made the offer before he came provided<lb/> I
                should be asked. No one surely could expect that I should go<lb/> forward and offer
                to give him the opportunity of injuring me.<lb/> Yet so in the world, no matter what
                you do, you may do <add>?</add><lb/> and persons even whose children I have taught
                gratis for<lb/> years and gave them books in the bargain, they also talk,<lb/>
                altho' they have no vote; and if I get hold of them, then<lb/> they never said a
                word. It is truly a foul conspiracy, Lately<lb/> up to support a poor brother,
                without putting the Land<add>?</add> in<lb/> Locket or give to him a farthing; and
                if the congregation</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>do not see through the scheme, the more in the pity. <persName>Mr. Moss</persName>
                &amp; all his<lb/> family except <persName>F. Samuel</persName> as in my favour; and
                if it were not that<lb/> he would have to do something for his brother-in-law, he
                would himself<lb/> be the last to support young <persName>Lyons</persName>; but <hi
                    rend="underline">poverty</hi> alters the case,<lb/> and as no one likes to lay
                out money when <add>?</add> will do, insinu<lb/>ations and falsehood, and perhaps
                underbidding, and may be a young<lb/> bride will be brought into play to carry the
                point; I tell you<lb/> merely what people publicity mention, I cannot and will
                not<lb/> resort to such tricks; I will not marry unless I see fit,<lb/> I say
                    <persName>Lyons</persName> reads well, because he does so, yet they have<lb/>
                said as much as if he were far my superior, and now<add>?</add><lb/> his own
                performance has not proved this. I will not attend<lb/> to what is whispered here
                and there; but if I would I could<lb/> no doubt unveil such villainy, as would
                astonish an honest<lb/> man. I heard that a certain <hi rend="underline">lady</hi>
                walked up to <persName>Miss Gratz</persName><lb/> (<add>?</add> on
                    <date>Friday</date>) after the service, and asked her “how she<lb/> liked the
                new Hazan? to which she shall have replied; you mean<lb/> the young man that read;
                he reads well enough, but I knew not<lb/> that he was Hazan yet,” or some such
                    <add>?</add> reply. On <date>Sunday</date> evening<lb/>
                <persName>Miss Gratz</persName> and <persName>Mr Moses</persName> characterised the
                doing of the <persName>Moss</persName><lb/> family as shameful, and <persName>Mr
                    M.</persName> remarked, that he would be against<lb/> them, if it were only
                because they had acted so wickedly. I again<lb/> say, that the bringing out of
                    <persName>Mr. Lyons</persName> was planned a year ago, and<lb/> whilst appearing
                friendly to me, not a stone was left unturned to<lb/> carry the point in view.
                Altho' I hope to be able to maintain my-<lb/>self without the office, I should be
                sorry to see <persName>Lyons</persName> elected, simply<lb/> because the whole
                course has been so entirely afforded to religion.</p>
