            <p>Dear Sir</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">In replying to your esteemed favor, which came to hand
                yesterday,<lb/> I beg to state that my knowledge of <persName>Mr Harris</persName>
                is comparatively of a<lb/> recent date, but during my short acquaintance with him, I
                never discovered<lb/> aught prejudicial to his moral character. He visited me
                repeatedly<lb/> and from the tenor of his conversation, I inferred that he has
                studied well<lb/> both Hebrew &amp; English. Regarding his capacity to fill the
                situation<lb/> for which he has applied, I am utterly unable to pronounce an<lb/>
                opinion, for I neither heard him recite the prayers, nor deliver a<lb/> sermon. The
                two charges brought against <persName>Mr H</persName> would, if<lb/> true, not alone
                militate against his election, but lower him also in<lb/> the estimation of <hi
                    rend="underline">all</hi> his coreligionists; I trust therefore that they<lb/>
                may be proved false. As to myself, I was ignorant of them,<lb/> had I
                    <sic>deem</sic> it my duty on the contrary to state, that a person, who<lb/> had
                spoken disparagingly of his character in my presence, has, in a<lb/> letter, which I
                received last week, retracted his accusation</p>
            <p rend="indent(10)">Believe me etc.</p>
