                be spared many<lb/> more years as a teacher &amp; writer in
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>,<lb/> against the attacks of those who wish to
                break<lb/> down Judaism, I must apologize for not<lb/> answering your letter before,
                but have been<lb/> very much engaged in business &amp; not much in<lb/>
                <placeName>London</placeName> until now, I made some inquiries with<lb/> regard to
                your offer some time back about printing<lb/> a certain number of your Bibles at a
                low price<lb/> but could not learn why the matter fell to the<lb/> ground, no one
                appearing to know, I named it to<lb/>
                <persName>Dr. Adler</persName> &amp; he said we wanted a cheap <hi rend="underline"
                    >Hebrew</hi><lb/> &amp; <hi rend="underline">English</hi> edition for the use of
                Schools, as there<lb/> was not such a work to be had, &amp; the <sic>hebrew</sic>
                ought<lb/> not to be neglected, he also said he appreciated<lb/> you very much,
                &amp; would always be happy to be of<lb/> any service he could to you. If you should
                consider<lb/> it advisable to publish a cheap Hebrew &amp; English<lb/> edition of
                the <hi rend="underline">whole Bible</hi> I would advise you to<lb/> lay your plans
                before <persName>Dr. Adler</persName>, &amp; correspond with<lb/> him on the
                subject, &amp; also make the price the<lb/> lowest possible figure you can.</p>
            <p>I have read &amp; heard with great joy, the foundation<lb/> of an American Board of
                Delegates, it is my<lb/> greatest wish it will prosper &amp; that all<lb/> the
                Orthodox Synagogues that have not yet<lb/> joined will do so, including the Old,
                    <placeName>New<lb/> York</placeName>, Portuguese congregation, which ought
                to</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>have been the first on the list, I consider the<lb/> establishment of this board, the
                first blow at<lb/> Reform, it has already showed the weakness of<lb/> those new
                light Preachers &amp; congregations, inasmuch<lb/> as they are opposed to the
                foundation of that body,<lb/> &amp; have refused (although invited to send<lb/>
                delegates) to join the association, for fear we<lb/> must come to the conclusion
                that the many different<lb/> views of each reform congregation, (for they are<lb/>
                not united themselves) may be crushed by the<lb/> United votes of all the true
                Jewish Orthodox<lb/> Congregations, Is it not strange that these very<lb/> reform
                Preachers &amp; congregations, who branded the<lb/> Board of Deputies of British
                Jews with the<lb/> name of a Bigoted body, at the time they would<lb/> not admit
                delegates from the <placeName>Margaret Street</placeName><lb/> congregation into
                their Society, are the very ones<lb/> who now refuse the invitation to send
                delegates<lb/> to the American Body, I congratulate the body<lb/> also with having
                chosen you for one of their<lb/> Vice Presidents, as many years you have wished<lb/>
                such a Society to be established, &amp; may God<lb/> bless you that you will be
                spared to see a<lb/> great deal of good emanate from the united<lb/> efforts of all
                true Jewish congregations &amp;<lb/> that the blasphemy &amp; Infidelity preached &amp;<lb/>
                <sic>practised</sic> throughout a great many of the new<lb/> reform congregations

                <persName>Revd. Dr.<lb/> Adler</persName> preached in the Great Synagogue,
                taking<lb/> for his text, <hi rend="underline">2nd <persName>Samuel</persName>,
                    Chapter 12</hi> explaining<lb/> that <persName>David</persName> had committed a
                great sin, <persName>Nathan</persName> the</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>Prophet came to him he acknowledged the crime by saying<lb/> I have sinned,
                    <persName>Nathan</persName> then said, he should not die<lb/> but that his sin
                was put aside, he did not say<lb/> his sin was forgiven, but put aside to see if he
                really<lb/> repented, that from that time he never committed<lb/> a single Sin until
                the day of his death, &amp; <sic>therfore</sic><lb/> truly repented &amp; was
                forgiven, showing that our sins<lb/> are laid aside in the same manner, &amp; that
                if we<lb/> truly repent these days, the Almighty will forgive us also. Is not this a
                contrast to the name given<lb/> by the reform preachers to
                    <persName>David</persName> on account<lb/> of this crime, “the greatest sinner
