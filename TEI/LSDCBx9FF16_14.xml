			<p rend="indent(1)"><addressee>Revd. Isaac Leeser</addressee>&#44;</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">Dear Sir&#47;</p>
			<p rend="indent(3)">Wishing you the compliments<lb/> of the season&#44; &#38; that you may be spared many<lb/> more years as a teacher &#38; writer in <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44;<lb/> against the attacks of those who wish to break<lb/> down Judaism&#44; I must apologize for not<lb/> answering your letter before&#44; but have been<lb/> very much engaged in business &#38; not much in<lb/> <placeName>London</placeName> until now&#44; I made some inquiries with<lb/> regard to your offer some time back about printing<lb/> a certain number of your Bibles at a low price<lb/> but could not learn why the matter fell to the<lb/> ground&#44; no one appearing to know&#44; I named it to<lb/> <persName>Dr. Adler</persName> &#38; he said we wanted a cheap <hi rend="underline">Hebrew</hi><lb/> &#38; <hi rend="underline">English</hi> edition for the use of Schools&#44; as there<lb/> was not such a work to be had&#44; &#38; the <sic>hebrew</sic> ought<lb/> not to be neglected&#44; he also said he appreciated<lb/> you very much&#44; &#38; would always be happy to be of<lb/> any service he could to you.  If you should consider<lb/> it advisable to publish a cheap Hebrew &#38; English<lb/> edition of the <hi rend="underline">whole Bible</hi> I would advise you to<lb/> lay your plans before <persName>Dr. Adler</persName>&#44; &#38; correspond with<lb/> him on the subject&#44; &#38; also make the price the<lb/> lowest possible figure you can.</p>
				<p>I have read &#38; heard with great joy&#44; the foundation<lb/> of an American Board of Delegates&#44; it is my<lb/> greatest wish it will prosper &#38; that all<lb/> the Orthodox Synagogues that have not yet<lb/> joined will do so&#44; including the Old&#44; <placeName>New<lb/> York</placeName>&#44; Portuguese congregation&#44; which ought to</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>have been the first on the list&#44; I consider the<lb/> establishment of this board&#44; the first blow at<lb/> Reform&#44; it has already showed the weakness of<lb/> those new light Preachers &#38; congregations&#44; inasmuch<lb/> as they are opposed to the foundation of that body&#44;<lb/> &#38; have refused &#40;although invited to send<lb/> delegates&#41; to join the association&#44; for fear we<lb/> must come to the conclusion that the many different<lb/> views of each reform congregation&#44; &#40;for they are<lb/> not united themselves&#41; may be crushed by the<lb/> United votes of all the true Jewish Orthodox<lb/> Congregations&#44; Is it not strange that these very<lb/> reform Preachers &#38; congregations&#44; who branded the<lb/> Board of Deputies of British Jews with the<lb/> name of a Bigoted body&#44; at the time they would<lb/> not admit delegates from the <placeName>Margaret Street</placeName><lb/> congregation into their Society&#44; are the very ones<lb/> who now refuse the invitation to send delegates<lb/> to the American Body&#44; I congratulate the body<lb/> also with having chosen you for one of their<lb/> Vice Presidents&#44; as many years you have wished<lb/> such a Society to be established&#44; &#38; may God<lb/> bless you that you will be spared to see a<lb/> great deal of good emanate from the united<lb/> efforts of all true Jewish congregations &#38;<lb/> that the blasphemy &#38; Infidelity preached &#38;<lb/> <sic>practised</sic> throughout a great many of the new<lb/> reform congregations may be <sic>anihilated</sic> for ever<lb/> &#38; that they may return again to true Judaism&#44;<lb/> Yesterday being Penitential <date>Sabbath</date> <persName>Revd. Dr.<lb/> Adler</persName> preached in the Great Synagogue&#44; taking<lb/> for his text&#44; <hi rend="underline">2nd <persName>Samuel</persName>&#44; Chapter 12</hi> explaining<lb/> that <persName>David</persName> had committed a great sin&#44; <persName>Nathan</persName> the</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>Prophet came to him he acknowledged the crime by saying<lb/> I have sinned&#44; <persName>Nathan</persName> then said&#44; he should not die<lb/> but that his sin was put aside&#44; he did not say<lb/> his sin was forgiven&#44; but put aside to see if he really<lb/> repented&#44; that from that time he never committed<lb/> a single Sin until the day of his death&#44; &#38; <sic>therfore</sic><lb/> truly repented &#38; was forgiven&#44; showing that our sins<lb/> are laid aside in the same manner&#44; &#38; that if we<lb/> truly repent these days&#44; the Almighty will forgive us also.  Is not this a contrast to the name given<lb/> by the reform preachers to <persName>David</persName> on account<lb/> of this crime&#44; &#8220;the greatest sinner in <placeName>Israel</placeName>.&#8221;<lb/>  <persName>Mr. Herman Adler</persName> B. A. second son of the Chief Rabbi<lb/> Preached on the first day of <date>New Year</date> in the<lb/> New Synagogue&#44; taking for his text <persName>Jeremiah</persName><lb/> Chapter 10. Verse 16. he also lectures in that<lb/> Synagogue on <date>Day of Atonement</date>&#44; he is a young<lb/> man fit to set an example to some older<lb/> preachers in <placeName>America</placeName>&#44; I will now bring this<lb/> to a close wishing you well over your fast<lb/> &#38; that you may be inscribed in the book<lb/> of life.  I remain</p>
