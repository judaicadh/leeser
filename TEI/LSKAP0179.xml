                <date>Sunday 9th May 31 Omer 5590</date>.</p>
            <p><addressee>Mr. Judah</addressee>.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Your letter of the <date>5th</date> was received the day following
                after the bank had<lb/> closed, or else, it is highly probable, that you would have
                been in possession of the enclosed<lb/> change for two or three days; but as I could
                not get the immense an count before<lb/>
                <date>Friday</date> morning, I had no chance of sending or writing before this
                morning.<lb/> When I presented the notable check to the teller, he smiled, and well
                he might; it<lb/> was already eight &amp; half months old and so big at one; and
                then its long journey<lb/> over stork and dale, it was enough to make any one laugh.
                But if you<lb/> or <persName>Abbot</persName> have more such things to attend to, I
                shall serve you with<lb/> the greatest promptitude. Please to write or tell this to
                the gentleman,<lb/> whenever you write to him or see him. I have not a great deal to
                do and<lb/> the majority of the banks are within half a mile of my residence in<lb/>
                <placeName>Market, Chestnut, and second Streets</placeName>, and so it cannot cost
                me a great deal<lb/> of trouble. Besides, the number of banks is much smaller than
                in <placeName>New_<lb/> York</placeName>, and I almost think I can enumerate them
                easily. Let us see: the<lb/> United States Bank; Farmers &amp; Mechanics; &amp; the
                North American Banks in <placeName>Ches<lb/>nut</placeName>; the Schuylkill &amp;
                Commercial Banks in <placeName>Market</placeName>; the Philadelphia<lb/> Bank,
                    <placeName>corner of 4th &amp; <sic>Chesnut</sic></placeName>; Girard's Bank,
                    <placeName>Third near Walnut</placeName> the Penn,<lb/>sylvania <del>&amp;
                    Mechanics</del> Bank in <placeName>Second between Walnut &amp;
                        <sic>Chesnut</sic></placeName>
                <add>and the Mechanics in <placeName>second between</placeName></add>
                <placeName><sic>Chesnut</sic><lb/> and Market</placeName>. I do not believe, that
                there is another bank in the City proper; but there are <hi rend="underline">at
                    least</hi> three more in the liberties; in <placeName>Southwark</placeName>, the
                Bank of Southwark; in <placeName>Callowhill street</placeName> the
                    <sic>Penntownship</sic> Bank and in the<lb/> Countryside of <placeName>Vine
                    street</placeName>, the Northern Liberties Bank; all these establish_<lb/>ments
                are in good repute, and rather more safe, than the New Yorkers. But<lb/> one Bank, I
                believe the Mechanics, had applied last winter for a renewal of<lb/> charter, and it
                was refused for the present, upon the following ridiculous pretext:<lb/> while the
                subscription for the relieve of Jefferson was going about, the cashier<lb/> or a
                director (I know not which) was applied to to contribute his mite<add>?</add>, which
                he<lb/> refused to do, <del>with</del> using some insulting language. This was
                mentioned in the house of de,<lb/>legates, and it produced a powerful effect, as the
                bill was immediately laid</p>
            <pb n="1V"/>
            <p>Upon the table, and I am told, that the redoubtable German members will not vote<lb/>
                for a new charter to this bank, till they change the name to Jefferson Bank.<lb/>
                This surely is ridiculous enough, but I am also told, that this bank when first<lb/>
                chartered, it was in the hands of <hi rend="underline">Republicans</hi>, but has
                since got into those <lb/> of Federalists!! and then they have indulged a little in
                unwarrantable spend_<lb/>ations, like perhaps, most other banks. But you may rely
                upon the<lb/> truth <del>about</del> of the story about the collecting for
                Jefferson, as this was in the<lb/> papers.__</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">You seem to give me up for a bad job; you are however mistaken, I
                listen<lb/> to the advice of every one, and this very thing of hearing every one
                perplexes<lb/> me so much, for I frequently do not know, which side to turn to. I
                have<lb/> had a plenty of <hi rend="underline">cheap</hi> advice, but for real good
                assistance that is to come<lb/> yet.__ You deplore my bad luck, that <persName>Miss
                    Etting</persName> has not been <persName>Master<lb/> Etting</persName>; but calm
                your regrets, for boys bring nothing, and girls bring nothing,<lb/> I was at three
                    <hi rend="underline">Beriths</hi> and two weddings, and not one cent of
                offerings or<lb/> presents. The Bridegrooms paid me one 20 the other 10 Dollars, and
                though the<lb/> families and guests on both occasions are rich, the Hazan alas! Did
                not count<lb/> his fingers <hi rend="underline">blue</hi> by the profits....This
                however must be expected in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName><lb/> where cold
                civility pays for all things. It is well that I am not <sic>covetuous</sic>,<lb/> or
                else I should be greatly disappointed. But I will not complain, for I see<lb/> that
                I am doing so much better than many young men with ten times my<lb/> knowledge and
                opportunities of pushing themselves forward.__</p>
            <p>You do not like my newspaper scribbling; you are right partly, but<lb/> the price you
                said was just my first <sic><hi rend="underline">offence</hi></sic> for more than a
                year; yet it<lb/> was flatteringly received, and even the old critics and terror of authors,<lb/>
                <persName>Mr. Walsh</persName> called it interesting. But if you as little to do as
                I have, you<lb/> would have little doubt, be oftener caught <hi rend="underline"
                    >poaching</hi>, than I have<lb/> been.__Uncle has not written to me for more
                than two weeks. I am glad,<lb/> he is going to live with you.—Have you no news <hi
                    rend="underline">whatever</hi>, relative to yourself<lb/> and others to
                communicate to your</p>
