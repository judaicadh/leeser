				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> <date>Sunday 9th May 31 Omer 5590</date>.</p>
				<p><addressee>Mr. Judah</addressee>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Your letter of the <date>5th</date> was received the day following after the bank had<lb/> closed&#44; or else&#44; it is highly probable&#44; that you would have been in possession of the enclosed<lb/> change for two or three days&#59; but as I could not get the immense an count before<lb/> <date>Friday</date> morning&#44; I had no chance of sending or writing before this morning.<lb/>  When I presented the notable check to the teller&#44; he smiled&#44; and well he might&#59; it<lb/> was already eight &#38; half months old and so big at one&#59; and then its long journey<lb/> over stork and dale&#44; it was enough to make any one laugh.  But if you<lb/> or <persName>Abbot</persName> have more such things to attend to&#44; I shall serve you with<lb/> the greatest promptitude.  Please to write or tell this to the gentleman&#44;<lb/> whenever you write to him or see him.  I have not a great deal to do and<lb/> the majority of the banks are within half a mile of my residence in<lb/> <placeName>Market&#44; Chestnut&#44; and second Streets</placeName>&#44; and so it cannot cost me a great deal<lb/> of trouble.  Besides&#44; the number of banks is much smaller than in <placeName>New&#95;<lb/> York</placeName>&#44; and I almost think I can enumerate them easily.  Let us see&#58; the<lb/> United States Bank&#59; Farmers &#38; Mechanics&#59; &#38; the North American Banks in <placeName>Ches<lb/>nut</placeName>&#59; the Schuylkill &#38; Commercial Banks in <placeName>Market</placeName>&#59; the Philadelphia<lb/> Bank&#44; <placeName>corner of 4th &#38; <sic>Chesnut</sic></placeName>&#59; Girard&#39;s Bank&#44; <placeName>Third near Walnut</placeName> the Penn&#44;<lb/>sylvania <del>&#38; Mechanics</del> Bank in <placeName>Second between Walnut &#38; <sic>Chesnut</sic></placeName> <add>and the Mechanics in <placeName>second between</placeName></add> <placeName><sic>Chesnut</sic><lb/> and Market</placeName>.  I do not believe&#44; that there is another bank in the City proper&#59; but there are <hi rend="underline">at least</hi> three more in the liberties&#59; in <placeName>Southwark</placeName>&#44; the Bank of Southwark&#59; in <placeName>Callowhill street</placeName> the <sic>Penntownship</sic> Bank and in the<lb/> Countryside of <placeName>Vine street</placeName>&#44; the Northern Liberties Bank&#59; all these establish&#95;<lb/>ments are in good repute&#44; and rather more safe&#44; than the New Yorkers.  But<lb/> one Bank&#44; I believe the Mechanics&#44; had applied last winter for a renewal of<lb/> charter&#44; and it was refused for the present&#44; upon the following ridiculous pretext&#58;<lb/> while the subscription for the relieve of Jefferson was going about&#44; the cashier<lb/> or a director &#40;I know not which&#41; was applied to to contribute his mite<add>&#63;</add>&#44; which he<lb/> refused to do&#44; <del>with</del> using some insulting language.  This was mentioned in the house of de&#44;<lb/>legates&#44; and it produced a powerful effect&#44; as the bill was immediately laid</p>
			<pb n="1V"/>
				<p>Upon the table&#44; and I am told&#44; that the redoubtable German members will not vote<lb/> for a new charter to this bank&#44; till they change the name to Jefferson Bank.<lb/>  This surely is ridiculous enough&#44; but I am also told&#44; that this bank when first<lb/> chartered&#44; it was in the hands of <hi rend="underline">Republicans</hi>&#44; but has since got into those <lb/> of Federalists&#33;&#33; and then they have indulged a little in unwarrantable spend&#95;<lb/>ations&#44; like perhaps&#44; most other banks.  But you may rely upon the<lb/> truth <del>about</del> of the story about the collecting for Jefferson&#44; as this was in the<lb/> papers.&#95;&#95;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">You seem to give me up for a bad job&#59; you are however mistaken&#44; I listen<lb/> to the advice of every one&#44; and this very thing of hearing every one perplexes<lb/> me so much&#44; for I frequently do not know&#44; which side to turn to.  I have<lb/> had a plenty of <hi rend="underline">cheap</hi> advice&#44; but for real good assistance that is to come<lb/> yet.&#95;&#95; You deplore my bad luck&#44; that <persName>Miss Etting</persName> has not been <persName>Master<lb/> Etting</persName>&#59; but calm your regrets&#44; for boys bring nothing&#44; and girls bring nothing&#44;<lb/> I was at three <hi rend="underline">Beriths</hi> and two weddings&#44; and not one cent of offerings or<lb/> presents.  The Bridegrooms paid me one 20 the other 10 Dollars&#44; and though the<lb/> families and guests on both occasions are rich&#44; the Hazan alas&#33; Did not count<lb/> his fingers <hi rend="underline">blue</hi> by the profits....This however must be expected in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName><lb/> where cold civility pays for all things.  It is well that I am not <sic>covetuous</sic>&#44;<lb/> or else I should be greatly disappointed.  But I will not complain&#44; for I see<lb/> that I am doing so much better than many young men with ten times my<lb/> knowledge and opportunities of pushing themselves forward.&#95;&#95;</p>
				<p>You do not like my newspaper scribbling&#59; you are right partly&#44; but<lb/> the price you said was just my first <sic><hi rend="underline">offence</hi></sic> for more than a year&#59; yet it<lb/> was flatteringly received&#44; and even the old critics and terror of authors&#44;<lb/> <persName>Mr. Walsh</persName> called it interesting.  But if you as little to do as I have&#44; you<lb/> would have little doubt&#44; be oftener caught <hi rend="underline">poaching</hi>&#44; than I have<lb/> been.&#95;&#95;Uncle has not written to me for more than two weeks.  I am glad&#44;<lb/> he is going to live with you.&#8212;Have you no news <hi rend="underline">whatever</hi>&#44; relative to yourself<lb/> and others to communicate to your</p>
