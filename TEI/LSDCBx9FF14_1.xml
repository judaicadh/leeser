            <p rend="indent(1)">Dear Sir</p>
            <p rend="indent(2)">Your esteemed favor of the <date>6th</date> inst came<lb/> duly to
                hand and I am much grieved to learn that you had been<lb/> seriously indisposed I
                trust that you are again restored to health<lb/> and sincerely hope that our
                Heavenly Father will bless your future<lb/> days with uninterrupted health and
                happiness. You <hi rend="underline">are</hi> correct in<lb/> your estimate of the
                organ innovation, and the motives which<lb/> inspired the invocation of the muses;
                but I think you are wrong<lb/> in the sentiment that “the gentiles must be anxious
                for us to yield<lb/> as idle our expectation of a messiah &amp;c„. If the doctrine
                were to be promul<lb/>gated that the Jewish prophecies did not justify the
                    <sic>beleif</sic> in the advent<lb/> of a Personage would it not be a direct
                attack upon their fundamental<lb/>
                <sic>beleif</sic>? For they take the prophecies &amp; find them fulfilled in the
                persons<lb/> of their Messiah notwithstanding the palpable contradictions that
                instead<lb/> of the “Prince of peace„ He has been the demon of strife war &amp;
                bloodshed<lb/> with all their train of sorrows and crime.=If this idea
                prevailed<lb/> I think it would be a direct blow at the very foundation of<lb/>
                their Religion. Do you concern with me now? The <hi rend="underline">new</hi> creed
                I herewith<lb/> transcribe for your edification, it was concocted by <persName>Mr
                    Poznanski</persName> &amp; <persName>Mr<lb/> Joshua Lazarus</persName> before
                the dedication of the synagogue &amp; placed upon<lb/> a Tablet in gilt letter on
                the right of the <hi rend="underline">achol</hi> on the left is placed<lb/> the 10
                Commandments. Before this excitement I presume no one read them<lb/> at least very
                few. I myself never did read them while then feeling<lb/> confident that
                    <persName>Mr P.</persName> had given us the Creed handed down to us by<lb/>
                <persName>Maimonides</persName>. Inform me <hi rend="underline">if you can</hi>,
                where he got his authority for<lb/> this version, &amp; if it would be recognized by
                Jews? Here it is—</p>
            <p>I We believe in the existence of a Supreme Being who created governs &amp; sustains
                the Universe.</p>
            <p>II We believe that this Being is the only true &amp; living God, the only Divine
                Being, only<lb/> one in Unity, and without plurality in any sense whatever.</p>
            <p>III We believe that God is incorporeal &amp; incomprehensible that he has never put
                on the figure<lb/> or body of any thing in Creation &amp; that there is nothing like
                him in the Universe.—</p>
            <p>IV We believe that God is without beginning &amp; without end &amp; that He is the
                only Eternal Being</p>
            <p>V We believe that God reigns alone over the Universe; that there exists no mediator
                between<lb/> man &amp; his maker &amp; that it is proper to pray to Him only, &amp;
                not through the merits of any<lb/> other being</p>
            <p>VI We believe that the Prophets were the only persons inspired by God, &amp; that all
                their words are true</p>
            <p>VII We believe that <del>the</del>
                <persName>Moses</persName> was the greatest of the Prophets &amp; that none has

            <p>VIII We believe that the divine Law in our <sic>posession</sic> is that which was
                delivered to our<lb/> Fathers by <persName>Moses</persName>, &amp; that all divine
                communication ceased with <persName>Malachi</persName> the last of<lb/> the
                Prophets</p>
            <p>IX We believe that the divine Law delivered by <persName>Moses</persName>, will never
                be changed, nor altered</p>
            <p>X We believe that God knows all our thoughts and actions.—</p>
            <p>XI We believe that God rewards all who observes his commands &amp; punishes those who
                transgress them</p>
            <p>XII We believe that the Messiah announced by the Prophets is <hi rend="underline"
                    >not</hi> come—<lb/> the Prophecies in relation to his coming <hi
                    rend="underline">not being fulfilled</hi></p>
            <p>XIII We believe that the soul is <hi rend="underline">Immortal</hi>, and that we
                shall be<lb/> accountable for our actions in the life to come.—</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">This creed was also printed some time since &amp; used in the school
                for the instruction<lb/> of Jewish youth &amp; strange to say it passed the critical
                ordeal of all of us. There<lb/> is much subtle wording in it &amp; several passages
                are blows dealt at the gentiles<lb/> and have no existence in the Text. Let me have
                your views upon it. How can<lb/> you advise the continuance of <persName>Mr
                    Poznanski</persName> as Hazan when he laughs at the idea<lb/> of observing the
                second day of our Holidays. We know his sentiments and can we<lb/>
                <sic>beleive</sic> in the <sic>effiacy</sic> or truth of prayer from the lips of him
                who does not<lb/>
                <sic>beleive</sic> in the occasion which calls us together to offer up that prayer.
                You<lb/> might with the same propriety assert that there would be efficacy in
                the<lb/> prayers of an atheist. You cannot have read our reply carefully; read
                over<lb/> his second letter to the Trustees &amp; you will there find that he will
                preach<lb/> errors &amp; abuses until the people tell him through the Board of
                Trustees<lb/> to preach truths. You must know that in addition to these
                circumstances <persName>Mr<lb/> Poznanski</persName> in conversation with several
                Christian Ministers of our<lb/> city asserted, “That the Messiah had not come,
                nor</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>did the Prophecies justify the belief that he was to come as a Personage,<lb/> it was
                figurative, an ideality, &amp; meant a happy &amp; peaceful <del>stake</del>
                state<lb/> of things, enlightenment peace &amp;c this was our messiah„ alluding to<lb/>
                <placeName>Carolina</placeName> or the <placeName>U. states</placeName>. In his
                dedicatory sermons he spoke<lb/> of the “<placeName>U. S.</placeName> as our
                    <placeName>Palestine</placeName>; <placeName>Charleston</placeName> our
                    <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> &amp; this (alluding to the<lb/> synagogue) our
                Temple. I was induced by the solicitation of one of his<lb/> friends to ask him if
                this were true. This <sic>occured</sic> a few days since<lb/> His reply was, That
                the most amicable form of telling the question was<lb/> to submit it to the courts
                of the country although he regretted it much &amp;<lb/> declined to answer the
                question, until he testified on the witness stand.<lb/> This is what Lawyers would
                call a <hi rend="underline">negative pregnants</hi> or a denial<lb/> confirming the
                fact. Why not deny it at once if untrue? and I should<lb/> have been happy to have
                contradicted it—Take these facts in connection<lb/> with the <hi rend="underline"
                    >new creed</hi> &amp; let me have your opinion. He told me moreover<lb/> that
                when the case came on for trial he would prove things countenanced<lb/> and enjoined
                upon us by the Rabbins which would tend to injure us in<lb/> the eyes of the
                christian community. Not being versed in Talmudical lore<lb/> I am at a loss to know
                what grave charges he can bring before a<lb/> christian Tribunal to injure us. The
                cause he espouses must be very<lb/> bad if it requires such disclosures to uphold
                it, &amp; like <persName>Samson</persName> he<lb/> will have to be commingled in the
                ruin he would hurl upon us.<lb/> He said he would also prove that the keeping of the
                second days of<lb/> the Holidays was not even <hi rend="underline">enjoined</hi> by
                the Rabbins and therefore an<lb/> abuse, that we had now obtained the precise time
                &amp; it was folly to<lb/> keep more than one day. Have the Rabbins advocated
                doctrines<lb/> subsequent to our ideas of charity &amp; good will? Rumor says
                that<lb/> he intends to prove that if a Gentile falls into the water &amp; a jew
                could<lb/> save him the Rabbis say let him drown„—&amp; may such barbarous<lb/>
                doctrines at which humanity shudders</p>
