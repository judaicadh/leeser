                <placeName>Manchester</placeName><lb/> 4 years, having credentials therefrom, and
                here in<lb/>
                <placeName>Brooklyn</placeName> in <persName>Peter O <sic>Haras</sic></persName>
                establishment 12 mo<lb/> where he drew the design and done the fine work<lb/> of a
                Monument that was sent to <placeName>Virginia</placeName> for<lb/> 5.000$ with 'done
                by <persName>Peter O Hara</persName>
                <placeName>Brooklyn</placeName>' on it<lb/> and another standing in
                    <placeName>Newark</placeName> for 600, and many<lb/> others, as he was foreman
                of 300 men, now I feel <hi rend="underline">I</hi><lb/> have been wronged, if a Jew
                does wrong is it not a<lb/> disgrace to all Jews? if a Jew is honorable in good
                and<lb/> great works, does he not add to the dignity of all<lb/>
                <placeName>Israel</placeName>. now all this man requires is to have his work<lb/>
                brought out and made known. Oh! if our Dear Brother<lb/>
                <persName>Solomon</persName> were here, he felt with me, in those things<lb/> to
                encourage the talent of <placeName>Israel</placeName> was the pride of his<lb/>
                heart. God rest. and Amen</p>
