          <p rend="indent(1)">My Dear Sir&#44;</p>
          <p rend="indent(3)">It was with no little anxiety that I daily<lb/> looked for the arrival of our good friend <persName>Revd. Mr Isaacs</persName> &#40;which took place this<lb/> day a fortnight&#41; both for himself as well as to obtain precise news from you<lb/> it was shortly after on the Evening I had an interview with him&#8212;he dined with me<lb/> on the <date>Tuesday</date>&#44; and you may easily suppose that the chief topic on both meetings<lb/> which truly interested me was your affair. He delivered me your letter. I am<lb/> truly mortified at your present state and situation&#33; <add>Hebrew</add> my dear brother<lb/> I will exclaim&#44; is this the reward after 20 years labour&#63; <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> I am further wounded to find the result <del>such</del> of my letters such&#44; so important&#44; strongly<lb/> argued&#44; and indeed such feeling ones which I addressed <persName>Mr. A. Hart</persName> on your<lb/> behalf <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; my first one to him was with all the <hi rend="underline">dignities</hi> &#38; <hi rend="underline">honors</hi> of <hi rend="underline">Parnas</hi>&#44;<lb/> and indeed he must have communicated it to his colleagues &#38; friends for on<lb/> some of my observations he says this. &#34;Neither contention or schism exist or is<lb/> likely to exist in our midst and your letter is the first intimation to myself<lb/> and the board of managers of such an event.&#34; Any passage in any part of<lb/> my correspondence you are at full liberty to show only <hi rend="underline">such passages</hi> which<lb/> might be of advantage to you&#44; but I solemnly protest that in <hi rend="underline">no way whatever</hi><lb/> touching any individual such as <persName>Mr Morais</persName> &#38;c &#40;as he is a friend&#41; and any <sic>triffling</sic><lb/> information must be kept sacred and in no way my name mingled&#59; trusting<lb/> to your honor and <hi rend="underline">integrity</hi> that such passages at all times will be kept<lb/> confidentially&#59; <add>Hebrew</add> Our friend <persName>Isaacs</persName> he is a truly good &#38; honest man<lb/> I have known something of him before his departure for <placeName>America</placeName>&#44; but my<lb/> intimacy was then with his brother <persName>David</persName>&#44; their father was a worthy person <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>. <persName>Revd S</persName> I see is this day absent&#44; gone to <placeName>Holland</placeName> to the same relative<lb/> on his return to <placeName>America</placeName> he will give you a correct and precise account of our English<lb/> Jews&#44; that which I have <hi rend="underline">pointed</hi> out to him&#44; and he himself has witnessed<lb/> the state of affairs&#59; <hi rend="underline">flattery</hi>&#44; <hi rend="underline">emptiness</hi> and similar <sic>saleable</sic> articles only&#59;</p>

			<p><hi rend="underline">no man</hi> in this world would I be so happy as to embrace and make my<lb/> friend and companion like yourself&#8212;we have not your equal here who can<lb/> work for the Jew cause as yourself&#44; your learning&#44; your information&#59; but it is<lb/> not a market for <hi rend="underline">genuine Gold</hi>. They <sic>dont</sic> want it&#44; anything <hi rend="underline">brass</hi>&#44; <hi rend="underline">copper</hi> &#38;c<lb/> so that it has a gloss <add>Hebrew</add> as for literature <sic>dont</sic> talk of it. I know what my<lb/> old friend the great <persName>Solomon Bennett</persName> suffered who had <hi rend="underline">sterling</hi> works&#44; was it not for<lb/> the Christian friends would his work on the Temple &#38; Engraving be out&#8212;or his<lb/> judge by my <hi rend="underline">small</hi> &#38; <sic>triffling</sic> portion of the <add>Hebrew</add> which I merely published to put<lb/> them to the trial&#44; who came forward to uphold me and say let it published&#63; it certainly<lb/> was not <hi rend="underline">Dedicated</hi> to some <hi rend="underline">one</hi>&#8212;but made all my brethren poor &#38; rich <hi rend="underline">one</hi>&#59; 1000<lb/> are spent to get <hi rend="underline">honors</hi> &#38; <hi rend="underline">titles</hi>. I have sent you my Dr. Sir a small sermon<lb/> through the hand of <persName>Mr. Hart</persName> which no doubt you have received. I have<lb/> had no answer still from the said gentlemen on my second letter to him <date>19th<lb/> Adar</date> a reply to his remarks my conclusion to him was as follows &#34;I addressed<lb/> myself to you candidly as a person of high station and reputation&#44; and also<lb/> as a friend of <persName>Revd. Mr. Leeser</persName> of whom I have formed a very high opinion<lb/> and for whom I entertain great respect&#44; admiring his talents&#44; and<lb/> conceiving him to be a man worthy of honor and a <add>Hebrew</add> &#38;c and with<lb/> your own words &#34;that He has done more for the Jews in <placeName>America</placeName> than any<lb/> other Hazan.&#34; and who after 20 years in office&#44; and now should<lb/> be <hi rend="underline">out</hi> of <hi rend="underline">office</hi>&#44; I cannot but regard not only with regret&#8212;but as a<lb/> calamity.&#34; and I continued that even some little you might<lb/> have been in the fault for <hi rend="underline">publishing</hi>&#8212;I fully trusted &#38; looked <hi rend="underline">from him</hi>&#44;<lb/> and he might make use of my name to the whole of the congregation<lb/> regarding you <hi rend="underline"><add>Hebrew</add></hi> the love they <hi rend="underline">should</hi> cherish &#38; entertain<lb/> <hi rend="underline">for a great man like yourself and who for 20 years instructed them the</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">word of God</hi>. I hope some of the words may have an effect. I solemnly<lb/> declare to you that I never felt for any one or God per your treatment.<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>&#8212;I would at once make friends with <persName>Mr. H.</persName> for really he<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> appears to have been <hi rend="underline">your friend</hi>. I shall copy you his language<lb/> in his letter <date>25th Shebat</date>. &#34;When at the time he wrote the article he was aware</p>
		<pb n="3"/>
			<p>that <hi rend="underline">two</hi> of the three meetings were for special purposes &#38; at which the<lb/> members refused to allow any thing to be offered. &#40;except for the purpose<lb/> called&#41; but has also spoken of me in a manner unbecoming a <hi rend="underline">friend</hi>&#44;<lb/> let alone a friend of upwards of Twenty years standing&#44; you will<lb/> therefore perceive that I cannot&#44; as you say I may &#34;freely communicate<lb/> with <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> on the subject of your letter altho he has as you <del>say</del><lb/> remark cognizance of your intention to write me.&#34; you must excuse<lb/> my long letters and in the manner they are wrote I am awaiting your<lb/> immediate answer to this and let me know precisely <hi rend="underline">how affairs stand</hi>.<lb/> no doubt all the candidates are on the <hi rend="underline">look</hi> out. In prayer to God may<lb/> He be <add>Hebrew</add> of all your opponents <add>Hebrew</add> that you<lb/> have been reelected in the sincere <add>Hebrew</add> wish of <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> As n<add>&#63;</add><lb/> <add>&#63;</add> honor is such that I should not conceal <add>&#63;</add><lb/> <add>&#63;</add> thing from you&#44; I deem it proper to send you a correct copy of <add>&#63;</add><lb/> <add>&#63;</add> in <persName>Mr. H</persName> letter to me&#44; at the same time I must repeat any<lb/> part depending on your honor you will make use of them to save you only<lb/> but that my name be not mingled or to be made <add>&#63;</add>&#8212;I trust to<lb/> you on this&#33; &#34;<hi rend="underline">I now desire</hi> to state for your information that the late<lb/> misunderstanding between <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> and this congregation tis between<lb/> the <add>&#63;</add>pass of a nut shell&#44; and <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> can only blame himself<lb/> &#40;not his friend or the congregation&#41; if he now finds that he has placed<lb/> himself by his own obstinacy in so unenviable a position for a man<lb/> of his high talents and learning&#34; I expect your reply<lb/> as soon as possible that some good has been effected by your <hi rend="underline">party</hi><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add></p>
