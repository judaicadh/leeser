				<p rend="align(center)"><placeName>Palestine</placeName>.</p>
				<p>Writer in the <add>&#63;</add> whether sought for in the <sic>marvellous</sic><lb/> or in natural causes the fact is undoubted that <placeName>Palestine</placeName> has ever been<lb/> that and of affection to all believers in the Bible.  The <del>Monkes</del> Mohamedan<lb/> has his Al&#45;Charria<add>&#63;</add>&#44; the Christian possess their various churches &#38;<lb/> shrines&#59; and they all <add>&#63;</add> less than us attach the highest earthly society<lb/> to the spots consecrated by the remarkable <add>&#63;</add> of patriarchal &#38; biblical<lb/> history.  It may be a fanatical error as some would <sic>characterise</sic> it<lb/> for Jews to cluster round those places where where formerly they were the<lb/> lords<add>&#63;</add> but no little better than slaves and beggars and subject to our<lb/> bearing and tyrannical master.  But so they have been from the<lb/> day the temple fell a sacrifice to the flames whether the <add>&#63;</add> were<lb/> the Romans&#44; the Arabs&#44; the crusaders&#44; the Egyptians&#44; or the Turks.<lb/>  At not time for eighteen centuries&#44; and were before the emblem of our<lb/> national glory fell&#44; were <add>&#63;</add> the norm than earlier on our own soil&#59;<lb/> still <placeName>Palestine</placeName> was the land of our hope&#44; the country of our desire.<lb/>  But let those who blame the deviant for this feeling tell us why<lb/> it should not be so&#63;  are we so well treated in more civilized countries&#63;<lb/>  are we so regarded as equals in many lands&#63;  How many <placeName>Americas</placeName><lb/> are there in the world&#63;  how many <placeName>Hollands</placeName>&#44; <placeName>Belgiums</placeName> &#38; <placeName>France</placeName>&#63;<lb/>  Tell us where are all the liberties which our du<add>&#63;</add> of a <add>&#63;</add><lb/> have obtained in <placeName>Germany</placeName>&#44; <add>&#63;</add>&#44; <placeName>Hungary</placeName> &#38; <placeName>Poland</placeName>&#63;  Where&#63; Dissipated<lb/> to the <add>&#63;</add> and <add>&#63;</add>&#59; and the partial light which dawned six years<lb/> ago&#44; and which <add>&#63;</add> to be the harbinger of a brighter day&#44; has<lb/> left us in greater obscurity and the loosening of the chains of political<lb/> and religious slavery&#44; has caused us to feel the lightening of the <add>&#63;</add> with</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>a thousandfold redoubled painlessness&#44; for dreamers&#44; where is your<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> reign&#63;  where is your universal <add>&#63;</add>&#63;  where the <add>&#63;</add><lb/> I am of the Lamb and the wolf together&#63;  The wars of oppression against<lb/> freedom still continue&#44; and the wolf yet <add>&#63;</add> his teeth against<lb/> the unoffending lamb that is unable to have his prey.  Letting go where<lb/> we will&#44; <add>&#63;</add> countries where there live in all less than a half a<lb/> million of our brethren&#44; the body of political slavery and degre&#45;<lb/>dation is still ours&#44; as are yet excluded from all places of profit<lb/> and preferment&#59; and even the eight<add>&#63;</add> to a share in the possession of<lb/> the lands of <add>&#63;</add> is denied us in many lands.  Oh&#33;  what a<lb/> freedom this is&#33;  What a state that is to satisfy the longing of the<lb/> Jewish patriot for happier days for a time when the land of<lb/> <placeName>Israel</placeName> is again to be ours&#44; to be occupied by sons of freedom and industry&#44;<lb/> sitting each under his own vine<add>&#63;</add> and each his own fig tree with<lb/> none to make him afraid.  Whatever others may do&#44; we do not blame<lb/> the oppressed&#44; not even the free&#44; in all lands who look toward their<lb/> ancestral<add>&#63;</add> home or the true country of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; where the<lb/> religion promulgated through <persName>Moses</persName> is ultimately to stand proud<add>&#63;</add><lb/> on the light and life of the world&#44; guiding all mankind to universal<lb/> freedom&#44; teaching them all a perfect&#44; pure&#44; un<add>&#63;</add> faith&#44; and<lb/> alone undying in the spirit&#44; for the Creator of all things.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#39;Hence we say&#44; could a numerous agricultural population<add>&#63;</add><lb/> be drawn <del>toward</del> to <placeName>Palestine</placeName>&#44; we should not only contribute to towards<lb/> the permanent relief of these residing there already&#44; but we should<lb/> open an <add>&#63;</add> for many who now know of <add>&#63;</add> only as<lb/> a <add>&#63;</add>ionary and received a sacrifice as <add>&#63;</add> them out on tranquil<lb/> days&#44; of which they and their father&#44; before them have <add>&#63;</add> the true<lb/> signification.  If it could be accomplished&#44; that the <add>&#63;</add> of men<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> Israelites of <placeName>Poland</placeName>&#44; <placeName>Russia</placeName>&#44; <add>&#63;</add> and <placeName>Hungary</placeName> &#38; <placeName>Turkey</placeName></p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>should be planted in agricultural colonies in the callings of the land<lb/> of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; under the protection of the present energetic <persName>Sultan Abdul<lb/> Medjed<add>&#63;</add></persName> with full liberty to organize municipal corporations&#44;<lb/> permitted to bear arms and fully empowered to use of them<lb/> in case of an attack from without&#59; we should do much to<lb/> ameliorate the abject condition of European communities who<lb/> now are daily exposed to insult and <add>&#63;</add> of their arrogant<lb/> and proud oppressors.  If his home should become intolerable to<lb/> an Israelite&#44; he would know whether he could resort and<lb/> find the means of self support without the danger of being led away<lb/> from the path of duty&#44; which now alas&#33; is too often the case with those<lb/> who go to <placeName>England</placeName>&#44; <placeName>France</placeName>&#44; <placeName>America</placeName><add>&#63;</add> from other countries<lb/> simply to follow the only pursuit which seems to promise them<lb/> a speedy return&#44; <add>&#63;</add> trading in one of its many <del> <add>&#63;</add> </del><lb/> shapes&#44; all other employments being inacceptable to a stranger<lb/> who is unacquainted with the language &#38; customs of the lands<lb/> he just arrives in.  But now <placeName>Palestine</placeName> once open to receive Jewish<lb/> immigrants&#59; <del>where</del> were its agricultural wealth once more acceptable<lb/> to our faith&#59; <del>wh</del> were its fields once more fertile and its cities<lb/> rebuilt anew&#58; not alone that many could unite themselves<lb/> to its inhabitants to cultivate the soil&#44; sure of a speedy and rich<lb/> return for their labors&#59; but then who have the genius and lust<lb/> for business could carry on profitable commerce with all<lb/> parts of the world in exchange for the varied products of the<lb/> fields and vineyards&#44; and perhaps the many rich muses<add>&#63;</add> of resonan<lb/>ce which now lie unused and unknown&#44; <del>with</del> against <add>&#63;</add><lb/> is raised from the soil and <add>&#63;</add> skill and labors<lb/> in every other country.  This is no mere dream&#44; the realization<lb/> of what is beyond the range of possibility&#59; but the same spectacle</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>was witnessed in ancient times when the <add>&#63;</add> of<lb/> <placeName>Giza</placeName> &#38; <persName>Gideon</persName> contained the commerce of the world&#59; when<lb/> <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> was filled with the wares of all climes and when<lb/> prosperity and elegance smiled in every city o the prosperous<lb/> commonwealth.  If we revert to the description of <persName>Jacob</persName> and <persName>Ezekiel</persName><lb/> of the prosperity and elegance of <add>&#63;</add> and Jews alone we may indeed wonder at<lb/> the awful desolation which now presides over them &#38; <add>&#63;</add> of<lb/> musical <add>&#63;</add> &#38; refreshment&#59; but at the time it leads us to the<lb/> condition that under similar circumstances similar results<lb/> may be <add>&#63;</add> at some future&#44; if ever distant&#44; day.  If the<lb/> weak places should be built up&#59; if the broken <add>&#63;</add> should<lb/> be repaired&#59; if the now dry aqueducts should be restored&#59; if the<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> of the inhabitants should be converted into thrift<lb/> and industry&#59; it cannot be otherwise than that the articles of<lb/> import would be multiplied beyond calculation.  The <add>&#63;</add><lb/> in the wilderness of <placeName>Syria</placeName> and <placeName>Judea</placeName> would afford food for<lb/> millions of sheep&#44; whose fleece could readily rival and<lb/> exist perhaps under that happy sky&#44; <add>&#63;</add>&#44; serenity<lb/> on that eastern fairyland&#44; the best mariners of <placeName>Spain</placeName> and<lb/> <placeName>Saxony</placeName>&#59; that <add>&#63;</add> could readily be made to wear on his<lb/> shroud of the purest fibre after being abundantly fed till the<lb/> day of his <add>&#63;</add> with the healthful <add>&#63;</add> of the whole<lb/> mulberry which would grow there in abundance <add>&#63;</add> the<lb/> commonest care be taken&#59; the bulk of the worth could yield<lb/> abundant supply of the purest olive oil&#44; for a <add>&#63;</add> they were<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> from us&#59; the <add>&#63;</add> of <persName>Judah</persName> would again<lb/> be laden with the fruit of the vine&#44; and the valleys of <placeName>Jezreal</placeName><lb/> and <placeName>Sharon</placeName>&#44; and <placeName>Carmel</placeName> &#38; <placeName>Tabor</placeName>&#44; and the plains of <placeName>Jericho</placeName><lb/> &#38; of the <placeName>Great Sea</placeName> would again be <del>bad</del> <add>&#63;</add>dened with the</p>
			<pb n="5"/>
				<p>immense harvests&#44; the hundredfold yield&#44; which <add>&#63;</add><lb/> <add>&#63;</add> them.  Cotton too&#44; and hemp&#44; and fruit of various<lb/> kinds&#44; the Indian corn&#44; the potato&#44; the yam&#44; the banana&#44;<lb/> and other products anciently unknown in <placeName>Palestine</placeName> could be readily intro&#45;<lb/>duced and yield their increase in unexampled plenty&#44; if the<lb/> labourers were used there to prepare the soil for their reception.<lb/>  And can it be doubted that so many articles what in their<lb/> raw or manufactures state would feed<add>&#63;</add> a ready demand in other<lb/> countries&#44; <add>&#63;</add> not soon enrich their producers&#44; and<lb/> elevate them&#44; as successful commerce always does&#44; to a<lb/> high state of refinement and elegance&#63;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The ruinous cities would soon be rebuilt&#59; the books<lb/> of the timid billers of tillers of the soil who now fear&#44; to work diseasing<lb/> the assault of the maraud<add>&#63;</add> <add>&#63;</add>&#44; would soon make place<lb/> for <del>the</del> compatible farm&#45;<add>&#63;</add>&#59; the pastures now desolate<lb/> would resound with the bells of the returning flocks and hearts<lb/> <del>at evening</del> led <del>forth</del> home by the little and gay shepherds&#44; as<lb/> in ancient times&#59; the parts which are now rarely visited by the<lb/> ships of foreign nations&#44; because there is so little for them to<lb/> carry away would soon be filled with vessels displaying the<lb/> flag of every country&#59; and the roads on which now painfully<add>&#63;</add><lb/> <add>&#63;</add> the camel of the caravan in its slow progress&#44; would<lb/> be made noiseful by the thundering steam car in its impa<lb/>tient <add>&#63;</add> to reach the place of its destination&#59; and<lb/> all because industry once more <del>should</del> would have breathed life<lb/> &#38; vigour into the listless indolent <del> <add>&#63;</add> </del> few that now vegetate<lb/> not live&#44; starve and not enjoy life in a land which formerly<lb/> nourished the millions of men and cattle&#44; and now produces<lb/> scarcely enough to feed its <del>remnants</del> handful of persons coming as they have</p>
			<pb n="6"/>
				<p>done from many climes without concert of action without any cohesion<lb/> or unity of purpose.  The Turks are merely the rulers&#44; and are not&#44; we<lb/> should judge our <add>&#63;</add> the Arabs are too indolent to make good<lb/> farmers&#44; and totally unacquainted with the improved state of European<lb/> agriculture&#44; or are given to <add>&#63;</add> and <add>&#63;</add> true to their ancient<lb/> national character so that from the <add>&#63;</add> population not<lb/> much can be expected&#44; unless they ref<add>&#63;</add> their customs altogether<lb/> which is not likely to take place in centuries to come&#44; unless some<lb/> now <add>&#63;</add> revolution should compel them thereto.  The Christian<lb/> inhabitants are not many&#44; and being either <sic>mountaineous</sic>&#44; who have<add>&#63;</add><lb/> isolated from civilization or <add>&#63;</add> and connected with monastic and<lb/> other religious establishments&#59; if we have understood correctly the<lb/> accounts of <sic>travellers</sic>&#44; are not likely to contribute much to<lb/> the improvement of the land.  The Jewish population&#44; which may<lb/> reach twenty thousand in all is too few&#44; and for that matter<lb/> too ignorant of manual labors to do any thing for their own<lb/> advancement.  Is it therefore wonderful that <placeName>Palestine</placeName> presents<lb/> to the eye of the stranger so little of what is <add>&#63;</add>&#44; and im<lb/>measurate with the description which we have received of its<lb/> former popul<add>&#63;</add>ness and magnificence&#63;  Nay it is at most<lb/> a wonder that a vestige has been left&#44; after all the battles<lb/> and earthquakes and other causes of desolation&#44; to show<lb/> that <placeName><sic>Baalbec</sic></placeName>&#44; and <add>&#63;</add> and <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> were at one<lb/> time such cities as but few of modern times can com&#45;<lb/>pare with&#59; and if something is not done to restore them the<lb/> few fragments of ancient days must crumble away in the<lb/> cause of coming generations and leave not a wreck behind.<lb/>  If therefore a new life could be infused in <placeName>Palestine</placeName>&#59; if a new population<lb/> industrious and inured to toil could be gradually infused on the stagnant</p>
			<pb n="7"/>
				<p>masses which now encumber its surface&#44; there can be no question<lb/> but that proportionate good results would be speedily brought to view&#59; for<lb/> the indolent&#44; seeing the superior advantage of industry&#44; the happy affects<lb/> of independence through labour&#44; would naturally be <add>&#63;</add> either to<lb/> the village of the soil or to the mechanical pursuits required<lb/> to supply the many wants of a farming population.  This again<lb/> would react or commence&#44; goods from foreign lands would<lb/> have to be brought in to furnish the requirements for the work<lb/>ship&#44; the manufacturing and the <add>&#63;</add> of the table&#59; and this would<lb/> again be the <add>&#63;</add>runner of internal improvements&#44; by high ways<lb/> canals and rail roads&#44; to bring the fruits of <add>&#63;</add><lb/> the reach of our <add>&#63;</add> and to enable to producers<add>&#63;</add> to dispose of<lb/> his surplus where it is needed.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">There is no conceivable reason why <placeName>Palestine</placeName> &#38; <placeName>Asia Minor</placeName><lb/> should be given over to sterility and <sic>disolution</sic> when in former<lb/> ages they were not alone the misery of mankind&#44; but the seat<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> knowledge and religion were scattered all over the<lb/> earth.  <placeName>Egypt</placeName> may have been the home of early architecture and the<lb/> priests who guarded a secret knowledge of a purer <add>&#63;</add> of by<lb/> than the majority of the people possessed&#59; but it was nevertheless<lb/> from the inhabitants of the first mentioned lands that the religions<lb/> which now govern the world were derived&#59; and through them taught<lb/> at first in Arabic <del>and <persName>Mohamed</persName> was a rather of the same land</del><lb/> it was only from <placeName>Palestine</placeName> that his system advanced under various<lb/> guises as the conquering system&#44; destined to ever <add>&#63;</add> others in<lb/> to <add>&#63;</add>less <add>&#63;</add> to universal dimension.  Fine P<add>&#63;</add><lb/> too&#44; it is assisted&#44; that the system of alphabetical writing was<lb/> first carried into eastern <placeName>Europe</placeName>&#44; and <add>&#63;</add> is in result a higher<lb/> philosophy notwithstanding the corruption of the Greek &#38; Romans</p>

				<p>than was known among them before that time&#44; and savage<lb/> lords were thereby connected into elegant and refined communi<lb/>ties.  And shall it be so forever that all their lands shall<lb/> be only desolate and without the foot of man and beast to<lb/> pass through them&#63;  It is true that the Scriptures have recorded<lb/> a fearful <add>&#63;</add> over the lands of these who relying on their<lb/> strength and wisdom <add>&#63;</add> of the law of God<lb/> and walked after their imaginations of their own &#38; unbridled<lb/> heart.  But it is likewise true that the same authority<lb/> promises consolation and a restoring of the ancient glory&#59; and the<lb/> only question is how this is to be accomplished.  We will not at pre&#45;<lb/>sent enter into a reception of the prophecies bearing on this topic&#59;<lb/> nor investigate how far we should rely on a sudden development<lb/> of the divine policy which is to affect the great and <add>&#63;</add> predictions<lb/> of <placeName>Israels</placeName> sun&#59; but it surely cannot be wrong for us to endeav&#45;<lb/>our to promote the happy future by some exertions of my own.<lb/>  It may be that all efforts will be in vain&#59; it is possible that<lb/> a curse doth rest on the land which it is not yet the time to<lb/> have removed&#59; it is possible enough that the <hi rend="underline">man</hi> is yet wanted<lb/> who could be a leader in this blissful regeneration.  Still we think<lb/> that it is worthwhile to make an effort to aid our brothers <add>&#63;</add><lb/><add>&#63;</add> on the spot with the means to <del>make our effort not</del> realize our self ameliora<lb/>tion which they are now anxious to effect&#44; bring sick at heart<lb/> of the life of paupers&#59; <add>&#63;</add> which is a never ending always recom<lb/>mencing service of <add>&#63;</add>&#44; &#38; is indeed a pity that hitherto the<lb/> very love for our religion has been made the moving principle<lb/> of fastening <add>&#63;</add> on the land of <placeName>Israel</placeName>.  &#8220;To offer for the love of<lb/> the <placeName>holy land</placeName> &#8220;was and is considered highly meritorious&#59; to main<lb/>tain a deed <add>&#63;</add> praiseworthy and salutory&#59; whereas all<lb/> this must only <sic>perpetiate</sic> the <add>&#63;</add> which the pious thought they</p>
