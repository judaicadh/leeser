            <p rend="indent(1)">Enclosed is a sermon&#44; printed in a newspaper&#44;<lb/> which <persName>Dr.
                    Wise</persName> in <placeName>Albany</placeName> gave at the dedication of

                &#40;Reformen&#41; in the above&#8211;mentioned synagogue are as follows&#58;<lb/>

                &#40;6&#41; Each<lb/> family has its seat where husband&#44; wife and children

                Saturday&#40;&#58;&#41; for the congregation &#40;dem<lb/> Volke&#41;. Particularly
                because in ancient days each synagogue<lb/> had a M&#39;turgeman this particular

            <p rend="indent(1)">You have probably heard already of the divorce affair<lb/> which happened in the old
                congregation Anshe Chesed. There a<lb/> grocer&#44; a cigarmaker and a peddler
                &#40;Pedler&#41; constituted a<lb/>
                <sic>a</sic> Rabbinical Council&#40;Rabbinercollegium&#41; with the grocer the<lb/>
                Chiefrabbi. <sic>Ofcourse</sic>&#44; I declared the get&#44; issued by such
                un&#8211;<lb/>authorized people&#44; null and void in the local newspaper.
                How&#8211;<lb/>ever&#44; I wanted to point out to the Editor of the Asmonean<lb/>
                that even in a &#8220;horse and buggy&#8221; town &#40;Winkelstadt&#41; &#40;as
                he<lb/> called <placeName>Cleveland</placeName>&#41; a theologian exists who
                can&#44; if necessary&#44;<lb/> compose and <del>and</del> issue a get casher.
                Altogether I am amazed<lb/> at his logic &#40;logische Denkkraft&#41;&#44; his
                conclusion that&#44; if in<lb/> a city as big as <placeName>New York</placeName>
                there rarely can be found somebody<lb/> who could issue a get&#44; there could
                hardly be a man in a<lb/> relatively <sic>smallcity</sic> like
                    <placeName>Cleveland</placeName> who could give a get<lb/> casher. First of
                all&#44; I must point out that it is not lots<lb/> of houses&#44; publications
                &#40;&#63;&#41; and people or a large salary<lb/> which make a man a theologian&#44;
                and that fate could also<lb/> bring a scholarly and talmudically educated theologian
                to a<lb/> small city and a small congregation. It is fortunate that the<lb/> Editor
                of the Asmonean did not live in the times of the famous<lb/> astronomer
                    <persName>Copernicus</persName> who lived in the small town of
                    <placeName>Thorn</placeName><lb/> in <placeName>Prussia</placeName>. The Editor
                would undoubtedly have questioned<lb/>
                <persName>Copernicus&#39;</persName> existence. Indeed according to his
                conclusion&#44; we<lb/> should doubt the existence of all competent scholars who
                ever<lb/> lived and still live in small towns. Not a mass of people and<lb/> houses
                but the sum of talmudic knowledge and scholarship elevate</p>

                However anybody who is&#44; if only<lb/> in a limited way&#44; familiar with the
