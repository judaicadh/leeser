            <p rend="align(right)"><placeName>Cleveland, O</placeName>. <date>28 th Nov. 5612

            <p>Honored Friend and Patron:</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Enclosed is a sermon, printed in a newspaper,<lb/> which
                    <persName>Dr. Wise</persName> in <placeName>Albany</placeName> gave at the
                dedication of the<lb/> new synagogue there with the request (Ersuchen) to
                publish<lb/> the same (aufnehmen zu wollen) in the Occident. The changes<lb/>
                (Reformen) in the above–mentioned synagogue are as follows:<lb/> (1) an organ, (2)
                the cantor stands with his face to the <sic>con–<lb/>gragation</sic>(zum Volke), (3)
                the Piutim are abolished and the<lb/> T'FILLAH is abbreviated, (4) all singing is
                done from ?<lb/> and the cantor reads the prayers in a declamatory fashion<lb/>
                (Ton), (5) the Torah is read without Nigunim, (6) Each<lb/> family has its seat
                where husband, wife and children sit<lb/> together. The congregation has 81 members
                and is flourishing<lb/> beautifully (ist im schoensten Aufbluehen). <persName>Dr.
                    Lilienthal</persName><lb/> aus <placeName>New York</placeName> gave the
                conclusion and the benediction which,<lb/> as I was told, was very successful (?).
                The above–mentioned<lb/> changes (Reformen) (of the ....?) the most useful would,
                in<lb/> my opinion, have been if one also at the same time would<lb/> have explained
                or at least translated a portion of the<lb/> Tora which is read each Saturday(:) for
                the congregation (dem<lb/> Volke). Particularly because in ancient days each
                synagogue<lb/> had a M'turgeman this particular change (Reform) would be<lb/> the
                least objectionable (koennte am allerwenigsten angestastet<lb/> werden).</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p rend="indent(1)">You have probably heard already of the divorce affair<lb/> which
                happened in the old congregation Anshe Chesed. There a<lb/> grocer, a cigarmaker and
                a peddler (Pedler) constituted a<lb/>
                <sic>a</sic> Rabbinical Council(Rabbinercollegium) with the grocer the<lb/>
                Chiefrabbi. <sic>Ofcourse</sic>, I declared the get, issued by such
                un–<lb/>authorized people, null and void in the local newspaper. How–<lb/>ever, I
                wanted to point out to the Editor of the Asmonean<lb/> that even in a “horse and
                buggy” town (Winkelstadt) (as he<lb/> called <placeName>Cleveland</placeName>) a
                theologian exists who can, if necessary,<lb/> compose and <del>and</del> issue a get
                casher. Altogether I am amazed<lb/> at his logic (logische Denkkraft), his
                conclusion that, if in<lb/> a city as big as <placeName>New York</placeName> there
                rarely can be found somebody<lb/> who could issue a get, there could hardly be a man
                in a<lb/> relatively <sic>smallcity</sic> like <placeName>Cleveland</placeName> who
                could give a get<lb/> casher. First of all, I must point out that it is not
                lots<lb/> of houses, publications (?) and people or a large salary<lb/> which make a
                man a theologian, and that fate could also<lb/> bring a scholarly and talmudically
                educated theologian to a<lb/> small city and a small congregation. It is fortunate
                that the<lb/> Editor of the Asmonean did not live in the times of the famous<lb/>
                astronomer <persName>Copernicus</persName> who lived in the small town of
                    <placeName>Thorn</placeName><lb/> in <placeName>Prussia</placeName>. The Editor
                would undoubtedly have questioned<lb/>
                <persName>Copernicus'</persName> existence. Indeed according to his conclusion,
                we<lb/> should doubt the existence of all competent scholars who ever<lb/> lived and
                still live in small towns. Not a mass of people and<lb/> houses but the sum of
                talmudic knowledge and scholarship elevate</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>to the rank of Rabbi or Chiefrabbi. Admittedly, the people<lb/> in the old
