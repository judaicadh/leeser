            <p rend="indent(1)">Sunday schools are nothing new among our Christian neighbours,<lb/>
                as many sects of them have had such establishments for shorter or<lb/> longer
                periods. Among our people, however, the case is very dif-<lb/>ferent, as far as the
                knowledge of the writer extends; and only at<lb/>
                <placeName>Richmond, Va.</placeName>, had the attempt been made, with but partial
                success,<lb/> by the late <persName>Isaac B. Seixas</persName>, (then minister of
                that congregation, and<lb/> since then of the synagogue <hi rend="italics">Sheerith
                    Israel</hi>, at <placeName>New York</placeName>,) and the<lb/> writer of this
                memorial, before several of our ladies, feeling that some-<lb/>thing might and
                should be done to improve the religious character of<lb/> the Jewish children, and
                to give them at least an elementary and<lb/> comprehensive idea of their duties,
                resolved on founding a school<lb/> for the promulgation of religious knowledge on
                the first day of the<lb/> week, it being a general day of leisure, and as it could
                be devoted to<lb/> this pious object without interfering with the exercises of
                other<lb/> schools, and the avocations of the teachers. This plan, which
                pro-<lb/>mised to be so beneficial, soon found many willing to co-operate; and<lb/>
                the zeal of the teachers, was seconded by the eagerness of the children<lb/> to
                avail themselves of the opportunity to acquire a knowledge of their<lb/> religion.
                The school was at first commenced under the patronage<lb/> of the Female Hebrew
                Benevolent Society of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>; but un-<lb/>less he errs,
                the writer thinks that it never had to depend for support<lb/> upon that excellent
                charity, as from the outset donations were<lb/> freely offered for the furtherance
                of this blessed undertaking.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The first assemblage of the scholars took place at the house
                    <placeName>No. 97,<lb/> Walnut <sic>street</sic></placeName>; but when the
                ladies had to give up the room they<lb/> there occupied, the Franklin Institute,
                with a commendable spirit of<lb/> liberality, permitted them to take possession of a
                spacious apartment</p>
            <pb n="6"/>
            <p>6</p>
            <p rend="align(center)">MEMORIAL.</p>
            <p>in the old Masonic Hall, in <placeName>Chestnut <sic>street</sic></placeName>, where
                the weekly meet-<lb/>ings have taken place now for more than eighteen months.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">As may easily be imagined, some prejudice was at first
                manifested<lb/> by various persons, who fancied that they discovered an
                objectionable<lb/> imitation of gentile practices in this undertaking, forgetting
                that it is<lb/> the first duty of <placeName>Israel</placeName> to <sic>instil</sic>
                knowledge of divine things in the hearts<lb/> of the young, and this institution was
                eminently calculated to bestow<lb/> this necessary blessing alike upon rich and poor
                without fee or price.<lb/> It is but seldom that so noble an aim has been sought
                after, begun<lb/> solely for the glorification of our Maker and the well-being of
                his<lb/> people; it is therefore gratifying to record, that this unfounded
                preju-<lb/>dice has nearly died away, and one cannot give a better evidence of<lb/>
                the fact, than that now fully one hundred children are enrolled, and<lb/> what is
                more, that nearly all attend whenever the weather is at all<lb/> favourable, and
                this despite the great distance which many of the<lb/> scholars and teachers have to
                walk, living as they do in almost every<lb/> part of the city and suburbs.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Another great difficulty, and one far more formidable, was the<lb/>
                scarcity of suitable books to be placed in the hands of scholars, since<lb/> those
                published by the American Sunday School Union, although<lb/> admirably written, and
                having a powerful tendency to impress the<lb/> minds of children, contain so much
                matter of a sectarian nature as<lb/> must almost banish them from a Jewish school,
                where it is of import-<lb/>ance to inculcate those principles which are the
                foundation of our reli-<lb/>gion. The only other books within our reach were the
                Elements of<lb/> the Jewish Faith, by <persName>Rabbi S. Cohen</persName>, and the
                Instruction in the<lb/> Mosaic Religion, arranged from the German of
                    <persName>Johlson</persName>, by the writer<lb/> of this. In this emergency the
                Child's Bible Questions, by the A. S.<lb/> S. Union, was of necessity but partially
                adopted, there not being a<lb/> similar book and one more free from sectarian matter
                at hand; but it<lb/> is pleasing to remark, that an adaptation of this little work
                after our<lb/> own manner is now in the hands of a young lady of this place,
                and<lb/> will, it is hoped, see the light soon, and this with the consent of
                the<lb/> A. S. S. Union, who have waived their copyright in our favour; this,<lb/>
                too, is a highly gratifying fact, and it speaks loudly and emphatically<lb/> of the
                enlightened views of the board of publication of that powerful<lb/> institution, and
                especially of the kindness of <persName>John Hall, Esq.</persName>, through<lb/>
                whom this polite offer has been conveyed.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Last spring the first anniversary examination took place. The
                day<lb/> fixed upon was one of anxiety to many a little heart; and fathers and<lb/>
                mothers too, looked forward with some thrill of hope and fear to the<lb/> probation
                of their children. It need not be told, that the exercises<lb/> were highly
                pleasing, and the liberal contributions, which were volun-</p>

            <p rend="align(center)">MEMORIAL.</p>
            <p>tarily made without any solicitation, proved more clearly than words,<lb/> how
                pleasing an object our brethren had witnessed that day.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">In the mean while the example set in this city was followed in
                    <placeName>New<lb/> York</placeName> and <placeName>Charleston</placeName> about
                the same time; and there, as well as here,<lb/> the superintendence and teaching are
                in the hands of the ladies. The<lb/> endowment, likewise, in both places, has been
                quite liberal; and there<lb/> can be but little doubt, that the commencement so
                happily made, will<lb/> not fail to produce all the good results which could
                reasonably be<lb/> expected. It is manifest, however, that such imitation abroad
                could<lb/> not do otherwise than stimulate to perseverance the first authors of<lb/>
                this good; and they have not disappointed the hopes formed of them.<lb/> They have
                gone on improving their charges by careful training, and<lb/> these have for the
                most part proved by an acquisition of knowledge<lb/> and more correct deportment,
                especially at public worship, that the<lb/> labour bestowed upon them has been well
                bestowed.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The increasing demand for religious information induced the
                writer,<lb/> immediately after the above examination, to finish and to commit
                to<lb/> the press the Catechism for Younger Children; and he mentions it<lb/> with
                sincere gratitude that it has already been introduced in the three<lb/> Sunday
                schools mentioned above, in several private institutions, and<lb/> for family
                reading; it was more than he could have expected within<lb/> nine months after its
                appearance: especially since he had so often<lb/> claimed the support of his
                fellow-Israelites in his former publications.<lb/> Yet he says it without
                affectation, that his issuing the two school-<lb/>books, already mentioned, appeared
                to him like the launching of a<lb/> frail bark upon a stormy sea; but the
                promptitude with which many<lb/> of the answers were given by the scholars in their
                examination on<lb/> yesterday, has inspired him with the hope that the frail bark
                may be<lb/> made instrumental in bearing some devoted spirit to the haven of<lb/>
                righteousness by the blessing of Him who imparteth knowledge, and<lb/> giveth to man
                wisdom and understanding.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">It was yesterday that the second examination of the scholars of
                this<lb/> nursery of piety took place: it was natural to expect some
                improve-<lb/>ment upon the progress of last year, but the result far surpassed
                the<lb/> most sanguine expectations. The northern half of the ground-floor of<lb/>
                the synagogue was reserved for the scholars, each class headed by its<lb/> teacher;
                and the steps leading to the ark were occupied by the<lb/> youngest class, and
                certainly formed a collection of happy faces,<lb/> which no one could look on
                without pleasure; and these little ones,<lb/> when called upon to answer their
                Bible-questions, acquitted themselves<lb/> in a manner highly gratifying to their
                parents and creditable to their<lb/> youthful teacher. The other classes, as they
                were called upon in suc-<lb/>cession, also showed that much care had been profitably
                bestowed;</p>

            <p>but it would be invidious to mention particulars where the whole was<lb/> so
                satisfactory. The writer knows not how others felt, but he can<lb/> truly say that
                he felt rejoiced and gratified; and to judge from the<lb/> countenance of the many
                that thronged the place of worship, he may<lb/> freely affirm, that never a public
                exhibition left more favourable<lb/> impressions upon the hearers, and that the
                words of congratulation<lb/> every where uttered must have sprung from hearts
                convinced that a<lb/> good work had been done in <placeName>Israel</placeName>.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">We were lately gratified by the arrival among us of the <persName
                    role="author">Rev.<lb/> Moses N. Nathan</persName>, Minister of the German

                who visits this country in quest of a<lb/> renewal of his own health and that of his
                amiable companion. As the<lb/> annual examination was so near at hand, <persName
                    role="author">Mr. N.</persName> was invited to ad-<lb/>dress the congregation at

                his wife. He has conferred an additional favour by per-<lb/>mitting us to have his

                long remembered after this interesting<lb/> stranger shall have been restored to his
                home and station.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">It only remains to be added, that at the conclusion of the

                unto<lb/> our forefathers in the days of yore, when they beheld<lb/> thy glory, saw
                thy fire, and heard thy voice. How shall<lb/> we thank thee? how shall we praise
                thee, for this boon<lb/> which thou didst so graciously bestow on us, by which<lb/>

                civilization and enlightenment ever follow in its steps,<lb/> and are its unfailing
                concomitants. Every Hebrew who<lb/> reverences and adores the Author and Bestower of

                overshadowing us, have disappeared<lb/> before the effacing touch of time; others
                have been<lb/> modified and changed, scarcely retaining a vestige of<lb/> their
                original character, whilst we remain, sobered in-<lb/>deed in our tints, mellowed by
                age; but exhibiting the<lb/> same outline, the same proportions, the same
                freshness,<lb/> though attempts have incessantly been made violently<lb/> to deface
                and alter the strong lineaments and features,<lb/> first impressed on us by the

                our holy books, they were stained with none of the<lb/> crimes which abound in the
                annals of nations enriched<lb/> by the labours and researches of philosophy, but
                who<lb/> knew not God. In recent times, when a miscalled<lb/> philosophy reigned
                triumphant, innumerable were the<lb/> victims which it immolated at its shrine; but
                virtue and<lb/> knowledge had fled, for the volume which inculcated<lb/> their
                principles was scorned and contemned. Well<lb/> may the believer ask, what have the
                sayings and pre-<lb/>cepts of the most eminent sages availed, where this book<lb/>
                was unknown? It alone teaches the true economy of<lb/> life and social happiness;
                and what are wisdom, riches,<lb/> and power, unless accompanied by the vivifying,
                the<lb/> enlightening spirit of the fear of God, the beginning of<lb/> knowledge?
                Our origin, our nature, our weaknesses, and<lb/> our dependence, are shown in its
                luminous pages; and<lb/> is it not equally communicative of our Creator, our<lb/>
                duties, our power, and our hopes of that heaven,<lb/> “where the wicked cease from
                troubling, and where<lb/> the weary are at rest?”</p>

            <p rend="indent(1)">“Grace is deceptive, and beauty fleeting, the woman<lb/> who feareth
                the Lord she shall be praised.” The fear<lb/> of God is the first lesson which the
                lisping mouth of<lb/> infancy should be taught to pronounce, that it may be<lb/>
                indelibly <sic>engraven</sic> on the heart of youth, sway the ac-<lb/>tions and
                guide the understanding of the man, and<lb/> make him in old age cling to the ways
                of righteousness,<lb/> piety and faithfulness, following the path which the<lb/>
                pillar of cloud indicated, and that of fire illumined.<lb/> And to whom ought the
                charge be confided of first in-<lb/>stilling this primary principle? to woman, to
                the tender<lb/> nurse, the affectionate, the anxious mother, the kind and<lb/>
                <sic>sympathising</sic> friend, in whose bosom the prattling child<lb/> nestles, and
                whither it flies in danger and distress. Her<lb/> mildness and gentleness are
                designed by Providence to<lb/> imprint the first lessons of love, life, and light;
                to raise<lb/> the little hands in humble prayer and thanksgiving to<lb/> the
                heavenly Father, who rejoiceth when we are con-<lb/>tent, happy, and thankful, and
                regard Him as our gra-<lb/>cious Benefactor and kind Protector. For if man has<lb/>
                even the inclination, he has not the time or patience to<lb/> undertake this
                obligatory duty. In founding this excel-<lb/>lent establishment, the daughters of
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName> have entered<lb/> into the meaning and intention
                of Scripture; for the fear<lb/> of God being the beginning of wisdom, and hence,
                the<lb/> first thing to be instilled into the tender and ductile<lb/> mind of
                childhood, the task has been most correctly and<lb/> righteously assumed by those,
                to whose charge infancy<lb/> is confided, and by whom it is trained and

                the laxity and indifference so prevalent in our<lb/> societies, would be ascribed to
                the neglect of imparting<lb/> the words of holiness at an early age. We all know
                the<lb/> force of early impressions. Look at the history of our<lb/> people, exposed

            <p>may be assured of the hazard they incur by this culpa-<lb/>ble inattention to the
                eternal welfare of their children.<lb/> Do we not frequently witness departures from
                the body<lb/> of the nation? faith sacrificed at the shrine of passion,<lb/>
                —self-denial unknown and <sic>unpractised</sic>,—grief, sorrow,<lb/> and
                estrangement introduced into the bosom of families,<lb/> where before peace and
                affection dwelt,—and all mainly<lb/> attributable to parents who failed to
                communicate to<lb/> their offspring the lessons which they had received?<lb/> Mixed
                marriages too, where one of the parties, quietly,<lb/> ignobly, submits to, but
                refuses to subscribe to the popu-<lb/>lar faith? and what are the results? do not
                the offspring<lb/> of such unions deride the belief which either father or<lb/>
                mother has been criminal enough to abandon? But sup-<lb/>posing even that their
                desertion <hi rend="italics">is</hi> owing to conviction,<lb/> does it not
                invariably proceed from ignorance of the<lb/> tenets forsaken and renounced? And
                shall we hesitate to<lb/> remove this sin from among us, to efface the foul
                blot<lb/> of ignorance, and prevent any from straying out of the<lb/> pastures of
                the Lord? One of the most effectual methods<lb/> of doing it, is by the
                establishment of schools such as<lb/> the present. For if lamentable results, like
                those just<lb/> enumerated, have arisen from culpable neglect in the<lb/> days of
                youth, the never failing remedy of knowledge<lb/> will stop the contagion of evil
                example, render the hearts<lb/> of the wavering and unsteady stable and confident,
                and<lb/> enable them to cope with the sophistry, wherewith many<lb/> are now
                assailed and deluded.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The prospects of success shadowed forth by means of<lb/> religious
                knowledge, taught in this and similar schools,<lb/> may be deemed too glowing; if
                so, my impressions flow<lb/> not only from enthusiastic feeling, from the fervour
                of<lb/> zeal, not of fanaticism, in the cause of Judaism, but also<lb/> from strong
                and sincere conviction, and from that spirit<lb/> of patriotism which burns
                intensely, when the welfare of<lb/> our religion and its institutions is at stake.

                never<lb/> experienced defeat, who confidently relied on the out-<lb/>stretched arm
                by which he was redeemed from Egyp-<lb/>tian slavery, and not on the strength of the
                myriads he<lb/> commanded. (<persName>Joshua</persName> i. 7, 8.) “Be strong and

                maturity of strength, so that when trans-<lb/>planted, they may be ranked among the

            <p>ticular notice and commendation: it is the laudable<lb/> conduct of persons in a
                respectable condition of life not<lb/> preventing their children from mingling with
                the indi-<lb/>gent, and overcoming the too often predominant scru-<lb/>ples of silly
                pride and fear. This is a peculiar and<lb/> beautiful characteristic, one of the
                strongest supports,<lb/> one of the main pillars of the institution, and must<lb/>
                assuredly contribute to its prosperity and well-being.<lb/> In the ancient temple at
                    <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, the poor man's<lb/> handful of meal was as
                acceptable an offering as the<lb/> fatling of the rich; and the morning and evening
                sac-<lb/>rifices were supplied by the half shekels collected alike<lb/> from peasant
                and prince; for God would have equality in<lb/> His worship, and the adventitious
                claims to superiority<lb/> are disregarded by Him, who delights in the
                humility,<lb/> modesty, and lowliness of His servants, whom He loves<lb/> for their
                pious virtues, not for the number and value of<lb/> their burnt-offerings and
                libations. Whilst, therefore,<lb/> this principle of equality is persevered in and
                strictly<lb/> maintained, whilst “the rich and poor meet together,”<lb/> to learn
                and know that “the Eternal is the Maker of<lb/> them all,” the objects of this
                society will be attained;<lb/> and there will also exist such an endless desire,
                such a<lb/> perpetual yearning for instruction, that not one single<lb/> Jewish
                child shall remain ignorant of his Creator, his<lb/> duties, and his hopes of

            <p>whose roots are in all countries, against which the axe<lb/> and fire have been laid
                unavailingly, and which flou-<lb/>rishes and still yields abundant fruit,
                notwithstanding<lb/> its great age, and its exposure to rude assaults in
                ancient<lb/> and modern times. God regards you with especial<lb/> love, because you
                are shoots of this tree; do not therefore<lb/> seek to be separated from it, to join
                yourselves to others<lb/> of more stately appearance. Your future good, your<lb/>
                success, the integrity and uprightness of your life, de-<lb/>pend on the correct
                observance of those principles<lb/> which your kind and benevolent friends devote
                them-<lb/>selves to <sic>instil</sic> into your tender minds. Never forget<lb/>
                them; turn not to the right hand or to the left; but<lb/> walk in the laws of
                    <persName>Moses</persName>, and guide yourselves by<lb/> the directions and
                rules of the Old Testament. You<lb/> will be addressed when you are older, perhaps
                in your<lb/> early years, whilst yet you know not good from evil, in<lb/> the words
                of kindness, of piety, of solemn warning,<lb/> touching your religion; you will be
                asked to renounce<lb/> it, and told that our dispersed and unhappy state arises<lb/>
                from not believing in a mediator and saviour. Turn a<lb/> deaf ear to all such
                representations, and remain constant<lb/> to the precepts which have been given us
                as an inherit-<lb/>ance. Your Saviour and Redeemer is God the Creator<lb/> of heaven
                and earth; your Messiah, who will restore<lb/> the house of
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>, will be of flesh and blood like your-<lb/>selves,
                but wise, pure, and of great sanctity, to <sic>fulfil</sic><lb/> what the Almighty,
                the Father of all, has designed.<lb/> When you are in doubt, apply to your teachers,
                and<lb/> they will explain what is incomprehensible to your
                un-<lb/>derstandings,—and be assured that you will be happy,<lb/> prosperous, and
                pleasing in the sight of God and man,<lb/> while you bear in mind,
                    <sic>practise</sic>, and believe in the<lb/> inspired writings of
                    <persName>Moses</persName> and the prophets his suc-<lb/>cessors. Then will “the
                Eternal bless the works of<lb/> your hands;” ye will “die the death of the
                righteous;”</p>

            <p rend="indent(1)">Beloved brethren, offspring of <persName>Abraham</persName>, are ye
                not<lb/> anxious to see friendship, unanimity, and sincerity<lb/> reign amongst us
                and our descendants? Then train<lb/> your children to love that which is
                imperishable, to set<lb/> no more than its just value on that which departs
                more<lb/> quickly than the fleeting shadow. Bid them call dis-<lb/>cretion their
                friend, wisdom their sister, religion their<lb/> protecting guide. Train them to be
                upright in judg-<lb/>ment, in mind, in conduct, firm of character, immov-<lb/>able

                present or future, whether<lb/> in prosperity or adversity, life or death, they may
                never<lb/> separate themselves from the collective body. Let<lb/> such be the spirit
                of their mental culture, which will<lb/> give strength, and strength will give
                courage, to ani-<lb/>mate them in the struggles and vicissitudes of life,<lb/>
                assuring them of victory, whose beginning and end<lb/> spring from confidence in the
                sublime and exalted sen-<lb/>timent, “The Lord is with me, I will not fear,

                the holy work of instruction. Let the merits of our<lb/> ancestors, for our own are

                of thy<lb/> beloved servants, whom Thou didst promise ever to pro-<lb/>tect under
