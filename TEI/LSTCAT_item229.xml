			<p rend="indent(1)">Sunday schools are nothing new among our Christian neighbours&#44;<lb/> as many sects of them have had such establishments for shorter or<lb/> longer periods.  Among our people&#44; however&#44; the case is very dif&#45;<lb/>ferent&#44; as far as the knowledge of the writer extends&#59; and only at<lb/> <placeName>Richmond&#44; Va.</placeName>&#44; had the attempt been made&#44; with but partial success&#44;<lb/> by the late <persName>Isaac B. Seixas</persName>&#44; &#40;then minister of that congregation&#44; and<lb/> since then of the synagogue <hi rend="italics">Sheerith Israel</hi>&#44; at <placeName>New York</placeName>&#44;&#41; and the<lb/> writer of this memorial&#44; before several of our ladies&#44; feeling that some&#45;<lb/>thing might and should be done to improve the religious character of<lb/> the Jewish children&#44; and to give them at least an elementary and<lb/> comprehensive idea of their duties&#44; resolved on founding a school<lb/> for the promulgation of religious knowledge on the first day of the<lb/> week&#44; it being a general day of leisure&#44; and as it could be devoted to<lb/> this pious object without interfering with the exercises of other<lb/> schools&#44; and the avocations of the teachers.  This plan&#44; which pro&#45;<lb/>mised to be so beneficial&#44; soon found many willing to co&#45;operate&#59; and<lb/> the zeal of the teachers&#44; was seconded by the eagerness of the children<lb/> to avail themselves of the opportunity to acquire a knowledge of their<lb/> religion.  The school was at first commenced under the patronage<lb/> of the Female Hebrew Benevolent Society of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>&#59; but un&#45;<lb/>less he errs&#44; the writer thinks that it never had to depend for support<lb/> upon that excellent charity&#44; as from the outset donations were<lb/> freely offered for the furtherance of this blessed undertaking.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The first assemblage of the scholars took place at the house <placeName>No. 97&#44;<lb/> Walnut <sic>street</sic></placeName>&#59; but when the ladies had to give up the room they<lb/> there occupied&#44; the Franklin Institute&#44; with a commendable spirit of<lb/> liberality&#44; permitted them to take possession of a spacious apartment</p>
			<pb n="6"/>
				<p>6</p>
				<p rend="align(center)">MEMORIAL.</p>
				<p>in the old Masonic Hall&#44; in <placeName>Chestnut <sic>street</sic></placeName>&#44; where the weekly meet&#45;<lb/>ings have taken place now for more than eighteen months.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">As  may easily be imagined&#44; some prejudice was at first manifested<lb/> by various persons&#44; who fancied that they discovered an objectionable<lb/> imitation of gentile practices in this undertaking&#44; forgetting that it is<lb/> the first duty of <placeName>Israel</placeName> to <sic>instil</sic> knowledge of divine things in the hearts<lb/> of the young&#44; and this institution was eminently calculated to bestow<lb/> this necessary blessing alike upon rich and poor without fee or price.<lb/>  It is but seldom that so noble an aim has been sought after&#44; begun<lb/> solely for the glorification of our Maker and the well&#45;being of his<lb/> people&#59; it is therefore gratifying to record&#44; that this unfounded preju&#45;<lb/>dice has nearly died away&#44; and one cannot give a better evidence of<lb/> the fact&#44; than that now fully one hundred children are enrolled&#44; and<lb/> what is more&#44; that nearly all attend whenever the weather is at all<lb/> favourable&#44; and this despite the great distance which many of the<lb/> scholars and teachers have to walk&#44; living as they do in almost every<lb/> part of the city and suburbs.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Another great difficulty&#44; and one far more formidable&#44; was the<lb/> scarcity of suitable books to be placed in the hands of scholars&#44; since<lb/> those published by the American Sunday School Union&#44; although<lb/> admirably written&#44; and having a powerful tendency to impress the<lb/> minds of children&#44; contain so much matter of a sectarian nature as<lb/> must almost banish them from a Jewish school&#44; where it is of import&#45;<lb/>ance to inculcate those principles which are the foundation of our reli&#45;<lb/>gion.  The only other books within our reach were the Elements of<lb/> the Jewish Faith&#44; by <persName>Rabbi S. Cohen</persName>&#44; and the Instruction in the<lb/> Mosaic Religion&#44; arranged from the German of <persName>Johlson</persName>&#44; by the writer<lb/> of this.  In this emergency the Child&#39;s Bible Questions&#44; by the A. S.<lb/> S. Union&#44; was of necessity but partially adopted&#44; there not being a<lb/> similar book and one more free from sectarian matter at hand&#59; but it<lb/> is pleasing to remark&#44; that an adaptation of this little work after our<lb/> own manner is now in the hands of a young lady of this place&#44; and<lb/> will&#44; it is hoped&#44; see the light soon&#44; and this with the consent of the<lb/> A. S. S. Union&#44; who have waived their copyright in our favour&#59; this&#44;<lb/> too&#44; is a highly gratifying fact&#44; and it speaks loudly and emphatically<lb/> of the enlightened views of the board of publication of that powerful<lb/> institution&#44; and especially of the kindness of <persName>John Hall&#44; Esq.</persName>&#44; through<lb/> whom this polite offer has been conveyed.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Last spring the first anniversary examination took place.  The day<lb/> fixed upon was one of anxiety to many a little heart&#59; and fathers and<lb/> mothers too&#44; looked forward with some thrill of hope and fear to the<lb/> probation of their children.  It need not be told&#44; that the exercises<lb/> were highly pleasing&#44; and the liberal contributions&#44; which were volun&#45;</p>
			<pb n="7"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">7</p>
				<p rend="align(center)">MEMORIAL.</p>
				<p>tarily made without any solicitation&#44; proved more clearly than words&#44;<lb/> how pleasing an object our brethren had witnessed that day.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In  the mean while the example set in this city was followed in <placeName>New<lb/> York</placeName> and <placeName>Charleston</placeName> about the same time&#59; and there&#44; as well as here&#44;<lb/> the superintendence and teaching are in the hands of the ladies.  The<lb/> endowment&#44; likewise&#44; in both places&#44; has been quite liberal&#59; and there<lb/> can be but little doubt&#44; that the commencement so happily made&#44; will<lb/> not fail to produce all the good results which could reasonably be<lb/> expected.  It is manifest&#44; however&#44; that such imitation abroad could<lb/> not do otherwise than stimulate to perseverance the first authors of<lb/> this good&#59; and they have not disappointed the hopes formed of them.<lb/>  They have gone on improving their charges by careful training&#44; and<lb/> these have for the most part proved by an acquisition of knowledge<lb/> and more correct deportment&#44; especially at public worship&#44; that the<lb/> labour bestowed upon them has been well bestowed.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The increasing demand for religious information induced the writer&#44;<lb/> immediately after the above examination&#44; to finish and to commit to<lb/> the press the Catechism for Younger Children&#59; and he mentions it<lb/> with sincere gratitude that it has already been introduced in the three<lb/> Sunday schools mentioned above&#44; in several private institutions&#44; and<lb/> for family reading&#59; it was more than he could have expected within<lb/> nine months after its appearance&#58; especially since he had so often<lb/> claimed the support of his fellow&#45;Israelites in his former publications.<lb/>  Yet he says it without affectation&#44; that his issuing the two school&#45;<lb/>books&#44; already mentioned&#44; appeared to him like the launching of a<lb/> frail bark upon a stormy sea&#59; but the promptitude with which many<lb/> of the answers were given by the scholars in their examination on<lb/> yesterday&#44; has inspired him with the hope that the frail bark may be<lb/> made instrumental in bearing some devoted spirit to the haven of<lb/> righteousness by the blessing of Him who imparteth knowledge&#44; and<lb/> giveth to man wisdom and understanding.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">It was yesterday that the second examination of the scholars of this<lb/> nursery of piety took place&#58; it was natural to expect some improve&#45;<lb/>ment upon the progress of last year&#44; but the result far surpassed the<lb/> most sanguine expectations.  The northern half of the ground&#45;floor of<lb/> the synagogue was reserved for the scholars&#44; each class headed by its<lb/> teacher&#59; and the steps leading to the ark were occupied by the<lb/> youngest class&#44; and certainly formed a collection of happy faces&#44;<lb/> which no one could look on without pleasure&#59; and these little ones&#44;<lb/> when called upon to answer their Bible&#45;questions&#44; acquitted themselves<lb/> in a manner highly gratifying to their parents and creditable to their<lb/> youthful teacher.  The other classes&#44; as they were called upon in suc&#45;<lb/>cession&#44; also showed that much care had been profitably bestowed&#59;</p>
			<pb n="8"/>
				<p>8</p>
				<p rend="align(center)">MEMORIAL.</p>
				<p>but it would be invidious to mention particulars where the whole was<lb/> so satisfactory.  The writer knows not how others felt&#44; but he can<lb/> truly say that he felt rejoiced and gratified&#59; and to judge from the<lb/> countenance of the many that thronged the place of worship&#44; he may<lb/> freely affirm&#44; that never a public exhibition left more favourable<lb/> impressions upon the hearers&#44; and that the words of congratulation<lb/> every where uttered must have sprung from hearts convinced that a<lb/> good work had been done in <placeName>Israel</placeName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">We were lately gratified by the arrival among us of the <persName role="author">Rev.<lb/> Moses N. Nathan</persName>&#44; Minister of the German Congregation&#44; Shangaray<lb/> Yahshar&#44; of <placeName>Kingston&#44; Jamaica</placeName>&#44; who visits this country in quest of a<lb/> renewal of his own health and that of his amiable companion.  As the<lb/> annual examination was so near at hand&#44; <persName role="author">Mr. N.</persName> was invited to ad&#45;<lb/>dress the congregation at the conclusion of the exercises&#59; he kindly<lb/> consented&#44; and returned from <placeName>New York</placeName>&#44; whither he had gone to the<lb/> relations of his wife.  He has conferred an additional favour by per&#45;<lb/>mitting us to have his address printed&#59; and it is to be hoped that its<lb/> admirable sentiments will be long remembered after this interesting<lb/> stranger shall have been restored to his home and station.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">It only remains to be added&#44; that at the conclusion of the address<lb/> contributions for the school&#45;fund&#44; more liberal than last year&#44; were<lb/> made&#59; and we may look forward to a long continuance of the useful&#45;<lb/>ness among us of the religious <sic>enterprize</sic> of our benevolent sisters&#44;<lb/> and that it will every year lay a stronger hold on the affections of all<lb/> the Israelites of this city&#59; and all that then will be left is to hope that<lb/> this example of righteousness may be universally followed&#44; and cause<lb/> the spread of truth and grace among all the seed of <persName>Jacob</persName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In the following pages are presented the exercises on the above<lb/> occasion&#44; and the spirit which called for this publication will no doubt<lb/> keep them long in the memory of all present.</p>

The excellent effects<lb/> of the work undertaken only within the last two years<lb/> are too palpable&#44; too manifest&#44; even if a doubt could for<lb/> a moment have been entertained or indulged of the<lb/> plan&#39;s ultimate success.  A continuance of the same<lb/> pious zeal and energy&#44; which led to the first establish&#45;<lb/>ment of a Sunday School for spiritual instruction&#44; is<lb/> alone required to produce solid and permanent benefits.<lb/>  Establishments like this have long been wanting among<lb/> us&#44; and this city&#44; renowned in the western world&#44; has<lb/> been the first to display an example worthy of imitation.<lb/>  Nor has it been neglected&#59; for in <placeName>New York</placeName> and <placeName>Charles&#45;<lb/>ton</placeName> they have not only instituted similar schools&#44; but</p>

For if man has<lb/> even the inclination&#44; he has not the time or patience to<lb/> undertake this obligatory duty.  In founding this excel&#45;<lb/>lent establishment&#44; the daughters of <placeName>Israel</placeName> have entered<lb/> into the meaning and intention of Scripture&#59; for the fear<lb/> of God being the beginning of wisdom&#44; and hence&#44; the<lb/> first thing to be instilled into the tender and ductile<lb/> mind of childhood&#44; the task has been most correctly and<lb/> righteously assumed by those&#44; to whose charge infancy<lb/> is confided&#44; and by whom it is trained and protected.</p>

If<lb/> the diligent and daily perusal of the pages of Holy Writ<lb/> was recommended to the renowned warrior&#44; the leader<lb/> of the Lord&#39;s chosen hosts&#44; if his reputation&#44; fame&#44;<lb/> glory and triumph over the armed and warlike heathen<lb/> were all made dependent on his carefully following the<lb/> rules&#44; and guiding himself by the celestial directions of<lb/> the law&#58; is not the same duty equally incumbent on<lb/> every member of the family of <persName>Jacob</persName>&#44; and the road to<lb/> happiness&#44; here and hereafter&#44; open to all&#44; as it was to<lb/> the illustrious dead&#63;  Let us remember the words of<lb/> the Almighty to <persName>Joshua</persName>&#44; the might captain&#44; who never<lb/> experienced defeat&#44; who confidently relied on the out&#45;<lb/>stretched arm by which he was redeemed from Egyp&#45;<lb/>tian slavery&#44; and not on the strength of the myriads he<lb/> commanded.  &#40;<persName>Joshua</persName> i. 7&#44; 8.&#41;  &#8220;Be strong and very<lb/> courageous&#44; to observe and do according to all the law<lb/> that <persName>Moses</persName>&#44; my servant&#44; commanded thee&#44; turn not from<lb/> it to the right hand or to the left&#59; this book of the law<lb/> shall not depart out of thy mouth&#44; but thou shalt medi&#45;<lb/>tate therein day and night&#44; to observe and do all that is<lb/> written therein&#44; for then thou shalt make thy way pros&#45;<lb/>perous&#44; and then thou shalt succeed.&#8221;  Be strong&#44; be<lb/> confident&#44; not in thy prowess&#44; not in thy sword&#59; but in<lb/> keeping and observing the law&#44; studying it day and<lb/> night&#44; for thereby thou shalt prosper&#44; and herein lies<lb/> the success of thy career.</p>

				<p>blend the love and fear of God and his commandments&#44;<lb/> to respect&#44; to maintain&#44; to uphold the dignity of that<lb/> pure law given by God to <persName>Moses</persName>&#44; to disregard popular<lb/> prejudice&#44; scorn&#44; hatred&#44; pity&#44; or whatever may assail it&#44;<lb/> to oppose the impenetrable shield of indomitable faith<lb/> to the sharp arrows of infidelity and sarcasm&#59;&#8212;teach<lb/> them&#44; and expose to their wondering gaze&#44; the bright<lb/> promises yet unfulfilled in the sublime writings of the<lb/> inspired and suffering prophets&#59;&#8212;teach them above all<lb/> to bear humbly&#44; meekly&#44; patiently&#44; as their ancestors<lb/> have done for ages&#44; the crying evils of calumny and<lb/> detraction&#59; for&#44; that <placeName>Shiloh</placeName> <hi rend="italics">will</hi> come&#44; the Messiah&#44;<lb/> their regenerator&#44; <hi rend="italics">will</hi> appear&#59;&#8212;and the God who<lb/> keepeth covenant and mercy&#44; made with <persName>Abraham</persName>&#44;<lb/> sworn unto <persName>Isaac</persName>&#44; and confirmed unto <persName>Jacob</persName>&#44; will not<lb/> let one word fall to the ground which He spake unto<lb/> the faithful minister of His house.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The difficulties which first attended this establish&#45;<lb/>ment could not have been few&#44; or easy to overcome&#59; the<lb/> prejudices long and deeply rooted to what seemed&#44; in<lb/> fact&#44; conformity to the customs of strangers&#44; must have<lb/> proved&#44; at the commencement&#44; serious obstacles to the<lb/> indefatigable founder and patroness of this society.<lb/>  These prejudices have&#44; under Heaven&#39;s help&#44; disap&#45;<lb/>peared&#59; and parents are fully awakened to an estimate<lb/> of the advantages to be obtained by their children in<lb/> this school.  To designate it appropriately&#44; we should<lb/> call it a nursery of Jewish piety&#8212;a plantation&#44; where<lb/> the young saplings of our faith are tended until they<lb/> have attained maturity of strength&#44; so that when trans&#45;<lb/>planted&#44; they may be ranked among the mighty trees<lb/> of the forest&#44; or be accounted as the cedars of <placeName>Lebanon</placeName>&#44;<lb/> planted in the house of the Lord&#44; and the courts of our<lb/> God.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">There is&#44; however&#44; one feature which deserves par&#45;</p>
			<pb n="22"/>
				<p>22</p>
				<p rend="align(center)">ADDRESS.</p>
				<p>ticular notice and commendation&#58; it is the laudable<lb/> conduct of persons in a respectable condition of life not<lb/> preventing their children from mingling with the indi&#45;<lb/>gent&#44; and overcoming the too often predominant scru&#45;<lb/>ples of silly pride and fear.  This is a peculiar and<lb/> beautiful characteristic&#44; one of the strongest supports&#44;<lb/> one of the main pillars of the institution&#44; and must<lb/> assuredly contribute to its prosperity and well&#45;being.<lb/>  In the ancient temple at <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>&#44; the poor man&#39;s<lb/> handful of meal was as acceptable an offering as the<lb/> fatling of the rich&#59; and the morning and evening sac&#45;<lb/>rifices were supplied by the half shekels collected alike<lb/> from peasant and prince&#59; for God would have equality in<lb/> His worship&#44; and the adventitious claims to superiority<lb/> are disregarded by Him&#44; who delights in the humility&#44;<lb/> modesty&#44; and lowliness of His servants&#44; whom He loves<lb/> for their pious virtues&#44; not for the number and value of<lb/> their burnt&#45;offerings and libations.  Whilst&#44; therefore&#44;<lb/> this principle of equality is persevered in and strictly<lb/> maintained&#44; whilst &#8220;the rich and poor meet together&#44;&#8221;<lb/> to learn and know that &#8220;the Eternal is the Maker of<lb/> them all&#44;&#8221; the objects of this society will be attained&#59;<lb/> and there will also exist such an endless desire&#44; such a<lb/> perpetual yearning for instruction&#44; that not one single<lb/> Jewish child shall remain ignorant of his Creator&#44; his<lb/> duties&#44; and his hopes of eternity.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Then&#44; when you have ploughed the soil&#44; removed<lb/> every stump and stone&#44; and eradicated every noxious<lb/> weed&#44; when you have sown the seed&#44; and it has yielded<lb/> a plenteous harvest&#8212;a hundred fold&#44; as it did to the<lb/> Patriarch <persName>Isaac</persName>&#44; then will your desires become more<lb/> extended&#59; you will wish to enlarge the narrow boun&#45;<lb/>daries which now encompass you&#44; and extend your<lb/> borders&#59; and then may we hope to see arise a house of<lb/> learning&#44; as in former days&#44; where our antiquities&#44; our<lb/> sacred and precious records&#44; our ancient philosophers&#44;</p>

				<p>moralists&#44; and poets shall form part of the superstruc&#45;<lb/>ture of learning and study&#44; whose foundation has been<lb/> laid in this embryo institution&#59; where&#44; with every<lb/> facility of means for the cultivation of art and science&#44;<lb/> in every branch of polite and popular literature which<lb/> shall put our youth on a par with others&#44; and make<lb/> them worthy and intelligent citizens and subjects&#44; they<lb/> may dive into the wisdom of those hidden tomes which<lb/> ignorance has decried and prejudice derided.  The<lb/> apparent torpor which bigotry and intolerance com&#45;<lb/>pelled us to assume is vanishing daily&#59; the latent spark<lb/> begins to kindle&#44; soon will it quicken into flame&#44; ex&#45;<lb/>pand&#44; enlighten&#44; and then&#44; when the beacon&#45;fire shines<lb/> forth far and wide to the wondering&#44; the amazed na&#45;<lb/>tions&#44; who have so long scoffed at us and think our<lb/> minds obscured by our tenacious adherence to the evi&#45;<lb/>dences and records of our former fame&#44; then will they<lb/> be compelled to admit&#44; as <persName>Moses</persName> foretold in Deuterono&#45;<lb/>my&#44; &#8220;surely this nation is a wise and understanding<lb/> people.&#8221;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Again do Jewish professors sit in the academical<lb/> chair not the neophytes who for the sake of obtaining<lb/> distinction under prejudiced and illiberal governments&#44;<lb/> abandon their people and renounce their God for ambi&#45;<lb/>tion or lucre&#33;  No&#33;  But men who have rejected ho&#45;<lb/>nours when fettered with oaths&#44; and <sic>trammelled</sic> with<lb/> assertions repugnant to their creed and their conscience.&#42;<lb/>  Soon may we hope to see their number increase&#44; and<lb/> colleges and schools founded under the superintend&#45;<lb/>ence of such consistent men&#44; where the student shall<lb/> no longer be compelled to conceal his faith&#44; to avoid the<lb/> ridicule and taunts of his Christian companions&#44; but</p>

Not that the commendable<lb/> zeal which now distinguishes its operations will relax&#59;<lb/> but it may please God to call hence its most earnest<lb/> supporters&#44; those disinterested labourers in the vineyard<lb/> of the Lord&#44; who seek no reward in the service of their<lb/> beloved Master&#44; and not enough be found willing or<lb/> able to undertake the work without compensation.<lb/>  Quietly yet accessibly useful&#44; this institution should<lb/> be liberally and amply endowed to afford every assist&#45;<lb/>ance which the spiritual wants of our youth may hence&#45;<lb/>forward require.  To the generosity and philanthropy<lb/> which so eminently characterize the supporters of our<lb/> charities&#44; there needs not much appeal when the wel&#45;<lb/>fare of a society so purely national is concerned.  There<lb/> can be no doubt that the mere requisition for pecuniary<lb/> aid will be answered promptly&#44; cheerfully&#44; universally&#44;<lb/> by hearts as grateful as they are joyful in promoting a<lb/> correct knowledge of God&#44; and wide dissemination of<lb/> His commandments.</p>

You are the objects of your parents&#39;<lb/> solicitude and affection&#44; of their fondest hopes&#44; their most<lb/> ardent wishes&#59; but equally&#44; not less so&#44; are ye to every<lb/> member of the stock of <placeName>Israel</placeName>.
