            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<persName>CROLY&#44; REV. DR. GEORGE</persName>&#44; Poet and Clergyman&#44; was born in<lb/> <placeName>Ireland</placeName>&#44; educated at Trinity  College&#44; <placeName>Dublin</placeName>&#44; and ordained in the<lb/> Church of England.  His verses are more remarkable for correctness<lb/> than vigour&#44; and are not very popular.  He enjoys the rectory of <placeName>St.<lb/> Stephen&#39;s&#44; Wallbrook&#44; London</placeName>&#44; and is understood to indulge in<lb/> &#34;writing for the newspapers.&#34;  He was formerly connected with<lb/> the &#34;Britannia&#44;&#34; a Tory weekly paper.  The interior of the church<lb/> in which his sermons are delivered is said to be the masterpiece of<lb/> <persName>Sir Christopher Wren</persName>.  <persName>Dr. Croly&#39;s</persName> best work is a romance&#44; &#34;Sala&#45;<lb/>thiel&#44; or the Wandering Jew.&#34;  His chief poems are &#34;Paris in 1815&#59;&#34;<lb/> &#34;The Angel of the World&#59;&#34; and &#34;Gems from the Aubigen&#233;.&#34;  He<lb/> has likewise written a Life of Burke&#44; and a work on the Apocalypse<lb/> of St. John.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<persName>DUMAS&#44; JEAN BAPTISTE</persName>&#44; the first Practical Chemist of <placeName>France</placeName>&#44;<lb/> late Minister of Agriculture and Commerce&#44; Professor of Chemistry<lb/> at the Sorbonne&#44; in the School of Medicine&#44; Member of the Institute&#44;<lb/> was born at <placeName>Alais</placeName>&#44; <date>July 1800</date>.  When fourteen&#44; <persName>Dumas</persName> went to<lb/> <placeName>Geneva</placeName>&#44; to study chemistry&#44; botany&#44; and medicine&#44; and his first pub&#45;<lb/>lication was an essay in connexion with <persName>De Candolle</persName>&#44; then a profes&#45;<lb/>sor in the Swiss city.  The attention of scientific men was soon<lb/> attracted to him by his researches in animal physiology&#44; in which he<lb/> was associated with <persName>M. Prevost</persName>.  In <date>1821</date> he was appointed teacher<lb/> of chemistry in the Ecole Polytechnique&#44; <placeName>Paris</placeName>.  In <date>1821</date>&#44; <persName>Dumas</persName><lb/> published a memoir on the relations existing between the specific<lb/> weights of solid bodies and their atomic weight&#59; and from that time<lb/> to the present has been constantly adding to our stock of knowledge<lb/> on the subjects of gaseous substances&#44; organic salts&#44; the atomic con&#45;<lb/>stitution of the different kinds of ether&#44; the nature of heavy oil of<lb/> wine&#44; the sulphate of oxide of ethyle&#44; oxalic acid&#44; the compounds of<lb/> the chemical properties of chloroform&#44; idoform&#44; and bromoform&#44; stear&#45;<lb/>opt&#232;ne&#59; the oil of rosemary and valerian&#44; upon organic compounds.<lb/>  <persName>Dumas&#39;</persName> theory of substitution is one of the most important works of<lb/> this chemis&#44; and his treatise on chemistry&#44; as applied to the arts&#44; is<lb/> another valuable offering to practical science.  His &#34;Le&#231;ons sur<lb/> la Philosophie Chimique&#34; are popular.  As a lecturer&#44; <persName>Dumas</persName> is one<lb/> of the most distinguished in <placeName>Paris</placeName>.  In <date>May 1849</date>&#44; <persName>Dumas</persName> was elected<lb/> to the National Assembly&#59; and the President of the Republic called<lb/> him on the <date>31st of October</date>&#44; to join the administration&#44; and <sic>intrusted</sic><lb/> him with the post of Minister of Agriculture and Commerce&#44; where<lb/> his chemical knowledge enabled him to render public service.  He<lb/> originated annual meetings bearing on agriculture&#44; commerce&#44; and<lb/> manufactures.  <persName>Dumas</persName> was Chairman of the Jury&#44; Class 2&#44; in the<lb/> Great Exhibition of <date>1851</date>&#44; in <placeName>London</placeName>.</p>

In the year<lb/> <date>1808</date> he was a member of the Council of Five Hundred&#59; in <date>1811</date>&#44; he<lb/> was President of the Court of <placeName>Rouen</placeName>&#59; in <date>1813</date> he was President of<lb/> the <emph rend="italics">Corps L&#233;gislatif</emph>&#59; in <date>1815</date> he proposed the famous Declaration&#44;<lb/> in which the rights of citizens were reserved&#59; and in <date>1830</date> he was</p>

            <p>appointed Minister of Justice.  His appointment derived its signifi&#45;<lb/>cancy from being a personal protest against <persName>Marshal Bugeaud</persName>.  He<lb/> is&#44; moreover&#44; highly esteemed by the French people.  At the elec&#45;<lb/>tions of <date>1842</date>&#44; <persName>M. Dupont</persName>&#44; indignant at seeing the deputies of the Eure<lb/> servilely voting in favour of the execrated Guizot ministry&#44; contested<lb/> four colleges of that department simultaneously&#59; he was elected in<lb/> all four&#44; and chose Evreux.  <persName>M. Dupont</persName> invariably voted against<lb/> the corrupt and dishonest administration which fell with the late<lb/> king.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<persName>GROTE&#44; GEORGE</persName>&#44; Banker&#44; political Reformer and Author&#44; was<lb/> born in <date>1794</date>&#44; at <placeName>Clay Hill</placeName>&#44; near <placeName>Beckenham&#44; Kent</placeName>.  His ancestors<lb/> came to this country from <placeName>Germany</placeName>&#44; and his grandfather founded&#44; in<lb/> conjunction with <persName>Mr. George Prescott</persName>&#44; the banking&#45;house in <placeName>Thread&#45;<lb/>needle Street</placeName>&#44; which still bears the name of the original partners.<lb/>  <persName>Mr. Grote</persName> was educated at the Charter&#45;house school&#44; and entered<lb/> his father&#39;s establishment as a clerk in his sixteenth year.  His<lb/> leisure was for many years afterwards spent in unremitting study.<lb/>  About <date>1823</date>&#44; he commenced writing a &#34;History of Greece&#44;&#34; upon<lb/> which work he steadily laboured till the Reform movement of <date>1830</date><lb/>&#45;<date>1831</date>&#44; called him forward into public life.  He espoused the cause<lb/> of radical reform&#44; and successfully contested the city of <placeName>London</placeName> in<lb/> <date>December 1832</date>&#59; which he represented in three successive parlia&#45;<lb/>ments&#44; until his retirement in <date>1841</date>.  His first publication was a<lb/> pamphlet in reply to <persName>Sir James Mackintosh&#39;s</persName> &#34;Essay on Parilamen&#45;<lb/>tary Reform&#44;&#34; in the &#34;Edinburgh Review&#59;&#34; it was printed anony&#45;<lb/>mously in <date>1821</date>.  He has since written a small work on the &#34;Essen&#45;<lb/>tials of Parliamentary Reform&#44;&#34; an article on &#34;<persName>Mitford</persName>&#44;&#34; in the<lb/> &#34;Westminster&#44;&#34; and another on <persName>Niebuhr&#39;s</persName> &#34;Heroic Legends of<lb/> Greece&#44;&#34; in the &#34;London and Westminster Review.&#34;  In Parliament<lb/> he was considered to have in especial charge the advocacy of the<lb/> ballot&#44; a question upon which he regularly made an annual motion.<lb/>  He has for some time retired from active participation in politics&#44;<lb/> and has thus recently been able to give to the world the earlier<lb/> books of his &#34;History of Greece.&#34;</p>

            <p>which the cotton of the southern states might be wrought up for the<lb/> supply of the home market.  With this view he relinquished the<lb/> importing trade&#44; and invested large sums in calico&#45;factories at<lb/> <placeName>Lowell</placeName>.  His design has so far succeeded. <placeName>Lowell</placeName> now numbers<lb/> more than forty thousand inhabitants&#44; with four hundred factories&#44;<lb/> and will probably long continue to be one of the most rapidly<lb/> increasing cities of the Union.  In <date>November&#44; 1839</date>&#44; <persName>Mr. Lawrence</persName><lb/> was elected to congress&#44; and four years afterwards was appointed<lb/> one of the commissioners for the settlement of the north&#45;east bound&#45;<lb/>ary question.

            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<persName>SPOHR&#44; LOUIS</persName>&#44; Musical Composer&#44; was born at <placeName>Gandersheim</placeName>&#44; in<lb/> the <placeName>Duchy of Brunswick</placeName>&#44; about <date>1783</date>&#44; the son of a physician.  He<lb/> was instructed by the German violinist&#44; <persName>Maurer</persName>&#44; in the art of play&#45;<lb/>ing that master&#39;s favourite instrument&#44; and early developed great<lb/> capabilities for music.  He was taken notice of by the <persName>duke</persName>&#44; who<lb/> appointed him a maintenance out of the civil list and afterwards<lb/> allowed him a stipend for the purpose of studying under the violin&#45;<lb/>ist <persName>Eck</persName>&#44; whom he accompanied on a journey to <placeName>Russia</placeName>.  In <date>1804</date> he<lb/> made a professional excursion in <placeName>Germany</placeName>&#44; and was appointed con&#45;<lb/>ductor of concerts to the <persName>Duke of Saxe&#45;Coburg&#45;Gotha</persName>.  Here he com&#45;<lb/>posed a number of concert pieces for the violin and clarionette&#44; quar&#45;<lb/>tetts&#44; quintetts&#44; duos for violins&#44; variations&#44; sonatas&#44; potpourris with<lb/> harp accompaniment&#44; and some overtures.  He also composed a col&#45;<lb/>lection of songs&#44; with pianoforte accompaniment&#59; the oratorio called<lb/> &#34;Das j&#252;gste Gericht&#59;&#34; and the opera &#34;Der Zweikampf der Gelieb&#45;<lb/>ten.&#34;  In <date>1813</date> he proceeded to the <placeName>Vienna</placeName> theatre&#44; with the nomi&#45;<lb/>nal appointment of chapel&#45;master&#44; and attracted great notice<lb/> during the session of the European Congress.  In <date>1814</date> he composed&#44;<lb/> at <placeName>Vienna</placeName>&#44; his genial &#34;Faust&#44;&#34; his first great symphony&#44; and the<lb/> cantata &#34;Germany freed.&#34;  In <date>1817</date>&#44; having visited <placeName>Italy</placeName>&#44; he<lb/> accepted the post of music&#45;director of the <placeName>Frankfort</placeName> theatre&#44; which<lb/> he gave up in <date>1817</date> to come to <placeName>London</placeName>&#44; where he wrote his two great</p>

After his return to <placeName>Germany</placeName> he resided for some time in<lb/> <placeName>Dresden</placeName>&#44; until called to be chapel&#45;master at <placeName>Cassel</placeName>.  During his<lb/> abode in the former city he had composed&#44; not only many of his<lb/> best instrumental pieces&#44; but had applied himself with zeal to the<lb/> production of dramatic music.  His opera &#34;Zemire and Azor&#34; is full<lb/> of deep and moving expression&#44; and his &#34;Jessonda&#34; developed.  His<lb/> operas &#34;Peter von Abano&#44;&#34; &#34;Abruna&#44;&#34; and &#34;Der Alchemist&#44;&#34; are<lb/> less esteemed.  His oratorios&#44; &#34;Die letzten Dinge&#34; and &#34;Die letzten<lb/> Stunden des Erlosers&#44;&#34; prove him a master in church music.  His<lb/> fourth symphony is one of his most popular works.  His composi&#45;<lb/>tions are all more or less characterised by a feeling of tender melan&#45;<lb/>choly&#44; such as in poetry is called elegiac.</p>

Clown and Pantaloon in his time tumbled over and<lb/> belaboured one another&#44; and bawled out their jokes&#44; before the most<lb/> beautiful and dazzling pictures which ever were presented to the<lb/> eye of the theatre&#45;goer.  How a man could do so much and so well<lb/> as <persName>Mr. Stanfield</persName> did&#44; during the time when he was the chief of the<lb/> <placeName>Drury Lane</placeName> scene&#45;room&#44; was a wonder to everybody&#59; and it was not<lb/> the public only which he delighted&#44; and awakened and educated<lb/> into admiration&#44; but the members of his own profession were as<lb/> enthusiastic as the rest of the world to recognise and applaud his<lb/> magnificent imagination and skill.  All through this painter&#39;s life<lb/> his industry and his genius have been alike remarkable&#44; and it is<lb/> curious to note&#44; in his performances of the present time&#44; how the<lb/> carefulness of the artist seems to increase with his skill&#58; as if this<lb/> conscientious man were bent each day upon improving&#44; on elaborat&#45;<lb/>ing&#44; and polishing his works&#44; on approaching more nearly to nature.</p>
