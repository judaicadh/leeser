                                        the<lb/> Church of England. His verses are more remarkable

                                        appointed him a maintenance out of the civil list and

                                        proceeded to the <placeName>Vienna</placeName> theatre, with
                                        the nomi-<lb/>nal appointment of chapel-master, and
                                        attracted great notice<lb/> during the session of the

                                                  <placeName>Italy</placeName>, he<lb/> accepted the
                                        post of music-director of the
                                                  <placeName>Frankfort</placeName> theatre,
                                        which<lb/> he gave up in <date>1817</date> to come to
                                                  <placeName>London</placeName>, where he wrote his

                                        resided for some time in<lb/>
                                        <placeName>Dresden</placeName>, until called to be
                                        chapel-master at <placeName>Cassel</placeName>. During
                                        his<lb/> abode in the former city he had composed, not only
                                        many of his<lb/> best instrumental pieces, but had applied
                                        himself with zeal to the<lb/> production of dramatic music.
                                        His opera "Zemire and Azor" is full<lb/> of deep and moving
                                        expression, and his "Jessonda" developed. His<lb/> operas
                                        "Peter von Abano," "Abruna," and "Der Alchemist," are<lb/>
                                        less esteemed. His oratorios, "Die letzten Dinge" and "Die
                                        letzten<lb/> Stunden des Erlosers," prove him a master in
                                        church music. His<lb/> fourth symphony is one of his most
                                        popular works. His composi-<lb/>tions are all more or less
                                        characterised by a feeling of tender melan-<lb/>choly, such
                                        as in poetry is called elegiac.</p>

                                        in the scenic department than his brilliant<lb/> coadjutor,
                                        have had the means of doing more towards advancing<lb/> the
                                        taste of the English public for landscape art than any
                                        other<lb/> living painters. <persName>Mr.
                                                  Stanfield</persName> for many years taught the
                                        public from<lb/> the stage—taught the pit and the gallery to
                                        admire landscape art,<lb/> and the boxes to become
                                        connoisseurs; and decorated the theatre<lb/> with works so
                                        beautiful, that one regrets the frail material of which<lb/>
                                        they were constructed, and the necessity for "new and
                                        gorgeous<lb/> effects," and "magnificent novelties," which
                                        caused the artist's<lb/> works to be carried away.
                                                  <persName>Mr. Stanfield</persName> has created,
                                        and after-<lb/>wards painted out with his own brush, more
                                        scenic masterpieces<lb/> than any man. Clown and Pantaloon
                                        in his time tumbled over and<lb/> belaboured one another,
                                        and bawled out their jokes, before the most<lb/> beautiful
                                        and dazzling pictures which ever were presented to the<lb/>
                                        eye of the theatre-goer. How a man could do so much and so
                                        well<lb/> as <persName>Mr. Stanfield</persName> did, during
                                        the time when he was the chief of the<lb/>
                                        <placeName>Drury Lane</placeName> scene-room, was a wonder
                                        to everybody; and it was not<lb/> the public only which he
                                        delighted, and awakened and educated<lb/> into admiration,
                                        but the members of his own profession were as<lb/>
                                        enthusiastic as the rest of the world to recognise and
                                        applaud his<lb/> magnificent imagination and skill. All
                                        through this painter's life<lb/> his industry and his genius
                                        have been alike remarkable, and it is<lb/> curious to note,
                                        in his performances of the present time, how the<lb/>
                                        carefulness of the artist seems to increase with his skill:
                                        as if this<lb/> conscientious man were bent each day upon
                                        improving, on elaborat-<lb/>ing, and polishing his works, on
                                        approaching more nearly to nature.</p>

                                        in the French National Assembly. His election by

                                        argument used by the<lb/> promoters of the law for limiting
                                        the suffrage in <placeName>France</placeName>. When<lb/>
