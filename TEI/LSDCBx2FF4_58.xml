            </p>
            <p>Dear Sir.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I am just in receipt of the Occidents<lb/> which your kind direction
                caused to be forwarded<lb/> to me with unusual dispatch &amp; I hasten to<lb/> offer
                you many thanks for your kindness in<lb/> calling my attention to the advertisement
                of the<lb/>
                <placeName>Charleston</placeName> Congregation. I trust you will par-<lb/>-don my
                freedom in trespassing further upon your<lb/> goodness, but for many reasons I am
                undisposed<lb/> to take a plunge in the dark &amp; discover too late<lb/> that my
                impetuosity has been unwise. I am thus<lb/> led to obtain as much information as
                possible<lb/> concerning the place &amp; people—labors &amp; emoluments<lb/> as
                regards the place my principal fears are on ac-<lb/>-count of climate <persName>Mrs
                    Mendes's</persName> health suffered<lb/> from her residence in
                    <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> &amp; if, as I have heard,<lb/>
                <placeName>Charleston</placeName> is as bad, I could never think of expo-<lb/>-sing
                her to the influence of such a climate. The people<lb/> cannot possibly be more
                unacceptable than those among<lb/> whom I live, but if they should possess the
                    vascillating<add>?</add><lb/> character I have heard ascribed to several
                American<lb/> congregations, I should be unwise to exchange the<lb/> ills I bear for
                those I know not of. I have however<lb/> a longing to be again in a Portuguese
                Cong.—that could<lb/> lead me very far, &amp; I fear would blind me against<lb/>
                many inconveniences. In respect to the labors and<lb/> emoluments of the office, I
                shall prosecute my<lb/> inquiries elsewhere, but will only trouble you for any</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>information you can afford me about the leads mentioned<lb/> above, especially the
                nature of the climate, extent of win<lb/>=ter, influence upon Europeans. If you
                could kindly add<lb/> any intelligence concerning the cause of <persName>Mr
                    Jacob's</persName> resig<lb/>-nation, &amp; also any hints respecting the cost
                of living<lb/> in <placeName>Charleston</placeName>, <add>?</add>, domestics &amp;c;
                —I should feel<lb/> extremely obliged. Before quitting this subject let<lb/> me
                iterate my apologies, for obtruding such questions<lb/> upon your valuable time
                &amp; attention; but as I recog<lb/>-nize in your goodness which secured to me early
                in-<lb/>-formation of the situation, an evidence of kind interest<lb/> I have
                presumed upon it as above. Be however assured<lb/> that I shall be happy to
                retaliate the service in any<lb/> way that I can be of use to you now or
                hereafter.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I have read with delight your remarks<lb/> on the Press &amp;
                pulpit, those two great teachers of<lb/> society, capable of achieving such vast
                results, for good or<lb/> for evil. Alas that I should have to point to any<lb/>
                congregation of my people as an evidence of this last<lb/> assertion, but let the
                communities of <placeName><sic>Cincinatti</sic></placeName> prove<lb/> how holy
                things can be defiled through the infamous<lb/> agency of a Pulpit filled by &amp; a
                Press directed by men<lb/> without principle. But I for one must say I<lb/>
                <sic>dont</sic> fear these men &amp; apprehend no <hi rend="underline"
                    >permanent</hi> evil<lb/> as the result of their blasphemies. <add>קאי שקרא לא
                    קאי</add><lb/> I firmly believe that the end of all such movements<lb/> is the
                reaction in favor of orthodoxy—that pure<lb/> religion which has not survived the

            <p rend="indent(1)">I have read your translation of the Bible with<lb/> real
                satisfaction &amp; I deeply regret that the price (10/6)<lb/> must militate against
                its general introduction in our<lb/> schools. I have tried to bring it to the notice
                of seve<lb/>ral gentlemen;—but have only succeeded in two in<lb/>-stances. I regret
                to say that men who cheerfully<lb/> give half a guinea for a night's amusement,
                think<lb/> that sum too much for God's word faithfully presented.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I some time since asked you to indicate a means<lb/> of forwarding a
                copy of my sermons, lately published<lb/> but you omitted to reply on that head. I
                however<lb/> send you a copy by the present opportunity &amp; shall<lb/> feel
                obliged for your candid—unreserved opinion. I<lb/> value your character eminently as
                “the man of sincerity”<lb/> &amp; I am sure you could not under the fear of
                wounding<lb/> an author's pride <sic>withold</sic> your judgment.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Allow one to congratulate you on your being again in<lb/> office
                among our people. I feel indeed that no office<lb/> can add prestige to the name of
                    <persName>Isaac Leeser</persName>, unad<add>?</add><lb/> though that be by the
                questionable dignity of Dr or “Rabbi”<lb/> but there can be no doubt that a wider
                field &amp; a more<lb/> extended privilege are opened before the minster than
                be<lb/>-fore the man. May the Eternal spare your useful life for many years, that
                you may live to see<lb/> the downfall of <hi rend="underline">infidel</hi> reform
                &amp; the triumph all<lb/> over the world of <add>תורת משה אחת</add>.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">With best respects I am, Dr Sir,</p>
            <p rend="indent(4)">Yours oby <add>?</add></p>
