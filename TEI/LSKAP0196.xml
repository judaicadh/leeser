            <p>My dear Sir</p>
            <p rend="indent(2)">Since I wrote you last, there has been a<lb/> Board meeting of
                Trustees who referenced <persName>Mr Lyons</persName> letter to<lb/> the
                Congregation which was convened on <date>Sunday 23d</date> met at<lb/> 11 ock when
                the Pastoral letter of <persName>Rev E. Lyons</persName>
                <hi rend="underline">excommunicating</hi><lb/>
                <hi rend="underline"><persName>Dr. E.</persName></hi> and denouncing the
                congregation for acting inconsistently<lb/> and forfeiting all claim to orthodoxy
                &amp;c and also to his<lb/> approbation._.was laid before the meeting, its reading
                created<lb/> commingled feelings of mirth, indignation, and pity, <del>for</del><lb/>
                <del>the ignorance</del> Our visible faculties could not but be excited<lb/> at the
                high f<add>?</add>ed nonsense in which it was couched, indignation<lb/> at his
                impertinence in excommunicating <persName>Dr. E.</persName>
                <del>and</del> Taking<lb/> exception at the action of the whole congregation, and
                leaving<lb/> them suddenly without any one to officiate on <date>Sabbath</date>
                (the<lb/> Synagogue was without service on that day) The resignation was<lb/>
                accordingly accepted by a close vote, altho there was none<lb/> who would have
                opposed it if it had not have been for his<lb/> family, however principle prevailed
                against <del>pity and</del> misplaced<lb/> pity, and his resignation was accepted
                and the proceedings<lb/> of the primary meeting endorsed by this,—immediately
                followed<lb/> a resolution, repudiating <persName>Mr Lyons</persName> ‚charge‚ that
                the congregation<lb/> had acted inconsistently or had departed from their
                principles<lb/> which way passed unanimously,—this having been done and<lb/>
                <persName>Dr. E.</persName> position sustained by the congregation. The Secretary
                produced<lb/> a letter from <persName>Dr. E.</persName> requesting the Congregation
                to excuse him<lb/> from delivering the lecture on the day appointed,—this letter
                called</p>
            <pb n="1V"/>
            <p>forth a resolution from <persName>Sam Hart Jr.</persName> appreciating the
                delicate<lb/> motives which induced <persName>Dr. E</persName> to decline, and
                endorsing his character<lb/> in a proper manner. A Resolution was also offered
                        <del><sic>insiting</sic></del><lb/>
                <del><persName>Mr Lyons</persName> to</del> declaring the office vacant and
                empowering the<lb/> Trustees to advertise for a Hazan &amp; lecturer at such salary
                at<lb/> the option of the Trustees, which will be I expect $1000.</p>
            <p><persName>Mr Lyons</persName> was also invited to <del>perform</del> officiate during the<lb/>
                <sic>Hollidays</sic> and as long after as suits his convenience—this was<lb/> done
                to prevent the Synagogue from being closed, a Gentleman<lb/> present was instructed
                to say <persName>Mr Lyons</persName> would do so, thus ended<lb/> the meeting.
                    <persName>Mr Lyons</persName> played a deep game, but the wrong<lb/> color
                    <del>bring</del> came up tramps<add>?</add>, &amp; he lost <del>the game</del>
                it.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">You can appreciate this act of <persName>Mr
                Lyons</persName>—when<lb/> I tell you he has said since, that he would not have
                made<lb/> objection if he had been consulted but it seems his pride was<lb/>
                touched, he was elected he says in his letter as the <hi rend="underline"
                    >Spiritual<lb/> adviser</hi> of the congregation, (he was <del>only</del>
                elected only <hi rend="underline">as reader</hi>) the<lb/> minutes <add>of the
                    election</add> were referred to at the meeting to prove it), he told
                    <persName>Mr<lb/> Sam Hart</persName>, that the congregation should have asked
                him to deliver<lb/> a lecture—and not another,—he was amazed at <hi rend="underline"
                    >your</hi><add>?</add> officiating<lb/> when here, and expressed himself so, but
                he was afraid of you<lb/> therefore he did not boldly come forward, then, but the B
                E Minister<add>?</add><lb/> was a fine chance for him, and he greedily swallowed the
                bait<lb/> hook and all and now hangs suspended, displaying <add>to the world</add>
                not his<lb/> religion nor any of its attributes, <persName>Dr. E.</persName> &amp; a

                <persName>Lyons</persName> told me had acted upon correct principles, which he
                approved<lb/> of,—an opportunity was made to introduce him into the<lb/>
                <placeName>Mobile</placeName> Synagogue by the recognition of the
                    Shrileth<add>?</add> Conn.<lb/> and instructed of assisting him, (by silence if

            <p>it was not consonant with his ideas of <hi rend="underline">Orthodox</hi> principles,
                he<lb/> denounces, excommunicates, and <sic>anathemizes</sic>, not only <persName>Dr
                    E</persName>—<lb/> but the whole congregation for countenancing him, and
                resigns<lb/> his situation giving this as his reason, when in reality the<lb/> man
                is devoid of principle and it was done from sheer spite<lb/> because he could not
                shine along side of a brighter constellation</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I am called off and must conclude—kind regards to all<lb/>
                    friends—<persName>Mr Valentine</persName> will send you official extracts from
                the<lb/> minutes of the congregation.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I heard <persName>Rev M Myer</persName> on
                <date>Saturday</date>.</p>
            <p><date>Friday</date> yesterday I recd your letter, I have set the ball<lb/> in motion
                and I am sure that some effort will be at<lb/> once made to call a public meeting
                and take the sense of<lb/> the congregation on the subject,</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">If elected—Could you not come on for <date>Rossanna</date> &amp;
                    <date>Kippur</date><lb/> and then get leave of absence for a couple of months
                after<lb/> to finish your business.— <persName>Valentine</persName> intends to
                write<lb/> you and send in resolutions of last meeting.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">There is only one objection in the way,—which you<lb/> would have to
                remove yourself. Our<lb/> constitution provides that no Minister shall be
                elected<lb/> for a longer period than two years,—The constitution<lb/> might be
                attend but this would require time and<lb/> if you were once elected and accepted,
                the congregation<lb/> would be only too glad to keep you, I see no reason<lb/> why
                    <hi rend="underline">they</hi> should prevent your accepting.</p>
