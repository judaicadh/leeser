				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>Charleston</placeName> <date>May 26 1852</date></p>
				<p>My dear Sir</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">Since I wrote you last&#44; there has been a<lb/> Board meeting of Trustees who referenced <persName>Mr Lyons</persName> letter to<lb/> the Congregation which was convened on <date>Sunday 23d</date> met at<lb/> 11 ock when the Pastoral letter of <persName>Rev E. Lyons</persName> <hi rend="underline">excommunicating</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline"><persName>Dr. E.</persName></hi> and denouncing the congregation for acting inconsistently<lb/> and forfeiting all claim to orthodoxy &#38;c and also to his<lb/> approbation.&#95;.was laid before the meeting&#44; its reading created<lb/> commingled feelings of mirth&#44; indignation&#44; and pity&#44; <del>for</del><lb/> <del>the ignorance</del> Our visible faculties could not but be excited<lb/> at the high f<add>&#63;</add>ed nonsense in which it was couched&#44; indignation<lb/> at his impertinence in excommunicating <persName>Dr. E.</persName> <del>and</del> Taking<lb/> exception at the action of the whole congregation&#44; and leaving<lb/> them suddenly without any one to officiate on <date>Sabbath</date> &#40;the<lb/> Synagogue was without service on that day&#41; The resignation was<lb/> accordingly accepted by a close vote&#44; altho there was none<lb/> who would have opposed it if it had not have been for his<lb/> family&#44; however principle prevailed against <del>pity and</del> misplaced<lb/> pity&#44; and his resignation was accepted and the proceedings<lb/> of the primary meeting endorsed by this&#44;&#8212;immediately followed<lb/> a resolution&#44; repudiating <persName>Mr Lyons</persName> &#8218;charge&#8218; that the congregation<lb/> had acted inconsistently or had departed from their principles<lb/> which way passed unanimously&#44;&#8212;this having been done and<lb/> <persName>Dr. E.</persName> position sustained by the congregation.  The Secretary produced<lb/> a letter from <persName>Dr. E.</persName> requesting the Congregation to excuse him<lb/> from delivering the lecture on the day appointed&#44;&#8212;this letter called</p>
			<pb n="1V"/>
				<p>forth a resolution from <persName>Sam Hart Jr.</persName> appreciating the delicate<lb/> motives which induced <persName>Dr. E</persName> to decline&#44; and endorsing his character<lb/> in a proper manner.  A Resolution was also offered <del><sic>insiting</sic></del><lb/> <del><persName>Mr Lyons</persName> to</del> declaring the office vacant and empowering the<lb/> Trustees to advertise for a Hazan &#38; lecturer at such salary at<lb/> the option of the Trustees&#44; which will be I expect &#36;1000.</p>
				<p><persName>Mr Lyons</persName> was also invited to <del>perform</del> officiate during the<lb/> <sic>Hollidays</sic> and as long after as suits his convenience&#8212;this was<lb/> done to prevent the Synagogue from being closed&#44; a Gentleman<lb/> present was instructed to say <persName>Mr Lyons</persName> would do so&#44; thus ended<lb/> the meeting.  <persName>Mr Lyons</persName> played a deep game&#44; but the wrong<lb/> color <del>bring</del> came up tramps<add>&#63;</add>&#44; &#38; he lost <del>the game</del> it.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">You can appreciate this act of <persName>Mr Lyons</persName>&#8212;when<lb/> I tell you he has said since&#44; that he would not have made<lb/> objection if he had been consulted but it seems his pride was<lb/> touched&#44; he was elected he says in his letter as the <hi rend="underline">Spiritual<lb/> adviser</hi> of the congregation&#44; &#40;he was <del>only</del> elected only <hi rend="underline">as reader</hi>&#41; the<lb/> minutes <add>of the election</add> were referred to at the meeting to prove it&#41;&#44; he told <persName>Mr<lb/> Sam Hart</persName>&#44; that the congregation should have asked him to deliver<lb/> a lecture&#8212;and not another&#44;&#8212;he was amazed at <hi rend="underline">your</hi><add>&#63;</add> officiating<lb/> when here&#44; and expressed himself so&#44; but he was afraid of you<lb/> therefore he did not boldly come forward&#44; then&#44; but the B E Minister<add>&#63;</add><lb/> was a fine chance for him&#44; and he greedily swallowed the bait<lb/> hook and all and now hangs suspended&#44; displaying <add>to the world</add> not his<lb/> religion nor any of its attributes&#44; <persName>Dr. E.</persName> &#38; a poor man<lb/> whom <del>he</del> <persName>Lyons</persName> told me had acted upon correct principles&#44; which he approved<lb/> of&#44;&#8212;an opportunity was made to introduce him into the<lb/> <placeName>Mobile</placeName> Synagogue by the recognition of the Shrileth<add>&#63;</add> Conn.<lb/> and instructed of assisting him&#44; &#40;by silence if even he thought</p>
			<pb n="2R"/>
				<p>it was not consonant with his ideas of <hi rend="underline">Orthodox</hi> principles&#44; he<lb/> denounces&#44; excommunicates&#44; and <sic>anathemizes</sic>&#44; not only <persName>Dr E</persName>&#8212;<lb/> but the whole congregation for countenancing him&#44; and resigns<lb/> his situation giving this as his reason&#44; when in reality the<lb/> man is devoid of principle and it was done from sheer spite<lb/> because he could not shine along side of a brighter constellation</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I am called off and must conclude&#8212;kind regards to all<lb/> friends&#8212;<persName>Mr Valentine</persName> will send you official extracts from the<lb/> minutes of the congregation.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I heard <persName>Rev M Myer</persName> on <date>Saturday</date>.</p>
				<p><date>Friday</date> yesterday I recd your letter&#44; I have set the ball<lb/> in motion and I am sure that some effort will be at<lb/> once made to call a public meeting and take the sense of<lb/> the congregation on the subject&#44;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">If elected&#8212;Could you not come on for <date>Rossanna</date> &#38; <date>Kippur</date><lb/> and then get leave of absence for a couple of months after<lb/> to finish your business.&#8212;  <persName>Valentine</persName> intends to write<lb/> you and send in resolutions of last meeting.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">There is only one objection in the way&#44;&#8212;which you<lb/> would have to remove yourself.  Our<lb/> constitution provides that no Minister shall be elected<lb/> for a longer period than two years&#44;&#8212;The constitution<lb/> might be attend but this would require time and<lb/> if you were once elected and accepted&#44; the congregation<lb/> would be only too glad to keep you&#44; I see no reason<lb/> why <hi rend="underline">they</hi> should prevent your accepting.</p>
			<p rend="indent(5)">Yours Truly <persName role="author">J. N. Carvalho</persName></p>
