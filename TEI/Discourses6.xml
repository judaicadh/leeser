                DISCOURSES ON THE JEWISH RELIGION. DISCOURSE I. FEAR OF GOD AND MAN. How holy art
                Thou&#44; God &#33; how pure is thy heing&#33; how immaculate thy perfection &#33;
                The heavens declare thy exalted glory&#44; and the earth responds to the theme&#59;
                and Avherever we are&#44; whithersoever we move&#44; we are met by the evidence of
                thy presence&#44; by the almost tangible manifestation of the proof that we are
                before Thee. In our sorrows therefore we are consoled with the assurance that Thou
                art near to listen to our sighs&#44; to behold our every suffering&#59; and when the
                world allures us unto sin&#44; the consciousness that thy eye is upon us will
                withhold us from transgressing thy precepts. &#33; that we may thus feel Thee
                forever&#44; know Thee in our hearts at all times&#44; have Thee pres&#8211; ent
                before our eyes continually&#44; that we may follow thy light and humbly walk where
                thy glory leads. For thus would we be perfect Israelites&#44; servants after VOL.

                punishment would follow the deed with which his callous mind is filled. Let it not
                then be supposed that the fear of man is a trait which we should discard from our
                soul&#44; on the contrary&#44; it is a wholesome principle which checks many an
                evil&#44; which prevents many a crime. And how beautiful a token has the Lord given
                us&#44; which is in&#8211; herent in our physical organization&#44; which is not

                who is not yet dead to every noble aspi&#8211; ration. It is the outward symbol of
                shame&#44; of which I am speaking&#44; it is the mantle of red which mounts on the

                man is laid to his charge. No one who is yet alive to the difierence between a good
                and a bad deed&#44; but must feel the blood rushing upward to his countenance&#44;
                when he is discovered in any act which has the smallest admix&#8211; ture of evil in

                he values virtue far more than the sin into which he has been betrayed. But let a
                per&#8211; son&#39;s effrontery once be so great that he can hear him&#8211; self
                accused without blushing&#44; let him be able to bear the taunts and reproofs of his

                who mingles ill the elegant world feel it extremely awkward that her modesty&#44;
                though shocked but in a slight degree&#44; will prove itself offended in a manner
                not to be mis&#8211; taken&#44; even without her wishing to display any emo&#8211;
                tion &#59; but let them be assured&#44; that it is a wholesome sentiment which
                causes this embarrassment&#44; it is the sentiment of innate feeling which
                understands&#44; so to say at a glance&#44; what is right and what is wrong&#44;
                which will make itself felt&#44; and is thus the best guar&#8211; dian against
                violent transgression. But let a female&#44; especially&#44; once learn to dispense
                with this sentiment&#59; let her have succeeded in being able to hear allusions to
                improper subjects unmoved&#59; let her be able to join unconcerned in ribald
                conversation &#58; and she is hastening to a state&#44; where modesty is little
                better than a mockery&#44; and virtue a thing perhaps in name whilst its essence is
                long since evaporated. &#8212; You may say probably that&#44; in thus experiencing
                the emotion of shame before the world&#44; it is only the feeling of be&#8211; ing
                detected in what men call improprieties&#44; which produces the outward token of

                that is&#44; in be&#8211; ing careful how we incur shame&#44; there is one
                consid&#8211; eration which the Rabbi Jochanan gave to his schol&#8211; ars&#58;
                &#34;O that the fear of Heaven might be upon you as the fear of flesh and
                blood.&#34; Progress or retro&#8211; gression&#44; as at times it may be called&#44;
                of civilization introduces customs or opinions which make certain acts or omissions
                disgraceful&#44; which&#44; in themselves&#44; arc far from being so. But a diseased
                state of public opinion sanctions something or demands another&#44; which in the
                strict code of Jewish morals is quite in opposition to the law. There have been
                times when drunkenness&#44; or excess of drinking at least&#44; was a fashionable
                vice &#59; men of high distinction in the state&#44; whose voice was listened to
                with breathless at&#8211; tention in the Senate&#44; or whose word of command led
                armies to battle&#44; were slaves to intoxication&#44; and unblushingly they
                exhibited their acquired infirmity before the public eye. The general opinion
                required them not to blush for their sin&#44; and the fear of God did not rest upon
                them with that crushing weight that it could arrest them in the path of
                transgression. &#8212; Or not to go back to times which have past&#44; let us rest
                awhile upon scenes of which we frequently hear&#44; in which&#44; to the disgrace of
                Israelites&#44; some of our own brothers halve been conspicuous actors&#44; as
                though they had not the fear of Heaven before them. I speak of the practice of
                single combat for words spoken which the world construes as a mortal insult. Let us
                imagine&#44; for example&#44; two young men engaged in seeking the same object&#44;
                say they are endeavour&#8211; <pb n="7"/> FEAR OF GOD AND MAN. 7 iDg to obtain the
                favour of the same woman&#44; or to reach the same political eminence&#44; which
                competition often produces mutual ill&#8211;will. Now to murder one the other in
                cold blood would bring the offender to an ignominious end&#59; he would be
                considered to have a brother&#39;s blood upon his garments&#44; and the gallows
                would terminate his guilty career. But civilization has discovered a means by which
                he can remove a rival&#44; I will admit with some risk to himself&#59; but still
                with this risk he can do so. The simple method is&#44; that he meet him in the
                presence of others&#44; and employ some insulting language&#44; which the other must
                hear and understand as applied to himself&#59; in other words&#44; he affixes to his
                enemy a public mark of disgrace&#44; as the world understands it&#59;
                straight&#8211; ways he expects to be defied by the other to mortal combat&#44; or
                else the offended would be considered a coward&#44; a poltroon&#44; with whom no
                respectable man can associate&#59; public opinion demands that he must challenge and
                fight his reviler&#44; or be branded as a worthless knave forever after. The
                defiance is given&#44; and incontinently accepted&#59; foes to God and man are
                appealed to to act as the friends to the parties&#44; such friends these&#44; as the
                butcher is to the lamb which he leads to slaughter&#59; the arrangements for mutual
                destruction are made with the same calcula&#8211; tion and cold deliberating with
                which one prepares himself for a journey. And now behold the two vic&#8211; tims of
                a false code of honour and morals placed op&#8211; posite to each other&#44;
                passively&#44; absolutely passive in the hands of their murderous friends&#44; the
                weapons of death are put within their tremulous grasp&#44; and after due

                the crime which defiles its beauty. Does the law take cognizance of the deed&#63;
                Perhaps there may be a mockery of justice&#44; an arrest&#44; an examination&#44; a

                she accepts the man stained with the blood of one who deeply&#44; fondly&#44; loved
                her&#44; and she disdains not to acknowdedge her allegiance to a malefactor against
                the Decalogue before the whole world. Or was the cause of the legal murder the love

                discover that they have their peculiar notions of shame and honour which can be as
                little defended as those which I have just exposed&#44; and that it is very often
                the familiarizing themselves with certain habits of thought and action which removes
                their odiousness&#44; and causes them to be looked upon with favour and approbation.
                Examples could be easily furnished &#59; but it would lead us too far to in&#8211;

                the limits of a religious dis&#8211; course. Enough we have shown that there is a
                true and a false fear of the opinion of the world&#44; the one which restrains us
                from sin&#44; it being the exponent of the word of God as revealed to us in the law
                &#59; the other which causes us to listen to the senseless laws of bar&#8211;
                barism&#44; or to a misconception of our duties&#44; and thus militates against our
                own peace and the good of so&#8211; ciety at large &#59; for whatever is
                opposed&#44; in good truth&#44; to our own happiness cannot be beneficial to the
                wel&#8211; fare of others &#59; because though each man is bound to make sacrifices
                to the public good&#44; he is not bound to sacrifice himself to any idea which a
                part of the community may by any chance whatever succeed in making for a time
                valid&#44; as a species of code by which men must be governed. &#8212; It is
                therefore requisite that we in the outset learn to distinguish when to regard the
                fear of man as wholesome&#44; and when to shun it as the author of evil and sorrow
                to ourselves and others. In this point as in every other the law of God as revealed

                against your cowardice. Still what does this all add to the strength of the first
                argument&#44; that the tone of society asks a crime of you&#63; It is only an
                amplification thereof&#59; and if 3&#39;ou feel&#44; as you should do&#44; as

                for violating the com&#8211; mands of your God. No one will deny that elegant

                requisite&#58; you should abandon such society&#44; and quit it as jou avoid a
                con&#8211; tagious disorder. The struggle&#44; to part with what costs you perhaps a
                great deal of manceuvring and anxiety to obtain&#44; may be severe and both annoying
                and painful &#59; but you would to a certainty part with a poisonous serpent&#44;
                though in your ignorance of its hurtful nature you might have spent much time and
                means to domesticate it with you. We may sum up the whole of what we have advanced
                on this head in a few words. Wrong is wrong&#44; no matter what the world may call
                it&#59; and there is sin in transgressing&#44; if even the whole human race should
                by a perversity of intellect applaud the malefactor. But besides the fashionable
                crimes&#44; which are done because the world tolerates them&#44; though the
                moralists of all nations unite in their condemnation&#44; there are other deeds
                which are condemned by Israel&#39;s law alone&#44; and the prohibitions against
                which are simply peculiar restrictions laid upon us&#44; in contradistinction to the
                gentiles. With them therefore it cannot now be said that there is any disgrace
                connected with their trans&#8211; gression &#59; since public opinion is not at
                present&#44; under the best aspect of the case&#44; based upon our religious ideas.
                We must therefore have a stronger incentive to resist them than those actions which
                are con&#8211; demned by the good of all nations. This motive is the shame which we
                must feel when confronted by our Supreme Judge&#44; at the time when he will visit
                all spirits&#44; and adjudge them to reward or punishment as their own deeds may
                plead for or accuse them. How will the son of the earth appear before his <pb n="16"

                make&#44; when he is once convicted by his own acts of disloyalty to his God and

                conscience unburdened with iniquity. It was to influence us with this conviction of
                the impossibility of escaping the divine vengeance&#44; that the Lord appeared in
                his awful glory in the presence of our ancestors on Mount Sinai. They beheld the
                great fire&#44; they felt the mountain quake&#44; they heard the loud voice of the
                cornet&#44; but saw no simihtude&#44; or figure. Still they heard the words
                pro&#8211; ceeding distinctly&#44; in a manner unapproachable by human organs&#44;
                from the midst of the great fire&#44; com&#8211; manding them to be holy in the
                manner the wisdom of their heavenly Father had prescribed to them. They were told to
                obey laws which other men knew not of&#44; of which no nation had ever heard before
                &#59; and when the awful announcement was over&#44; though they bad remained
                unscathed in the midst of all the glory&#44; they dreaded to approach again the holy
                mount where God was&#44; for fear that they should die. They therefore appealed to
                Moses that he should step for&#8211; ward and hear himself the commandments&#44; to
                com&#8211; municate them afterwards to his brothers. But the prophet in consenting
                by divine authority to be the mediator between God and Israel&#44; was still aware
                of the purpose of the Most High&#44; that it was not to de&#8211; stroy but to
                instruct that He had come. He spoke therefore to the people &#58; <pb n="17"/> FEAR

                were willing to observe his precepts. And there He displayed his power&#44; so that
                we might understand how great&#44; how exalted&#44; how powerful He is&#44; that we
                might feel a wholesome fear of incurring the resent&#34; ment and vengeance which
                appertain to sin. If man now is conscious&#44; whenever an opportunity for
                trans&#8211; gression offers itself&#44; that his God is present &#59; if he is
                convinced that though no human eyes see and con&#8211; demn him&#44; that though no
                human shame attaches itself to his conduct&#44; he cannot escape the cognizance and
                shame of the Lord &#58; he will surely hesitate at his intended acts&#44; tremble
                before the august Judge&#44; and sin not. There will arise before his mind the hour
                of judgment with his iniquity upon his soul&#59; before him he will behold the glory
                far more dazzling and terrible than shone at Sinai &#59; and he will call up the
                power of the offended Judge if he be found delin&#8211; quent&#44; and&#44; on the
                other hand&#44; the consciousness of a virtuous life and the approbation of his
                Father&#44; if he be adjudged innocent. Thus feeling&#44; how can the Israelite sin
                &#63; thus acting&#44; what has he to fear &#63; he has obeyed his God&#44; he has
                walked in his paths &#59; he has been faithful&#44; he has been afraid to sully
                himself with transgression&#44; and he is accepted&#44; because this 2&#42; <pb

                those who have walked in the path of life. You will thus see&#44; brethren&#44; how
                wise was the prayer of the dying Rabbi with which he blessed his disciples&#59; how
                wholesome it would be&#44; were we to dread oiFending God as much as we tremble to

                which are implanted in us are not evil in themselves&#44; and become only so when
                they are allowed to militate against the wisdom of God. But wdien we combine a

                Brethren &#33; If we survey the history of our people&#44; and en&#8211; deavour to
                trace therefrom the rules of our life and the doctrine we should believe in&#44; we
                cannot be far wrong in supposing that in this study we shall dis&#8211; cover the
                true principles of religion&#44; which it behoves us to impress indelibly on our
                spirits. The history of Israel is in very truth the history of Providence as
                displayed in his acts towards man&#44; and the results we read of confirm the
                announcement of the divine rule made on the day of the promulgation of the
                Deca&#8211; loccue&#44; that it is virtue alone which can render man happy&#44; and
                that through vice he invariably travels the road of destruction&#44; which&#44;
                though once in a while appearing to lead through flowery parterres&#44; or seemingly
                surrounded with cooling shades&#44; is sure to prove ultimately to the deluded
                traveller&#44; that noth&#8211; ing but evil betides him if he allows the dangerous
                and false lures to tempt him to venture upon these flowery parterres and cooling
                shades&#44; which invite him to enter to seek their fragrance or to enjoy their
                shelter. We cannot say&#44; that the history of Israel presents many points on which
                we can dwell with satisfaction&#59; but little glory is recorded there&#59; but few
                tokens of national greatness are presented to our <pb n="21"/> THE TRANSGRESSION AT

                were true to themselves and the religion which they had received. We had a
                country&#44; but we lost it through our dissensions&#59; we had a religion&#44; but
                we despised it through the perversity of our re&#8211; bellious hearts &#59; we had
                a gracious King&#44; but we offended Him by our foolish devotion to idols and
                heathen practices. It is therefore not from self&#8211;love that we can study our
                history &#59; on the contrary&#44; it is with&#8211; pain and humiliation alone that
                we can sit down to this task&#44; to peruse the portion of our records re&#8211;
                ferring to the period before the destruction of the first temple &#59; and after
                that it will be a heartfelt anguish at the innumerable sorrows which overwhelmed
                us&#44; as the unhappy bark tossed by the storm on a rocky beach is flooded by every
                wave&#44; which sweeps over the boiling floods and exhausts its rage upon the
                help&#8211; less wreck which has been surrendered to its fury. Still there are
                instruction and hope springing from the perusal of the historical parts of
                Scripture&#59; in&#8211; struction&#44; inasmuch as the sacred pages strip man of
                the false glare which outward circumstances often throw around him&#44; and exhibit
                him to himself&#44; as he is&#44; rebellious&#44; froward&#44; and vain &#59; and
                hope&#44; because we trace in every transaction the good Providence which allows not
                an act to pass or a word to be spoken&#44; but directs it to the ultimate good of
                mankind at large&#59; and we are thus led to look for a triumphant issue of the fate
                of our people&#44; by means of the long journey through sorrow and anguish which
                they had to travel in the progress of the human race to its ulti&#8211; mate
                destiny&#44; whatever this may be. It is for this reason that we&#44; as
                believers&#44; do not <pb n="22"/> 22 THE TRANSGRESSION AT HOREB. dread the ridicule
                which those unfriendly to religion cast upon the records of Scripture&#44; because
                the people to whom the law was given&#44; and who&#44; if any&#44; ought to have
                been thoroughly imbued with its spirit&#44; have so signally failed to prove
                themselves worthy of the high calling which the Bible assigns to them. We are
                told&#44; that from our very birth we were rebellious&#44; and that at no period of
                our history were we ever in such a position&#44; as that we could with truth say
                that our religion had rendered us any better than the other nations of the earth. If
                in truth we have been chosen&#44; thus speak our opponents&#44; we have done little
                for our faith&#44; and in the same manner our faith has done little for us &#59;
                that consequently both our own example and what we have endured can give but slight
                weight to the words of Scripture&#44; seeing that so small an amount of good has
                resulted therefrom. &#8212; We at once&#44; in reply&#44; will admit the whole
                argument in so far that we have done little to forward our faith&#44; and tliat our
                worldly happiness on the other hand has been rather retarded than promoted by our
                being even nominally attached to it &#59; but this admission is nothing against the
                truth or necessity of revelation&#44; nor does this argue that we have not been
                benefitted in the highest degree by the possession of our blessed religion. Let us
                see how the case stands. &#8212; God&#44; to use a human phrase&#44; found our
                ancestors subject to cruel slavery in the highly civilized country of Egypt&#44; a
                land renowned in story for the magnificence of its architectural monuments&#44; for
                the greatness of its king&#44; the triumph of its warriors&#44; and the wisdom of
                its priests. For at least two hundred years our fathers had been subjected to the

                people&#44; every hope seemed crushed&#44; every avenue to preferment was
                effectually closed against the abhorred slaves&#44; who worshipped not the gods of
                Egypt. Still&#44; though they suffered grievous wrongs&#44; it was una&#8211;
                voidable that they should learn the worships and crimes of their masters &#59; these

                some knowledge of the di&#8211; vine truth given to Abraham may have remained with
                the suffering Israelites&#44; and although they may have been disinclined at first
                to assimilate in worship to their masters &#58; it could not be otherwise in the
                na&#8211; ture of things&#44; but that from the constant habit of obedience they
                should in the lapse of several genera&#8211; tions learn to regard themselves as an
                inferior race&#44; and to respect instinctively those whose commands they were
                compelled implicitly to obey&#44; under penalty of personal chastisement in addition
                to their involun&#8211; tary servitude. Tlie free&#8211;born first slave no doubt
                re&#8211; volted in his very soul against the yoke he was com&#8211; pelled to bear
                &#59; but the son reared in slavery felt the bands no longer galling&#59; it was his
                lot&#44; and though fainting under the toil&#44; he looked upon it as his
                right&#8211; ful thouo&#59;h hard heritaofe. So imagine&#44; then&#44; a whole

                among those whom they were com&#8211; pelled to obey&#58;&#44; and whom they
                therefore involuntarily respected masters and superiors &#58; and do you be&#8211;

                &#59; they became steeped in error&#44; and perhaps learned in the process of events
                to worship the Lord through the mediatorial agencies&#44; as they regarded them&#44;
                of the gods of Egypt. It is said&#44; that in that elegant country everything had
                been typified&#59; eternity was represented through a winged sun&#44; the mystery
                which surrounds all creation by a veiled figure&#44; and so in an immense number of
                ideas and things &#59; and when these ideas were at length represented by male or
                female deities&#44; they were wor&#8211; shipped&#44; it is said so at least&#44; by
                the priests as attri&#8211; butes of the One&#44; the sole Creator&#44; whom Abraham
                had proclaimed&#44; and who had revealed himself to man from the beginning. The more
                spiritual now we assume Egyptian idolatry to have been in remote antiquity&#44; when
                our progenitors sojourned there&#44; the more is it probable that they became
                tainted with the semblance of truth which was offered to their accept&#8211; ance.
                And how could they well resist &#63; The God of Abraham&#44; Isaac&#44; and
                Jacob&#44; who was represented by no image&#44; and dwelt in no temple&#44; did not
                appear to them&#44; to relieve them from their sorrows &#58; the chil&#8211; dren of
                Ham were at peace under their emblematic worship&#44; whilst the descendants of Shem
                were ser&#8211; vants unto them. If then we assume a high intellec&#8211; tual
                standard for the idolatry prevailing in Egypt&#44; the more&#44; upon
                reflection&#44; will you find it to have been calculated to induce the Israelites of
                the day to give ear to the instruction which the priests of that country conveyed to
                the people respecting their belief. Perhaps you may discover something analogous in
                the apostacy of some Israelites to the modern Naza&#8211; rene doctrines&#44;
                commonly termed the Protestant faith. <pb n="25"/> THE TRANSGRESSION AT HOREB. 25

                of image&#8211;worship&#44; and it stood far apart from the simplicity of our own
                belief&#44; apostates could not frame any excuse for forsaking ours and adopting its
                behests. But since by the magic spell of a reformer a new feature has been in&#8211;
                troduced&#44; since the Bible has been made ostensibly the rule of faith&#44; and
                what we term idolatrous has been removed from the churches &#58; some have been
                found&#44; who profess that they are able to reconcile the mysticism of a divided
                deity&#44; and the belief in a me&#8211; diatorial power&#44; with the

                God&#59; thou shalt have no other gods before me.&#34; This aberration of a sound
                intellect we witness in our own day&#44; after sciences have become domesticated in

                stretch forth his hand and take of the fruit of the tree that stands before him

                should have been inclined to listen&#44; at least&#44; to the ideas of their

                mission&#44; to conquer hearts&#44; to invigor&#8211; ate souls&#44; to banish
                unbelief&#44; to estabUsh a nation&#44; to subdue the world. Do you however believe
                that the effect was to be instantaneous &#63; Then God should not have come to

                members the way of the Lord to exercise righteousness and justice &#59; and hence
                after he fell under the dominion of cunning priests and arbi&#8211; trary

                revelation on Horeb changed all this forever &#33; the truths before known were

                came not to the altar with his offering. Nay more&#44; the vulgar errors of the day

                intelligible to the understanding no less than audible to the ear&#44; two millions
                heard them&#44; and after&#8211;generations could not henceforward forget what their
                fathers had thus received &#59; there were truths delivered&#44; the veil of
                darkness and deception&#44; which had covered the earth&#44; was rent in twain&#44;
                the secrets of God&#39;s counsels were revealed at once&#44; in one hour&#44; to an
                entire people&#44; surrendered from heaven to become the inheritance of man &#59;
                and doctrines of life were propounded which are lucid in their very in&#8211;
                ception&#44; and which give life to all who lay hold of them as their support&#44;
                as their guides&#44; as the enlight&#8211; en ers of their reason. Thus stood
                Israel&#44; when Moses went up to the mount to receive the two tables which God had
                writ&#8211; ten&#44; full of the awful yet consolatory words which lie had addressed
                to our fathers on Sinai. They were yet new in their faith&#44; their feet had
                scarcely com&#8211; menced to travel on the to them still untrodden path. The
                prophet was hidden from their sight&#44; the con&#8211; suming tire had ceased to
                terrify them&#44; they had be&#8211; come used to it from its constant presence&#44;
                and the absence of the prophet for so long a period as forty days was almost too
                great a trial for the unthinking many&#44; though the few who had rightly imbibed
                the spirit of God quailed not though the presence of their deliverer no longer
                inspired them to obedience. The masses perhaps reverted back to the splendid temples
                of Egypt&#44; to the immense piles erected at Thebes&#44; at Karnac&#44; and other
                places&#44; to the deities of Mitzraim &#59; the fertile fields no doubt floated in
                their imagina&#8211; tion where&#44; though they had been slaves&#44; they could <pb

                abundance &#58; whilst to their own newly revealed God there was no temple
                dedicated&#44; not even a spot consecrated in the vast bounds of the desert where
                they lay encamped&#44; whilst of all the good promised them their sensual appetite
                realized nothing&#44; in the immense extent of sand which stretched around them in
                every direction. Understand well&#44; the religion was new&#44; the prophet was
                away&#44; and they had just emerged from slavery. Is it then wonderful that their
                desire for Egypt&#39;s gods as well as for Egypt&#39;s fleshpots should revive upon
                the first opportunity for rebellion &#63; They there&#8211; fore rushed to
                Aaron&#44; and distinctly told him that&#44; Moses having disappeared&#44; they knew
                not wdiither&#44; they demanded of him to construct for them gods who should go
                before them&#44; symbolical images&#44; which should be carried in their front on
                their marches as was done with heathen nations &#59; for they wanted some visible
                figure before which they could worship&#44; as was the practice in the country where
                they had dwelt so long. The very figure made by Aaron in the con&#8211; fusion of
                the moment must prove to you that this view is correct &#59; he moulded for them a
                golden calf&#44; the bull&#44; as is well known&#44; being one of the figurative
                idols of Egypt&#44; representing one of their gods under this outward symbol. But no
                sooner was one image presented to them&#44; than they included the whole of the
                system to which they were accustomed&#58; &#34;These are thy gods&#44; Israel &#33;
                who have brought thee up from the land of Egypt&#44;&#34; they exclaimed&#59; the
                whole of the revelation was forgotten by those who had de&#8211; manded a
                symbol&#44; and they ascribed their very deliv&#8211; erance to the intermediate

                It is strange that human intellect should be so perverted&#59; but this is not the
                only case in which we find it so. History&#44; in many instances&#44; exhibits the
                same folly in nations&#44; following in a train of sense&#8211; less folly&#44; till
                they awaken only at the brink of ruin&#59; and each individual will in his own life
                or experience be able to call to mind innumerable examples&#44; where he or others
                have followed out a course of conduct against which their own better nature or sound

                the emblem of a visible deity once before their eyes&#44; the Decalogue once
                in&#8211; fringed by making to themselves an image&#44; they rushed away from the
                simplicity of worship&#44; where the heart feels and the tongue utters scarcely
                audible sounds&#44; to the brutal rioting which distinguished heathen festivals. The
                period for which Moses had been called to the mount had just expired&#44; and he
                received the two tables&#44; for which he had so long dwelt in the presence of the
                Most High&#44; in a manner as no mortal has ever yet dwelt&#44; and had heard and
                seen things which had never been vouchsafed to any other son of Adam to witness&#44;
                when he was told&#44; that the people which he loved so much&#44; in whose behalf he
                had returned&#44; though an exile&#44; unto Pharaoh&#44; to demand their
                liberation&#44; had so soon forgotten all that had been wrought for them&#44; and
                had made unto themselves a golden&#44; calf as god&#44; and sacrificed unto it and
                worshipped it&#44; and said &#34; These are thy gods&#44; O Israel &#33; which have
                brought thee up from the land of Egypt.&#34; Moses then descended&#44; after praying
                for forgiveness&#44; and declining for himself to become the great nation promised
                unto Abraham which should <pb n="31"/> THE TRANSGRESSION AT HOREB. 31 descend from
                liis seed. At the foot of the mountain lie met his faithful servant Joshua&#44; who
                had remained there all the time that his master had staid on the mount&#44; and
                together they approached the camp. &#34; There is the noise of war in the
                camp&#44;&#34; was Josh&#8211; ua&#39;s thought&#44; when he heard the tumult. But
                the practised ear of Moses knew better. He had&#44; doubt&#8211; less&#44; during
                his residence with the wise men of Egypt&#44; learnt the manner of their worship. He
                therefore said&#44; &#34; It is neither the shout of victory nor that of defeat&#44;
                but the voice of singing which I hear&#44;&#34; no doubt aUuding to a species of
                hymn sung in alternate parts by the whole crowd at the idol festivities. &#8212; And
                so it was &#59; Moses came to the camp&#44; and there pre&#8211; sented themselves
                to his anguished sight the people dancing around the upraised calf&#44; shouting in
                their madness as though they had found their long&#8211;lost god. They&#44; who are
                acquainted with heathen my&#8211; thology&#44; will no doubt recall similar
                instances of senseless joy among Roman and Grecian rites&#59; as there was&#44; on
                the other hand&#44; mourning on occasions of the death or disappearance of these
                creatures of a diseased fancy. Here then were the people in a state which the Bible
                well terms a disgrace to their op&#8211; ponents &#59; they had thrown off the
                yoke&#44; which though light&#44; was too heavy for their shoulders&#44; they had
                cast aside their glory&#44; and paid adoration to the image of a

                which these pieces of stone were merely the emblems &#59; and he threw from his
                hands the tables&#44; and broke them at the foot of the mount. Now observe the
                legislator&#39;s wisdom. He did not call around him the people to upbraid them&#44;
                whilst in the frenzy of their madness&#44; with their ingratitude&#44; it would have
                been useless &#59; but he invoked the aid of those who had re&#8211; mained faithful
                to the standard of the Lord&#44; who were the brothers of Moses&#44; his own tribe
                of Levi &#59; into their hands he placed the avenging sword&#44; and they without
                mercy&#44; on that awful day of transgression and madness&#44; struck dismay in the
                hearts of the riot&#8211; ous multitude who&#44; when their intoxication was
                over&#44; and when they found their prophet overthrowing their idol and its
                worshippers&#44; returned to their alle&#8211; giance to the Lord and his law &#59;
                and not till then did Moses speak to the people concerning their great sin&#44; told
                them how grievously they had offended&#44; and that atonement was needed for their
                transgression. Let us now follow in admiration the unselfish man&#44; whom God has
                chosen&#44;&#44; to the august Presence. He knocks at the gates of Mercy&#44; not
                glossing over the sin that had been committed&#59; but he knew himself
                innocent&#8211; of all blame&#44; and he had been assured that he was an accepted
                and faithful servant before the Lord. If even therefore the whole nation had been
                extermin&#8211; ated&#44; even his brother Aaron&#44; who with himself had been the
                instrument of the freedom of Israel&#44; he would himself have stood unscathed
                amidst the de&#8211; struction&#44; and the 3Iosaic nation would have&#44; in
                pro&#8211; cess of time&#44; supplanted that called by the name of Israel. Yet he
                cared not to live&#44; should his brothers perish. &#34; But if thou forgivest not
                their sin&#44; I pray <pb n="33"/> THE TRANSGRESSION AT IIOREB. 33 thee blot me out
                from tliy book which thou hast written &#59;&#34; in the book of the law&#44;
                Moses&#39;s name was already recorded as the messenger of God to Israel&#59; it was
                a glorious lot thus to be destined to live for&#8211; ever in the grateful memorial
                of all future ages. But all this was nothing to the prophet. &#34; Blot me out&#44;
                I pray thee&#44;&#34; was his earnest entreaty&#44; &#34;forgive&#44; or else I wish
                not to be remembered.&#34; Yet would the Lord not accept the self&#8211;sacrifice
                thus nobly tendered by his messenger&#44; and He said &#58; &#34; Him&#44; who hath
                sinned against me&#44; him I will Mot out from my hook.&#34; Exodus xxxii. 33. But
                the atonement asked was granted upon a par&#8211; tial execution of the
                judgment&#59; many perished by divine visitation&#44; besides those who had fallen
                by the Levites&#39; swords&#59; but we were taught emphatically&#44; that no one can
                be a mediator between God and the sinner&#44; &#34;the soul that sinneth&#44; even
                that alone must die&#59;&#34; there is no atonement&#44; except by repentance&#44;
                which will wipe&#34; ofip sin&#44; make the crooked straight&#44; the unclean
                clean&#44; and restore man to divine favour. Although not immediately connected with
                our sub&#8211; ject&#44; I cannot avoid reminding you&#44; how utterly the plain
                sense of Scripture is opposed to all anti&#8211;Jewisli doctrines &#59; for if the
                mediatorship for sin were indeed a doctrine of&#8211;Scripture&#44; here would have
                been the place to reveal it clearly to Moses&#44; thus &#34;not thee will I
                accept&#44; but I will send one who shall reconcile me to a sinning world.&#34; But
                no such idea is held out&#59; &#34;Him who hath sinned against me&#44; him
                alone&#44; <pb n="34"/> 34 THE TRANSGRESSION AT HOREB. none else will I blot out
                from my book&#44; him will I punish according to his deeds&#44; none else in his
                stead can be chastised&#44; none else can be accepted.&#34; But the chief idea
                involved in the whole transaction&#44; besides the exhibition of the frailty of
                human na&#8211; ture&#44; is the doctrine of repentance&#44; which we are taught for
                the first time in the Bible. The people laid aside their ornaments and mourned&#59;
                and God approved of their repentance and promised to spare them&#44; and not visit
                upon them their iniquity at that lime. We at once will see&#44; that immediately
                after the Lord accepted from them gifts as a free&#8211;Avill of&#8211; fering to
                build the tabernacle in the wilderness which was to be the residence of the glory
                which has been promised should abide with them. We are therefore warranted in
                believing that the repentance and hu&#8211; miliation of the people were favourably
                accepted&#44; and that we have at the same time the best assurance&#44; that for the
                greatest transgressions repentance will avail. So also teach our wise men in the
                spirit of mercy which pervades the law&#58; &#34; Israel were not worthy of that
                deed&#44; nor was David fit for that deed&#44; only to give a hopeful example to
                repentant sinners.&#34; And we may argue thus&#58; If Israel were accepted after
                apostatizing in a body from the law of God&#44; if David&#44; so usually
                righteous&#44; committing in his for&#8211; getfulness of duty a deed of daring

                greater right have we&#44; each in his humble walk of life&#44; to ex&#8211; pect to
                he forgiven bj our heavenly Father&#59; surely He will not be wroth forever&#44; and
                when the soul that He has made asks in humility and truth to be for&#8211; given. He
                will to a certainty hearken&#44; and do accord&#8211; ing to all that the penitent
                asks of Him. Long as I have detained you in this&#44; what you may deem the
                preliminary part merely of a subject of the highest importance to us as
                believers&#44; to elucidate the consistency of Scripture&#44; and the use of our
                re&#8211; ligion to ourselves&#44; and of our adherence to the same&#44; it was
                impossible to let the present discussion be con&#8211; densed in a briefer space
                than I have done. Imper&#8211; fectly as I have sketched the subject&#44; it must
                strike you as removing&#44; perhaps&#44; some objections which the revilers of
                revelation brmg against the truth of our hopes. All I can do is to furnish you with
                materials for thinking&#59; it is yours to follow them up and to in&#8211; vestigate
                for yourselves. At all events&#44; I trust that the words spoken to&#8211;day will
                not be forgotten&#44; but dwell in your soul when o.ccasionally doubts come to your
                mind or are presented to you by others. It is not improbable that at a future
                day&#44; I may speak again on this topic&#59; but in the meantime let us pray for
                light&#44; that we may be made intelligent in the word of God&#44; and learn to
                believe in silence where cold reasoning might remain unsatisfied. &#8212; May thus

                counsels which our passions and the allurements of the world offer to our

                it is thy wisdom which restrains&#44; it is thy word which guides us securely. And

                Amen. Brethren &#33; Every system&#44; he it a code of kiws&#44; a science&#44; nay
                even any particular trade&#44; has its peculiarities which distinguish it from all
                others&#44; and by which it can at once he recognized by those familiar with the
                same. It is therefore but reasonable to expect that&#44; in be&#8211; coming
                familiar with Judaism&#44; we shall discover in it also some traits which are
                entirely its own&#44; and which mark it as a system differing essentially from all
                others. And in so thinking we shall not be disap&#8211; pointed &#59; for Judaism
                has its especial characteristic&#44; and this is &#34; obedience.&#34; Other
                religions which are akin to ours demand&#44; what is termed&#44; &#34; faith&#34; as
                ab&#8211; solutely requisite&#44; and as the sole requirement for any man to be
                saved&#44; whilst but a secondary importance is assigned to religious acts proper.
                But we&#44; on the other hand&#44; have been differently instructed &#59; nothing
                less than absolute obedience&#44; founded upon a firm belief or faith in the truth
                of the Lord and his law&#44; can satisfy our conscience&#44; and thus
                professions&#44; even if they be the most heartfelt and sincere&#44; fail of
                con&#8211; stituting us Israelites&#44; and render us instead of this children of
                sin. Let us examine then simply how an Israelite should be educated to enable him to
                lead a consistent&#44; relig&#8211; ious life &#59; for 5&#8211; hold it superfluous
                to prove the neces&#8211; sity of our adhering to our faith &#59; hence the duty of
                fulfilling its behests become at once apparent. How are we then to educate the
                Israelite &#63; is a question of no small importance to every one belonging to our

                all Israelites are bound to see that their religion be respected&#44; and thus all
                have to take heed that a due share of proper educa&#8211; tion be afforded to all
                those they can benefit by their influence. The Israelite&#39;s education should be
                practical &#59; that is to say&#44; from the first moment that reason begins to
                direct his acts he should be initiated in religious deeds&#44; and be thus gradually

                soon as he can understand instruction of a higher nature&#44; but only after he has
                learned already to obey&#44; let him be informed of the reason for the acts which he
                practises himself&#44; and which others around him perform. Tell him then of the
                existence of the great Creator&#44; whose manifes&#8211; tation is revealed in
                everything which the eye beholds&#44; whose voice is heard in every sound that
                reaches the ear&#44; whose goodness sustains and governs all crea&#8211; tures&#44;
                whose power is unlimited&#44; whose wisdom is unsearchable &#59; and when he
                naturally asks&#44; &#34; What must I do to please this great Being &#63;&#34; tell
                him that He asks nothing else than obedience to the law&#44; which benevolently

                neighbour like ourselves. When you have proceeded thus far&#44; when you have

                festivity and joyful or mournful days will give you ample material for
                conversation&#44; and be the means of explaining to him the reasons&#44; so far as
                they are known to us&#44; for certain observances con&#8211; nected with them. For
                instance the little ceremony which we practise on the festival of Purim of reading
                aloud the book of Esther&#44; though it is not commanded in the books of the
                Law&#44; will afford you an excellent opportunity to speak&#44; for instance&#44;
                after this fashion. A time was when we Israelites did not live&#44; as we do
                now&#44; scattered in small bodies all over the world&#44; oppressed as we are in
                some countries&#44; banished from others&#44; and equals with the other inhabitants
                in a few other lands. We formed on the contrary a state of our own&#44; governed no
                less in civil than religious mat&#8211; ters by the law of our God. This code&#44;
                whilst it pro&#8211; nounces punishment against those who wilfully trans&#8211;
                gress the commandments&#44; is nevertheless one of mercy and equal rights &#59; all
                the citizens of the Jewish state&#44; whether Israelites or not&#44; were alike in
                the eye of the Law &#59; the stranger could not be oppressed&#44; though he served
                not God the Lord&#44; but we were commanded to love him as ourselves. Now it was
                made a condition of the continuance of the Israelites as a separate state&#44; that
                they should be obedient in everything to the precepts of the law on which their
                civil and religious codes were founded&#59; but that&#44; if they should prove
                disobedient&#44; they should not alone lose their independence&#44; but should be
                driven out of their country which had been promised to their first founder&#44;
                Abraham the Hebrew&#44; because he had been obedient to the commands which he had
                received. <pb n="40"/> 40 ON OBEDIENCE. It was on obedience alone the Jewish state
                had been founded&#44; and when this was withdrawn by the people&#44; there was no
                other remedy but to scatter the disobe&#8211; dient among other countries&#44; that
                they should learn there the difference between submission to the mild decrees of
                their God&#44; and the arbitrary tyranny of princes and nations who had no natural
                love for the Israelites. This event actually took place &#59; for though frequently
                warned by good and wise men&#44; sent to re&#8211; prove them for their sins&#44;
                they persisted in bidding defiance to the laws of God&#59; till at length the
                threat&#8211; ened evil occurred&#44; and they were first conquered by foreign
                enemies&#44; and then gradually driven altogether from their country&#44; Palestine.
                They were living scat&#8211; tered in many lands &#59; but the greater portion in
                the dominion of the kings of Persia&#44; who had conquered many countries and ruled
                in the height of their power from India at the east to the south and west at
                Ethi&#8211; opia&#44; and among the rest over Palestine&#44; where a few Jews had
                again settled under the protection of these Persian kings&#44; whilst the greatest
                part remained be&#8211; hind in what is called captivity. It now happened that one
                of these rulers of the East was capricious and tyrannical &#59; he had favourites
                and bestowed on them whatever they might ask&#44; and again punished them as
                suddenly&#44; when they incurred his displeasure. It was the fate of the Jews to
                incur the hatred of one of these favourites&#44; named Ilaman &#59; because
                Mordecai&#44; one of the tribe of Benjamin&#44; refused to bend his knee to him&#44;
                which the other ofiicers of the royal palace did by the king&#39;s orders. He then
                sought to obtain his master&#39;s consent&#44; for a large sum of money&#44; to

                hearing from her relative Mordecai the danger which threatened her people&#44; went
                to the king to ask his mercy&#44; after having prepared herself and all Jews for
                three days by fasting&#44; prayer&#44; and penitence. &#8212; The king at length

                forget themselves&#44; as to swerve from the line of duty in which they had
                instructed them &#33; But both these classes should consider&#44; that mere
                theoretical or me&#8211; chanical religion is alike unfit for influencing the mind
                permanently. It may answer indeed in times of general conformity&#44; especially
                when the pressure from without induces our brothers to seek refuge from their great
                Protector&#44; to let children become habitually religious from seeing all their

                con&#8211; veyed from the earliest infancy&#44; and it is not to be doubted that the
                result will be highly gratifying&#44; and be the means of restoring the now failing

                to de&#8211; plore. Some persons are foolish enough to suppose that it is that

                nature of the country&#34; which is inimical to religion &#59; undoubtedly there is
                some truth in the position as far as example acting on the mind goes. But to suppose
                that this or the other ten years&#44; or hundred years&#44; this or that country is
                un&#8211; suited to Judaism&#44; is certainly arguing without due reflection. There
                is one thing only needed&#44; an en&#8211; lightened religious education&#44;
                adapted to the circum&#8211; stances of the state of sciences and political equality
                existing around us&#59; and then surely the fruits will prove that the seed has been
                well planted. There are in this century&#44; and in this country&#44; men and
                wo&#8211; men whose piety is unwavering&#44; Avhose faith is staunch&#44; whose
                example sheds around them a beneficent influ&#8211; ence &#59; but you will always
                find that they have re&#8211; ceived instruction&#44; or that they have enjoyed an
                ex&#8211; ample in their elders which protected them against violent transgression.
                Let this then be resorted to &#59; let education and example at home be aftbrded to
                our youth &#59; and who can despair of the success of his re&#8211; ligion &#63;

                that sinning is not necessary to them &#58; and have Ave not reason to hope that
                they will return to the full companionship of their brothers&#63; And if we now wish
                to have the children around us able to ap&#8211; preciate the benefits of our
                faith&#44; can we resort to any thing else than proper schooling&#44; to any thing

                &#63; They must be able to with&#8211; stand evil&#44; and this can be done only by
                giving them such reason for being obedient&#44; as will outweigh all arguments which
                cupidity&#44; or indolence&#44; or desire might ofler in favour of transgression.
                Besides all this&#44; there is another powerful reason why this early training is so
                desirable. It is this &#58; to give the mind a taste for things of a higher order
                than the mere passing events of the day. Appeal to a worldling for aid in any good
                cause&#44; and he at once will calculate how much money or labour it will cost him
                &#59; he will convince himself to his own satisfaction&#44; that he has no money to
                give&#44; though he hoards up daily sums which he thinks he will never need in his
                business &#59; he has no time&#44; though his hours hang heavily on his hands&#44;
                as some useless thing which he strives in a hundred ways to get rid of. But speak of
                such a matter to an enlightened person who has some other sentiments than the mere
                body&#44; and he will be able to appreciate your thoughts &#59; he will have money
                to give&#44; if he even have no more than he can con&#8211; sume &#59; and will have
                an hour&#39;s leisure&#44; though he work for bread from morning til night. &#8212;
                Now I need not tell you how much we suffer in this country from want of concert&#44;

                &#8212; This latter objection is no doubt true as far as they are concerned &#59;
                the good effects of enlighten&#8211; ment in religion are not perceived by many&#44;

                the good will come again&#44; I cannot doubt. We are at pres&#8211; ent in what may
                be termed the state of transition &#59; the ancient order of absolute conformity
                without inquiry is passing away&#59; the brief period of absolute unbelief&#44; when
                every thing was doubted&#44; is also lapsing fast&#44; if it has not departed
                altogether. We are therefore at the commencement of an era of free inquiry with the
                tendency towards religion &#59; hence it is not to be supposed that there will not
                be contending elements all struggling for supremacy&#59; but we require no spirit of
                prophecy&#44; though this has been vouchsafed in the Bible likewise&#44; to
                predict&#44; that there will be soon a famine in the land&#44; not a hunger for
                bread&#44; not a thirst for water&#44; but to know the way of the Lord. Mere
                authority may perhaps be disregarded&#59; but when one can prove &#34;thus says the
                Lord&#44;&#34; the people will be anxious to do accordingly&#44; having&#44; as they
                then will have&#44; full and undivided faith in the word of God. But as usual with
                me&#44; I have wandered away from the subject which I first spoke of&#59; I must
                therefore return to it without farther detaining you on the in&#8211; cidental
                observations I have made&#44; interesting as they may be. &#8212; I stated that&#44;
                as our religion is one of ob&#8211; servances&#44; the Israelite&#39;s education
                ought to look to this chiefly&#44; that he be obedient&#44; in order that he may
                bear the true distinguishing mark of a son of Israel. I have recommended instruction
                in the reasons of the laws as the main lever&#44; in inducing the mind to a
                conformity with the duties demanded of us. But in doing so we must be very cautious

                precepts&#44; and where every little matter is made per&#8211; fectly manifest to
                the commonest understanding. The law&#34; of Moses is not of this kind &#59; many
                things there are which have an evident solution in the his&#8211; tory of our people
                and the common sense of man. But there are others again which are neither
                refer&#8211; able to history nor deducible to clear reasoning for a basis &#59;
                since they are edicts of the great King who&#44; in commanding them&#44; wished to
                give us means of right&#8211; eousness&#44; in which we&#44; as children&#44; should
                yield our reasoning to his superior wisdom and guidance. In reading of them in
                Scripture we will never find any other reason assigned than &#34; I am the Lord your
                God&#44;&#34; meaning they are emanations from the Deity&#44; tests of
                obedience&#44; and hence no matters for specula&#8211; tion. We may&#44; it is
                true&#44; without incurring guilt&#44; strive to clear up the mystery of these
                laws&#59; but if we do not succeed&#44; we cannot religiously aver&#44; that we are
                absolved from obeying&#44; because we do not understand. Such is the custom of the
                vain&#8211;glorious&#44; who place their reason on a par with their Maker&#39;s
                understanding&#44; forgetting the immeasurable distance which they occupy from the
                Infinite in goodness and knowledge. In educating therefore the Jewish child&#44;
                proper care should be taken to make this fact at once manifest to his comprehension.

                leads. Among the laws just spoken of&#44; where no reason is assigned to us&#44; are
                those relating to the sacrifices of which we have read in the section of the law for
                to&#8211; day. Sacrifices&#44; it is true&#44; were not originally a mere Jewish

                offerings were accept&#8211; able&#44; and when the temple yet stood&#44; had to
                devote his whole soul to the act he was about to commit&#44; the thought had to
                accompany the slaying&#44; the sprinkling of the blood&#44; up to the burning of the
                victim or the eating of the flesh &#59; every thing Avas to be superin&#8211; tended
                with a scrupulous earnestness&#59; and he was to rely upon these acts of
                obedience&#44; accompanied by an entire faith in the truth of God&#44; for the
                efficacy of the atonement to be made therewith. Some have fancied that something
                else than the sacrifice was meant in the atonement made by the offering at the
                altar&#59; but on inspecting the whole law not a trace of such a doctrine is
                found&#59; hence we must say that it is not the true solution of the mystery
                attending the subject. Like other acts&#44; however&#44; the sacrifices were a test
                of obedience&#44; and only when thus brought were they considered acceptable. And
                thus we read &#58; &#34; And lie shall lay his hand upon the head of the
                burnt&#8211;offering&#44; and it shall be accepted for him favourably to make
                atonement for him.&#34; Leviticus i. 4. <pb n="51"/> ON OBEDIENCE. 51 So&#44; you
                see&#44; it was the act of obedience which made the sacrifice acceptable &#59; and
                tlien it made no dif&#8211; ference liow dlight the gift was &#59; for it was the
                will which consecrated the gift&#44; it was full faith which hallowed the handful of
                flour or the statelj ox&#44; which rendered alike the humble stranger in a strauge
                land with the king&#44; who issued forth from his palace fol&#8211; lowed by
                rejoicing thousands. &#8212; Now&#44; it is true&#44; how&#8211; ever&#44; the
                sacrifices are abolished&#44; because our sins have destroyed our altars&#59; but
                the faith of Israel in Israel&#39;s God is not yet destroyed&#58; this abides with
                us forever&#44; even as the blessed Spirit of God which we have in his law. If then
                we have sinned&#44; let us awaken our ancient faith in God&#39;s goodness&#44; to
                seek his courts with prayer&#44; and his presence with humility&#59; and then we
                have well&#8211;founded hopes that He will hear us even in the lands of our
                dispersion&#44; and do and forgive according to all that He has promised unto our
                fathers. &#8212; And may his love protect and bless us&#44; even now and forever.

                were scattered in the various towns and provinces of the Roman em&#8211; pire. They
                saw around them at first the emblems of heathenism in its glory&#44; and they
                asked&#44; &#34;When will vengeance come &#63;&#34; They saw the Caesars glut&#8211;
                ting their vengeance upon those who merely sought to regain their lost liberty&#44;
                and they anxiously in&#8211; quired&#44; &#34; When will this innocent blood be
                avenged &#63;&#34; They cast their eyes to the East&#44; and there were the Roman
                eagles. They looked to the North&#44; and there the banners of the Caesars waved
                triumphant. They turned their vision to the South&#44; and shouts of vic&#8211; tory
                resounded from the Roman legions&#44; and the West too bowed beneath the yoke of the
                conquerors. Was ever empire more fortified against adversity than was Rome under
                Trajan and his immediate suc&#8211; cessor &#63; You may say that it bore even then

                you have believed that so soon both the temples of his gods and his empire would

                length&#44; in less than two hundred and fifty years after Titus had destroyed
                Jerusalem a convert of the new system deprived the emperor of his power&#44; and
                seated himself upon the throne occupied before by the fortunate Augustus&#44; the
                brave Vespasian&#44; and the wise Antonine. But even this change of religion did not
                save the Roman empire. Barbarians from the centre of Asia&#44; nations unknown to
                the destroyers of the temple&#44; rushed out from their distant aod obscure homes on
                the lands where refinement was established&#44; and struck blow after blow upon the

                strange&#44; so wonderful are the vicissitudes we have rapidly sketch&#8211; ed&#59;
                but it proves what I meant to illustrate&#44; how vain it is to judge from outward
                marks of prosperity of the strength of empires. Indeed we have lived&#44; as an

                ti&#39;ite al&#8211; most to repeat the fact&#44; that our life is limited to a few
                short years&#59; that whatever we have acquired abides not with us beyond the bounds
                of the earth&#44; and that death closes up forever all the aspirations after
                greatness which we have entertained through a long life of worldly success. What

                most cunning devices have been contrived to per&#8211; petuate wealth in

                family&#44; how many incentives has every one thus&#44; whether rich or poor&#44; to
                secure to himself the esteem of the world&#44; and to his relatives and children tke
                kindness of their fellow&#8211;men. Surely this one con&#8211; sideration alone
                ought to be enough to restrain us from sinning&#44; and to admonish us to beware how
                we sacrifice our own temporal happiness even&#44; by allow&#8211; ing ourselves to
                be drawn aside unto the by&#8211;paths of sin. We have thus shown that it is a
                fallacy to suppose that greatness and happiness are the same thing. But it is also
                unreasonable to suppose that our virtue pre&#8211; vents our getting along in the
                world&#44; to use a homely phrase. Herein individuals as well as nations are alike
                short&#8211;sighted&#44; if they suppose this to be the case. If we are

                as men&#44; from the low state in which we find ourselves. It is&#44; indeed&#44;
                not to be supposed that prosperity always follows on industry&#59; such an idea
                would remove from Providence his right to bless our labour or withhold his blessing
                as may seem best in his eyes &#59; but He will not send his blessing to those who

                what do we really need in our religious affairs &#63; is it a constant agitation
                from Avithin or oppression from without&#44; on the one side&#44; or is it&#44; on
                the other&#44; more beneficial to be at peace internally and externally&#44; and to
                consolidate the advantages which our position confers on us &#63; Some of us indeed
                have thought that oppression was a good thing for us&#44; that it taught us to rely
                the more firmly on divine Provi&#8211; dence for protection&#44; and that with its
                removal has commenced a new course of action diametrically op&#8211; posed to a
                consistently religious life. Others again hold that peace within is but another term
                for a sleepy inaction&#44; which wastes the precious hours without producing any
                thing useful towards the public good. Therefore both these classes&#44; but chiefly
                the latter&#44; do not seek peace&#44; it is an element of too quiet a nature&#44;
                it is a state in which they cannot rise to the surface&#59; for to rise quietly and

                the meanest reptile is of service in some way or the other&#59; and why not
                they&#63; But it is surely no great proof of goodness of heart&#44; or of public
                spirit&#44; or of a high degree of enlightenment&#44; to find fault with every

                our day may perhaps imagine that it is a pleasant thing to be at the head of a
                religious establishment&#44; where a comfortable sup&#8211; port is provided for the

                those who wish to lead the few who dissent from such a church are equally ambitious
                in a small way&#44; to have their followers look up to them right or wrong&#44; and
                obey their directions without in&#8211; quiry. No doubt you might point out some
                such who wish to be obeyed as though it were a spirit who spoke out of them&#59; but
                we hazard little in averring that&#44; as a class&#44; the teachers of Israel are

                it deigns to dwell for a brief space upon the wrongs we had to endure&#58; and where
                were our teachers &#63; in power&#63; in wealth &#63; They were never in such a
                position. Moses to a certainty was &#8211;the leader&#44; spiritual as well as
                political&#44; of the people&#59; but after his decease we seldom find the priest in
                power. We pass over the turbulent times of the Judges&#44; of which but few notices
                have come down to us&#44; though these tell us how much religion was neglected in
                many places of Israel&#59; but from the commencement of the kingdom under Saul we
                always find&#44; that the religious part of our polity had to suc&#8211; cumb unduly

                from the first to the second temple&#44; we shall be struck with the remarkable
                fact&#44; that the men in power in Judsea uniformly almost hated the teachers of
                religion&#44; and that many of the latter fell victims to the bad passions of the
                former. During the captivity&#44; what have they not endured&#59; if the humbler
                followers of Judaism were despised and spurned&#44; its teachers were singled out
                for persecution&#59; for strange though it may appear&#44; history nevertheless
                together with our experience instructs us&#44; that there has always been the
                greatest desire manifested by all sorts of men&#44; the heathen&#44; the
                infidel&#44; the Nazarene&#44; and Mahomedan&#44; to lure away our members from our
                communion&#44; and therefore those who aould lead the people have always heen looked
                upon with especial suspicion. Nothing can be alleged with truth against the
                peacefulness of our system&#59; our people have always been obedient to the laws of
                the land. I speak of them as a class&#44; even when oppressed&#59; they are sober
                and industrious&#44; few of them are given to extravagance and low pur&#8211; suits
                &#59; they may be freely called a moral people nearly wherever they are found &#58;

                required no deep sagacity in the rulers of former ages to point out the Rabbis as a

                selected as objects of vengeance&#44; and their books considered as instruments
                which successfully opposed the expected extension of the power of the church over
                the handful of Israehtes. Whenever therefore opportunity offered&#44; the Eabbis
                were banished&#44; they were not allowed to teach re&#8211; ligion without personal
                danger&#44; and their books&#44; which were even more dreaded than their personal
                presence&#44; were destroyed in incredible numbers&#44; at times when every thing
                had to be copied with the pen&#44; before the invention of printing&#59; and if I

                one time at Avignon&#44; or some other Catholic capital&#44; and this operation of
                destroying Jew&#8211; ish books was repeated several times with all due solemnity in
                the presence of the clerical tyrants. How our enemies succeeded in injuring us need
                not be told&#59; for they did their work so well that but little which is certain in
                our history during many centuries can now be found after the closest research. It
                almost appears as though we suffered every thing which is wicked and cruel&#44; and
                that our sorrows have been mocked by the addition of utter forgetful ness which has
                been cast over them. Only fragments of a history of the Jews are attainable&#44; the
                mass of incidents which occurred will probably always remain unknown&#44; till a

                which adorn the books of sacred Writ. At present&#44; we acknowledge&#44; there is
                no such dan&#8211; ger attending our teachers or their works &#59; but for all that
                there is a danger of even a greater kind which <pb n="76"/> 76 THE TRUE WAY. now
                threatens us. It is the rage enkindled in some places for change&#44; and the
                concomitant disrespect with wdiich the legacy of our fathers is spoken of. Were it
                that the contest remained confined to our own members&#44; we might perhaps hope of
                soon set&#8211; tling the differences which have unfortunately&#8211; arisen &#59;
                but our old opponents also take part in the disunion&#44; and uniformly rejoice when
                they see a chance of a hope for the introduction of their views into our coun&#8211;
                cils&#44; and assert&#44; and no doubt beheve&#44; that modern reform is a deviation
                from Judaism and an approxi&#8211; mation to their doctrines. Hence they applaud
                every sort of division which is met with &#59; they glory over the disrespect with
                which schismatics regard the Rabbis&#44; and by insinuations at least&#44; encourage
                as more rational and less bigoted and inaccessible the modern breakers down of the
                fences of Judaism&#44; above those wdio regard as sacred the ancient land&#8211;

                faith&#44; one in deeds&#44; one in prayer&#44; and one in hope of a future
                restoration. I do not mean to insinuate that our reformers are less attached to the
                fundamental principles of Judaism&#44; the belief in the unity of God&#44; than we
                are&#44; or that they have thus far given the ISTazarenes much cause for

                that our former persecutors rejoice in the estabhshment of re&#8211; form
                synagogues&#44; and openly assert that thus Jews are approaching some of the many

                    n="77"/> THE TRUE WAY. 77 that apostacies properly so&#8211;called&#44; or
                voluntary deser&#8211; tions of the Jewish household for the union with any other
                church&#44; have for some quarter of a century been more frequent than before &#59;
                since during persecution the weak of faith left us&#44; because they could not
                en&#8211; dure the sufferings which we had to encounter&#44; or expose themselves to
                the death by the hands of the executioner which awaited the faithful in Israel. We
                may well ask&#58; &#34;Why is this so&#63;&#34; The answer is easily enough given.
                The adherence to our faith&#44; from a childlike confiding trust&#44; has been
                weakened by the occurrences of the age &#59; the name of Israelite is in many
                countries a bar to public preferment&#44; and there are many who eat rather the
                bread of infamy as apostates&#44; provided the mauy smile on them&#44; than live by
                their own labour which they would have to do as Jews. It matters not what the boon
                is&#44; whether it be employment in the cabinet&#44; on the bench&#44; in the
                army&#44; in the church&#44; or in the more humble way of pensioned mechanic&#44; or
                public underling&#44; so it is aome&#8211; thing which is obtained as the price of a
                barter of religion &#59; and hence those who feel no conviction in their faith&#44;
                whose mind is bewildered by the specula&#8211; tions of a vain philosophy&#44;
                forsake us and join them&#8211; selves to wheresoever their interest leads. It is to
                my view an indifference to religion altogether&#44; the fruit of the agitation and
                unsettling of the mind of the people&#44; which leads to apostacy &#59; and
                thus&#44; how&#8211; ever unworthy the motives which have produced the
                conversions&#44; the converts themselves will insist upon their having changed from
                grounds of conviction and attachment to their new belief&#44; and will express a

                and the road of salvation were closed to them. It may be&#44; that some of these
                converts are sincere&#59; the human mind is a strange compound&#44; and some persons
                may thus be convinced of the truth of a proposition which to another appears as the
                most absurd and inconceivable. So may the priests of Egypt have been sincere in
                their worship of animals&#44; so may the Brahmins be convinced of the great sin of
                killing one of their consecrated bulls. I do not say that one or the other deceives
                his new associates&#59; though this is doubtless so in the vast majority of
                cases&#59; but this we may assert&#44; that the greater portion are of those whose
                religious conduct was loose&#44; and who have not been religiously and strictly
                educated by their parents. One thing must be added in this connexion &#58; though
                the number of apostates is&#44; alas &#33; too great for the glory of Israel&#44;
                they are not so numerous as it is occasionally as&#8211; serted &#59; but even if it
                were&#44; it would only be amount&#8211; ing to this&#44; that those unworthy of the
                name of Is&#8211; rael were gradually leaving our ranks to join them&#8211; selves
                to those whose religion allows them more lib&#8211; erty of action&#44; and places
                them upon an equality with the majority of the inhabitants of their respective
                countries. So far however as past experience shows&#44; the numbers of Israel are
                not likely to diminish by any of the steps taken to inveigle away those who are
                willing to leave us &#59; and as for these unfortunates&#44; whatever they may
                allege for themselves&#44; they cer&#8211; tainly cannot claim to be
                disinterested&#44; whilst they occupy positions which as Jews would have been

                discuss the subject of apos&#8211; tacies&#44; and it is only incidentally that I
                alluded to it. It is to the unsettling of principles occasioned by the factious
                censure of all that is ancient that I wished to call your attention. In good olden
                days there was a uniformity of conduct among all Israelites in all es&#8211; sential
                points of action. There may have been spec&#8211; ulative differences &#40;for we do
                not fetter the reason&#41; entertained by many who still acted all alike&#59; but
                the difference went no farther than thinking&#44; and for thought we are responsible
                to God alone. But when you w&#8211;ere in a Jewish community&#44; there was no one
                who did not observe the duties relating to the person&#44; who neglected his prayers
                at the stated times&#44; who profaned the Sabbath&#44; or who would defile himself
                by the presence in his house of aught that is prohibited to us in the law. In modern
                times we have seen a woful change produced in all this. Many observe none of the
                personal duties&#44; neither Tephillin nor Mezuzah are in their houses&#59; the
                times of prayer pass without thought on the Creator&#59; the meal is devoured&#44;
                but they say not &#34; Blessed be the Giver of this bread&#44; blessed be He who
                gives us food&#59;&#34; the Sabbath is to them a day of labour&#44; the festivals
                are seasons for ac&#8211; quiring wealth&#59; and their household is defiled by the
                presence of food prohibited by the law of Moses&#44; and they seek not for sanctity
                by separating themselves from things unclean by the Lord&#39;s command. I could
                easily extencNthe catalogue of modern transgressions&#44; but it is needless to do
                more than call your attention to what all of you know as well as I can tell them

                It may be that a hun&#8211; dred years ago observances were uselessly
                multiplied&#58; but how does this excuse the laxity which has crept in&#63; is this

                except the change of heart&#44; which is at last the only thing which can reproduce
                the ancient conformity. Look at those who are yet imbued with the old spirit&#44;

                which illuminates all their hfe. What is it to them that they are poor &#63; that

                Now look upon our modern fashionable Judaism&#44; which finds all its glory in being
                so much like the gentile system&#44; which requires the synagogue to be simply an
                imita&#8211; tion of a church&#44; with only some few modifications in the words of
                the prayers to make it a little varying from the Unitarian mode of worship &#58; and
                what does it produce &#63; Irreligious men&#44; cold thinkers&#44; those dead to
                faitli&#44; indifferent to every Jewish hope. Those are produced in its bosom&#44;
                who do not hope for the res&#8211; toration of our national glory&#44; who deem it
                treason to the state to look for the coming of the Messiah &#58; when in truth this
                hope nowise interferes with our duties toward the country of which we are citizens
                or subjects&#44; and of which we are an integral portion whilst we live under its
                protection. But to hear one of the new adventurers in religious experiment&#44; and
                to listen to his declamation about the necessity of Is&#8211; raelites becoming good
                citizens&#44; and his renouncing any special good for his people as a nation&#44; it
                were enough to make the uninformed think that ancient Judaism is inimical to the
                state. But our reformers must know that they are dealing with shadows &#59;
                Ju&#8211; daism&#44; messianic Judaism I speak of&#44; that which thinks all that we
                see a forerunner of great and glo&#8211; rious events&#44; is the religion of peace
                to all mankind &#59; the Rabbis teach &#34; The law of the country is law&#44;&#34;
                and a great leader among us told his sons among other matters as his dying
                injunctions&#44; &#34; Do not avoid paying the public imposts.&#34; These two
                instances&#44; if no more even could be found in all our writings&#44; would be
                enough to demonstrate what the rabbinists considered as the duty of Israel to the
                state &#59; and <pb n="82"/> 82 THE TRUE WAY. hence that a belief in the dogmas of
                our church as we have received them&#44; is in no manner clashing with the duties we
                owe to the countries of our birth and adoption. Not he is a true Israelite who is a
                traitor to the country that gives him shelter and protection &#59; not he is a true
                son of Jacob who does not pray for the welfare and peace&#63; of the place where he
                rears his offspring&#44; and where repose the bones of his parents who have gone
                home to their Father in heaven. At the same time is he a craven who&#44; for the
                sake of flattering a gentile monarch&#44; or to please a gentile popular
                assembly&#44; stoops to the base falsehood to say that there is no Messiah for
                Israel&#44; that Germany&#44; or France&#44; or England&#44; or America&#44; is the
                Israelite&#39;s per&#8211; manent home. Gladly would we be free every where where
                our God lets his sun shine to us by day and the moon by night&#59; but sooner than
                for such a boon deny what is our faith&#44; what the prophets predict&#44; and what
                Moses teaches&#44; sooner than to be such traitors&#44; let us hug the chain which
                oppression would cast around us&#59; for it would be honourable&#44; far more
                glo&#8211; rious than the badge of office&#44; or the marshal&#39;s baton which a
                treason to our religion could bring us. Our fathers did not deny their religion when
                they were daily threatened with confiscation of property&#44; with expulsion from
                their homes&#44; and with a violent death&#44; because that they practised the
                duties of their relig&#8211; ion. And is this the manner that we are to prove our

                to be as different as possible from what they were &#63; If they honoured the house

                Brethren &#33; In the prophecy of Hosea we read as follows &#58; &#34; And the
                number of the children of Israel shall be like the sand of the sea&#44; which cannot
                be measured nor numbered &#59; and it shall come to pass that&#44; instead of its
                being wont to be said unto them&#44; You are not my people&#44; it shall be said
                unto them&#44; Ye are children of the living God.&#34; Hosea ii. 1 &#40;English
                version i. lOj. If any argument were required to prove that the prophets spoke and
                could speak through divine inspi&#8211; ration only&#44; the verse from our
                to&#8211;day&#39;s Haphtorah&#44; which I have just read&#44; would amply
                demonstrate it. Observe only&#44; when this prophecy was uttered. The superscription
                of the book of Hosea is in these words &#58; &#34; The word of the Lord which was
                unto Hosea&#44; son of Beeri in the days of Uzziah&#44; Yotham&#44; Achaz&#44;
                Hez&#8211; ekiah&#44; kings of Judah&#44; and in the days of Jeroboam&#44; son of
                Joash&#44; king of Israel.&#34; Four of these kings&#44; that is&#44; all with the

                fore its final extinction. It matters not to us where <pb n="87"/> ISRAEL IN EXILE.
                87 Hosea lived&#44; whether in the kingdom of Judah or Israel&#59; enough&#44; his
                words bear the impress of divine authority&#44; and as such we stop not to discuss
                second&#8211; ary considerations&#44; which are the province of criticism&#44; not
                matters for religious contemplation. We there&#8211; fore&#44; without farther
                preface&#44; will elucidate the time of his prophecy. In the days of Hosea there was
                but one people known to civilization which claimed em&#8211; phatically the title of
                the people of God. There were&#44; it is true&#44; elements of destruction at
                work&#44; to over&#8211; throw the structure of Israel&#39;s prowess &#59; but the
                na&#8211; tion had under the Judges and during the disastrous reigns of weak and
                mischievous princes passed through apparently severer dangers without being
                consumed. It was therefore an event not very prob&#8211; able within a reasonable
                period&#44; to look forward to the complete overthrow of both Judah and Israel&#44;
                nor would we have been led to predict from mere rational grounds&#44; should this
                occur&#44; the permanence of the scattered remnants among the nations as an entire
                homogeneous mass&#44; distinguished by descent&#44; physiognomy and belief&#44; as
                the Hebrews have proved themselves. Let us not forget that&#44; when tieroboam the
                second wielded the government of Samaria&#44; the boundaries of Palestine were if
                anything enlarged through the success of his arms&#59; for idolater as he was&#44;
                the Lord had compassion on his people&#44; and by giving them victory against their
                enemies he granted them means of repentance&#44; that they might again be&#8211;
                come worthy of his love and protection. During this time of apparent success&#44;
                the spirit of prophecy ani&#8211; mated the eloquent soul of Isaiah&#44; and other
                seers of futurity &#59; they beheld the avenging rod stretched out <pb n="88"/> 88
                ISRAEL IN EXILE. over Jerusalem&#44; and Samaria&#59; the plains of Jordan appeared
                to them strewed with bloody corpses of slain sons of Israel&#44; and the valley of
                Jezreel the rest&#8211; ing&#8211;place of many a warrior wdiose gory head was laid
                low in the useless struggle against the conquer&#8211; ing foeman. But more yet&#44;
                they saw&#44; beyond this gloomy picture&#44; a time of a brilliant future&#44; when
                the plains of Jordan should be filled once more with happy husbandmen tilling their
                again fruitful soil &#59; they beheld in spirit the valley of Jezreel crowded with
                bleating flocks&#44; with lowing herds&#44; and the peaceful shepherds following
                their pleasant occupa&#8211; tion&#44; singing songs of thanksgiving unto the
                Merciful One wdio has remembered his people. But between these periods&#44; the one
                of destruction&#44; the other of re&#8211; newed happiness&#44; they saw and
                foretold a long series of sorrows&#44; of many changes&#44; of but few joys as the
                lot of their brethren&#44; yet all tending to one point&#44; the permanence of the
                sons of Israel as one nation&#44; as a people consecrated to the upholding of the
                blessed religion which had its birth in the thunders and light&#8211; nings of the
                sacred Sinai. They themselves were de&#8211; voted servants to its behests&#44; it
                was to them the light of life&#44; the breath of their nostrils &#59; they felt
                sorely the degeneracy of their times&#44; they were indignant that those of their
                own people should exchange the sweet yoke of religion for the unbridled license of
                idolatry. And because they felt so&#44; the Lord in his wisdom chose them in order
                to impart his spirit to their minds&#44; that they might go forth and speak the
                direful message of Israel&#39;s destruction&#44; in the name of Israel&#39;s God.
                Had the men of those times listened&#44; had they felt indeed their
                unworthiness&#44; had they re&#8211; <pb n="89"/> ISRAEL IN EXILE. &#8211; 89 pented
                with sincerity and abhorred their own deeds &#58; the temple would not have been
                given up to the flames&#44; sulphur and salt would not have destroyed the smiling
                fertility of the land&#44; and Israel would have been united long ere this under the
                benignant rule of the glorious son of David whom we hope for&#44; whose coming we
                delay by our continued iniquity. But you know how unsuccessful were the
                prophets&#59; they spoke early and late&#44; in Samaria and Jerusalem&#44; in the
                city and the field&#44; in the temple and to the pri&#8211; vate ear of the rulers
                &#59; but the people believed not the words of the divine messengers who spoke to
                them&#44; or they believed that the temple of the Lord&#44; the house in which the
                Glory dwelt would protect itself from destruction&#44; and in its shadow shield the
                people who&#44; though given to apostacy&#44; yet prided themselves upon the holy
                house on Moriah. But as they would jiot listen&#44; what had the Glory to dwell for
                among them &#63; Since they refused to obey the law of which the temple was but the
                outward sign&#44; what use was there for the mere structure&#44; elegant as it
                was&#44; and the numerous sacrifices which filled the av&#8211; enues of the altar
                &#63; The spirit which consecrated the house had fled from the people&#44; the good
                intentions which rendered the ofie rings an agreeable savour were not any longer in
                Israel. The building already mourned the departure of the divine Presence&#44; the
                altar already wept because the smoke of incense no longer was accepted on High &#58;
                and what then did the enemy accomplish with his battering&#8211;rams and his
                fire&#44; but remove what had become a useless incum&#8211; brance on the earth&#63;
                The building was nothing&#44; the sacrifices were nothing&#44; the spirit of God was
                not in 8&#8211; <pb n="90"/> 90 ISRAEL IN EXILE. them&#44; and they ceased to
                be&#44; not forever&#44; but until the time that the renewed obedience of the people
                would recall among them the spirit of the Lord&#39;s fa&#8211; vour&#44; which their
                transgression had banished from their sanctuary and their state. But you will easily

                faith of Israel was an abhorrence to God&#44; or that the law which He had revealed
                had ceased to be pleasing in his eyes &#59; on the contrary&#44; it proved that so
                great was the value of this in the divine Mind&#44; that the very people with whom
                He had made an everlasting cove&#8211; nant could not remain on the earth as a
                uniform nation&#44; blessed with all the prerogative of national independence&#44;
                whilst they disobeyed the command&#8211; ments which this covenant asked of them to
                follow&#44; in their conduct toward their Creator and their inter&#8211; course with
                each other. But to look at the punish&#8211; ment itself which was meted out&#44; an
                uninstructed spectator could not have believed that it was not an extermination.
                Look at the Mosaic polity&#44; it speaks of sacrifices&#44; of atonement through the
                sprinkling of blood on the corners of the altar&#59; it speaks of an order of

                law as it was handed down to them from their intelligent ancestors. Such was indeed
                the tendency of the law which we had received&#58; moreover its object was to
                restrict us in our inter&#8211; course with the nations of the earth&#44; and it

                ex&#8211; perienced wlien Titus led against us the conquering eagle&#8211;legions of
                Rome&#44; changed the whole system under which we had lived&#44; while the Mosaic
                constitu&#8211; tion was the supreme law of Palestine. The sacri&#8211; ficial
                scheme and civil code were swept off at once &#59; there was barely a vestige left
                of the priesthood&#44; and scarcely a trace of the judicial power. Henceforward no
                one that had sinned could bring an offering as an atonement to the altar&#59; tor
                there was no place in which sacrifices could be accepted. Henceforward no
                Israelite&#44; except by sufferance of the gentile gov&#8211; ernments&#44; could
                appeal for redress to the equitable laws which formerly secured to every man his
                liberty&#44; his life&#44; and the pursuit of such an occupation as seemed best to
                him. The pursuit of agriculture&#44; ersc the chief business of Israel&#44; became
                henceforth one from which we were excluded by the decrees of ty&#8211; rannical
                rulers. The Jew in most places could not own any landed property&#44; and the
                following of a me&#8211; chanical trade as a means of livelihood was interdicted to
                him as a calling which was reserved for those of a nobler and higher standing&#44;
                that is&#44; all the various nations amongst whom we were compelled to sojourn. The
                consequence was that traffic in its various rami&#8211; fications wasv nearly the
                sole means left us&#44; as the only task to which we could apply ourselves to obtain
                bread and raiment. It is no wonder that&#44; where so many were engaged in the same
                pursuit&#44; all could not be merchants properly so called&#44; and that where <pb

                love of gain&#44; and an irresistible desire to acquire wealth by all sorts of
                means. If you insult a man from day to day&#44; and give him no opportunity of
                redress&#44; he must be of a strong mind&#44; indeed&#44; if you do not succeed at
                length to break down his spirit and make him look upon himself as inferior to
                you&#44; his tyrant. That nation indeed is yet to be born&#44; which could sustain

                these and many other difficulties which it is needless to enumerate. We have indeed
                been brought to a sore triid&#44; and our religion has been exposed to the

                minds of many&#44; who felt themselves possessed of all the capacities which ennoble
                the soul and enable a man to rise in the scale of society&#44; and to distinguish
                himself above his fellows. ISTor need it surprise us to learn that many did fall

                themselves to the per&#8211; suasions of the tempters&#44; which they had not moral

                quence of the dispersion which they threatened dur&#8211; ing the prosperous reign
                of wickedness in Palestine. They saw the people scattered like the dew of
                heav&#8211; en over all lands &#58; yet they felt assured that the masses would
                never yield themselves to the allurements of the world. They saw the whole tenor of
                the Mosaic polity subverted so far as outward symbols&#44; structure and government
                are concerned. They felt that such a fate befalling any other system would be its
                certain destruction&#44; it could not survive were all that consti&#8211; tuted its
                greatness for its professors&#44; and its glory in the eyes of others&#44; totally
                destroyed. Yet they feared not that extinction would result to Israel and to the law
                in the name of which they spoke. But they fore&#8211; saw and foretold that both the

                space&#44; but reach&#8211; ing to the utmost bounds of the universe. They were
                convinced that&#44; since the temple did not preserve their fathers from
                backsliding&#44; there is a means of salva&#8211; tion independent of the

                devotion&#44; and much as it had been calculated to inspire with awe and reverence
                the countless crowds that sought three times annually its precious courts. A spirit
                of prayer and devotion was poured out over the people&#44; a spirit of inquiry in

                needy&#44; but shut close their hand against their brother who requires their aid.
                And as regards the teachers of religion&#44; they too are no longer the humble

                can make the large things to stand unshaken. &#8212; In the first place&#44; it is
                true that in times past there was witnessed a greater degree of devotion among our
                people than we can find in our own days. The teachers of the people were also more
                disinterested &#59; they willingly chose poverty&#44; and all the ills of life&#44;
                only to be permitted to spread the word of God &#58; whereas now sects start up&#44;

                those who ought to be faithful watchmen on the watch&#8211; tower of the Lord. But
                at the same time it is also true&#44; that there were times very different from
                those just mentioned. There were periods of general de&#8211; generacy when the
                people forsook the path of re&#8211; ligion and went astray after the imaginings of
                their rebellious heart&#44; when they&#44; who ought to have guided the many to

                destruction to Israel &#59; so that these our fathers ate sour grapes&#44; and the
                teeth of their children are on an edge even at this late hour. And yet see what has
                been the consequence of all this doing. Terrible in&#8211; deed was the immediate
                event which resulted from such premises. It is useless to tell you what
                resulted&#59; you know how our state was dissolved more than two thousand five
                hundred years ago&#44; and that it has not been reunited ever since &#59; how
                they&#44; who formerly were rulers and chiefs&#44; became captives and servants&#44;
                and obsequious slaves to those who were aliens in Jacob&#39;s house &#58; and yet we
                have survived. Every&#8211; thing that betokens the outward existence of a nation
                vanished like a dream of the night&#59; the land&#44; to which our religion is still
                bound&#44; was rendered deso&#8211; late and bereft of its unworthy inhabitants
                &#58; and yet the Jewish people became not extinct. Thus the national existence and
                a great portion of our cere&#8211; monial observances were annihilated at one
                blow&#44; at one rebuke of Providence &#58; and nevertheless we have not ceased to
                be. Imagine not that this was any&#8211; thing different from what the Lord had
                purposed&#59; that it was a gainsaying of his decrees &#58; no&#44; it was precisely
                what He purposed. He struck a fearful blow at greatness which was not hallowed by
                his blessing&#59; at a possession which yielded not the fruits of obedience and
                truth&#59; He smote the shepherds that refused to follow his guidance&#44; that led
                the flock upon paths which terminate far from the centre of right&#8211; eousness.
                And the greatness fell&#44; the possession passed to other hands&#44; the shepherds

                descendants of a portion of Jacob&#39;s sons&#44; once more lived in the land of
                Palestine. Elegant cities again sprung up by the shore of the sea&#44; by the margin
                of lakes&#44; by the banks of the Jordan. But the spirit of sectarian division fell
                like a blight upon the homes whence idolatry was now banished&#59; Pharisee and
                Sadducee were the new names under which men ranged them&#8211; selves&#59; it was

                gov&#8211; erned all. Fierce hatred took the place of brotherly affection &#59; the
                teachers assumed a superiority over the people&#44; and the rulers of the state
                hated those who chided them for their neglect of duty. The end was slaughter&#44;
                domestic war&#44; fierce contest of rival factions&#44; and the streets of the
                cities of Palestine were red with the gore of slaughtered brothers&#44; bleed&#8211;

                case for many&#44; many sorrowful years&#59; since the Lord permitted the vengeance
                which such deeds demanded to follow in the natural course of events. They&#44; wdio

                expel their oppressors&#59; but Uke Samson who&#44; when shorn of his locks&#44; was

                swords blunted because their sinning had enervated their arms&#44; and their shields
                repelled not the arrow or the javelin of the enemy&#44; because the God of
                bat&#8211; tles was not fighting for them in the front ranks of their battle array.
                What availed human prowess&#59; what use was there for human endurance tasked to the

                Now&#44; trace the consequences of this overthrow. Immediately active measures were
                adopted by the heathens to deprive us of our religion. They knew that they who
                gloried in the freedom of the law would not be willing bondmen to any human
                authority&#59; and they forbade the captives from even visiting the scenes of their

                were realized in the course of history so far as it has progressed to this very day.
                &#8212; A change came again over the world &#58; not among Israel&#44; bat over
                their conquerors. Romans&#44; Grecians&#44; and Egyptians first cast aside their
                idols&#44; in the mental revolution which overtook them. In the name of a new deity
                to be worshipped in a new manner&#44; did many men&#44; as it is said&#44; of our
                own household&#44; pass from people to people&#44; and from city to city&#44; to
                teach the heathen world a new system of doctrines and duties. With a morality
                borrowed from our Bible&#44; far surpassing in brilliant purity the abominations of
                paganism&#44; with a pluraUty in the god&#8211; head iniicrafted on the sublime
                truths of our belief in the blessed unity&#44; did these men travel onward over the
                land. It is not for us to investigate how it is that this error flourished&#44;
                whilst our truth was suftering&#59; perhaps it was permitted as a medium&#8211;point
                between the darkness then existing and the light for which the world is not yet
                prepared&#44; to assimilate by slow de&#8211; grees the nations embracing it to the
                light which dwells in Israel only. Enough&#44; the new system strug&#8211; gled
                awhile in its infancy against the powers of the state opposed to it&#59; anon it
                gathered strength&#44; enlisted in its cause the rulers of the Iloman empire&#44;
                and in its turn it banished from Egypt&#44; from Greece&#44; from Rome&#44; and
                their dependencies&#44; the empire of gross idolatry&#44; and possessed itself of
                its temples or erected new fanes on their sites. &#8212; AVhilst this revolution was

                It was not&#44; however&#44; like its predecessor&#44; slow and uncertain in its
                progress&#59; but with a daring hand did the new reformer grasp the sword&#44; and
                spread by its means what he declared to be a revelation from Heaven. And soon
                Persia&#44; Tar&#8211; tary&#44; Africa&#44; India&#44; and even Spain&#44; followed
                the Koran&#44; and the venturesome Arabs carried their at&#8211; tempts at conquest
                to the centre of the &#33;N&#34;azarene power. Thus two adverse systems&#44; both
                borrowed from Judaism&#44; sprung into being&#59; it matters not to our inquiry
                which is the most probable&#44; which the most in accordance with reason&#59; to us
                both are inad&#8211; missible&#59; since both claim that as a foundation which our
                view of God and his revelation does not permit us to entertain. But how did our
                people fare between these two new principles&#63; Were they any more friendly to us
                than were the Roman&#44; Grecian&#44; or Persian idolaters&#63; IIow pleasing would
                it be&#44; could truth enable us to say&#44; that those who more nearly resembled us
                sympathized with our affliction&#44; and recognized in us brothers and friends.
                &#8212; This&#44; however&#44; was not our lot. Scarcely had the system of the
                Xazarenes ceased to struggle for existence against paganism than it took up&#44; in
                its turn&#44; the weapons of persecution. It is certainly sur&#8211; prising&#44;
                that a system which was essentially based upon nonconformity with the doctrines of
                the various countries where it established itself&#44; should almost
                immediately&#8211;after its birth demand a conformity from all others&#44; did
                resort to force&#44; when persuasion re&#8211; mained without effect. Above all was
                its fury di&#8211; rected against our religion. Its ministers claimed to be the only

                professors. Consequently they averred that it was their duty to bring people to the
                true standard&#44; since without its adoption the souls refusing to believe would be
                irretrievably lost. So then for the love of our souls were our bodies tortured&#59;
                and where this did not occur&#44; we were subjected to heavy burdens&#44; and to all

                has made strong efforts to induce others to adopt them. Such a love&#44; under a
                different guise&#44; it was which kindled the fires of the Inquisition&#59; which
                sent numberless armies from Europe into Asia to fight for the possession of an empty

                who were suffering unjustly the tyranny exercised over them by the proud and
                wealthy&#44; who considered their strong&#8211; hand all&#8211;sufficient for them
                in their dealings with their fellow&#8211;men. &#34;When now our fathers awoke from
                their long mental slum&#8211; ber&#44; and saw how their guilt had destroyed the
                sanc&#8211; tuary&#44; ruined their cities&#44; overthrown their govern&#8211;
                ment&#44; and surrendered multitudes to famine and slaughter &#58; they did not
                ascribe all this to fortuitous circumstances&#44; to the accidental prevalence of
                their enemies over them&#44; but to the effects of divine wrath&#44; to the
                withdrawal of the favour of God&#44; which had thus left them an easy prey to those
                who devoured them in all their dwellings. Thus admonished&#44; they aroused
                themselves to thought&#44; they evoked the en&#8211; ergy of their mind to
                reflection&#44; and entered into a covenant with themselves to forego the pleasures

                blessed but long&#8211;neglected religion. They thus met in their places of
                dispersion&#44; and poured out their hearts before God&#44; abstained on stated days

                that the Lord has overlooked to let his violated will be avenged on the
                transgressor&#59; and that it is best therefore for man to bear the sweet burden of
                religion in his youth&#44; that he submit while it is yet time to listen to the

                peni&#8211; tence&#44; passed with such feelings&#44; which induced men to survey
                the past&#44; the present&#44; and the future&#44; could have been otherwise than
                wholesome in its influence&#63; It taught the Israelite to abhor the sin which
                banished his fathers from their home&#59; it admonished him to regard with kindness
                those who like him were wan&#8211; derers over the face of the earth &#59; and it
                breathed into him hopes to look forward to the restoration of the good things taken
                from hira by the loss of fatherland&#59; and then it bade him look upward unto his
                Father in heaven as the final rest of his soul&#44; in whose presence all the
                acts&#44; words&#44; and thoughts of life would ulti&#8211; mately see their final
                perfection. To those&#44; therefore&#44; who feel for their religion and its
                departed glory&#44; the fasts of Israel have always been seasons sacred to the
                memory of the past&#44; and incen&#8211; tives to hope for the future. And not alone
                this&#44; &#8212; the true believers felt in humbling themselves before God&#44;
                that in all their trials He would be with them to preserve them from annihilation.

                gratitude&#44; that they reverted back to the days when Israel was a child&#44;

                of ancient times&#44; Abraham&#44; Isaac&#44; and Jacob&#44; &#8212; when He saw his

                beyond which a Jew cannot dwell &#59; in others we are limited to certain

                see our state restored under God&#44; and by his guidance&#44; where the laws

                receive his rights as a favour&#44; where there would be no talk of toleration&#44;
                where there would be no fear of abridg&#8211; ment of privileges&#44; where&#44; in
                short&#44; the Israelite would be free&#44; not because the stranger grants it&#44;
                but be&#8211; cause his laws&#44; his religion&#44; his faith&#44; constitute him a
                part and parcel of the state itself. Under the best circumstances&#44; in the freest
                country under the sun&#44; the Jews are subject to disqualifications&#44; not from
                the laws of the country&#44; perhaps&#44; but from the circum&#8211; stances of
                their religion disqualifying them naturally from participating in all offices&#44;
                or engaging actively in commerce&#44; upon equal terms with others&#44; if they wish
                to live in strict conformity to their faith. Every one of you can answer for himself
                wdiether this is so or not. It is true&#44; every one is bound to sacrifice his
                worldly gains when his duty clashes therewith. But there are unfortunately too many
                who cannot resist temptation&#44; &#34;and who yield their spiritual welfare for so

                state of restoration is not desirable to us&#44; is asserting&#44; that it is

                concluding address of our blessed teacher Moses to the people of Israel before his
                de&#8211; parture from this life. He was speaking to the as&#8211; sembled
                multitudes that had so long listened to his words of power&#44; and summoning before
                him all the classes as belonging to the divine covenant&#44; he added &#58; &#34;
                And not with you alone do I make this covenant&#42; and this oath &#59; but with him
                who standeth here with us this day before the Lord our God&#44; and with him who is
                not here with us this day.&#34; Deut. xxix. 13&#44; 14. Forty years had Israel been
                in training to become a people unto the Lord&#44; and during all this time they had
                deeply sinned and frequently rebelled against the Power who had redeemed them from
                slavery. Stiff&#8211; necked in their conduct towards God&#44; they had fol&#8211;
                lowed their evil inclinations&#44; and thus transgressed the law whenever a
                favourable opportunity had pre&#8211; sented itself. With all this the prophet knew
                that the law had taken deep root in the hearts of his fol&#8211; lowers. He&#44;
                indeed&#44; was himself doomed to die in the wilderness&#44; in full sight of the
                lovely land whither he was not to go&#44; because he had not sanctified the will of
                God at the waters of contention in the wilderness of Zin &#59; he was to leave the
                people in the yet untried hands of his trusty Joshua&#59; the deeds which had struck

                who had witnessed them should have passed away from the busy scenes of life&#59; the

                idolaters&#44; whose daughters were fair and whose country was lovely&#59; and they
                were&#44; what is more than all&#44; to be left to the self&#8211;will of their own
                hearts&#44; when the conquest should be over&#44; free to form alli&#8211; ances
                with nations that knew not the worship of the Most High&#44; who bowed down to the
                host of heaven or the works of their own hands. Nay&#44; he foresaw that all these
                circumstances would work their effects upon his hearers and their descendants &#59;
                that&#44; in short&#44; the curses which he had pronounced against them would have
                to be accomplished to the very letter. Yet his hope of better things faltered
                not&#59; he flung from his soul the gloomy picture of an unliappy fu&#8211;
                ture&#44; and he felt conscious that his structure&#44; which in Heaven&#39;s name
                he had reared for so long a time&#44; would never be totally lost to mankind&#44; to
                Israel&#59; for that&#44; when one generation should have passed away&#44; another
                and another yet would start up&#44; as from the earth&#44; to proclaim aloud that
                they are men in cove&#8211; nant with the Lord One&#44; the God and Father of

                living and known as the Israelites&#44; &#34; do I make this covenant and this oath

                and with him who is not here with us this day.&#34;If we consider that Moses spoke
                to all the Israelites of his day&#44; we shall have no difficulty in ascertaining
                who the absent ones were who are here referred to. They were the whole seed of
                Jacob&#44; all who might follow <pb n="136"/> 136 ISRAEL IN COVENANT WITH GOD. those
                who came forth from Egypt to the latest gener&#8211; ation. The prophet limits not
                his words to one cen&#8211; tury&#44; nor to one country&#59; hut he ranges over an
                in&#8211; delinite period&#44; over an indefinite space&#44; including those who
                were not then&#44; could not be then&#44; standing in person at the door of the
                tabernacle&#44; to give in their adhesion by word of mouth to the terms of the
                covenant proposed to them by the blessed son of Am&#8211; rain&#44; and those who
                were actually present&#44; and had been cognizant of the great miracles of the
                Lord&#44; which lie had wrought before them in the land of Mitzrayim and the
                desert&#44; where his mercy had so long protected them and provided for all their
                wants. Had Moses been an ordinary man&#44; one who spoke merely from analogy&#44;
                human probability&#44; he could scarcely have ventured to make so bold a declaration
                &#59; or if he had&#44; it would to a surety not have come to pass. There were at
                that time too many reasons to apprehend that the polity which he had been the means
                of revealing to the world would soon fall into oblivion&#44; when the inquirer views
                the very turbulent disposition of the people&#44; their but recent state of
                ig&#8211; norance&#44; and the constant inducements held out to them to break away
                from a law which grants so few pleasures&#44; but on the contrary imposes many
                restric&#8211; tions upon us in almost every stage of life. But he was not a man of
                every day&#59; he did not reason from probability or analogy &#59; he was instructed
                from the highest Source of wisdom&#44; and he could therefore not fail of saying the
                truth even Avhen speaking of that which was to happen &#58; in fact the opposite
                idea must be inconceivable from the very nature of the case&#59; since He who is the
                Father of all men&#44; and knows <pb n="137"/> ISRAEL IN COVENANT WITH GOD. 137
                their frame&#44; also penetrates the recesses of futurity with unerring certainty
                &#44; with a view from which noth&#8211; ing escapes&#44; from which nothing is
                hidden &#59; and it was his word&#44; his will&#44; which Moses proclaimed&#44; and
                from Him he received knowledge of the things which were to be. Let us not commit the
                error then of lookins&#58; upon our teacher as a mere historian&#44; who relates
                events which happened under his eya&#44; nor as a suc&#8211; cessful leader&#44; who
                glorifies himself for the accom&#8211; plishment of some mighty achievement &#59;
                for if he had been only thus&#44; though he had combined in himself the learned
                writer and the brave general&#44; though his wisdom had become the fundamental law
                of all civil&#8211; ized states&#44; which in fact it is this day&#58; still he
                would not demand our implicit faith&#44; the entire surrender&#8211; ing of our
                judgment to his instruction&#59; since there might be room to doubt whether or not
                some of the things announced by him might not remain unful&#8211; filled&#44;
                as&#44; even assuming for him the highest power of penetration incident to human
                reason&#44; there would still be a certainty that the major part of his
                specula&#8211; tions would necessarily be mere assumptions&#44; which might or might
                not come to pass. We are not then Mosaists&#44; or followers of Moses&#44; nor is
                ours the Mo&#8211; saic religion&#44; or Mosaism&#44; which is the new term now used
                abroad&#44; in the sense which is usually given to systems called after their
                founders. We indeed call our law the Mosaic law or law of Moses&#44; because the
                Lord&#39;s own messenger gives it that name&#44; inasmuch as he was the means of
                making the&#8211;divine legislation known to his compatriots&#59; still it is not
                for this reason a system of Moses&#44; a Mosaism&#44; of which Moses was the founder

                of all the blessings and hard&#8211; ships which accompanied their journey through
                the desert. If then we go to examine our religion Ave must not proceed as though we
                were entering upon a mere sci&#8211; entific inquiry&#44; at liberty to refuse
                belief to one&#44; and to correct another part&#59; but we should sit down to this
                study with fear and trembling&#44; with a mistrust in our own power of
                comprehension&#44; with a well&#8211;founded conviction that the word is true&#44;
                although our under&#8211; standing of it be imperfect and unsatisfactory to
                our&#8211; selves. We should reflect that it is not Moses who speaks&#44; but the
                holy spirit of our Creator&#44; who has written the book of the law for our guidance
                and in&#8211; struction. For all this we are not prohibited from reasoning on&#44;
                or investigating the evidences of relig&#8211; ion &#59; they are open to our
                scrutiny&#44; and challenge the strictest investigation &#58; provided&#44; as I
                said&#44; that we do not enter upon this labour with a reckless defiance of our
                early training&#44; and bring to the task that humility Avhich becomes&#44; and is
                required of an inquirer after truth. Let us now apply what has been premised to the
                text we have chosen. It is part of a long discourse pro&#8211; nounced at the most
                solemn moment of existence&#44; that&#44; just preceding the awful hour of
                death&#44; when the con&#8211; nexion between earthly life and eternity is

                that man looks hack upon all that he has clone with an eye different from what it
                was&#44; when expectation and hope stood in our way&#44; calling us hither and
                thither to pursue some new phantom&#44; some unexpected vista where success smiled
                in the dim distance. &#33; it is then that we turn with loathing from the idols to
                wdiich we clung during our pilgrimage&#59; we then see the nakedness of our unholy
                desires which would fain roh us of our peace hereaf&#8211; ter&#59; we cannot then
                hide from ourselves the wicked&#8211; ness and falsehood to which we attached
                ourselves year hy year and hour by hour &#59; we feel the ground&#44; so to say&#44;
                as sliding from under our feet&#44; and we stretch forth our hands to the God our
                Saviour&#44; to snatch us up into his embrace&#44; to shield us from the
                consequences of our misdeeds. It may be&#44; nay it is often the case&#44; that
                wicked men will die with a falsehood on their lips &#59; they cannot imagine that
                this life must indeed terminate&#44; they cannot bear&#44; whilst the breath is yet
                in their nostrils&#44; to forego one iota of their assumed self&#8211;importance.
                But not so is the case with the pure and righteous &#59; they have no part to
                play&#44; no assumed character to sustain &#59; they therefore attach no
                impor&#8211; tance to fortuitous circumstances in which they may have been
                placed&#44; but view their past life in all its de&#8211; formity and error&#44;
                conceal nothing from themselves for which atonement should be made&#44; and attach
                not any undue value to their good deeds&#44; any farther than that they mhj calm the
                conscience &#59; and they trust in the mercy of the Creator&#44; that He will
                perfect what they have left undone in the weakness of fallen hu&#8211; man nature.
                So then it was on one of the last few days of Moses&#39;s <pb n="140"/> 140 ISRAEL

                together with the strangers and the foreign labourers who were among them. He
                rehearsed briefly&#44; but eloquently&#44; the principal events of the forty years
                during which he was connected with the adminis&#8211; tration of their public
                afl&#58;airs&#44; and recalled to their mind how frequently they had presumptuously
                sinned against the Lord. He also repeated certain of the commandments&#59; but more
                than all&#44; he insisted anew upon the distinctive doctrines of the religion which
                he had taught so long&#59; and emphatically instructed the people to believe in no
                association in the godhead&#44; in no thought of a division &#59; for that the
                Lord&#44; the Eternal&#44; is one and alone&#44; and that He woundeth and
                healeth&#44; slayeth and briugeth to life again&#44; and that from his power there
                is none to save us&#44; if He willeth to condemn. And wdien all this had been

                still lays before them again a solemn compact&#44; to answer for the last time&#44;
                whether they would remain true and faithful to the law&#44; to the Lord&#44; to
                themselves &#33; The Israelites did assent&#44; and the book of the law was written
                and com&#8211; pleted by the hand of the prophet&#44; and he delivered it to the
                priests and Levites to place it by the side of the ark of the covenant&#44; that it
                might be a witness against them in all future ojenerations. There was no wild
                enthusiasm in Moses&#39;s manner&#59; he was calm and col&#8211; lected &#59; he
                knew his end to be rapidly approaching&#44; whilst neither his sight was dimmed nor
                his bodily vigour in aught diminished&#59; he stood like the giant of the

                leaves are dashed to the earth by the drenching rain. And as his body was
                strong&#44; so was his soul &#59; he felt that death was coming at the command of
                God to release him from his earthly labours&#59; and hence he spoke at that very
                time with the same dignity and candour which he had exhibited throughout his long
                career&#44; and which characterized him chiefly as the great mes&#8211; senger&#44;
                like whom none has arisen in Israel since his day. In this temper of mind he did
                not&#44; he could not think of deceiving himself and others by a pretended belief in

                discussion. &#33; how fearful were the de&#8211; linquencies of our fathers from the
                day that they en&#8211; tered into the promised land &#59; how did they love their
                idols &#59; how did they follow the ways of the gentiles &#59; how did they forget
                the Lord&#33; And what followed &#63; Punishment after punishment came over them and
                their land&#44; and they ever and anon were made to feel the awful consequences
                which follow in the wake of sin. But loudly howled the storm of evil within their
                breast&#59; they forgot the Lord their Redeemer&#44; and would not hearken to the
                admonition of their prophets&#59; and they braved the denunciations of the law&#44;
                and the vengeance it threatens against transgres&#8211; sion. It is not necessary to

                the possession of our re&#8211; ligion has also been accomplished. Israel sinned in
                Palestine&#44; under the rule of the Judges who lived after Joshua&#59; they did
                each whatever seemed best in their eyes &#59; horrid crimes were perpetrated with
                unblushing effrontery&#59; still a Samuel arose out of the midst of this chaos&#44;

                he reestablished the blessed rule of law and good order among the people. Time
                rolled on&#44; and wicked and foolish kings rebelled against the Lord&#44; and set
                up for themselves idols in Dan and Beersheba and the cities of Judah &#59; the land

                of the covenant between God and his people&#44; when they pledged themselves to walk
                in the ways which He had prescribed to their fathers. And after this the work did
                not fail for want of labourers to carry it forward with trusty heart and faithful

                upon the conduct of those who yield themselves to its promptings. It was in this

                thing needful for worship&#44; whilst the spirit of worship itself is wanting among

                acceptable in the eyes of the same unchanging Being&#44; who called unto himself
                Abraham out of Ur in Chaldea. There has not been pointed out to us any new means of

                &#8212; faith and obedience&#59; and these are to be pursued through our entire
                life&#44; on all occasions&#44; under all cir&#8211; cumstances. Indeed&#44; what

                ing to him&#44; out of compassion for the forlorn state of mankind&#44; some of
                those everlasting truths which are the best guardians of human happiness. By the
                calling of Abraham&#44; God covenanted that&#44; descended from him&#44; there
                should always exist a nation&#44; though ever so small in numbers&#44; that should
                be specially devoted to profess a belief in the Creator&#44; which should conform to
                the words of the Bible&#58; &#34;And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a
                holy people&#44;&#34; meaning that&#44; as it is the priests&#39; business to do the
                work of the temple to which they may be ap&#8211; pointed&#44; and to teach to their
                scholars the peculiar doctrines which appertain unto their system&#44; thus should
                the Israelites&#44; the sons of Abraham&#44; exist on earth as priests in God&#39;s
                temple&#44; the entire world&#44; to be devoted to the specialties of the service
                which might be demanded of them&#44; and to teach the doc&#8211; trines of their
                faith&#44; each generation to their succes&#8211; sors. The religion was to be thus
                a privilege&#44; an espe&#8211; cial favour&#44; by which its possessors were to be
                exempt from the curse of ignorance which afflicts other men. We have before
                exhibited how the calling of Abra&#8211; ham&#44; and the raising from his
                descendants of a pecu&#8211; liar people&#44; tvere necessary in the divine
                economy&#44; and how they have thus far best subserved to become ultimately the
                means of subjecting all mankind to the truths which the divine revelation contains.
                And <pb n="152"/> 152 ISRAEL&#39;S FAITH AND DEEDS. not a light privilege is this.
                Think&#44; brethren&#33; all the sons of man are the children of God &#59; they have
                received at his hands life&#44; freewill&#44; and intellect&#59; the human face
                divine marks them to be&#44; like yourselves&#44; parts of the last and best work of
                the creation. Yet they have not been instructed like you. Folly and wickedness&#44;
                in times past&#44; nay&#44; from the very creation almost&#44; have obscured the
                brilliancy of wisdom and truth&#44; and mankind&#44; by them misled&#44; have
                adopted various systems of belief&#44; various ideas of a Godhead&#44; various
                notions on duty &#58; so that error is palpably everywhere prevalent. Men of
                intellect&#44; feeling the degradation thus cast upon them&#44; have ever
                strug&#8211; gled to dispel the mist&#44; to rend the veil which covered the
                nations&#59; but in vain&#59; the mist still continues to rest upon the weary
                soul&#44; and the veil of doubt and darkness yet covers the face of the nobles of
                the earth. Was it not then a great thing that&#44; before our eyes&#44; were
                revealed the fires of glory that blazed terrifically on Mount Sinai &#63; that we
                heard the awful thunders which surrounded the Majesty of heaven &#63; and that our
                ears drank in sounds which yet reecho there&#44; words which at once and forever
                broke the chains of darkness&#44; and kindled the everlasting lamp of life in our
                spirits&#44; and which taught us to know the great God who created without an
                assistant&#44; who governs without any foreign aid&#44; and who blesses without a
                mediator&#63; Were these things matters of thankful&#8211; ness&#63; were they
                themes for rejoicing to the enlight&#8211; ened searcher for truth &#63; Yea&#44;
                they were&#44; they are so to this day. Glorify&#44; then&#44; the Lord&#44; you of
                the house of Jacob &#33; bless his eternal Name&#44; ye of the seed of Abraham &#33;
                for great was his kindness which He <pb n="153"/> ISRAEL&#39;S FAITH AND DEEDS. 153
                displayed over us in bis might&#44; and blessed be his Name&#44; which abidetb in
                truth forever. We indeed were taught by those events which no human power could have
                produced&#44; that there is no god in heaven or on earth&#44; who can do like our
                God&#39;s great works and mighty deeds&#59; and the lesson has sunk deeply into our
                innermost soul&#44; and the events of thirty and more centuries have not been able
                to obliterate it from our recollection. And wherever the Israelite may be&#44; he
                hears a voice whispering in his ear&#44; &#34;There is but one God.&#34; When he
                lays himself down to sleep&#44; there is revealed to his understanding&#44; &#34;But
                one Being rules thy destinies&#59; protected by Him thou needest not fear evil &#59;
                his hand is ready to snatch thee from destruction &#59; his mercy will watch over
                thee whilst thou sleepest&#44; his angels will guard thy head.&#34; And when he
                rises in the morning&#44; the rejoicing light&#44; the hum of the insects&#44; the
                lowing of the cattle&#44; the busy walks of men&#44; will again admon&#8211; ish
                him&#44; &#34;That one God has made them all.&#34; There is no doubt&#44; no
                uncertainty in your minds&#44; believing sons of Jacob your God spoke to you on
                Horeb&#59; He there took you for his heritage&#44; and ever since you have believed
                in Him&#44; and have borne your willing testimony to the truth of his revealing. But
                simple as is the doctrine which constitutes us a people &#8212; for it is at last
                nothing but a single doctrine &#8212; &#34; Our God is one&#44;&#34; simple as this
                is&#44; it has not yet been responeled to by all mankind. The struggle for the cause
                of truth is not yet over &#8212; the warfare against sound reason is not yet
                accomplished &#59; and we must needs stand by our defences till the time that it may
                please the Lord God to enlighten others&#44; even as He <pb n="154"/> 154
                ISRAEL&#39;S FAITH AND DEEDS. has enlightened us&#44; and to draw all men unto Him
                by the uniting bonds of a perfect love&#44; of a confiding trust and
                single&#8211;hearted devotion. Simple is the truth &#59; but as yet Ifhe empire of
                error has not yielded &#59; and though many of the absurdities of gross idolatry
                have faded away&#44; they have in many cases only been changed for others equally
                pernicious&#44; though perhaps less absurd. We are not&#44; therefore&#44; at
                liberty to re&#8211; lax in our vigilance&#44; to sleep&#44;
                sluggard&#8211;like&#44; on our posts &#59; but let us loudly proclaim that we are
                Israel&#8211; ites&#44; that we have full confidence in the word which has been
                taught us&#44; and that nothing which men can accomplish shall ever wrest it oat of
                our hands. We are God&#39;s people by our professing the law which God has written
                &#59; we are therefore his sacred portion from the other children of Adam&#44; who
                worship not as we do&#44; &#8212; we who are descendants of Jacob&#44; who laboured
                long and well&#8211;nigh hopelessly in Egypt&#44; at the bidding of cruel
                masters&#59; and by redeeming us thence&#44; with a mighty hand and an outstretched
                arm&#44; the Lord established a claim of gratitude upon us more than upon other
                men&#44; because&#44; in addition to life&#44; the gift to all&#44; we have obtained
                the gift of ever&#8211; lasting freedom &#59; and this claim we can only repay by
                our endeavouring&#44; in very truth&#44; to be worthy of being called the lot of his
                inheritance &#59; to be indeed dutiful servants&#44; faithful to our Master&#44; who
                seeks only our own happiness &#59; to be obedient children&#44; unwavering in our
                attachment to our heavenly Parent&#44; who watches over us when our earthly parents
                slumber&#44; who provides for all our wants&#44; when we are unable to labour&#44;
                and who enlightens our soul&#44; when other&#8211; <pb n="155"/> Israel&#39;s faith
                and deeds. 155 wise it would grope in darkness&#44; in uncertainty and despair.
                Though we have been thus true to the belief in God&#44; though we have never
                altogether fallen off upon the ways of error &#58; still it is proper that every
                in&#8211; dividual Israelite ask himself&#44; from time to time&#44; &#34; Have I so
                deported myself as becomes a member of the heritage of the Lord &#63; Have I been
                faithful to my trust &#63; Have I honoured the name of my Maker&#63;&#34; Alas &#33;
                to such questions of self&#8211;examination what can we answer &#63; what can the
                best of us aver in extenua&#8211; tion when the Lord comes to judge&#44; when the
                Infinite demands an account of our doings on earth &#63; The law which constitutes
                us Israelites has been confided to us solely for our own welfare. It must not be
                lost sight of that&#44; for himself&#44; our God could well dispense with our
                service&#59; for&#44; if we sin&#44; we cannot mar his happiness&#59; if we are
                righteous&#44; what do we add to his glory &#63; And withal this&#44; how have Ave
                conducted ourselves from the day of our first institution as a people&#44; from the
                day that we each took our position as intelligent asrents in the ranks of
                mankind&#63; The truth will force itself upon our conviction that&#44; as a
                people&#44; we have ever neglected the obedience due to our Benefactor&#44; and&#44;
                as individuals&#44; we have not ful&#8211; filled the demands which our Father has a
                right to exact at our hands. There is always one delusive idea which has led so many
                to destruction &#58; it is&#44; that belief is everything&#44; acts&#44;
                ceremonies&#44; or actual obedi&#8211; ence nothing. Were it&#44; to discuss this
                subject as its importance deserves&#44; that a man had ordained our laws&#44; it
                might&#44; perhaps&#44; be pardonable in us to select from our system what we will
                keep and what we will <pb n="156"/> 156 ISRAEL&#39;S FAITH AND DEEDS. reject&#59;
                there might&#44; in that case&#44; be little acts which could safely be
                neglected&#44; and important deeds which should claim our especial attention. But
                this is not our case&#59; no man originated our duties&#44; no human reason invented
                our belief. In both these branches it is God alike who speaks to his portion&#44;
                his people. He assigns in both the lot for Jacob his heritage. When he says&#44;
                &#34; On the first day of the seventh month ye shall have a holy convocation&#59; no
                manner of work shall ye do&#59; it shall be a day of the sound&#8211; ing of the
                cornet unto you&#44;&#34; lie deserves as much attention&#44; as when He proclaims
                himself the Lord Eternal&#44; who had redeemed us from the iron furnace out of
                Egypt. In &#34; Thou shalt make thyself fringes on the four corners of thy garment
                wherewith thou coverest thyself&#34; He expresses as much his absolute will&#44; as
                when He ordains&#44; &#34; Remember the Sabbath to keep it holy.&#34; To us one act
                may appear great&#44; one idea more sublime than the other&#59; but what is our
                reason that we should confide in it&#63; is our judg&#8211; ment always so certain
                in mere earthly affairs&#44; that we could safely confide our eternal peace to so
                frail a refuge&#63; How vain is our thinking&#44; how painful our unassisted
                reflection&#44; our own research in pursuit of physical discoveries in the ordinary
                affairs of life&#59; how often are we compelled to throw aside all that we have done
                already as labour lost&#59; and when ap&#8211; parently near the end of our
                goal&#44; how often are we forced to commence anew&#44; with no better hopes of
                avoiding failure&#44; the painful toil without which we cannot succeed at all&#63;
                And still&#44; in matters of re&#8211; ligion&#44; our judgment is to be
                infallible&#44; our own opinion our unerring guide &#33; It requires no argu&#8211;
                    <pb n="157"/> ISRAEL&#39;S FAITH AND DEEDS. 157 ment to prove the fallacy of
                such reasoning&#59; the very statement of the case is refutation enough of this
                per&#8211; nicious self&#8211;delusion. It becomes&#44; therefore&#44; our im&#8211;
                perative duty to measure our obligations&#44; not by our reasoning&#44; but by the
                evident record of the Bible&#44; and the explanation which we have received
                concern&#8211; ing the same from our forefathers. We must&#44; in short&#44; take
                for our direction what God has taught&#44; and endeavour to shape our course
                nndeviatingly by this blessed guiding&#8211;star&#44; which has been assigned to us
                to render sure our steps upon the dangerous road of life&#44; and to bring the
                tossed bark of our national hopes&#44;. in its tempestuous voyage upon the
                treacherous ocean of human events&#44; to the secure haven of rest. And let
                history&#44; both individual and national&#44; speak for us&#44; whether there is
                not always safety in adhering closely to the observances&#44; and death&#44;
                yea&#44; death and destruction&#44; in the deviation from the statutes which the
                Lord has written for our improvement. It is true that there may be unenlightened men
                who cling to mere ceremonials&#44; the mere outside of religion&#44; as the spirit
                thereof&#44; who see nothing in a ceremony but the act itself&#44; whilst the
                essence&#44; the reason of its institution&#44; is hidden from their eyes. But&#44;
                foolish as these are&#44; they are only guilty of the same folly&#44; which the
                worldlings commit in neglect&#8211; ing the observances&#44; because they see
                nothing therein of paramount importance &#59; for these&#44; too&#44; omit to look
                into the esseace of the religion of God. Let us see. &#34;What did God wish to
                establish by choosing Israel&#63; a monotheistic race&#44; a people believing in one
                God&#44; confiding in no other saviour than the Creator him&#8211; self&#44; who
                proclaimed to themselves his law. What VOL. VI. 14 <pb n="158"/> 158 ISRAEL&#39;S
                FAITH AND DEEDS. was the condition of mankind at that period and since &#63; A
                constant struggling to destroy this faith&#44; and to build up in its stead a series
                of errors&#44; all more or less pernicious in their nature&#59; because they hated
                and yet hate the religion of Israel. For the belief in a simple unity destroys at
                once all artificial systems of theology &#58; as soon as you have once heard what
                our religion is&#44; you understand it just as well as the most learned. There is an
                end to fraud&#44; to ty&#8211; ranny over the spirit. This&#44; however&#44; it was
                precisely wdiat God intended to teach &#58; all his people should alike know
                Him&#44; as they were all alike bound to serve Him. When&#44; therefore&#44; this
                religion became known to the world without&#44; it was met at every step by the
                contempt&#44; the ridicule&#44; and&#44; not rarely&#44; the persecu&#8211; tion of
                those who differed from us. How was it&#44; then&#44; to be preserved intact amidst
                this unceasing warfare &#63; Was there to be exerted a constant miraculous
                power&#44; to act as an antagonizing principle to the opposition it had to contend
                against&#63; How otherwise could the few monotheists be preserved and distinguished
                among the many who believed&#44; and still believe&#44; in a plurality of gods in
                some shape or other&#63; The Lord&#44; therefore&#44; chose his own means to
                perpetuate his religion &#59; He bound it tirmly and forever to certain
                observances&#44; which should distinguish his followers among mankind as a people
                peculiarly devoted to his service. So we find with circumcision&#44; &#34; Walk

                that you may remember&#44; and do all my commandments&#44; and be holy unto your
                God.&#34; AVe could multiply proofs&#59; but it is enough&#44; with what has been
                adduced already&#44; to establish as an incontrovertible fact&#44; that the
                cere&#8211; monial observances have a meaning far above the mere act which is
                produced by them &#59; they are to re&#8211; vert back on the spirit&#44; render it
                free from the pollu&#8211; tion of the external world&#44; by ever and anon
                impress&#8211; ing on it the recollection of God&#44; of his miracles&#44; and of
                his revelation. Observe&#44; brethren&#44; on every occa&#8211; sion wherein
                Moses&#44; by the order of God&#44; gives a prominent reason for any observance&#44;
                it is&#44; that we have been bondmen&#44; meaning the iict is demanded as an
                evidence of gratitude&#44; because we have received signal and undeserved benefits
                from our God and King. The observance&#44; moreover&#44; of the precepts will
                necessarily make a distinction between us who practise them&#44; and those who are
                not bound thereby. The heathen&#44; the Mahomedan&#44; the Nazarene&#44; can have no

                and the other festivals&#59; they are meaningless to them &#59; they have never been

                backsliding children &#33; why will you die&#44; O house of Israel &#63;&#34; To
                them it would be useless to fast an en&#8211; tire day without bread&#44; without
                water to pass their lips&#59; but our fotliers sinned grievously after receiving the
                law on Iloreb&#59; they speedily departed from the good way&#44; and made themselves

                spent in prayer by the prophet&#44; tliat it was the pleasure of the Most High to
                stay the just indignation&#44; and to withhold the destruction which had been
                deserved by the senseless mnltitude&#59; and to have a constaiit memorial of the
                pardoning mercy of God&#44; lie insti&#8211; tuted the tenth day of the seventh
                month as a perpetual ordinance&#44; for a fast throughout our generations in all our
                dwellings. To fast&#44; then&#44; is to acknowledge before the Searcher of hearts
                that we acknowledge our unworthiness &#59; and our dwelling an entire day in
                God&#39;s house is a confession that we prize his favour above all other treasures
                &#59; and we shall then also be reminded of the sublime experience of Israel in all
                ages&#44; that it was one God who rendered our limbs free from slavery&#59; one God
                and the same Being who delivered our souls from the bonds of darkness by the
                publication of his law&#59; and one God and the same Being who&#44; undeserving
                though we were&#44; blotted out our sins without demanding sacrifice or
                atonement&#44; and refused thus to exterminate those who had so daringly defied his
                holy will. This ordinance was to be observed throughout all times&#44; in all places
                &#58; what is this but to say&#44; that everywhere there is one and only one God
                &#63; at all times there is and can only be one revelation &#63; Thus the ideas of
                the Unity and Revelation were to go hand in hand&#44; and together they <pb n="161"

                abundant light and peace&#44; and render them forever and aye free from the
                corruptions of superstition&#44; idolatry&#44; and false belief&#44; those awful
                plagues of the mind&#44; which have at all times exerted so baneful an influ&#8211;
                ence on the souls of men&#44; and the fate of empires. The few observations just
                laid before you on one branch of the ceremonies&#44; could easily be extended to all
                others &#58; the illustrations chosen were merely those that first presented
                themselves to my mind&#44; without much weighing whether better and stronger ones
                might not readily be found. So pure is the re&#8211; ligion of Heaven&#44; that it
                requires no eloquent defence to the thinking&#59; and could all men be only equally
                instructed&#44; it would assume at once the empire over all souls&#44; and banish in
                a moment all error from the face of the earth. That this will ultimately result in
                the course of events&#44; admits of no possible doubt&#59; for God has spoken&#58;
                &#34;On that day the Lord shall be acknowledged one&#44; and his name shall be
                one.&#34; It might perhaps then be that the ceremonies&#44; being no&#44; longer of
                the important signification which they were hitherto&#44; could be safely abolished
                or supplied by others of God&#39;s ordaining. But this too is doubtful&#44; and we
                have no evidence that any changes will ever be made in our religion&#44; as regards
                Israel. At all events now the causes of the institution yet operate&#59; we are to
                this hour surrounded by those who differ widely from us&#44; whose thoughts of God
                are not those which the Bible contains&#44; and who reject the law of Israel. If we

                or to the left from the way which the Lord our God has commanded us. Every
                action&#44; even the smallest&#44; performed in the name and unto the glory of

                Brethren&#33; we are standing this day at the com&#8211; mencement of a new year
                from the creation. A few hours ago we hailed the coming season&#44; and prayed <pb

                abundance from before the God of our fathers. Let us hope that He has heard our

                grave&#44; which is destined to receive us when our earthly pilgrimage is drawn to a

                how shall mortals speak thy praise&#63; Our eyes have not seen Thee&#44; so that we
                could represent Thee by any outward image&#59; and our reason is too weak to
                comprehend the workings of thy unbounded understanding&#44; which comprises all in
                one view&#44; which surveys the innermost thoughts of man and the most secret things
                of nature. Shall we recount what we deem thy greatness&#63; shall we chaunt thy
                glory as we deem it fitting &#63; How inade&#8211; quate even then would our words
                be&#44; how powerless the speech which Thou hast given us &#33; Silence is therefore
                the only meed of praise which the son of earth can bring to Thee&#44; the
                acknowledgment that he cannot express what he conceives commensurate with thy
                greatness&#44; that his thoughts cannot fly up&#8211; wards to the height of thy
                throne. Yet we cannot forbear to speak of Thee&#44; when we survey the heavens and
                the earth which Thou hast formed &#59; the sun and the moon&#44; which are radiant
                by thy light&#59; the fields <pb n="165"/> SPIRIT AND PRACTICE. 165 which are
                clothed with verdure hy thy bountiful hand&#59; the skies which drop with rain&#44;
                which distil the dew by Thee spread abroad. Yea&#44; we speak of Thee&#44; as the
                child does of his father whose kindness he perceives&#44; but the extent of whose
                care he cannot comprehend. And as children&#44; therefore&#44; of thy love we thank
                Thee &#59; as creatures who have sprung from Thee we feel the debt we owe to thy
                bounty&#59; as mortals weak and powerless of themselves we ask of Thee to aid us in
                our labours&#44; to save us from peril. And O let this truth be deeply impressed on
                us&#44; that with Thee we are well guarded&#44; without Thee lost and perishing&#59;
                so that we may subdue ourselves to listen to thy instruction&#44; and follow Thee on
                the path whereon Thou goest before us&#59; and may we thus be made acceptable to
                Thee&#44; and be accounted worthy to abide in thy tabernacle forever. Amen. Brethren
                &#33; It has been told to you that our religion opens no hope to the sinner &#59;
                that it is merely a system of cere&#8211; monies&#44; without the spirit being
                quickened by the prospects of a bright future&#59; and that hence it was doomed to
                yield before the rising light of a new and better dispensation. But if we examine
                the basis of our religion and trace its history&#44; we shall discover that neither
                is it defective in spirituality&#44; nor has it ceased to be acceptable to its
                Promulgator&#44; and that consequentlyvwe are bound to yield obedience to it&#8211;
                alone&#44; to thd exclusion of aught else&#44; and to profess nothing which it does
                not inculcate. What is it that gives religion a spirituality&#63; Simply that which
                con&#8211; nects it with the highest Spirit&#44; with G&#8211;od himself. <pb

                to be effected&#63; What thoughts&#44; words&#44; or actions are calculated to
                produce it &#63; Must these be altogether abstract from the things of life&#44; of
                ordinary life in which we move&#44; or must they&#44; may they be allied to our
                ordinary avocations and reflections&#63; In other words&#44; must religion leave us
                men as it finds us&#44; or must it make us something different from what we Avere
                from our origin &#63; Let us consider. Who implanted in us onr human feelings&#63;
                God. Who assigned us a sphere on earth for labour and exertion&#63; The same
                beneficent Being. Is it therefore probable that every thing human is abhorrent to
                Him &#63; will He accept nothing that man does as man &#63; To presume this&#44;
                would be to argue that God created a being so imperfect in all its parts that it
                could not be pleasing to Ilim in the state which his own power had produced &#59; or
                in other words&#44; we would&#44; by this assumption&#44; arraign the wisdom and
                goodness of the Lord&#44; and condemn Him for the unskilfulness of his handiwork.
                But we are taught that all the works of God are perfect&#58; &#34;And God saw every
                thing that He had made&#44; and behold it was very good&#59;&#34; consequently
                man&#44; as he was then found and is to this day&#44; is included in the creation
                which its Maker approved of in his wisdom at the completion of all his work. We may
                indeed maintain that in man exists the perfection of the creative wis&#8211; dom
                discoverable in all nature&#59; he is endowed with the twofold power of good and
                evil&#59; whereas in all others one or the other alone prevails. Those pure spirits
                who are the messengers of God&#44; the invisible guardians that are around us&#44;
                who save us from stum&#8211; bling though our foot slips&#44; when we do the will of

                the mandate which directs their flight to the brightest sun&#44; the most distant
                world&#44; or which bids them to watch by the pillow at the head of the sleeping
                infant. The brute creature has no longing for higher felicity&#44; it obeys merely
                the instinct which bids it to eat&#44; to drink&#44; to sleep&#44; to seek
                warmth&#44; and to defend itself against its enemies. It may have higher
                thoughts&#58; but these&#44; if they do exist&#44; are unknown to us. Yet in its
                sphere it falfils the behest of its Creator&#59; it is a part of the chain of which
                all that exist are only con&#8211; necting links. And man stands between these two
                orders&#59; he has aspirations which carry him above the vault of the skies&#44;
                that seem to bend like an arched tent over his head&#44; beyond the distant worlds
                that glitter and shine before his eyes every night in bril&#8211; liant array all
                around him&#59; at the same time that he feels drawn to the earth&#44; its pleasures
                and its cares&#44; nay the very animal enjoyments which constitute the happiness of
                the inferior creatures&#44; which were as&#8211; siscned to him as his servants. But
                in all these striv&#8211; ings&#44; whether they be merely mental or merely
                physical&#44; or whether both these energies are brought into play&#44; he is not
                counteracting the designs of the Creator&#44; whilst he&#44; to benefit himself&#44;
                does not abuse the gifts which have been vouchsafed unto him. How then should we
                become pleasing to God &#63; by abandoning the ordinary walks of life &#63; by
                mortify&#8211; ing constantljc the human nature that is within us&#63; shall we fly
                into solitudes or deserts to devote our days to prayer and our nights to
                contemplation &#63; No doubt&#44; many an ascetic has thought that thus only could
                he unite himself to the spirit of God&#59; and he <pb n="168"/> 168 SPIRIT AND

                his withdrawal from all that makes life lovely he was making himself an object
                especially worthy of the divine favour. Independently of this course being a virtual
                arraignment of God&#39;s wisdom in making man a social being&#44; it would&#44; if
                generally followed&#44; destroy the human race from the earth&#44; and render
                populous towns heaps of ruins&#44; and smiling fields howling desolations. And it
                will not do to argue&#44; that this duty of a spiritual existence is incum&#8211;
                bent on the few elect only &#59; for this would be to assert that different duties
                were assigned to different men &#59; whereas&#44; if we take the Bible for our
                guide&#44; we shall discover that there is but one law and one species of ordinance
                for all believers. There are&#44; it is true&#44; dif&#8211; ferent duties assigned
                to different individuals&#44; so far as their public character is concerned&#59; but
                in per&#8211;&#44; sonal acts of righteousness there is no difference what&#8211;
                ever between the young and the old&#44; the slave and the prince &#59; all are alike
                children of the Creator&#44; all are alike objects of his care. So then it must be
                clear that as men we must be pleasing to God&#44; as persons living in society&#44;
                as mem&#8211; bers of the human family who have rights and de&#8211; mands upon
                others&#44; and duties and obligations to dis&#8211; charge towards all their
                fellow&#8211;beings. If therefore we wish to learn how to become united to the
                Spirit&#44; or to lead a spiritual life&#44; we shall find that it must be done by
                our ordinary thoughts&#44; words&#44; and actions &#58; these&#44; wdien only used

                explain them to us in a manner to satisfy us that we have given some rational

                Ijow certain agents are uncongenial to animated ex&#8211; istence&#44; how the very

                to this curious conforma&#8211; tion which constitutes our existence here. And with
                these facts before us&#44; we would still pretend to judge our Maker&#39;s work
                &#63; to criticize the Creator&#39;s ways &#63; What does therefore our religion
                teach us &#63; Simply&#44; that at all times and under all circumstances we should
                refer our cause to Him&#44; to rely upon his mercy to aid us&#44; if aid be the
                thing best suited to our ultimate happiness. &#34; Though He slay me&#44; yet would

                his breath had become corrupt&#44; and his friends had forsiiken him. It impresses
                us with the conviction that we are not suffering without a bene&#8211; ficial
                object&#59; but that as the refiner melts the metal which he desires to purify of
                foreign admixture&#44; thus does the Lord send us tribulations to cleanse us in the
                furnace of affliction&#44; that we may proceed thence purified of the leprosy of
                wickedness which so often attaches itself to us in our moments of ease and

                to which the sons of Israel must sub&#8211; scribe if they desire to be faithful.

                that one of the animated beings for whom Providence expresses an especial
                solicitude. Moreover they obtained herewith the permission to convert the animals

                nor to par&#8211; take of an animal till its life be extinct. But to Is&#8211; rael
                a new dispensation was afterwards given. Ani&#8211; mal flesh might be eaten as
                before&#59; certain classes however were interdicted&#44; because the Lord had
                sep&#8211; arated them unto us as unclean. The table of the Master of the universe
                is abundantly decked with viands of a thousand forms. He invites his servants to the
                banquet&#59; they are welcome guests in his do&#8211; main &#59; but He tries their
                faith whether they will fol&#8211; low Him&#44; or obey merely the blind instinct of

                tokens whether we will follow the Lord who is wise&#44; great&#44; and good &#63;
                Wise in that He dis&#8211; 15&#42; <pb n="174"/> 174 SPIRIT AND PRACTICE. played
                unsearchable wisdom in the design of the mighty structure and organization which we
                term the universe&#59; great&#44; because He executed what his wisdom had
                foreshadowed &#59; and good&#44; because he sustains all with his mercy&#44; and
                provides for and cares for every thing that has life&#44; &#34; He openeth his hand
                and satis&#8211; fieth the desire of all living.&#34; And to Him we should not yield
                obedience &#63; his will we should dispute&#63; doubt whether He could ordain such
                laws &#63; be obdurate be&#8211; cause they meet not our views of right&#63; because
                we deem ourselves hardly dealt with if we do what we are taught God has
                ordained&#63; 0&#44; no&#33; it is in our every&#8211;day conduct&#44; in our
                every&#8211;day words&#44; in our every&#8211;day thoughts&#44; that we can best
                serve our Maker&#59; for herein we best display that we are totally devoted to his
                will&#44; that we surrender ourselves solely to his guidance. And by so doing we
                become united to Him in spirit&#59; since our soul&#44; the spirit which will alone
                live&#44; the spark of life which is the last work of creation&#44;&#42; will become
                more closely allied to her Gre&#8211; ater&#44; more purified than the want of
                obedience could effect. It matters not therefore that the acts are trivial&#44; that
                the words we employ are few&#44; that the thoughts are those of the unlearned&#44;
                of the children&#58; they are all springing from the only true source of religion
                &#8212; from a willing obedience to the behest of the Giver of our law.
                Ceremonies&#44; therefore&#44; are not matters of indifference&#44; which could be
                dispensed with when we have greater concerns to occupy our time&#44; when we can
                bring much stronger faith than hitherto&#44; when &#42; &#34; And the Lord God
                formed man of dust from the ground&#44; and blew in his nostrils the soul of
                life.&#34; Genesis ii. 7. <pb n="175"/> SPIRIT AND PRACTICE. 175 we can offer more
                elevated devotion than we did in our early years &#59; for it were idle to ascertain
                what de&#8211; gree of such feelings would make up the requisite amount of
                theoretical piety&#44; which would outweigh and therefore render useless our former
                ceremonial conformity. We have not in the whole Bible moreover&#44; a single
                sentence which could demonstrate the use&#8211; lessness of active obedience. It is
                true&#44; the Scriptures inveigh against mere observance of certain rites. But why
                is that &#63; Simply because the spirit of righteous&#8211; ness is wanting in their
                execution. So did our fathers during the time of the first temple &#59; they
                transgressed the precepts of the Law by being gailty of injustice&#44;
                bloodthirstiness&#44; pride&#44; idolatry&#44; and incest &#59; and still they kept
                up a show of outward religion by resorting to the temple on festivals and solemn
                days with sacri&#8211; fices and presents&#44; as though by this means they could
                wipe out the guilt of their misdeeds. But where was it ever said that acts of
                obedience&#44; &#34; if accompanied with good faith&#44; with a sincere virtuous
                course of life&#44; would not be acceptable to God&#63;&#34; Did not the Lord
                himself ordain the sacrifices&#44; the festivals&#44; the ablutions&#44; and other
                ceremonies of our law &#63; how then can we say that they are not necessary elements
                of a religious course of life whenever thej are practi&#8211; cable &#63; And that
                some of them are not so now&#44; is owing to our not possessing the temple where
                alone the sacrifices could be brought&#59; but whatever is not connected with the
                place which the Lord has chosen&#44; is obligatory upon us and our descendants to
                the latest generation. There is much more to be said upon this prolific subject&#59;
                we have merely given in this lecture the pref&#8211; <pb n="176"/> 176 GOD OUR

                permitted to investigate farther&#44; it is my purpose to present to you my views
                hereafter more at length. In the mean time let us hope that the truth on which we

                obedience and acceptability which will have a perma&#8211; nent influence on our

                thanks unto the Giver of all good&#44; for the many blessings which this land
                enjoys&#44; blessings derived only from his bounty. In responding to a call so

                has been busy in the haunts of man&#44; to carry away those doomed to fall before
                his sword&#59; but beyond this&#44; the common lot of all men&#44; there has no tear
                been shed over the many slain in one day by the ravages of fell disease&#44; of
                unusual and therefore more fearfal forms. And in addition to this&#44; peace has
                been preserved unto us &#59; and the sound of the deadly artillery has not wakened
                us out of our shimbers&#44; and foreign foemen have not assailed the towns of the

                therefore&#44; that we pause every now and then&#44; to sur&#8211; vey all that have

                thus understand his own position &#59; little is he acquainted with his own want of
                knowledge and power&#44; if he thus argues. Let him survey the world around him
                &#58; he will find men as intelligent as himself fail in their enterprises&#59; he
                will find himself foiled in many a darling wish&#44; for want of the means to carry
                it into efiect&#59; he will discover how constantly he incurs the enmity of
                others&#44; when he never thought of giving oflence &#59; he will see how he often
                plants&#44; and tends carefully the gradual development of the tender shoot&#44; and
                has yet to experience a sudden pang of disap&#8211; pointment&#44; at seeing it
                sicken&#44; wither&#44; and die. And such a one as he Avill dare to presume that
                success is the necessary result of his prudence&#44; skill&#44; and exer&#8211; tion
                &#63; that fixilure was not to be expected&#44; because his plans had been well laid

                sparse&#44; and the climate cold and humid &#59; and then at the centre&#44; where
                immense cities stand as if raised by magic&#44; in a comparatively brief period&#44;
                teeming with a busy crowd&#44; in the enjoyment of a mild climate and the
                refinements of high civili&#8211; zation &#59; and again at the extreme south&#44;
                where cold is scarcely known&#44; where products are plentifully brought forth&#44;
                which are required by other sections to carry on their industrial schemes&#44; or to
                supply their domestic wants &#59; and then contrast the differ&#8211; ence in the
                character of the people&#44; of the labourers which produce the wealth in the cold
                north&#44; and those who labour&#44; but not for themselves&#44; in the smiling
                south&#58; &#8212; and then say&#44; that it is mere human skill&#44; a

                forth so much felicita&#8211; tion and boast among the people&#44; over the
                happiness and prosperity of their republic. There are men elsewhere equally

                given to us&#59; it was his will to shower his benefi&#8211; cence over this
                land&#44; in order to give it plenty&#44; to shield it from the calamity which
                threatens other countries. It is also his wisdom which inspired the wise founders of
                the government under which we live&#44; to confer equal rights upon all the
                inhabitants &#59; which taught them to look for the model of their institu&#8211;
                tions&#44; not to the feudal ages&#44; where a few were lords and the many
                serfs&#44; bondmen tied to the soil&#44; where the judgment of life and death over
                his menials was surrendered into the hands of the wealthy landed pro&#8211;
                prietor&#44; &#8212; but to that holy Book which serves us as the guide of our life.
                It must not be forgotten that&#44; however it may be disguised by those inimical to
                Revelation&#44; the early settlers in this country&#44; on flee&#8211; ing hither
                from persecution&#44; came strongly imbued with the spirit of the Bible. Perhaps
                they misun&#8211; derstood some of its injunctions&#59; for they applied to
                themselves erroneously the name and destiny of Is&#8211; rael&#44; taught as they
                had been by persons unacquainted with our interpretation of the word of God&#59; but
                one thing is certain&#44; they brought with them the stern morality which is
                enjoined on us&#44; and they carried in their hearts an invincible hatred to
                tyrannical rulers and their concomitant&#44; an aristocracy of favoured counsellors.
                They found that the word of God spoke of all men as equals &#59; and this principle
                became unto them the corner&#8211;stone of their political superstruc&#8211; ture.
                And after the follies of experimentalists in self&#8211;government had exhausted
                themselves in the in&#8211; tolerance which most enthusiasts feel for those

                religion&#59; and when the light of science taught them the unreasonable&#8211; ness
                of certain fancies they had at first adopted &#58; there was left&#44; as the fruit
                of their early habits and religi&#8211; ous training&#44; a strong love of
                justice&#44; and an uncon&#8211; querable opposition to any arbitrary assumption of
                power. And though all the early inhabitants of the country had not the same
                education&#44; since even many had been taught from infancy to despise the strict
                no&#8211; tions of those they called Puritans &#58; still did the un&#8211; bending
                character of these and others akin to them in their views so strongly impress itself
                upon the habits of the whole people&#44; that they easily amalga&#8211; mated into
                one homogeneous nation &#59; and what the one portion lacked perhaps in
                tolerance&#44; was supplied by the amiable and kindly disposition of the other
                towards all God&#39;s creatures&#59; and those who might perhaps have desired to
                form the new government upon ideas borrowed from abroad&#44; were overawed by the
                fierce and just rebuke of those who could imagine no liberty where all freemen had
                not an equal right. If even then some might doubt the biblical tiiieory that
                Providence rules the affairs of men through the spirit of the rulers &#58; no one
                can gainsay that the prin&#8211; ciples of liberty&#44; here enjoyed&#44; are
                directly traceable to the revelation given through Moses&#44; a revelation which has
                broken the chains of many nations&#44; and will go on in its mission&#44; prospering
                in its efforts&#44; until the fear&#58; of tyrants and the cause for war shall be
                removed forever from the face of the earth. The subject is one well worthy of a

                to overthrow the fabric of ages&#44; the pillars of which had become rotten&#44; and
                the super&#8211; structure of which had been rendered tottering and unsightly. But
                they were without the proper founda&#8211; tion for liberty. They had been trained
                monkish superstition &#59; and their nobles were tinctured with gross vices&#44; and
                many of them despised all the relig&#8211; ious forms which they outwardly
                practised&#44; and made them not unfrequently the subject of jest and pleas&#8211;
                antry. When therefore the oppressed masses claimed the rights and privileges of
                freemen&#44; of which they had so long been deprived&#44; and when concessions were
                wrung one by one from the weak hands of the rulers&#44; the people knew not how to
                use their new&#8211;born freedom&#59; they deemed it to be inherent in
                licentious&#8211; ness only&#59; the very worship of God was considered as homage
                unsuited to lovers of liberty&#44; and every one who differed from the arbitrary
                standard set up by the mob&#8211;leaders who had assumed the sway&#44; like the scum
                which rises to the surface of the waters amidst the fury of the tempest&#44; was

                There was no element of free&#8211; dom among the men of that land &#59; they had

                brought on the other&#44; one convulsion preceded the other&#59; and&#44; when the

                wearied people sunk into the arms of a most relentless tyranny without a

                lecture&#59; our object can only be to exhibit the power of the word of God over the
                happiness of mankind&#44; and to employ the reflections thus evoked to attune our
                hearts to ascribe due glory and praise to the great Being&#44; through whose wisdom
                guided&#44; the patriots of the revolutionary struggle succeeded in framing a plan
                of government&#44; the chief excellence whereof is derived from the law of
                Israel&#44; and which recognizes the broad principle of universal equality in the
                eyes of the law of all its citizens&#44; and maintains the right of each individual
                to think for himself on matters of belief and religion&#44; and lays no restriction

                but bj far the greater number obeyed the call to arms which their native land or the
                home of their adoption addressed to them&#59; and many of the ensanguined plains
                were stained with the blood of Israelites who&#44; few though they were in number at
                that early day&#44; yet shared to the fullest proportion the perils and privations
                of their countrymen. And when peace at length shed her benignant light again over
                the land&#44; the claims of Israel were recognized by their fellow&#8211;citizens of
                diflerent persuasions&#44; and equally with others they were admitted to the rights
                for which they had contended&#44; and this with but few and limited exceptions.
                There was no distinction recognized in the charter of government which was
                adopted&#44; after the public mind had called for a united administra&#8211; tion of
                the affairs relating to the whole republic&#44; and it was stipulated that no test
                should be exacted from any man as the prerequisite for his admission to office&#44;
                or other honourable employment. We are con&#8211; sequently part of the government

                industry which we had gathered amidst contumely and deg&#8211; radation. One
                country&#44; I speak of Holland&#44; having thrown off the iron yoke of Spanish
                oppression&#44; opened itself to receive our fugitives&#44; who fled from the legal
                tyranny of Spain&#44; or the lawless violence of a chief of the half&#8211;barbarous
                Cossacks&#59; but unless I err&#44; it was merely the privilege of living
                unmolested&#44; and of exercising religion freely&#44; which was granted&#44; not
                political equality. At all events no names of Jewish officers in the service of the
                United Provinces have ever reached me&#59; though there might never&#8211; theless
                have been instances of the kind. But it is certain that here&#44; in this
                country&#44; the Jew was never persecuted &#59; no assault was ever made on him for
                his religion&#59; and here his belief was as much recognized by the organic law as
                the system of any other section of the community. In other words&#44; no religion
                what&#8211; ever was spoken of as the basis of government&#59; and though the
                members of thai virtuous assembly were for the greater part truly devout 7nen&#44;
                they thought it not in&#8211; cumbent on fliem to fortify their respective dogmas by
                con&#8211; stitutioncd safeguards. They wished to establish a civil government&#44;
                based upon the soundest principles of morality&#44; and for which speculative
                religious sanction was not needed&#44; therefore not required. <pb n="188"/> 188 GOD
                OUR BENEFACTOR. We will not assert that no religious prejudices exist against
                us&#44; and that many individuals&#44; if they could&#44; would not gladly restrict
                us in the rights of liberty of conscience which we enjoy&#59; for&#44; alas&#33;
                under the best government there are always to be found men who envy their neighbours
                what they possess in com&#8211; mon&#44; and though such as these demand the utmost
                liberty for themselves&#44; they nevertheless see with a jealous eye others claiming
                the same right for their part. All I meant to assert is&#44; that the organic law of
                the country has guaranteed to us the freedom of conscience in its fullest
                extent&#59; and whilst this con&#8211; stitution endures&#44; which God grant may be
                for many generations to come&#44; we are safe from molestation from the combined
                forces of the enemies of Israel and those of equal rights. Under the protection
                therefore of the broad shield of political equality&#44; have year after year new
                acces&#8211; sions been made to the ranks of the followers of Ja&#8211; cob&#39;s
                God. In places where the face of a Jew was a curiosity not many years ago&#44; there
                are now silently assembling congregations who call themselves serv&#8211; ants of
                the One God. On the margin of the western lakes&#44; where but lately the savage
                pursued his prey&#44; undisturbed by the presence of the white invader of his
                solitudes&#44; the great Eternal is invoked in the lan&#8211; guage of the Land of
                Canaan&#44; and there where the mighty Mississippi rolls on its unceasing flood into
                the lap of the ocean&#44; there too they contemplate erect&#8211; ing a habitation
                for the glory of the Most High God. And they who sought these shores fleeing before

                Lebanon&#44; until it should please the Lord to bring him back to the land which his
                fathers possessed. But what have we hith&#8211; erto done&#63; How have we requited

                earth could Judaism so develop itself as in this &#59; here we might erect
                schools&#44; send out men to admonish the distant brethren of their duty &#59; here
                we might pursue honourable employments&#44; embark in agriculture&#44; and devote
                ourselves to learning&#44; whilst all the time all our acts should be within the
                permitted circles in which they are circumscribed by the word of God. But this&#44;
                unfortunately&#44; has not been our course. Many have become tired of the union with
                Israel&#44; and have wedded themselves to strangers to our faith &#59; and so
                glaring has this sinning become&#44; that men who devote themselves to draw us into
                apostacy&#44; have noticed it in their reports&#44; and as&#8211; serted&#44; at the

                proach from us. Other sects employ all their energy to obtain converts from the
                others&#44; and to extend what they think the benefits of their systems to all whom
                they can gain over. But we do not desire this. We only wish to confirm those who are

                hopes&#44; with whom he has one God and Father. This is the only thanks which we can
                bring to the Lord&#44; to exhibit to the world that we are not unworthy of the
                bounty which we have received&#44; and that&#44; in the days of freedom&#44; we are

                which relates the history of Jacob&#44; we meet with the following passage &#58;
                &#34; And Jacob said&#44; O God of my father Abraham&#44; and God of my father
                Isaac&#44; the Lord&#44; who saidst unto me&#44; Keturn unto thy coun&#8211; try and
                unto thy birthplace&#44; and I will deal well with thee.&#34; Genesis xxxii. 10. The
                remainder of the prayer you can read for your&#8211; selves in the chapter just
                quoted &#59; for&#44; as it is not my purpose to&#8211;day to look to the petition
                of the patriarch&#44; but only to the manner in which he addressed the Deity&#44; I
                merely cite so much as will be requisite for our present discussion. &#8212;
                You&#44; brethren&#44; no doubt have often been struck at the vast difference which
                exists among the religions to which the different sec&#8211; tions of mankind
                profess themselves&#44; and the pertina&#8211; city with which they cling to their
                favourite theories and the ingenuity with which they defend them. Every man is or
                professes to be convinced of the truth of what he says he believes in&#44; and it is
                equally clear that the vast majority must be mistaken &#59; since if we take any
                one&#39;s thoughts as a standard of comparison&#44; we shall find that he is
                contradicted by the great mass of mankind&#44; though his associates be numbered by
                the million. This simple view of the state of man with regard to religion must be a
                source of tranquil&#8211; lity to even an uneducated Israelite&#44; when he is
                called upon to account for the smallness of the number of those who believe with
                him&#44; in comparison with those <pb n="195"/> BIBLICAL PRAYERS. 195 from whose
                opinions he dissents. In other words&#44; numbers are no proof of the truth of
                ideas&#44; and that it is as likely&#44; without weighing the soundness of any
                opinion by the authority of strict analogy&#44; that one set of ideas is wrong&#44;
                as any other which is diamet&#8211; rically opposed to it. That is to say&#44; we
                have at a first view of the case an equal right of insisting upon the soundness of
                our doctrines of religion&#44; as any other class of mankind have with regard to
                those which they entertain&#44; and this would hold good&#44; were there but one
                Israelite left on earth&#44; and were those dissenting all of one opinion. But how
                does the case stand &#63; There are in truth many&#44; and their number is
                millions&#44; who agree with us in our received opin&#8211; ions&#44; there are
                thousands upon thousands who boast of a descent from Israel &#59; and though they be
                in a very small minority if compared to the entire body of men&#44; they are not to
                be overlooked as too insigni&#8211; ficant of notice &#59; whilst those who differ
                from us do not alone dififer among themselves&#44; but do this in ideas the most
                opposite and contrary to each other. &#8212; But there is something much more
                tangible to uphold our doctrines than the diversity existing on every side around
                us&#59; for we do not found our religion upon the disctoveries of modern
                experimentalists&#44; nor on the theories of a&#58;icient philosophers&#44; but upon
                the revelation of divine things which we have received&#44; and the positive
                historical events in which we have been concerijed from the very origin of man upon
                the earth Imtil this very day. Consequently&#44; if through these two criteria we
                can defend our belief and actions&#44; it can be of but little weight with us&#44;
                whether we stand alone&#44; or whether every other child <pb n="196"/> 196 BIBLICAL
                PRAYERS. of Adam entertains the same views &#59; for revelation does not receive
                confirmation from the ideas of mor&#8211; tals&#44; nor can historical facts be
                gainsaid by simple contradiction and actual violence. We set out with the bold
                declaration&#44; that our be&#8211; lief is strictly Scriptured and that no other
                views can be in accordance with the biblical standard&#44; no matter how loudly they
                may be urged&#44; no matter how much show of authority may be advanced for them. Let
                me state at once that were we to live only among Israelites&#44; all such assertions
                as those just alluded to would have but little effect on us&#59; but the case is
                very diiferent as we are now situated&#44; surrounded by and in familiar intercourse
                with those who not only dissent from us&#44; but who make it their business&#44; a
                sort of especial duty which they owe to their own sys&#8211; tem&#44; to draw us
                away from the paths of our belief unto those of the many diverging religions which
                the world presents to us for acceptance. I think it also my duty to state at once
                as. a cardinal point of our belief&#44; that we do not entertain it because it
                contra&#8211; dicts other systems&#44; but because it is true in itself&#59; not
                because certain prophecies which are alleged to have been fulfilled support or do
                not support other views&#44; but simply because it is in consonance with the whole
                tenor of revelation. In our intercourse with the world&#44; you all know&#44; we are
                constantly asked&#44; why we remain Jews&#44; seeing that our religion was abrogated
                by the substitution of a better one many centuries ago&#44; and we are referred to
                many passages in the life of the founder thereof&#44; which are said to tally
                wonderfully with the predictions of our own prophets. Now it cannot be expected that
                I could <pb n="197"/> BIBLICAL PRAYERS. 197 examine in one lecture or even in a
                series of discourses tlie whole of these alleged fulfilments &#59; since written
                instruction on such a theme is better than oral com&#8211; munication. But it surely
                cannot be out of place to review the system of argument advanced to us to change our
                belief for that of any other which can be oflered to us. Let us understand well what
                is our religion&#44; as a system of belief&#44; disconnected from its duties which
                render it a practical guide of life. As a belief it is the original conception which
                man in his enlightened state received of his Creator &#59; it is the avowal that we
                discover in Him the same qualities&#44; the same characteristics&#44; the same
                goodness&#44; the same wisdom as from the beginning. It teaches&#44; that&#44; when
                nothing of what we for the sake of distinction call inatter was in being&#44;
                lie&#44; the Creator&#44; existed as pow&#8211; erful&#44; as good&#44; as wise as
                He is now proved to be by the manner in which He governs the universe. This idea is
                emphatically connected with the assumption that the Creator&#44; who
                pre&#8211;existed to the world&#44; and who continues in existence since the time
                that all was made&#44; is essentially one and indivisible&#44; not afiected by the
                accidents wdiich attach themselves to human&#8211; ity&#44; that He is not subject
                to age or decay&#44; that He exists without an associate&#44; and that to his will
                noth&#8211; ing is impracticable. When we say therefore that we believe in Adonay
                Echad the one only Eternal Being&#44; we mean to advance&#44; that according to our
                accepta&#8211; tion of the word &#34; God&#44;&#34; it embraces the belief that
                there is no separation&#44; no division in the Godhead&#44; that there is no
                assemblage of parts or aggregation of individuals composing his being&#59; but that
                of Him we cannot imagine any descent by the power of pa&#8211; 17&#42; <pb n="198"/>

                divinity by transmission or delegation to any other. We moreover contend&#44; that
                this was always the belief of our people&#44; and that this was so&#44; because God
                himself had taught us this idea concerning his existence&#44; and that hence we are
                not at liberty&#44; either as reasoning beings or as servants of this God&#44; the
                Most High in all existence&#44; to adopt any opinions which could in the least
                contradict this our original belief&#44; or tend in any way to lessen our attachment
                for the same. We therefore do not insist on the correctness of our views&#44;
                because they are ours by discovery which&#44; long as it naturally now is since the
                days of Abraham&#44; might have been superseded by the investigation of later and
                more deeply learned philosophers than the shepherd&#8211; patriarch was &#59; but
                because they are ours by instruc&#8211; tion&#44; by the avowal of the Creator
                himself&#44; which in&#8211; struction&#44; proceeding as it does from the Source of
                wisdom itself&#44; cannot be improved upon by the dis&#8211; coveries of the most
                intelligent men living in times posterior to this revelation&#59; since nothing
                which they can by any possibility discover of God&#44; can in the least contradict
                that which He himself has taught us. You see&#44; brethren&#44; that we need not
                seek for light in any ivork whatever&#44; other than the Bible&#59; for that only
                can be a source of instruction&#59; since should the former confirm the latter&#44;
                it would teach iis noth&#8211; ing new on this all&#8211;important subject&#59; and
                if it should contradict it&#44; one of two things would neces&#8211; sarily be the
                case&#44; either that it does not teach the truth&#44; or that the instruction of
                the Bible had been revoked by a later revelation of the Creator himself. Admitting
                for one moment that this could be&#44; that <pb n="199"/> BIBLICAL PRAYERS. 199 He
                who had taught us&#44; &#34; I am God&#44; and there is none else&#44;&#34; could
                have changed this very assertion by chauging&#44; or extending&#44; or subdividing
                himself at a later period in the history of the world &#58; still we might safely
                pause and ask&#44; &#34; When did this revelation take place&#63; when did there
                come men like the prophets of Israel&#44; full of the divine spirit&#44; animated by
                the wisdom of God&#44; speaking as the substitutes of Abraham&#44; of Israel&#44; of
                Closes&#44; of David&#44; of Isaiah&#44; and of Jeremiah&#44; to announce to the
                world. Thus saith the Lord&#44; there is a son whom I have brought forth&#44;
                hearken ye unto him &#63;&#34; We contend&#44; and history confirms our
                assertion&#44; that no such revelation ever took place&#44; that no such prophets
                ever taught such blasphemy in the streets of Jerusalem&#44; and that the event
                itself&#44; that is&#44; a change in the Godhead&#44; did not occur in the course of
                history&#44; assuming even that this impossibility were possible. How then can
                we&#44; who have received the custody of Heaven&#39;s legacy&#44; swear fealty to a
                creed of which we have received no divine confirmation &#63; how can we search for
                truth in a book&#44; which affirms at once&#44; and must affirm so to have any
                existence at all&#44; that there is a plurality in the godhead &#63; a change of
                purpose&#63; an insufficiency in the Creator&#39;s power&#63; a transmission of
                authority to one who was not in being from the beginning any more than any other
                mat&#8211; ter or spirit which exists by the will of God &#63; For if it be
                said&#44; that a divine descent is possible&#44; since the son might have existed in
                the father from the beginning&#44; we could assert the same with regard to every
                thing else &#58; all must have existed in God&#44; since He has alone produced all.
                Still who would or could <pb n="200"/> 200 BIBLICAL PRAYERS. for sucli a reason
                invest matter with independent power&#63; or imagine that&#44; because God created
                matter&#44; He has therefore parted with a portion of his omnipo&#8211; tent
                prerogative &#63; that&#44; for instance&#44; the creation of all the things we see
                around us has stopped his ability to add thereto as much and more yet&#44; to an
                extent which no human mind can conceive &#63; And yet it is gravely asserted&#44;
                that a time was when all God&#39;s creation was doomed to everlasting perdition&#44;
                until an emanation from himself became a voluntary sac&#8211; rifice&#44; and died
                as a partial descendant from Adam to assume the guilt of Adam&#44; and thus restore
                all his posterity to grace by relieving them from the curse entailed on them through
                the original sin of the first parents of mankind. And why was this done &#63;
                sim&#8211; ply because&#44; it is said&#44; the ofi&#58;ended justice of the Creator
                could not forgive without a sacrifice &#59; and as no human being could be a worthy
                sacrifice to God&#44; hence a divine being&#44; partaking of human nature&#44; was
                required to reconcile God to his oftending creatures. I have stated to you the
                doctrine as well as I can un&#8211; derstand it myself&#59; at least I never heard
                it better explained. If now we examine it by our views of the Godhead two things
                will appear as irreconcilable with the new theory which we are asked to adopt
                instead of our own. First&#44; that God could not forgive without a sacrifice. It is
                true that every sin&#44; no matter how small&#44; is an oftence against the majesty
                of God. When therefore Adam sinned&#44; a specific punishment was decreed&#44; the
                death of the body of him and his de&#8211; scendants&#44; until that day wheu&#44;
                as a prophet speak&#8211; ing in connexion with&#44; not against this revelation
                says&#44; <pb n="201"/> BIBLICAL PRAYERS. 201 &#34;God will swallow up death
                forever&#44; and wipe away the tear from every face&#58;&#34; but nowhere is there
                an intimation in plain words&#44; and we may add by infer&#8211; ence&#44; where it
                is not so said&#44; that the soul of all sons of Adam shall not see the presence of
                God except throu2&#58;h sacrifice. The scheme of sacrifices ordered in Leviticus and
                Numbers is nowise stated to be a necessary prerequisite for salvation. Nowhere in
                the whole book of Genesis are sacrifices ordained as a duty imposed upon
                mankind&#59; and&#44; if they were in&#8211; dispensable for salvation&#44; they
                would have been in&#8211; stituted among the commandments conveyed to the family of
                Xoah immediately after the flood&#44; if not even to Adam himself after his eating
                the forbidden fruit. But this is not the case &#59; it rather seems that all
                sacrificial acts recorded in Genesis were merely the spontaneous tokens of gratitude
                on the part of the pi3rsons who brought them&#44; as a sanctification of a portion
                of their worldly property to the good and great Being from whom they had received
                many blessings. In process of time these voluntary offer&#8211; ings became
                connected with the purposes of false worship and idolatry&#59; and therefore though
                Abra&#8211; ham&#44; Isaac&#44; and Jacob are reported to have erected altars for
                publicly teaching the name of the Lord&#44; there are but few passages which seem to
                say that any sacrifices were brought there. The one is in Genesis xxxi. 54&#44;
                which is rendered&#44; &#34; There Jacob offered a sacrifice upon the
                mount&#44;&#34; though even here others interpret it as if Jacob had merely killed
                one or more animals to prepare a feast for Laban and his other relatives&#44; before
                taking a final farewell of each other. Another is in Genesis xlvi. 1&#44; when Jacob
                    <pb n="202"/> 202 BIBLICAL PRAYERS. offered sacrifices to the God of his father
                Isaac at his going down to Egypt. I will candidly admit that the absence of any
                mention of burnt&#8211;offerings&#44; except the ram which Abraham brought instead
                of his son&#44; is no proof that they were not usual &#59; for in truth&#44; Isaac
                in his conversation with his father seemed to know perfectly well the nature of such
                an offering &#59; but certain it is that no command was ever given to the patriarchs
                to make sacrifices as an atonement for guilt&#44; or as a token of gratitude. When
                however the people of Israel were instituted as a nation&#44; the law given to them
                recognized sacrifices as a part of the temple&#8211; worship&#44; and the
                Passover&#8211;lamb as a domestic offering in order to thank the Lord. There can be
                no doubt&#44; that as God never changes&#44; this scheme was in his mind from the
                beginning as one of the means of constituting Israel a separate people&#59; it was
                to be one of the many tokens of obedience whether they would obey the Lord with all
                their hearts and with all their souls&#59; but an absolute prerequisite to salvation
                the sacrifices surely were not. Moses threat&#8211; ened that God would destroy our
                sanctuary&#44; not accept the agreeable savour of our offerings&#44; and scatter us
                among the nations&#59; yet at the same time he asserts that we shall not be utterly
                cast off&#44; notwithstanding our sins and dispersion &#59; but that the Lord would
                re&#8211; member unto us the ancient covenant which He had made with our fathers.
                Consequently the absence of sacrificial atonement could and would not be a bar to
                our being received in mercy&#44; even as we are this day without temple&#44; without
                priest&#44; without burnt&#8211; offering &#59; and we trust that the mercy which
                punished us for our sins&#44; banished us from our land&#44; overthrew <pb n="203"/>

                sin&#44; whilst it spared the remnant of Abraham&#39;s sons as witnesses of divine
                truths for future generations&#44; will be jet longer extended to us to forgive us
                when we call in penitence&#44; and to guard us&#44; that the lamp of Jacob be not
                quenched by the floods of tribulation which often threaten to extinguish it forever.
                &#8212; If then sacrifices were never absolutely requisite for salva&#8211;
                tion&#44; if they were merely a part of our duties&#44; like the giving of tithes
                and the periodical pilgrimages to the temple &#58; it cannot be said&#44; that they
                were or could be intended to serve as a type of a greater sacrifice than themselves
                which they were to foreshadow&#44; a sacrifice which was to consummate all in one
                great offering to the Deity. For such an atonement can only be possible in
                accordance with a revelation&#44; that no salvation is possible without a sacrifice
                &#59; but as this is not mentioned in any portion of the Scrip&#8211; ture as far as
                our knowledge extends&#58; we must insist upon our position&#44; that an atonement
                to take away the sins of mankind by a sacrifice of one portion of the deity to the
                other&#44; is unscriptural&#44; and conse&#8211; quently not to be believed in by
                those who wish to adhere strictly to the law and the testimony which have b&#40;Jen
                delivered unto us. The second inconsistency is the impossibility of the
                atonement&#44; admitting even that it were recjuisite&#44; which we have just
                denied. What would be the state of the Deitycoukl such a sacrifice take place &#63;
                Sim&#8211; ply this&#44; there must be a separation of wills in the personages
                composing it&#44; the one willing to die&#44; and the other willing to accept the
                atonement&#59; at the same time that the death of the one must be perfectly <pb

                concurrence or compulsion of the other&#59; for if it were otherwise&#44; say that
                the one compelled or persuaded&#44; or bargained with the other to sacrifice
                himself&#44; the death incurred could not be meritorious in the suffering party&#44;
                and thus could not effect what it was intended for. But this voluntary
                self&#8211;sacrifice of the one&#44; and this accept&#8211; ance by the other&#44;
                would argue at once that these had not one purpose &#59; that there could be a
                separation of sentiment between them&#59; that one could suffer some&#8211; thing
                unpleasant to him which the other cheerfully accepted &#59; and what is more
                yet&#44; that a settled purpose of the godhead was counteracted and overthrown by
                the act of a portion of himself over which he could have no control &#59; or else
                the sacrifice is nothing&#44; for it would be merely that he sacrificed himself to
                him&#8211; self in order to destroy his will&#44; which in this case he might have
                accomplished without this useless inter&#8211; vention of the part of himself which
                became affiicted. In other words&#44; the sacrifice referred to can only be thought
                of&#44; if there is a division of purpose between the two parties&#59; whilst at the
                same time it would prove a difference in their state of existence&#44; the one as
                unchangingly the same from the beginning&#44; the other as affected with
                humanity&#44; subject to disease&#44; sor&#8211; row&#44; and death&#44; and
                consequently not god&#59; whereas&#44; according to our religion&#44; nay the simple
                words of the Bible&#44; there is but one person&#44; one purpose&#44; one will&#44;
                ONE power in the Godhead&#59; consequently there can be no diflerence of
                purpose&#44; no possibility of accom&#8211; plishing to&#8211;day what was
                impossible before. We say accordingly&#44; either God was always able to save&#44;
                whether a sacrifice was brought or not&#44; or He could <pb n="205"/> BIBLICAL
                PRAYERS. 205 not do it under any circumstances whatever. To as&#8211; sert the
                hitter would be to deny to God the great pre&#8211; roo&#8211;ative of perfection
                and unhmited will &#59; should He create merely for sorrow &#63; should He give a
                soul merely that she should be lost to everlasting&#63; should He desire only to see
                the misery of the perfection of his works&#63; Is this the goodness&#44; the
                mercy&#44; the jus&#8211; tice which the Scriptures proclaim as the ways of the
                Lord&#63; Surely not&#59; this would be injustice&#44; cruelty&#59; and we had
                better indeed never been formed&#44; than sent hither for such a deplorable end.
                Consequently we must assume the opposite opinion&#44; that there is power in the
                Creator to bless with salvation all his creatures&#59; that He can&#44; if his
                wisdom and justice deem it fitting&#44; forgive iniquity and blot out our guilt&#44;
                as ile causes the clouds to vanish before the driving wind. For &#34; Our
                Eedeemer&#44; the Lord of hosts is his name&#44; is the Holy One of Israel&#59;&#34;
                unto Him should we look in our youth&#44; in our manhood&#44; in our years of
                decay&#44; to let his spirit accept the humble work which we bring as our offering
                into his sanctuary&#44; to forgive mercifully wdiere justice demands chastise&#8211;

                erring men ascends for acceptance into his presence. There can accordingly be no
                thought of vacillation or change of purpose in the conception we have of our
                relation to God. For in the whole extent of Scripture we are taught the same
                doctrine&#44; that mankind can sin&#44; that by this means guilt is incurred&#44;
                that punishment can be deserved&#44; that the Lord permits justice to be exercised
                against the rebellious sinner who perseveres in his iniquity and refuses the
                abundance of grace that is held out VOL. VI. 18 <pb n="206"/> 206 BIBLICAL PRAYERS.
                to all men. But it also impressively informs us&#44; that the gates of mercy are
                never closed&#44; that they are al&#8211; ways ready to be opened to every one who
                claims ad&#8211; mittance by repentance or obedience &#59; that the Lord is merciful
                and will pardon abundantly&#59; and that no soul is lost&#44; if in its contrition
                it will return to our God&#44; who has promised &#34; Return ye unto me&#44; and I
                will return unto you&#44; and why will you die&#44; O house of Israel &#33;&#34;
                This scheme of salvation is perfectly con&#8211; sistent with mercy and with
                justice&#58; there is justice to restrain sinners&#44; and mercy to those who have
                ful&#8211; filled their duty&#44; who have walked humbly before God&#44; or who have
                sought his pardon after they have dis&#8211; covered that their way was evil&#44;
                and leading them far away from those pleasant paths which virtue alone opens to
                us&#44; which spring alone from an entire &#34;Obe&#8211; dience to the will of God
                our Maker. As usual with my lectures&#44; I have been detaining you a long time&#44;
                Avhile barely touching upon the sub&#8211; ject which I meant to elucidate&#59; but
                I also hope to be permitted hereafter to address you again on a theme which is of so
                much importance to every one of us. But to&#8211;day I must hasten to a
                conclusion&#44; al&#8211; though the matter has not yet been exhibited in a
                connected manner. I said&#44; that history is a proof of the justness of our
                religious hope&#44; and allow me to exhibit this briefly in reference to the text
                which I chose for to&#8211;day&#39;s discussion. &#34; And Jacob said&#44; O God of
                my father Abraham&#44; and God of my father Isaac&#44; the Lord who saidst to
                me&#44; Return unto thy country and unto thy birthplace&#44; and I will do well with
                thee.&#34; If we can prove that our early fathers prayed as we do&#44; that they
                knew of no saviour whom we do <pb n="207"/> BIBLICAL PRAYERS. 207 not worship&#58;
                then have we every reason&#44; without any other proof and without farther
                discussion&#44; to reject any system which asks of us to pray through any me&#8211;
                diator&#44; or in any manner which they did not employ. But how do we pray &#63;
                &#34; Blessed art thou&#44; O Lord&#44; our God&#44; and God of our fathers&#44; God
                of Abraham&#44; God of Isaac&#44; and God of Jacob&#44;&#34; or in the very manner
                which Jacob employed in his petition when he felt the fear of Esau&#39;s violence
                which had been threatened against him. He addressed the God one&#44; the
                unchanging&#44; whose promises always meet their fulfilment&#44; whose seal is
                truth&#44; and who never forsakes those who put their trust in Him. There was no
                me&#8211; diator mentioned&#44; no power invoked to stand between the sinful
                creature and the august Creator who is able to deliver. It was not therefore out of
                fear of the non&#8211; fulfilment of God&#39;s promises that Jacob spoke&#44; but
                out of a full assurance that all his words are true and steadfast. Even so do we at
                this day come into his presence. Jacob slew not a hecatomb of animals&#44; he came
                not to pray through the merit of a sacrifice voluntarily made for him by
                another&#44; but as a simple petitioner&#44; relying upon the mercy of Ilim who had
                been with him on all the way which he had gone. &#34;We too come without the blood
                of sacrifices&#44; because our temple is desolate&#59; but we also rely upon the
                promises of the undeceiving&#44; unalterable&#44; unchanging God&#44; that He will
                keep his covenant which He swore to our father&#44; so that come what may his mercy
                and his outstretched arm will never be wanting to guard his children in their long
                and weary pilgrimage. We come as the sons of Abraham&#44; of Isaac&#44; and of
                Jacob&#44; we come as the followers of Him whom our fathers <pb n="208"/> 208
                BIBLICAL PRAYERS. adored&#44; and unto Him do we speak&#44; as children speak to
                their earthly parent&#59; we recount not his greatness&#44; for words fail of
                reaching his being &#59; but we acknowledge his power&#44; refer to the truth which
                He hath sworn unto us&#44; and ask Him for all that we need&#44; for
                understand&#8211; ing&#44; for protection&#44; for blessed harvests&#44; for aid to
                repen&#8211; tance&#44; for pardon&#44; for healing&#44; for freedom&#44; for the
                per&#8211; manence of the law&#44; for the restoration of our state&#44; for the
                light of his countenance&#44; and lastly for peace&#44; that blessing without which
                all other gifts are imperfect&#44; that gift which is the crowning glory of the
                saints in a purer state of existence&#59; and we ask of Him that He will in goodness
                make clear before us the thorny path of Ufe and incline our hearts to follow
                steadily the guidance of the law&#44; to strengthen us in our resolves to fulfil his
                commandments. All this was the custom of our fathers&#44; all this the Bible teaches
                us by exam&#8211; ple and precept. We maintain therefore that in so doing we are
                truly fullilling our duty as true children of the covenant&#44; and faithful to the
                law we have re&#8211; ceived &#59; and we trust that thus we shall be acceptable to
                God on high&#44; though men may condemn&#44; though tyrants endeavour to destroy the
                unity of Israel&#44; by depriving them of the law of the One God. And raay He&#44;
                who blessed our fathers&#44; also bless us with his peace and the light of his

                the Creator &#59; and there are accordingly timid Jews&#44; who repudiate this

                FUTURE. there is nothing really admirable in Israel&#44; and that one nation is as
                much the people of God as any other. In one sense of the word it is readily admitted
                that&#44; as far&#44; namely&#44; as providential care is concerned&#44; we are no
                more in the sight of God than any other peo&#8211; ple&#59; He knows of no
                distinction between those whom He has formed&#44; his earth is fruitful to all
                mankind&#44; his rain refreshes for them the soil&#44; and his sunlight ripens for
                them the products of the field. Still there may reasonably be a peculiar mission
                assigned to us&#44; for the benefit of all&#44; which&#44; as it is a particular
                work to be accomplished by us&#44; must distinguish us in some manner from those to
                whom we are sent. It is there&#8211; fore no arrogance in us to say that we are
                chosen in&#8211; struments in the hands of God to effect his purpose&#44; any more
                than it is boastful praise to say of the earth that she is the instrument of giving
                sustenance to the thousands of ten thousands living creatures that live upon her
                surface. And as the earth is bound by cer&#8211; tain rules&#44; called laws of
                nature&#44; in her functions as sustainer of life &#58; so are we&#44; the bearers
                of the divine message&#44; both IVom reason and revelation&#44; bound to adhere to
                certain distinctive ordinances&#44; which are actually the laws of our nature as a
                people&#44; without which we would at once cease to be&#44; and without which our
                mission could not be made available to the other portions of mankind. We have but
                one source of boasting in all this &#58; not that we are better&#44; wiser&#44; or
                happier than others&#44; but that it pleased the Lord of all spirits to choose us in
                preference to all others&#44; that He placed his word in our mouth and said most
                solemnly that thence it should never depart. There must therefore be a great
                obliquity of vision <pb n="211"/> THE FUTURE. 211 in those who have no kincllv
                feelmgs for Israel&#44; when making it a matter of reproach that we claim to be what
                we are &#59; and little sound sense or honesty is dis&#8211; played by the Israelite
                who&#44; to escape being thought in contradiction to the world&#44; quietly assents
                to the unfounded assertion&#44; that we have no superiority over other men. There
                are unfortunately certain persons&#44; whose courage does not consist in being able
                to sus&#8211; tain an unpopular cause &#59; with them the opinion of the many is an
                iufallible test of truth&#59; and no sooner does it appear that a certain view of a
                question draws towards it the admiration of the masses&#44; than they are at once
                seized with a conviction that there is something very tangible in the new
                theory&#44; some&#8211; thing very detestable in the opinions derived from ancient
                days. Persons of this stamp do not add a very great weight to any views by their
                support&#44; nor weaken their strength by opposing them. Not a century back&#44;
                when there was drawn a strong and distinct line between the Jews and gentiles&#44;
                when a familiar intercourse vf as permitted only under certain favourite
                circumstances&#44; such as these would have clung to the thought of the election of
                Israel as their darling view &#59; since it added to their own importance in their
                self&#8211;estimation. But as now the society of gentiles is easily attained&#44; as
                the lines have become more narrowed and less strongly marked&#44; there is a larger
                mass to be propitiated than the Jews can ex&#8211; hibit&#59; hence it is criminal
                in these to assume any su&#8211; periority&#44; even in a mere moral point of
                view&#44; though it is actually true in fact&#44; and has made itself felt in the
                whole course of history. And as now some zeal&#8211; ots among gentiles&#44; those
                who are zealots for some <pb n="212"/> 212 THE FUTURE. one of the many religions

                restraints imposed on it by belief&#44; aver that it is arro&#8211; gance in us to
                claim a divine election&#44; or that it is absurd to imagine the existence of such
                an election &#58; our lukewarm Israelites assent to this in their incon&#8211;
                siderate folly&#44; and narrow down their Jewish feelings to such an imperceptible
                minuteness&#44; that almost all effects likely to arise therefrom are banished from
                their character. It is easily enough seen&#44; that such Jews are not deserving of
                the name they bear&#59; they are recreants&#44; cowards&#44; men unfaithful to their
                charge&#44; and they throw an undeserved odium upon the prin&#8211; ciples which
                they apparently profess&#44; by imitating and siding wuth our opponents in their
                conversation and acts&#44; and they not rarely weaken the attachment wdiich others

                these faint&#8211;hearted slug&#8211; gards. You know&#44; brethren&#44; as must
                know also every one who reads the Scriptures with attention&#44; that the prophets
                have predicted various events as impending&#44; sooner or later&#44; which are to
                have a material bearing upon the character and happiness of our people. I allude to
                the advent of the Messiah&#44; as the august personage whom we expect is called&#44;
                or&#44; in other words&#44; &#34; the anointed messenger of the Lord.&#34;
                Con&#8211; nected with this advent are promised the reinstitution of the Jewish
                nation in their former abode&#44; the land of Palestine&#44; and the
                re&#8211;establishment of the polity of Scriptures both in a civil and religious
                sense. This prominent feature of our hope of a revived nationality has&#44; as one

                whether their expectations and present views of the nature of the religions

                after them. These patriarchs at the same time knew that their immediate children
                would be strangers in a land not theirs&#44; and that the nation among which they
                should live would oppress them and hold them to labour a long time&#59; but that at

                been Egypt or not&#59; perhaps they suspected that it was the land over which Joseph
                ruled&#44; without their being precisely able to foresee&#44; how they who were
                freemen&#44; and an intelli&#8211; gent and growing race&#44; could be reduced to
                abject slavery by those who had been benefitted by the wis&#8211; dom and
                inspiration of one of their own number. Still now examine the history of Joseph. Was
                he less faithful to his trust than if he had governed a Hebrew commonwealth &#63;
                was Egypt less happy than if he had not hoped that his descendants would quit it for
                a brighter land&#44; for a happier home&#44; where the religion of Abraham would
                flourish luxuriantly&#63; was he less honourable as an Egyptian&#44; because as an
                Is&#8211; raelite he ordered his bones should be buried in the land of Canaan &#63;
                Let those answer who profess a distrust of the Jews&#59; let those Jews answer who
                are ashamed of their hopes. Xot alone did Joseph and his brothers eschew the
                idolatry of Egypt&#44; they also considered themselves sojourners only in the
                land&#59; and still they were men without guile to their coun&#8211; trymen&#59;
                they were trusty officers&#44; peaceful neigh&#8211; bours. But even the man who
                held fimiliar inter&#8211; course with the Godhead&#44; the man who was comforted by
                heavenly visions wherever he went&#59; at Bethel&#44; when he fled from before
                Esau&#59; at Ilaran&#44; when he fed Laban&#39;s sheep&#59; at

                blessed an idolatrous king&#44; doubtless as he blessed Joseph&#44; and Ephraim&#44;
                and Menasseh&#44; in the name of the ever blessed Creator&#44; the Deity whom the
                Egyptians knew not&#44; the God whom they profaned by the senseless mixture of
                image&#8211;worship which constituted their belief. If no other proof than this were
                at hand&#44; it would be enough to establish that a confident expectation of a
                change of the place of their sojourning did in nowise weaken the obedi&#8211;
                ence&#44; which our early fathers felt for the governments under which they
                lived&#44; and that by a parity of reason&#8211; ing no other result can arise at
                our day from a con&#8211; tinuation among us of a similar belief. Now go down into
                the events of history&#44; and look at Daniel who lived during the comparatively
                short captivity of Babylon &#59; and what will you see there &#63; the same
                re&#8211; sult precisely as with Joseph. Daniel earnestly prayed for the restoration
                which he knew could not be long delayed&#58; and yet who was more faithful than
                he&#63; who more honoured at the court of Nebuchadnezzar and the Persian conqueror
                &#63; If then those&#44; who knew the day almost when their captivity would
                terminate&#44; were not less faithful on that account to their tem&#8211; poral
                rulers &#58; how much more may we claim the benefit of such a feeling&#44; when we
                acknowledge that our hope is for an indefinite time&#63; for a period which may be
                deferred for ages to come&#63; To all intents and pur&#8211; poses we are
                members&#44; according to our religious opinions&#44; of the countries where we live
                &#58; whilst at the same time we hold to the prophetic prediction that a time is
                impending&#44; when there shall be brought about a union of the scattered
                remnants&#44; who are to <pb n="217"/> THE FUTURE. 217 form one state&#44; ruled
                over&#44; not by an ideal universal&#8211; ity of truth&#44; but by a person whom
                the Lord will select as his instrument of mercy&#44; equally as was Moses when he
                led forth a nation of abject slaves&#44; in whose bosom hope had almost expired&#44;
                to become a people fit for self&#8211;government&#44; through a long train&#8211;
                ing and constant instruction during a pilgrimage of forty years in a trackless&#44;
                barren&#44; and thirsty desert. No one except a prejudiced being can discover in
                such a belief any enmity to our native land or our adopted home. The Israelite who
                is a believer in the resto&#8211; ration may feel the strongest ties to his
                country&#44; in which he lives&#44; and in which&#44; for all he knows&#44; his
                descendants to the tenth generation may yet continue to abide. He has therefore the
                same incentive to up&#8211; hold its laws&#44; to shed his blood for the maintaining
                of its honour and the integrity of its territory&#44; as any other of his
                countrymen. To this some may object&#44; that Jews have been known to express
                indifference for their country&#44; and contempt for its inhabitants. Without
                disputing this assertion&#44; we may claim as a fact that Jews have seldom been
                found intriguing against the government&#44; even where they met with oppression
                instead of protection&#59; and that the disin&#8211; clination to obedience to local
                laws may have arisen&#44; and doubtless did arise&#44; from the tyranny exercised
                towards them. Who can be obedient with a cheerful heart to laws which consider him
                an outcast from the society of men &#63; who can respect his neighbour that
                con&#8211; stantly maltreats him&#44; and heaps upon him abuse and contumely &#63;
                Withal&#44; Israelites have always been kind to tliose in distress &#59; to their
                ear the cry for pity has never come in vain &#59; and where they meet with scorii

                hands been open to relieve those who needed their aid. And what was&#44; let us now
                ask&#44; the state of their hearts&#44; all the while &#63; What upheld them when
                they were spurned by the high and the vulgar&#44; when the very beggar whom they fed
                and clothed blessed himself that he was not a Jew&#63; They found a strong
                support&#44; and a source of never&#8211;failing comfort&#44; in every age&#44; in
                every country&#44; in the same conviction which filled Jacob&#39;s breast in his
                dying moments&#44; in the assurance that there would one day be an end to the
                hardships of Israel&#44; that a bright and glorious future would dawn upon the world
                in the time of God&#44; wdien those who hope for redemption will not be deceived in
                their expectation&#44; when those who have left the earth in this hope will rejoice
                in heaven over the good which their remote descendants have attained&#44; in being
                heirs to unfading glory through the possession of that belief which their
                forefathers preserved for them amidst the waves of affliction which swept over our
                race&#44; and carried it away as their sole treasure when the fire devoured their
                substance&#44; and the sword slew unpityingly the doomed members of the house of
                Jacob. Yes&#44; it was the conviction that only a cer&#8211; tain amount of
                suftering would have to be endured&#59; that the enemies of Israel would not finally
                prevail &#59; that all their raging would exhaust itself&#44; like the fury of the
                hurricane upon the rocky promontory that offers its naked sides to the assaults of
                the sea&#44; which upheld our people through ages&#44; when to hate them was
                considered a virtue&#44; amidst sorrows which Avould have crushed other nations more
                numerous and pow&#8211; erful than we ever were. I will not enumerate those <pb

                history&#44; for that has been done before&#44; but merely insist upon the
                undeniable fact&#44; that only an internal conviction of better things could
                possibly have sup&#8211; ported us and carried us triumphantly through the midst of
                all our many trials and sore afflictions. It passes my judgment to discover what
                incentive equally strong to uphold our law could have been devised&#44; by those of
                us who wish to inculcate that it would be our greatest happiness to become
                incorpor&#8211; ated witli the Frenchmen&#44; or the Germans&#44; or the
                Russians&#44; or the IIiikIoos&#44; or the Chinese&#44; as one and the same people.
                Politically speaking&#44; we are this already&#59; we belong to the state where we
                live just as Josepli and Jacob did to Egypt. But religiously&#44; even our moderns
                are different from others in the same state with them&#59; because they are
                believers in One God whilst the people around them believe in a plu&#8211;
                rality&#59; they uphold the obligation of the Mosaic code whilst no other nation on
                earth conforms to the same religion&#44; even where the belief in the unity of God
                prevails. So let them act as they will&#44; let them go where they will&#44; they
                are in a contradiction to the rest of mankind &#59; and surely the belief in the
                Mes&#8211; siah is not so anli&#8211;social that it must be rejected with&#8211; out
                acquiring in its stead a feeling equally powerful for good&#44; equally conservative
                of our happy&#8211;making religion&#44; as our ancient hopes. It may serve in times

                fearful progress among those who agree with them in opinion. Still&#44; let us leave
                this out of view&#44; we would ask&#44; Where are our afflicted brothers to obtain
                the inward strength to withstand the as&#8211; saults of the world&#44; when you
                have taken away their strong hope in the truth of God&#44; at a time which may come
                again&#44; at a time&#44; which Grod&#39;s mercy may avert&#44; when the name of Jew
                will again become the pass&#8211; word for death and oppression &#63; &#34; The
                world is too enlightened&#33;&#34; Perhaps so&#44; at this day&#59; but even this is
                not the case&#59; for constantly are we pained at the recital of tales of
                horror&#44; in reference to those Israelites who have to suffer for their faith. But
                even were it otherwise&#44; there is no warrant in the his&#8211; tory of the world
                to assert&#44; that what once has been cannot occur again. It is unfortunately but
                too true&#44; that historical scenes are constantly acted over again&#44; and the
                wisdom of experience fails to enlighten those wlio are acting on the stage of human
                events. Change the heart of man&#44; or else do not speak to us of the impossibility
                of persecution&#59; those who are the many love to impose their thoughts and their
                mode of act&#8211; ing upon all around them&#59; and we have yet to learn that the
                arm of violence may not be applied where simple persuasion fails of success. No&#44;
                leave us our religion with all its hopes&#44; with all its peculiar aspira&#8211;
                tions&#44; as we have received it&#44; and do not imagine that a prayer for our
                restoration renders us less obedient to the laws of the land&#44; or less tolerant
                and charita&#8211; ble to those who differ from us. Our religion is merely to
                strengthen us in our struggle with outward circumstances&#44; both in times of ease
                and in ages of sorrow &#59; and he is no true Israelite who would seek <pb n="221"/>

                tbe belief in a restoration is unpbilosophical&#44; unreasonable. Here indeed is tbe
                wbole strength of tbe case. Our moderns are tinctured with a want of faith&#59; they
                cannot re&#8211; duce their religion to any mathematical certainty&#44; they cannot
                prove by any previous historical data&#44; bow tbe sou of David is to arise&#44; bow
                tbe hearts of tbe people are to be turned with one accord to look to tbe land of
                Israel as their home&#59; bow tbe jarring elements among us are to be reconciled so
                as to ena&#8211; ble us to form a homogeneous state&#44; one in senti&#8211; ment
                and one in interest&#59; how the highly cultivated European&#44; and the

                possibility to effect all this &#59; but what man cannot do&#44; is effected at once
                by the mere will of God. So was the exodus from Egypt unpbilosophical &#59; so was
                tbe descent on Sinai a physical impossibility &#59; but however far skep&#8211;
                ticism may proceed&#44; it cannot deny the existence of the Jewish people&#44; nor
                that of the law of Moses. Both&#44; though therefore not producible by any known
                human agency&#44; were nevertheless established in the course of events&#59; and
                hence when we are speaking in the spirit of faith&#44; though perhaps not in that of

                Support when temptations assail us&#44; and a Consolation to our spirit in the
                gloomy hour of despair&#44; when sorrow disturbs the fair image which our

                prevail in the wiclvcd design of depriving them of that stay which thy law lias ever

                manifest pres&#8211; ence&#44; and let truth and divine knowledge spread thence to
                all who thirst for thy salvation. And this house&#44; too&#44; which has been built

                who resort hither&#44; and bless them with thy grace and the peace of mind and

                this Sabbath it is twenty&#8211;one years since this new structure in which we are
                assembled was sol&#8211; emnly dedicated to the worship of Israel&#39;s God&#44;

                had been taken down&#44; because the progress of events had demanded a more
                commodious house of assembly for the faith&#8211; ful in this city. It was not my
                good lot to be present on that hallowed occasion &#59; but another&#44; whose
                min&#8211; istration was highly acceptable in the sanctuary&#44; and a brother
                minister of another congregation&#44; stood on that day before you&#44; you who are
                still left of that joy&#8211; ous throng that crowded every avenue&#44; and they
                opened with prayer and the voice of song the portals of this house&#44; that the
                righteous might enter therein to thank the Lord. In the ears of many of you the
                sounds of psalm and prayer uttered on that memora&#8211; ble day doubtless still
                resound&#59; but many are this day deaf to the voice of joy or the wailing of
                sorrow&#44; for they sleep in the house appointed for all the living the slumber of
                death which knows of awakening only in the Lord&#39;s own day of the
                resurrection&#59; and the ministers also who were then with you&#44; they too have
                departed hence to receive the reward of their faithful striving in the good cause of
                Israel. New men have been called to fill their places&#44; and the service of the
                Most High is continued by others&#44; summoned from amongst the people to utter
                prayers for them in the language of our forefathers to the merciful Judge who sits
                enthroned unto eternity. And many who were on that day but infants in the
                nurses&#39; arms&#44; many on that day yet unborn&#44; to whom the light of day had
                not then dawned&#44; are now here&#44; a new generation of faithful sons and
                daughters of Jacob to answer for themselves&#44; whether or not there shall be

                our deeds may have merited. And &#33; that when the hour of our own departure
                arrives&#44; we too may be able to feel as our pious fathers felt in their last
                moments &#33; that we then may be conscious of a life of faith and good deeds &#59;

                Name wdio dwells among the assemblies of his people Israel. Well may we boast of our
                election&#59; well may we glorily ourselves that &#34; the Lord is our God&#44;&#34;
                and that though &#34; every peo&#8211; ple walketh each in the name of its God&#44;
                we alone walk in the name of the living God and the eternal King&#59;&#34; and
                whilst the heavens endure over the earth&#44; as long as the seasons change and the
                sun of heaven illumines the globe&#44; so long will we respond to the words of
                prophecy&#44; and be the men of the covenant&#44; the chil&#8211; dren of
                faithfulness. Let not the superficial imagine&#44; that our system is one of mere
                blind ceremony&#44; of cold unmeaning acts where the spirit remains un&#8211;
                touched. No&#44; the religion of God pervades the whole man&#44; it reaches to his
                thoughts&#44; it enkindles his spirit no less&#44; than it directs the deeds he
                should perform and the way in which he should walk&#58; just as the power of the
                Lord is inherent in all creation&#44; and gov&#8211; erns and sustains the laws
                which regulate the invisible agents no less&#44; than the outward products which
                thence result. Religion in the same manner is the principle which impels the spirit
                to feel&#44; and this prompting is then rendered evident by the acts of the outward
                body. And wdiere it has truly taken up its abode&#44; life is a constant succession
                of holy teachings &#59; it is a <pb n="229"/> REFLECTIONS AND HOPES. 229 continual
                sacrifice of selfishness on the altar of public good&#44; and an entire surrendering
                to the will of the Creator. And the words of truth flow from the lips&#44; as the
                sparkling waters from the rock&#8211;born fountain&#44; in a perennial stream&#44;
                to invigorate the inquiring ones with knowledge of the Lord&#44; and to give them
                strength to press onward on their toilsome pilgrimage. And the charity of deeds
                drops into the lap of the hungiy&#44; like the fruit of the palm of the desert into
                that of the wayworn traveller. And they the righteous agents themselves&#44; stand
                like the brave stout oak in the midst of the forest&#44; the mightiest among the
                trees of the field&#44; or like the cedars on Lebanon&#44; in undying greenness&#44;
                and fresh and bright in extreme old age&#44; unchanged and erect at the moment when
                chill&#44; cold death stretches out his arm to bear them hence from the scenes of
                their labours. &#8212; &#34; And is this indeed Judaism&#63; is it indeed the
                religion of the spirit&#63; has it not borrowed this lustre from other
                systems&#63;&#34; These are the words of those who wish to make it appear that their
                faith is purer&#44; better than ours&#44; that they have hopes which are strange to
                us&#59; and that it was our intercourse with them which has stamped a new life on
                the mind of our people. But we insist upon the reverse of the proposition &#59; we
                maintain that Judaism is in truth the religion of the spirit as we have represented
                it&#44; and that it has borrowed no light from systems of ancient or modern days. As

                who casteth down the proud. When the righteous cry&#44; we are told&#44; that He
                listens&#44; and the tears of the widow and fatherless are treas&#8211; ured up in
                his presence. When the thunders roll in the sky&#44; we are impressed that it is his
                voice which speaks&#44; and the lurid glare of lightning is the fire of his
                kindling. Is the rain poured out over the earth&#44; it is his clouds which are
                discharged of their blessed burden&#59; and does the snow drop down silently in
                flakes of pure whiteness&#44; does the hoar frost descend during the night like
                sparkling ashes upon the herbs of the field or on the expanded housetops &#58; it is
                his word which is fulfilled&#44; his mission that is accom&#8211; plished. And if
                the storm goes forth in resistless power&#44; if fleets are dashed in pieces on a
                rocky shore&#44; and the thousands of the crews swallowed up in the deep &#58; it is
                his wrath which nnchained the gale&#44; it is his arm that crushed the power of the
                adversaiy. And if on the prayer of his servants the storm is stilled&#44; if the
                angry waves of the ocean are assuaged&#44; if the roaring billows cease in their
                tumult&#58; it is the spirit of God that has allayed the storm&#44; it is his breath
                that has made level the heavinof bosom of the deep&#44; and it is his blessing which
                guides the storm&#8211; tossed vessel into the haven of security. Wherever we turn

                contained in our form of prayers. Every verse of them is based upon the im&#8211;

                devise coun&#8211; sel to blot out their name from the face of the earth. More than
                thirty&#8211;five centuries have elapsed since these promises were spoken&#44; since
                the Lord said to Moses&#44; as in our portion of to&#8211;day &#58; &#34; And in
                order that thou mayest tell in the hearing of thy son and thy son&#39;s son that
                which I have wrought in Egypt&#44; and my signs which I have displayed among them
                &#59; and you shall know that I am the Lord.&#34; Exodus x. 2. Yes&#44; more than
                thirty&#8211;five centuries have since then elapsed&#44; and sorrows have swept over
                the face of our history &#59; tribulations like a fearful wave have passed over our
                defenceless heads &#59; and still we are here to tell to the younger branches of the
                house of Israel of the great deeds of the Lord&#44; and of the signs and wonders
                which He has wrought in Egypt and elsewhere&#44; to prove his almighty power and to
                hallow his sacred ISTame. And nations have arisen to plun&#8211; der from us our
                birthright&#59; and mighty men have buckled on their armour to slay those called by
                the name of Jacob &#59; but with every visitation we clung closer and closer to the
                ark of the covenant&#44; we laid hold in our anguish on the horns of the altar of
                God&#44; and we breathed forth our spirit still inly reverencing the great Being who
                had called us to his service. <pb n="233"/> REFLECTIONS AND HOPES. 233 And thus from
                every trial we arose refreshed by the grace of our Father &#59; and more pure by the
                action of the tire which had removed our dross &#59; and we felt anew the assurance
                that our Redeemer lives&#44; and that to the end of time He would be our Shield&#44;
                the Ex&#8211; cellency of our salvation &#59; and we adhered to the law which had
                been sanctified by our blood &#59; and we pro&#8211; claimed in our houses and in
                our assemblies our ad&#8211; herence to the faith&#44; which has its birth in heaven
                and which leads to a glorious immortality. When then we are asked&#44; &#34; What is
                purity&#63; what is truth &#63;&#34; we will answer&#44; it is the legacy which the
                Lord gave to our fathers&#44; when He led them forth from Egypt &#59; it is the

                convince us that they have a road of salva&#8211; tion pointed out to them which is
                not familiar to us. They cannot prove that God ever revoked his law&#44; that He
                ever taught contrary to the code which He gave to Moses&#44; or that the way He
                commanded us to go in is no longer one which will lead us unto his salvation.
                Nations however have been taught by us to know the way of God &#59; they have
                learned some of the truths which are ours by inheritance &#59; and the nearer they

                hands&#44; and may thy favour and goodness ever keep watch over us. Amen. Brethren
                &#33; We have before this insisted that the law which God was pleased to bestow on
                his people was not alone intended to give them ideas of the Divinity&#44; but was
                especially calculated to be a charter of freedom&#44; of equal rights for all the
                inhabitants of the land. In many ancient nations&#44; and in many modern ones
                like&#8211; wise&#44; there have existed and exist even now different classes into
                Which the inhabitants of the countries are divided&#44; and this to such a degree
                that those called the lower orders have hardly any personal rights or title to
                property&#44; except what the higher and more favoured are pleased to grant unto
                them. In all ab&#8211; solute governments&#44; wdiere the will of one man rules the
                land&#44; the sovereign&#44; or political chief&#44; has always been looked upon as
                the fountain whence all gifts&#44; offices&#44; titles to land&#44;
                prerogatives&#44; and acts of grace have flowed &#59; it was he who endowed his
                vassals with their estates &#59; it was he who called his favourites from the lower
                ranks and conferred upon them names which separated them from the masses as
                effectually as though they had belonged to different races &#59; it was he who could
                pardon all offences&#44; even the most heinous&#44; against the rights and persons
                of individuals&#44; and annul&#44; if so he willed it&#44; ancient laws and usages
                by his mere word&#44; and enact in their stead such or&#8211; dinances as his fancy
                might dictate. And then those who were landed proprietors&#44; or so&#8211;called
                nobles&#44; <pb n="239"/> THE HEBREW COMMONWEALTH. 239 were&#44; in their turn&#44;
                tyrants over their subordinates&#44; and many of them exercised the right of
                pronouncing judgment against the life of their serfs&#44; and executed it too
                mercilessly&#59; since the existence of such inferior beiuofs was of no moment when
                contrasted with the prerogative of the noble&#8211;born lord of a castle. In
                brief&#44; instead of the governed being the source of power wherewith the governors
                were endowed for the benefit of the whole nation&#44; the rule was reversed&#44; the
                executive authority was the main spring&#44; the ac&#8211; tual state&#44; from
                which the governed obtained as much of liberty and security as comported with the
                pleasure and interest of the chief and his nobles &#58; whilst the latter&#44; in
                their turn&#44; were nothing but the tools of the former&#44; and they had
                often&#44; themselves&#44; to feel the iron hand of power&#44; when their
                destruction was deemed of the least service to the despot. Even in the so&#8211;
                called free governments&#44; where the power was lodged in the hands of several&#44;
                examples are not wanting to prove that the liberties and rights of the poor were but
                little provided for&#59; they who had obtained the control of the state exercised it
                for their own selfish ends&#44; and those who stood beneath them might fare as best
                they could. Far different was it with our state &#58; it was God&#39;s purpose to
                have a nation of wor&#8211; shippers composed of freemen&#44; whose soul could
                as&#8211; pire to higher things than mere earthly pursuits&#44; whose spirit was not
                to be crushed by the irresponsi&#8211; ble will of rulers or masters&#44; but every
                man&#44; every woman&#44; every child&#44; whether belonging to Israel or not was to
                be left in possession of property&#44; of liberty&#44; and of life&#44; until either
                had been forfeited for some well&#8211;known&#44; well&#8211;defined&#44; and

                judgment of independent judges&#44; the choice of the people themselves. It is
                therefore not a mere political declamation to speak of the common&#8211; wealth of
                the Jews&#44; but a truly religious topic to in&#8211; vestigate the nature of the
                laws of our land&#44; inasmuch as they are founded in the nature of the institutions
                which have the Creator of the world and the Re&#8211; deemer of Israel for their
                Author. Let us just follow the connexion of the Scriptural text&#59; for though it
                is divided off in sections and verses&#44; it is at length but one continuance of
                the same inspiration and of the same wisdom which announced the whole of the scheme
                of revelation. To proceed&#58; The Israelites when in Egypt laboured under the most
                intolerable oppression and political subjection&#59; they had no hopes but in the
                clemency of their taskmasters&#59; for when these increased their burdens&#44; they
                found no redress in their appeal to the ruler of the land&#44; as we read in the
                fifth chapter of Exodus. AVhen their cry&#44; there&#8211; fore&#44; ascended to the
                Lord from their toil&#44; lie resolved to redeem them from slavery in accordance
                with his covenant made with Abraham&#44; Isaac&#44; and Jacob their fathers&#44;
                whom He had loved because of their right&#8211; eousness. It was then that
                Moses&#44; one of their own body&#44; whilst feeding the flocks which belonged to
                his father&#8211;in&#8211;law&#44; a man not descended from Israel&#44; saw the
                vision of God&#44; who&#44; by his appearing to him&#44; and en&#8211;
                lightening&#58; his understanding with more wisdom than he possessed before&#44; and
                giving him more courage and endurance than were natural to him&#44; conferred on him
                the mission and the ability to effect the liber&#8211; ation of his brothers who
                were in bondage. But it was not merely to be made free from burdensome <pb n="241"/>

                earth&#44; and to acknowledge Ilim alone in all generations and to be forever
                faith&#8211; ful to his laws. We all know that the mission had its effect&#44; the
                bonds of slavery were broken&#44; the cap&#8211; tives were bidden to go free from
                their prison&#8211;houses&#44; and they actually were brought to the foot of
                Sinai&#44; where they were visited by the glory of God&#44; who communicated to them
                his will&#44; assumed over them the kingly rule which they cheerfully accepted&#44;
                and announced himself as their national God&#44; wdio&#44; thouorh thus proclaimed
                the Deity of Israel&#44; was nevertheless the Lord of all men&#44; the Possessor of
                all thinofs. But how was his divine and royal rule to be estab&#8211; lished &#63;
                Even by the enforcement of an enliorhtened morality&#44; by subordinating the people
                to each other&#39;s rights&#44; by their being a mutual security for the peace and
                the undisturbed enjoyment of his own by every member of their state and society. The
                same awful Voice which spoke&#44; &#34; I am the Lord thy God&#44;&#34; said &#34;
                Thou shalt not steal.&#34; The same Being who spoke &#34; Thou shait have no other

                truth&#44; strictly speaking&#44; the ten commandments contain one more moral law

                Sabbath&#44; the weekly day of rest&#44; is in itself as much a moral law as a
                cere&#8211; monial act referring to the service of the Pivinity. It is true that it

                grass comes out of the earth&#59; and the wonderful change in the seed intrusted to

                happiness&#44; whilst we prove our sub&#8211; jection to the kingdom of Heaven &#63;
                How true is then our proposition&#44; that the divine and royal rule of our God must
                necessarily consist in our promoting the happiness of each other&#44; seeing that in
                serving Him we will truly bring blessing to all who need our aid. &#34;We will not
                now enlarge upon the necessity of the day of rest to all classes of men&#44; as it

                it does really promote the welfare of society by enforcing the rule of being just to
                all&#44; whether the high and exalted or the poor and lowly. Li this wise the

                mnnity can have any right to regard himself as better&#44; in things referring to
                individual prerogatives&#44; than his neighbours&#44; unless these have voluntarily
                trans&#8211; ferred to him certain rights for the benefit of them&#8211; selves&#59;
                and the individual who is tlius invested with them is then but a servant&#44; an
                agent of those who empower him to bear authority. They are in truth bound by their
                choice&#59; but he too is bound by the compact which renders him the chief&#59; for
                if he vio&#8211; lates his trust&#44; those who have chosen him&#44; or tacitly
                permitted him to assume authority&#44; are of right em&#8211; powered to lower him
                from the position which he un&#8211; Avorthily occupies. For when we take it for
                granted that all men are equal&#44; wdiich doctrine is so emphat&#8211; ically
                taught in the Bible &#58; then the rulers are made for the state&#44; not the state
                for the rulers&#59; and hence it results that there is no personal difference
                between the various individuals composing the commonwealth&#59; that whether they
                are rich or poor&#44; in authority or subordinate&#44; there is but one arbiter to
                decide between them&#44; and to dispose of their persons and goods&#44; and this
                arbiter is the law of the land&#44; administered by those who are chosen for their
                knowledge&#44; morai worth&#44; and integrity to expound it&#44; and to decide
                according to its behests&#44; leaning&#44; in all cases of doubt or uncertainty&#44;
                to favour the accused&#59; because his personal rights and the property which he
                possesses ought not to be taken from him&#44; except upon the clearest possible
                conviction&#44; that he deserves the doom pronounced against him. The whole tendency
                of the Decalogue&#44; the supreme constitution of the Hebrew state&#44; was

                justice&#59; He abhors robbery and murder&#59; He commands truth and integrity&#58;
                hence every man must be left free and uncontrolled in all things wherein he is not
                restrained by an enactment previously existing&#59; and therefore no one can be
                punished or abridged of his rights without a previous warning with regard to the
                deed he is about to com&#8211; mit. &#8212; You will easily understand&#44;
                brethren&#44; how the pure belief in the Godhead which we adore has this political
                idea as its natural consequence. We know of no power in nature to which we are bound
                to render homage&#44; save Him alone&#59; we have received no knowledge of any being
                that has a substantive existence&#44; except our God&#59; whatever is&#44; proceeds
                from Him&#59; whatever happens&#44; occurs only because He is content that it should
                be done. How then can there be any right inhering in one creature which the other
                one has not to an equal degree&#44; unless this additional right has been conferred
                by the direct agency of God&#44; or that of any special portion of mankind who are
                combined as free agents for a particular end&#63; If we then see a man preeminently
                intelligent&#44; or other&#8211; wise endowed&#44; it is a gift granted to him from
                above&#44; not something which he has obtained from his own inherent power or
                special merit&#59; and if such a one should be chosen by direct revelation&#44; as
                in the case of the prophets and the first judges and kings of Israel&#44; or by the
                concurrence&#44; through election&#44; of those who are personally interested &#58;

                arbi&#8211; trary government&#44; or tbe substitution of the will of one man in the
                room of the law&#44; cannot exist with the true spirit of the revelation which we
                have re&#8211; ceived. The ruler&#44; as well as the people&#44; is bound&#44; by
                the religious commandments and the civil enact&#8211; ments&#59; he cannot set aside
                the smallest one of them without infringing that charter by which he is re&#8211;
                tained in authority&#59; and consequently he loses the claim to govern&#44; by which
                alone he can be regarded superior to the rest of the people. It was therefore to be
                expected that&#44; after the Lord bad made himself known as the God of eternal
                jus&#8211; tice and truth. He should take especial care to estab&#8211; lish justice
                on a firm footing&#44; and on such principles as never would require any amendment.
                Other states were and are to this day formed by the will of the governors&#44; that
                is&#44; by grant from the crown where the authority is vested in the person of one
                man&#44; and by legislative resolves where the people themselves govern through
                their representatives. But we were constituted a body politic by redemption through
                the sole agency of our Sovereign and Chief&#59; consequently it was but proper that
                the government should proceed from Ilim&#59; since without his aid directly given we
                could never have been made a people. It was not with us&#44; as with other nations
                who have become a community through the force of arms&#44; by which means arbitrary
                rulers were compelled to acknowledge our independence&#59; for we were taken out
                from the midst of another people by no will or act of our own&#44; nay&#44; acrainst
                the wishes of manv&#44; who wxould rather serve the Egyptians than perish in the

                chains were broken&#44; and when the joke was taken from our neck&#44; we had to
                recognize the mercy of the Eternal One&#44; who had done these great things for us.
                Yet by receiving his law we lost none of our freedom&#59; by accepting his
                commandments we merely submitted to the only legitimate authority from whom the
                charter of our liberties could of right proceed. I use the word &#34;liberties&#34;
                advisedly&#59; for though our religion contains many restrictions in a moral point
                of view&#44; in which I include the ceremo&#8211; nial prohibitions&#44; it embraces
                the utmost freedom of action for every individual member of the state in whatever
                concerns his person and pursuits. Herein he was perfectly unshackled. He could
                travel whither&#8211; soever he pleased&#59; he could follow any handicraft in
                whatever place it suited him best &#59; he could himself enter the councils of the
                people and of the elders&#44; on all occasions when these assemblies met&#59; he was
                un&#8211; tainted by crime till it was proved upon him &#59; and not even the
                highest authority in the land could do aught to injure him without violating the
                very institutions under which they all lived. There was one principle of a twofold
                kind which pervaded the whole of our constitution&#44; we were servants alone of
                God&#44; but among ourselves and to each other we were brothers&#44; friends&#44;
                neighbours&#59; and if you search well into the book of the law&#44; you will find
                no other idea as the basis of our code&#44; no matter how the question may appear at
                first sight. In general&#44; as you will discover&#44; there is no distinction in
                moral duties&#44; whether they relate to the Israelite or the gentile&#59; but in
                others there is a distinction made&#44; not as relates to the law of the Is&#8211;
                raelites&#44; but as regards the customs of the nations <pb n="248"/> 248 THE HEBREW

                to me just now&#44; are those with regard to doniestic servitude&#44; the food which
                is pro&#8211; hibited to Jews&#44; and the taking of interest for money loaned to
                strangers. But you will easily understand&#44; that we were not bound to own
                slaves&#44; nor to loan on interest&#44; nor to give or sell the food prohibited to
                us to others. The gentiles did not consider these things as wrong in olden
                times&#44; and do not consider them now among the things forbidden to them &#59; and
                in not prohibiting them as regarded the stranger among us&#44; it was more in the
                light of toleration than an excep&#8211; tion to civil franchise. But who that knows
                anything of ancient and modern usages with regard to servi&#8211; tude and the
                rights of the creditor over the debtor&#44; does not see an immeasurable difference
                in the power of the Jewish master and lender and that granted by other codes &#63;
                &#34;With us the slave had his rights &#59; an infringement of these gave him his
                freedom&#59; the debtor could not be incarcerated for his inabihty to discharge his
                obligation&#59; since the law is silent with respect to any such summaiy mode of
                enforcing pay&#8211; ment&#44; or rather revenging the poverty of the honest man
                whom misfortunes have reduced to a state of dependence. Hence there is in truth a
                universal sys&#8211; tem of freedom running through the entire legisla&#8211;
                tion&#44; respecting all who came or may come hereafter under its influence and the
                obedience to its separate enactments. The first thing&#44; therefore&#44; that was
                proper to be done after the Lord had made himself known as our Sovereign&#44; was to
                institute the special laws which were to be obeyed in conformity to the general
                princi&#8211; <pb n="249"/> THE HEBREW COMMONWEALTH. 249 pies which we have
                ah&#8211;eady developed&#44; in order that each individual might know how he was to
                act&#44; and to whom he was amenable. Scarcely therefore had the thunders of Sinai
                ceased to terrify the people&#44; the fire of glory yet blazed on the top of the
                mount &#58; when the prophet was instructed&#44; before all other things&#44;
                respecting the civil institutions of the future Israel&#8211; itish state &#59; the
                worship&#44; the festivals&#44; the ceremonies&#44; all were laid aside for the time
                being&#44; in order that the principles of justice might first be established&#59;
                and the Lord began by saying&#44; &#34; And these are the laws of justice which thou
                shalt lay before them.&#34; Exodus xxi. 1. And lie then proceeded by defining the
                personal rights of the individuals who should compose the state. And now behold what
                the first principle is&#44; nothing else than the inalienable right to personal
                freedom. Observe well&#44; that we were not guaranteed against the reverses of
                fortune because we were God&#39;s people&#59; on the contrary&#44; our legislation
                was to be for a practical community&#44; where men associate to labour&#44; to
                study&#44; or to trafiic&#44; where some are idle&#44; others in&#8211;
                dustrious&#44; where some are improvident&#44; others frugal. &#8211;The Israelitish
                commonwealth was to consist of men as they werd&#44; with virtuous habits no more
                than with vicious inclinations&#59; hence the results of riches and poverty&#44; or
                rather of enrichment and impoverishment&#44; were to be witnessed as a matter of
                necessity to a con&#8211; <pb n="250"/> 250 THE HEBREW COMMONWEALTH. siderable
                extent&#44; just as in any other state. But it was the part of wisdom to endeavour
                to make these results as little injurious to the commonwealth as possible. For
                wherever you see great wealth in a state&#44; you may expect equally great poverty
                &#59; and for every palace for the great which you rear&#44; you have to put up a
                hovel for the wretchedly poor. The ex&#8211; tremes of fortune alienate the feelings
                &#59; the very rich does not respect the poor&#59; the very poor hates or envies
                those who are so much above him. Whenever a man has many hundreds who depend upon
                him for their employment which is to give them their daily bread&#44; you may be
                sure that he will in most cases en&#8211; deavour to make them feel his power and to
                subject them to his pleasure. Estates&#44; if permitted to accu&#8211; mulate in
                families&#44; especially if the proprietors there&#8211; of are allowed to acquire a
                long list of retainers and dependents on their bounty&#44; will&#44; in a more or
                less de&#8211; gree&#44; establish grievous inequalities in a community &#59; and
                the end will be the establishment of classes&#44; respectable not for their personal
                worth&#44; despised not for any wrong they have done&#44; but simply be&#8211; cause
                they belong to one circle of the exclusively great&#44; or because they appertain to
                the masses whose lot is toil&#44; daily renewed&#44; and who have to live by what
                their hands bring them for their support. I care not what the form of government is
                which produces these results &#58; it is not a system of equal rights&#44; because
                the humble cannot assert them when they are assailed. But the laws of justice which
                Moses was ordered to lay before Israel struck at once at the root of social
                inequality. Property could not be alienated for a longer period than the

                veg&#8211; etables for his half&#8211;starved children&#44; cooped up day by day in
                noisome palaces which wealth erects osten&#8211; sibly for the production of
                fabrics&#44; but chiefly for its own ao&#8211;o&#8211;randizement. And side bv side
                with the law against the absolute sale of landed estate&#44; was presented the
                ordinance against personal servitude under any circumstances beyond the same period
                of the fiftieth year&#44; should it even have been voluntarily continued in at the
                end of the limit of six years&#44; through the love of the servant for his
                master&#39;s house. .At that year the land had to return to its owner&#44; the
                servant could not stay in the house of the wealthy &#58; he had to be free&#44;
                whether he would or not. Thus the Israelite had always an interest in the state&#44;
                an interest in himself&#59; he was not hopelessly bound to the chariot of the great
                &#59; there was an hour of free&#8211; dom for him&#59; and joyously the members of
                an im&#8211; poverished family could meet again&#44; when the year of freedom was
                proclaimed&#44; on their own paternal do&#8211; main&#44; free from bodily

                to rear up the decayed fortunes of their family&#44; reduced perhaps by the

                proved enough to show its perfect adaptation to form a free state&#44; a community
                of equals. The Lord who is so exalted regards all his creatures alike &#59; and they

                inform us of&#44; concerning the deeds and the purposes of God. To many&#44;
                indeed&#44; the Bible is a mere record of past events and of certain opinions which

                of the legacy of truth which was handed down from heaven. No wonder&#44; then&#44;
                that such inquirers&#44; as just mentioned&#44; can discover in the Bible precisely
                what they please&#44; and that they deduce thence doctrines the very reverse of what
                we have received from our fathers&#44; and that they endeav&#8211; our to establish
                in their stead ideas more consonant with the march of intellect&#44; than the
                antiquated no&#8211; tions of ages of barbarism. But blessed be that bar&#8211;
                barism&#44; if such it be&#44; which inspired hope and trust in an entire people
                under the most adverse circum&#8211; stances&#44; in positions which&#44; but for
                this very peculiar&#8211; ity of thought&#44; would have obliterated from the page
                of history the very name perhaps of the Jewish na&#8211; tion. &#8212; Be this
                barbarism&#44; if you will&#59; but it is that species which must survive the
                enlightenment of the day&#44; which is destined to sink before the progress of some
                new notions which are to spring up hereafter. But this idea of ours&#44; which is so
                peculiarly Jewish&#44; sees in the Bible the standard of truths &#8212; not indeed
                the truths of science&#44; more of which are constantly elicited by the march of
                discovery and investigation&#44; by which every age acquires more knowledge of

                the first age that was taught was necessarily as wise as the most distant which we
                can think of&#59; since man&#39;s re&#8211; search has no power to discover of the
                Deity the least more than He has chosen to reveal to us himself&#59; and

                thirty centuries ago. It were vain&#44; then&#44; we will ad&#8211; mit&#44; to
                regard the Bible as containing all the discov&#8211; eries of modern science &#59;
                but equally vain would it be to measure its doctrinal truths by the standard of a
                newfangled philosophy&#44; no doubt destined to perish away from the earth&#44;
                after it has prevailed its brief period&#44; like all its predecessors. We therefore
                can&#8211; not relinquish our views of Scripture&#44; because of the taunts that
                they are behind the age &#59; we cannot sur&#8211; render our hopes in the promises
                of the Lord&#44; because the men of the day assert that they are not compati&#8211;
                ble with the advance of human intellect and the re&#8211; finement of society. We
                will for a moment leave out of view the fact that we are dealing with
                revelation&#44; with the Spirit of wisdom&#44; to whom all things are known&#44; and
                confine our remarks to the position of human society as we find it&#58; and what
                then has it now above preceding ages&#44; to induce us to change our opinions &#63;
                Let us see &#58; When Abraham first taught the truths of God&#44; there were
                heathens and unbelievers &#59; he stood almost alone on earth in the belief which he
                entertained&#59; when Moses received the Law&#44; the worship of the Most High was
                confined to the people who had gone forth from Egypt. And what is the position of
                the world now &#63; The very selt&#8211; same it was then&#58; the principle of the
                unity of God with the code of morals which was revealed with it&#44; is the
                inheritance only of the congregation of Jacob &#59; consequently&#44; so far as our
                relative position is con&#8211; cerned&#44; we stand in the same point&#44; in
                reference to maukind&#44; where we always have stood&#44; where we are alone&#44; to
                all intents and purposes &#59; and if we ever had 22&#42; <pb n="258"/> 258
                SCRIPTURAL PREDICTIONS. any mission to fulfil&#44; we have to do it to this very
                hour. Whatever Scripture therefore teaches with regard to duty &#40;we speak now on
                the score of reason alone&#41; is necessarily as requisite now as ever it was&#44;
                the motive which prompted such institution not hav&#8211; ing yet ceased by any
                occurrence which history re&#8211; lates&#59; and&#44; since the doctrines&#44; upon
                which these en&#8211; actments are founded&#44; are either as true as they ever
                were&#44; or were as false then as they are now it follows that&#44; if they were
                absolutely founded on fact in old times&#44; they must be necessarily admitted as
                true at this present moment &#59; and whereas we cannot imagine any circumstances
                which could alter this state of things&#44; we come to the conclusion&#44; which no
                show of reasoning can gainsay&#44; that the truths of Scripture must always be the
                same&#44; without change&#44; or addi&#8211; tion&#44; or diminution &#58; they are
                a perfect system in themselves&#44; and depend upon one another&#44; if not from the
                very nature of the case&#44; at least from the fact of their being emanations of the
                revealed will and knowledge of the Lord. Human intellect has ad&#8211; vanced in
                many discoveries &#59; society has become re&#8211; fined in many things above the
                characters treated of in the Bible &#59; but this argues only that the spirit of our
                revelation has extended its influence far and wide&#44; and that its true import of
                mercy and universal phi&#8211; lanthropy has penetrated deeper and deeper&#44; as
                time progresses&#44; than it had done in the first ages of its promulgation. All
                this does not prove that the spirit of our age is superior to that of the Bible&#44;
                or that we must hasten to throw it out of view&#44; if we wish to keep pace with the
                civilization which is spreading around us &#59; on the contrary&#44; it would seem
                to be the <pb n="259"/> SCRIPTURAL PREDICTIONS. 259 part of wisdom&#44; of human
                wisdom and foresight&#44; I mean&#44; to endeavour to come up closer and closer to
                the standard of mercy&#44; truth and obedience which it enjoins&#44; so that it may
                have the best and happiest influence on us in all the relations of life&#44; and
                that by our exhibiting its beauty we may draw others to ac&#8211; knowledge its
                truth&#44; and be improved by its instruc&#8211; tion. But we as Jews have a higher
                motive to respect the Scriptures than mere human reasoning&#44; even if this be
                based upon the acknowledged truth of Scrip&#8211; tural doctrines and precepts. We
                are not to believe because a doctrine has been proved true&#44; but because we have
                received it&#59; we are not to practise a precept only when we see its
                reasonableness&#44; but for the rea&#8211; son that our God commanded us to do so.
                Judaism is in fact a system of faith and obedience&#44; and every&#8211; thing short
                of this is not religion&#44; is not yielding our&#8211; selves implicitly to the
                guidance of our Father. I do not mean to say that there is any objection to our
                proving our opinions philosophically true&#44; or our acts established upon the
                clearest principles of reason&#59; for thus we would fortify divine truths by our
                own experience&#44; and impress them in this way the more strongly upon our
                conviction &#59; but I contend that we are to have a higher motive than such a
                procedure could possibly establish in our minds&#58; we must have grounds for
                obedience&#44; even where our reason is not sufficient to satisfy itself. For were
                the mere arguing a point satisfactorily the standard of belief and action&#44; every
                human being would necessarily have to be left to choose what he would believe and
                do&#59; and we should thus have as many systems of religion as there <pb n="260"/>
                260 SCRIPTURAL PREDICTIONS. are classes of thinkers. But this would certainly be the
                reverse of a system of peace &#59; for each man would then assuredly endeavour to
                make his ideas&#44; however grotesque they were&#44; accepted by and acceptable to
                the many. Under such a state of things&#44; no Scrip&#8211; tures would be requisite
                as a guide to religion&#44; seeing that their contents would be modified by the whim
                and fancy of every one of their readers&#59; in other words&#44; a system
                homogeneous in its principles would be out of the question &#59; and the only
                conformity pos&#8211; sible would arise from the voluntary assent of a num&#8211;
                ber of persons to certain assumed principles&#44; which conformity could endure only
                till some new fancy were held up to the admiration of the public. The rise and
                progress of sects&#44; the most absurd even&#44; prove that this view of the
                question is correct &#59; and it hence results&#44; that although it is impossible
                to believe in anything absolutely absurd and contrary to common sense&#44; as the
                doctrines of many sects really are&#44; it is equally absurd to reject as untrue
                everything the rea&#8211; son of which is not at once apparent to us. For our not
                discovering the reason of every proposition does not prove it unreasonable &#59;
                because&#44; in the first place&#44; we may not be well informed of the attending
                cir&#8211; cumstances&#44; or&#44; secondly&#44; we may not have natural capacity
                enough to comprehend it&#44; should we even have all the materials for forming a
                judgment placed at our disposal. In the one case&#44; others better in&#8211;
                structed may be able to understand the matter&#44; in the other&#44; those who have
                a better natural capacity. It is therefore reasonable that we should receive as true
                some things which we do not know from our own experience and knowledge&#44; provided
                only they be not <pb n="261"/> SCRIPTURAL PREDICTIONS. 261 contrary to reason &#59;
                for no one can be expected to believe a proposition which to him is impossible of
                comprehension&#44; though even here he ought not to make up his mind hastily&#44;
                before he has studied and weighed the matter carefully in all its bearings. It
                results hence that&#44; much as we admit free inquiry&#44; and much as we are at
                liberty to seek to illustrate our opinions and acts by satisfactory reasoning&#44;
                we are bound&#44; as Jews&#44; to admit the doctrines tauscht bv the Scriptures&#44;
                as we have received them&#44; though&#44; on the one hand&#44; our own reasoning
                would not have led us to such conclusions&#44; and&#44; on the other&#44; we are not
                able to see clearly how the facts announced as to hap&#8211; pen hereafter may
                actually be developed. The former is the case with nearly all the ceremonial
                enactments&#59; if we had to make for ourselves a system of religious duties&#44; we

                hitter is the case with the predictions scattered through the Bible &#59; for we
                cannot understand how they are to be accom&#8211; plished&#44; if we are guided
                merely by the analogy derived from the ordinary events of history&#44; either of
                ages long past&#44; or of what is taking place under our own eyes. Notwithstanding
                all this&#44; since we are Israelites&#44; we are bound&#44; as recipients of the
                law of God and the promises which he has made known to us&#44; to acquiesce in the

                things which have liot yet been accomplished in the progress of events. We
                could&#44; if it were necessary&#44; point to many of the predictions which have
                already been con&#8211; firmed by their accomplishment&#44; and argue hence&#44; as

                present purpose&#44; this is useless&#44; since we wish to estabhsh that&#44; on
                grounds of reason&#44; we ought to con&#8211; fide in all which we are taught in
                Scripture&#44; since we once must admit that the basis of our religion is of
                di&#8211; vine origin. It would be a singular procedure surely&#44; to dissect the
                word of God as critics do a book pre&#8211; sented to their review for the first
                time&#44; &#8212; to approve of one part&#44; and to condemn the other&#44; for no
                better reason than that our taste is not satisfied. For who will warrant us
                that&#44; in such a manner&#44; we should not arrive at length at the proposition to
                amend the ten commandments even &#63; to add to them an eleventh and twelfth
                precept&#44; or to limit them to nine or eight &#63; &#8212; For&#44; by all the
                evidence accessible to us&#44; there is no material difierence in all the precepts
                and dogmas of our religion &#59; and though some from their nature&#44; or the
                manner of their first publication&#44; may seem to have a stronger weight and a more
                imposing appear&#8211; ance&#44; still they are all exhibited as having the same
                origin. To reject therefore any would invalidate the whole&#59; to declare one

                do what He says it is his purpose of accomplishing. The doctrine of a redeemer&#44;
                and the hope that there one day Avould be an end to all our sorrows arising from the
                hostility of mankind to the household of Israel&#44; have been from ancient days
                deeply rooted in the minds of all descendants of Abraham. They ever saw&#44; in the

                purpose&#44; a resignation which extorted the respect and wonder of even their
                tormentors. There seem to have been seasons in those centuries of barbarism&#44;

                profess their adhesion to our laws and customs. Still they trusted on&#44; and from
                them have sprung the growing millions who know of no god&#44; save the Eternal&#44;
                of no saviour&#44; save the One who is the Creator and the Lord of all &#59; and

                Egyptians&#44; but our houses he spared.&#34; Our text requires but little
                explanation so far as its words are concerned &#59; it merely commands&#44; that in
                or&#8211; der to remember and to call to the minds of others the miracles wrought at
                our going forth from Egypt&#44; we should perpetually keep certain remarkable
                cere&#8211; monies&#44; which should induce our children to inquire&#44; &#34; What
                is this service unto you &#63;&#34; when the answer is to follow from those grown
                old in the spirit of Juda&#8211; ism&#44; by expounding to those yet young in their
                ex&#8211; perience of divine things&#44; the motives of gratitude which should
                attach all sons of Israel to the service of their Benefactor&#44; because of the
                many benefits which He bestowed on them in times and seasons when evil and death
                overwhelmed those who had op&#8211; pressed them. This is the whole which the text
                we have quoted teaches&#59; and&#44; to this day&#44; the remnant of Israel observe

                done in the far&#8211;away days of antiquity&#44; when He plagued our adversaries

                midst of another nation&#44; with signs and wonders&#44; and an outstretched
                arm&#44; and fearful deeds&#44; even as we experienced in Egypt before our own
                eyes&#44; where we ourselves were the recipients of the divine bounty&#44; <pb

                Thus far the letter of the law&#59; but what says the spirit thereof&#63; It
                says&#44; that we Israelites have been more favoured than any other people&#44; and
                hence we have more duties to observe towards our Father. Other nations&#44; no less
                than ourselves&#44; have been slaves to others &#59; but never in the history of the
                world were they rescued at once and forever from the power of their tyrants&#44;
                whilst these were rebuked and humbled as it were in a moment of time &#59; other
                nations&#44; too&#44; like ourselves&#44; have walked in ignorance of divine things
                &#59; but never in the history of the world was it witnessed&#44; as in our own
                case&#44; that the glorious maj&#8211; esty of the Lord should be displayed before

                has been done&#44; some return is surely requisite to prove ourselves worthy&#44; in

                their fellows &#63; No doubt&#44; those who have thought and acted thus&#44; did it

                maintain that either of the above&#44; or all of them combined&#44; had effected or
                could effect the least towards reaching the proposed end &#58; men would still be
                men on earth&#44; whilst God would still be God in heaven&#44; whether sacrifices be

                to chaunt his praise&#44; or their chords remain untouched by the hands of those
                skilled in sound. IIow then shall we serve our God &#63; how then shall we show that
                we are grateful &#63; how prove that the goodness which we have received&#44; and
                which is daily renewed from the Hand which is ever open&#44; whence plenty
                descends&#44; forever and aye&#44; into the lap of those who never deserved it by
                their own merit&#44; has not been unworthily bestowed &#63; Truly the heart desires
                to return thanks&#44; the spirit longs to requite some of the mercy and the truth
                which have been bestowed&#59; but the solution of the question is not within the
                bounds of human reason&#59; for all conclusions of mere human research would
                necessarily end in vexation and a troubled spirit. Yet we have received the means of
                solving it&#44; and it is found in the words of the Scrip&#8211; tures which have
                been given to us for our guide and instruction. They speak of God as our
                Benefiictor&#44; as the One without whom our existence is as naught&#44; without
                whose will our days would be vanity and but a shadow on the earth &#59; but they
                likewise inform us that He has given us the means of rendering our&#8211; selves
                worthy of his favour &#59; that we can&#44; if we will&#44; earn from his mercy all
                the good we desire on this earth&#44; all the happiness we can expect to enjoy
                here&#8211; after. <pb n="275"/> THOUGHTS ON THE PASSOVER. 275 Yet not alone the
                means&#44; but the manner of mak&#8211; ing them productive has been Hkewise
                revealed &#58; in other words&#44; we have received direct precepts&#44; which are
                the emanations of the divine Mind&#44; and which are represented to us as the acts
                which will be pleas&#8211; ing to God. Whatever then is done in conformity to these
                divine injunctions&#44; is the very thing which be&#8211; tokens gratitude towards
                the Lord in him that does it &#59; and no matter what those who merely argue from
                human reasoning may allege&#44; it is a means of deserv&#8211; ing yet farther the
                favour of our heavenly Sovereign. We&#44; perhaps&#44; must admit&#44; if we come to
                take the sub&#8211; ject in its importance in or influence on human life&#44; that
                to eat unleavened bread on the Passover is no&#8211; wise particularly
                meritorious&#59; there is nothing in the act itself&#44; which can render it one of
                peculiar dignity in the eyes of a philosophical inquirer&#59; but it assumes a very
                different aspect when you search the Scriptures and see the ordinance &#58; &#34;
                Seven days shall ye eat un&#8211; leavened bread&#59;&#34; for herewith is expressed
                the will of God&#44; that those who belong to the house of Israel shall absolutely
                and in reality eat&#44; for the space of an entire week&#44; bread which has not
                become leavened&#44; and with which no leaven has been mixed in the smallest
                pro&#8211; portion. If&#44; therefore&#44; we abstain from that which is
                prohibited&#44; and use what has been ordained&#44; we admit at once that we yield
                up our own will and pleasure&#44; and adopt in their stead&#44; for our
                government&#44; the expressed commandment of our Creator&#59; we confess the
                insufficiency of our intellect&#44; and become obedient servants to what He has
                decreed&#59; we give up our right to self&#8211;government&#44; where we are
                certified that our God has taught us something different from what we <pb n="276"/>
                276 THOUGHTS ON THE PASSOVER. ourselves would have chosen&#44; and act&#44;
                therefore&#44; not as we would have acted&#44; but as Ave are certified that it is
                his desire we should demean ourselves. Were it&#44; that our reason had any
                substantive power&#44; &#8212; that our knowledge were the result of our own
                reflection&#44; &#8212; then might it be alleged that such obedience is that which a
                bondman Vias to yield to his master&#59; not be&#8211; cause he wishes it&#44; but
                because fear or interest com&#8211; pels him to forego his own will. But the case
                here is far different&#59; of ourselves&#44; we know little indeed&#59; our own
                wisdom is. limited&#44; like our days&#44; to the shortest span &#59; and lie who
                teaches us his law is our God&#44; who existed before we were born&#44; who will be
                after this changeful world shall have lapsed again into chaos&#44; if that be his
                ultimate will&#59; who sees the con&#8211; nexion of thing with thing&#44; till the
                utmost end of all that is or will be&#59; to whom little acts done by us are
                necessarily of equal importance with the greatest&#44; because to Him all our deeds
                are alike. If then we obey Him in what lie has written down for our in&#8211;
                struction&#44; we are like children who follow their father on a road which is new
                to them&#44; but which he has often trodden before&#44; of which he knows the
                begin&#8211; ning and the termination&#44; the dangers of which are familiar to
                him&#44; but the beauties also of which he knows equally well. The child will
                accompany his father into the open field&#44; will enter with him into the depths of
                the forest&#44; and into the fastness of the mountain&#8211;path&#44; not because he
                knows them himself&#44; but because he believes that his father has knowledge&#44;
                that he will not deceive him&#44; and that&#44; should there be danger&#44; he will
                stand by and give him all the aid in his power. Even so are we taught to trust our

                which you are but a small part at the best&#44; if even you yourselves deem that you
                are of paramount importance. Gratitude&#44; therefore&#44; for the benefits we have
                re&#8211; ceived&#44; can be shown only in obedience to the revealed will of
                God&#59; we are not to inquire whether our reason would have sanctioned such a law
                or not&#59; for submis&#8211; sion to the instruction of the Supreme is the
                test&#44; whether we are truly alive to the importance of re&#8211; garding Him as
                all in all&#44; his will as the only light for our feet. Are we then not to erect
                places of wor&#8211; ship&#63; are we not to sing hymns to God&#39;s praise&#63; are
                we not to contemplate his greatness &#63; Ay&#44; even so&#44; if these acts merely

                ever&#44; be erected&#44; not to display how we can serve the Lord&#44; but because
                He has consecrated our so doing by his positive command&#44; and has promised to
                come and bless us wherever we are assembled in his name. We should sing praises to

                give thanks unto the Lord&#44; and to sing praises unto the name of the Most

                sickles. Wherever we turn our eyes&#44; there they are met by evidences of
                surpassing Good&#8211; ness&#59; wherever&#44; therefore&#44; our lot is cast&#44;
                there too should we feel sensibly our indebtedness for the bounty&#44; our entire
                dependence on the Hand that sus&#8211; tains us&#44; not because we deserve
                mercy&#44; but because the world is governed by the Spirit of compassion and

                Avere inspired by God&#44; set us the example of offering up to Ilim the meditations
                of their hearts&#44; expressed in the words of their lips. For thus Abra&#8211; ham
                prayed &#59; thus Moses sang an undying song on the shore of the sea&#59; thus did
                David attune his harp and chaunted praises&#44; which yet are heard in our
                assemblies&#44; which will never perish whilst there lives one child of Israel to be
                animated by the fire which erst burnt in the soul of the son of Jesse. And just as
                our praybrs and our hymns are acceptable when offered in the spirit of humility&#44;
                because we feel that we owe every thing to God&#44; so were formerly sacri&#8211;

                brought in obedience to the mandate of Scripture. The people in their folly imagined
                that the more places for sacrifice they had&#44; the more ac&#8211; ceptable would
                they render themselves to the Deity&#59; whereas they were reproved for doing what
                the Lord had not asked of them&#59; there should be but one temple and but one
                altar&#44; as there was and is but one God to whom adoration is due. Hence the very
                acts which were worship at Jerusalem became iniquity and transgression in the places
                not sanctified by the spirit of our Father &#59; and the few times that in the
                degen&#8211; eracy of our state pious rulers governed the land&#44; as was the case
                with King Josiah&#44; these abominations of provincial places of sacrifice were
                removed from the land. All this proves what we have set out with&#44; that acts of
                worship must have the sanction of the Supreme to render them agreeable to God&#59;
                human reason cannot establish a standard of acceptability&#59; hence we are bound to
                yield to the instruction which alone can enlighten us&#44; if we wish to exhibit in
                good truth the grateful feeling which fills our soul. How should we then act &#63;
                we&#44; I mean&#44; who belong to the house of Israel &#63; we&#44; who reside in
                this country&#44; in the new home where we can and do live secure from the attack
                and malice of the adversary of our faith &#63; Is it by erecting synagoges
                merely&#44; and or&#8211; namenting them&#44; and having an attractive worship &#63;
                Is it that we please the ear and gratify our senses whilst present in the house of
                prayer&#63; It is indeed true that it would show a poor devotional spirit&#44; were
                we to have fine houses for our dwellings&#44; and have them ornamented and furnished
                with every thing that <pb n="281"/> THOUGHTS ON THE PASSOVER. 281 can please and
                delight&#44; whilst the house of God should be a mean hovel&#44; and not rendered
                pleasant and agree&#8211; able to the eye&#59; since by such neglect we would be
                like the miser&#44; denounced by the prophet&#44; who brings from his flock the
                meanest for a sacrifice. So also is it requisite that the worship be conducted
                harmoni&#8211; ously and decently &#59; that the chaunt be well regulated&#44; and
                the reading of the law and prayers be done with due devotion and solemnity&#59; that
                silence and pro&#8211; priety be observed whilst we are within the precincts of the
                sacred walls &#59; because&#44; if before a human king&#44; we would necessarily
                feel awe and respect&#44; how much more should this be the case before the supreme
                Ruler of the world. But&#44; observe well&#44; brethren&#44; that if we have
                accomplished all this&#59; if we have beautiful houses of worship&#44; and every
                thing regulated in them&#44; so as to give impressiveness and decorum to our public
                as&#8211; semblies&#44; we have not discharged our debt of grati&#8211; tude to our
                Father. He has given us freedom &#59; it is not&#44; therefore&#44; the synagogue
                alone where He is to be honoured &#59; it would be but a poor commentary upon our
                pious feelings and devotion&#44; were they to be limited to the synagogue solely.
                The whole life of an Israelite ought to be one constant series of wor&#8211;
                ship&#44; not indeed of that species which consists in the recitation of prayers and
                psalms&#44; in the pouring forth of beautiful words from burning lips&#44; but of
                that order of which we spoke in the beginning&#44; the surrendering of our will to
                the religion revealed to us from heaven. But look&#44; how we actually do act &#33;
                One would be led to suppose that the atmosphere of freedom were in&#8211; compatible
                with the Jewish religion &#59; that only under the pressure of circumstances could

                of its followers &#33; Shame&#44; that gen&#8211; tiles should make the discovery
                that the Sabbath is profaned extensively&#44; that many who have been prop&#8211;
                erly educated by their parents even&#44; distinguish not between the clean and the
                unclean &#33; Shame&#44; I say&#44; that those who watch for an opportunity to
                strike a fatal blow against those who are of Israel&#44; by robbing them of their
                faith&#44; should thus see&#44; or fancy that they see&#44; that they have at length
                found out the true rem&#8211; edy of destroying Israel from being a people&#44; that
                by giving them freedom they would soon learn to dis&#8211; pense with the faith
                which they clung to in adversity&#44; like the traveller that parted with his cloak
                amidst the assaults of the rays of the sun&#44; which he only wrapped the closer
                round him when the fury of the storm burst upon him with its chilling blast. Are you
                prepared to have this remark verified by your own example &#63; My voice&#44;
                indeed&#44; cannot penetrate very far&#59; but let me beg of all of you who now hear
                me&#44; and do carry the message to all with whom you have the least influence&#44;
                to do all in your power to prevent the verification of the hopes of our enemies&#44;
                and the fears of the servants of the Lord. There is no connexion between freedom and
                irreligion &#59; the true spirit of godliness can only thrive where no fear of man
                does weigh down upon the soul. God reigns supreme where the power of mortals is not
                felt crush&#8211; ing the spirit&#44; which ought to be left as free as it came from
                his creative hand. Why then should we not prove by our whole course&#44; that
                freedom only quickens the plant of faith which is rooted imperish&#8211; ably in our
                hearts &#63; What is there uncongenial with the brightest enlightenment and our

                own triumph which it beholds&#59; it is the goal which we hope to reach through its
                blessed influence. Only let us be firm&#44; let us not forget our Benefactor&#44;

                forgot his obligations to God and man so soon as the plague had relaxed of its
                severity. Yes&#44; what is the use of all our synagogues&#44; of all our order and
                decorum&#44; if the worshippers are away&#44; because they are pursuing their own
                avocations on the day sacred to the Lord of hosts &#63; why should He accept such
                service when his laws are contemned&#63; And then this takes place in a country
                where none can molest us&#44; because of our faith &#59; where we can rest or labour
                without any one to question us&#44; why we do so. It is&#44; I acknowledge&#44; a
                happy presage&#44; that the ob&#8211; servers of the Sabbath are increasing&#44;
                that more re&#8211; spect has in many places been paid of late to the days set apart
                by the Lord as holy&#59; but there is much room for improvement yet&#59; all have
                not been brought in&#44; and many of the ordinances are not as strictly ob&#8211;
                served as tliej could easily be. Let me beg of you to arouse yourselves to one

                Brethren &#33; In the struggle which we Israelites are compelled to wage with the
                world&#44; not the least untoward cir&#8211; cumstance&#44; to take the matter in
                the way mankind judge&#44; is the smallness of our numbers when com&#8211; pared
                with the followers of other persuasions&#44; and this disproportion is the more
                apparent from the fact of our being scattered in small communities in the niost
                populous cities&#44; so that in but few places can our presence be at all sensibly
                felt. If we look at the assemblies which weekly flock into the houses of wor&#8211;
                ship of other sects &#59; if we see on their stated festivals the hand of industry
                arrested&#44; and one solemn scene of repose overspreading the land &#58; it almost
                appears presumption in us to stand aloof from the masses&#44; and to maintain our
                separate little orbit in which we have been accustomed to move. But if we quit the
                con&#8211; templation of the crowds before us&#44; and examine mi&#8211; nutely in
                their divisions&#44; there at least where mind is left unshackled and permitted to
                adopt such deduc&#8211; tions as to it seem the most reasonable &#58; we will be
                astonished at the diversity which exists amidst the outwardly&#8211;apparent
                conformity of conduct. It is true&#44; all sects agree in condemning as erroneous
                the ideas of faith which we Jews profess &#58; still if you question them
                closely&#44; they will all allege to have a high ven&#8211; eration for our religion
                in its purity&#44; and for the an&#8211; cient bearers of the testimony to the truth

                you&#44; that therein are contained the only authentic records of the deeds which
                God did to man in the early ages of the world. If then you feel&#44; in spirit&#44;
                the weakness of Israel in the smallness of the household of Jacob&#44; revert back
                to the origin of the Mosaic institution&#44; how it came into existence amidst the
                desert of Arabia&#44; far from the boundaries of civilization&#44; how it had to
                struggle during the long period of forty years&#44; which consumed the remainder of
                the life of Moses&#44; from the Exodus from Egypt till his death&#44; in inuring the
                people under his guidance to the restraints of the precepts of the law&#44; and how
                it has since worked itself upward to become&#44; though in a circumscribed
                degree&#44; the governing principle of all civilized nations. Among the tens of
                thousands of his followers Moses perhaps alone appreciated the object of the
                redemption he was to bring about&#58; it was that the people should serve God in
                rites and upon principles differing from their enlightened rul&#8211; ers &#59;
                whereas they&#44; when hearing that God had visited them and seen their
                affliction&#44; listened only to the clanking of their chains&#44; and felt the
                pressure of the yoke on their necks &#59; and they thus looked only for&#8211; ward
                to the long&#8211;coveted hour&#44; when they might ex&#8211; tend their steps and
                hold out their arms freed from the bonds 6i&#58; slavery as far as the natural
                length of their limbs would permit them &#59; they hoped to lift up high their
                heads&#44; no longer pressed down by unwil&#8211; ling burdens. Yet to have
                accomplished all this <pb n="288"/> 288 GENTILE CUSTOMS. would have been merely to
                show mercy to the few&#44; the comparatively few&#44; I mean&#44; who composed that
                generation of our forefathers in Egypt&#59; and liberat&#8211; ing them from
                oppressive labour indeed&#44; but leaving them sunk in the same depth of ignorance
                in which they were at that moment&#44; would have been to make them a savage horde
                freed from restraint&#44; and dan&#8211; gerous from the very hardships they had
                been com&#8211; pelled to endure&#44; both to their own rulers and those people in
                whose neighbourhoods they might happen to be. But immediately upon the announcement
                that the hour of their freedom was impending&#44; they re&#8211; ceived a
                commandment to be observed throughout their generations in memory of their having
                been lib&#8211; erated&#44; not by their own prowess&#44; but by the special
                interposition of a beneficent Providence&#44; and that they were&#44; it is
                true&#44; rescued from servitude to human beings like themselves&#44; but only to
                become servants to the One on high &#59; and upon this condition did they receive
                the permission to quit the soil of their sorrows. &#34;And go&#44; serve ye the
                Lord&#44; as ye have spoken&#44;&#34; were the words of their tyrant&#44; and with
                the sound of the wailing of their enemies yet ringing in their ears&#44; they
                hastened onward to meet their destiny&#44; and upon the shores of the Arabian gulf
                they chaunted their song of deliverance from the ruthless foe&#44; who desired
                either to reduce them again to slavery or to wreak his vengeance&#44; and to satisfy
                the craving edge of his sword by their slaughtered thousands. Yet the prophet was
                nearly alone &#59; a few had in truth been brought to see the aim of the Lord &#59;

                wield the sword&#59; and they were at the same time informed of an institution
                peculiar to them which&#44; in addition to the formerly&#8211;given memorial&#44;
                they should observe forever. Yes&#44; the Passover had been instituted to
                commemo&#8211; rate through all their generations the great deed of redemption&#44;
                to be observed once a year &#59; as the libera&#8211; tion of the people from
                bondage was to be final&#44; and not to happen again during their whole
                existence&#59; and thus whsktever trials have come to our lot&#44; servi&#8211; tude
                to men was not one of them. The Sabbath&#44; however&#44; was ordained as a loeekly
                festival&#44; constantly recurring&#44; in order to remind continually all who
                ob&#8211; serve it&#44; that the God for whose glory they feel them&#8211; selves
                bound to abstain from labour&#44; watches over every individual during his lohole
                existence&#44; and gra&#8211; ciously bestows his blessing on the work of his
                hands&#59; for without his favour all toiling would be in vain&#44; and no plan of
                aggrandizement can succeed if He grants not success. They were thus gradually made
                to understand that their liberation from Pharaoh&#39;s yoke was not to be limited in
                its effect to their own period&#44; to terminate with the life of those who had
                participated immediately in its benefits &#59; but that it was an event constituted
                and interwoven with their national existence&#44; that it should be permanently felt
                by all their descendants. Still&#44; with the bestowal of these two precepts&#44;

                hearts&#44; to be able for all times to withstand the danger of being
                obliterated&#59; since the doctrines which were to serve as the basis for their
                obedience had not yet been promulgated abroad&#44; and intrusted to their keeping as
                their national opinions concerning God and their relation to Him. It was&#44;
                therefore&#44; that the whole people had to be indoctrinated permanently with ideas
                which should be of an unvarying nature&#44; and which should natu&#8211; rally
                demand the observance of the institutions al&#8211; ready imparted to them as
                memorials of the great acts of their divine Benefactor. It was&#44; then&#44; not
                the prophet Moses alone&#44; as in the first moments of the new revelation&#44; not
                the few high spirits afterwards&#44; who understood the councils of God&#44; but
                millions of human beings&#44; an entire people though the smallest of all
                nations&#44; who learnt to comprehend the will of the Lord&#44; and became willing
                recipients of the stand&#8211; ard of faith or belief which was intrusted to their
                keeping. Behold then our fathers at the foot of Sinai&#44; listenins&#59; in silence
                and awe to the fearful Yoice that spoke amidst the thunder&#44; and louder and more
                pene&#8211; trating than the sound of the cornet&#44; which grew stronger and

                their soul be&#8211; came more and more opened to the reception of the instruction
                afforded them&#58; and you will be able in a slight degree to comprehend the immense
                accession of power acquired by the views which only a little while before were known
                to but one of all the children of man. There were now hosts of witnesses&#44; masses
                pf standard&#8211;bearers&#44; parents of innumerable families that were to spring
                from them&#44; who all should ac&#8211; <pb n="291"/> GENTILE CUSTOMS. 291 knowledge
                the same doctrine&#44; that God the Lord is one&#44; who all should follow that same
                law which had been proclaimed from amidst the fires of Horeb. But&#44; though the
                foundation had thus been laid&#44; the work of salvation was not finished. Before
                the newly&#8211; elected servants of the Most High could possess the inheritance
                which had been promised to them&#59; before they could again be allowed to hold
                intercourse with those not instructed as they had been&#58; they had to undergo many
                trials&#44; and be schooled in various ways to discover &#34; whether they loved the
                Lord with all their heart and all their soul.&#34; The love of Egyptian customs was
                to be obliterated from their mind&#44; equally with the feeling of inferiority which
                a long subjection to arbitrary rule had naturally engendered in their souls. It was
                to be expected that persons&#44; who had always been compelled to take the direction
                of their ideas and the prompting to their actions from the commands of others&#44;
                should eventually imagine that their superiors were actually above them in every
                thing as much as in political powder&#59; and though&#44; therefore&#44; the chains
                had been removed from the limbs of the Israelites&#44; nothing else could be looked
                for&#44; except that the impression thereof should be felt a long time
                thereafter&#59; and that hence upon the first opportunity they would revert to the
                customs which had been theirs by long practice from their infancy. Need I cite in
                evidence the worship of the golden calf&#63; the murmuring of the people on the
                occasion of the false report brought by the spies&#44; where in the first case they
                assumed again the gods of Egypt&#44; and in the second actually conspired to return
                to the coun&#8211; try where renewed servitude was the only lot which <pb n="292"/>

                the Lord who&#44; foreseeing the evil which a long&#8211;indulged habit would
                constantly reproduce&#44; if not eradicated by the lapse of time&#44; absolutely
                kept the Israelites in the wilderness&#44; under their great teacher&#44; during a
                whole generation&#44; &#8212; so long as by their conduct they had proved that they
                still clung to the idols of Egypt&#44; whilst their limbs felt the pressure and
                their souls the degradation&#44; the result of their involuntary residence in a land
                that was not theirs. It must not be forgotten that&#44; though God permits evil to
                be done&#44; it is not his purpose that the rule of violence and sin shall endure
                forever&#59; and hence&#44; though He did not destroy all the idols that ever were
                erected&#44; nor did restrain mankind by any active inter&#8211; ference&#44; other

                which&#44; through its antagonizing effects to the customs of Egypt&#44; was
                ultimately to obtain a com&#8211; plete triumph over whatever evil was entailed upon
                the world by the practices and ideas&#44; which had sprung up&#44; like poisonous
                plants&#44; amidst the noxious culture of the priests of idolatry. It was not&#44;
                therefore&#44; a mere arbitrary decree intended to make the Israelites a singular
                people&#44; but a wise precautionary statute&#44; which was announced to us&#44;

                Lord spoke to Moses&#44; saying. Speak to the children of Israel&#44; and say unto

                with the existence of idolatry in Egypt and Canaan&#44; as now in many heathen
                lands&#44; there prevailed the most harbarous and demoralizing practices&#44; and
                even murder was permitted&#44; nay enjoined&#44; to gratify the infamous cus&#8211;
                toms of heathenish priests. In looking over&#44; there&#8211; fore&#44; the
                prohibitions which follow in the same chap&#8211; ter from which we have just
                quoted&#44; we will find the one relating to Molech&#8211;worship included&#44; a
                worship which was best observed by men causing their chil&#8211; dren to pass
                through blazing fire&#44; whilst the deafen&#8211; ing noise of drums and other
                loud&#8211;sounding instru&#8211; ments drowned the cries of the innocents in the
                ears of their agonized parents. Such horrors were prac&#8211; tised&#44; and similar
                ones are now practised&#44; in the in&#8211; sulted name of religion. The mind was

                wrath of the gods by their so&#8211;called sacred practices&#44; and the

                succumbed blindly&#44; perhaps willingly&#44; to the incubus which was resting upon
                them with its iron&#44; deadening weight. But could such things be permitted in a
                system where God was the King of the land&#63; could it be imagined that his
                servants&#44; whom He had redeemed&#44; should be the voluntary bondmen of teachers
                of falsehood&#44; of crime and of cruelty&#63; It were blasphemy to say this&#44; to
                imagine it even&#59; and hence it was proper that&#44; whilst the least tendency to
                a general apostacy was prevailing among the Israelites&#44; whilst the masses had
                not yet learned enough of truth to prefer standing alone in the world to following
                the idolaters&#44; they should not be permitted to be where the newly ac&#8211;
                quired religion could be weakened of its force&#44; where the examples of others
                could at all interfere with the instruction of truth and light then revealed to
                them. The wandering&#44; therefore&#44; in the wilderness for forty years was&#44;
                it is admitted&#44; a punishment for disobedi&#8211; ence&#59; but at the same time
                it was like all evils of mankind&#44; in the providence of God&#44; directed for the
                ultimate happiness of Israel&#44; and through them of the world at large. Perhaps
                you and I&#44; brethren&#44; do not see this clearly&#59; but we see sufficient to

                were&#44; therefore&#44; doomed to perish in the wilderness &#59; whereas their
                children were educated in the path of duty under the inspection of the prophet and
                his priestly brother&#44; &#8212; the two who&#44; from the beginning of the
                promulgation of the joyful message of redemption up to the time of its

                only&#44; when Aaron made the calf for them upon their wild clamours. Thus then
                Israel by degrees learned to dispense with a love for Egypt&#39;s idols&#59; the
                fear of its taskmasters had never had any hold upon the minds of their children&#44;
                and perhaps a bitter feeling of in&#8211; dignation had been gradually implanted in
                them by the recital of the horrors which their parents occa&#8211; sionally made in
                their presence&#59; and it was therefore to be expected&#44; that with them there
                would be found sufficient devotion to the cause of the faith which had&#44; so to
                say&#44; become their birthright&#44; that they would be able to withstand the
                seduction of the customs of the Canaanitish nations&#44; whom they had been ordered
                to exterminate for the greatness of their crimes. From time to time&#44;
                however&#44; Ephraim loved his idols&#44; and Judah followed not rarely upon the

                opinions and actions of the vast majority of mankind&#44; and they deviated to such
                a degree that at length the prophet reproved them with the fearful denunciation&#44;

                they had become followers of vanity&#44; and other followers of vanity came and
                erpelled them out of their land&#44; and scattered them as seed is carried off by

                &#63; or are the habits of the gen&#8211; tiles more friendly to the preservation of
                its treasures than when all but we were worshippers of idols&#63; &#33;Neither is
                the case. The truth is yet precisely the same unchangeable emanation of God it was
                from the beginning &#59; as He has not&#44; cannot&#44; change&#44; so is the word

                REFLECTIONS ON THE PENTECOST. 299 DISCOURSE XX. REFLECTIONS ON THE PENTECOST. O God
                &#33; who knowest all that passes within thy world&#44; from whom none of our deeds
                is hidden&#44; let us pray Thee to strengthen us in thy knowledge&#44; and cause us
                to be guided by thy fear&#59; so that we may never trespass against thy will&#44;
                though no human eye be directed unto us or our doings. Yea&#44; let us be made
                conscious that Thou&#44; Father&#33; art ever present&#44; ever watchful and
                cognizant of our acts&#44; ever ready to visit with retribution our backsliding&#44;
                but also ever ready to approve of all the good we do&#44; and to hallow by thy
                blessing whatever is undertaken in the further&#8211; ance of the glory of thy
                kingdom&#44; and the prosperity of mankind&#44; those whom Thou didst create in thy
                im&#8211; age&#44; in thy divine likeness. Full often&#44; however&#44; does our
                mind wander after the things that are not good&#44; and we are allured after the
                imaginings of our heart&#44; and the unhallowed desires of our eyes. Let us&#44;
                there&#8211; fore&#44; pray Thee to implant deeply within us the per&#8211; ception
                of the beauties of thy religion&#44; that we may at once crush the tempter when he
                rises up in rebel&#8211; lion against thy will&#44; and to overcome successfully the
                opportuiijties to sin which our heedlessness so often seeks in the vain fancy&#44;
                that we of ourselves are able to overcome iniquity and to pursue what is good. But
                it is Thou only who givest us light&#44; it is thy law only which can guide us
                securely &#58; let us then <pb n="300"/> 300 REFLECTIONS ON THE PENTECOST. feel the
                truth and force of thy revelation&#44; that we may follow Thee in all Thou biddest
                us to do&#44; and that we may feel our entire dependence on thy blessing and
                instruction&#44; as did our fathers when they stood aflrighted at thy glory on the
                day of the gathering at Horeb&#44; when Thou earnest to institute them as thy
                people&#44; and to teach them thy wisdom and knowledge. Amen. Brethren &#33; After
                the ten commandments had been proclaimed in the hearing of the whole people of
                Israel&#44; they started back from the presence of the great glory that blazed on
                Sinai&#44; and they stood afar off. It was then that the prophet assured them of
                their safety&#59; for that only to prove their innermost soul&#44; and to render
                them permanent servants of the Lord had He come&#44; in or&#8211; der that his fear
                might be upon their faces&#44; so that they might not sin. And in conformity with
                this as&#8211; surance on the part of the prophet&#44; did God himself address
                through him the people&#44; as follows &#58; &#34;You yourselves have seen that from
                heaven I have spoken with you. You shall not make &#91;aught&#92; with me &#59; gods
                of silver and gods of gold you shall not make unto yourselves.&#34; Exod. xx.
                19&#44; 20. The divine Majesty had displayed a part of his glory&#44; had proved to
                mortals that there are pleasures other than those arising from carnal
                enjoyments&#59; and <pb n="301"/> REFLECTIONS ON THE PENTECOST. 301 had made them
                experience delights and knowledge diifering from any thing before attained by
                them&#59; and all this was done that they might be convinced that it was the Creator
                who spoke audibly to their ears&#44; that it was not a mortal being who had made
                himself heard in their presence. For there were more than two millions&#44;
                consisting of men&#44; women&#44; and chil&#8211; dren&#44; descendants of Jacob and
                the sons of the stran&#8211; ger&#44; who had united themselves to the covenant of
                God&#59; and still all heard the same words&#44; as all saw the same lire&#44; in
                the same moment and with one accord&#44; in a manner utterly unattainable were the
                speaker one like themselves&#44; were the sounds merely the effect of mortal
                organization. Yea&#44; the lire blazed&#44; and the earth quaked&#44; the mountain
                shook&#44; and the trumpet was exceedingly loud &#59; every thing was over&#8211;
                powering&#44; crushing with its unheard&#8211;of force&#58; and still there arose
                above the din and roar of the ele&#8211; ments&#44; despite of the terror which each
                one felt for his safety&#44; a clear and distinct voice&#44; which spoke in words
                ample and clear&#44; &#34;I am the Lord thy God&#58;&#34; no son of man whose power
                is limited&#44; no one born of woman who is destined to die&#59; but the everlasting
                One who was from the beginning&#44; before the hills were conceived and before the
                mountains were brouo&#58;ht forth&#44; who is now in the same strength&#44;
                vigour&#44; and intellect&#44; powerful alone among all that is fleeting&#44;
                intelligent alone among all that is subject to infirmity and decay&#44; and who will
                ever be&#44; yea&#44; when this earth shall have worn out in its revolutions in its
                prescribed orbit&#44; when the stars shall have become dimmed and shorn of their
                lustre &#59; when nature herself shall have served the purpose of her formation&#59;
                yea&#44; He who VOL. VI. 26 <pb n="302"/> 302 REFLECTIONS ON THE PENTECOST. even
                then&#44; and forever thereafter&#44; will be the same which He is now&#44; one&#44;
                alone&#44; great&#44; wise&#44; good&#44; and indivisible. This the people
                heard&#44; and they felt that no one but the Eternal could thus address them
                all&#44; could thus remove the veil from every eye&#44; and light up an imperishable
                fire in their souls &#59; and they stood ready to lend a willing ear to the other
                precepts which the Most High might prescribe for their guidance. Now observe&#44;
                brethren&#44; the great distinctness and force of the first commandment&#44; which
                enjoins on us to believe in the existence of the Godhead. There is no laboured
                definition attempted to say how the Holy One is constituted &#59; it even describes
                him not as en&#8211; dowed with any of the attributes which are so emi&#8211; nently
                his own&#44; which so peculiarly render Him the object of our adoration&#59; but we
                are simply referred to the miracles and power which He had displayed unto ourselves.
                &#34; I am the Lord ihy God who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt&#44; from
                the house of slavery.&#34; We had been taught by the display of the mercy and
                greatness of God in Egypt&#44; that He was not only superior to the vanities which
                our op&#8211; pressors adored&#44; but that He was unfettered by the powers
                implanted in the organization of outward mat&#8211; ter&#44; which we call&#44; for
                distinction&#39;s sake&#44; &#34; the laws of nature&#59;&#34; and therefore we are
                merely exhorted to accept as God the One whom our own convictions had forced us to
                acknowledge as our Deliverer&#59; as Moses also said in his song&#44; &#34; This is
                my God&#44; and I will glorify Him &#59; the God of my father&#44; and I will extol
                Him.&#34; Yea&#44; the announcement from Sinai was only a response to the previous
                conviction of every Israelitish heart&#59; and thus it struck a chord which <pb
                    n="303"/> REFLECTIONS ON THE PENTECOST. 303 still vibrates in unison with the
                current of our life&#44; as the descendants of those ransomed of the Lord&#44; who
                listened to his voice which gushed forth in awful sub&#8211; limity from the
                cloud&#8211;capped pinnacle of the sacred Horeb. But observe how utterly at variance
                with the presumed plurality of the godhead&#44; which so many believe to exist&#44;
                are the words of the Decalogue. The very hrst word is &#34;I am&#44;&#34; Hebrew
                ojn&#59; there is no conceivable construction which can transform it into any idea
                but a single&#44; individual&#44; sole speaker&#59; the same indeed who before that
                day&#44; when sending Mo&#8211; ses on his mission of redemption&#44; had declared
                him&#8211; self to be &#34;I will be the one who I will be&#59;&#34; and thus shalt
                thou say to the children of Israel&#44; I WILL BE has sent me unto you.&#34;
                dd&#39;in &#39;jnbiy n&#94;nx And why &#34; I will be &#63;&#34; Because at every
                moment of conceiv&#8211; able time it will be correct to say of God that He will yet
                be&#44; that there will be no end to his existence&#44; no change in his essence.
                For were it at all possible that He could cease to be&#44; the appellation &#34; I
                will be&#34; would not apply to him at the moment. Whereas&#44; He himself told
                Moses&#44; &#34; This is my name forever&#44; and this my memorial from generation
                to genera&#8211; tion.&#34; And were it possible that there could be any change in
                his existence&#44; that He could be endowed with a power at any future period which
                He did not possess at the beginning&#44; his memorial&#44; or the man&#8211; ner of
                invoking Him by his adorers&#44; would necessarily change. But how did Moses and the
                saints of ancient days invoke Him &#63; how was his memorial borne aloft on their
                pure&#44; inspired lips &#63; Even as the God Eter&#8211; nal&#44; the God of
                Abraham&#44; of Isaac&#44; and of Jacob &#59; and how constituted &#63; as the

                who alone is one &#59; as the same&#44; and by the same ap&#8211; pellation which He
                had applied to himself in the multitude of visions with which He blessed his
                early&#8211; servants. Farther&#44; we are told &#58; &#34; I am the Lord thy
                God&#44; J&#44; who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt.&#34; Again here is
                the singular number applied &#59; but one Eternal revealed himself to Abraham&#44;
                the same and but the one who then spoke on Sinai&#59; and it was but He alone who
                spoke of our fathers&#44; &#34; Israel is my son&#44; my first born&#59;&#34; and it
                was therefore but He alone who effected our redemption. Where&#44; we ask&#44; is
                the possibility of imagining that a combina&#8211; tion in the personality of the
                Godhead is thought of&#63; where the possibility to fix on a single expression
                wdiich would render it compatible with the sacred text that a delegation of power
                was in contemplation&#44; and a change in the saving mercy of God in tlie range of
                possibility &#63; Understand well&#44; brethren&#44; that the Bible must be taken as
                a whole&#44; one entire system of revelation &#59; you cannot wrench one passage
                from its connexion&#44; and say&#44; &#34; It teaches this particular doc&#8211;
                trine&#44;&#34; when this is in contradiction with other pas&#8211; sages &#59; and
                though there may be some colour of rea&#8211; son for your new discovery at a first
                sight&#44; depend upon it that you have misconceived&#44; in your eagerness for new
                things&#44; the spirit&#44; if not the palpable meaning of the text. If&#44;
                now&#44; you weigh well the few passages just quoted&#44; without going any farther
                into the long list which can easily be added&#44; they will clearly de&#8211;
                monstrate that&#44; as far as the book of Exodus is con&#8211; cerned&#44; it
                teaches precisely what we find in the bo &#59;&#33;c of Genesis&#44; and that the
                ideas of Adam&#44; yoah&#44; and our own immediate fathers&#44; were precisely the
                same <pb n="305"/> REFLECTIONS ON THE PENTECOST. 305 with those which Moses received
                in his revelation. This much we can insist upon as uncontrovertibly true&#44; that
                no one will discover any contradiction in the announcement to Abraham&#44; &#34; I
                am El Shad day&#44; walk before me and be perfect&#44;&#34; and the first precept of
                the Decalogue&#44; &#34; I am the Lord thy God&#58;&#34; nor be&#8211; tween the
                promise to Jacob&#44; &#34; I am the Lord&#44; the God of Abraham thy father&#44;
                and the God of Isaac&#44;&#34; and the one given to Moses&#44; &#34; I am the God of
                thy father&#44; the God of Abraham&#44; the God of Isaac&#44; and the God of
                Jacob.&#34; It is only by impressing in early child&#8211; hood the mind with views
                essentially differing from ours&#44; that one can be brought to acquiesce in their
                correctness &#59; and when this has been done&#44; there will be no difficulty in
                finding means to reconcile the most emphatic expressions of Scripture with views
                alto&#8211; gether different from what they ostensibly say. Hence should any one
                bring up&#44; in his advocacy of foreign principles&#44; reasons professedly drawn
                from the Bible&#44; you should not be surprised at the startling boldness with which
                error endeavours to uphold itself&#59;&#34; but meet him calmly and
                dispassionately&#44; with the words which declare that the Lord changes not&#44;
                that He is as He always was and ever will be&#44; the Lord one&#44; the God who
                created the world&#44; the God who chose Abra&#8211; ham as his servant &#59; the
                same God who spoke to us on Sinai&#44; in his own majesty&#44; without mediator or
                messenger&#59; and the same God&#44; at last&#44; who&#44; in his own time&#44;
                &#34;will redeem the world from error&#44; and cause his jSTame to be invoked by all
                mankind&#44; even as He now is by the sons of Jacob&#44; who have for his glory so
                long borne the contumely of the world&#44; the hatred of the ungodly. 26&#42; <pb
                    n="306"/> 306 REFLECTIONS ON THE PENTECOST. Let US once more revert to the ideas
                of the Patri&#8211; archs on the subject the dearest to them&#44; to the prop&#8211;
                agation of which their lives were devoted&#59; I mean their love for their faith
                &#58; and how do we find them appealing to the Deity &#63; Evidently in a direct
                man&#8211; ner&#44; asking of Him the grace and favour which He alone could bestow.
                Abraham entreated Him to dis&#8211; tinguish between the guilty and innocent at the
                threat&#8211; ened destruction of the cities of the plain&#44; and also invoked the
                Lord when he petitioned for favour to&#8211; wards his son Ishmael. Li sending out
                Eleazer to obtain a wife for his son&#44; he speaks of the God before whom he had
                walked&#44; and expresses his belief that He would send his angel before him&#44;
                and enable him to accomplish his mission. Isaac&#44; when he blessed his son&#44;
                also speaks directly &#58; &#34; And may the God Shadday bless thee.&#34; Jacob only
                knew the God of his father&#44; and in his name he exhorts his children to
                obedience&#44; and on Him did he rely for aid in the day of his distress. Let any
                one show to us in all the passages referring to these favourites of God&#44; that
                they know any thing of a mediatorial power&#59; that they had any conception of a
                combination of person&#8211; ages to whom worship is due &#58; and it will then be
                time enough to discuss whether or not there is a mis&#8211; conception of the terms
                employed. But as far as known to me&#44; there is not a single phrase in any
                translation of the Hebrew&#44; much less in the original text itself&#44; which can
                be tortured into such an assump&#8211; tion &#59; on the contrary&#44; the constant
                use of the same word&#44; the uniform allusion to the greatness and power of the
                same eternal sole God&#44; ever reappearing when we could expect it to be mentioned

                intermediate agent between God and man&#44; whose merits alone&#44; as is
                alleged&#44; can reconcile us to Heaven&#44; must be enough to convince
                Israelites&#44; at least&#44; that the view under question is anti&#8211;Jewish no
                more than anti&#8211;Scriptural&#44; and&#44; what is the same&#44; contrary to the
                truth as revealed to us from our heav&#8211; enly Father. He has made himself known
                to us by the mouth of many prophets&#44; as the holy ONE of Is&#8211; rael and his
                Redeemer &#59; as such He was ever invoked among our assemblies &#59; and&#44; if we
                at all understand the mission of the sons of Jacob&#44; it is their vocation to
                uphold this great idea of the plenary power of one Creator and Redeemer&#44; as a
                beacon to the other na&#8211; tions&#44; that they may ultimately come and seek
                shel&#8211; ter under the same overshadowing wings of Provi&#8211; dence&#44; under
                which we have found protection&#44; from our tirst institution as a people until
                this very hour&#59; and with his blessing we will still continue to bear aloft the

                law has had on your understanding. Human agency could not have reached you all at
                one time&#59; and yet it is but a mo&#8211; ment&#44; as it were&#44; since you came
                to the foot of Sinai&#59; the day on which you had assembled has not yet waned&#44;
                and behold&#44; everlasting truths have been ever&#8211; lastingly fixed in your
                very being as Israelites. Other nations are so by the possession of one common
                coun&#8211; try&#44; or one protecting government. But you are ren&#8211; dered
                one&#44; through the instrumentality of what you have heard &#59; and be this
                mission then forever yours&#44; to know me only&#44; your God&#44; in whatever place

                may permit you to mention my name&#44; there I will come&#44; and there I will bless
                you. But you must never presume to associate any thing or being in my glory&#59; you
                have not felt any helping hand in Egypt save my own &#59; therefore you shall not
                ask favour and protection from any one besides me&#44; since there is no inherent
                power in any creature&#44; and all existing things are so by my will&#59; I alone
                know the secrets of the heart&#44; to me alone are revealed the thoughts of all my

                appeal for protection to my bounty&#44; since this alone is all&#8211;suffi&#8211;
                cient for the whole mass of creatures&#44; from the highest to the lowest. The truth
                which you have learnt this day is to abide with you forever&#59; this day you have

                unwavering and firm to the truth which cannot be changed. Do not even represent the
                unseen Deity by any arbitrary figure which you may imagine to represent Him to your
                outward senses&#59; there is no possibility of picturing the ideal greatness of the
                One who pervades all with his spirit&#59; no pre&#8211; cious metal can hallow the
                unrighteous design&#44; no skill of the sculptor can sanctify the daring rebellion
                against your King. This in brief is the explanation which the connexion between the
                verses of our text seems naturally to re&#8211; quire&#59; it bases the
                acknowledgment of the Deity as the sole Sovereign upon what the people had
                them&#8211; selves seen and heard&#59; no other argument is appealed to&#44; no
                other reason is assigned for the faith demanded of them. If&#44; then&#44; we are
                asked&#44; in our intercourse with the world&#44; to forsake what we have so long
                guarded&#44; and to join ourselves to the masses who profess to understand the words
                of the Scripture bet&#8211; ter than we their first recipients&#58; we will
                answer&#44; that we have been placed as sentinels over the watch&#8211;tower of
                religion&#44; with the double&#8211;edged sword of revealed truth in our hands&#44;
                our quiver filled by the arrows of wisdom&#44; which are drawn from the law. We have
                been placed upon this custody to time without end&#44; till the day4&#59;hat the
                Master of our life himself shall come and ttbsolve us from our duty. This He has
                never yet done&#59; and day follows on day&#44; and year on year&#44; and still we
                discover the same Goodness which guided the world in the beginning&#59; and though

                quenched&#44; and its thunders stilled&#44; the effect which they witnessed&#44; the
                proclama&#8211; tion of the word is still with us in that holy law which is
                treasured up in yonder ark. We have only ever known one God and one revelation. For
                the sake of acknowledging the one&#44; and following the other&#44; the waters of
                tribulation have often passed over our heads&#44; and nations have leagued together
                to tear us from our adherence to our sacred trust. But hitherto all their efforts
                have been in vain&#44; and we assemble as yet at this distant day in many a
                town&#44; and many a land&#44; to worship the Lord God of Israel&#44; in the manner
                in which He himself was pleased to appoint for us&#59; and the truth&#44; though
                often assailed&#44; has never yet wanted true and undaunted defenders. Let us then
                instruct our children&#44; and those who are not firm in their de&#8211; votion to
                the Lord&#44; to love Ilim beyond all&#44; and to swear unwavering fealty to the
                religion which He has proclaimed. There is yet no other god but He&#59; there has
                arisen no saviour who can shield us from his wrath &#59; He has acquired no
                attribute which was not his from the beginning&#58; and hence we can admit of no
                articles of faith which we did not receive when the law was given from Sinai&#59;
                whilst at the same time we are bound to adhere to all the precepts which we find it
                in our power to accomplish&#44; and to abstain from whatever the will of our Father
                has interdicted to us. It matters not whether the deviation be gross idolatry or
                erroneous ideas of the nature of the God&#8211; head&#59; for we are enjoined
                against two things&#44; &#34;To make nothing as God besides the Holy One&#44; nor to
                represent Him under images of silver and gold.&#34; Hence should the seduction come
                under whatever <pb n="311"/> THE BEST VIRTUE. 311 guise it may&#44; we are equally
                bound to reject it&#44; and to abide true&#44; in singleness of faith and unshaken
                hope&#44; to that standard of excellence which was un&#8211; furled before our

                alle&#8211; giance ever since&#44; though often sinning against the wisdom which was
                imparted to us as our heritage. And let us entreat our Father that He will vouchsafe
                to render us quick in the knowledge of his word&#44; and make us worthy to receive
                his renewed favour&#44; when his servant&#44; the son of David&#44; shall again

                acclamation of thousands&#44; hailed as the victor in a bloody fight when the enemy
                cowered before his prowess&#44; and followed by the mul&#8211; titude of soldiers
                who were led on their war steeds to the murderous charge inspired by his

                business of existence is concentrated&#44; and he seizes on the one for which he has

                satisfaction&#44; no stilling of the craving for happiness has resulted from the
                success which has attended him &#59; whereas in truth he has been chasing after

                their place &#59; and he turns away disgusted with hfe&#44; weary of the burden of
                existence. But it is natural to conclude that there are pursuits within our
                reach&#44; or at least one road which we may follow&#44; where this weariness will
                not be the sole re&#8211; ward of our toil&#44; or else human life would be a dreary
                waste&#44; with no shelter from the storms of adversity which accompany us from the
                cradle to the grave. Well was it&#44; therefore&#44; that the wise teacher in Israel
                propounded to his scholars the serious inquiry &#58; &#34; Go and see which is the
                right way in which a man should persevere &#63;&#34; They knew at once that the man
                who had never sought the pleasures which men call en&#8211; joyment&#44; nor those
                distinctions which are called great&#8211; ness&#44; did not mean to direct their
                attention to pleasure&#44; wealth&#44; worldly wisdom&#44; or renown&#44; but to the
                best interests of life&#44; the pursuit of righteousness &#59; and they&#44; though
                differing in their replies&#44; all aimed at the same end. The first thought that
                the great end of happiness would be best gained by contentment with our lot&#44; and
                by not looking with envy upon the happiness of others&#44; which quality of the mind
                is expressed by the Hebrew &#8211; phrase&#44; n&#94;iD &#92;y &#8212; &#34; a good
                eye.&#34; Another one believed that to be always sure of being able to persevere in

                good&#44; who would naturally confirm us in virtuous resolves&#44; and never lead us
                through their persuasion upon the ways of sin and transgression. Another again
                thought that no matter how many good friends we have&#44; if we are surrounded on
                all sides by evil&#8211; doers&#44; whose example is always before us&#44; we may
                gradually be drawn to regard iniquity with indifier&#8211; <pb n="316"/> 316 THE

                have ceased to look upon them with aver&#8211; sion and on their deeds with
                abhorrence &#59; wherefore we pray in our daily devotions&#58; &#34;And deliver us
                from &#8212; a bad man&#44; from evil imagination&#44; from an evil associate&#44;
                from an evil neighbour&#44;&#34; so that we may not be led by the advice or example
                of others to forsake the dictates of the divine religion. &#8212; Another one of the
                Rabbi&#39;s scholars was of the opinion that a careful investigation of the probable
                result of actions is a happy means of preserving us from evil &#59; for let any one
                endowed with sound judgment look upon the results which spring from crime and
                irreligion in others&#44; and he cannot help being struck with the con&#8211;
                viction that naught but sorrow to the sinner himself&#44; and trouble to those who
                surround him&#44; can result from a forsaking of the line of strict duty which
                reli&#8211; gion demands of her votaries. There can be no ques&#8211; tion that all
                the recommendations of these four are eminently calculated to cause a man to
                persevere in virtue and piety&#44; and to render him a faithful servant of his

                good&#44; which is neverthe&#8211; less the actual evil in its tendency. &#8212; But
                the last of those who resolved in their minds the problem of a happy life&#44;
                thought he discovered the solution not so much in outward circumstances&#44; in
                influences acting from without upon the spirit within&#44; as in the improve&#8211;
                ment of the source of sensibilities and the feelings which he imagined can only act
                beneficially&#44; if it bear in good truth within itself all the antagonizing
                energies which can combat successfully against the evils&#44; or rather the evil
                tendencies which are so plentifully scattered through life. He therefore
                answered&#44; &#34; The best means for the attainment of a pious and happy life is a
                good heart.&#34; Let us see a moment what this aphorism includes. By the term heart
                we generally understand the power of will and desire which is inherent in man&#44;
                by which&#44; though attracted to any object from its capacity of pleasing him at
                first sight&#44; he is enabled nevertheless to forego its acquisition by the control
                he has over himself&#44; without any outward compulsion being exerted upon him to
                prevent his choice&#44; or to direct it into another channel. A good heart then
                would mean a disposition to forego the commission of what religion terms evil&#44;
                and to love the practice of what is demanded of us as our duty&#44; and not merely a
                kindliness of feeling&#44; which is com&#8211; inonly called good nature&#44; and
                arises very often more from an indolence of temper than from any absolute love of
                what is really virtuous and holy. The Rabbi thought that this was the true essence
                of the duties of life&#44; and preferred it to the other means proposed&#44; as
                it&#44; according to him&#44; embraced all the others. If we now come to investigate
                the 27&#42; <pb n="318"/> 318 THE BEST VIRTUE. motives which govern lis in onr
                actions&#44; in illustra&#8211; tion of the correctness of Rabbi Yochanan&#39;s
                judg&#8211; ment&#44; we cannot help being struck with the singular combination of
                causes which not unfrequentlj prompt us. We imagine not rarely that we act honestly
                and uprightly from pure love of righteousness and jus&#8211; tice. But let us look a
                little deeper into our heart&#44; and we must be startled that it was vanity&#44;
                love of praise&#44; perhaps the wicked motive of shaming others whom we hate by
                exhibiting our superior excellence&#44; which impelled us to be active in the
                commission of a virtuous deed or the bestowal of benefits on others. There may be a
                smile of approbation playing around artful Ups&#44; whilst the inner man feels
                disapprobation and contempt&#59; there may be outwardly a decent con&#8211; formity
                to the wishes of others&#44; whilst the heart ab&#8211; hors what the hands perform.
                Kow the question is&#44; &#34; Can this be virtue &#63; will it stand the test of
                tempta&#8211; tion &#63; will it be the same when the public gaze is withdrawn&#44;
                when we are alone in the presence of our Father in heaven&#44; when the approbation
                of those whom we desire to please is not likely to be ob&#8211; tained &#63; &#34;
                Evidently virtue of this kind is but a mockery of the name&#44; it is hollow&#44;
                insincere&#44; fleeting as thought itself&#44; varying in its exhibition as the
                temper of those with whom we are associated. Still the word of God is uniform&#44;
                it prescribes one rule under all circumstances of life&#44; and teaches us that
                wherever we are the eye of the Lord surveys all our actions. How then shall we train
                ourselves&#44; in order that this knowledge may have its full weight in prompting
                our deeds &#63; Even by schooling daily our will and our desires &#59; by exalting

                reflection and a careful study of what God has written for our instruction&#44; and
                by forming the others so that they may be quick in perceiving when indulgence would
                offend against the strict line of observance&#44; and when it is either harmless or
                use&#8211; ful. This training must&#44; of right&#44; commence with early
                infancy&#44; when the impressions are yet few&#44; when the soul has not yet been
                poisoned by the un&#8211; holy influences which are continually at work around us.
                It is then that we should ceaselessly study the legacy of divine wisdom which is
                treasured up in the Bible &#59; investigate what the indulgence of any feeling or
                desire will lead to &#59; and then resolve to eradicate from ourselves all those
                aspirations which we have been taught and which we have discovered will lead us unto
                transtrression. Let us instance a common failing&#44; obstinacy&#44; which has its
                origin in an over&#8211; weening esteem of our own powers&#44; and the light value
                which we put upon the judgment&#44; rights&#44; and knowledge of others. This
                foible&#44; when indulged in for a length of time&#44; will induce us to persevere
                in any resolution we have once taken&#44; let the conse&#8211; quences be what they
                may &#59; it is enough for us that we have resolved &#59; an oftence has been
                committed against ourselves&#44; and we will not unite any more with those who have
                done this injury to our self&#8211;love &#59; and let justice go unheeded&#44; let

                however&#44; that we commence betimes plac&#8211; ing a well&#8211;founded distrust
                in our own opinion&#44; that we learn truly that we are liable to form&#44; in the
                mo&#8211; ment of excitement&#44; certain opinions and resolves which are wrong in
                principle and injurious in their tendency&#44; that the best way of refuting an
                unfounded prejudice prevailing against us is by showing that we do not deserve it
                &#58; and how readily will we forego our own ill&#8211;will when it comes in
                conflict with our line of duty. It may be that&#44; with all our striving to forget
                the injury&#44; we cannot think well of those who have done the wrong &#58; still
                this will not prevent us&#44; as in reason and religion it ought not&#44; from
                uniting with them in carrying out what is good&#8211; and benefi&#8211; cial in

                watchfulness over thy heart &#59; for out of it are the issues of life&#59;&#34;
                meaning that we should be care&#8211; ful how we imagine our feelings to be
                correct&#44; and how necessary a constant watching becomes&#44; lest we be deceived
                in ourselves&#44; and give way to senti&#8211; ments the end of which is corruption.
                Just as &#34; life and death are in the power of the tongue &#34; according to the
                opinion of the wisest of men&#44; so does he here insist&#44; that in order to

                necessity be led. If then we see that our desires are in conflict with the will of

                of transgression&#44; and to introduce in their stead the proper incentives to
                piety. For in&#8211; stance&#44; if we observe that we are inclined to
                selfish&#8211; ness&#44; to an indulgence in revenge and hatred to the prejudice of
                our neighbours&#58; we should set about in sober earnestness to correct the evil by
                dwelling with peculiar care upon the precept&#44; &#34; Thou shalt love thy
                neighbour as thyself.&#34; Surely selfishness&#44; revenge&#44; and hatred&#44; with
                all their odious train&#44; are in direct conflict with this paramount duty&#59;
                hence they must be removed&#44; in order that the kingdom of God may be established
                in us through our love for our fei low&#8211; beings. If we experience that we are
                covetous&#44; that the success of others gives us pain&#44; their sorrows on the
                contrary afiPord us an unhallowed pleasure &#58; we can&#8211; not consistently with
                our obligation to the ten com&#8211; mandments and other portions of Scripture
                continue in such delinquency&#44; although as yet no overt act has given outward
                evidence of the wickedness within. The spring of life is obstructed by unhallowed
                senti&#8211; ments&#44; and it needs must be cleansed&#44; before the Lord can dwell

                we shall then have the best remedy against sin &#58; we shall have contentment with

                except it be for their im&#8211; provement&#44; and carefully avoid every act the
                conse&#8211; quence of which can be in the least injurious to the peace of our
                spirit. The man of a good heart&#44; in brief&#44; whose will and whose desires are
                bounded in everything by the limits of God&#39;s word&#44; will cheer&#8211; fully

                portion of his inclina&#8211; tions&#44; which as he is of the earth daily draw him
                to the earth. But let it not be imagined that there can be any intermission&#44; any
                period of our life when we can stop with thus improving our sentiment&#59; or that
                we of ourselves have strength enough to perfect the work of God&#44; Neither is the
                case. If it requires constant practice to reach any measurable perfection in the
                arts&#44; and when this escapes again from us if we do not constantly&#8211; repeat
                to ourselves the lessons we have acquired&#59; if in ordinary transactions of life
                we require a teacher by whose aid we can best over&#8211; come the difficulty with

                be the case in the attainment of the art of life which to solve is our only problem
                on earth. It may then safely be assumed&#44; that though we have overcome
                selfishness and pride to&#8211;day&#44; they will have to be combatted again
                to&#8211;mcfiTOw&#44; perhaps not with the same labour as at first&#44; but still
                with some exertion at all events &#59; and nevertheless there are occasions when the

                which is always human&#44; though well fortified by religious knowledge and an
                habitual def&#8211; erence to the will of Heaven. In the same manner would it be
                impossible for us to subdue ourselves&#44; if we did not cast our hopes on our
                Father and look to Him for aid in the purification which we may have commenced.
                Self&#8211;safiiciency is the very opposite of piety&#59; no one who knows the
                plague of his heart will say that he has any inherent power for real good&#59; it is
                his business to make the beginning&#44; to feel that he is sinful&#59; but when this
                commencement has been made&#44; he ought to cast himself entirely on the un&#8211;
                bought mercy of God to aid him in his contest for righteousness&#44; which is so
                necessary for his salvation. And if we commence and progress in this seeking for
                salvation&#44; the labour will become daily of easier ac&#8211; complishment&#59;
                one by one the impurities will be cast forth &#59; one by one the sacred impulses
                will occupy their place&#59; and as we lose day by day some of the youthful vigour
                of our frame&#44; the virtues which ought to grace us as servants of God will
                increase in inten&#8211; sity and become more numerous and beautiful&#44; until our
                dying bed will be surrounded by that glory which alone is the portion of the
                righteous who have done the will of their Father. The heart is then truly well
                guarded&#44; its possessor being conscious of his weak&#8211; ness&#44; whilst the
                Author of our being is constantly in&#8211; voked to give it strength&#44; and his
                revelation unceas&#8211; ingly looked to to impart sanctity to its promptings&#44;

                Israel &#33; we beseech Thee to animate our hearts by thy blessed spirit&#44; which
                renders man quick in understanding and wise in the true knowledge of the things that
                pertain to salvation. Let us be deeply impressed with the contemplation of thy
                greatness&#44; and feel how exalted Thou art&#44; how worthless and helpless all
                else beside&#44; even those things to which the uninstructed children of the dust
                render homage and adoration. Eternal God&#33; be Thou the aid of thy chosen
                people&#44; the por&#8211; tion selected from the rest of men to testify of thy
                unity and thy undivided power. Lo &#33; mankind rise up against them in every
                age&#44; in each generation &#59; they forge counsel to extirpate thy name from
                their mouth&#44; thy love from their hearts&#59; they desire that we shall mingle
                with them&#44; and bow down to stocks and stones&#44; and to pray to a god who
                cannot save. But thou art the Guardian of Israel&#59; behold&#44; thy providence
                sleepeth not&#44; thy mercy slumbereth not. Let then thy goodness come to our
                aid&#44; frustrate the device of the cunning&#44; who strive by false reasoning&#44;
                by specious appeals&#44; by the effects of bribery and cor&#8211; ruption to disrupt
                our unity &#59; and shatter the power of the tyrant who&#44; in his vain reliance on
                human strength&#44; presumes to uproot what Thou hast planted &#59; <pb n="327"/>
                Israel&#39;s warfare. 327 to obliterate what Thou hast written&#59; to pnll down
                what thy own hands have built. Yea&#44; do this because Thou art merciful&#44; and
                because of the covenant which Thou madest with our fathers&#44; to be unto them a
                God&#44; and to their children after them. Amen. Brethren &#33; In the section of
                the Law which we have read to&#8211; day&#44; you will Und a full account of the
                attempt of the king of Moab to entail a curse upon the people of Israel through the
                fancied power of the heathen pro&#8211; phet Bileam&#44; whom he sent for from
                Pethor&#44; which was on the river Euphrates&#44; in order to aid him in the
                proposed struggle against the nation which had come up from Egypt&#44; and which was
                then lying in camp on the borders of his kingdom. The messen&#8211; gers of the
                Moabite king&#44; as we learn&#44; accordingly repaired to the house of the
                prophet&#59; but he&#44; not daring to go with them at once before having received
                the permission of the Most High&#44; who occasionally made himself manifest to this
                lover of idolaters&#44; though he knew their worship to be vain&#44; requested the
                ambassadors to remain with him that night&#44; in the hopes of being able to comply
                in the morning with the desire of their master. But during the night the expected
                vision revealed to him the will of God&#44; that he should abstain from the
                contemplated journey&#44; and the Lord told him &#58; &#34; Thou sbalt not go with
                them &#59; thou shalt not curse the people&#44; for it is blessed.&#34; Numbers
                xxii. 12. <pb n="328"/> 328 Israel&#39;s warfare. We are in our days often surprised
                at the apparently marvellous aversion which nonrlsraelites entertain for our
                race&#44; and at the concerted action which potentates&#44; statesmen&#44; and the
                rulers of churches devise to wipe out the name of Jew from the history of the
                day&#59; the history of the day&#44; I speak advisedly &#59; for from the history of
                the past it would be&#44; even to their heated imagination&#44; an
                impossibility&#59; since there it is indelibly stamped&#44; and it belongs
                confessedly&#44; even according to those who hate us&#44; to the bearers of
                civil&#8211; ization&#44; and to the first family of men who combatted successfully
                against the misrule of tyrants on earth&#44; and against the spirit of folly which
                threatened to submerge all the high aspirations of the soul in the whirlpool of a
                false conception of the power and nature of the Creative Principle. Yes&#44; our
                enemies do confess&#44; not because they wish to do so&#44; but be&#8211; cause they
                are reluctantly compelled&#44; that without us&#44; or some other similar
                agency&#44; which&#44; however&#44; has never existed&#44; they could never have
                soared above the degradation of heathenism&#44; which prostrates the body before the
                civil ruler&#44; and the spirit before the priest who vainly pretends to interpret
                to man the will of beings that do not exist&#44; and have no power to save. Many of
                us are therefore astonished that in this age&#44; the so&#8211;called enlightened
                nineteenth century&#44; there should be witnessed&#44; despite of the march of
                intelli&#8211; gence&#44; education&#44; and scientific discovery&#44; such an
                inveterate hostility to the Jews as such&#59; we do not mean precisely to them as
                men&#44; but to them as mem&#8211; bers of a distinct race&#44; glorying avowedly in
                profess&#8211; ing doctrines in many points at variance with those professed by
                other portions of men. We are so apt <pb n="329"/> Israel&#39;s warfare. 329 to look
                upon the present period as something so far removed from all that is illiberal and
                unreasonable&#44; that we forget that in the next fifty years we may be
                reo&#8211;arded as belonging to an era far inferior to the one then existing&#44;
                and that that one will surely be lightly esteemed in the same light by its later
                successors. Every generation is pure in its own conceit&#44; just as every
                individual is righteous if he is himself to be the judge. But as in this latter
                respect we are bound to learn to regard ourselves as others regard us&#44; although
                we be not able to form so harsh a judgment as others pronounce over us&#58; so also
                must we as a collective body&#44; as the people of an age&#44; take great heed not
                to pronounce a panegyric so extravagant over our progress&#44; that a succeeding
                period may have well&#8211; founded reason to laugh at the self&#8211;complacent
                folly of the men of the present time. In brief&#44; we have not to this day made so
                great a progress ourselves&#44; as to place us beyond the occurrences of former
                years&#59; and it is to be feared that the progress in the next one or two hundred
                years will not be so rapid&#44; unless by special intervention of Providence&#44; as
                to cure the world of that illiberality which&#44; though so great a blot on human
                reason&#44; still cleaves to us as a garment of which no exertion of ours&#44; it
                would appear&#44; can divest ourselves. But there are men among us who regard the
                present era as something so far superior to any which have preceded it&#44; that
                they express a perfect burst of astonishment at any event which tends to rob their
                darling age of any of its false laurels. In this century&#44; they imagine&#44; the
                Jew need not be any longer the Jew of the fourteenth or eigh&#8211; teenth&#59; but
                he has now&#44; according to these philoso&#8211; 28&#42; <pb n="330"/> 330
                Israel&#39;s warfare. phers&#44; a different mission. He has met with liberty&#44;
                with protection&#44; with the smiles of the governments of the earth&#59; and hence
                he can safely dispense&#44; so they aver&#44; with much which deeply concerned him
                in ages gone by&#44; but is now entirely useless. These men of the day do
                acknowledge that&#44; when the sword of persecution was unsheathed&#44; when every
                eye looked on us to hate&#44; when every hand was lifted up to smite without
                mercy&#44; without restraint &#8212; yes&#44; that then it was well for the Jews to
                look forward to a period of redemption&#44; to the coming of a redeemer&#44; who
                should break for them the yoke which rested heavily on their shoulders&#44; and
                cause them to live in peace and harmony in their own land. But that now a change has
                come over the face of our dream&#59; we are no longer hated by the world&#59; Ave
                are citizens of the state&#44; equals in the eyes of the law&#44; and we suffer no
                injury because we believe in a blessed Unity&#44; the sole and alone existing
                Creator. Plence every land is our Palestine&#44; every city our Jerusalem&#44; every
                synagogue our temple. Hence it would be uncitizen&#8211; like to pray for the
                restoration of Israel to Pales&#8211; tine&#59; to look forward with a longing eye
                to the day when the wilderness shall bloom in beauty and fruit&#8211; fulness&#44;
                when Jerusalem shall be rebuilt&#44; and the son of David shall rule over the
                assembled faithful&#59; and it would be high treason to the rulers of the different
                countries in which we live to believe that on the day of the Lord the princes and
                kings of the earth shall be humbled before his chosen servant&#44; who is to unite
                all mankind in one pure worship&#44; in one bond of uni&#8211; versal fellowship.
                For men like those just mentioned the name of Israelite is nothing but an
                abstraction&#44; <pb n="331"/> ISRAEL&#39;S WARFARE. 331 that of a professor of
                certain dogmas&#44; who must&#44; how&#8211; ever&#44; have DO thought of a separate
                nationality&#44; of a distiuct government&#44; of an especial home&#59; it is enough
                for him to be a subject of Prussia&#44; a native of France&#44; a denizen of
                Britain&#44; a citizen of America&#59; he must not aspire to the higher hope of
                being in himself&#44; or any one of his descendants&#44; a member of the new divine
                commonwealth&#44; where righteousness is to be the only signal to confer
                distinction&#44; and fraternal love and mutual justice are the only rules of the
                state. Hence our modern citizen of the world is astonished that in his days of
                fancied redemption he is so often met by flat contradictions of his assumed
                accomplish&#8211; ment of prophecy&#59; that he finds&#44; although he be a member
                of a legislative assembly in France&#44; a fellow&#8211; Israelite is not permitted
                to wear an ancestral garb in Russia&#59; that while he exercises the functions of a
                magistrate in the Antilles&#44; those of the same kindred with him are banished for
                the sake of their faith in Poland and Persia. Every where he meets the rude arm of
                power extended against Israel &#59; every where he finds that he has still to
                struggle with the spirit of zealotism and illiberality&#44; yea in the very
                countries where he is undistinguished by law and privilege from the other
                inhabitants&#59; every where he is reminded that Israelites and their faith are not
                the objects of a tender regard on the part of those who believe in other creeds. And
                why &#63; Simply and because we are yet in captivity&#44; let the so&#8211;called
                liberal vaunt of the superior enlightenment of the age as they please&#59; and there
                is yet the same necessity for the hope in a brighter future&#44; as when the sword
                raged furiously in every land&#44; and the name of Jew was universally <pb n="332"/>
                332 Israel&#39;s warfare. the watchword to hatred and persecution. There is no hope
                for Israel&#39;s tranquillity save in their own land&#44; and we cannot expect to
                avoid annoyance and molestation from zealots under any form of alien gov&#8211;
                ernments. Yet whilst we strictly observe the laws of the countries where we
                reside&#44; and are kind neigh&#8211; bours and peacefnl citizens&#58; we are not
                guilty of treason against the various homes which we have acquired&#44; nor
                disobedient to the rulers of the earth&#44; by believing that at some future
                time&#44; be this far away or near&#44; we shall have a commonwealth of our own&#44;
                of which it was said by Isaiah of old&#44; &#34; And I will set peace as thy
                authority&#44; and righteousness as thy task&#8211; masters.&#34; &#40;Ix. 17.&#41;

                ammunition and accoutrements of war&#8211; like array&#44; nor are your steps

                when all that is perishable shall have vanished into the noth&#8211; ingness to
                which it was doomed from the origin of things. The believing Israelite then sees
                nothing in what passes around him but a continuation of the ancient warfare of error
                against truth&#59; it was the same in the days of Abraham&#44; nay&#44; before then
                even&#44; in the sinning of the generations of the flood and of the Babylonian
                tower. It is not for us to ask&#44; why Prov&#8211; idence permits not the good
                cause to triumph at once &#63; it is&#39; his wisdom which suffers this&#44; and
                enough for us that we are a portion of the power militant which has been appointed
                to stand as the bulwark of truth on the day of her tribulation. Since now Ave

                simple faith the discordant and disjointed ideas which they entertain of the
                sal&#8211; vation of man. All sectarians&#44; as we know&#44; differ widely among
                themselves&#59; but upon the one point they agree&#44; they dislike the presence of
                the Hebrews&#44; these are a living contradiction of all their doctrines&#44; and
                hence they send&#44; as Balak did&#44; to the rebellious Bileam who saw the vision
                of his Maker&#44; unto those originally of Israel&#44; but who have rebelled against
                their God&#44; to come and lure away the ignorant&#44; the designing&#44; and the

                temned the prophetic warnings by exhibiting in their speech and their acts the

                had usurped dominion over the spirit&#44; and in consequence forgetfulness of the
                rights of man characterized those who bore rule in Israel &#59; for with the
                departure of a submission to the dominion of the heavenly King had also departed the
                love for his creatures in those who had learned to imitate the customs of the

                deceivers to suppose prosperity to be the result of propitiating tutelary divinities
                &#59; and though they became daily more en&#8211; slaved by their ruthless

                oppression by a sincere observance of the Scripture&#8211;precepts&#44; which would

                pilhirs were not uphekl by obedience to the divine will. The peace&#44; he therefore
                felt convinced&#44; was deceptive &#59; the glory was but mocking the eye &#59; and
                whilst all seemed to be firm and established&#44; the rot&#8211; ten fabric was
                hastening to decay&#44; to a revulsion than which the world has never known any more
                thorough and mournful. Judah was to his mind&#39;s eye driven from her home&#44; and
                the streets of Zion were deserted of their inhabitants. Just as one builds a hut of
                the frail materials which the vine offer to guard the prod&#8211; ucts of the
                vineyard during the time of the ripening of the fruit&#44; only to desert it when
                the chill season of winter renders this care no longer necessary&#59; or as one puts

                a few short nights in the season of gathering the cucumbers&#44; only to leave it
                speedily to decay&#58; just so was Israel&#39;s glory&#44; the city of Zion&#44; to
                be rendered desolate and forsaken&#44; a monument through its ruins&#44; scarcely
                discernible in their decay for what purpose they were originally intended&#44; that
                such a town had once been&#44; though now no longer in existence. Or like a besieged
                city from which no one goes forth&#44; into which none enters&#44; which in silence
                awaits the assault of the besiegers&#44; forsaken by false friends who hasten not to
                its relief&#58; just so should the remnant of Jerusalem&#39;s inhabitants be&#44;
                cut off&#34; from the sympathy of mankind&#44; exiled from their home&#44; not
                allowed even to mourn over their fallen fortunes near the ruins of their sanctuary.

                that the entire destruction then predicted would actually take place&#44; he might
                still have imagined that it would be merely a temporary defeat&#44; from which the
                people could re&#8211; cover by the gaining of a battle&#44; or by a treaty with the
                enemy however disadvantageous. But even this dream of returning prosperity&#44;
                through human ef&#8211; forts&#44; was taken from the people by the emphatic
                declaration&#44; that only through the mercy of the Lord a small remnant should
                escape&#59; for otherwise and excluding this the destruction should be as complete
                as that of the cities of the plain&#44; the very site of which is now usurped by the
                sluggish waters of the Dead Sea&#44; the sombreness of which is enlivened by hardly

                enemies&#44; and so far as fulfilment was concerned&#44; the retribution seemed as
                distant as ever. The prophet completed his earthly pilgrimage&#44; and the walls of
                Zion stood yet unmoved&#44; and the morning&#8211;sun touched with golden light day
                by day the glorious pinnacles of the sacred edifice on Moriah. But did the vengeance

                deepest sor&#8211; row which flowed forth from the heart of the priest of Anathoth
                when he beheld the realization of all that had been pre&#8211;announced&#44; there
                are mingled also thoughts breathing the purest resignation&#44; inasmuch as the Lord
                was righteous because his word had been disobeyed&#59; and both justified the decree
                which fol&#8211; lowed upon the abandonment of the path of salva&#8211; tion&#44;
                and expressed the strongest hope of the ultimate fulfilment of all the good which
                the blessed Scriptures have always held out to the returning sinner. With these
                convictions therefore strongly impressed upon the spirit of the followers of our
                religion&#44; they have gone through the field of history overthrowing the systems

                from the revelation of their God. To be sure there is now a period of compara&#8211;

                it has been in bygone ages of darkness &#59; but let us take heed of the prophetic
                warnings contained in Holy Writ. There was greater prosperity in the commencement of
                Isaiah&#39;s mission&#44; and when the prophet of Shiloh pre&#8211; dicted

                period of our captiv&#8211; ity&#59; and still it is now history what with them was
                prediction. We must therefore beware&#44; or else the curses contained in the law
                against the transgressor will reach us&#44; let us separate ourselves from the
                com&#8211; munity of Israel as we may. The Jew is bound by the law&#44; if even he
                publicly renounces his allegiance to his God&#59; no act on his part can expatriate
                him from the congregation of Israel&#44; of which he is a member by the fact that
                his forefathers received the law in the wilderness for themselves and their
                de&#8211; scendants forever&#59; and therefore he may rest assured that the
                vengeance of Heaven will fall upon him both in this world and the world to come&#44;
                if he dies unre&#8211; pentant or be the cause of involving others in sin. The
                periods therefore which the prophets have in&#8211; stituted as days of fasting and
                penitence demand a faithful observance of all sincere Israelites. It is well

                Israelites&#44; and carefully to note the agitation in opinion which now sways many
                minds &#58; he would be apt to come to the hasty conclusion&#44; that Judaism had
                seen its best days&#59; that what is left is merely a shadow of its former self&#59;

                with the many&#44; and despised the union with the handful of Israelites&#44; with
                those who have not earth distinctions to bestow&#44; nor offices to confer. And thus
                have we also seen the strict conformity to our laws gradually decaying&#44; till
                instead&#44; that formerly a transgressor was an object of contempt from his

                vengeance sleeps not&#44; the vigilance of eter&#8211; nal justice is not
                diminished&#44; and before we heed it&#44; the house of the wicked will be struck by
                the four winds of heaven&#44; and bury in its ruins the sinful father&#44; the
                sharer of his iniquity&#44; and the offspring who have not been taught the worship
                of the Lord. This&#44; in truth&#44; must we confidently expect&#44; from the
                well&#8211;known laws of justice which govern the world&#44; that the present
                apostacy from the path of religion will draw after it the same consequences as in
                former days. But in the meantime it is truly deplorable that so much wickedness
                should force itself upon our at&#8211; tention &#59; that with all the
                disposition&#44; so natural to men&#44; to think well of themselves&#44; we cannot
                gainsay the lamentable fact&#44; that we have been retrograding instead of advancing
                in religious improvement&#44; and that thus far the experiment of loosening the
                bonds of our captivity has far from corresponded with the wishes and hopes of those
                who&#44; in a greater state of freedom&#44; hoped&#44; nay&#44; confidently
                expected&#44; that the attachment of Jews to their religion would become closer and
                dearer day by day. Indeed during many years&#44; when for being Israel&#8211; ites
                we had to endure sorrows almost incredible&#44; whicli we could have avoided by
                outwardly conform&#8211; ing to the customs of our ojDpressors &#40;since it was
                os&#8211; tensibly our religion&#44; not ourselves&#44; they wished to

                liberty of worshipping without being molested for the profession of our faith&#44;
                and to be permitted some honourable pursuit&#44; by which we could obtain a decent
                livelihood. Surely during the <pb n="357"/> THE LORD OUR GUIDE. 357 ages of bitter
                persecutioD this was nearly all wbioli was asked&#44; almost the only thing hoped
                for. And the pious ones of those days imagined that&#44; with the enlargement which
                they coveted&#44; the number of de&#8211; voted adherents to the law would greatly
                increase&#44; and that&#44; were the terror of the weight from without removed&#44;
                no one of the seed of Jacob would act other&#8211; wise than as becomes a child of
                salvation under the law&#44; and that as dutiful children all would cheerfully give
                honour and obedience to the Lord of all. And now the prayers of so many saints have
                been heard &#59; their blood has not flowed in vain&#44; their tears of an&#8211;
                guish have been treasured up as a precious sacrifice before the Eternal God &#59;
                and we&#44; their descendants&#44; live in comparative security&#44; and we are
                almost every where free to walk in the paths of the faith revealed through
                Moses&#44; and in many countries we can&#44; as Jews&#44; participate in the
                government&#44; and make our voice heard in the national councils&#44; or contend
                with the mighty in their countries cause on the ensan&#8211; guined field of battle
                or the wide expanse of the ocean&#39;s billows. All this has been given to us. But
                how has experience deceived the hopes of the pious in their dreadful struggle &#33;
                They who&#44; when their life was&#44; so to say&#44; suspended before their

                would give them rather honour than disgrace&#44; as though they had no longer need
                to value that which was so precious to them in their affliction. And daily we

                their faith&#44; and excel in sinful indifference&#44; though often better
                instructed and more piously edu&#8211; cated&#44; than those whom they find there
                before them. &#8212; Formerly&#44; too&#44; we were debarred from cultivating
                secular sciences&#59; naught was left us but the develop&#8211; ment of the wisdom
                of the divine law &#59; and many sighed for opportunities to dip&#44; so to say&#44;
                their oars in the flood of sciences&#44; to understand better through this means the
                mysterious courses of the laws of na&#8211; ture&#44; and their relation to the
                great concerns of life. &#33;Now this too has been granted. But do those who are
                thus taught fight the good battles of their re&#8211; ligion &#63; Are they the

                faith&#44; de&#8211; voted in their attachment to Israelites and their laws&#44; and

                observed all this&#44; who hear the boast of the enemies of the Jews&#44; that soon
                Israel will cease to be a people&#44; if the same gentilizing should proceed with a
                naturally increased ratio&#44; if the internal divisions should continue to multiply
                with the new accession of causes of strife which develop themselves daily &#8212;
                they&#44; who in the events before them&#44; imagine they behold a new state of
                things never before experienced&#44; will naturally imagine&#44; and almost
                confidently expect&#44; that now the gradual extinction of Israel so long
                expected&#44; is actu&#8211; ally impending&#59; and that whatever of this
                anticipa&#8211; tion cannot&#44; from want of time&#44; be accomplished in the next
                ten years&#44; will certainly come to pass as an unavoidable thing. Indeed outward
                circumstances betoken all this as but too likely. But persons must have studied the
                natural inclination of the Jews&#44; and the records of their history&#44; to small
                advantage&#44; to let themselves be so easily led away by outward exhibi&#8211;
                tions. Look&#44; I pray you&#44; in the scriptural records&#44; and you will find
                precisely what we see this day. In prosperity our forefathers forgot the great Lord
                of all&#44; who had freed them from their oppressors&#44; who had rid their
                beautiful country of enemies who had often reaped what others had sown&#44; who had
                gathered the grapes which their owners had carefully tended &#59; and they served
                Baalim and Ashtaroth&#44; whom they had found ifnpotent to aid them in their days of
                dis&#8211; tress. Nay&#44; even at a later period&#44; say in the reign of
                Solomon&#44; when the manifestation of the divine presence in the temple they had
                just erected proved <pb n="360"/> 360 THE LORD OUR GUIDE. to tlie people that the
                Lord dwelt in their midst&#44; how little did they heed their heavenly King&#44; and
                how ungratefal were they in spite of all the peace and prosperity that blessed their
                own Palestine&#44; and the great degree of knowledge which flowed from their
                schools&#44; and the high civilization and refinement which had taken up their abode
                in the mountains of Judah&#44; on the plains of Jezreel&#44; on the coasts of the
                great sea&#44; and the banks of the fertilizing Jordan. Scarcely had the wise
                king&#44; who himself had been misled by his love for strange women&#44; been
                gathered to his fathers&#44; than the fell spirit of disunion broke the common bond
                which had made Israel one people&#44; and Palestine one country. The new king of the
                rival government set up calves for worship at Beth&#8211;el and Dan&#44; and the
                part of the people&#44; separated from the rule of the house of David&#44; was also
                soon torn away from the path of the national religion. We speak of the evils of the
                present day &#59; they are fearful indeed &#59; and no lover of truth&#44; no friend
                of the Mosaic insti&#8211; tutions&#44; can either palliate or defend them&#59; but
                in the extent of forgetfulness of the righteous way the men of antiquity exceeded
                those of our own age. &#33;Now the number of transgressors is large indeed&#44; but
                at worst it is confined to individuals&#59; but then an entire nation&#44; with few
                exceptions&#44; at least but few are recorded&#44; followed the course of
                destruction. Yet there is one thing in which the present renders the evil more
                permanent than in the former period. It is this. During our residence in
                Palestine&#44; no matter if we sinned&#44; we continued to be Israelites&#44; we
                were one people on our national soil&#44; and the worship of <pb n="361"/> THE LORD
                OUR GUIDE. 361 idols left us still surrounded by our brothers&#44;&#42; and we could
                return through repentance&#44; and so could our children&#44; to the safe bosom of
                the divine legislation. &#42; There is no question&#44; but that the Israelites
                during their so&#8211; journ in Palestine never forgot altogether the service of the
                Lord. He was under all circumstances their national God even whilst they
                incorporated the idols of the heathen in their system of wor&#8211; ship. The reader
                is referred to the history of Elijah&#39;s sacrifice on Carmcl&#44; where he clearly
                asks the people how long they would hesitate between the Lord and Baal&#44; which
                evidently proves&#44; that though they ascribed certain propitiatory powers to their
                Baal&#44; they had not cast otr the idea of the God of the Bible as the Supreme
                Kuler of all. &#40;1 Kings xviii. 21.&#41; See also the history of the nations
                brought by Shalmanesser&#44; king of Assyria&#44; to supply the place of the
                Israelites whom he had led away from their land &#40;2 Kings xvii. 24&#8211;34&#41;
                &#59; it is a curious passage&#44; and will give the inquirer a better idea of the
                notions of the heathens respecting their love for idols&#58; it is doubtlessly
                this&#44; &#8212; they thought that they could not ap&#8211; proach the great
                Creator without some mediatorial power&#44; which power they represented under a
                thousand fanciful shapes&#44; all more or less false&#44; all more or less
                disgusting. This peculiar idea&#44; of an intermediate agency&#44; is not unknown to
                the enlightened nations of modern times&#44; and they&#44; like the gentiles of
                old&#44; forget almost in the worship of their mediator&#44; the service which&#44;
                even according to their own views&#44; is in a great degree due to the Supreme.
                Doubt&#8211; less this was the case with the Israelites&#44; and they adored the
                Lord in conjunction with their follies. The sin is not the less heinous&#44; for we
                were commanded&#44; &#34; You shall make nothing with me &#59; &#34; but as the idea
                of the power of the Lord was always held up in their minds&#44; the return to Him
                was at all times easy&#44; whenever they felt&#44; by some calamity which overtook
                them&#44; that they had olFended the Power who alone could save them. Circumcision
                was not omitted&#44; and probably most of the ceremonial laws were held sacred&#59;
                al&#8211; though we have evidence that they were frequently violated &#59; but
                renounced they never were. Heathenism is more tolerant than Christianity and
                3Iahomedanism &#59; it allowed all sorts of conjunc&#8211; tions in its systems and
                practices &#59; whereas they who embrace now the religions of the day&#44; are at
                once and forever severed from Juda&#8211; VOL. VI. 31 <pb n="362"/> 362 THE LORD OUR
                GUIDE. But now this is unfortunately do more the case&#59; they who leave the
                Synagogue&#44; either through apostacy&#44; through the neglect of circumcision&#44;
                or through in&#8211; termarriage with gentiles&#44; hecome part and parcel with the
                non&#8211;Israelites among whom we dwell&#44; and they and their descendants&#44;
                except under rare circum&#8211; stances&#44; become strangers&#44; and must remain
                so&#44; to the worship of the God of Israel &#59; they merge into the nations of the
                earth&#44; and have neither right nor in&#8211; heritance in the congregation of
                Jacob. Here then we have a view of the past and present condition of the sinners in
                Israel&#59; and any reflecting mind can well measure the dark and bright sides of
                the pic&#8211; ture. One thhig no one will be able to deny that&#44; as in the
                national sinning during the first temple&#44; before and since&#44; there was a
                recuperative power by which the people&#44; in a greater or less degree&#44;
                returned to their own God&#44; though they had so often and so long worshipped the
                idols of their neighbours or the false&#8211; hoods of their own invention&#44; so
                there are now&#44; com&#8211; pared to the entire mass of Jews&#44; but a very small
                number who doubt in the fundamental truths of our faith. Nay&#44; of the many who
                have forsaken us&#44; few indeed have done so from conviction&#44; though this makes
                their loss to us not the less certain&#44; nor less deplorable on their and our
                account. Still let it not ism&#59; the Sabbath is changed&#44; circumcision is
                abolished&#44; the syna&#8211; gogue is given up for the church&#44; the Jewish

                became mingled with the oppressors&#59; and from them sprung many who were the
                bitterest enemies to those of their fathers&#39; faith. Whilst&#44; in the same

                rejoices the heart of the husband&#8211; man&#59; comes the joy which sheds a sweet

                own feeble industry success crowns our work &#59; and thus we hasten along in pride

                avidity what thy word has condemned. This has been our course&#44; as it was that of
                our fathers&#44; and we have lived in thy world without feeling that we are
                de&#8211; pendent solely on thy bounty&#44; that thy breath hath made us&#44; that
                thy word can render us again as naught. Be it then thy will&#44; our Father &#33; to
                cause wisdom to enter into our souls&#44; so that we may see Thee in all that
                befalls us&#44; that we may recognize thy over&#8211; ruling providence when
                prosperity smiles in our dwell&#8211; ings&#44; and also that when the voice of
                sorrow is heard in our chambers&#59; in order that we may subject our souls to thy
                service&#44; and endeavour to seek for the wisdom which springs so abundantly from
                thy word&#44; which Thou didst reveal to our fathers. &#8212; And let us beseech
                Thee&#44; Guardian of Israel &#33; to watch over the remnant of thy people that have
                escaped&#44; and protect them acrainst the evil counsels which the aliens of thy
                worship may frame against them. Lo &#33; we are powerless&#59; we are exposed to the

                Scrip&#8211; voL&#44; VI. 32 <pb n="374"/> 374 GOD RULES THE WORLD. tures have
                mankind obtained that pure standard of excellence&#44; which is the boast of modern
                civilization. It is&#44; therefore&#44; fully in accordance with a deeply&#8211;
                seated religious sentiment&#44; to appoint national days of thanksgiving for
                benefits received&#44; as also days of fasting and prayer in times of distress. For
                by this means the God of the Bible is acknowledged in sea&#8211; sons of prosperity
                as the great Benefactor of the state&#44; and as the chief Ruler to whom all eyes
                are directed to give them their food in due season&#44; which his open&#8211; handed
                bounty so mercifully grants unto them. It tells that the people feel that they
                themselves cannot enforce the blessings &#59; that their own hand is power&#8211;
                less&#59; that Divine favour alone brings to perfection that in which they labour.
                And should calamity op&#8211; press the land&#44; and the citizens resort to
                prayer&#44; the ancient practice of the patriarchs&#44; to ask of the Lord to stay
                the plague &#8212; what does it show&#63; but that they feel within themselves that
                they are helpless before the poured&#8211;out wrath of Heaven&#59; that unless He
                averts the shafts from the head of impotent mortals they must sink into the
                grave&#44; or be crushed by the evil which threatens their peace. It is then that
                men feel that there is a Power&#44; the highest and the holiest to direct all their
                steps&#59; that there is a Helper whose throne is from everlasting&#44; in whose
                hand it is to give strength and greatness to all. And well says the prophet
                Jeremiah&#44; x. 6&#44; 7 &#58; <pb n="375"/> GOD RULES THE WORLD. 375 &#34;
                Forasmuch as there is none like thee&#44; O Lord &#33; great art Thou&#44; nnd great
                is thy name in might. Who would not fear Thee&#44; O King of the nations &#63; for
                unto Thee doth it appertain&#44; forasmuch as among all the wise men of the
                nations&#44; and in all their kingdoms there is none like Thee.&#34; In many
                passages of the Scriptures the Being whom we adore is called emphatically &#34;The
                Lord the God of Israel&#59;&#34; this does not&#44; however&#44; say that He is
                aught else than the universal Sovereign. He revealed him&#8211; self as the only God
                to our father Abraham&#44; and this one perpetuated&#44; through his pious
                teaching&#44; the truths he had learned&#44; among his own descendants and those who
                joined themselves to them&#59; and as these men formed a class by themselves&#44; as
                those who adored but one Deity and this the benevolent uni&#8211; versal Father of
                all&#44; He&#44; the Lord Eternal&#44; was natu&#8211; rally called on by them as
                the Lord&#44; their King&#44; the God of Israel &#59; not to exclude others from his
                domin&#8211; ion&#44; but to show that they acknowledged none save Him and desired
                to be called by his name. In truth&#44; then&#44; our God is the universal King of
                the nations&#59; in prosperity and sorrow He is the One who grants blessings or
                vouchsafes relief&#59; and though nations have gone astray after the conceits of
                their imagina&#8211; tions&#44; and have formed gods out of trees of the forest&#44;
                and of gold from Ophir&#44; and of silver dug out of the mines from the bowels of
                the earth &#58; the day will come when all will acknowledge and discover&#44; &#34;
                that the gods which have not made the heavens and the earth shall perish from the
                earth and from beneath these heavens&#59;&#34; when they will cast aside the errors
                they have learned from their fathers&#44; and worship&#44; as we do&#44; the Lord
                Eternal&#44; the King of the nations. <pb n="376"/> 376 GOD RULES THE WORLD. How
                soothing has this reflection always been to the scattered sons of Israel&#44; and
                how pleasant is it for us to reflect on it at this day &#33; Long has the world
                striven against their creed&#44; and against their hopes. But every step that
                civilization takes&#44; the deeper a pure morality strikes root in the hearts of men
                &#58; the more are our practices followed and imitated by those who formerly loved
                not the Israelites and their ways. We are already enjoying in anticipation the
                ultimate triumph of holiness&#44; in that the nations have learned to call upon the
                Almighty&#44; the Bestower of life&#44; for his assistance in the hour of
                distress&#44; and to acknowl&#8211; edge his goodness when they are blessed with
                plenty&#44; health&#44; and peace. If this be done in sincerity&#59; if men assemble
                this day in the many towns of this far&#8211; extended land&#44; and truly feel that
                they are dependents upon the same One God who spoke at Sinai&#59; if they thereby
                deem themselves impelled to be kind to the afilicted&#59; to relieve the poor&#59;
                to clothe the naked&#59; to comfort the mourners &#59; to open the bonds of the
                oppressed&#59; to cultivate good&#8211;will and friendship to each other &#59; to
                guard sacredly the constitutional bar&#8211; riers against the encroachment of
                arbitrary power&#59; to foster peace&#44; not alone within their own borders but
                also with neighbouring nations&#59; in short to act towards all men as they would
                desire these to act to&#8211; wards them &#58; it will be a beautiful vindication of
                the divine image impressed on the human soul&#44; it will be a powerful proof that
                the liberties of these States are well established&#59; inasmuch as the great
                Sovereign&#44; who hates iniquity&#44; is here feared by the millions who inhabit

                here by Provi&#8211; dence to the industry and enjoyment of a hardy race of men&#44;
                a domain which stretches from the Atlantic to the Silent ocean on the West&#44; and
                which embraces climates of almost every degree&#44; and produces nearly all the
                things necessary for the comfort and wants of man. But if the worship of
                thanksgiving be merely performed because it appears well in the eyes of one another
                to profess devotion &#59; if the hearts be turned to iniquity &#59; if oppression
                and injustice are to be de&#8211; fended &#59; if truth is to be neglected &#58;
                then indeed are the inhabitants of the land actually inviting the wrath of offended
                Justice &#59; because they know their Master&#44; and still they rebel against him.
                For how can an offering of the lips be accepted&#44; whilst that is national and
                individual sin&#44; which his word&#44; universally known and universally believed
                in plainly and emphatically condemns&#63; But let us hope that&#44; not alone for
                the happiness of ourselves whose lot is cast here&#44; but for the progress of
                liberty over all the earth&#44; true religious&#8211; ness&#44; as expounded by
                virtue and philanthropy&#44; based upon the fear of the King of the nations&#44; may

                of the laws which render this Republic the home of the free&#44; the refuge of the

                safeguard against national crimes which spring from this polluted source. For what
                does it mean when an entire state comes to return thanks for plenty&#44; for
                peace&#44; for health&#44; for liberty &#63; but to acknowledge that each and all of
                these gifts are not the result of human labour&#44; however we may have contributed
                to the same as instruments of the Supreme Ruler of the world &#59; or else why
                return a pretended gratitude which we do not feel &#63; Else why ascribe glory to
                God for what we feign He has given to us&#44; when we imagine ourselves within our
                own hearts the architects of our fortune &#63; Else&#44; wherefore will we say that
                the Lord has caused our mountain to stand firm&#44; when our souls swell with pride
                and we say within ourselves. Our hands have gotten us all this greatness &#63; And
                if thus we banish national pride&#44; the acts which flow from an assumed
                self&#8211;suf&#8211; ficiency will naturally not find favour in the national
                councils&#44; and not have an abiding&#8211;place in the halls of justice. But
                equity&#44; and charity&#44; and universal love will characterize the people in
                their intercourse with one another and in their dealings with foreign nations&#59;
                and the liberties which now are the equal rights of the humblest of the
                inhabitants&#44; will descend unimpaired as the heirloom of a wise and virtuous
                ancestry to many&#44; yea many generations yet to come. So much as regards us
                Israelites as mere citizens&#44; as equal participators in the government of a
                country where of right we have an undisputed claim to pro&#8211; tection and the
                pursuit of happiness&#59; for in this ca&#8211; pacity we are bound to cherish in
                concert with our countrymen of every other persuasion the duties of a good

                so far as this is practicable through human agency. We are bound as such not to wink
                at wrong done by the persons selected to perform the public functions &#59; but to
                up&#8211; braid them in the constitutional and peaceful manner befitting
                freemen&#44; whenever they become derelict to their trust. Our religion demands
                this&#44; and places us upon the same platform with our fellow&#8211;citizens to act
                thus faithfully in our franchise&#44; a duty equally great as to defend our
                liberties&#44; when assailed by a foreign foe&#44; with arms in our hands&#44; in a
                personal conflict of man to man. Still&#44; in doing this&#44; we have not yet
                discharged the peculiar obligation which our suflering religion demands at our
                hands. Let us be&#8211; ware that we be not misled in our personal safety&#44; that
                it is anything within our own power which has struck the shackles from our
                limbs&#44; which ages of darkness and wo had fastened around them. Let us beware
                that the pride of security do not infuse the poison of infidelity into us&#44; and
                we be thus induced to forget the Lord on the day of our prosperity. Him whom we
                invoked when mankind raged in burning&#8211; wrath against us and our heavenly law.
                Let us be&#8211; ware that we imagine not that the acquisition of lib&#8211; erty
                absolves us of the least obligation&#44; which the letter aud spirit of the law
                demand of the sons of Israel. But it will be well for us to remember&#44; that all
                the good which we have lately received is an ad&#8211; ditional incentive to greater
                holiness&#59; and we should reflect that&#44; if our fathers persevered to call on

                RULES THE WORLD. around them&#44; how much more are we bound by every motive of
                gratitude to exhibit a consistent course of religion now&#44; and here&#44; where we
                are as untram&#8211; melled as the proudest of the sects in the land&#44; where
                there is no right or power inherent in any set of men to hinder us in our religious
                exercises&#44; or to abridge our political immunity and franchise&#44; on account of
                our speculative opinions on religion&#44; or our positive acts in obedience to what
                we deem our duty. It need not be mentioned to you&#44; that Judaism has in this land
                the amplest field for its development &#59; since the commonest understanding will
                perceive this at the first glance of the question. The blessing of Provi&#8211;
                dence&#44; influencing a wise legislation&#44; has removed here from us every
                hindrance which could be imposed upon our religious life. Let it then be our study
                to improve the opportunity thus given&#44; and to exhibit by our conduct that we are
                worthy the liberty which is oars. Some men may perhaps be foolish enough to
                imagine&#44; that to live as Jews will detract from their standing in the
                community&#44; and hence they may trans&#8211; gress&#44; merely to be as like
                non&#8211;Israelites as possible&#44; if outward appearance can do this. But
                independ&#8211; ently of such an excuse being no justification for sin&#44; it is
                the reverse of truth. Sincerity will always de&#8211; mand respect &#59; and
                whatever secret dislike some fa&#8211; natics may have to our religion&#44; none
                will think the less of those who openly profess their God&#44; and scru&#8211;
                pulously obey his laws. In truth&#44; the Israelites are always safest on the path
                of duty&#59; with the world it will give them respectability&#44; if even this could
                weigh the least when higher obligations are concerned &#59; and as regards our
                relation with the mighty King of na&#8211; <pb n="381"/> ZION&#39;S REJOICING. 381

                wish&#44; or the most exalted imagina&#8211; tion desire. Let it therefore be our
                aim to love our Father in all relations of life&#44; in every position in which He
                may place us. If He grants us prosperity&#44; let us thank &#34; the One who is good
                and bestoweth bene&#8211; fits on the undeserving&#59;&#34; and if He sends
                visitation to try our constancy&#44; let us utter our humble prayer&#44; &#34;
                Blessed be the righteous Judge.&#34; If our faith be thus strong&#44; our devotion
                thus pure&#44; we shall move onward in holiness &#59; misfortunes will only purify
                us from guilt&#44; and prosperity will add new lustre to our piety&#44; and render
                us worthy children of salvation&#44; as servants of the great God of heaven and

                the Lord.&#34; Zechar. ii. 14. The idea of the regeneration of the world is one
                peculiarly dear to all who love their species&#44; and they conceive that the
                present state of things is not the final intention of the Creator. They go out and
                cast their look over outward creation &#59; and they there discover a constant
                mutation of all material things&#59; nothing remains stationary&#44; but it either
                progresses to an onward state&#44; or falls back from a point of ex&#8211; cellence
                which it has once attained. Even the solid crust of the earth&#44; with its
                mountains and oceans&#44; is constantly assuming new appearances&#44; and dry land
                takes the place of the water&#44; and this again seizes on fertile fields which it
                converts to its domain &#59; so mountains sink into the plain&#44; or spring up

                by a mighty convulsion of nature. So animals and plants are va&#8211; ried by
                .circumstances&#44; by education&#44; training&#44; and culture&#44; and new kinds
                are constantly presented to our examination&#44; produced by the wonderful joining
                of two species assuming partly the properties of both the prototypes. In addition to
                this we see that cli&#8211; mate and soil have a wonderful eifect in imparting new
                properties to plants and animals&#44; nay the human race itself is sensibly affected
                by outward circum&#8211; stances&#44; both in its mental and physical
                capacities&#44; and with a change of conditions&#44; a stationary state is not to be
                looked for. But every one who thinks must have observed that&#44; in addition to
                changes in individuals&#44; there are witnessed transitions in masses as regards
                feelings and sentiments&#44; and after contem&#8211; plating in history the manners
                and customs of a peo&#8211; ple at one period of its existence&#44; we shall find it
                at a later period obeying others of a different nature and tendency. And why &#63;
                Because a progress&#44; or a retrogression has occurred&#44; and the new
                circum&#8211; stances have produced their corresponding effect. In the same manner
                also every state or association of men&#44; of which the chronicles have handed down
                the story&#44; has changed its position in regard to its own internal
                organization&#44; no less than its influence on other states &#59; and those
                communities that once were great&#44; are now known no more among the families of
                the earth&#44; and others have sprung up from their ruins&#44; or have&#44; so to
                say&#44; emerged from the obscurity of an unknown origin&#44; and have assumed a
                rank and a name amidst those who contend for the dominion of the earth. &#8212;

                system&#44; either of government or relig&#8211; ion&#44; which has been able
                permanently to maintain its footing on earth&#44; or even among that very people
                which was the first to establish it. There is only one thing&#44; or system would be
                a better word&#44; which has stood since its first institution&#44; and with it the
                nation which has been its bearer&#44; and this is the law of Moses borne and
                professed by the people of Israel&#44; of the former of which our worship is the
                emblem&#44; and of the latter of which we are the representatives. Since the birth
                of Abraham&#44; how many have been the modes of worship invented &#33; All sorts of
                emblems have been instituted to render manifest to the eye the peculiar notions
                which an arbitrary assumption or a careful invention had evolved&#59; and monuments
                as firm almost as the primitive mountains were piled up&#44; and temples were reared
                as indestructible almost as time itself&#59; and classes of priests were appointed
                to preserve intact the so&#8211;called wisdom which was placed in their custody&#58;
                and still where are the systems of Egypt&#44; of Chaldea&#44; of Greece&#44; of

                bravery&#44; have already sunk into oblivion&#44; and only amuse the curious
                inquirer into antiquity by their strange and unaccountable de&#8211; viation from
                common sense&#59; and those that remain still in vogue among men&#44; are fast
                lapsing into that neglect from which similar views have not been saved. And with
                this abrogation of systems&#44; the na&#8211; tions that upheld them also
                vanished&#44; and though there are now men in Egypt&#44; and Greece&#44; and

                formerly dwelt in those countries &#59; for these were overpowered by foreign
                invaders&#44; and those who remained have become so mixed up with their enemies that
                their identity cannot be ascer&#8211; tained. It is not for us to go farther into
                the inves&#8211; tigation of this subject at present&#59; since we only wish to
                connect it with our law and our nation&#44; and of these we then boldly maintain
                that they have been exposed to many and mighty vicissitudes and influ&#8211;
                ences&#44; but still they have stood the storm imde&#8211; stroyed&#44; as the
                mighty mountain&#8211;ridge which defies alike the lightning of heaven&#44; or the
                silent encroach&#8211; ments of the wintry frost&#44; though both leave their traces

                the busy hands of man with instruments of destruction force a path over it to the
                valley beyOnd. Just so has it been with our law and with our people. Centuries have
                passed since to a solitary old man&#44; a stranger in a country which was not
                his&#44; there came a voice in the stillness of the night &#58; &#34; Fear not&#44;

                shall be exceedingly great.&#34; And still we hear this same promise in all the
                phases of our being&#44; whether as servants in Egypt&#59; as recipi&#8211; ents of
                the divine revelation in the desert&#59; as the enlightened nation of worshippers of
                a pure God in Palestine &#59; and as exiles pulled and torn by contend&#8211; ing
                factions of gentiles&#44; but all agreeing in maltreat&#8211; ing the sons of the
                wanderer from Chaldea. Yes&#44; be&#8211; fore a child had been born to Abraham&#44;
                a knowledge of an undefiled worship was revealed to him&#44; and he was promised
                that to him and his descendants the Ood of heaven and earth would always be God. And
                has not the event confirmed the truth of revelation&#63; Follow only the history of
                Israel from that epoch&#44; and you will find very few periods of ease and
                sun&#8211; shine &#59; calamity after calamity burst over us with all the terrific
                violence of an expected annihilation &#59; and we were at the same time assailed by
                disunion within our boundaries&#44; and by the sword of the enemy without&#44; aided
                in its destructive wrath by famine and pestilence. Whatever sorrow could be imagined
                and whatever violence man could commit&#44; all came over us as the towering waves
                sweep over the exposed sea&#8211;shore on the day of the fury of the storm&#59; but
                the calamities exhausted themselves in vain &#59; thousands upon thousands of

                calamity which had threatened to overwhelm them&#44; yea as the mountain stands
                reflecting back the light of the setting sun&#44; when the clouds&#44; which in the

                from the atmosphere. &#8212; And when yet farther injury was attempted&#44; when
                entire communities were compelled by the fear of death to abjure their faith&#59;
                when every where man&#8211; kind met us with hostile intent&#44; and endeavoured to
                embitter our days&#44; because we loved our God&#59; when many made our bodies like
                the street over which the wayfarer passes without heeding where he plants his foot
                &#58; we still remained undestroyed &#59; we heeded not the fnry of the
                assailant&#59; we invoked still the name of our Father in heaven&#59; and the
                ene&#8211; my passed away from the earth&#44; and we arose from our fall&#44; and
                stood upright in the presence of our Creator&#44; to sanctify his Memorial and to
                proclaim the truth of his word. All this is no idle boast&#44; not the declamation
                of mere oratory&#44; but the sober language of truth&#44; to which much more might
                be added without exhausting the subject. Now no one who ponders on the picture just
                presented to him&#44; can help asking himself this momentous question &#58; &#34;
                What can be the object to be gained by the preservation of this law and of this

                consequences to be derived there&#8211; from&#44; that should needs draw down upon

                389 iiig amidst all that was called into being merely to fall into decay &#63;&#34;
                Let us endeavour to find the answer by studying the records of our people and the
                pre&#8211; dictions contained therein concernincr them. Re&#8211; specting their
                history it will be readily discovered that they always acted in contradiction to the
                ma&#8211; jority of mankind&#59; insignificant in numbers in their palmiest
                days&#44; they stood always aloof from other men&#44; and were never numbered among
                the nations. It was not then by assimilating with others that their identity was to
                be preserved&#44; it was not by adopting the theories of other people that their
                religion was to be enriched &#59; but the reverse precisely was to be the case &#58;
                they should keep far from foreign associates &#59; and their law was to be the model
                for others to im&#8211; prove thereby their legislation &#59; for it is said&#44;
                &#34;And ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation &#59;&#34; that is
                to say&#44; as the priest officiates not for himself alone&#44; but for those also
                who send him&#44; so should Israel be in the great temple of the Lord&#44; the whole
                earth&#44; an officiating nation to make atonement for all&#44; and to bring all to
                worship before that ever&#8211; lasting Truth&#44; which they themselves adore. Had
                now our people and our faith only met with triumphs in their progress&#44; had
                stronghold after stronghold of error fallen before their steady&#44;
                all&#8211;conquering ap&#8211; proach &#58; it might then have been said that their
                worldly success caused them to prosper&#44; but that they too would fall before the
                blast of adversity&#44; that the ex&#8211; istence of th&#40;5 one and the truth of
                the other were no more established by their prosperity&#44; than were the existence
                of Rome and Egypt and their respective religions and state policies. But from the

                commencement&#44; which is the birth of Isaac Abraham&#39;s child of promise&#44;
                began the ages of our trials. I will not recite to you the proof&#44; for the words
                of Scripture furnish you with them in the amplest manner&#59; and these trials have
                continued to this very hour &#59; in all variety and form of sorrow and prosperity
                have the events of history passed over us &#59; and we are yet undestroyed&#44;
                though perhaps dimin&#8211; ished by the violent abrasions which the destructive
                hand of man has wrought &#59; and judging from anal&#8211; ogy&#44; therefore&#44;
                we are empowered to maintain that&#44; since it is not likely that any greater
                dangers than those encountered hitherto will occur hereafter&#44; we are safe
                against any future contingency&#44; or in other words&#44; that so long as the earth
                stands the people and religion of Israel will have their abiding&#8211;place in the
                daily history of mankind. Having arrived at this point&#44; we may maintain farther
                that&#44; as our religion is not our own invention&#44; it having been imparted to
                us directly by God&#44; consequently its and our preserva&#8211; tion are the
                especial efiects of Providence&#44; by which he has proved that all men are safe of
                obtaining his favour&#44; if they belong to Israel and obey the laws which &#8211;He
                himself wrote for their instruction. But it having already been said&#44; that we
                were appointed a kingdom of priests&#44; that is to say&#44; ordained servants of
                the Most High for the good of others&#58; it farther follows&#44; that upon working
                and suffering are destined to have a saving influence upon the other portions of the
                human family in order to them ultimately to the acknowledgment of the truth which is

                belief is suflered to exist&#44; and why error of every sort is permitted to have
                its rule on earth&#59; for we cannot fathom the counsels of the exalted Creator&#44;
                nor measure his ways by our appreciation of things. Enough for us that a road has
                been pointed out&#44; on which we are to travel onward&#59; enoufirh that we have
                abundant evidence of being possessed of the truth ourselves&#59; and let us leave it
                to Him to effect his un&#8211; known purposes in the manner it may seem best to
                Him&#44; and the best conducive to our ultimate happi&#8211; ness&#59; and glad
                should we be&#44; that we are certified that ours is a holy mission&#44; that
                each&#44; nay the hum&#8211; blest Israelite&#44; for no distinction is made in the
                an&#8211; nouncement&#44; is a priest&#44; bringing by his pious acts sacrifices of
                redeemed souls on the altar of his God&#59; and we should be proud of the
                consciousness&#44; that every act performed in faith will contribute to the hopeful
                resurrection &#8211;to a holy life of all the descend&#8211; ants of Adam. &#34;With
                these remarks premised&#44; let us return to the words of our text. I have called
                your attention to the fact&#44; that the return from Babylon which Zechariah and his
                contemporaries witnessed was but a partial fulfilment of the good promised to our
                nation&#44; in fact the prophet himself predicted &#40;xi. 1&#41; the destruction of
                the temple which was built in his days &#59; and yet he connected with his message
                not alone the per&#8211; manence of his people&#44; but the spread of the divine
                kingdom all over the earth. He&#44; therefore&#44; says &#58; &#34;Sing and
                rejoice&#44; O daughter of Zion&#33; for I am coming&#44; and I will dwell in the
                midst of thee&#44; saith the Lord. And many nations shall joiii themselves <pb

                shall be unto me for a people&#44; and I will dwell m the midst of thee&#44; and
                thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me to thee. And the Lord will
                asrain take Judah as his portion on the holy ground&#44; and He will again make
                choice of Jerusalem.&#34; Here we have at once an answer to our question&#44; Why
                the preservation of Israel was deemed so necessary to the Lord&#44; that He caused
                them to remain undestroyed amidst all the mutations to which they were subject. The
                Daughter of Zion was first told to rejoice&#59; under this term is typically

                David&#44; or Zion&#59; under the name then of a female of this beloved place the
                entire nation is comprised as the daughter of Zion&#59; she is bidden to sing and be
                glad&#59; why is this&#63; because victories over enemies are promised&#63; is it
                because wealth and pleasure are to bring her de&#8211; light &#63; nothing of
                this&#44; only because God the Lord is announced as coming&#44; and about to dwell
                in the midst of the redeemed nation. When we examine the books of Scripture we shall
                find that nothing else is meant by this expression&#44; than that the people should
                be faithful to their religious trust&#44; and that thereby the evidence of the
                divine favour shall be visibly dis&#8211; played in the land&#59; for sin would
                procure the execu&#8211; tion of all the punishments which the violation of the law
                demands. The prophecy then is that&#44; at the time of the accomplishment of the
                good predicted&#44; there shall be a strict conformity to the divine religion
                cheerfully given by all the people of Abraham&#44; who are bound to execute its
                precepts as the heirs of this ancient name and lineage&#59; and that in consequence
                    <pb n="393"/> ZION&#39;S REJOICING. 393 of this pious course the divine blessing
                will rest every where&#44; and the more immediate emanations of his glory will be
                visibly displayed&#44; as they were during the sojourn of the Israelites in the
                wilderness and the consecration of the temple by Solomon. But not alone the Hebrews
                are to be benefitted by this bless&#8211; ing&#59; for other nations too are to come
                and join them&#8211; selves unto the Lord&#59; observe well the prediction&#44;
                &#34;Many nations shall join themselves unto the Lord on that day.&#34; How
                futile&#44; then&#44; are the attempts of kings&#44; of associations and entire
                communities&#44; to de&#8211; stroy the worship of the Lord&#44; to add to Him
                beings that do not exist&#59; to ascribe sacred missions to pro&#8211; phets whom He
                has not sent. iJTot in this manner could Zechariah imagine&#44; that nations shall
                join them&#8211; selves unto the Lord&#59; for he spoke to Israelites&#44; and as
                one Hebrew could alone address his brothers&#44; in the belief in and the strict
                practice of all which the prophet Moses had received from on High. In this manner
                then must the foreign nation also join this worship&#44; as believers and servants
                under the same religion&#59; and thus they will be chosen among the elect&#44; for
                they will be likewise taken unto God as a people. Consequently we have here the
                positive as&#8211; surance&#44; that not alone shall Israel remain unde&#8211;
                stroyed during all trials and changes&#44; but they shall at length be what they
                were originally destined for&#44; &#34;a kingdom of priests&#44;&#34; and others
                besides them shall be brought to worship Him alone&#44; who is Eternal&#44; who is
                God&#44; who&#44; IS Creator &#59; and only when they have for&#8211; saken their
                errors will they also be called his people&#44; that is to say&#44; men devoted to
                his service only&#44; who eschew every error&#44; and will regulate their life by
                the <pb n="394"/> 394 ZION&#39;S REJOICING. law which He has written. Still shall
                this calling of the gentiles not work the destruction of the ancient chosen
                race&#59; there shall yet be a distinction between those who always were the
                Lord&#39;s and other men &#59; for to them the especial favour of their God will be
                especially given&#44; and they are yet to be bound hy particular laws&#44; not as a
                burden upon their conscience&#44; but as a means by which they may be known among
                the other servants of God who are then to fill the earth. And then adds the
                prophet&#44; &#34; And thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto
                Thee&#44;&#34; that is to say&#44; when a prophecy is first uttered&#44; there can
                be evidently no distinction&#44; as to its. ultimate ful&#8211; filment&#44; between
                it and the random assertion of any common man&#59; it may or may not be
                accomplished. But when the event&#44; after thousands of years&#44; con&#8211; firms
                the truth of those who long since sleep in the dust&#59; if that becomes history
                which was before a mere improbable revery &#58; then unbelief itself is forced to
                admit that a Spirit superior to man had inspired the knowledge wliich during their
                life flowed from the lips of the honoured dead. In the same spirit then says the
                prophet in this connexion &#58; At the present moment a mere handful of men are
                laying the foundations of a house unto the Lord&#59; these newly returned&#8211;
                exiles&#44; a small remnant of a once great people&#44; live here solely by the
                sufferance of their masters&#44; of men who fear not the Lord and seek not the
                alliance of his servants. But I see a glorious change impending&#59; a glorious end
                to the mission of the daughter of Zion &#58; her banner shall be planted on firm and
                holy ground&#44; and nations&#44; now strangers to her hopes and belief&#44; shall
                come&#44; not urged by the <pb n="395"/> ZION&#39;S REJOICING. 395 force of the
                sword&#44; not lured by wealth&#44; but of their own free accord&#44; and join
                themselves unto the Lord&#44; strange as the fulfilment may now appear&#59; but when
                it shall have come to pass&#44; then will all know that it was the Creator
                himself&#44; who sees through all futurity&#44; who had thus revealed things which
                are to occur to his servants &#59; and that it was the truth in which the people of
                Israel believed&#44; in that they placed confi&#8211; dence in their seers&#44; and
                remained true to their na&#8211; tional God. And consequently&#44; instead of
                verifying the assertion of our opponents&#44; that the Jews have been cast oiF from
                favour on account of their unbe&#8211; lief&#44; the Lord will again openly take
                them as his portion&#44; just as He did at the time He redeemed them from Egypt&#44;
                when it was said&#58; &#34;For the Lord&#39;s por&#8211; tion is his people&#44;
                Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.&#34; The city also where formerly sacrifices
                were accept&#8211; able&#44; the holy Jerusalem&#44; will again be made choice of as
                the centre of the then universal worship of the universal Sovereign&#44; whilst on
                the holy ground of Pal&#8211; estine the now acknowledged favourites of Heaven&#44;
                favourites only because they have fulfilled their mis&#8211; sion&#44; will live in
                undisturbed security&#44; overshadowed by that protection which the Lord alone can
                give. To give farther emphasis to his words&#44; the prophet exclaims&#58; &#34;Be
                silent&#44; all flesh&#44; before the Lord&#59; for He is awakened from his holy
                dwelling&#59;&#34; meaning&#44; as the hero arouses himself to deeds of bravery
                after a refreshing sleep&#44; so in a measure will the Lord&#44; after seemingly
                abandoning Israel to misfortune&#44; display&#44; in order to relieve them from the
                evils which have befallen them&#44; his power&#44; his might and truth against which
                all the efforts of man are vain&#63; for it is resolved&#44; <pb n="396"/> 396

                away from the earth&#44; and that through those&#44; who are called the servants and
                priests of the Lord&#44; tidings of salvation shall be proclaimed to the ends of the
                earth&#44; at that time for which all saints hope in humble confidence&#44; when the
                Most High will prove by his mercy who are his&#44; when He will bring near Him those
                who are holy&#44; when He will be called One by all flesh&#44; as He is in truth the
