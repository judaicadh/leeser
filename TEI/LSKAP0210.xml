            <p rend="align(center)">Reform in <placeName>Charleston</placeName></p>
            <p>It was a common saying of our much loved,<lb/> much honored statesman, <persName>John
                    C Calhoun</persName>,<lb/> that when our forefathers gave to the people of<lb/>
                this country its present constitution, they<lb/> gave an instrument, of which they
                even, its<lb/> projectors, its authors, did not comprehend the<lb/> whole intrinsic
                value. In the like manner it may<lb/> be said of the propagators of reform in
                    <placeName>Charleston</placeName>,<lb/> that, in the spread of their doctrine
                they have<lb/> developed some truths, have given some points<lb/> of information to
                the Jewish community of which<lb/> they have hitherto been ignorant. Though
                opposed<lb/> to them in principle, though differing widely<lb/> as to certain
                dogmas, yet do we feel it our bounden<lb/> duty to give honor to whom honor is due;
                we<lb/> feel it therefore, incumbent upon us to lend our<lb/> feeble voices in
                proclaiming aloud to the world,<lb/> that to them are we indebted for a true<lb/>
                exposition, as evinced in their <date>sabbath</date> service, of<lb/> the meaning of
                the fourth commandment.<lb/> On entering the synagogue Hal Hadosh Beth<lb/> Elohim
                during the hour of service, on a <date>sabbath</date><lb/> morn we see the true
                letter of the text fully<lb/> exemplified, by the extreme state of apathy in
                which<lb/> the congregation is plunged. No man forgets<lb/> himself for an instant,
                to shout praises, to raise</p>
            <pb n="1V"/>
            <p>his voice in thanksgiving to the most high, but<lb/> each and every one conducts
                himself on the prin-<lb/>ciple enjoined by the text and plunges himself<lb/> in a
                silence most profound, unbroken save by<lb/> the monotonous reading of not the
                    <add>most</add> musical<lb/> hazan in the world and the chaunting, if
                chant<lb/>ing it may be called of a choir of which the<lb/> least said the better.
                All praise then to the<lb/> founder &amp; propagator of Charlestonian reform,
                all<lb/> praise to the man who has taught his enlightened<lb/> flock to keep
                inviolate the lord's sanctified day all praise<lb/> to him who planned the minhag of
                the congrega<lb/>tion K K B E and to him who has taught how<lb/> most man can be
                bored by hearing badly pronounced<lb/> english in support of lame argument. For one
                other<lb/> great teaching are we grateful. We have a demonstration<lb/> how all
                    <sic>all</sic> improvements in our mode of worship,<lb/> how all additions of
                English and curtailings of<lb/> Hebrew serve but for one purpose, to render<lb/>
                congregators more somniferous and to cause<lb/> Somnies to reign where
                    <persName>Jehovah</persName> should.</p>
            <p>But the ladies, the indefatigable female members of<lb/> this remarkable
                congregation, seem to interpret the<lb/> divine law in quite an opposite manner from
                the<lb/> males, they having determined to alter the day of<lb/> instruction of the
                children of the Sunday school<lb/> from <del><date>Saturday</date> to
                        <date>Sunday</date></del>
                <date>Sunday</date> to <date>Saturday</date>.<lb/> For this contempt of public
                opinion the ladies</p>
            <pb n="2R"/>
            <p>most certainly deserve to be considered somewhat<lb/> strong minded and we do not
                doubt but that<lb/> every unbiased mind will agree with us to them<lb/> the full
                need of praise for such effrontery and<lb/> resolution. The institution is under the
                direction of<lb/> three or four of <placeName>Israel's</placeName>
                <hi rend="underline">lovely</hi> daughters, and if their<lb/> pupils, on arriving at
                maturity, but possess a slight<lb/> portion of the <hi rend="underline">corporal
                </hi>&amp; mental graces which adorn<lb/> their mentors they will most certainly
                reach<lb/> stations which will reflect honor on themselves &amp;<lb/> instructors.
                Well! all we can wish is that the revederend<add>?</add><lb/> gentleman and
