			<p>Dear and Respected Friend</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">When your last favor came<lb/> to hand I had almost been numbered with<lb/> <sic>with</sic> the dead&#44; but it was Divine will to<lb/> spare me a little longer on earth where<lb/> I suppose my mission had not yet been ful<lb/>filled&#59; and truly grateful am I for this<lb/> consideration &#40;if I may so term it&#41; as it enables<lb/> me to feel more sensibly my mortality<lb/> which till then&#44; almost with shame I confess<lb/> it&#44; thought with a full sense of the power<lb/> and greatness of an Adored Creator&#44; I had not<lb/> felt&#44; the chill hand of sickness&#44; never lost<lb/> a nights rest by my own corporeal com&#45;<lb/>plaining and therefore the blessing of a<lb/> good constitution and undisturbed health<lb/> caused a fearlessness&#44; of which I felt too se&#45;<lb/>cure&#59; so my friend <add>&#63;</add> in this little evil<lb/> I feel the good&#44; I am now thank Heaven<lb/> quite restored&#44; <del>an</del> from an attack of yellow<lb/> fever&#44; of which I had lost all fear&#59; a<lb/> few years in this climate tend so to lessen the<lb/> the vigor both of mind and body that<lb/> I long to embrace dame winter again.</p>
			<p>The loss of a fond endearing Mother whose very<lb/> existence was a pride to my heart&#44; whose tender<lb/> care almost reduced me to a state of childhood</p>
		<pb n="2"/>
			<p>again&#44; in her care I was for five years safe<lb/> from care&#44; and climate&#44; at her demise my<lb/> heart so faint and weary of life without her<lb/> yielding to weather and changes&#44; I became<lb/> for a season quite an object of anxiety<lb/> to my friends&#44; but again and again I thank<lb/> Heaven that am quite restored to former<lb/> activity and begin to mingle with kind friends<lb/> to dispel the gloom I feared too ungracious<lb/> in the sight of Heaven&#44; to whose will I honor<lb/> with humble submission praying that in this<lb/> great affliction I have atoned for many trans&#45;<lb/>gressions.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I have <sic>receivd</sic> your last few numbers<lb/> of Occident regularly&#44; but my volumes are<lb/> quite incomplete requiring several numbers<lb/> which if I cannot obtain from <persName>Mr Lawston</persName>&#44;<lb/> I shall <del>be much obliged to you</del> make known<lb/> to you &#40;God willing&#41; in my next. I have had<lb/> several applications for my work and<lb/> am entirely out of <del>them</del> a single copy.<lb/> on order from <placeName>England</placeName> and by a most<lb/> favorable opportunity had to pass without<lb/> the supply you will therefore greatly oblige<lb/> me by sending immediately 4 dozens and<lb/> let me know how many copies are on<lb/> hand as I think I shall be compelled to<lb/> furnish a <add>&#63;</add> 3d edition and much desire to<lb/> get off the 2d entirely.

I nevertheless <del>for</del> yet re&#45;<lb/>tain all the warmth&#44; and attachment&#44; I<lb/> ever did neither time nor climate can<lb/> ever chill the ardent affection for my<lb/> beloved friends&#44; to all of whom as you my<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> will tell the same as from me<lb/> To my friend <persName>Mr Abm Hart</persName> I shall write at<lb/> the closing of this. My loving friend&#44; <persName>Miss Gratz</persName><lb/> I find is yet exercising all her usual bene&#45;<lb/>volence&#44; and still active in promoting and<lb/> circulating that invaluable treasure&#59; Education<lb/> I yet hope for the day when I shall greet<lb/> you all again for as I said in a former letter<lb/> to you&#44; though&#44; my Brother his wife&#44; and<lb/> family endeavor to make me as comfort&#45;<lb/>able as possible&#44; being in case and indeed <add>&#63;</add> as<lb/> yet&#44; what is life without <add>&#63;</add>fulness&#59; this<lb/> is not the country for the single <add>&#63;</add><lb/> happy and good for Mothers <add>&#63;</add> families<lb/> who have a high duty to perform in the<lb/> domestic tracing of their homestead &#38;c &#38;c but<lb/> for a mind like mine ever active in public good</p>
