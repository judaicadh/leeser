                                        only two days ago the parcel directed to the Consul<lb/> at
                                                  <placeName>Grenada</placeName>. I am sorry to say
                                        I have had a deal<lb/> of trouble ere the latter could be
                                        obtained, and then had<lb/> to pay $50 freight on it–for
                                        your guidance and future<lb/> government, I must inform you
                                        that the Captain of<lb/> the "Kingston" Committed a breach
                                        of trust by opening<lb/> the parcel to ascertain the

                                        consequence he<lb/> would have done the same, therefore I
                                        consider it a duty<lb/> you owe to yourself to represent his
                                        conduct to his<lb/> employer, and as you are I understand
                                        intimate with<lb/> the Several Editors of the Press, that
                                        you request them<lb/> to give publicity to the same, so that
                                        the public may<lb/> be guarded against such a man, for he
                                        would not<lb/> hesitate in my opinion to gratify his
                                        curiosity to open<lb/> any letter that may be entrusted to
                                        his care, my Father<lb/> told him, that his conduct should
                                        be represented,<lb/> when he made for answer "if that was
                                        the case<lb/> he would never take charge of any more letter
