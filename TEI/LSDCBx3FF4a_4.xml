            <p rend="align(right)"><date>Monday, 2 of Kislev(November) 1865</date>.</p>
            <p>Greetings to my friend, my dear, the wise, the accomplished, who seeks<lb/> the
                welfare of his people, <persName>Eliezar Lippman Leeser</persName>, Dear friend:</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Only yesterday, the house was filled with light to see your<lb/>
                bright and shining words. <persName>Mr. von Beil</persName><add>?</add> was to see
                me only yesterday,<lb/> and is now pressing for a decision, but this is very hard to
                make. This<lb/> matter is terribly involved. There are 50 kinds of things against
                it<lb/> and a like number in favor. He can and may not invalidate himself from<lb/>
                being a <persName>Cohen</persName>. First of all, we must seek — I say seek — I want
                to use the<lb/> definite term, for I am among those who are fearful for the teaching
                of<lb/> tradition — not to express anything that will make her valid as a
                Jewess.<lb/> This is what you have failed to do, to make the mother a Jewess. If
                she<lb/> is a Jewess, then the thing could be done, for then the Biblical law
                no<lb/> longer applies- that the children are of a Jewish father and they can
                be<lb/> full Jews. It will be difficult. Let her go to the ritual bath only<lb/>
                because of a doubt of Jewishness. Above all comes the question, whether<lb/> it is
                possible that the mother, who lacks only the ritual bath, does this<lb/> only
                because, as <persName>von Beil</persName> says, she is a cripple. Perhaps it could
                be<lb/> done by force. <sic>write</sic> to me about it. This would be the first
                step, then<lb/> we shall see what is to be done further. I am still not clear about
                it,<lb/> and should like to have the whole matter thoroughly explained, in
                order,<lb/> if possible, to turn it into a <hi rend="underline">fait accompli</hi>.
                For the moment, I am too<lb/> much worried with the pains of editorship.
                    <persName>Isaacs</persName> is silent <del>after</del> ever since I had<lb/>
                myself <del>set him aside</del> refuted him, well but quietly. He and his are mean
                fellows.<lb/> The free school here is humbug, Its matzo-baking president is the
                lowest<lb/> of the low — of the vice-president. One of the chief teachers, also
                a<lb/> — did some unclean things with children in other schools. Should one<lb/>
                keep quiet about such things? That is why I have written that one who<lb/> uncovers
                only one portion merely covers up double the amount. I don't<lb/> want to speak
                about other things.. Keep for me the reports of the assembly</p>

            <p rend="align(center)">2</p>
            <p>of delegates, also advertisements.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">With the help of God I shall begin this week to print, with<lb/>
                your permission, your translation of my introduction to <hi rend="underline"
                        ><persName>Esther</persName></hi> —— .<lb/> You may also remove certain
                things from the ——as, for example, that<lb/> congregations ought to make clear to
                themselves their own principles,<lb/> and that religious leaders should give an
                honest and thorough report of<lb/> their trust.</p>
