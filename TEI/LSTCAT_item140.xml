				<p><addressee>Mr Isaac Leeser</addressee>&#33;</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">Rev. Sir&#33;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The moment your Occident came to hand&#44; I<lb/> <sic>intentend</sic> to write an epistle as an answer against<lb/> the unjust charges and your <sic>comentary</sic> towards <persName>Dr Wise</persName><lb/> but several causes and my limited knowledge of the<lb/> <sic>english</sic> and <sic>hebrew</sic>&#44; prevented me to do so&#44; as my respect<lb/> towards you and <persName>Wise</persName> are so great&#44; that I feel myself<lb/> for the present unable to do justice to both&#44; and the<lb/> subject itself.  But the earnest zeal with which<lb/> I am interested in the cause of Judaism&#44; and the love<lb/> of truth make it notwithstanding my duty&#44; to give<lb/> you an impartial statement of things as they are<lb/> and for the rest I leave it entirely to your<lb/> <sic>judgement</sic> to make use of it or not&#59; it will<lb/> <del>take</del> make you little trouble in comparison of<lb/> abilities&#33;  The Occident is for this moment not at<lb/> my hands and therefore can I only allude to it<lb/> by recollection  Your heading <persName>Dr W.</persName> and his congregation<lb/> it was the whole matter differently from what it is&#59; when<lb/> you will read what follows.</p>
				<p><persName>Mr Spanier</persName> lives as I <sic>unterstand</sic> some 6 or 8 years<lb/> in this place&#44; but never <sic>mettled</sic> with <sic>jews</sic> or Judaism&#44;<lb/> and we know that he is not even so very <sic>scrupelous</sic> in<lb/> the keeping of the ten commandments.  The congregation<lb/> here is like all the <sic>american</sic> composed of Jews of so<lb/> many different tribes as there are states in unhappy<lb/> <placeName>Germany</placeName>&#44; and consequently &#40;coming to this yet the ignorance<lb/> of so many.&#41; the body very <sic>heteregen</sic>&#33;</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>Through&#39; the indefatigable exertions of <persName>Dr Wise</persName>&#44; they<lb/> have been kept together and all the friends of order of<lb/> and com<add>m</add>on sense untied and are the true friends and<lb/> followers <persName>Wises</persName>.  But as the immortal <persName>Goethe</persName> once<lb/> said&#44; The Elephant must also have his house<add>&#63;</add>&#44; there<lb/> still remained some outcasts of society who when home<lb/> and idle make it their principle business&#44; to raise<lb/> excitements&#44; <sic>disturbe</sic> meetings &#38;c &#38;c.&#8212;The friends of order<lb/> therefore thought it best to elect a Parnass who not<lb/> <sic>beeing</sic> in daily connections with those and having a<lb/> respectable appearance will fit best to make the<lb/> criers silent.  They thought themselves the better <del>united</del><lb/> suited as their candidate did at any time not feign<lb/> the heartiest friendship to <persName>Dr Wise</persName>&#59; and thought it possible<lb/> to retain <persName>Mr Wise</persName> who was elected in <placeName>Charleston</placeName> as<lb/> their minister.  <persName>Wise</persName> was by most of the members<lb/> petitioned to remain and with this hope they went<lb/> to the meeting&#44; and moved to send a <sic>comitee</sic> to<lb/> invite him to remain and to increase his salary.<lb/>  This was the first officiating of <persName>Spanier</persName>&#44; and whilst<lb/> declaring that it be the duty of every man to secure<lb/> the services of <persName>Wise</persName>&#44; he opposed the increase of<lb/> the salary&#44; because the financial condition of a cong.<lb/> of 150 members would not allow to expend &#36;200 more<lb/> 2 years.  This was the first jesuitical<add>&#63;</add> act.  In a<lb/> moment this sum. was raised by private subscription&#44;<lb/> and the president didn&#39;t allow to put it in the<lb/> minutes.  When the <sic>comite</sic>&#39; was selected&#44; the honorable<lb/> Pres. Sent 2 of the most vulgar enemies of <persName>Wise</persName><lb/> <persName>Wise</persName> who we certainly know acted with pure love<lb/> told me that he knows well that he wrongs his<lb/> family&#44; by reaccepting his office&#44; what is &#38; but<lb/> poorly paid&#44; on comparison to what was offered to<lb/> him <placeName>Charleston&#44; <sic>Ca</sic></placeName> &#38; by considering that what I<lb/> have with pains and sorrow&#44; <add>&#63;</add> up in 3 years&#44;</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>will fall to pieces&#44; the children whom I educated<lb/> will cease to be what they are now they seeds of true<lb/> Judaism which I have <sic>platted</sic> in their hearts&#44; will<lb/> be in vain makes it my duty to remain.</p>
				<p>You will therefore see the first plan of the order of<lb/> <persName>Loyola</persName> was destroyed but as <sic>as</sic> the forge of them is constantly<lb/> heated and no medium to Case for a Jesuit &#40;and we know<lb/> them very well and must by all the acts from beginning<lb/> to end&#44; of <persName>Mr Spanier</persName> come to conclusion that he is<lb/> an agent of this Teroor<add>&#63;</add> society&#41; the new plan was soon<lb/> fabricated.  Convinced as the Parnass was&#44; that all the<lb/> decent members are for all and all for one&#44; are friends<lb/> of order and of <persName>Dr Wise</persName>&#44; he now appears as father of<lb/> the poors&#44; namely there were about 30 to 40 who were<lb/> partly not able&#44; partly unwilling to contribute their yearly<lb/> contributions and were therefore by law not allowed<lb/> to vote.  <persName>Mr Spanier</persName> <sic>adressed</sic> the meeting in a heart<lb/>rending language in behalf of them and they were released<lb/> from their debts and allowed to partake in all the<lb/> privileges with the other members.  Before the moon<lb/> had made its monthly circulation some of this made<lb/> Spaniards in con<add>n</add>ection with 4 <del>baar</del> grogshop keepers<lb/> who are naturally opposed to <persName>Wise&#39;s</persName> doctrines&#44; who denounces<lb/> drinking and gambling in the boldest manner&#44; came<lb/> out with a complaint if you my friend would only<lb/> read these documents&#44; you would be obliged not only<lb/> to laugh at the folly&#44; but to <sic>comdemn</sic> our Parnass for<lb/> ever.  The principal complaints are stiled&#44; <hi rend="underline">it is said</hi><lb/> that <persName>Mr. W.</persName> has done this and that <del>and the</del> and<lb/> when the signers were asked about the <sic>containings</sic> of<lb/> their documents&#44; they confessed that they <sic>dont</sic> know it&#59;<lb/> they were presented to them&#44; by the honorable Parnass<lb/> and Chasan and forced to sign&#33;</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>The only foothold the Parnass could make was <del>the</del> upon a trustee<lb/> who in opposition to <persName>Mr Wise</persName> opened his store on <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> and was <sic>repremanded</sic> by him.  <add>&#63;</add> <persName>Mr Spanier</persName><lb/> thought to justified&#44; and when <persName>Mr Wise</persName> stood on his<lb/> pulpit to deliver a sermon the Jesuit walked up&#44; and<lb/> wanted to stop him.  Our friend with all the presence<lb/> of mind and godly inspiration overpowered the assai<lb/>lant in com<add>m</add>encing and continuing a beautiful lecture&#44;<lb/> and <del>fea</del> the Pres. fearing the vengeance of the<lb/> offended hearers in the <sic>singagogue</sic> left it&#44; followed by 5<lb/> or 6 of his worthy companions.</p>
				<p>Where&#44; is there a man or a Jew in the civilized world&#44;<lb/> who would only copy a line of such a villain&#63; when<lb/> instructed of his misdeeds&#63;&#33;</p>
				<p>The Parnass was paid and had 3 witnesses&#44; who God alone<lb/> knows their hearts&#33; swore to lies&#33; amongst them was<lb/> our misguided Chasan&#33;  Amongst others to lead the<lb/> judge&#44; in <add>&#63;</add> the wrong way a Parnass <add>&#63;</add> <persName>Mr. Y.</persName> was<lb/> cited as a <sic>wittness</sic>&#44; and when asked&#44; is it customary<lb/> with the Jews to abuse their ministers <del>ther</del> in such<lb/> a manner&#44; he answered&#44; Yes Sir&#33; we do not care<lb/> about our ministers&#44; we just as live abuse them as<lb/> not.  What do you dear Sir say to this fruit of<lb/> jesuitical bribery such a blame upon Judaism in a<lb/> crowded court room&#63;  The assailant evicts all the<lb/> burdens of false witnesses&#44; was fined and reprimanded&#33;<lb/>  But do you think man&#39;s baseness was stopped here&#63;<lb/>  No Sir&#33;  The trustees were again called together to <sic>expell</sic><lb/> the honorable <persName>Dr Wise</persName> in consequence of the above<lb/> named groundless and perfidious charges&#44; but the<lb/> wisdom and blas&#233; plans of the Jesuit&#44; wrecked</p>
