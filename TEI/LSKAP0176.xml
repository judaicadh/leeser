            <p>Dear Uncle</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I received your note the day before the <sic>holydays</sic>, and
                would have<lb/> answered it immediately, but that I had nothing to write, and I
                would rather wait<lb/> till something was settled with regard to myself; but again
                today there was no<lb/> meeting of the congregation and consequently nothing is
                known or determined<lb/> with respect to my future stay here. There is no
                probability that there will be<lb/> any meeting before the next <sic>holydays</sic>,
                and of course I must be kept in doubt till<lb/> then. I hardly know what to make of
                the people, they ought to know that it must be<lb/> very unpleasant to be kept in
                suspense, still they seem to care little or nothing<lb/> about the whole matter, and
                of course I must and do feel very unpleasantly,<lb/> especially as daily some little
                things occur to make things very uncomfortable.<lb/> Especially this day week I
                thought it my duty to speak to the people about the<lb/> many wrong things I see
                every day; and you never saw or hear such an outcry as<lb/> there was made about it;
                every one had something to say and some of the ladies<lb/> warmly approved, but many
                of the men condemned me, and could have eaten me up. I<lb/> am really tired of
                having to defend myself constantly from one charged or the<lb/> other which is
                always made and really it appears that my congregation are never<lb/> tired of
                worrying me—when you come here which I hope will be very soon, I shall<lb/> show you
                my sermon, and tell you perhaps some other things as I wish to hear your<lb/> advise
                too in my future movements; for I do not like to take my step without<lb/> hearing
                your opinion first.—Subscription to my book does not seem to be thought of<lb/> at
                least I hear nothing about it. Perhaps after a while it may do, but people<lb/> feel
                very indifferent about me and my doing.</p>
