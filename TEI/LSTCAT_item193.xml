            <p>My dear <addressee>Mr. Leeser</addressee>.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Your two welcome letters I have not had any time<lb/> to answer
                until today, and even now I have so much to do with Synagogue<lb/> and school (very
                small at present,) that I will not be able to afford you all<lb/> the information
                you may want respecting my course since I have been <sic>hear</sic>.<lb/> But first
                let me ask why you address me, one of your oldest friends and<lb/> correspondents by
                the title of Dr. Sir? Is it a proof of your altered feelings towards<lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">me</hi>, or an idea that mine could possibly change, or <hi
                    rend="underline">have</hi> changed towards <hi rend="underline">you</hi>?
                “Reform<lb/> is altogether.” I must also premise that your note of <date>Oct. 2<hi
                        rend="sup">nd</hi>.</date> found me on a sick<lb/> bed, and which
                incapacitated me from public duty for nearly 3 weeks. It was<lb/> a severe attack of
                influenza, arising from the sudden change of very hot weather to<lb/> heavy rains
                and strong north winds.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I left <placeName>Kingston</placeName> on the <date>9<hi rend="sup"
                        >th</hi>. Septr.</date>, and arrived here <add>בשלום</add> on
                    <add>ער"ה</add> about 7 in the<lb/> morning too late for <add>סליחות</add>. A
                large concourse of my members met me at the wharf,<lb/> and accompanied me to the
                lodgings they had provided and furnished, until I could purchase<lb/> my own things.
                After drinking a glass of wine, we went to Synagogue, for me to say
                <add>גומל</add>.<lb/> On returning home, a letter from some of my lady friends was
                handed me, together with<lb/> a handsome suit of canonicals, of which they requested
                my acceptance. In the evening,<lb/> the congregation being assembled for
                    <add>ערבית</add>, I was led in by the Presidt. &amp; Vice, seated in<lb/> the
                President's chair, while the congregation sang <add>ברוך הבא</add>. After which the
                President<lb/> from the Tebah addressed me, and on concluding, he and the vice led
                me to the Tebah,<lb/> where I addressed the congregation for 10 minutes or so. After
                which I read the Evening<lb/> Service, paid musaph<add>?</add> next day, and
                preached; <persName>Mr. Maduro</persName> my assistant Reader read the<lb/> second
                Evening and following day. I read <add>שבת שיבה</add> and preached on
                    <date>Kippoor</date> my portion<lb/> was <add>מוסף</add> &amp; <add>כל
                    נדרי</add>, <add>ערבית</add>, a sermon, and <add>נעילה</add>. I did not again
                preach till <date>Succot, the<lb/> 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> day</date>. We had a
                large assembly on <add>הושענה רבה</add>, save on <add>שמיני עצרת</add>, very bad
                weather, and a<lb/> thin attendance on <add>שמחת התורה</add>; on which day I had to
                go to Government House to pay<lb/> my respects to the Governor, and show my loyalty,
                it being the late Kings' birthday.<lb/> Since then I have spoken to the people every
                    <date>sabbath</date>, also on the <date>25<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Oct.</date>,
                the<lb/> annual <date>thanksgiving day</date> after the expiration of the hurricane
                season, on<lb/> which occasion I sent them all home with red eyes and noses. Except
                the two<lb/>
                <date>Sabbaths</date> when I was too ill to leave the house I have spoken the word.
                The old<lb/> members declare that I am much improved, whilst the young ones who only
                remember<lb/> me as children are highly pleased with me. On last <date>Monday night
                    the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</date>
                <add>?</add>.<lb/> we had a special service, as the advertisement in the paper
                stated, as a tribute<lb/> of loyalty, affection, and homage to the memory of the
                late Sovereign <persName>Frederick VII</persName>.<lb/> The Synagogue was very
                tastefully hung in black; the four large pillars having<lb/> black draperies folded
                around them spirally, the two pilasters at the Hechal, the Tebah,<lb/> large
                candlesticks, and brass knobs being covered with table trappings. An audience<lb/>
                filling every inch of the building (at least 500 persons) consisting of our
                congregation, and<lb/> a very large number of Christians, assembled at 7 PM. The
                Governor and his suite, and several<lb/> heads of departments were present; among
                the rest, the Presbyterian, Lutheran, and<lb/> Moravian clergymen. The service began
                with the chanting of the 49<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Psalm, then</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p><add>ערבית</add>; after which <add>ויהי נועם</add> was sung, and the <add>חנוכה</add>
                lights lighted, and <add>ארוחים ק"ה</add><lb/> said, Kaddish &amp;
                    Barecha<add>?</add> sung, and <add>עלינו לשבח</add> read with great Emphasis. I
                then<lb/> preached from Ecclesiastes v. 8 <add>ויתרון ארץ בכל היא</add> about an
                hour. After which, the whole<lb/> audience standing, I recited, in English, the
                    <add>השכבה</add> for the repose of the kings seal;<lb/> which set all the Danes
                crying, men and women. Then followed the <add>הנותן תשועה</add> in<lb/> English, for
                which the ark was opened by our old friend <persName>Mayer Wolff</persName>, who, as
                it was<lb/> a public occasion, was dressed in full military uniform, and looked
                every inch a<lb/> fine veteran soldier. The whole was concluded with Yigdals, and
                the <add>יברכך</add> in<lb/> Hebrew &amp; English, with which we finish all services
                in the Synagogue. The whole<lb/> went off with the greatest <add>?</add>, and will
                do us good here. I felt highly proud<lb/> of my congregation, for tho' they always
                behave well in Synagogue, and are not<lb/> excelled by any Jewish Assembly for
                prayer in the known world in this respect,<lb/> yet on this occasion the whole
                proceedings were so very orderly and dignified,<lb/> that they could not have been
                better. The <sic>chaunting</sic> and responses were particularly<lb/> fine. As to my
                sermon it was much applauded by some, and slightly found fault with<lb/>
                <add>?</add> others, according as they Supposed to be Danes or <del>and</del>
                Germans. The <placeName>Holstein</placeName> question<lb/> you may suppose is
                discussed and debated here, and sometimes with great bitterness.<lb/> Being no
                    <sic>partizan</sic>, I only spoke of the king as his acts, in giving a most
                liberal<lb/> constitution, in endeavoring to unite his people, gaining their love
                and affection, and<lb/> counselling his relative, the king of the Greeks, to do the
                same fully warranted my doing.<lb/> Judging him by his public acts, he was in truth
                a patriotic king, and I took<lb/> advantage of pointing out by the lights of
                        <date><sic>Hanukah</sic></date>, how <placeName>Israel</placeName> valued
                patriotism,<lb/> which after 2000 years they still continued to celebrate, and how
                highly they esteemed<lb/> it in others, especially in those who, with power,
                combined the desire of granting the<lb/> rights of civil and religious liberty to
                their fullest extent, as was the case with the<lb/> late King. My bold sentiments
                have made me (for the <add>?</add>) very popular; and my members<lb/> are
                consequently pleased that their minister should be well spoken of, and his
                preaching<lb/> admired. But I am too old to be vain of Popular applause: yet I am
                gratified<lb/> that the attempt to do my duty has not been exceeded by any other
                Clergyman in<lb/> the place.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">With reference to the state of parties in the congregation, affairs
                are<lb/> much more quietly and peaceably conducted than <del>when</del> they were
                when I<lb/> was minister here before. There are a great many young people married
                and un-<lb/>married who both think and act far differently to what was then the
                mode. They<lb/> keep down the turbulent determinedly; for still some of the old
                    l<add>?</add> remains, constantly<lb/> kept in a state of fermentation by one of
                the most mischievous men I ever met with. Some<lb/> of these dissatisfied ones
                wanted no minister at all, because their <add>?</add> would have<lb/> been made
                larger to support him. With the exception of a very very few, whom I<lb/> hope by
                discretion and prudence to gain over, <del>the <add>?</add>
                </del> the whole body of members is well<lb/> affected to me. We seldom have less
                than 150 to 180 persons present every<lb/>
                <date>Sabbath</date> morning about 20 to 25 every <date>Friday</date> Evening, the
                same member to<lb/> mincha<add>?</add> on <date>Sabbath</date>, and about 35 or
                    <date>Sabbath</date> Evening. You will agree with me that this<lb/> is not bad.
                I should say that our member, all told, approaches close to 400.</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Our funerals and marriages are conducted with great solemnity. I
                have<lb/> had 2 of the former, and one of the latter (celebrated in Synagogue) since
                my<lb/> arrival. I spoke on Each occasion. The marriage was a s<add>?</add>gated
                one. The<lb/> parties (both Israelites) <hi rend="underline">had</hi> already been
                married civilly in <placeName>New Grenada</placeName>, and so it was<lb/> somewhat
                anomalous. We anticipated some loud complaints when the new assessmt.<lb/> should be
                fixed, as the tapes would be so much heavier, but with the exception<lb/> of the
                    <add>גרום</add> I before mentioned, who threatened to create a scandal, if his
                assessment<lb/> was not fixed at the sum he named, there has not been a murmur. The
                Representatives<lb/> refused to be frightened; and so he is left to create what
                scandal he pleases. But he<lb/> is so much disliked, and Government is so rejoiced
                at the peaceable turn things<lb/> have taken under the new minister, that he will,
                no doubt, take care of what he<lb/> does, particularly as he is an arrant coward. At
                this moment, the feeling upper-<lb/>most among the Jewish public is the enlargement
                of the Synagogue, very much<lb/> needed. For this purpose it is proposed to
                appropriate the present “reserve<lb/> fund,” amounting to <del>about</del> $3000,
                and make up the deficiency in the required<lb/> sum by subscriptions among Jews and
                Christians. Our old friend <persName>Mayer Wolff</persName><lb/> is very
                enthusiastic on the subject, so are <persName>Dr. Pretto</persName>,
                    <persName>Messrs. Osorio</persName>, <persName>Debatte</persName>,<lb/>

                will keep you posted in the matter as it progresses.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The Sunday School will, I hope, very soon be reorganized on its
                old<lb/> popular footing, and the ceremony of confirmation be again introduced<lb/>
                agreeably to Law. There is a good deal of true religious fervor among the<lb/>
                majority, and a total indifference to religion, its decencies, and obligations
                among<lb/> a few families. But with time the latter may come round. There is
                work<lb/> enough cut out for me, but, with God's blessing, I hope to get through
                it.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">There has been some demand for your prayer books (Sephardim)<lb/>
                Pentatuech, and small English Bibles. You can send 25 of the latter, and<lb/> a few
                of each of the former, by <hi rend="underline">the very first opportunity</hi>.
                    <date>Sabbath</date> is so<lb/> very near that I cannot venture to write more,
                and as I was assured<lb/> that my news would be more welcome than any observations I
                might<lb/> make on the strange conduct of one of your former friends, about<lb/>
                which you last wrote me, I delay making any remarks on your letters<lb/> till I next
