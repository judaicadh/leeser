				<p rend="align(center)"><placeName>Charleston&#44; S. C.</placeName>  <date>Sept. 10. 5617&#47;1857</date>.</p>
				<p><addressee>Rev. Isaac Leeser</addressee>&#44; <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Dear Sir&#8212;More than four weeks ago<lb/> I addressed a letter to you&#44; with the request to send me<lb/> a copy of your octavo Bible bound in purple velvet&#44; with<lb/> gilded clasp &#38;c&#44; designed for a nuptial present&#44; and in&#45;<lb/>close my bill the amount of which I do not know.  The<lb/> wedding took place yesterday&#44; and I have not yet received<lb/> the Bible&#44; although I wrote that I wanted it in the first<lb/> week of <date>September</date>.  As it is&#44; I would be glad&#44; to receive<lb/> it at least before <add>Hebrew</add>.  It is to be presented to <persName>Mrs.<lb/> Sarah I. Davega</persName>&#44; formerly <persName>Mrs. I. J. Moses</persName>&#44; sister to my wife.<lb/>  What say to this news&#63;  No doubt&#44; you heard of this &#8220;match&#8221;<lb/> before&#44; considering that you are generally <hi rend="underline">an courant</hi> with<lb/> all that transpires at least amongst the Israelites of <placeName>Charles&#45;<lb/>ton</placeName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">But&#44; have you been informed also of the<lb/> discussion which has been carried on&#44; for the last  weeks&#44; on<lb/> the subject of the Swiss Treaty&#44; in the <hi rend="underline">Courier</hi> of this city&#63;  Have<lb/> you been informed that&#44; after I had published an Article&#44; on<lb/> the <date>13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of August</date> last&#44; calling upon the Jews of <placeName>Charleston</placeName>&#44; &#8220;to<lb/> act now in concert&#44; and forget all differences of religious opinion&#44;&#8221; and appealing to the Press for assistance&#44; &#8220;<hi rend="underline">A Jew</hi>&#8221; appeared<lb/> in the same paper charging me with &#8220;either ignorance<lb/> or hasty and impetuous zeal&#44;&#8221; and cautioning the Jews against<lb/> being aroused to action&#44; since by that treaty &#8220;their rights&#44; as Americans</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>are not assailed&#44; and their religious privilege in no way molested&#8221;&#63;  I<lb/> replied&#44; sustaining my position&#44; and declared at the conclusion that<lb/> I should no farther notice any &#8220;<hi rend="underline">anonymous</hi>&#8221; communication.  Yet&#44; &#8220;A Jew&#8221;<lb/> again came forth&#44; defending the treaty&#44; repeating the charge of my ignorance&#44;<lb/> and calling all that had as yet been written on the subject by<lb/> Editors &#8220;flimsy remarks.&#8221;  In reply to him&#44; <persName>Mr. J. N. Cardoza</persName><lb/> entered the arena in a most gentlemanly and quiet Article.<lb/>  To this &#8220;A Jew&#8221; replied in a most scurrilous and insulting<lb/> Article&#44; without even once coming to the point at issue&#44; nay&#33; he was<lb/> even so ungenerous &#38; uncharitable&#44; not to say ungentlemanly&#44; to cast<lb/> some open flings at me&#44; although I had withdrawn from the controversy<lb/> and thus placed myself beyond the possibility of <sic>defence</sic>.</p>
				<p>Now <persName>Mr. N.</persName> published an Article&#44; containing a most withering<lb/> lesson for the unavoidable position which &#8220;A Jew&#8221; had taken in this affair.<lb/>  The latter took <sic>offence</sic> at this and published a card&#44; demanding<lb/> an explanation from <persName>Mr. C.</persName> This was not given&#44; and so there<lb/> was for the last 3 days a fine prospect of a duel.  Things&#44;<lb/> however&#44; I think&#44; are now settled.  You yourself were drawn<lb/> into this controversy.  In his first Article&#44; <persName>Mr. C.</persName> quoted from<lb/> the Occident&#44; Vol. XII&#44; p. 95&#45;100&#44; to prove that you had then already<lb/> written against the Treaty <hi rend="underline">as it now stands</hi>&#59; &#8220;A Jew&#8221; denied<lb/> this fact&#44; in his reply&#44; maintaining that you meant the original draft<lb/> containing the word &#8220;<hi rend="underline">Christian</hi>&#44;&#8221; and to prove this&#44; he quoted<lb/> <hi rend="underline">from Vol. 15&#44; <date>March &#39;51</date></hi>&#33;&#33;&#33;  Is this not very fair&#44; after <persName>Mr C.</persName> had<lb/> quoted your very words and which could certainly not be found in the<lb/> <date>March</date> Number of <date>1851</date>&#33;&#63;  What must &#8220;A Jew&#8221; now think of<lb/> this incidental point&#44; after having read your Article on the<lb/> Swiss Treaty&#44; in which you refer to the very pages quoted<lb/> by <persName>Mr. C.</persName>&#63;  Has your usual informant or reporter not com&#45;</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>municated all this to you&#63;  If he has&#44; did he give you also the<lb/> name of &#8220;A Jew.&#8221;&#63;  At all events&#44; I will give it to you.  It is<lb/> <persName>Mr. <hi rend="underline">Charles H. Moise</hi></persName>.  I do not envy him for the laurels which<lb/> he has won in this warfare&#59; all he gained is this&#44; that the Press of <placeName>S. C.</placeName><lb/> become lukewarm &#38; indifferent&#44; after some papers had taken<lb/> up our cause.  Nevertheless&#44; a memorial will be sent to the President<lb/> by Jews&#44; if not <hi rend="underline">the</hi> Jews of <placeName>Charleston</placeName>&#59; it is now being circulated<lb/> for subscription.  Will you expose this extraordinary proceeding of a<lb/> Jew in this affair&#63;  Justice demands it&#33;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I read your Article on the New Prayer&#45;book &#8220;<hi rend="underline">Minhag</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline"><placeName>America</placeName></hi>&#44;&#8221; in the last month&#39;s <hi rend="underline">Occidents</hi>.  I agree fully with you<lb/> concerning the transgression of power by the Compilers&#59; I wrote<lb/> the <hi rend="underline">same</hi> truths to <persName>Dr Cohn</persName> in <placeName>Albany</placeName> <hi rend="underline">already two months</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">ago</hi>&#44; that is&#44; before you published your strictures.  I think the<lb/> very title is a piece of presumption and usurpation which<lb/> cannot be justified save by means of vulgar abuse and<lb/> contemptible insults.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Now an open and honest explanation&#59; I received your<lb/> invitation to the Consecration of your Synagogue.  I did not<lb/> answer&#44; nor attend.  Why&#63;  Because I endorse every word contained<lb/> in the Editorial of the <hi rend="underline">Asmonean</hi>&#44; of <date>May 9.</date> last&#44; and referring<lb/> to the establishment of your congregation.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">With my wife&#39;s and my own best regard&#44; and our wishes<lb/> for the coming New&#45;Year&#44; I remain&#44; as ever&#44;</p>
			<p rend="indent(10)">Yours&#44;</p>
			<p rend="indent(10)">most respectfully</p>
			<p rend="indent(11)"><persName role="author">Dr M Mayer</persName></p>
				<p>P.S. What is <persName>Mr. S. Jacobs</persName> doing&#63;  Is it </p>
				<p>true&#44; that he has been appointed Professor of </p>
				<p>the Hebrew&#44; at the Girard College&#44; with a salary</p>
				<p>of &#36;2000 a year&#63;  So <persName>Mr A. H. Abrahams</persName> tells the people here.</p>
				<p>What is is salary as Lecturer&#63;  Did you ever <sic>here</sic> the particulars of his resignation&#63;</p>
