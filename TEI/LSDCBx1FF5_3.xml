                                        acknowledged it before, but<lb/> the enclosed reflections
                                        must impart plead my excuse if they meet<lb/> your
                                        approbation at the time I received it I was also engaged
                                        in<lb/> writing to a clergyman who after a lapse of five
                                        years had the Grace<lb/> to answer a letter which I write to
                                        him on subjects connected with<lb/> our Holy religion.
                                        however I delivered your enclosed letter to our<lb/> friend

                                        also called on the<lb/> Publisher of the Jewish Chronicle
                                        who in as much surprised that<lb/> there should have been

                                        feel very happy if<lb/> I could contribute to your success,

                                        <persName>Dr Raphael</persName> is correct in stating that
                                        the Publisher [?] was prosecuted<lb/> but I do not think it
                                        could have been for this publication you will see<lb/> that
                                        several of the books have been translated published in the
                                        works<lb/> of learned men here. but I remember seeing in his
                                        shop windows in<lb/> fleet street an atrocious caricature of
                                        the almighty in which he was<lb/> depicted with all the
                                        figurative descriptions used in the Bible <lb/> at the foot
                                        "Christians Here is your God as by Law established"</p>
                              <p>I believe few persons had the audacity to enter the shop purchase
                                        it<lb/> I had not. I see the result of your interview with

                                        decr (which the publisher politely sent me) that my letter

                                        accompanied<lb/> by an answer which on account of the [?] of

                                        doing up shortly with a running commentary</p>

                                        notice of it, but not if it<lb/> is anonymous perhaps you
