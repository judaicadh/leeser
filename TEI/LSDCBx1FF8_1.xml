            </p>
            <p>My Dear Friend:</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The Occident is at hand and I find that I shall have to wait
                for<lb/> the <date>October</date> No. before my reply comes forth. You are the best
                judge in those<lb/> matters, but it seems to me that provided you had the time to
                get it up, it<lb/> would have been better if it had appeared at the same time as
                    “<persName>C's</persName>”—however<lb/> you know best, and it might have
                mutilated against you as a journalist,<lb/> altho it is a query whether the
                proprietor of a paper should allow a <sic>libellous</sic><lb/> article to appear,
                when he knows beforehand that it is a libel.</p>
            <p rend="Note:">“Mutilated” is handwritten.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I have no copy of the refutation I sent you. Will you oblige me<lb/>
                with a proof at your earliest convenience. If I had had more time I could have<lb/>
                answered on several other points, which I think you might introduce into your<lb/>
                note or remarks—viz. “<persName>C</persName>” starts with the <sic>intetion</sic> of
                going by the “Record”—<lb/> he had <sic>thesame</sic> opportunity of referring to
                the record as I had—<sic>het</sic> he does<lb/> not bring it forward as proof of his
                assertions—he <hi rend="underline">positively deceives</hi> you<lb/> into publishing
                a libel on <hi rend="underline">me</hi>. I bring the record.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. Elements of Jewish faith is a deception.
                Should<lb/> have been Elements of <persName>Poznanki's</persName>
                faithlessness.”</p>
            <p rend="Note:">“Jewish” is handwritten.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">3. <persName>S. N. C.</persName> neither <hi rend="underline"
                    >painted beautiful pictures</hi> or <hi rend="underline">portraits</hi>
                from<lb/> imagination, he only prevented a daguerreo <sic>type</sic> view of things
                as they really are.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">4. <persName>C.</persName> refers to the Trustees for the truth of
                his assertion about<lb/> the creed—and says the Pres. <persName>Mr.
                O</persName><lb/> at that time was on the Committee. This is false. <persName>Mr.
                    O.</persName> was not. The board<lb/> consisted of</p>
            <p rend="Note:">“Pres. <persName>Mr. O</persName>” is handwritten.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">“The doctrine of a personal Messiah is generally regarded as
                unfounded<lb/> by our Congregation and as a source of evil to the Jewish
                nation.”—</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">This goes to prove that “<persName>C</persName>” makes a fool of
                himself when he speaks of<lb/>
                <persName>Dr. E.</persName> touching gratuitously on the vital principle of the
                Messiah, or that it<lb/> is done to deceive the unwary. You can use the quotation
                above; I copied it<lb/> from the original.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)"><persName>C.</persName> was told <sic>theday</sic> the proof was
                recd. by <persName>Mr. Moise</persName> and <persName>Mr. Valentine</persName><lb/>
                that his assertions were false, that <persName>S. N. C.</persName> could bring
                Documents to prove<lb/> his assertions, yet he did not suppress it, altho he had two
                weeks to do it in—<lb/> and the records examine or refer to. The result has been
                that the<lb/> party has ceased going to Synagogue as the creed a la
                    <persName>Poznasty</persName> is still on the<lb/> walls— Yesterday
                    <persName>Dr. E.</persName> had 4 members in Synagogue.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Your remarks are the admiration of everybody. You hail
                    "<persName>C</persName>" as a firm<lb/> believer in the faith. <persName>Mr. N.
                    Levin</persName> told me he could prove by <persName>Sol</persName><lb/> that
                    <persName>Isaac Cardozo</persName> exposed himself before him and the sic
                persons "that<lb/> he did not believe in the bible"—this is nothing to me, but
                    <persName>Mr. C.</persName> better<lb/> take care how he becomes personal, he
