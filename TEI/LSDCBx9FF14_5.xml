				<p>To the Editor of the Occident <hi rend="underline">Education and the Ministry</hi></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Rev Sir&#33;</p>
			<p rend="indent(7)"><del>&#63;</del> <date>Shebat 5607</date>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(9)"><date>January 1847</date>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Both your articles in No 36 and 46 of your valuable<lb/> Periodical I have carefully read and reflected upon.  Would<lb/> every American Israelite do so&#44; and especially if those who<lb/> form our German Congregations could or would read the latter<lb/> article&#44; headed&#58; &#8220;Education for the ministry.&#8221; in the last number of the<lb/> Occident&#59; and if in doing so&#44; they would pay to it that close attention<lb/> and just regard&#44; which it truly deserves&#8212;then&#44; I am sure&#44; it can<lb/>not fail to effect their own good&#44; and to impress on the minds of the<lb/> people the dangers to which they are or will be exposed&#44; through the<lb/> snares of treacherous minds&#44; false tongues and deceitful hearts<lb/> under the disguise of Religion</p>
				<p>But I am sorry to say&#44; in regard to the realization of your plan or<lb/> the establishment of a high school I can entertain but faint hopes&#44;<lb/> when I consider the little encouragement <del>granted</del> extended at present to established<lb/> schools for religious instruction&#44; and the total absence of such in many<lb/> of our oldest and wealthiest congregations.&#8212;And these&#44; I venture<lb/> to say&#44; are the very places&#44; where all the attainments&#44; which a High<lb/> School can promise&#44; could be easily obtained&#44; if the people at large&#44;<lb/> particularly the wealthy classes would earnestly wish and take<lb/> measures that their children <del>may</del> might know of it a little more than the<lb/> chaunting of a Haphtorah or perhaps also the translation of a Yigdal.<lb/>  Nay&#44; that high respect and earnest desire for the knowledge of wisdom&#44;<lb/> that pure energy for the cause of religion which the Law commands&#44; and<lb/> you wish to see&#44; I am not able to find it&#59; it appears not to be in the minds<lb/> of the people.&#8212;And should the generous examples&#44; which noble&#45;<lb/>&#45;hearted men have offered to you&#44; arouse others for imitation and give success to<lb/> the good cause&#58;&#8212;then we must not be too rash in the estimation of its good<lb/> results.&#8212;No matter how high it be&#44; &#8220;when we quit the School&#44; we are but<lb/> Schoolboys and no more&#8221;&#8212;it is &#40;generally speaking&#41; a truth&#44; not understood<lb/> by either the youth&#44; or the <sic>publick</sic> at large&#44; but which every man of some<lb/> proficiency in any science or art would readily admit&#59; and how will then<lb/> that treasure&#44; which is more than all the treasures on earth&#8212;&#8220;the sacred Law&#8221;&#8212;<lb/> be safe in the hands of an American Schoolboy&#63; <del>&#63;</del> who</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>2</p>
				<p>is so little acquainted with living examples of holy and virtuous men<lb/> learned <del>of</del> in the Law&#44; and who perhaps <del>but for</del> except his schoolbooks&#44; never yet has<lb/> seen the title of another Hebrew book&#63;  And should I go too far in<lb/> underrating our American youth&#44; I am surely not too scrupulous<lb/> in apprehending that the boys placed on the pulpit will soon defy<lb/> the holy lessons of their teachers and their teachers&#39; teachers&#44; and<lb/> they might become &#8220;Shepherds that cannot understand and<lb/> Pastors&#8221; &#8220;that destroy and scatter the Sheep of the<lb/> pasture.&#8221;  Let the history of foreigners and foreign ministry be a<lb/> warning example to <placeName>America</placeName>.  On exposing some dangers in the<lb/> nature of your plan&#44; I intend by no means to disparage its<lb/> value and import and&#44; but on the contrary&#44; our consciousness of such<lb/> dangers&#44; will induce and prepare us to act with the greater caution<lb/> and prudence&#44; that we might the better insure good success and<lb/> glorious results to the holy cause of Judaism.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">My remarks thus far concern the latter pages of your article&#44; and are<lb/> anticipated here&#44; because I preferred to answer first to points on the substance of<lb/> which we both would easily agree&#8212;But what concerns the first pages of your<lb/> &#8220;Educ. for the ministry&#8221; I candidly confess to you&#44; that in reading them I<lb/> felt grieved to the bottom of my heart.&#8212;To any sincere and religious Jewish mind<lb/> it must appear as <del>be</del> a horrible cruelty to see persecution&#44; oppression&#44; contempt and scorn<lb/> <sic>practised</sic> on men&#44; many of whom the Law of God might call the Pillars of Judaism<lb/> in <placeName>America</placeName>&#33;&#33;&#8212;We have men in <placeName>America</placeName>&#44; who from their cradle <del>off</del> have been brought<lb/> up in piety and learning&#44; men who have &#8220;a knowledge of moral philosophy&#44; of hebrew<lb/> in all its branches&#44; biblical comments&#44; mishnah&#44; Talmud&#44; Jewish history and<lb/> &#8220;antiquity&#44; Algebra&#44; French&#44; German&#44; general History and Geography&#8221;<lb/> and who are &#8220;not unacquainted with English Literature and Grammar&#8221; &#40;or in<lb/> saying this I have made use only of the same order and terms wherewith you described<lb/> the studies of a High School&#41; &#91;page A76.&#93; would I make any addition instead of &#8220;a<lb/> knowledge&#8221; on many heads I would have said &#8220;Eminence and erudition&#8221; I would<lb/> have also said&#44; men of logical and sound reasoning and argument and of considerable<lb/> experience&#59; and what is <del>the</del> more than all&#44; personally known to us for a number of years as<lb/> men who know no disguise&#44; who are peaceful virtuous&#44; pure and firm in principle and<lb/> practice of religion&#44; strict <del>for</del> as regards themselves and tolerant towards others&#8212;There are<lb/> also others of whom we would but partly speak in the above terms&#44; and perhaps not<lb/> at all apply the latter additions&#59; but after all no more indulgence than actually<lb/> occasionally used in <placeName>America</placeName>&#44; might be needed in their behalf.&#8212;&#8220;And where</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">3</p>
				<p>can we find these men&#8221;&#63;<del>&#63;</del>  I have seen them in a &#8220;little Grocery&#44;&#8221;<lb/> a &#8220;Slaughterhouse&#44;&#8221; a &#8220;Coalyard&#44;&#8221; a &#8220;Tavern&#44;&#8221; a &#8220;Cigar&#45;or other shop&#44;&#8221;<lb/> such and the like are the places&#44; whither the <del>worthy</del> men <del>to</del> worthy to grow the ministry<lb/> have been pushed back by the Errors of the multitude&#44; and &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; &#8212; &#45; &#8212;&#33;</p>
				<p>&#8220;And for God&#39;s sake&#44; how is it them possible&#44; that all this be true and be still<lb/> inconsistency with your statements about the lamentations of the people<lb/> &#8220;of the nearly total absence of qualified men for the office of duly educated<lb/> &#8220;<hi rend="underline">religious teachers</hi>&#8221;&#63;</p>
				<p>&#8220;of the great want of intelligent persons&#44; wanted for the ministry&#44;<lb/> &#8220;in manner that the <hi rend="underline">Word of God</hi> may be <hi rend="underline">expounded</hi> to the<lb/> &#8220;people&#8221;&#63;  How is it consistent with your saying&#58; &#8220;we know of<lb/> &#8220;no candidates &#40;for <hi rend="underline">religious Teachers</hi>&#41; or persons likely to become so<lb/> &#8220;to supply new Congregations or to take the place of the <hi rend="underline">ministers</hi> now<lb/> &#8220;officiating.&#8221;&#63;</p>
				<p>Part of my statements I could easily verify to every reader by only referring<lb/> him to former volumes of the Occident&#44; and therefore I need not be plainer<lb/> about that&#8212;and as to your&#39;s Sir&#33;  I say&#44; So &#8220;and <del>tell</del> show my people<lb/> &#8220;their transgression&#44; and the house of <persName>Jacob</persName> their sins&#8221; they are<lb/> &#8220;speaking oppression and revolt&#44; conceiving from the heart words of<lb/> &#8220;falsehood&#8221; tell them to call things by their right names&#44; to say what<lb/> they mean and to mean what they say&#44; and this will <del>dissolve matters and</del><lb/> show forth the truth.&#8212; &#8220;A man whose voice pleases&#44; or one whose speech suits<lb/> his publick&#8221; is&#44; with few exceptions&#44; the general definition of Jewish ministry in<lb/> <placeName>America</placeName>&#59; and the people would rarely call a man fit <del>for</del> to be minister&#44; if his<lb/> voice do not please their taste.&#8212;Let them thus not cry out for want of<lb/> &#8220;<hi rend="underline">ministers</hi>&#8221; &#8220;<hi rend="underline">Religious Teachers</hi>&#8221; &#8220;men who know <hi rend="underline">to expound</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">the Law of God</hi> to the people&#8221; let them not use false words and call<lb/> the name of God&#58; &#8220;Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy<lb/> God in vain&#8221;&#8212;And only this much we say&#44; but we do neither conjure<lb/> the good policy nor dispute the just purpose and beneficial results of having such<lb/> officers in large communities&#44; for the people will say&#44; that it confers on them a<lb/> signified pleasure&#44; that it arouses their feelings of devotion&#44; and that it gives<lb/> solemnity to worship&#44; just at the proper place and time&#8212;during the service<lb/> in the Synagogue&#8212;And to deliver a discourse from the pulpit&#44; will that<lb/> really <del>say to</del> be <hi rend="underline">expounding the Law of God</hi>&#63;  will it strike the mind and teach it<lb/> &#8220;to know wisdom and instruction&#44; to understand the words of the wise and<lb/> &#8220;their dark sayings&#8221;&#63; or will it rather strike our senses&#44; deceive our hearts</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>4</p>
				<p>dazzle our eyes&#44; and at the end make us Sin and forget the divine command&#58;<lb/> &#8220;ye shall not seek after your own hearts and your own eyes&#8221;&#63;<lb/>  &#40;vis Talmud Berachott <add>&#63;</add> 12&#41; These and more questions one might ask and<lb/> perhaps <persName>Blair&#39;s</persName> Rhetorick itself and daily experience might argue<lb/> in his favour&#44; but in one word I would answer him&#58; &#8220;All depends<lb/> on the man&#44;&#8221; it will do good from a good man&#44; and in the words of<lb/> the royal Psalmist let us say&#58; &#8220;Lord&#44; who shall abide in thy tabernacle&#63;<lb/> ....&#8220;he that walketh uprightly&#44; and worketh righteousness&#44; and<lb/> &#8220;speaketh the truth in his heart&#44; he that backbiteth not with his<lb/> &#8220;tongue&#44; nor <hi rend="underline">doeth evil to his neighbour</hi>&#44; <hi rend="underline">nor taketh up a</hi><lb/> &#8220;<hi rend="underline">reproach against his neighbour</hi>&#8212;<hi rend="underline">he that honoreth them</hi><lb/> &#8220;<hi rend="underline">that fear the Lord</hi>.&#95;&#95;.he <hi rend="underline">that not taketh bribery against the</hi><lb/> &#8220;<hi rend="underline">innocent</hi>&#8221; &#40;Psalm 15.&#41;&#59; and if we do not know&#44; or rather know the man<lb/> not to be so&#44; we again apply the words of that holy book&#58; &#8220;But unto<lb/> &#8220;the wicked God saith&#44; what hast thou to do to declare my<lb/> &#8220;statutes&#44; then givest thy mouth to evil&#44; and thy tongue frameth<lb/> &#8222;deceit.&#8221; &#40;Psalm 50. 16&#44; 19.&#41;</p>
				<p>Thus the more I consider and reflect upon the state of Judaism amongst<lb/> us&#44; the more I am convinced&#44; that something must be done for the<lb/> good&#44; some remedy must be sought for&#59; independent therefore of your<lb/> plan&#44; I offer you herewith my suggestions&#44; which at once may form<lb/> the conclusion of this letter.&#95;&#95;In my estimation this evil&#44; and<lb/> some others say in the organization of the Congregations&#44; &#40;<add>&#63;</add>wel here<lb/> as in other countries perhaps&#44; but I merely speak of <placeName>America</placeName>&#41; and that is the<lb/> quarter the remedy must come from.&#8212;Instead of that prejudicial show<lb/> of superiority and empty domination&#44; which creates favorite <add>&#63;</add><lb/> and supports men in indolence <del>and wantonness&#44; instead of that</del> let us in future promote<lb/> and elevate religion and virtue&#44; <del>study&#44;</del> learning and talent&#8212;To be<lb/> plainer on the subject&#58; Let every Congregation&#44; newly to be formed&#44; abolish<lb/> the office of Shamas &#40;Sexton&#41; as an office of the Congregation&#59; but let all its lower<lb/> duties&#44; including those <del>of attending</del> required during service&#44; be done for real on able wages<lb/> by a suitable person hired or appointed by the trustees as a messenger. <del>or</del><lb/> <del>carrier</del>&#8212;And should there be any thing <del>be</del> that belongs to ceremony or decorum<lb/> during service&#44; any honorable member or trustee might be expected voluntarily<lb/> to act for the benefit of the community&#44; and in this way saving part of the<lb/> salary&#44; rent&#44; collection and other revenues of that office&#44; a Congregation<lb/> will be enabled to have two clerical officers&#44; let them both me ministers<lb/> or Elders&#44; and if the one be more able to <del>the</del> gratify <del>cation</del> of the members and the<lb/> solemnity of the service by his agreeable voice&#44; let the other be more to <del>&#63;</del> superintend our children&#39;s<lb/> instruction <del>and edification</del> and to add to the edifications of the adults&#59; for I wish the one and the other to be religious teachers not<lb/> merely Schoolmasters.  From my observations communicated to you<lb/> it might be inferred that we will find in this country suitable men qualified in English<lb/> for that station&#44; let us then place worthy men in <del>worthy</del> places worthy of them and we might<lb/> <del>also</del> expect them to become after a time <del>at once</del> also good pulpit orators <del>on the pulpit</del> in<lb/> places where the public might wish for it.
