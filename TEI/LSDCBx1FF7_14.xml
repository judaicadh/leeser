                                        my mind. Before I started my School, the <persName>Revd. Mr.
                                                  Davis</persName> had<lb/> carried on his for 4 ½
                                        years and could never muster more than 14 or 15 pupils; he
                                        has<lb/> now about 5 and I have 50 with some 14 or more on
                                        my list of expectancies. The<lb/> opposition I have
                                        encountered <del>is p</del> was entirely from his party, who
                                        viewed my attempt<lb/> at establishing myself in my old
                                                  <add>?</add> as trespass in his vested interests,
                                        a<lb/> sort of <add>מסיג גבול</add>. But parents have
                                        thought differently, and truly I may say of my<lb/>
                                        adversaries <add>אלקים להרע עמדי ולא נתנם</add>. I know of a
                                        certainty that many wish to see me<lb/> occupying his place,
                                        and cherish the hope; be cause they know, from the past,
                                        that<lb/> I would not be the wrong man. Nor is it at all

                                        lucrative, which his growing family renders imperative.
                                        His<lb/> friends talk about raising his salary again. It is
                                        now £300 a year, with house<lb/> and other perquisites. But
                                                  <add>איה הכסף</add>? The congregation is but a

                                        prop of the Institution; and times are bad, with<lb/> slight
                                        hopes of amendment. His engagement will expire next
                                                  <date><sic>may</sic></date>. Altho' I have<lb/> no
                                        children, those of my deceased brother in law are dear to
                                        me, and I should<lb/> like <add>אם ירצה השם</add> to be the
                                        means of advancing them in life. I am not able to do
                                        more<lb/> for them at present than to give them education.
                                        After this open statement of my<lb/> position, let me have

                                        the remainder of her life should be devoted in preparation

                                        What a gigantic intellect<lb/> has the writer of that
                                        article, and how luminous bright and powerfully</p>

                              <p>convincing are his deductions. I could not get up from its<lb/>
                                        perusal after I began to read it. It was a dessert, a juicy,

                                        intend going over it a second and a third time. It is well
                                        translated<lb/> too, especially when the extreme difficulty

                                        interminably long sentences, and his parenthetical style

                                        Rabbinism could find many such commentators<lb/> among
                                        modern Rabbis as <persName>Dr. Hirsh</persName>, our

                                        of what we read of the <add>גאון</add> of old<lb/> with his

                                        from them—whilst the latter<lb/> improvised with all the
                                        fervency, fluency and fire of oriental<lb/> eloquence, in
                                        which the richest imagery and boldest figures were

                                        think how immeasur-<lb/>ably superior the discourses of
                                        those glorious old Rabbais whose<lb/> names figure there
                                        must have been to the fine spun prolixities<lb/> of modern
                                        preachers. “And yet for all that” has been the cause<lb/> of
                                        inflicting on your patience a lot of Bosh<add>?</add> which
