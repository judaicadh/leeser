            <p rend="indent(2)">Dear Sir</p>
            <p rend="indent(3)">Knowing the deep interest<lb/> you manifest in every thing
                appertaining to our<lb/> people I have selected this opportunity
                <del>o</del>for<lb/> giving you an outline of the causes which<lb/> lend to the
                present excitement and anarchy<lb/> in our congregation. While I deeply deplore<lb/>
                the circumstances which have lead to the above results I cannot but
                    <sic>beleive</sic> that the final<lb/> result will be beneficial, and will tend
                towards<lb/> showing to the world that if a few zealous<lb/> &amp; perhaps well
                meaning men rashly break down<lb/> the essentials which support our Holy
                Religion<lb/> there are those (and many of them) who will cling to<lb/> it the more
                closely the greater the attempts to<lb/> innovate &amp; reform it. You cannot reform
                the<lb/> Jewish Religion—it is an absurdity. There<lb/> are but two Religions taught
                in the Bible<lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">Judaism</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">Christianity</hi> if
                you break down<lb/> the <hi rend="underline">fences</hi> which support the former
                &amp;<lb/> which were built up by an almighty arm<lb/> you must necessarily enter
                upon <sic>christian</sic><lb/> Ground. Every unbiased &amp; reflecting mind<lb/>
                will acknowledge this a just conclusion.<lb/> But I <sic>shant</sic> tire your
                patience with any</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>2</p>
            <p>more remarks. But will relate the unhappy events<lb/> which have just transpired</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">You are perhaps aware there are about 70<lb/> Yechidim (voters) of
                our congregation—among that<lb/> member there are 18 or 20 ultra Reformers,
                about<lb/> the same number satisfied with the present<lb/> service &amp; the Balance
                willing to go back to our<lb/> old mode of service—although not objectionable<lb/>
                but fearing further charges.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">On the first day of the last<lb/>
                <date>passover</date> the <persName>Rev G. Poznanski</persName> delivered an
                English<lb/> discourse commemorative of the day &amp;c. and at the<lb/> close of the
                discourse spoke of the <hi rend="underline">useless</hi> observance<lb/> of the
                second day, that the exact time was now<lb/> known &amp; this being known positively
                by our almanacs<lb/> the observance therefore of the second day was<lb/> altogether
                useless &amp; unnecessary. This annunciation<lb/> caused great excitement and
                dissatisfaction<lb/> 8 or 9 persons (among whom was <persName>Mr Moses</persName>)
                walked out<lb/> of the Synagogue. The matter was talked of<lb/> incessantly &amp;
                discontent prevailed to an alarming<lb/> extent. The Trustees met &amp; a Preamble
                &amp; Resolution<lb/> discountenancing the action of <persName>Mr
                    Poznanski</persName> was<lb/> made &amp; carried at this meeting of the Board.
                While in session<lb/> a letter was <sic>received</sic> from <persName>Mr
                    Poznanski</persName> regretting<lb/> the excitement produced—claiming a

            <p><sic>Bretheren</sic> who were driven from the <del>old</del> Synagogue<lb/> applied
                for Readmission with the privilege of a<lb/> vote. The opposite party heard of this
                fact<lb/> for it was not done secretly, &amp; when 3 Trustees<lb/> applied to the
                President <persName>Abraham Ottoler<add>?</add></persName> to<lb/> call a meeting
                (in accordance with the Constitution) to<lb/> elect <del>a President</del> these
                gentlemen, The President<lb/> refused to do so stating that a Petition had<lb/> been
                presented to him signed by a constitutional<lb/> member to call a public
                meeting—which he<lb/> must do &amp; that after said meeting he would call<lb/> the
                Trustees together.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I must here observe that to call<lb/> a public meeting for general
                purposes one third of<lb/> the Congregation petitionary to the President he is<lb/>
                empowered to call it. But to <hi rend="underline">alter the Constitution</hi><lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">one fourth</hi> of the congregation must petition to the<lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">Board of Trustees</hi>, before whom the petition<lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">must</hi> come for that purpose—when these gentl could have
                been elected</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The meeting was called, The President stated<lb/> he called the
                meeting in consequence of a Petition<lb/> received signed by 26 members and
                would<lb/> be happy to hear any remarks &amp;c.</p>

                societies—civil political &amp; Religious—</p>
            <p>Resolved That the Trustees were elected under<lb/> the implied assurance they would
                recognize this right</p>
            <p>Resolved that sufficient presumptive evidence<lb/> has been given to show that 4 out
                of the 7 of the<lb/> Trustees—(I will give their names <persName>Abm.

                <persName>Isaiah Moses</persName> &amp; <persName>Isaac Woolf</persName>) wish to
                elect a<lb/> body of men termed seceeders whose aim is to break<lb/> down the
                service now established &amp; to turn out<lb/> the Hazan, thus making a majority
                yield to<lb/> the wishes of a minority.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Mr Cordoza</persName> endeavoured to sustain<lb/> these
                Resolutions with real <hi rend="underline">federal</hi> sophistry—<lb/>
                <persName>Mr. Tobias</persName> answered him very ably and told<lb/> him they were
                unconstitutional.</p>
            <p>The last Resolution suspended the power<lb/> of the Trustees &amp; placed the
                government in<lb/> the hands of the Prest &amp; 5 men selected<lb/> by him. It was
                here <persName>Mr Tobias</persName> noticed<lb/> its unconstitutionality and told
                him that<lb/> the meeting was not called for to alter the<lb/> constitution, to be
                so, the Petition should come<lb/> before the Trustees. This was argued at<lb/> great
                length, some avowing their determination<lb/> to trample on the constitution, &amp;
