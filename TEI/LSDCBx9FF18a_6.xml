            <p>My dear friend.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">It is a singular fact that your form of<lb/>
                <hi rend="underline"><date>March 19</date></hi> only reached me a few days ago,
                which accounts<lb/> for the inquiries which I made in a late letter &amp; to
                which<lb/> you reply in yours of <hi rend="underline"><date>April 3d</date></hi>
                remarking that you had<lb/> previously answered me. Let that pass</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">My main object just now in addressing you is to<lb/> say that as
                soon as I hear from you of a day being<lb/> freed for the c<add>?</add> at
                    <placeName>New York</placeName> I shall make final<lb/> arrangements for my
                departure <del>passage</del>. The secretary<lb/> of the congregation informed you
                immediately of my appoint<lb/>ment as the Delegate. I shall leave here so as to<lb/>
                be in <placeName>NYork</placeName> by the <date>11th</date> proxo unless I hear that
                the day<lb/> has been postponed. I suppose the Occident of<lb/> the <date>1st</date>
                will satisfy me that the convention will be held<lb/> &amp; as soon as that is recd.
                I may start. In your<lb/> last No you talk of <hi rend="underline">many</hi>
                delegates from the same<lb/> congregation. Of course each <hi rend="underline"
                    >Congregation</hi> can only have<lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">one vote</hi> &amp; even as to delegates, if one congregation
                is<lb/> allowed too many, the delegates from some may not<lb/> get a chance to say a
                word. Look to this in time.</p>

            <p>“fixings” &amp; the longer certain good are kept out of<lb/> this climate (until they
                are used) the better. As regards<lb/> more money you had best write direct to
                    <persName>Mr Touro</persName> at<lb/> once, as he is <hi rend="underline">very
                    slow</hi> &amp; you can say that as you<lb/> presume I am absent starting you
                address him instead<lb/> of me. by the bye, say a word to him upon the
                importance<lb/> of this convention &amp; the propriety of each congregation
                sending<lb/> a proper delegate so that whatever expenses may grow<lb/> out of the
                convention he may not think the means of<lb/> the congregation are squandered.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I hope to meet <persName>Mr. Gutheim</persName> this summer<lb/>
                perhaps at the convention or if I take the <placeName>Sandusky</placeName><lb/>

            <p rend="indent(1)">I do not know if it will scarcely be worth while<lb/> for you to
                answer this letter, but still as I shall not<lb/> in all probability leave here
                before <date>20th</date> perhaps it will be as well<lb/> for you to do so in case
                you have anything to say of moment</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">If you wish to see me before we meet at the convention<lb/> write to
                me here <del>as ever</del> at once. I should like to have<lb/> talk with you in
                advance of any caucusing, but</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>I think we shall not differ much in our<lb/> notions about “Reforms”.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I hear that <persName>Mr. Nathan</persName> (the revd.) has<lb/>
                left <placeName>St Thomas</placeName>, &amp; gone to <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>
                to settle<lb/> up his business with his brother in law with<lb/> whom he was in
                partnership &amp; that he (<persName>Nathan</persName>)<lb/> will not return to
                    <placeName>St Thomas</placeName>. What's in the wind?<lb/> I have recd no
                letters from him for a long time past.<lb/> We continue to worship regularly in the
                rooms temporarily<lb/> prepared &amp; have an excellent “<hi rend="underline"
                    >Siphar</hi>” tho' small<lb/> which we can keep as long as I please.</p>
            <p>Between ourselves I doubt if the few who attend service<lb/> will continue after I
                leave here. If the yellow<lb/> fever is not prevalent in the summer I would
                like<lb/> to return &amp; consecrate the synagogue for the New Year.<lb/> Of this
                more anon.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Hoping that you may enjoy our approaching<lb/> festival &amp; be

            <p>Will you be kind enough to offer my fondest<lb/> love to my dear Aunt &amp; husband
                &amp; tell them<lb/> that I hope to visit them for a day or so ere very<lb/> long,
                as I have concluded to order the chandelier bracket &amp;c for<lb/> the gas to be
                used in the Synagogue, from your city &amp; shall desire to explain to<lb/>
