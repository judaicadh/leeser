				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>Charleston</placeName> <date>20h. April 1852</date>.</p>
				<p>My dear Sir.</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">Your esteemed favors p <persName>Mr Nathans</persName>. and p mail<lb/> <date>16th</date> met on at hand.  <persName>Euripides</persName> says.</p>
			<quote rend="indent(1)">&#8220;The Wise with hope&#44; support the pains of life.&#8221;</quote>
				<p>Not to quote the number less passages from scripture where<lb/> the same lesson is inculcated.  take consolation my good sir.<lb/> and do not despond&#8212;I see through the thin vapour which<lb/> is insufficient to obscure the brightness of the orb beyond.<lb/>  And as I do not possess more keenery of vision than<lb/> the rest of the community who use <hi rend="underline">these eyes</hi>&#44; <hi rend="underline">without</hi><lb/> the use of <hi rend="underline">yellow</hi> <add>or green</add> glasses.  depend upon it <persName>Caesar</persName> will get<lb/> his due in proper time&#44; only for the future bear in mind<lb/> the quotation from <persName>Horace</persName> Epistles XVIII.36..lib1.</p>
			<quote rend="indent(1)">&#8220;command not&#44; till a man is thoroughly known<lb/> Qualem commendes etiam atque etiam adspice&#44; ne<lb/> <add>a rascal trained&#44; you make his fault your own</add> <lb/> mox&#44; Incutiant aliena tibi peccata pudorem.&#8221; </quote>
				<p>What you could not do less than give <persName>Mr Myer</persName> such a<lb/> letter as you have described and which agrees with the<lb/> original.  Seen by <persName>Mr Moise</persName>&#44; I am perfectly satisfied and<lb/> so is <persName>Mr Moise</persName>&#44; There is no doubt but it made a<lb/> favorable impression altho it did not speak of his religious<lb/> principles&#8212;which <sic>ave</sic> developed in a letter to <persName>Mr Poznanski</persName><lb/> his belief in the bible subject to criticism&#8212;and that it also<lb/> contains&#44; &#8220;<hi rend="underline">Myths</hi>&#8221;&#8212;I suppose from mythos&#44; &#8220;<hi rend="underline">fables</hi><lb/> a fine teacher in <placeName><sic>Isaul</sic></placeName>&#44; who is to select the<lb/> <hi rend="underline">fables</hi> from the <hi rend="underline">Truths</hi>&#44; I should like to get hold of<lb/> a copy of the letter&#44; to send to you for publication.  These<lb/> ought to be a standard for Jewish belief if it is only</p>
			<pb n="1V"/>
				<p><sic>compized</sic> in only a full faith in the Bible.  If a man<lb/> cannot fully subscribe to this&#44; he is not fit to be a teacher<lb/> in <placeName>Israel</placeName>.  I do not think that all these things<lb/> being known you would have given him the paper&#44;<lb/> Resolutions were passed at the meeting on <date>Sunday</date> that<lb/> if the Gent came on they would be happy to see him<lb/> but made no appropriation to pay his expenses&#44; or<lb/> in other words a left handed sort of way of <sic>insiting</sic> him<lb/> on to take a look at the animal&#44; without incurring<lb/> any <sic>expence</sic>&#8212;I have not heard if he will come&#44;&#8212;<lb/> whenever I hear this letter of yours spoken of I shall<lb/> take the pains to set you right before the public&#44;<lb/>  It is not a <sic>parrellel</sic> care with <persName>Dr Raphael</persName>.  do not<lb/> let this worry you.  take things <sic>coolly</sic>&#44;&#8212;</p>
				<p>with regard to <persName>Mr Henry</persName> since I wrote you I learned<lb/> that <persName>Rev Ellis Lyons</persName> had recd a letter from <persName>Henry</persName>. Requesting<lb/> <persName>Lyons</persName> to give him the names in full of such persons who<lb/> know any thing about the affair.  <persName>Mr Valentine</persName> tells me<lb/> this and also that they wanted his name which he gave at<lb/> the same time stating that he knew nothing at all about<lb/> the matter.  <persName>Sam Hart Sr</persName> says if they call on him by<lb/> commission.  he knows nothing and if he did know he would<lb/> not say&#8212;as he is not compelled to testify out of the state<lb/> I shall see <persName>Mr Levin</persName> to day and get some particulars about it<lb/> <persName>Mrs Carter</persName> thinks you have done wrong and she uses this<lb/> argument&#44;&#8212;&#8221;If <persName>Mr Henry</persName> &#8220;<hi rend="underline">poor man</hi>&#8221; were not basely slandered<lb/> would he <add>&#63;</add> <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> and have all the particulars before<lb/> the public.  I am sure he is innocent.&#8221;  Now this pretended<lb/> production is only got up to create Sympathy for the</p>
			<pb n="2R"/>
				<p>poor man&#44; &#8220;who came here to sell his books to support his<lb/> family.&#8221;&#8212;the public are not to know that the suit is not<lb/> brought&#44;&#8212;they <sic>learnd</sic> that he intends or has sued you<lb/> which he would <hi rend="underline">not</hi> do if he could <hi rend="underline">not prove</hi> his <hi rend="underline">innocence</hi>&#44;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">When I see <persName>Mr Levin</persName> I will learn the truth about the<lb/> summons.  The Lawyer for <persName>Henry</persName> is also known here.<lb/>  Your friend <persName>Henry Phillips</persName> is the man&#44; this is also to give<lb/> <sic>plausibily</sic> to the report&#8212;now it may be true but I<lb/> do not believe that he will bring suit&#44; and if he does<lb/> not&#8212;where does <persName>Mr Henry</persName> stand&#44; if he is innocent<lb/>  I am sure you will do him justice&#44;</p>
				<p>with regard to yourself you are &#40;being a public man&#41;<lb/> free game for all to shoot at&#59; and at same time you<lb/> have the full privilege to clothe your self in such<lb/> a panoply of virtue that the shafts are turned harmless<lb/> away.  &#8220;For those are hated that <sic>exel</sic> the most<lb/> Altho when dead the are beloved&#44; and blest&#8221;</p>
				<p><date>22d</date> last night I saw <persName>Mr Lyons</persName> and asked him<lb/> if he had been summoned.&#8212;he replied not yet&#8212;that<lb/> he had recd a letter from <persName>Mr Henry</persName> <add>stating that he intended to summon him and</add> requesting him to<lb/> find out who did know any thing about the report&#44; and<lb/> to send him their names in full.  <persName>Mr Lyons</persName> says he does<lb/> not know any thing about it and is very sorry that<lb/> <persName>Mr Henry</persName> wrote to him.  <persName>Mr Henry</persName> states that he intends<lb/> to bring suit against you for defamation&#44; and that he<lb/> has obtained Counsel&#44; but does <hi rend="underline">not</hi> state how&#44; altho<lb/> as I wrote above I heard it was <persName>H.P.</persName>&#8212;<persName>Mr Lyons</persName> can<lb/> send him <hi rend="underline">no</hi> information&#44; so for want of it he will not</p>

				<p>be able to bring suit&#8212;I think this is the last you<lb/> will hear about it&#44; the Gent evidently wanted to create<lb/> a sympathy&#44; for himself in <placeName>Charleston</placeName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">There is a <add>private</add> letter here lately recd from <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName> which<lb/> <hi rend="underline">endorses</hi> all you said and more beside&#8212;I have not seen<lb/> it but <persName>Mr Valentine</persName>&#44; <hi rend="underline">has&#8212;</hi>he told me so.</p>

I notice the arrival of the<lb/> vessels he went out in and dates to <placeName>Asia</placeName> 10 days after<lb/> his arrival but we have recd no letter and<lb/> Dear <persName>Sarah</persName> is very unhappy&#44; if you know<lb/> the real state of his health please let me know<lb/> and <hi rend="underline">enclose it to <persName>Mr Levin</persName> if unfavorable</hi>&#44; as all<lb/> my letters are delivered at my Residence and I<lb/> do not wish my wife to be too suddenly informed of<lb/> any ill news&#44; which I hope there will be no occasion for</p>
