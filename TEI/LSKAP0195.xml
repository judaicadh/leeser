                    <persName>Rev Ellis Lyons</persName> had recd a letter from
                    <persName>Henry</persName>. Requesting<lb/>
                <persName>Lyons</persName> to give him the names in full of such persons who<lb/>
                know any thing about the affair. <persName>Mr Valentine</persName> tells me<lb/>
                this and also that they wanted his name which he gave at<lb/> the same time stating
                that he knew nothing at all about<lb/> the matter. <persName>Sam Hart Sr</persName>
                says if they call on him by<lb/> commission. he knows nothing and if he did know he
                would<lb/> not say—as he is not compelled to testify out of the state<lb/> I shall
                see <persName>Mr Levin</persName> to day and get some particulars about it<lb/>
                <persName>Mrs Carter</persName> thinks you have done wrong and she uses this<lb/>
                argument,—”If <persName>Mr Henry</persName> “<hi rend="underline">poor man</hi>”
                were not basely slandered<lb/> would he <add>?</add>
                <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> and have all the particulars before<lb/> the public.
                I am sure he is innocent.” Now this pretended<lb/> production is only got up to
                create Sympathy for the</p>

            <p>poor man, “who came here to sell his books to support his<lb/> family.”—the public
                are not to know that the suit is not<lb/> brought,—they <sic>learnd</sic> that he
                intends or has sued you<lb/> which he would <hi rend="underline">not</hi> do if he

            <p rend="indent(1)">When I see <persName>Mr Levin</persName> I will learn the truth

            <p><date>22d</date> last night I saw <persName>Mr Lyons</persName> and asked him<lb/> if

                    <persName>Mr Henry</persName>
                <add>stating that he intended to summon him and</add> requesting him to<lb/> find
                out who did know any thing about the report, and<lb/> to send him their names in
                full. <persName>Mr Lyons</persName> says he does<lb/> not know any thing about it
                and is very sorry that<lb/>
                <persName>Mr Henry</persName> wrote to him. <persName>Mr Henry</persName> states
                that he intends<lb/> to bring suit against you for defamation, and that he<lb/> has
                obtained Counsel, but does <hi rend="underline">not</hi> state how, altho<lb/> as I
                wrote above I heard it was <persName>H.P.</persName>—<persName>Mr Lyons</persName>
