                DISCOURSE I. THE VICISSITUDES OF LIFE. Lord of life &#33; to Thee ascends our
                prayer. O Great Father&#33; thy children seek thy favour&#59; they come unto thy
                gracious throne feeling their weak&#8211; ness&#44; humbled because of thy power
                &#33; What are they &#63; they are as the flower that bloometh in the morning and is
                cut off and withereth ere the sun hath set &#59; they flourish awhile like the
                cedars on Lebanon &#59; but soon the blast cometh&#44; and they are thrown down and
                crushed&#44; and their day is ended. But Thou&#44; &#8212; Thou art the everliving
                He&#44; whose days are numberless &#59; whose power never faileth&#44; whose
                happiness knoweth no sorrow. To Thee therefore do we fly whenever calamity reaches
                us&#44; whenever the rumour of sorrow is brought home to our spirit. It is then that
                we feel that in Thee&#44; Father &#33; is our only refuge &#33; that with Thee&#44;
                our God &#33; is our only safety. And so it was vol. v. l &#40; l &#41; <pb n="2"/>
                2 THE VICISSITUDES OF LIFE. in every age. Man progressetb in sin&#44; while the
                prosperity which Thou bestowest smileth on him&#59; he feeleth himself great in his
                own strength&#44; and he hcedeth not thy voice which speaketh to him out of thy holy
                Book&#44; which appeals to him from the thou&#8211; sand works which proclaim Thee
                Creator and King. Yet when the evil entereth his dwelling&#58; O then he feeleth
                himself powerless in thy hand&#44; knoweth then that his prosperity was the gift of
                thy bounty. And Thou receivest in favour the erring mortal&#44; who thus humbleth
                himself in thy presence&#59; Thou openest the chambers of his heart that the
                truth&#44; revealed to him by calamity&#44; may find a permanent abiding in his
                soul&#44; that he may become a worthy servant in thy house&#44; a true worshipper in
                thy sanctuary&#59; in order that his mourning may be turned unto joy&#44; his sorrow
                into the brightness of salvation. Accept therefore also this clay in favour the
                assem&#8211; bling of thy children who have been brought together to call on

                injustice&#44; it would be charging Him with producing innumerable beings for a
                state of misery and endless sorrow&#59; &#8212; for even were the goods of the world
                con&#8211; ferring unalloyed happiness&#44; it would be the few only who would be
                blessed&#44; whilst the many&#44; destined to a life of pain&#44; of labour&#44; of
                poverty&#44; of suffering&#44; of in&#8211; glory&#44; must of necessity be shut out
                from the only happiness thus existing. But no &#33; in God there is no injustice
                &#33; in Him there is no evil &#33; it is man only who is wilfully blind&#44; it is
                he only who turns the bless&#8211; ings given him into destructive poisons. &#8212;
                For let us see whether there be anything absolutely wrong in the ownership of
                wealth&#44; the enjoyments of life&#44; the possession of an honoured name&#44; and
                in ruling over our fellow&#8211;men &#63; Candour and truth will compel us to answer
                that&#44; if properly employed&#44; they are all bless&#8211; ings&#44; and it is
                only the abuse of them and their im&#8211; proper seeking which can become hurtful
                to their possessors&#44; and injurious to others. &#8212; If one has wealth&#44; he
                can live at ease without a constant racking care about the morrow&#59; he can keep
                his children under his own roof&#44; impart unto them good instruction &#59; and
                above all he can hasten to the assistance of those on whom the hand of misfortune
                has heavily fallen. In addition to this&#44; and what is most important to the
                wealthy one himself&#44; he has leisure to devote much time to the state of his
                soul&#44; he can spare many hours for meditation&#44; and endeavour to trace out the
                secret sins that dwell within him&#44; and improve the rebellious heart that draws
                him with the cords of iniquity unto the ways of transgression. What think you will
                be the state of a rich man who thus employs his wealth&#44; <pb n="5"/> THE
                VICISSITUDES OF LIFE. 5 and the leisure it produces&#63; Surely he must be a
                blessing to himself and others&#44; contentment will reign within his soul&#44; and
                many a smile will be lighted up among those who are within his reach&#44; and he
                will be happier than those less favoured&#44; not because that he has wealth&#44;
                but that he has the heart to enjoy it properly&#44; and the will to make it useful
                to others. In such a conduct wealth is not regarded as a something valuable in
                itself&#44; but as a means of happiness&#44; and in its being this&#44; only
                inasmuch as it is employed for purposes in which true wisdom can discover a useful
                and permanent object. &#8212; In other words&#44; the posses&#8211; sion of a
                million of pieces of silver is in itself no hap&#8211; piness&#59; but it may
                promote in the possessor happy and lastingly&#8211;joyful sensations&#44; if he
                employs the su&#8211; perabundance of his means in lightening the heart of the
                sufferer of its sorrow&#44; and in qualifying himself to be just to all men and
                obedient to the will of Heaven. A rich man who has reached this degree of elevation
                will not value himself because that he has more wealth than his neighbour&#59; the
                weight of his gold will not bend him down to earth as the slave of ava&#8211;
                rice&#44; the captive of base worldliness &#59; but he will re&#8211; gard himself
                as the agent of his God&#44; as one who has been appointed to administer a part of
                the blessings sent into the world for the benefit of many&#44; to the injury of
                none. In the same manner must we regard the enjoyment of worldly pleasures. &#8212;
                God has created many things for our use &#59; He has even clothed the earth with a
                beautiful mantle of green and studded it with thou&#8211; sands of brilliant flowers

                ear&#44; and pleasant things are there to gratify the palate. And go where you will
                there are evidences that the Lord created every thing for our earthly enjoyment&#59;
                and there exists nothing that has life&#44; even the minutest animalcule&#44; but it
                has lively emotions of pleasure&#44; and enjoys the existence it has received. But
                how should we en&#8211; joy life &#63; Even as the gift of God&#44; as the thing
                which He has bestowed&#44; as that which He can resume. If now in his fear we enter
                the world&#44; where the table is&#44; so to say&#44; spread before us with all
                manner of dainties springing from the hand of universal Love&#58; how meekly will we
                taste&#44; how piously will we enjoy&#33; Not a flower there is&#44; not a fruit
                does grow&#44; but it affords cause for thankfulness&#59; and the consecration of
                all to the service of God&#44; the returning of our ac&#8211; knowledgment for
                whatever we receive&#44; will throw a holiness around our very pleasures&#44; and
                make the en&#8211; joyment of things of the earth a worship holy unto the Most High
                &#33; To Abraham it was said&#58; &#34;And thou shalt be a blessing&#44;&#34; as a
                commentary upon the preceding words&#44; &#34;and I will make great thy name.&#34;
                And only when a man&#39;s deeds constitute him a blessing to his fellow&#8211;
                beings&#44; can a great name be desired&#59; for then only it is based upon the
                foundation of all goodness&#44; the service of the Lord&#44; who desires that in
                serving Him we should also endeavour to imitate his acts of benevo&#8211; lence
                towards all mankind&#59; and we thus only become great&#44; we only thus deserve an
                honoured name&#44; when we have fulfilled these duties. But if Ave have&#44; then is
                the necessary consequence of such conduct the love and respect of others&#44; and
                therefore these gifts&#44; <pb n="7"/> THE VICISSITUDES OF LIFE. 7 too&#44; are
                within the legitimate bounds to which our desire may&#44; and what is more&#44;
                should extend&#59; not that we should do good to receive praise and renown &#59; but
                that we have a right to look in some measure to the approbation of the wise and the
                good &#59; and their praise is the only thing which is worth obtaining&#44; since
                the approval of the wicked is at times the se&#8211; verest condemnation which our
                conduct can receive. The possession of power by some of its members is necessary for
                the government of society &#59; where all rule equally&#44; where there is no
                restraint&#44; there can be no security&#44; consequently it is requisite that&#44;
                as all cannot govern at once&#44; many must be subjected to the rule of others&#44;
                and this fact obtains in the freest government. To be&#44; then&#44; intrusted with
                power is nothing else than to exercise an authority for the time being&#44; which
                can and ought to be exerted for the benefit of all &#59; consequently there is
                nothiug morally wrong in the possession of power any more than in that of
                wisdom&#44; wealth&#44; and fame. But this too should be held in humility and
                meekness&#44; as a gift from God&#44; who thereby has imposed upon one of his
                servants an additional duty&#44; to be useful in a superior degree to other sons of
                man. This holds good with respect to every office of authority&#44; from the chief
                of a school where children learn their first lessons in the alpha&#8211; bet&#44; up
                to the chief magistrate of a mighty nation &#59; since all should look upon their
                power&#44; not as a sub&#8211; ject for self&#8211;congratulation&#44; as a motive
                for pride&#44; and as an incentive to despise those beneath them &#59; be&#8211;
                cause the authority was not created for the benefit of the individual invested with
                the same&#44; but in order that peace and good&#8211;will may be preserved among <pb

                finds himself temporarily in power&#44; has no right to think himself any better or
                any nearer to immortal happiness&#44; than those who are bound to obey his
                commands&#59; since he himself is a servant of&#44; and subordinate to the same
                eternal Power&#44; by whose sufferance nations rise into being&#44; and princes sit
                securely on their thrones. We thus see that unto those who are truly wise all
                earthly gifts are blessings&#44; inasmuch as by their proper use the glory of God
                and the happiness of man can be promoted in an eminent degree. In addition to these
                natural deductions for the proper regulation of ourselves as drawn from reason&#44;
                it must not be forgotten that we have a far superior guide to direct us safely in
                our pilgrimage&#44; and this&#44; as you all know&#44; is the light of revelation
                &#59; for this shows us that we are commanded to be charitable with our means&#59;
                thankful to Providence for his bounty&#59; to seek a fair name only in the way of
                righteousness&#44; and to em&#8211; ploy our power solely for the good of all under
                our care. With regard to those who are not blessed with a large portion of worldly
                things&#44; we may say&#44; that they can find in their very absence the stimulant
                for the constant activity which the All&#8211;wise designed for man on earth &#59;
                he was created to be continually striv&#8211; ing after perfection&#59; and
                since&#44; as a mixed being&#44; mixed of good and evil&#44; the purely spiritual

                him in the hours of labour. The few words I have used in elucidating&#59; this point
                must have clearly established the perfect justice of the Lord in his government of
                the world&#59; lie se&#8211; lects those&#44; whom from wise purposes He deems the
                most fitting&#44; to be in certain things above the level of the general mass&#44;
                as we have said&#44; for the benefit of the very multitude over which they are
                elevated&#59; and at the same time we ought to reflect that they&#44; who are
                neither wealthy nor otherwise distinguished from the great crowd around them&#44;
                may never desire those things which the wealthy and luxurious deem requisite to
                their well&#8211;being&#44; and that habit may inure them to hardships which give
                them a zest in existence&#44; which the great and the pampered sigh for in vain. AVe
                say therefore that mankind has not been left in darkness &#59; for there is a light
                which leads all&#44; if they will only seek it&#44; and heed it when it is
                found&#59; and that the Lord has done us no wrong by permit&#8211; ting in his
                providence that worldliness should be the natural propensity of the children of the
                dust&#59; since the proper use of earthly goods and the lawful enjoy&#8211; ments of
                the gifts of this perishable state will lead us to the possession of that perfect
                happiness which is the portion of the righteous in the life everlasting. But it is
                man himself who poisons the sources of happiness&#59; the waters of life would flow
                on in a stream dispensing health&#44; scattering blessings&#59; but we ourselves

                themselves&#44; places them above the dictates of religion&#44; esteems them more
                than the favour of his God. Look on yon rich man&#44; his labours have been

                throng his dwelling. But what good results to others from his wealth &#63; where are

                and snatch from them the cup of pleasure&#44; blot out the name which is so
                hon&#8211; oured&#44; and strike down the power which has been so much dreaded&#59;
                and then will lie low the hearts that felt themselves so elated&#44; so pleased&#44;
                so dreaded &#59; and another generation will arise and heap odium and scorn on the
                memory of the men who knew not God in their pleasures&#44; who feared not their
                Maker in the acquisition of renown&#44; and who perchance oppressed their
                fellow&#8211;men in the days of their power. But the glory of man endures but for a

                best chequered with anxieties&#44; with sorrows&#44; with disease. The cup of
                life&#44; except to the humble and pious&#44; and they too have not rarely to feel
                their mortality&#44; is mingled often and often with the bitterness of worm&#8211;

                the truth&#44; would pity those whom they think so enviable for the greatness which
                the world accords to them. And it is solely by placing a firm reliance on our
                heavenly Father&#44; by convincing ourselves that what&#8211; ever is is right&#44;

                themselves in our varied career&#44; and this only can save us from despair&#44; and
                teach us to submit to the decrees of infinite Justice with meek&#8211; ness and
                resignation. And&#44; believe me&#44; where this feeling predominates&#44; there w T

                clouds of discontent will vanish&#44; and the rays of heavenly light will again
                illumine the chambers of the anxious and troubled bosom. Yet the majority of mankind
                have not this wis&#8211; dom. For they hasten along as though their days were to
                last for ever&#44; as though their joy were never dying. They live on the brink of a
                smoking vol&#8211; cano &#58; yet they build houses and plant vineyards&#44; and
                vainly imagine that the foundations of those will never be moved&#44; and the
                greenness of the last be never fading. In their houses resound the tones of music
                and the voices of song&#59; the giddy dance re&#8211; echoes through their lofty
                halls&#44; their tables groan under the weight of viands and the bread of delight.
                Death with his grim terrors is far&#44; far&#44; removed from their eyes&#44; and

                then should we do&#63; how should we he wise &#63; Even as the word of God teaches
                us&#44; in the midst of joy we should rememher our mortality&#44; in the midst of
                business occupation we should reflect that we have something more to toil for than
                these perishable limbs&#59; that our soul&#44; the nobler part of ourselves&#44;
                needs purification ere she can enter the kingdom of heaven&#44; for which she is
                destined as her everlasting dwelling. For when the body has flourished like the
                grass in the morning&#44; and been cut down before the evening&#44; our spirit does
                not perish&#59; but it will bloom in immortal glory&#44; if we have only enriched it
                with deeds of righteousness and mercy&#44; as demanded by our God. We have many

                instance to prove the vanity of every thing under the sun to which the heart is

                suddenness and extent&#44; than that which&#44; a few months back&#44; over&#8211;
                whelmed some of the fairest portions of the West India Islands&#44; countries

                perfumes&#44; where all that can enchant the eye is ever flourishing&#44; and where
                nature is decked in her gaudiest attire. There is&#44; or rather&#44; there was&#44;
                among others&#44; one town where commerce had centred&#44; where luxury and art had
                found a home&#44; it was famed for the beauty of its dwellings&#44; and known as the
                most agreeable of <pb n="15"/> THE VICISSITUDES OF LIFE. 15 its sister cities.
                &#8212; Did the inhabitants dread the com&#8211; ing destruction &#63; no&#44;
                they&#44; like we do now in our own city&#44; thought their houses stood firm&#44;
                their for&#8211; tunes were secured. But the evil was near&#59; and suddenly the
                firm earth commenced to rock beneath their feet&#44; and it heaved like the surface
                of the treacherous ocean&#44; and in an instant of time the town of
                Point&#8211;a&#8211;Pitre was a heap of ruins&#44; and thousands of human beings
                were slain among the wrecks of fallen houses&#44; and thousands of others lay
                embedded under the weight of crushed beams and loosened walls&#44; in possession of
                life&#44; yet unable to extricate themselves from their living sepulchre. In the
                midst of all this terror&#44; before the hand of help could reach them&#44; many of
                the ruins suddenly blazed forth a prey to fire&#44; and this new element of
                destruction strode along in its march of fury&#44; and overthrew what the earthquake
                had spared. O&#44; vain were the shrieks of the wounded&#44; without avail the
                groans of the dying&#59; human aid stood aghast before the arm that was out&#8211;
                stretched&#44; until the ruin of so much wealth&#44; pleasant&#8211; ness&#44; and
                skill was consummated. Perhaps ten thou&#8211; sand human beings like ourselves fell
                a sacrifice to an awful death or were maimed for life&#44; and the sur&#8211; vivors
                are left without the means of support&#44; bereft of all the fruits of their labour
                and industry. Their very soil has become a ruin &#59; hills have been thrown
                down&#44; their springs of water have disappeared&#44; and fountains of muddy
                boiling water have taken their places. So suddenly&#44; so fearfully&#44; did all
                this take place&#44; that the witnesses themselves could hardly re&#8211; alize what
                they themselves had seen and suffered&#59; and now in their distress they stretch

                those who have assembled here this day for the same benevolent purpose will not go
                away before they have amply proved that their heart can sympathize for
                sufferers&#44; though they are not of the same creed and country. This is a
                beautiful trait in genuine charity&#59; she only hears that there is suffering&#44;
                and she is moved by the appeal &#59; her heart at once re&#8211; sponds to the tears
                she sees glistening in the eyes of the distressed&#44; and she asks not who they are
                &#63; but at once devises means of relief&#44; and is blessed herself whilst

                purposed to give unto his people Israel law and judgment&#44; He sent Ms chosen
                servant unto them to prepare them for this contemplated great event. He had been
                their Benefactor&#59; He had broken their chains&#59; He had opened the yoke from
                    <pb n="20"/> 20 THE ETERNITY OF THE COVENANT. off their neck&#59; He had guided
                them safely through the divided waters of the Red Sea&#44; unharmed by their
                vengeful pursuers&#58; yet lie would not demand of them an unwilling compliance with
                his commandments&#59; He came hut to instruct&#44; to persuade&#44; to induce&#59;
                and He therefore sought first their voluntary compliance. We may freely say&#44;
                that the law would not have been given to the Israelites&#44; if they had declared
                them&#8211; selves unwilling to receive it&#59; some other nation would in that case
                have been educated for this glori&#8211; ous bequest&#59; or perhaps some
                individual&#44; like Moses&#44; might have received the heavenly legacy to transmit
                it to a numerous posterity&#44; whom a wise Providence might have especially called
                into being. Some such a procedure would have received the sanction of di&#8211; vine
                Wisdom&#44; and been executed by divine Power&#59; for it was necessary that the
                heaven&#8211;born religiou promulgated through Moses should become the stand&#8211;
                ard of right for all men. But the Israelites then felt no hesitation&#44; they were
                deeply convinced of the great&#8211; ness of their Redeemer&#44; of his power&#44;
                his goodness&#44; and his wisdom&#44; and they were but too happy to be enabled by
                his gracious permission to unite them&#8211; selves to Him by the indissoluble ties
                of kindred and love&#59; kindred&#44; I say T &#44; &#8212; for by the acceptance of
                the Torah they became the immediate children of the great Father. He became more
                intimately than to any other people&#44; God&#44; King&#44; Redeemer&#44;
                Saviour&#59; and also by the ties of love&#59; for the bestowal of all the grace
                which the Lord had promised them&#44; and also fulfilled in many memorable
                instances&#44; on many an eventful occasion&#44; had necessarily the tendency of
                converting the adoration due to the Supreme&#44; because <pb n="21"/> THE ETERNITY

                hear&#8211; ing of the people&#44; and they said&#44; All which the Lord hath spoken
                we will do and obey.&#34; What was the pledge the people here gave&#63; It was this
                &#58; they had hitherto not been bound by the divine law&#59; they had worshipped
                idols&#59; they had kept no day of rest&#59; they had not abstained from aught that
                lives which cheweth not the cud nor divideth the hoof among four&#8211;footed
                animals&#44; and of creatures of the sea which have no fins and scales &#59; nor had
                they abstained from incest&#44; misled to this by the example of their masters. But
                now a new life was henceforth to distinguish them. No more were they to bow down
                before idols of gold and of silver&#44; the creatures of their own diseased
                fancy&#44; or the beautiful star of day&#44; the luminary of the night&#44; or the
                hosts of the brilliant constellations which cheer nightly the dark blue vault of
                heaven. They were ordered to with&#8211; hold their foot from travel on the seventh
                day of every weeK&#44; to cease from work&#44; and not even to speak of their plans
                of labour and arrangements of their every&#8211; day business&#44; inasmuch as it
                was a day holy to them no less than their God&#44; a sign that the Lord is the <pb

                was chosen as his own peculiar people&#44; for the end that his Name might be
                sanctified on earth by the children of the dust&#44; as it is glorified among the
                ministering hosts of the pure spirits that stand at the foot of the throne of
                grace&#44; adoring the Infinite&#44; the Holy&#44; who to their view also is
                hidden&#44; too elevated for their conception&#44; too mys&#8211; terious for their
                knowledge to realize the extent of his mighty essence. &#8212; In their domestic
                life likewise a distinction should be made between them and the nations&#59;
                whatever the law declared unclean should be to them an abomination&#59; they should
                distinguish between the animal which may be eaten and that which may not be
                eaten&#59; not from any inherent unclean&#8211; ness in the nature of the thing
                itself&#44; but simply be&#8211; cause it was so decreed in the book of the
                covenant. So also was their moral life to be on an elevation far above that of their
                former masters. The affections&#44; even those most powerfully inherent in our
                natures&#44; should be regulated by the will of God&#59; and no heart should beat
                with fond desire for all those&#44; whom the law designated as prohibited from
                causes of consan&#8211; guinity&#44; or the other reasons handed down to us. &#8212;
                In short&#44; the whole tenor of life was to be a system of restraints based upon
                the promulgation of those divine decrees&#44; in which no human agency had any
                influence to direct&#44; advise&#44; or control &#59; but which all sprung from the
                creative wisdom of the all&#8211;wise Creator. It was this law to which the
                Israelites vowed a will&#8211; ing fidelity&#44; it was this code which they
                promised to execute as their part of the covenant. The Almighty had announced to
                them that they should be to Him <pb n="23"/> THE ETERNITY OF THE COVENANT. 23 a
                clearly beloved people if they would obey his will&#59; nay more&#44; He covenanted

                should never be broken&#59; that whether they were sinning or righteous his
                protection should never be withdrawn &#59; that whether united or divided&#44;
                whether rulers of the world or captives within the stranger&#39;s land they should
                never be cut off entirely&#44; or their nation vanish from amidst the families of
                mankind. We here see before us the two parties to the most solemn compact which the

                gulf of destruction &#59; and when we were led away by the sinful desires of our
                hearts to forsake the law&#44; our erring steps were ar&#8211; rested by the timely
                correction which admonished us that there is a judging God who takes cognizance of

                must be the glory of Israel for having proved themselves worthy guardians of the
                precious treasure&#44; which Divine Providence placed in their hands as a deposit
                for the ultimate benefit of the whole family of Adam&#39;s progeny. Indeed there
                have been dark times in the history of our people. There were periods&#44; when a
                wrathful enemy walked in his triumph over the ruins of cities&#44; over
                broken&#8211;down walls&#44; and shouted when the dwell&#8211; ing of the Lord of
                glory blazed forth with lurid flames&#44; when destruction seemed to have perched
                with her pinions of darkness over the land that once was bright&#44; and lay
                reposiug in magnificence and splendour under the brilliant rays of a rising sun
                gilding and gladdening all&#44; as he sped upwards in his mission to illumine and
                warm the face of the earth. Ay&#44; these were indeed dark moments&#59; other
                nations would have despaired&#44; have seized the false hand of the conqueror held
                out to them in deceitful friendship&#44; and embraced the idols which were offered
                to their unwilling arms. But not so acted Israel &#59; much they had sinned in
                prosperity&#44; grievously had they offend&#8211; ed when peace dwelt within their
                tents&#59; but when the bitter cup of adversity was presented to their lips&#44; to
                be drained with its lees&#44; if they would not forsake the covenant&#44; they
                drained the brimming bowl of con&#8211; fusion&#44; and turned their ardent gaze to
                their God and his promises&#59; and whilst yet the prostrate ruins of the temple
                smoked and blazed upwards&#44; they already took comfort in a hopeful resurrection
                &#59; they saw their brethren slain by hundreds&#44; cast naked before a troup of
                enraged lions&#44; sold by ship&#8211;loads in hope&#8211; less slavery &#58; yet
                they felt themselves not cast off&#44; and <pb n="27"/> THE ETERNITY OF THE

                &#59;&#34; and they beheld those sent forth into slavery returning to Zion with
                immortal glory on their heads&#44; crowned with joy and salvation &#59; for they
                were as&#8211; sured that happen what would&#44; be the end speedily approaching or
                far distant&#44; buried deep in the re&#8211; cesses of time&#44; come it must&#44;
                and the redeemer would appear unto those who return from transgression in Jacob&#44;

                built up&#44; and the palaces that are pulled down be restored. How the soul warms
                at a contemplation of so much faith &#33; of such simple&#8211;minded devotion in
                the truth of God &#33; It is spirit&#8211;stirring to be one of such a race&#44; of
                a people so steadfast&#44; so devoted&#44; amidst all trials&#44; amidst all the
                sufferings which have passed over Abraham&#39;s race&#59; and well may the gentile
                pardon us&#44; when we reject his proffered fellowship&#44; when we perseveringly
                uphold our connexions with the war&#8211; riors and the martyrs who fought the godly
                battle&#44; who met willingly a beautiful death&#44; more full of re&#8211; nown
                than that of the expiring conqueror on the field where he subjugated an entire
                world. &#8212; Yes&#44; brethren &#33; this faith has stood our defence for
                generation and generation &#59; and amidst every trouble up to our own days&#44; it
                has been the custom of our nation to look upon itself as destined to be restored to
                and united in the land of Israel&#44; to see the worship of the Most High reinstated
                on the hill of Moriah in all the an&#8211; cient splendour which characterized it of

                which the word of God has predicted for it. Whatever suffering then came to our
                lot&#44; was considered a preparation for a more hope&#8211; ful future&#59;
                whatever joy was meted out to us&#44; was a foretaste of yet happier days in the
                land of our own heritage. So it was for many centuries&#44; and in every
                circumstance of our people&#44; whether they were fear&#8211; fully oppressed for
                the sake of their religion&#44; or were held in high estimation by their
                countrymen&#44; and be&#8211; came the advisers&#44; the physicians&#44; or bankers
                of sov&#8211; ereigns and pontiffs&#59; they always looked upon the scattered state
                of their nation not as a matter of indif&#8211; ference to every individual&#44; but
                as an incentive to hope for a reunion at some future day of the divided members of
                the house of Jacob&#44; at a time when&#44; un&#8211; der the universal rule of the
                peaceful son of David&#44; there shall prevail tranquillity on earth&#44; and our
                Mes&#8211; siah be viewed by all men as the messenger of the God of love and mercy.
                This universal hope of the Jews does not in the least militate against their
                attachment to the country of their birth or that of their abode. The hope of the
                Jews for independence&#44; both national and religious&#44; does not in the least
                impair their obligation to obey the laws of their country&#44; and to use every
                lawful means for its defence and support. For whilst we are in captivity our
                fortunes are bound up with those of our countrymen&#44; and he is no true son of
                Israel who hates others for the sake of their belief&#44; or who wishes to establish
                his own advantage to the injury of his neighbours&#44; be their creed what it may.
                &#8212; It is not therefore from a feeling of bad citizenship that our hopes of a
                restoration to Palestine do spring&#44; it is not <pb n="29"/> THE ETERNITY OF THE
                COVENANT. 29 from bigotry that we ask of the Lord&#44; that He may in mercy remember
                Zion&#44; and re&#8211;establish there his worship as of old&#44; and restore his
                holy temple on its ancient foundation. And let no one think&#44; that this is an
                idle thing to pray for&#59; inasmuch as the Lord must have some great end in view
                for which He has preserved our people during all their wanderings&#59; and since He
                thought it of sufficient moment to re&#8211; deem us in olden days&#44; and to unite
                us as one people by the bestowal of a uniform law which should be the same for all
                its individuals&#44; from the highest to the lowest &#58; surely it is but arguing
                according to his in&#8211; finite wisdom to presume&#44; that what He established
                then&#44; He meant to endure for everlasting. Now it is well known&#44; that the
                union of our nation was severed at the division of the first kingdom of Israel&#44;
                say at the commencement of the reign of Rehoboam&#44; or at latest when Shalmenesser
                led away captive the ten tribes forming the division of Israel proper. But can it be
                supposed that the Lord was so short&#8211;sighted as to institute a union which was
                no union &#63; surely to argue thus would be assuming an absurdity&#59; if even we
                had not the writings of the prophets to as&#8211; sure us of the positive promises
                of God&#44; which we know from analogy to be true and sure of a future fulfilment.
                We therefore are warranted in looking forward to a complete mingling together of all
                the discordant elements which now constitute the house&#8211; hold of Jacob&#44; at
                a time and in a manner which the wisdom of the Lord will choose. Strong in this hope
                of a true fulfilment of God&#39;s covenant&#44; of a recompense for faithful
                adherence to the truth&#44; have the Israelites withstood for ages every 3* <pb

                without&#44; and have been upheld in their noble resistance by that grace from above
                which accompanies always those who humbly seek the truth. So well have they who
                sought to destroy our nationality been aware of the unshaken prop this hope gives to
                the Jew&#44; that they have essayed everything to persuade him to believe in an
                alleged fulfilment of his hope&#44; or have endeavoured to induce him to yield it as
                a matter of no moment. Through the blessing of the Guardian of Israel it has
                happened&#44; that the torrents of blood which have been shed by the persecutors

                their back&#44; and fled from our ranks&#44; and joined the forces of the
                oppressors&#44; have not diminished mate&#8211; rially the devoted bands who stand
                yet ready to watch in silent expectation &#34; till cometh the day of the Lord&#44;
                the great and fearful.&#34; And we need not fear that there ever will be a time&#44;
                when Israel will be traitors to the hope of the salvation and the kingdom of their
                own adored Unity. Still there are men among us&#44; if men I dare call them&#44;
                persons who are teachers in Israel&#44; but who unworthily fill the seat of
                honour&#44; who have discovered that the Jew who enjoys civil liberty need not to
                pray for a restoration of the house of Israel as one &#59; who fancy&#44; that the
                bodily reign of the king Messiah is a problematic matter&#44; on which persons are
                at liberty to speculate as upon other mat&#8211; ters of doubt and uncertainty.

                city&#44; at least in several others&#59; and well&#8211;nigh they threaten to break
                up the harmony which our people have always had among them by a uniform rule of
                interpreting the received covenant of God. It is true these men profess veneration
                for the ancient faith &#59; they however entertain a wish to reform many an
                ob&#8211; servance&#44; and to alter at pleasure the rules which have governed our
                places of worship for ages before the destruction of the second temple. Without
                en&#8211; tering at present into a detailed argument on the subject&#44; and to
                point out which things are really of importance&#44; and which merely customs of no
                moment in our forms &#58; we will merely lay down the univer&#8211; sally
                acknowledged rule&#44; that the uniform practice of the Israelites is binding upon
                the whole community&#44; unless it could be proved that its institution is
                con&#8211; trary to the law of Moses. In our clay&#44; we say it boldly&#44; there
                is nothing to abridge &#58; people have un&#8211; fortunately already of their own
                accord left off many an observance legitimate and within the meaning of the letter
                of the law. How religion is to be reformed upon such a basis&#44; exceeds my power
                of understand&#8211; ing&#59; in place of retrenching&#44; it ought to become the
                duty and study of teachers of religion to exhort the people to become stricter
                observants&#44; and to approach more closely to the former standard of a religious
                life prevalent among us. Moreover&#44; what was once uni&#8211; versally

                branch of domestic and public life&#44; to judge of the propriety or impropriety of
                any observance &#59; or else we should soon behold the melancholy spectacle of as
                many reforms as there are Jewish congrega&#8211; tions in the world. Above all
                things the doctrines of the church of God&#44; the creed as deduced by our wise men
                from the law&#44; are so to say&#44; clauses of the inward covenant&#44; which we
                have promised to observe and to obey&#59; consequently every one teaching
                some&#8211; thing in opposition thereto must be regarded as a traitor to the holy
                cause&#44; which is no less that of all Israel conjointly&#44; and every one of its
                individuals&#44; than that of the Lord&#39;s own covenant. Whoever is then tinctured
                with any heresy on these important points&#44; who doubts and expresses his opinions
                of the untruth of any of the fundamental principles&#44; cannot&#44; and of right
                should not&#44; be received as a legitimate teacher for Israelites&#59; and whatever
                may be alleged against the unenlightened zeal of old&#8211;fashioned Jews&#44; they
                are much safer guides&#44; as regards morals no less than doctrines and laws&#44;
                than those of a modern date who endeavour to place our religion upon a footing which
                should approach nearer the standard of gentile wor&#8211; ship&#44; and be more
                sightly to the eye of those who do not thoroughly understand the principles on which
                our customs are founded. In short&#44; we must be very careful how we listen to
                arguments&#44; which could by any contingency break up the oneness of Israel&#44;
                which should cause our oppo&#8211; nents to rejoice at seeing those divisions among
                us which have for ages been witnessed among themselves. <pb n="33"/> THE ETERNITY OF

                attainable&#44; it perhaps never existed&#44; and was&#44; it is possible&#44; never
                designed to exist. But we should not let this consideration permit ourselves to
                branch off into the field of that sort of free inquiry&#44; which finds every thing
                ancient stupid&#44; and every new&#8211;fangled no&#8211; tion of a high degree of
                usefulness and beauty. The moderns&#44; no doubt&#44; hasve a vast superiority over
                the learned of former ages in the accessibility to a mass of information&#44; which
                was to them a sealed book&#44; or rather a prohibited region which they were not
                per&#8211; mitted to approach. Nevertheless&#44; this does not ele&#8211; vate the
                learned of our own day to the level of the prophets&#44; to whom&#44; on several
                occasions&#44; it was grant&#8211; ed to permit certain acts&#44; unlawful at
                others&#44; but never to abrogate permanently any institution of biblical
                origin&#44; much less a fundamental doctrine of our be&#8211; lief. &#8212; I will
                not say that there is not room for a few wholesome regulations of our places of
                worship&#44; the abolishment of abuses which all deplore&#44; the establish&#8211;
                ment of a regularity and the enforcement of a deco&#8211; rum which all pious
                Israelites desire. But these are regulations merely&#44; and ask for no change of

                book as it is&#44; and as it has been in use for many cen&#8211; turies. &#8212; Let
                us then be cautious&#44; how we listen to any overtures for changes which we
                might&#44; nay would deplore&#44; as soon as they are introduced&#44; and let us
                unite as one man&#44; to defend our faith just as we have received it&#44; and
                exhort each other to fulfil the terms of the covenant&#44; and to obey strictly all
                the words of the law. This is a reform of which we stand much in need&#44; this is a

                notions of reform&#44; as have their birth in some sickly brain&#44; perhaps more
                ambitious than wise. Yes&#44; brethren &#33; listen to the voice of ages which has
                spoken peace to Israel&#44; which has preserved us when every thing else fell into
                hopeless decay. You&#44; who are wise in your humility&#44; hearken to the words of
                instruction which the ancients of our race have spoken to us&#44; and be
                convinced&#44; that if they have erred&#44; as all men must err&#44; they erred out

                Isaiah&#44; in his fortieth chapter&#44; thus announces the consolation of Israel
                &#58; &#34; Comfort ye&#44; comfort ye&#44; my people&#44; will say your God. Speak
                consolation unto the heart of Jerusalem&#44; and call unto her&#44; that her
                appointed time is fulfilled&#44; that her iniquity is atoned for &#59; because she
                hath received from the hand of the Lord twofold for all her sins.&#34; Let us
                endeavour to trace out the probable mean&#8211; ing of the prophet laid down in
                these words. In every discussion it is first requisite to find out the persons of
                whom the discourse treats&#44; and&#44; secondly&#44; what it is that is
                announced&#59; since it is evident that&#44; if we do not know of whom and of what
                we speak&#44; we can never arrive at a satisfactory and intelligible understanding
                on any subject. &#8212; Isaiah was&#44; as we all know&#44; an Israelite&#44; living
                in a community of Israelites &#59; his residence was at Jerusalem&#44; near the
                palace of the kings of Juclah&#44; in whose times he lived. He wor&#8211; shipped
                and spoke in the name of the everlasting God&#44; the acknowledged Divinity of
                Israel &#8212; He who was&#44; who is&#44; and who will be&#44; and announced his
                message in conformity to the law which was looked upon as the code delivered unto
                his compatriots as a special gift of Heaven. When the prophet now says&#44; &#34;
                Comfort ye&#44; my people&#44;&#34; he speaks as the mes&#8211; <pb n="37"/>
                CONSOLATION OF ISRAEL. 37 senger of the God whom we just mentioned&#44; that some
                persons&#44; be they who they may&#44; are to speak words of comfort to the people
                of whom the prophet himself was one&#59; since these only can be understood from the
                context under the term &#34;My people&#44;&#34; that is&#44; the people of God. But
                to avoid any confusion or misunderstanding of the idea&#44; he enlarges and
                ampli&#8211; fies the preceding word &#34; people&#44;&#34; by adding&#44; u Speak
                consolation unto the heart of Jerusalem.&#34; Now&#44; where was Jerusalem&#63;
                evidently in Palestine. What is likely to be personified by it&#44; since the
                prophet did naturally not mean so many streets and houses com&#8211; posing a
                city&#63; evidently the persons who lived within those streets and houses composing
                the outward Jer&#8211; usalem. Who&#44; again&#44; were they who lived in these
                streets and houses when Isaiah spoke &#63; the descend&#8211; ants of Jacob whom the
                Lord had called Israel and Yeshurun&#44; a people yet in existence at this very
                day&#44; under the name of Jews&#44; Israelites&#44; or Hebrews. If Isaiah had meant
                to convey any other nation&#44; he would have defined it by some other name than
                Jerusalem&#44; for fear of being misunderstood &#59; but in this instance the
                prophecy appears so distinct&#44; so free from ambiguity&#44; that a common sense
                view can only detect the people spoken of among the inhabitants of the actual
                Jerusalem in the days of the prophet&#44; who were&#44; as all the world knows&#44;
                no other than the predecessors of the modern Jews. &#8212; We know well enough that
                persons who are not descended from the stock of Israel have alleged&#44; that the
                text alludes to a spiritual Jerusalem&#44; and a spiritual people of God&#59; but
                with all their ingenuity they must at last admit&#44; that &#34; my people &#34; is

                to be explained by the same holy stand&#8211; ard&#44; low&#44; let us turn to some
                texts anterior to Isaiah. It was said to Abram &#40;Gen. xii. 2&#41; &#58; &#34; And
                I will make thee a great nation&#44; and I will bless thee&#44; and make great thy
                name&#44; and thou shalt be a blessing.&#34; Here a nation is spoken of&#44; through
                the existence of which Abram&#44; as he was then called&#44; should become a
                bless&#8211; ing to all the families of the earth. And when Abram was yet
                childless&#44; at an advanced age&#44; we read &#40;Ibid. xv. 2&#8211;4&#41; &#58;
                &#34; And Abram said&#44; Lord God&#44; what wilt Thou give me&#44; seeing I go
                childless&#44; and the steward of my house is Eliezer of Damascus &#63; And Abram
                said&#44; Behold&#44; to me Thou hast given no seed&#44; and&#44; lo&#44; one born
                in my house is my heir. And&#44; behold&#44; the word of the Lord came unto him&#44;
                saying&#44; This one shall not be thy heir &#59; but he that shall come forth out of
                thy own bowels shall be thy heir.&#34; Again&#44; on an&#8211; other occasion
                &#40;Ibid. xvii. 21&#41; &#58; &#34; But my covenant I will establish with
                Isaac&#44; whom Sarah shall bear unto thee at this time in the next year.&#34;
                &#40;Ibid. xxi. 12&#41; &#58; &#34; For in Isaac shall thy seed be called.&#34; To
                Isaac it was said &#40;Ibid. xxvi. 3&#44; 4&#41; &#58; &#34; Sojourn in this
                land&#44; and I will be with thee and bless thee &#59; for unto thee and unto thy
                seed I will give all these countries&#44; and I will fulfil the oath which I swore
                unto Abraham&#44; thy father&#59; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth

                there make of thee a great nation.&#34; So far as regards predictions to the three
                great ancestors of the Jewish ra e. First Abraham&#44; he had several sons &#59;
                still the great nation was to be only from Isaac. Next Isaac&#44; he had two sons
                &#59; yet the blessing of Abraham was only conferred on Jacob. And lastly&#44; Jacob
                was promised that all his family should be equally included in the peculiar
                protection of the Deity&#44; and that all should be a blessing to the nations of the
                earth. &#8212; If we now descend to later times&#44; we shall have some more
                elucidation of the term &#34; my people.&#34; We read in Exodus iii. 6&#44; when the
                Lord sent Moses on his first mission &#58; &#34; Moreover&#44; He said&#44; I am the
                God of thy father&#44; the God of Abra&#8211; ham&#44; the God of Isaac&#44; and the
                God of Jacob.&#34; And continues in v. 7 &#58; &#34; I have surely seen the
                affliction of my people that are in Egypt&#44; and have heard their cry by reason of
                their task&#8211;masters.&#34; As if this were not enough&#44; Moses was soon after
                told &#40;Ibid. iv. 22&#44; 23&#41;&#58; &#34;And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh&#44;
                Thus saith the Lord&#44; Israel is my son&#44; my first born &#59; and I have said
                unto thee&#44; Let my son go that he may serve me &#59; <pb n="40"/> 40 CONSOLATION
                OF ISRAEL. and if thou refusest to let him go&#44; behold I will slay thy first born
                son.&#34; Again &#40;Ibid. vi. 7&#41; &#58; &#34; And I will take you to me for a
                people&#44; and I will be your God.&#34; Ibid. vii. 4 &#58; &#34; But Pharaoh will
                not hearken unto you&#44; and I will lay my hand on Egypt&#44; and bring forth my
                armies&#44; my people&#44; the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by means
                of great judgments.&#34; When the redemption here indicated had been
                accomplished&#44; and God wished to manifest his glory&#44; He sent the following
                promise to the people of Israel&#58; &#34;And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of
                priests and a holy nation.&#34; And when they had sinned and worshipped an idol
                instead of the eternal Glory&#44; we nevertheless read &#40;Ibid&#44; xxxii. 14&#41;
                &#58; &#34; And the Lord bethought himself of the evil which He had thought to do
                unto his people.&#34; We could multiply texts to exhibit be&#8211; yond the remotest
                doubt that throughout the Bible the same class of persons is designated by the terms
                &#34; my people&#44;&#34; &#34; God&#39;s children&#44;&#34; as by the other
                terms&#44; &#34; sons of Israel&#44;&#34; &#34; children of Jacob&#44;&#34; &#34;
                Yes&#8211; hurun&#44;&#34; &#34;the children of Abraham&#44;&#34; &#34;the seed of
                Abraham&#44; Isaac&#44; and Jacob.&#34; In interpreting&#44; there&#8211; fore&#44;
                any passage in which any of these or similar terms are found&#44; we must be
                convinced from the uniformity of the language of Scripture&#44; that the bodily
                descendants of Israel are understood&#44; and if the event spoken of be one which
                was to happen to those who were to come after the speaker&#39;s immediate time&#44;
                we must conclude farther that the prophets&#44; or the writers of the
                predictions&#44; looked forward to lineal descendants from their own contemporary
                Israelites&#44; who were then designated also as the inhabitants of Judah and
                Jerusalem&#44; these being respectively the <pb n="41"/> CONSOLATION OF ISRAEL. 41
                names of the country and the capital where these people lived and dwelt. To
                understand by Jerusalem in the same manner any thing else than the veritable capital
                of Palestine&#44; would suppose that there were a standard of explanation different
                from what the con&#8211; temporaries of the prophets possessed. Yet if we search the
                whole Scriptures&#44; we shall not discover a single trace that the people who
                inhabited Jerusalem ever dreamed that its name imported any thing be&#8211; yond
                their own beautiful city&#44; and when&#44; therefore&#44; something was asserted of
                this name&#44; they naturally could apply it only to the streets and houses which
                composed their chief city&#44; or metaphorically to its in&#8211; habitants and
                their descendants. In this connexion permit me to call your attention to the
                unfairness of the translators of the Bible in the English language in placing
                headings over the chap&#8211; ters and pages which are not warranted by the
                con&#8211; text. Independently of occasional erroneous views of the text which were
                transfused honestly&#44; we will admit&#44; into their version&#44; though it is
                singular enough that these errors usually occur where some peculiar doctrine is to
                be favoured &#58; the learned divines who furnished us with what is styled the
                common English version undertook&#44; without the remotest shadow of right&#44; to
                place headings&#44; as they are called&#44; over the commencement of every chapter
                in the whole Scrip&#8211; tures&#44; which the uninformed are but too apt to take
                for a translation of a part of the original. Now&#44; the first inspection of the
                Hebrew Bible presents no super&#8211; scriptions of the chapters and pages&#44; and
                this should then satisfy us that the whole of these annotations are without any&#44;
                even the smallest authority. Yet it is 4* <pb n="42"/> 42 CONSOLATION OF ISRAEL. but
                too true that many an error has been fostered and called into life these arbitrary
                annotations of the English translators&#44; who&#44; for reasons best known to
                themselves&#44; endeavoured to make it appear that the Bible furnished evidence&#44;
                of one sort or another&#44; for their peculiar religious views. And when any one
                denies the deduction which the Nazarene world draws from the Bible&#44; because the
                words of Scripture do not say what is alleged of them &#58; he is referred to the
                headings&#44; which clearly point out the forced construc&#8211; tion. Were it that
                all our people&#44; men&#44; women&#44; and children&#44; could read the word of God
                in its original text&#44; this evil would be of small moment &#59; but unfor&#8211;
                tunately there are thousands who have no knowledge of religion except what they
                obtain through means of translations furnished by gentiles&#44; a knowledge highly
                valuable in itself&#44; and in the absence of more accurate information&#44;
                ardently to be desired &#58; still it may become cause of error&#44; because people
                so situated have no means of knowing what is purely scriptural and what is not. A
                translation conducted through&#8211; out by Jews&#44; honest and unbiassed in favour
                of one unscriptural system or the other&#44; might in a measure remedy the evil
                &#58; yet even here there would be room for error&#44; a defect to which our best
                intended endeav&#8211; ours are constantly exposed. But now no such Jew&#8211; ish
                Bible in the English language does exist&#44; though it is to be hoped this evil
                will not be always a re&#8211; proach to us &#59; yet whilst it exists we must not
                omit to caution the unwary against the poison which they may insensibly imbibe from
                a work&#44; which ought to present nothing but the unadulterated word of God. Let it
                then be understood that no notes&#44; marginal <pb n="43"/> CONSOLATION OF ISRAEL.
                43 references&#44; or head&#8211;lines&#44; are part and parcel of Scrip&#8211;
                ture&#44; but merely the additions of uninspired men&#44; which may or may not be
                true&#44; and can have&#44; there&#8211; fore&#44; no farther authority than what
                probability or the context gives them. When we now inspect an English Bible with its
                notes and headings&#44; it is quite an argument not only in favour of the truth of
                Naza&#8211; rene doctrines in general&#44; but also of one or more pecu&#8211; liar
                sects in particular&#44; for no other reason than that the translators belonged to
                these divisions&#44; and found it convenient to give strength to their received
                notions by the aid of forced constructions. We are not going to enter this day upon
                a review of the. English Bible &#59; but merely to state general facts&#44; and we
                will rest the proof of what we have advanced upon the general no&#8211; toriety of
                its truth. But if we discard the superfluous human additions to the Word&#44; even
                taking the trans&#8211; lation as it stands&#44; the unbiassed reader will not find
                the support in favour of doctrines opposed to Judaism for which a biblical warrant
                is so largely claimed&#59; since the words themselves&#44; as they read in the
                translation&#44; do not bear the construction which a forced applica&#8211;
                tion&#44; such as is presented in the various notes and comments&#44; has given to
                them. What I have just been saying may appear tiresome and irrelevant to our
                subject&#59; but you will see the propriety&#44; nay&#44; the necessity thereof&#44;
                if you merely take in your hands the common version&#44; and see the heading upon
                any Bible text&#44; and especially upon the one we have taken for to&#8211;day&#39;s
                discussion. The head&#8211; ing is in these words &#58; &#34; 1. The promulgation of
                the gospel. 3. The preaching of John Baptist&#59;&#34; and the pages are headed&#44;
                &#34; The promulgation of the <pb n="44"/> 44 CONSOLATION OF ISRAEL. gospel.&#34; I
                refer you to the book itself for the con&#8211; tin uation of the contents of the
                chapter forty of Isaiah according to the Anglican church&#44; and will merely limit
                myself&#44; for brevity&#39;s sake&#44; to the part quoted. Our text is&#58;
                &#34;Comfort ye&#44; comfort ye&#44; my people&#44; will say your God. Speak
                consolation unto the heart of Jerusalem&#44;&#34; &#35;c. But what is understood by
                the gospel &#63; The annunciation of the creed of the gentile ISTazarenes&#44; which
                took place at the eve of the down&#8211; fall of our home and temple under the
                assaults of the Romans. We have exhibited what is meant by &#34; my people&#59;&#34;
                they were those who were to be comforted&#44; and no other person or persons can be
                substituted in their place. Now&#44; if the promulgation of the gospel could be
                meant&#44; which took place not to the Jews&#44; but to their destroyers&#44; the
                words ought to have been &#58; &#34; Comfort ye the enemies of my people&#44; will
                say the God who hath rejected Israel&#59;&#34; since the downfall of Israel by the
                building up of the gentile world must presuppose&#44; that the former are no longer
                the peculiar and chosen people. Now the prophet speaks in the future&#44; not as the
                English version has it&#44; &#34; saith&#44;&#34; but &#34; will say your God.&#34;
                It evidently means&#44; now&#44; that the comforting&#44; whatever be understood
                thereby&#44; was not to take place immediately&#44; but at a distant day&#44; a
                future at least till after the death of the prophet&#59; for he clearly announced a
                dispersion of the people of God&#44; at least those whom he called so&#44; and saw
                the partial fulfilment of the denunciation. To this people&#44; sinning at the time
                of the prophecy&#44; is applied&#44; at a future period&#44; the name of &#34; my
                people&#44;&#34; and the Deity calls himself in reference to them&#44; &#34; your
                God.&#34; If&#44; now&#44; the heading of the English Bible could be <pb n="45"/>
                CONSOLATION OF ISRAEL. 45 true at all&#44; it would be requisite that the
                gospel&#44; a term well enough understood by us at the present day&#44; must have
                been announced to the Israelites at its first promulgation&#44; and as
                &#34;comfort&#34; is attached to the message&#44; it needs must have been one which
                the people received as a consolation and happy tidings from their God. But nothing
                of the kind do our op&#8211; ponents allege to have occurred&#44; and I refer to
                them&#44; because our own history is silent on the subject. The followers of the
                Nazarene say&#44; that he appeared at a period of great distress among those whom
                Isaiah calls&#44; in the name of God&#44; &#34; my people&#44;&#34; that he and his
                disciples addressed the identical gospel to them upon every possible occasion&#44;
                and that neither were the Jews comforted by this message&#44; nor were they
                continued as &#34;God&#39;s people&#59;&#34; for they rejected the gospel and its
                adherents&#44; and their national glory was cast down into the dust&#44; and the
                goodness of God was especially bestowed upon the followers of the gospel&#44; which
                according to the text ought to have been a comfort to the nation of whom Isaiah was
                one. &#8212; But we contend that&#44; unless there be an error in the defi&#8211;
                nition we have given to the words &#34; my people&#44;&#34; and &#34;
                Jerusalem&#44;&#34; the heading of the common version is totally erroneous and
                untenable&#44; and the pretended accomplishment on foreign nations totally at
                variance with the evident signification of the very words em&#8211; ployed by the
                translators of the Bible. Yet this is but one of many misstatements and forced
                construc&#8211; tions which are daily presented to our acceptance&#59; and despite
                of their palpable weakness&#44; great aston&#8211; ishment is manifested that we
                Jews should be so blinded&#44; as not to see what is not to be seen&#44; and to <pb

                compels us to say is neither founded in reason nor consonant with Scripture. The
                nature of a public address does not permit us to dwell any longer on this part of
                our subject&#44; and we must turn to the second point of our inquiry&#58; &#34; What
                is the nature of the announcement which the prophet makes to the people of
                Israel&#44; whom we bave proved to be the intended recipients of the promised
                blessing&#63;&#34; Let the words speak for themselves. We know that all the
                threatenings of evil unto Israel for disobedience came through the prophets whom God
                sent to speak in bis name &#59; and now&#44; when a change is announced as
                impending&#44; the same persons are called upon to speak in a different language
                &#59; and therefore says the text&#58; When the time shall come for the termination
                of the sorrows and tribulations which followed each other thick and fast during
                cen&#8211; turies of transgression&#44; the spirit of God will tell his faithful
                messengers to speak no longer of woe&#44; and sorrow&#44; and destruction&#44; but
                to address comfort to the hearts that have mourned so long&#59; to assure them that
                the punishment was not an evidence of re&#8211; jection from his grace&#44; but an
                earnest&#44; an evidence&#44; that their God was watching their iniquity&#44; and
                vis&#8211; ited them with the rod of correction&#44; in order only that their
                transgression might be atoned for&#44; agree&#8211; ably to his attributes of mercy

                at the same time warn us not to rely upon long indul&#8211; gence with the idea of
                impunity. And should the people say&#44; &#34; We have suffered more than any other

                stubbornness&#44; which would not listen to all the warnings full of love and
                compassion which were addressed to them during their days of prosperity&#44; morning
                and evening&#44; by those whose wisdom and deep insight into futurity proved them to

                of the Almighty &#59; and they will be told that these messengers they scorned&#44;
                these prophets they slew&#44; these seers they scourged and cast into loathsome
                dungeons. Was it not meet then that similar trials should befall the people whilst
                they&#39; remained rebellious &#63; and what more fitting instru&#8211; ments could
                the Lord choose than the arms of the gentiles&#44; who had not known his name&#44;

                and this is the comfort which is to be breathed into their hearts&#44; this the
                trust which is to animate their souls. &#8212; And farther says the Spirit&#58;

                for many years be hated&#59; your belief in one God will expose you to many

                prevailing&#44; and you&#44; children of Israel&#44; shall then live among the
                nations peacefully and securely&#44; you shall have temples every wdiere&#44; and be
                treated as citizens in every country where you may live &#59; you shall forget

                restoration&#44; the Bible would have so expressed it&#59; the prophets were not so
                poor in language&#44; nor the Spirit so short in knowl&#8211; edge&#44; but that
                there were ample means to have de&#8211; clared the future after the manner we have
                indicated&#44; as easily as the reverse has been done. It is unfor&#8211; tunate for
                us&#44; that there are men who are ashamed of the singularity of the Jewish
                belief&#44; as they have received it from their fathers&#59; they fancy that it is
                not an evidence of enlightenment to look forward to a Jewish country&#44; to be
                governed by Jewish laws. They believe that they must bring the sacrifice of <pb

                offering to the countries of their sojourning. But how short&#8211; sighted are such
                men &#33; they gain nothing in the esteem of the gentiles by their denial of their
                hopes in a glo&#8211; rious restoration&#44; and they draw down on themselves the
                wrath of Heaven for their daring unbelief. Do they really think that an
                enlightened&#44; liberal man&#44; who is no Israelite&#44; does not see that these
                new doubts&#44; sprung up in the course of a few years of ease&#44; en&#8211; joyed

                slavery&#44; wrought so many miracles to preserve us amidst persecutions&#44; that
                at length we might play&#44; so to say &#44; a secondary part in a state of
                universal peace&#44; an insignificant handful in every spot amidst the peaceful

                they really imagine that the Searcher of hearts sees not the unbelief that is in
                their spirit&#44; their anxiety to escape from the burden of religion by their
                spirit&#8211; ualizing the text of Scripture to suit their notions of truth and

                sensions are sown in the midst of our families&#44; and divisions&#44; fearful and
                sinful&#44; fill with dismay the lover of his God and of the welfare of his people.
                Yet the Lord will protect his flock against this danger too. He who arrested the
                sword when it flashed in the light of the rising sun&#44; and was not sated with
                slaughter when the moon slowly ascended in the eastern horizon&#44; will in his
                infinite mercy avert this cup of sorrow from our lips&#44; and suffer not the
                har&#8211; mony of Israel to be broken up by means of the artful errors which the
                unthinking wish to propagate. No&#44; brethren &#33; the prophets speak of a literal
                Jeru&#8211; salem&#44; of a bodily assembling of the scattered out&#8211; casts of
                Judah &#59; and they mean these ideas only&#44; or else they would have used
                different language&#44; which was amply at their command. A spiritual
                regenera&#8211; tion of the sons of Jacob&#44; and a reign of universal peace
                &#40;of which more on another occasion&#41; are to a certainty included in the
                predictions&#59; but this does not say that the accomplishment of these things is
                not to be effected in the bodily Jerusalem&#44; at the very temple on Moriah&#44; by
                the very personage whom we hope for&#44; the Messiah David&#44; the son of David ben
                Yishai from Bethlehem. Ay&#44; we doubt&#59; the day is too far distant for us&#63;
                we are tired of waiting&#63; But&#44; says Isaiah &#58; &#34; The grass

                but the word of our God will stand for ever.&#34; Truly the earth will put on her
                mantle of green when the early spring wakes nature again into life&#59; the flowers
                will enamel the meadows&#44; and the blossoms will deck with beauty the trees of the

                in his progress towards summer&#59; but again the storm blows with its hot breath
                over the landscape&#44; and withered is the grass&#44; and faded is the flower&#59;
                and man&#44; too&#44; will bloom in infancy&#44; and shoot up into manhood&#44; and
                bear fruit and prosper in his works &#59; but age creeps over him&#44; his frame
                sickens&#44; his Limbs quiver under the weight of years&#44; and his spirit flies
                from him&#44; and the sod of the valley covers his frame&#44; and the worm becomes
                his associate. Yet with all this the WORD of God neither fades nor withers&#59; it
                sees changes of seasons and of centuries pass along in rapid succes&#8211; sion&#59;
                but it awaits the sure fulfilment which the mind of the Supreme has assigned for its
                triumphant establishment&#44; for its indestructible rule over the des&#8211; tinies
                of man. And has not our history proved to us that God is true and his word abiding
                forever&#63; Therefore do we hope&#44; and look forward with prayer and longing to
                the hour when the glory of God shall appear&#44; and all flesh see that his mouth
                has spoken it. Equally erroneous with the spiritualizing of doubt&#8211; ing Jews is
                the view of the Xazarenes&#44; who apply the verse &#34; A voice crieth in the

                history as John the Baptist. This is the first time in my lectures that I have ever
                spoken directly of the characters of the Nazarene faith&#44; but it is unavoidable

                crying in the wilderness&#44;&#34; as the Nazarene records say&#59; but this
                certainly is not a satisfactory fulfilment of the passage under discus&#8211; sion.
                It is not correct to render the passage &#34; the voice of him that crieth in the
                wilderness&#44;&#34; because <pb n="52"/> 52 CONSOLATION OF ISRAEL. Sip is the

                proph&#8211; ecy&#44; calls out to the world to make ready a passage for the
                redeemed and comforted sons of Jerusalem to appear again before their God&#44; to
                worship Him in their ancient limits as of old &#59; for they only require a highway
                in the desert&#44; to return to their former dwell&#8211; ing&#8211;places&#44;
                which are&#44; as the vision continues&#44; to be filled with worshippers&#44; of
                whom it can be said&#44; &#34; Be&#8211; hold&#44; here is your God.&#34; It is
                evident that with the voice crying in the wilderness there must be a re&#8211;
                building of Judea&#39;s cities. But was this the case when John appeared&#44;
                granting that there lived such a man &#63; No &#59; soon after the land became a
                prey to hosts of enemies that broke down the glory of Israel. And since then &#63;

                of affliction rested on thy people. Centuries have elapsed since we were a united
                nation&#44; and ages have vanished since one chief ruled over us all. But in all our
                sorrows thy light shone brightly above us&#44; and in the absence of an earthly
                head&#44; Thou&#44; almighty 5* <pb n="54"/> 54 BIBLE DUTIES. One&#33; wert our
                Chief and King. How glorious is this thought &#33; we&#44; the mortal&#44; corrupt
                children of clay&#44; are the special object of thy providence&#59; and Thou&#44;
                the unending&#44; incorruptible and holy God&#44; art the Sovereign of this earthly
                kingdom. Grant then that we may be truly sensible of this glorious destiny&#44; to
                feel that&#44; though members of the states in which we live&#44; we are
                nevertheless special subjects in thy heavenly kingdom&#44; priests in thy own holy
                temple&#44; destined to fulfil thy will&#44; to accomplish the mission which thy
                wisdom has assigned unto our remotest descendants. Give us strength therefore to
                withstand the trials of life which everywhere surround us&#44; and keep us
                unconsumed before Thee&#44; even until that hopeful day when Tbou wilt send thy
                servant David to restore peace on earth&#44; and to bring all mankind as worshippers
                before the footstool of thy glory. Amen. Brethren &#33; The Bible&#44; as we all
                acknowledge&#44; contains the re&#8211; vealed word of God&#44; by the tenor of
                which all be&#8211; lievers profess to frame their thoughts and to shape their
                course of life. In these points are all agreed&#44; that religious belief is only
                founded on Scripture&#44; and that religious conduct can have its source only in the
                same pure fountain. Nevertheless&#44; if we watch the children of men in their
                conversation and conduct&#44; I speak of those who profess to be pious&#44; we must
                be amazed and grieved at the contrariety of views which they base upon the same
                record of revelation&#44; as though the same words could afford just warranty for
                opposite interpretations. It is therefore evident that something else than the mere
                Avords of the Bible <pb n="55"/> BIBLE DUTIES. 55 come into play whenever one sits
                down to the perusal of its pages&#44; and this something is the prejudice of
                education&#44; aided not rarely by the war of human passions. We will merely
                state&#44; that from the mo&#8211; ment our mind begins its operations of thinking
                and framing ideas&#44; it is exposed to a thousand disturbing causes which all more
                or less leave their impress upon the pure page of the human soul. Whatever is
                trans&#8211; acted without us&#44; forms an image within&#44; which we carry
                unconsciously about us&#44; and afterwards colour it by any new lights which one
                after the other are presented to our eyes. And whenever our feelings become enlisted
                in favour of this coloured image&#44; which we have&#44; as we fain would
                believe&#44; created our&#8211; selves&#44; we lose sight of the fact that we might
                per&#8211; chance have created a fiction&#44; and endowed it with the habiliments of
                truth&#44; and believe therefore that we alone are correct in our preconceived
                opinions&#44; and everybody equally wrong in what he alleges. It is perhaps a happy
                thing for mankind&#44; as they are constituted&#44; that each one finds a species of
                happi&#8211; ness in the fabric which he has been taught to erect&#59; nevertheless
                it cannot be denied&#44; that every one of the peculiar notions which each
                individual of the great mass entertains cannot at one and the same time be based
                upon simple truth&#44; or the immutable divine standard of uniformity in all its
                parts&#44; upon every occasion&#44; at every season&#44; and under all circum&#8211;
                stances. &#8212; People in this manner are induced to adopt certain ideas&#44; and
                to receive as conclusive certain arguments which are advanced to fortify these
                ideas. But very little opportunity for doubt is presented&#59; because few ever are
                admitted who repudiate these <pb n="56"/> 56 BIBLE DUTIES. views among them &#59;
                and if perad venture this last does occur&#44; then are passions excited&#44; angry
                feelings called into play&#44; and the chances of conviction on both sides are
                extremely small&#44; if not totally out of the question. Every disputant has a
                species of property in the posi&#8211; tion which he advances &#59; something of
                credit to lose by having been imposed upon in his former habits of thought&#59; and
                he thus refuses to listen &#39;to anything alleged in opposition to them&#44; not to
                mention&#44; to be convinced by the opposite side. &#8212; Moreover&#44; there is a
                pride of intellect&#44; a wrapping up of one&#39;s self in his own importance&#44;
                which counsels us to look with con&#8211; tempt upon every proposition which does
                not emanate from ourselves&#44; or to which at least we have not given our assent
                &#59; and if we are appealed to&#44; to listen&#44; to ponder and to weigh&#44; we
                shut both our eyes&#44; for fear a single solitary ray of light should disturb the
                equi&#8211; librium of our composure&#44; and cause us the trouble to remodel our
                mental structure&#44; or add to or diminish from what we have been vaunting of as
                unimprovable. A man&#44; when he alters his opinions&#44; confesses at once that for
                a greater or less duration of time he has been deceived by others or been the dupe
                of his own con&#8211; ceit&#59; and therefore he must exert no ordinary share of
                fortitude&#44; before he can arrive at that important point to admit any degree of
                reasonableness in the views of others&#44; even granting that he gets an
                oppor&#8211; tunity&#44; which many do not in their whole life&#44; to compare his
                mode of thought with the standard which governs other beings who like him have
                received an intelligent spirit. The above is one reason why there is such a
                diver&#8211; sity of views among Bible readers. All have not <pb n="57"/> BIBLE
                DUTIES. 57 been educated alike&#44; and all are not intelligent alike. To some&#44;

                contrive to snatch up something out of the unfathom&#8211; able depth of truth which
                is the spirit of the Word. But at best their search is painful&#44; and their mind
                distracted by the contending opinions which so many around them entertain. Hence it
                results that the interpretation which they arrive at is strangely de&#8211;

                held in after&#8211;life much converse with persons who have peculiar&#44; and as we

                the first case he perhaps hon&#8211; estly endeavours to reconcile the word of the
                Bible with his own conduct&#44; since he feels a sort of shame to confess himself
                condemned by the Source of truth &#59; hence may result a certain bias to see in the
                Bible a permission for acts or a warrant for opinions&#44; which the unburdened
                conscience could never discover therein. In the second case the person who advances
                the opinions opposed to oar views may be truly an object of pity. He is perchance a
                seeker after truth&#44; and has become perplexed by the appeals of his asso&#8211;
                ciates &#59; he does not feel that he ought to doubt their sincerity&#44; or suspect
                their piety &#59; and still he sees that they differ materially from what he has
                been taught. Now he cannot embrace their ideas&#44; for that would be rejecting the
                instruction which he really believes in &#59; but he strives to reconcile the
                contending opin&#8211; ions&#44; and imagines perhaps that he has succeeded in
                removing by his intellectual power the spiritual bar&#8211; rier which divides
                mankind. Is it then to be won&#8211; dered at that he strains his mental vision&#44;
                and fancies that he sees what no one else can see &#63; And thus any absurdity which
                he may be guilty of must be set down to his believing himself equal to a task which
                is beyond the power of man to achieve. Diversity of opinions has existed from the
                beginning &#59; and he therefore who attempts the reconciliation of all men by
                adopting a portion of the thoughts of each&#44; must labour in a hopeless task&#44;

                laws of thought&#44; as well as new theories in thinking. What we have been
                saying&#44; so briefly and imper&#8211; fectly&#44; must convince the thinker&#44;
                that the difference <pb n="60"/> 60 BIBLE DUTIES. of conclusions arrived at by the

                asso&#8211; ciating with persons of divers views in maturer years. The heathen who
                never heard of the Decalogue can have no veneration for the sublime constitution of
                Moses of which he has no knowledge&#59; the Moslem will scorn any one who presumes
                to contradict the Koran &#59; equally so however will the Xazarene con&#8211; demn
                the Israelite who sees not in the history of the founder of his religion the Messiah
                of the prophets&#44; and finds not the plurality of the Deity hinted at in the words
                of the law&#59; so also will the uneducated Hebrew smile at what he thinks the

                garment of fringes&#44; especially during the time of prayer&#59; for this is an
                hour of humiliation when the creature comes to submit himself to his Maker&#39;s
                will&#44; when he approaches to confess his weak&#8211; ness without the aid from
                above&#44; and without that un&#8211; deserved grace for which he entreats the Giver

                that to follow the dictates of an unregenerated heart and the bidding of lustful
                eves&#44; would be hurrying on in the path of perdition. He should then condemn
                himself for every act of disobe&#8211; dience with which he has burdened his
                conscience&#44; and impress deeply on his mind that not only he&#44; but also the

                little token is a sign of the existence of the law. And as the very institution

                ceive upon me his yoke and his kingdom &#59; for his are the power and the
                government&#44; to do in all the world according to his will&#44; as He did in
                Egypt&#59; and to Him do I devote my soul&#44; heart&#44; and brain&#44; for He is
                one&#44; and there is no second&#44; nor is there a unity like unto his unity.&#34;
                And in truth&#44; it well becomes the mortal to appear thus before his God&#59; to
                devote the early part of every day in humility and resignation to the holy One&#39;s
                will and power. Much have Israelites suffered for the upholding of that faith&#44;
                the simplicity of which is a stumbling&#8211;block to the gentiles&#59; many waters
                of bitterness have passed over their head&#44; be&#8211; cause they refused to
                mingle with the nations of the earth &#59; much hatred and contempt were heaped upon
                them because&#44; according to the words of the Bible&#44; they believed themselves
                the chosen messengers of God on earth &#59; it is therefore meet that they do not
                    <pb n="67"/> BIBLE DUTIES. 67 omit to consecrate&#44; daily&#44; their body to
                the service of the Lord&#44; to devote their mortal frame&#44; if need be&#44; to
                seal by a glorious death&#44; the truth of a well&#8211;spent life&#44; the
                sincerity of the faith which they profess&#44; in order to prove to the world&#44;
                that it is not an idle thing for which the Hebrews toil&#44; that it is not worldly
                gain which unites them together &#59; but that it is the unwavering faith in the
                Unity to which there is no second&#44; that it is the knowledge that to this
                adorable Being are due the sole love and obedience of the people&#44; which He
                redeemed from Egyptian slavery &#33; Do you&#44; gentile friend&#44; call this
                superstition&#63; a use&#8211; less observance of things not familiar to you &#63;
                We acknowledge that these ceremonial ordinances were given to Israel only&#44; as
                the word says&#44; &#34; for their generations&#59;&#34; to you&#44; therefore&#44;
                they have neither applicability nor meaning&#59; but to the son of Jacob they are of
                vital importance&#44; they are outward evi&#8211; dences whether he is willing to
                serve the Lord in small things&#44; to prove thereby that his heart is true&#44; to
                bring the sacrifice of the dearest&#44; when the service of the great King should
                demand it. &#8212; It is easy to heap odium upon us by charging us with
                supersti&#8211; tion &#58; but before the rational and liberal inquirer does so&#44;
                he ought to be well informed whether or not there may be truth in what he has not
                yet investigated. We too&#44; could charge gentiles with superstition&#59; their
                modes of thought are incomprehensible to us&#59; their symbols are to us prohibited
                by the plain letter of the Bible &#59; their notions of the Deity we cannot
                entertain&#44; consistently with a common sense view of the doctrines of the
                Scripture &#58; and still we should <pb n="68"/> 68 BIBLE DUTIES. be charged with
                illiberality&#44; were we to call our neigh&#8211; bours superstitious for not
                agreeing with us in senti&#8211; ment. Our symbols appear therefore of no
                import&#8211; ance to the stranger&#44; because they are so very simple&#59; our
                ceremonies are looked upon as useless&#44; because there is so little to attract in
                them. But for this very reason do they bear to us the stamp of divine au&#8211;
                thority. With a book&#44; a garment of fringes&#44; ami phylacteries in his
                possession&#44; the Jew bears with him all the symbols of his faith&#59; he needs
                not any outward token of expensive material or curious workmanship&#59; and then
                these very symbols are the record of God&#39;s revelation&#44; the offering of
                prayer according to the tradition of the righteous who have lived before us&#44;
                together with the habiliments which the Bible ordains&#44; &#8212; and thus he is
                armed&#44; in knowl&#8211; edge&#44; in hope&#44; in faith&#44; in deeds. Whenever
                sin pre&#8211; sents itself to his mind he has the word with him to teach him
                righteousness&#44; and has the commandment always present to check the dawning of
                transgres&#8211; sion&#44; and to remind him that his God watches over all his
                deeds. There is therefore spirituality enough to sanctify the act of devotion&#59;
                and&#44; as man is neces&#8211; sarily bound to outward objects&#44; there is symbol
                enough to aid the inward promptings of his better genius&#44; which counsels him to
                do good and eschew evil. Unconsciously&#44; I have been led along to expatiate on
                the external types of our religion to a greater length than I anticipated&#44; and
                still without much more than merely commencing the discussion. It is now time that
                we return to the point from which we started&#44; that is&#44; the diversity of
                opinions concerning <pb n="69"/> BIBLE DUTIES. 69 the meaning of Scripture. It is
                evident that though there may he no evil resulting to us from any one&#39;s
                explaining the Bihle as he may please&#44; and I am one of those who maintain that
                it contains within itself its hest exposition&#44; for God&#39;s testimony is
                true&#44; it re&#8211; freshes the soul&#58; still we must have an initiation in the
                opinions of Israel&#44; before it will he safe for us to venture upon the extensive
                field of the researches which the record of revelation offers. &#34;We have seen
                that some regard not our ceremonies as ordained &#58; still there is scarcely an
                informed Israelite who could hon&#8211; estly venture such an assertion &#59; and
                even those gen&#8211; tiles who believe that originally the ceremonies were
                requisite&#44; though they deem them so no longer&#44; would not gainsay it.
                Whichever of these heresies occupies our mind in the beginning of our inquiries&#44;
                would de&#8211; stroy all hopes of a union with the mass of Israel. It is therefore
                clearly the province of parents and teachers to expound the word of God to their
                charges&#44; in the manner they have themselves obtained it&#44; to transmit it to
                those who&#44; after them&#44; are to continue among the race of Jacob the truth as
                they have received it. It is possible that the younger branches will throw off the
                yoke&#44; and strike out new r ways of their own when they leave the paternal
                roof&#44; or the school of instruc&#8211; tion&#59; but this is not to be considered
                by them for a moment&#59; they must discharge their duty if they wish to be
                obedient&#44; and let them leave the issue in the hands of Him who directs all for a
                wise and merciful end. &#8212; Let us then all unite to proclaim aloud the
                principles of the divine legislation&#59; let us hold fast to the Word and the
                interpretation of our fathers&#44; under the full conviction that in nearly every
                case <pb n="70"/> 70 REGENERATION. our expositions are the most natural and the most
                consonant with the genius of the legislation on Sinai. &#8212; Let us be of good
                courage in this labour of love&#59; the indifference which now prevails concerning
                out&#8211; ward religion will not always continue&#59; the clouds of unbelief will
                one day be pierced by the rays of the sun of righteousness&#59; selfish grovelling
                for worldly gain will yield before long to a spirit of pursuit after God and his
                strength&#59; and then will be the glorious day&#44; when the fruit of early
                impressions will ripen to the delight of all &#59; and then true faith and devout
                obedience&#44; even in small matters&#44; will unite their sis&#8211; terly
                hands&#44; and carry up the spirit of the faithful and devout as a worthy offering
                to the altar of the Most High&#44; whose wisdom is unsearchable and whose goodness
                is never ending. Amen. Elul 13th. &#124; 5603 Sept. 8th. DISCOURSE V. REGENERATION.
                Father of all &#33; who art hidden from our sight&#44; whilst thy eyes survey all
                nature&#44; give us thy mercy in an&#8211; swer to our prayer&#44; and cleanse us
                thoroughly from our iniquities. Well do we know that we have de&#8211; served thy
                indignation &#59; because that we have wilfully sinned against thy ordinances &#59;
                but receive us&#44; O mer&#8211; ciful One &#33; in this dread hour when we come in
                thy <pb n="71"/> REGENERATION. 71 presence&#44; not trusting in our righteousness
                but lean&#8211; ing upon thy grace which overshadows all. Remem&#8211; ber that we
                are thy children&#44; whom Thou hast sworn to preserve as the witnesses of thy power
                and glory. Do&#44; then&#44; not diminish our number in Thy wrath&#44; and let to
                each individual shine thy light and thy truth. But should thy dread judgment require
                that retribu&#8211; tion should overtake us &#58; then arrest speedily the de&#8211;
                stroyer&#39;s hand&#44; and stay the uplifted sword through thy
                loving&#8211;kindness which is everlasting&#59; so that we may be taught to love thy
                mercy whilst we are made to feel thy power &#59; so that we may be purified of our
                misdeeds&#44; and stand before Thee in the glory of a new and regenerated life.
                Amen. Brethren &#33; At a period of great lukewarmness and grievous transgression a
                messenger of the Most High spoke as follows in his name &#58; &#34;I will heal their
                backsliding&#59; I will love them freely&#59; for ray anger is turned away from
                them.&#34; Hosea xiv. 5. The people of Israel had at the time when this joy&#8211;
                ful hope for the sinner was announced to them&#44; for&#8211; saken the covenant and
                gone astray after the idols and abominations of the gentiles&#44; casting off the
                sweet burden of the law of their God and Father. The wrath which they had braved so
                long with apparent impunity had at length been enkindled&#44; and it tore up piece
                by piece the foundation of their state and <pb n="72"/> 72 REGENERATION. their
                temple&#44; of that state which was established only on the basis of
                righteousness&#44; and of that temple&#44; the walls of which were cemented by
                obedience only and a sincere faith in God. And now the sword was about to be drawn
                from its scabbard&#44; and it was not again to be sheathed till it had accomplished
                its mis&#8211; sion of woe and sorrow&#44; and swept off the state of Israel from
                among the nations and levelled with the earth the house of glory &#59; because the
                state had de&#8211; generated from its high purport of a missionary of goodness to
                the sons of man&#44; and because the sanctu&#8211; ary and altar had become defiled
                by the presence of those who defied the vengeance of Him who dwelled among them
                between the wings of the cherubim. In other words&#44; disobedience and its
                concomitant sin had incensed the all&#8211;watching Justice&#44; and retribution
                claimed the victim which had revelled in thoughtless security. &#8212; And fearful
                was the vengeance when it came&#59; it was not the overwhelming torrent which
                engulfed other nations in the pool of darkness and oblivion&#44; but that constant
                pursuit of the doomed which reached the individuals as well as the mass&#44; which
                haunted their steps in every walk of life&#44; in every portion of God&#39;s
                earth&#44; and which to this day still follows in the wake of their descendants to
                claim its right&#44; whenever they foolishly dare to forget their allegiance to
                their heavenly King. It was at a time when sinning was at its height&#44; and when
                the wrath was about being poured forth&#44; that the prophet saw behind the dark
                masses&#44; which were to obscure our light for many centuries of deso&#8211;
                lation&#44; the rays of divine mercy again illumining the night of affliction&#44;
                dispelling the mists which had so <pb n="73"/> REGENERATION. 73 long shrouded our
                glory&#44; bringing peace to the spirits which had sorrowed so long. &#8212; By what
                means&#44; now&#44; does the seer propose to effect this hopeful restoration to
                favour&#63; Does he tell the people that they must embrace new ideas &#63; pursue
                new paths &#63; acknowledge other masters&#63; worship new gods&#63; &#8212; no&#44;
                these are the very sins which the Israelites. were then pursuing&#59; they had
                mingled with the truths of religion views borrowed from the idolatrous heathens
                &#59; they had long been following gentile habits engendered by a love of change
                &#59; they had thrown off their allegiance to the house of David&#59; and in
                addition to the One Su&#8211; preme&#44; they worshipped the deities which their
                unin&#8211; structed neighbours feared. Not this&#44; therefore&#44; was to be done
                by them to be loved freely of their God&#59; but they were bidden in tones of
                affection&#44; &#34; Return&#44; Israel&#44; even unto the Lord thy God &#59;&#34;
                they had departed widely from the road which leads to heaven&#44; they had swerved
                unto by&#8211;paths and been entangled iu the pitfalls of unbelief and faith&#8211;
                lessness &#59; their transgressions had piled up&#44; as it were&#44;
                mountain&#8211;high obstructions in their way &#59; every ap&#8211; proach to
                goodness was seemingly barred to them&#44; every ray of divine consolation was shut
                out by the dense canopy which iniquity places between man and his Creator. Yet&#44;
                says the spirit&#44; &#34; Return&#44; O Israel &#33;&#34; The labour may be
                arduous&#44; in the beginning it may seem impossible &#59; but never fear&#44;

                However far the mercy of God may have been removed from thee by thy own

                thee in his pa&#8211; ternal embrace. &#8212; Let us notice the peculiar word &#34;
                return &#59;&#34; the modern word repentance is not em&#8211; ployed&#44; which
                might signify that man should be sorry for the past&#44; whilst he commences his
                labour of re&#8211; generation by a new path&#44; just pointed out to him&#59; but
                &#34; return&#34; is the word&#58; this means a recurrence to the way which had been
                trod in the commencement of a pious career&#44; which had been pursued&#44; by the
                lights which had shone in days of old&#44; by those whom the Lord calls his friends
                and servants. It is then in the pursuit of the ancient usages&#44; as pointed out by
                God himself&#44; that Israelites were told to return to the Lord their God &#59;
                that is to say&#44; as they had ad&#8211; opted new ideas in belief&#44; they were
                to discard these altogether as erroneous and sinful&#44; and adopt with a perfect
                sincerity and an entire singleness of heart the ancestral creed of the Lord our God
                being the Lord alone&#44; since there is none beside Him who is Saviour and
                Redeemer. And as they had thought themselves authorized to leave out from the duties
                they had been taught to observe whatever they thought too burden&#8211; some or
                opposed to the standard of their own reason&#44; <pb n="75"/> REGENERATION. 75 they
                should henceforward sedulously endeavour to ob&#8211; serve and do whatever they had
                received as the law of God&#44; justifying themselves only by obedience&#44;
                heed&#8211; ing only the voice of instruction which had spoken to them from the
                summit of Mount Sinai&#44; mindful only of the words of the covenant which had been
                announced to them from the midst of the terrors and the glory of the descent of the
                divine presence among the children of the dust. As they had also repudiated the
                earthly kingdom of the house of David&#44; whom God had appointed to the rule over
                his people till the earth should be no more&#44; they should return to their
                alle&#8211; giance&#44; rejecting all worldly glory which centred not in the chief
                of his people&#44; under whose shadow they are to live among the nations&#44;
                serving under him and with him the Eternal God&#44; who remembers his covenant and
                his truth to all generations&#44; even unto everlasting. And as&#44; lastly&#44;
                they had thought that they could not approach immediately the awful Ma&#8211; jesty
                of heaven except through the mediation of beings superior to man&#44; inferior only
                to the Creator&#44; and had erected altars to a multitude of demons to whom
                sacrifices smoked in all the cities of Judah and Israel &#58; they should at their
                time of repentance&#44; cling to the One alone&#44; who is indivisible and
                unchangeable&#44; who is near unto all who call upon Him in truth&#44; who is great
                in kindness and pardons abundantly the chil&#8211; dren of his adorers. The
                Israelites as a nation heeded not the words of the prophets&#59; they continued to
                violate the covenant&#44; to forsake the law&#44; to incense the Lord by the deeds
                of their hands. The evil which they did not heed came over them&#44; and proved to
                their obdurate hearts <pb n="76"/> 76 REGENERATION. that the end of sin is death.
                Still to this day the Spirit speaks unto our souls&#44; and calls unto us to return
                to the safe fold of the law of God&#44; to forsake the evil in our hands&#44; and to
                purchase our eternal peace by faith and obedience. Let us not imagine that the
                length of time which has elapsed since the prophets of God walked among men has
                weakened the force of the truths which they announced &#59; not so &#58; the same
                God yet rules the earth&#44; the same law yet exists as the emanation of his Wisdom.
                But also the same wrath yet burns which our forefathers caused to blaze forth
                against them. &#34; Our fathers have sin&#8211; ned and are no more&#44; and we bear
                their iniquities&#59;&#34; and we add to the ilame by the pursuit of things which
                are an abomination to the Lord. Were it that man would be taught wisdom by
                others&#39; experience&#44; how zealous would we all be&#44; as a matter of
                necessity&#44; in the cause of our blessed religion. We have seen during the
                progress of our whole history that sinning is sure to be followed by punishment&#59;
                we have at the same time received ideas the most refined of the nature of the Being
                whom all flesh adores&#44; to whom every knee is bent&#44; though called by various
                names by the different families of the earth&#59; we have in our possession a
                law&#44; the observance of which will pro&#8211; duce good&#8211;will among the
                progeny of Adam&#44; whilst it will&#44; as we are promised&#44; secure to us the
                undeserved favour of the Most High. And yet we are not wiser than our ancestors were
                in the days of Hosea. Men among us&#44; women called by the name of Israel&#44; have
                forsaken the covenant of Abraham&#44; and refuse to seal the flesh of their
                offspring with that mysterious sign which the Lord himself instituted&#44; when He
                blessed <pb n="77"/> REGENERATION. 77 Abraham as the father of a multitude of
                nations. There are among us those who join the schools of philosophy to invest the
                Deity&#44; praised be his name&#44; with attributes which our religion knows not.
                There are those who doubt of the truth of revelation&#44; sub&#8211; stituting their
                own puerile fancies for the words of life contained in the law. There are those who
                doubt the promises of the Lord&#44; as though He could change or waver in his truth.
                There are those who profess to believe&#44; yet violate habitually the sanctity of
                the Sabbath&#44; seeking their own gain&#44; instead of being sedulous in the
                service of their Maker. There are those who ask not for the restoration of the
                divine glory to Zion&#44; but are content to mingle with the gentiles as though they
                were of the noble blood of Jacob&#39;s household. There are those who are ashamed of
                the name of Jew&#44; and endeavour to hide their opinions by an outward aping of
                gentile customs and manners. In short&#44; our community is contaminated by the
                iniquity of unbelief&#44; by the boldness of open sin &#58; and yet we wonder
                whether the mercy of God can be true&#44; because it has not yet been revealed
                before our eyes &#63; whether the Messiah is a creature of the im&#8211;
                agination&#44; simply because he has not yet appeared&#63; But have we deserved to

                &#63; what have we done to quench the anger which our misconduct and unbelief have
                provoked&#63; It was in olden times the accursed love of money&#44; of pleasure&#44;
                and of power&#44; which destined our temple twice and scattered us among the
                nations&#59; and it is yet the same accursed love of money&#44; of pleasure&#44; and
                of power&#44; which induces us to seek affinity with gentiles&#44; to <pb n="78"/>

                Ask we&#44; why so many violate the Sabbath &#63; it is the love of money&#44; base
                money&#44; which vanishes whilst the dazzled eye yet gloats upon the heaps of
                shining metal which men call wealth&#59; for soon&#44; alas &#33; if it should abide
                with man in his earthly sojourn&#44; he must leave it to those who laboured not for
                its acquisition&#44; and who will dissipate it in the pursuit of low pleasures.
                &#8212; Another barters his soul literally for a dish of food&#44;
                Esau&#8211;like&#44; who sold his precious birthright for a mess of pottage&#59;
                because he cannot resist the flesh of the swine or the savour of creeping things
                which the law forbids. &#8212; Another joins the communion of a gentile church&#44;
                because the seductive bright eyes of beauty allure him from the humble fellowship of
                the synagogue. In what are these and many others like them dis&#8211; tinguishable
                from those in Hosea&#39;s time who loved their idols &#63; Do we imagine that before
                the impartial throne of eternal Justice there is any difference be&#8211; tween
                gross and refined iniquity&#63; No&#44; surely not&#59; and though the sinners may
                presume that Providence slumbers&#44; they will discover&#44; to their cost&#44;
                like the workers of iniquity in Hosea&#39;s days&#44; that it is vain in man to
                flatter himself with thoughts of impunity&#44; but that the evil will come though it
                be slow in its approach. And all this time the non&#8211;fulfilment of the good
                which has been promised proves distinctly&#44; that the pursuit of worldly things is
                not the way to win the favour of God&#44; and to cause the walls of Zion to be
                built&#44; and the Messiah to unfold his peaceful ban&#8211; ner&#44; to call all
                nations to worship at the same altar&#44; <pb n="79"/> REGENERATION. 79 to invoke
                the same adorable and fearful Name&#44; who released us from the bonds of bodily

                bloody persecutions have ceased&#44; we are ever and anon admonished that the time
                of the redemption has not come &#59; but that the more we endeavour to cast aside
                our ancient usages&#44; the more we are always exposed to the malignity of those who
                love not Jacob&#39;s descendants. Does not all this prove that the words of God are
                true &#63; that whilst we sin&#44; we shall be pun&#8211; ished &#63; that whilst we
                forsake Him&#44; his face will be hidden from us&#63; that his mercy cannot be

                deeds&#44; are all righteous&#44; how&#44; then&#44; does it stand with our
                faith&#63; where is that yield&#8211; ing to divine promises&#44; to God&#39;s
                guidance&#44; which deems nothing surer than his word&#44; which believes nothing
                truer than his commands &#63; &#8212; It is almost in vain to look for such results
                among many an Israel&#8211; itish community&#59; everywhere we find each man
                seek&#8211; ing to promote his own temporal welfare&#44; and to do the least for the
                benefit of Israel at large&#58; whilst faith as such is thought too refined for the
                mass&#44; or is over&#8211; whelmed by the pursuits of worldly interests which have
                some tangible result. With such sins among us&#44; it is in vain to look for any
                salutary amendment of our spiritual condition&#59; there must be a reform&#44; not
                in the manner the word is generally used&#44; but one of the spirit&#44; which is to
                show itself in a noble attachment to religious truths and ancestral obedi&#8211;
                ence&#44; such as was witnessed in that moment of holy enthusiasm&#44; when Israel
                stood as one man at the foot <pb n="80"/> 80 REGENERATION. of Sinai&#44; to listen
                to the holy Decalogue from the mouth of the Most High. &#8212; Could we witness once
                such a scene of devotion and obedience in Israel&#44; the day of the Messiah would
                not he far distant&#44; and then might we look confidently forward to the
                accomplish&#8211; ment of all the good which God has promised to his people. But
                whilst each man seeks for happiness beyond the pale of religion&#44; it is futile to
                expect a blessing&#44; which is conceivable only within the law &#59; for the whole
                regeneration of Israel rests on the basis of the precepts and commandments which we
                have received as the will of our Father in heaven. Perhaps we shall be asked &#58;
                &#34;How are we to do to work out our national happiness through repentance&#44;
                seeing that each man can but act for himself&#63;&#34; To this we answer&#44; Let
                every man act as though on him alone depended the salvation of Israel&#44; whilst
                assured&#8211; ly his own salvation depends upon his faith and deeds. Who ever
                discovers any evil within himself&#44; and who must not do so upon a candid
                examination&#63; let him set about rectifying the defect which he discovers&#59; let
                him not hold a parley with inward sin&#44; but let him confess it privately to his
                God&#44; and then show openly to his fellow&#8211;men that he has found something to
                condemn&#44; something to be amended. It is possible that he may feel the task
                severe&#44; to stand abashed before the world &#59; but when he reflects&#44; that
                from God he cannot hide himself&#44; that from the Lord&#39;s ken he cannot
                escape&#44; that the derision of man is not worth heeding&#44; nor his praise worth
                obtaining when the welfare of the soul is the price at stake&#58; he will gladly
                bring the sacrifice of his pride to his eternal salvation&#44; throw himself

                righteousness. &#8212; But not in the pride of his own strength should the sinner
                approach the accomplishment of his reformation. The Bible says&#44; in the name of
                God&#58; &#34;I will heal their back&#8211; sliding&#59;&#34; the grace of the
                Lord&#44; undeserved by any thing which we can do&#44; must and will be given to
                bring to a happy conclusion&#44; what man commences in faith and humility. The
                initiatory step every in&#8211; dividual must take&#59; without our knocking at the
                portals&#44; the gates of mercy will not be opened to us&#59; but when we approach
                as humble suppliants&#44; con&#8211; demning ourselves because we eliscover that our
                deeds accuse us before divine Justice&#44; the light we seek will spring tip within
                us&#44; and we shall be guided safely by the outstretched arm which is ever held out
                to those who wish to return from transgression. At first .the struggle will be

                lately entered &#59; but with every day&#44; the tone of confidence in divine things

                God will momentarily entwine its silken fibres closer around the heart&#44; and the
                perseverance in acts of piety will soon render them second nature to us&#44; when
                once we have felt how much more happily our daily toil passes along&#44; if&#44; so

                spirit of goodness in which the righteous endeavour to act. If this is the course of
                the repentant sinner&#44; he never will need to look back upon the enormity of his
                previous misdeeds&#44; he can return even unto the Lord his God&#59; for every step
                he takes in this new path will withdraw him by so much from the evil&#44; and bring
                him unto the proper goal which he should endeavour to reach. But he must not stop
                short be&#8211; fore he has accomplished this duty &#59; he must not relax till he
                has come to the platform which the law points out to him &#59; for without this his
                repentance is not complete&#44; and he has not returned unto the Lord&#44; since he
                has halted on the way&#44; not heeding the dic&#8211; tates of religion which bid
                him to be of good courage and act righteousty&#44; whereas he formerly was the slave
                of sin. In this&#44; therefore&#44; there must be no hesitation&#44; no
                wavering&#58; for by perseverance only can the labour be accomplished&#44; and by
                this only can the love of God be again brought to smile on the sin&#8211; ner&#59;
                since the backsliding will be healed&#44; the wounds of the spirit bound up&#44; the
                bleeding heart be stanched solely by the balm which drops incessantly from the hem
                of the garment which covers the throne of ever&#8211; lasting Mercy. &#8212; Does
                this doctrine of repentance say&#44; that men&#39;s acts deserve grace&#63; By no
                means&#59; it merely teaches that man must do something himself before he can be
                received in favour&#44; nay&#44; before he can be permitted to repent. The law was
                given to all alike&#44; to the guilty no less than the innocent&#59; and whoever
                then truly feels that in duty only there is life&#44; since it is in nothing
                else&#44; must meekly sub&#8211; mit himself to the guidance of God&#44; who will
                receive <pb n="83"/> REGENERATION. 83 in kindness the little which man can do&#44;
                and perfect in his mercy what the mortal can only commence. There is no partiality
                in the heavenly tribunal&#44; each individual there appears as he really is&#44; and
                the fa&#8211; vour which is extended to one will necessarily be shown to all. Were
                it now&#44; that an expiation had been made &#39;for man&#44; other than the gift of
                the law&#44; if the knowledge of this w r ould be requisite to in&#8211; sure
                salvation&#44; and it be yet unknown to the greater portion of mankind &#58; there
                would needs be partiality in the distribution of God&#39;s favour. But if&#44; as we
                contend&#44; by the law man is condemned or justified&#44; and they only are
                punished by its letter who are ac&#8211; quainted with its demands &#58; the wisdom
                of God stands justified&#44; inasmuch as they who know the law cannot plead its
                inconvenience and onerousness as an excuse for their non&#8211;observance of its
                details&#44; seeing that it contains nothing which ordinarily is not within the
                scope of every son of Israel&#44; and there where un&#8211; avoidable necessity
                steps in&#44; the goodness of God will pardon the sin involuntarily committed. If
                every individual does after this manner&#44; if he purifies himself from his
                individual iniquity&#44; he has contributed his share towards the regeneration of
                Israel. Let him not be dismayed at the smallness of the number of the faithful&#59;
                who knows but his ex&#8211; ample may excite others to imitation&#44; and induce
                many to throw themselves penitently before the foot&#8211; stool of mercy&#44; to
                seek like him the favour of the Lord which they have lost by their transgressions.
                It is true that in our day the voice of gain and the desire for pleasure appeal
                loudly to the unthinking crowd to follow the inclination of their own hearts <pb

                time will come when the children of Israel will return and seek the Lord their
                God&#44; and David their king&#59; and still this seeking will have to he brought
                about by the actions of individual Israelites alone. What need is there then to fear
                &#63; is God not able to help &#63; or will his word fail of accomplishment&#63;

                will not be witnessed any more&#59; when there will be but one idea in religion&#44;
                that is&#44; the belief in one God&#59; when but one law will be the guide of all
                mankind&#59; when one king&#44; David&#44; will bear rule on earth&#44; and carry a
                sceptre unstained by oppression&#44; upheld by righteous&#8211; ness&#59; and when
                one worship will unite all the sons of man&#44; who will all resort to the place
                where right&#8211; eous priests shall offer up the sacrifice of purity in the
                precincts of the Omnipresent God &#59; and then all will see the difference between
                the sinner and him who returned from iniquity in Jacob&#44; and worshipped anew the

                tion &#58; let it be also as a sacrifice for the welfare of all Israel&#44; and let
                the holy Jerusalem not be forgotten as one of the things to be prayed for&#44; when
                the re&#8211; turning child claims admission to grace&#44; and asks by prayer&#44;
                to be allowed to enter into the mansion of his heavenly Father. Who knows but the
                Lord may see the heart of many who thus seek Him&#44; and consider this the time to
                withdraw his anger&#59; since He may deem the trials&#44; which his people have
                suffered&#44; sufficient recompense for all the sins they have done. Should even no
                pub&#8211; lic result flow from a sincere repentance&#44; the sinner has done all
                that the Bible demands of him&#59; and though he may fail in one part of his ardent
                wishes&#44; he may silently have laid the foundation for much good after he shall
                have been called away to the re&#8211; ward of his labours. No man lives without a
                good result who has lived well&#44; and no act of righteous&#8211; ness is ever done
                but it bears fruits&#44; no less on earth than in heaven. Arouse yourselves
                then&#44; sons of Israel &#33; whenever the season of repentance comes round in its
                annual circuit&#59; listen to the voice of the Shophar&#44; which is the call to

                to you of the goodness of God and his kindness&#44; that He is good in taking back
                the sinner when he forsakes his way&#44; and kind to the erring&#44; inasmuch as He
                forgives freely the transgres&#8211; sions which are repented of. &#8212; And may
                you daily in&#8211; crease in righteousness&#59; may your faith be hourly more
                confirmed&#44; and may the result of your striving be salvation unto yourselves&#44;
                and glory and peace to Israel&#44; and a united worship of one God for all the vol.

                WITH NOAH. O Eternal One&#44; our Father &#33; Thou who remem&#8211; berest the
                covenant and art true to thy word &#33; receive us when we come before Thee in the
                purity of faith and the singleness of devotion. In olden days when mankind had
                sinned&#44; and the earth had become cor&#8211; rupt in thy presence&#44; Thou didst
                send thy pouring rain and split the fountains of the deep to sweep the of&#8211;
                fending generation from off thy soil&#44; and they perished in their iniquity. But
                knowing the weakness of our frame&#44; Thou hast promised that in no future time
                should the waters become a flood to destroy all flesh&#44; as Thou hadst then caused
                to be done. Do&#44; therefore&#44; our God and King&#33; remember the other covenant
                which Thou hast also sworn by thy truth&#44; that as the promise to Noah should be
                the promise to Israel&#44; that neither should Jacob&#39;s sons be cut off from
                among the nations&#44; nor the children of Adam be swept from the earth. In both
                these gracious promises thy truth has hitherto not wavered&#44; and we see with

                and in reverence we search the words of thy law&#44; the testimony
                unimpeachable&#44; the wisdom unapproachable which prove that Thou art God&#44; and
                we thy chosen servants on the face of the earth. &#8212; Guide&#44; therefore&#44;
                our spirit in the path of truth&#44; pre&#8211; serve our feet from stumbling&#44;
                that our redeemed souls may unceasingly praise thy Name&#44; from eternity to
                eternity. Amen. Brethren &#33; In all that the Lord does He has a fixed end in
                view&#44; which is the object of his action. Man may at times act from caprice&#44;
                from the impulse of the mo&#8211; ment&#44; or may be urged by circumstances to do
                what is counter to his inclination. Far is this from the nature of the
                Omnipotent&#59; He is not actuated by ca&#8211; price&#44; for all his ways are
                just&#59; he acts not from the impulse of the moment&#44; for his are the wisdom and
                the counsel&#44; and He knows the sources of events &#59; nor can He be made to do
                aught urged by circumstances counter to his inclination&#44; for He alone in his
                might is one and powerful above all&#44; and who can say to Him&#44; &#34; What
                doest Thou &#63;&#34; In truth&#44; with Him there is the abode of light&#44; and He
                needs no prompting to stimulate Him to do what is righteous&#44; nor can aught that
                exists move Him from the path of even&#8211;handed justice with which his providence
                governs all exist&#8211; ence. The Scriptures&#44; it is true&#44; occasionally
                employ expressions which&#44; in fact&#44; are only applicable to man &#59; so we
                are told that &#34; God was grieved in his heart&#34; <pb n="88"/> 88 THE COVENANT
                WITH NOAH. at the misconduct of the human race&#44; and He says&#44; &#34; For I
                repent that I have made them &#59;&#34; but we must take these expressions only&#44;
                as we have said on a previous occasion&#44; as pointing out to us results which in
                man would proceed from grief&#44; disappointment&#44; and regret&#44; which emotions
                nevertheless are not found in the Deity&#44; since his essence is too pure to be
                af&#8211; fected by the accidents which afflict humanity. God had made man in his
                divine image &#59; this man was a creation of great importance and a wonder in
                himself&#59; according to human phraseology therefore he must have been of great
                interest to the Lord from the very circumstances attending on his creation. This
                being&#44; though enjoined to be good and to eschew evil&#44; pre&#8211; ferred the
                course of disobedience&#44; totally disregarding the will of God. In man&#44; such a
                failure in his hopes would cause grief and vexation. Again&#44; the nature of sin is
                punishment&#44; and when man chooses to lay hold of transgression&#44; he grasps
                also the attendant sorrow which is inseparably connected with it&#59; in other
                words&#44; &#34;the soul that sinneth must die&#59;&#34; con&#8211; sequently as the
                total destruction of his handiwork would in man betoken that he regretted that he
                had made it&#44; we are also told figuratively&#44; that this likewise took place in
                the mind of God. But it is not necessary to adduce many arguments to prove that the
                Scriptures by employing the phrases we have cited do not mean to ascribe human
                frailties to the Holy One. On the contrary&#44; we are merely pre&#8211; sented with
                a lively image of the ways of Providence&#44; which otherwise would be
                unintelligible to us. Let us attempt an exposition. From the chaos which the Creator
                had called forth in the beginning&#44; the dis&#8211; <pb n="89"/> THE COVENANT WITH
                NOAH. 89 order was removed step by step&#44; as the word of the Most High was sent
                forth on its mission to fashion and to shape every thing&#44; and to endow all
                nature with the mantle of light and beanty. Matter assumed a thousand forms of
                inanimate existence&#44; and millions of plants&#44; with life without motion&#44;
                displayed their Maker&#39;s skill. Animals&#44; the highest and the low r est&#44;
                received organization&#44; life&#44; motion&#44; will &#59; but man alone received
                speech and intellect. To each crea&#8211; ture&#44; however&#44; were given
                time&#44; space&#44; limit&#44; which&#44; if transcended&#44; would destroy the
                form it had received&#59; for so is the will of God&#44; that everything on earth
                shall be destructible by agents which have received power over it. We will not
                particularize to show how the earth&#44; as an inanimate substance&#44; all the
                plants and animals&#44; are subject to this law&#44; but merely revert to the animal
                that has been endowed with soul and speech. In the pow r er of virtue only has he
                strength and permanence&#59; but let vice obtain control over him&#44; and he falls
                at once from the station which his Maker has assigned to him. In other words&#44;
                the beings on earth other than man are destructible by the limits which outward
                nature has set to them&#44; as the sphere in which they must necessarily move &#59;
                man alone&#44; however&#44; has another destroyer assigned to him&#44; because he is
                endowed with an independent will aud an intelligent soul&#44; and this destroyer is
                the do&#8211; minion of unregulated desires&#44; which&#44; implanted in him for the
                wisest of purposes&#44; need the restraint of the limits which religion has assigned
                to them&#44; or else they will&#44; like the material agents which destroy animal
                life&#44; endanger and finally subvert the life of the soul&#44; the immaterial part
                of man. There is&#44; there&#8211; 8* <pb n="90"/> 90 THE COVENANT WITH NOAH.

                failure&#44; disappointment ascribable to God when punishment overtakes sinners
                &#59; since they only meet with the necessary recompense which flows from their own
                conduct&#59; for the condition upon which their state of peace or w r oe depends is
                that they guard the limits which restrain the growth of the evil&#44; and this power
                is given to them&#44; and the responsibility is therefore with the strictest accords
                of justice thrown on themselves. Yet the Lord loves all his creatures&#59; He
                created them for happiness&#44; lie gave them the means of acquiring felicity&#58;
                and as punishment&#44; though to sinners&#44; is a virtual gainsaying of a state of
                exemption from sorrow&#44; we can represent to our&#8211; selves the act of
                chastisement only as a state of grief to the Deity &#59; since as men we cannot
                conceive the perfect goodness of God compatible with necessary punishment&#44;
                without imagining that He lets the evil come with unwillingness on his part. Still
                we do not mean to convey the idea that his mind is thereby subject to that anguish
                which we experience in our course of conduct&#59; for we can only see the
                immedi&#8211; ate effects of our acts &#59; He&#44; the blessed all&#8211;seeing
                One&#44; on the contrary&#44; looks beyond the moment of chas&#8211; tisement to the

                of good which springs from the partial evil will more than compensate to the world
                what the single one has suffered&#44; because he knew the right and preferred the

                enormity of the wrong which has been clone&#59; but we know absolutely nothing of

                of a heinous transgression&#44; and they declare that the let&#8211; ter and spirit
                of Scripture condemn him to an igno&#8211; minious end&#44; and he perishes as a
                criminal&#59; but whilst he dies&#44; his spirit has probably atoned for the sin he
                has committed&#59; the mortal part has been afflicted&#44; but the soul has been
                rendered free through repentance&#44; and contrition&#44; and humility&#44; and the

                than the evil&#44;&#34; history tells a different tale&#59; it relates to us with

                as a chapter in the history of the world&#44; and that no evil was ever witnessed
                which was unaccompanied by good. Let us examine&#44; for instance&#44; the fact of
                the flood&#44; which destroyed all mankind save a single&#44; small family of eight
                persons &#59; the judgment was aw&#8211; ful&#44; transcendently striking in its
                nature and effect. To this day the traces thereof are visible upon the whole
                earth&#44; on the summits of mountains&#44; in the caverns of the valleys. Animals
                which once existed&#44; vast&#44; strong&#44; powerful&#44; are now and then
                disinterred&#44; buried as they are in the solid soil&#44; or covered over with
                towering masses of polar ice. A whole genera&#8211; tion of gigantic men also
                perished&#44; and desolation reigned for an entire year triumphant over a surging
                ocean which covered over the entire habitable globe. Did not in this general
                destruction the work of God fail of its end&#63; Where was there evidence of mercy
                and foresight in this entire wasting&#63; you will ask. But reflect for one moment
                &#58; man was gifted with the freedom of choice between good and evil &#59; no force
                could be laid consistently with human responsibility upon the nature of Adam&#39;s
                sons&#59; and despite of the revelation of God&#39;s will which they had
                received&#44; they forgot all their allegiance to their Maker&#44; and filled the
                earth with violence and a general corruption of morals. Admonition had failed of
                effecting any good&#44; for we have every reason to believe that the pious men of
                those early ages did teach a better course to <pb n="94"/> 94 THE COVENANT WITH

                whom the Lord had raised up among them. A lesson&#44; therefore&#44; was necessary
                to impress upon all future ages of man that responsi&#8211; bility is a necessary
                accompaniment of human actions&#44; and that&#44; when necessary&#44; the masses can
                just as well be reached by divine vengeance as individuals &#59; since He is supreme
                to all&#44; and all are within the reach of his universal power. But all men were
                not indis&#8211; criminately destroyed&#59; for a remnant w T as left to re&#8211;
                people the earth&#44; and he&#44; who had been found&#44; we must believe&#44; alone
                righteous in his generation&#44; w r as constituted the father of a renewed race of
                the sen&#8211; tient beings&#44; to whom the earth had been assigned as their
                habitation &#58; thus proving as always&#44; that there is no judgment without
                cause&#44; and that even in wrath the Lord remembers mercy. &#8212; We shall observe
                in all our investigations&#44; that great lessons are taught but once in the history
                of the world&#44; and that the effect once produced will stand as a warning or
                example to all futurity. And so well adapted are the works of God to this end&#44;
                that the impressions they leave are of that degree of endurance&#44; that no action
                of time can possibly obliterate them. Such are the calling of Abraham&#59; the
                redemption of Israel from Egypt&#59; the public proclamation of the law&#59; the
                conquest of Palestine &#59; the scattering of the sons of Jacob &#59; and so are
                many great events in history &#59; so also was the flood&#44; and so will be the
                final restoration of the Israelites under King David&#44; the anointed of our
                God&#44; and the universal reign of peace and knowledge of the Lord&#44; when the
                warfare of falsehood against truth shall have ceased. It is perhaps different in

                powering&#44; by astounding acts &#59; but it speaks by the sweet sounds of
                persuasion&#44; by the tones of kindness&#44; by the appeals of entreaty and love. A
                thousand sources of joy are offered to each man &#59; the earth brings him
                fruit&#44; the trees are loaded for him with blossoms and a plentiful increase &#59;
                the skies wear for him the gorgeous livery of the brilliant rising of the sun and
                the effulgence of his setting&#59; the sight is ravished with beauty wherever it
                turns&#59; the ear drinks in sweet sounds from millions of fountains of harmony&#44;
                and the taste is gratified&#44; and the smell excited by innumerable objects which
                administer to their wants. Law and revelation too speak to him in a different voice
                from that with which they address multitudes &#59; for they appeal to his
                helplessness when unprotected&#44; without a knowledge of a Gocl&#44; without a
                certainty of his ways with man &#59; they show him how utterly insignificant the
                wisest&#44; the strongest&#44; the richest&#44; and the best must always be without
                the co&#8211;operation of their fellow&#8211;men. To man&#44; as such&#44;
                therefore&#44; the lesson is constantly repeated that he is accountable to God and
                man for whatever he does&#59; that he cannot live without the worship of a God&#44;
                that he cannot exist without the mutual kindness to and from his
                fellow&#8211;creatures. If he now errs&#44; the thunderbolt of destruction is not
                hurled upon his defenceless head&#59; the Lord does not withdraw his kindness from
                him&#44; leaving him exposed to the at&#8211; tacks of evil which he may not be able
                to combat&#59; but He sends admonition alter admonition&#44; and waits <pb n="96"/>

                death&#44; that he may repent perhaps and forsake the evil. The doors of repentance
                are never closed&#44; and the hand of Mercy is always stretched out from heaven to
                lift up to its blessed abode whomever is willing to enter its portals through means
                of righteousness and amend&#8211; ment. &#8212; So are the blessings sent to man
                always of an individual nature&#59; they come not in masses&#59; but day by day he
                experiences the renewed bounty of his heavenly Father&#44; who constantly provides
                for&#44; con&#8211; tinually watches over him. Man&#44; moreover&#44; is not
                alone&#44; and therefore would not alone be the sufferer&#44; were he to be suddenly
                struck clown by punishment when he sins. There are a wife and children&#44;
                per&#8211; haps&#44; who need his care&#59; there may be numerous dependents&#44;
                who through him obtain their daily bread&#59; nay&#44; there may be a ramification
                of good which springs from his labours by which much hap&#8211; piness may be
                scattered abroad&#44; though he himself be unconscious of this. Mercy therefore
                waits&#44; and the arm of Justice is stayed&#44; till he is ripe for the
                visita&#8211; tion which is sure approaching. &#8212; But with nations&#44; though
                the warnings too are gradual&#44; though their approach is foreshadowed by a
                thousand precursory events which demonstrate that the evil is sure in its
                coming&#44; the punishments as well as the blessings partake of something that may
                be called a totality&#44; that is&#44; they affect the masses as such&#44; not as
                composed of individuals&#59; for in national events the man is lost amidst the
                people&#44; and though his own conduct may neither deserve the evil&#44; nor on the
                other hand the good&#44; he must suffer or will be blessed with the re&#8211;

                nor exult at his especial good fortune&#59; since his fate is indissolubly bound up
                with that of those around him. This at once accounts for the fact we have
                stated&#44; that national lessons stand forth in the pages of his&#8211; tory as
                strongly marked and distinct whenever they occur&#59; and thus is their nature&#44;
                that they leave their traces not alone upon the generations when they occur&#44; but
                they transmit them&#44; too&#44; to after&#8211;ages&#44; and the good and the evil
                which were sent as lessons to man&#8211; kind&#44; now constitute a mass of evidence
                of God&#39;s rule on earth&#44; which the most obdurate unbelief cannot fail to
                acknowledge as beyond the power of mere or&#8211; dinary events of nature to effect.
                They are therefore instantaneous in their actions&#44; and are tangible&#44;

                in their outward character&#44; whatever spiritual effect they may be designed to
                have upon the mind of mankind. &#8212; Whenever therefore any such event&#44; for
                instance the flood&#44; has taken place&#44; it is no sign of uncertainty in the
                providence of God&#44; should He declare to us that this occurrence should never

                power&#44; and that from his grasp no sinner can escape. What Ave have advanced
                will&#44; I trust&#44; be a sufficient commentary on the contents of chapters six
                and seven of Genesis&#44; where we are told how the sinning of the early generations
                of men doomed the whole race to a sudden and awful destruction. From the time that
                the decree went forth till its final accomplishment was one hundred and twenty
                years&#59; there can be no doubt&#44; that Noah was certified during this long
                period of the impending storm&#44; and that he admonished his unbelieving
                contemporaries to beware of the sure&#8211; coming danger. But when were prophets
                heeded&#44; whilst the passions heaved within and convulsed the human soul&#63;
                &#8212; So was the early prophet also disre&#8211; garded&#44; and when the time had
                arrived&#44; the visita&#8211; tion in all its tearfulness came with appalling
                sud&#8211; denness and violence &#59; and the Bible&#44; in elucidating this
                event&#44; says &#34; that God was grieved in his heart&#44; and had repented that
                He had made man &#59; but that the righteous Noah had found grace in his sight.&#34;
                You now understand&#44; brethren&#44; that the course of events is merely
                represented to us in human phrase&#8211; ology&#44; to explain to us the operations
                of the divine Mind&#44; not to assert that these emotions of grief and regret filled
                Him who is all purity and holiness. &#8212; The sin of mankind had set a limit to
                their farther con&#8211; tinuance on earth &#59; there had been made no covenant of
                exemption&#44; and the first announcement to Adam stood good&#44; &#34;For on the
                day thou eatest thereof&#44; thou shalt surely die.&#34; It was therefore the
                compact which united transgression with destruction&#44; which overwhelmed
                Noah&#39;s contemporaries&#44; and they only <pb n="99"/> THE COVENANT WITH NOAH. 99
                met the doom which had been pronounced against them from the beginning. But when

                abode of a single family of men &#58; Provi&#8211; dence decreed that this one

                destruction&#44; no matter how great the trans&#8211; gressions of man should be.
                And thus we are taught in Genesis ix. 11 &#58; &#34; And I will establish my
                covenant with you &#59; and all flesh shall no more be cut off by the waters of the
                flood&#44; and there shall no more be a flood to destroy the earth.&#34; How
                good&#44; how constant is the Lord &#33; Ages have since elapsed&#44; and the earth
                stands unmoved on its foundations&#59; and seasons come and seasons change&#44; and
                there are seed&#8211;time and harvest&#44; and summer and winter&#44; and warm and
                cold&#44; and day and night&#44; whilst mankind do not cease to follow the
                inclinations of their hearts&#44; and seek the ways of sin. And ever and anon the
                rainbow appears&#44; set in the clouds&#44; throwing its radiance athwart the gloom
                of a lowering sky&#44; to prove that the covenant stands unshaken&#44; equally with
                the laws of nature which produce this brilliant play of light as a natural
                phenomenon&#44; soon after the ris&#8211; ing or before the setting of the sun.
                &#34;We have thus a continual theme of thankfulness unto Him who re&#8211; <pb

                word. Yet has He done more for mankind than merely exempt&#8211; ing them from a
                universal death &#59; for He called from amidst mental darkness the patriarch
                Abraham&#44; in whose seed the whole world should at length be blessed. A covenant
                was made with him&#44; that to him and his descendants there should always shine a
                light from amidst the darkness&#44; that is to say&#44; that as a people they should
                never be cut off from the posses&#8211; sion of the law revealed from Sinai&#44; and
                that ulti&#8211; mately all nations should seek this light and serve&#44; like
                Abraham&#39;s sons&#44; the Lord with one accord. Like the first generation of
                men&#44; the Israelites refused to hearken unto the voice of kindness&#44; and they
                were cast out from the land which had been given to them for a possession unto
                everlasting. Since then a part of them returned and dwelt in the cities wherein
                their fathers had dwelt&#59; but renewed sin expelled this rem&#8211; nant
                likewise&#44; and made Israel a second time a stran&#8211; ger among all nations.
                With all this the covenant with Abraham has not been moved&#44; and like the bow in
                the clouds stands the law of God&#44; the immutable sign of the Lord&#39;s goodness
                and truth with us &#59; and amidst all the tribulation to which our captivity has
                exposed us&#44; we have never been utterly forsaken by the helping hand of our
                almighty Father. But this state of trial will also pass away&#44; and the disjointed
                members of Israel which now float upon the ocean of tribulation&#44; urged by every
                wind&#44; assailed by every billow&#44; will amalgamate again at some future
                day&#44; as one homogeneous mass in the ancient land of Pales&#8211; tine&#44; where

                that the flood should not pass again over the earth &#59; and so shall the favour of
                God ever shine to Israel&#44; and his face will not be hid again from them. &#8212;
                This will be at the coming of the son of David&#44; when the creation of man after
                God&#39;s image&#44; and the calling of Abraham from Ur in Chal&#8211; dea will see
                their real accomplishment&#59; and then all sons of man will see that God is

                man that He should deceive&#44; and not a mortal that He should repent &#59; and
                then also will ascend to his throne prayers from pure hearts&#44; and an unceasing
                smoke of sacrifices of righteousness will arise from his altar&#44; and his name

                rather to speak more correctly&#44; sources of sin&#44; the one most productive in
                its pestilential fruits is ingratitude. It steels the heart against emotions of
                thankfulness&#44; it inducts pride into the chambers of the soul&#44; and poisons
                the springs whence issue the acts of man. When one feels not love for him from whose
                kindness he has been assisted&#44; from whose bounty he has been fed &#58; what can
                urge him to be for&#8211; bearing when excited by wrath&#44; or to be kind to those
                who appeal to his beneficence and bounty &#63; He him&#8211; self thinks not that
                benefits received are a claim to confer a recompense upon the benefactor &#59; hence
                he slights those who have served him&#44; and he cares not to be the friend to
                others&#44; seeing that he must expect in and from others the same traits and the
                same treat&#8211; ment others find in him. Were it that such a sel&#8211; fishness
                could confer even a qualified species of hap&#8211; piness upon its victim&#44; we
                might perhaps pardon it as an evidence of human weakness&#59; but it is in no wise a
                source of happiness&#59; for the ungrateful person is always dissatisfied with
                himself&#44; and constantly finds his pride checked when firmly resisted by those
                who have obliged him&#44; or slighted by those on whom he conceives himself to have
                the claim of favours con&#8211; ferred. For his own part he feels nothing that

                gray hairs&#44; derides their wrinkles&#44; and spurns from his dwelling those who
                bore with his infirmities&#44; and leaves those to the cold charities of the world
                who sacrificed sleep and comfort&#44; that he in his hour of sorrow might not lack
                for all that could administer to his wants&#44; and promote his recovery. &#8212;
                And should a man&#44; who feels not the throb of gratitude&#44; honour his God&#63;
                Can it be possible that he&#44; who forgets the benefits which his earthly parents
                have heaped upon him&#44; remembers the Author of his being&#44; though it is his
                bounty that feeds him&#44; and it is his world in which he lives &#63; No&#44;
                no&#44; ingratitude is incompatible with religion &#59; and the sacred germ of love
                for God cannot take root in the heart which is oblivious of kindness&#44; which
                values nothing that does not prospec&#8211; tively administer to its material
                interest and tangible gain. And what is it at length that impels the hum&#8211;

                interest and fear &#63; It is the con&#8211; sciousness that there is a Being who in
                love and mercy created all&#44; that each creature might have joy and hap&#8211;
                piness in its own proper sphere&#44; that to Him we can render no recompense save
                obedience&#44; and that by this obedience we thus satisfy the noblest principle of
                our nature&#44; the esteem and gratitude of the enlightened spirit towards its

                act that militates against religion &#59; there may be another religion which
                represents God as always paying some tangible good for every act of obedience&#59;
                but these two species&#44; though they are very proper in the incipient state&#44;
                when the soul is first awakened to a sense of its duty towards God&#44; when his
                justice and bountifulness are good incentives to a strict line of duty&#58; still
                not such motives can make us acceptable to the Most High&#44; since religion&#44;
                which has no better basis than blind terror or parsimonious self&#8211;interest&#44;
                is not apt to stand the shock of adverse circumstances&#44; when counter&#8211;
                vailing combinations may perhaps drown the voice of fear or overbalance the dictates
                of gain&#44; either spiritual or temporal&#44; which one expects from a pur&#8211;
                suit of religion. &#8212; Yes&#44; we are commanded in Scrip&#8211; ture to love the
                Lord our God. But what is love &#63; attachment&#44; a kindness of sentiment which
                draws dif&#8211; ferent beings together in one bond of union. Again&#44; what can be
                the feeling which should produce this love in man towards God&#63; nothing but a
                sense of gratitude for the benefits which are heaped on him every day of his
                existence. Turn we where we will&#44; we must discover motives of gratitude in the
                thou&#8211; sands of wise provisions which are made for our well&#8211; being and

                they possess what he in his arrogance believes to be his proper share of worldly
                goods. Should he on the other hand be wealthy and powerful&#44; and assume that he

                of God which points out to us clearly the path of righteousness which will lead to
                everlasting fe&#8211; licity. Whilst darkness overspread the earth&#44; and nations
                walked in the murky cloud of impenetrable mental gloom&#44; it pleased the Most High
                to send his voice among us&#44; and let his words resound in our ears&#44; that we
                might be instructed by his own glory&#44; and be taught how to avoid the errors
                which lay like a heavy burden upon the souls of other nations. We were not left to
                discover by slow degrees&#44; by painful investiga&#8211; tion&#44; the means which
                would establish a happy gov&#8211; ernment based upon just laws&#59; but the laws
                them&#8211; selves were revealed from on High&#44; from amidst the terrors of a
                glorious descent on Horeb&#44; and the state was established on a basis which has
                become the ad&#8211; miration of after&#8211;ages. In our republic every man had his
                rights secured to him by the fundamental compact on which the state was founded. His
                prop&#8211; erty was his own&#44; which the chief of the government dared not to
                take from him by open violence or secret fraud. His body was free from molestation
                from any other citizen or stranger in the entire length and breadth of the laud&#59;
                and even the courts of justice could not convict him of a crime he had evidently
                committed&#44; unless by the mouth of two credible wit&#8211; nesses. Each man could
                rise to the highest honour&#44; and no extraction from lawful connexions was a
                dis&#8211; grace&#44; though the parents had been the poorest and humblest in the

                that the love of the Most High deserved our gratitude&#44; that the laws He had
                proclaimed demanded our obedience &#58; how happy would we have been &#33; a united

                immut&#8211; able Unity that had created the world. For here every thing called for
                love&#44; every thing spoke of good&#8211; ness&#59; and sorrows &#40;which nations
                too suffer in the rule of a wise Providence&#41; would have been referred to the
                gracious mercy of the Father&#44; who had sent blight upon the corn to admonish
                those who tilled the ground that they had become lax in their devo&#8211; tion&#59;
                who had let a fire devastate a city to instruct its inhabitants that they had not
                been obedient as becomes children of salvation&#59; and each trial would thus have
                resulted in riveting yet closer the bonds of love which united us to the Creator of
                the world. But prosperity came&#44; and we waxed fat and kicked &#59; we were weary
                of the service of Heaven&#44; and made ourselves images&#44; the likenesses of
                things above&#44; on the earth&#44; and in the waters beneath&#59; we bent the knee
                to vanities which have no power to save&#44; and went astray after the desires of
                our hearts to follow in the ways of the gentiles. &#8212; And when admonitions were

                when we were told to reflect on the many benefits we had received as a nation &#58;
                we were too hardened to listen&#44; and the voice of gratitude was silenced in our

                servants in his sanc&#8211; tuary. Therefore did the last of the prophets address
                our fathers in the following words&#44; in the commence&#8211; ment of his
                mission&#58; &#34;I have loved you&#44; saith the Lord&#44; and you have said&#44;

                expostulates with his rebel&#8211; lious countrymen. In no instance&#44; as he says
                in the se&#8211; quel&#44; did it appear that they honoured God as a father&#44; or
                feared Him as a master &#59; they experienced not the emotion of gratitude towards

                by a banishment from their land&#44; and this they fancied as a sign of hardship
                which they ought not to have endured. But says the prophet&#58; &#34;I have loved

                been conferred on this land. It is not many years ago&#44; that a spirit of daring
                and reckless speculation pervaded all classes and sta&#8211; tions. Men wanted to

                a large harvest where nothing had been sown. It was then that a blight fell upon the
                land &#59; the merchant saw his spec&#8211; ulations fail &#59; the supposed wealth
                was reduced to its nothingness&#59; and the very soil seemed to mourn over the
                degeneracy of the people&#59; and the husbandman found his harvest deficient &#59;
                and this vast extent of country&#44; which in other seasons might well be styled the
                granary of the world&#44; became in its turn indebted to foreign lands for the bread
                which we ate&#44; and for the seed which was intrusted to the earth at the time of

                It was therefore&#44; doubtless&#44; as we must judge in analogy with the his&#8211;
                tory of the world&#44; that mercantile reverses and scanty crops were sent as
                providential dispensations&#44; in order to prove to the community&#44; by their own
                experience&#44; that &#34; If the Lord do not build the house&#44; the build&#8211;
                ers thereof labour in vain &#59;&#34; and thus it was that when the curse did
                fall&#44; all the precautions of human foresight were turned to nought&#44; and the
                boldest in the day of prosperity became timid and alarmed in the hour of peril &#59;
                and nearly all enterprise was aban&#8211; doned&#44; as though no more days of
                success would dawn upon the land. And in the homes of the poor there was sorrow&#59;
                the many who depend upon the labour of their hands for the bread they daily eat were
                turned out of their workshops&#44; because those for whom they wrought had no use
                for their labour&#59; and in compulsory idleness was many a willing work&#8211; man
                compelled to waste away the precious time. Soon the little hoard of better days was
                exhausted &#59; and ghastly want then visited the houses of many who by labour had
                always hitherto earned a moderate support&#44; and who only needed employment now to

                Do Thou&#44; then&#44; O Father&#33; hearken unto oar voice&#44; fill our hearts
                with humility&#44; that we may listen to instruction &#59; frustrate the counsel of
                the wicked who dare to lay violent hands upon the sacred ark of the covenant&#59;
                and cause the love of the truth to grow powerful in our hearts&#44; that we may hear
                and ohey&#44; listen and follow the dictates of the religion which Thou&#44; Lord of
                all &#33; hast hestowed as the guiding&#8211;star of Israel&#39;s sons&#44; by which
                alone they can truly serve Thee&#44; Everlasting God &#33; who alone art their
                Creator&#44; who alone art their Father&#44; who alone art their Lawgiver&#44;
                King&#44; and Saviour. Amen. Brethren &#33; Let us recur to the wonder&#8211;working
                power of the Almighty. In a former series of lectures we proved that from analogy we
                must conclude that miracles&#44; as such&#44; though strange and wonderful&#44; are
                by no means impossible&#59; for they are within the scope of divine possibility&#44;
                whatever they may be as regards the power of man. At the same &#34;time we stated
                that a miracle is no attestation of any given truth &#59; but that a thing untrue in
                itself would remain so&#44; notwithstanding a miracle should be wrought&#44; by one
                having the power to do it&#44; in proof thereof. We brought biblical texts to
                exhibit the correctness of these positions&#44; and with this we rested &#59; since
                to Israelites Holy Writ must be and is conclusive argument in all matters of faith
                and duty. We have&#44; therefore&#44; three positions as proved&#58; first&#44;
                miracles are possible to the Divine Power&#59; secondly&#44; such acts have occurred
                when it comported with Supreme Wisdom to produce them &#59; and thirdly&#44;
                miracles are no proof of any thing which <pb n="142"/> 142 ON MIRACLES. contradicts
                the evident words and doctrines of Holy Writ&#44; these being the primary evidence
                of God&#39;s will and his views of truth. Let us now see what is the object of
                producing a miracle&#63; and when does it become necessary to ex&#8211; hibit an act
                against the ordinary course of events &#63; When we cast one look into the regions
                of nature&#44; with all its hidden powers&#44; with all its wonderful
                combinations&#44; we must come to the conclusion&#44; as we have said on a former
                occasion&#44; that nothing can be more miraculous&#44; or&#44; in other words&#44;
                exhibit more the power and greatness of God&#44; than outward nature itself&#59;
                &#34;in his temple all speaketh glory&#44;&#34; and in every point of our inquiry we
                must stand mute and astounded concerning the greatness which we can only adore&#44;
                which we can only view from afar&#44; with&#8211; out diving below the surface of
                what strikes the eye. The powers of nature moreover have received such a
                strength&#44; such an abiding endurance&#44; that they were able to go out upon
                their mission at the commence&#8211; ment of all things&#44; and to continue in
                their action without being diminished in the least&#44; or failing in any one
                instance in their appointment. The night comes whenever the sun disappears&#44; and
                as the earth revolves farther in her orbit the light of day again is spread
                abroad&#44; and the luminary which rules the day scatters around effulgence and
                heat. During the hours of darkness the exhausted vigour of animals and plants is
                renewed&#44; and the light and heat of day quicken and mature whatever germs there
                are im&#8211; planted in the nature of vegetable products and ani&#8211; mated
                beings. At length when every thing has ful&#8211; filled the course assigned to its
                existence&#44; it passes <pb n="143"/> ON MIRACLES. 143 away from amidst the
                living&#44; and its kind is repro&#8211; duced even from the decay which overwhelms
                itself. &#34;We call the change death&#44; we call it destruction&#59; but do we
                understand the manner of this death or de&#8211; struction &#63; are we familiar
                with the avenues of life&#44; where the new existence begins of the thing which
                supplies the place of what has gone before it. And when man passes away&#44; when
                his body moulders in the dust&#44; and his spirit is no longer active on the face of
                the earth &#8212; is his existence then at an end &#63; Does he not rather continue
                to live in a new and purified state where all is bereft of mortality and pain &#63;
                And independently of this&#44; the fruits of the spirit never die. A word is
                spoken&#44; a thought is breathed&#44; and a fire is thereby kindled which never is
                quenched&#59; and they who have lived at the beginning are still felt in the acts of
                remote ages&#44; and the chain of all intelligent beings is so linked by the
                inseparable though invis&#8211; ible connexion which unites all in one&#44; that the
                dis&#8211; coveries&#44; the actions&#44; the words of those endowed with
                intelligence continue&#44; and must continue&#44; to affect the life of thousands
                who are to come after them. It is thus that nature&#44; itself a riddle to us&#44;
                is the greatest proof of the power of God&#44; if even we con&#8211; fine our search
                to the small portion of the world on which we live&#44; the earth namely&#44; which
                has been sub&#8211; jected by divine Providence to the control and habi&#8211;
                tation of man. &#8212; But if we ascend higher&#44; and view the countless worlds
                which revolve on all sides around us&#59; if we consider that all these are the
                works of our Master &#59; and that farther yet than our eye can reach&#44; there are

                are placed &#59; that every where too there is a chain in the existence of things as
                we find it in this earth&#58; &#8212; who will then set limits to the power of the
                Lord&#44; who is Author of all this glory&#44; Master of all this wealth &#63; who
                will say what is within his scope&#63; what He is able to accomplish&#63; Yes&#44;
                the deeper we enter into what the Lord has done&#44; the greater will he our
                reverence for his infinite power&#44; the more ardent will be our veneration for his
                goodness which He manifests&#44; in caring in detail for each and every one of the
                creatures which have sprung from his beneficence and power. But it must be observed
                that reflections like these are not the usual results at which common minds
                ar&#8211; rive &#59; mankind&#44; as such&#44; seldom reflect&#44; and all are
                engaged in their daily toils&#44; in pursuits of pleasure or gain&#44; and enjoy the
                bounties of the Creator with&#8211; out turning their thoughts to consider that it
                is to Him they are indebted for all they have received&#44; and that his Providence
                can resum&#44;e the gifts when&#8211; ever it comports his wisdom to do so. And
                when&#8211; ever an individual acquires wealth&#44; wisdom&#44; or re&#8211;&#39;
                uowii&#44; he blesses himself in his own heart&#44; and says that it is his own

                wisdom&#44; which rendered him famous among the learned&#59; or he ascribed to his

                transmit us the account of the doings of any people but that they ascribed all
                greatness to the enterprise&#44; the sagacity&#44; and the valour of their
                fore&#8211; fathers or of themselves in the pursuit of wealth&#44; of
                intelligence&#44; and of power&#63; How few are there who view the Creator as
                directly rewarding with prosperity those of his children who have found grace in his
                sight&#63; How seldom are hearts overflowing with gratitude even when lips profess
                to utter praises unto the Most High God &#63; How few are there who in sincerity
                feel their dependence and acknowledge themselves servants who should obey their
                Master&#63; children who should listen to their Father&#63; recipients who should
                thank their Benefactor&#63; Ay&#44; in truth&#44; we are so accustomed to be
                witnesses of the power of God&#44; that we fail to remark the won&#8211; ders which
                lie stretched out before us in their infinite variety &#58; we are so used to be
                blessed with his bounty&#44; that we do not feel that we are debtors. But should a
                sudden&#44; or unexpected thing be brought to our no&#8211; tice&#59; should
                something occur of which we have not dreamed of before in our philosophy&#44; the
                case would be materially altered&#59; for then our vision would natu&#8211; rally
                become sharpened and our intellect quickened to discover the source whence this
                event has sprung. But by a parity of reasoning we must come to the conclusion&#44;
                that&#44; if such eveuts were to happen every day they would again&#44; like the
                works of nature&#44; lose their striking effect by the frequency of their
                recur&#8211; rence. We have therefore this position in addition to those we advanced
                above&#44; that a miracle&#44; or an ex&#8211; traordinary and supernatural
                exhibition of the power vol. v. 13 <pb n="146"/> 146 ON MIRACLES. of God may take
                place&#44; if it is intended to teach sud&#8211; denly and strikingly a particular
                lesson&#44; and to pro&#8211; duce a simultaneous effect on the minds of a great
                number of persons&#44; which effect is not to be of a tran&#8211; sient kind&#44;
                but to endure through its strikingness to be productive of consequences&#44; long
                after its exhibi&#8211; tion shall have ceased before the eyes of those who were the
                immediate witnesses. &#8212; Such a miracle is not unworthy of the majesty of
                Heaven. For what is the object of God in his dealings with man&#63; Is it not to
                instruct &#63; to improve &#63; to render happy &#63; &#8212; If the ordinary acts
                of power and goodness&#44; for some cause or the other&#44; do fail of doing this
                &#58; why may not extraordinary acts of grace&#44; which are no more difficult for
                Him than to let the sun shine&#44; be brought forward to develop more clearly his
                omnipotence and his mercy &#63; Let us take an instance &#58; in the begin&#8211;
                ning of the creation we are certified that the Lord&#44; made his will known to the
                first man&#44; after having endowed him with an intelligent soul&#44; and given him
                dominion over all the earth. This being&#44; in despite of this mercy&#44; neglected
                the only command which had been given for his observance&#44; and he incurred the
                di&#8211; vine displeasure by his disobedience. Ages passed on&#44; and the belief
                in the existence of one Supreme&#44; though it had been from time to time recalled
                to the knowl&#8211; edge of man&#44; was fast sinking into utter oblivion in the
                contest waged against it by false ideas of the di&#8211; vine Being&#44; supported
                by the rule of tyrants on earth. How should mankind of their own accord be able to
                arrive again at the sublime truth which is the founda&#8211; tion of pure
                religion&#63; You will perhaps say&#44; that the progress of civilization would have
                caused this. <pb n="147"/> ON MIRACLES. 147 But herein you would be mistaken. For if
                the high&#8211; est perfection in architecture and the kindred arts is an evidence
                of high civilization&#44; Egypt&#44; Babylon&#44; Greece&#44; and Rome&#44; must
                have stood high in the scale of mental culture&#58; and still&#44; though the
                arts&#44; and sciences&#44; and refinement had progressed from small beginning to a
                glorious exaltation&#44; the idea of a mul&#8211; titudinous crowd of divinities was
                the prevailing sen&#8211; timent in all these countries &#59; absurdities&#44; which
                no child would now believe in&#44; were the themes of phi&#8211; losophers&#44;
                orators&#44; and poets&#59; and what is more&#44; the more the knowledge of these
                people was extended&#44; the more triumphs they achieved in the arts&#44; the
                greater became the number of their idols&#44; the greater became the number of
                temples&#44; of images&#44; of statues&#44; which they erected to their
                abominations. Some few&#44; no doubt&#44; had a suspicion that their system was
                false&#44; their ideas of the Deity Terroneous &#59; because they must have
                perceived things&#44; which their own hands had made&#44; were not able to lend any
                aid to those who had hewn them out of stone&#44; or fashioned them out of wood&#44;
                or had molten them out of metals. And there where the grossest idolatry did not
                prevail&#44; men wor&#8211; shipped the host of heaven&#44; and bowed down to the
                sun&#44; and the moon&#44; and the stars&#44; the works merely of the great Creator.
                Again&#44; if these too had suspected that there must be a Being greater&#44;
                higher&#44; holier yet than the objects of their worship &#58; how could they have
                arrived at the truth&#59; without a painful&#44; slow&#44; and uncertain course of
                reflection&#44; which after all must have died away with them&#44; as had done the
                first knowledge of God which mankind had received&#63; We now wish to ask of every

                Deity to work such deeds as should fix the knowledge of his being per&#8211;
                manently&#44; indelibly upon the minds of mankind&#44; so that in no future age the
                progress of debasement should ever blot out his worship from the heart of his
                creatures &#63; &#8212; Surely it was every way worthy of his benignity to do so
                &#59; for He&#44; who gives life to all that exists &#59; who feeds all creatures
                with his bounty &#59; who gives them understanding in things which concern their
                physical wants&#44; must hold it worthy to impart to them that which will invigorate
                their souls with those elevating thoughts which will accompany them&#44; like a
                protecting shield&#44; through the joys and sorrows of life&#44; even unto its
                termination by the palsying arm of death. That this event took place&#44; that this
                great wonder was witnessed&#44; we are told in the Bible&#44; and this is enough as
                evidence that it did occur&#59; and what is more we feel that this is actually true.
                For look&#44; I pray you&#44; upon the state of our ancestors when they left Egypt
                &#58; they had been slaves for about two cen&#8211; turies&#44; treated with the
                most malignant cruelty&#44; so that they even would not listen to God&#39;s
                messenger because &#34; of the heavy labour &#59;&#34; they had been bru&#8211;
                talized almost by a constant intercourse with the coarsest idolatry &#59; yet these
                were the very men&#44; who all at once became a nation endowed with a wisdom&#44;
                with laws&#44; with a conception of divine things to which centuries have not been
                able to add one single&#44; soli&#8211; tary idea. It is no boast&#44; it is no idle
                vaunting&#59; the words &#34;I am the Lord thy God&#44;&#34; and &#34; Hear&#44;

                subsequent deeds of power&#44; but confirmatory of the august cove&#8211; nant&#59;
                and the permanency thereof has been proved in all ages&#44; even to this hour&#44;

                impossible to separate the ideas so distinctly as we might wish. But let us consider
                the subject w T e wish to elucidate without far&#8211; ther preface. Persons who
                affect to disbelieve the history of the Bible have asked&#44; &#34; Why does not God
                produce miracles now&#44; at this very clay &#63; why are we referred to the dark
                ages of antiquity for proofs of his greatness&#63;&#34; We will attempt to answer.
                We have already stated above&#44; that if miracles were of daily recurrence&#44;
                they would excite our attention to no greater degree than the equally wonderful
                phenom&#8211; ena of nature&#44; which have no attraction to the casual
                observer&#44; and fail to impress the learned even with the exalted ideas of the
                being of God which their 13* <pb n="150"/> 150 ON MIRACLES. greatness ought to call
                forth. It is therefore in the nature of extraordinary events that they should
                hap&#8211; pen hut at great intervals of time&#44; although&#44; when they do
                occur&#44; they may follow elose upon each other&#44; so as to produce the effect
                which is desired of them. And when once the effect has been produced&#44; it would
                he an idle parade of irresistible power to exhibit mir&#8211; acles which could have
                no useful result. Now exam&#8211; ine the Bible and see when did the miracles
                recorded take place&#63; Always when the religion of Heaven needed confirmation&#44;
                or to keep alive those who had been delegated as its depositaries. After the
                crea&#8211; tion we have no record of any miracles&#44; if we leave out the evident
                revelation which Adam and Cain re&#8211; ceived&#44; till the days of Noah. Then we
                have the flood&#44; the great lesson to prove to the world that mankind&#44; as
                such&#44; are responsible to God for all their deeds&#44; and this took place when
                all had forsaken the law they had received. Again was the world without signs&#44;
                till the speech of men was confounded&#44; when they en&#8211; deavoured to
                counteract the will of God. &#8212; Darkness soon after began to prevail over all
                the earth&#59; and then too commenced the building up of the true faith&#44; through
                the calling of Abraham. But with the ex&#8211; ception of the revelation vouchsafed
                to him&#44; and the answers to his prayers&#44; there was no miracle wrought in his
                days or that of his immediate successors&#44; unless it be the destruction of Sodom
                and its accompanying circumstances&#44; and the birth of Isaac. But when the people
                of Abraham was ripe by its education for the reception of the law&#44; the
                manifestation of the divine glory became evident and frequent&#44; in order to build
                up that faith which was to endure forever. But after <pb n="151"/> OH MIRACLES. 151
                the redemption of the people from Egypt they had to undergo a long and constant
                schooling to root out from their hearts the love of idols to which they so
                pertinaciously clung&#59; and it was only after a grad&#8211; ual slaying of a whole
                generation through a forty years wandering in the wilderness&#44; that a nation of
                true worshippers was established. &#44; After the death of Moses but few miracles
                are recorded &#59; but they were of that kind to demonstrate to the Israelites&#44;
                young Israel as we might call them&#44; that the Providence which had redeemed their
                fathers did not slumber&#44; and that it had not forsaken them with the demise of
                their great teacher. Years passed on&#44; and the ex&#8211; ample of surrounding
                nations&#44; and the proneness of the human heart to sin caused our fathers to fall
                off from the service of the Lord&#44; They were then yet comparatively new in their
                calling&#44; the truth had yet scarcely dawned upon the world without&#59; and
                occa&#8211; sionally during the space of four hundred years a striking deed of
                divine power proved to the people of Israel and the enemies who oppressed them&#44;
                that the religion of Sinai was under the special protection of the Most High&#44;
                the Creator&#44; and that neither the shi&#8211; llings of its professors&#44; nor
                the triumph of their ad&#8211; versaries should be able to wipe out its memory from
                the seed of Jacob. Read for yourselves&#44; brethren&#44; and you will be convinced
                that the books of Judges and Samuel record miracles only at the very moment&#44;
                when the degeneracy of the times had brought about the necessity of a striking
                illustration of the divine power&#44; and upon no other occasion. &#8212; After this
                a house was erected as the special residence of the divine glory &#58; and should
                not the Lord manifest his <pb n="152"/> 152 ON MIRACLES. presence among his people
                by some tangible demon&#8211; stration that He dwelt indeed in the midst of
                them&#63; This structure however was scarcely finished&#44; before the Israelites
                became careless of their happiness&#44; and they fell upon the ways of idolatry&#44;
                and the land was defiled with their abominations. Beligion was now threatened with
                its greatest enemy&#59; for we were a people yielding themselves to
                voluptuousness&#44; with a government fanning the embers of apostacy. It was
                therefore that the servants of the Lord were empow&#8211; ered to do great
                things&#44; and to counteract&#44; by the potent spell they had received&#44; the
                wickedness and the daring which prevailed around them. Yet these miraculous men were
                few&#44; and their acts exceedingly limited&#59; still when Elijah had proved that
                the God who answered with fire was indeed the God&#44; the peo&#8211; ple fell upon
                their faces&#44; and exclaimed&#44; &#34; The Lord is the God&#44; the Lord is the
                God &#33;&#34; Indeed this was a second manifestation of the glory of the Most
                High&#44; and Carmel became&#44; in a minor degree&#44; to the assem&#8211; bly
                which met there at the test&#8211;sacrifice of the pro&#8211; phet called the
                Tishbite&#44; what Sinai had been so emi&#8211; nently to the whole people under the
                guidance of the son of Amram. Since the days of Elijah very few miracles are
                recorded&#44; and these were chiefly those of his immediate successor&#44; the son
                of Shaphat&#44; who nursed the declining flame of faith under several apostate kings
                &#59; the cure of Ilezekiah &#59; and the saving of the three Israelites who had
                been cast into the fiery furnace for the sake of the upholding of their faith&#44;
                and the miracles recorded of Daniel&#44; all calculated to demonstrate to the
                captives and their rulers that the ancient faith was yet the favourite of Heaven.
                With <pb n="153"/> ON MIRACLES. 153 these events the miracles have ceased&#44; and
                with them&#44; too&#44; the necessity for them has terminated&#44; as far as Israel
                was concerned. The religion of Moses had been promulgated under great signs&#59;
                those who divinely inspired taught doctrines in conformity with the law&#44; they
                who are known as prophets&#44; seers&#44; and those endowed with the holy Spirit all
                approved their mission&#44; whenever the case demanded it&#44; by the exhi&#8211;
                bition of deeds beyond the ordinary power of man to accomplish. With the building of
                the second temple the love for idolatry was forever banished from Israel. Just as
                the last words of the later prophets died away&#44; when the spirit of prophecy was
                to be silenced for many centuries &#58; the mission of Abraham&#44; of Moses&#44; of
                David and their associates was completed for Israel&#59; the law and its doctrines
                had been expounded and enlarged by the prophets&#44; its spirit was breathing in the
                Psalms&#44; the Proverbs&#44; and Job &#59; its soul was speak&#8211; ing in the
                songs and lamentations&#59; its application was carried out under Ezra&#44;
                INehemiah&#44; in Esther&#44; Daniel&#44; and Ecclesiastes&#44; as before in the
                earlier his&#8211; torians&#44; and it became henceforward part and parcel of our
                being. The Scriptures were thus ours by in&#8211; heritance and right of
                possession&#59; and dominion was given unto us forever to study the Word&#44; and to
                reg&#8211; ulate our life by its commandments. Where was then occasion for farther
                manifestation of the miraculous power &#63; what new thing was to be fixed in our
                heart&#63; That for which the miracles had been wrought had been aud yet is
                affirmed&#44; and they had thus answered the whole purpose of their creation&#44;
                equally with the world&#44; the entire universe which the Lord had called into
                being. <pb n="154"/> 154 ON MIRACLES. Yet say&#44; Is not the preservation of Israel
                a stand&#8211; ing miracle &#63; The destructive action of man upon the things of
                external nature has not been more per&#8211; severing&#44; than that of mankind at
                large against the law of Moses and its followers. We need not to en&#8211; large
                upon this &#58; yon all know it&#44; you all have felt it. But as the works of
                nature stand unmoved&#44; though destruction of particles thereof is constantly
                going forward &#58; so does Israel stand upright&#44; unshaken&#44; un&#8211;
                destroyed and indestructible&#44; though a thousand ene&#8211; mies constantly
                assail its ranks&#44; and bear off individual apostates to their standard. &#8212;
                Ay&#44; the miracle is of daily recurrence&#59; but is it therefore less a miracle
                &#63; And we have ever proclaimed the unity of God&#44; have declared that in that
                faith we will live&#44; that in that faith we will die. And has not the blessing of
                God been with us&#44; and strengthened our resolve&#63; fortified our souls in the
                moment of trial&#44; on the day of peril&#63; What more could a thousand miracles
                do&#44; were they to be wrought now &#8212; this day &#8212; this moment &#8212;
                before our eyes&#63; They too would be transient&#44; for this is the nature of
                things&#59; and the lesson would have to be repeated from day to day without
                intermission&#44; and thus miracles would cease to be miracles from the very
                necessity of the terms. No&#44; my friends &#33; Israelites require no miracles
                &#59; their very existence&#44; their very law arc facts&#44; the pro&#8211; duce of
                supernatural manifestations&#44; which to them prove a call to godliness&#44; which
                reclaim them ever and anon when they swerve from the path of truth. Yes&#44; let us
                be sinning&#44; ever so grievously &#58; the law stands unshaken&#44; a sign and a
                testimony against us&#59; and there never will be wanting those who&#44; feeling <pb

                round them followers ready to cling with renewed affection to the doctrines of the
                Most High. But one thing more and we have done for this day. No more than the spirit
                of God is extinct because it speaks no longer through the prophets&#44; is the power
                of the Lord abridged to work his will in all the world. The prophetic fire is but
                dormant&#44; it will blaze forth again to enlighten the world&#59; equally so is the
                mirac&#8211; ulous power only hidden to astonish the more&#44; when the time to
                remember Zion shall come. &#8212; Israel has been taught to know the Lord &#59; but
                the gentiles yet walk in darkness&#44; they worship not the universal Fa&#8211;
                ther&#44; whom Moses proclaimed in his glorious mission. Shall it be&#44; that the
                light shall never be theirs&#63; that the works of God shall always be wanting in
                perfec&#8211; tion &#63; Far be this &#8212; it cannot be. &#8212; But as we have
                been taught&#44; so shall the whole earth be instructed&#59; truth will spring from
                the ground&#44; and righteousness will look down from heaven&#59; and on that day
                mira&#8211; cles will be summoned forth to prove to all that the Lord reigns&#44;
                and that his alone is the dominion. But this too will be by means of a
                messenger&#44; one whom God will send &#59; again his servants will be foremost
                amongst nations&#44; glorious as the sons who call Him Father. Thus will be
                fulfilled the words of the pro&#8211; phet &#58; &#34;Like on the day of thy going
                out from Egypt&#44; will I show him wonders.&#34; Micah vii. 15. <pb n="156"/> 156

                smote all first&#8211;born and executed judg&#8211; ment upon the abominations of
                that land. When will this be &#63; No eye of man has seen the end&#44; it is buried

                lengthening as the day advances &#59; one error sweeps away the error which
                pre&#8211; ceded it&#59; until at length&#44; the fallacy of all things not
                springing from the inspiration of God will be proved. It will be then that all flesh

                accompanied the promulgation of the law&#44; and among other matters it is stated
                that&#44; to initiate the people in the newly given religion&#44; Moses sacrificed a
                number of steers as burnt and peace&#8211;offerings&#44; and divided the blood in
                two portions&#44; the one he sprin&#8211; kled as is usual with all sacrifices upon
                the altar&#44; and the other half he employed to consecrate the people
                themselves&#44; so to say&#44; making their bodies a sanctuary of the Lord&#44;
                after reading to them the book of the covenant&#44; which they faithfully promised

                to others what you expect of them.&#34; The sensualist would answer&#44; whatever
                administers to our pleasures is good&#44; whatever is disagreeable is evil. Others
                would find a reply each to suit his own pecu&#8211; liar views &#59; but all&#44;
                basing their opinions upon mere human invention&#44; would agree on this point&#44;
                that man&#39;s own reason is able to point out to him the true system of
                accountability. But it must be self&#8211;evident&#44; that a guide which points out
                so many different roads&#44; all professiug to lead to the desired object&#44;
                cannot be such a one as an inquirer after truth could follow with any degree of
                safety &#59; since he cannot know before&#8211; hand what result&#44; in so far as
                he is himself concerned&#44; will follow from the course of action indicated by the
                vague and uncertain monitor which he is told to con&#8211; fide in. If this human
                reason were therefore the only principle of action&#44; man could not be held
                accounta&#8211; ble for his deeds &#59; because this impelling motive is more or
                less extended in different individuals&#44; and is accordingly no uniform standard
                of conduct&#44; or it is <pb n="160"/> 160 THE COVENANT AT IIOREB. swayed by
                circumstances which warp the judgment of those even who are equally endowed. But it
                needs no argument to establish the fact that&#44; without respon&#8211;
                sibility&#44; mankind would be more unmanageable than the lower animals &#59; for
                being endowed with reason&#44; cunning&#44; and artifice&#44; each one would employ
                his nat&#8211; ural gifts to advance his own ends regardless of the rights and
                wishes of others&#44; unless he were restrained by the brute force of another. There
                might be in&#8211; deed occasions when moved by pity he would yield to the entreaty
                of a fellow&#8211;man and forego his own will&#59; but should his passions be
                aroused&#44; and the weaker party appeal to his mercy at the moment of his violent
                indignation&#44; no remorse would withhold him from wreaking his vengeance upon the
                offender who is subject to his power. No&#44; the peace of society&#44; the welfare
                of each individual&#44; necessarily demand that every man should be accountable to a
                higher Power for all his acts&#44; be they trifling or important&#44; and that the
                sense of this accountability should be universally impressed upon the mind of
                mankind. And it must be evident to every one who thinks that&#44; inasmuch as all
                created things owe their existence to the same creative Energy&#44; all men must
                have received a uniform standard by which they are able to ascer&#8211; tain the
                measure of their accountability&#44; and that&#44; if there be any who are without
                this knowledge&#44; such as these will not&#44; as a matter of course&#44; be
                amenable for the acts by which those actually informed would be punishable. The
                question now arises&#58; &#34;If hu&#8211; man reason is not the measure of right
                and wrong&#44; whore shall we look for it&#63;&#34; To you&#44; brethren&#44; who
                are acquainted with the wisdom of God as displayed <pb n="161"/> THE COVENANT AT
                HOREB. 161 in his word&#44; the answer presents itself without any promptings from
                me&#59; for you know that though your own reason&#44; when unassisted&#44; gropes in
                the darkness of uncertainty&#44; it is&#44; when under the guidance of the law of
                God&#44; fully able to distinguish between right and wrong&#44; and is by this means
                enabled so to act as to obtain the approbation of Heaven. The Lord has not left us
                to uncertainty as to what the path of right&#8211; eousness is&#44; but has provided
                for us the record of his will&#44; out of which we can at all times and under every
                circumstance ascertain how we are to deport our&#8211; selves towards Ilim as our
                Maker&#44; and how we are to act to our neighbour as our fellow&#8211;man &#59;
                since in this record we are correctly informed of our relation to our Creator and to
                all those&#44; who like ourselves have received at his hands the same wonderful
                organiza&#8211; tion of body and soul which we discover in ourselves. To those&#44;
                however&#44; who are not acquainted with the book of the will of God&#44; the search
                must be painful indeed&#59; since at every step during their existence they must
                discover&#44; at once&#44; that their mind lacks a development which of itself it is
                not able to reach&#44; and by every new idea acquired by experience or self&#8211;
                examination&#44; they are the more strongly reminded&#44; that human invention&#44;
                however extended and varied&#44; must stop very far short of perfection. We&#44;
                however&#44; who have during so many ages fairly&#8211; rioted in the luxury of the
                divine light&#44; have long since ceased to feel almost that it is a great blessing
                which we have received&#44; and how exalted a lot has been assigned to us by the
                bestowal of the code given to Moses. We are born of parents who have them&#8211;
                selves grown up in its knowledge&#44; and their very 14* <pb n="162"/> 162 THE
                COVENANT AT HOREB. thoughts are tinctured with the inspiration of the Law&#59; and
                we also grow up&#44; and imperceptibly drink with every day of our life more and
                more at the re&#8211; freshing fountain &#59; and when we stand forward in the pride
                of manhood&#44; with intellect expanded and our will fortified by the strength of
                virtue vouchsafed to us from the book of revelation &#58; we are but too apt to
                ascribe the victory to ourselves&#44; and to be unmindful of the humiliating
                confession that this too is a gift for which we ought to be thankful to the Author
                of all. But not alone ourselves are unconsciously blessed by this treasure&#59; for
                all other men who delight in the possession of civilization&#44; of sciences&#44;
                and of morality&#44; are indebted to the same source that we are &#59; since from us
                the knowledge of a pure morality has gradu&#8211; ally spread from the small
                commencement of the same in the plain of Chaldfea under Abraham&#39;s teach&#8211;
                ing&#44; until now it covers with its sway the mightiest nations of the earth. What
                matters it that they deny the source&#63; what need we care that the indebtedness to
                us is not acknowledged&#63; enough that we know that&#44; humble as we are&#44; we
                have become the benefac&#8211; tors of the world&#44; and that from us as a centre
                has spread that light&#44; which the most exalted philosophers of ancient times were
                utterly unable to reach by their own unassisted studies. This being so&#44; it is
                but proper that we should have means presented to us&#44; which shall always remind
                us&#44; for our own sakes&#44; that it was not our intellect which has acquired for
                us the spiritual treasures of the law&#44; but that it is the highest Wisdom that
                has imparted them to us. This at once presents us with some co&#8211; gent reasons
                why the Almighty thought proper to <pb n="163"/> THE COVENANT AT HOHEB. 163 let the
                announcement of his will be so muoh distin&#8211; guished by a superabundant display
                of his glory. It was&#44; namely&#44; his object not to let the discoveries of moral
                truths be the work of ages&#44; by which means they would have been ascribed to
                human ingenuity&#44; but to shower them down&#44; as it were&#44; in one day&#44;
                like a fertilizing rain&#44; upon a thirsty world&#44; whereby He wished to show
                that He alone was the Author of the statutes and ordinances of his law&#44; in order
                that no man should exalt himself above his fellows by an&#8211; nouncing these to
                them as his own discoveries. The Creator of our souls thus became our instructor and
                guide &#59; and by this means&#44; having shown us what are our duties on earth&#44;
                He justly renders us accountable to Him for every act of oar life. To Him&#44;
                therefore&#44; we are to look in our endeavours to understand our line of duty&#44;
                or&#44; what is the same&#44; we are to study carefully the book which He has
                written&#44; so that we. may be wise in the knowledge of the divine truths there
                recorded. But when our fathers came from Egypt&#44; they were unused to the rule of
                the law of Heaven &#59; they had been steeped in the filth of idola&#8211; try&#44;
                and had learned of the ways of the heathen na&#8211; tion in the midst of which they
                had dwelt. Their mind was thus warped&#44; and yielded unwillingly to the new yoke
                which was to be imposed on it. Still it was requisite&#44; in divine Providence&#44;
                that at that moment&#44; and through this people&#44; the religion which was
                ultimately to reform the world&#44; was to be pro&#8211; mulgated&#44; and firmly
                established. There are in truth many means at the disposal of the Lord to effect his
                will&#59; but we need no argument to vindicate his wis&#8211; dom for selecting the
                time and the instruments He <pb n="164"/> 164 THE COVENANT AT HOREB. did&#44; when
                He came to communicate his law&#44; which He decreed to be everlasting. The
                event&#44; if any vin&#8211; dication were required&#44; would amply justify the act
                of Providence of which we are speaking&#44; and the his&#8211; tory of the world for
                the last three thousand years may he boldly appealed to&#44; in order to satisfy the
                most incredulous that the descent on Sinai has not been in vain. God&#39;s thunders
                rolled on the morning of the annunciation&#44; and to this hour they reverber&#8211;
                ate in the ears of all Israel. His lightnings flashed from amidst the deepest gloom
                that rested on Horeb&#44; and at this moment they light up before our eyes the
                darkness of our earthly pilgrimage. His glory shook the wilderness of Sinai &#59;
                and even now the reflection thereof refreshes the soul of his adorers&#44; and
                guides their steps to the summit of yon immortal mountain where dwells the
                everlasting presence of God. His voice spoke then aloud to all the people &#59; and
                on this very day the sound is not hushed&#44; and every son of Jacob hears the
                undying words as they counsel him to look up to his Father in heaven&#44; and to
                follow&#44; un&#8211; daunted&#44; his guidance&#44; though it lead him through the
                valley of the shadow of death. The visible marks of the divine presence affecting
                outward nature have indeed passed away&#44; with the hour and the day when they were
                witnessed &#59; but the record of them has not been taken from us &#59; and whenever
                we sit down to study the book which has been written for our in&#8211; struction and
                our improvement&#44; we must&#44; unless we are wilfully blind to the truths it
                contains&#44; be irresist&#8211; ibly drawn to the conviction that it is the finger
                of God which has traced these characters for the salva&#8211; tion of mankind. Human
                wisdom would have con&#8211; <pb n="165"/> THE COVENANT AT HOREB. 165 nected human
                glory with the laws we possess&#59; but no trace of this kind is discoverable in our
                law. Every line is instinct with universal applicability&#59; no man is placed above
                the level of his countrymen&#44; all are alike in their accountability to the Lord
                &#59; and whether it be the high&#8211;priest at the altar&#44; the general at the
                head of the army&#44; the chief magistrate in his seat of justice&#44; the labourer
                in the field&#44; or the beggar in the street&#44; all are alike declared to be
                sojourners and strangers with the chief Authority of the land&#44; and this
                Authority is no other than the Lord God&#44; the Creator of all. Now this levelling
                of stations is not to abase the high&#44; not to detract from the just merit of any
                one citizen in our state&#59; but to raise the poor upon the great platform of
                humanity&#44; to teach the ex&#8211; alted that their glory is a gift from on
                High&#44; and to impress upon the humble that they too have been formed in the image
                of God&#44; so that the first may not be lifted up above their brethren&#44; and
                that the latter may not sink into that abject state of dependence on human aid&#44;
                which renders them but too much the slaves obedient to the will of the powerful&#44;
                and de&#8211; stroys in them that aspiration for holy things&#44; which ought to
                distinguish all those who have a share in immortality&#44; and have been taught by
                the wisdom of God whose image they bear. Let us now recur to our text&#58; &#34;And
                Moses took the blood and sprinkled it upon the people&#44; and said&#44; Behold&#33;
                it is the biood of the covenant which the Lord hath made with you concerning all
                these things. The things spoken of are the duties of religion which the book of the
                covenant contains. When notified that the Lord would come and speak with them&#44;
                to an&#8211; <pb n="166"/> 166 THE COVENANT AT HOREB. nounce to them his will&#44;
                all the Israelites unanimously answered&#58; &#34;All that the Lord hath spoken&#44;
                we will do and obey.&#34; The whole nation avowed obedience to the same code of laws
                and ordinances&#44; as all had been alike subject to the same slavery and been
                re&#8211; deemed thence by the self&#8211;same outstretched Arm of divine
                omnipotence. Now&#44; in the days of Abraham&#44; when he was ninety and nine years
                old&#44; the Lord ap&#8211; peared unto him&#44; and said &#58; &#34; I am the God
                Shadday&#44; walk before me&#44; and be thou perfect.&#34; It was then that the
                Almighty made with him a covenant&#44; because be had been obedient in all things
                and through many sore and severe trials of faith&#59; and because that the Lord knew
                that he would faithfully enjoin on his household that they should &#34; observe the
                ways of the Lord&#44; to do righteousness and justice.&#34; The cove&#8211; nant on
                the part of the Majesty of heaven was that He would be the Protector of Abraham and
                of his descendants after him&#44; to be their God unto the latest generation of man.
                On the part of Abraham and his descendants an act of faith was demanded&#44; by
                which they were to prove whether they would walk in the way of the Lord or not. They
                were ordered to seal their flesh with the bodily and outward sign of cir&#8211;
                cumcision&#44; which should be the symbol of inward purification of the soul&#44;
                and the sanctification of the spirit to the service of God. From all male
                descend&#8211; ants of Abraham&#44; to their latest generations&#44; the blood of
                the covenant was to be shed&#44; that from their birth they might be marked as the
                purchased servants of the Most High God. &#8212; Abraham was thus consecrated
                through the blood of the covenant&#44; marked to all fu&#8211; turity as the
                favourite of Heaven &#59; and during the so&#8211; <pb n="167"/> THE COVENANT AT
                HOREB. 167 jpurn of his descendants in the land of their servitude the observance of
                the same law kept alive in their minds that they were children of a mighty
                promise&#44; given to their forefathers by the Creator himself. And when the great
                prophet was sent to them with the message that the Lord had thought of them&#44;
                be&#8211; cause of the promise made to Abraham&#44; Isaac&#44; and Jacob&#44; the
                people believed&#44; and obeyed the Voice that summoned them unto freedom. Nothing
                but the power of God could have preserved them amidst all the hardships they had to
                undergo&#58; this they felt&#59; and they were therefore ready to follow his
                guidance into the desert on their journey to the land of prom&#8211; ise&#44; and to
                obey his will during their future journey&#8211; ings as a nation in the field of
                history&#44; to their latest posterity. We were&#44; indeed&#44; ransomed from the
                sla&#8211; very of ungodliness&#44; not less than from the servitude of the body to
                cruel oppressors&#44; and we were ap&#8211; pointed to be the standard&#8211;bearers
                of the Lord&#39;s cove&#8211; nant&#44; a sign and a beacon to the nations of the
                earth. &#8212; But with the enlargement of the belief and duties of the revelation
                to Abraham&#44; an addition to the cove&#8211; nant was necessary&#59; a new
                impression was to be made&#44; which should be superadded to the ancient faith
                al&#8211; ready inherent in our natures &#59; a farther responsibility was to be
                imposed on Israel&#44; the accountability under a code of separation from the
                families of the earth&#44; by other special ordinances beside the covenant of
                circumcision anciently revealed to Abraham. Moses was therefore ordered to summon
                the people to the foot of Sinai&#44; and prepare them for the glorious com&#8211;
                ing of the divine Presence&#44; which was to announce to them those laws which they
                were to obey. But not <pb n="168"/> 168 THE COVENANT AT IIOREB. an unwilling yoke
                did the Lord wish to impose upon Israel&#59; they were at liberty to reject&#39; the
                trust if so they had felt inclined. Yet where was any room for doubt&#44; for
                hesitation&#44; at the moment when all the wonders were yet. fresh in the memory of
                the lately ransomed people &#63; They indeed felt that the Lord is the God&#44; and
                they were anxious to be yet more indis&#8211; solubly united to his love than they
                had been through the promise made to Abraham. Again an external symbol was called
                into service&#44; to represent outwardly the spirit that dwelt unseen within. The
                prophet erected an altar&#44; and set up twelve monuments after the number of the
                tribes of Israel&#44; to represent that the whole people were by the legislation of
                Sinai to become practically connected&#44; and be built up as the sanctuary for the
                glory of God. In this all Israelites were to be united&#59; no one should be able to
                discon&#8211; nect himself from the union which was the work of the Lord&#44; and
                all should labour to do their utmost to promote the welfare and the permanence of
                the work so gloriously established. The altar having been built&#44; the delegates
                of the people were sent to offer up na&#8211; tional offerings in the name of the
                whole community&#59; and whilst the fire consumed the sacrifices which had been
                consecrated in the name of the Most High&#44; the prophet took the book in which the
                statutes of the Lord had been written&#44; and read it aloud to the as&#8211;
                sembly. Again they assented&#44; they for a second time took upon themselves the vow
                of obedience and fidel&#8211; ity&#44; acknowledging thus the Lord as their Supreme
                Legislator and civil Head. To confirm this event&#44; therefore&#44; in their
                memories&#44; Moses took the portion of the blood of the sacrifices which he had set
                aside&#44; <pb n="169"/> THE COVENANT AT HOREB. 169 and sprinkled it on the people.
                At their individual birth they had been marked servants of God&#44; by the blood of
                circumcision &#59; and now&#44; at the new birth of their nation in the divine
                truth&#44; they were again marked by the blood of the sacrifices&#44; and they came
                thus under the covenant of obedience&#44; consecrated&#44; as was the altar of burnt
                offering under the ministra&#8211; tion of the priests of the Most High&#44; to the
                service of the Creator&#44; to be to Him a kingdom of priests and a holy nation&#44;
                separated from all the world by the ac&#8211; knowledgment of the blessed unity&#44;
                and the observ&#8211; ance of the precepts which had been announced to them from the
                midst of the tire. And the Lord of all then also covenanted on his part&#44; that
                lie would ever protect the sons of Abraham who had twice accepted Him for their
                God&#44; and would forever let his name be sanctified through them&#44; though they
                might at times go astray on the paths of sin&#44; and draw down upon themselves the
                punishment due to the infraction of the law and the forsaking of the covenant.
                Whilst we were true to the law and the testimony&#44; blessings and peace were
                vouchsafed to us as national gifts from the Creator&#44; besides the tranquillity of
                soul which is the portion of each individual servant of the Lord. But when we
                rebelled&#44; and went after the idols and abominations of the gentiles&#44; the
                covenant called aloud for vengeanee&#44; and testified against us before the
                impartial juscice of our eternal King. The pro&#8211; tection which obedience had
                received was withdrawn for iniquity&#44; and the peace was converted into
                warfare&#44; and the blessing into curses. That what a world could not overthrow
                fell before the outraged covenant&#44; and the people that under the rule of
                holiness would have VOL. V. 15 <pb n="170"/> 170 THE COVENANT AT HOREB. been a light
                to the gentiles&#44; was scattered into every clime&#44; and became a byword and a
                hissing to the sons of man. It was thus decreed that&#44; with the in&#8211; crease
                of light which our reason received by the be&#8211; stowal of the law&#44; there
                should be required of us an in&#8211; crease of righteousness and a constant
                watching over our inclinations that they might not lead us into sin. Where&#44;
                then&#44; is Israel&#39;s safety&#63; is it in joining the gentiles in their
                worship&#63; is it in looseness of con&#8211; duct&#63; in neglect of the law&#63;
                in forsaking the cove&#8211; nant&#63; no&#33; in all these acts there is death unto
                Israel&#44; there is tribulation&#44; there is woe&#33; JSTo &#33; we have received
                the statutes of righteousness&#44; and in them we must walk. We have been blessed
                with rules of purity&#58; let us then purify ourselves&#44; and avoid every thing
                which could destroy in us the divine image which we bear. The law has been
                con&#8211; fided to our keeping &#58; let us then watch over it with jealous
                care&#44; and teach its precepts to our brothers&#44; that they may love the
                heavenly legacy and walk in its light. And&#44; lastly&#44; the covenant of
                righteousness in which we have entered by the calling of Abraham and the assemblage
                of our fathers at the foot of Sinai &#8212; let us preserve it inviolate&#44;
                sacred&#44; undefilecl&#44; let it be a sign between us and the Lord&#44; inasmuch
                as He is the Chief of our race&#44; the Guardian&#44; the Saviour of Israel&#44;
                through whose righteousness alone all sons of Jacob can be justified. When then the
                enemies of our peace endeavour to lead us away from the standard under which we have
                triumphed in so many trials&#44; during so many ages &#58; let us tell them that we
                may not forsake our God whilst He does not forsake us. What has preserved <pb

                defended Israel from annihilation&#44; when the world rose up to destroy and to slay
                &#63; what is not the providence of the Lord&#63; did He not assist us in every
                trial which would have consumed us&#44; had not a preternatural assistance been
                granted to us in the hour of our need&#63; And still we are invited to forsake bur
                God&#33; we are to turn traitors to the covenant which was instituted by Him&#44;
                who is wise&#44; good&#44; and holy &#33; With the law of God&#44; which is our
                life&#44; we are at times exposed to sin and its concomitant retribution&#58; how
                much more would we be liable to every evil&#44; were we ever to become traitors to
                our own peace&#44; and seek the fellowship of the gentiles. &#8212; No&#44;
                brethren&#44; this must not&#44; can never be. We may be inclined to swerve from the
                line of duty&#59; but providential warning&#44; even if it be the avenging
                sword&#44; will recall us to our duty&#59; for the covenant can never perish. The
                blood thereof is upon us and our descendants&#44; just as it w x as upon our
                fathers&#59; it can never be washed off&#44; not even by apostacy from the Church of
                God&#59; it will grace us even in the midst of iniquity &#59; and when the time of
                redemption shall have come&#44; it will reassert its tri&#8211; umph over all our
                brethren&#44; and establish immovably the kingdom of the Lord in the midst of us.
                Yes&#44; because of the covenant&#44; the redeemer will be sent &#59; because of the
                promise of the Lord&#44; the captives will be taken from amidst of the gentiles
                &#59; and because of the truth of God&#44; the prophetic words will be ful&#8211;

                BLESSINGS OF RELIGION.* O Lord our God&#44; how excellent is thy majesty in all the
                earth &#33; In the heavens above every thing pro&#8211; claims thy glory&#44; the
                holiness of thy name resounds from sphere to sphere&#59; and the creatures of this

                praise&#44; a simultaneous offering of hum&#8211; ble adoration to thy memorial
                which is blessed for ever. Among the infinity of these servants we too have come to
                praise and to adore&#44; oppressed by a feel&#8211; ing of our nothingness&#44; of

                bend thy ear to the words of their sup&#8211; plication. O hear us then&#44; our
                Father&#33; hearken unto our prayers&#44; which stream from overflowing hearts&#44;
                that spring from the spirit&#39;s depths&#44; a spontaneous offering unto thy
                mercy&#44; all that the creature can render unto its Maker&#33; Be present in the
                midst of us upon all occasions when we are assembled in thy 7 name&#44; and let all
                our endeavours in the pursuit of righteousness redound to the spread of thy kingdom
                and the permanent welfare of all thy children. Yea&#44; let thy spirit be in the
                assemblies of the house of Is&#8211; rael&#44; whom Thou hast called unto thy
                service&#59; cause them to be cpiick in the knowledge of the things Thou hast
                ordained&#44; and let them be instructed from the abundance of that light and that
                best of wisdom&#44; which ever issue from the inexhaustible fountain of thy precious
                law. But&#44; everlasting God&#33; we know the infirmities of our nature&#44; the
                proneness of each of us to rise in his own estimation above his
                fellow&#8211;mortals&#59; to deem himself exempt from acts of obedience which bind
                the humble in the bonds of faith and duty&#59; where&#8211; fore many go astray
                after sin and transgression&#44; and reap unto themselves a harvest of sorrow and
                tribula&#8211; tion. &#8212; And though we see the young cut down in the pride of
                youth&#59; the man of wisdom stricken in the day of his mightiest achievement&#59;
                the ruler among his people seized by the hand of death in the moment of his triumph
                &#58; we but too often forget our own mor&#8211; tality&#44; weening that the storm
                which overwhelms others will pass by us without injuring the fabric of our
                prosperity. O&#44; do Thou therefore cause that the workings of thy power may reach
                our obdurate hearts&#44; 15* <pb n="174"/> 174 THE BLESSINGS OF RELIGION. that the
                lesson which thy justice teaches unto man&#8211; kind may not fail of its beneficent
                effects upon all and each of us. Cause us to see thy finger in every act which thy
                mysterious providence works out so abundantly before our eyes&#59; let us feel that
                it is thy hand which builds up&#44; that it is thy hand which pulls down &#59; that
                in thy blessing only we live&#44; and in thy cursing we must die. So that whatever
                may be sent unto us&#44; be it good&#44; be it evil&#44; we may be taught to turn
                ourselves unto Thee&#44; to ask thy countenance&#44; to acknowledge thy power&#44;
                to humble our pride&#44; to grow in humility&#44; to become truly wise in
                meekness&#44; strong in filial reliance upon thy aid which accompanies in every
                stage of their being those who place their trust in Thee. And since without the
                knowledge which thy re&#8211; ligion imparts to us we would go astray like the sheep
                that are scattered on the mountains without a shep&#8211; herd &#58; we pray Thee to
                make our minds intelligent to understand whatever Thou hast written for our
                instruction&#44; and enable us to teach to others the truth which we have
                obtained&#44; and to enkindle in their souls the faith that burns within ourselves.
                Let us farther beseech Thee&#44; to cause the instruction&#44; which these young
                Israelites have received&#44; to become fruit&#8211; ful unto salvation&#44; that it
                may enable them to guard against the snares of life&#44; and to bid defiance to all
                temptation which at any time may threaten to with&#8211; draw them from thy
                service&#44; for which thy provi&#8211; dence has chosen them&#44; inasmuch as they
                are the de&#8211; scendants of thy children with whom Thou inadest a covenant to be
                unto them a God and to their seed after them. Let not thy religion be ever forgotten

                testimony against them and ns&#44; if they ever swerve from the line of duty which
                Thou hast decreed for the children of Jacob. So that they may arise in later days
                witnesses of thy glory and of thy being&#44; to continue for other genera&#8211;
                tions&#44; to the end of time&#44; the knowledge of the truth which has come from
                Thee among the children of man &#59; in order that thy name&#44; O our Father &#33;
                may be glorified on earth as it is glorified in the midst of the assemblies of
                angels&#44; who proclaim thy power&#44; saying&#58; &#34;Holy&#44; holy&#44;
                holy&#44; is the Lord of hosts&#44; the whole earth is full of his glory.&#34;
                &#8212; O do this&#44; not for our sakes&#44; but for the sake of thy holy Name&#44;
                which is profaned among nations&#44; and which Thou hast said shall be glorified and
                known to all mankind at the proclaiming of thy salvation in the days of the son of
                David&#44; whom Thou wilt send to redeem from a twofold bondage those who return
                from transgression in Jacob&#44; and look forward to the time when Thou wilt reign
                alone in Zion&#44; the King of all flesh&#44; the adored Lord of all sons of men.
                0&#44; may this be speedily fulfilled &#8212; Amen. Amen &#33; Brethren &#33; In the
                book of Proverbs&#44; which contains&#44; so to say&#44; the experience of divine
                wisdom in the events of human life&#44; occurs the following near the close of the
                last chapter &#58; &#34; Favour is deceitful&#44; and beauty is vain &#59; the woman

                THE BLESSINGS OF RELIGION. The words of the text we have cited express briefly the
                qualifications demanded to give life its charms&#44; and to decorate the responsible
                agents to whom the earth has been given with the insignia of the favour of the Most
                High. God has indeed bestowed gifts of a perishable kind&#44; which attract by their
                strikingness the outward eye&#59; but they are in truth perishing&#44; passing
                away&#44; whilst the eye still dwells upon them &#59; and while we contemplate them
                in their highest per&#8211; fection&#44; they fade and mark still more strongly than
                their entire absence could have done our mortality and nothingness. The sprightly
                maiden goes forth in the pride of grace&#44; which animation&#44; youth&#44; and
                health&#44; cast around her pliant limbs&#59; she attracts the gaze of many
                admirers&#44; and the world is to her an open book in which she reads nothing but
                joy and happiness. Yet soon the destroyer conies &#59; she falls into the snares of
                the flatterer&#44; and her peace is shipwrecked&#59; her jewels are torn from her
                brow&#44; and she is left to wither in the total neglect of former ad&#8211;
                mirers&#44; as a cast&#8211;off flower&#44; unheeded by all&#44; trampled upon and
                spurned by many. Yes&#44; mere favour and grace are deceitful&#59; they bind the
                heart for a moment&#44; and are then unnoticed if naught else enchains the
                affections &#59; they foil to fill up the void which the ab&#8211; sence of better
                attractions produces&#44; and they soon cease to adorn their thoughtless possessor.
                And beauty &#63; ah&#44; how soon does this perish. Behold her the observed of all
                observers&#44; whither she moves admiring crowds pay the homage to her personal
                at&#8211; tractions&#59; and she reigns triumphant amidst her com&#8211;
                panions&#59; the glow of health mantles on her cheek&#59; her brilliant eye flashes
                with pleasure&#44; and she believes <pb n="177"/> THE BLESSINGS OF RELIGION. 177
                life always the gay and beautiful scene which her mind sees now spread before her.
                &#8212; But &#34; beauty is vain.&#34; The hand of disease has seized upon her
                frame&#44; and her former friends fly from her presence as though she were the
                harbinger of death &#59; and soon she recovers&#59; but her former dazzling eye is
                dim &#59; her dimpled cheeks are sunken &#59; her lustrous skin is deformed with
                cicatrices of the pestilential disorder&#44; and her flowing hair no longer drops
                down upon her graceful shoulders. And is she the once admired&#44; the courted&#44;
                the envied beauty &#63; Even so &#59; the hand of disease has taken from her what
                was in itself per&#8211; ishable&#44; fading&#44; and has marked the admired one as
                a child of decay and mortality. Truly&#44; beauty is vain&#33; But there are other
                charms besides those of per&#8211; sonal grace and outward beauty&#44; which no
                change of circumstances&#44; no sickness can destroy &#59; they are the beauties of
                the soul&#44; the grace proceeding from right&#8211; eousness&#44; which are undying
                as the source from which they spring&#44; and they will bloom amidst decay&#44; and
                flourish in the corruption of death. Also when the body itself shall have passed
                away&#44; these possessions will not have been acquired in vain &#59; since they
                will produce fruits&#44; and be green and beautiful for unend&#8211; ing days. For
                when the soul departs from this world&#44; she is not accompanied by the gold&#44;
                and silver&#44; and precious stones which she possessed in this life&#44; but by the
                grace of righteous deeds which she has made her own&#59; and these will plead for
                her before the righteous tribunal of the Creator&#44; and intercede for her that the
                sins&#44; from which no mortal is free&#44; may be forgiven. The treasures of the

                death even&#44; at a time when all that has been prized so highly in life must be
                left behind&#44; either annihilated by sickness or death&#44; or to be pos&#8211;
                sessed by others who toiled not for the acquisition. Let it be understood&#44; that
                no station can exempt a child of earth from the sufferings incident to human
                nature&#59; &#34;For dust we are&#44; and to dust we must re&#8211; turn.&#34; No
                one will therefore say&#44; that righteousness will shield us from the ills which
                flesh is heir to &#59; and no honest teacher of religion will for the same reason
                hold out the pursuit of piety as a probable means to acquire ease and competency on
                earth. There may be cases&#44; and&#44; rightly viewed&#44; they are universally
                discoverable&#44; where religious conformity brings&#44; to use the words of
                Scripture&#44; &#34; length of days on the right hand&#44; and on the left wealth
                and honour&#59;&#34; for obedience to the will of God does not preclude the highest
                attain ment of worldly prosperity. But on the other hand it is not to be denied&#44;
                that such pursuits make demands upon our time which are the reverse of an indulgence
                in leisure and amusement&#59; they call for sacrifice of pleasure&#44; of
                enjoyment&#44; and agreeable sensation &#59; whilst they order us to let wealth be
                dis&#8211; regarded if it can be got only by violating the ordi&#8211; nances of the
                Bible&#44; whilst they bid us to give of our substance to the poor and to extend the
                helping hand to the needy. But a far higher object is to be attained by the exercise
                of piety&#44; an object to which beauty&#44; favour&#44; wealth&#44; ease and power
                are as dust in the balance. Yes&#44; because we are perishable&#44; we should enrich
                ourselves with that which can never die&#44; nay&#44; which&#44; in the state of
                probation wherein we all find ourselves&#44; will sweeten sorrow and teach us to

                descends to the grave&#44; but his heart has felt care and sorrow&#44; and borne
                afflictions silently and alone&#44; without a human comforter&#44; without daring to
                impart the cause of sadness which the spirit felt&#44; unseen by stranger eyes in
                its inmost recesses. If even&#44; which is hardly probable&#44; there should be no
                ills of magnitude happening in any one particular person&#39;s life &#58; there are
                nevertheless a thousand vexa&#8211; tions&#44; all minute and trifling enough&#44;
                which for all that make up a sum of tribulations which test the temper&#44; and
                demand as much forbearance as those greater evils against w T hich a proud spirit
                loves per&#8211; haps to contend with the heroic fortitude of a well&#8211;
                regulated mind. But this much is certain&#44; whether unhappy in great or in small
                things&#44; there is no hu&#8211; man being but feels daily the weight of his
                mortality&#44; by which he is hourly reminded that his abiding&#8211;place is not
                here&#44; that his happiness would not be mate&#8211; rially increased though he
                were to live a thousand years. Let us then early learn to seek the only remedy which
                has been mercifully provided&#44; especially for us Israelites&#44; in the
                possession of the religion of truth which the Bible contains. If we do not know
                already&#44; then let it be impressed upon us&#44; that in obedience alone there is
                safety from the wrath which follows in the wake of sin&#44; that in looking up to

                undertake is the sure refuge from the sorrows which everywhere surround us. Let us

                here below&#59;&#34; for our wants&#44; properly so called&#44; but very little is
                required&#59; if we have simple raiment&#44; wholesome food&#44; comfortable
                sheltei&#8211;&#44; and are not too much oppressed by the care of providing for our
                daily wants&#44; we have enough to satisfy all reasonable requirements for our
                personal gratification &#59; if we have something over&#44; which we can employ in
                doing good to those w T ho are not so well endowed as we are&#44; we have already
                more than our proper share of worldly things &#59; and at length if our substance be
                so vastly extended that we can nei&#8211; ther use it ourselves nor feel inclined to
                bestow it on others &#58; our happiness will not be materially aug&#8211;
                mented&#44; except what the mere pleasure of possession may afford&#44; in having so
                much which we cannot use whilst we have it&#44; and which will grieve us sorely when
                by some mishap it is taken from us again. &#8212; We should know that whatever our
                wisdom or industry may be&#44; it is a gracious Providence that blesses our
                undertaking&#59; and that&#44; when losses fall to our lot&#44; there is no
                injustice done to our merits by the Be&#8211; stower of all gifts&#44; who&#44; when
                He deems it best&#44; can resume what may be in his omniscience of no ulterior
                advantage to us. If any blessing should puff up our heart with pride&#44; and make
                us look upon ourselves as better than other men&#44; whom we excel&#44; as we
                fancy&#44; through our own exertions&#44; in wealth&#44; wisdom&#44; or power &#59;
                if by this means we are beginning to vaunt of our success as though there were no

                be taught that we are nothing more in the scale of be&#8211; ings than persons who
                are not by their own inherent power&#44; but by the favour of Him who measures all
                our steps&#44; a little more endowed with things which administer to our pleasures
                than others who bear like ourselves the stamp of humanity.&#8212; On the other hand
                let those who are humble&#44; not be deceived by the apparent prosperity of the
                wealthy and the powerful&#44; nor let them envy the renown of the w T ise&#44; and
                the admiration which is rendered to personal beauty &#59; the contented mind can

                ceived blessings may be&#44; has an equal burden of some other sorrow which pursues
                him from his birth to the grave. But all this proves how necessary it is for all men
                to have a prop which is to support them not alone in times of trial&#44; but in
                every stage of existence &#59; for even in the moments of the highest enjoyment the
                soul of man most deeply feels that it inhabits a mortal tene&#8211; ment&#44; which

                the moment that the child begins to distinguish be&#8211; tween what pleases and
                displeases him. Let the first reasoning be about duties and obedience&#44; in order

                Beneficence&#44; capable of a progressive improvement&#44; destined for happiness in
                a purer state of existence. Make him sensible that there is a watchful Providence
                who is attentive to all our deeds&#44; and that every human being is to be judged by
                his own acts&#44; be they good or evil&#44; as &#34; for all these God will bring us
                to judgment.&#34; Let there be no interruption to this teaching&#59; and when the
                foundation has been laid&#44; proceed to unfold to him the whole system of duties
                which the Scriptures contain&#44; and make it your pleasure to show by your own
                virtuous example&#44; that you are sincere in your instruction&#44; and then you can
                reasonably demand of him a compliance with the things you have impressed upon his
                mind. Let him&#44; moreover&#44; watch nature as he grows in intellect and
                knowledge&#44; let him feel how omnipotent He must be who stretched out the

                worlds&#44; each of which is many and many times larger than the earth which we
                inhabit. Tell him&#44; with the enthusiasm which the theme ought to call forth&#44;

                him in your own person upon all occasions&#44; that you also feel the full weight of
                this obligation&#44; by being humble in prosperity and submissive in sorrow&#59; by

                willing to recognize the same in all other men. Hold up to Him the example of the
                virtuous&#44; the constant&#44; the devoted&#44; of whom history speaks&#44; or who
                may be found among your own acquaintance&#59; excite in him a desire for emulating
                the bright deeds which shed a lustre on human nature&#44; by pointing out their
                accordance with the will of God in whose service and name they were displayed. Bring
                him to the house of God&#59; teach him to love the courts of the Lord&#44; and to

                and to bid the soul to rise from earth to heaven. If you have done all this to your

                admitted&#44; but the heart remains unmoved&#44; and the heedlessness is continued
                as before&#44; and sin is per&#8211; versely pursued&#44; as though it were the road

                to a moralist&#44; sins publicly committed are not private affairs &#59; they are
                poisonous exhalations which&#44; spreading from the spot where they struck their

                attention to the imminent danger&#44; if he should see the number of the anxious
                inquirers after salvation increase &#58; let him not glorify himself at the result
                of his labours&#44; as human pride is even in this holy work only too apt to

                Lord of his life&#44; who thought tit to prosper his exertions in the cause of
                righteousness. Let me therefore admonish you&#44; beloved brethren&#33; though you
                may perhaps with justice be able to turn the admonition back on myself&#44; unworthy

                salvation through obedience&#44; &#8212; and the road of death through sin&#44;
                condemnation through refusal to obey. Each of us is placed&#44; every moment he

                side presents to us labour&#44; seeking&#44; care&#44; but the end is life and

                end is death and misery. The pains&#44; the trials&#44; the solicitude on the one
                side are terminated after a brief space&#44; and we awake in an undying glorious
                eternity&#59; the ease&#44; the pleasures&#44; the gayeties of the other are also
                soon ended&#44; and we pass away and awaken to misery&#44; to shame&#44; to torment.
                These are not idle words of a heated fancy&#44; to frighten the timid and unlearned
                &#58; they are the ideas which are consonant both to reason and Scripture&#59; they
                are the words of alarm which each man should address to his own soul&#44; whenever
                temp&#8211; tation threatens to allure him unto the way of sin. Let each then
                reflect that ages of remorse can be pur&#8211; chased by the sinful enjoyment of an
                hour &#58; so also can a happy eternity be bought by an hour&#39;s triumph over sin
                &#59; as our wise men teach &#34;Some one buys his futurity in one hour.&#34;
                &#34;Were it indeed that we had no means of resisting the evil&#44; that we were
                irresistibly dragged along by one uni&#8211; form course of dire necessity&#44; no
                such responsibility could with any justice be imposed on us. But there is no fate

                ten&#44;&#34; to remember that we are dust&#44; accountable to Him for the

                to withdraw us unto the road of sin&#44; which has nothing&#44; neither reason nor

                ETERNITY. 203 weigh nothing&#44; if viewed by the light of reason upon the basis of
                revelation. Look at our origin. &#34;When Egypt was a mighty nation&#44; Jacob came
                to that land with seventy persons. There we increased speedily into a numerous
                people&#44; and the land was full of us. Anon the king of that land laid a heavy
                yoke on us&#44; and we were held in a hopeless bondage for many years. It was then
                that the glory of the Lord made itself manifest &#59; our chains were broken&#44;
                and we went forth rejoicing and redeemed&#44; trusting in and upheld by the power of
                our Father. We are thus emphati&#8211; cally the ransomed of the Lord&#44; his
                servants whom He brought forth from thraldom&#44; and as such we ought of right to
                be devoted to his service&#44; willing to follow his guidance&#44; whithersoever He
                may lead us. AVe are not able to penetrate his wisdom&#44; to discover how the acts
                of each of us may ultimately bring about the great change for which all good men
                look&#44; &#8212; one people and one God over all the earth &#59; but this much
                every child can see&#44; that the Lord must have some great purpose to accomplish
                for which He has preserved our nation for so many centuries. We ought therefore to
                rejoice that we have obtained the means to be pleasing unto Him by our conduct&#44;
                that He vouchsafed to teach us what it is He wishes us to do&#59; and as Israelites
                we should hasten to sacrifice every thing upon the altar of our faith&#44; &#8212;
                wealth&#44; distinction&#44; pleasure&#44; even life itself&#44; to prove that we

                vation which the Lord wrought for us when He re&#8211; leased us from bondage. It is
                for this reason that the law often reminds us of our former abject state&#44; and

                &#33; to be redeemed from the bondage of cruel men to be made servants of the Most
                Merciful &#33; to become from those abjectly de&#8211; graded the light of the
                world. Let us therefore value this glorious redemption&#59; let us be Israelites as

                it&#44; and thy glory is above the heavens&#44; and every thing proclaims thy might.
                Where is the house that can contain Thee &#63; where the temple&#44; fit
                habita&#8211; tion for thy greatness &#63; But man cannot grasp the vastness of thy
                being&#44; and he resorts to the walls which enshrine the records of thy will&#44;
                to pour forth within them the feelings which overpower him&#44; to ask of Thee the
                aid which his weakness teaches him to expect only at thy Almighty hands. And Thou
                hast taught us that this service is pleasing to Thee&#44; that contrition of heart
                is an agreeable savour&#44; which will turn away wrath and annul the evil decree
                which sin draws down upon her votaries&#44; by the immutable connexion which binds
                retribution to the chariot of evil. Wilt Thou now hear us&#44; Father of all&#63;
                wilt Thou now listen&#44; Lord of the universe &#63; Yea&#44; do Thou hear us in thy
                high abode&#44; where there is the infinity of light&#44; and listen to the prayers
                which ascend without ceasing from those who know their own sinfulness&#44; and
                acknowledge Thee as the Par&#8211; doner of sin&#44; as the merciful One who
                delights in righteousness. O do this for thy own sake&#44; in order that our
                assembling to pray and to hear instruction may redound to our purification&#44; that
                our hearts may be filled with reverence for thy holiness&#44; to fear Thee&#44; vol.
                v. 18 <pb n="206"/> 206 REVERENCE FOR THE SANCTUARY&#44; to adore Thee all the days
                which Thou hast assigned to us on earth&#44; to testify&#44; unto those who know
                Thee not&#44; of thy power and goodness&#44; to draw many unto thy footstool as
                willing servants in thy house for ever&#8211; more. Amen. Brethren &#33; As one of
                the precepts of the divine law we read in Leviticus xix. 30 &#58; &#34;Ye shall keep
                my Sabbaths&#44; and reverence my sanctuary&#58; I am the Lord.&#34; &#34;We will
                not discuss to&#8211;day the first portion of our text&#44; having had frequent
                occasions before this to speak of its immense importance to a consistent religious
                life&#59; but the second part is one upon which our atten&#8211; tion has not
                hitherto been extensively bestowed. Let us therefore examine it in its proper
                bearing&#44; and elucidate its applicability to ourselves. &#34;And ye shall
                reverence my sanctuary &#58; I am the Lord.&#34; By sanctuary is evidently
                understood the place or places set apart emphatically for the service and adoration
                of the Most High&#44; and such places as these we are commanded to reverence&#59;
                because He&#44; to whose honour they are appropriated&#44; is the Everlasting One
                our God. The great central temple&#44; whither all Israel flocked three times every
                year to appear in the pres&#8211; ence of the Lord&#44; and to which doubtless the
                first and highest reverence was due&#44; is no longer in the midst of us&#59; we are
                therefore now precluded from singling <pb n="207"/> REVERENCE FOR THE SANCTUARY. 207
                out any one &#8211;particular spot which could claim an especial sanctity&#59; but
                the Lord has permitted us to invoke Him in many places&#44; in every town almost of
                our dispersion&#44; and we have accordingly to take heed that we pay due
                deference&#44; according to the altered circumstances of the times&#44; to the
                various sanctuaries which we have been allowed to establish as houses of prayer unto
                the children of Israel. When the temple yet stood erect on Mount Moriah&#44; where
                it towered in beauty&#44; like the waves of the sea gilded by the setting sun&#44;
                above the houses of the city of our desires&#44; there was a spot which was fenced
                round by many particular ordinances of sacrifices and purifications&#44; which
                denoted it as the especial sanc&#8211; tuary&#44; which to enter in profanity or
                against the in&#8211; stitutions of the law was a sin worthy of the severest
                visitation of Heaven&#44; as we read of Korah in the wil&#8211; derness&#44; and of
                King Hzziah at Jerusalem. But even in those days there were no doubt minor
                sanctuaries&#44; whither the people resorted continually to inquire what God had
                instituted concerning them&#44; and to offer there the prayers of their heart to the
                Living All&#8211;seeing One&#59; and so Moses taught in the name of his Sender&#58;
                &#34;In every place&#44; where I will let my name be mentioned&#44; I will come unto
                thee and bless thee&#59;&#34; understand&#44; not one particular spot only should
                merit the heavenly blessing&#44; but every other one also&#44; where Israel would be
                at any time permitted to invoke the Name which angels mention in fear and
                terror&#44; should be especially blessed with the holy Presence&#44; were the number
                infinite&#44; and the site the whole earth. &#34; In every place where I will let my
                name be men&#8211; tioned&#44; I will come unto thee and bless thee&#59;&#34; as <pb

                Gocl&#44; so universally is his blessing promised here&#44; in Palestine&#44; in
                Asia&#44; in Europe&#44; in Africa&#44; in America&#44; yea in every place wherever
                men are gathered in the name of the Lord&#44; there will his spirit come&#44; listen
                to prayer&#44; judge the petitioners according to their deeds&#44; and grant and do
                the desires of the devout heart&#44; if the petition redounds to the good of him who
                asks the grace and of the world at large. But how shall we reverence the sanctuary
                &#63; shall we pay respect to the outward walls or inward decor&#8211; ations&#63;
                shall we entertain any particular feelings of awe for the building which happens to
                bear the name of synagogue or house of assembly&#63; &#8212; In a measure all this
                should be done&#59; the walls&#44; the decorations&#44; the entire structure have
                been set apart for a sacred pur&#8211; pose&#44; and they therefore merit that we
                make no pro&#8211; fane use of them. Let us reflect that&#44; though the majesty of
                Heaven cannot be comprised and con&#8211; tained within any limits which we can
                imagine&#44; since even the universe&#44; whatever the conception of the mind can
                reach&#44; and more than thoughts and words can express&#44; cannot confine his
                being within the vastest extents&#44; it was nevertheless always his pleas&#8211;
                ure to honour certain spots on earth by the perform&#8211; ance of remarkable deeds
                and prodigies&#44; and to select them in this manner as points whence the good was
                to issue to the children of the dust who might resort thither to claim his
                protection. &#34;Whenever we build&#44; or rather&#44; to speak more in accordance
                with the humility which is so becoming to mortals&#44; whenever we are permitted to
                build a house of prayer&#44; we must assume that we have been favoured by the
                invisible <pb n="209"/> REVERENCE FOR THE SANCTUARY. 209 instructor whom God has
                placed by our side to select precisely that spot&#44; which for the time being has
                merited and thus received the distinction of becom&#8211; ing a place for the
                dissemination of the truth which dwells in the law of God. If&#44; then&#44; we
                behold such an edifice&#44; we should feel at once that it is different from the
                ordinary resorts of man&#44; erected merely for dwellings&#44; for marts of
                business&#44; or for pleasure&#59; be&#8211; cause it is the place especially
                devoted and marked out as the pivot on which turns the happiness and peace of
                many&#44; and as such more to be honoured by outward respect than the places not so
                highly fa&#8211; voured. When we enter therefore the precincts thus hallowed&#44; we
                should feel that we have left the out&#8211; ward world with its cares and
                distractions where they properly belong&#44; and we should revert to that great
                consolatory idea&#44; that now we are in a precinct where dwells the glory&#44; the
                emanation&#44; if we use so profane a term&#44; of the being of the invisible
                Divinity&#44; who is pleased to come hither to dwell among us. Only think&#33; the
                Unending One&#44; who is the Creator of all things&#44; the Lord of all beings&#44;
                has chosen this and many other places on the surface of this vast earth&#44; which
                is at last only a minute part of his immense creation&#44; to come in the midst of
                us mortals&#44; to in&#8211; struct and to bless us &#33; and we are privileged to
                resort hither&#44; to stand in this august presence&#44; to speak to Him as though
                we spoke to a father&#44; to entreat Him as a child entreats a parent&#44; to lay
                open to Him the secrets of our heart&#44; to pour out into his bosom&#44; again to
                use a human word&#44; our sorrows&#44; our wants&#58; and He has promised to be
                here&#44; because here we have been permitted to mention his name&#44; to bless and
                to 18* <pb n="210"/> 210 REVERENCE FOR THE SANCTUARY. hear us. And should we not
                feel that in the house of prayer there is a peculiar sanctity&#63; that the walls
                are holy walls &#63; that the building is more to he prized than our dwellings or
                our workshops&#63; Assuredly&#59; there&#44; where God is more immediately
                present&#44; and this we know because He has taught us so in his word&#44; man ought
                to be more humbled than usually&#44; and feel respect for the floor on which he
                treads in coming to appear before his Maker&#44; whether this be for prayer or for
                other purposes connected with the spread of religion&#44; and for such only should
                the house of God ever be resorted to&#59; since to do otherwise would&#44; as reason
                teaches already&#44; be in direct contra&#8211; vention to the precept&#44; &#34;
                And ye shall reverence my sanctuary.&#34; Yet not the mere outward respect for the
                outward structure is hereby enjoined &#58; the precept goes farther&#44; and will
                exhibit to us the spirit of decorum which should prevail during our assembling to
                pray&#44; or while listening to instruction in divine things in the houses erected
                or devoted to the service of the Lord. &#8212; What is prayer&#63; One of our wise
                men has well defined it as &#34; self&#8211;examination&#44;
                self&#8211;judging.&#34; &#34;We come to speak to our Father in the words of
                entreaty. But how&#63; Are we to come presumptuously&#44; boldly&#44; without
                preparation&#44; without thought&#63; are we to ask what we do not need &#63; are we
                to pray for what we do not deserve&#63; Whenever man therefore comes to pray&#44;
                especially if it be in a case of need&#44; for some&#8211; thing which his own
                situation calls for&#44; and which is not specified in the forms of prayer which we
                have received from our fathers&#58; he ought to look within himself before he conies
                hither&#59; for he appears here <pb n="211"/> REVERENCE FOR THE SANCTUARY. 211 in

                carefully investigate whether he is free from the presumption which de&#8211; mands
                the favour sought for as a right&#44; from that arrogance which claims the good or
                the aid he needs as more due to him than to any other mortal. How vain would he such
                prayer &#33; we are in God&#39;s house&#44; in his own precinct&#59; and knows He
                not our frame&#63; our imperfections &#63; our sins &#63; and can we say we
                de&#8211; serve his favour &#63; Are not all his gifts unmerited by us&#63; who can
                say that he is free from guilt&#63; that iniquity stains not the whiteness of the
                garments of innocence with which his soul was clothed at her entrance into the
                world&#63; &#8212; But let us reverence the sanctuary&#44; let it influence us with
                the ideas of humil&#8211; ity&#44; let us be grateful that we have been permitted to
                pray here&#44; that we have the grace given us to abide in the tabernacle of the
                Lord&#44; to inquire in his palace&#44; that our heart may be improved&#44; and our
                soul tilled with the tire of a holy enthusiasm&#44; which is to en&#8211; kindle in
                it a desire for better things&#44; a fondness for that virtue which can find its
                root only in the divine law as revealed to us from Sinai&#44; and which raises man
                from the dust of the earth to the glory of an immortal life. Plow then should we
                behave in the house of God &#8212; where we ought to be&#44; only if our desire is
                to exam&#8211; ine ourselves and to offer a sincere devotion as the proper sacrifice
                unto our Father&#63; are we to come late after the service has commenced&#63; are we
                to enter with a presumptuous look&#44; with a confident air&#44; as though it were a

                converse with our neighbours&#44; or to laugh at whatever of singularity strikes our
                view &#63; are we allowed to jump up and quit the place of Worship as often as we
                feel inclined &#63; to leave it before the occa&#8211; sion of the assembly is
                over&#63; are we to come hither without our prayer&#8211;books&#44; unprepared to
                pray&#44; and careless about what is done here&#63; are we permitted&#44; again&#44;
                to exhibit ourselves in attitudes unbecoming the sacred precincts &#63; to shout out
                our responses&#44; without respect to decency or the regulations of the form of
                worship &#63;&#8212; Not this ought to characterize our conduct during our
                assembling for divine service. &#8212; But persons unacquainted with the sacredness
                which our religion attaches to our religious meeting&#44; enter&#8211; ing our
                places of worship&#44; would imagine that we thought but little of the consideration
                &#34; before whom we stand&#44;&#34; or that our faith did not make it incum&#8211;
                bent on us to preserve the marks of outward pro&#8211; priety in our Synagogues. I
                regret to say it&#44; but it is necessary that I should speak out&#44; boldly
                without fear or favour&#59; we display but little of that decorum which other
                religious denominations love so much to exhibit in their churches. Gentiles are
                punctual to the hour of their assembling &#59; but we drop in at all parts of the
                service&#44; from the commencement to the ending thereof. Gentiles enter their
                churches with a demure look&#44; as though&#44; overcome by the sacred&#8211; ness
                of the place&#58; many of us&#44; on the contrary&#44; walk in boldly&#44;
                noisefully&#44; even if the service has com&#8211; menced&#44; and they disturb the
                congregation by iheir riotous demeanour. Gentiles sit in respectful silence during
                the entire meeting&#59; but many of us seem to congregate merely to converse and
                laugh with their <pb n="213"/> REVERENCE FOR THE SANCTUARY. 213 friends. &#8212;
                Gentiles would not leave their churches with&#8211; out the most urgent necessity
                during worship&#59; but how universally is it witnessed among us that there is a
                constant running in and out during almost every portion of the service. I will not
                now recapitulate all the unseemly conduct which is justly chargeable to us&#59; but
                leave it to yourselves&#44; brethren&#44; to fill up the melancholy catalogue. But I
                ask you&#44; cannot something be done to check the crying evil &#63; &#8212; You
                will perhaps say&#44; that the gentiles have more incen&#8211; tives to go to church
                than Jews have&#59; and that is the reason why their meeting&#8211;places are tilled
                to over flowing&#44; while our blessed synagogues are compara&#8211; tively empty.
                That&#44; lor instance&#44; they have a loud&#8211; mouthed bell which summons them
                at the appointed hour to the place of assembly. That they have flne music&#44;
                elegant singing&#44; delightful sermons&#44; over and above the magnificence of the
                structures in which they meet &#58; &#8212; whilst we are not notified&#44; except
                by the lapse of time&#44; that the hour of prayer has arrived&#59; while we have no
                music&#44; indifferent singing&#44; no ser&#8211; mons&#44; or but poor

                dismissed the congregation to their homes and their daily toil. Then were no days of

                to attract us to the Synagogue we envy the gentiles in their possession of
                music&#44; of song&#44; of eloquent preaching&#44; of fine buildings. But&#44; in
                the name of righteousness &#33; what is it that we want &#63; I acknowledge that it
                is highly requisite&#44; and it is in fact honouring the sanctuary&#44; that the

                as decorum in the outward demeanour of the worshippers. I am as anxious as any one
                can be that&#44; since we do sing the praises of God in hymns and <pb n="216"/> 216

                as great a degree as the case admits of. But beyond this admission I cannot proceed.
                Within it I do not care how many regulations are introduced&#44; to give
                effectiveness to the service&#44; to make strangers ac&#8211; knowledge&#44; when
                they enter here&#44; that they feel themselves as being in a place of worship. But
                to go farther and to introduce new attractions in the house of prayer&#44; I am
                entirely unwilling&#44; deeming it a profanation of the reverence due to the
                sanctuary. Do not let us forget that we resort hither to pray&#44; not to be
                amused&#59; we enter the synagogue because we are sinful creatures who have to ask
                the favour and forgiveness of the Lord&#44; but not as visitors who have a right to
                expect some compensation for the time they spend in attending a place which has no
                intrinsic at&#8211; tractions for them. Music&#44; the most ravishing even&#44; if
                it creates a momentary feeling of solemn pleasure&#44; soon fades from the
                memory&#44; and leaves no religious impression on the mind&#59; it is a sound&#44;
                and nothing else&#44; and that religion is weak indeed&#44; that faith is sorely
                defective which must be urged by the voice of the organ&#44; or the sound of a
                trumpet. &#34;Were it that the custom of Israel had sanctioned this as an
                accom&#8211; paniment to the worship of the synagogue&#44; we might acquiesce in its
                retention &#59; but to introduce it against the experience of all past ages&#44;
                except during the per&#8211; formance of the daily sacrifice at the temple&#44; is
                placing too high a value upon what is not required in the house of prayer as an
                expression of a devout feeling. Man is so apt to deceive himself in fancying that he
                serves God&#44; when he does act merely from a motive to please himself&#59; and I

                217 clamour for attraction and variety in our service is more owing to a want of
                faith than to the impulse of piety. I am loth to ascribe unworthy motives to any
                one&#44; especially those who appear zealous in religion&#44; though their zeal be
                new&#8211;born and of but yesterday&#59; still I confess that I look with
                suspicion&#44; nay&#44; with ab&#8211; horrence upon the profession of those whose
                religion consists in talking about synagogues or churches&#44; and how they should
                and ought to be regulated&#44; whilst otherwise the positive commandments find but
                little favour in their eyes. Reforms from such as these must be very questionable
                &#59; and nevertheless it is only such as these who deplore the absence of grandeur
                from our worship. &#8212; It is true&#44; long&#8211;standing abuses are not to be
                continued&#44; simply because they are ven&#8211; erable&#59; but who dares to say
                that our worship is an abuse of common sense&#63; Irregularities have crept in&#59;
                but these belong not to the system&#59; leave them out&#44; and the essence
                nevertheless remains&#59; but if you introduce the gentile worship&#44; the spirit
                of Judaism flies away&#44; I fear never more to return&#44; unless the mercy of the
                Lord again revive it by his mighty power. I am no enemy to improvement&#44; but a
                foe with all my heart to innovations&#59; I love to hear the loud Amen from the
                hundreds assembled in the house of God&#44; it tells of faith in the law of
                Israel&#44; it bespeaks that the hearers feel that the Lord is their God&#59; I love
                to hear the loud acclaim &#34;The Lord is the God &#33;&#34; when we recite the
                prayers for the for&#8211; giveness of sin&#44; and when the Day of Kippur closes

                believers feel in exclaiming Adonai Ay chad &#59; it is a testimony borne every day
                to the undying trust of the genera&#8211; tions of Abraham. Now&#44; imagine for a
                moment that we should reform all this&#44; shut up the mouth of the people&#44; that
                the choir be not interrupted&#44; introduce the measured chaunt instead of the
                freedom of prayer in which we now rejoice&#44; &#8212; and then answer me where we
                should find the soul&#8211;stirring effects which our rit&#8211; ual is so well
                calculated to inspire&#44; however neglect and carelessness may at present mar its
                beauty. A choir singing to a musical accompaniment may be pretty&#59; but it is not
                a religious feeling which would require it. And whilst the choir is thus
                singing&#44; the congregation must needs be silent&#59; and little by little the
                spirit of prayer will be lost in the tumult of the music&#44; whatever may be said
                of its tendency to raise devotional thoughts&#44; and the prayer&#8211;books will

                to do for the congregation during their presence in the synagogue. Heaven save us
                from such a reform&#44; from such a de&#8211; struction rather&#59; it will be death
                to us&#44; the moment such a thing becomes general&#44; and we appeal for proof to
                the few places where it has been introduced&#44; that religiousness upon a Jewish
                foundation has decreased instead of becoming strengthened&#44; as its advocates
                alleged beforehand would be the result. I do not wish to&#8211;day to utter all I

                brethren&#44; we should avoid&#44; as inimical to the sanctuary&#44; to be led away
                by the pomp and circumstance which at&#8211; tract other persuasions to their
                churches. I do not wish to be illiberal&#44; but I honestly believe&#44; that the
                showiness which is witnessed in some establishments owes its origin to the power
                which this has over the mind of the multitude. People like something to speak
                of&#44; to look at &#59; and they who preside over va&#8211; rious denominations
                make good use of this fact to allure visitors to their assemblies&#44; well knowing
                that many will become converts if their fancy be once cap&#8211; tivated&#44; and
                under the full assurance that this same circumstance will attract their own members
                likewise to remain in their communion. Now&#44; our religion ought to scorn anything
                so akin to trick&#44; as this all evidently is. It is the emanation of the
                instruction of divine wisdom acting upon the unbought reason of man&#59; at Sinai
                the people were instructed&#44; taught&#44; not amused&#44; nor attracted&#59; the
                terrors of the day were almost calculated to repel the timid and vacil&#8211;
                lating&#59; but the truth brought the trembling recipients of its behests to stand
                though awe&#8211;stricken&#44; till the whole Decalogue was announced. In accordance
                with this high principle we have always disdained all artifice in the spread of our
                faith &#33; there it stands as it proceeded from the hands of God &#33; there is the
                law as we received it &#33; there is the testimony as it was handed down to us &#59;
                and here&#44; in this book of prayer&#44; are the ancestral forms which have
                assisted the pious in their devotion for two thousand years and more. I state this
                long period &#59; for though some alterations <pb n="220"/> 220 REVERENCE FOR THE
                SANCTUARY. have been introduced from time to time&#44; still the main portions&#44;
                independently of the extracts from Scripture which are interwoven in our ritual&#44;
                have remained essentially the same for more than twenty centuries. &#8212; In this
                same light must we still walk&#59; for the sanctuary so long honoured by the
                blessing and approbation of God&#44; which has been the resort of so many saints and
                martyrs&#44; ought not to be violently invaded by men of yesterday&#44; who merely
                awaken to piety to destroy what has withstood the assaults of centuries. Equally
                futile with the want of attractiveness of the service&#44; is the charge of the
                meanness of our houses of prayer. God needs not a gorgeous temple to be invoked in
                &#59; He listens to us wherever we assemble to invoke his ISTame &#59; be this in
                the gold&#8211;covered house of the wise Solomon&#44; or the thatched roof where
                persecuted exiles meet in fear and terror of the per&#8211; secutor&#59; be this on
                the boiling waves of the storm&#8211; urged ocean&#44; or the quiet glades of the
                forest land&#8211; scape. He is everywhere&#44; and everywhere He is alike
                Father&#44; God&#44; Saviour. Only bring hearts full of prayerful thoughts&#44; of
                humility and truth&#44; and it matters not whether your walls be rude or
                decorated&#44; whether your structure stands firm&#44; or the stars of heaven beam
                through the crevices of the cabin where you meet. Do not let human pride teach you
                to re&#8211; gard yourselves more than God&#39;s will&#59; if your syna&#8211; gogue

                to let the Law remain under an humble tent&#44; while 3*011 dwell yourselves in
                sumptuous houses. For in this respect&#44; too&#44; proper regard must be had to the
                limits where humility would degenerate into a forgetfulness of higher duties.
                &#8212; But&#44; let us be pros&#8211; perous as we may&#44; we ought never to think
                of deco&#8211; rating the interior of our houses of prayer with pic&#8211; tures and
                sculptured decorations&#44; which&#44; though so much employed by the gentiles&#44;
                are foreign to our ideas of propriety and the express letter of the law. Let them
                retain the advantage of splendour&#44; only let ours be the decoration of holiness
                which receives the approbation of our God. It is indeed to be regretted that so
                little instruction in the synagogue is aiforded to the people. Pulpit addresses have
                something in them to arouse the slum&#8211; berers on the way of righteousness. But
                circum&#8211; stanced as we have been for many hundred years&#44; scattered in small
                numbers everywhere&#44; it was impos&#8211; sible always to procure men in whom the
                power of words dwelled. By degrees what was unattainable was considered useless&#59;
                and now it is difficult&#44; in the revival of a desire for knowledge&#44; to effect
                at once what has been so long in a state of torpor. Still&#44; I cannot say that
                much is lost by this absence of fre&#8211; quent preaching &#58; we have the Law
                &#59; this is eloquent enough&#44; far more so than the puny imitations of later
                ages. Let Israel study it with diligence and faith &#59; and little need they envy
                the army of speakers who often pervert the text merely to show their own in&#8211;

                Iyar 14th. &#124; 5604 May 3d. DISCOURSE XIV. THE REVELATION ON HOREB. Sovereign of
                the Universe&#44; whose mercy embraces all that has life &#33; we bow before Thee in
                humble ado&#8211; ration. If we lift our eyes unto the material world&#44; we
                discover Thee in the works which thy hands have wrought &#59; if we turn our look
                unto the spirit which dwells within us&#44; we distinguish in it thy creative
                energy&#44; the Parent of all that exists &#59; and if we raise our view to the
                wisdom which shines so abundantly from amidst the book which is the direction of our
                life&#44; we shall have cause for gratitude that it was Thou&#44; Father &#33; who
                hast written it for our instruc&#8211; tion. Humble and high alike are thy
                creatures&#44; and the foolish and the wise are alike guided by Thee. How then shall
                we adore Thee&#44; the Lord of all spirits&#63; How shall fallible man sing thy
                praises&#44; God of all flesh &#63; &#8212; weak in our strength&#44; fallible in
                our wisdom&#44; <pb n="224"/> 224 THE REVELATION ON HOREB. we can only bow in
                silence and adore thy power&#44; which redeemed our body &#39;from thraldom&#44; thy
                wis&#8211; dom&#44; which taught us thy ways with man&#44; and thy superabundant
                mercy&#44; which has preserved us unde&#8211; stroyed in thy presence. may it be thy
                will&#44; this day&#44; and all the days of our existence&#44; to render us truly
                conscious how much thy might&#44; wisdom&#44; and mercy have wrought for us &#59;
                that our hearts may not rise in rebellion and pride above thy instruction&#44; but
                devote themselves forever and aye to be servants in that holy structure of faith and
                duty&#44; which thy voice erected from the summit of Horeb&#44; when thy thun&#8211;
                ders&#44; and thy lightnings&#44; and thy clouds of glory sub&#8211; dued the will
                of the children of Israel&#44; whilst the knowledge of Thee&#44; Lord of truth &#33;
                was implanted in the souls of thy adorers. And how abiding has been this holy
                structure &#33; Centuries have passed since it arose before our eyes &#59; we have
                at times been obe&#8211; dient&#44; at times rebellious &#59; nations&#44; then
                unborn&#44; rose up like the grass&#44; and have withered like the flowers of the
                field&#59; and our race has been scattered&#44; and the outward temple
                destroyed&#59; yet has it&#44; thy Word&#44; stood firm&#44; unmoved&#44;
                unshaken&#44; and it still abides with us&#44; to be our teacher&#44; our guide&#44;
                our testimony. Do Thou&#44; God &#33; therefore uphold what thy wisdom has made&#44;
                and teach us thy fear&#44; that we may glorify thy name and bless thy power&#44;
                forever and ever. Amen. Brethren &#33; Malachi&#44; the last of the prophets&#44; at
                the close of his book&#44; exclaims as the summing up of his prophetic mission &#58;
                    <pb n="225"/> THE REVELATION ON IIOREB. 225 &#34; Remember ye the law of
                Moses&#44; my servant&#44; to whom I com&#8211; manded on Horeb&#44; for all
                Israel&#44; statutes and judgments.&#34; Mal&#8211; achi iii. 22. The seer only adds
                the promise of the mission of Elijah to restore peace and to announce the
                redeemer&#44; whose coming will be salvation to those who will re&#8211; pent&#44;
                and punishment to those who refuse to believe&#44; when the mouth of prophecy was
                closed unto the world until the restoration of the glory to Zion&#44; and the return
                of the dominion to whom it pertaineth. We may&#44; therefore&#44; boldly assume&#44;
                that with the last outpouring of his spirit&#44; which renders man wise unto
                salvation&#44; the God of Israel&#44; who was from eternity&#44; and will ever abide
                in glory&#44; again sanctified and con&#8211; firmed what He had announced on the
                first Pentecost&#44; the recurrence of which festival we now celebrate&#44; when it
                was his pleasure to become himself&#44; without the intervention of a messenger&#44;
                the Teacher and Guide of the people that lie had purchased and formed to proclaim
                his praise. The call is addressed to all Israel&#44; to every one whose lineage or
                choice makes him one of those who have a share in the heritage of Jacob&#59; and
                each one of all these is admonished to remember the law&#59; &#8212; because&#44; in
                the first place&#44; it was commanded by God &#59; secondly&#44; because with the
                observance thereof are connected the hope of salvation&#44; and the exemption from
                the curse which attaches itself by the immutable will of God to disobedience.
                &#8212; And this day of Pen&#8211; tecost is well fitted to induce us to dwell upon
                the <pb n="226"/> 226 THE REVELATION ON HOREB. theme&#44; and to refresh our memory
                with the great doings of the Lord&#44; when He instituted the seed of Abraham a
                nation before Him&#44; to stand foremost among the families of the earth&#44; as a
                kingdom of priests and a holy people. It is for this reason that our wise men have
                instituted the particular portion&#44; embracing the descent on Sinai and the ten
                com&#8211; mandments&#44; to be read in all our assemblies as the lesson of the
                day&#44; in order to recall every year&#44; on its anniversary&#44; the great event
                which contains the seed of all that the Lord will ever do to bring the world under
                the subjection of the truth&#44; the germ&#44; as it were&#44; of the emancipation
                of mankind from error&#44; at the time when a new energy will be infused in the sons
                of Adam&#44; who will have been spared&#44; to seek the Lord and his strength. Ye
                sons of Israel&#44; remember the law of Moses &#33; When you enter upon the busy
                path of life&#44; when you seek your daily bread by the toil of your hands&#44; when
                the hours of labour follow unceasingly one upon the other&#44; when care is
                there&#44; and temptation should point out a probable means of enriching
                yourselves&#44; in contra&#8211; vention of the will of God&#44; at the expense of
                the rights of others &#58; O&#44; then remember the law of justice&#44; which
                descended unto you from heaven &#59; lay it as a check upon your spirit&#44; and
                allow not the tempter to tind a response in your heart&#59; but toil on&#44; toil
                on&#44; amid care&#44; even amid despondency &#59; your God watches you&#44; He
                beholds your sorrows&#44; and will bless the faithful servants who eschew evil and
                do good&#44; because they thus deem themselves fulfilling the will of their Maker.
                And before long the task will be lightened&#44; and you will bless the hour that
                your religion coun&#8211; <pb n="227"/> THE REVELATION ON HOREB. 227 selled you to
                prefer honourable poverty to inglorious ease&#59; and mankind too will accord you
                the meed of approbation&#44; and be improved by the example of the triumph which you
                achieved in subduing your evil desires&#44; in subjecting your inclinations to the
                statutes of the law &#33; But when prosperity is yours&#44; ye favoured ones of the
                earth &#33; when you see your substance multiply&#44; your children grow up around
                your table like olive shoots in a fruitful soil &#59; if ease and health crown your
                man&#8211; hood&#44; and everything invites you to pleasure and en&#8211;
                joyment&#58; O then remember the law of Moses&#44; the servant of God. The
                teacher&#44; too&#44; like yourselves&#44; ye fortunate &#33; was great in worldly
                things &#59; he was the adopted son of a princess of Egypt &#59; endowed with a mind
                of a high order&#44; he might&#44; with his courage and address&#44; have stood
                foremost&#44; had so it pleased him&#44; amidst the throng of honoured menials who
                sur&#8211; rounded the great Pharaoh&#39;s throne. But he dis&#8211; dained the pomp
                and enjoyment of a courtly life&#59; he saw his brothers enslaved&#44; and he could
                not resist taking part in their sorrow &#59; in his zeal&#44; an agent of the tyrant
                fell by his hands&#44; and he fled from his na&#8211; tive soil to roam alone in
                foreign lands. Again he rose from the lowly state of a shepherd in the desert&#44;
                and he issued forth the leader of the house of Israel&#44; after their chains of
                bondage had been broken &#58; and yet he loved not to rest in idleness&#44; though
                age now counselled repose &#59; he gave himself up to the glorious task of
                instructing and remodelling&#44; by the divine aid&#44; an entire people&#44; though
                they were thankless and constantly forgetful of the good things the Lord had wrought
                for them through the agency <pb n="228"/> 228 THE REVELATION ON IIOREB. of his
                servant&#59; and lie&#44; therefore&#44; became the means&#44; the instrument of the
                noblest monument of divine wisdom being imparted to man. He received&#44; as a
                gift&#44; the commandments from on High&#44; and they are called&#44; after him&#44;
                &#34;the Law of Moses&#59;&#34; they were given for Israel and for the world&#44;
                and the son of Amram&#39;s name is imperishably interwoven with them in all the
                lands where the glorious tidings have pene&#8211; trated. Remember then&#44; in your
                moments of ease&#44; the law which has descended through Moses &#59; let it admonish
                you to beware of yielding to the temptation of luxury and sinful enjoyment&#59;
                peruse its pages&#44; that it may tell you what the Lord asks of you&#44; and abide
                strictly by his ordinances and judgments. think not that your opulence or your
                station can be any ex&#8211; cuse for your neglect of our heavenly faith &#33;
                You&#44; though blessed&#44; belong to Israel &#33; you&#44; though at ease&#44; are
                amenable to the God who spoke through Moses &#33; Remember your mortality&#44;
                remember that the Lord is undying &#59; let you escape from visitation a hundred
                times&#44; retribution is nevertheless nigh if you continue to forget&#44; if you
                indulge in your desires&#44; unmindful of what has been written in the book of the
                law. believe not that your station exempts you from duty&#33; What is your
                greatness&#44; when you come hither to pray &#63; What is your strength&#44; when
                you stay at home unwilling to humble yourselves &#63; To&#8211;day you are in

                your glory abideth not&#59; and before the cup is drained&#44; the bitterness of
                wormwood is mingled with the spark&#8211; ling wine. And still you refuse to
                remember&#44; still <pb n="229"/> THE REVELATION ON HOREB. 229 you are unwilling to
                hear &#33; O&#44; blind to your clanger&#44; you hurry to your own destruction&#59;

                excellence&#44; and He will sift you out as the chaff from the wheat&#44; and leave
                you to the contempt and de&#8211; struction which you have so eagerly courted. O fly

                is dashed from your lips. come to the word of God&#44; remember the commandments
                which were proclaimed from Horeb&#44; and be Israelites&#44; dis&#8211;

                charity&#44; by more devotion than those whose necessities leave them no time for
                ex&#8211; tended usefulness. Become you the guides to those who are lost&#44; the
                props to those who need a stay &#59; and let the book of the law be a witness for
                you&#44; that 3^011 have not lived forgetful of your destiny&#44; unworthy of being

                you too obedient to the law promulgated this day&#44; and be in very truth sons of

                against you&#44; to flat&#8211; ter you&#44; to bribe you to forsake what you have
                so long cherished &#59; they offer you liberty&#44; they offer you ease&#44; they
                offer you wealth&#44; they offer you high places and preferment&#44; so you will but
                renounce your reli&#8211; gion&#44; and sit down in communion with the sons of the
                stranger. And you waver &#59; you are weary of the long scene of strife which the
                world has imposed on you&#59; you hunger after the fleshpots of modern Egypt&#44;
                and you feel inclined to embrace the murderous hand which deceit and hypocrisy hold
                out to you. &#8212; But O&#44; beware&#33; remember. the law of Moses the servant of
                God&#33; consider what is there recorded&#44; reflect what this must teach you. You
                envy now the ease of the gentiles who oppress you &#59; so did our forefathers when
                they worked day after day in the brickyards of Mitz&#8211; raim&#39;s ruler&#59; you
                envy now the power which is re&#8211; moved from Judah&#59; so did ancient Israel
                when they were slaves unto Egypt in all manner of work in the field. And what does
                history teach us on this point&#63; But&#44; that not many days elapsed&#44; when
                the depth of sorrow was changed into joy&#44; and the tyrant&#39;s exalta&#8211;
                tion turned into sobs and moaning. It is hard to bear the contumely of the
                world&#59; it is hard to know that we are unjustly spurned from no evil that we have
                done&#44; only because we bear in our veins blood from a distant lineage&#44; and
                because our law is one of ancient date. But how dastardly and contemptibly would we
                act&#44; could we submit to profess opinions which we do not hold&#44; to swear with
                our lips that we believe as true what our soul loathes&#44; whilst we are uttering
                the Words that sever us outwardly from the community of Israel &#33; How ineffably
                base must be that wretch <pb n="231"/> THE REVELATI0N ON HOREB. 231 who claims the
                honour which man can confer&#44; to be exalted to some subordinate employment in the
                state&#44; to be a legislator where his voice is scarcely heard&#44; at the price of
                being a traitor to his God &#33; How grovel&#8211; ling must be that spirit who&#44;
                for the sake of so much money&#44; of so many pieces of silver&#44; declares that he
                no longer has part in Israel&#39;s hope&#44; no share in Is&#8211; rael&#39;s
                law&#44; no portion in Israel&#39;s God &#33; And such as these present themselves
                to our view &#33; they call them&#8211; selves men &#33; converts to a better faith
                &#33; But 0&#44; let us be wise&#44; let nothing induce us to swerve &#33; What
                mat&#8211; ters it to us&#44; when our race is run&#44; that we have been the humble
                and the trodden down &#63; Each one of our sighs is remembered by the Ancient of
                days&#59; each one of our tears is treasured up in his secret abode &#59; each one
                of our prayers is recorded in his book of memo&#8211; rial&#59; and then instead of

                been reared&#44; but re&#8211; member the law of Moses which was announced from
                Horeb &#59; cling to it as you would to a tower of strength&#44; and forsake it not
                as though it were your very life&#44; the heart&#39;s blood which circulates in your

                on the earth with the wrath of God impending over you&#44; because you have forsaken

                necks&#59; you know not how humbled the unfor&#8211; tunate is who is daily scorned
                because that he is a Jew&#59; you&#44; therefore&#44; do not perhaps experience the
                deep consolation whicn springs to the brethren in other lands&#44; from the
                possession of the only treasure which the world cannot deprive them of. Ye
                mingle&#44; as I said&#44; freely amidst your gentile neighbours&#44; and you see.
                their manners&#44; you observe their customs&#44; and listen to their conversation.
                However you may feel affected towards them&#44; however kindly you may think of all
                who bear the human form &#58; you ought to be aware that gentiles&#44; if they are
                sincere in their re&#8211; ligious professions&#44; feel themselves in duty bound to
                endeavour to make proselytes to their own tenets. &#8212; A Jewish maiden&#44; from
                pure kindness&#44; has stood by the death&#8211;bed of her gentile friend&#59; and
                there the dying girl adjured her by the peace which she felt in parting from this
                world to seek the same hope in the religion of the stranger. No opportunity is
                lost&#44; no solemn occasion is pretermitted&#44; to make a strong im&#8211;
                pression where this is possible. You Israelites&#44; who arc weak in your own
                faith&#44; you among our people who feel not deeply penetrated with the earnestness
                of religious conviction&#44; and even you who are truly faithful&#44; cannot
                comprehend the strong hold which the persuasion &#34;that no salvation can be had
                beyond the limited pale of a particular church&#34; has upon the 20* <pb n="234"/>
                234 THE REVELATION ON HOREB. votaries of the same. They persuade themselves that it
                is their business to see that no soul be lost by their omission to admonish &#59;
                hence they seize every occasion to influence those who come near them&#44; they draw
                the conversation upon matters of religion&#44; and always finish by hoping that the
                person appealed to will see the error of his way and &#8212; &#8211;join himself to
                their creed. I can feel the embarrassment of a timid girl in a circle of
                Nazarenes&#44; alone of the faith of Is&#8211; rael&#44; adjured by a dying friend
                to forsake the truth and join the vanities of a stranger&#39;s belief&#59; since
                in&#8211; experienced persons are but too apt to imagine that sincerity of
                profession&#44; especially in the solemn mo&#8211; ments of death&#44; is a certain
                token that the opinions entertained are sure and true. In this matter&#44; then&#44;
                it is requisite to be strong in resistance&#44; and not to be drawn aside by one
                consideration or the other. The opinions of a dying person are no more true than
                those of one in full health &#59; they are merely an evi&#8211; dence that the
                sufferer was strongly impressed with their importance&#44; probably because he knew
                no oth&#8211; ers&#44; and consequently he gives utterance to them in the last
                moments of consciousness which are left him&#44; as the strongest consolation he can
                frame in the dread hour of the change from time to eternity. Surely a person dying
                is not for this reason a prophet&#44; that his words should bear the seal of
                infallibility. I respect the sincerity of such a person&#44; whose last thoughts
                confirm the consistency of an entire life &#59; but beyond this they can have no
                value for any one who is famil&#8211; iar with the workings of the human mind.
                &#8212; But I am wandering too far. All I meant to call your at&#8211; tention to
                was&#44; that in your intercourse with the world <pb n="235"/> THE REVELATION ON

                would move heaven and earth to make one proselyte&#44; especially if this person be
                one of Ja&#8211; cob&#39;s sons or daughters. As I said&#44; no opportunity will be
                omitted to encompass this result&#44; and in sea&#8211; son and out of season the
                shafts of argument or of ridicule will be levelled against our blessed faith&#44; as
                though it were to be attacked at all hazards. Some one may smile in his strength
                against these useless efforts&#44; these harmless arrows shot from bows wielded by
                weak hands. But&#44; brethren&#44; the persons attacked are not always the learned
                and strong&#8211;minded&#44; they are but too often the weak&#44; the
                inexperienced&#44; chil&#8211; dren or minors&#44; whose knowledge is insufficient
                to cope with the dangerous sophistry which our oppo&#8211; nents know so well how to
                employ. To you all&#44; there&#8211; fore&#44; the prophet speaks&#58; &#34;

                likewise for the truth&#44; in order that through them too the law may be
                remembered. &#8212; Let it be impressed on your minds&#44; that the intercourse with
                the world not rarely blunts the feelings&#44; and re&#8211; moves the great barrier
                which previous impressions opposed at one time to the approach of new ideas. The
                example of others is a most powerful incentive to give up our own views of
                right&#44; especially if we are not very earnest in our own conduct. The per&#8211;
                suasion of our friends&#44; persons whom we esteem for the benevolence of their

                hearts&#44; will more or less weigh with the hest of us. Reflect on this upon your
                entrance into the great world&#44; and regulate your conduct accordingly. Let it be
                your constant aim to oppose a sturdy resist&#8211; ance to any invitation to follow
                your gentile friends in their amusements&#44; when they are in contradiction to your
                received instruction. If you are invited&#44; for instance&#44; to he present at a
                ceremony as a witness in which no Israelite should take part&#59; if you are called
                upon to partake of food which you are taught to be prohibited&#59; if you are asked
                to attend on the Sab&#8211; bath assemblies which are a desecration of the day of
                rest &#58; let no complaisance on your part induce you to participate&#44; and do
                not excuse yourselves by saying &#34;It is but a trifle.&#34; It is by trifles we
                begin to tread the road of sin&#44; and we end by great transgressions. Should you
                find that the zeal of your neighbours leads them to decry your religion&#44; you
                ought to forbid the recurrence of such a breach of politeness&#44; and if it be
                repeated&#44; or at once&#44; avoid the person who is guilty of this treason against
                your faith. A fair dis&#8211; cussion is one thing &#58; a bold appeal to do so
                great a sin as apostacy quite another. If you are skilled in Scriptures&#44; you may
                freely meet your friendly oppo&#8211; nent upon the broad ground which they present
                to us &#59; but take heed that you resent any direct appeals with becoming firmness.
                Do not&#44; above all&#44; be ashamed of being Israelites&#59; let the world
                know&#44; and particularly your proselyting friends&#44; that you arc proud of your

                anx&#8211; ious to found a strict and consistent morality&#44; no less than a rigid
                observance of the ceremonies&#44; upon the text of the Bible&#44; have left us in
                their writings many beautiful moral doctrines which&#44; when observed&#44; will add
                dignity and worth to our religious character&#44; and tend to render the practice of
                the divine precepts as honourable in the eyes of the world&#44; as it is
                merito&#8211; rious in the sight of the Lord. So much has been said of rabbinical
                authority&#44; with such a sneer at times have sciolists treated men whose
                shoestrings <pb n="241"/> OUR RELIGIOUS TEACHERS. 241 they are not worthy to
                loosen&#44; that a man who did not know better might suppose&#44; that all they had
                ever taught was fraught with mischief and folly. This age is one&#44; emphatically
                speaking&#44; of pulling down. Every day some new&#8211;fangled notion is
                propounded&#44; some singular thought broached and propagated with all the zeal of
                sectarianism&#44; and with the intolerance with which ultra liberalists always
                regard those who refuse to admit their theories before they have been proved
                correct. Let it then not surprise you that so many systematic attacks are made upon
                the remains of our ancient learning&#44; by persons whose greatest pleasure it is to
                decry what they do not understand&#44; and to despise everything old&#44; as though
                every day must bring forth a new system of wisdom and gov&#8211; ernment&#44; as
                though every thing which has come down to us from former years were all conceived in
                folly and darkness. With all the well&#8211;known illiberality of innovators&#44; it
                is nevertheless remarkable to wit&#8211; ness among some Israelites such a haste for
                innova&#8211; tion&#44; such a rage for destroying. Let them but con&#8211; sider
                for a moment who were those teachers who guided our people&#44; from Moses to our
                day&#44; and surely they&#44; the most ultra of them&#44; must feel a profound
                veneration for men who pursued so unwaveringly&#44; amidst so many
                disappointments&#44; the duties to which they had devoted themselves. In the days of
                the Bible there surely was no profit connected with the teaching of the holy
                word&#59; nay&#44; there was danger from the ungodly&#44; that in their wrath they
                might strike down those who uttered reproof to them&#44; and testified against their
                wickedness. During the con&#8211; tinuance of the second temple&#44; to how many

                bloodthirsty invaders from without &#33; And since our glory fell&#44; what have not
                our teachers had to endure from all who hated Israel&#44; and endeavoured to blot
                out their name from the page of the world&#39;s history &#33; Indeed&#44; we can
                scarcely designate a single period of long duration&#44; when the study and teaching
                of God&#39;s law brought any worldly ease and tangible gain. No&#44; we must come to
                the conclusion&#44; that it was a serious pursuit with the great mass of the
                teachers&#44; that they went forth with the word of instruction upon their lips
                &#59; it was a solemn conviction that they were benefiting their fellow&#8211;men by
                their labours&#44; which not rarely exposed them to all the hardships of a campaign
                without the glory of worldly conquest. We should therefore be careful how we listen
                to those&#44; whose un acquaintance with the circumstances of the times in which
                some of our books were written&#44; induces them to cast censure upon their
                writers&#59; and who not alone condemn the authors of what they think ideas unfit
                for the present age&#44; so boastfully called that of enlightenment&#44; but those
                likewise whose works and whose sayings are to this day the themes which en&#8211;
                gage the most learned and refined in their elucida&#8211; tion. I am not the
                panegyrist of ancient abuses&#44; nor of errors which may among mauy good things
                have come down to us&#59; but surely it is no evidence of nar&#8211;
                row&#8211;mindedness nor of an opposition to improvement&#44; to be unwilling to
                admit the soundness of new views&#44; till they have something more to recommend
                them than the mere novelty or the daring with which they are propounded. It admits
                of no question that so <pb n="243"/> OUR RELIGIOUS TEACHERS. 243 much good has
                resulted to our nation from the la&#8211; bours of their great teachers&#44; such as
                Simon the Just&#44; Hillel&#44; Rabban Gamliel&#44; Jochanan son of Zaccay&#44;
                Rabbi Judah the chief&#44; Rab&#44; Samuel&#44; Rab Ashi&#44; Saa&#8211; diah
                Gaon&#44; Yarchi&#44; Aben Ezra&#44; Maiinonides&#44; and a bright galaxy of
                innumerable others&#44; that no one can be otherwise than safe in following them in
                the way they have pointed out&#58; whilst on the other hand there is the greatest
                danger to enlist one&#39;s self under the banner of some of our modern guides
                who&#44; in their mode of instruction&#44; as I have said already&#44; en&#8211;

                establish any thing useful in&#8211; stead. There can be no safety in a system which
                only denies former views&#44; and we ought to avoid it as we would shun an evident
                sin. There is therefore every reason to mistrust our innovators&#44; who under the
                pretence of reforming Judaism&#44; have introduced&#44; or endeavour to
                introduce&#44; ideas and rules of conduct contrary to our received opinions. They
                are perhaps proud of their attainments in science&#44; which however confer on them
                no claims to become reformers in re&#8211; ligion. They say&#44; perhaps with
                truth&#44; that the ancients were not deeply learned in worldly matters. But this
                fact does not weaken the authority of the latter in the light of religious
                teachers&#44; in which we have always been taught to regard them. It is the
                mis&#8211; fortune of modern times that their enlightenment has been too sudden&#59;
                the darkness preceding them had been of such long continuance&#44; that the light
                which was shed upon them&#44; from so many new and formerly inaccessible
                sources&#44; has blinded those who were ac&#8211; customed to the feeble glimmer of
                the little scientific <pb n="244"/> 244 OUR RELIGIOUS TEACHERS. knowledge&#44; that
                came to them from the by&#8211;roads of science. Our people had been restricted for
                centu&#8211; ries to the study of their own books&#44; few knew any&#8211; thing of
                the &#34;Greek branches of wisdom&#44;&#34; and what is more&#44; valued them too
                little&#44; looking perhaps upon them as inimical to a religious life. How far their
                fears have been justified&#44; let the bitter example of modern dereliction testify.
                Jews are not enemies to secular knowledge &#59; but truth compels us to say&#44;
                that many who have made the arts and sciences their study&#44; have done but little
                honour to Judaism. Many have through apostacy entered upon public offices&#44;
                whilst without their dangerous acquirements they would have remained honest&#44;
                though humble Israel&#8211; ites. Many have studied the sciences&#44; become
                profi&#8211; cients iu the healing art&#58; and their lives&#44; though they yet
                profess the Jewish religion in name&#44; are but a miserable exponent of the fruits
                of their learning. These and many others seem to say by their public acts&#44; if
                not by their private thoughts&#58; &#34; We are now in possession of a talisman
                unknown to those unini&#8211; tiated in the mysteries of sciences&#59; we are
                removed from the bond of obedience&#44; and we revel freely in the liberty of an
                enlightened conscience.&#34; How lit&#8211; tle there is in all such things to make
                a sincere Jew fall in love with a pursuit which is so destructive in others&#44; I
                need not impress upon your minds. And if the few who studied philosophy&#44; so to
                say&#44; by stealth in the dark ages showed an equal disregard of religion with the
                modern professors&#44; and doctors&#44; and public functionaries&#44; it is no
                wonder that the lovers of religion discountenanced such dangerous acquirements. <pb

                connexion between irreligion and the sciences&#59; no one need tell me&#44; that the
                deeper one looks into the book of nature the higher will rise his veneration for
                God&#59; there is no occasion to assure me&#44; that the Jew must become the more
                strongly wedded to his faith&#44; when he enters upon the study of history&#44; and
                discovers how griev&#8211; ously his forefathers suffered for the faith they have
                handed down to him&#44; and how many persecutions they cheerfully braved only to be
                permitted to breathe their last breath as Jews&#44; even if this was at the
                burn&#8211; ing stake. I know all this&#44; and so know the blessed teachers who to
                this day honestly proclaim the law as they have received it. But it is nevertheless
                true that the sudden change has been to&#44; alas&#33; too many&#44; like the food
                placed before a famished person&#44; who devours eagerly more than his feeble
                digestion will bear&#44; and who suffers in consequence excruciating pains&#44; or
                perhaps death&#44; from his unguarded impru&#8211; dence. Just so was it with
                us&#59; the universities were opened again to receive us&#44; and we could learn
                Latin and Greek&#44; mathematics and history&#59; and we seized with the eagerness
                of a protracted abstinence upon the long&#8211;denied indulgence &#59; but we lost
                sight of the fact that these things were merely additions to the divine wisdom&#44;
                and the weak in faith substituted what they learned in the schools for the light of
                rev&#8211; elation. At first there was a little struggle between ancient ideas and
                the free notions of the age of change&#44; which commenced with the French
                Revolu&#8211; tion&#59; but one by one fell into the skepticism of the times&#44;
                till the evil became festering and infectious in its contact. It is but too
                true&#44; that with partial pro&#8211; 21* <pb n="246"/> 246 OUR RELIGIOUS
                TEACHERS&#44; fession of religion &#40;we will leave out of sight the downright
                apostates&#41; many endeavoured to reconcile the freedom of a gentile life with the
                dictates of our faith. Hence it resulted that&#44; where formerly it was considered
                requisite&#44; in order to be entitled to the name of a dutiful servant&#44; not to
                mention that of a pious man&#44; to practise with care every minutia of
                observance&#44; and to be engaged every day in the study of the Scripture and books
                treating on religion&#44; it became the new fashion&#44; of even the somewhat
                re&#8211; ligiously inclined&#44; to leave out as much as possible of the routine of
                duty&#44; to abridge the time of prayer and the amount of devotion hitherto in
                practice&#44; and to let the reading of secular books supplant the pe&#8211; rusal
                of those of a higher order. Nay&#44; many began to draw their mental nourishment
                from works written to ridicule religion&#44; and to cast a shadow of doubt upon all
                that is sacred. Such a course might perhaps have operated injuriously only on the
                few who fell off from the right path&#44; had the infection continued merely in the
                minds of those who had no influence on the public&#59; but at length even some of
                our leaders joined what is commonly termed the modern move&#8211; ment&#44; and they
                endeavoured to profit by the confusion of the times&#44; in place of manfully
                withstanding the baleful desire for daring innovations. Now a new system
                commenced&#59; new words were coined to throw odium on the past&#59; and we were
                entertained with such terms as &#34; Scientific Development of Judaism&#44;&#34;

                unhallowed feelings which the evil&#8211;minded have evoked. Let me state now&#44;
                once for all&#44; that I too&#44; together with many eminent men&#44; whose humble
                follower I scarcely deserve to be called&#44; am fully aware of the corruption which
                had crept in among us during centuries of oppression&#59; I know that a system of
                superstition was perfected upon the mystical notions of the middle ages&#44; notions
                which are an excrescence on&#44; not a part of our religion&#59; I know that useless
                penance&#44; and long abstinence&#44; and frequent fastings&#44; were recom&#8211;
                mended as meritorious acts. All this is true&#59; and therefore no reasonable person
                could well have found fault&#44; had the attacks of the modern new&#8211;lights been
                directed only against such matters. But this would not satisfy their towering
                ambition&#59; three hundred years before&#44; Popery had had its reformers and
                oppo&#8211; nents&#44; &#8212; men who&#44; whether from ambition or sincerity it
                matters not&#44; attacked&#44; and in a partial degree over&#8211; threw&#44; in
                many countries&#44; the political power of the pontiff who claims to this day his
                authority as the vicegerent of Heaven. And now our modern Jew&#8211; ish leaders
                would gladly be each a Luther&#44; a Melanc&#8211; thon&#44; a Zwingli&#44; or a
                Calvin&#59; they must needs contest the tradition of the fathers&#44; as theXazarene
                reformers did with the early doctrines of their church. To gain eclat&#44; something
                had to be done to attract the multi&#8211; tude&#59; and whoever is acquainted with
                human nature knows&#44; as well as I can tell him&#44; that no one is so likely to

                man who ostensibly con&#8211; tends against the slavery of opinions. Still our
                re&#8211; <pb n="248"/> 248 OUR RELIGIOUS TEACHERS. formers forgot one thing. The
                Roman power was one of political existence&#59; it rested with an iron weight upon
                the conscience and will of its own follow&#8211; ers to no greater degree&#44; than
                upon those differing from it who had to live in the lands where it had control&#59;
                in addition to which its missionaries traversed Europe&#44; Asia&#44; and
                Africa&#44; and began to extend to the conti&#8211; nent and islands of America the
                influence and dogmas of the head of their church. To disobey was at the peril of
                property&#44; of liberty&#44; and of life&#59; heresy&#44; as it was called&#44; and
                infidelity&#44; as they viewed it&#44; which included our faith&#44; were mortal
                crimes&#44; and subjected the offender to the pains and penalties of an
                inquisi&#8211; torial tribunal. And when at length the shameless bargain with
                indulgences was openly exhibited&#44; by which means the church stipulated a
                remission of sins for a certain sum of money paid to its priests&#58; it was but
                rational that a change in the minds of the people should take place&#44; and subject
                the pretensions of the papal authority to infallibility to the test of reason. Yet
                where can the lover of change find any thing analogous in onr wise men and

                and these are the men w T hom modern reformers wish to stigmatize as unwise and
                illiberal zealots &#33; these the men whom we are called upon to disown as our
                guides &#33; And what&#44; after all&#44; do the reformers chiefly aim at&#63; I
                think the greatest clamour is raised against the mode of worship&#44; as practised
                in the synagogue&#44; which&#44; it is alleged&#44; is not in consonance with the
                de&#8211; mands of the times. Granted that there are abuses&#44; and these everybody
                feels&#59; against these&#44; however&#44; the ancient teachers also exclaimed. The

                &#59;&#34; &#8212; they denounce as impious the least conversation in the
                synagogue&#44; especially during certain portions of the service &#59; whilst the
                law is read in public they prohibit prayers even to be recited&#44; although one
                should have come too late to the place of worship. What more would you wish to add
                to these directions &#63; You may am&#8211; plify&#44; but the substance is there
                before you &#59; act up to it&#44; and our synagogues will be as well regulated as
                the most fastidious can desire. All we need is for our people to value what has been
                handed down to them in this respect&#44; and w T e may safely affirm&#44; that
                decorum and devotion will be the ruling traits of our public meetings. &#8212;
                Again&#44; an objection is made to the time of the service&#44; which&#44; according
                to our tradition&#44; is for the reading of the Shemang before the expira&#8211;
                tion of the third hour of the day&#44; that is&#44; according to the calculation of
                modern time&#44; nine o&#39;clock in the morning. Now this has been found too early
                for convenience&#44; and every effort is made to postpone the commencement of the
                service to a more suitable hour. But why should we not hasten to devote the early
                hours of the Sabbath to worship&#63; is not the whole day hoty unto the Lord &#63;
                is it not his gift that it is sanctified unto his service &#63; &#8212; Then it is
                the length of the service&#44; next the too great uniformity&#44; or the re&#8211;
                petitions of the Amidah and Kaddish &#59; when in truth&#44; the whole time consumed
                by the prayers on the usual Sabbaths does not occupy more than one hour&#44; or&#44;
                at most&#44; an hour and a half. True&#44; if we do not feel <pb n="251"/> OUR
                RELIGIOUS TEACHERS. 251 earnest in the service&#44; any time is too long &#59; but
                this is what we need&#44; a feeling of devotion which will carry us to the synagogue
                and let us spend our time there in full contemplation of the great Being in whose
                presence we have appeared. The Amidah then is a prayer for the things we need
                collectively and individually&#59; it is a prayer which comprises every&#8211; thing
                which man can ask of his God &#59; the congrega&#8211; tion therefore should
                first&#44; after assenting to the ac&#8211; knowledgment of the divine kingdom in
                the Shemcmg&#44; recite it to themselves&#44; that each one for himself and for all
                may petition the divine Presence to bless him and Israel collectively with all the
                goodness&#44; which we need at his hands. Then let the representative of the
                congregation&#44; their appointed minister&#44; pro&#8211; nounce aloud&#44; as one
                of the people for all&#44; as the rep&#8211; resentative for his constituents&#44;
                the same petition for grace&#44; and let each and all assent to every petition or
                affirmation by the unanimous Amen which records&#44; as we said on a former
                occasion&#44; the concurrence of the assembled brethren in the truths of our
                religion. Yes&#44; let them in heart and soul listen devoutly to the minister&#39;s
                words&#44; let them comprise the whole of our household in their aspirations&#59;
                and&#44; when the Kcdu&#8211; shah is inserted&#44; let them tremblingly sanctify
                the Lord&#44; who appeared to his prophet in the midst of his heavenly servants&#44;
                who&#44; like Israel do on earth&#44; sanc&#8211; tify on high his holy Name&#44;
                with a love&#44; a unison&#44; a fervour to which only the pure souls of the saints
                can attain. There may&#44; however&#44; be some few repeti&#8211; tions of certain
                portions of the ritual&#44; which are not of much moment&#59; but surely it is not
                worth while to commence a violent agitation&#44; simply to remove <pb n="252"/> 252
                OUR RELIGIOUS TEACHERS. these. They are to a certainty perfectly harmless&#44;
                and&#44; whether repeated or left out&#44; will neither lengthen the service too
                much&#44; nor abbreviate it materially. &#8212; Some also find the reading of the
                law too long&#44; and wish to leave out the portion from the prophets&#44; which we
                read on every Sabbath and festival. &#8212; Again&#44; I do not see upon what system
                this is to be effected. Accord&#8211; ing to my view&#44; and every dispassionate
                person must agree with it&#44; the reading of the entire law once every year is of
                the utmost moment to all Israelites. Every one is not learned&#44; every one has not
                the leisure to pursue an even simply biblical study with much profit during the days
                of labour. To such&#44; as just described&#44; the public proclamation of the
                law&#44; once during the year&#44; must be of the utmost value&#59; the whole
                law&#44; it must not be forgotten&#44; is the code wdiich God has prescribed to
                us&#59; no part thereof has been abrogated&#44; although portions of it are no
                longer prac&#8211; ticable in our present state of dispersion and banish&#8211;
                ment. Still the precepts&#44; even those not now prac&#8211; ticable&#44; are all of
                interest to us&#59; they are our life&#44; our proof that we are God&#39;s chosen
                children. By all means then&#44; let us not withhold the bread of life from our
                brethren&#59; let us continue to proclaim it in all their dwellings&#59; it is our
                constitution&#44; our magna charta&#44; our bill of rights&#44; our declaration of
                independ&#8211; ence&#59; and let it be proclaimed where we are in bond&#8211;
                age&#44; where we arc members of the sovereign people&#44; that in it we live&#44;
                in it will we die &#33; O it is a glorious gift&#44; this law of God &#33; it is the
                wisdom of wusdoms&#44; it is the light of lights &#33; Let Israel bend the head when
                the book is elevated&#44; let them raise their hearts when its words are read &#59;

                to heaven&#44; there the herb of life which snatches the soul from death &#33;
                Ay&#44; every year let it be read aloud in all our congregations &#59; let not one
                of its precious words be omitted&#44; let not a syllable fail to sink deeply into
                the ear &#58; and we need not a bet&#8211; ter monitor to guide us aright&#44; not a
                better incentive to induce us to inquire &#34; what the Lord has taught concerning
                us.&#34; &#8212; But what of the llaphtorah&#63; is it not an addition to the
                service&#44; a useless lengthening of our stay in the synagogue &#63; is it not a
                substitute&#44; introduced during a time of persecution&#44; instead of the weekly
                portion of the law &#63; Although the latter question is undoubtedly in consonance
                with the facts&#44; we cannot admit that it is a useless addition to the
                service&#44; or that we had better shorten our sojourn at the synagogue by so much
                time as is occupied there&#8211; with. Let us see what the prophets were. They were
                men sent out from amidst the people to teach and to admonish them&#44; in accordance
                with the word of the law revealed to Moses. They again confirmed what had been given
                on Sinai&#44; and amplified the in&#8211; struction by their denunciation of the
                sins they saw perpetrated around them&#44; and added the consolations which from
                time to time they were sent to proclaim in the hearing of Israel. In other
                words&#44; the pro&#8211; phetic writings are a commentary written by inspira&#8211;
                tion upon the body of laws embraced in the Torah &#59; and whatever is spoken by the
                seers of our people&#44; will find its echo in the books of Moses. Why then should
                we not read the portions which so clearly cor&#8211; respond with the law from the
                books of the prophets &#63; do they not tend to confirm in the souls of the
                wor&#8211; shippers the faith in the truth and uprightness of their vol. v. 22 <pb

                sketches the backsliding of his contemporaries&#44; which he could not prevent&#44;
                against which he denounced the coming doom &#63; Needs it that I multiply instances
                to prove what does not in truth require proof&#63; No I I will leave the subject to
                your own reflection&#44; confident that you yourselves can find parallels enough to
                finish the argument without my aid. But let us return to our sages and their
                opponents. The Eabbis have&#44; in accordance with the right in&#8211; herent in the
                teachers selected by the people&#44; from time to time introduced ordinances&#44; as
                fences to the law&#44; that men might not inadvertently break the vital
                commandments. They proceeded upon this principle&#44; that there can be no injury in
                omitting to enjoy the things permitted&#44; if by this means we guard ourselves
                against sin. Strictly speaking&#44; nothing has been added to the law&#44; they only
                defined the extent of the precepts&#44; both the affirmative and negative kinds.
                There can be no doubt of the existence of a tradition&#44; or a received maimer of
                observing the precepts which the law contains. That all the sayings of the
                expounders of the law are absolutely traditional I will not main&#8211; tain&#44;
                nor is this the opinion of our teachers. But whether the ordinances are traditional
                or instituted for safety&#39;s sake&#44; they have become so intimately in&#8211;
                terwoven with the life of our nation&#44; that they cannot be disrupted without
                giving a severe and useless shock to our national existence. One thing is
                evident&#44; that the system of the Talmud is one of great uniformity&#44; <pb
                    n="255"/> OUR RELIGIOUS TEACHERS. 255 or rather I should say&#44; it was one of
                great uniformity. Whatever occurred in the domestic or social life of our
                people&#44; was strictly adjudged by our chiefs to the best of their capacity and
                understanding of the case&#44; according to the decisions of the wise men. There
                could be no thought of sectarianism&#44; while the means of arriving at a
                satisfactory solution were always at hand. Local customs were always permitted&#59;
                the freedom of establishing congregations on such princi&#8211; ples of government
                as pleased the majority in each was never contested&#44; so long as the usual
                officers&#44; a civil president&#44; treasurer&#44; and directors&#44; on the
                one&#44; and the Rabbi&#44; reader&#44; teacher&#44; and the subordinate
                officers&#44; on the other side&#44; were chosen. So also the form of prayer&#44; or
                Minhag&#44; was not interfered with&#44; provided&#44; as before&#44; the main
                principles of the wor&#8211; ship&#44; which are alike in all&#44; were adhered to.
                Thus it was for many centuries&#44; and there was therefore a perfect unity in the
                church of Israel&#44; with the excep&#8211; tion of a small body of literalists&#44;
                or Karaites&#44; who nevertheless have a mode of interpretation&#44; neces&#8211;
                sarily traditional&#44; though doubtless it deviates from ours. And thus it might
                have always continued&#44; had not&#44; within late years&#44; a number of ignorant
                fanatics in the first instance endeavoured to establish a mode of life of an ascetic
                and extravagant nature&#44; and to introduce the same in their worship&#44; &#8212;
                and in the next an equally unwise class sprung up who will judge every thing
                according to philosophical rules. The former are known as the Uassidim or
                Zoharites&#44; the second as the Reformers. There can be no doubt&#44; but that the
                ascetics will not long continue in their extravagant manner&#44; but will gradually
                return to the <pb n="256"/> 256 OUR RELIGIOUS TEACHERS. bosom of our community to
                which they belong. But the second class&#44; or the Reformers&#44; seem to disdain
                any thing except their own views&#59; they have drunk of wisdom&#44; still the
                stream is polluted by the worldli&#8211; ness which they have imbibed under their
                gentile masters and teachers&#59; they come to cut down&#44; and to level the
                obstructions which a life of enjoyment finds in our law and the teaching of our
                instructors. Some of them are every where&#44; though not formidable in their
                numbers as yet&#44; secretly working to sap the foundations of our system. I know
                well enough&#44; that they allege that they mean to restore&#44; to fortify &#59;
                but their words are contradicted by their acts&#59; they may perhaps be honest&#44;
                but wherever they have appeared up to this moment&#44; the course of religion has
                been backward&#44; if we take the biblical observances as a criterion. Instances
                could be produced&#59; but in a public lecture it is not fit to mention persons and
                places&#44; even should my sense of propriety not check me from so doing. Still&#44;
                from what I have seen in print&#44; I cannot hesitate saying&#44; that so is the
                case&#44; that wherever the reform mania has penetrated&#44; there also is the
                spirit of religiousness greatly weakened. Yet spite of themselves the Reformers have
                rendered a great service to our blessed cause. In former years our learned men were
                content to write for the learned&#59; because they knew that these felt a desire for
                instruc&#8211; tion in the things pertaining to the law. But in the course of time
                many were left uninformed&#44; a fatal error undoubtedly. Now the agitators have
                awakened inquiry&#44; and the means of information have become greatly increased.
                The torpor so long resting upon our masses is vanishing&#44; and
                &#34;to&#8211;morrow the Lord <pb n="257"/> OUR RELIGIOUS TEACHERS. 257 will make
                known who is his&#44; and who is holy him will He bring near to himself.&#34;
                Yes&#44; the Lord who assisted Moses in his arduous mission of liberating the souls
                of his brethren from the degradation of slavery&#44; will yet watch&#44; is still
                watching over us with paternal care. The cup of disunion is bitter indeed&#44;
                bitter the dregs which it presents to our lips. But what was Moses&#39;s situation
                when he was unjustly assailed with the words &#58; &#34; For the whole
                congregation&#44; are all of them holy&#44; and in their midst is the Lord &#59; and
                why then will you raise yourselves above the assembly of the Lord&#63;&#34; Numbers
                xvi. 3. Fearful indeed was the assault which threatened&#44; from the preeminence of
                the malcontents&#44; to over&#8211; whelm all which had been built so recently with
                so much labour and wisdom. Ay&#44; the same thing takes place again in our day. Men
                of wisdom assail the righteous&#44; they revile them for having assumed an undue
                authority over the congregation of Israel &#59; and like Korah&#44; their object is
                not the welfare of the people&#44; but the destruction of the
                divinely&#8211;appointed leaders. But as the Lord saved his servant from that
                severest of all trials&#44; so let us hope that his spirit will again guide us to
                overcome the difficulties which now beset our way. Disunion has been threatened&#59;
                but let us go on firmly&#44; piously&#44; in the task of scattering information and
                knowledge among those who need instruction&#59; and the indifference and the love

                witnessed&#44;will yield before the power of the word of God&#59; and the triumph of
                right&#8211; eousness will again be witnessed now&#44; as on the day when the
                righteous Moses was vindicated as the faith&#8211; ful servant of God by the display
                of miracles&#44; when all the people felt&#44; that the Lord was their God&#44; and
                his word true&#44; and that his messenger was true. May the light of the Lord be our
                guide&#44; and his blessing our shield&#44; now and for ever. Amen. Tamuz 4th.

                the great and holy King&#33; we hum&#8211; bly approach thy goodness because of our

                us when we sin &#59; and his beneficence is equally extensive&#44; to grant to us
                that recompense which our humble acts may merit in his just tribunal. What
                inducements are therefore presented to us to be true and faithful &#33; To other
                nations religion is a bond of divine love which unites only the individuals in a
                sectarian confederacy &#59; for though it should purify the hearts&#44; they need
                not a national religion to unite them into a national frater&#8211; nity. But with
                the Israelites the case is very different&#59; there is among us no adhesion of
                nationality if it be not by our faith&#59; wherever we live we are bound to pay
                allegiance to civil laws to which our voice never assented&#59; we give this&#8211;
                obedience cheerfully&#59; it is our duty to obey the laws of the state where we are
                domi&#8211; ciled&#44; whether we are equals with the other inhabi&#8211; tants or
                not. Nevertheless we may boldly say&#44; that we have a higher duty than contenting
                ourselves with merely forming a minute portion of different states&#59; we have a
                law which&#44; when duly observed&#44; will mark us as members of a great
                family&#44; the portions of which are scattered abroad in every land&#44; yet One
                and the same through identity of hope&#44; and identity of descent. If we merely
                look to our temporal interests&#44; to those things which we have described as
                fleeting and un&#8211; substantial&#44; it will certainly be of no moment whether we
                remain Jews or not. But since it Avould be folly to live for unsubstantialities
                only&#44; since without the wisdom of God there can be nothing stable and sure &#58;
                it is requisite&#44; from reasonable grounds even&#44; that w r e <pb n="269"/> THE

                duct. If now we believe in the truth of God&#44; if we maintain that He is without
                falsehood and change&#58; we must likewise admit that his w T ords are
                permanent&#44; and that what Pie has ordained must stand forever. It is this which
                constitutes the Jews a nation though scattered everywhere&#59; this belief binds
                them&#44; not as individuals of a sect which can admit of certain changes in their
                fundamental ideas with the changes of the times&#44; but as a well&#8211;organized
                state&#44; the con&#8211; stitution of which is immutable&#44; and protects alike
                all who claim affinity with the state. In short&#44; to be Jews&#44; we must observe
                the Jewish religion &#58; it is a monstrosity to say &#34;I am a Jew although I have
                for&#8211; saken the law.&#34; It cannot be &#59; the observance of the law is the
                essence of Judaism &#59; and if even we do as&#8211; sert that an apostate cannot
                place himself beyond the pale of his religion&#44; since with all his sinning he is
                bound by the law &#58; still his descendants must lose all portion in Jacob&#39;s
                house&#44; whilst they do not pay alle&#8211; giance to the Law of Moses. But is it
                an unjust burden which this religion im&#8211; poses&#63; O no &#33; It is true&#44;
                it makes it incumbent upon all of us to be distinguished in our life by certain
                out&#8211; ward acts&#44; and to bear testimony to certain doctrines which are the
                basis of our belief. Still it is no unjust burden. Let us not forget&#44; that we
                are not to live for outward things merely&#44; that there is a spirit too which
                demands attention &#59; and that&#44; therefore&#44; unless our religion be
                false&#44; unfounded in fact&#44; it is simply the part of ordinary prudeuce to
                remain faithful to its behests. To the true Israelites the Bible duties are not
                burdensome &#59; they love to show that they can 23* <pb n="270"/> 270 THE ESSENCE

                they can gladly dispense with treasures which can be purchased by sin only&#44; and
                they joyfully bear testimony to the glorious truths of the laws which have never
                proceeded from human intellect&#44; which have for their Author the Lord of the
                spirits of all flesh. And nevertheless Israelites have been faithless &#33;
                Is&#8211; raelites have started back from the righteous path &#33; Israelites have
                joined themselves to the gentiles &#33; Is&#8211; raelites have worshipped strange

                stand abashed in the sight of our God&#44; because of our ini&#8211; quity. How
                merciful He has been to our backslid&#8211; ing&#44; how forgiving to our
                nation&#44; how indulgent to the individuals&#44; let our history tell&#44; let the
                experience of each one of us proclaim. Often as we have in&#8211; censed Him&#44;
                often as we have vexed his holy spirit&#44; we always met with indulgence&#44; and
                the wrath was not wholly poured out&#44; and we were not consumed. And yet&#44;
                neither this indulgence&#44; nor the terrible rod of judgment has converted our
                hearts&#44; and we are ob&#8211; durate to this day&#44; transgressors as were our
                fathers. And what did our fathers profit by their rebellion &#63; Disunion&#44;

                brave his wrath. What has He not wrought for ns &#33; how many mercies have come to

                cast off all restraint&#44; simply to be free from the burden of Judaism. What did

                regeneration&#44; the spreading in a later period of the glory of God. Our fathers

                light&#59;&#34; for the earth was blessed by the appearance of Abraham who&#44;
                feeling the great&#8211; ness of his Creator&#39;s ways&#44; proclaimed to all
                around him that the works of man&#39;s hands are not the beings that can demand his
                worship&#44; that nothing which springs from matter can be otherwise than perishable
                and decaying. It was he who first felt&#44; when others who had been taught refused
                to believe&#44; that there is indeed an Almighty Power who called forth the
                earth&#44; the sea&#44; the sky&#44; and all that fills them&#44; from the depths of
                non&#8211;existence&#44; and that it is He to whom man should turn in all hours of
                joy&#44; in all the moments of sorrow&#59; since it is by his will that we are at
                ease&#44; since it is by his dispensation that we are wounded. It was this
                teaching&#44; which we may aptly style a new creation&#44; which characterized the
                mission of Abraham&#44; it is this instruction which constitutes the foundation on
                which our structure rests&#44; to which we point as our best&#44; as our only

                of those who mocked the misfortunes of their captives. Yea&#44; all that the world
                calls greatness&#44; all that man calls glory fell on that frightful day when the
                blades of ten thousands of swords gleamed in the hands of Rome&#39;s countless
                legions&#44; when severed heads filled up thy streets&#44; fallen Jerusalem &#33;
                when thy courts&#44; O sacred Zion &#33; were choked with the scattered limbs of the
                brave defenders&#44; who perished sooner than yield the fane which was the pride of
                their nation. Yea&#44; on that day fell the power of Judah&#39;s sons&#44; on that
                day sank the crown of Zion&#39;s daughters&#44; and ended was the dominion of those
                who bore rule in Israel. But precisely that which would have marked the
                death&#8211;hour of every other nation&#44; became the point of revival of our own

                themselves strengthened by the prom&#8211; ised salvation of their God&#44; whose
                chastisement they had evoked by their manifold sins. And thus&#44; while they with
                awe&#8211;struck hearts watched in mute despair the progress of the destruction&#44;
                which henceforward marked them as wanderers and outcasts&#44; their un&#8211; veiled
                eye beheld their temple rise again from its ashes in renewed and hitherto

                throne&#44; the pillars of which are righteousness and justice&#44; establishing on
                earth a kingdom which is to stand unto eternity&#44; encircling them with the armour

                when truth descended from heaven and took up its abode among the children of man.
                The Israelites thus saw their outward symbols fall into the abyss which had
                swallowed up so many other nations &#59; but they were convinced that a new life was
                given them &#59; they felt that now they had to endure privation&#44; contumely&#44;
                scorn&#44; because they were marked with the seal of the Lord&#39;s covenant&#44;
                because in their features they carried the lineaments of a once renowned now hated
                ances&#8211; try&#44; because by their actions and their belief they bore a decided
                testimony against the deeds and opinions which other nations professed. They felt
                then that&#44; if it was impossible for them to triumph&#44; it was still granted
                them to suffer all that man could inflict on them for defending the noble truths
                which were in their safe&#8211;keeping&#59; and they resolved thus to be pa&#8211;
                tient and submissive to what they considered to have been decreed from Heaven&#44;
                and they took up the pil&#8211; grim&#39;s staff which was handed to them&#44; and
                they glo&#8211; rified in their sorrow the Hand which in mercy had struck and
                wounded them&#44; in order to recall them from their sinful ways&#44; and to
                cement&#44; by the blood which was shed freely by the saints&#44; the union which
                had been loosened in the hours of peace and pros&#8211; perity. I need not tell
                you&#44; brethren&#44; how many sufferings we had to endure for eighteen hundred
                years&#44; for no other reason than because we were Jews. History tells the
                sorrowful tale&#44; how oppression exhausted its malice to invent new inflictions
                wherewith to crush the spirit of Israel&#39;s descendants&#59; how false accusations

                order to afford some pretext for the cruelties wliich were heaped upon us&#59; how
                every honourable pursuit was closed against us&#44; and we were compelled to resort
                to mean and degrading employments&#44; in order to find the wealth&#44; which was
                the only thing which at the same time excited the cupidity of our tyrants&#44; and
                afforded us the sole opportunity of appeasing their unholy thirst for the ransom of
                the life&#39;s blood of our best and wisest members. I could detain you for

                not descant on what is known to all. All I want to do is to call your atten&#8211;
                tion to the miraculous constancy which was displayed on all occasions&#44; and in
                every country&#44; and under all circumstances&#44; by our suffering people&#44; and
                that noth&#8211; ing ever caused them to despair of better times&#44; and that
                nothing could induce the mass&#44; whatever individ&#8211; uals might do in their
                agony of despair&#44; to embrace&#44; even in appearance&#44; the opinions of the
                gentiles&#44; and to sever their connexion with the house of Israel. Let me entreat

                sword which the oppressors of Israel wielded&#44; &#8212; that it must have been a

                that in all this continent&#44; with but one or two exceptions&#44; our con&#8211;
                gregations are yet small&#44; are&#44; so to say &#44; in their in&#8211; fancy
                &#59; but for this very reason ought each sincere Israelite to contribute his share
                of influence&#44; of means&#44; and of personal service&#44; to lay the foundation
                in such a manner that&#44; in progress of time&#44; the small may be&#8211; come a
                thousand&#44; and the younger one a great and mighty nation. Only two things are

                interests of our people&#44; especially in America&#44; &#8212; union and
                forbearance. Nothing can be accomplished if each member of the community acts
                independently and in opposition to the others &#59; never did any cause prosper
                under such circumstauces&#44; nor can ours do so&#44; unless by the especial
                interposition of the divine favour. It is true&#44; so many clangers have already
                passed over our heads&#44; that we may freely assert our religion to be in no
                permanent danger from anything we can do to injure it. But such a flatter&#8211; ing
                of ourselves will hardly excuse us in our own eyes&#44; not to mention in the
                estimation of good men&#44; but especially not in the judgment of the Lord&#44; who
                sees the inward working of our sinful heart. No&#44; we must alter all this&#44; if
                we have even once acted so &#59; it is no sign of weakness to amend an error&#44; it
                is no evidence of an unsound judgment to yield if we are convinced of having been to
                blame in our former conduct. Though it is&#44; therefore&#44; true&#44; that our
                religion can ad&#8211; vance in spite of our own supineness and
                wrong&#8211;doing&#44; though I can bear a cheerful testimony that&#44; despite the
                misdoing of many individuals&#44; our cause has prog&#8211; ressed rapidly within
                the last ten years on this very continent&#44; nay&#44; if I err not&#44; in this
                very city &#58; there can be no doubt that it will progress much faster if we all
                unite for the same end&#44; with one will&#44; with one heart. Shall our
                religion&#44; beloved brethren&#44; appeal to you in vain for aid&#44; for
                countenance&#44; shall she al&#8211; ways be suffering either from the wounds

                always to be the suffering cause&#44; never the triumphant&#63; Yet&#44; triumphant
                or suffering&#44; Judaism will be dear to the souls of those who fear the Lord&#44;
                    <pb n="287"/> THE DESTINY OF ISRAEL. 287 whose eye can penetrate into the
                recesses of futurity&#44; and behold the Messiah on his throne&#44; and the
                knowl&#8211; edge of God spread over all the earth &#33; Judaism will be dear to the
                true Israelite&#44; whether it is oppressed&#44; or marches in srlory over the
                fallen ruins of systems of error in the Lord&#39;s own appointed time. Still let us
                hope that there are many&#44; many among the sons and daughters of Israel&#44; who
                are here this day&#44; who are zealous for their God and his law&#44; and who will
                resolve to unite in acts&#44; to be one in belief&#44; in order to extend among the
                household of Jacob the love of the Lord&#44; and the fear of his holy Name&#44; by
                observing themselves all that their religion asks of them&#44; and to aid all who
                come under their influence to follow in their footsteps in sincerity and simpleness
                of heart. Of all the endearing epithets with which we ad&#8211; dress the Deity none
                appeals more strongly to the heart than that of Father. He is our Father in
                hea&#8211; ven. Iso term is more full of kindness as applied by Him&#44; who is so
                pure and so holy&#44; than his calling us his children. Of our own accord we could
                never have assumed the title of God&#39;s children&#59; still&#44; in the record of
                his will&#44; written by his servant Moses&#44; God addresses us as such in the
                following words&#44; which we find in the commencement of the fourteenth chap&#8211;
                ter of Deuteronomy&#58; &#34; Ye are children to the Lord your God &#59;&#34; by
                which we are certified that we are objects of espe&#8211; cial care to our
                Creator&#44; who&#44; in order to render us proper subjects of his kingdom&#44; has

                chosen to be the bearers of his glo&#8211; rious standard of truth and faith before
                the sous of man&#58; it follows as a necessary consequence&#44; that we all ought to
                regard each other as brothers in faith&#44; in hopes&#44; in duty&#44; and are
                therefore bound by the ties of love to walk together in due affection&#44; and to
                aid each other in the attainment of the utmost per&#8211; fection of which our
                nature is capable in this state of probation and sin. Perfection&#44; absolute and
                uncon&#8211; ditional&#44; is not asked&#59; our Father knows our frame&#44; knows
                that we are dust. He requires only that we do all which lies in our power&#59; but
                we also must not expect too much of one another&#59; we must bear with each
                other&#39;s failings&#44; and endeavour to improve others by gentle means and
                brotherly admonition&#44; where we see that a wrong has been done. &#8212; Do you
                feel the full weight of this&#63; beloved hearers &#33; Are you penetrated with your
                relation to your Maker&#44; with your relation to all Israel&#63; Eemember&#44; God

                contemplate&#44; Lord &#33; the magnificence of thy works&#44; we must be penetrated
                by our own littleness&#44; and struck with the daring with which we transgress thy
                precepts. We measure ourselves against Thee&#44; and presume to be wiser than thy
                in&#8211; struction. Yet how good art Thou &#33; Thou crushest not the worm in his
                presumption&#44; but waitest for his repentance and his return to thy mercy. Thou
                sendest forth thy thunders&#44; but they purify the air we breathe&#44; and thy
                lightning&#39;s awful arrows fall un harming at our feet. Thou pourest forth the
                abundance of thy waters&#44; and they foam&#44; and they roar&#44; and they rush
                onward in majesty&#59; but we are permitted to con&#8211; template the spectacle
                untouched by the power that bids these waters roar&#44; that causes them to flow
                on&#8211; ward. O Father &#33; teach us then to feel thy great&#8211; ness&#44; show
                us how we may be humble because of thy power &#59; in order that we may walk
                faithfully before Thee all our days&#44; and be obedient in all things wherein we
                have received thy instruction&#59; that thy kingdom may be speedily spread abroad to
                banish <pb n="291"/> THE SIN OF SLANDER. 291 the reign of sin from the face of the
                earth&#44; and to establish righteousness in the place of iniquity&#59; that thy
                saints may rejoice&#44; and thy servants be glad be&#8211; cause of the abundance of
                thy salvation&#44; which will then overspread the world and cover the earth with the
                knowledge of thy will&#44; as the waters cover the deep&#44; in the days of thy
                anointed&#44; the son of David&#44; whom Thou wilt send to redeem us a second time
                from gentile bondage&#44; even as Thou hast spoken. Amen. Brethren &#33; The essence
                of all religion is&#44; as you well know&#44; comprised within very narrow
                limits&#44; which are &#58; &#34;And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
                heart&#44; and with all thy soul&#44; and with all thy might&#44;&#34; and &#34;
                Thou shalt love thy neighbour like thyself.&#34; Still&#44; narrow as these limits
                may appear to us&#44; they afford us labours which will fill up our whole
                exist&#8211; ence&#44; and happy indeed will we be if we have been faithful in both
                the requirements which our God asks of us. It is true&#44; that very often in the
                pride of a self&#8211;sufhcient egotism we say that we love God &#59; but every
                opportunity is seized to gratify our own appe&#8211; tite&#44; careless whether we
                be acting in conformity with religion or not. We would gladly persuade ourselves
                that we truly love our neighbour&#44; there is something so odious in the thought
                that we hate him&#59; and still how seldom does the love due to all withhold us from
                acting solely for ourselves&#44; regardless who suffers. Is this owing to the
                absolute depravity of the human heart&#44; that it needs must prompt wrong
                actions&#63; or is the fault one which is within our own control&#63; If <pb n="292"
                /> 292 THE SIN OF SLANDER. the former&#44; we would necessarily be
                irresponsible&#44; because we would thus be acting under compulsion&#44; being
                without any power over ourselves&#59; but if the second&#44; then ought we to be
                very careful to lay hold of all the means which will enable us to carry out the
                problem of our life. We will not now argue whether or not we have this power&#59;
                all experience teaches us&#44; and so does the Bible&#44; that we are free to
                act&#44; consequently there is no compulsion why we should offend against the love
                due to our God&#44; against the affection due to our neighbour. But we should look
                within ourselves&#44; and search why and where&#8211; fore we often offend&#63; why
                and wherefore we are not more perfect&#63; &#8212; In a word&#44; it is an
                inordinate self&#8211; love which stands between us and our duties&#44; an
                over&#8211; estimation of ourselves&#44; in comparison with others&#44; even
                including the Supreme Being who has fashioned us in his image. Whenever any thing is
                prescribed to us&#44; and we are told it is one of our duties&#44; how quickly do we
                feel rebellion springing up within us to refuse compliance&#59; simply because it
                asks some&#8211; thing of us which we have not yet resolved to grant&#44; we look
                upon ourselves as the sovereigns&#44; the recip&#8211; ients as our vassals&#44;
                hence we grudgingly grant&#44; we eagerly seize. But do not arraign Providence as in
                faulty for having thus endowed your souls&#59; it is a feel&#8211; ing in itself
                leading you to love others as vourselves&#59; for if you had no regard for your own
                comforts&#44; you certainly could not feel that others have any wants. The miser who
                shuts himself up in his naked cabin without a fire to chase away the winter&#39;s
                cold&#44; with&#8211; out a light to cheer him during the gloom of night&#44; cannot
                pity the sufferings of the poor whose hard <pb n="293"/> THE SIN OF SLANDER. 293
                fate compels them to dispense with what you call the necessaries of life&#44; though
                to them they would be luxuries&#59; he feels not their wants&#44; for he has slain
                the desire for them in himself&#59; and hence he spurns the petitioner who claims
                his pity in his destitute condition. It is not then the possession of the feeling of
                self&#8211;love which is an evil&#44; it is the illegitimate car&#8211; rying out of
                the same which is the baue of life&#59; it is because we only see ourselves among
                the mass of beings&#44; not because we see ourselves among them. We are ourselves
                those whom we should love&#44; that is conceded&#59; but we should take heed that we
                love not ourselves alone. But one thing more is needed to cor&#8211; rect the evil
                of our nature&#44; it is that we constantly bear before our eyes&#44; in characters
                of light&#44; that we are servants of God&#44; who sees all our acts and knows all
                our thoughts&#59; and this will prompt us to be obedient to Him and kind to our
                fellow&#8211;men&#44; even whilst seek&#8211; ing our own advancement&#44; even
                whilst we labour in a pursuit which in the eyes of others claims our whole
                attention. This contemplation opens a wide field to our view&#44; which would take a
                long time to elucidate as its importance demands&#59; but it is best not to embrace
                too much at once &#59; we grow wiser and better if we learn in detail. Let us
                therefore confine our reflections this day to but one single point&#44; and let us
                hope that we may be improved by this method of self&#8211;examination&#44; which is
                recommended to us from the very highest Source. One of the best methods&#44; if not
                the only one&#44; to grow wiser and better is to search the Scriptures to discover
                what God &#34;has written concerning us. In that blessed book he has not taught us
                how to build 25* <pb n="294"/> 294 THE SIN OF SLANDEK. houses&#44; how to discover
                the latest arcana of sciences&#44; but how to build up our happiness&#44; how to
                discover our own insignificance&#44; and how to appreciate his goodness and truth.
                The great prophet who was sent to teach us the law&#44; gave us in himself a
                glorious example of the self&#8211;sacrificing love which is demanded of us. He
                indeed walked before the people not merely as a leader of their armies in battle and
                of the senate in council&#44; but of the individuals in their path of life&#44; of
                the Israelites proper as servants of the Most High. In every thing Moses was the
                chief&#44; in every thing the son of Amram rises preeminent. Whatever vol&#8211;
                untary agency he may have had in writing down the words which filled his soul&#44;
                he never sought to gloss over his own defects or those of his household&#59; he
                speaks as though he felt himself mortal&#44; he writes as though he knew no
                shame&#44; no family&#8211;pride&#44; wdiile labouring in the sacred cause of
                Heaven&#44; which is at last the cause of Israel&#44; the cause of all mankind.
                &#8212; Let us then revert to the words of the Creator writ&#8211; ten down by the
                noblest of men&#59; let us heed the warnings which we find recorded&#44; and take
                care that the inspiration which we thence draw shall urge us on to become wiser and
                better. Let us then consider a remarkable verse in this day&#39;s portion &#58;

                the Bible admonish us &#58; &#34; Remem&#8211; ber&#44; what the Lord thy God did
                unto Miriam.&#34; Who was Miriam &#63; The prophet&#8211;sister of the great prophet
                who was the instrument of writing these very words we have quoted. She had been
                associated with Aaron and with Moses in the work of the regeneration of Israel &#59;
                she had stood by&#44; whilst yet herself a youthful maiden&#44; whilst her brother
                was exposed amidst the reeds of the Nile&#44; to snatch him from the grasp of
                Pharaoh&#39;s heartless executioners&#59; she too had led forth the women of Israel
                when the mighty hosts of Egypt&#39;s king had been sunk in the waters of the Red
                Sea&#44; and responded to the glorious song of thanksgiv&#8211; ing left to the
                world by her illustrious brother. The spirit too had communed with her&#59; the
                visions of things yet undone&#44; of ages yet unborn had been un&#8211; folded in
                the dim distance to her enraptured view. Such was Miriam&#44; one of the loveliest
                characters ever shadowed forth&#44; for Moses never describes minutely&#44; in
                Scripture. And yet she was punished&#44; signalty punished&#44; and disgraced before
                the whole people who <pb n="298"/> 298 THE SIN OF SLANDER. looked upon her with
                well&#8211;founded veneration. And why &#63; Because she had spoken against Moses
                for having married an Ethiopian woman&#44; and arrogated to herself an equal
                rank&#44; because to her&#44; too&#44; the Lord had spoken. We are not sufficiently
                informed of the whole early career of Moses&#44; whether the wife spoken of be
                Zipporah&#44; called perhaps Ethiopian&#44; from being a foreigner&#44; a
                non&#8211;Israelite&#44; or whether it refers to a previous marriage with an actual
                native of that dis&#8211; tant land. Enough that Miriam spoke to her elder against
                the purity of the character of her younger brother&#44; thereby arrogating to
                herself a standing above him&#44; whilst she boastfully looked upon herself as
                equally endowed with the spirit. We have no reason to suppose that Miriam spoke
                otherwise than the truth&#58; and still see the consequences. No sooner had the
                boast and reproach escaped her lips&#44; than the awful Majesty summoned her and her
                listening brother to judgment&#59; they are confounded at the rebuke&#44; and soon
                the priest had&#44; in his anguish&#44; to declare his guilty sister affected with
                the leprosy&#44; which consigned her to a solitary exclusion without the camp&#44; a
                circumstance which revealed her trans&#8211; gression to the whole people&#44; who
                then were justly taught to look upon every infliction of punishment as a mark of
                divine disapprobation. &#8212; The confession of Aaron of his own and Miriam&#39;s
                folly and sin&#44; in&#8211; duced the prophet to appeal for mercy to Him who had so
                often favoured him. But the prayer remained unheeded&#58; her Father had rejected
                her for the time being&#44; until the guilt had been atoned for&#44; by a week&#39;s
                seclusion in the dwelling of the unclean. Reflect on this. The prophetess
                Miriam&#44; the pious <pb n="299"/> THE SIN OF SLANDER. 299 matron in Israel&#44;
                the undaunted heroine in many a trying scene&#44; the honoured by all the
                people&#44; a com&#8211; panion of the lepers&#44; of the outcasts of all
                grades&#44; because she had sinned &#59; a mark of divine wrath&#44; be&#8211; cause
                she had slandered a brother. Well are we therefore reminded to &#34; remember what
                the Lord did unto Miriam on the way&#44; when we went forth from Egypt.&#34; Let us
                take heed of the warning&#44; and not give a license to our tongue to speak evil
                against the absent&#44; by which their character or standing may suf&#8211; fer in
                the estimation of others. Let us reflect thus &#58; If the one who was great among
                the greatest&#44; if the woman whose name is entwined indelibly&#44; whose memory is
                impressed unfadingly in the hearts and history of Israel&#44; incurred punishment
                for an un&#8211; due use of calumnious speech &#58; how much more must we expose
                ourselves to the dread judgment&#44; we who are steeped in sin&#44; whose hearts are
                filled with evil&#44; for casting censure on our fellow&#8211;men&#44; for depriving
                them by our heedlessness or malice of that reputation which is honestly theirs.
                There indeed may be oc&#8211; casions when it becomes necessary that the truth
                should be spoken &#59; for instance&#44; before a court of justice&#44; where we may
                assume that the Divinity is present to aid the judges in their decision&#44; if they
                will turn their ear to the appeal of justice&#59; or when the wicked should attempt
                to deceive the unwary by a specious artfulness or well&#8211;disguised deceit&#59;
                or to point the linger of scorn against those in power&#44; who&#44; by their
                example or teaching&#44; endeavour to mislead to sin those&#44; who believe them
                sincere in their pre&#8211; tended sanctity. In all such cases&#44; and some

                fearless Israelite&#44; to speak out without fear or favour&#44; &#34;because the
                judgment belongs to the Lord.&#34; But this is no authority nor reason for that
                private slander which dwells upon the foibles of others&#44; which loves to seize on
                the wrongs of our neighbours&#44; not to reform them&#44; not to promote the ends of
                justice&#44; not to warn the innocent&#44; but to elevate ourselves in our own
                imagination above the level of our fellows&#44; to place them in a position where
                the finger of public odium may point at them&#44; where their character or their
                influence may be destroyed&#44; without their knowing the base hand which has struck
                the deadly blow against their peace. &#8212; Those who have themselves suffered from
                the tongue of slander&#44; and who is there that has not &#63; those who have been

                monition to be themselves cautious how they give unbridled license to their own
                tongue. In no one thing does the moral doctrine &#34;What is unpleasant to thee do
                not unto thy neighbour&#34; apply with more force than in the fault of
                slandering&#44; without any other motive than the mere love of gossip&#44; not to
                mention if malice be the moving principle which arms our tongue against the peace of
                our neighbour. Some one may perhaps say&#44; that the fault which we reveal to the
                world would have been rendered evi&#8211; dent by another one actuated by worse
                motives than ourselves&#44; and that hence there is a species of kind&#8211; ness in
                being ourselves the first to announce the news. But this is a poor excuse for a
                great wrong. <pb n="301"/> THE SIN OF SLANDER. 301 If really we love any object&#44;
                we will be most anxious to conceal his failings from the eyes of the world&#44; if
                we cannot excuse them even in our own heart. This is as we would act by
                ourselves&#59; since we surely are not willing to make our own faults known&#44;
                though we cannot justify our conduct&#44; or help condemning our own natural
                defects. By the way&#44; what we think as likely to fall under the notice of others
                may&#44; by some lucky circumstance&#44; escape their observation altogether &#59;
                and hence&#44; if we remain silent&#44; the world at large may continue ignorant of
                our friend&#39;s wrong&#8211; doing &#59; hence instead of doing him a service by

                neighbours&#44; and whose heedlessness does not spare the stranger&#44; with how
                much trepidation does he not meet his fellow&#8211;men. Many he has designedly&#44;
                some accidentally injured&#44; and he is in constant terror that his misconduct may
                become known to his victims&#44; through the very persons whom he entertained with
                the failings of others. There can be no sincerity in friendship&#44; if one condemns
                a friend in his absence&#59; there must be secret enmity&#44; if we judge a man in
                the worst light&#44; when by a different aspect of the case we might find an excuse
                for his actions&#59; and at length there must be malice&#44; if we allow ourselves
                to con&#8211; demn without informing ourselves carefully of the bearings of an
                absent friend&#39;s conduct. &#8212; Society can&#8211; not exist in peace&#44; if
                malice rankles in the heart of its members&#59; there is no security&#44; no peace
                in a city&#44; if man looks upon man with suspicion and distrust&#59; nor can there
                be religion&#44; nor can there be a heart consecrated to God&#44; if upon light
                causes Ave sit in judgment upon one another&#44; and make the failings of our
                neighbours the subject of a pleasant conversa&#8211; tion or a theme for spending an
                agreeable evening. But&#44; brethren&#44; the curse of slander is one much too
                common among us all &#59; k empoisons the springs of life&#44; and embitters but too
                frequently all social intercourse. There may be many whose knowledge of the world
                enables them to dispense with the good opinion of persons who are indifferent to
                them&#59; but there is un&#8211; fortunately a much larger class who are sensitively
                alive to the least breath of slander&#44; who shrink in&#8211; stinctively from
                public censure. If no religion re&#8211; <pb n="305"/> THE SIN OF SLANDER. 305
                strains you then&#44; let common pity for suffering hu&#8211; manity stay your
                trifling speech&#59; reflect that which is so pleasant to you may be death and
                destruction to one whom you would designedly be the last to injure. And remember one
                thing more&#44; that those very per&#8211; sons who are so sensitive and delicate
                are the very ones who feel the kindest towards others&#44; who will the soonest
                serve their neighbours from motives of pure benevolence. And if&#44; as we are
                taught by the wise Solomon&#44; there is life and death in the power of the
                tongue&#44; let us endeavour that our tongue&#44; that great gift which more than
                anything else distin&#8211; guishes man from the brute&#44; shall only be employed
                in promoting good&#8211;will among men&#44; and uttering the praises of the Most
                High. And the God who in his mercy visited Miriam with leprosy&#44; that she might
                be an example to others&#44; will surely reward us for obey&#8211; ing his will&#44;
                and doing his behest in the duty of bro&#8211; therly love &#59; inasmuch as He
                values all his creatures alike&#44; and knows how to reward those who fear Him With
                an exceeding great blessing&#44; in a life where there is no contention&#44; no

                DISCOURSE XIX. THE COMING YEAR. God of righteousness and truth &#33; how abundant is
                thy goodness which Thou extendest over thy children&#44; how glorious the mercy with
                which Thou watchest over their actions &#33; When righteous they obtain thy
                favour&#44; though their acts be so insignificant&#44; as the deeds of man must ever
                be &#59; and if they arise in re&#8211; bellion to gainsay thy will&#44; Thou wilt
                not destroy&#44; hut waitest for their repentance&#44; and warnest them in time that
                they may return unto Thee. But even in chastisement we behold Thee as the Father of
                spirits&#59; because Thou purifiest the child of sin in the furnace of
                tribulation&#44; that he may be purged from trans&#8211; gression and be rendered
                worthy again of thy favour. O do then act towards us even according to thy
                good&#8211; ness of which our fathers have spoken&#44; and which they have ever
                received at thy hands &#59; send us bless&#8211; ing and prosperity in our
                labour&#44; that we may not toil in vain and spend our days in fruitless repining
                and hopes deferred&#44; which render the heart faint and de&#8211; sponding. But if
                success should elevate our heart to value itself unduly and to forget thy holy
                precepts&#44; then let thy rod fall on us to remind us that we are thy servants&#44;
                who are bound to obey thy every will&#44; to listen dutifully to thy every word. So
                that we may ahvays feel that we are under thy august protec&#8211; tion and amenable
                to thy justice&#44; by which knowledge our life will be rendered happy and our souls
                be made <pb n="307"/> THE COMING YEAR. 307 pure&#44; to be fitted to dwell in the
                secret of thy taber&#8211; nacle&#44; in a world without sorrow&#44; in a life
                without death&#44; where the sun never sets&#44; and where thy glory ever shines.
                Amen. Brethren &#33; A few days more only will elapse before this year will have
                closed&#44; and when another will dawn upon us with all its uncertainties of joy and
                sorrow&#44; of light aud shadow to which our life is subject. How solemn it is to
                reflect upon the past&#44; how fearful to think of what is to come &#33; Whoever is
                among us that has had enjoyments but must feel that his pleasures have not been
                unmixed&#44; that his brightest day was not un&#8211; clouded &#33; If even pleasure
                opened her gladsome re&#8211; ceptacle&#44; and poured out into his bosom exquisite
                sensations&#44; and brought him some ecstatic moments &#58; was not some pain
                lingering under the pleasant sur&#8211; face&#44; and made itself perceived in the
                most joyous hours&#63; There is always in life&#44; as in nature&#44; an
                undercurrent which is not perhaps perceptible to the naked eye &#59; to the
                inattentive observer the surface of the stream may appear as smooth as the tranquil
                mirror&#44; with not a ripple to disturb the glassy plain&#59; but launch your bark
                on the silvery tide&#44; and how resistlessly are you forced backward&#44; and each
                step in advance has to be achieved at the expense of all the exertion you are
                capable of. Or even if you glide smoothly down with the current&#44; if pleasant
                gales fill your sails and waft you swiftly to the desired haven &#58; &#40;3 how
                often then are sunken rocks hidden in your course&#59; your vessel strikes upon the
                unknown dan&#8211; ger&#44; your sails shake out&#44; as it were&#44; the breeze

                riven one by one from the sides of the bark that was to bear you on in safety&#44;
                and you float alone&#44; forsaken&#44; unaided upon the stormy flood which now foams
                and boils up around you on all sides. This is life &#33; this its course &#33; The
                observation&#44; perhaps&#44; is trite&#44; like a thricetold tale&#59; you have
                heard this before &#59; you have seen it in books written by men of all ages&#59;
                true&#44; too true&#59; bat this is because all men have experienced the same
                fate&#44; have had to feel the same sensations of sorrow and disappointment&#59; and
                hence many have expressed what experience has forced upon their consideration. But
                should we not be told it again by those whom we know ourselves &#63; are we not to
                be reminded of the truth&#44; as it is the truth&#44; because others have heard the
                same lesson already &#63; If so&#44; the work of the moralist would soon be over
                &#59; one man indites a truth&#44; and it would be useless to carry it farther&#44;
                be&#8211; cause the truth had once been spoken. But alas&#33; so perverse is the
                human heart&#44; so often is it lulled by false security&#44; that the lessons which
                others have heard do not reach it&#44; unless it has been itself made to test them
                by experience&#59; and the accumulated wisdom of ages is passed unheeded&#44; as
                books the language of which is not understood&#44; and the char&#8211; acters of
                which are no longer in use among the living. What good is it then to the
                individual&#44; that moral reflections upon the uncertainty of earthly things have
                been indulged in before&#63; He too must think upon them&#44; not once&#44; not
                twice&#44; but every day of his life &#59; for every day he lives he is exposed to
                the vicissitudes which rob him of pleasure&#44; of friends&#44; of wealth&#44; and
                of life &#59; and in the very things&#44; on which he <pb n="309"/> THE COMING YEAR.
                309 had placed his firmest reliance of success&#44; he finds his greatest source of
                disappointment&#59; and to be induced to reflect in this manner&#44; and to profit
                thereby in his moral and religious conduct&#44; he ought to be often re&#8211;
                minded of the mutability of his fortune and the mortal termination of his earthly
                existence. &#8212; And does not nature herself preach this lesson in all her
                operations&#44; manifold as they are&#63; Look abroad in the early spring&#44; when
                the chill of winter is just passing away. Every shrub&#44; every tree&#44; every
                herb&#44; every flower seems to feel the impulse which the renewed heat im&#8211;
                parts to its being&#44; and playfully it opens its leaflets to the warm fanning of
                the vernal breezes. Anon a rich profusion of white ancl pinkish blossoms covers
                every bough along the whole landscape&#44; and with each hour new joys&#44; and new
                life&#44; and new beauties spring into being. But speedily the blossoms
                disappear&#44; and the young fruit seems to cleave for protection closely
                knit&#8211; ted to its parent stem&#44; as if fearing to venture alone upon the path
                of existence pointed out by the hand of the Creator. Soon&#44; however&#44; it
                ventures out more boldly&#44; assumes new colours&#44; varying from those of the
                leaves among which it has hitherto been nestling&#44; and tempts you by the richness
                of its hue to desire it for yourselves. Thus is summer clad in all the vari&#8211;
                ety of ripening fruit&#44; as before the spring was the time of flowers and
                blossoms. And now the autumn steals peacefully along&#59; the heats of the preceding
                season have passed away&#44; the sun has put on a more lovely radiance&#44; which
                now does not dazzle the eye as when he ruled in all his vigour of renewed
                strength&#59; the damp of the morning reminds you of the approach&#8211; ing bleak
                winter&#44; and on every branch and bough the <pb n="310"/> 310 THE COMING YEAR.
                late fruit is prepared for your sustenance&#44; ready to be gathered for your winter
                store. Already the fields are bared of their harvest&#44; and the work of nature
                seems now finished&#59; the green leaves change their hue&#44; and the dying
                colours&#44; in far more beautiful tints&#44; supply the place of the former
                uniformity&#59; and before all is finished a greater degree of glory seems to be
                cast over every object. But this too passes away&#44; and stripped is the forest of
                its loveliness&#44; des&#8211; olate are the fields&#44; and the gardens present but
                the naked stalks of that which once was beautiful&#44; and the cold and fierce blast
                of the snow&#8211;storm howls among the naked oaks and the dark gloomy pines &#59;
                and the rivers that formerly sparkled gaily in the sun&#8211; light&#44; and
                reflected like a mirror the beauty that lined their banks&#44; now lie frozen&#44;
                stiff&#44; and cold&#44; and oppose no barrier to the daring foot that ventures on
                their surface. Is not this life &#63; a true picture of what we ourselves have
                been&#44; are&#44; and will be again &#63; We too escape from the bosom of night
                into being&#59; our strength and intellect bud&#44; open&#44; and blossom &#59; we
                too are decked out with the beauty of infantile years&#44; with the grace and vigour
                of maturity&#59; and then come on the weakness and uncertainty of declining years
                &#59; the hair turns gray&#44; the eye becomes dim&#44; the step falters&#44; and
                youthful associations are but a thing of memory &#59; and lastly the body sinks into
                the cold&#44; dark grave&#44; and the clod of the valley rattles hollow npon the lid
                of the coffin&#44; and we are left to rest till that glorious morning&#44; when the
                graves will be opened to immortality&#44; and the earth will cast forth her dead.
                For to us&#44; too&#44; like to the ice&#8211;covered lake or the snow&#8211; clad

                daring&#44; nor can the dangers which we may have to encounter be lessened by our
                denying their exist&#8211; ence. But since we must face them&#44; since we must
                venture on our journey despite of all the difficulties&#58; ought&#44; we not to
                look around to discover something which could cheer us on our lonely way&#44; which
                could dispel the gloom of solitude&#44; which could render us capable to endure the
                clangers and hardships which we cannot avoid &#63; We know that our Creator is
                mer&#8211; ciful&#44; or else He would not have arrayed nature in such a garment of
                beauty as He has done &#59; He must be good&#44; for every thing has enjoyments&#44;
                which it ob&#8211; tains from his undeserved bounty. Should there then be no aid
                provided for man &#63; nothing to cheer him up&#44; and to carry him forward on his
                perilous way with safety &#63; &#8212; Ay&#44; there is &#33; and it is even the
                narrow path&#44; as it seems to us in our life&#39;s journey&#44; which our bodily
                eyes discover at a great distance as dark and uninviting. In a word&#44; it is the
                religion of Israel&#44; which has been bestowed on us as the gift of God&#44; in
                which we recognize his mercy and his goodness&#44; and which eases for us the
                perilous journey on which from our very birth we are destined to venture. Were it
                that we had absolutely speaking no guide&#44; no directing star to point out the way
                we should go&#58; what would life be worth to us &#63; better far we had never been
                born&#44; better we had never seen the light of the sun than &#34; to be in such

                we would be&#44; if we were so miserable&#44; so lost&#44; so alone. Bat now name me
                one situation in life where we are not guided&#44; and that truly&#44; by the grace
                of the Lord&#63; In childhood we have the command to obey our father and mother&#59;
                here is a plain direction for us&#44; we cannot go astray&#44; whilst they too obey
                the same precepts which have been given for our com&#8211; mon instruction. And when
                death has struck down these true friends by our side&#44; and we are absolutely
                alone&#44; and left to our own guidance&#44; then have we the written Word which is
                to point out the path which we are to walk in. Nothing is left unnoticed&#44;
                nothing is asked which we cannot accomplish. The duties may appear onerous&#44; the
                sacrifices unpalatable to our obduracy&#59; but are they impossible&#63; are they
                imprac&#8211; ticable&#63; And to these questions we are compelled to answer with an
                emphatic negative&#59; for ordinarily there is not a single reason why we cannot be
                obedi&#8211; ent&#59; and but rarely indeed&#44; perhaps not once in a life&#8211;
                time&#44; is there a case where absolute necessity compels us to forego what we are
                taught to be our duty. Yet even farther does the efficiency of religion ex&#8211;
                tend itself. It not only teaches us duty&#44; but it in&#8211; spires us with
                hope&#44; with confidence&#44; with certainty on the dark path which we are
                pursuing. It is ever ready to inspire us with courage&#44; with perseverance&#44;
                with hope &#59; for it teaches us that all which is&#44; is from God&#44; all that
                happens&#44; happens by his dispensation&#44; and that&#44; as every thing belongs
                to Him&#44; and is the object of his care and benevolence&#44; every thing must
                likewise tend to a beneficial purpose&#44; to an ultimately good result. But&#44; as
                our wisdom is not sufficient to discover the connexion of events&#44; as we are
                surrounded <pb n="315"/> THE COMING YEAR. 315 with the doubts and uncertainties
                which attach them&#8211; selves to our being&#44; we are certified that we must not
                measure the wisdom of our Maker by our puny stand&#8211; ard of intellect&#44; nor
                dare to decide upon events by the hasty judgment which we may arrive at under the
                pressure of difficulties which beset our way. No&#44; the Creator&#39;s wisdom is
                far outreaching what we have re&#8211; ceived&#44; great as this blessing is&#59;
                his view penetrates at once into all the chambers and recesses of exist&#8211;
                ence&#44; whilst to us chamber only after chamber is opened&#44; whilst only one
                recess as it rises up On the surface of existence is revealed to our eyes at one
                time. To us therefore a thing may at the moment appear wrong and unjust&#44; because
                we only see it from one point of view&#59; still let us but wait&#44; and what
                ap&#8211; peared harsh and unworthy of the Goodness which rules our destiny&#44;
                becomes an evidence of consum&#8211; mate wisdom and overshadowing mercy&#44; and
                the links of events when combined present a chain of unsur&#8211; passed
                excellence&#44; though each individual in its dis&#8211; jointed state appeared to
                our imperfect vision fraught with evil and deformity. It is thus that&#44; if we
                will only allow our good genius&#44; our inclination for virtue&#44; to prevail over
                our evil destiny&#44; which is at last noth&#8211; ing but our impulse for evil&#44;
                to draw us upon the nar&#8211; row and uninviting path of religious trust&#44; of
                religious hope&#44; of religious duty&#58; life will lose many of its bit&#8211; ter
                moments&#44; and we will be filled with submission to the divine will&#44; and feel
                joy in our lot&#44; when otherwise we would have sunk into despondency&#44; and been
                a prey to gloomy melancholy. And how dreadful is that sensation of loneliness which
                the man without hope experiences in his pilgrimage &#33; All light is shut <pb

                existence stretches out in unlimited extent before him. There is to him nothing but
                a rocky desert in prospect&#44; not a green spot for his agonized vision to rest
                upon. It matters not in this respect with what burden the hopeless one is laden&#44;
                whether it be the load of em&#8211; pire&#44; the uncounted wealth of Koran&#44; or
                the toilsome sufferings of the day&#8211;labourer &#8212; it is all the same &#58;
                if there be no light within the heart&#44; life is a trackless&#44; gloomy
                desert&#44; full of dangers and apprehensions which destroy every sensation of
                pleasure&#44; even whilst we are filled to overflowing with what the world calls
                happiness. If&#44; however&#44; we have schooled ourselves to know the Lord as lie
                is represented to us in his own word&#44; what do we then experience in all our
                ac&#8211; tions and trials &#63; but that there is a benevolent Father watching over
                us&#44; that nothing which we do or suffer will escape his cognizance&#44; and
                that&#44; as soon as He may deem it enough&#44; the trials will be ended to give
                place to joy and enlargement&#44; springing from sources over which the malevolence
                of enemies cannot have any control. Such a hope will sweeten solitude&#59; for our
                God is near to share the lonely cell&#44; or watch the solitary couch&#44; though
                this be the couch of sickness&#59; we feel his presence when we labour in the
                field&#44; or when we toil in the hours of night by the dim candle which flickers
                fitfully in its socket&#59; we will stand be&#8211; fore Him when joy numbers us in
                her gladsome train&#44; or when the tumultuous shouts of our fellow&#8211;men hail
                us as the exalted of the earth&#59; and whatever is thus bestowed&#44; be it worldly
                good or evil&#44; will be received as the apportioned lot which has been assigned to
                us from the Father of wisdom and mercy. For&#44; behold&#44; <pb n="317"/> THE
                COMING YEAR. 317 there is a measure in the hand of the Lord&#44; and He grasps the
                even scales of justice &#59; and whatever is best for each man&#44; even that is
                meted out to him&#59; and whoever has well fulfilled his task&#44; will he accepted
                on High&#44; he his worldly state the humblest or the highest&#44; it matters
                not&#44; provided only that mercy and righteousness have guided his steps&#44; while
                he per&#8211; formed the pilgrimage of life. So also will retribu&#8211; tion seize
                upon all who have neglected their duty&#44; who wilfully shut out the light
                that&#44; would have shone for them on their path if they had but heeded it&#59; and
                when they come for their recompense&#44; vainly trust&#8211; ing in the carnal acts
                of greatness which they have achieved&#44; they will be adjudged to that degradation
                which their unwilling souls have earned for their dis&#8211; obedience. Let it be
                then understood that neither in the past nor in the future can we look with calmness
                and peace&#44; if we have nothing but earthly greatness and human wisdom for our
                share. As we have said&#44; the past is always reverted to with mingled feelings of
                sorrow and pleasure &#59; since there is nothing like un&#8211; alloyed enjoyment
                ever experienced on earth. And the future can only open for us a constant succession
                of sorrows and disappointments&#44; if we have nothing but things of the earth to
                lean upon for support. &#8212; Yet some one may still say&#44; that he knows that to
                the less wise than himself there may be danger of sor&#8211; row&#44; if he deviate
                from the law&#44; which we have pointed out as the solace of our soul in this
                earthly life &#59; but that to him&#44; being more greatly endowed&#44; there will
                be no danger if he even follow his own in&#8211; clination. To such a one&#44;

                let us recall the words of Moses&#44; who says of a similar case &#58; 44 When he
                heareth the words of this curse&#44; he will bless himself in his heart&#44;
                saying&#44; I shall have peace&#44; though I walk in the stub&#8211; bornness of my

                them.&#34; Deut. xxix. 18. To which the prophet then adds&#44; &#34;The Lord will
                not forgive him &#59; but then the anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke
                against this man&#44; and all the curses that are written in this hook will rest
                upon him&#44; and the Lord will blot out his name from under heaven &#33;&#34; This
                is the warning which we have re&#8211; ceived&#59; and when has it tailed&#63;
                Whoever of our people&#44; that has braved the wrath&#44; has been consumed in the
                great fire of purgation&#44; which has ever and anon passed over the earth &#59; and
                there is a certainty that the same result will always be&#44; whilst the same Power
                bears rule over the earth and its inhabitants. Whoever is of Israel&#44; is bound by
                the law of Israel&#44; and whoever is instructed&#44; owes allegiance to the same
                code which we all have been taught to obey. What matters it to our God that we are

                every one else human life is sacred &#63; Can we form any reason why the learned in
                all the sciences may deny his God&#44; and join himself to the warship of the
                stranger&#44; simply to gain fame and wealth among the enemies of Israel&#44; when
                such a course would stamp the com&#8211; mon man as one derelict in his duty&#44;
                and an outcast from the household of the blessed seed of Abraham &#63; And whatever
                other motives of self&#8211;congratulation you may discover&#44; they are equally
                futile as an excuse for sin with those we have just enumerated &#59; and thus&#44;
                no matter what a man may think of himself&#44; he may be sure of one thing&#44; that
                there are no valid reasons in existence&#44; which will screen him from the
                righteous indignation of his justly offended Father. The pun&#8211; ishment may be
                delayed &#59; but we are not to suppose that a case is forgotten&#44; because we do
                not at once see the recompense following the sin &#59; it is not every flash of
                lightning which scatters destruction&#44; nor is every act necessarily to be
                punished in a summary manner. It is the mercy of God which waits for amendments&#59;

                life will meet with their ultimate perfection&#44; be this for good or for evil. Let
                it also be remembered that the ways of the Lord are perfect&#59; and therefore&#44;
                there is not&#44; there cannot be&#44; any immunity for sin &#59; and whatever
                ex&#8211; cuses we may frame&#44; let us be convinced that they will be sifted and
                carefully weighed in the tribunal&#44; where no human error can creep in to mar the
                deci&#8211; sions&#8211; of unerring Justice. Let us then lay hold of religion&#59;
                let us enter upon the narrow path of faith&#44; which will grow broader and fairer
                as we advance on it &#59; for then only can we look back upon the past without
                regret&#59; then only can we contemplate the future without apprehension. Hope is

                in past adversity&#44; and it illuminates the dark future as a light to his feet.
                But this consoling treas&#8211; ure must not be looked for in a worldly
                philosophy&#44; which represents every thing as governed by un&#8211; avoidable
                necessity&#44; but in the records of revelation&#44; where we behold God as the
                Supervisor and Governor of the deeds of man. It is there we behold Him as absolute
                Goodness&#44; as the Father of all &#59; and if we then feel that we are with our
                Father&#44; how joyously will we go forward&#44; how gladly will we labour&#44;
                con&#8211; scious as we are&#44; that we are guarded and loved&#44; as no mother
                guards and loves the nursling that sleeps tranquilly on her bosom. These are a few
                reflections which naturally spring up at the close of the year&#59; for the man who

                career. And we say it without fear of exaggeration&#44; that he we ever so bold and
                reckless&#44; we must occasionally come to the thought that we are mortal&#44; and
                fast hastening to our native earth&#44; whence we have been taken. We know also that
                our soul is immortal&#44; and that we have con&#8211; cerns more precious than any
                blessings which we can possess on this earth. Is it not then natural&#44; that we
                should cast our thoughts to that which is so impor&#8211; tant&#44; and inquire what
                we ought to do to be saved &#63; It is &#59; and as there is salvation provided for
                all men&#44; as God has revealed himself alike to all Israel in the law which we
                have received &#58; let us search in the &#34;Word&#44; and let us endeavour to be
                faithful to our duty&#44; unwavering in our hope&#44; that we may be re&#8211;
                ceived in favour as servants who have done the will of their Master&#44; as children
                who have trusted on to the last. And well will it be for us&#44; if we improve
                properly the commencement of the year which is so soon to be with us&#44; with its
                blessings and its trials&#59; happy will we be if we have purged ourselves of

                lot&#44; if on the clay of trial the Lord will not impute iniquity to us&#44; and
                find no deceit in our spirit&#44; &#8212; And may then the Lord have mercy on us

                world. Yet have we often sinned in thy presence&#44; and done the evil in thy
                sight&#44; rebelling against thy will&#44; unmindful of thy holy commands. And now
                we come before thy presence&#44; asking of Thee forgiveness&#44; pardon&#44; and
                atonement&#59; we crave the suspension of thy wrath and of thy indignation which we
                have in&#8211; curred by our sinful deeds. Yet what excuse can we offer to thy
                omniscience &#63; Can we allege aught that will avail as a justification in thy
                tribunal&#63; Alas&#33; we have known thy ways&#44; and have wilfully departed from
                them&#59; we have been taught thy precepts&#44; but our souls have refused to be
                obedient to their behest. And the record of our transgressions testifies against
                us&#44; and our inicmity is before our eyes no less than it is known to Thee&#44; to
                whom all the deeds of man are laid open. Yet&#44; Father and King &#33; do not cast
                us off because of our sins&#44; do not forsake thy rebellious children&#44; but
                forgive according to thy great mercy&#44; as Thou hast borne with our people from
                Egypt even until now. And let the world be taught that thy faith is yet entire with
                the sons of thy servants&#59; and let these be made conscious&#44; how great is thy
                good&#8211; <pb n="323"/> ON ATONEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE. 323 ness with which Thou
                watchest over them. Let us also feel the working of thy spirit&#44; that many may be
                cleansed from iniquity and become repentant seekers of thy goodness&#44; that
                through them those who are now obdurate may be led to fall down and worship&#44; and
                to abominate the evil of their ways which is now the idol of their hearts. And
                through this shall we know that thy presence dwells indeed among us&#44; when we see
                righteousness spread&#44; and mercy prevail all around us&#59; when many come to
                pray to whom thy worship is now a stranger&#59; when those fear Thee who now follow
                the path of sin. And let thus the coming Day of Atonement be to us a season of thy
                renewed love&#44; and be an earnest to us that our spirits have been purified in thy
                judgment&#44; and that we all have been numbered among those to whom Thou imputest
                no iniquity&#44; whose transgressions Thou hast forgiven. Amen &#33; Brethren &#33;
                Much had Israel sinned&#44; when the decree of de&#8211; struction and banishment
                went forth against them&#44; and the land&#44; which was fertile and smiling in
                beauty&#44; was to be stripped of its fertility and rendered deso&#8211; late to the
                eyes of all beholders because of the sins of its inhabitants. The men were doomed to
                wander forth&#44; and the women w T ere decreed to wear the chains of slavery
                instead of the ornaments of gold and jewels which were wont to decorate their
                beautiful limbs&#59; all because the law of the Lord had been neglected&#44; and
                because the warnings of the pious seers&#44; who had been sent to admonish their
                brothers&#44; had not been listened to&#44; in the manner becoming messages from <pb

                amidst all the dreadful de&#8211; nunciations which in those evil days of
                transgression fell from prophetic lips&#44; there are interspersed words of
                consolation which&#44; even at this distant day&#44; fall upon the believing ear
                like the dewdrops upon the thirsting flower in the calm stillness of the summer
                night. You know of Jeremiah&#44; brethren&#59; he was the man who more than all
                others was the messenger of woe and destruction&#59; still even he has consolation
                in his messages&#44; and speaks of happy changes which are impending&#44; whenever
                the men of Judah return from their transgression. He knew the dread decree&#44; at
                that day irrevocable&#44; that Jerusalem must fall&#44; &#8212; fall under the
                irresistible blows of the conquering nations that went to battle under the great
                Nebuchad&#8211; nezzar&#39;s lead&#59; fall&#44; because the measure of her
                in&#8211; iquity was nearly full to overflowing&#59; but he too saw glorious gleams
                of light breaking forth athwart the gloom of the impending night&#44; and he beheld
                Jeru&#8211; salem redeemed&#44; Zion restored&#44; although under his very eye the
                men of Chaldea were battering down the lofty walls&#44; and overthrowing fort and
                tower&#44; and entering the sanctuary with fire and sword&#44; slaying the men
                without remorse&#44; and the women without pity&#59; dashing&#44; in their fury&#44;
                the suckling against the rock&#44; and making the tearful mother the sport for their
                insatiable swords. And still Jeremiah beheld&#44; through all this sorrow&#44; a
                glorious future&#44; a future cloudless as the summer sky in his own lovely
                Pales&#8211; tine&#44; glorious as the brilliant moon when she rises in splendour
                above the quiet sleeping landscape&#44; in the midst of the glittering array of the
                stars of heaven. Ay&#44; it was the returning light of the countenance of <pb
                    n="325"/> ON ATONEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE. 325 the Lord which dawned upon his
                far&#8211;reaching vision &#59; but it was a light to be purchased by the people
                them&#8211; selves&#59; for they&#44; who had forfeited the favour of the Most
                High&#44; were themselves to repurchase it by a change of conduct&#44; by a return
                to obedience. It was this double change&#44; the wickedness of Israel into
                righteousness&#44; and of the divine wrath into mercy and everlasting favour&#44;
                which stood prominent be&#8211; fore Jeremiah&#39;s mental eye&#44; and thus he
                spoke&#58; &#34; O return&#44; ye backsliding children&#44; I will heal your
                backslidings &#33; Behold we come unto Thee&#44; for Thou art our God.&#34; Jere.
                iii. 22. The verse just quoted is composed of two parts&#44; namely&#44; the address
                of the Holy Spirit admonishing the people to repent&#44; and their reply to the
                mission of mercy. &#34; return&#44; ye backsliding children&#44; I will heal your
                backslidings&#59;&#34; this means&#44; &#34;however often and grievously you may
                have offended&#44; however laden with guilt may be your spirit&#44; however far you
                may have strayed from the righteous way &#58; come neverthe&#8211; less freely to
                the fold of your Father&#59; I am ready to re&#8211; ceive you &#59; and if your
                transgressions have been mani&#8211; fold&#44; I am able to forgive them all&#44; to
                wipe out all your iniquity from the book of memorial.&#34; In this blessed message
                we have the entire scheme of repentance un&#8211; folded clearly and unequivocally
                to our admiration&#44; and we behold God the same merciful Being to sin&#8211;
                ners&#44; which He is to those who have never sinned. Were it that no remedy existed
                for transgressors&#44; that vol. v. 28 <pb n="326"/> 326 ON ATONEMENT AND
                ACCEPTANCE. every sin demanded the absolute condemnation of the offender &#58; how
                lost would be the whole human family&#44; how utterly hopeless all longing for
                salvation&#44; which fills the heart of man &#33; &#34; There is no man on earth so
                righteous who doth act well&#44; that he sinneth not&#59;&#34; w T here then would
                be those in whom the Lord detects no guilt &#63; where those which could escape from
                the torments which are the portion of those who have forgot their God &#63; There
                would be but one step to despair and utter recklessness on the one side&#59; &#34;We
                are lost beyond redemption for the smallest evil we have committed&#34; would be the
                desperate reflection of those who have fallen &#59; &#34; it is useless for us to
                look back with regret upon what is past&#59; let us then pluck the roses whilst they
                bloom&#44; let us dash heedlessly into the whirlpool of dissipation to drown sorrow
                in the brimming wine&#8211;cup&#44; for fear lest the evil hour should reach us
                before we have tasted our fill&#59;&#34; and on the other&#44; gloomy despondency
                would follow upon the smallest deviation from right&#44; and the sinner would&#44;
                in anticipation of the fatal doom that is im&#8211; pending&#44; pass his days in
                dread of the certain and coming evil. Would this be mercy&#63; could for this end
                life and reason have been given &#63; And still there can be no line drawn which
                would separate the con&#8211; sequence of one transgression from that of another.
                All sinning is a departure from the will of God &#59; every wilful transgression is
                a rejection of the divine guid&#8211; ance which we have received &#59;
                consequently&#44; if there were no remedy for sin&#44; every deviation would amount
                to a forfeiture of mercy&#44; would consign us to destruc&#8211; tion&#44; without
                the possibility of a recovery. They&#44; who know how good the Lord is&#44; will at

                incompatibility of such views with the mercy discoverable in all creation&#44; with

                breathes forth judg&#8211; ments and retributions &#59; it tells us of a Judge and
                an Avenger&#59; but it also speaks of mercy and indulgence&#44; of a Father and
                Saviour. There is judgment for all acts of man&#44; there is retribution for every
                deed &#59; there is a Judsre who sees all that is done &#59; there is an Avenger who
                metes out the merited doom to those who refuse mercy &#59; but there is mercy even
                to the sinner&#44; there is indulgence granted that retribution follow not
                immediately on transgression &#59; there is our Father who waiteth patiently to see
                whether his chil&#8211; dren will not listen to his call and come again to his
                embrace&#44; and there is a Saviour&#44; even our God and Creator who&#44; though
                both Judge and Avenger&#44; will readily forgive all&#44; even the long
                obdurate&#44; if they will only claim his mercy&#44; which is extended to all&#44;
                from the beginning of all things even unto this day. Let us be fully impressed with
                this consoling idea&#44; when we discover that our way has been the road of
                perdition&#44; &#8212; that the same Being who punishes&#44; re&#8211; wards us
                also&#44; that the same God forgives who is wrathful to sinners&#44; and that we
                have received the means and choice to obtain either reward or punish&#8211; ment
                &#59; that we are free to act&#44; and when regretting what has passed&#44; free to
                come back to the place from which we started&#44; and that there is no
                insurmountable obstacle opposed to us from any external source&#44; why we could not

                any assumption of guilt on the other. I am not to suffer for the wrong of any other

                case if needs some one would be compelled to be punished for any sin&#44; before it

                would fail of effecting the least&#44; and as an example to others it could to a
                certainty not operate &#59; since the only idea which can reconcile us to see
                punishment inflicted is&#44; that we honestly believe that the sufferer has
                de&#8211; served his fate. So then&#44; it is the Bible doctrine&#44; that the soul
                that sinneth alone shall die&#59; but not abso&#8211; lutely without retrieve&#44;
                without remedy &#59; for the Lord is not inexorable&#44; He is ready to pardon if we
                but come forward to claim his mercy&#59; for He will forgive us when we seek Him
                with all our heart&#44; and with all our soul &#8212; that is&#44; if we abhor our
                conduct&#44; and en&#8211; deavour to regain his favour by a newly&#8211;awakened
                de&#8211; votion to his worship&#44; by a faithful conformity to his holy will. In
                other words&#44; the state of sin is one of death &#59; the way of repentance is the
                return to life&#44; life in the presence of the Lord&#44; whose are the souls of the
                living and the dead. There is a remarkable degree of expressiveness in the idea&#44;

                blessings&#44; that indulgence&#44; have failed to rivet the bond which in youth
                bound us to our Father &#63; that we left the road which as chil&#8211; dren we were

                favour&#44; by faith and obedience&#59; and that through these means he will be
                accepted&#44; though his deeds have been formerly in opposition to his duty. For we
                have received the amplest assurance&#44; that we will be forgiven&#44; if we alter
                our wicked course&#44; and return to the path from which we swerved &#59; for our
                Father is there&#44; even at the diverging roads of life&#44; to take back to his
                fold whoever repents and returns from transgression in Jacob&#44; as He has promised
                us through his servants the prophets. Having thus analyzed the first part of our
                text&#44; we must elucidate rapidly the other portion&#44; which is &#58; &#34;
                Behold we come unto Thee&#44; for Thou art our God.&#34; Whoever has studied the
                history of our people must have observed that much as we have sinned&#44; often as
                we have been given to idolatry&#44; many as have been our apostacies&#44; even to
                this day&#44; it cannot be said that we have ever renounced entirely the wor&#8211;
                ship of the Most High. Through all the awful scenes which were witnessed in
                Palestine during the first and second temples&#44; amidst the horrors of
                Nebuchadnez&#8211; zar&#39;s sieges and Titus&#39;s slaughters&#59; during all the
                butcheries of Hadrian and the massacres of the Cru&#8211; saders&#59; when thousands
                upon thousands perished with famine and exhaustion in their banishment from Spain
                and our expulsion from other lands of civilized bar&#8211; barians&#44; the name of
                the Lord One was the venerated object for whose salvation we yearned in our inmost
                heart. Had our deeds only equalled our faith&#44; had the belief which we ever felt
                only influenced us to remain obedient to the every will of God &#58; what a <pb

                formed&#44; how beautifully would we have stood before the world in spiritual no
                less than temporal excellence as the king&#8211; dom of priests for which we were
                destined &#33; But&#44; we must confess to our shame&#44; that we refused to
                listen&#44; and the evil&#44; which we yet endure&#44; came upon us in all its
                overwhelming horrors and fury&#44; and the land of Israel was rendered desolate&#44;
                and was bereft of its rightful inhabitants. Had we been obedient&#44; our Messiah
                would long since have come to sit upon the throne of David forever&#44; and to his
                kingdom there would have been no end &#59; the world would have been redeemed&#44;
                and we would have been happy as the acknowledged favourites of God&#44; the branch
                of his planting&#44; the work of his hands through which He is glorified.
                Nevertheless have we not fallen off altogether&#59; we are smitten&#44; affected
                with the curse of disobedience&#44; marred in our countenance more than other
                men&#59; there is neither comeliness nor glory in us that gentiles should desire our
                society&#59; but with all this we are not placed beyond the reach of redemption&#44;
                we are children of Israel&#44; recogniz&#8211; able by our descent&#44; by our
                conduct&#44; by our belief&#44; by the sign of the covenant which we bear in our
                flesh. Let our sons and daughters leave us&#44; and who sees not the child of Israel
                marked in their face &#63; Let them swear fealty to another creed&#44; and does not
                their inward conviction belie the falsehood which they utter with their tongues&#63;

                galling do not the very ornaments which deck them rest on their bosom &#63; Yes&#44;
                we are children of One God&#59; and let us differ in many points of observ&#8211;

                points of creed&#59; let us be reformers or adherents of ancient usages &#59; let us

                Adonay Echad is the universal watchword of the whole household of Jacob &#59; in
                this all join&#44; from this none are excluded. And go where you will&#44; watch the
                Jew dying on the frozen snow in a rencontre with Russia&#39;s armies&#44; or led
                forth to perish by fire for the sake of his faith in ancient Spain&#59; or follow
                him in the crowd who worship in the house of God at the close of a Day of
                Atonement&#44; or even in the social circle where friend meets with friend&#58;
                every where it is the same sublime thought which animates all &#59; it is the unity
                of God&#44; the saving power of the Father of all. Long indeed has our holy religion
                struggled with the obduracy of our hearts&#59; long has she striven in vain for an
                absolute victory &#59; but conquered she lias never been. She has had to hide her
                face because of the assault of adverse circumstances which op&#8211; posed her
                progress&#59; but she has marched onward&#44; slow indeed&#44; though not less sure
                of victory. The house of Israel has not yet returned with a firm heart to the
                Lord&#44; or else it would not have fallen to the lot of the humble individual who
                addresses you now&#44; to call you to repentance. But to doubt of the ulti&#8211;
                mate result&#44; of the happy issue of this contest of truth against error&#44;
                would be to despair of the justice and truth of God. Many may fall off&#44; and
                leave the fold where Israel is received&#59; but there will always be enough&#44;
                though they be few&#44; to bear aloft the banner which is to wave as the signal for
                a regenerated world. &#8212; The world will be regenerated&#44; and with the rest

                be lost&#44; the star of Jacob will not set for ever&#44; to be blotted out from
                under the heaven. But without repentance neither can our nation nor individuals be
                accepted&#59; it is&#44; therefore&#44; but reasonable to conclude that at a time
                sooner or later&#44; but a time sure to arrive&#44; the houses of Israel and of
                Judah will unite to call as one man on the Lord their God&#44; and that then his
                wrath will be turned aside&#44; and He will have mercy on his land and his people.
                It will be at that day that the call of the Spirit&#44; &#34;Return&#44; ye
                backsliding children&#44;&#34; will be answered by the repentant voice of the
                newly&#8211;re&#8211; deemed nation&#44; &#34; Behold we come unto Thee&#44; for
                Thou art our God.&#34; Long since we have heard the call which thy mercy addressed
                to us&#44; long we have refused to hear&#44; long we have loved our idols better
                than Thee&#44; long we have preferred following the in&#8211; clination of our
                hearts to obeying thy law. But now we feel the unworthiness of our conduct&#44; we
                are ashamed of our backsliding&#44; and we are here&#44; come back to thy
                embrace&#44; for Thou art as ever our God. And let history be witness&#44; let thy
                own wisdom tes&#8211; tify&#44; whether we have ever been totally lost to thy
                worship &#59; and we are again in thy presence to follow thy guidance as on the day
                when we went out from Egypt&#59; for then Thou wert alone&#44; &#34; no stranger god
                was with Thee&#44;&#34; and now again Thou alone hast re&#8211; deemed us&#44;
                unaided by any other power&#44; from the grasp of sin&#44; from the tyranny of cruel
                oppressions. This is the idea which Jeremiah held out in the darkest days&#44; when
                foolish idolatry was the practice of the men and women of Israel. Then their power
                was broken&#44; and they felt the truth of the word of <pb n="337"/> ON ATONEMENT

                still the name of the Lord is the tower of strength to which we clins&#59; in all
                our sorrows. Is it not then a holy consolation which we justly expe&#8211; rience
                amidst all our trials&#63; a confidence which can&#8211; not be shaken&#44; that
                nothing can destroy the structure of our faith &#63; &#8212; And this noble thought
                should then urge every sinner to come forward and purify him&#8211; self according
                to the law of God&#44; to forsake the in&#8211; iquity in his hands&#44; and to
                render his soul free from the taint of deadly sin &#59; seeing that for thousands of
                years the religion of Israel has proved its efficacy&#44; knowing that the God who
                proclaimed it is sure to punish those who neglect its precepts. &#8212; Let us&#44;
                breth&#8211; ren&#44; feel the full force of this consideration&#44; let us all&#44;
                who have experienced the woful weight of trans&#8211; gression&#44; come to the foot
                of the throne of Mercy to ask for healing&#44; for that balm which has never yet
                failed of restoring the health which had been de&#8211; stroyed by indulgence in
                transgression and sin. And how goodly will it be when the Lord&#44; at our
                appear&#8211; ing in his presence&#44; grants us his approbation&#44; and says
                mercifully&#44; &#34;I will heal your backsliding.&#34; O&#33; such a moment of
                bliss far outweighs all joys of ex&#8211; istence&#44; and such a lot can only be
                accorded to those who&#44; having once sinned&#44; though grievously&#44; have
                sin&#8211; cerely repented of every sin they have committed. Sin&#8211; less none of

                fulfilled. A workman may make an instrument and part with it forever&#59; since he
                cannot be beyond the spot where he happens to be at any one period of time&#44;
                because the liniteness of his nature limits his presence to one place for the time
                being. Not so the Fashioner of our frame &#59; He has created and called forth
                innumer&#8211; able creatures of a thousand varying forms&#44; of a thousand varying
                natures&#59; they fill the spaces both in the immeasurable heavens&#44; and on the
                earth on which we live&#44; and in the waters that are cast around our globe. And
                still they are not beyond the reach of God&#44; they are near Him&#44; at all
                times&#44; in every place&#59; for walls shut not out his presence&#44; oceans and
                deserts do not divide Him &#59; hence none of his works have passed out of his
                reach&#44; although each one moves and lives&#44; and works in its own peculiar
                sphere. Whatever exists was made for the glory of God. It is&#44; however&#44; not
                selfishness which dictates this lim&#8211; ited object of all creation. Were it&#44;

                sole advantage of one is to the mani&#8211; fest injury of the many. If a man
                becomes distin&#8211; guished for power&#44; there are many who must submit to his
                will&#44; whether this submission be founded in rea&#8211; son and consent or not.
                If a man becomes wealthy&#44; many around him may stand in need of the
                necessa&#8211; ries of life&#44; whilst he riots in superfluous plenty. If a man
                attains to renown by his wisdom and learning&#44; he is but too apt to make use of
                this mental power to impose his views upon those less favoured than him&#8211; self.
                It is not well in man therefore to regard him&#8211; self only as of the first
                importance in the scale of beings&#59; for thus he will become an injury to his
                fel&#8211; low&#8211;creatures instead of the blessing which his partic&#8211; ular
                position could easily render him. Far different however is the case with the
                Creator. His glory can never interfere with our well&#8211;being. His power is that
                which sustains all existence&#59; if therefore we submit ourselves yieldingly to his
                rule&#44; we only do what prudence would counsel us &#59; for thus we best secure
                our own happiness&#44; seeing that at all moments of our presence on earth we are
                within his dominion&#44; where his eye always beholds our deeds&#44; where his power
                is ever ready to seize us. &#8212; God&#39;s riches consist of the abundance which
                decks all nature with splen&#8211; dour and beauty&#59; the smallest insect is
                supported by his bounty&#44; and the highest angel is there only by his bidding&#59;

                sustained&#59; none therefore are hungry while in his abode there ruleth plenty&#44;
                none are sighing because his granaries are filled to overflowing. &#8212; And his
                wisdom is not a means of injury to the weak and foolish. For whatever 29* <pb

                conceive and the imagination reach&#44; in their farthest and most painful search
                for truth and instruction. To be therefore created for the glory of God&#44; means
                nothing else than to be destined to the highest per&#8211; fection. The Lord is the
                most perfect&#44; the holiest of all beings&#59; there is no imperfection&#44; no
                defect in his nature&#44; no obscurity in his ken&#44; no hesitation in his
                judgment. Whatever glorifies Him must thus par&#8211; take&#44; no matter in how
                minute a degree&#44; of his per&#8211; fection and greatness&#44; and the nearer any
                one thing approaches to the nature of the Author of all&#44; the more can it
                administer to his glory &#58; the more will it be capable of obtaining and enjoying

                against Heaven&#44; where the soul only transgresses&#44; as in matters of
                faith&#44; whilst the body lends not its aid to display the sentiments by outward
                action&#44; no matter how great the infidelity&#44; how great the inward
                rebellion&#44; the soul alone be&#8211; comes answerable to her Maker&#59; no human
                tribunal can judge of such guilt&#44; no human judgment can be executed upon such a
                criminal. The sin is a moral one&#44; and moral must be the visitation &#59; it is
                the Lord&#44; who is the Master of all spirits&#44; and lie can and will send due
                visitation as soon as&#44; and whenever He may deem it requisite to have his name
                glorified by the prostration of the rebellious worm&#44; the less than a fragment of
                a potter&#39;s vessel&#44; who dares to doubt of his Maker&#39;s power&#44; of his
                Saviour&#39;s mercy&#44; of his God&#39;s providence. &#8212; Well may we say&#58;
                &#34;The com&#8211; mandment of the Lord is pure&#44; it enlighteneth the
                eyes&#59;&#34; it is indeed a study for the simple&#44; but also a wonder to the
                wise &#59; and search through it when young&#44; search through it when old&#44; and
                it reviveth the spirit&#44; it makes the simple wise&#59; and truly may we therefore
                say that&#44; great as is the creation&#44; greater far is the revealed word&#59;
                and it too glorifies the Lord&#44; and speaks of his perfection&#44; and it proves
                that He has made it for the sake of the holiness of his name&#44; that he might be
                sanctified among the sons of man. &#8212; We could add much more&#44; we could

                all know &#63; what all mankind acknowledge if they have but received the proper
                instruction &#63; &#8212; And then I speak to Israel&#8211; ites who&#44; with
                me&#44; believe in the same law&#44; worship the same God &#59; and they will surely
                ascribe glory to his name&#44; and love the wisdom of his ordaining&#44; and bless
                his holy name for having given the law of truth and the life everlasting to his
                people Israel. This consideration brings us at once to the subject to which I wished
                to direct your attention&#44; by apply&#8211; ing our text to ourselves as members
                of the house of Jacob. We too are a creation&#44; a special work of the Lord&#44;
                that He may be glorified. If by the formation of man as the image of God&#44; by the
                bestowal of the Bible which is the word of God&#44; the world was greatly
                benefitted&#44; and the name of the Lord magnified and extolled &#58; He is not the
                less apparent in his glory by the selection of Israel as his own peculiar treasure.
                Look on the image of God &#33; how often has he de&#8211; teriorated from his noble
                calling&#59; how did he fall in Adam when he ate of the tree of knowledge&#44;
                though every thing was allowed him&#44; save the fruit of the one tree which was in
                the midst of the garden &#59; how had he swerved from the path pointed out when the
                waters of the flood came over the earth&#44; &#34; because she had been filled with
                violence&#59;&#34; and how wofully was he derelict when&#44; at the building of the
                tower and city in the land of Shin ear&#44; he sought to frustrate the councils of
                his Maker&#44; to spread the human family over the face of the earth. &#8212; And
                the word of God &#33; how has it been contemned at all times and under all
                circumstances &#33; In all ages&#44; man has striven against its decrees&#44; as

                its pages&#44; as though destruction would follow iu the path pointed out to us as
                the one in which we should walk. If then man had been made in the image of God
                only&#44; and the word had been merely cast abroad without a human guardian to watch
                over it in its struggles for supremacy over sin and death &#58; mankind would never
                have become perfected&#44; and the rank offspring of superstition and folly would
                have over&#8211; shadowed the purest and best gift of God to his chil&#8211; dren.
                You may ask&#58; &#34;Why does sin exist&#63;&#34; This is a question not for us to
                solve &#59; perhaps God wished to form a creature that should struggle for
                salvation&#44; that should&#44; not like the angels&#44; who are nothing but
                purity&#44; and whose beatitude is inherent in their very being&#44; labour with
                diligence to become exalted and accepted on High. This we do know that&#44; if we
                have received feelings which excite to sin&#44; we have in&#8211; herent in us
                stronger powers than sin&#44; which enable us to struggle successfully&#44; and to
                overcome the evil&#44; and be obedient in all things. But above all&#44; free choice
                was imparted to our nature&#59; and hence we are at liberty to refuse the kingdom of
                Heaven if in our perversity we may choose to do so. &#8212; We therefore say&#44;
                that without a custodian of the Bible&#44; the glori&#8211; ous work of the Lord
                would have sunk under and beneath the dominion of sin&#44; unless the Lord
                him&#8211; self had come to rescue this blissful gift from amidst the destruction.
                &#8212; Now this precisely came to pass. &#8212; First&#44; the age of the flood
                proved by their iniquity that they would not live under the law. Next the age of the
                Babylonian Tower testified likewise&#44; that they did not value the kingdom of the
                Lord. In the days of Abraham also&#44; though he preached and <pb n="352"/> 352 THE
                OBJECT OF THE CREATION. taught the truth&#44; crime had again become prevalent&#44;
                and Sodom and its sister towns were overwhelmed&#44; because there were not ten
                righteous men to obtain pardon for their city. And. when we look unto Egypt at the
                time when sixty myriads of Israel&#39;s sons were slaves and bondmen in its
                boundaries&#44; a tyrannical Pharaoh exclaimed&#44; &#34;Who is the Lord&#33;&#34;
                It was therefore that the Lord willed to &#34; form to himself a people that they
                might tell his praise&#44;&#34; as the prophet Isaiah expresses himself in chapter
                xliii. 22. False to their God were Noah&#39;s generation &#59; false to their God
                the generation of Babel&#59; false the men of Abra&#8211; ham&#39;s age&#59; false
                the wise rulers of Egypt. But the truth was not to perish&#44; because it was not
                loved&#59; God&#39;s glory was not to be hidden to everlasting&#44; be&#8211; cause
                man loved idols and vanity. The Lord for this reason educated our fathers in the
                midst of tribula&#8211; tion&#44; that they might know Him as their sole Re&#8211;
                deemer&#44; as their only God and Father&#59; as says the same prophet whom we just
                quoted &#40;Isaiah xlviii. 10&#41;&#58; &#34;Behold&#44; I have refined thee&#44;
                though not unto silver&#44; I have approved thee in the crucible of affliction.&#34;
                And in good truth&#44; they were tried in the iron fur&#8211; nace&#44; even in
                Egypt&#44; to make them fit to be the re&#8211; cipients of the precious word&#44;
                and to look forever unto the Lord as their sole Refuge&#44; as their only Saviour in
                the midst of tribulations. Artd thus did you arise&#44; men of Israel &#33; spring
                up as does the noble plant from the midst of the corruptions of the earth&#44; to
                blossom in the presence of the nations as the blissful tree which is to ripen the
                fruit of salva&#8211; tion. And when after your establishment you en&#8211;

                can only live in God. When many fell off and would have no portion in David&#44; nor
                inheritance in the son of Jesse&#44; again the sword was unsheathed&#44; and you
                were rendered few instead of having been as numerous as the stars of heaven. But yet
                a remnant remained&#44; a remnant glorious as your ancestry&#44; noble as your
                progenitors. And they stood unflinchingly on the day of battle&#44; and they defied
                the foe whilst the warm life&#8211;blood flowed freely from their deadly wounds&#59;
                and dying&#44; these blessed men handed the standard to the almost unconscious
                youth&#44; who had grown up in the midst of these struggles&#44; that they might
                bear it onward till that time&#44; when it should float triumphant over the walls
                and ramparts of the newly risen Jerusalem. And you&#44; brethren &#33; are here this
                day&#44; as the descendants of these undaunted he&#8211; roes and martyrs&#44; who
                glorified the Name which an&#8211; gels mention in dread and adoration&#44; and the
                legacy which they carried away as the only treasure which they saved from the wreck
                of their empire&#44; is still yours&#44; &#8212; yours&#44; if you will bear it in

                The promise was made amidst the gratitude of over&#8211; flowing hearts for
                innumerable benefits received&#44; in the midst of admiration at the greatness of
                the Lord&#44; displayed to the understanding and knowledge of all. This promise was
                ratified when your fathers entered the holy land&#44; when Joshua&#44; before he
                died&#44; again asked them &#34;whom they would serve&#59;&#34; they then again
                chose the Lord. Again&#44; when Solomon built the temple&#44; the people came in the
                covenant and re&#8211; joiced before the Lord &#34; seven and seven days&#44; even

                state&#44; the covenant was renewed&#44; and from that moment idolatry was banished
                from among us. And in each generation since then&#44; there have been those who bore

                in forming you&#44; combined the image of himself with his word&#44; so that both

                without it we should be like the other nations of the earth&#44; with it we are

                town&#44; &#34;men of number&#34; in all lands. Without us the evidence of the truth
                of God&#39;s law and the certainty of his ultimate sole reign on earth would be
                entirely obliterated &#59; and still they are facts which are of the utmost

                same from the beginning even to the end of time&#44; and ages that have passed have
                beheld in Thee the same goodness which we this day witness&#59; and those ages whicb
                are to follow will find no change in Thee&#44; in thy truth&#44; and in thy mercy.
                how hast Thou upheld Jacob &#33; from the birth of thy servant Thou didst watch over
                him that he sunk not before the power of his violent brother&#58; and from the first
                wandering of his sons unto the present hour Thou hast guarded them that they fell
                not before the violence and hatred of a hostile world. Could we have arisen to bless
                thy name without thy special providence &#63; could we have stood undestroyed
                without thy gracious guidance &#63; well do we know this&#44; and thereat is our
                soul rejoiced&#44; that at all times we are thy special witnesses&#44; whom Thou
                wilt not forsake though fiercely howls the storm of persecu&#8211; tion&#44; and
                though great are the backsliclings of our sinners. But bless us now&#44; O Father
                &#33; whose are all the blessings which gladden the world&#59; bless us with the
                blessing of thy providential care&#44; with the light of thy countenance&#44; with
                the mercy of peace&#44; that thy grace may abound in our midst&#44; and produce
                fruits of righteousness&#44; the scent whereof shall be like Leb&#8211; anon&#39;s
                fragrance&#44; and the roots of which shall be im&#8211; movable even as the cedars
                which stand unshaken <pb n="360"/> 360 SENTIMENT AND PRACTICE. amidst the roaring of
                the hurricane which scatters desolation in its path. And let us be glad in thy
                sal&#8211; vation&#44; and be our God as Thou hast promised&#44; even for the merit
                of thy servants&#44; Abraham&#44; Isaac&#44; and Jacob&#44; and for the sake of thy
                holy Name&#44; which is mighty and fearful. Amen. Brethren &#33; We often boast that
                we are duly imbued with re&#8211; ligious sentiments&#44; whatever else our conduct
                may betoken&#59; we fancy that we love God in our heart&#44; though our outward acts
                contradict our own self&#8211;con&#8211; gratulations &#59; and when we are under
                the influence of such sentiments&#44; we are very unwilling to listen to
                correction&#44; and even imagine those who act more and speak less as far beneath us
                in piety and genuine de&#8211; votion. Every person almost sets up a standard of
                righteousness by which he measures himself&#59; and whilst one attaches all
                importance to acts&#44; another does the same to sentiments. We have thus
                formal&#8211; ists and sentimentalists&#44; who each in turn look upon the others as
                deficient in godliness&#44; simply because these do not come up to their own
                imaginary standard&#44; which they have arbitrarily set up as their own proper rule
                of conduct. But it is nowise difficult to ascertain that sentiment is only the&#34;
                foundation&#44; not the perfec&#8211; tion&#44; of religion&#44; and that acts may
                be the mere effects of education and practice without exciting the least permanent
                emotion in the heart. As little as mere devotion without morality is religion&#44;
                can form with&#8211; out love of God be dignified by this title &#59; on the other
                hand mere morality is not religion&#44; is not at least Jewish religion &#59; nor
                can a merely professed love of <pb n="361"/> SENTIMENT AND PRACTICE. 361 God be
                looked upon as meritorious without it is dis&#8211; played in some sacrifices&#44;
                which the man who really loves God is willing to make in his service. It must
                therefore be evident to us&#44; if we think at all&#44; that there must be some
                error in the various assumptions of exclusive piety&#44; whilst persons so
                materially differ&#8211; ing in speech and acts all claim to be possessed of the
                genuine measure of godliness &#59; since it must force it&#8211; self on our
                conviction that&#44; if the one praises senti&#8211; ments exclusively&#44; whilst
                the other neglects them al&#8211; together&#44; both cannot be correct in their
                diverging appreciation of what constitutes religion. Hence a duty arises to us to
                investigate in what real religion does consist&#44; that we on the one side may be
                able to judge with knowledge of the merits of the different claimants&#44; and on
                the other to acquire for ourselves the true standard after we have discovered where
                we can obtain it. Let us investigate &#58; Why do we act &#63; what induces us to
                practise any line of conduct &#63; Either it is some&#8211; thing to our advantage
                which incites us&#44; or it is that we wish to oblige a friend or one to whom we are
                in&#8211; debted&#44; or it is that we have cause to fear some one more powerful
                than ourselves whom our acting other&#8211; wise might induce to do us some
                indefinite injury. Even those acts which apparently are to our disadvan&#8211;
                tage&#44; for instance charity and personal benevolence&#44; are no exceptions to
                this position&#59; since by giving we gratify our feeling of benevolence&#44; which
                would cause us pain and uneasiness if we were to pass by those whom we could readily
                aid without bestowing some assistance on them &#59; it is therefore a species of
                reward which we experience at the moment we serve others vol. v. 31 <pb n="362"/>
                362 SENTIMENT AND PRACTICE. which impels us to be kind and serviceable to our
                fel&#8211; low&#8211;beings. No man however will do anything which he believes to be
                to his manifest injury&#44; or from which he does not expect to reap a greater
                benefit than the sacrifice he makes. If a man&#44; therefore&#44; is presented with
                a religious duty&#44; and is told that he is bound to observe it&#44; there must be
                some inducement presented to him at the same time&#44; why he should act
                accord&#8211; ingly&#44; or else he will to a surety refuse acquiescence. For he
                might say&#58; &#34;What am I to gain thereby&#63; who has any claims upon nrv
                compliance that I should yield obedience&#63; who is there who could injure me if I
                pretermit this act which is demanded of me&#63;&#34; You will see&#44; brethren&#44;
                that he requires one of the elements which prompt conduct before he can act&#59; for
                no one in his sound senses will comply with any demand without having some weighty
                motives for so doing&#44; especially if the act be not merely for the mo&#8211;
                ment&#44; but would have to be repeated for a period longer or shorter&#44;
                according as his days may be pro&#8211; longed or not. &#8212; In other words&#44;
                there must be a sen&#8211; timent&#44; or rather a series of sentiments which alone
                can induce a man to act. Suppose he were for the first time to be told of the
                duty&#44; to observe&#44; for in&#8211; stance&#44; the weekly Sabbath &#58; you
                would be compelled to show him either that it would be to his own ad&#8211;
                vantage&#44; or that he would oblige some one who has claims upon him&#44; or at
                last that he might suffer from the resentment of a superior Being in case he were
                disobedient. Difficult as it might be to infuse such a sentiment in a grown&#8211;up
                person who had never known of such a duty&#44; it is nevertheless easily possible to
                im&#8211; bue the mind of a child with it to such an extent that <pb n="363"/>
                SENTIMENT AND PRACTICE. 363 he in after&#8211;years will feel it as a part of his
                being&#44; which he cannot throw off without doing a species of violence to his very
                nature. Still it must be based upon some tangible motive&#44; or else he will be apt
                to let secondary considerations afterwards prevail to in&#8211; duce him to commit
                this very violence&#44; and to adopt a new line of conduct more consonant with his
                ap&#8211; parent interests. ^N&#34;ow&#44; it is requisite to impress on the
                mind&#44; in order to produce a compliance with the religious duty which we have
                described&#44; that it is of the utmost importance to man himself to be
                religious&#59; first&#44; because he is the absolute gainer thereby &#59;
                secondly&#44; because the Being who demands compliance has claims upon his
                grati&#8211; tude &#59; and thirdly&#44; because this same Being has the power to
                make him feel the weight of his displeasure if he refuses obedience. In other
                words&#44; man must be convinced that religion is a blessing to him&#44; and the
                reverse an injury and a detriment in every sphere wherein he may be placed. The
                sentiment therefore which is the foundation of duty is composed of a threefold
                element &#58; personal interest&#44; gratitude&#44; and fear&#59; or in other
                words&#44; self&#8211;love&#44; love of God&#44; and fear of God. If I now am fully
                convinced in my mind that the virtues which our religion prescribes are the very
                essence of my happiness &#58; I have the most pow&#8211; erful motive of
                seli&#8211;interest to practise them&#44; even if they apparently demand a sacrifice
                of my time&#44; means&#44; and personal exertions. If this should not be enough to
                urge me on&#44; perhaps the love I feel for my great Benefactor&#44; who is to me
                Father&#44; Guide&#44; Life&#44; and God&#44; may impel me to endeavour to do
                something by which I can show to my own self that this feeling is <pb n="364"/> 364
                SENTIMENT AND PRACTICE. something more than a mere empty sound&#44; that it is a
                sentiment which produces action as well as words. And if this&#44; too&#44; should
                tail to influence me&#44; I may perhaps he induced to obedience by the
                consideration&#44; that I am exposing myself constantly to retribution for
                neglecting what I have been taught as my duty&#59; inasmuch as God&#44; who is so
                benelicent in all his acts&#44; is also ready to mete out punishment if his mercy is
                not heeded and his will is contemned. Now&#44; there may be many who observe
                religion&#44; be&#8211; cause they have been accustomed to do so from their
                infancy&#44; they do as their fathers have done&#44; and reflect&#44; however&#44;
                very little upon their course of life&#44; whether it be the offspring of reason or
                otherwise. They have grown up with the idea that certain acts&#44; ceremonial and
                social&#44; are necessary &#59; they have so seen it done by their parents&#59; and
                whilst no other motive is pre&#8211; sented to them&#44; they find it easier to
                conform than to transgress. But remove them from their associates&#44; and place
                them among those who scoff at Judaism&#44; who worship their own inclinations and
                make an idol of the gold for which they labour&#58; and it is no rare occurrence to
                see such strict conformists fall off by degrees&#44; and contradict their former
                deeds by a new course of conduct. Is it that their religion is of less value in
                itself than it was hitherto &#63; &#8212; No &#8212; it is because they have never
                felt its importance&#44; and they throw it off&#44; because they do not feel its
                value now. They were formalists&#44; and no sentiment mingled with their outward
                devotion &#59; their soul was void&#44; whilst their hands mechanically acted the
                part which had always been assigned to them. No one who is a friend to our religion
                will there&#8211; <pb n="365"/> SENTIMENT AND PRACTICE. 365 fore teach that we
                should not above all endeavour to impress a strong sentiment of devotion on the mind
                of our children &#59; for this is the very stay which is to support them in their
                struggle with sensual life&#44; which they must wage fiercely and unyieldingly from
                the moment they have thrown off the leading&#8211;strings of infantile years. It is
                the battle&#8211;axe which they must wield&#44; when temptation comes to meet them
                with the allurements of pleasure or the hopes of gain. It is the shield which alone
                can ward off the javelins which are hurled against their peace by the enemies of
                their race and their religion. But to assert that the senti&#8211; ment of devotion
                is all which is required&#44; would be saying that it were enough if the tree would
                produce leaves and blossoms in abundance&#44; while not a single fruit should come
                to maturity. O beautiful indeed is faith &#33; it is like the flowers which enrich
                the land&#8211; scape in the spring&#8211;time of year &#59; it is like them lovely
                to the eye&#44; fragrant to the smell&#59; it refreshes the spirit&#44; it appeals
                with its loveliness to the feeling soul. But if it remain fruitless&#44; if the
                summer come and there be no young fruits on the tree of life&#44; if the au&#8211;
                tumn come and there be nothing to be gathered from the naked branches &#58; what is
                its use &#63; what has it availed in the scale of righteousness &#63; There may have
                been the green leaves of lip&#8211;service&#44; there may have been the fragrant
                flowers of heartfelt devotion &#59; bat there are wanting the seed&#8211;bearing
                products which are to propagate the tree from which they sprung&#44; which are to

                riccl of enjoying what is&#44; in truth&#44; good and lovely. Faith&#44;
                therefore&#44; without acts is the death of the spirit&#44; it lulls it into
                security&#44; causing it to imagine an excellence which does not exist&#59; it is a
                fading flower&#44; an exhaled odour&#59; but faith followed by ac&#8211; tion is a
                devotion displayed in permanent deeds &#59; it is ever fresh&#44; ever fragrant&#59;
                and as one act passes away by its accomplishment&#44; another will be ready to take
                its place &#59; and then each in its turn will leave a puri&#8211; fying effect on
                the soul&#44; and add life to mortality&#44; im&#8211; perishable existence to the
                days of man that fleet away and then are felt no more. Words are mere sounds&#44;
                professions are mere aspirations&#44; which may or not indicate that the heart is
                true&#59; but where ac&#8211; tions accompany the earnest word&#44; where the lips
                not alone speak of charity but where the hand too is ready to assist&#58; there
                indeed dwells the fount of life&#44; there the spirit of truth has taken up its
                blessed abode. But how easy is the worship of the lips &#33; how easy is it to say
                &#34; I love God&#44;&#34; whilst the deeds that are to betoken this love are

                of God&#44; who is our Creator&#44; our Father&#59; we profess to fear the Lord&#44;
                who is our King and Ruler. But where are the deeds that are to represent these
                sentiments&#63; And still we say inquiringly&#44; In what have we been
                deficient&#63; do we not love God with all our heart&#63; are we not deeply imbued
                with his unity&#44; his greatness &#63; do we not value ourselves&#44; chiefly&#44;
                for being children of the covenant&#63; descendants from Abraham &#63; do we not
                regularly at&#8211; tend public worship &#63; are we not present at all assem&#8211;
                blies &#63; And so to the end of the catalogue of pleas&#8211; ant virtues&#44; we
                have a great deal to congratulate ourselves about&#44; we are wonderfully good in
                all these things &#59; but alas &#33; all of these are mere pleasant exer&#8211;
                cises&#44; they impose no burden upon our inclinations&#44; and they are an easy
                method of being pious. Still is it indeed by these means that we honour God&#63;
                asks He only of us that we should feel inward love &#63; have inward faith &#63; is
                with this our duty discharged &#63; Only let us look at the law and see what this
                teaches in re&#8211; spect to duty&#44; and then let us answer candidly whether or
                not we have despised his Name. He is indeed the universal Father&#44; and as such He
                has taught us&#44; his children&#44; how we should live in our houses&#44; how we
                should be in the field&#44; how we should act in the city. But we pretend to know
                every thing better than the Bible. Are we told that it is wrong to pollute
                our&#8211; selves with the food of gentiles &#58; we querulously de&#8211; mand&#44;
                &#34; Why shall we not eat &#63;&#34; or we say&#44; &#34; Let those abstain whose

                ourselves absolved&#44; we do not believe such laws were intended for our
                enlightened age&#44; they were for an&#8211; cient times&#44; in the hot climates of
                Arabia.&#34; This is new reasoning &#33; but is it fit for those who really
                hon&#8211; our their Father&#63; He ordains as plainly as words can do in his holy
                book&#44; that certain things shall be unclean to the house of Israel&#44; that they
                should be considered as defiling those whom He had set apart to be his chosen
                people. If therefore we really feel a filial respect for Him&#44; how can we set up
                our own judgment above his&#63; and where in his whole law is there any dispensation
                granted to any age or to any country to abolish or to limit the prohibitions &#63;
                &#34; Why shall we not eat&#63;&#34; Even because God has prohibited it&#33; He has
                chosen us as his people&#44; to be the recipients of his religion&#44; to be holy
                unto Him through the ob&#8211; servance of his precepts. And it is not a great thing
                He has asked of us to maintain our separate existence&#59; lie has not asked of us
                to mar our bodies&#44; or to wear outwardly some peculiar distinctive mark&#59; He
                has not asked of us to avoid all pleasures or to look upon every enjoyment as
                sinful&#59; lie has not asked of us that we should afflict our bodies by corporeal
                punish&#8211; ment or by long fasts&#58; none of these acts are pre&#8211; scribed
                in the law&#59; we should merely be circumspect in our diet&#44; and be careful to
                eschew all those sub&#8211; stances which He has set apart for us as unclean. The
                reason assigned is&#44; that we should thereby be&#8211; come holy to our God&#44;
                who is himself holy&#44; and who is our supreme Benefactor&#59; who has conducted us
                out from amidst the hardships of slavery&#44; that He might be our God. And shall we
                refuse this little mark of obedience&#63; we who so ardently profess to honour and

                with reverence for the holy Name&#44; and shall we hesitate whether or not we will

                us that our Father speaks&#63; and shall we bargain&#44; advance in our
                obedience&#44; or deduct therefrom as though we were going to purchase some
                commodity in the public market for the use of our table &#63; We call this
                honour&#63; love of God &#63; And then we ask&#44; &#34; By what have we dishonoured
                thy name&#63;&#34; O &#33; for the blindness of sinning man &#33; his standard of
                love are his own desires&#44; his own pleasures &#59; and whilst the honour to God
                demands nothing militating against them&#44; he does pay this tribute&#59; but no
                sooner is he to make them a sacrifice upon God&#39;s altar&#44; than he finds that
                there is no good reason for this or that command &#59; the merciful Father could not
                desire that he should forego the good things of this world &#59; the Supreme Wisdom
                could not possibly attach any im&#8211; portance to such trifling acts. But how do
                we know that this is not actually the case&#63; how do we know what are trifles
                &#63; The only arbiter to decide these questions is the written Word of God&#44; and
                therein we are distinctly told that&#44; not alone is it the will of our Father that
                we should abstain&#44; that we should regulate our appetite in all that He has
                prohibited unto us&#44; but that we would be unworthy of his holiness which

                element when you watch and control it. It softens for you the hardest iron&#44; that
                you can mould it into shapes both useful and ornamental&#44; that you may with its
                means till the soil&#44; or measure the flight of time. By its means the products of
                the earth&#44; unfit for use in their crude state&#44; are converted into sa&#8211;

                element of civilization and refine&#8211; ment&#44; whilst it obeys your decrees.
                But let it once escape from under your control&#44; let its spirit be free to roam
                abroad in its wild and onward course &#58; and it spares not the venerable and the
                holy&#44; and it strides with daring steps over all that man holds dear&#44; over
                all that his hands have fashioned. Even so are your own desires. Guard them
                well&#44; and they impel you to all that is noble&#44; they give birth to whatever
                is beautiful. They are the parents of scientific dis&#8211; covery&#44; they induce

                you are servants of the Most High &#59; you have placed his fear away from you&#44;
                and seek only to follow the fleeting enjoyments of the moment instead of pursuing
                the straight line of duty&#44; within the narrow limits of which your religion
                permits you to act &#59; because you have in fact thrown off your al&#8211; legiance
                to your God&#44; whilst you still profess with outward words that you acknowledge
                Him as your Master. You will observe&#44; brethren&#44; that the prophet ad&#8211;
                dresses not those who have no religious impressions&#44; but those who make the
                profession thereof the busi&#8211; ness of their lives &#59; he addresses in fact
                the priests who were to offer on the altar of the Lord the daily sacrifice. We are
                therefore warranted to appty our text as we have done to those sentimentalists
                who&#44; whilst they say that they love their divine Father and fear their heavenly
                Master&#44; are so careless in obedi&#8211; ence. It will be seen that the prophet
                insists upon it&#44; that it is not enough to bring a sacrifice&#44; if it be not
                undefiled&#44; and the best which the flock affords. Let us apply this to the
                unfortunate lip&#8211;worship with which so many of our people are affected. They

                the formalist&#44; who acts merely from habit&#44; is sadly deficient in the
                ennobling feeling which a deepseated love of God can alone produce &#59; still his
                acts are worth something&#44; both to himself and as an example to others&#59;
                whereas the man of words will be an injury to himself and an evil exam&#8211; ple to
                all those whom his authority can influence. No&#44; our religion demands an active
                faith&#44; a belief that we are God&#39;s creatures and servants&#44; deeply
                imbedded in the innermost recesses of oar spirit&#44; which faith is to develop
                itself upon all possible occasions and every day of our life&#44; by acts in
                obedience to the will of God. Let us then admire the law of our Father by which we
                are presented with means to be constant servants&#44; and which requires us not to
                wait for great occasions to enable us to act. &#34;Whenever the Israelite rises&#44;
                there is the word of the law which he is to re&#8211; peat as an act of
                obedience&#59; whenever he sits down to his meal&#44; he will watch that nothing
                prohibited <pb n="375"/> SENTIMENT AND PRACTICE. 375 has been placed upon his
                table&#59; whenever the sun declines&#44; there is allotted to him a brief time in
                which he is to address his Father in the words of entreaty and devotion&#59; and
                before he seeks his couch to enjoy the nightly repose&#44; he is again to perform a
                little act of devotion&#44; and commend his spirit to his Maker ere he composes
                himself to sleep. And between these acts of worship&#44; there are constant
                opportunities to do some little favour to the poor&#44; to be kind in some way to
                his opulent neighbour&#44; to cause some joy to the afflicted&#44; to participate in
                the happiness of the prosperous&#44; to be in fact imitating his God in his acts of
                mercy&#44; to become an Israelite&#44; a divine chief among men in imitation of the
                glorious progenitor of our race&#44; whose devotion to God was intimately connected
                with love for his Master&#39;s creatures. &#8212; Thus only can we really show that
                the honour of our Father is not a mere hollow sound&#44; and that the fear of our
                Master is a living principle which pervades all our thoughts and feelings&#44; to
                stimulate us to activity in the field of duty pointed out to us by Providence. By
                this means too the name of the Lord will be glorified in the world&#59; his kingdom
                will spread all around us&#44; sin&#8211; ners will be restrained in their
                sinfulness&#44; and each one so acting will be in truth a priest of the Lord&#44;
                whose lips are overflowing with wisdom&#44; and who is himself aifangel of the Lord
                of Hosts&#44; because he leads many away from sin&#44; by bringing them under the

                O&#44; our Father &#33; upheld by thy goodness&#44; thy chil&#8211; dren have met
                the fiery ordeal of suffering and per&#8211; secution without being consumed&#44;
                and after every sorrow they have arisen strengthened and quickened to a renewed
                life&#44; feeling that it was through Thee that they were saved&#44; that through
                Thee they lived. Twice have we been driven from our heritage&#44; be&#8211; cause of
                our rebellion &#59; but even then Thou didst temper justice with mercy&#59; and
                though the sword slew its millions&#44; each time a remnant escaped in whom there
                dwelt thy truth and thy law &#59; and thus have we arisen at this late day to be the
                witnesses of thy power&#44; the defenders of thy law&#44; in whom Thou may est be
                glorified. Do therefore cause that Ave may become fully alive to our appointment on
                earth&#44; that we may steadfastly adhere to thy com&#8211; mandments&#44; and not
                turn to the right or the left from the path which thy wisdom has marked out for us
                as the road which we ought to travel. So that genera&#8211; tions which are to come
                after us may be urged on by our example&#44; and that to the latest descendants of
                the human race thy glory may till the world&#44; and thy fear subdue every heart.
                Amen. Brethren &#33; Through the transgressions of our fathers the temple had been
                destroyed&#44; and those who ought to have <pb n="377"/> FULFILMENT OF PROPHECY. 377
                worshipped therein had been carried away into cap&#8211; tivity&#59; but when
                seventy years after the final expul&#8211; sion had elapsed&#44; the Lord had mercy
                on a portion of his people&#44; and caused Cyrus to grant permission unto those&#44;
                who felt inclined to return&#44; to go up to Judaea to assist in rebuilding the
                house of God. We say&#44; a portion of Israel only was included in this restoration
                &#59; for history proves that a comparatively small number returned to Palestine
                under Ezra&#59; and the Jews of the second temple never reached the eminence which
                the united Israelites had attained under David and Solomon. If one investigates
                there&#8211; fore the biblical text with candour&#44; he must arrive at the
                conclusion&#44; that the restoration from the Baby&#8211; lonian captivity was not
                the gathering of the nation of Israel which Moses had foretold&#59; since the
                majority of the people did not reassemble in Palestine&#44; and it is not to be
                supposed that the return of a mere frag&#8211; ment could be a compensation for the
                continued ban&#8211; ishment of the great mass of Israel. In truth the later
                prophets&#44; Ilaggai&#44; Zechariah&#44; and Malachi&#44; who lived after the
                rebuilding of the temple&#44; speak of a future glory of the Israelites&#44; thereby
                testifying that they did not eonsider the restoration&#44; which they them&#8211;
                selves witnessed&#44; as the consummation of the promises made through the prophets
                of the first temple and the Babylonian captivity. Xow we cannot believe that the
                prophets predicted things which were not to occur&#44; or that a part of what they
                foretold* could justly remain unfulfilled whilst only a portion came to pass&#59;
                for in this manner we would have to regard the pre&#8211; dietions which proceed
                from the Supreme Wisdom as the assertions of mere men&#44; which may or may not 32*
                    <pb n="378"/> 378 FULFILMENT OF PROPHECY. be accomplished&#59; and if we proceed
                in this way&#44; Scrip&#8211; ture would not afford us any guide&#44; either to
                direct thereby our course of life&#44; or to afford us any sure instruction with
                regard to belief and doctrine. But since we believe in the whole legacy which we
                have received from God&#44; we must&#44; and we do&#44; regard the whole as of equal
                authority&#59; and we therefore claim for the entire system of prophetic predictions
                an equal claim to credibility&#59; and we do maintain that we can&#8211; not say
                that the prophecies with respect to our nation have been fulfilled&#44; whilst any
                portion of them re&#8211; mains unaccomplished&#59; and that all those predictions
                which have not yet been brought to pass&#44; will sooner or later see their
                fulfilment&#44; in the manner which the Holy Spirit has predicted through the mouth
                of the prophets. &#8212; Another point also is inseparably con&#8211; nected with
                this interpretation of Scripture&#44; which is&#44; that the same system for
                explaining the sacred records must obtain throughout&#59; and by this rule the same
                word&#44; though occurring in different parts of the Bible&#44; must have precisely
                the same signification. There are however persons&#44; who profess to believe in
                Scripture equally with ourselves&#44; who have adopted a mode of explanation
                differing entirely from our method&#59; since some portions have according to their
                manner a direct or literal signification&#44; whilst others are explained
                figuratively&#44; or in a way differing from the evident meaning of the words
                employed by the text. Xow&#44; it may be&#44; that&#44; in some of their
                predictions&#44; the prophets alluded to a peculiar state of existence more
                spiritual than our present one&#44; and hence the words they employed must receive a
                higher and more spirit&#8211; ual interpretation than they would in their simple <pb
                    n="379"/> FULFILMENT OF PROPHECY. 379 application to ordinary worldly objects.
                But even admitting this&#44; the words mast nevertheless bear an analogy to objects
                which were in existence in the days when the prophecies were delivered&#44; and have
                therefore a meaning to be determined by the objects to which they bear a
                resemblance&#59; and hence the rule holds good&#44; that after all a verse of
                Scripture must be taken in its literal sense&#44; in order to enable us to arrive at
                its proper meaning. When therefore the prophets speak in their most mysterious
                predic&#8211; tions of any particular people&#44; they refer to that people only and
                no other&#44; no matter by what affinity an&#8211; other nation may become allied
                to&#44; or substituted for the one mentioned by them. So if the text names the
                people Israel&#44; the persons comprised by that term&#44; at the time the prophecy
                was delivered&#44; must be un&#8211; derstood&#44; or&#44; in other words&#44;
                Israel proper&#44; the de&#8211; scendants of Jacob. And in fact any other mode of
                interpretation would be absurd. For independ&#8211; ently of the promises of future
                blessings&#44; punishments also were foretold as being impending over the same
                nation. History however teaches&#44; that the threatened visitation was actually
                inflicted upon the descend&#8211; ants of Jacob&#59; their kings were one after the
                other made captives by foreign invaders &#59; their temple was destroyed by
                barbarians who conquered the land&#59; and the individuals composing the people of
                Israel were all driven away from their country&#44; which was left deprived of its
                inhabitants&#44; a desert and depopu&#8211; lated waste&#44; and a dwelling for wild
                beasts&#44; instead of being covered to the mountain&#8211;tops with waving crops
                and peaceful herds and flocks&#44; instead of being the seat of numerous beautiful
                cities filled with a <pb n="380"/> 380 FULFILMENT OF PROPHECY. teeming
                population&#44; in the highest degree refined&#44; and in possession of wealth and
                all the means of earthly comfort and happiness. If now the prophets speak of
                captives to return&#44; whom can they mean but the descendants of those very men to
                whom they spoke&#44; and whom they threatened with expulsion from their beautiful
                homes for their manifold trans&#8211; gressions &#63; If they spoke of the wastes to
                be rendered fruitful again&#44; what desolate fields could they possibly mean&#44;
                except those fruitful plains over which their prophetic eye saw the desolating hosts
                of Israel&#39;s enemies sweeping with fire and sword&#44; leaving be&#8211; hind
                them a howling desolation where before every thing smiled in plenty &#63; If they
                spoke of cities aris&#8211; ing from their ashes&#44; to what others could they
                refer except those beautiful towns which then contained the thoughtless masses&#44;
                who sinned forgetful that there is enthroned above a righteous God&#44; who
                pun&#8211; ishes iniquity and guilt with just retribution&#44; although the
                visitation be long delayed &#63; &#8212; Only let us consider&#44; that the prophet
                spoke to Jacob&#39;s descendants&#59; they addressed a people of which they were
                themselves members &#59; the language they employed was the lan&#8211; guage of the
                country with which all their hearers were familiar&#58; consequently they were
                understood by their contemporaries in a literal sense&#59; and as they took no pains
                to expound their metaphorical meaning&#44; if they had any such&#44; we are
                empowered to assert that the only proper method of explaining prophecy is to
                understand it as it was understood by the persons to whom it was addressed. These
                evi&#8211; dently took it according to the literal signification of the words&#44;
                or else the threatened punishments could <pb n="381"/> FULFILMENT OF PROPHECY. 381
                never have had any tendency to inspire the people with fear&#44; or lead them to
                repentance &#59; and we con&#8211; sequently must understand it in the same
                light&#44; and look upon the terms employed as meaning precisely what they meant in
                the days of the prophets. If now such a construction would lead us to think that the
                prophecies&#44; wherein these terms are used&#44; have not been accomplished as yet
                &#58; we are fully warranted in assuming that we must expect their fulfilment in a
                future time&#44; and that no forced exposition or a meta&#8211; phorical explanation
                of the terms can be regarded as an accomplishment of the promises delivered to us by
                the prophets. Now it is evident that the restoration of the cap&#8211; tives was not
                entire at the time of Ezra &#59; a mere hand&#8211; ful came back from Babylon &#59;
                and the majority of the tribes of Benjamin&#44; Judah&#44; and Levi&#44; who were
                car&#8211; ried away with Zedekiah&#44; king of Judah&#44; by Nebu&#8211;
                chadnezzar&#44; not to mention the Israelites proper&#44; or the ten tribes who were
                expelled by the king of As&#8211; syria&#44; remained behind in the countries to
                which they had been banished. But if we revert to the thirtieth chapter of
                Deuteronomy &#40;3&#8211;5&#41;&#44; we will find the follow&#8211; ing words&#58;
                &#34; And the Lord thy God will restore thy captivity and have mercy on thee&#44;
                and He will return and gather thee from all the nations whither the Lord thy God
                will have scattered thee. If thy outcasts shall be at the end of the heavens&#44;
                from there will the Lord thy God gather thee&#44; and from there will He take thee.
                And the Lord thy God will bring thee to the land which thy fathers possessed&#44;
                and thou shalt possess it&#44; and He will do good to thee and multiply thee more
                than thy fathers.&#34; It is true&#44; <pb n="382"/> 382 FULFILMENT OF PROPHECY. the
                returned captives lived in the same land which their fathers had inhabited&#59; but
                where was their greater prosperity&#63; where their greater numbers&#63; But little
                is known of their state for many years&#59; and when they appear again upon the
                field of his&#8211; tory&#44; what do their annals present&#44; but dissension
                within and sorrows from without&#63; Under the tute&#8211; lage of the Persians and
                Egyptians they were not in&#8211; dependent&#59; when they came under the dominion
                of the Syrians&#44; they groaned under the most intolerable oppressions&#44; until
                from mere desperation&#44; seeing that their religion was contemned&#44; and death
                was prefer&#8211; able to life&#44; they rose under the guidance of the brave
                Maccabees&#44; and drove their tyrants from their soil. But even after this&#44;
                they were but a feeble kingdom&#59; and their internal feuds induced them at length
                to submit their quarrel to the arbitration of the gener&#8211; als of the Roman
                armies&#44; who in their triumphant career had carried the eagle&#8211;banners of
                their republic to the banks of the Euphrates. And when&#44; by de&#8211; grees&#44;
                Judsea had become a province of Rome&#44; and its princes were simply the vassals of
                the emperors who had succeeded the republic&#44; oppression again taught the Jews to
                seek for refuge in a successful rebellion&#44; or to sink with the sword in their
                hands amidst the ruins of their cherished country. Victory did not perch on our
                banners&#59; too much innocent blood had flowed in the streets of Jerusalem &#59;
                too violent had been the feuds between contending factions&#44; who each sheathed
                their swords in the bosom of their suffering country&#44; when it ought to have been
                turned alone against the enemies who thundered at their gates &#59; too much hatred
                dwelled in the hearts of brothers <pb n="383"/> FULFILMENT OF PROPHECY. 383 against
                those of their own faith and kin &#58; and the Lord permitted the legions who had
                overthrown so many states to triumph too over his sacred heritage&#44; and Jerusalem
                fell beneath their onslaught&#44; and the tem&#8211; ple sunk under the repeated
                blows of their battering&#8211; rams. And those&#44; who had stood undaunted on the
                last day of their country&#44; who did not yield whilst they had a rampart to fight
                for&#44; and a temple for which to shed their blood&#44; had to grace the triumph of
                their merciless conqueror&#44; and the few who had escaped were driven forth into
                every land&#44; to bear their iniquity and the weight of the destiny of Israel in
                the farthest ends of the earth. Where was here the gathering which Moses had
                foretold &#63; where that glorious destiny for which we had ever sighed as the goal
                of all our hopes&#63; &#8212; How deceptive would thus have been all that we had
                hoped for&#44; if the gathering under Ezra had been the accomplishment of what we
                had been promised by so many holy men&#44; from the rise of our nation till its
                dismemberment in the destruction of the house built by Solomon &#59; and far better
                had it been&#44; if this had been all we had a right to expect&#44; that we had
                remained in Babylon&#44; and not been diminished by. the constant wars to which we
                were subject during a second sojourn in the prom&#8211; ised land. To us&#44;
                however&#44; who look upon the restoration from Babylon as a mere phase in our
                history&#44; as a special fulfilment of a portion only of the prophecies&#44; whilst
                many of them await yet their accomplishment at a future day&#44; it is a highly
                important event&#44; which has been extremely beneficial in its results upon the

                spirit&#8211; ual state of existence. True&#44; the bearers of the standard of
                revelation suffered fearfully in the ser&#8211; vice which they have rendered to the
                world&#59; for&#44; while they benefitted the multitude&#44; they have endured the
                scorn and insults of those for whom they laboured&#59; but glorious and blissful is
                their lot&#44; notwithstanding the multitude of the sorrows to which they have been
                exposed. If we look with care in the pages of Holy Writ&#44; we will discover that
                worldly ease and the friendship of the gentiles were not promised to the sons of
                Abraham during the state of warfare through which they are to pass to the glorious
                end &#59; but that the very enmity of the world&#44; which the experience of history
                has proved to be our lot&#44; was to be the natural result of the state of
                separation which the whole scope of our religion has established between us and the
                rest of mankind in its unconverted state. Still&#44; who can doubt the gradual
                progress of the hu&#8211; man race &#63; Look upon what mankind are now&#44;
                com&#8211; pared with what they were in the most palmy days of Chaldean&#44;
                Grecian&#44; and Roman civilization&#59; and then seek to find through whose means
                the changes we thus witness have been brought about &#58; and you will discover that
                men&#44; who spoke and taught in a spirit borrowed from our Bible&#44; have
                commenced the revolutions in the mode of thinking of the sons of man&#44; which will
                not cease in their action till the whole world will have received light and
                knowledge of the word of God. For let their followers conceal it as they will&#44;
                the teachings of the man of Nazareth and of the pretended prophet of Mecca are based
                upon a knowledge of things springing from the word <pb n="385"/> FULFILMENT OF
                PROPHECY. 385 of God &#59; and though the systems of both are founded upon erroneous
                assumptions of a power which neither possessed&#44; we do not wish to deny that both
                Naza&#8211; renes and Mahomedans are immeasurably far in ad&#8211; vance in morals
                and enlightenment in divine things of those gentiles&#44; who yet adhere to the
                various sys&#8211; tems of heathen idolatry. &#34;We cannot be far wrong in
                maintaining&#44; that the more intimate intercourse which the Israelites of the
                second temple had with the neighbouring nations&#44; together with the
                transla&#8211; tion of the law and other portions of Scripture into the Greek
                language&#44; must have tended to diffuse a general knowledge of the principles of
                revelation among the gentiles&#44; who lived in the vicinity of Pal&#8211;
                estine&#44; who then&#44; by degrees&#44; carried their influence among those
                nations even who had not come in direct intercourse with the Jews. In this way it
                was&#44; we may assume&#44; that the restoration under Ezra was an event of vital
                importance both to the Jews&#44; the first objects of the same&#44; and the world at
                large&#44; if even we do not claim the origin of modern civilization as traceable to
                this event. We may therefore say&#44; that the glory of the second house was in this
                respect greater than that of the first&#44; especially as the Jews never relapsed
                into idolatry during its continuance&#44; whilst their light was by degrees diffused
                over every country which is blessed with the light of civiliza&#8211; tion. Though
                now the world is greatly improved in re&#8211; ligion and civilization&#44; no one
                will be bold enough to assert that we have reached the utmost limits of these great
                blessings. As little as Israel has reached the great destiny of which the prophets
                speak&#44; so imper&#8211; VOL. v. 33 <pb n="386"/> 386 FULFILMENT OF PROPHECY. feet
                is yet the remainder of mankind in the light and grace which are impending. With the
                restoration from Babylon&#44; as I said in the commencement of this address&#44; the
                prophets predicted still farther and greater benefits as in store for Israel&#59;
                but they connected them also with an increased light of piety and a knowl&#8211;
                edge of the Lord among the gentiles. And among others&#44; Zechariah spoke in the
                following words &#58; &#34; Sing and rejoice&#44; O daughter of Zion &#33; for&#44;
                behold I will come and dwell in the midst of thee&#44; saith the Lord. And many
                nations will join themselves unto the Lord&#44; and they shall be my people&#44; and
                I will dwell in the midst of thee&#44; and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts
                hath sent me to thee.&#34; Zech. ii. 14&#44; 15. In this prophecy a twofold
                prediction is presented to us&#44; the one&#44; the special dwelling of the holy
                Spirit among Israel&#44; the second the junction of many na&#8211; tions to the
                service of the Lord. It must be observed&#44; that this prophecy was pronounced
                after the building of the second temple&#44; consequently it speaks of a time
                subsequent to that event. Now it must be apparent to any one who inquires without
                prejudice&#44; that sub&#8211; sequent to Zechariah no event took place to mark more
                strongly the dwelling of God among Israel&#44; than it was during the prophet&#39;s
                lifetime. It follows therefore that&#44; if the prophecy was not fulfilled
                dur&#8211; ing the period of the second temple&#44; it must be ac&#8211; <pb n="387"

                Moreover&#44; it is coupled with a prediction that many gentiles are to embrace the
                religion of God&#44; and become his peo&#8211; ple in the manner Israelites are so
                designated&#44; whilst the Lord will still specially dwell among his own chosen
                servants. This also has not been fulfilled&#59; for as yet the descendants of Jacob
                are the only ones who walk in the law of God. &#8212; We are well aware that the
                gentiles claim their new religion as an ad&#8211; herence to the Lord&#44; and thus
                they allege the proph&#8211; ecy is fulfilled in them&#44; notwithstanding they are
                strangers to the observances contained in the Bible. But even thus&#44; the
                Scriptures cannot be said to have seen their fulfilment. For it says distinctly&#44;
                that the joining of the gentiles to the Lord shall not remove his glory from Israel
                &#59; the daughter of Zion is told to sing and rejoice&#44; for God is coming to
                dwell in her midst. If&#44; however&#44; we are to believe the Nazarenes&#44; their
                adoption as the people of God has worked our forfeiture of grace&#44; their
                acceptance has caused us to be rejected. But this assumption is flatly contra&#8211;
                dicted by the prophet &#59; God will dwell among us&#44; though the gentiles are
                accepted&#59; their salvation will be accompanied by our greater glory&#44; and when
                they are blessed&#44; we are to be blessed likewise. And how beautiful is this idea
                &#33; In our Father&#39;s mansion there is salvation for all the world &#59; no one
                will need to sorrow&#44; while others are happy &#59; while Israel is holy to the
                Lord&#44; the children of the stranger also will be called&#44; and they will become
                his people. And at this is the daughter of Zion to rejoice &#33; How long has she
                mourned in the gloom of affliction&#44; whilst the proud of the earth mocked at her
                sorrow&#44; whilst those who <pb n="388"/> 388 FULFILMENT OF PROPHECY. lived at ease
                bade her to bend her back&#44; that they might pass over her prostrate form &#33;
                Hah &#33; they mocked her as one forsaken&#44; they derided her as one wilfully
                blind&#44; as one pertinaciously clinging to error. But now a new light will dawn
                upon the world&#59; all will behold the truth as it is in Israel &#59; the light of
                the law will be diffused far and wide over all man&#8211; kind&#44; and these now
                will come and acknowledge that well has the daughter of Zion done her task&#44; that
                she has faithfully kept alive the sacred fire&#44; nobly guarded the precious gift
                of the Lord of all &#59; and now they will come to her temple where the glory
                dwells&#44; and worship there the Name which is holiest among the holy and fearful
                and adored forever&#59; and therefore will she rejoice&#44; because that they who
                formerly op&#8211; pressed her&#44; and thought her hopes were vain&#44; have now
                also come to Avorship where she worships&#44; and to adore the same great Being who
                is the King and God of Israel. Then will Judah dwell securely in the holy land&#44;
                Jerusalem will be the joy of all the earth &#59; all will acknowledge that the words
                of the prophets were indeed the truth spoken in the name of the Most High &#59; and
                then will the knowledge of the Lord fill every heart&#44; and truth and justice will
                abide on earth forever. And may we all behold that glorious day&#44; when everywhere
                the Lord will be adored&#44; and peace be the lot of mankind under the dominion of

                grating on the ear to be compelled to listen to such sympathizers&#44; who lament
                the victim and secretly applaud the tyrant&#44; because he opens in this manner a

                persons&#44; against whom these attempts were directed&#44; an easy prey to any
                argument which was urged upon the contested points at issue between us and the

                placed at school have been approached by their teachers and friends with appeals on
                religious subjects&#44; and they have been drawn to churches to hear doctrines laid
                down adverse to the Jewish belief. That in the latter instance parents have been
                greatly at fault for exposing their offspring to such dangerous influences&#59; that
                no plea of the necessity of a brilliant education&#44; not attainable at home&#44;
                can justify a father for putting his child away where his principles may&#44;
                or&#44; to speak more correctly&#44; will surely be endangered &#59; that no mother
                can ever claim any circumstance likely to occur in ordinary life as an excuse for
                depriving her daughter of maternal care and supervision&#44; at the period when
                impressions are most readily received&#44; and when they are but too well calculated

                that&#44; in short&#44; the greatest blame is attachable to parents of every degree
                and station for leaving their offspring to imbibe such religious sentiments as
                cir&#8211; cumstances may throw in their way&#44; &#8212; is too
                self&#8211;evi&#8211; dent to require any argument. But equally culpable with the
                negligent parents are all those&#44; who do not apply all the means&#44; which their
                talents or circum&#8211; stances afford them&#44; to enlighten the understanding of

                tiles among whom we live understand&#44; or rather prac&#8211; tise better&#44; the
                exercise of wholesome influence. If they see one of their people doing what they
                deem an offence against their system&#44; they endeavour to alarm his conscience
                &#59; and though we may not alto&#8211; gether approve of the means resorted to&#44;
                we must acknowledge that they leave nothing untried to im&#8211; press all their
                members with their supposed duties. This office is not alone exercised by those who
                are appointed public teachers&#44; but by many others&#44; fe&#8211; males for
                instance&#44; who never expect to be other than mere humble and uninfluential

                they can have any influence over persons not of their persuasion&#44; for
                instance&#44; to induce them to read a particular book on some doctrinal
                question&#44; or to listen to a sermon of some powerful controversial preacher&#44;
                or to witness some exhibition where a strong evidence of the effect of their system
                can be displayed &#58; you will see them anxious and ready to improve the
                opportunity&#44; after their own fashion&#44; and endeavouring to say a word in
                season&#44; which is more or less effective&#44; especially with the weak and

                we cannot afford to lose even such as these from our communion&#44; though their
                adherence add ever so little strength to our cause. They are children of Israel as
                much as the strongest of us&#44; and are bound by the same law as the wisest among

                withstand the appeals of the gentiles&#44; and become themselves de&#8211; fenders
                of the holy truths that are intrusted to us in the law. If they are weak and
                worldly&#44; draw them to you by mild persuasion&#44; and by those unceasing efforts
                of an untiring love&#44; which deems no labour too great&#44; no exertion too
                painful&#44; which may by any de&#8211; gree of possibility confirm the
                wavering&#44; and bring healing to a soul affected with the dangerous imbe&#8211;
                cility which knows not its own diseased state. Let us not deceive ourselves that
                nothing can be clone. This woful delusion has been the cause of several families
                having quitted the household of Israel&#59; not because they were convinced of the
                truth of gentile doctrines&#44; but simply because they had no intercourse with
                religious Israelites&#44; and because their mind was absolutely uninformed of the
                ideas and duties which characterize us from other nations. Besides which
                considerations it must not be forgotten that&#44; so far as the moral effects of
                such conversions extend&#44; they are to the world at large almost as fatal&#44; as
                if they took place among the really prominent members of our faith&#59; and the
                triumph of those who bear no love for our race is equally great&#44; though the
                changeling be one of the weakest and most worthless among us. By these means&#44;
                also&#44; family relations are&#44; or should be interrupted &#59; for I esteem it
                to be beneath the dig&#8211; nity of a sincere Israelite to hold any intercourse
                with an apostate who openly so declares himself. Let us consider that we do not seek
                to make prose&#8211; lytes ourselves&#44; though for my own part&#44; and I say it
                    <pb n="399"/> THE DANGERS AND DEFENCES OP JUDAISM. 399 with due deference to the
                opinions of wiser and bet&#8211; ter men than myself&#44; I cannot see any good
                reason for being opposed to receiving them if the sincerity of their pro&#8211;
                fessions cannot be reasonably doubted&#44; as some of our people&#44; nay the
                greater majority of them&#44; are. At all events&#44; though there can be no doubt
                that&#44; if we resorted to the means gentiles employ&#44; we could make large
                accessions to our numbers&#44; it has become the settled policy of our brothers to
                rejeet even those who occasionally come forward of their own accord to claim a
                reception in the family of Jacob. It is evident&#44; therefore&#44; that we must
                decrease&#44; if we do not take care that the influence from without do not rob us
                of a portion of our household&#59; and it is also perfectly clear that too many&#44;
                especially in this coun&#8211; try&#44; have formerly been left exposed to a
                corrupting influence strong enough to warp the judgment&#44; if not equal to debase
                the reason &#40;I speak in a religious sense&#41; altogether. I fear that if we take
                a calm review of all the incidents in our own lives&#44; I except not even
                myself&#44; we may find some cause for self&#8211;accusation in not having been
                zealous enough in spreading the kingdom of Heaven&#44; and preventing sin&#44; when
                this was in our power. I will confess that apostacies are not so frequent&#44; nor
                have those we heard of been of such a kind&#44; that human means could in every case
                have prevented them &#59; but I speak also of other grave transgressions&#44; and
                therein I maintain we have&#44; not exerted our influence&#44; nor borne a decided
                enough testimony to awaken and alarm the sinner. Let us take counsel from the
                gentiles &#59; we can easily avoid their obtrusiveness &#59; there is no occasion to

                opportunities&#44; when we mingle in society&#44; to say or do something which will
                have a bearing upon our religion and the duties it enjoins. There is no demand for
                fanaticism&#44; nor need we fear being ridiculed for our zeal. Perfect cheerfulness
                and appreciation of social pleasures can be combined with our serious
                conversation&#59; and even in a jesting mood instruction may be conveyed the more
                striking&#44; from the unexpected manner in which it has been uttered. But chiefly
                we must endeavour to place our younger branches under wholesome re&#8211; ligious
                guidance&#44; not to compel them to transgress by leaving them in situations where
                to live religiously is impracticable. I know well enough that I shall be met with
                the objection&#44; that in some places it is impossible for pa&#8211; rents to
                educate their children commensurately with their wealth and standing&#59; that their
                sons have no colleges to go to in their native towns&#44; and that their daughters
                cannot obtain a sufficient knowledge of music&#44; painting&#44; the elegant
                sciences and modern and learned languages in their places of residence&#44; distant
                from the centres of literature and refinement&#59; and I shall be asked&#44; &#34;
                Are we to sacrifice the education of our children to the ceremonial observances of
                our re&#8211; ligion &#63;&#34; I would answer &#34; decidedly&#44;&#34; if religion
                or science must be sacrificed&#44; I say&#44; sacrifice science&#59; it is not the
                staff of life&#44; much as it may embellish it. But there is no occasion to dread
                such an alternative. As far as my knowledge goes&#44; there are high&#8211;schools
                of great distinction in all the larger towns of this country&#44; where Jews are
                settled in considerable bodies&#44; and in these both male and female children could
                be <pb n="401"/> THE DANGERS AND DEFENCES OF JUDAISM. 401 educated&#44; whilst they
                are&#44; at the same time&#44; domesti&#8211; cated with Jewish families&#44; even
                if there are no Jew&#8211; ish schools at which the children can be placed at once
                under the superintendence of the teachers them&#8211; selves&#44; for their mental
                as well as scientific cultivation. This much to parents who themselves practise in
                their houses the duties of their faith. But even to those who are indifferent in
                this great point&#44; great we call it&#44; for it was made the distinguishing mark
                between Israel and the other nations&#44; we would urge this con&#8211; sideration
                &#58; At home your children&#44; it is true&#44; do not live according to the law of

                you at stated periods to the house of God. All therefore is not lost&#44; though a
                great defect does exist. But now you are going to send your son to a distant
                college&#44; where the regulations of the school compel him to listen habitually to
                prayers aud sermons propounded in the name of a belief more or less hostile to your
                own &#59; he is constantly plied with arguments&#44; even in the very
                class&#8211;books he uses&#44; to prove that what you believe is false and
                erroneous. It may be that he has learned something at home&#44; and will thus be

                non&#8211;observance of the Day of Atonement &#63; You see I leave out all minor

                per&#8211; haps has beauty and intellect. You are determined that she shall be
                brilliantly educated&#44; she must shine at all hazards&#59; and you place her at a
                fashionable boarding&#8211;school&#44; where the daughters of the great of the land
                receive their finishing education. You may accomplish your wish thus to introduce
                her into a more elegant circle than is found in your own house &#59; she associates
                with those whose habits are refined and whose intellect is cultivated &#59; she
                acquires in their society all the branches taught to the best families of the land
                &#59; but her soul remains dark to all noble im&#8211; pressions &#59; she has no
                moral guide&#44; her gentile teacher is not able to prove one &#59; and what she
                gains in ele&#8211; gance she loses in goodness of heart&#44; in truth and
                sincerity&#44; those bright ornaments of a virtuous female. But assume&#44; on the

                the simple unity of God will again find a response in her rebellious soul. There is
                one thing I have omitted&#44; and that is the excuse occasionally made that a
                country&#8211;education is so beneficial to youth&#44; especially the males&#44; as
                it re&#8211; moves them during their age of susceptibility from the dangerous moral
                tendencies of a city&#8211;life&#59; and as in most country college towns few or no
                Jews reside&#44; it is requisite of course to place them with gentile families or
                within the walls of the college. But there is a great fallacy in this excuse. If it
                were that a child&#44; after being once removed from the temptations of a
                city&#8211;life&#44; would never be exposed to them again&#44; the laziness of
                parents might find some palliation. But the fact is quite the reverse. The
                college&#8211;years are scarcely over&#44; when the rusticated citizen is thrown
                with an amazing suddenness in the midst of the dis&#8211; sipation&#44; which the
                large towns so abundantly furnish. He has been restrained for a long period&#44; and
                now he will compensate himself for the time lost to pleasure. Besides this&#44; it
                by no means follows that all country places are free from vice and allurement&#44;
                and it is much to be feared that in a moral point the country&#8211; is perhaps as
                corrupt as the city. But grant all in favour of the secluded village&#59; still&#44;
                as we have said&#44; the college&#8211;life must end at last&#59; and where is the
                safety of the candidate at his entrance into the great world&#63; Only in the

                is the danger &#63; It is in the want of moral training&#44; in the not instilling

                reflection. Consider&#44; then&#44; that Israel as a people requires a union of
                labourers&#44; who conjointly must aim to establish a holy sentiment of devotion in
                the hearts of all&#44; and to elevate our char&#8211; acter in the eyes of the

                want&#59; we need intelligent thinkers&#44; and faithful actors&#44; who can guide
                others and promote good by their example. Thus can we best exemplify that we are a
                holy people&#44; and thus can we show in our life how it could happen that&#44;
                despite of our dis&#8211; persion&#44; we have been able to maintain our identity
                amidst the nations which surround us on all sides. Let us prove that we esteem
                highly the announce&#8211; ment which God made to Moses &#58; &#34;And I will take
                you unto me for a people&#44; and I will be your God &#59; and you shall know that I

                whose every aspiration was suppressed under the heavy burdens which were laid upon
                us. But then the Lord became emphatically our God&#44; by giving us his law and
                separating us from all the world besides. Nations since have warred against our
                state&#44; overwhelmed our greatness&#59; but we have continued undiminished&#44;
                though always assailed. And now it is for us&#44; the men of the present
