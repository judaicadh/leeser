				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>St Thomas</placeName> <date>17th Augt. 1865</date></p>
				<p>My dear <addressee>Mr. Leeser</addressee></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">My brother&#39;s departure enables me to send<lb/> you amot for the doz Bibles and 4 Prayer Books had from you<lb/> last year.  As these Books sell very slowly&#44; I have requested<lb/> him that you may not be kept out of the money any longer&#44;<lb/> to pay you for them.  You have never let me know what the<lb/> set of Books for my nephew cost&#59; please do so and I will<lb/> remit the same <sic>p</sic> first opportunity.  <persName>Osorio Wright &#38; Co</persName> handed<lb/> me last <date>Septr</date> 49 Roads to Faith&#44; for which I settled with my<lb/> brother&#44; and he with you.  there still remain unsold from that<lb/> shipment 6 <persName>Dias&#39;<sic>s</sic></persName> letters 6 Bible texts&#44; 7 select sentences&#44; 24<lb/> Scriptural Questions &#38; 12 Catechisms for younger children.<lb/>  The Books <sic>p</sic> Responsible are still on hand&#44; in very bad<lb/> condition&#44; having been damaged by salt&#45;water.  So much<lb/> for business.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">My brother will give you all the news about myself.<lb/>  He will tell you of the discomforts and uncertain nature<lb/> of the situation I hold&#44; and the growing incapability of this<lb/> congregation&#44; owing to the adverse condition of trade&#44; to<lb/> maintain a minister.  My life is embittered by the petty<lb/> quarrels&#44; which groundlessly&#44; are fomented by the various</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>cliques into which this little community is split&#44; and<lb/> of which I am made the scape&#45;goat and victim.  When<lb/> there is no minister&#44; they mangle among themselves&#44;<lb/> and when there is one&#44; they unite and land themselves<lb/> against him.  I challenge the wisest and best&#45;tempered<lb/> man to live with them in harmony and concord.<lb/>  The are unsociable and mean beyond description.<lb/>  Were it not that my experience of them in years gone<lb/> by determined me to make a contract so stringent<lb/> and binding that they could not break through&#44; they<lb/> would ere this have sent me to the right about.  And<lb/> this angers them.  Those who were opposed to having a<lb/> minister&#44; and those who were favorable thereto&#44; being now<lb/> united in sentiment against the unfortunate individual<lb/> holding that office.  Individually and collectively<lb/> they urge nothing against me personally&#44; for I do my<lb/> duty in and out of Synagogue punctiliously&#44; but the<lb/> taxes for the payment of my salary fall heavily&#44; and<lb/> they feel that I am a <sic>burthen</sic>&#44; and a drain on their<lb/> pockets.  I have offended one man&#44; my chief supporter<lb/> and friend before and after my coming&#44; because I refused<lb/> to accommodate myself to his <add>&#63;</add> and caprices&#44; and<lb/> to the friend of <hi rend="underline">his</hi> friends&#44; and the enemy of <hi rend="underline">his</hi> enemies.<lb/>  he has loaded me with gross abuse and insult</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>got up cabals against me&#44; without the least cause&#44;<lb/> except that I am friendly with one of the leading men<lb/> of the congregation&#44; when the mortally hated His family&#44;<lb/> even his wife and children condemn his conduct&#44; so<lb/> do his relatives and friends&#44; but his commercial standing<lb/> enables him to have a <hi rend="underline">tail</hi> of <sic>mischeivous</sic> people&#44; who<lb/> to flatter him and obtain favors&#44; circulate his <add>Hebrew</add>.<lb/>  The way public worship is carried on would&#44; in any<lb/> other congregation&#44; be considered excellent&#59; and leave nothing<lb/> to be desired.  Young and old members who have been lately<lb/> in <placeName>Europe</placeName> found it superior to what they witnessed there<lb/> and give it the preference.  Only <placeName>Marks&#39;<sic>s</sic></placeName> Synagogue <del>was</del> is<lb/> thought by some superior.  If the prayers were somewhat<lb/> curtailed&#44; and a better mode of chaunting introduced&#44;<lb/> no fault could be found.  You will think these are<lb/> easy of adoption.  Not so mon cher&#44; the slightest attempt<lb/> at change would sur le champ cause rows and<lb/> disturbances.  A new element of mischief has recently<lb/> appeared.  The notorious <persName>Mr. M B Simmonds</persName>&#44; now<lb/> a disciple of <persName>Colento</persName>&#44; declines his unbelief in the Jewish<lb/> scripture&#44; avows himself a <hi rend="underline">Unitarian</hi>&#44; not in the<lb/> Christian meaning of the word&#44; but what you and I<lb/> and others would call a Deist&#44; and gave a proof<lb/> of his being one&#44; by refusing lately in a court of justice&#44;</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>to be sworn on the Hebrew Bible&#44; alleging&#44; when asked by<lb/> the Judge what he was&#44; that he believed in God.  The dark<lb/> depravity of the man was subsequently brought to light&#59;<lb/> for the <del>man</del> party <hi rend="underline">against</hi> whom he gave evidence proved from<lb/> <persName>Simmonds&#39;<sic>s</sic></persName> own account books&#44; written by himself&#44; that<lb/> he was a perjurer and had given false testimony&#44; as those<lb/> books negatived the whole of his deposition.  He has<lb/> many followers&#59; and now he refuses to pay his Synagogue<lb/> quota&#44; assigning before the court that he is no longer<lb/> a Jew.  What the Government will decide is yet unknown.<lb/>  If the sentence be unfavorable to the Synagogue&#44; then<lb/> many will follow suit and as they will consist of the<lb/> largest contributing members&#44; you can conceive what my<lb/> position will be worth.  Looking at it in the most favor&#45;<lb/>able point of view&#44; my tenure of office cannot&#44; under<lb/> all these circumstances&#44; be my lasting.  Nevertheless<lb/> I shall hold on&#44; pursue the even tenor of my way&#44; and<lb/> calmly await the issue&#44; in full reliance on His <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>.  As the congregation sought me and not<lb/> I them&#44; and induced me to resign greater pecuniary benefit<lb/> than they offered me&#59; it would be injustice on their part<lb/> to turn me adrift if they could&#44; and as my contract<lb/> cannot be violated by them so summarily&#44; I imagine it<lb/> will terminate in some compromise.  I furnish you</p>
			<pb n="5"/>
				<p>with this general outline&#44; leaving my brother to fill up<lb/> the picture&#44; that you may form just conclusions on<lb/> the subject&#44; and defend me from misrepresentation&#44;<lb/> as becomes a friend&#44; should I be attacked.  I do not<lb/> wish to appear before the public in print under such mortifying<lb/> and unpleasant circumstances&#44; and will not&#44; unless it be a<lb/> dernier ressort to protect my name and character.  It<lb/> is not improbable we may see one another again face<lb/> to face&#44; for as I see no fixity here&#44; and will have to look<lb/> for bread elsewhere&#44; the <placeName>states</placeName> will be the most likely<lb/> place to pitch my tent.  I seriously thought that <placeName>St.<lb/> Thomas</placeName> would be my resting place.  I have been deceived&#44;<lb/> tho&#39; doubtlessly my removal therefrom will have been ordained<lb/> for the best.  My constitution is stronger &#40;JG&#41; than ever<lb/> it was&#44; and a cold climate may brace it&#44; and fit me<lb/> for continuance of labor.  The principal thing I seek<lb/> is peace&#59; here I am not certain of it for a day&#44; or rather<lb/> a day&#39;s peace is an unusual occurrence.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Where is <persName>Gutheim</persName>&#63;  I hope in his old place in <placeName>N&#47;O.</placeName><lb/>  From the Occident I learn of <persName>H S. Jacobs&#39;<sic>s</sic></persName> welfare.<lb/>  <persName>J. P. Benjamin</persName> left here for <placeName>Europe</placeName> yesterday in the<lb/> B. S. Seine.  I had a long conversation with him before</p>
			<pb n="6"/>
				<p>his departure.  He told me in a general way of his<lb/> many hair&#45;breadth escapes in disguises thro&#39; <placeName>Georgia</placeName><lb/> and <placeName>Florida</placeName>.  He made his way <add>&#63;</add> in an open<lb/> boat&#44; navigated by two men&#44; to <placeName>Cuba</placeName>&#44; whence he came<lb/> to <placeName>St. Thomas</placeName>.  <persName>Gels Walker</persName> and <persName>Preston</persName> were with him.<lb/>  From the date of his leaving <placeName>Richmond</placeName> till his arrival<lb/> at <placeName>Havannah</placeName>&#44; over 4 months&#44; his life he said was a<lb/> blank&#44; in so far as his knowledge of events during that<lb/> time was concerned.  <persName>Genl. Breckenridge</persName> sailed<lb/> from here <del>two</del> a month previously.  From him we<lb/> learnt that <persName>Wm. Benjamin</persName> was then in <placeName>Florida</placeName>.<lb/>  <del>At</del> When <persName>Jefferson Davis</persName> was captured&#44; they were<lb/> only 40 miles in advance&#44; and therefore had a narrow<lb/> escape.  One old register Book of births gives <del>the</del><lb/> <del>date of</del> <persName>Benjamin&#39;s</persName> age.  He was born in <placeName>St. Croix</placeName> on the<lb/> <date>6th August 1811</date> and circumcised by <persName>Judah Benjamin</persName>&#44;<lb/> an uncle&#44; I suppose.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">My letter is full enough in all conscience&#44; and<lb/> so you will no doubt think it.  I perceive you<lb/> are proceeding in your usual useful career&#44; and<lb/> read with much interest the transactions of your<lb/> American Board of Jewish Deputies&#44; yourself in<lb/> the chair.  What think you of 6 Israelites out of<lb/> a population of little more than 40&#44;000 being returned</p>
			<pb n="7"/>
				<p>as members to the British Parliament whilst in<lb/> the states&#44; with superior advantages&#44; without a junction<lb/> of Church and State&#44; our brethren are so much in<lb/> the back&#45;ground.  And then these men&#44; one and<lb/> all&#44; do not hold themselves aloof from commercial<lb/> interests&#44; but take an active stand in them.  Witness<lb/> the magnificent collection of &#163;10&#44;000 lately in aid<lb/> of the <placeName>London</placeName> Jews Free School&#44; and the princely contribu<lb/>tions to synagogues&#44; charities&#44; and schools.  Both the<lb/> <persName>Barons Rothschild</persName>&#44; <persName>Alderman Salomons</persName>&#44; <persName>Sir Francis<lb/> Goldsmid</persName> and his brother&#44; and <persName>Baron Lionel&#39;s</persName> son<lb/> are all foremost in devotion to the welfare of their<lb/> people.  They are not Jews in name&#44; but live Kosher&#44;<lb/> and are in their places at synagogue as well as in<lb/> the Counting House.  I hear however &#44;that <persName>Baron Lionel</persName><lb/> is paralytic&#44; but hope it is not true.  <persName>Professor<lb/> Sylvester</persName> who has solved what <persName>Newton</persName> left<lb/> improved&#44; was once a pupil of mine&#59; I taught him<lb/> Hebrew in <placeName>Liverpool</placeName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Good bye&#59; <persName>Mrs. Nathan</persName>&#44; <persName>Mrs. Samson</persName>&#44; &#38; <persName>David</persName><lb/> join me in best wishes&#44; and hoping that your<lb/> health is robust&#44; and that you will make my<lb/> brother&#39;s residence in your city agreeable&#44; I am</p>
