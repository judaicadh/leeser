            <p>My dear <addressee>Mr. Leeser</addressee></p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">My brother's departure enables me to send<lb/> you amot for the doz
                Bibles and 4 Prayer Books had from you<lb/> last year. As these Books sell very
                slowly, I have requested<lb/> him that you may not be kept out of the money any
                longer,<lb/> to pay you for them. You have never let me know what the<lb/> set of
                Books for my nephew cost; please do so and I will<lb/> remit the same <sic>p</sic>
                first opportunity. <persName>Osorio Wright &amp; Co</persName> handed<lb/> me last
                    <date>Septr</date> 49 Roads to Faith, for which I settled with my<lb/> brother,
                and he with you. there still remain unsold from that<lb/> shipment 6
                        <persName>Dias'<sic>s</sic></persName> letters 6 Bible texts, 7 select
                sentences, 24<lb/> Scriptural Questions &amp; 12 Catechisms for younger
                children.<lb/> The Books <sic>p</sic> Responsible are still on hand, in very
                bad<lb/> condition, having been damaged by salt-water. So much<lb/> for
                business.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">My brother will give you all the news about myself.<lb/> He will
                tell you of the discomforts and uncertain nature<lb/> of the situation I hold, and
                the growing incapability of this<lb/> congregation, owing to the adverse condition
                of trade, to<lb/> maintain a minister. My life is embittered by the petty<lb/>
                quarrels, which groundlessly, are fomented by the various</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>cliques into which this little community is split, and<lb/> of which I am made the
                scape-goat and victim. When<lb/> there is no minister, they mangle among
                themselves,<lb/> and when there is one, they unite and land themselves<lb/> against
                him. I challenge the wisest and best-tempered<lb/> man to live with them in harmony
                and concord.<lb/> The are unsociable and mean beyond description.<lb/> Were it not
                that my experience of them in years gone<lb/> by determined me to make a contract so
                stringent<lb/> and binding that they could not break through, they<lb/> would ere
                this have sent me to the right about. And<lb/> this angers them. Those who were
                opposed to having a<lb/> minister, and those who were favorable thereto, being
                now<lb/> united in sentiment against the unfortunate individual<lb/> holding that
                office. Individually and collectively<lb/> they urge nothing against me personally,
                for I do my<lb/> duty in and out of Synagogue punctiliously, but the<lb/> taxes for
                the payment of my salary fall heavily, and<lb/> they feel that I am a
                    <sic>burthen</sic>, and a drain on their<lb/> pockets. I have offended one man,
                my chief supporter<lb/> and friend before and after my coming, because I
                refused<lb/> to accommodate myself to his <add>?</add> and caprices, and<lb/> to the
                friend of <hi rend="underline">his</hi> friends, and the enemy of <hi
                    rend="underline">his</hi> enemies.<lb/> he has loaded me with gross abuse and
                insult</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>got up cabals against me, without the least cause,<lb/> except that I am friendly
                with one of the leading men<lb/> of the congregation, when the mortally hated His
                family,<lb/> even his wife and children condemn his conduct, so<lb/> do his
                relatives and friends, but his commercial standing<lb/> enables him to have a <hi
                    rend="underline">tail</hi> of <sic>mischeivous</sic> people, who<lb/> to flatter
                him and obtain favors, circulate his <add>דבות רעות</add>.<lb/> The way public
                worship is carried on would, in any<lb/> other congregation, be considered
                excellent; and leave nothing<lb/> to be desired. Young and old members who have been
                lately<lb/> in <placeName>Europe</placeName> found it superior to what they
                witnessed there<lb/> and give it the preference. Only
                    <placeName>Marks'<sic>s</sic></placeName> Synagogue <del>was</del> is<lb/>
                thought by some superior. If the prayers were somewhat<lb/> curtailed, and a better
                mode of chaunting introduced,<lb/> no fault could be found. You will think these
                are<lb/> easy of adoption. Not so mon cher, the slightest attempt<lb/> at change
                would sur le champ cause rows and<lb/> disturbances. A new element of mischief has
                recently<lb/> appeared. The notorious <persName>Mr. M B Simmonds</persName>,
                now<lb/> a disciple of <persName>Colento</persName>, declines his unbelief in the
                Jewish<lb/> scripture, avows himself a <hi rend="underline">Unitarian</hi>, not in
                the<lb/> Christian meaning of the word, but what you and I<lb/> and others would
                call a Deist, and gave a proof<lb/> of his being one, by refusing lately in a court
                of justice,</p>
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>to be sworn on the Hebrew Bible, alleging, when asked by<lb/> the Judge what he was,
                that he believed in God. The dark<lb/> depravity of the man was subsequently brought
                to light;<lb/> for the <del>man</del> party <hi rend="underline">against</hi> whom
                he gave evidence proved from<lb/>
                <persName>Simmonds'<sic>s</sic></persName> own account books, written by himself,
                that<lb/> he was a perjurer and had given false testimony, as those<lb/> books
                negatived the whole of his deposition. He has<lb/> many followers; and now he
                refuses to pay his Synagogue<lb/> quota, assigning before the court that he is no
                longer<lb/> a Jew. What the Government will decide is yet unknown.<lb/> If the
                sentence be unfavorable to the Synagogue, then<lb/> many will follow suit and as
                they will consist of the<lb/> largest contributing members, you can conceive what
                my<lb/> position will be worth. Looking at it in the most favor-<lb/>able point of
                view, my tenure of office cannot, under<lb/> all these circumstances, be my lasting.
                Nevertheless<lb/> I shall hold on, pursue the even tenor of my way, and<lb/> calmly
                await the issue, in full reliance on His <add>הרעה אתי מעודי עד היום הזה</add><lb/>
                <add>Hebrew</add>. As the congregation sought me and not<lb/> I them, and induced me
                to resign greater pecuniary benefit<lb/> than they offered me; it would be injustice
                on their part<lb/> to turn me adrift if they could, and as my contract<lb/> cannot
                be violated by them so summarily, I imagine it<lb/> will terminate in some
                compromise. I furnish you</p>
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>with this general outline, leaving my brother to fill up<lb/> the picture, that you
                may form just conclusions on<lb/> the subject, and defend me from
                misrepresentation,<lb/> as becomes a friend, should I be attacked. I do not<lb/>
                wish to appear before the public in print under such mortifying<lb/> and unpleasant
                circumstances, and will not, unless it be a<lb/> dernier ressort to protect my name
                and character. It<lb/> is not improbable we may see one another again face<lb/> to
                face, for as I see no fixity here, and will have to look<lb/> for bread elsewhere,
                the <placeName>states</placeName> will be the most likely<lb/> place to pitch my
                tent. I seriously thought that <placeName>St.<lb/> Thomas</placeName> would be my
                resting place. I have been deceived,<lb/> tho' doubtlessly my removal therefrom will
                have been ordained<lb/> for the best. My constitution is stronger (JG) than
                ever<lb/> it was, and a cold climate may brace it, and fit me<lb/> for continuance
                of labor. The principal thing I seek<lb/> is peace; here I am not certain of it for
                a day, or rather<lb/> a day's peace is an unusual occurrence.</p>
