			<p rend="indent(2)">My dear friend.</p>
			<p rend="indent(4)">Your friendly and consoling letters have<lb/> remained too long unanswered&#44; and the delay is not so much<lb/> attributable to want of time as to depression of spirit which grows<lb/> daily upon me from a variety of causes&#44; among which may be briefly<lb/> enumerated the state of my wife&#39;s health &#40;she is now a confirmed<lb/> invalid&#41; the unpromising state of my affairs&#44; and isolation from all<lb/> society.  It grieves me to write in so dolorous a strain&#44; and yet it is a<lb/> relief to unto<add>&#63;</add> myself to one who knew me in happier days&#44; and who<lb/> can sympathize in my distresses.  You have so much to endure that I<lb/> am almost ashamed to make your heart ache with the recital of my troubles.<lb/>  God&#39;s will be done&#33;  A wise&#44; merciful and loving Father watches over us&#59; He<lb/> knows what is good for us.  Therefore while acknowledging with fortitude<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>&#8212;my watchword in the conflict with the world and<lb/> adverse circumstances is <add>Hebrew</add>.  This upholds me&#59; and the<lb/> thought that if I suffer in this life&#44; there will be less to undergo hereafter<lb/> gives me cheerfulness in the darkest moments.</p>
				<p>I am truly thankful for your counsel&#44; and cheered by the hopes you hold out that I may<lb/> yet do something in the states should I determine on quitting this place.<lb/>  This year will solve the problem whether I remain or not.  My wife&#39;s<lb/> state of health will&#44; unless she can be cured in another country which I<lb/> doubt&#44; under her incapable of superintending a boarding school&#44; and a<lb/> daily one is&#44; with the <sic>accesibility</sic> of Jewish children to the American<lb/> schools&#44; free&#44; gratis&#44; for nothing&#44; out of question.  There remains then the<lb/> ancient precedent&#59; but our people have in the Psalmists words <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>.  Their ideas are that the Jewish ministry should be hierarchi&#45;<lb/>cal&#44; and even should any congregation satisfied with my antecedents<lb/> not object to engaging me&#44; my age&#44; for remember I am now <hi rend="underline">50</hi> might<lb/> be an obstacle.  I am also rusty from disuse&#44; having now been 4 years<lb/> away from the desk and pulpit.  A little hard study might again<lb/> revive my latent powers&#44; and sage experience and calm reasoning supply<lb/> the void caused by the loss of imagination&#44; which nevertheless delights<lb/> popular assemblies whether lay or clerical.  There is stuff in me yet.<lb/>  For the present&#44; however&#44; I must suspend all action&#59; but will let you</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>know as the time approaches for decision.  Meanwhile your warm<lb/> and affectionate interest in <persName>Mrs. N</persName> and me is a source of great<lb/> comfort in my tribulation <add>Hebrew</add>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Before quitting the subject of myself it is as well to tell you that my<lb/> duties have become onerous since the death of my brother in law.  His<lb/> mother is now under my care&#59; she has no living relative but her daughter&#44;<lb/> and should any thing happen to me&#44; neither of them has&#44; in this wide<lb/> world one <del>from</del> whom they could morally and socially claim as a<lb/> guardian or protector.  This country is <hi rend="underline">fallen</hi> and falling&#44; and I<lb/> apprehend&#44; should there be no amendment&#44; that numbers&#44; particularly of<lb/> one creed will quit.  I have also obligations to discharge to the orphans<lb/> and widow of the deceased&#59; and it is my earnest hope and constant<lb/> prayer that I may live to educate the former in a civilized and religious<lb/> community.  Having never been blessed with children&#44; how tranquil<lb/> and peaceful would be my last moments if&#44; after having trained these<lb/> dear ones in the ways of piety and holiness&#44; I could depart this world<lb/> with the consciousness of having done my utmost to discharge faithfully<lb/> the truth reposed in me.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Let me devote the remaining portion of the sheet to you.  You write<lb/> and think in a tone of dejection and almost bitterness which is<lb/> foreign to your heart as an Israelite&#44; to your feelings as a God&#45;fearing<lb/> God serving man.  As it always was and always will be till <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>&#59; each thinks his burden the heaviest.  Yours has not been light.<lb/>  Ill treatment&#44; malevolence and <add>&#63;</add> have spirited their renown<lb/> on your name and reputation.  Your sensitive spirit has winced under<lb/> the attacks of ignorance&#44; prejudice&#44; and jealousy.  You have manfully<lb/> fought and reasoned with your enemies&#59; have worked hard to remove<lb/> the injustice ascribed to your motives and actions&#44; sometimes successfully&#44;<lb/> most frequently not.  Envy has bela<add>&#63;</add> and will never cease to<lb/> buffet you.  It has cried and still exclaims as <persName>Korah</persName> spoke to<lb/> <persName>Moses</persName> &#38; <persName>Aaron</persName> <add>Hebrew</add> &#8220;You take too much upon you.&#8221;  For&#44; bear in mind&#44;<lb/> you have exposed abuses&#44; you have cried down irreligion&#44; you have<lb/> unveiled vicious practices in <add>Hebrew</add>.  I believe and ever shall that<lb/> singliness of heart prompted all you have spoken&#44; written and done.<lb/>  There are many who think with me in both Hemispheres and in the<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; In our opinion your detractors may rail&#44; congregations<lb/> both orthodox and reformed may turn a deaf ear to your suggestions&#44;</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>decry your efforts&#44; refuse your advice as a guide&#8212;but they cannot<lb/> gainsay<add>&#63;</add> the truth that for upwards of a quarter of a century you<lb/> have defended and instructed <placeName>Israel</placeName> on the wide field of the <placeName>United<lb/> States</placeName>&#44; that your sermons&#44; translations of Prayers and Bible&#44; Catechisms<lb/> &#38;c have enlightened old and young American Jews owe you a large<lb/> debt of gratitude.  But they won&#39;t acknowledge it say you.  &#8220;There&#39;s the<lb/> rub&#8221; Friend <persName>Leeser</persName>&#33;  Our people are eminently conservative.  They like<lb/> the old land <add>&#63;</add> when these are not in the way of their interests&#44; their<lb/> passion&#44; and worldly progress.  They can plead <sic>precidents</sic> derived from<lb/> Holy write for treating you as they do.  Their ancestors did the same to<lb/> Legislator and King and Prophet.  The character of <persName>Moses</persName> has outlived<lb/> the foul <sic>assersions</sic> of a <persName>Korah</persName>&#44; <persName>Datban</persName> &#38; <add>&#63;</add>&#59; <persName>David&#39;s</persName> memory is<lb/> now the worse for the rituperation<add>&#63;</add> of shrines&#44; nor is <persName>Jeremiah</persName> less venerated<lb/> for having been thrust in the stocks and dungeon.  You must bear<lb/> patiently for the score of years you may yet live Posterity will do<lb/> you justice&#44; and the name and fame of <persName>Isaac Leeser</persName> will be the<lb/> theme of a future Jewish historian.  It will rank you as the<lb/> hardy pioneer of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; whom no danger deterred&#44; no peril dismayed.<lb/>  I am a man as feeble in words as deficient in influence&#44; and<lb/> my <add>&#63;</add> cannot benefit you here or hereafter.  But <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> I most conscientiously and truly believe that you have insured<lb/> your reward already in another and a better world.  You may rest<lb/> on your <add>&#63;</add> without being chargeable with sloth and indolence if<lb/> your arms ache with toil&#59; and throw for the winds whatever may<lb/> tend to exasperate your heart and feelings.  After all this I write <add>Hebrew</add></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I have sold the copies of the Quarto Bible you sent me&#44; the morocco<lb/> bound small ones&#44; except I believe&#44; a single copy&#44; and one or two of<lb/> the others.  The money shall be collected and remitted you by next<lb/> steamer if possible.  I feel all the better after writing this<lb/> long <add>&#63;</add>.  The exercise has done me good the reading of it<lb/> may or may not pare a like effect in you&#44; especially my<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>.  Of one thing however be assured that I have not abated<lb/> one jot in my sincere feeling towards you&#44; nor my honest<lb/> appreciation of your merits.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The news of <persName>Jacob De la Motta&#39;s</persName> death gave me a great shock.<lb/>  He was only the acquaintance of a single day&#44; and yet I<lb/> esteemed him a friend. <placeName>Savannah</placeName> loses a good citizen</p>
				<p rend="The following is written sideways over the previous text on this page"></p>
				<p>and our people there one whom they could ill spare.  Our old Shammash<lb/> <persName>Joseph Joseph</persName> has gone to rest.  He had served the congregation in and<lb/> out of office for twenty five years.  His age was about 70</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I often entertain the desire of writing <persName>Miss Gratz</persName><lb/> but am uncertain whether I should do so after having ceased<lb/> corresponding for so many years.  Please remember me and<lb/> <persName>Mrs N</persName> affectionately to her and all inquiring friends.<lb/>  Long ere this you will have met with <persName>Mis Peixotto</persName><lb/> to whom name us kindly.  When will your new weekly<lb/> publication appear&#63;  I will try whether I cannot obtain<lb/> subscribers.  The Jewish Community here is rapidly<lb/> degenerating not a particle of <hi rend="underline">spirit</hi> about them&#59; tho&#39; the<lb/> sabbath continues to be observed by the Greater number<lb/> of the German Congregation.  The <persName>Revd Mr Davis</persName> is a good<lb/> Chazan&#44; and is improving in his sermons.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">May the almighty grant you health<lb/> happiness and prosperity always.</p>
			<p rend="indent(9)">Your friend and well wisher</p>
