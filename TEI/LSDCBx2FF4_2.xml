            <p rend="indent(2)">My dear friend.</p>
            <p rend="indent(4)">Your friendly and consoling letters have<lb/> remained too long
                unanswered, and the delay is not so much<lb/> attributable to want of time as to
                depression of spirit which grows<lb/> daily upon me from a variety of causes, among
                which may be briefly<lb/> enumerated the state of my wife's health (she is now a
                confirmed<lb/> invalid) the unpromising state of my affairs, and isolation from
                all<lb/> society. It grieves me to write in so dolorous a strain, and yet it is
                a<lb/> relief to unto<add>?</add> myself to one who knew me in happier days, and
                who<lb/> can sympathize in my distresses. You have so much to endure that I<lb/> am
                almost ashamed to make your heart ache with the recital of my troubles.<lb/> God's
                will be done! A wise, merciful and loving Father watches over us; He<lb/> knows what
                is good for us. Therefore while acknowledging with fortitude<lb/>
                <add>כי כל על פטרו אמת</add>—my watchword in the conflict with the world and<lb/>
                adverse circumstances is <add>קוה אל ה' חזק והאמון לבך</add>. This upholds me; and
                the<lb/> thought that if I suffer in this life, there will be less to undergo
                hereafter<lb/> gives me cheerfulness in the darkest moments.</p>
            <p>I am truly thankful for your counsel, and cheered by the hopes you hold out that I
                may<lb/> yet do something in the states should I determine on quitting this
                place.<lb/> This year will solve the problem whether I remain or not. My wife's<lb/>
                state of health will, unless she can be cured in another country which I<lb/> doubt,
                under her incapable of superintending a boarding school, and a<lb/> daily one is,
                with the <sic>accesibility</sic> of Jewish children to the American<lb/> schools,
                free, gratis, for nothing, out of question. There remains then the<lb/> ancient
                precedent; but our people have in the Psalmists words <add>ובלעדו א"א עליהם</add><lb/>
                <add>ויתערבו בגורם</add>. Their ideas are that the Jewish ministry should be
                hierarchi-<lb/>cal, and even should any congregation satisfied with my
                antecedents<lb/> not object to engaging me, my age, for remember I am now <hi
                    rend="underline">50</hi> might<lb/> be an obstacle. I am also rusty from disuse,
                having now been 4 years<lb/> away from the desk and pulpit. A little hard study
                might again<lb/> revive my latent powers, and sage experience and calm reasoning
                supply<lb/> the void caused by the loss of imagination, which nevertheless
                delights<lb/> popular assemblies whether lay or clerical. There is stuff in me
                yet.<lb/> For the present, however, I must suspend all action; but will let you</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>know as the time approaches for decision. Meanwhile your warm<lb/> and affectionate
                interest in <persName>Mrs. N</persName> and me is a source of great<lb/> comfort in
                my tribulation <add>טוב ריע מאח</add>.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Before quitting the subject of myself it is as well to tell you that
                my<lb/> duties have become onerous since the death of my brother in law. His<lb/>
                mother is now under my care; she has no living relative but her daughter,<lb/> and
                should any thing happen to me, neither of them has, in this wide<lb/> world one
                    <del>from</del> whom they could morally and socially claim as a<lb/> guardian or
                protector. This country is <hi rend="underline">fallen</hi> and falling, and I<lb/>
                apprehend, should there be no amendment, that numbers, particularly of<lb/> one

                to educate the former in a civilized and religious<lb/> community. Having never been
                blessed with children, how tranquil<lb/> and peaceful would be my last moments if,
                after having trained these<lb/> dear ones in the ways of piety and holiness, I could
