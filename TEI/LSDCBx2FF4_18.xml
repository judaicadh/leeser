				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>St. Louis&#44; Missouri</placeName>&#44; <date>March&#44; 19&#44; 1857</date>.</p>
				<p><addressee>Mr. Isaac Leeser</addressee> in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName></p>
				<p>Honored Sir&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">I am very thankful to you for your worthy letter of the <date>27th</date><lb/> of last month.  The only think I regret is not to be able to give a more<lb/> satisfactory answer.  According to my experience<del>s</del>&#44; you are about to give<lb/> up your undertakings which you have <sic>cinducted</sic> for a long time with love&#44;<lb/> commendable zeal&#44; and success.  What you are about to begin to do has<lb/> its bad side.  Jewish interests are too dear to the heart of such as we<lb/> to be given up after half a lifetime of labor for them.  If you were to<lb/> turn to political or other matters of the day&#44; you may be successful.<lb/>  You are perhaps particularly capable to edit a mixed newspaper in Eng&#45;<lb/>lish and German&#44; such as I have at one time hoped for and thought about.<lb/>  But in doing so you will have to undergo new and bigger struggles.  If<lb/> you were to turn to a completely new business you may have good success&#44;<lb/> at the same time feel a void which for you especially&#44; a man without a<lb/> family&#44; can never fill with any kind of financial success.  I have not<lb/> received your circular and have read it only  in the &#8220;<date>Shebat</date>&#8221; number &#40;<date>March</date>&#41;<lb/> of the &#8220;Occident&#8221;.  I went with it and with your letter to <persName>Mr. Nathan<lb/> Abeles</persName>.  I asked him whether he could not do something in the matter&#44;<lb/> since I myself am in touch with very few people&#44; and these German Jews.<lb/>  I told him that I would sign immediately after him if he were to open a<lb/> subscription list.  He&#44; too&#44; however&#44; explained to me that he does not<lb/> come in touch with any more and can do nothing in this matter.  He will<lb/> speak to the brothers <persName>Shloss</persName> &#40;<persName>Moses Shloss</persName> of <placeName>Albany</placeName>&#41;.  <persName>Mr. Lach</persName> is but<lb/> little in <placeName>St. Louis</placeName>.  He passed through.  As soon as he &#40;<persName>Abeles</persName>&#41; will see<lb/> him next&#44; he will tell him that he must be sure to come to me and I shall<lb/> talk with him on your behalf.  If you want to know my opinion&#44; I believe<lb/> that you should not turn the &#8220;Occident&#8221; into a monthly <hi rend="underline">and</hi> a weekly&#44; but<lb/> try to turn the monthly into a weekly which may procure 200 new subscri&#45;</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">2</p>
				<p>bers for the newspaper and no more.  Should you make the attempt&#44; please<lb/> send me per post a circular and prospectus&#44; and I shall myself procure<lb/> for you several subscribers and send you the cash.  The copy of <persName>Mr.<lb/> Michael de Young</persName> could not be found in the post office.  You yourself<lb/> should have thrown it among the thrash as soon as you learned of<lb/> their unwillingness to receive it.  Others of the numbers that I missed<lb/> I found in the letter&#45;box of <persName>Messrs. Abeles</persName> and <persName>Taussig</persName>&#44; in which I<lb/> find my mail.  You again receive herewith an order of <persName>Mr. Petschau</persName>&#44; for<lb/> the sending of several books&#44; out of my commission book shop.  These<lb/> are the books you seem to need.  I beg of you in my own and in your in&#45;<lb/>terest&#44; to take a hand in my claims upon <persName>de Young</persName> in <placeName>New York</placeName> and to<lb/> let me know what is advisable and what is possible to be done.</p>
			<p rend="indent(6)">With respect and friendship</p>
			<p rend="indent(7)">Devotedly yours&#44;</p>
