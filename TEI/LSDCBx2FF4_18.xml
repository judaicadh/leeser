                    1857</date>.</p>
            <p><addressee>Mr. Isaac Leeser</addressee> in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName></p>
            <p>Honored Sir:</p>
            <p rend="indent(2)">I am very thankful to you for your worthy letter of the
                    <date>27th</date><lb/> of last month. The only think I regret is not to be able
                to give a more<lb/> satisfactory answer. According to my experience<del>s</del>, you
                are about to give<lb/> up your undertakings which you have <sic>cinducted</sic> for
                a long time with love,<lb/> commendable zeal, and success. What you are about to
                begin to do has<lb/> its bad side. Jewish interests are too dear to the heart of
                such as we<lb/> to be given up after half a lifetime of labor for them. If you were
                to<lb/> turn to political or other matters of the day, you may be successful.<lb/>
                You are perhaps particularly capable to edit a mixed newspaper in Eng-<lb/>lish and
                German, such as I have at one time hoped for and thought about.<lb/> But in doing so
                you will have to undergo new and bigger struggles. If<lb/> you were to turn to a
                completely new business you may have good success,<lb/> at the same time feel a void
                which for you especially, a man without a<lb/> family, can never fill with any kind
                of financial success. I have not<lb/> received your circular and have read it only
                in the “<date>Shebat</date>” number (<date>March</date>)<lb/> of the “Occident”. I
                went with it and with your letter to <persName>Mr. Nathan<lb/> Abeles</persName>. I
                asked him whether he could not do something in the matter,<lb/> since I myself am in
                touch with very few people, and these German Jews.<lb/> I told him that I would sign
                immediately after him if he were to open a<lb/> subscription list. He, too, however,
                explained to me that he does not<lb/> come in touch with any more and can do nothing
                in this matter. He will<lb/> speak to the brothers <persName>Shloss</persName>
                    (<persName>Moses Shloss</persName> of <placeName>Albany</placeName>).
                    <persName>Mr. Lach</persName> is but<lb/> little in <placeName>St.
                    Louis</placeName>. He passed through. As soon as he
                (<persName>Abeles</persName>) will see<lb/> him next, he will tell him that he must
                be sure to come to me and I shall<lb/> talk with him on your behalf. If you want to
                know my opinion, I believe<lb/> that you should not turn the “Occident” into a
                monthly <hi rend="underline">and</hi> a weekly, but<lb/> try to turn the monthly
                into a weekly which may procure 200 new subscri-</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p rend="align(center)">2</p>
            <p>bers for the newspaper and no more. Should you make the attempt, please<lb/> send me
                per post a circular and prospectus, and I shall myself procure<lb/> for you several
                subscribers and send you the cash. The copy of <persName>Mr.<lb/> Michael de
                    Young</persName> could not be found in the post office. You yourself<lb/> should
                have thrown it among the thrash as soon as you learned of<lb/> their unwillingness
                to receive it. Others of the numbers that I missed<lb/> I found in the letter-box of
                    <persName>Messrs. Abeles</persName> and <persName>Taussig</persName>, in which
                I<lb/> find my mail. You again receive herewith an order of <persName>Mr.
                    Petschau</persName>, for<lb/> the sending of several books, out of my commission
                book shop. These<lb/> are the books you seem to need. I beg of you in my own and in
                your in-<lb/>terest, to take a hand in my claims upon <persName>de Young</persName>
                in <placeName>New York</placeName> and to<lb/> let me know what is advisable and
                what is possible to be done.</p>
