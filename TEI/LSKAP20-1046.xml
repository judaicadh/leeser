				<p>very perfect automation&#44; warranted to read&#44; speak or work&#44;<lb/> but not to feel.  What seek you in life for a resting place&#44;<lb/> when your mind takes a flight into the regions of the future&#63;<lb/>  Is it wealth&#63;  I hope you do not covet riches for their own<lb/> sake&#44; but if you would have them&#44; the proverb says&#44; &#34;take care of<lb/> the pence&#44; and the pounds will take care of themselves.&#34;<lb/>  Do you wish to acquire fame&#63;  Is it necessary to your happiness<lb/> that the voice of multitudes shall call you great&#63;  Why&#44; then&#44; strive<lb/> to <hi rend="underline">be</hi> great&#44; and that you mount to the heights which Ambition<lb/> occupies&#44; build your way up with little things&#44; so that you may<lb/> know every step which led you thither&#44; and thus&#44; when the oppor&#45;<lb/>tunity comes&#44; you may be able to answer to its calls&#44; &#34;ready&#63; aye<lb/> ready&#34;.  For instance&#44; if you are a student&#44; and it is to literature you<lb/> look for the means of becoming known&#44; you may look upon<lb/> a line read without your having seized its sense&#44; a thought passed<lb/> by without you having <del>seiz</del> followed it out&#44; as so many<lb/> delays to your advancement&#59; for even though you should<lb/> see no present use for the knowledge you acquire&#44; yet you<lb/> should be prepared for the time when it will be needed&#44; so<lb/> that you may at once take advantage of it.  Do you long for<lb/> kindness and friendship&#44; and love&#44; from those who<lb/> may chance to journey with you&#63;  Why&#44; then&#44; it rests with<lb/> you to have all these&#59; Smiles have always their reflections&#44;<lb/> and kind words and friendly deeds&#44; are sure to reproduce<lb/> themselves.  Are you&#44; my friend&#44; subject to fits of melancholy <del>the blues</del>&#44; &#34;when<lb/> you feel angry with yourself and every one else&#44; and are almost<lb/> determined that it is of no use trying to live&#44; in such an ill&#45;<lb/>natured world&#63;  Just walk into the street&#44; where you may chance<lb/> to see some living assertion that there is some good left&#59; or look</p>
			<pb n="1V"/>
				<p>into some good book&#44; where you may see that others have felt as you<lb/> do&#44; and have found comfort in looking out from the contemplation of<lb/> their own real or imaginary causes of complaint&#44; into some of the pleasant<lb/> aisles which open up through the wilderness of life&#44; and have found upon<lb/> nearer approach&#44; that there are indeed but few spots so dark&#44; that no<lb/> sun beam has found its way through them to warm into life&#44; some flower<lb/> or blade of grass.  A word&#44; a thought&#44; a kind smile&#44; a noble im&#45;<lb/>pulse&#44; a friendly action&#44; things in themselves &#34;trifles light as air&#44;&#34;<lb/> seem then to me&#44; to bear the same relation to great things&#44; as the<lb/> Alphabet to language&#59; and when I see men listening with<lb/> admiration when events announce themselves with the sound<lb/> of the trumpet&#44; while they disregard &#34;the still&#44; small voice&#59;&#34; I long<lb/> to remind them of the answer of that clergyman&#59; who&#44; being<lb/> asked&#44; how he comes to alter his manner&#44; from the loud&#44; ranting<lb/> style he had formerly used&#44; replied&#44; &#34;When I was young&#44; I used<lb/> to think that it was the thunder which killed the people&#44; but<lb/> as I grew older&#44; I found that it was the lightning&#59; So I resolved<lb/> to <hi rend="underline">thunder less and lighten more</hi>&#34;.  One more illustration&#44;<lb/> the cackling of a goose saved <placeName>Rome</placeName>&#59; and though you should<lb/> smilingly declare this effusion to be something upon the same order&#44;<lb/> I will not complain&#44; if I shall have reminded you&#44; that it would<lb/> be wise to &#34;Despise not the day of small things.&#34;</p>
