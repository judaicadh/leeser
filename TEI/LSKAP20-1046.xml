            <p>very perfect automation, warranted to read, speak or work,<lb/> but not to feel. What
                seek you in life for a resting place,<lb/> when your mind takes a flight into the
                regions of the future?<lb/> Is it wealth? I hope you do not covet riches for their
                own<lb/> sake, but if you would have them, the proverb says, "take care of<lb/> the
                pence, and the pounds will take care of themselves."<lb/> Do you wish to acquire
                fame? Is it necessary to your happiness<lb/> that the voice of multitudes shall call
                you great? Why, then, strive<lb/> to <hi rend="underline">be</hi> great, and that
                you mount to the heights which Ambition<lb/> occupies, build your way up with little
                things, so that you may<lb/> know every step which led you thither, and thus, when
                the oppor-<lb/>tunity comes, you may be able to answer to its calls, "ready?
                aye<lb/> ready". For instance, if you are a student, and it is to literature
                you<lb/> look for the means of becoming known, you may look upon<lb/> a line read
                without your having seized its sense, a thought passed<lb/> by without you having
                    <del>seiz</del> followed it out, as so many<lb/> delays to your advancement; for
                even though you should<lb/> see no present use for the knowledge you acquire, yet
                you<lb/> should be prepared for the time when it will be needed, so<lb/> that you
                may at once take advantage of it. Do you long for<lb/> kindness and friendship, and
                love, from those who<lb/> may chance to journey with you? Why, then, it rests
                with<lb/> you to have all these; Smiles have always their reflections,<lb/> and kind
                words and friendly deeds, are sure to reproduce<lb/> themselves. Are you, my friend,
                subject to fits of melancholy <del>the blues</del>, "when<lb/> you feel angry with
                yourself and every one else, and are almost<lb/> determined that it is of no use
                trying to live, in such an ill-<lb/>natured world? Just walk into the street, where
                you may chance<lb/> to see some living assertion that there is some good left; or
                look</p>
            <pb n="1V"/>
            <p>into some good book, where you may see that others have felt as you<lb/> do, and have
                found comfort in looking out from the contemplation of<lb/> their own real or
                imaginary causes of complaint, into some of the pleasant<lb/> aisles which open up
                through the wilderness of life, and have found upon<lb/> nearer approach, that there
                are indeed but few spots so dark, that no<lb/> sun beam has found its way through
                them to warm into life, some flower<lb/> or blade of grass. A word, a thought, a
                kind smile, a noble im-<lb/>pulse, a friendly action, things in themselves "trifles
                light as air,"<lb/> seem then to me, to bear the same relation to great things, as
                the<lb/> Alphabet to language; and when I see men listening with<lb/> admiration
                when events announce themselves with the sound<lb/> of the trumpet, while they
                disregard "the still, small voice;" I long<lb/> to remind them of the answer of that
                clergyman; who, being<lb/> asked, how he comes to alter his manner, from the loud,
                ranting<lb/> style he had formerly used, replied, "When I was young, I used<lb/> to
                think that it was the thunder which killed the people, but<lb/> as I grew older, I
                found that it was the lightning; So I resolved<lb/> to <hi rend="underline">thunder
                    less and lighten more</hi>". One more illustration,<lb/> the cackling of a goose
                saved <placeName>Rome</placeName>; and though you should<lb/> smilingly declare this
                effusion to be something upon the same order,<lb/> I will not complain, if I shall
                have reminded you, that it would<lb/> be wise to "Despise not the day of small
                things."</p>
