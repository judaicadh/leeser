                              <p rend="indent(3)">Your letter in reply to mine<lb/> was duly
                                        received, and I do feel ashamed to reply<lb/> at this late
                                        date. But charitably suspend your judg-<lb/>ment for a
                                        moment and let me give my various excuses.<lb/> In the first
                                        place I was unwell when I received your<lb/> letter, and by
                                        venturing out the next day I injured my-<lb/>self seriously.
                                        During part of <date>January</date>, the whole of the
                                        last<lb/> month, and up to this date I have been almost
                                        every day<lb/> confined to my room by a bronchial affection,
                                        and it was<lb/> unfortunate that I made an exception of two
                                        days, and ven-<lb/>tured to walk out. I have had to leave
                                                  <persName>Mr. Goldsmith's</persName>.<lb/> In
                                        these circumstances I have felt inclined to let every
                                        thing<lb/> else stand still, and attend to myself.</p>
                              <p>Not being fit to go out, I have tried to attend to<lb/> your matter
                                        by writing, and to <sic>fulfil</sic> my promise to use<lb/>
                                        my best efforts to secure the publication of anything that
                                        you<lb/> desire. I wrote immediately to <persName>I
                                                  Engles</persName> of your city, edi-<lb/>tor of
                                        the Presbyterian, giving strong reasons why I thought<lb/>
                                        he should publish your sermon. I requested him either<lb/>
                                        to write to me or to send in his consent to you, and
                                        gave<lb/> him your number. But ever since I have looked
                                        in</p>
                              <pb n="2"/>
                              <p>vain for your Sermon in the Presbyterian, and I have<lb/> received
                                        no private reply. It is notwithstanding due to the<lb/>
                                        liberality of this Editor to say that he immediately
                                        pub-<lb/>lished <persName>Dr. Schelsinger's</persName>
                                        Reply. I next wrote to the Editor<lb/> of the New York
                                        Observer, but I am sorry to say I never<lb/> received any
                                        reply. I have written to other editors whose<lb/>
                                        publications are read by all the members of the Synod,<lb/>
                                        and without yet promising unconditionally to publish
                                        your<lb/> Sermon, they raise questions about its length
                                        &amp;c. and say<lb/> they wish first to see it. So I hope I
                                        can accomplish<lb/> what you request, if you will send your
                                        Sermon to me<lb/>
                                        <placeName>122 Broome street</placeName>. Please have it
                                        carefully and plainly<lb/> written, and if it should be very
                                        long perhaps you would<lb/> not object to dividing it in the
                                        publication. For my<lb/> letters to the Editors I have urged
                                        as well as I could,<lb/> that we have read too much about
                                        the Jews from Christi-<lb/>ans and proselytes and that it is
                                        an act of justice<lb/> which we owe to them to let them
                                        explain themselves<lb/> in our hearing. So I will expect
                                        soon to re-<lb/>ceive your sermon.</p>
                              <p rend="indent(1)">I am very willing to write in the next volume<lb/>
                                        of the Occident as you propose, and to occupy as much<lb/>
                                        space as you can give me, but perhaps it would<lb/> be
