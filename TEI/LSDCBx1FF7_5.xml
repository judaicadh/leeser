			<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>New York</placeName> <date>March 13&#44; 1850</date>.</p>
			<p><addressee>Rev. Mr. Leeser</addressee></p>
          <p rend="indent(2)">Dear Sir.</p>
          <p rend="indent(3)">Your letter in reply to mine<lb/> was duly received&#44; and I do feel ashamed to reply<lb/> at this late date. But charitably suspend your judg&#45;<lb/>ment for a moment and let me give my various excuses.<lb/> In the first place I was unwell when I received your<lb/> letter&#44; and by venturing out the next day I injured my&#45;<lb/>self seriously. During part of <date>January</date>&#44; the whole of the last<lb/> month&#44; and up to this date I have been almost every day<lb/> confined to my room by a bronchial affection&#44; and it was<lb/> unfortunate that I made an exception of two days&#44; and ven&#45;<lb/>tured to walk out. I have had to leave <persName>Mr. Goldsmith&#39;s</persName>.<lb/> In these circumstances I have felt inclined to let every thing<lb/> else stand still&#44; and attend to myself.</p>
			<p>Not being fit to go out&#44; I have tried to attend to<lb/> your matter by writing&#44; and to <sic>fulfil</sic> my promise to use<lb/> my best efforts to secure the publication of anything that you<lb/> desire. I wrote immediately to <persName>I Engles</persName> of your city&#44; edi&#45;<lb/>tor of the Presbyterian&#44; giving strong reasons why I thought<lb/> he should publish your sermon. I requested him either<lb/> to write to me or to send in his consent to you&#44; and gave<lb/> him your number. But ever since I have looked in</p>
		<pb n="2"/>
			<p>vain for your Sermon in the Presbyterian&#44; and I have<lb/> received no private reply. It is notwithstanding due to the<lb/> liberality of this Editor to say that he immediately pub&#45;<lb/>lished <persName>Dr. Schelsinger&#39;s</persName> Reply. I next wrote to the Editor<lb/> of the New York Observer&#44; but I am sorry to say I never<lb/> received any reply. I have written to other editors whose<lb/> publications are read by all the members of the Synod&#44;<lb/> and without yet promising unconditionally to publish your<lb/> Sermon&#44; they raise questions about its length &#38;c. and say<lb/> they wish first to see it. So I hope I can accomplish<lb/> what you request&#44; if you will send your Sermon to me<lb/> <placeName>122 Broome street</placeName>. Please have it carefully and plainly<lb/> written&#44; and if it should be very long perhaps you would<lb/> not object to dividing it in the publication. For my<lb/> letters to the Editors I have urged as well as I could&#44;<lb/> that we have read too much about the Jews from Christi&#45;<lb/>ans and proselytes and that it is an act of justice<lb/> which we owe to them to let them explain themselves<lb/> in our hearing. So I will expect soon to re&#45;<lb/>ceive your sermon.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I am very willing to write in the next volume<lb/> of the Occident as you propose&#44; and to occupy as much<lb/> space as you can give me&#44; but perhaps it would<lb/> be better to form some plan before we commence<lb/> Perhaps you would assign to me a certain number of<lb/> letters or a certain portion of your space and to an<lb/> opponent the same. If a place were thus formed and</p>
		<pb n="3"/>
			<p>published at the beginning&#44; there might be more interest awaken&#45;<lb/>ed for the Occident both among Jews and Christians. A regular<lb/> discussion on a proposed question would certainly be more<lb/> interesting than the irregular attacks of the past.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Dr. Shlesinger</persName> was anxious to know if I intended<lb/> to reply to his letter. I read to him nearly all the com&#45;<lb/>munication which I proposed in my last letter to you&#44; to pub&#45;<lb/>lish&#44; he appears to be much interested in the matter&#44; and<lb/> if it comes prominently before the public&#44; he will in<lb/> all probability make a reply.&#8212;He has visited me<lb/> very frequently during my confinement&#44; and I feel very much attached to him.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">You will continue to send the Occident to myself<lb/> and my father during the coming year</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">Please reply to this at your first convenience</p>
          <p rend="indent(7)">Yours very truly</p>
