            </p>
            <p>My dear friend</p>
            <p rend="indent(2)">I am only this day enabled<lb/> to address you in reply to your
                inquiries<lb/> recd. some weeks ago.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I have just decided to leave<lb/> here in the steamship departing
                hence<lb/> for <placeName>New York</placeName> on the <date>26th</date> proximo,
                and<lb/> on my arrival at <placeName>New York</placeName> shall<lb/> at once proceed
                with the remains<lb/> of an old friend to <placeName>New Port</placeName>,
                avoiding<lb/> all show and parade in <placeName>New York</placeName>.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I intend to have proper arrangements<lb/> made at <placeName>New
                    Port</placeName> to convey the body<lb/> on its arrival, at once to the
                Synagogue<lb/> whence it will be removed to the Cemetery as soon as practicable.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I shall invite no one, or corporation<lb/> to take part in the
                funeral ceremo<lb/>nies, but the time and the simple manner above stated, will
                enable all <add>who wish</add> to follow the remains to their last<lb/> resting
                place. I do not wish it definitely<lb/> stated that the remains will come<lb/> on
                the same vessel with me, because<lb/> the agents of the vessel, fear that such<lb/>
                an announcement would prevent some<lb/> superstitious people from
                    <sic>travelling</sic> by<lb/> the same conveyance on which there was a
                corpse—</p>
            <pb n="1V"/>
            <p>The amount of the foregoing you<lb/> will please state in your next<lb/>
                    (<date>May</date><lb/>No) of the Occident, <hi rend="underline">by
                    authority</hi><lb/> as this is intended as “the due notice<lb/> promised by the
                Executor to all who<lb/> wish to take part in the funeral ceremonies.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Under no circumstances will<lb/> we permit any public
                procession<lb/> in <placeName>New York</placeName>, and even in <placeName>New
                    Port</placeName><lb/> all that is done must be spontaneous.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Now on to the ceremonies—It is not <hi rend="underline"
                    >improbable</hi> that the Congn. here may<lb/> request <persName>Mr.
                    Gutheim</persName> to accompany<lb/> the remains &amp;c, in which case the<lb/>
                Executors will prefer his performing<lb/> the last sad offices together with
                your-<lb/>-self <add>or perhaps others</add> and in that case I will advise<lb/> you
                in time to make any necessary<lb/> preparations. One thing I must impress<lb/> on
                you, and that is, that no speaker on<lb/> an occasion like this will be, should<lb/>
                exceed 20 minutes in his address. As<lb/> to the <hi rend="underline">Hakafoth</hi>,
                if performed at all they<lb/> ought to be <hi rend="underline">read</hi>, and not
                    <hi rend="underline">opera-ised</hi><lb/> as is usually done.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">At <placeName>New Port</placeName> the several delegations<lb/>
                attending, will take any place they<lb/> please in the funeral train. I will<lb/>
                not take any responsibility in working</p>
            <pb n="2R"/>
            <p>out their stations—there will be no<lb/> pall bearers—no tomfoolery—no delay<lb/> on
                the score of etiquette to the living—<lb/> a plain unostentatious Jewish
                funeral<lb/> at which any and all can attend accord<lb/>ing to the laws &amp;
                republican custom<lb/> of Jews—</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)"> I regret to find that your education<lb/>al Society has not taken
                the steps<lb/> recommended in the Circular of the<lb/> Executors, by which it seems
                likely<lb/> that your Institution will not get<lb/> paid the 20,000, at least before
                the next<lb/> year; and not even then unless you<lb/> legally appoint some person
                here<lb/> to represent that corporation. If<lb/> the officers object to appointing
                my<lb/> brother <persName>Maudes<add>?</add></persName> they can send the power<lb/>
                of atty &amp; other requisite papers to any<lb/> one else. The object of the
                Executor in<lb/> sending out the Circular, was simply<lb/> to save cost of
                commissions to the<lb/> Societies, and as we are responsible<lb/> for the acts of
                any one we recommend,<lb/> we naturally selected a man in whose<lb/> integrity <hi
                    rend="underline">we</hi> had confidence. On one thing<lb/> you may rely—we shall
                only pay in one<lb/> way, and that is, through a legally authorised<lb/> agent <hi
                    rend="underline">here</hi>. This is entre nous. The law<lb/> gives the exr. 12
                mos before paying anything, &amp;</p>

            <p>then we are the judges under the Law<lb/> and practice of our Courts, as to the<lb/>
                manner in which we shall take<lb/> voucher receipts <add>?</add> to
                    <sic>deposite</sic><lb/> in court when asking for an appro<lb/>val of our

                recpt of our Circular and seems<lb/> to think that we are going to keep up<lb/> a

                are simple, our duties are plain, and<lb/> whilst we shall respect legally all
                that<lb/> is his due—we shall not make him<lb/> an exception, to the general
