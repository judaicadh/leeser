            <p>mentioned by the Tahlmud—as figurative expression for a spiritual<lb/> enjoyment. At
                this they replied: „If such a meal is meant, then<lb/> exists also no cup to speak
                the blessing (<add>Hebrew</add>), what, according<lb/> to the Talmud, <persName>King
                    David</persName> will do; he (<persName>Maimonides</persName>) had done<lb/>
                better had he been silent.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Of course, such utterances violated deeply the protectors of
                phi„<lb/>losophical studies and <persName>Nachmanides</persName> (<add>Hebrew</add>)
                and <persName>R. Samuel ben</persName><lb/>
                <persName>Abraham Sforta</persName> defending <persName>Maimonides</persName>
                proved, that the<lb/> adversaries were too dark in said points. But some<lb/> more
                sagacious perceiving the consequences of the struggle<lb/> not in said points but in
                the reasons declared by <persName>M.</persName> for the<lb/> biblical laws, were not
                yet appeased.</p>
            <p>The Moreh, the Moreh was a thorn in their <del>eg</del> eyes.<lb/> But
                    <persName>M.'s</persName> supporte<del>d</del>rs headed by the illustrious
                    <persName>R. David ben</persName><lb/>
                <persName>Josef Kimchi</persName> (<add>Hebrew</add>) stepped forth as defensors of
                enlightened<lb/> inquiry.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">In this dilemma the pious <persName>Salomo</persName> took resource
                to denunciation.<lb/> He went to the monks, saying: „Our fellow believers are<lb/>
                heretics and unbelievers induced by the Egyptian <persName>Moses</persName>
                    (<persName>Maimonides</persName>),<lb/> who has written heretic books, and
                whereas you remove your<lb/> heretics, so clear away also ours and order to be burnt
                    <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> and <add>Hebrew</add>.—But this step also was in vain, as
                the Christian<lb/>
                <del>religion</del> jurisdiction declared them as <sic>liers</sic> and informers,
                and the tongue<lb/> of some of them, probably of <persName>Salomo</persName> himself
                was cut out,<lb/> what caused their death.</p>
            <p>In the year <date>4995</date> A. M. <persName>Abraham</persName>, son of
                    <persName>Maimonides</persName><lb/> in <placeName><sic>Cahiro</sic></placeName>
                was informed of the above stated events and<lb/>

            <p>deeply affected by the blame accumulated to the memory of his<lb/> illustrious father
                he wrote the <add>Hebrew</add>, by which he<lb/> showed the ignorance of the
                adversaries.</p>
            <p>Peace was restored, the Orthodoxy of <persName>Maimonides</persName> conceded,
                but<lb/> the basis of his philosophical writings still contested and<lb/> half a
                century afterwards the friends of philosophy in the <placeName>East</placeName>
                    (<placeName>Bagdad</placeName>)<lb/> were compelled to pronounce an
                    <sic>excummication</sic> against all, who<lb/> calumniate
                    <persName>M.</persName> and his books. i.</p>
            <p>In the Provence the writings of <persName>M.</persName> were read with increased
                    <sic>ardour</sic>,<lb/> the family <persName>Thibbon</persName> especially
                    <persName>R. Samuel Abn Thibbon</persName> procured<lb/> translations and so the
                Moreh enjoyed numerous patrons and<lb/> was approved of by the majority.
                    <placeName>Spain</placeName>—of old—the land of sciences,<lb/> was at that time
                oppressed by Christian <sic>fanatism</sic>, which<lb/> raged not with spiritual arms
                but with fire and sword, and this<lb/> had also influence on the Jews. The
                philosophical studies<lb/> were not yet forgot but the <sic>florishing</sic> times
                were past.<lb/> Therefore <persName>R. Salomo Addereth</persName> could raise up the
                minds, <del><hi rend="underline">ag</hi></del><lb/> and he assisted by the
                celebrated Talmudist <persName>Asher ben Jechiel</persName><lb/> interdicted the
                study of philosophy to all under thirty years<lb/> of age. Against this interdiction
                the friends of philosophy rose,<lb/> and as the Champions were tired, peace was
                desired.</p>
            <p>Peace came but it was a sad one. <placeName><sic>france</sic></placeName> expelled
                the Jews,<lb/>
                <placeName>Spain</placeName> also afterwards. The oppression during the middle<lb/>
                ages <sic>exstinguished</sic> all and every spiritual light.</p>
            <p>The Champions were banished to different countries, the<lb/> whole affair was forgot,
                the oppression did not admit<lb/>

            <p>an aspiring genius to rise up. But history gives notice<lb/> of this excited period
                in Judaism. The books pro and contra<lb/> still exist and <hi rend="underline"
                    >should be read in our days</hi>, where enlightened<lb/> spiritual life is
                rekindled.</p>
            <p>As we have reason to be proud of our ancestor's <sic>litterature</sic><lb/> at that
                period, it must be also borne in mind, that<lb/>
                <persName>Maimonides</persName> and his adversaries lived in an age, where<lb/>
                throughout whole <placeName>Europe</placeName> dark midnight governed.</p>
            <p>The influence of <persName>M.'s</persName> writings was and is important at<lb/> all
                times and have ever been an impulse to a liberal<lb/> spiritual movement in
                Judaism.</p>
            <p>What in those days could not be accomplished owing to<lb/> the iron handed oppression
                of the middle ages, is reawakened<lb/> in our days and expects and claims its
                solving, viz:</p>
