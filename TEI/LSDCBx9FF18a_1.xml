				<p>mentioned by the Tahlmud&#8212;as figurative expression for a spiritual<lb/> enjoyment.  At this they replied&#58; &#8222;If such a meal is meant&#44; then<lb/> exists also no cup to speak the blessing &#40;<add>Hebrew</add>&#41;&#44; what&#44; according<lb/> to the Talmud&#44; <persName>King David</persName> will do&#59; he &#40;<persName>Maimonides</persName>&#41; had done<lb/> better had he been silent.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Of course&#44; such utterances violated deeply the protectors of phi&#8222;<lb/>losophical studies and <persName>Nachmanides</persName> &#40;<add>Hebrew</add>&#41; and <persName>R. Samuel ben</persName><lb/> <persName>Abraham Sforta</persName> defending <persName>Maimonides</persName> proved&#44; that the<lb/> adversaries were too dark in said points.  But some<lb/> more sagacious perceiving the consequences of the struggle<lb/> not in said points but in the reasons declared by <persName>M.</persName> for the<lb/> biblical laws&#44; were not yet appeased.</p>
				<p>The Moreh&#44; the Moreh was a thorn in their <del>eg</del> eyes.<lb/>  But <persName>M.&#39;s</persName> supporte<del>d</del>rs headed by the illustrious <persName>R. David ben</persName><lb/> <persName>Josef Kimchi</persName> &#40;<add>Hebrew</add>&#41; stepped forth as defensors of enlightened<lb/> inquiry.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In this dilemma the pious <persName>Salomo</persName> took resource to denunciation.<lb/>  He went to the monks&#44; saying&#58; &#8222;Our fellow believers are<lb/> heretics and unbelievers induced by the Egyptian <persName>Moses</persName> &#40;<persName>Maimonides</persName>&#41;&#44;<lb/> who has written heretic books&#44; and whereas you remove your<lb/> heretics&#44; so clear away also ours and order to be burnt <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> and <add>Hebrew</add>.&#8212;But this step also was in vain&#44; as the Christian<lb/> <del>religion</del> jurisdiction declared them as <sic>liers</sic> and informers&#44; and the tongue<lb/> of some of them&#44; probably of <persName>Salomo</persName> himself was cut out&#44;<lb/> what caused their death.</p>
				<p>In the year <date>4995</date> A. M. <persName>Abraham</persName>&#44; son of <persName>Maimonides</persName><lb/> in <placeName><sic>Cahiro</sic></placeName> was informed of the above stated events and<lb/> <hi rend="underline">deeply</hi></p>

				<p>deeply affected by the blame accumulated to the memory of his<lb/> illustrious father he wrote the <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; by which he<lb/> showed the ignorance of the adversaries.</p>
				<p>Peace was restored&#44; the Orthodoxy of <persName>Maimonides</persName> conceded&#44; but<lb/> the basis of his philosophical writings still contested and<lb/> half a century afterwards the friends of philosophy in the <placeName>East</placeName> &#40;<placeName>Bagdad</placeName>&#41;<lb/> were compelled to pronounce an <sic>excummication</sic> against all&#44; who<lb/> calumniate <persName>M.</persName> and his books. i.</p>
				<p>In the Provence the writings of <persName>M.</persName> were read with increased <sic>ardour</sic>&#44;<lb/> the family <persName>Thibbon</persName> especially <persName>R. Samuel Abn Thibbon</persName> procured<lb/> translations and so the Moreh enjoyed numerous patrons and<lb/> was approved of by the majority.  <placeName>Spain</placeName>&#8212;of old&#8212;the land of sciences&#44;<lb/> was at that time oppressed by Christian <sic>fanatism</sic>&#44; which<lb/> raged not with spiritual arms but with fire and sword&#44; and this<lb/> had also influence on the Jews.  The philosophical studies<lb/> were not yet forgot but the <sic>florishing</sic> times were past.<lb/>  Therefore <persName>R. Salomo Addereth</persName> could raise up the minds&#44; <del><hi rend="underline">ag</hi></del><lb/> and he assisted by the celebrated Talmudist <persName>Asher ben Jechiel</persName><lb/> interdicted the study of philosophy to all under thirty years<lb/> of age.  Against this interdiction the friends of philosophy rose&#44;<lb/> and as the Champions were tired&#44; peace was desired.</p>
				<p>Peace came but it was a sad one.  <placeName><sic>france</sic></placeName> expelled the Jews&#44;<lb/> <placeName>Spain</placeName> also afterwards.  The oppression during the middle<lb/> ages <sic>exstinguished</sic> all and every spiritual light.</p>
				<p>The Champions were banished to different countries&#44; the<lb/> whole affair was forgot&#44; the oppression did not admit<lb/> <hi rend="underline">an</hi></p>

				<p>As we have reason to be proud of our ancestor&#39;s <sic>litterature</sic><lb/> at that period&#44; it must be also borne in mind&#44; that<lb/> <persName>Maimonides</persName> and his adversaries lived in an age&#44; where<lb/> throughout whole <placeName>Europe</placeName> dark midnight governed.</p>  
				<p>The influence of <persName>M.&#39;s</persName> writings was and is important at<lb/> all times and have ever been an impulse to a liberal<lb/> spiritual movement in Judaism.</p>
				<p>What in those days could not be accomplished owing to<lb/> the iron handed oppression of the middle ages&#44; is reawakened<lb/> in our days and expects and claims its solving&#44; viz&#58;</p>
