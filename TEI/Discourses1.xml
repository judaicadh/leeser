                thus is my word&#44; saith the Lord&#44; like the fire&#44; and like the hammer that
                shivereth the rock.&#34; Jeremiah xxiii 39. VOL. I. FIRST SERIES. PHILADELPHIA&#58;
                PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR BY SHERMAN &#38; CO. 5627. <pb n="ii"/> Entered according to
                Act of Congress&#44; in the year 1836. By Isaac Leeser&#44; In the Clerk&#39;s
                Office of the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of
                Pennsylvania. Stereotyped by Sherhan I G <pb n="iii"/> DEDICATION. TO THE RIGHT
                REVEREND ABRAHAM SUTRO&#44; Honoured Rabbi&#33; In inscribing these volumes to
                you&#44; I cannot refrain from publicly acknowledging that to you it is chiefly
                owing that I ever ventured to un&#8211; dertake the task of a public teacher. I well
                remember the time&#44; when scarcely nine sum&#8211; mers had passed over my
                head&#44; that you arrived among us J&#34; and how the first sermon I ever heard
                delivered&#44; the one you addressed to our congregation&#44; made a powerful
                impression upon us all&#44; not excepting the little unconscious boy I then was.
                You&#44; also&#44; as I advanced in life&#44; &#40;iii&#41; <pb n="iv"/> IV
                DEDICATION. encouraged my humble striving to excel&#44; and I can never forget the
                kindness with which you al&#8211; • ways seconded the efforts of my blessed teacher.
                I trust that the fruits of maturer years&#44; which I now present to you&#44; may be
                thought worthy of your acceptance&#44; and convince you that your guidance and
                instruction&#44; as well as your ex&#8211; ample&#44; have not been lost upon the
                one who is now far removed from the sphere of your pious labours. May many blessings
                attend you&#59; and let me hope that long life and extended usefulness may be
                granted you from above&#44; in order to draw many more hearts into the service of
                our almighty Father&#44; as you have done in the case of Your devoted servant&#44;
                and obedient scholar&#44; Isaac Leeser. Philadelphia&#44; Tebeth 29th&#44; 5597. <pb

                addresses the number of Israelites has in&#8211; creased immensely in this
                country&#44; and a new generation has sprung up to whom I would gladly leave these
                volumes as my religious legacy &#59; for such as they are&#44; they contain the
                sincere outpouring of an honest heart&#44; if I know myself at all &#59; and
                therefore I hope that they will be useful to some&#44; conscious that they cannot be
                injurious to any of our people. Since the first edition was issued man&#39;&#8211;
                changes in our religious affairs have taken place among us &#59; but in my own mind
                the old faith has not been supplanted by the new ideas which have found so many
                adherents and many advocates among men claiming superior learning. Notwithstanding
                the lapse of so many years&#44; therefore&#44; a few verbal corrections only have
                been deemed necessary&#44; and not an idea has been altered to suit the more modern
                taste&#44; convinced as I am that truth is un&#8211; changeable&#44; an4 I hope that
                the heart of the vast majority of Isra&#8211; elites will stiU respond to the
                instructions laid before them now&#44; as was the case three decennia ago&#44; when
                I was perhaps the only Jew&#8211; ish public speaker in America. Advancing years
                have admonished me not to delay issuing the remainder v of my manuscript and to
                revise what I have printed already. It would be unpleasant to me to reflect
                that&#44; when the grave incloses my mortal remains&#44; some one might be induced
                to edit my writings with such arbitrary changes and annotations as he &#40;vii&#41;

                introduce&#44; and to make me say what I would not sanction&#44; were it in my power
                to speak for myself. The approba&#8211; tion bestowed on my oral lectures and
                printed works leads me to hope that my labours will not be totally forgotten &#59;
                and hence they are now presented to the new generation of Israelites&#44; more
                numer&#8211; ous by far than that for which I first exerted myself&#44; with all the
                correctness I am capable of&#44; and in a style which it is hoped will secure the
                approval of the public&#44; at least as far as concerns the mechanical execution.
                These few observations are deemed all that is necessary to serve as an apology for
                appearing again before the public with my pro&#8211; ductions. For I have been so
                long indulged&#44; by the forbearance of those who have with me the same faith and
                hope&#44; in the efforts made to serve them in the profession to which their choice
                called me so very early in life&#44; that I sincerely trust that now in the decline
                of years I shall be as kindly received&#44; as when first the exigencies of the
                times and of our people induced me to wield my inexperienced pen in their
                service&#44; and in that cause which has ever enjoyed the evident protection of the
                Most High. Philadelphia&#44; Iyar 10th&#44; 5627. <pb n="ix"/> PREFACE. In the
                following work the reader is presented with the labour of more than six years. Many
                of the Discourses were composed&#44; when I suffered both under mental and bodily
                afflictions&#44; when any exer&#8211; tion was extremely painful &#59; and it must
                not be imagined&#44; that&#44; what appears to read smoothly&#44; and as if written
                off&#8211;hand&#44; did not cost me an intense degree of thought and application.
                Very often the labour was interrupted by severe sickness and other untoward
                events&#44; and hence the frequent long intervals between the different treatises.
                Still I never relaxed in my endeavours to diffuse religi&#8211; ous and useful
                knowledge&#44; and I fervently trust that I have suc&#8211; ceeded&#44; to a certain
                extent&#44; to impart some information which is not readily accessible in books in
                general circulation. The first twenty Discourses were re&#8211;written &#59; because
                I could not suffer my first attempts to come before the public without a careful
                revision. The others&#44; however&#44; which were composed chiefly after the
                chastening hand of the Lord had fallen heavily on me&#44; were prepared with more
                care&#44; and I therefore only corrected them thoroughly&#44; and altered those
                parts which appeared objectionable or defective. I will not assert&#44; that I could
                not have altered the whole series&#44; and perhaps improved it much more than I have
                done &#59; but still&#34;&#33; was obliged to stop somewhere in the corrections I
                introduced&#44; and I candidly believe that farther changes&#44; curtail&#8211;
                ments and enlargements would not have enabled me to produce any thing more deserving
                of approbation &#59; as&#44; what might in this manner have been gained in beauty of
                style&#44; would to a certainty have been at a sacrifice of the force and
                ingenuousness always be&#8211; longing to the first efforts of the mind&#44; before
                they have been sub&#8211; jected to the cold and capricious judgment of criticism.
                Doubtless another might have used the pruning&#8211;knife more frequently and
                &#40;ix&#41; <pb n="xii"/> Xll PREFACE. it for a future and more fitting occasion.
                Yet I must remark in passing&#44; that the whole of the Discourses may be viewed as
                extem&#8211; poraneous effusions in writing&#59; since I never prepared them&#44;
                with but very few exceptions&#44; till a day or two before the day I spoke them
                &#59; and in revising them for the press&#44; I took especial care not to alter the
                subject&#8211;matter more than correctness of argument and of diction required.
                &#8212; I have done. &#8212; The book is before the public &#59; and in asking an
                indulgent judgment&#44; I wish not faults to be ex&#8211; tenuated or defects to be
                passed over without censure. Let me hope&#44; that the exertions I have made in the
                service of my Maker may redound to diffuse the knowledge of his commandments among
                our people&#44; and to contribute to cement stronger the bond that unites us in our
                captivity &#59; and that my humble striving may be viewed in favour by Him who is
                the Lord and the Creator of the universe. Philadelphia&#44; Tebeth 29&#44; 5597

                DISCOURSE I&#42; Confidence in God. Brethren of the House of Israel &#33; It is with
                extreme reluctance&#44; founded upon a know&#8211; ledge of my inability to advance
                any thing which may &#42; It was in the early part of the summer of 5589&#44; that I
                was in&#8211; vited to become a candidate for the office of Hazan of the
                congrega&#8211; tion Mikve Israel of Philadelphia. I was at that time only a few
                months over twenty&#8211;two years old&#44; and had not thought of ever becoming the
                minister of any congregation&#44; and was induced solely under the persuasion that
                by being in public life I could become useful to the Jewfeh community&#44; that I
                consented to have my name presented among others. At that period the duties of the
                minister were confined to the conducting of the public worship in the Syna&#8211;
                gogue and elsewhere&#44; and it was not expected that he should be at the same time
                a preacher and exhorter. But even before my being in office it had appeared to me as
                an incongruity&#44; that words of in&#8211; struction formed no &#39;part of our
                regular service &#59; and having been summoned on account of some literary efforts
                produced in Richmond to accept the trust with which the voice of a large majority of
                the vol. i. I &#40;1&#41; <pb n="2"/> 2 CONFIDENCE IN GOD. be generally
                interesting&#44; that I now&#44; for the first time&#44; venture to address you. I
                feel too little confidence in my attainments &#40;and I hope that no oue will accuse
                me of affectation for so saying&#41; even to imagine&#44; that I could do justice to
                our holy religion by any thing I am going to say. Before I begin&#44; therefore&#44;
                I am constrained to tell you&#44; that only in obedience to the repeated
                solicitations of persons who really feel an interest in the welfare of our
                nation&#44; I persuaded my&#8211; Israelites of Philadelphia honoured me&#44; I had
                indulged the hope that I would be requested&#44; immediately after my election&#44;
                to give discourses on our religion in the language of the country. But herein I was
                sadly disappointed. At several meetings of the con&#8211; gregation and of the Board
                of Managers nothing was said or done to authorize me even to assume the character of
                preacher&#44; while the laws&#44; as they stood&#44; conferred on the presiding
                officer alone the power to direct the Hazan or any other person to deliver sermons
                on special occasions. But though I had no power bestowed on me to speak&#44; it was
                perfectly clear that the people desired pulpit instruc&#8211; tion. After being&#44;
                therefore&#44; nearly nine months in office&#44; I was induced to address a circular
                letter &#39;to the several members of the Board of Adjunta&#44; asking them whether
                my speaking in Synagogue would meet their consent. Without holding a formal
                meeting&#44; a majority of the Board signified&#44; in unofficial letters&#44; their
                approval of my intention. With this permission thus conveyed&#44; I had to be
                satisfied&#44; and I accordingly prepared myself with the above address which was
                spoken on Sabbath Nasso&#44; 5590&#44; and was the first origi&#8211; nal
                composition I ever delivered in public. It was a painful experi&#8211; ment&#44; the
                issue of which I greatly dreaded &#59; but the kind approba&#8211; tion and
                encouragement bestowed on me by some intelligent ladies&#44; especially&#44; after
                it had been spoken&#44; admonished me that I ought to persevere &#59; and the result
                has been that while faithfully discharging all the duties proper of the
                Hazanship&#44; I added public instruction as a part of our service. Since the year
                noted above&#44; the custom has extended almost everywhere&#44; and no congregation
                thinks itself thoroughly organized without a preacher &#59; but then speaking in
                Syn&#8211; agogue was something new&#44; and far from being acquiesced in by many
                even well&#8211;meaning and pious persons. <pb n="3"/> CONFIDENCE IN GOD. 3 self to
                attempt teaching that&#44; which I deem to be the essential parts of our faith.
                After this candid avowal&#44; I trust&#44; that you will pardon any defect which you
                may discover&#44; and be a little indulgent to my first effort at public speaking.
                It is highly probable&#44; that most of you&#44; if not all&#44; may have heard all
                which I can advance &#59; but then I must beg of you to consider&#44; that known
                truths may often be but faintly remem&#8211; bered&#44; and that we may derive great
                and lasting bene&#8211; fits by having them presented to us in a light&#44; in which
                perhaps we had never before viewed them. It is for this reason expedient&#44; that
                occasional lectures on religious subjects should be delivered in our Syn&#8211;
                agogues&#44; although I cannot deny that many members&#44; perhaps the greater
                number&#44; of our society are suffi&#8211; ciently acquainted with their
                duties&#44; and need not to be reminded of them by any preacher&#44; however
                elo&#8211; quent. &#8212; Having premised thus much&#44; let us proceed to the
                consideration of the following verse&#44; from the xxvth chapter of Isaiah &#58;
                &#34;And it will be said on that day &#58; Behold this is oar God in whom we have
                trusted&#44; and he will save us &#59; this is the Lord in whom we have trusted&#44;
                we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.&#34; Isaiah xxv. 9. &#44; God is great
                and mighty &#8212; nothing is too great for his power to accomplish &#8212; nothing
                is hidden from his searching view. For if we look around us and be&#8211; hold the
                stupendous works of creation &#59; when we see the regularity and order which reign
                in everything&#59; and when we turn our view within ourselves&#44; and <pb n="4"/> 4
                CONFIDENCE IN GOD. consider the nature of the living soul which we feel to animate
                us &#58; we must be convinced&#44; that the One above is powerful beyond
                compare&#44; and wise beyond all measure. And if we descend from a contempla&#8211;
                tion of the greatness of God&#44; as displayed in his crea&#8211; tion&#44; and
                reflect with care and candour upon the indi&#8211; vidual fortune of every human
                being &#58; we will dis&#8211; cover&#44; that his providence and goodness are no
                less displayed in the details of life&#44; than his power and wisdom are shown in
                the structure of the universe. Of this his superintending watchfulness over the
                individual happiness and lives of the children of man&#44; Holy Writ furnishes us
                with many examples&#59; for there we find narrated&#44; how He manifested his power
                in saving and assisting those worthy of being called his servants&#44; those&#44;
                who placed their trust in Him&#44; their God and Redeemer&#44; when they found
                themselves surrounded by difficulties&#44; against which no human foresight could
                have guarded&#44; from which no earthly means could extricate them. We there
                have&#44; also&#44; examples which prove&#44; that they who relied on their own
                strength&#44; or asked for and employed the aid of men&#44; were unsuccessful in
                their endeavours&#44; whilst the weaker&#44; relying upon their Father above&#44;
                were prosperous. This should teach us that&#44; if we wish to receive the protection
                of God&#44; we ought first to deserve it by placing an undivided confidence in his
                providence&#44; and should never hesitate to do what our religion demands of us for
                fear of suffering worldly loss and inconvenience&#59; but we should consider that we
                never can ultimately lose if we are truly obedient to God&#59; that in his service
                we never will be allowed to suffer more than we are able to bear. We may <pb n="5"/>
                CONFIDENCE IN GOD. 5 be met by difficulties in our pursuit of righteousness&#44; but
                it is our duty to remain unshaken &#59; we may have to suffer temporary loss&#44;
                but we should not heed it. We may perohance&#44; also&#44; subject ourselves to the
                hatred of wicked men &#59; but we ought not to suffer the fear of the creature to
                overcome us in the service of the Creator. It should be enough for us&#44; that we
                are doing our duty&#59; that we are obeying the will of our Father&#58; and this
                consciousness will&#8211; strengthen us to bear up against all worldly ills &#59;
                for&#44; animated by a true confidence in God&#44; we must feel that He is mighty
                enough to repay us our losses&#44; remunerate us for our toil&#44; and protect us
                from any injury to which we may be exposed. If therefore we are truly im&#8211;
                pressed with the knowledge of the power and good&#8211; ness of the Lord&#44; we
                must be his willing servants&#44; and practise that readily which we are taught by
                Him to call wise and good&#44; independent of all considerations of personal gain or
                aggrandizement&#44; unswayed by fear of loss or persecution. But as it is undeniable
                that we Israelites have at present no national government&#59; as our number is but
                small and unimportant when compared with the mass of mankind&#58; the pursuit of our
                religion may appear unprofitable to many among the worldly&#8211; minded&#44; since
                it can bring them no temporal advan&#8211; tages&#44; for tfaere are none in
                authority who may bestow on them offices of trust and profit for their attachment to
                the ancient faith&#59; and the system which we uphold makes often strong demands
                upon our personal con&#8211; venience and upon the riches we may possess. Per&#8211;
                haps the strict observance of our law may prevent us from participating in the
                distribution of certain offices&#44; <pb n="6"/> 6 CONFIDENCE IN GOD. the duties of
                which may compel us to transgress the divine precepts. Again&#44; some one may he
                induced to plead necessity as an excuse for not adhering very strictly to the
                religion of his forefathers&#59; and he may imagine to himself a sufficient number
                of excuses to lull his conscience to sleep&#44; whilst he transgresses the
                commandments of his God. Nevertheless he will assert&#44; that he is a good and
                truly religious man&#44; since he observes what is commonly called the moral duties
                &#59; and he alleges that he fulfils everything which God can in reason ask of
                him&#59; but he forgets in his self&#8211;gratulation&#44; that interest alone&#44;
                sordid meanness&#44; groveling avarice&#44; and a yielding to selfish desires are
                the true motives of his conduct. And can this be religion &#63; is this a display of
                pure faith&#63; an entire reliance on God&#39;s omnipotence&#63; JSTo &#33; Let me
                tell him that he has not true religion in his heart &#8212; that his soul has not
                the proper reverence of the Lord &#8212; that his confidence is not entire in the
                God who created him. And although it is natural. that we should be startled at the
                sight of what are called necessities&#44; and although we are very apt to view every
                obstacle as insurmountable&#44; provided we can excuse ourselves thereby for not
                doing our duty&#58; we cannot call ourselves good and religious&#44; we cannot be
                said to confide in God&#44; as lona&#58; as we are deterred from obeying Him by the
                dread of any evil we may have to suffer here&#44; and withheld from engaging in his
                service by the sight of the difficulties which we have to encounter&#59; for we are
                not then kindled by that devotion to the will of the Lord which will enable us to
                make personal sacrifices&#44; and to submit to dangers in our endeavours to serve

                tend so power&#8211; fully to weaken our confidence in God&#44; there is yet another
                feeling&#44; which may aptly be called self&#8211;suffi&#8211; ciency&#44; against
                which we must arm ourselves by every means of which we are masters&#44; if we wish
                to lead a religious life. For there are many&#44; who&#44; inflated by success in
                their pursuits&#44; are misled to esteem their strength as sufficient to enable them
                to combat every obstacle &#8212; to shield themselves against all vicissitudes

                therefore&#44; rendered selfish and proud&#44; they neglect to pay due deference to
                religious duties&#44; and they seem to say by their conduct&#58; &#34;We need not

                Surely not riches&#44; not worldly goods&#44; which when obtained are fleeting&#44;
                and soon lost&#44; though obtained with great labour&#59; but only the soul within
                thee&#44; which feels&#44; which thinks&#44; which prompts thee to action &#8212;
                this is thy riches&#44; thy portion&#44; thy imperish&#8211; able inheritance from
                thy God. And can she feel aught of delight at thy hoarded riches&#63; can she feel
                pleasure because thou dwellest in a palace&#63; can she be benefitted&#44; when thou
                hast hundreds of menials that are ready at thy nod &#63; E&#34;o&#44; thou mistakest
                the truth&#59; she feels no pleasure on account of thy wealth&#59; she is only
                delighted when thou art good and virtuous&#44; when thy confidence in God enables
                thee to be above mean desire and sordid avarice&#44; and when thou art man enough to
                defy every obstacle which may oppose thee in the acquisition of virtue. For when our
                mor&#8211; tal career is closed&#44; when the soul ascends to God&#44; she needs no
                longer the blessings which this life can afford &#59; and nothing but virtue and
                piety remain to her then from her sojournment on earth. Our wise men illustrated
                this by the following par&#8211; able &#58; A certain man had three friends&#44; to
                one of whom he was devotedly attached&#59; to the second he was kind&#44; but he did
                not esteem him by far as much as the first&#59; &#8211;to the third&#44;
                however&#44; he paid but little regard&#44; and&#39; scarcely ever thought of him.
                It hap&#8211; pened one day&#44; that this man was suddenly sum&#8211; moned before
                the king &#59; and not knowing the cause of the unexpected summons&#44; or perhaps
                dreading to appear before the king without a powerful defeuder to assist him in case
                of necessity &#58; he applied to the first of his friends&#44; being sure&#44; that
                he would not re&#8211; <pb n="10"/> 10 CONFIDENCE IN GOD. fuse him his countenance
                in the present emergency. The friend&#44; however&#44; did refuse&#44; excusing
                himself&#44; saying&#58; &#34;I really cannot go&#59; I am so much occu&#8211; pied
                with my own concerns&#44; that it is impossible for me to assist you now &#59;
                besides this&#44; I have no influ&#8211; ence with the king.&#34; He then went to
                the second&#44; who answered &#58; &#34; I can do but little for you &#59; but as we
                have been friends &#34;so long&#44; I will accompany you as far as the
                palace&#8211;gate&#44; more than this I cannot do.&#34; &#8212; Finding himself so
                rudely treated by his most intimate friends&#44; he applied to the last&#44; whom he
                had so long neglected. This one&#44; who in fact had always loved him more than
                either of the others&#44; received him with open arms&#44; saying &#58; &#34; How
                glad I am&#44; my dear friend&#44; that you have given me this opportunity of
                serving you &#59; I will go with you to the king&#44; I will remain with you&#44;
                and defend you if necessary.&#34; The moral of the foregoing is&#44; that a man
                generally values his riches more than his relatives and friends&#44; and these again
                more than his religion&#44; which is&#44; alas&#33; like the last friend in the
                parable&#44; too often neglected and almost forgotten. He is finally summoned to
                ap&#8211; pear before the King of kings&#44; the Holy One&#44; praised be He &#59;
                his money avails him nothing&#44; &#8212; this must be left behind &#59; his
                relatives and friends accompany him to the grave&#44; there they must leave him
                &#59; and thus his virtues and good deeds alone remain with him&#44; to go with him
                to the tribunal of the Judge of all to de&#8211; fend him and to plead in his
                favour. &#8212; Why then should we turn our whole attention to the acquisi&#8211;
                tion of wealth&#44; &#8212; why should we be so sedulous to make friends &#8212;
                when these riches&#44; and these friends&#44; are eventually of so little real
                benefit to us &#63; In say&#8211; <pb n="11"/> CONFIDENCE IN GOD. 11 ing this&#44; I
                must not be misunderstood as inculcating that it is wrong to endeavour to become
                rich&#44; or to acquire friends &#59; for my intention only is to impress your minds
                with the folly of continually searching for wealth&#44; of that anxious solicitude
                to have a large number of admirers&#44; and thereby neglecting the more necessary
                duties&#44; which are&#44; the perfecting of your&#8211; selves in the fear of the
                Lord and the love towards man. In a word&#44; the possession of riches should be the
                secondary object&#44; the possession of virtue how&#8211; ever the chief&#44; as it
                is the true&#44; aim of life. It may indeed happen&#44; that persons less
                religious&#44; less moral&#44; less beloved&#44; than yourselves may possess a
                larger portion of worldly blessings &#59; but can this be an excuse for you to
                follow their example &#63; Do you not know &#58; &#34; That only a short time
                elapses&#44; and the wicked is gone&#44; and you search his place carefully&#44; and
                he is no more &#63;&#34; &#8212; Perhaps you may never live to see the punishment of
                the man&#44; whom you think yourselves justified in calling wicked&#59; but
                reflect&#44; that it is not for you to determine&#44; who is guilty&#44; or who is
                innocent &#59; there is one Judge&#44; who searches the heart&#44; He knows the true
                desires of each man&#39;s spirit&#59; and many a one&#44; whom you think very
                bad&#44; may have hidden virtues&#44; and many an outwardly pious man may be
                actuated by wicked motives. It is in fact the perfection of our confidence in
                God&#44; that we never find fault with his dispensations&#44; and that we always
                cheerfully acquiesce in his decisions&#44; be they for us or against us. Even if we

                tune&#44; &#40;yet where is that man who never sinneth &#63;&#41; we ought&#44;

                since it is perhaps the rod held over us&#44; which prevents us from following in
                the paths of sinners. For it may be known to Infinite Wisdom&#44; that pros&#8211;
                perity would make us forgetful of his will&#44; that elated with success we might
                ascribe this success to our own strength&#44; and forget&#44; &#34; that it is He
                alone who enables us to acquire wealth.&#34; And is it not better then for our
                everlasting happiness&#44; that we remain&#44; whilst in this world&#44; in humble
                circumstances &#63; Every one of you can answer this question for himself&#59; for
                it needs not my admonition to convince you&#44; that eternity ought to be more
                regarded than evanescent time. If&#44; therefore&#44; we should be overtaken by
                misfor&#8211; tunes&#44; if we even see our fondest hopes blighted&#44; if those we
                love most are torn from our embrace in the prime of youthful life &#58; we should
                reflect&#44; that He who has smitten us&#44; can also apply the healing balsam to
                the wound&#44; and that He never punishes a man bet&#8211; yon d his strength of
                enduring. And if we are des&#8211; tined to suffer much&#44; we shall have an equal
                share of firmness to suffer with patience and resignation&#59; and thus must the
                evil even tend to fortify us more strongly in the fear of God&#44; and in the
                confidence we should feel in Him&#59; and unhappiness&#44; therefore&#44; which
                lasts but a short time&#44; may be the cause of permanent happiness and undying
                bliss. If thus an individual is to feel an unwavering&#44; filial&#44; confidence in
                his Creator&#44; it becomes no less obligatory upon Jews&#44; as a nation&#44; to
                trust unshrink&#8211; ingly&#44; without murmuring&#44; without searching in the
                decrees of his unsearchable wisdom&#44; in the God of our fathers&#44; who has
                sustained us through so many <pb n="13"/> CONFIDENCE IN GOD. 13 ages of persecution
                and oppression. For if we ask &#58; &#34; Why are we to suffer so much more than any
                other people&#63;&#34; we should answer ourselves&#44; that we are punished for our
                manifold transgressions &#59; for our having broken the covenant which the Lord made
                with us &#59; for our having been disunited among our&#8211; selves&#44; and for
                being even at this very moment still unworthy of the great and glorious happiness
                prom&#8211; ised to us through the mouth of nearly all the pro&#8211; phets. It
                therefore came to pass&#44; that&#44; as the prophet says &#58; &#34; God was as an
                enemy towards us&#59;&#34; He pun&#8211; ished us severely&#44; as though He were an
                enemy&#44; as though He despised Israel&#44; but in reality only to make us feel the
                great burden of our sins&#44; to awaken us to a consideration of our fallen moral
                state&#44; and to induce us thereby to mend our ways&#44; and to return to Him&#44;
                the Lord&#44; whom we have forsaken. The refiner melts not the gold to destroy
                it&#44; but to purify it from the admixture of impure matter. Just so is the long
                captivity of the Israelites to be regarded &#8212; as a process by which the Eternal
                One endeavours to purify us from sin &#59; to restore us at the last to our land
                cleansed from our transgressions&#59; and to cause our virtue to shine with a
                tenfold greater lustre&#44; than it ever has dpne&#44; since we received the law
                from Sinai. We ought&#44; therefore&#44; to confide truly in God&#44; and always
                look forward with an unshaken and un&#8211; diminished hope to our restoration to
                the land of Israel&#44; and to abide faithful to the covenant which God made with
                our ancestors&#44; undeterred by the hatred and persecution of the gentiles. And if
                we have always done this&#44; in our state of dispersion&#44; we may then say&#44;

                    n="ii"/> WANT OF FAITH. 15 Brethren &#33; When I addressed you last&#44; I
                endeavoured to point out the necessity of confiding in God in all our trans&#8211;
                actions. If we now come to examine the nature of this confiding more closely&#44; it
                will become evident&#44; that this virtue is the parent of all other virtues&#44;
                whereas the want of it will expose us to the commis&#8211; sion of all kinds of sin.
                The man&#44; who truly confides in God&#44; will need no other incentive to the
                practice of religious duties&#59; for he will say on every occasion&#58; &#34; It is
                my God who demands the observance of this duty from me&#44; it is my Creator who
                forbids the per&#8211; petration of this act &#59; and as He asks nothing which is
                beyond my strength to accomplish&#44; and as He de&#8211; sires my happiness only
                &#58; common feelings of grati&#8211; tude compel me to obey his precepts.&#34; But
                what can the wavering man oppose to his passions &#63; He loves not his Maker&#59;
                &#8212; his God is to him as an un&#8211; known stranger&#44; and the precepts of
                the law&#44; if ob&#8211; served at all&#44; are viewed as a task&#44; a burden
                almost too heavy to be borne. An opportunity of sinning is offered to him&#44; his
                passions are roused&#44; the fear of God raises but a feeble voice of warning within
                his bosom &#58; and he falls &#8212; yes&#44; falls deeper&#44; than he had any
                reason even to expect in the first instance of his yielding to hts inclinations. For
                the path of virtue is a slippery ascent&#44; the summit of which can be reached only
                by unremitted toiling and untiring vigi&#8211; lance&#59; but wo to us&#44; if we
                confide not strongly in Him&#44; who calls encouragingly down to us from the highest
                point of elevation&#44; to despise danger and as&#8211; cend fearlessly&#59; for if
                his voice remains unheeded&#44; and we give way to our natural apprehensions&#44; we

                if we cannot catch at an impending bough or a prominent crag in our descent&#44; we
                must reach&#44; alas&#44; too soon &#33; the very bottom of the hill&#44; and thus
                &#40;to drop the met&#8211; aphor&#41; instead of being virtuous&#44; as we had
                intended to be&#44; we become depraved sinners &#8212; solely&#44; because we were
                too indolent&#44; too confiding in our own abili&#8211; ties&#44; to overcome the
                desires of a passion&#44; or the im&#8211; pulse of some unhallowed feeling&#44;
                when it was yet time to save us&#44; when a slight exertion of confidence in the
                divine guidance might yet have shielded us against all attacks of selfishness&#44;
                of avarice&#44; and of pride. And how often have we not all been the sorrow&#8211;
                ful witnesses of the fatal effects of such a want of faith&#44; as just
                described&#63; Many there were&#44; w T ho in the outset of their irreligious career
                transgressed but in some small&#44; immaterial&#44; as they thought&#44;
                ceremo&#8211; nial duty&#44; they sipped&#44; as it were&#44; but slightly of the
                poisonous bowl&#59; but point by point the duties of revelation were all
                neglected&#44; till the sinners them&#8211; selves were astonished at the distance
                which separated them from their God. Perhaps the first step was the partaking of the
                food which the law forbids to the sons of Israel &#59; then the holy day of the Lord
                was neglected&#59; anon a daughter of the stranger was chosen the companion of a
                descendant of Abraham&#44; and an abjuration of the religion promulgated by Moses
                com&#8211; pleted at length the circle of transgressions against the will of our
                Maker. And all this was caused&#44; by the want of a singleness of faith&#44; by the
                absence of an entire filial reliance on the goodness and truth of God &#59; for if a
                man does truly confide and believe&#44; he <pb n="17"/> WANT OF FAITH. 17 will have
                a great protection against sin&#44; and if he in an evil&#34; hour should
                transgress&#44; lie will hasten with contrition and sorrow to seek the forgiveness
                of the Omniscient One for the wrong he has done&#44; and en&#8211; deavour to
                deserve pardon and mercy by a more care&#8211; ful regard to the duties incumbent on
                him. But where faith is wanting&#44; where confidence does not dwell triumphant in
                the soul&#44; the passions can reign unrestrained&#59; and when sin has once got a
                hold of such a heart&#44; the course of apostacy will be pursued&#44; perhaps&#44;
                to destruction &#59; and it often happens that so strong are the bonds of
                wickedness&#44; so powerful the charms of ungodliness&#44; that the sinner perishes
                with&#8211; out atoning for his misdeeds&#44; without an endeavour to appease the
                Creator&#44; whose holy spirit he has vexed by his iniquity. This is the fruit of
                want of confidence in indivi&#8211; duals&#59; but nations also may be exposed to
                the same cause of sin&#44; and whole communities may be lost by not guarding
                themselves carefully against the attacks of pusillanimousness on the one side&#44;
                and pride and arrogance on the other. A most striking example&#44; one which is no
                doubt familiar to you all&#44; is given to us in the portion of the Law&#44; which
                we read this morning. &#8212; The Israelites had been redeemed from Egypt in a
                miraculous manner&#44; and had received the law from Sinai&#44; as a guide for them
                in all the trans&#8211; actions of life. They had also been promised&#44; that they
                should inherit the land of Canaan&#44; now known as Palestine. They were on their
                journey to this delightful country&#44; under the guidance of the great Moses&#44;
                who had been the instrument in the hand of God of effecting their deliverance. They
                ought&#44; <pb n="18"/> 18 WANT OF FAITH. therefore&#44; to have had confidence
                enough in the Power&#44; who had protected them thus far&#44; to advance boldly&#44;
                without regarding any impediment which might oppose them. But no&#44; they required
                that spies should be sent out&#44; who were to report to them the nature of the
                country&#44; so that they might be enabled &#34; to know the road they were to
                go&#44; and the cities they should come to.&#34; &#40;Deut. i. 22.&#41; Now mark the
                consequence. If the Israelites had firmly relied on God&#39;s assistance&#44; and
                had fearlessly advanced to the conquest of the holy land&#44; the very persons&#44;
                who had been redeemed from Egyptian bondage&#44; would also have been permitted to
                enjoy in Palestine all the comforts which freemen have in their own land. But owing
                to their fear of what might occur to them in their expedition&#44; they demanded
                having some previ&#8211; ous knowledge of the country. But as this desire was not
                absolutely sinful&#44; since w r e should at all times apply natural means to obtain
                natural ends&#44; and as spies are always employed to obtain all the infor&#8211;
                mation of localities and peculiar features of a coun&#8211; try to be invaded which
                can be useful to the inva&#8211; ders &#59; Moses received the sanction of God to
                send twelve men&#44; one from each tribe&#44; who should be chiefs in their own
                divisions. To these Moses gave particular directions&#44; and requested them to be
                very circumstantial in their report. After spending forty days in the survey of
                Palestine&#44; they returned to the assembled congregation&#44; and ten out of the
                twelve magnified existing dangers&#44; and invented others which existed only in
                their imagination. This was enough for the wavering multitude. They had now&#44; as
                they thought&#44; sufficient foundation for their pre&#8211; <pb n="19"/> WANT OF
                FAITH. 19 viously entertained fears&#59; they rose in tumult against the messenger
                of God&#44; and complained bitterly of their fate&#44; in being destined&#44;
                together with their wives and children&#44; to fall by the sword of the enemy&#44;
                and they even discussed the propriety of appointing a chief&#44; who should lead
                them back to Egypt&#44; where they had been held as slaves&#44; cruelly beaten&#44;
                and their children murdered. All gratitude to Moses&#44; all trust in the
                magnanimous chief&#44; were suddenly dis&#8211; sipated&#44; and they painted him in
                their fancy as an artful deceiver&#44; who had only freed them from one danger&#44;
                to make them perish by the sword of the lawless freebooters of the desert&#44; and
                the fierce popu&#8211; lation of a well&#8211;fortified country. This&#44;
                indeed&#44; was rebellion against the Almighty&#44; when men&#44; who had so largely
                partaken of his bounty&#44; could think of re&#8211; jecting the leaders whom He had
                appointed for them&#44; and talk of returning to the land of a tyrant&#44; from
                whose grasp his almighty power had but so lately saved them. Moses and his faithful
                brother were sorely grieved&#44; &#8212; they felt their inability of stemming the
                powerful opposition&#44; &#8212; they were shocked at the folly and wickedness of a
                people for w r hom they had done so much already&#44; and were willing to do even
                more &#59; and they fell upon their face before the whole congregation&#94;
                imagining perhaps&#44; that these might be restored to a proper mode of
                thinking&#44; at seeing their formerly trusted leaders prostrate before them in the
                dust. But although the multitude had thus shown how little faith w r as in them&#44;
                there were still remaining two fearless men&#44; who never had for a moment lost
                their firm conviction of the power of the Lord and their confidence in his
                providence. <pb n="20"/> 20 WANT OF FAITH. These were the renowned champions of our
                nation&#44; Joshua and Caleb&#44; who with their garments rent&#44; in order to
                prove how deeply they mourned for the un&#8211; fortunate and wicked crowd&#44;
                stepped forward from amidst the uproar and confusion&#44; endeavouring to appease
                the tumult and rebellion&#44; and thus they spoke &#40;Numb. &#94;riv.
                7&#8211;9&#41;&#58; &#34;The land through which we have passed&#44; to survey
                it&#44; this land is very good. If the Lord is pleased with us&#44; He will bring us
                into this land&#44; and give it to us&#44; a land&#44; which overfloweth with milk
                and honey. Only act not rebelliously against the Lord&#44; and then you need not
                fear the people of the land&#44; for they are our bread &#40;i. e.&#44; we can
                easily overcome them&#41; &#59; their shadow &#40;God&#39;s protection&#41; hath
                departed from them&#44; whilst the Lord is with us &#59; be you there&#8211; fore
                not afraid of them.&#34; You will observe&#44; brethren&#44; that in this address
                Joshua and Caleb wished to upbraid the people for their want of confidence in God.
                They&#44; therefore&#44; placed the land which they had visited in a promi&#8211;
                nent light before them&#44; and painted it as a country which they ought to desire
                to possess&#44; as a gift worthy to be conferred by Almighty God on his people. They
                then continued by observing&#44; that this great prize might readily be
                obtained&#44; if they would but deserve his favour&#44; by obeying his will&#59; for

                armed in&#8211; habitants into their hands&#44; although they were as yet unused to
                war. But they&#44; who had acted rebelliously towards God&#44; and ungratefully
                towards his chosen messenger&#44; would not listen to the wholesome admo&#8211;
                nitions of these two pious men&#44; nay &#8212; they even threat&#8211; ened&#44; in
                their rage&#44; to sacrifice them to their resent&#8211; ment. But&#44; see&#33; the
                glory of God was suddenly re&#8211; vealed to the sinful and sinless ones&#44; and
                the arms of the rebels were paralyzed&#44; whilst the firm adher&#8211; ents of God
                were inspired with new confidence. Many times before this&#44; the descent of the
                divine re&#8211; velation had been a sign of redemption and grace to the
                Israelites&#59; but now&#44; on the contrary&#44; the spirit of prophecy was
                revealed to Moses to announce the impending doom and suffering of the hitherto
                beloved people of God. The judgment indeed was severe&#59; but their offence had
                also been great&#44; and their desire to add murder to rebellion called loudly for
                ven&#8211; geance. And thus spoke the Most High to Moses &#58; &#34; How long will
                this people incense me&#44; and how long will they not believe in me&#44; despite of
                all the wonders which I have done in the midst of them. I will smite them with a
                pestilence and extirpate them&#44; and make thee &#40;Moses&#41; a people greater
                and mightier than they a&#42;e.&#34; We find here that God spoke&#44; as though He
                wished to exterminate the whole race of Israelites for their want of reliance upon
                his protection&#44; because of their unbelief. &#8212; Let us pause here&#44; and
                view the good leader&#44; &#40;who had been selected from the whole nation as their
                mediator with God&#44;&#41; standing before the Almighty&#44; and praying for the
                ungrateful people&#44; who had but <pb n="23"/> 22 WANT OF FAITH. just attempted to
                slay those who had remained friendly to him. He recounted the miracles which God had
                displayed amongst Israel&#44; and continued&#58; &#34; And now&#44; I pray thee&#44;
                to let thy great power be displayed&#44; O Lord&#33; as Thou hast spoken&#44;
                saying&#44; The Lord with&#8211; holdeth his anger long&#44; is full of
                kindness&#44; pardoneth sin and transgression&#44; but suffereth nothing to go
                un&#8211; punished &#59; who visiteth the sin of the fathers upon the children&#44;
                upon the third and the fourth genera&#8211; tion. O pardon Thou the sin of this
                people&#44; accord&#8211; ing to thy great kindness&#44; and as Thou hast also been
                indulgent to this people from Egypt to this place.&#34; Moses&#44; as will be
                seen&#44; expressed in this prayer his wish&#44; that the punishment of Israel might
                be averted&#44; that they might live and reform their ways&#44; so as again to
                deserve a renewal of God&#39;s favour. And great&#44; indeed&#44; is the goodness of
                God&#44; and infinite are his mercies &#33; and He answered &#58; &#34;pro &#39;nrno
                &#34; I pardon according to thy word.&#34; In this emphatic expression of Holy Writ
                &#8212; more beautiful by far than tongue can express &#8212; was announced the
                salvation of the Israel&#8211; itish people&#44; and the decree of their
                extermination revoked&#59; and those only&#44; who had at that time reached the age
                of twenty years&#44; and who had all been guilty of rebellion&#44; were doomed to
                perish in the wilderness&#44; that they might experience the dreadful
                consequences&#44; which must ensue when God withdraws his favour from man. For forty
                years they thus wandered about in the trackless wilderness&#44; and by degrees all
                perished against whom the decree had gone forth. But even from this generation the
                manifest providence of God was not withheld. Food was provided for them in

                23 bodies&#44; nor their sandals from their feet&#44; and in the most barren
                soil&#44; water was always ready for them to refresh their parched lips&#44; when
                they were almost sinking beneath the scorching heat of a cloudless sun. Thus they
                performed their pilgrimage from station to station&#44; under the doom and under the
                protection of Heaven &#59; their children grew up to manhood&#44; and the matrons of
                Yeshurun saw a new race springing up around them&#44; a race&#44; pure from foreign
                admix&#8211; ture &#8212; reared under the wise counsel and wholesome instruction of
                the father of the prophets &#8212; and destined by the will of the All&#8211;seeing
                One to inherit that land&#44; which their fathers had forfeited by their repeated
                acts of rebellion. Iu the foregoing remarks&#44; I have endeavoured to sketch&#44;
                in a few words&#44; an imperfect picture of a part of the history of our people
                &#59; an elaborate exhibition thereof would be needless&#44; since the words of
                Scrip&#8211; ture&#44; the portion&#44; namely&#44; which we have read
                to&#8211;day&#44; are so sublime&#44; that nothing is left to be added to an account
                so perfect in every respect. It only therefore remains for me to draw your attention
                to the cause of this defection and this punishment. Many&#44; no doubt&#44; among
                you&#44; will pass unqualified censure upon the conduct of our ancestors &#59; they
                will probably im&#8211; agine&#44; that t&#63;hey would not have acted so under any
                circumstances. Now it is perfectly correct&#44; that you should heartily condemn
                that which met the disap&#8211; probation and chastisement of our heavenly Father
                &#59; but do not therefore&#44; triumphing in the consciousness of your
                innocence&#44; look back with contempt upon your misguided forefathers. Let rather
                the example of their sin be a warning to you all&#44; an example&#44; re&#8211; <pb

                use&#8211; ful lesson of morality &#59; and it is your duty to reflect carefully
                upon the causes which proved their ruin&#44; that you may endeavour to escape the
                snare which produced their fall. Our ancestors transgressed&#44; be&#8211; cause
                they had no firm faith in God&#59; and so may every one of us sin&#44; if he does
                not carefully guard himself by faith and confidence in the Supreme&#44; at the very
                outset of life. For only in case we com&#8211; mence our career with the pious
                resolution of being religious&#44; only if we on every occasion place the sin&#8211;
                cerest confidence in the goodness of our Father&#44; have we some reason to hope
                that we may&#44; like Joshua and Caleb&#44; remain firm and true to the cause of
                re&#8211; ligion&#44; even when all around us swerve from the way of righteousness
                &#59; and only by a meek resignation to God&#39;s decrees&#44; free from any
                overweening pride&#44; which would prompt us to display our piety to the world in
                order to show how much better we are than others&#44; can we hope to be rewarded
                with the peculiar favour of God&#44; as were these two pious men&#44; whose history
                we have read in this day&#39;s portion. &#8212; But if&#44; on the other hand&#44; w
                T e commence in early youth a life of dis&#8211; sipation&#44; pushing the
                admonitions of conscience with both hands&#44; as it were&#44; from us &#59; if the

                3 <pb n="26"/> 26 PIOUS ENERGY. Brethren &#33; In all things which a man
                undertakes&#44; a certain degree of activity&#44; promptness&#44; and decision is
                neces&#8211; sary&#44; without which the best laid plans must be un&#8211;
                successful. The merchant thus in the pursuit of his business&#44; always endeavours
                to secure to himself the earliest custom&#44; and is ever apprehensive&#44; lest
                another should forestall him in a certain transaction&#44; or alto&#8211; gether
                prevent him from participating therein. &#8212; The mechanic tries to finish his
                wares in due time&#44; that he may be enabled to meet the expected demand as early
                as any other of his craft&#44; and in order to draw upon himself a great share of
                public attention&#44; he strives to improve upon former models&#44; and invent new
                and useful things. &#8212; The man of learning&#44; in his endeavours to push
                himself forward&#44; employs all his energy to claim a share of public
                patronage&#44; and is always solicitous that no one shall despoil him of the
                honours&#44; which he conceives to be his due. &#8212; The soldier&#44; who is
                entrusted with the command of an army&#44; is ever on the alert to discover where
                and when he can strike a decisive blow &#59; and he would think himself highly
                blameworthy&#44; were he to suffer him&#8211; self to be anticipated&#44; or to be
                taken by surprise by the enemy. All the classes of men just enumerated&#44; and all
                others engaged in various other pursuits&#44; think themselves bound to aim at being
                successful in their respective stations&#44; and they accordingly regard not any
                labour as too great&#44; nor any exertion as too troublesome&#44; which may promote
                their several ob&#8211; jects. &#8212; We thus see&#44; that in all concerns of
                life&#44; where worldly success is the goal&#44; and the distinction for riches&#44;
                skill&#44; fame&#44; and bravery the stake&#44; the desired <pb n="27"/> PIOUS
                ENERGY. 27 end will stimulate man to do all he can to deserve and insure a fortunate
                consummation. But if we take a calm view of all earthly blessings&#44; of whatever
                may be apportioned to us here&#44; we must inevitably be struck with their
                uncertainty of dura&#8211; tion and the small share of real enjoyment they can
                aiford&#44; even if possessed in their fullest extent. If then the acquisition of
                these demands so much per&#8211; severance and application&#44; how much more should
                we exert our energies in searching for those things&#44; the possession of which is
                permanent&#44; and which af&#8211; ford us imperishable enjoyment&#63; I allude&#44;
                as you no doubt are already aware&#44; to the acquisition of pious feelings and the
                practice of virtuous deeds&#59; since these are they&#44; which confer upon us&#44;
                in what&#8211; ever part of the world&#44; in whatever state of life we may be&#44;
                the most lasting and unalloyed enjoyment&#59; for piety will solace the mind even in
                affliction&#44; and the consciousness of having done our duty&#44; and of having
                accumulated a stock of virtuous deeds&#44; will at all times give us a sincere
                pleasure &#8212; a pleasure unmixed by regret or compunctions of conscience. But to
                acquire virtue we must also make great exer&#8211; tions &#59; for if we remain
                inactive in this pursuit&#44; if we are careless of&#94;what means we employ&#44; or
                fearful of outward circumstances&#44; we can never become virtu&#8211; ous &#59; for
                know &#33; that unless we strain every nerve to conquer our sinful propensities&#44;
                we can never hope of beino&#8211; ultimately that&#44; for which the Lord of all has
                destined us. Because there is so much to dis&#8211; tract our attention&#44; so many
                circumstances calcula&#8211; ted to lead us&#44; if I may use the expression&#44;
                into the by&#8211;paths of religion&#44; that a constant vigilance&#44; and <pb

                of ourselves become absolutely necessary to preserve us pure while we are yet
                innocent&#44; or to restore us to the love of our God&#44; if we have once strayed
                from the road which He has marked out to us as the way of everlasting life and
                happiness. But if we allow ourselves to be called away by outward circum&#8211;
                stances&#44; be they those of fancied necessity or invit&#8211; ing pleasure&#44; if
                we&#44; only for a brief space of time&#44; actually cease to watch our desires and
                to combat our passions &#58; we must sin from mere thoughtless&#8211; ness&#44; and
                we may thus become gradually depraved and be led into the depth of wickedness&#44;
                without even heeding that we are treading the path of death. But independently of
                carelessness&#44; there is another fruitful cause of transgression &#8212; the idle
                fear of ridi&#8211; cule&#44; which is apt to exercise&#44; alas &#33; a very
                baneful influence over the opinions of many&#44; who are not yet initiated in
                vice&#44; nor firmly established in piety. There is a considerable number of
                men&#44; even among those endowed with a high degree of intellect&#44; who are
                always afraid of incurring the ridicule of those they are placed amongst&#44; and
                they will accordingly omit doing many things for fear of this derision of their
                associates. This is chiefly the case with young persons that associate with those of
                their own age&#44; who are heedless and extravagant&#44; and&#44; as they call it
                themselves&#44; gay and cheerful. Yet this gayety and this cheerfulness are not of
                that harmless kind which is the offspring of conscious innocence&#44; but consist of
                a certain indulgence in dissipation and an occa&#8211; sional deviation from
                religious duties&#44; which these gay young people often permit themselves under the
                    <pb n="29"/> PIOUS ENERGY. 29 excuse &#58; &#34; It is time enough to grow more
                serious when we grow older.&#34; A timid person coming in contact with such society
                is very apt to be withheld from pursuing the virtuous bent of his own inclina&#8211;
                tions&#44; and is often induced to take part in their dis&#8211; sipation solely
                from fear of being called by them a dull fellow&#44; or an unsociable being &#59;
                and&#44; therefore&#44; the want of moral courage may be the cause of his becoming
                every hour more withdrawn from the path of righteousness&#44; and of being numbered
                at the last amongst the dissolute and worthless&#44; whose only aim is to live for
                the gratification of their passions&#44; and who pride themselves at not being
                checked in their downward course by those little restraints which the religious part
                of mankind willingly impose upon their desires. &#8212; Having premised thus
                much&#44; let us next proceed to the consideration of the following&#44; from the
                fifth chapter of the Proverbs of the Fathers &#58; &#34; Yehudah son of Thaymah said
                &#58; Be as bold as the tiger&#44; fleet as the eagle&#44; swift as the deer&#44;
                and strong as the lion&#44; to do the will of thy Father that fe in heaven.&#34; To
                explain the intent of this sage advice&#44; let us investigate briefly the causes
                which withhold many persons from the practice of virtue. Some are afraid to act
                according to their own conviction &#59; the 7 fancy that they will expose themselves
                to the hatred of their powerful irreligious neighbours &#59; or they expect to
                3&#42; <pb n="30"/> 30 PIOUS ENERGY. derive a benefit from some one&#44; if they
                agree with him in outward conformity to certain rites and cere&#8211; monies &#59;
                or&#44; as said already&#44; they fear to encounter the ridicule of the
                thoughtless&#59; and from one or all of these circumstances combined they practise
                the evil&#44; not perhaps from any love of sin itself&#44; but from mere
                faintheartedness or motives of interest&#44; their moral courage not being strong
                enough to enable them to combat the misgivings of fear&#44; or the crav&#8211; ings
                of worldly gain. To men like these the moral&#8211; ist says &#58; &#34; Be as bold
                as the tiger to do the will of thy Father in heaven &#33;&#34; Regard not the hatred
                of the powerful&#44; despise the sneers of the godless&#44; turn a deaf ear to the
                inducement which strangers to God&#39;s worship and seducers may hold out&#44; and
                defy all boldly&#44; as the tiger defies the attacks of all other animals&#44; and
                only obey the will of your Father that is in heaven. Let his fear always be upon you
                &#59; and reflect that his power is greater by far than that of the most powerful
                man. Why then should you fear mortals more &#63; Consider that He takes no frivolous
                excuses as a justification of your follies. Why then should the laughter of foolish
                sinners withdraw you from this service &#63; Know also&#44; that this bounty and
                beneficence are as unlimited as his power. Why then should hopes of gain or the
                expectation of being actually paid for apostacy&#44; be any inducement to you to
                neglect your duties&#44; and prevent you from follow&#8211; ing the divine
                precepts&#44; which were given to pro&#8211; mote your own happiness&#63; There is
                another class of men whose delight is to see every thing&#44; and whose curiosity
                prompts them to investigate every transaction of life&#44; and to study <pb n="31"/>
                PIOUS ENERGY. 31 every kind of society &#58; they think it will improve them&#44;
                and give them a knowledge of character&#44; and an insight into the motives and
                doings of men. And really it must be confessed&#44; that such a curiosity&#44; when
                properly exercised&#44; must give us a knowledge of human nature both necessary and
                agreeable&#44; which can hardly be obtained in any other way than by ac&#8211; tual
                personal observation. Still if it be not properly controlled&#44; it has also a
                great disadvantage&#44; as it is apt to make us familiar with vice&#59; for if we
                are in&#8211; discriminately curious&#44; we may be led to seek bad so&#8211;
                ciety&#44; in order to understand that also thoroughly&#44; and to know whatever is
                committed there. But it must be remembered that&#44; if we enter the company of the
                wicked&#44; and repeat our visits often&#44; we are very apt to lose tlS horror we
                at first felt for the follies we see practised there &#58; we become&#44; as it
                were&#44; ena&#8211; moured of what we once so thoroughly detested&#44; and we fall
                by degrees into the pit&#44; which we approached merely from idle curiosity&#44; and
                which we might have easily avoided&#44; if we had but kept in the right way&#44;
                regardless of its existence. Again&#44; some belonging to this class make a trial of
                vice from mere curiosity&#44; imagining&#44; that it will be easy for them to leave
                off whenever the&#94; may feel inclined&#59; but they forget that vice lays&#39;
                hold of a man&#39;s mind&#44; blinds his under&#8211; standing and warps his
                judgment&#44; and that it does require the greatest exertions to throw off evil
                habits when once acquired&#59; and they do not reflect&#44; that evil habits are
                soon contracted&#44; and that one trans&#8211; gression is generally the forerunner
                of another. Some also think that they may safely skim lightly over the surface of
                sin&#59; that they may with impunity <pb n="33"/> 32 PIOUS ENERGY. be guilty of the
                lesser moral offences &#59; but they are like those that play carelessly at the edge
                of some frightful precipice&#44; heedless of danger&#44; yet suddenly their head
                becomes giddy&#44; their sight fails&#44; and they fall unresistingly almost into
                the jaws of destruction. This precisely is the case of those&#44; who think
                them&#8211; selves secure in the habitual commission of some small errors&#44; and
                believe themselves not guilty of any crime by so doing&#59; but suddenly&#44;
                perhaps un&#8211; consciously to themselves&#44; they may plunge into real vice&#44;
                when nothing can save them but a speedy re&#8211; pentance&#44; which&#44; however
                distasteful to their self&#8211;love&#44; must be vigorously pursued&#44; if they at
                all desire to recover their lost innocence. Rabbi Yehudah there&#8211; fore advises
                all men &#58; &#34; Be as fleet as the eagle to do the will of thy Father in heaven
                &#33;&#34; mining&#44; be par&#8211; ticularly watchful over your conduct&#44;
                direct an eagle&#39;s gaze upon all your doings and the conduct of those around you
                &#59; and be as fleet to escape from every vice&#44; as the eagle is to escape from
                the arrow of the bowman&#44; who threatens to take his life &#59; and rest not in
                your upward career&#44; till you have reached an ele&#8211; vation whence you can
                look down with the utmost safety upon all on earth&#44; which then will appear
                little and unimportant at the immeasurable distance be&#8211; neath you&#44; just as
                every thing must appear to the eagle&#44; when he has winged his proud way far above
                the clouds of the firmament. A third class of persons may be denominated the
                indifferent or the careless&#59; they are not actually bad&#8211; hearted or badly
                inclined&#44; but indifferent about the practice of virtue &#59; and when they are

                gift is accompanied with some chilling remark to the poor mendicant&#44; and they
                perhaps suffer their callousness to overcome their good feelings so far&#44; as to
                tell a crippled&#44; unfortunate old man &#58; &#34; You had better try to obtain
                some work to maintain yourself&#44; without troubling others about your wants.&#34;
                The house of God is opened&#44; and many flock thither to offer up their prayers to
                their heavenly Protector&#59; but the indifferent man cannot think of doin&#94;
                likewise&#44; for as yet he is not convinced that this is his business. To all such
                &#94;rsons the advice is given &#58; &#34; Be as swift as the deer to do the wull of
                thy Father in heaven &#33;&#34; Just as the panting deer flies to the running brook
                to cool his burning thirst&#44; thus do you also fly to the observance of the divine
                precepts&#44; and endeavour to convince yourselves that it is your business&#44; nay
                the chief business of your life&#44; to do whatever religion demands of you. &#34;

                your sincere and heartfelt prayer rise up as an ac&#8211; ceptable offering to your

                and who are even not indifferent to pious actions&#44; are yet too indolent to
                attempt doing what their sense of jus&#8211; tice demands&#59; because it would cost
                them too much&#44; labour&#44; or because it might perhaps interfere with their
                personal ease. They are&#44; therefore&#44; continually praising the good they see
                done by others&#44; but are themselves always absent&#44; whenever anything
                de&#8211; mands their personal aid. Yet positive sin&#44; as well as negative
                evil&#44; may be the result of this want of activity. For the indolent man may be
                placed in a society&#44; where many are found who habitually deviate from the
                commandments of our holy rqj&#124;gion&#59; he sees their conduct&#44; and perhaps
                detests it at first&#59; but he does not take the requisite trouble to prevent the
                evil example having a bad effect upon himself. And as it is so very easy to do as
                others do&#44; but so hard to make a stand where one may be left to act by
                him&#8211; self alone&#44; a man of the kind we are describing may be misled by the
                example set before him&#44; and induced to sin likewise&#44; merely because he
                cannot rouse him&#8211; self to an increased degree of activity&#44; when this very
                activity is the only means to preserve him in the path of religion. So too&#44; he
                may hear of a distressed family&#44; and even may feel deeply for their
                condition&#59; but he cannot think of going immediately to their relief&#44;
                for&#44; again&#44; it would be too much trouble &#58; &#34; It rains

                perchance&#44; it may be clear&#44; one day can make no dif&#8211; ference&#44; and

                am almost certain their distress has been represented to me in exaggerated colours

                may die from want of proper assistance&#44; and the tardy charity comes thus too
                late. &#8212; But if tardi&#8211; ness should even not have such terrible
                consequences&#44; we nevertheless can perceive its vexations effects in every
                day&#39;s occurrences &#59; for the hour of worship arrives&#44; but the indolent
                has time enough yet to wait&#44; and he appears at the house of prayer&#44; when the
                service is nearly over. At funerals he arrives&#44; when his assistance is no longer
                wanted&#59; and so in fact it happens&#44; that at every religious meeting he is
                entirely useless&#44; because he is always too late&#59; and on occa&#8211; sions
                when activity is required to effect some good purpose&#44; his aM is never

                national glory. This is the season in which calamity after calamity burst over our
                heads&#44; and this is the time of year in which the temple was twice destroyed.
                Once&#44; we lived happily in the land of Israel&#44; &#8212; once&#44; we had a
                govern&#8211; ment instituted and favoured by the God of heaven and earth&#44;
                &#8212; once&#44; we had a temple in which we as&#8211; sembled three times every

                JERUSALEM. 39 which our religion does not recognize&#44; &#8212; we are with&#8211;
                out a temple&#44; and the priest of God no longer sacri&#8211; fices at the
                altar&#44; and the grateful smoke of incense no longer curls upward under the hand
                of the holy minister. All has been lost&#44; the glory of Israel has departed&#44;
                and the descendants of Jacob mourn in a far&#8211;off land. &#8212; This is a
                brief&#44; but true&#44; sketch of the state of our people&#44; who suffer all
                this&#44; because they disobeyed the will of their God&#44; who had proved so often
                his almighty power before them. &#8212; Nothing&#44; therefore&#44; should excite
                greater and more poignant regret within us&#44; than the remembrance of what we were
                once&#44; and the reflection of what we are now. Once the envy of all the
                surrounding nations &#8212; now an abhorrence to all beholders&#59; once feared by
                the most powerful and warlike families of the East &#8212; now a weak remnant&#44;
                left to the mercy of every oppressor&#59; once living in a common land&#44; speaking
                one language&#44; and united by one beloved government &#8212; now scat&#8211;
                tered&#44; speaking different tongues&#44; and obeying the will and conforming to
                the caprice of every people of the world. Indeed&#44; has Judah fallen&#44;
                indeed&#44; is Israel sorely afflicted&#44; because they incurred the wrath of
                Heaven. Do but compare the animating account which sacred &#34;history furnishes of
                the glorious epoch of our peopfe in David&#39;s time&#44; when the Syrians&#44;
                Idumeans&#44; Phoenicians&#44; and the children of Lot&#44; besides many other
                tribes&#44; either succumbed to the arms of the anointed of the Lord&#44; or
                propitiated his favour by presents and friendly alliances &#8212; with the woful
                catastrophe of the destruction of the holy city&#44; when enemies&#44; even the
                rudest and most barbarous of all Asiatics&#44; traversed the land&#44; burnt the
                cities&#44; <pb n="40"/> 40 THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM. slew the inhabitants&#44;
                and spared neither the aged counsellor&#44; nor the bridegroom leading forth his
                bride&#44; nor the infant in its mother&#39;s arms. All was then swallowed up in one
                indiscriminate destruction&#44; and those whom the devouring pestilence had suffered
                to survive&#44; were mowed down by the unsheathed sword of the hating adversary.
                &#8212; All this happened&#44; because our ancestors had transgressed the covenant
                of the Lord &#59; because they had refused to listen to the warning voice of his
                prophets&#44; whom He had sent to announce the impending calamity&#59; because the
                priest and prophet had been slain&#44; as he lifted up his voice to denounce the
                backsliding of his brethren. It was&#44; therefore&#44; that the threatened
                vengeance was meted out&#44; and this was the reason why the children of Judah were
                led forth as captives before the enemy. One pre&#8211;eminently distinguished among
                the mes&#8211; sengers of the Lord&#44; both for the sufferings he had to
                endure&#44; and for the almost unparalleled firmness with which he executed his
                heavenly mission&#44; was the prophet Jeremiah&#44; who both foretold the
                destruction of the temple&#44; and witnessed the accomplishment of the dire
                foreboding. &#8212; His was a heart alive to all the finer feelings of human
                nature&#44; and his mind was filled with the sublimest conceptions of religion&#44;
                and his soul was animated by a sincere love towards his countrymen. He had seen the
                greatness of his peo&#8211; ple&#44; &#8212; he had seen the turrets of Jerusalem
                presenting their bright pinnacles to the rising sun&#44; &#8212; he had seen the

                the temple in flames&#33; He beheld it with inexpressi&#8211; ble anguish&#44; and
                thus he began his complaint &#8212; a complaint which must ever be regarded as the
                most splendid of lamentations&#58; &#34;Ha&#33; how sitteth she so solitary&#44; the
                city that was so populous&#44; she hath become like a widow &#59; the great among

                1. In these words the prophet gives vent to his over&#8211; charged feelings&#59; he
                addresses Jerusalem&#44; the city that once had been so populous&#44; so great&#44;
                and so powerful&#59; and contrasting her then with her former state&#44; he
                exclaims&#58; &#34;How sitteth she so solitary&#33;&#34; Jeremiah had seen the
                youths of Israel go forth to battle&#44; had seen the mighty population of Jerusalem
                hasten out to the tight&#44; to strike for Gad and his holy temple&#59; but he had
                also beheld the flower of his people cliscomfitted&#44; their valour wasted in
                vain&#44; the remnant of the afflicted led into captivity&#44; the temple of God
                levelled to the ground&#44; the streets of Jerusalem rendered desolate&#44; and the
                houses left without an in&#8211; habitant. Jeremiah&#44; therefore&#44;
                continues&#58; &#34;Let her weep at nights&#44; &#8212; let her tears be on her
                cheek&#44; she hath no comforter among all her friends&#44; all her asso&#8211;

                former times&#44; would be arrayed against us in the time of our affliction&#59; but
                that our allies&#44; those who had always preserved the appearance of
                friendship&#44; should be found untrue when their assistance was most needed&#44;
                was more than even fear excited to the utmost appre&#8211; hension could have
                conceived as probable&#59; neverthe&#8211; less&#44; it so happened&#44; and it
                appeared as though all the nations had colleagued to assist in our downfall&#44; and
                to rejoice over our misfortune. Therefore&#44; says the prophet &#58; &#34; Let her
                weep&#44; she hath no comforter among all her friends &#8212; they have become her
                enemies&#33;&#34; Ration vied with nation to oppress us&#44; and the com&#8211; mon
                consent of mankind seemed to have taken from us the rights of humanity. Who thought
                it wrong to maltreat an Israelite &#63; Who thought it riffht to extend to us relief
                in the hour of our distress&#63; &#34;No one &#8212; and every bowman sent his
                arrows against our bared bosom&#44; every swordsman dyed his blade in the blood of

                sorrows&#44; they made their voices resound with the discordant shouts of triumph in
                the house of God&#44; and they asked of the exiles to sing to them some of the songs
                of Zion. But&#44; says the prophet&#58; &#34;Jerusalem hath severely sinned&#44;
                therefore hath she become an outcast&#59;&#34; it was in judgment for the manifold
                sins of Israel&#44; that all these calamities occurred&#59; and&#44; says Jeremiah

                forgetful&#8211; ness&#44; although his anger and his vengeance may long appear to
                slumber. Instructive as doubtless it would be to analyze the remainder of the book
                of Lamentations&#44; I am fearful of approaching the task&#59; since the words of
                the pro&#8211; phet are so lucid and moving&#44; and the whole diction so
                splendid&#44; that their beauty must be marred by an attempt to abridge them&#44;
                and but little can be added by way of comment on the text. But there is one passage
                in the third chapter which demands our espe&#8211; cial attention &#59; I allude to
                the expression of confident reliance upon the unaltered promise of God&#44; which is
                in the following words&#58; &#34;This will I reflect on in rny heart&#44; therefore
                will I hope. The kindness of God will not let us be annihilated&#44; for his mercies
                are with&#8211; out ending.&#34; You will no doubt recollect&#44; that God had
                promised through Jeremiah&#44; that the captivity of the Israelites living under the
                dominion of the king of Judah was to endure only for seventy years. He therefore
                expressed his confidence in the certainty of the fulfilment&#44; although at that
                moment there appeared but little likelihood of its accomplishment&#59; saying&#44;
                Let the enemy even prevail&#44; let all the punishment denounced be visited on our
                heads&#44; let our children be led captives into the enemy&#39;s land &#58; yet am I
                con&#8211; fident that the nation of the Lord will not cease to be a nation&#44; for
                his mercies are unending&#59; He pun&#8211; ishes the sin&#44; but will not utterly
                destroy the sinners&#59; <pb n="44"/> 44 THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM. the sons of
                Abraham have transgressed&#44; but they will not be entirely cut off&#44; because
                God has promised that his descendants should ever be a people&#44; and lie would
                ever be their God. Jeremiah&#39;s hopes were not un&#8211; founded &#59; it is
                true&#44; that he &#8212; the patriot and seer &#8212; descended to the grave in the
                land of Egypt&#44; far from his beloved and lamented Jerusalem &#8212; his eyes&#44;
                there&#8211; fore&#44; never witnessed this consolation which he had announced in
                the name of God &#59; yet the prophecy itself was fulfilled&#44; and when the time
                predicted had expired&#44; the redeemed Jews returned to their land&#44; though in a
                feeble state and few in number. They rebuilt the temple&#44; although the one
                destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar had been much more splendid&#44; and the worship
                &#34;was restored under Ezra and his associ&#8211; ates &#59; and the Jews lived in
                their inheritance for many years&#44; at first under the protection of the powerful
                kings of Persia and the Grecian princes of Egypt and Syria&#44; and afterwards under
                chiefs of their own brethren. But&#44; alas&#33; dissension and internal warfare
                broke out where peace and harmony should have reigned&#44; &#8212; brother imbrued
                his hand in a brother&#39;s blood&#44; and the streets of the holy city were dyed
                with the blood of priests&#44; of elders&#44; and of innocent men&#59; and even
                strangers&#44; the Romans namely&#44; were called in to settle the fierce disputes
                which brothers carried on for the supreme authority over a land di&#8211; vided into
                implacable factions. The Israelites were again ripe for a severe retribution for
                their sins&#44; and these very Romans&#44; who had been in the first instance
                invited to act as umpires&#44; where no dispute should have existed&#44; encroached
                by degrees upon the inde&#8211; pendence of the people&#44; and at length they sent

                reign amongst the Jews&#44; and every man sought only his own aggrandizement&#44;
                instead of endeavouring to rid the country of the common enemy. And could such a
                people maintain long the shadow of an inde&#8211; pendence&#44; which the courtesy
                or the scorn of the proud and insidious Romans had left them &#63; Could such a
                nation expect to receive that aid from above&#44; with which their ancestors had so
                often overcome nations greater and mightier than themselves &#63; Could
                assassins&#44; I ask&#44; dare to look for such assistance &#63; Could those who
                bought and sold the exalted office of high&#8211;priest&#44; which was to be the

                decisions of the courts of justice were reviewed by the proconsul&#59; and the
                crimes withal of the Jews had been so great&#44; that the wrath of Heaven and the
                punishment of their sins could no longer be delayed&#59; and thus it was that the
                blood of the innocent&#44; slaughtered to satisfy the revengeful feelings of
                ambitious rivals&#44; was amply revenged. It is needless to relate to you in detail
                the history of the Roman oppressions&#44; and the man&#8211; ner in which the
                war&#44; that ended in our downfall&#44; was commenced&#44; and the way in which it

                DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM. which are given of the devotion of the Israelites in their
                defence of the house of God. They were&#44; it is true&#44; great sinners&#59; the
                hands of some were stained by murder&#58; yet their devoted patriotism in that awful
                struggle&#44; where every man became a tower&#44; and every bosom a wall of
                defence&#44; deserves our admiration&#44; and we ought even to cherish the warmest
                feelings&#44; I almost may say&#44; of gratitude&#44; when recalling the noble
                exertions which they made in the holy cause. But alas&#33; all was in vain&#59; as
                already said&#44; the sins of the people had been too great&#44; and God could not
                suffer any longer his children to pollute by their pres&#8211; ence the land which
                He had promised them on the sole condition&#44; that they should prove obedient to
                his will. Therefore&#44; it came to pass&#44; that the enemy pre&#8211; vailed. On
                the seventeenth day of Thamuz&#44; the Ro&#8211; mans penetrated into the city&#59;
                but even then the war raided fiercelv&#44; and the lion of Judah would not yield to
                the opposing force&#44; however superior. And mothers slaughtered their children to
                appease their gnawing hunger &#8212; merciful fathers strove to prolong a miserable
                existence by devouring the flesh of their tender offspring&#58; &#8212; yet the Jews
                would not surrender to the merciless foe. The clashing of swords daily grew louder
                in the streets of the devoted city &#8212; the tumult of war raged wilder and wilder
                in every ave&#8211; nue&#58; yet the emaciated remnant stood firm&#44; and
                dis&#8211; played a heroism&#44; which we shortsighted mortals might say to have
                deserved a better fate. But He&#44; whose throne is in heaven&#44; in his unerring
                wisdom had decreed it otherwise&#44; and the desperate fights in the heart of the
                city were but like the violent throbs of the heart of the expiring giant&#44;

                crushed&#44; and walls crumbled into dust&#44; whilst the bodies of the defenders
                covered the spots where they stood&#44; and the corpses of the priests were thrown
                in heaps around the altar&#44; and the floor of the temple was made slippery with
                the gore of the victims&#44; and headless trunks and severed limbs were strewn
                about&#44; and the wild shout of the heartless soldier was heard above the noise of

                not to feel sorrow on the anniversary of the destruction of our national government.
                But let those who feel in their hearts that they are Israelites indeed&#44; assemble
                on the mourn&#8211; ful day&#44; with a contrite heart and devotional feelings&#44;

                times of Titus&#44; in every age&#44; we were ex&#8211; posed to persecutions for
                the sake of our faith &#59; we were summoned to forswear our belief in One Al&#8211;
                mighty God&#44; and almost every nation has been by turns one of those who
                endeavoured to make us feel the more strongly the weight of our chains. But thanks
                to our Protector&#44; and God&#44; and Saviour from destruction &#33; all their
                counsel was rendered to nought. They strove hard to accomplish their end&#44;
                &#8212; they mur&#8211; dered multitudes of innocents&#59; but all in vain&#44; for
                we are yet&#44; even unto this day&#44; a people&#44; one and pe&#8211; culiar&#44;
                a monument of the greatness of God&#44; and an imperishable sign of his providence

                power of God mani&#8211; fested in a thousand different ways. Miracles are daily
                performed before our eyes&#44; we see prodigies ex&#8211; isting around us&#44; hut
                we pass them by without heed&#8211; ing them &#59; for they are too familiar to
                us&#44; we are too well acquainted with them&#44; wherefore they cease to interest
                us. You see daily the tide ebb and flow&#44; the fact is evident to you &#59; but
                this receding and advancing of the waters does not strike you as miraculous&#44;
                un&#8211; less you set out resolved to think on and ponder over the greatness of the
                works of God. But not so the inhabitant of the shores of the Mediterranean Sea&#59;
                he has a vast sheet of water before his eyes&#44; but it neither rises nor falls
                like the other seas&#59; and the first time&#44; therefore&#44; he views this
                wonderful phenomenon at a distance from his home&#44; he must stand astonished and
                awe&#8211;struck at the great wonder. &#8212; To the inhabitant of an alpine region
                the stupendous granite walls&#44; which on all sides surround him&#44; are an
                every&#8211;day&#39;s sight&#44; and he loses all knowledge of their wonderful
                majesty by roving among them at pleasure. But place the lowlander amidst these grand
                structures of God&#39;s potent creative word&#44; and an expression of delightful
                surprise will unconsciously escape him&#44; when he ex&#8211; claims in the ecstacy

                bright flash of the light&#8211; ning&#44; would perhaps be ridiculed for his

                upon all the wonders of crea&#8211; tion&#44; &#8212; if we view the regularity with
                which the tides rise and fall&#44; &#8212; if we take a glance at the

                earth fruitful and habitable&#44; &#8212; if we listen with awed silence&#44; as
                becomes mortals when the Supreme sends forth his voice&#44; to the loud roar of the
                desolating tempest &#58; we must be filled with ad&#8211; miration at the goodness
                and potency of the great Creator&#44; who has so wisely ordained all to work for a
                beneficent end&#44; in harmony and concert. And if we next come to contemplate&#44;
                if even for a moment&#44; on our own un worthiness&#44; and consider how often we
                have by our misconduct incensed the Holy Spirit.&#58; we must be struck dumb with
                awe and reverence&#44; on account of the forbearance we have experienced from that
                Almighty Being who&#44; though so powerful beyond expression&#44; is yet so
                indulgent to the sinful worms&#44; that crawl&#44; as it were&#44; in the dust
                before him. Some one perhaps there is&#44; who doubts the watchful&#8211; ness of
                Providence over all the doings of the children of man&#59; but do we not daily see
                that justice is done in the worlds that hidden crimes are brought to light &#63;
                that innocence is protected against the spite&#8211; ful malice of powerful vice
                &#63; It is true&#44; that we lose sight of the miraculous part of the
                occurrence&#59; we ascribe the result to a chain of circumstances&#44; to the

                directed is totally concealed from its knowledge &#63; Do we not rather discern here
                the rays of the providential light&#44; which illumine even darkness itself&#63; But
                this is not precisely the subject to which I would call your attention this day.
                brethren&#44; and I only introduced it to show how much matter of as&#8211;
                tonishment&#44; and how many motives for adoration can be discovered all around us.
                At present&#44; however&#44; I wish to draw your especial attention to
                yourselves&#44; to your existence as a people&#59; for it may freely be said&#44;
                that you are a standing miracle&#44; one in whom the finger of God is preeminently
                displayed. A time there was&#44; we assert&#44; when God bestowed upon the blessed
                patriarch Jacob&#44; the name of Israel&#44; as an especial gift&#44; to denote&#44;
                that the lowly righteous&#44; even in affliction&#44; was a favourite of his
                Maker&#59; &#8212; we maintain that the Most High made known his laws and his
                statutes to Jacob&#39;s descendants&#44; that they might love and fear Him all the
                days&#59; and we believe&#44; that God has promised again and again&#44; through his
                servants&#44; the prophets&#44; that this people&#44; so descended and so
                blessed&#44; should always be preserved through every danger and through every
                difficulty. &#8212; And&#44; brethren&#44; years and ages have rolled on&#44; and

                thousand years have elapsed&#44; and the promise has not been forgotten &#59; for we

                law&#44; and the objects of this cheering promise&#44; &#8212; we are&#44; in

                witnesses of God&#39;s miraculous providence on earth&#44; a living testi&#8211;
                monial of the truth of Revelation. For in vain do unbelievers endeavour to account
                in a natural way for our continued existence&#59; in vain do they aver&#44; that we
                have simply existed a long while&#44; and that we&#44; like other nations&#44;
                sprung up under the guidance of a leader and legislator. But can it be asserted with
                seriousness&#44; that this does reasonably account for our being as we are even unto
                this day&#63; Say&#44; where are the children of Solon &#63; where the tribes of

                And&#44; indeed&#44; brethren&#44; there is no fear that our religion can ever be
                injured by any thing that man can do &#33; Have not tyrants oppressed us in
                vain&#44; times without number&#63; Have not priests forced their doctrines upon us
                with the faggot&#44; the sword&#44; the gibbet&#44; and the rack &#63; Have not

                we are here&#44; that monument of the wisdom of God&#44; which we were destined to
                be. &#8212; In the same spirit did our great teacher&#44; Moses&#44; speak&#44; when
                his life was drawing to a close&#44; and when he was permitted for the last time to
                address his beloved people&#44; and to admonish them to practise those laws which he
                had been sent to teach unto them. These are his words &#40;Deut. iv. 6&#8211;8&#41;

                great nation cannot be other&#8211; wise than a wise and intelligent people. For
                where is that nation&#44; be it ever so great&#44; to whom God is so near&#44; as
                our God&#44; whenever we call on Him&#63; And where is that nation&#44; be it ever
                so great&#44; that has such just statutes and codes&#44; as all this law&#44; which
                I lay be&#8211; fore you this day&#63;&#34; Let us understand the meaning of this
                assertion of Moses &#59; he did not intend to express&#44; that every human being
                would show his admiration of the beau&#8211; tiful code which we possess by a strict
                obedience to its precepts &#59; but that every member of the human family would&#44;
                when made acquainted with its behests&#44; acknowledge&#44; in words at least&#44;
                that the laws of the Israelites contain wise and just statutes. We need&#44;
                therefore&#44; not fear that any reasonable argument can be drawn against our
                religion from the fact&#44; that but a small portion of mankind acknowledge this
                religion&#44; nor from the often repeated apostacies of the Jews themselves&#59; for
                the legislator did nowhere say&#44; that he came to legislate for any other
                people&#44; save the Israelites&#44; and those who might voluntarily join them &#59;
                and of the apostacy of the Jews&#44; and of their frequent rebellions&#44; he has
                left us the testimony of his own w&#94;ords recorded in the Pentateuch&#44; by the
                express command of God. &#8212; It is&#8211; not&#44; therefore&#44; on account of
                the great number of Israelites&#44; nor from their pre&#8211; eminent piety&#44;
                that we so confidently claim a diviiie origin for our religion &#59; it is&#94;

                traordinary theory of government which it discloses&#44; and the elevated knowledge
                of the divine attributes which it imparts&#44; that compel us&#44; even against our
                will&#44; to confess that no human mind was ever capable of reaching a state of such
                perfection as to enable it to produce a structure so noble&#44; and so well fitted
                in all its parts&#44; and so well adapted to accomplish the objects for which it was
                intended. It therefore came to pass&#44; that in every age&#44; the eyes of all the
                world were turned upon our code and upon us&#44; to whom it was entrusted.
                Unimportant as some of us&#44; perhaps&#44; may regard this heavenly gift&#44; it is
                nevertheless that&#44; from which the world has derived the greatest bene&#8211;
                fits. For look around you with the eye of inquiry&#44; and you will be struck with
                the conviction&#44; that wherever the Bible is carried&#44; civilization does
                fol&#8211; low in its track. It dispels&#44; as it were&#44; the darkness of
                superstition &#59; the shackles of tyranny are by it rent asunder&#59; and man is by
                it taught to raise his eyes to One God&#44; and to know himself as a being destined
                by this Omnipotent Power&#44; his Creator&#44; for a state of uninterrupted
                happiness. Am I overrating the force which the word of God exercises over the hearts
                of men&#63; I imagine not&#59; and whatever the subtle soph&#8211; ist may advance
                to the contrary notwithstanding&#44; it is undoubted&#44; that the world has been
                taught true wisdom only by the emanation of the Supreme Wis&#8211; dom. Moses
                therefore says to the Israelites &#58; &#34;And observe and do them &#59; for this
                law is your wisdom and your intelligence in the eyes of the nations&#59;&#34; and he
                here exhorts them to act according to the law&#44; as laid down by him&#59; for only
                in this case would they be considered wise by the gentile peoples. Here too&#44; we
                    <pb n="57"/> THE CONSOLATION OF ISRAEL. 57 have a striking proof of the divine
                mission of Moses&#59; for does not our daily experience demonstrate&#44; that no Jew
                ever can gain the esteem of strangers hy transgressing the law &#63; On the contrary
                does not a strict observance of its precepts insure us always the respect&#44; if
                not the love&#44; of others&#63; But as it is not in&#8211; terested motives&#44; he
                they what they may&#44; which should he the only ones to sway us in matters of
                religion&#44; since we are hound to be pious from love to God&#44; and from a
                sincere reverence of his almighty power&#44; and from gratitude for the innumerable
                benefits which we hourly receive from his bounty&#58; we find that Moses rests not
                his appeal to the Israelites upon the advantage which the possession of the law
                con&#8211; fers&#44; alone&#44; but also upon its containing laws so per&#8211;
                fectly just in all their bearing&#44; that their truth must be apparent to every
                person of intelligence. In addi&#8211; tion to this&#44; he inculcates in almost
                every chapter of the admonitory portion of the Pentateuch&#44; that a filial
                confidence and a filial obedience are demanded of us as the perfection of piety&#59;
                as we also read&#58; &#34;And know in thv heart&#44; that as the father chastiseth
                his son&#44; so the Lord thy God chastiseth thee.&#34; If we do possess these noble
                feelings in their full extent&#44; we may confictently expect that the Lord will be
                nigh unto us&#44; whenever we call upon Him&#44; and that lie will extend to us
                assistance in our afflictions&#44; and send comfort to our souls even amidst the
                gloom of despair&#44; when the ills &#8211;of life seem to be approaching to
                overwhelm us by their weight. But we are not to imagine that the Ever&#8211;blessed
                has need for our service&#44; or that lie can be benefited by aught we do&#59;
                &#8212; far be such presumptuous thoughts from our minds &#58; <pb n="58"/> 58 THE
                CONSOLATION OF ISRAEL. on the contrary&#44; all the benefit of virtue is ours&#44;
                all the injury from sin must recoii upon our own heads. Moses&#44; therefore&#44;
                admonishes the Israelites&#44; that they ought to be very careful in the observance
                of the duties which God demanded of them&#44; for that pun&#8211; ishment would be
                as necessary a consequence of sin&#44; as reward is that of leading a religious
                life. The legislator farther adduces the most cogent reasons to the Israelites&#44;
                why they&#44; in particular&#44; should be care&#8211; ful in following his
                advice&#59; since they were the people who had seen God&#39;s power so manifestly
                exhibited&#44; and had been especially blessed with the gift of the divine law&#59;
                and thus they had peculiar obligations to fulfil&#44; that is&#44; to obey the
                precepts they had received and accepted as the law of the Creator of all. The nature
                of the Mosaic law furnishes us&#44; thus&#44; with a number of sound reasons to
                prove its truth. But besides this internal evidence&#44; there are many other
                arguments which present themselves readily&#44; even to a casual observer &#59; for
                no matter how slightly a man may have been induced to investigate the na&#8211; ture
                of his religion&#44; and the events connected there&#8211; with&#44; he must have
                his attention unavoidably ar&#8211; rested by the remarkable fulfilment of prophetic
                predictions announced from time to time to our na&#8211; tion. One of the most
                memorable of these is con&#8211; tained in the portion of the Law&#44; which we have
                read this day. Moses foretold that the Israelites were soon to cross the Jordan to
                inherit the land&#44; which should be given unto them in consequence of the covenant
                which the Lord had made with Abra&#8211; ham&#44; Isaac&#44; and Jacob &#59;
                that&#44; if obedient&#44; they should live happily and securely&#44; and there
                should be no <pb n="59"/> THE CONSOLATION OF ISRAEL. 59 one to make them afraid&#59;
                but&#44; that in case of diso&#8211; bedience to the divine mandates&#44; they
                should be speedily driven from this land and scattered amongst all the nations.
                &#8212; Just so it happened. The land was conquered after the death of Moses by
                Joshua&#44; his chosen successor&#44; who led the Israelites to the occu&#8211;
                pancy of their inheritance. But when Joshua and the elders of his days had died&#44;
                the people chosen by God soon forgot the debt they owed to Him&#44; and they
                transgressed the commandments they should have observed&#44; and ever and anon&#44;
                they were de&#8211; livered into the hands of surrounding nations&#44; and they were
                only liberated from the yoke of their op&#8211; pressors&#44; when they turned again
                unto their God with prayer and penitence &#59; and He then raised up unto them
                judges&#44; who freed them from the pressure of foreign bondage. At length&#44;
                under the kings&#44; they had altogether forsaken the Lord&#44; and the whole
                punishment denounced was therefore inflicted &#59; first&#44; the ten tribes&#44;
                composing the kingdom of Israel&#44; were expelled &#59; and lastly&#44; the tribes
                of Judah and Benja&#8211; min&#44; together with the family of Levi&#44; were forced
                out of their country&#44; and Palestine was left without an inhabitant. But says
                Moses &#58; &#34; And you will seek thence the Lo>d thy God&#44; and thou shalt find
                Him&#44; when thou seekest Him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.&#34;
                &#8212; &#34; For the Lord thy God is a merciful God&#44; He will not forsake thee
                nor annihilate thee&#44; nor w T ill He forget the covenant with thy fathers which
                He hath sworn unto them.&#34; &#8212; And truly has this been fulfilled&#59; when we
                transgressed we were not spared&#44; and God pulled down the strongholds of
                Judah&#59; He poured out his anger over wood and <pb n="60"/> 60 THE CONSOLATION OF
                ISRAEL. stone&#59; the house of glory was razed to the ground&#44; and the children
                of the covenant were scattered&#44; and were dispersed in small numbers over all the
                earth. Many of our people&#44; too&#44; have been lost among the gentiles &#59;
                there are those of us who worship gods of silver and gods of gold&#44; and they bow
                down to deities which have no existence&#44; save in the overheated and misguided
                fancy of deluded men. Despite&#44; however&#44; of all these calamities&#44; we
                never have been totally without assistance &#59; full often it appeared as though
                the sun of Judah would set for ever &#59; as though the light of Israel were about
                to expire&#44; never more to regain its lustre &#58; and then&#44; when despair had
                almost seized on the most confiding&#44; a reassurance of the certainty of help
                infused courage into the heart of the most desponding&#44; and it was thus proved
                that God will assist and console us&#44; when we address our prayers to Him &#59;
                and that He will never suffer us to sink under the burden of our misfortunes&#44;
                though our deeds may not be always such&#44; as to entitle us to this signal
                goodness. Indeed&#44; it was the divine in&#8211; terference that was so often&#44;
                manifested to effect our deliverance&#59; for no other cause could have produced a
                result so unexpected&#44; and preserved our people amidst so many difficulties. Are

                fore the face of clay in the presence of an assembled world. Since now we see that
                so many of the predictions have been fulfilled&#44; since it is evident that all the
                punishment has been sent&#44; since all the afflictions have overtaken us &#58; may
                &#39; we not reasonably hope&#44; that the good also will not be withheld&#44;
                whenever we have returned unto God with all our heart and with all our soul&#63;
                Most assuredly&#59; especially as we see the good already partially
                accomplished&#44; as has been said&#44; in the preservation of the Israelitish
                people. If even the promised blessings be still de&#8211; layed&#44; if even our
                eyes be closing before we have witnessed the consolation of Zion&#44; we should not
                despair of the happy change &#58; for we should reflect&#44; that the great God&#44;
                who chose us when we were few&#44; scattered us when sinning in prosperity&#44; and
                pre&#8211; served us in captivity&#44; has also promised that He would ultimately do
                the good thing for his servants&#44; and that his power can accomplish our
                restoration to our former glory. All the prophets&#44; the messengers of Heaven&#44;
                speak as one man of .that auspicious period&#44; when universal peace shall
                prevail&#44; and Israel be again in the land of Palestine&#44; and the worship of
                the true God be spread over all the earth. This we call the consola&#8211; tion of

                as follows&#58; &#34; Comfort ye&#44; comfort ye&#44; my people&#44; saith your God.
                Speak comfort unto the heart of Jerusalem&#44; and call out unto her&#44; that her

                shall see that the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.&#34; The prophet expresses here
                in figurative language the great restoration of the Israelites&#44; when comfort
                shall be spoken to those that have mourned for the affliction of Jerusalem&#59; this
                will be when the appointed time for the redemption has come&#44; when our sins shall
                all have been atoned for&#44; when all the punish&#8211; ment incurred has been
                meted out. Then&#44; however&#44; all difficulties will at once be seen to
                vanish&#44; and&#44; as it were&#44; a highway will be made in the wilderness for
                the passage of the redeemed&#44; and that which now appears as almost

                the confines of the land&#44; which once was ours&#44; as if mountains had been
                levelled and valleys had been raised. At this time too&#44;&#39; all mankind will

                come to inquire in what the superiority of man over the brute creation really
                consists&#44; we will find it to be his power of investigating things presented to
                his consideration&#44; and of adopting&#44; from a free and unrestricted choice&#44;
                that which he may deem to be the most conducive to his happhiess. No other

                will eat&#44; only because its natural impulse teaches it that food is necessary for
                its preservation &#59; it will take this food wherever it can find it ready for its
                use&#44; but it never thinks of tilling the ground to obtain the necessaries of life
                by means of art and labour. But man&#44; in feeling that he is obliged to eat in
                order to prolong life&#44; also dis&#8211; covers that raw food does not suit his
                taste&#44; and that wild herbs are not palatable enough to gratify his appetite&#59;
                he therefore subjects to the action of heat whatever he thinks can be improved in
                taste thereby&#44; and by cultivating the soil he endeavours to obtain better
                articles of sustenance&#44; and many more luxuries&#44; than the earth would
                spontaneously yield. In this way then man has a superiority over the beasts in a
                l&#94;hysical view&#59; since he can procure by art those com&#8211; forts&#44;
                which these cannot. Yet what is all physical superiority compared with the expansive
                faculties of the human intellect&#63; Is there any animal that can communicate its
                ideas by articulate sounds &#63; Man alone possesses this power&#59; nay&#44;
                more&#44; he can&#44; if he will&#44; communicate his ideas to those far removed
                from him&#44; yea&#44; even to those&#44; who may exist centuries after his death.
                &#8212; The animal when born has all its faculties at once developed&#44; or at
                best&#44; its education&#44; if so it may be called&#44; is soon completed&#44; for
                to all appearance&#44; but few additional ideas can be acquired by the most
                sagacious beast. &#8212; But man is always ad&#8211; vancing&#44; from the hour of
                his birth to that of his dissolution&#59; new light is constantly dawning upon his
                soul&#44; and his understanding hourly acquires new stores of knowledge. &#8212; Can
                we now for a moment believe&#44; that this signal superiority was con&#94;Brred on

                earthly desires&#63; can we suppose that the Creator would render his mind so
                perfect&#44; his soul so intelligent&#44; that he might be a better fed and more
                comfortable beast than a quadruped is &#63; No&#44; no&#44; reason was not given to
                man&#44; for the sole purpose of enabling him to accumulate luxuries and to multiply
                the means of his pleasures&#44; &#8212; and wisdom was not implanted in him&#44;
                merely to fit him to ward off personal inconveniencies. But he was endowed with
                reason&#44; that he might be enabled to think with humility and knowledge ov r er
                the works of the great Creator&#44; and &#8211;wisdom was given him&#44; that he
                might learn and understand the precepts of his God&#44; and that understanding&#44;
                he should endeavour to obey them&#44; in order to reach&#44; through obedience&#44;
                the highest degree of unbounded felicity. That to think &#40;in opposition to blind
                belief and dull acquiescence in received dogmas&#41; is the duty of every truly
                religious man&#44; that w r e are bound to reflect fre&#8211; quently upon the works
                and the precepts of God&#44; can be proved from many passages of the Pentateuch&#59;
                as Moses very often says &#58; &#34; And know in thy heart&#44;&#34; which phrase
                evidently inculcates deep and serious reflection. Other sacred writers have given us
                in their sublime&#44; works many splendid specimens of their deep thoughts &#58; and
                so says David in the eighth Psalm &#58; &#34; When I view thy heavens&#44; the works
                of thy fingers&#44; the moon and the stars which Thou hast founded &#8212; what is
                man that Thou shouldst think of him&#44; and the child of earth that Thou shouldst
                regard him &#63;&#34; We thus see&#44; that thought and reflection&#44; deep and
                serious&#44; are a duty which we&#44; as rational beings des&#8211; tined for

                least as we possess&#44; may be investigated&#44; may be sifted&#44; and
                exposed&#44; and the freest inquiry even cannot injure it&#59; for the more we enter
                into its sublimities&#44; the more shall we be inclined to exclaim with the
                Psalmist&#58; &#34;Open Thou my eyes&#44; that I may see the wonders of thy law
                &#33;&#34; &#8212; But to arrive at this blessed state of mind&#44; in which David
                spoke&#44; I mean&#44; in order to arrive at a conviction of the sacredness and
                truth of religion&#44; two things are necessary&#44; &#8212; first&#44; we should
                start from the proper point &#59; secondly&#44; we must be cautious&#44; that we
                enter not into what must&#44; from the very constitution of man&#44; be always
                hidden from him and unapproachable to his limited intellect. The evil effects
                arising from the neglect of this precau&#8211; tion are every day visible&#44; and
                unfortunately too fami&#8211; liar&#59; and we have often seen how a correct and
                hum&#8211; ble reasoning is productive of religious conviction&#44; and how many are
                led to become infidels&#44; because they approach the sacred threshold of truth with
                pre&#8211; sumption&#44; and an overweening confidence in their own judgment. And
                yet infidelity always assumes&#44; and arrogates to itself&#44; a claim to profound
                investiga&#8211; tion &#59; it affects to believe&#44; that the religious and pious
                never think&#59; it says&#44; religion must be fostered by ig&#8211; norance&#59;
                and that the light of reason will overthrow the dominion of faith. But can infidels
                establish their sole claim to profound reasoning &#63; Is there so much wisdom in
                unbelief&#63; Is there so much intellect in refusing to be guided by the law of God
                &#63; We may safely and emphatically answer&#44; no &#59; for if worldly
                thinking&#44; which reaches no farther than the animal frame&#44; can be wisdom&#44;

                which looks forward to perpetuate in bliss the immortal spark&#44; the undying soul
                of man. Let us investigate this matter a little more closely&#44; and indulge me
                awhile&#44; brethren&#44; whilst I detain you upon this subject&#44; a subject which
                demands of all the most serious reflection. For in truth&#44; there are those who
                say&#44; that religion and reason are at variance&#59; there are those&#44; who
                endeavour to withdraw from man his only support in the hour of affliction&#44;
                the&#8211; consciousness of the protection of God&#44; and a convic&#8211; tion of
                the infallibility and justice of the Almighty Judge &#59; there are those who
                ridicule others for prac&#8211; tising the duties which religion demands. &#8212;
                And yet these are the men who style themselves rationalists &#33; Vain boasters
                &#33; for they are groping in the dark &#8212; they have wilfully extinguished the
                only light which could have shown them the w T ay to true wisdom. The cause of
                infidelity may be stated to be twofold &#58; first&#44; pride&#59; secondly&#44;
                fear. The vain egotist hears himself praised for his learning&#44; he discovers that
                the world eagerly listens to whatever he puts forth&#44; to derive pleasure and
                knowledge from his instruction. He becomes inflated with his own importance&#44; and
                when he sees the regularity which pervades civilized life&#44; when he discovers the
                profound veneration which the world feels for the source of all this good&#44; the
                revelation of God&#58; he affects to be astonished&#44; and pretends that he could
                have made as good a code as that which is prized as the gift of Heaven&#44; &#8212;
                nay&#44; he even alleges that its standard of morality is not of a degree elevated
                enough to be satisfactory to the human intellect. He is wise and great&#44; this he
                has been often told&#44; and he therefore thinks that the wisdom of God <pb n="68"/>
                68 PERFECTION WITH GOD. was not necessary to give a law to mankind&#59; and as he
                deems it unnecessary so far as he is concerned&#44; he next avers that it is
                impossible that God should audi&#8211; bly speak to man &#59; and since he considers
                it impossi&#8211; ble&#44; the next assertion is&#44; that it never took place&#44;
                or in other words&#44; that the revelation alleged to have come from God is a sheer
                fabrication. Such a man who prides himself upon his wisdom&#44; though an
                infi&#8211; del in his professions&#44; may yet live in strict confor&#8211; mity to
                those rules of morality which&#34; the Bible con&#8211; tains&#59; he may even be
                stricter than those who pro&#8211; fess to believe in a divine origin of the law.
                But it can scarcely be principle&#44; or the fear of offending God&#44; but more
                properly&#44; pride&#44; which preserves such a man from vice. He knows&#44; that
                his standing in society is of that kind&#44; that the eyes of many are turned
                towards him&#59; he at least fancies himself an object of observation&#44;
                having&#44; according to the love which many feel for mere notoriety&#44; done so
                much to obtain the public regard&#59; he believes many are watching his movements to
                discover his faults&#44; for the purpose of throwing discredit upon his mode of
                thinking&#44; by placing his iniquity before the world&#44; to forewarn others
                against following his example&#59; he&#44; therefore&#44; endeavours to demean
                himself so that his conduct shall throw no discredit upon his doctrines. &#8212;
                Nay&#44; suppose him meek and unostentatious&#44; intent only on doing good&#44;
                which&#44; however&#44; is hardly possi&#8211; ble &#58; there is still no reason to
                imagine that religion is the less necessary to the rest of the world&#44; although
                this one may be ostensibly virtuous while despising its tenets. For&#44; observe
                brethren&#44; this meek unos&#8211; tentatious philosopher was not born in a
                far&#8211;off laud&#44; <pb n="69"/> PERFECTION WITH GOD. 69 where the tread of
                civilization had never before been heard&#44; but in a well&#8211;regulated
                community &#59; and he was reared&#44; where the Bible is both known and vene&#8211;
                rated&#59; he grew up amidst men professing religion&#44; and he accordingly
                imbibed&#44; imperceptibty&#44; those very principles which he affects to hold in so
                light an es&#8211; teem &#59; now he has reached manhood&#39;s years&#44; and he
                continues to act as he has been accustomed to do&#59; and no matter whether he
                says&#44; that he believes or not believes&#44; it is nevertheless true&#44; that
                the divine revelation&#44; although not acknowledged&#44; is his moral guide.
                Superficial reasoners&#44; when seeing a virtuous unbeliever&#44; or rather when
                seeing one affecting un&#8211; belief practising morality and maintaining an upright
                and honest character&#44; may perhaps say&#44; that a man may be truly good&#44; and
                yet not believe one word of revelation&#59; aud in consequence&#44; that revelation
                is not necessary to form a virtuous life&#44; or is even altogether false. But they
                ought to bear in mind&#44; that a man may imbibe principles&#44; either virtuous or
                criminal&#44; in a thousand ways&#44; other than by his own reasoning&#44; without
                being conscious of the manner in which he acquired the same&#44; or even without
                feeling at the time the new bias which his mind has received&#58; secondly&#44; that
                a man may profess to disbelieve reve&#8211; lation&#44; merely to gain the name of a
                philosopher&#44; a wise head&#44; or a deep thinker&#59; and that lastly&#44; mere
                believing one thing or the other is not the sole cause of our being good or bad&#44;
                for without good actions&#44; no man&#44; however firm his faith&#44; can be said to
                be de&#8211; cidedly religious and good&#44; being destitute of active virtue. Let
                us illustrate this by an example. A man passes along the street&#44; and sees an
                object of distress&#44; <pb n="70"/> 70 PERFECTION WITH GOD. say a person just hurt
                by an unforeseen accident&#59; he is engaged in deep thought&#44; and he hastens on
                regard&#8211; less of the distressed one&#44; though a slight reflection would
                convince him&#44; that his sympathy and his aid might be of service. All at once he
                is roused from his revery by the sound of a multitude of footsteps hastening to the
                spot which he has just left&#59; he turns round&#44; inquires the cause&#44; and is
                told&#44; that there is a man in great distress unable to move&#44; and&#44; upon
                the whole&#44; the greatest object of charity and commiseration imaginable.
                Immediately this man&#44; a few moments before so unconcerned&#44; is also seized
                with the conta&#8211; gion of pity&#44; and pushing his way through the crowd&#44;
                goes up to the sufferer&#44; and is foremost among those who offer relief. Can such
                a one be said to have be&#8211; come charitable of his own accord&#63; &#8212; This
                little scene is not altogether an imaginary sketch&#44; for I have but little
                doubt&#44; that many have experienced something very similar at some period of their
                life &#59; and it proves&#44; that we may be taught to practise charity&#44; even
                with&#8211; out intending to receive such instruction&#59; and no matter whatever
                our belief may be at the moment&#44; whether we believe in a Deitj&#94; or not &#58;
                whether w T e believe in a revelation or not &#59; whether we even be&#8211; lieve
                the poor wretch to be deserving of charity or not&#58; we cannot ascribe our
                charitable feelings so suddenly called forth at the moment to any other cause than
                the example of others. &#8212; But now see the difference between the different
                actors in this drama of humanity. The gloomy atheist hastens forward to relieve the
                distress he sees &#59; for he believes in an inevitable fate&#44; and he lends his
                aid&#44; because he him&#8211; self may one day stand in need of similar assistance
                &#59; <pb n="71"/> PERFECTION WITH GOD. 71 it is interest then&#44; nothing but
                self&#8211;love&#44; which actuates him. &#8212; The scornful infidel also comes
                here&#59; he be&#8211; lieves in a God&#44; hut thinks not that there is a Word of
                God to demand this good act of benevolence from him&#59; what spurs him on to the
                act&#63; pride certainly&#44; and perhaps interest &#59; for to the world he wishes
                to display the benevolence of his heart&#44; it is so good for effect&#44; and
                then&#44; perhaps&#44; he may also call to mind&#44; that change of circumstances
                may place him too one day in a situation as also to require succour. &#8212; But far
                different is the case with the really virtuous man&#44; he who trusts in God&#39;s
                providence&#44; and believes in his holy Word. When made conscious that his help is
                wanted&#44; he needs no other incentive&#44; than that his God demands of him to do
                all the good he can&#44; and he&#44; therefore&#44; obeys the mandate with alacrity.
                lie flies to the assistance of the poor&#44; speaks comfort to their minds&#44; and
                admonishes them to submit with cheerfulness to the decree of Heaven &#59; for all
                that God does is right&#44; and because everything&#44; yes&#44; pun&#8211; ishment
                even&#44; must be eventually for our advantage&#44; if we draw a proper lesson from
                whatever occurs to us. &#8212; It will thus appear&#44; that&#44; though the most
                oppo&#8211; site in opinion may be acting from the impulse of the moment&#44; and
                may join in the same deed of benevo&#8211; lence&#44; their feelings and motives
                will be very differ&#8211; ent. The atheist can be prompted by interest solely&#44;
                for he sees nothing around him but cre£itures of the same blind chance with
                himself&#44; and finds in himself a being that needs at times the assistance of
                these very chance&#8211;impelled machines. &#8212; The infidel philoso&#8211; pher
                acts from a secret motive of pride&#44; no matter how much soever this pride may lay
                concealed &#59; and <pb n="72"/> 72 PERFECTION WITH GOD. only the true believer can
                act from a motive which alone can give value to virtue &#8212; from
                disinterested&#8211; ness&#44; as far as this is compatible with human na&#8211;
                ture. In the foregoing&#44; I have endeavoured to elucidate the proposition&#44;
                that principles can be imbibed un&#8211; consciously&#59; for this is not the case
                with charity alone&#44; but also with the reverence we feel for parents&#59;

                dren&#59; the exercise of impartial justice&#44; and in short with every social
                virtue. &#8212; Now grant even&#44; that the philosopher who actually disbelieves
                revelation should never have read the Bible&#59; believe&#44; that he know T s not a
                word of its contents&#59; and suppose&#44; if it be pos&#8211; sible&#44; that those
                who educated him knew nothing about it themselves&#58; yet as he cannot close his
                eyes to what is going on around him&#44; since he sees the actions of those who
                believe differently from him&#44; can it be contended&#44; even under all these
                circumstances&#44; that he&#44; the unbeliever&#44; is not taught the principles of
                virtue by means of revelation &#63; can it be supposed that anything else than the
                example of others allures him to the love of justice and goodness &#63; For the A
                11&#8211; wise Creator has thrown so great a charm around virtue&#44; and has made
                piety so lovely&#44; that we are drawn towards them imperceptibly&#44; and even
                while practising the evil&#44; we feel a degradation at not doing the good. And as
                many a one is insensibly led to sin by being exposed to its influence&#44; so may
                piety&#44; being general&#44; also attract unconscious followers&#59; so true is it
                that the force of example is one of the most powerful agents in forming our
                character&#59; and hence too the necessity of associating with those only&#44; from
                    <pb n="73"/> PERFECTION WITH GOD. 73 whose conduct and conversation something
                good may&#8211; be learned. Besides the philosophical unbeliever&#44; there are
                cer&#8211; tain men who&#44; although in their own minds persuaded of the truth of
                religion&#44; affect to be doubters&#59; these are generally found amongst the
                gay&#44; or the uneduca&#8211; ted&#44; or those who&#44; having acquired but a
                slight degree of knowledge&#44; imagine themselves completely fitted to form a
                comprehensive judgment. Some of this class wish to appear more enlightened than
                their neighbours or those who are older and more experi&#8211; enced&#59; and they
                imagine that by ridiculing what others hold sacred&#44; they can acquire and deserve
                the title of men of intelligence. Their vanity is the cause of their apparent
                infidelity &#59; and if they do not prac&#8211; tise immorality&#44; they are
                restrained solely by the fear of incurring the punishment denounced against sin&#44;
                but not by a true love of God&#44; for they do not honour Him&#44; while they r
                affect a disregard for his word. Every day&#39;s experience proves the existence of
                such a class of perverse thinkers&#44; and perhaps philosophi&#8211; cal hypocrites
                of this kind are as numerous&#44; as those who show more veneration for religion
                than they ac&#8211; tually possess&#94; We have hitherto all along supposed an
                infidelity accompanied by a strict morality&#44; and we have shown that&#94; taking
                it in its most favourable light&#44; its sole principle of action can be nothing but
                pride&#44; or at best&#44; interest and egotism. But if even we say that a learned
                infidel could be virtuous in the true sense of the word &#59; yet how dreadful must
                the consequences of his example be on others. They see a man blessed with strong
                mental powers professing to think&#44; that VOL. I. 7 <pb n="74"/> 74 PERFECTION
                WITH GOD. the Supreme Ruler has laid no farther restraint upon our inclinations than
                our own reason or conscience&#44; as it is termed&#44; imposes. The infidel
                himself&#44; as has been said&#44; has a motive for doing right&#44; as his
                self&#8211; love teaches him to beware of losing his fair reputa&#8211; tion &#59;
                his disciples&#44; however&#44; have no such check&#44; they are of the common
                herd&#59; they are&#44; every indi&#8211; vidual almost&#44; belonging to the mass
                of the people at large&#44; whose conduct is scarcely noticed&#44; or&#44; if
                noticed&#44; soon forgotten. What then&#44; we ask&#44; can prevent them from doing
                everything which the law forbids &#63; The Bible scarcely speaks to them&#44; since
                they have been taught to despise it&#44; and we all know&#44; how in&#8211; veterate
                the vulgar are in their prejudices and predi&#8211; lections&#44; particularly when
                goaded by some indefinite popular cant&#44; the meaning of which they&#44;
                themselves&#44; do not understand.&#42; The influence&#44; therefore&#44; of
                in&#8211; fidelity upon society at large&#44; may be compared to the act of
                unchaining a tiger&#44; maddened by hunger and captivity&#44; in the midst of a
                populous city having no me&#39;ans of defence &#59; or rather of cutting through a
                dyke&#44; erected as a defence against the sea&#44; whilst hun&#8211; dreds of
                people are standing upon it in apparent se&#8211; curity&#44; who must be unable to
                save themselves before the waters of the ocean cover them&#44; and bury them beneath
                the rising and foaming billows. &#8212; So that&#44; if infidelity should even not
                be hurtful to an individual&#44; which is however denied&#44; its bad example will
                never&#8211; theless destroy everything dear to the heart&#59; and con&#8211; &#42;
                No doubt every reader will call to mind the watchwords of the French Revolution of

                sequently&#44; on the score of expediency alone&#44; even without any other
                reason&#44; it ought to be discounte&#8211; nanced by every friend of the human
                race. If the consequences of such an infidelity&#44; ostensibly founded on
                reason&#44; are so bad&#44; those of the other spe&#8211; cies&#44; arising from
                fear&#44; are no less pernicious. An inddel from fear&#44; I would call a man&#44;
                who after hav&#8211; ing been guilty of some gross irreligious act&#44; or who does
                not like to undertake the labour which is neces&#8211; sary to obtain the mastery
                over the passions&#58; at last persuades himself&#44; that whatever of religion he
                has been taught by his parents and teachers is the off&#8211; spring of
                prejudice&#44; ignorance&#44; and bigotry. Such a one is a coward&#59; he w r ishes
                to be assured&#44; that religi&#8211; ous restraints are not in any manner derived
                from God&#44; and consequently that He cannot punish him for neglecting them. But if
                he could once be brought to think&#44; that religion owes its existence to the
                actual precepts of the Deity&#44; that punishment will sooner or later be meted out
                for a disregard of its precepts&#44; or if he could summon courage enough to condemn
                his own conduct&#44; if he could look upon himself as a sinner and transgressor of a
                divine mandate &#58; it is highly probable that this man&#44; who denies revelation
                from the motives of calming his uneasy conscience&#44; would soon become a convert
                to a better course&#44; and endeavour to obey the law&#44; the infraction of which
                threatens him with consequences which he ought to dread. For it is reasonable enough
                to expect that&#44; if a vaunting cowardice led him to deny the truth&#44; the
                consciousness&#44; that he will be accountable for his misdoings&#44; when once
                awakened&#44; must impel him to endeavour to make amends for his evil deeds to avert
                    <pb n="76"/> 76 PERFECTION WITH GOD. the impending retribution. &#8212; But
                while such a man remains stupefied by sin and unreformed&#44; while he pursues&#44;
                unrestrained&#44; his career of vice&#44; he presents us a frightful and terrible
                example to what a state the human mind can be degraded. He indulges in midnight
                revelry&#59; he resorts to the gaming&#8211;house&#44; for he can find no delight at
                his own fireside&#44; in the bosom of his family &#59; in the mean time his deluded
                wife&#44; rendered wicked perhaps by his example&#44; ex&#8211; pects with bloodshot
                eyes his late return &#59; his ragged children are crying for want of food&#59; and
                having sacrificed all to his sinful appetite&#44; he himself is soon covered with
                the garb of poverty&#44; and as by his ex&#8211; cesses he has disgusted the
                s&#59;ood and virtuous of his former acquaintance&#44; what remains for him but
                beg&#8211; gary&#44; perhaps suicide&#44; the scaffold&#44; or at best the walls of
                a prison &#63; &#8212; I may be perchance charged with ex&#8211; aggeration &#59;
                but I ask&#44; whether&#44; if infidelity had this influence but on one man even
                &#40;and there are&#44; alas &#33; thousands of its victims&#41;&#44; it would still
                be correct and proper to forewarn the wavering against following the path which has
                led one fellow&#8211;being to destruc&#8211; tion. We have thus seen&#44; that
                unbelief&#44; be its source pride or fear&#44; is equally destructive to the
                well&#8211;being of society no less than to the happiness of individuals&#59; for it
                requires no argument to prove the self&#8211;evident proposition&#44; that a state
                can only be well governed and remain undisturbed by factions&#44; as long as the
                majority are virtuous and well&#8211;disposed to order and obedience to the laws.
                &#8212; Nothing&#44; therefore&#44; can be more true&#44; than the words of Holy

                it is only the wisdom which especially comes from God&#44; that is the source of all
                the good which the world enjoys&#59; and indeed&#44; none but those&#44; who are
                self&#8211;deluded&#44; can ever deny in serious earnest&#44; that the benefits
                conferred on man by the divine law are really incalculable. In truth&#44; none
                gainsay the excellence of our code&#44; and the usefulness of its ten&#8211;
                dency&#59; but some wish to derogate from its holiness merely&#44; by levelling it
                down to a human institution. But if we look around us&#44; and judge carefully by
                what is known to us&#44; we must soon acknowledge&#44; per&#8211; haps much to our
                mortification&#44; that human wisdom&#44; however exalted&#44; was never able to
                produce laws&#44; the efficacy of which could be tested by the experi&#8211; ence of
                ages&#44; as that of our holy law has been. &#8212; Shall we adduce arguments to
                prove this &#63; &#33;N&#34;o argument is necessary &#59; for look but at the laws
                of Confucius&#44; of Bucldah&#44; qf Bramah&#44; of Solon&#44; of Lycurgus&#44; and
                Numa&#59; did .they effect that for their people&#44; which the Pentateuch has done

                laws of Solon rendered the Athenians fac&#8211; tious in politics and loose in
                morals&#44; and whilst Lycurgus attempted to banish refinement&#44; and make the
                state the chief good of his citizens&#58; neither was able to preserve his followers

                when they had lost their independence. And even Numa&#44; the founder perhaps of

                government&#44; and consequently his system too fell before the spread of
                enlightening prin&#8211; ciples&#44; and the children of Numa revere the law of
                Moses. What then is there of degradation&#44; what of meanness in obeying our laws
                &#63; Why should pride refuse to yield to the enactments of the Supreme &#63;
                &#8212; You will perhaps say&#44; because man is already suffi&#8211; ciently
                endowed with reason&#59; you may say&#44; that the varied occupations of life demand
                all our attention&#59; perchance you may say that&#44; as civilization advances&#44;
                antiquated statutes ought to be discarded. In short&#44; all the excuses which

                exalt himself&#44; in order to show&#44; that he needs no instruction of God.
                &#8212; But why&#44; we ask&#44; should a mortal exult so much&#63; why should he
                rely so much upon his finite w T isdom&#44; and forget that he is accountable to the
                Un&#8211; dying One&#63; &#8212; Why should the beautiful think so much of adorning
                their persons&#44; and neglect the sacred duties demanded of them &#63; Why should
                the strong one aim at overcoming all the ills and dangers of life &#8212; as though
                he never could be moved&#44; &#8212; and dis&#8211; regard the will of God &#63;
                &#8212; Why should the powerful&#44; nay&#44; even the king upon his throne&#44; the
                conqueror on the day of victory&#44; value his own importance so highly as to refuse
                to follow those rules&#44; by which the more humble are guided &#63; &#8212; For
                often does the wisdom of the wise fail them &#59; often does beauty fade in its
                prime&#59; often the strong are cut off in the midst of their career&#44; and often
                the mighty are deprived of <pb n="79"/> PERFECTION WITH GOD. 79 their power&#44; and
                are left forgotten and despised. &#8212; There is an instance of a man of mighty
                intellect&#44; who had Ions&#58; delighted the world with the effusions of his
                knowledge &#59; crowds nocked to hear and to ad&#8211; mire his eloquence&#59; the
                shafts of his satire were dreaded&#44; as though they were the doom pronounced by an
                angel of God &#59; his praise was received with de&#8211; light&#59; his name was
                honoured by all his countrymen&#44; and it appeared that he had almost reached a
                point&#44; whence he might look with contempt upon aught be&#8211; neath him&#58;
                when&#44; alas&#33; as if in mockery of human greatness&#44; his gigantic reason
                forsook him&#44; and he&#44; whose mind was almost a storehouse of knowledge&#44;
                could not communicate his physical wants even to those willing and ready to serve
                him. &#8212; Many a fair one has stood by the side of him she loved&#59; she&#44; if
                any one could&#44; might look with confidence upon a future bright and smiling&#59;
                pleasure seemed to await her&#44; and she was declared happy by all her beholders.
                But soon the fair&#44; frail flower pined away&#59; blighting disease seized on her
                vitals&#44; and in a few brief months she was laid low in the dust&#59; her husband
                was left to mourn in solitude&#44; and the house of joy was changed into the
                dwelling of grief&#44; because she&#44; the wife&#44; was&#44; no more. &#8212; The
                brave in arms has been known to embark in the defence of his country&#39;s
                cause&#59; he was seen to sleep on the bare ground&#44; among those whom he led out
                to battle. &#8212; He hurried forth to the fight&#44; and glory seemed to lead him
                on where danger was the greatest&#59; but he fell&#44; and though the shout of
                victory was soon raised from rejoicing thousands&#44; the hero heard it not&#44; for
                his body reposed in death. &#8212; Once there reigned a king&#44; who was

                was called&#44; The Desired&#44; The Illustrious&#59; victory too perched on his
                standard&#44; and his mighty rival was humbled by his skill&#44; both in the field
                and the cabinet&#59; who would believe it&#44; if history did not authenticate the
                fact&#44; that this king was hurled from his throne &#8212; was cast into prison
                &#8212; was tried like a felon &#8212; was torn even from the society of his family
                &#8212; and&#44; at last&#44; was made a sacrifice to popular fury &#63; &#8212;
                Well does Holy Writ admonish us . &#40;Jerm. ix. 22&#41; &#58; &#34; Let not the
                wise boast of his wisdom&#44; the strong man not of his strength&#44; nor the rich

                justice&#44; and righteousness on earth&#44; how I find pleasure in these&#44; saith
                the Eternal Lord.&#34; &#8212; Suppose now&#44; that a man should even possess all
                earthly blessings&#59; imagine him to be rich&#44; powerful&#44; respected&#44; and
                more than all&#44; the wisest of men&#44; what at last must be his end&#63; will it
                not be like that of the meanest of his menials &#63; It is only for a few short
                years that he can enjoy earthly goods&#44; when he must depart hence to render a

                Since then&#44; brethren&#44; all human wisdom is imper&#8211; fect &#8212; since
                all our power is so very circumscribed&#58; why should we refuse to learn lessons of

                brethren&#44; is precisely the wis&#8211; dom which revelation teaches &#59; it
                tells ns to receive as our guide and instructor the word of our Father &#59; it
                advises us to fly to Him for assistance in our troubles&#59; and it promises ns
                knowledge for doing the first&#44; and salvation and enlargement for complying with
                the other duty. We are farther commanded not to harden our hearts&#44; when once we
                have done wrong&#44; and not to persevere in sin under the plea that our conduct
                contradicts no positive rule of right&#59; but that&#44; if erring&#44; we should
                purify ourselves by a change of conduct&#44; and rely upon the Merciful One for
                pardon in recompense for our sincere amendment. &#8212; If now we wish revelation to
                have its proper effect on us&#44; we should&#44; as said already&#44; be
                particularly careful&#44; when commencing religious inquiries&#44; to start from the
                proper point&#44; and then never to dive into mysteries which must always remain
                hidden from our knowl&#8211; edge. These two points are necessary&#44; that we may
                not yield to pride and think ourselves too wise to learn&#44; and never to look
                beyond what our reason is capable to bear &#59; so that we may not be led into
                mysti&#8211; cism&#44; philosophizing&#44; and irreligion. When you now&#44; my
                respected hearers&#44; commence the study 7 of your religion&#44; and wish to read
                with advantage the books of Sacred Writ&#44; do it with humility&#44; with a
                becoming distrust of your own mental powers&#59; never think of finding fault with
                any thing that is obscure to you &#59; and you should reflect&#44; that the God who
                inspired his servants to write those splendid lessons of moral&#8211; ity&#44; and
                those elevated religious conceptions&#44; must be incapable of giving us any thing
                in these books which&#44; when properly understood&#44; can be otherwise <pb n="82"

                sages which you do not understand&#59; but do not re&#8211; ject them as unwise&#59;
                &#8212; on the contrary ascribe it to the insufficiency of your information upon the
                parts you are studying. You may find&#44; that nearly all the personages in the
                Bible had more or less faults&#44; and some of you may therefore think&#44; that the
                holy Scrip&#8211; tures are unfit for reading&#44; because they recount vice even.
                But you should reflect&#44; that the Bible was intended to give us a true picture of
                life&#44; in which the bad as well as the good act their part&#59; and God purposed
                also to inculcate&#44; by presenting us with an impartial history of man&#44; that
                the good even may sometimes sin&#44; &#8212; in order to teach us humility&#44; and
                to caution us against trusting to our own righteousness&#44; and to admonish us not
                to presume upon our own goodness&#44; since no one is without his faults. Sec&#8211;
                ondly&#44; when reading the Scriptures&#44; and in seeing the transactions of
                life&#44; you must not endeavor to inquire too deeply&#44; why and wherefore every
                thing is as you find&#44; it&#59; but consider&#44; that as you have not the power
                of altering things at will&#44; and as you cannot under&#8211; stand every thing
                &#40;since even the most scientific does not comprehend the nature of substances
                presented to him&#44; which he can handle&#44; analyze and subdivide at
                pleasure&#41;&#44; the One above must know better than we&#44; how all ought to be
                organized&#44; and that He only purposes the well&#8211;being of all his creatures
                in all He does. &#8212; With such views&#44; brethren&#44; you may fearlessly study
                the Scriptures&#44; and think over their contents&#44; and reflect upon the
                structure of the whole universe&#44; and the rather&#44; as you will by this means

                endea&#8211; vour always so to live as the precepts of this law de&#8211; mand. And

                Another year is nearly ended&#44; and again does the returning autumn admonish us
                that we are approach&#8211; ing nearer and nearer to the termination of our earthly
                career. Behold the husbandman is busj r now with gathering in the produce of the
                labour of his hands&#44; and with joyous countenance he surveys the rich blessings
                which Providence has so kindly bestowed on him in the season which has just elapsed.
                See how every one is hastening to provide for the com&#8211; ing winter&#44; when
                all work in the field must cease&#44; when only those who laboured&#44; whilst the
                time was yet favourable&#44; can think of enjoying ease and com&#8211; fort. But wo
                to the heedless ones&#44; for want and sor&#8211; row must be theirs when the bleak
                frost shuts out from view the surface of this beautiful earth&#44; and covers all
                with the robe of desolation. Already the days are becoming shorter&#44; and soon the
                sad&#44; long dreary nights will usurp the place of the gladsome days of summer.
                More and more we are admon&#8211; ished&#44; that a severer season is coming&#44;
                and that the pleasures&#44; which the spring and summer afforded&#44; can in a short
                time be no longer enjoyed when winter rules the year. But spring will in its turn
                come again to revisit the earth&#44; and restore to us the delights which it
                imparted before. &#8212; Man&#44; too&#44; has his spring&#8211; time of life&#44;
                his youth and vigour&#59; the strength of &#42; The New Year. <pb n="85"/> THE

                last his decay of bodily&#44; perhaps of mental&#44; powers &#59; but&#44; unlike
                the changes of the year&#44; to him no youth returns&#44; and the labour once
                neglected cannot be done in another period&#44; and the time&#44; once misspent&#44;
                is lost for ever. Yes&#44; for ever &#33; although the sound does fall so fearfully
                upon the ear&#44; and throw so terrible a spell over the imagination &#59; and thus
                every thing&#44; from the overthrow of a mighty empire to the occurrences of
                ordinary life&#44; tells us &#58; &#34; That our days are but a shadow on earth
                I&#34; &#8212; Yet our time is long enough to enable us to do many a good act&#44;
                and to prove that we are worthy of being called the children of the Lord. This end
                is obtained by an ever active pur&#8211; suit of virtue&#44; and an always zealous
                observance of the ordinances of religion&#44; which a man is to do to obtain through
                them life everlasting. We should therefore make it the unwavering rule of our whole
                existence on earth&#44; to join to a sincere and heartfelt fear of God a cheerful
                obedience to the laws which He has prescribed&#44; for thus only can we accomplish
                the object of our creation. We have had occasion before this&#44; to notice
                seve&#8211; ral passages o&#94;the last address of Moses to the Israel&#8211;
                ites&#59; and we &#34;have seen how forcible the admonitions are which he impressed
                upon their minds before his death. In this address he had recapitulated briefly the
                principal events which had taken place since the redemption from Egypt &#59; he also
                had recounted many precepts&#44; and besought the Israelites to remain true to their
                Glod&#44; and in conclusion had pronounced ter&#8211; rible denunciations in case
                they should stray into the path of sin. &#8212; The last day of his mission was now
                vol. i. 8 <pb n="86"/> 86 THE COVENANT. close at hand&#44; when he thus spoke to the
                assembled congregation &#58; &#34; You stand this day&#44; all of you&#44; be&#8211;
                fore the Lord your God&#59; your heads&#44; your tribes&#44; your elders&#44; and
                your officers of justice&#44; &#8212; every man of Israel&#59; your children&#44;
                your wives&#44; and the stranger that is within thy camp&#44; from the hewer of thy
                wood to the drawer of thy water. For the sake that thou mayest pass &#40;accede
                to&#41; through the covenant of the Lord thy God&#44; and through his oath&#44;
                which the Lord thy God makethwith thee this day.&#34; &#40;Deut. xxix. 9&#8211;
                11.&#41; You will readily observe&#44; that Moses addressed indiscriminately every
                individual in the camp&#44; to show us&#44; that no man&#44; however mean or exalted
                his station&#44; can in anywise exonerate himself from being a party to the covenant
                of the Lord. He says &#58; &#34; You stand this day&#44; all of you&#44; before the
                Lord&#44;&#34; indicating to them&#44; that all were taken as the servants of the
                Lord&#44; and that the watchful eye of Providence was directed to every one
                individually&#44; and that therefore every one should look upon himself as acceding
                separately to the covenant which was made with them on that day. This view also will
                explain&#44; probably&#44; why the teacher first says &#58; &#34; You
                stand&#44;&#34; and afterwards&#44; &#34;that thou mayest enter&#59;&#34; for he
                speaks to the whole nation first&#44; and then to every man&#44; sepa&#8211; rately
                viewed&#44; of all Israel. &#8212; To this separate school&#8211; ing of the whole
                people&#44; to the fact that all were taught to look upon themselves as alike
                children of salvation&#44; may be ascribed the extraordinary circum&#8211; stances
                &#40;rendered probable by the internal evidence of Deuteronomy&#41;&#44; that at the
                period of Moses&#39;s death there was a perfect unanimity with regard to the
                ob&#8211; servance of the precepts of the law &#59; and we are led <pb n="87"/> THE
                COVENANT. 87 to believe that at this time all felt themselves im&#8211; pelled to
                respect those institutions which conferred upon them the extraordinary privilege of
                a perfect equality in the eye of the law &#40;since no one could assume any
                superiority which was not delegated to him voluntarily&#41;&#44; besides an absolute
                security of body and property. And it accordingly happened&#44; that as long as this
                devotion to the ceremonial part of the law was maintained&#44; peace and security
                reigned throughout all the boundaries of Israel&#59; for while the just fear of God
                was every where predominant&#44; the relative position between the people and their
                rulers was also preserved&#44; &#8212; and neither servile submission nor tyrannical
                sway was known in our land &#59; since the regard pai&#8211;cl to one portion of the
                Mosaic code was a security for the maintenance of the other. And in truth it seemed
                as though the Almighty had person&#8211; ally descended to assume&#44; in his
                glory&#44; the rule over his people. Here then was a people acknowledging One
                God&#44; unseen and incorporeal &#58; while surrounding nations bowed to many
                deities &#8212; the work of their own hands&#44; and the offspring of their
                disordered fancy. Here was a people worshipping in humble meekness&#44; in perfect
                consonance with reason&#44; the everblessed and adored One &#58; while surrounding
                na&#8211; tions sacrificed human victims to the idol of abomi&#8211; nation. Here
                was a people protected by just and equitable laws&#44; and living securely under the
                benev&#8211; olent rule of accepted leaders&#44; while all around Pal&#8211; estine
                frightful despotism ruled with iron sway&#44; and subjected whole communities to the
                arbitrary deci&#8211; sions of deified evil&#8211;doers&#44; or the false prophecies
                of designing impostors. Thus was the superiority <pb n="88"/> 88 THE COVENANT. of
                God&#39;s covenant manifested&#44; and thus was exem&#8211; plified&#44; that happy
                must be that people to whom the Eternal One is God. &#8212; blessed days of our
                national prosperity &#33; you have&#44; alas &#33; too soon passed away&#44; and we
                now must mourn over our glory that has fallen&#44; and over the people that are
                scattered and oppressed amongst the gentiles &#33; But&#44; brethren&#44; let me
                entreat you on this day&#44; when the most solemn period of the year is approaching
                &#8212; the day when&#44; according to our received tradition&#44; judgment will be
                held over all nations&#44; not to suffer the example of your ancestors to be lost
                upon you. Reflect that you are their lineal descendants&#44; and the inheritors of
                the Law of which they were made the depositary. Consider what it is that demands
                your attention&#44; and by what ties you are bound to the Lord&#44; and what bonds
                unite you to the departed great of early days&#44; who were designated as the chosen
                friends of God&#44; the immortal patriarchs&#44; Abraham&#44; Isaac&#44; and
                Jacob&#44; who&#44; whilst yet ignorance reigned triumphant&#44; whilst yet the
                deepest mental gloom covered the earth&#44; stood forth as the champions of religion
                and morality&#44; and spread the light of the fear of God into every land which
                their footsteps touched in their wanderings. You ought to be con&#8211; scious&#44;
                that it is your province to prove to the world how great your attachment is for the
                heavenly legacy in your possession&#44; and to make it manifest to all nations&#44;
                that you are Israelites not in name merely&#44; and to place it beyoud a doubt&#44;
                that you are really deserving of being denominated the chosen people &#8212; the
                people selected by the Supreme Wisdom to be a beacon to all nations&#44; that they
                may be led&#44; through <pb n="89"/> THE COVENANT. 89 you&#44; unto that point of
                goodness&#44; where virtue and happiness meet&#44; where perfection and beatitude
                are united. Remember too that not only to the Israel&#8211; ites in the wilderness
                the Law was given&#44; but that to us also&#44; assembled here this day&#44; the
                father of the prophets addressed his solemn warning in the fol&#8211; lowing words
                &#58; &#34; But not with you alone do I make this covenant and this oath of
                confirmation &#59; but with him who is here this day with us&#44; stand&#8211; ing
                before the Lord our God&#44; and with him who is not with us here this day.&#34;
                Deut. xxix. 12. These words of Moses are explicit&#44; and he means to indicate that
                no generation of Israelites&#44; no matter how far removed from the period of the
                promulga&#8211; tion of the Law&#44; can ever divorce themselves from the observance
                of the commandments of the Lord. True it is&#44; that we have no longer an
                opportunity of bringing sacrifices &#59; we have no longer a priest to ad&#8211;
                minister at the altar of God &#58; we are consequently prevented from complying with
                many of the cere&#8211; monial statutes&#59; but this does not release us from those
                whicK are yet practicable &#8212; from those ever&#8211; lasting ordinances which
                were to be practised &#34; in all the places of our residence&#44;&#34; and through
                which Israel has been so often blessed and signally benefit&#8211; ted. Look at the
                beautiful institution of the weekly day of rest&#44; the symbol of the everlasting
                repose of <pb n="90"/> 90 THE COVENANT. the blessed hereafter&#44; and the evidence
                of God&#39;s rule on earth. The whole week man has been toiling to obtain food for
                himself and those dependent upon his exertion&#44; to provide raiment and shelter
                for his wife and offspring&#44; to shield them by human means from the dire mishaps
                of life&#44; and to acquire for them comforts and luxuries&#44; and to place them in
                a respectable and honoured station in society. Six days he has thus laboured&#44; by
                day exposed to the scorching sun&#44; and by night unrefreshed by sleep that fled
                from his anxious pillow. But at length the blessed Sabbath arrives &#59; the toil of
                the slave is suspended &#59; the incessant blows of the artisan&#39;s ham&#8211; mer
                cease &#59; the merchant closes his warehouse&#44; and the industrious husbandman
                returns from the field to enjoy the day of the Lord in the bosom of his family.
                Behold the house of God is opened&#59; group after group enters&#44; and all sit
                awaiting the opening of the service offered up to our Maker. Hear the solemn hymn
                ascending&#59; hear the fervent prayer of the devout&#44; sweeter far than the fat
                of rams &#59; listen to the word that is proclaimed aloud by the messenger in whom
                the congregation confide &#59; behold the great hilarity that pervades all&#44; and
                can you&#44; can any mor&#8211; tal refuse to join in the thanksgiving&#58;
                &#34;Praised be the Lord who has given rest to His people Israel&#63;&#34; Not so
                ungrateful can you prove to the heavenly gift&#44; which gives rest&#44; and
                ease&#44; and enlargement to the high and the humble&#44;&#42; but all will&#42;
                gladly ex&#8211; &#42; In the above sketch&#44; I have endeavoured to exhibit what a
                Sab&#8211; bath should be&#44; and as it was observed in former times. But the
                spirit of gain now often induces labour on the seventh day even &#59; yet may we not
                hope&#44; that a speedy change will come over this evil spirit of our age &#63; <pb
                    n="91"/> THE COVENANT. 91 claim &#58; &#34; Praised be Thou&#44; Lord&#44; who
                sauctifiest the Sabbath.&#34; In the change of seasons various labours engage the
                sons of man &#59; days of toil and nights of anxious thoughts are devoted to the
                increase of their physi&#8211; cal prosperity&#44; and but little attention is given
                to the welfare of the undying spirit. And thus it happens that men spend their days
                without thinking of moral perfection &#59; and many a one&#44; therefore&#44; heaps
                sin upon transgression and misdeed upon offence&#44; heedless that the path he is
                pursuing is the way of death. It was in mercy&#44; therefore&#44; that God devoted
                one day in the year for reflection &#59; one day&#44; on which his crea&#8211; tures
                should review their past conduct&#44; and endea&#8211; vour to correct whatever of
                evil they may find&#44; and to fortify themselves in the good they have hitherto
                done. This day is the Day of Atonement&#44; to which we are now fast approaching.
                &#8212; It is this day&#44; which has been instituted as the season of universal
                peni&#8211; tence&#44; fasting and prayer for the whole house of Israel&#59; the day
                on which the Lord assured his ser&#8211; vant Moses&#44; when interceding for the
                rebellious people&#44; that He had forgiven their iniquity. &#8212; I said&#44; that
                it is a day of reflection and penitence. It is not enough&#44; that we should
                assemble and pray outwardly&#59; it is not enough that we say&#44; &#34; We have
                sinned&#59;&#34; but the heart toc&#94; should feel what the mouth utters&#44; and
                no duplicity must dwell in our thoughts&#44; when we appear at the foot of the
                throne of glory to ask for&#8211; giveness for our sins. It is therefore that the
                notes of preparation are sounded&#44; therefore the cornet is blown on the first
                clay of the year&#44; to address itself in an audible voice to the slumberers&#44;
                to rouse the <pb n="92"/> 92 THE COVENANT. loiterers on the path of virtue&#44; and
                to admonish them to make reparation for the wrong they have done to&#8211; wards
                their Maker&#44; and to satisfy those of their fel&#8211; low&#8211;men whom they
                have wronged or offended&#44; be&#8211; fore cometh the day of the Lord. It is thus
                that the Sabbath&#44; as well as the Day of Atonement&#44; must tend to invigorate
                the body for renewed toil and exertion&#44; and to fortify the soul in the true
                feeling of religion&#44; by reconciling us to our God&#44; and restoring peace and
                harmony between offended brothers. But it is needless to consume much time in
                pointing out the beauties of our religion&#44; since they must be obvious to any one
                gifted with but a small share of penetra&#8211; tion. My object in dwelling upon the
                subject at all&#44; was to prove to you&#44; that the Law itself is yet capa&#8211;
                ble of being followed &#59; to admonish you to be careful in the observance of its
                holy precepts&#44; and to impress upon your minds the obligation which rests upon
                you&#44; in consequence of your being parties to the covenant of God with Israel.
                &#8212; In continuation of the extract furnished above we are told by Moses&#44;
                that God in&#8211; tended to raise us up&#44; in consequence of this covenant&#44;
                to be His people&#44; and that He also would&#44; in accord&#8211; ance with the
                same&#44; be our God. Some one may now ask &#58; &#34; What is meant by the
                Israelites being made the people of God&#44; since all the world is his &#63; What
                is meant by his becoming the God of the Israelites&#44; when He is the Creator and
                Ruler of every being that inhabits the universe &#63;&#34; To this we answer &#58;
                To be the people&#44; the peculiar people of God&#44; signifies that we should be
                very careful so to live as this God directs &#59; and He to be our God means&#44;
                that He would bestow a particular watchful&#8211; <pb n="93"/> THE COVENANT. 93 ness
                and a more direct protection as a reward for this obedience. Before the period at
                which Moses spoke&#44; we had been chosen to receive the Law of the Lord as the
                descendants of those particularly pious men&#44; who&#44; as we said above&#44;
                stepped forth as the adorers of the Most High&#44; when the rest of mankind was
                addicted to the grossest superstition &#59; but after the divine descent on
                Sinai&#44; we were promised the favour of Heaven only as a reward for filial
                confi&#8211; dence in the power of the Lord&#44; and a strict confor&#8211; mity to
                his will &#59; and for disobedience&#44; punishment was denounced. And when our
                nation&#44; in despite of the most solemn warnings&#44; did transgress&#44; calamity
                followed calamity&#44; and they were surrendered to slaughter and slavery&#59; their
                pleasant land was de&#8211; vastated&#59; their fortified towns&#44; which seemed to
                bid defiance to the hand of time&#44; were levelled to the ground&#44; and in vain
                does the inquiring traveller search for the site of some places the most renowned in
                the history of our people &#59; and at others&#44;&#44; the blackened and scattered
                ruins speak&#44; alas &#33; too plainly&#44; that de&#8211; solation has stalked
                abroad over Palestine&#44; and the deserted districts proclaim&#44; that the
                avenger&#39;s sword has done its work. How then can sinners think themselves secure
                from punishment&#63; did it ever fail to strike&#44; though its blows were a long

                David and Solomon&#63; what nation was more refined than that subject to the wisest
                of men&#63; What building was more the pride and ornament of the world&#44; than was
                the temple at Jerusalem &#63; And yet every thing was subverted&#44; and all that
                was noble&#44; with that which <pb n="94"/> 94 THE COVENANT. was grand&#44; was
                overthrown&#44; when sin had sapped the foundation of the holy edifice&#33; Let not
                the wicked then imagine&#44; that he is guarded against the evil&#59; true&#44; his
                path may appear to lead along verdant banks and through flowering meadows&#44;
                &#8212; all nature CD O &#39; may seem to smile upon his undertakings &#59; his
                wis&#8211; dom may seem to cover all his plans&#44; as the shield covers the
                warrior&#44; from all untoward accidents&#33; But suddenly the evil may fly down
                from its hiding&#8211;place&#44; whence it has long been watching its destined
                prey&#44; and alight upon the crest that never stooped &#59; and rend the
                helmet&#44; that withstood a thousand shocks&#59; and shiver the lance which ever
                was victorious&#59; and break the shield&#44; which always protected&#59; and tear
                out the heart&#44; that had ever remained firm &#8212; never knew the throb of fear
                &#8212; never experienced the emo&#8211; tions of pity &#8212; and never succumbed
                to the force of divine guidance. And&#44; believe me&#44; brethren&#44; that&#44;
                however firmly a man may be fixed in prosperity&#44; however grand his views may
                be&#44; and however seem&#8211; ingly boundless his resources&#44; there is a period
                which will come&#44; be it soon or late&#44; when all this grandeur will vanish&#44;
                when the ofi&#39;spring of the mightiest genius will pass away&#44; when the wisdom
                of the wisest will be set at naught. This we have been taught by ages of
                experience&#44; since every thing and every man have been compelled to give way
                before some mightier successor. Thus have systems of government be&#8211; come
                antiquated&#59; thus have monuments of art been hurled from their places&#59; and
                thus have the sayings of the wisest been lost to posterity. And of all that has ever
                yet been held great by men&#44; only one thing has withstood the shock of ages&#44;
                and survives in all <pb n="95"/> THE COVENANT. 95 its youthful beauty&#44; and this
                is THE REVELATION&#34; OF OUR GOD &#33; Years have passed since it was pro&#8211;
                mulgated&#44; nay&#44; our very nation has ceased to be ruled by the statutes it
                contains&#59; yet the Word itself has never perished&#44; and we have the assurance
                of God&#44; that it never will be forgotten&#59; but ages will rise after ages&#44;
                and they shall all drink from the holy foun&#8211; tain&#44; which supplies so
                bountifully the life&#8211;dispensing stream. Let it&#44; therefore&#44; be your

                that man is sinful by dis&#8211; position&#44; and that his inclinations are more
                directed <pb n="97"/> SIN AND REPENTANCE. &#42; 97 to the practice of evil than of
                the good. This is often given as an excuse for manifold transgressions&#44; and the
                worst actions are justified by an appeal to human nature. Men slumber supinely in
                their moral indo&#8211; lence&#44; commit daily what they are admonished is
                evil&#44; and&#44; from an utter prostration of all moral en&#8211; ergy&#44; are
                led&#44; step by step&#44; into that labyrinth of mis&#8211; deeds&#44; where the
                multiplicity of wickedness seems to bar the way for the egress of the sinner. And
                when we ask a man so devoid of virtue&#44; why he does not alter&#63; he says&#44;
                that he cannot help himself&#44; that habit has become second nature&#44; and that
                it is utterly im&#8211; possible for him to tell to the world&#44; by now changing
                his conduct&#44; that he himself considers his former course as wrong&#44; and that
                he has a character for consistency to support&#59; and then he adds some comparison
                be&#8211; tween himself and others&#44; who are perhaps worse in some points&#44;
                &#8212; appeals to some few passages of Holy Writ&#44; or sayings of the wise
                &#40;which he erroneously explains in his justification&#41;&#44; and may proceed
                perhaps so far&#44; as to endeavour to make it appear&#44; that he is&#44; upon the
                whole&#44; a really virtuous and a sincerely pious man&#59; and he thus forbids the
                approach to any one&#44; who might be induced to offer him wholesome advice&#44; and
                to admonish him to pause&#44; lest he sink completely into the slough of corruption.
                &#8212; But&#44; brethren&#44; human nature is not sp wicked as the indolent and
                desi&#94;ninor represent it&#59; &#39;human reason is not so unfortified as some

                REPENTANCE. in human nature &#63;&#34; To these questions we are willing to
                answer&#58; that evil does in reality exist&#44; that&#44; doubt&#8211; less&#44;
                the tendency to sin is one of the principal in&#8211; gredients in our nature&#59;
                but at the same time we contend&#44; that this very tendency is the chief requisite
                to constitute man as God intended him&#44; a mixture both of spirit and matter.
                Look&#44; I pray you&#44; brethren&#44; into the works of the Almighty&#44; a&#34;nd
                you will find&#44; that He has created different orders of beings&#44; who are all
                perfect in the position they &#39; occupy in the scale of creation. There are the
                beasts whose inclinations are purely earthly&#44; and whose desires are never turned
                to the intellectual &#59; they&#39; are perfect in their kind&#44; for these desires
                tend to preserve them alive and propa&#8211; gate their species&#44; and as they are
                not endowed with intellect&#44; no practice of virtue is to them necessary to render
                them happy&#44; and they&#44; therefore&#44; want nothing to satisfy their mind&#44;
                after their appetite is stilled. As virtue is&#44; according to this view&#44;
                incompatible with the nature of animals&#44; the practice of duties arising from the
                same is also incompatible with their nature&#59; and a beast&#44; therefore&#44; has
                fulfilled the object of its creation&#44; if it is careful of its
                self&#8211;preservation. &#8212; Op&#8211; posite to the brute kind stand those
                illustrious mes&#8211; sengers of God&#44; whom we term angels&#59;&#42; these are

                propensities&#44; and having the means to satisfy these desires&#59; or&#44; in
                other words&#44; the beast is purely sensual&#44; the angel purely spiritual&#44;
                and man is a compound of both these characteristics&#44; so that he occupies the
                middle station between the inferior and the higher grades of beings. It is not ours
                to inquire&#44; why God in his wisdom was pleased to form these three varying
                classes of creatures&#59; it is enough for us to know&#44; that so is the fact&#44;
                and we cannot&#44; nay&#44; we dare not attempt to arraign this wisdom before the
                judgment of our circumscribed knowledge. Thus then we must discover&#44; that in the
                gradual ascent from the lower to the higher&#44; which is dis&#8211; played in the
                whole system of nature&#44; it was perfectly consonant with the arrangement of every
                thing as in&#8211; stituted by the Creator&#44; to form man as the point where the
                earthly and the heavenly were to be blend&#8211; ed &#59; and consequently it
                was&#44; of necessity&#44; to be ex&#8211; pected that this being should be
                endowed&#44; from the position he occupies in the scale of nature&#44; with a
                portion of evil along with a great degree of good. You will now see&#44; that the
                ingredient in our nature&#44; which we denominate evil&#44; is counterbalanced by
                the principle of good&#59; or in other words&#44; if God has im&#8211; planted
                within us earthly desires&#44; He has in a degree fully as great made it necessary
                for us to become fa&#8211; miliar with virtue &#59; and that&#44; therefore&#44; it
                is impossi&#8211; ble to imagine a hum&#8211;an being&#8211; ko&#8211; totally
                &#8211;depraved as to be devoid of every good feeling &#59; and we may safely <pb

                of man&#8211; kind&#44; we will not find one individual&#44; however bad&#44; who
                has not in his composition&#44; nay&#44; in his outward deportment&#44; something
                which compels us to acknowl&#8211; edge&#44; that the image of God has not been
                entirely defaced in him &#59; and thus it happens&#44; that the most obdurate
                transgressor bears evidence of the goodness and wisdom of the Creator. If now human
                nature is not so radically defective&#44; as the indolent sinner represents it &#59;
                if&#44; in fact&#44; it is capable of being rendered an ornament and a bless&#8211;
                ing to the possessor &#58; we ought next to inquire how this is to be effected&#44;
                and to look for the means&#44; by which human reason can be fortified to improve
                human nature&#59; or to speak more correctly&#44; how is man to be made acquainted
                with that knowledge which will enable him to do nothing dissonant with the reason
                which was bestowed on him&#44; and to do that only which will elevate the moral good
                in his composition over the moral evil &#63; For if it is once admitted&#44; that
                human nature is not radically defect&#8211; ive &#59; if it is conceded&#44; that
                human reason has a guide to direct its steps to an always progressive improve&#8211;
                ment&#58; it follows&#44; that we have only to know this guide to be in possession
                of the means&#44; if we have the will&#44; to become as good as the shortness of our
                existence here will permit us&#44; &#8212; and let me observe once for all&#44; in
                this place&#44; that this is all which the All&#8211;wise Father demands&#59; and if
                we have faithfully done all that lay in our power&#44; no matter how little soever
                this may have been&#44; we have acted to the satisfaction ~ot our &#39;Salver.
                K&#39;ow&#39; the question re&#8211; curs&#58; &#34;How is human reason to be
                fortified and im&#8211; <pb n="101"/> SIN AND REPENTANCE. 101 proved&#63;&#34; To
                this we answer&#58; &#34;By the revealed word of God &#33; &#34; for this is the
                guide which will lead us in the path we should go&#44; and which will make us
                acquainted with the duties expected from us. In this manner&#44; then&#44; we know
                how to be virtuous &#59; and consequently we can frame no excuse arising from the
                defectiveness of human nature &#40;since there exists none&#41;&#44; for being
                otherwise than morally and religi&#8211; ously good. True&#44; the exercise of
                religious duties may interfere with our convenience&#59; true&#44; the pre&#8211;
                cepts of revelation may not be all alike clear and intel&#8211; ligible to us &#59;
                but then we have the power given to us from above to subdue any obstacle arising
                within our&#8211; selves&#44; from the bent of our inclinations&#59; and to doubts
                springing from a not sufficiently explained reason of any particular precept&#44; we
                can oppose a firm confi&#8211; dence in the Supreme Wisdom&#44; and this confidence
                will teach us&#44; that nothing emanating from God can be otherwise than good&#44;
                otherwise than wise&#44; other&#8211; wise than beneficent and wholesome. It is
                thus&#44; that we can overcome whatever is&#44; according to our limited
                judgment&#44; defective in our composition&#44; and thus we can supply all the light
                which our own unassisted reason would be unable to attain. Here now we see the
                wisdom of God preeminently displayed. He found it consonant with his plan to make
                man a com&#8211; pound of goo4 and evil &#59; a being&#44; in whom the incli&#8211;
                nation to virtue is always contending with the desire for sin&#59; a creature whose
                mind&#44; though rude in its natural state&#44; is yet capable of being polished
                and. improved constantly by instruction and example. If now&#44; no other resource
                besides this capacity had been given&#44; and as outward impressions daily take
                different 9&#42; <pb n="102"/> 102 SIN AND REPENTANCE. forms&#44; and consequently
                convey different ideas&#44; Ave should have man always a prey to counteracting
                principles and a slave to uncertainty. But the other yet wanting resource has also
                been conferred on him&#44; that is&#44; a revelation of what is the truly useful in
                the eyes of God has been handed down&#44; to assist him in combatting the evil&#44;
                and to teach him how to dis&#8211; tinguish between the good and the bad. Revelation
                should&#44; therefore&#44; not be regarded as a restraint so much&#44; as an
                assistant to man in his earthly existence and a sure instructor of righteousness. To
                be virtu&#8211; ous&#44; then&#44; means&#44; so to direct our inclinations and
                actions as the knowledge of the good demands&#44; and always to withstand those
                desires which the word of God declares to be sinful. And sinning is a deviation from
                God&#39;s will as contained in the Bible&#44; superin&#8211; duced by following the
                propensity to evil rather than obeying the commandments of the Lord&#44; and by
                neglecting the duties demanded of us by the religion which was bestowed on mankind
                as the best gift of Heaven. If we next come to investigate the source of sin&#44; we
                shall be able to trace it to two principal causes&#44; to which all others are only
                subordinate&#59; the first is arrogance&#44; &#8212; the second carelessness.
                First&#44; as to arrogance. The vain&#8211;glorious man&#44; who thinks too highly
                of his own importance in the scale of beings&#44; in whose estimation his own
                interest&#44; pursuits&#44; and will&#44; are paramount to all other
                considerations&#44; will not submit to be directed by any one&#44; even if this one
                should be his Maker &#8212; He to whom he owes the obe&#8211; dience a child owes to
                his parents&#44; He to whom he should pay the reverence which a servant should pay
                    <pb n="103"/> SIN AND REPENTANCE. 103 to his master. Yet speak to such a man of
                religion&#44; say aught to him about his having duties to fulfil other than those of
                gratifying his desires&#58; and he will scoff at you as weakminded and
                superstitious&#44; and he will never suffer any thing at all resembling a sym&#8211;
                pathy with the religious feelings of his fellow&#8211;men to disturb his unnatural
                tranquillity&#59; and in this manner&#44; allowing the evil in his disposition to
                prevail&#44; he by degrees sinks lower and lower into the whirpool of
                transgression&#44; and we have before us one who is every way depraved&#44; yet
                assuming all the importance which virtue alone should impart. And still it is true
                that real virtue is always meek&#44; never assuming import&#8211; ance&#44; even if
                due to it&#44; whilst its opposite quality is arrogant&#44; haughty&#44; and
                overbearing&#59; and whenever we find a man thinking highly of himself&#44; boasting
                of his attainments&#44; and recounting his virtues&#44; we may &#39; safely
                aver&#44; that he is destitute both of wisdom and virtue. &#8212; A man&#44;
                therefore&#44; who is arrogant&#44; will naturally enough neglect every pursuit
                except that which will tend to his own glorification &#59; for&#44; as he is so much
                inflated with the idea of his self&#8211;importance&#44; he will yield the reins to
                his inclinations whenever self can be gratified&#44; or interest promoted&#44; and
                thus he must daily stray to a greater distance from the point whither he should
                direct his steps. The careless one on the other hand is deaf to ad&#8211;
                monition&#44; because he imagines that it is impossible for him to make the least
                change in his conduct. To every advice he will answer&#44; that it is out of his
                power to act differently&#44; because his course is con&#8211; sistent with human
                frailty&#44; &#8212; or that he must do a particular thing&#44; because he cannot
                resist his inclina&#8211; <pb n="104"/> 104 SIN AND REPENTANCE. tions&#59; and as an
                excuse for pretermitting any virtue&#44; he may say that ift would expose him to too
                many dif&#8211; ficulties. &#8212; But do you not perceive that one arguing thus
                degrades the name of man &#63; By saying&#44; that his power over himself is
                incomplete&#44; he arraigns the wisdom of the Creator in making him so
                imperfect&#44; &#8212; when he himself alone is to blame&#59; when his own
                supineness alone forbids his making any active exer&#8211; tions&#59; when in truth
                he could be good if he would but listen to the virtuous impulse which is no less
                inherent in him than in the bosom of the best and greatest&#59; and he is thus
                wilfully bad&#44; and he thus trifles away his eternal welfare&#44; by vainly
                imagining that an extraordinary aid from above must be speci&#8211; ally rendered to
                make him religious.&#8212; To avoid sin&#8211; ning&#44; therefore&#44; it is
                necessary to take a proper esti&#8211; mate of ourselves&#44; and to reflect that we
                are neither perfect in wickedness nor unexceptionable in good&#8211; ness&#59; that
                our reason is something&#44; though far from everything&#59; and that the rudeness
                and uncertainty attendant on the uneducated state can easily be re&#8211; moved by a
                careful attention to the divine instruction that is daily offered to us. If thus we
                preserve a proper balance between meanness and pride&#44; and if we look back on the
                one side at our humble origin&#44; and on the other turn our view forward to the
                glorious destiny promised us as the reward of virtue &#58; religion and piety must
                become the object of our chief desire&#44; w r e must unavoidably become
                virtuous&#44; and the very ingredient of evil with which Ave are endowed&#44; must
                give additional firmness to our actions&#44; and addi&#8211; tional circumspection
                to our holy undertakings. But some one may say while doing the wrong&#58; &#34; I
                    <pb n="105"/> SIN AND REPENTANCE. 105 have sinned&#44; I have been wicked&#44; I
                have transgressed&#59; but Holy Writ itself speaks of innate wickedness&#44; of sin
                being a ruler of human nature&#44; I feel the impossi&#8211; bility of altering my
                way of life&#59; besides I have sinned beyond the hope of forgiveness&#59; the very
                name of virtue can never more be coupled with my name&#59;&#34; and arguing so
                despondingly he may perhaps dash blindly onward&#59; try perchance to drown the
                mis&#8211; givings of despair in intemperance&#44; and thus become in fact that very
                outcast which he conceives himself to be. To combat&#44; therefore&#44; this
                wretched sinful&#8211; ness&#44; which would plead the word of God as its ex&#8211;
                cuse&#44; it becomes imperatively necessary first to under&#8211; stand what Holy
                Writ teaches on this subject&#44; and next to inquire if inveterate habits cannot be
                eradi&#8211; cated by means which the Almighty has placed within our power. If we
                examine with candour the texts found in Scripture relative to the power of sin over
                man&#44; we must arrive at the conclusion&#44; that they uni&#8211; formly inculcate
                that&#44; although there is a disposition&#44; and this a powerful disposition&#44;
                to evil&#44; there is yet an inherent power existing to do good in a superior
                degree. For we read in Genesis&#44; chap. iv. 6&#58; &#34; Be&#8211; hold&#33; if
                thou actest well&#44; thou wilt be accepted&#59;&#42; but if thou dost not act
                well&#44; sin will rest at the door &#59; and to thee is its desire&#59; but thou
                canst rule over it.&#34; Here we are told&#44; as clearly as words can do it&#44;
                that no matter how great the internal temptation to sin may be&#44; the internal
                power to subdue such an incli&#8211; nation is still greater. It is indeed true&#44;
                that we are told in another chapter &#40;viii&#41; of the same book that &#42;
                According to the version of others &#58; &#34; Thou canst raise thy eyes.&#34;
                This&#44; however&#44; does not change the signification of the text. <pb n="106"/>
                106 SIN AND REPENTANCE. God said&#58; &#34;He would not again destroy the earth as
                He had done at that time&#44; because the desire of the heart of man is evil from
                his youth&#59;&#34; yet this does not gainsay the position we have assumed&#44; that
                man can do the right&#44; when the right has been explained to him&#59; his
                inclination may lead one way&#44; yet the knowledge of right will point out the
                other and better path&#59; and so he is enabled to do that only which is
                virtuous&#44; despite of his experiencing at the same time a secret yearning
                perhaps&#44; for the most monstrous crime. We read&#44; therefore&#44; in another
                place &#40;Deut. xxx. 15&#8211;19&#41; &#58; &#34;Behold I lay before thee this day
                the life and the good&#44; and the death and the evil &#8212; but choose life.&#34;
                We have consequently incontestable proof to demonstrate that&#44; according to
                scriptural doctrines&#44; we have received from the Almighty all the requisites for
                making us virtuous&#44; and&#44; therefore&#44; no excuse whatever can be drawn from
                the fountain of righteousness as an apology for a deviation from the precepts it
                contains. But as man generally en&#8211; deavours to appear good in the eyes of
                others&#44; though in his own mind he must be convinced that he has no pretensions
                to virtue &#58; he may perhaps seek to account for his sins by saying&#44; that his
                education has been defective&#44; and that having been long in the habit of
                doing&#8211; the wrong&#59; before he was made conscious of its sinfulness&#44; he
                has become entirely unfitted for prac&#8211; tising what he is told to be the duties
                of religion. To obviate this apology for vice&#44; and which is constantly urged by
                many as a complete justification of their re&#8211; missness&#44; we should consider
                that though education must exercise a powerful influence over us&#44; yet we are not
                thereby prevented from being taught better <pb n="107"/> SIN AND REPENTANCE. 107
                rules of conduct than those imbibed in infancy&#44; as we are growing older. If a
                man now finds that his edu&#8211; cation has been actually neglected&#44; he is
                bound to remedy the delect as far as the&#42; light of a better knowledge&#44; which
                by degrees dawns upon him&#44; will enable him to accomplish. Long and inveterate
                habits and tastes may indeed have become very strong&#59; yet it must not be
                forgotten that habit does not root out the germ of virtue&#44; which from its very
                nature is in&#8211; destructible&#59; for the impulse to righteousness will be felt
                even if the moral field be overgrown by noxi&#8211; ous weeds &#59; and it is this
                germ which will sting the arrogant sinner in the height of his pride and glory&#44;
                pursue the blood&#8211;stained murderer into his hidden retreat&#44; and always
                admonish the most heedless trans&#8211; gressor that his conduct is unworthy of one
                created in the image of God. &#8212; If a man&#44; therefore&#44; should have been
                sunk in wickedness&#44; even during the whole course of his life&#44; he should for
                all this at no time despair of again being restored to goodness&#59; for the gates
                of mercy are never closed to him who wishes to enter them. And on this point Holy
                Writ has shown him the means of commencing his reforma&#8211; tion&#44; that is&#44;
                he should confess his sins before God with an humble and contrite heart &#59; for we
                read in Numbers&#44; &#34; And they shall confess the sin which they have done.&#34;
                And this sincere confession of sins before the Creator is the first step towards
                amendment &#59; for when a man re&#8211; counts his misdeeds with a sincerity&#44;
                such as he should exhibit before the Searcher of hearts&#44; he must at the same
                time detect the motives which induced him to sin&#44; and he will therefore be able
                to remedy the dis&#8211; <pb n="108"/> 108 SIN AND REPENTANCE. ease so soon as he
                knows the cause and the seat of it&#44; just as is the case with the medical
                practitioner&#44; who can only successfully contend with the malady&#44; when he has
                discovered what organ is affected&#44; and to what extent his patient suffers. The
                next step necessary is to avoid as much as possible all temptations to sins in
                general&#44; and especially to the particular sin of which he may have been guilty.
                This avoiding of tempta&#8211; tion or opportunity for sin has the effect of making
                crime less familiar&#44; and in consequence&#44; not so neces&#8211; sary to him as
                before&#59; and when he has studiously avoided for some time all approaches of
                wickedness&#44; he may be assured that he is already&#44; in a great degree&#44;
                reformed &#59; and when the same opportunities should&#44; by chance&#44; occur
                again&#44; it is probable&#44; that he will be able to overcome his
                inclinations&#44; and prove thus&#44; that a man may have been habituated to do
                wrong&#44; yet learn by care and watchfulness again to act correctly. If&#44; in the
                same manner&#44; we would but consider on every occasion when we are going to do any
                wrong&#44; be this an act of violence&#44; the infraction of a moral law&#44; or a
                transgression of a religious duty&#44; that we could easily act otherwise&#44; if we
                had only the wish&#58; not half the sin&#44; not half the mischief&#44; not half the
                strife and contention would exist &#59; and men then would be more virtuous and
                happy &#59; and we should&#44; in that case&#44; not be shocked by the everlasting
                causes of affront&#44; by which society&#44; domestic as well as polit&#8211;
                ical&#44; is agitated&#59; and good will and harmony would often occupy the place of
                hatred and revenge&#44; if we would but reflect before we make any angry
                replies&#44; whether the words of our antagonist had been in&#8211; tended to wound
                our feelings&#59; whether the insult be <pb n="109"/> SIN AND REPENTANCE. 109 worth
                noticing&#44; or if it would not be better to over&#8211; look an outrage actually
                received&#44; rather than incur the enmity of even a contemptible person&#44; who
                may have injured us. And let us reflect that&#44; if our neigh&#8211; bour has
                offended us&#44; we also may have offended him &#59; and that all men&#44; the best
                even&#44; need the forgiveness of Heaven. If a man now finds that he has sinned&#44;
                and has an anxious desire to alter his conduct&#58; he ought not to hesitate to
                mortify on every occasion the vices which beset him. For instance&#44; if he should
                discover himself to be avaricious&#44; and that this love of money has often
                interfered with his charitable feelings &#40;which every one possesses&#44; though
                often suppressed by the desire for wealth&#41; &#58; he is bound to counteract his
                avarice on every suitable opportunity &#59; he should by degrees en&#8211; deavour
                to forget&#44; that money was once his idol&#44; and that it is perishable like
                every thing in this life&#44; and if he cannot&#44; succeed in rendering himself
                very liberal&#44; he can yet attain being moderately charitable. &#8212; If a man
                has been in the habit of considering every unguarded word an insult&#44; and of
                resenting such an insult by angry replication or even personal attack &#58; he must
                be extremely careful to shun every cause for quarrel&#44; and never to touch upon
                topics which could at all bring angry feelings into play&#44; either in him&#8211;
                self or others. Perhaps he may yet be latently in&#8211; clined to anger&#59; but
                when no evil effects have flowed from this anger for a considerable time&#44; it is
                probable that he may not be betrayed again into improper ex&#8211; cesses&#44;
                although he may never be able to eradicate&#44; totally&#44; a certain fretfulness
                and irritability of temper. But the highest degree of amendment is&#44; to eradicate
                VOL. I. 10 <pb n="110"/> 110 SIN&#34; AND REPENTANCE. the evil altogether&#44; and
                this end can only be attained by a great and incessant vigilance over every access
                of the vice to which a man may have been addicted&#59; and he should learn to prove
                his perfect amendment even when a convenient opportunity to sin offers&#44; and to
                convince thus every one&#44; that he has regained the mastery over his passions&#44;
                and that he is once more what the Deity intended him to be&#44; when He spoke&#58;
                &#34;Sin hath its desire after thee&#44; but thou canst rule over it.&#34; In the
                same spirit does the Talmud advise&#58; &#34; True repentance must be able to
                withstand temptation at exactly the same time and place&#44; and with the same
                companions of former transgressions. &#34; As a farther means of producing
                reformation&#44; it is necessary that a man should be more diligent in the exercise
                of those virtues&#44; which he may have practised while he was yet merged in
                sin&#44; so that by becoming more wedded to the good in general&#44; he may be
                weaned from the wrong to which he has been ad&#8211; dicted &#59; for it is a
                well&#8211;established principle in morals that one virtue is always the promoter of
                another&#44; as also one crime generally paves the way for the com&#8211; mission of
                more sins. &#8212; To this reason also may be referred the practice of doing penance
                by fasting&#44; praying&#44; and distributing of alms&#44; so universal among
                Israelites&#44; a practice highly laudable&#44; and the cause of much that is good.
                For when a man fasts from pure motives&#44; it must produce a diligent inquiry into
                his conduct&#44; more especially if the fasting be done in consequence of any one
                wrong deed&#44; of which he has been guilty in particular. &#8212; Prayers&#44; when
                offered up with a contrite spirit&#44; will teach a man meekness and <pb n="111"/>
                SIN AND REPENTANCE. 1ll an humble resignation to the will of his offended God&#44;
                which should always accompany true repent&#8211; ance. &#8212; And the distribution
                of alms will&#44; besides af&#8211; fording relief to the indigent&#44; soften his
                heart&#44; and&#44; by making him feel for the woe of others&#44; teach him to feel
                the more strongly&#44; how much pity and mercy he requires of God&#44; how much
                grace he needs to have his sins forgiven. But a sinner may ask &#58; &#34; Will my
                sins be forgiven&#63; is the grace of God extended to one so unworthy as I
                am&#63;&#34; Yes&#44; truly will he find grace who sincerely repents&#59; and&#44;
                if he but once commences with serious earnestness&#44; and with an immovable
                purpose&#44; he may rest assured&#44; that the work of reformation will go on
                prosperously&#44; and that&#44; in recompense therefor&#44; the gracious Father will
                pardon his transgressions&#44; as far as this may be consistent with the rigorous
                and im&#8211; partial justice with which He governs the world. Come&#44;
                therefore&#44; repentant sinner &#33; come and throw thyself at thy Father&#39;s
                feet&#44; &#8212; He will receive thee&#44; although thy misdeeds are great&#59;

                tard not thy return to good from fear of the taunts of thy former associates in sin
                &#59; and reflect&#44; that the mercy thou claimest&#44; can be the reward only of
                sin&#8211; cerity and perseverance&#59; and if tlry wrongs be mani&#8211; fold&#44;
                endeavour to atone for them by a constant aim&#8211; ing after piety&#44; as much as
                lies in thy power. And fearest thou to meet thy God &#63; art thou ashamed to
                approach Him&#44; because thou hast been so long a stranger to his service&#44; and
                unseen within the thresh&#8211; old of his house &#63; Then listen to what He has

                &#8212; The above discourse was intended to present a summary of the causes of

                the chief points are too much crowded together&#44; but I preferred being guilty of
                too much brevity to dividing the subject. Besides&#44; there will be found in the
                sequel several other lectures&#44; where the causes&#44; effects&#44; and remedies
                of sin are more clearly pointed out. It was in compliance with an ancient
                custom&#44; to preach on the subject of Atonement on the Sabbath of Kepentance&#44;
                that I wrote this and several subsequent sermons &#59; and I must here
                acknowledge&#44; that the arrangement I followed above&#44; was partly borrowed from
                a book &#58; &#34;The Vintage of Ephraim&#44;&#34; by the celebrated Kabbi Ephraim
                Luntshetz. The book itself&#44; I have not seen for many years&#44; in fact&#44; not
                since I was a boy&#44; but the general idea of the learned preacher&#44; is still
                the groundwork of the above sermon&#44; and owes to it any merit it may possess.
                DISCOURSE IX. THE CREATION. Father of light and life &#33; who dwellest within us
                all&#44; and in whom all exists&#44; and by whose word all existing things were
                brought unto being&#44; give us thy blessing&#44; and bestow on us through thy grace
                that prosperity&#44; both temporal and everlasting&#44; which we may be thought
                worthy of in the judgment of thy unsearchable wisdom. But&#44; if Thou shouldst deem
                us deserving of punishment&#44; then give us fortitude enough to bear thy paternal
                chastisement in meek resignation&#44; and lead us thus to thy service&#44; which is
                life. Amen. Brethren&#33; Holy Writ speaks emphatically&#58; &#34;The heavens

                verified&#44; at all times and among all classes of men. The man of learning
                will&#44; at the deep hour of night&#44; when darkness has spread her dusky mantle
                over the surface of the earth&#44; forsake his couch&#44; and wander abroad&#44; to
                cast his eye upward to the star&#8211;clad heaven. Behold him standing for
                hours&#44; anxiously gazing as each constellation in succession crosses the meridian
                of his horizon &#8212; see how rapturously he investigates and searches the
                countless host which blazes down upon him &#8212; see how eagerly he notes every
                remark&#8211; able appearance&#44; how joyfully he marks every dis&#8211; covery he
                may happen to make &#58; and then ask him what his feelings are at the moment &#59;
                and he will tell you&#44; that he is seized with a generous enthusiasm &#8212; that
                his heart is warmed by an admiration of the great Creator&#44; and that his mind is
                filled with the greatest awe of reverence for that infinitely good Being&#44; who
                maintaineth all by the potent will of his uu ending power &#33; &#8212; Again&#44;
                bend tlry steps to a distant land&#44; where the savage yet roams free from the
                trammels of civilization&#44; where the rivers yet flow undisturbed by the prow of
                the merchant&#39;s ship&#44; where the primeval oaks expand their boughs untouched
                by the wood&#8211; man&#39;s axe &#8212; and there stand by whilst the untutored
                child of the forest rises from his bed of moss at the early dawn of morning&#44;
                watch his eye how it kindles at the sight of the blushing red which paints the east
                before him&#44; how delighted he appears at seeing the sun elevate his bright disc
                over the flood of the broad stream&#44; on whose banks his little cabin can scarcely
                be perceived &#59; and mark the smile of satis&#8211; faction which lights up his
                countenance&#44; as he utters <pb n="116"/> 116 THE CREATION. his humble prayer to
                the God&#44; who made all which gives him so much delight and happiness. &#8212;
                Yes&#44; go where we will&#44; let us be what we may&#44; the works of God&#44; all
                nature&#44; must admonish us&#44; that there is a Creator&#44; and that to Him we
                all owe our being. And it is this knowledge&#44; which we derive from comparing our
                own existence with that of every thing else around us&#44; that compels us to look
                for an object of worship&#44; one&#44; to whom we may address our desires&#44; and
                one of whom&#44;. he being also superior to any obstacle which can by possibility
                oppose him&#44; we may expect deliver&#8211; ance in all our afflictions. &#8212;
                But&#44; as some persons may not&#44; at first sight&#44; be able to understand&#44;
                how the dis&#8211; covery of our being creatures compels us to be wor&#8211;
                shippers of a Supreme Being&#44; or how it can be de&#8211; monstrated at all that
                there exists such a Power&#58; it may&#44; perhaps&#44; be useful to set the subject
                in a clearly intelligible light by a few illustrations&#44; which must remove any
                thing like doubt from the mind of the thinker. &#8212; I&#44; an individual member
                of the human family&#44; find&#44; after repeated trials&#44; that I am unable to
                produce the substance called iron &#58; I must come&#44; there&#8211; fore&#44; to
                the conclusion&#44; that I cannot do it&#44; and conse&#8211; quently&#44; that I
                could have had no agency in its pro&#8211; duction. Still&#44; as I find this
                substance in existence&#44; and as I must be sure&#44; that the being who produced
                it has more power&#44; thus far&#44; than I have&#44; I must of necessity concede to
                him the superiority in this re&#8211; spect&#44; at least. And so I must proceed at
                a view of every thing&#44; animate or inanimate&#44; and I shall thus&#44; at every
                step of my investigation&#44; discover the supe&#8211; riority of the Author of all
                nature. &#8212; I find myself in trouble&#44; afflicted with diseases which I cannot
                re&#8211; <pb n="117"/> THE CREATION. 117 move&#59; I have sought in vain the
                assistance of creatures like myself&#44; and yet no relief has followed&#59; to whom
                then shall I turn&#44; but to Him who made me&#63; for must I not discover&#44; from
                the very nature of my being&#44; that He who made me and all I see&#44; can&#44; if
                He but will&#44; renew me also&#63; Should He&#44; who created every thing&#44; not
                be able to order things as best comports with his wisdom &#63; &#8212; Again&#44; if
                I take a view of life and the do&#8211; ings of man&#44; the conviction will strike
                me that&#44; to obtain the favour of a mortal like myself&#44; I am bound to act in
                a manner .agreeable to his ideas of right&#44; or in other words&#44; I must try to
                make myself pleasing to the person I wish to propitiate&#44; in order to obtain his
                favour and assistance. If I am now compelled to acknowledge a Supreme Being&#59; if
                every thing ad&#8211; monishes me&#44; that a Power actually does exist&#44; whose
                sway extends over every object which this vast struc&#8211; ture contains&#59; if I
                am assured&#44; that under whatever affliction I may be&#44; He is able and willing
                to extricate me&#59; if I am led to believe&#44; that it is my duty to en&#8211;
                deavour to obtain the favour of this great Being by deeds of mine&#59; if I am again
                convinced that to act otherwise would be injurious to me&#58; it becomes evi&#8211;
                dently my duty&#44; which at the same time corresponds with my interest&#44; to seek
                the favour of the Supreme by the doing of whatever He may call good and right&#44;
                and by avoicling all which He may declare bad and wrong. &#8212; If we&#44;
                according to this view&#44; always regard our relative station to the Deity&#44; we
                must necessarily be inclined to render him the requisite homage&#44; what&#8211;
                ever this homage may be&#59; and as a necessary conse&#8211; quence it follows&#44;
                that we are bound to endeavour to acquire a sure knowledge of all the duties which
                we <pb n="118"/> 118 THE CREATION. are to practise&#44; and of all the wrongs which
                we are to avoid in obedience to the will of our Maker. &#8212; As religion now&#44;
                or more properly speaking&#44; a fulfilment of duties towards God&#44; is by the
                disposition of man quite natural to him&#44; it has been observed&#44; that the
                members of the human family have at all times paid adoration to a Supreme Being&#44;
                or to something which they conceive superior &#58; the first is true worship&#44;
                the second&#44; superstition &#59; still&#44; even this is founded upon the
                dependence which man feels on a higher power&#44; only overshaded and weakened by
                ignorance&#44; or the bad example of others. &#8212; Let us now briefly trace the
                order of various religious establishments&#44; as we find them recorded or hinted at
                in the Bible&#44; till we arrive at the promulgation of the heavenly code&#44; by
                which it pleased Almighty God to organize Israel as his peculiar people. I shall not
                detain you long&#44; brethren&#44; but only take a rapid view of this interesting
                record&#44; to point out to you the peculiar debt of gratitude which you&#44; as
                Israelites&#44; owe to the Disposer of human events&#44; for his great and signal
                goodness&#44; in first rearing you to his service&#44; and next in perpetuating this
                service so miraculously among you. &#8212; We read in this day&#39;s weekly
                portion&#44; the history of the CREATION&#44; which begins in the following words
                &#58; &#34; In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was
                without form and void&#44; and darkness was upon the <pb n="119"/> THE CREATION. 119
                face of the deep&#44; and the spirit of God was hovering over the face of the
                water&#59; and God said&#44; Let there be light&#44; and there was light.&#34; Gen.
                i. 1&#8211;3. In this passage the Pentateuch tells ns&#44; that&#44; when it pleased
                the Almighty Power to call beings of vari&#8211; ous kinds into existence&#44;
                nothing Avas in being&#59; but He&#44; the Almighty&#44; reigned alone in glory&#44;
                in the words of the beautiful hymn&#44;&#42; which we have just now sung&#59;
                &#34;Lord of the universe&#44; who didst reign before any creature was created&#59;
                and at the time that all&#44; according to thy will&#44; was made&#44; then was thy
                name proclaimed king&#59; and after all shall have ceased to exist&#44; Thou
                wilt&#44; Tremendous One &#33; reign alone. For Thou wert&#44; Thou art&#44; and
                Thou wilt ever be in glory&#59; and Thou art One&#44;&#44; and there is no second to
                be associated with Thee in the supreme rule&#59; since Thou art without beginning
                and without ending&#44; and thine is the almighty power and the government.&#34;
                Then the word went forth from before Him&#44; and matter was made from naught&#59;
                and substances&#44; an&#8211; tagonizing in their nature&#44; were mingled&#44; and
                fire and water were joined into one body&#44; and air and earth were mixed&#44; and
                the impenetrable gloom of rayless night hung over this incipient creation. &#8212;
                But the creative spirit of God was abroad&#44; it waved along the chaotic mass&#44;
                and soon was felt the effect of the will of the Lord&#44; when He spoke &#58; &#34;
                Let there be light&#44;&#34; for then&#44; instantaneously&#44; &#34;there was
                light.&#34; Here&#44; in bat four words of the original Scriptures&#44; &#42; The
                hymn q&#94;ij&#44;&#39; jHx&#59; these Discourses were spoken at the con&#8211;
                clusion of the service&#44; &#8212; at first after the concluding hymn&#44; latterly
                before. <pb n="120"/> 120 THE CREATION. we are presented with the most vivid picture
                imagin&#8211; able of the Creator&#39;s power&#59; and no laboured descrip&#8211;
                tion&#44; no matter how elegant&#44; could have presented to our mind any thing half
                so impressive and striking. Allow me&#44; brethren&#44; to draw in this place your
                atten&#8211; tion to the sublimity&#44; perspicuity&#44; and elegance of the
                scriptural language&#59; you are familiar with the Bible from your infancy&#44; it
                is perhaps the first volume that was placed in your hands by your attentive
                parents&#59; and as you have thus early skimmed over its contents&#44; you perchance
                lose&#44; alas&#44; too soon &#33; all knowledge of the vast treasures it
                contains&#59; you peradventure do not think&#44; that a book so common and universal
                as the Bible can afford any instruction to the scholar and the enlightened man. But
                here lies the error &#59; for that which can teach so much that is useful to the
                ignorant&#44; must contain&#44; and does contain too&#44; a vast fund for the
                instruction of&#44; and reflection for&#44; the most learned&#59; and&#44; in
                truth&#44; where do you find so true a portraiture of human life &#63; where so true
                a history of man &#63; where such noble lessons for his government&#63; where that
                impartiality and candour which adorn pre&#8211;eminently the pages of the Bible&#63;
                where that elegance&#44; and brevity&#44; and nervousness of diction&#44; which have
                ever been the source of de&#8211; light and instruction to us&#44; and which address
                them&#8211; selves so much to the heart and the judgment of every inquirer&#63;
                Nowhere else&#44; but in that precious book&#44; which contains the sentence&#58;
                &#34; And God said&#44; Let there be light&#44; and there was light.&#34;
                Darkness&#44; as said already&#44; had hitherto covered the creation&#59; but the
                first step towards the beautiful organization which now delights us every where was
                the creation of light &#59; <pb n="121"/> THE CREATION. 121 and it went out from
                Him&#44; with whom the unquench&#8211; able light dwells&#44; and it spread its
                beneficent rays over all nature&#44; and the creation rejoiced&#44; and the chaos
                was gladdened at its dawn&#44; and gradually every object assumed the place assigned
                to it by the Author of all&#44; and the luminaries were fixed in the immeasur&#8211;
                able space&#44; each in its respective orbit&#44; and the waves of the ocean rolled
                round the earth&#44; and the herbs and trees covered the globe&#44; and the fish
                sported in their watery element&#44; and the birds warbled in the air&#44; and the
                beasts of the land grazed upon luxuriant meadows&#44; and every being seemed happy
                as it came in perfection from the hands of our God. &#8212; To crown his works&#44;
                God made man&#44; at the last&#44; from the dust of the earth&#44; and breathed into
                him the spirit of life&#44; and gave him understanding and knowledge&#44; and
                en&#8211; dowed him more than any other earthly creature with intelligence and
                beauty&#44; and assigned him a com&#8211; panion in every respect suited to his
                wants&#59; and to these two creatures&#44; so greatly endowed&#44; He gave the
                dominion over every thing found on earth. &#8212; Man was&#44; as we are told in the
                account transmitted to us&#44; created with a twofold disposition&#44; one the
                inclination to good&#44; the second the inclination to evil &#59; or&#44; to speak
                more correctly&#44; he had the faculty given him of choosing between doing and
                omitting any act which might come in his way&#44; not being compelled by any
                super&#8211; natural influence to do&#44; nor withheld by the same means from doing
                whatever might suit his fancy or convenience. This being so created and constituted
                was placed in a delightful spot&#44; where every thing necessary for his
                preservation was supplied in abun&#8211; dance&#44; and he was told&#44; that he
                might freely eat of the VOL. i. 11 <pb n="122"/> 122 THE CREATION. fruit of every
                tree in this spot&#44; or garden as it is called&#44; with the exception of one
                tree&#44; called the tree of knowledge of good and evil&#44; which alone was
                for&#8211; bidden to him&#59; at the same time also&#44; he was told&#44; that death
                should be the consequence&#44; as a punish&#8211; ment for the transgression of
                this&#44; the first and only commandment of the Deity. &#8212; You will observe&#44;
                brethren&#44; that no force was laid upon man&#39;s inclina&#8211; tion&#44; he was
                left at liberty to act as he might choose&#59; but with the transgression&#44; he
                was also to take the consequence. And so then it happened&#44; that both the wife
                and man yielded to their inclination&#44; and ate of that which had been prohibited
                to them by their God. Their regret now came too late &#59; and the mer&#8211; ciful
                Avenger soon told them of their doom&#44; that henceforth sorrow and labour should
                be their portion&#44; instead of the uninterrupted enjoyment which had been theirs
                at their first creation&#44; and the separation of the soul from the body was at
                length to ensue&#44; when they had toiled their appointed time on earth. &#8212;
                Yet&#44; even in this altered state&#44; there was .pointed out to them the way of
                happiness &#59; for the Almighty did not cast them off utterly&#44; but immediately
                pro&#8211; vided them with necessaries suited to their altered state&#44; and imbued
                their minds with firmness to oppose resignation to labour&#44; and perseverance to
                difficulty&#59; and He also taught them&#44; that by an humble repent&#8211; ance
                his favour might at all times be obtained&#44; though the transgressions had been
                great. Thus&#44; it came to pass&#44; that man was sent forth from Eden&#44; to
                regain by toil and the practice of virtue the favour of God which he had
                forfeited&#44; by neglecting the only pre&#8211; cept he had received from his
                Maker. <pb n="123"/> THE CREATION. 123 Soon after this&#44; the mortal progeny of
                Adam in&#8211; creased on earth&#44; but they wilfully neglected to pro&#8211;
                pitiate the favour of their heavenly Father&#44; and&#44; re&#8211; gardless of the
                restraints his ordinances had laid on their passions&#44; they indulged in the
                grossest dissipa&#8211; tion&#44; and filled the earth with unnatural deeds of
                violence. God looked down with displeasure upon the misdeeds of his creatures and
                seeing them de&#8211; serving of punishment&#44; He resolved to let justice take its
                course&#44; and it appeared&#44; as though He had changed his policy to mankind&#59;
                for instead of caus&#8211; ing them to prosper and multiply exceedingly&#44; He now
                determined to exterminate the race&#44; that defy&#8211; ingly had said to Him their
                God &#58; &#34; Depart thou from us I&#34; But even in that degenerate age there
                were those who had not departed from the path of righteousness&#44; those who had
                clung unto God&#44; when all others went astray&#59; and they were&#44;
                therefore&#44; singled out for preservation&#44; when all the rest were swept
                away&#44; when the devouring flood buried all beneath the foaming surge&#44; which
                for an entire year covered the surface of the earth like one vast&#44; unin&#8211;
                terrupted&#44; limitless ocean. The rain poured down in torrents for forty days and
                forty nights&#44; the water seemed to rise&#44; and in fact was rising out of the
                bowels of the earth &#59; and every living thing on the dry land was carried
                off&#44; and every vestige of man&#39;s ingenuity was deluged&#44; and only
                Noah&#44; and those with him in the ark&#44; were preserved amidst this general
                ruin. &#8212; Again the family of man multiplied&#44; and they began gradually to
                spread over the face of the earth. They&#44; however&#44; soon forgot&#44; or
                brought themselves to forget&#44; the frightful catastrophe&#44; the <pb n="124"/>

                globe&#44; well assured by the promise of God&#44; that the like calamity should
                never happen again. They lived at the time&#44; of which we are speaking&#44; in the
                plain of Shinar&#44; and they spoke all one language and one dialect&#44; for as yet
                division had not corrupted the tongue of the sons of Noah. But they had been told by
                the divine decree &#58; &#34; Be fruitful and multiply&#44; and fill the earth and
                subdue it&#59;&#34; this they wanted to prevent&#44; they wished not to spread over
                the earth in detached nations &#59; they&#44; therefore&#44; built themselves a
                tower and a city&#44; vainly imagining&#44; that by so doing they might have a
                security that they should never be separated. But God&#44; displeased at their
                opposition to his decree&#44; caused it to happen&#44; that all of a sud&#8211; den
                they spoke different languages&#44; so that one could not understand the speech of
                the other&#44; and they had to cease from their building&#44; and were henceforward
                scattered over the earth. Thus&#44; mankind began to be divided into families&#44;
                and each portion chose a gov&#8211; ernment&#44; such as pleased them best &#59; and
                by degrees the divisions between nations became more strongly marked&#44; the
                greater the distances that divided them&#44; and the more varied their respective
                languages were. But they too soon forgot the punishment they had suf&#8211; fered
                for their rebellion against God&#44; and they neg&#8211; lected entirely the
                precepts they had received from Him. They&#44; indeed&#44; felt the want of a
                worship&#44; and of a being to be worshipped &#59; but the simple truth of One
                universal God did not suit the views of their tyran&#8211; nical rulers&#44; for
                then these too would have been obliged publicly to acknowledge their dependence upon
                the <pb n="125"/> THE CREATION. 125 power of the universal Sovereign of all things.
                They&#44; therefore&#44; endeavoured to lead the minds of the com&#8211; munity
                astray from the true God&#44; and by their emis&#8211; saries and pretended
                wonder&#8211;workers made them be&#8211; lieve that other things&#44; those visible
                to the eyes&#44; had also an inherent power of doing as they liked&#44; un&#8211;
                checked by a superior agency&#44; and they erected altars to the sun&#44; and
                moon&#44; and the whole host of heaven&#44; and made images to represent the
                deity&#44; and bowed down before idols of abomination&#44; and became daily and
                hourly more estranged from the worship of God &#59; till at length they acknowledged
                mere men as gods&#44; nay more&#44; they learnt to worship beasts&#44; some even the
                most loathsome reptiles&#44; and others&#44; lastly&#44; inani&#8211; mate
                substances&#44; to which they in their ignorance and. folly ascribed divine powers.
                To perpetuate these superstitious usages a privileged class was in&#8211;
                stituted&#44; to the members of which pretended secrets were intrusted&#44; and who
                were exempt from public burdens and entirely separated from the rest of their
                countrymen. They feigned to prognosticate future events by the course of
                planets&#44; by the appearance of the clouds&#44; and even by the flight of
                birds&#44; and the inspection of the entrails of slaughtered beasts&#59; and the
                ravings of a maniac&#44; or of a designing im&#8211; postor&#44; were regarded as
                the infallible decree of the God&#44; before whom truth alone can stand. They also
                invented a false account of the origin of the world&#44; and by interposing some
                other sensible and active being between God and man&#44; they withdrew both the
                ignorant and the learned from the path of righteousness&#44; till at last the

                every where&#42; exhibited&#44; and men were rendered infatuated enough to
                believe&#44; that human blood was the most acceptable offering to appease the gods.
                &#8212; This was&#44; indeed&#44; a dreadful&#44; a deplorable state of morals&#59;
                and this horrible in&#8211; fatuation had wellnigh seized the minds of all
                man&#8211; kind&#44; had not a man with a true spirit arisen in that very land where
                idolatry had assumed the loftiest aspect&#44; and where its very grandeur was well
                calcu&#8211; lated to benighten the strongest understanding. It is highly
                probable&#44; that the Chaldeans had made great progress in the knowledge of the
                heavens&#44; and that the priests were the greatest astronomers of those days. They
                had thus the power of enslaving the public mind by foretelling those things
                which&#44; as they well knew from their calculations&#44; were to happen in the due
                course of nature. And yet&#44; among these men it was&#44; where our great ancestor
                lighted for the first time the lamp of the truest and best of sciences &#8212; the
                knowledge of God. &#8212; Yes&#44; brethren&#44; it was in the land of Chaldea&#44;
                that Abram&#44; as he was first named&#44; stepped boldly forth&#44; avowing his
                ac&#8211; knowledgment of the God of heaven and earth alone&#44; and here he
                withstood &#40;as we are told by our tradi&#8211; tions&#41; the trial of the
                greatest personal dangers. For it was natural enough&#44; that the tyrants and
                deceivers of his native land should fear a man whose doctrines might well have
                hurled them from their thrones&#44; when the people had been once convinced that

                and Romans &#59; witness the sacrifice of Ephigenia&#44; and of the consul

                CREATION. 127 rulers were of the same origin with themselves &#59; for you must
                know&#44; that many of these wicked despots had asserted that they were descended
                from deified beings &#33; But our God was Abranrs protection&#44; and He caused him
                to escape unscathed from the fiery furnace&#44; and bid him to go forth from his
                native soil&#44; to spread the knowledge of the Lord in other and more distant
                countries. And much had Abram to suffer whilst on this mission&#44; but all was
                esteemed light by him&#44; who bore his elevation with such great meekness&#44; who
                only labored in the holiest of causes &#59; and&#44; therefore&#44; his virtue was
                recorded on high&#44; and his sufferings were to be recompensed by much hap&#8211;
                piness &#59;&#8212; his name was changed to Abraham&#44; signi&#8211; fying that he
                should be the father of a multitude of nations&#44; and he was blessed with a son at
                the age of a hundred years&#44; and he sunk into the grave&#44; after a long life of
                usefulness and activity. It was thus&#44; that the true knowledge of God ever found
                its defenders in times of the grossest darkness and superstition&#44; and it
                therefore came to pass&#44; that the descendants of this patriarch were singled out
                as the favoured people of God&#44; on account of the virtue of their ancestors&#44;
                and they were prepared by a long period of suffering for the glorious epoch&#44;
                when they were made the de&#8211; positary of God&#39;s will. &#8212; In the mean
                time the world advanced in refinement &#59; but the worship which was pleasing to
                the Almighty was preserved&#44; in all likeli&#8211; hood&#44; among but few&#44;
                except the descendants of the patriarchs&#44; and these were toiling in hopeless
                servi&#8211; tude for cruel masters&#44; in whose land they had at first been
                received as welcome guests. But when <pb n="128"/> 128 THE CREATION. the appointed
                hour had arrived&#44; they were led forth&#44; to be freed in body and disenthralled
                in soul&#44; into the wilderness under the guidance of the great and pious
                leader&#44; Moses&#44; the son of Amram&#44; and at the foot of yon Sinai&#44; in
                the land of Arabia&#44; they were informed of the will of God&#44; and
                certified&#44; that they could gain his favour by an obedience to his laws only.
                &#8212; And did God teach them his law with an ap&#8211; peal to their feelings&#44;
                or by rousing their fears&#63; No&#59; for He announced himself simply &#58; &#34;I
                am the ever&#8211; lasting One thy God&#44;&#34; thus pointing out to them briefly
                their relation to Him&#44; &#8212; that they were crea&#8211; tures&#44; and He the
                Creator &#59; and in this comprehen&#8211; sive revelation they were informed&#44;
                that they owed their life&#44; their freedom&#44; in fact all they could then&#44;
                or at any other time&#44; call their own&#44; to the bounty of Him who addressed
                them &#59; and the conviction was in this way naturally brought to their minds&#44;
                that if they wished to prosper&#44; they must direct their ideas&#44; their hopes
                and their worship to Him&#44; wdio had created them all&#44; and in whose power were
                their lives and happiness. In this light then should the history of the Crea&#8211;
                tion be regarded&#44; as an exposition of our relation to God&#59; and if we reflect
                well on this subject&#59; if we always view ourselves as creatures&#44; dependent
                upon the bounty of the Creator &#59; if on every occasion we search for truth where

                it will be in accord&#8211; ance with the person&#39;s general conduct. Thus a
                man&#44; who commits murder in a violent fit of anger&#44; will doubtlessly have
                been in the habit of indulging in angry outbreaks of passion &#59; and one&#44; who
                habitually gives the reins to his evil desires&#44; will also be found obeying this
                impulse whenever he can. In the same manner&#44; virtue will be found to be&#44; for
                the most part&#44; the child of a good train of thinking&#59; and we there&#8211;
                fore say of one man&#44; that he acts from good princi&#8211; ples&#44; and of
                another&#44; that his principles &#40;or customary &#8211;motives of action&#41; are
                bad. &#8212; The question now arises &#58; &#34;By what process are we to bring our
                mind to a vir&#8211; tuous mode of thinking&#44; and by what means are we to guard
                ourselves against being allured by false ideas of right and wrong&#63;&#34; &#8212;
                You must also observe&#44; breth&#8211; ren&#44; that we a&#44;re very often placed
                in situations&#44; where the motives for choosing between good and evil are very
                nearly balanced&#44; if we take merely a superficial view of the case &#59; and it
                requires the exercise of a great degree of fortitude and forbearance&#44; to remain
                firm in the practice of the right&#44; especially if it should happen&#44; that the
                greater portion of those around us&#44; <pb n="132"/> 132 PIOUS REFLECTIONS. do the
                wrong or neglect the good. &#8212; With these views premised&#44; let us proceed to
                the following moral apho&#8211; rism&#44; from the third chapter of the Proverbs of
                the Fathers &#58; &#34; Akabia the son of Mahalalel said&#58; Consider well three
                things&#44; and thou wilt not be led into the power of sin &#59; reflect on thy
                origin&#44; whither thou art going&#44; and before whom thou must once render an
                account of thy actions. Thou comest from an obscure origin &#59; thou goest to a
                place of dust&#44; worms&#44; and corruption &#59; and thou must be at length judged
                by&#44; and render an account of thy doings before the King of the mightiest
                kings&#44; the Holy One&#44; to whom be praise.&#34; The words of this wise moralist
                convey to us the. guide which is to lead us in every transaction of life&#44; and
                which&#44; if properly followed&#44; will always preserve us from the power of sin.
                In a former discourse&#44; we have defined sin to be a departure from the
                command&#8211; ments of God&#44; superinduced by preferring to obey the inclination
                to evil which is within us. To avoid&#44; therefore&#44; obeying the evil
                impulse&#44; we are advised by our wise men to reflect well upon our origin&#44; our
                end&#44; and our ultimate destination&#44; inasmuch as we are destined to appear in
                judgment before the dread and impartial Judge&#44; who notices all our actions.

                super&#8211; intendence of God are displayed too palpably to es&#8211; cape the
                notice of the inquirer after truth. And no nation&#44; however great its power&#44;
                however ancient its first rise&#44; has had more examples in its history of great
                deeds done by small means&#44; than we can show &#8212; we&#44; the descendants of
                Israel&#44; selected from among all nations by the All&#8211;wise Ruler to be his
                people &#8212; to be devoted to his service &#8212; and to be a beacon to all other
                families of the earth. &#8212; Truly&#44; well may Israel say &#58; &#34; Oft have

                whelmed with confusion&#44; when every thing seemed to yield before the
                oppressor&#39;s power. I am not going to dilate upon our miraculous deliverance from
                Egypt&#59; not upon the victory of Deborah over Sis&#8211; serah&#59; not upon the
                slaughter of Senaherib&#39;s host&#59; not upon the return of the captives under
                Ezra and Zerubbabel &#59; but I will only speak of the occasion of the festival of
                the Dedication rojn which we cele&#8211; brate this day. In the outset&#44; let me
                remark&#44; that never was a more entire confidence in God&#44; or a more heroic
                self&#8211;devotion&#44; displayed at any period of our national existence&#44; than
                at the time of the brave family of the Asmoneans. &#8212; The Jews who had returned
                from Babylon&#44; by the express permis&#8211; sion of the Persian king&#44;
                Cyrus&#44; lived safely and peaceably in their own land for many years&#44; secured
                from foreign danger by the protection of the power&#8211; ful Persians&#44; and in
                domestic peace&#44; because they were guided by the word of God&#44; and
                administered the holy law according to its letter and spirit. But at the downfal of
                the Persian monarchy&#44; Alexander of Macedon became master of Judaea&#44; and
                after his death&#44; it first fell to the share of one&#44; then to that of another
                of his successors&#44; till at last it remained with the king of Syria. It was about
                this time&#44; that the philosophy of the Grecians exercised a very pernici&#8211;
                ous influence over some of our nations&#44; who wished&#44; foolishly&#44; tb be
                freed from the strict and&#44; to them&#44; burthensome regulations of the Jewish
                law&#59; and&#44; with regret&#44; it must be confessed&#44; that so great was the
                degeneracy of the people&#44; that there could be found a man&#44; who by bribery
                induced the cruel An&#8211; tiochus Epiphanes&#44; more properly called
                Epimanes&#44; <pb n="142"/> 142 THE FESTIVAL OF HANUCKAH. signifying the madman&#44;
                to dispossess the virtuous Onias from the sacred office of high priest &#59; and
                hav&#8211; ing thus shown his contempt for the dignity he un&#8211; worthily
                coveted&#44; he exchanged his name of Joshua for the Greek one of Jason&#44;
                imagining&#44; perhaps&#44; to acquire more of the favour of the tyrant the more he
                assimilated to the ruling nation&#44; even as regards the name he bore. But as the
                wicked generally lay the foundation of their own ruin&#44; so did the unworthy
                priest of whom w T e are speaking &#59; for a relative of his own&#44; by the name
                of Onias&#44; who had assumed the Grecian name of Menelaus&#44; overbid &#8211;him
                with the fickle despot&#44; who accordingly dismissed Jason and installed Menelaus
                in Aaron&#39;s holy office. How great must have been the wickedness of those
                days&#44; when the station&#44; which had been intended as the portion of the wisest
                and best of all the servants of the altar&#44; was sold by an alien to our
                blood&#44; for money&#59; and the more so&#44; as the sacred vessels of the temple
                were purloined to pay the bribe&#44; and as the virtuous Onias was slaughtered&#44;
                because he dared in holy and honest indignation to raise his voice against the
                sacrilege. Deeds of such unexampled impiety were but too well calculated to bring
                all the sacred ordinances of the law into disrepute&#44; since the people at large
                could not help looking down with deserved contempt upon ministers stained with so
                many vices&#59; and there was&#44; therofore&#44; great danger that the com&#8211;
                munity might be induced to throw off that worship&#44; which they saw administered
                by men whom they were forced to regard with aversion for their mis&#8211;
                conduct&#44; with jealousy too&#44; at finding elevated so much above them men who
                were evidently not en&#8211; <pb n="143"/> THE FESTIVAL OF HANUCKAH. 143 titled to
                this elevation by a superior degree of moral excellence. &#8212; To increase this
                danger arising from a general laxity of principles&#44; persecution added its
                terrors. For when Antiochus had gone to subju&#8211; gate Egypt to his power&#44;
                and it being reported that he had died&#44; Jason endeavoured to repossess himself
                of the dignity of high&#8211;priest&#44; which he had lost&#44; as said already&#44;
                by the treachery of Menelaus&#44; and hav&#8211; ing obtained possession of his
                person he shut him up in the fortress of Acra. But Antiochus was not dead &#59; and
                hearing of the revolt of Jason&#44; he construed it into a rebellion of the whole
                people&#59; he therefore marched against Jerusalem&#44; and butchered&#44; without
                remorse or pity&#44; tens of thousands of the helpless inhabitants&#44; and sold
                tens of thousands of free&#8211;born men into slavery. Yet even this excess of
                cruelty did not satisfy this barbarous heathen king&#59; for su&#8211; peradded to
                his deeds of blood&#44; he now began a war against the religion of the Lord &#59; he
                pillaged the temple&#44; and desecrated the holy altar&#44; by command&#8211; ing a
                swine to be sacrificed upon it&#44; there&#44; where naught but offerings agreeable
                to our Father were to be brought&#44; where none but the righteous sons of Aaron
                were ever to officiate. Imagine to yourselves the horror which must have seized
                those Israelites who loved their God with all their heart&#44; a&#39;t seems&#58;
                the desecration of whatever was the holiest of all things on earth &#58; and then
                picture to yourselves&#44; how grieved they must have been&#44; when finding that
                they&#39; had not the power to avert the evil&#44; nor the strength to avenge
                themselves on their insolent oppressors. Though so much blood had already been
                shed&#44; An&#8211; tiochus&#39;s thirst for slaughter was not stilled &#59; and he
                    <pb n="144"/> 144 THE FESTIVAL OF HANUCKAH. made the occasion of a defeat lie
                suffered from the Romans a pretext for farther oppression of the Jews&#59; and in
                fact he determined to exterminate the whole race. The tyrant found a ready
                instrument in one Apollonius&#44; who&#44; whilst the whole people were en&#8211;
                gaged in peaceful worship on a Sabbath&#8211;day in the city consecrated to the
                service of God&#44; ordered his soldiers to fall upon the unresisting and
                defenceless multitude &#59; and fearfully did the slaughter rage&#44; for all the
                males were slain&#44; till the streets were red with the streaming gore of uncounted
                victims&#44; and the women were reserved for a more cruel fate even&#44; for they
                were led away as captives into hopeless slavery. Apollonius next broke down the
                walls of the city&#44; pillaged it and set fire to it in many places &#59; and to
                curb the indignant spirit of a brave people&#44; he built a fortress on the highest
                part of Mount Zion&#44; to keep the city and temple under perpetual exposure from
                his irruptions. Thus the enemy silenced the voice of the holy worship&#44; made the
                sacrifices cease&#44; and cast the whole house of Israel&#44; that yet remained&#44;
                in mourning. As if not enough had yet been done&#44; Antiochus commanded now&#44;
                that all his subjects should conform to one mode of worship. &#8212; He pro&#8211;
                hibited the covenant of Abraham&#44; interdicted the observance of the Sabbath&#44;
                compelled many to eat the flesh of the swine&#44; and&#44; most horrible&#33; a
                statue of an idol was&#44; by his orders&#44; erected on the altar of
                burnt&#8211;offerings&#44; where the heathens then worshipped in the place of
                God&#39;s chosen priests &#33; &#8212; Yet even this bitter persecution had its
                happy effects upon the Jews. Please to remember&#44; brethren&#44; what has been
                just said&#44; that the philosophy and manners of the Grecians&#44; who <pb n="145"
                /> THE FESTIVAL OP HANUCKAH. 145 had obtained the mastery over all the countries
                bor&#8211; dering on Palestine&#44; were beginning to be the cause of fearful
                apostacies &#59; so much so indeed that&#44; as we have seen&#44; two men&#44; who
                possessed the dignity of high&#8211;priest&#44; bought their offices from
                heathens&#44; adopt&#8211; ed heathen names&#44; and introduced such customs&#44; as
                were entirely opposed to the retired and virtuous mode of life so strongly
                recommended by the Bible. We may&#44; therefore&#44; regard it as a special
                miracle&#44; that the Jews were made to feel the tender mercies of the heathens&#44;
                whose manners they had begun to adopt&#44; and they could thus easily distinguish
                between the effects which the benign and tolerant precepts of the Mosaic code were
                intended to produce&#44; and the consequences of the destructive and intolerant
                sys&#8211; tems of paganism. There was now&#44; moreover&#44; an opportunity offered
                to those yet firm and true to their God&#44; to display their constancy &#59; and we
                must look back with a religious satisfaction upon the un&#8211; flinching
                resignation of the martyrs&#44; who suffered the most excruciating torments&#44;
                rather than offend against the will of God. Well known is the history of
                Hannah&#39;s seven sons&#59; also the noble resistance of the aged Eleazer&#44; who
                embraced a glorious death&#44; to teach the young how to die willingly in the
                de&#8211; fence of the holy law&#44; when life can be purchased only by dishonouring
                it. &#8212; Thus&#44; the ancient spirit of the people began to revive&#44; amidst
                the persecutions which now had spread all over the country&#44; like the elastic bow
                that recoils the more forcibly&#44; the stronger it has been bent &#59; and it was
                this spirit of virtue and bold defiance of the oppressor&#39;s power&#44; which was

                idolater. There lived in the town of Modin an aged man by the name of
                Mattathias&#44; son of Yocha&#8211; nan&#44; the high&#8211;priest&#44; famed for
                virtue and an ar&#8211; dent zeal for his religion&#44; and father of five sons&#44;
                worthy of such a parent &#59; their names were&#44; Yocha&#8211; nan&#44; Simon&#44;
                Judas&#44; Eleazer&#44; and Yonathan. It hap&#8211; pened about this time&#44; that
                an officer of Antiochus&#44; Apelles&#44; arrived at Modin&#44; to enforce the
                king&#39;s de&#8211; crees against the Jewish religion. It was of course to be
                expected&#44; that a man of Mattathias&#39;s standing was to be brought over to the
                cause of idolatry by offers the most tempting &#59; for then&#44; as in later
                times&#44; our adversaries thought it justifiable to bribe us into apostacy&#44;
                when open force or persuasion would not succeed. But the venerable sage would not
                listen to the insidious proposals&#59; he proclaimed aloud&#44; that the faith which
                his fathers had acknowledged&#44; was the one to which he would firmly adhere to the
                mo&#8211; ment of his dissolution &#59; nay&#44; he even set the exam&#8211; ple of
                open resistance&#44; as he slew&#44; in the moment of holy zeal&#44; an apostate
                Jew&#44; who was going to sacri&#8211; fice to the idol&#59; and in addition&#44;
                the messenger of Antiochus fell by his hands. The sacred work once begun&#44; he
                summoned the citizens to follow him&#44; and in the mountain fastness they organized
                themselves&#59; and rapidly the numbers of defenders increased&#59; and with
                prudence and unflinching courage they con&#8211; ducted their . heroic
                enterprise&#44; and they proceeded to overturn the heathen altars in many
                places&#44; to enforce the observance of the law&#44; and to re&#8211;establish the
                provincial places of meeting for public worship &#40;the Synagogues&#41;&#44; whilst

                Grecians. Mattathias had the happi&#8211; ness to behold the prosperous progress of
                the work of regeneration&#44; and&#44; crowned with immortal glory&#44; he resigned
                the command to his son Judas&#44; after which the aged warrior sunk into the arms of
                death&#44; and was interred in his native city&#44; Modin. Judas&#44; surnamed the
                Maccabee&#44; was a successor worthy of his glorious parent&#44; and he initiated
                his warriors by many a gallant deed of arms&#44; by surpris&#8211; ing fortified
                places and garrisoning them &#59; and in this manner he secured to himself places of
                retreat in case of any misadventure. Having thus trained his small army&#44; he at
                length advanced against the proud and confiding enemy in the open field&#44; where
                he was met by Apollonius&#44; governor of Samaria&#44; whom he conquered and slew.
                Seron&#44; another general of Antiochus&#44; shared the same fate in a battle which
                he fought against Judas&#44; to revenge the death of Apollonius. But Antiochus was
                not willing that the despised Jews should so easily regain their independ&#8211;
                ence &#59; he therefore sent an immense host to extinguish the people&#44; whose
                laws he hated&#44; and whose power he esteemed lightly. Nicanor&#44; then&#44; and
                Gorgias&#44; and Ptolemy Macron&#44; advanced against the feeble army of Judas with
                an army of forty thousand foot and seven thousand horse&#59; and in their train
                followed a great number of slave&#8211;merchants&#44; who were to pur&#8211; chase
                as many of the Israelites as should be made captives&#44; in order that their price
                should furnish the king with means to pay the arrears of the tribute due to the
                Romans. Vain imagination &#33; for no booty&#44; nor captives fell into their
                hands&#59; but&#44; overwhelmed with confusion&#44; they were compelled to fly

                their hlood in the cause of God. Judas had assembled six thousand men at
                Mitzpah&#44; a city famed for the victory achieved over the Philistines&#44; in
                former times&#44; by the prophet Samuel&#44; through his intercession with God for
                the then equally oppressed people. According to the ancient and hallowed custom the
                men under Judas fasted here&#44; and prayed fervently for protection from above&#44;
                in their almost hopeless situation&#59; and though his army was barely an eighth
                part of the Syrian host&#44; Judas nevertheless made proclamation in obedience to
                the Mosaic law&#44; that every one who had built a house&#44; planted a
                vineyard&#44; espoused a woman&#44; or was afraid to meet the foe&#44; should return
                home &#59; and in consequence&#44; but three thousand remained with the hero&#44; to
                combat the forty&#8211;seven thousand of the enemy. But every breast of this little
                band was a fortified tower&#44; and the enemy dared not hope to march to
                victory&#44; but over the prostrate bodies of every one of the fearless defenders of
                the righteous cause. By a series of masterly manoeuvres Judas overcame the troops of
                Gorgias&#44; who were compelled to seek safety in flight. But in their success&#44;
                the Jews did not for&#8211; get the Disposer of all human events&#44; and the

                the sacred edifice de&#8211; faced&#44; and were conscious that every thing had been
                profaned by the unclean hands of the pagans&#63; But they instantly commenced the

                the spoils which had fallen into their hands&#44; and they celebrated the feast of
                Dedication for eight days&#44; amidst universal rejoicing and thanksgiving. It is
                said that&#44; as they re&#8211;entered the temple&#44; they found that all the oil
                appropriated for the service had been defiled by the Syrians&#44; except one
                cruet&#44; sealed with the seal of the high&#8211;priest&#44; which&#44;
                however&#44; contained only enough for one day&#39;s supply. You must know that&#44;
                according to the twenty&#8211;seventh chapter of Exodus and the twenty&#8211;fourth
                of Leviticus&#44; the oil for the service of the temple was to be pure&#44; and
                especially destined for the purpose. It now came to pass&#44; that the oil found in

                days of the festival of Consecration&#44; which we are this day celebrating. It is
                needless to pursue farther the account of the victories of the valiant Maccabee&#44;
                as history&#44; accessi&#8211; ble to you all&#44; has furnished us a detail of the
                facts. I only intended to sketch&#44; as briefly as possible&#44; the origin of the
                eight days of Hanuckah&#44; and to point out to you the wonderful occurrences
                connected with them. We have seen how the heathens triumphed&#44; how they satiated
                their fierce revenge&#44; and how they glutted their desire for blood&#44; whilst
                the trespasses of a great portion of the people justly devoted them to the vengeance
                denounced in the law. Again it has been shown&#44; how the subsequent persecutions
                gave to the noble&#8211;minded amongst us an opportunity of proving how much they
                valued the sacred inheri&#8211; tance derived from their ancestors&#44; and how
                gladly they resigned all&#44; when life and security could be purchased only at the
                price of apostacy. &#8212; We have it also proved&#44; how utterly unavailing were
                all the artifices of the foe to extirpate the religious feelings of the Jews by all
                the means which his cruelty could devise&#44; and how he was overcome&#44; and his
                great armies conquered&#44; by the few who remained true to the belief of their
                ancestors. &#8212; Let us reflect &#8212; was this not a glorious proof of the
                Divine protection &#8212; when the nation of Israel was preserved by apparently so
                inadequate physical means from amalgamating with the heathens on the one hand&#44;
                and extermination by countless swarms of warriors on the other&#63; &#8212; Well
                might Israel say&#58; &#34;Full often have enemies pressed me hard from my
                youth&#44; yet they did not overcome me&#59; for the righteous Lord hewed asunder
                the ropes <pb n="151"/> THE FESTIVAL OF HANUCKAH. 151 of the wicked.&#34; And so it
                ever was. Age after age has looked with a jealous eye on the insignificant numbers
                of the Hebrews&#44; and no artifice has been left untried to inveigle them to
                apostacy&#59; yet the Jews remain a people before the Lord. The sword of persecution
                has been often unsheathed&#44; but gladly did millions of victims stretch out their
                necks to re&#8211; ceive the death&#8211;stroke&#44; and sealed with their
                life&#39;s blood their attachment to One God&#33; The stake was kindled&#44; and the
                children of Yeshurun were promised life and honour&#44; if they would but swerve
                from their belief in a single article&#59; but they exclaimed&#58; &#34; The Lord
                our God is the only Eternal Being&#33;&#34; and hastened into the embrace of a cruel
                death&#44; as though they were hurrying to a great festival. Victim after victim was
                led forth&#44; yet thousands were still ready to follow the holy example &#33;
                &#8212; It is not to be denied&#44; that human passions&#44; unconnected with any
                thing sacred&#44; may stimulate multitudes to sacrifice them&#8211; selves for the
                sake of some cherished opinion. But where is that people which has suffered&#44;
                with so much constancy as the Jews have done&#44; the contumely of nations&#44; the
                hatred of sovereigns&#44; the derision of the worthless&#63; Is this not suffering
                the rack and death in every man&#44; in every woman&#44; in every child of the
                people&#63; And then let us consider&#44; how steadfastly all was borne&#44; how
                nobly we submitted to all&#44; and to every one&#94; of the many vexations in
                defence of the best gift of Heaven &#33; And instead of advancing the political
                influence of their caste&#44; as may have been the case with martyrs for other
                systems&#44; the Israelites that died for their religion never could hope for such a
                result&#59; for there was no contest waged for superiority&#44; <pb n="152"/> 152

                their friends&#59; for alas&#33; our nation has been power&#8211; less for tens of
                centuries&#44; and none but He above can be looked to as the avenger of the innocent
                blood. Besides the number of their followers could not be augmented by their heroic
                suffering&#59; for we do not look for an outward increase&#44; till the time of the
                Lord arrives &#59; and&#44; if any thing&#44; their example would draw the line of
                separation more broadly&#44; and confine our people to their own members
                exclusively&#44; as to a cer&#8211; tainty the strict adherence of our martyred ones
                was nowise calculated to invite strangers&#44; who had followed an easier and freer
                law&#44; to the adoption of the Mosaic system. None&#44; therefore&#44; but the most
                prejudiced can deny&#44; that the sacrifice of so many useful lives proves&#44; that
                the Israelites conceived the law to be vital to their existence&#44; that they
                considered the mingling with the mass of mankind&#44; and coalescing&#59; with the
                nations&#44; as a calamity to be avoided even at the ex&#8211; pense of life &#59;
                and consequently&#44; as universal princi&#8211; ples of right cannot be changed by
                circumstances and time&#44; it must farther be conceded&#44; that at the present day
                too we are bound to follow their foot&#8211; steps in so far as to maintain&#44; at
                all hazards&#44; the pre&#8211; cepts and the supremacy T of the code of Moses. Yet
                it may be urged&#44; although without much rea&#8211; son&#44; that vigilance is not
                any longer called for&#44; since&#44; at the present moment&#44; all persecution has
                ceased&#44; since now Israel is no more exposed to hatred for opinion&#39;s
                sake&#44; since the nations of the earth regard us with a more favourable eye&#44;
                and since the bonds of thraldom are broken &#59; and that therefore we may at the

                age&#44; and assimilate in manners and in the language of public worship to the
                people among whom we live. In fact such reasoning would go far to break down the
                uniformity of rule and language which has hitherto&#44; and for so long a
                period&#44; prevailed among the Jews. But hear me&#44; brethren&#44; hear me you who
                are descended from the patriarchs&#44; and re&#8211; mark what I say&#44; that this
                very state of fancied se&#8211; curity is the most hurtful to our independence as a
                religious community. Understand me&#44; I do not say&#44; that we should&#44; even
                if we could&#44; separate our interests fro.m those of the nations under whose
                protection we so happily enjoy security&#44; under whose shadow we advance so firmly
                in the path of science and the noble unfolding of the mind&#59; for we are commanded
                by God&#44; through the mouth of the prophet Jeremiah&#44; &#34;to seek the peace of
                the city in which we live&#59; &#34; and it has accordingly always been our
                custom&#44; in every country where we were permitted to rest for a while to recruit
                our strength and to refresh our weary limbs&#44; to pray for the welfare of the
                government and the administrators of justice. Nevertheless&#44; a sense of duty now

                honourable for antiquity and virtue&#44; or any nation in possession of more
                ele&#8211; vated maxims of piety than the Jewish people &#33; The consequences of
                this spirit of intolerance show them&#8211; selves from time to time in the efforts
                which are made to bring the Jews to apostacy&#44; either by direct bribes&#44; or by
                inducements that offices and honourable pre&#8211; ferment should be given as the
                price for an outward change of faith. Add to this&#44; that the courtesy now shown
                us has unfortunately induced too many already to relax from the severity of the
                burdens of the law &#59; and by mixing too freely with other nations some have

                still we cannot rest in perfect security&#44; whilst we are regardless of the duties
                to onr God. It seems fatal to us Jews to depart therefrom&#44; and during the whole
                of our existence we have ever found&#44; that those nations even that were&#44; from
                the nature of their wor&#8211; ship&#44; friendly to every system of polytheism&#44;
                always regarded with aversion&#44; and persecuted too very often the followers of
                One God &#59; so that concessions will on the one hand draw down upon us the just

                the paltry favour of the gentiles&#44; even if it could in the slightest degree be
                valued against the positive loss we incur by offending the Lord. Menelaus&#44; when
                he purloined the sacred ves&#8211; sels of the temple&#44; no doubt thought that the
                purchase of the office of high&#8211;priest through sacrilege from the heathens
                would have no evil consequences &#59; the peo&#8211; ple of those days perhaps
                imagined&#44; that the imita&#8211; tion of the customs of the Greeks&#44; which
                favoured the pursuit of pleasure so mucb more than the retired manners of the
                Jews&#44; would produce only the hap&#8211; piest result&#58; and yet we have
                seen&#44; in the brief sketch just given&#44; how near these same causes brought the
                children of Israel to the very brink of extirpation. Let this then operate as a

                    <pb n="161"/> THE FEAR OF LOSS. 161 Brethren &#33; Among the causes which tend
                to withhold man from the pursuit of religion&#44; the fear of incurring temporal
                loss stands preeminent&#44; especially if his circumstances should compel him to
                seek his bread by daily labour. Such a one will refuse to rest on the Sabbath&#44;
                under the plea that he is unable to pre&#8211; termit his work one or two clays
                every week&#44; since his unremitted toil will barely furnish him with a livelihood.
                He acts and speaks as though it were his exertions&#44; aided by his ingenuity&#44;
                which could secure him against want &#59; he forgets his dependence on a higher
                Power&#44; and he places not an undivided confidence in Providence&#44; who &#34; in
                giving life&#44;&#34; as our wise men express it&#44; &#34; will also provide
                food.&#34; And if you speak to one of this class about his religious duties&#44; he
                will tell you&#44; that his circumstances forbid his observing them &#59; that an
                attendance at the house of God would expose him to too great a loss of time and
                money &#59; others more favoured than he may find it convenient to give charity and
                to assist the poor&#44; but that he ought to be exempt from the burthen of troubling
                himself about other people&#39;s wants. He will not&#44; however&#44; confess&#44;
                even to himself&#44; that there is aught blame&#8211;worthy in his conduct&#59; for
                he almost invariably flatters himself with the opinion&#44; that God will not look
                with displeasure upon one who honestly endeavours&#44; to pursue his calling&#44;
                and withholds not from the humblest individual his just dues. And should a man&#44;
                like this&#44; even say&#44; that he will do better when his circumstances
                improve&#44; it is highly probable that this period will never arrive &#59; for if
                he should amass uncounted wealth&#44; and be blessed with 14&#42; <pb n="162"/> 162
                THE FEAR OF LOSS. whatever his heart desires&#44; he will still find a new set of
                excuses to suit his more improved condition&#59; and death may close his life&#44;
                before he has arranged&#44; much less carried into execution&#44; the proposed plans
                for his self&#8211;amelioration. This eagerness for wealth&#44; and this fear of
                being poor have been a prevailing cause of much irreligion at all times&#44; and our
                daily experience teaches us&#44; that many&#44; alas &#33; yield all their energies
                to the obtainment of the coveted worldly blessings&#59; and though often advised of
                the nothing&#8211; ness of gold&#44; though exhorted to seek for higher riches&#44;
                the race for aggrandizement is still pursued by the many&#44; &#8212; the path of
                real virtue trod by but few devoted spirits. I may&#44; therefore&#44; be asked&#44;
                What is the good to be derived from public exhortations &#8212; what effect can a
                moralist look for from telling the world of their failings &#63; Or&#44; I may be
                told that as the sinner will do as he pleases&#44; and as it is needless to provoke
                his resentment&#44; it were much better to let every one pursue his own way&#44;
                without attempting to interfere with him. To all these and similar ob&#8211;
                jections against the utility of public addresses in our places of worship&#44; I
                wish to put in the following plea&#44; trusting that the candid will see therein a
                per&#8211; fect justification of the task I have&#44; though unusual at present
                among us&#44; voluntarily assumed&#44; and in which I hope to be able to persevere
                with the bless&#8211; ing of Heaven. I know full well&#44; that there is no mode of
                convincing any one of the necessity of being a strict Israelite&#44; if the sacred
                volume does not speak to his heart&#44; if he does not feel in his inmost soul&#44;
                that every precept it contains is obligatory upon him in consequence of its being an
                edict of the Supreme <pb n="163"/> THE FEAR OF LOSS. 163 Wisdom &#59; moreover it is
                no secret to me&#44; that but little favour can be gained by the exposition of any
                fault to which a community or any member thereof may be addicted. Yet do I think it
                my duty to teach fearlessly what our law says concerning the neglect of the divine
                precepts&#44; be the cause sordid avarice or forgetfulness of our obligations to
                God&#59; hoping to be able at least to rouse a spirit of reflection in some&#44; if
                I cannot even convince all of the justness of the views&#44; which&#44; as an
                Israelite&#44; I honestly entertain &#59; and trusting that my feeble admonitions
                maybe made the instrument of bringing back&#44; one day &#40;though none of us may
                live to see it&#41; a few to the pale of our holy faith &#58; and should this even
                not come to pass&#44; to make the memory of those glorious men more respected&#44;
                who have gone down to the tomb&#44; after having all their lives adhered
                strictly&#44; and paid un&#8211; flinching obedience&#44; to the statutes which were
                handed down as an inheritance to the congregation of Jacob. Whilst on the subject
                let me state in this place&#44; once for all&#44; that no allusion shall ever be
                made to any person in particular&#44; as manners and not men are alone lit subjects
                for our inquiries&#59; but at the same time&#44; sins shall always be condemned&#44;
                no matter who the sinners are. This muchT would desire you to bear in mind that&#44;
                as I deem personalities unfit to be in&#8211; troduced in moral lectures&#44; and as
                any such allusions should be carefully avoided&#44; nothing whatever&#44; that I may
                have to advance in the course of the addresses I may make to you&#44; should be
                looked upon in a light as though I were desirous to harrow up&#44; wantonly&#44; the
                feelings of any one of my hearers. If any there are&#44; to whom a portion of what
                is said should happen <pb n="164"/> 164 THE FEAR OF LOSS. to apply &#59; if they so
                feel it within themselves &#58; let them &#8212; not blame the preacher who is
                anxious for their improvement &#8212; but ponder well on the doctrines advanced&#59;
                let the admonitions be the means of causing them to search well into their
                conduct&#59; of noting every&#44; or any particular act of their life &#59; and if
                they find themselves in the wrong&#44; let them mend their course speedily&#44;
                whilst yet the vigour of youth or the strength of manhood remains &#59; whilst yet
                they have the mastery over their inclinations &#59; before decrepid old age&#44; or
                long&#8211;indulged vicious habits have made sin their second nature &#59; before
                the forgetfulness of all moral obligation has nearly extinguished all hopes of
                amendment. &#8212; This short explanation I conceived to be necessary&#44; fearing
                lest some persons might take offence or exception against an inadvertently uttered
                thought spoken without viewing previously all the bearings my hearers might give to
                it. I&#44; therefore&#44; now solemnly declare&#44; that any imputation or
                infer&#8211; ence&#44; as though I intended to give offence wilfully to any human
                being&#44; is entirely unfounded&#59; since I would think myself debased&#44; were I
                to use my station as a public teacher&#44; to carry malice towards any one of my
                hearers into the house dedicated to the service of God. Having said&#44;
                accidentally&#44; thus much on the scope of my intended remarks&#44; let us resume
                the subject with which we commenced. It was stated that the fear of temporary loss
                is one of the chief causes&#44; which render men irreligious. It is therefore
                proper&#44; that we trace this fear&#44; and endeavour to show its futility&#44; and
                to prove that&#44; if even it be well founded&#44; there are a thousand other
                considerations which should pre&#8211; <pb n="165"/> THE FEAR OF LOSS. 165 vent us
                from ever allowing it to influence our con&#8211; duct. &#8212; The wavering
                man&#44; or he who has already thrown off the burden of restraint which religion
                must of necessity impose &#8212; since faith merely&#44; with&#8211; out acts&#44;
                is not the religion of the Israelites &#8212; will always require some other than
                mere spiritual ad&#8211; vantages to incite him to practise religious obliga&#8211;
                tions&#44; or in other words&#44; one who is not convinced of the necessity and
                paramount obligation of the law of God will rarely&#44; if ever&#44; appear
                religious unless his worldly advantages are actually&#44; or expected to be&#44;
                augmented thereby. These may consist&#44; in an actual accession of wealth&#44; the
                name of a thorough&#8211;good man&#44; or the fear of public censure. If one
                pretends to piety from the two first motives&#44; he is a hypocrite&#44; since he
                does that for gain or fame which has not a sufficiently strong hold on his
                conviction&#44; to be viewed as a duty&#59; with the last&#8211;mentioned
                motive&#44; however&#44; the fear of censure&#44; a man may not be totally lost to
                all holy sensations&#44; as the fear he entertains of men may preserve him&#44;
                perhaps&#44; from doing any thing absolutely wrong&#44; even in secret&#59; since
                the habit of practising the good publicly may&#44; by degrees&#44; teach him to
                dispense with the evil altogether&#44; and if this should not be entirely so&#44; it
                may be calculated on at least to a considerable extent. Persons of this kind&#44;
                pious from fear&#44; can only be found in communities where the majority are in
                truth and without ostenta&#8211; tion&#44; devoted to the observance of the law&#59;
                for unless one is actually debased at heart&#44; he will readily join in with his
                fellows&#44; although he be not persuaded of the absolute necessity of their
                conduct. The hypo&#8211; crite too&#44; will commonly make his appearance&#44; where
                    <pb n="166"/> 166 THE PEAR OF LOSS. the many are religious&#44; though amongst a
                community of irreligious persons too he may assume the outward show of sanctity&#44;
                the better to conceal his wicked&#8211; ness&#44; till his ends be obtained. &#8212;
                But&#44; generally speak&#8211; ing&#44; if a man not absolutely convinced of the
                truth of revelation is placed where his interest would be better subserved by
                disregarding the divine precepts&#44; we shall find&#44; that he will seek his
                worldly gain as paramount to every other consideration &#59; and the hypocrite&#44;
                as well as the pious from habit merely&#44; will then disregard his former practices
                &#59; and the one from wantonness&#44; the other from apprehension of loss&#44; will
                leave religion unnoticed as something which has no claim to his attention. &#8212;
                To one&#44; who assumes the garb of religion only to forward his plans of
                wickedness&#44; or to promote his interest&#44; but little can be said to awaken his
                mind to a review of his con&#8211; duct&#44; unless we could demonstrate to him&#44;
                that pun&#8211; ishment will&#44; to a certainty and inevitably&#44; follow from
                above as the consequence of sin&#44; even if no human vengeance should ever be
                exerted against his crimes. Yet&#44; this is almost impossible to prove to the

                say&#44; that it was all the effect of chance&#44; and that you were misled by the
                coincidence merely to suppose it the work of a special Providence&#59; mad&#8211;
                man &#33; as though the actual occurrence of these strange coincidences from time to

                &#94;place&#44; let us view the real extent of the apprehended temporal loss&#44; by

                so many days must he spent in idleness&#44; which could he profitably employed&#59;
                and so much capital must be laid out in charity&#44; the Synagogue and the support
                of religion in general&#44; which brings no return what&#8211; ever. But this is
                evidently an empty excuse&#44; since so many who were good Jews from their
                infancy&#59; who never profaned the day of rest&#59; who never suf&#8211; fered the

                be exercised towards the sick and dead &#8212; I say&#44; pious men are not
                necessarily doomed to indi&#8211; gence&#44; since so many of them have risen from
                an humble beginning to immense affluence and distinc&#8211; tion&#33; What then is
                there in all these things to deter us from practising them &#63; Nothing &#8212; but
                our own idle fears&#44; &#8212; nothing but hateful envy at the success of a
                neighbour&#44; which causes us to strain every nerve to become of equal importance

                to the satisfaction of the transgressors themselves&#44; that their wealth is
                actually augmented&#44; or their standing in society raised by their irreligious
                practices&#59; and yet the few examples of transgressors becoming rich or
                respectable are constantly held up as excuses for others to do likewise&#44; as

                I have seen that which must have called up thought in the most thoughtless&#44; had

                moved the heart of the most unfeeling with pity &#59; his foaming mouth&#44; his
                lack&#8211;lustre eyes evidently betokened him a speedy food for worms&#44; and the
                wretched appointments of his couch seemed to say&#44; that his labours for gold had
                been for others&#44; not for himself&#59; and what availed him his riches &#63;
                nothing &#8212; for to alleviate his dreadful sufferings merely&#44; &#8212; to
                smooth for him the descent to death &#8212; was beyond the power of all medical
                skill&#44; and the leveller only of all human distinctions was able to relieve him
                from his misery &#8212; misery of which he himself was unconscious&#44; for the
                latter years of his life had been shrouded in total mental darkness. &#8212; And is

                it would be unwise to check the counsel of cupidity&#44; if this cupidity were

                stands the case&#44; if we take the light of revelation to examine thereby the dark
                intricacies of human life &#63; We are there told&#44; that the soul does not
                die&#44; that the human spirit is a portion breathed into man as a living undying

                placed here by the Deity for no other pur&#8211; pose&#63; did He create us&#44;
                that we should neglect all other pursuits &#63; &#8212; It is true&#44; that a
                moderate share of ambition&#44; a due desire to possess&#44; should be culti&#8211;

                us by our Maker&#44; as one of the best virtues&#59; but as these feelings were
                intended for a holy purpose&#44; we should confine them within the limits of the
                sacred law&#44; and be extremely cautious&#44; that our pursuit of wealth or renown
                should in nowise interfere with the duties which we primarily owe to the Creator. We
                should&#44; therefore&#44; be satisfied with the portion of riches and of honour
                which our honest and religious exertions can procure&#44; and if we cannot in this

                that&#44; as the Psalmist says &#58; &#34; Better is a little for the righteous&#44;
                than the great riches of the many sinners&#33;&#39;&#39; Psalm xxxvii. 16. For man

                And again&#44; it seldom hap&#8211; pens&#44; perhaps never&#44; that good moral and
                religious conduct will deprive a man of his daily bread &#59; and this is enough for
                necessity&#44; more is but superfluous. &#8212; It is no doubt true&#44; that if we
                are rich&#44; we are more able to bestow charity&#44; to relieve the sick&#44; and
                to do other acts of mercy&#59; again&#44; if we are more honoured in the opinion of
                the world&#44; we can assist the op&#8211; pressed with our countenance and support
                better&#44; than otherwise. All this is true &#59; but then we should consider&#44;
                that it must be wrong to commit any sin&#44; any thing bad in the eyes of God to
                attain these objects of virtue&#59; for observe&#44; none of you is bound to give
                the smallest trifle in the way of charity&#44; if he&#44; in order to give it&#44;
                would be compelled to steal it first&#59; thus charity becomes a duty only then&#44;
                when we have something to give&#44; and if we cannot give&#44; our Maker will not
                require it &#59; for if it had been his wish that we should exert ourselves in this
                particular virtue&#44; He would have given us the means&#44; by pros&#8211; pering
                our undertakings during the periods allotted to us by Him for labour. &#8212; If we
                find&#44; therefore&#44; that we cannot become rich and renowned in the ways of
                religion&#44; we should choose to live poor and un&#8211; honoured rather than
                transgress &#59; for we shall then have the consciousness at least of having merited
                the grace of God&#44; and this consciousness&#44; this holy satis&#8211;
                faction&#44; will calm for us the storms of life&#44; and make joyful for us the
                hour of death &#58; and are these not objects worth attaining&#44; more than gold or

                true that no immutable principle of right is encroached upon by irreligion. &#8212;
                Persons&#44; determined to transgress&#44; gen&#8211; erally plead in the first
                instance&#44; that necessity compels them&#44; and in the second&#44; that there is
                no harm in what they do. Now&#44; the cases&#44; where necessity really exists&#44;
                are of very rare occurrence &#59; but when they actually do arise&#44; and only
                then&#44; transgression may be extenuated&#44; but never completely justified.
                As&#44; however&#44; necessity&#44; at least absolute and unavoidable necessity&#44;
                can from its very nature be of but short du&#8211; ration &#40;for it would be

                follows&#44; that if any thing like the transgression&#44; done under the pressure
                of circumstances&#44; be con&#8211; tinued to be done when the pressure is wholly or
                in part removed&#44; it cannot be justified under the same plea&#44; and
                consequently&#44; that which was at first excusable has now become a deed of wanton
                iniquity. Let us state an example &#58; A man journeys in the wilderness with a
                caravan that travels on the Sab&#8211; bath&#59; if he were to remain behind by
                himself&#44; it is but too probable that he would never reach the place of his
                destination&#44; unless by a miracle especially wrought in his favour. This&#44;
                then presents a case of necessity&#44; and the traveller is therefore excused for
                not resting on the respective Sabbaths&#44; whilst he continues hi the wilderness
                with the caravan&#59; but as soon as he returns home&#44; or arrives at an inhabited
                country&#44; he is obliged to rest&#44; the necessity for the violation being no
                longer in existence. At the same time&#44; it must be observed that&#44; although
                the traveller <pb n="176"/> 176 THE FEAR OF LOSS. in the desert is permitted to move
                from his place on the Sabbath&#44; he is nevertheless not allowed to do any kind of
                work&#44; since the necessity does not extend farther than to the particular act of
                removal. &#8212; If then&#44; a man pleads necessity to lull his conscience&#44; let
                him beware&#44; that the imagination be not resorted to&#44; to supply the principal
                features&#59; for otherwise&#44; his sinning will be unqualified and wilful
                transgres&#8211; sion. &#8212; Secondly&#44; as to the other excuse. When blaming
                the conduct of a man who is not strict in ceremonial observances&#44; we are often
                met by the questions &#58; &#34; Do you not call him a good man &#63; does he not
                pay his debts &#63; is he not charitable &#63; is he not&#44; in short&#44; careful
                of observing all those duties which can be called the immutable and eternal
                principles of religion &#63;&#34; You will observe here&#44; brethren&#44; that as
                long as a man is honest and charitable&#44; he is sup&#8211; posed&#44; by the
                general run of people&#44; to have done all that can be demanded of him. It
                remains&#44; therefore&#44; to be inquired &#58; &#34; What constitutes a good man
                &#63; what are the immutable principles of religion&#63;&#34; To these questions we
                answer &#58; that a good man is he&#44; who&#44; in all his doings&#44; looks to the
                law of God for his guide&#44; &#8212; does not offend against either the ceremonial
                or moral ordinances of the same&#44; and acts thus from motives of love and fear of
                God&#44; without ostentation or worldly interest. One&#44; who does not act up to
                this standard&#44; cannot&#44; strictly speaking&#44; be considered in a more
                favourable light&#44; than as having more or less good traits in his character&#59;
                but a good man he is not. &#8212; If now there be no one&#44; who acts altogether
                correctly in the majority of instances&#44; we can with propriety call no one
                good&#44; although it must be main&#8211; <pb n="177"/> THE FEAR OF LOSS. 177
                tained&#44; that men there are&#44; who actually deserve the Dame&#44; as far as
                weak mortals can ever be entitled to it. &#8212; Next&#44; as to what are immutable
                truths &#63; We answ T er&#44; that every law&#44; &#8212; every precept in the
                Bible&#44; is an immutable truth in reference to an Israelite&#44; of which he is
                bound to practise as much as he possibly can. If there were any difference between
                one pre&#8211; cept and the other&#44; it could be from no other reason&#44; than
                that one should have proceeded from a source more eternal and more immutable than
                the other. &#8212; But&#44; what is the fact &#63; Evidently that all the com&#8211;
                mandments have sprung from the same source&#44; in evidence of which I tender you
                the ten commandments. In a preceding discourse I have proved&#44; that human
                wisdom&#44; unaided by the word of God&#44; cannot lay claim to have invented one
                single item of any moral law&#44; but that all the systems which regulate civilized
                society have proceeded from&#44; and are based upon the Decalogue&#44; or&#44; as it
                may be&#44; upon revelation antece&#8211; dent to the period of their promulgation.
                It is&#44; there&#8211; fore&#44; unnecessary to enlarge upon the same argument
                again in this place&#44; and to prove the divine authority of the law. I say&#44;
                therefore&#44; that to establish the sanctity of all the laws&#44; I will offer you
                the ten com&#8211; mandments in evidence. There we see placed side by side &#58;
                &#34;I am the Lord thy God&#44;&#34; with &#34; Thou shaft not murder&#59;&#34;
                &#34;Thou shalt have no other gods before me&#44;&#34; with &#34; Thou shalt not
                commit adultery &#59;&#34; &#34; Thou shalt not bear the name of God in
                vain&#44;&#34; with &#34; Thou shalt not steal&#59;&#34; &#34; Remember the Sabbath
                to keep it holy&#59;&#34; with &#34; Thou Q halt not bear false evidence&#59;&#34;
                &#34;Honour thy father and thy mother&#44;&#34; with &#34; Thou shalt not
                covet.&#34; In this arrangement we must dis&#8211; <pb n="178"/> 178 THE FEAR OF
                LOSS. cover&#44; that the Almighty did not draw the least dis&#8211; tinction
                between one commandment and the other. What then confers authority upon any one of
                us&#44; or even upon us all collectively&#44; to assert&#44; that one re&#8211;
                ligious duty is more necessary than the other&#63; Per&#8211; haps&#44; it may be
                said&#44; that the ordinances recorded on the second table are to be styled more
                immutable than the others&#44; because they relate to measures ne&#8211; cessary to
                preserve the peace of society&#59; but this objection is as little founded in reason
                as the preced&#8211; ing ones. For even admit&#44; that civil laws deserve&#44;
                according to their nature&#44; more regard than mere ceremonial laws&#44; still it
                remains to be shown in what way the former can really have hold upon the public
                mind&#44; if not in connexion with the service&#44; the love and fear of God.
                &#8212; Consider&#44; brethren&#44; what makes us observe any law or regulation
                whatever&#44; which lays some restraint upon our conduct&#44; &#8212; say even the
                laws of etiquette &#8212; evidently&#44; either the fear of pun&#8211; ishment&#44;
                or the expectation of reward. &#8212; Now&#44; if we think&#44; that one principle
                of the law is more binding than the other&#44; it follows&#44; that the infraction
                of the minor principle will not bring on us any evil con&#8211; sequence&#44; or at
                worst&#44; the punishment will be much slighter than for the non&#8211;observance of
                the greater duty. Let this idea once prevail&#44; let us once imagine&#44; that the
                Almighty will look with indifference or complacency upon sin of any kind&#44; and
                the conse&#8211; quence must be&#44; that any excuse whatever will suffice to seduce
                us to sin. Once tell the world&#44; that one sin will be punished&#44; the other
                not&#44; and you make men believe that every act will pass unheeded of <pb n="179"/>

                ment for transgressing&#44; there can be no reward for observing&#44; and you thus
                break down every motive for piety and morality. And suppose now&#44; that a man is
                in a situation&#44; where he is next to sure&#44; that detection is beyond
                probability&#44; and that the gain to be derived from offending against what are
                called the laws of society counterbalances every considera&#8211; tion which the
                fear of accidental discovery can raise within him &#58; what will operate here to
                restrain him from violating these very immutable laws of morality&#63; have you not
                told him&#44; or at least induced him to think&#44; that divine vigilance need not
                be feared &#8212; for if this is to be feared&#44; why should the
                non&#8211;observance of the Sabbath be not equally incurring God&#39;s dis&#8211;
                pleasure as want of honesty &#8212; since both are spoken of in the same Decalogue
                &#63; We must&#44; therefore&#44; con&#8211; clude&#44; relying upon the divine
                origin of the Mosaic code&#44; that the laws of worship&#44; as well as those of
                society&#44; are equally holy&#44; equally binding&#44; and equally beneficial.
                &#8212; If then&#44; we once admit&#44; that the posses&#8211; sion of a competency
                is all that is necessary for man&#44; if we acknowledge&#44; that it is sinful to
                endeavour to acquire riches and honour at the expense of religion &#58; it will
                follow&#44; that it is our duty&#44; and as reasonable beings we are compelled&#44;
                to regard as holy&#44; and to practise all the principles of the Israelitish
                law&#44; if even they should cause us temporal loss and incon&#8211; venience.

                &#33; Amen. <pb n="181"/> THE FESTIVAL OF PURIM. 181 Brethren &#33; If we examine
                the occurrenoes of life&#44; and search into the causes of the events with which our
                experi&#8211; ence has made us familiar&#44; we will often find&#44; that the best
                laid plans were frequently frustrated by small causes&#44; and that&#44; no matter
                how much a man had guarded every avenue of his enterprise&#44; some mis&#8211;
                chance or other yet crept in to mar the entire struc&#8211; ture of his brain. All
                experience therefore proves&#44; that no one is safe against the evils which beset
                hu&#8211; man life&#44; and that&#44; however exalted&#44; every child of Adam is
                liable to the same misfortunes as the hum&#8211; blest and meanest of our species.
                Many a one perhaps consulted the experience of past ages&#44; obtained the
                assistance of the powerful and wise&#44; and employed all the strength and ingenuity
                of his own towering genius &#58; and yet the event disappointed his high ex&#8211;
                pectations&#44; and he was compelled to yield his enter&#8211; prise before he had
                even approached the desired con&#8211; summation. Nothing&#44; consequently&#44; is
                more firmly established by thousands of examples&#44; than the words of Solomon in
                the book of Proverbs &#40;xvi. 33&#41; &#58; &#34; In the lap the lot is thrown&#44;
                but all its decision eometh from the Lord.&#34; And well St is that thus the
                faculties of man are organized b&#42;y God&#44; that thus his sphere of action is
                limited by Superior Power &#59; for if it were permitted to the good to lay plans
                for the improvement of their fellow&#8211;beings&#44; and to execute them with
                uniform good success &#58; the same power to do evil would then VOL. I. 16 <pb

                they would thus triumphantly dp their deeds of mischief&#44; unless a special
                providence of God should interpose at the attempted consummation of any deed of
                wickedness to prevent any evil to acrue therefrom. But as it now is&#44; that man
                cannot calculate with certainty upon the issue of any event&#44; since the whole
                future is alike hidden from all &#58; the good can attempt their works of kindness
                and rely with a well&#8211;founded hope upon the assistance of God&#59; and no man
                need fear too greatly the power of the sinners&#44; seeing that their fate is
                controlled by the same kind Being&#44; who manifest&#8211; ed himself to his adorers
                as the Almighty God&#44; and as the Power from whom all the strength of all
                ex&#8211; isting things is derived. If then man complains of his weakness&#44; it
                behoves him to consider&#44; that his safety&#44; while in this state of
                existence&#44; is mainly ow&#8211; ing to this very weakness &#59; since every one
                of all who surround him&#44; of all who have preceded him&#44; of all who will
                follow him&#44; is&#44; has been&#44; or will be&#44; as much circumscribed in his
                power of evil&#44; as he is&#44; who so bitterly complains of the apparent injustice
                and hard&#8211; ship at finding himself so constantly checked by ob&#8211; stacles
                in his undertakings. And unless human nature were changed&#44; that is to say&#44;
                unless every in&#8211; dividual of the human family could be induced by internal
                impulse to do that only which is good in the eyes of God and man&#44; or in other
                words&#44; unless man would cease to be man &#58; it would in effect be aban&#8211;
                doning the weaker and more unsuspicious to the ca&#8211; price and tyranny of the
                fierce and designing&#44; if the Almighty were to give to man a greater power over
                his own destinies than he now possesses. Who then <pb n="183"/> THE FESTIVAL OF

                other of our organization&#44; that all we know of is ordained in a manner which no
                foresight nor experience of ours could improve &#63; &#34;But why&#44;&#34; asks
                some one&#44; &#34;do we so often see the pious abandoned for a time to the evil

                Why triumphs so often the ungodly&#44; and for so long a period&#44; over the

                doubter&#44; so often asked with the melancholy shake of the head denoting a
                distrust in divine Providence&#44; we can easily find answers&#44; if we only dive a
                little beneath the surface of things&#44; and endeavour to trace the rea&#8211; sons
                for God&#39;s rule on earth&#44; without rashly presum&#8211; ing to discover the
                whole of his impenetrable coun&#8211; sels.&#8211; Let us examine the conduct of
                even the best man&#44; or of the best set of men that ever existed&#44; and we shall
                find that some fault w r as yet theirs&#44; that in some cases they proved
                themselves flesh and blood &#59; for with reverence to the illustrious dead we must
                confess&#44; that Abraham&#44; Jacob and Moses&#44; in some few instances&#44;
                departed from the rule which they themselves acknowledged as the only road to
                salva&#8211; tion for them. This in nowise derogates the least from the proud
                preeminence&#44; by which they stand so much above the rest of mankind&#59; for it
                was conso&#8211; nant w T ith their nature&#44; that they&#44; who had not yet laid
                aside tlie tenements of clay in which their pure souls were bound up&#44; should

                pay the for&#8211; feit of their not being&#44; according to their nature&#44; free
                from a temptation to sin. <pb n="184"/> 184 THE FESTIVAL OF PURIM&#39;. Again&#44;
                since man is constituted a free agent by di&#8211; vine sufferance&#44; and since no
                force is laid on any of his inclinations&#44; save it be through the warning voice
                of revelation&#44; and by paternal chastisement &#58; it is un&#8211; avoidable that
                wicked men should at times arise&#44; ay&#44; even those&#44; whom we&#44; from
                their great dissimilarity to ourselves&#44; are apt to style a disgrace to human
                nature. Then again we must discover&#44; that the very superiority of the good over
                the bad makes the for&#8211; mer obnoxious to the latter. Fow it is this antipathy
                which is often made by God the instrument to act as a punishment to those who fear
                Him&#44; when they give way to their inclinations&#44; and stray in some degree from
                the path of their duty. &#8212; Here then we have the solution to the timid
                inquiries of the wavering. The righteous has sinned&#44; and immediately the wicked
                has the power conferred to harm him for a season &#59; and as long as the latter
                keeps within bounds&#44; and heaps no more evil upon the other than he ought to bear
                for his sins&#44; we cannot arraign divine justice for suffering the temporary
                triumph &#59; but as soon as the sufferings of the good exceed their just
                measure&#44; we have thousands of examples to prove that divine as&#8211; sistance
                is not withheld&#44; that divine vengeance is not stayed&#44; the moment the
                intention of the wicked be&#8211; comes manifest&#44; &#34;to swallow &#40;to use
                the language of Holy Writ&#41; him who is more righteous than he.&#34; And if we ask
                for a striking illustration&#44; we can find one in the occasion of the festival of
                Purim&#44; which we are about to celebrate at this very season. The history of the
                book of Esther is&#44; no doubt&#44; familiar to you all&#59; and we shall therefore
                notice only the principal features thereof&#44; for the sake&#44; merely&#44; of <pb

                circumstances nar&#8211; rated there&#44; and to apply it to prove the correctness
                of our assertion&#44; that the righteous&#44; though suffering&#44; will not be
                entirely abandoned to the machination of the godless. The precise period of the
                history under consideration is not correctly ascertained&#59; but in all
                probability&#44; or at least as some suppose&#44;&#42; it was after the building of
                the second temple&#44; that a king of Per&#8211; sia&#44; whose dominions extended
                from the Ganges to the sources of the Nile&#44; gave a great entertainment to the
                inhabitants of his capital&#44; Susa&#59; during the progress of the feast&#44; as
                he was considerably elated with wine&#44; he ordered that his wife should appear
                before the whole assembled multitude&#44; that all might be delighted with her
                beauty. The proud queen re&#8211; fused to obey the ridiculous command of her
                impe&#8211; rious lord&#44; who&#44; highly incensed&#44; consulted the chiefs of
                the empire concerning the punishment to be in&#8211; flicted on her. Vashti was
                accordingly removed from the royal dignity&#44; to satisfy the king&#39;s
                resentment&#59; but he soon repented of the rash act&#44; and to compen&#8211; sate
                himself for the loss of her&#44; every female of note was gathered unto Susa to be
                submitted to his appro&#8211; val&#44; and at length he found the Jewess Esther the
                most pleasing in his eyes&#44; and she was declared queen instead of Vashti. The
                history of the exalted orphan presents some features for profound meditation &#59;
                and &#42; &#42; The Ahasveros mentioned in the Bible&#44; must have been
                subse&#8211; quent to Cambyses&#44; who was the conqueror of Egypt &#59; for it is
                said &#58; &#34; Ahasveros who reisrned from Hodu to Cush.&#34; Does this not mean

                &#40;no matter what her faults might have been&#41; who gratefully re&#8211;
                collected the kindness of her cousin Mordecai&#44; by whom she had been educated
                after the death of her parents&#44; although now raised to the highest honours which
                could be conferred on her&#59; as we read&#58; &#34;And the command of Mordecai&#44;
                Esther did&#44; just as when she was under his charge.&#34; Mordecai soon after this
                time had an opportunity of being serviceable to the king&#44; by being instrumental
                in discovering the con&#8211; spiracy of two chamberlains against the life of their
                master&#59; for the present no reward was bestowed on the unpretending
                Israelite&#44; who in likelihood was satisfied with having done no more than his
                duty in protecting the government under which he lived &#59; but this act of
                fidelity was entered upon the records of the empire&#44; and it was destined to
                become the cause of salvation to Mordecai and the whole remnant of Israel. It was
                not long after this last event&#44; that the king raised one Hainan&#44; surnamed
                the Agagite&#44; to the office of chief minister of the empire&#44; and com&#8211;
                manded every one of his servants to pay due homage to the favourite by falling down
                in the dust before him. Mordecai&#44; however&#44; refused to pay the servile
                tribute&#44; and having been noticed by the haughty Haman&#44; he w r as denounced
                as a Jew&#44; and as one re&#8211; bellious to the commands of the king. Haman&#44;
                to avenge his insulted dignity&#44; did not think it sufficient to remove the hated
                Jew alone&#44; but also the whole Jewish people&#44; amongst whom Mordecai was&#44;
                proba&#8211; bly&#44; a chief of high standing. But not having&#44; the power to do
                any act of violence without the king&#39;s consent&#44; he endeavoured to obtain
                this by flattering <pb n="187"/> THE FESTIVAL OF PURIM. 187 his cupidity and
                inflaming bis resentment. Yet be&#8211; fore be ventured on this step&#44; be threw
                lots&#44; to dis&#8211; cover&#44; by diving into futurity&#44; which day would be
                the most propitious for the execution of his plans. The choice fell upon the
                thirteenth of the twelfth month &#59; and having thus discovered&#44; as he vainly
                imagined&#44; the most fatal day for the Jewish people&#44; he fancied that he was
                guarded from all disappoint&#8211; ment in the execution of his project&#59;
                since&#44; as he thought&#44; he had ascertained to a surety the will of fate&#44;
                according to the superstitious notions of the heathens&#44; not believing that
                He&#44; who is alone en&#8211; throned in heaven&#44; directs all things&#44; as is
                best con&#8211; sonant with his wisdom. .Hainan having easily ob&#8211; tained the
                concurrence of the king&#44; promulgated a decree in the name of the sovereign&#44;
                that on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month all Jews in all the provinces of the
                empire should be slain and their property confiscated for the use of the state&#44;
                or in other words for the benefit of Haman&#44; to whom the king had granted the
                right of proceeding with the Jews according to his pleasure. Already were the
                enemies of Israel rejoiced&#44; already were the swords unsheathed&#44; and with
                joyous anticipation our adver&#8211; saries looked anxiously for the coming of the
                fatal day. But in vain was their early joy&#44; for it had been otherwise ordained
                by the Father of his people&#44; and the most unexpected help rescued them from the
                im&#8211; minent destruction. Esther had hitherto never re&#8211; vealed her origin
                or her people&#59; she lived securely in the king&#39;s palace&#44; unconscious of
                the danger which threatened the whole race of Jacob. Suddenly the news was brought
                to her&#44; that her beloved kinsman <pb n="188"/> 188 THE FESTIVAL OF PURIM. was at
                the. palace gate in the habiliments of mourn&#8211; ing. She sent to inquire the
                cause&#44; when the dread&#8211; ful decree was transmitted to her by Mordecai&#44;
                who exhorted her to go to the king and supplicate him for the salvation of her
                people. But the arbitrary laws of the Persian empire made it a capital offence for
                any one to approach the king&#39;s presence without having been summoned&#59; and it
                had happened that the queen herself had not been called for the space of thirty
                days. She therefore sent in reply to Mor&#8211; decai a representation of the great
                personal risk she would incur by the hazardous step which he recom&#8211; mended.
                But MordeCai&#44; feeling a perfect confidence in God&#44; could not tolerate this
                expression of fear&#44; even in a woman&#59; he answered therefore in these
                memorable words&#58; &#34;Imagine not in thy mind to es&#8211; cape in the
                king&#39;s palace alone of all the Jews. For if thou remainest silent at this
                time&#44; enlargement and help may arise to the Jews from elsewhere&#44; and
                thy&#8211; self and thy father&#39;s house may perish&#59; and who knoweth&#44; but
                that thou hast reached the royal dignity for this emergency&#63;&#34; The queen
                needed no farther admonition &#59; for the spark of enthusiastic confidence in God
                had been kindled&#44; and she ordered Mordecai to proclaim a fast for all the Jews
                in Susa&#44; in order that they might merit the favour of God by humilia&#8211; ting
                themselves before Him&#44; whom they had always found a sure support in the hour of
                trouble. The third day of the fast had already commenced&#44; but Esther had not yet
                been called&#59; when summoning all the fortitude which a righteous cause must
                inspire&#44; she clothed herself in royal garments&#44; and boldly ad&#8211; vanced
                to the inner court of the palace&#44; where the <pb n="189"/> THE FESTIVAL OF PURIM.
                189 king was seated on his throne. The rising resent&#8211; ment at her holdness was
                soon changed into kindlier feelings&#44; and he held out to her the sceptre which he
                bore in his hand&#44; thus showing her&#44; by the customary sign of grace&#44; that
                her offence had been pardoned. Calculating correctly&#44; that Esther would hardly
                have risked her life&#44; unless she had a weighty request to prefer&#44; he offered
                her half his kingdom&#44; if she wished it&#59; but all she asked was&#44; that the
                king and Haman should partake of a repast in her own apartments. The king and Haman
                did as she had desired &#59; again Ahasveros repeated his magnificent offer&#44; and
                again she merely asked for a repetition of the favour grant&#8211; ed her for the
                coming day. I need not relate to you the eventful occurrences of the following night
                and morning&#59; for you all doubtless know how Haman found himself already humbled
                before the man he so much hated&#44; when he was again summoned to attend the queen.
                Esther now delayed no longer to reveal to the king her people&#44; and in the most
                pathetic man&#8211; ner she begged for her own life and the salvation of her kindred
                race. The king evidently incensed at the daring unknown&#44; who had meditated the
                death of his wife&#44; demanded the name of the wretch&#44; and imagine his surprise
                when answered&#58; &#34;This wicked Haman &#33; &#34; His fate was now sealed&#44;
                and from the banquet he was led to the gibbet&#44; where he expiated with his life
                for the evil intended against the inno&#8211; cent. The decree against the Jews was
                repealed&#59; and the thirteenth day of Adar&#44; on which their ene&#8211; mies had
                hoped to extirpate them&#44; was by the royal authority appointed as a day on which
                they might freely exercise vengeance on those who had medita&#8211; <pb n="190"/>
                190 THE FESTIVAL OF PURIM. tecl their downfal. We may perhaps regret&#44; that the
                Israelites of those days took so bloody a revenge &#59; but we should reflect into
                what misery these enemies had intended to plunge them&#59; how fierce their delight
                had been at the anticipated slaughter&#59; and that more&#8211; over the entire
                remnant of the people of God had been threatened with utter annihilation by those
                very men who afterwards fell beneath the sword of their intended victims. In this
                manner was Israel saved from the evil designs of Hainan&#59; and the festival of
                Purim was instituted to celebrate annually the won&#8211; derful event&#44; and to
                return at the recurrence of this season our thanks to our Deliverer&#44; who always
                came to our assistance&#44; when man rose up against us. But does not the fate of
                Hainan teach us how watchful is the superintendence of God over the affairs of man
                &#8212; and how inefficient are all the cunningly devised plans of the proud and
                wicked to injure those who are too weak to protect themselves from the impending
                dan&#8211; ger &#63; Little did Hainan think&#44; that&#44; when he alone was
                invited to the queen&#39;s table&#44; he went to his death&#59; little did he
                imagine that thfe sons&#44; of whom he boast&#8211; ed&#44; would perish so soon
                after him &#59; little did he be&#8211; lieve&#44; that Mordecai&#44; for whom he
                had erected a scaf&#8211; fold&#44; would become the first officer of the king&#59;
                and yet all this did come to pass&#44; and all Hainan&#39;s art for evil was
                rendered as nought&#44; at the moment of his greatest seeming security. Truly may we
                say&#44; that &#34; the lot is thrown by man&#44; but that to God alone be&#8211;
                longs the decision.&#34; If then&#44; oppressed one&#44; thou art suffering under
                severe affliction&#44; if thou seest thy best plans fail of their intended effect

                the sand against which they dash so furi&#8211; ously&#44; the strength of the
                unrighteous is exhausted by the humble resistance which the moral force of the mind
                of the lowly good opposes to the fierce on&#8211; set&#59; for this is the immovable
                and wise decree of God. Cease therefore thy complaining&#44; son of the earth&#44;

                a distance from our own inheritance&#59; why do the nations triumph over the chosen
                people &#59; why have the shearers so often despoiled the lonely sheep &#63; we must

                suf&#8211; fering will and must teach us to place that confidence in God&#44; as our
                sole Protector and Saviour&#44; which we failed to do when we were in our own land
                &#59; for we have since our dispersion been taught that our Father yet lives&#44;
                although we have been banished from his favourite abo&#42;de. AVe cannot despair of

                Note. &#8212; Against the several historical sketches scattered through my
                discourses it may perhaps be alleged&#44; that it was useless to tell the people
                what they can find better told in the Bible. In answer to this I would merely
                observe&#44; that these discourses are intended for the young as well as the
                old&#44; for the ignorant no less than the well informed &#59; and I thought
                that&#44; by presenting the chief points connected with the fasts&#44; festivals and

                information&#44; which&#44; though obvious&#44; might otherwise not be accessible to

                worldly matters&#44; our object will be to obtain some positive good&#44; or to ward
                off some definite evil &#59; for no matter how much this reason may be concealed by
                others&#44; which we ourselves may perhaps imagine to be the real causes&#58; still
                the desire for some absolute advantage is&#44; I may freely say always&#44; the
                chief motive which prompts our action. Thus we see the merchant crossing the stormy
                ocean for the sake of augmenting his wealth &#59; the philosopher pursuing his
                studies to perfect his discoveries &#59; the warrior braving all peril in search of
                glory &#58; &#8212; and on the other hand we see a man sub&#8211; mitting himself to
                the knife of the surgeon to be cured of a disease &#59; and the weak overstraining
                his exhausted strength to escape from impending dan&#8211; ger. It is in truth the
                principle of self&#8211;love&#44; im&#8211; planted in us for the wisest of
                purposes&#44; which is ever active to impel us to reach whatever is agree&#8211;
                able to our mind&#59; and if it is exercised under proper limitations&#44; it must
                be the means of making us as good and useful as we were intended to be by the

                be such men as will be bene&#8211; factors and guides to our species. &#8212;
                Self&#8211;love is in this respect then essentially different from selfish&#8211;
                ness&#59; since the first looks towards gratifying the mind as well as the body&#44;
                the latter only towards yielding to the brutal desires and feelings inherent to man.
                If&#44; therefore&#44; we find a man always striv&#8211; ing to gratify himself
                only&#44; even at the expense of the rights aud feelings of others &#58; we may
                freely pro&#8211; nounce him one with whom the candid and upright will avoid all
                intercourse and connection&#44; since self is to him the greatest and dearest object
                in the world. But if a man respects the same rights in others&#44; which he wishes
                to enjoy for himself&#44; if he looks around to gratify the finer feelings of
                humanity&#44; which proceed from a tender sensibility and a sympathy for the wants
                and sufferings of others &#58; we then say&#44; that he is one that loves his
                species&#44; and the refined love he bears to himself&#44; impels him to make others
                around him happy&#44;&#42; at the expense even of personal incon&#8211; venience.
                According to this exposition&#44; a selfish man can never do good&#44; since he only
                lives for him&#8211; self&#59; and a man of sensibility only can act up to the
                duties required of him&#44; inasmuch as he loves those also&#44; who like him were

                promulgate for the benefit of all&#44; and the safety of every individual. The
                indulgence of the passions&#44; the rioting in debaucheries&#44; the imbruing of
                hands in human blood&#44; are the characteristics of the former&#59; active

                Yet&#44; as our ideas are from the moment of our birth continually and irresistibly
                drawn to the gratification of our bodily wants &#58; it is very natural&#44; nay
                unavoidable&#44; that we should strive to obtain the positive worldly good and to
                avoid absolute bodily evil. Thus&#44; we should unhesitatingly call any one a
                madman&#44; who would try to persuade us&#44; that it would be conducive to our
                comfort&#44; to remain the whole day immersed up to the chin in water&#44; or that
                the flesh of carrion could furnish us with delicious food &#59; for our
                experi&#8211; ence&#44; our taste&#44; or our feeling&#44; would demonstrate the
                fallacy of such notions&#44; and the aberration from our usually entertained
                opinions of the physical re&#8211; former would strike as an evidence of his being
                of unsound mind. In this way we are taught by taste and experience to satisfy the
                cravings of nature&#44; in a manner the most agreeable to our disposition and
                organization.&#39; The food&#44; therefore&#44; which every hu&#8211; man being is
                obliged to take to preserve his existence&#44; is various according to the tastes

                strength is concerned&#44; according to his ability of enduring fatigues and
                deprivations. Likewise&#44; feeling and experience will soon teach&#44; that to
                plunge a finger into the fire will cause pain &#59; and&#44; undoubtedly&#44; if a
                savage should accidentally have scalded himself from an utter ignorance of the
                effects of boiling water upon the skin&#44; he will be more circumspect with its use
                for the future &#59; since experience has now taught him to dread the unplea&#8211;
                sant and painful result. It is needless to exemplify so obvious a proposition at
                greater length&#44; and it was only touched upon to show in the sequel its
                application to moral actions. &#8212; To proceed &#58; whatever pursuits we engage
                in&#44; we must have an especial and specific object in view&#44; though even to
                ourselves this object may not be so defined&#44; as to enable us to ex&#8211; plain
                our sensation to others. &#8212; If we enter into mer&#8211; cantile
                speculations&#44; our object is&#44; to a certainty&#44; gain in the first
                instance&#44; be this for our own benefit or that of others. &#8212; The man of
                learning would&#44; in all probability&#44; forsake his studies&#44; if he were
                convinced&#44; that the end of all his endeavours would be an igno&#8211; minious
                death&#44; after a life spent in the most dread&#8211; ful privations&#44; and that
                his name should be buried in total oblivion. &#8212; The soldier would certainly
                never strive to signalize himself&#44; if he had not some hopes that his name would
                be honourably mentioned in the records of history. The evident objects which these
                and many others have in view are self&#8211;aggrandize&#8211; ment and notoriety
                &#59; and even if these are not the sole springs of action&#44; they are&#44;

                more you approached the wished&#8211;for consummation. It seems&#44; that the almost
                expiring power receives a new 7 access&#44; as the end comes into view&#44; and this
                enables us to overcome difficulties once considered as insurmount&#8211; able.
                &#8212; And since the advantages of riches are appar&#8211; ent&#44; and the

                height of human power. &#34;Nay&#44; crimes are pardoned to a successful sinner
                &#59; and what in an humble transgressor is called treason or murder&#44; is styled
                patriotism and heroic greatness&#44; if success has crowned the efforts of the wily
                dema&#8211; gogue. We&#44; therefore&#44; need not manifest any aston&#8211;

                for them &#8212; may well suit the proud and arro&#8211; gant&#44; those who rely on
                their own strength&#44; who seem to build their habitations amidst the stars&#59;
                but never could it be consonant with divine good&#8211; ness&#44; never could this

                and acquire greatness was life dispensed to so many millions of intelligent
                creatures &#59; but for the end of leading them on to greater happiness&#44; to the
                perma&#8211; nent and unfading bliss&#44; which was for ever destined to be the
                reward of virtue. Here is a theme to dwell on with delight&#44; this is an idea from

                conceded &#8212; if he is a real friend to his species&#44; will ever inculcate&#44;
                that a man should not seek the means of an honest com&#8211; petency&#59; no
                one&#44; who lays a just value upon the true glory of an honourable and revered
                name&#44; can&#44; consistently with religion&#44; teach that it would be safe to
                disregard public opinion&#44; and to make one&#8211; self ridiculous by eccentricity
                or an overbearing con&#8211; tempt of&#44; and supercilious demeanour towards&#44;
                others. No&#44; religion asks not self&#8211;denial of this kind&#44; for all the
                books of Scripture praise highly the possession of a good name&#44; and recommend
                industry and perse&#8211; verance &#59; nay more&#44; wealth and fame are considered
                and held up to view as blessings to be desired&#44; but always to be sought under
                the limitations of God&#39;s holy&#44; everlasting&#44; and unchangeable law. Thus
                it is certainly true&#44; that the benefits arising from the ob&#8211; servance of

                powerful&#44; of which the foolish can partake&#44; though of necessity in a
                somewhat more limited sphere&#44; as well as the wisest. And enter once the humble
                dwelling of the lowly pious&#44; and though wealth may be absent&#44; though no
                splendour sur&#8211; rounds him&#44; though the toil by which he lives must be daily
                renewed&#44; though his name is unknown be&#8211; yond his own neighbourhood&#58; be
                assured&#44; neverthe&#8211; less&#44; that he bears that within him&#44; which is
                to be prized beyond all wealth&#44; beyond all glitter valuable. Watch him as he
                steps over his threshold after a day of labour&#44; behold his good housewife
                approaching him with their infant on her arm&#44; see another child clinging around
                his knee in childish ecstacy&#59; and now observe his eyes turned upwards with
                tearful but glad adoration to Heaven for the truly happy lot which is his by the
                blessing of the Supreme&#58; and then say&#44; what&#44; compared to such a
                state&#44; is all the pomp of wealth and power&#44; where envy and hatred often
                assume the mask of love and friendship&#44; to be&#8211; guile the miserable remnant
                of mortality of his anger&#44; that he may not bestow on others the estate&#44;
                which they&#44; his heirs&#44; expect to come in possession of at his decease.
                &#8212; Xow grant&#44; therefore&#44; for argument&#39;s sake&#44; that the
                pleasures and blessings of wealth and power <pb n="203"/> REWARD AND PUNISHMENT. 203
                are visible and tangible to a much greater degree than those of piety &#58; it
                behoves us&#44; nevertheless&#44; to throw in the opposite scale the anxiety and
                vexation incident to worldly greatness&#44; and that to piety there are joined
                blessings and pleasures which the former can never impart. &#8212; Thus much may be
                said&#44; even without adverting to the outwardly unseen and un&#8211; felt
                promises&#44; which Scriptures record to the advan&#8211; tage of the good&#59;
                since if life were even to terminate with our death&#44; there is yet sufficient
                reason for pre&#8211; ferring piety and the observance of religious duties to any
                other pursuit&#44; because of the satisfaction and the sublime tranquillity of the
                mind which accompany them. But there are happier&#44; higher&#44; and more en&#8211;
                during fruits of goodness&#44; which sooner or later will become the portion of the
                worshippers of God &#8212; and let others triumph in their wickedness&#44; let the
                good ever so often bow before the powerful sinner &#8212; there is a period&#44; and
                come it will&#44; when the film will be withdrawn from the sight of the wilfully
                blind&#44; when their infatuation will vanish&#44; but when&#44; alas &#33; it will
                be too late to remedy the evil which has been once and irretrievably committed &#33;
                &#8212; Yes&#44; brethren&#44; it was even in the time of the prophets&#44; that
                there lived many who pointed to the prosperity of the sinners&#44; as an
                evidence&#44; that man might tempt God&#44; and yet escape unscathed&#44; and that
                consequently it would appear&#44; that >i person would do well to hold with a firm
                grasp what he once possesses&#44; and that it were unwise to spend any thing in
                charity and other reli&#8211; gious purposes. To rebut&#39; these objections of
                cupi&#8211; dity and weakness of faith in the justice of God&#44; Malachi&#44; the
                last of those illustrious men&#44; by whose <pb n="204"/> 204 REWARD AND PUNISHMENT.
                mouth the Lord thought proper to instruct the world&#44; spoke as follows &#58;
                &#34; Your words have been strong against me&#44; saith the Lord&#44; and you
                said&#44; What have we been speaking against thee&#63; You said&#44; It is needless
                to serve God&#44; and what did we gain&#44; when we observed his statutes&#44; and
                walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts &#63; And now we call the presumptuous
                happy &#59; &#39;ea&#44; even they that practise wickedness are built up&#44; yea
                they have even tempted the Lord and have escaped. Then they that feared the Lord
                spoke to one another &#59; and the Lord hearkened and heard it&#44; and it was
                written before Him in the book of remembrance&#44; for those who fear the Lord and
                rever&#8211; ence his name.&#34; Malachi iii. And then continues the prophet&#58;
                &#34;And they shall be mine&#44; on that day&#44; which I have set apart for
                judgment&#44; saith the Lord of hosts&#44; and I will spare them as a man spareth
                his son that serveth him. And you shall return&#44; and see the difference between
                the righteous and the wicked&#44; between him that serveth God and him who hath not
                served him.&#34; Ibid. 17&#8211;18. Here are the objections of the timid stated&#59;
                they see not the use of serving God &#59; no private interest&#42; is subserved by
                religion&#44; no notoriety is gained by hu&#8211; mility&#59; they point with
                trembling apprehension to the proud wealthy sinners&#44; who&#44; so to say&#44;
                brave the anger of the Lord with impunity &#59; they next imagine that wickedness
                will not meet with disfavour&#44; they hesitate and ask&#44; if it were true that
                punishment is the consequence of sin&#44; why does it not follow instanta&#8211; <pb
                    n="205"/> REWAUD AND PUNISHMENT. 205 neously and on all occasions &#63; But they
                observe not&#44; they regard not&#44; that&#44; if punishment were at all times to
                ensue immediately&#44; a true and disinterested rever&#8211; ence of God and
                confidence in his providence and justice could not possibly take root in the human
                breast. Consider&#44; brethren&#44; that&#44; if for instance a violation of the
                Sabbath should be followed by the sudden death of the transgressor&#44; it would not
                be the least meritorious in us to abstain from infringing the law&#44; seeing that
                we should be destroyed if we diso&#8211; beyed&#59; and consequently&#44; not
                obedience to God&#44; but interest&#44; worldly and palpable interest&#44; the fear
                of bodily harm&#44; would deter us. Suppose&#44; too&#44; that reward should always
                be the fruit of piety in some tangible shape or other &#58; to be pious&#44;
                then&#44; would only be to hold out an inducement to God to pay us for our work&#44;
                just as the day&#8211;labourer expects to obtain his pay from his master when his
                allotted task is done. Piety would thus be reduced to a mere barter on the one
                hand&#44; and a remedy on the other. But this never was&#44; never could have been
                the intention of God in making man a free agent&#44; by which he was designed to
                choose from conviction and inclination&#44; not to be bribed and frightened. And
                though to serve God from motives of fear and even of interest be a virtue too&#44;
                yet the greatest moral perfection attainable is to serve Him from pure feelings of
                adoration&#44; to be im&#8211; pelled solely &#94;by an admiration of his
                greatness&#44; wis&#8211; dom&#44; and beneficence&#44; which are so abundantly
                dis&#8211; played in all his works&#59; since from yon splendid orb&#44; that serves
                us as a light by day&#44; down to the motes that dance in his rays&#44; and the
                minute insect unob&#8211; servable by the naked eye&#44; all is one chain of

                perfection. This is true piety&#44; true ador&#8211; ation of God&#59; here no
                meanness mixes itself with our holier sensations &#59; here no avarice chokes up the
                fountain of sincere henevolence&#59; here no ambition for worldly greatness crowds
                out the noble offsprings of religious obedience&#59; for then&#44; even whilst not
                unmindful of our preservation&#44; whilst labouring in the sphere assigned us by an
                All&#8211; wise Providence&#44; we shall be willing to love God above all&#44; and
                our neighbour like ourselves. In fine&#44; unless you con&#8211; vince
                yourselves&#44; that nothing but ultimate injury can result from purely worldly
                pursuits&#44; that at the best no splendour here enjoyed can in the least avail
                you&#44; that no earthly greatness can atone for duties neglected&#44; for misdeeds
                committed&#44; and time mis&#8211; spent &#58; you must remain on the lowest degree
                of ex&#8211; cellence&#44; for you lack that which is the truly valuable&#44; the
                only thing by which you can demonstrate&#44; that your life has not passed away like
                the vision of a night&#44; of wdiich nothing is recollected when the eye&#8211; lids
                are freed from the bonds of mortal slumber. &#8212; And&#44; disguise it as you
                will&#44; imagine a thousand necessities&#44; urge innumerable excuses&#44; nothing
                holy will be found at the root of your worldly pursuits&#59; for
                self&#8211;aggrandizement alone prompts you to these exertions &#59; since you only
                desire wealth in order to become rich &#59; you seek wisdom to appear wise before
                the world&#44; and if you look for advancement&#44; it is that your power may be
                felt. In all this there is nothing&#44; either in the motive or the result&#44;
                which can plead for you on the day of trial &#59; for in none of your do&#8211; ings
                of this nature can the glory of God&#44; the well&#8211; being of mankind&#44; and
                your own immortal happiness <pb n="207"/> REWARD AND PUNISHMENT. 207 be the end in
                view. But if you submit cheerfully&#44; not patiently merely&#44; to the will of
                God&#44; if you ad&#8211; vance step by step to the perfection&#44; which the
                ador&#8211; ers of the Lord enjoy&#58; you need not tremble for the coming day&#44;
                for you will then be treasured up as the &#34; son who serveth his father.&#34; And
                will not a state of endless bliss be compensation sufficient for all your
                exertions&#63; and will not the coming felicity &#8212; future it is true&#44; but
                still certain &#8212; be reward enough for all the little good you can

                of suffering you to wait so long&#44; when you ought to reflect&#44; how very
                confined your ideas are of eternity &#63; Perhaps you fear&#44; that the promised
                reward may never come &#63; Then know&#44; that God it is&#44; who prom&#8211; ised
                it through the mouth of his faithful servants&#44; and that none of his words ever
                falls to the ground without fulfilling its object&#33; And you can doubt Him &#63;

                been accomplished &#63; And who more than your nation has experienced this so often
                and so remarkably &#63; Reflect that your peo&#8211; ple owes its origin to the

                ancestors were redeemed by a mighty hand from oppression and thraldom. &#8212; The

                with Jacob&#59; Moses Avas sent as God&#39;s messenger to Pharaoh&#44; to claim the
                dismissal of the oppressed Hebrews from the mighty king of Egypt&#44; who
                inso&#8211; lently declared&#44; that he knew not the Eternal&#44; and would not
                suffer Israel to gQ &#59; &#8212; but he was at length glad to let our people march
                out unto freedom&#44; when his pride had been humbled&#44; and when he had felt&#44;
                that it is in vain to oppose the counsels of the Most High&#44; and that no station
                will shield a man against the arrows of his punishment. This is the history of our
                people&#44; as the book of Exodus tells it&#44; and it has been verified and proved
                by the researches of the wise and curious&#59; but it needs no other evidence than
                Holy Writ to convince Jews of the truth of sacred history &#59; I speak to
                believers&#44; and farther demonstra&#8211; tion is therefore useless. &#8212; Here
                then is evidence that the word of God is immutable&#44; unchangeable&#44; and its
                effect certain &#59; we can accordingly not doubt the promises of Him&#44; who has
                never deceived&#44; though their fulfilment has as yet not been accomplished&#44;
                though their effect is hidden from our sight&#44; and their working is beyond our
                comprehension. And notwith&#8211; standing the weakness of our reason&#44; we are
                not left in uncertainty concerning the different issues of vice and virtue&#44; for
                God himself has informed us of them &#59; and if the punishment of sin and the
                reward of piety&#94; should even not be displayed in this state of limited existence
                &#58; we may rest assured that both will be proved to a certainty on that awful day
                of judgment&#44; when it will be seen by all what difference there is between the
                righteous and the wicked&#44; and when God will show how miserable he must be

                sufficient to teach us to a certainty the event before we commence working &#58; it
                would be quite unnecessary to lay down rules and directions for our government&#59;
                for even the smallest child then would always choose the most beneficial&#44;
                provided its intellect were not disordered. &#8212; But how does the&#39; case stand
                now&#44; in the manner human knowledge is organized &#63; who knows to&#8211;day
                what is to happen on the morrow&#63; True it is&#44; that men of learning can tell
                beforehand&#44; when certain appear&#8211; ances in the heavens will take place&#44;

                of heaven will be darkened&#59; but this is only knowing by observation&#44; how the
                Creator has organized his handiwork &#8212; nature&#59; this is but confessing&#44;
                in other words&#44; the omnipotent power of the Ruler of all&#44; whose works are
                perfect&#44; and respond ever to the in&#8211; tended effect. But of the ultimate
                result of our own actions&#44; of the final issue of the deeds wrought in our
                present existence&#44; even the wisest of us is ignorant. It was the will of
                God&#44; that man&#39;s reason should not reach beyond a certain extent&#44; that
                human research should be bounded by the limits of reality &#8212; the past and the
                present&#59; though even in this space his mind often wanders in racking uncertainty
                and perplexing doubt&#44; for the want of knowledge of details &#59; but into
                futurity &#8212; no man can dive of his own free will&#44; nay&#44; he cannot in the
                least degree lift the vail which hides the surface of coming things&#59; and thus he
                is left to rely upon the Author of his being for the issue of his endeavours&#44;
                and&#44; willing or unwilling&#44; he is unable to place himself one step beyond the

                takest away their spirit&#44; they perish&#44; and to their dust they return.&#34;

                mortals&#44; subject perpetually to be compelled to resign our spirit into the hands
                of the Giver thereof&#44; we ought to rely for protection where alone it can be
                found&#44; and seek for knowledge at the Fountain of unerring wisdom. If now a man
                should ask&#58; &#34; Why has God left us so powerless&#44; and has hidden from us
                so entirely all knowledge of futurity&#63;&#34; we answer&#44; that this was wisely
                ordained&#44; in order that no one should rely upon his own wisdom&#44; and trust to
                his own strength&#59; but that&#44; discovering his weakness and insufficiency&#44;
                he might learn to pay due deference to his Creator&#44; and subject to his service
                the entire energy of his mind and body. And as&#44; at the same time&#44; we are
                ignorant of the actual effects which our conduct&#44; when based upon our own
                reasoning&#44; will have &#58; it follows as a matter of necessity&#44; that it is
                our duty to ascertain&#44; if possible&#44; what line of action will be beneficial
                to our&#8211; selves and others&#44; and what will be injurious in its tendency. It
                must be apparent&#44; upon slight reflection&#44; that if we follow our own
                inclinations&#44; or in othei words&#44; if we surrender ourselves to the guidance
                of the passions&#44; we must often do that&#44; the effects of which will be
                injurious&#59; since if it were otherwise&#44; every act of man would be beneficial
                in its tendency. <pb n="212"/> 212 THE SANCTIPICATION OF THE LORD&#44; For&#44; if
                we were permitted to do whatever suits our fancy&#44; it would be requisite&#44; in
                order to constitute our conduct purely good&#44; that nothing but good should result
                therefrom. But suppose it would suit our fancy to plunder our neighbour&#39;s
                house&#44; to possess ourselves of his property&#58; would this be right and
                beneficial &#63; yet our neighbour says&#44; he suffers wrong from those whom he
                never injured &#59; and consequently there can be no unmixed good&#44; where&#44;
                although the passions of the perpetrator are satisfied to their fullest extent&#44;
                another one is undeservedly injured in his person or property. &#8212; Some one&#44;
                however&#44; may assert&#44; that pas&#8211; sion without the guidance of reason
                will be destruc&#8211; tive&#44; but that reason superadded will be enough to point
                out a proper course. &#8212; But here again we must come to the startling
                admission&#44; that every human being has a share of reason assigned to him&#44; and

                suggestions of reason&#44; if no other check be admitted by us. It would thus appear
                that&#44; since every person would have a right to claim for himself the liberty of

                confess&#44; that without a respect for religious enactments no true virtue can
                exist&#59; and how can happiness be imagined&#44; where virtue has not laid the
                foundation &#63; &#8212; True&#44; that virtue may not be always re&#8211; warded
                with outward bliss&#59; but who can estimate the bliss within&#44; the unfading
                serenity which accompanies the righteous&#44; even unto death&#63; &#8212; &#94;No
                farther argument need be adduced to prove the necessity of the law pro&#8211;
                mulgated by God&#44; and the good effects resulting there&#8211; from&#59; since
                every reasonable being can easily discern the difference between acts arising from a
                feeling of devotion and confidence in the Lord &#8212; and those springing from
                motives of self&#8211; gratification merely&#44; even assuming that such a principle
                could teach what is good and useful. &#34; But how is religion to be observed &#63;
                what are the demands of revealed faith &#63;&#34; These questions&#44; though
                frequently put in a manner as though they could not be easily solved&#44; can be
                answered by a simple refer&#8211; ence to the records of revelation&#44; the holy
                Scriptures&#44; for there are recorded the commandments which God instituted as the
                enactments of his will &#59; and every man&#44; therefore&#44; is bound to do
                thereof&#44; whatever may be in his power of effecting&#59; and no excuse whatever
                will justify him for neglecting any practicable duty&#44; which he is certified to
                be the will of his Creator. &#8212; Although This deduction is so perfectly
                reasonable&#44; permit me to present to you some few observations&#44; in order to
                illustrate the subject a little more at length &#59; since it is one which merits
                and ought to re&#8211; ceive the serious reflection of every Israelite&#44; &#8212;
                In a <pb n="216"/> 216 THE SANCTIFICATION OP THE LORD. former lecture on this
                subject&#44; it has been shown&#44; that unless a man is willing to make sacrifices
                of all personal considerations in the cause of piety&#44; he can&#8211; not be said
                to be fired with true ardour for the holy cause. Now&#44; as also partly said&#44;
                these sacrifices to principle do not consist in an entire abstinence from all
                pleasures&#44; and in a seclusion from social inter&#8211; course&#59; for this
                never was the intention or scope of our law&#44; which recommends sociality and
                pleasure&#44; when enjoyed in moderation. But the sacrifices which we are bound to
                make to the will of God&#44; con&#8211; sist simply in an entire disregard of all
                consequences&#44; be they good or bad&#44; that may possibly follow upon our doing
                those acts&#44; which are prescribed by religion. From this definition you will
                clearly observe&#44; that a mere profession&#44; nay&#44; even a sincere profession
                of faith&#44; is not all that is demanded&#44; since principles&#44; which prove
                themselves by words only&#44; are mere out&#8211; ward show&#44; in which there is
                nothing capable of con&#8211; ferring lasting benefits &#59; but acts&#44; the most
                trifling even&#44; produce an impression somewhere&#44; and by so much as they are
                worth&#44; they always tend to augment the general mass of good. &#8212; Some
                one&#44; however&#44; may ask &#58; &#34; Why do we regard the ceremonial parts of
                religion with so much reverence&#44; and what can be the good resulting from their
                careful observance&#63;&#34; &#8212; Questions of this nature are frequently
                asked&#44; and even by persons pretending to piety&#59; and in this way neglect of
                outward acts of worship is excused by many&#44; if the offender holds but fast to
                the so&#8211;called moral laws. &#8212; In answer&#44; we have to observe&#44; that
                no Jew will contend&#44; that honesty&#44; integrity&#44; and neigh&#8211; bourly
                kindness&#44; are not virtues highly commendable&#44; <pb n="217"/> THE

                possessor deserves the blessing of Heaven &#59; but then we also assert&#44; that
                acts of worship&#44; the ceremonies proper&#44; are necessary&#44; praiseworthy and
                useful in their ten&#8211; dency. For the following reasons&#58; first&#44; any act
                of worship proceeding from a pure motive&#44; and obeyed because it is an emanation
                from the will of God&#44; must produce&#44; the oftener it is repeated&#44; an
                acquiescence in the dictates of the Lord&#44; and it is a habit of this kind that is
                at last the true essence of piety and de&#8211; votion. Secondly&#44; to do those
                acts&#44; acknowledgedly great and useful&#44; such as charity&#44; justice&#44; and
                preser&#8211; vation of human life&#44; is in a measure necessary to our nature&#44;
                and we indulge in their exercise perhaps from motives of interest&#44; since we may
                one day stand in need ourselves of the same deeds of kindness&#44; which we now show
                to others. It will thus be evident&#44; that in the execution of social virtues&#44;
                as we will term the acts commonly called the moral law&#44; the pure devo&#8211;
                tion towards God may have but little share in prompt&#8211; ing them &#59; but in
                acts of worship&#44; where we alone are the actors&#44; and God the sole witness
                perhaps of our conduct&#44; true worship can be most signally proved. For in no
                situation of this life can a heartfelt prayer be recompensed by the prayer of any
                other son of man&#44; no matter how virtuous he may be&#59; patience under suffering
                and resignation to divine dispensa&#8211; tions cannot fre repaid by equal deeds in
                others &#59; and therefore we must contend&#44; that in these and many other similar
                acts&#44; the love of God&#44; in its proper sense&#44; is more pointedly exhibited
                than in any other way. It need not be repeated again in this place&#44; that mere

                proper duties of man are not fulfilled&#44; unless he observes the whole enactments
                of God&#44; which are declared to he his will&#44; and contained in intelligible
                terms in the hooks of Moses. &#8212; We will admit&#44; that there are de&#8211;
                votees who act&#44; as though there were no human be&#8211; ing toward whom any
                duties are to be fulfilled&#59; for their mind is&#44; as it were&#44; wrapt up
                within themselves &#8212; in God they see only a watchful&#44; jealous&#44;

                their time should be spent in devo&#8211; tional exercises. We will admit&#44; I
                say&#44; that there are such devotees&#44; and also&#44; that they are mistaken in
                their conceptions of God&#59; for He is a just&#44; not an unmerciful&#44;
                judge&#59; He&#44; indeed&#44; searches the heart&#44; knows whether it is true in
                his service&#44; but He wishes not that we should cease to be men&#44; as soon as we
                enter on his worship &#59; not this is the economy which his wisdom established&#44;
                when He assigned labour to man during his sojourn on earth&#59; and they&#44;
                there&#8211; fore&#44; who regard the Merciful One in the light of an arbitrary
                ruler&#44; have quite misunderstood his will&#59; and consequently we should
                endeavour to prevent such erroneous ideas from taking root among us. But in
                admitting this much against what may be termed the excesses of piety&#44; we have
                admitted all that can reasonably be claimed as an objection to de&#8211;

                more than the fact Avhich we are daily compelled to witness &#63; And these scoffers
                are they&#44; who wish to arrogate to themselves the title of philanthropists&#44;
                as though the religious were enemies to mankind&#44; and desirous of keeping the
                multitude groping in darkness. And even when finding that all subterfuges have
                failed&#44; and when they are unable any longer to contend against the overwhelming
                force of conviction&#44; that the books of Moses contain the undoubted revelation of
                the God of nature &#58; they endeavour to excuse their unnatural unbelief bv Savin

                but that they have ceased to be binding upon the present genera&#8211; tion. &#8212;
                But is it possible&#44; that any one laying claim to reason can be so blinded by
                ignorance and prejudice&#44; as to maintain such gross absurdities &#63; Where can

                if the Pentateuch is no longer in force &#63; Where will you seek for the guide of
                life&#44; if you do not find it there &#63; Perhaps you may say&#44; that reason
                shall guide us&#44; that from experience we will gather wisdom. &#8212; But where
                are those monu&#8211; ments of human reason&#44; which have been as lasting as the
                monuments of revelation &#63; Where are the wise laws drawn from experience&#63; Do
                we not rather find&#44; that no human being can establish a single prin&#8211;
                ciple&#44; which is not liable to be rescinded the follow&#8211; ing day &#63; And
                from experience you will derive in&#8211; struction &#33; when it is evident&#44; by
                the evidence of this very instructor you so much extol&#44; that no man was ever
                prevented from following another upon the path of ruin&#44; if no other opinions and
                principles save those derived from reason and experience prevented him &#63; These
                facts&#44; I believe to be so self&#8211;evident&#44; and so well fortified by what
                we see every day&#44; that it would be but fatiguing you&#44; brethren&#44; to say
                any more in refu&#8211; tation of such fallacious arguments. But there is another
                point&#44; involved in this mode of pushing the obligation of the word of God from
                our shoulders&#44; to which I have to draw your attention. If the arguments we have
                before this adduced in favour of the necessity of a divine revelation be well
                founded in reason&#44; and if we have succeeded in proving that the law of
                Moses&#44; so called&#44; is the record thereof&#58; we must come to the
                conclusion&#44; that the words and com&#8211; mandments contained in the Pentateuch
                are in truth the manifestation of the will of God&#44; by which He intended to
                enlighten mankind with regard to their duties&#44; which &#40;in the words of the
                law itself&#41; &#34; they were to do and live through them&#59;&#34; and then&#44;
                know&#8211; <pb n="221"/> THE SANCTIEICATION OF THE LORD. 221 ing&#44; as we do&#44;
                how wise and unwavering God is in all his doings&#44; it is but reasonable to
                suppose that the enactments of his will&#44; as manifested to Moses&#44; are even to
                this hour considered by Him in the same light of usefulness and necessity&#44; as at
                the period when first He announced them. &#8212; For if we survey all that immense
                structure of nature&#44; the creation&#44; of which we form a part&#58; we must
                discover&#44; that in every particle&#44; wisdom the most unsearchable&#44; order
                the most unwavering&#44; are manifested. The sun rises in the same manner now&#44;
                as he did from the first moment of his installation as the light by day&#59; planets
                upon planets move in their spheres with the utmost regularity without derangement or
                interruption&#59; and descending to this humble&#44; beautiful&#44; earth of
                ours&#44; we see spring&#44; and summer&#44; and autumn&#44; and winter&#44; change
                in a constant circle&#44; with the utmost regularity and precision. Thus has God
                organized all of which we can form a conception by our organs and senses. And if
                next we turn our view inward&#44; and observe of what the living principle within us
                is made&#44; and if we search in the experience of others&#44; and in the records of
                past ages&#44; which have been brought down to our times &#58; we will again be
                struck with the regu&#8211; larity observable in the formation of the many sons of
                Adam&#44; every where to be discovered. All this proves&#44; how permanent God&#39;s
                counsels are&#44; how fixed his resolutions&#44; how unalterable his judgments &#33;
                How then shall the impious dare to say&#44; even whilst pro&#8211; fessing
                veneration to the Great Being&#44; that his law&#44; which He declared to be his
                will&#44; should not have been intended as permanent&#63; and that He made
                decrees&#44; which according to the import of the words of the 19&#42; <pb n="222"/>

                Unchangeable One&#44; whilst you profess to believe that He has changed &#63; Never
                may this be the uni&#8211; versal opinion of our people &#59; never may the Almighty
                suffer such ideas to become general. For even admit&#8211; ting that the social laws
                should be of paramount im&#8211; portance&#44; still they would cease to be
                regarded&#44; if the ceremonial and devotional ordinances were obliter&#8211; ated
                from the law&#8211;book&#59; for where there is no venera&#8211; tion for the
                Lord&#44; love to man will speedily die away. And even grant that this should not
                be&#44; still the in&#8211; ward satisfaction of a holy life would not be felt any
                more&#59; and from the sick&#8211;bed its consolation would be torn&#59; the poor
                man would lose his comfort&#59; and the oppressed would have nothing left to shield
                him from despair. Here we are brought to a point at which much more might be said
                &#59; yes&#44; the mind becomes bewildered at a view of the frightful chaos
                civilized society would present without the devotional feeling which lies now hidden
                in the bosom of every man who has at any time enjoyed a religious education &#59;

                germ&#59; and its beneficial fruits will ripen one day&#44; though the flowers even
                may not bud till the tree is hastening to decay&#44; and <pb n="223"/> THE
                SANCTIFICATION OF THE LORD. 223 the canker&#8211;worm is ready to devour the tender
                fruit as soon as formed. To drop the metaphor &#58; religion will show its presence
                and hlessed influence&#44; though it may have lain dormant till man is thrown upon
                the bed of sickness&#44; and approaching death will barely grant him sufficient time
                to turn his tearful&#44; repentant eye to Heaven. Thus much&#44; and more&#44; may
                be said in favour of acts of worship&#44; even when considering man only as an
                individual&#44; unconnected with any other one around him. But as a second
                inducement to a devotional conduct we will exhibit him as a member of society&#44;
                created not for his own especial benefit and amuse&#8211; ment alone&#44; but also
                for the advancement of the hap&#8211; piness of others. For man&#44; as he
                exists&#44; has a double existence &#58; one as regards himself&#44; the other as
                being an integral portion of the human family at large. In the latter capacity&#44;
                every one of his acts&#44; be they good or bad&#44; must exercise some influence
                upon the entire mass of men. Not alone is every good act so much positive good added
                to the common stock of happiness&#44; and every evil deed an absolute diminution
                therefrom&#59; but every act must likewise serve as an example&#44; if the same be
                done publicly&#44; or if it leave a trace behind by which it can at some time be
                made public. &#8212; For example&#58; the respect a man pays to his parents is a
                good act in itself&#59; but a twofold good arises from St&#44; inasmuch as other
                children are taught to do the same&#44; when they see how much satisfaction the
                parents of the dutiful child enjoys&#44; and how many blessings are heaped on his
                head for his filial piety. Xow&#44; regardless of the good he does to his
                parents&#44; he is the cause of making filial obedience loved as a <pb n="224"/> 224
                THE SANCTIFICATION OF THE LORD. virtue by others&#59; and consequently this act&#44;
                which is apparently one&#44; becomes a twofold deed of virtue.&#8212; Again&#44; we
                have frequently seen&#44; that if a stranger came to a place where the greater
                part&#44; not to mention the whole&#44; were walking in meekness before the
                Lord&#44; he was ready to become charmed with their course of life&#44; and was
                induced to join them in their plans of goodness. Thus&#44; also&#44; where
                irreligion was pre&#8211; dominant&#44; that new&#8211;comers commonly chimed in
                with the opinions entertained by the majority of the in&#8211; habitants. And&#44;
                in fact&#44; so much importance is at&#8211; tached to example even by the opinion
                of the world&#44; that it is expected as something almost certain&#44; that no one
                will be long able to resist the force of example set him by his associates. &#8212;
                Worship&#44; then&#44; which from its nature in the Jewish religion must be
                public&#44; will confer a twofold share of benefit upon society &#58; first&#44;
                inasmuch as it tends to improve the heart of every man joining in it with
                sincerity&#59; and&#44; secondly&#44; be&#8211; cause the example of one may induce
                the wavering to become religious&#44; and to confirm the good in their former
                conduct. And thus so general a feeling of obedience to the will of God may be
                produced&#44; that it may freely be expected that one will incite the other to acts
                of piety&#59; and in this manner too a state of har&#8211; mony and friendship will
                spring up amidst those uni&#8211; ted together by one mode of worship&#44; and thej
                7 will learn&#44; not only their dependence upon God&#44; but also their relation
                to&#44; and dependence upon&#44; one another. We may therefore maintain&#44; that
                the observance of the ceremonial law tends preeminently to unite more closely the
                worshippers of God&#44; and to promote that concord which should subsist between
                those who hope <pb n="225"/> THE SANCTIFICATION OF THE LORD. 225 for the favour of
                the same Supreme Ruler. &#8212; In this outward exhibition of piety there need not
                be neces&#8211; sarily the least ostentation&#59; for&#44; as already said&#44;
                wor&#8211; ship was intended to be public&#44; and consequently when a man enters
                this holy house&#44; and worships before this holy shrine&#44; it is not to be
                presumed upon any slight evidence&#44; that he believes&#44; or that he should
                wish&#44; the eyes of others to be upon him. No&#59; this cannot be the case where
                all are alike pious&#44; alike devout&#44; alike intent upon serving the same
                God&#44; where all&#44; simulta&#8211; neously invoke the protection of the same
                Redeemer. JSTow it is this holy living&#44; this teaching of virtue by precept and
                example&#44; which we call the sanctijica&#8211; tion of the name of the Lord&#59;
                and if a man was always careful of his religious conduct as well as moral &#8212; if
                the word of God was to his soul a delight &#8212; if the Sabbath of the Lord was to
                him a pleasure &#8212; if the house of worship was the spot which he often visited
                &#8212; if the poor were by him cherished&#44; if the oppressed were by him
                relieved&#44; if the slandered were by him defended &#58; then he has sanctified the
                Holy ISTame as much as though he had died a martyr for the cause of the Lord upon
                the stake of the persecutor &#59; his soul is then as pure as though his best
                life&#39;s&#8211;blood had freely flowed on the scaffold in acknowledging the unity
                of God and maintaining the truth of his law. And although not every one is called
                upon to seal his faith&#44; as those great ones of former days have done by
                gl6rifying their Maker with their death&#58; still the course just described is open
                to all &#59; for this is a contest in which all can join&#44; and a held in which
                all can gain an equal share of renown&#44; a vineyard in which all can gather the

                also&#44; in thy infinite goodness&#44; a knowledge of thy holy ways&#44; as Thou in
                former days didst enlighten the minds of the people Thou hadst redeemed from
                slavery&#44; as they&#44; prostrate at thy feet&#44; received the commands of thy
                mouth in awe and trembling&#44; and shielded by thy majesty&#33; Amen. Brethren&#33;
                We are this day assembled here to celebrate the greatest event&#44; to commemorate
                the highest of bless&#8211; ings&#44; which the Almighty ever caused to gladden the
                hearts of thinking men&#44; and especially of that once great people&#44; of which
                we constitute but a small and feeble remnant. But I will not now enter upon a
                comparison of our state at the time of the promulga&#8211; tion of the law with our
                present condition&#59; as I wish not to sadden the hearts of the community on this
                day of solemn rejoicing by such sad reflections&#59; but I will only revert to a
                portion of the immeasurable good&#44; which was bestowed on us in particular&#44;
                and the entire mass of men in general&#44; by the light which was shed over the
                world by the revelation from Sinai. I advert to the noble conceptions which we in
                this manner received of the attributes of the Deity&#44; so much elevated above
                whatever the wisest of the hea&#8211; thens were&#39; ever able to discover by the
                aid of unas&#8211; sisted reason alone. And let me add&#44; that in nothing were we
                more favourably distinguished above all na&#8211; tions of antiquity&#44; than by
                the knowledge we received through God himself of his ways with man &#59; and it <pb
                    n="228"/> 228 THE GLORY OF THE LORD. seems therefore that this day&#44; devoted
                to commemo&#8211; rate the descent on Sinai&#44; is peculiarly adapted to call up
                feelings of thanks and devotion for the great good so bountifully bestowed&#44; and
                of which we can only prove ourselves worthy by a careful attention to the precepts
                then announced from amidst the fire and thunder by the Almighty himself&#44; without
                the inter&#8211; vention of human agency. JSTot alone in the Deca&#8211; logue&#44;
                however&#44; but also in other parts of Scripture&#44; do we find the sublimest
                truth revealed&#44; and among the many there is hardly one more touching&#44; and
                characteristic of Israel&#39;s God&#44; than the following from the
                thirty&#8211;third chapter of Exodus&#44; which I wish to offer to your
                consideration to&#8211;day&#44; as particularly appropriate to the festival and its
                institution&#58; &#34; And he &#40;Moses&#41; said &#58; Show me&#44; I pray
                Thee&#44; thy glory &#59; &#8212; and He said&#44; I will let all my goodness pass
                before thee.&#34; Exodus xxxiii. 18&#44; 19. Moses was standing in prayer before God
                on the summit of Mount Sinai&#44; in the midst of the desert&#59; and his spirit was
                refreshed by the light of revela&#8211; tion&#44; while he was listening with
                delight to the pre&#8211; cepts which proceeded from the mouth of the Most High
                &#59; and he enjoyed thus an inexpressible pleasure&#44; scarcely inferior to that
                which animates the disem&#8211; bodied soul&#44; when she wings her way to
                Paradise&#44; in holy ecstacy at being sent to scenes of inexhausti&#8211; ble
                bliss&#44; from before the judgment throne of the everlasting Father. &#8212; His
                indeed had been a happy <pb n="229"/> THE GLORY OF THE LORD. 229 lot&#44; his had
                been an eminence rarely reached by mor&#8211; tals &#59; since in prosperity he had
                never become elated with pride&#44; nor had he ever grown faint&#8211;hearted amidst
                trials and dangers. For&#44; nurtured in the bosom of plea&#8211; sure in the palace
                of the Egyptian Pharaoh&#44; his mind had retained its primitive purity&#44; his
                soul its stainless innocence&#44; and the adopted son of the king&#39;s daughter
                forgot not his brethren that groaned in slavery and de&#8211; gradation. And when as
                a fugitive from the vindictive sword of Mitzraim&#39;s ruler he had been compelled
                to seek shelter in a foreign land&#44; where&#44; banished from the scenes of his
                youth&#44; he was not permitted to share the toil even of his own people &#58; his
                heart found conso&#8211; lation in the goodness of God&#44; in the overruling
                provi&#8211; dence of our Father in heaven. And there also&#44; like other suffering
                righteous ones&#44; he was taught that the innocent are not forsaken &#59; for in
                the land of the stran&#8211; ger he found those capable of appreciating honesty and
                integrity of purpose&#44; and obtained a home in the house of the chief of
                Midian&#44; who bestowed on him his daughter as a token of his regard. &#8212; It
                was now&#44; whilst tending the flock of his wife&#39;s father&#44; that Moses for
                the first time heard the voice of God re&#8211; sound in his hearing&#44; and from
                on high he was de&#8211; puted to effect the liberation of his brothers from slavery
                and oppression. With fearful signs he was enabled to force conviction upon an
                obdurate king&#59; and when the task had been accomplished&#44; when Israel had gone
                forth to freedom&#44; he was acknowl&#8211; edged the chosen prophet and the leader
                of the peo&#8211; ple of God &#59; and soon he brought them to the foot of
                Sinai&#44; where was imparted to them the law&#44; more pure than fire&#44; and more
                healthful than the spirit of vol. i. 20 <pb n="230"/> 230 THE GLORY OF THE LORD.
                life itself. Who can estimate the awe&#44; the fear&#44; the joy&#44; and the
                gladness of the people at that awful hour&#44; when they were led forth from the
                camp&#44; to where the glory of God appeared&#44; &#8212; whilst the trum&#8211; pet
                sounded &#8212; whilst the earth trembled &#8212; whilst the mountain smoked &#59;
                &#8212; and more still at that ecstatic moment&#44; when the terrific voice of the
                Eternal One spoke &#58; &#34; I am the Lord thy God.&#34; The mind is lost in
                admiration of the sublimity of the scene&#44; and our reason is unable to
                comprehend&#44; how our ances&#8211; tors must have felt&#44; when they were in
                truth con&#8211; vinced&#44; that now indeed they were the chosen people&#44; since
                it was from Heaven that their law was given &#33; &#8212; If thus the community at
                large were enlightened&#44; &#8212; if thus hidden things were revealed to them&#59;
                how much more must he have seen&#44; the man&#44; who alone was called to the summit
                of the mount &#33; Around him blazed the fiercest fire&#44; but he remained
                un&#8211; scathed &#59; under him the earth shook&#44; but his feet were firm &#59;
                and when all the nation of Israel were unwilling to see the glory of God again
                revealed to them as it had been that day&#44; fearing they might die&#44; his
                courage never wavered &#59; for his knowledge of divine things was greater&#44; and
                his faith in divine protection was firmer&#44; than that of any other mortal &#59;
                and he beheld&#44; and witnessed all&#44; with an unshaken fortitude and a steady
                gaze&#44; as though it were a father coming to visit his child&#44; as though it
                were a fond parent coming to instruct his beloved offspring. But soon&#44; alas
                &#33; the scene was changed &#59; the people who had but lately received the
                law&#44; were misled by folly and presumption&#44; and made themselves a mol&#8211;
                ten calf&#44; &#34; the image of a grass&#8211;eating ox&#44;&#34; and bowed <pb
                    n="231"/> THE GLORY OF THE LORD. 231 down to the work of their own hands. &#34;
                God per&#8211; ceived it and was incensed&#44;&#34; to adopt the language of
                Scripture&#44; and He ordered Moses to go down from Mount Sinai&#44; because the
                people of Israel&#44; whom he had so lately led forth from Egypt&#44; had sinned.
                The prophet then descended&#44; and in his hands were the two tables of stone&#44;
                inscribed by the finger of the Deity with the Ten Commandments&#44; the words of the
                covenant of the Maker of all with his chosen people. But instead of his service&#44;
                iustead of the adoration of the Protector of their forefathers&#44; he beheld the
                calf and the dancing&#44; the idol and its senseless worship &#59; and unwilling to
                deliver to apos&#8211; tates the record of the covenant of everlasting life&#44; he
                threw from his hands the miraculous tables&#44; and broke them at the foot of Sinai.
                And in sorrow and indignation he commanded those who had remained faithful&#44; the
                children of Levi&#44; to revenge the Holy Name that had been profaned&#44; and there
                fell a multi&#8211; tude who had bowed the knee before the abomina&#8211; tion of
                the people of Egypt. When the most guilty had thus been punished&#44; he went up
                again on the mount to ask forgiveness for the transgressors&#44; and he remained
                there forty days and forty nights&#44; with&#8211; out tasting earthly food&#44; to
                secure preservation for those who had proved themselves so unworthy of God&#39;s
                favour&#59; and his prayer was heard&#44; and the threatened ptmishment was averted.
                It was here&#44; and at this time that Moses&#44; who had seen of God&#39;s ways so
                much more than ever had been before or since revealed to man&#44; asked of the Lord
                to let him see his glory. Moses had before this be&#8211; held the power of God
                manifested in so many won&#8211; <pb n="232"/> 232 THE GLORY OF THE LORD. derful
                ways &#59; he had been upheld amidst the threat&#8211; enings of the greatest
                dangers&#59; he had heard the words of the Supreme Wisdom&#44; whenever the
                wel&#8211; fare of Israel required it&#59; more wisdom and knowl&#8211; edge than
                ever had been conferred on man were his &#58; and yet he confessed by his earnest
                prayer&#44; that to him too the Deity was a mystery&#44; a mystery be&#8211; yond
                what all his knowledge and wisdom could ever hope to reach. &#8212; Here let us
                pause. &#8212; &#34; Show me thy glory I&#34; thus prayed the most gifted of
                mortals&#59; not he dared to dive into the secrets of creation &#59; not he ventured
                to lift his searching view into the nature and essence of God&#59; for amidst all
                that his mind had conceived&#44; the All&#8211;powerful One yet remained hid&#8211;
                den&#44; a mystery too great&#44; too holy&#44; to be unravelled&#59; a Being too
                fearful to be approached by the nights of thought. &#8212; If thus Moses acted&#44;
                how darest thou&#44; presumptuous&#44; ignorant man&#44; endeavour to pry into that
                which escaped the knowledge of the father of the prophets&#63; weenest thou to be
                wiser than he&#44; who was by God instructed &#63; &#8212; To know what is God
                &#8212; to investigate the nature of his being &#8212; are these studies suitable
                for short&#8211;lived man &#63; are these the points to which his inquiries should
                be directed &#63; when his own being is a secret to him &#59; and when he knows not
                how his own mind works&#44; shall he di&#8211; rect his search into the Author of
                his mind &#63; &#8212; how true it is&#44; that only the really wise discover how
                in&#8211; sufficient their reason&#44; how limited their means of research are &#33;
                The object of his second ascent to Sinai had been attained&#44; inasmuch as the
                transgressions of the sinful people had been remitted&#44; and the punishment
                de&#8211; <pb n="233"/> THE GLORY OF THE LORD. 233 nounced against all&#44;
                inflicted upon the hardened few only &#58; yet Moses lingered in the Sacred
                Presence&#44; anxious&#44; as said already&#44; for more knowledge&#44; con&#8211;
                vineed that of his own accord he could not penetrate farther. Impelled by this
                desire it was&#44; that he asked of the Eternal One &#58; &#34; Show me&#44; I pray
                Thee&#44; thy glory&#59;&#39;&#39; he wanted to become more familiar with the being
                of the Deity&#44; than a view of outward na&#8211; ture permits to man &#59; he
                wished to discover why things were organized as they are &#59; to understand&#44;
                how the power of God works in secret every thing which we perceive by our senses. It
                was here also&#44; whilst standing on the mount&#44; that he was answered to his
                prayer by the words of the Almighty &#58; &#34;I will let all my goodness pass
                before thee.&#34; Let it be observed in what manner God granted Moses&#39;s wish for
                extended knowledge. Moses&#44; not satisfied &#34;with all he had seen&#44; desired
                to witness the power of Heaven manifested in a more striking decree than it had been
                hitherto in his presence &#59; he petitioned for an increased sphere of
                understanding&#44; conceiving that which he possessed to be as yet incomplete. But
                he was answered&#44; that to him&#44; as man&#44; no far&#8211; ther knowledge could
                be granted&#44; and that he must&#44; therefore&#44; not hope for a more extended
                view of the Divine Being&#59; &#34;for no man&#44;&#34; says the text&#44; &#34;can
                see me and live &#59;&#34; but in lieu of this&#44; he was pro&#8211; mised&#44; as
                something more suitable for human nature&#44; to have the goodness of God more
                clearly displayed to him&#44; and to be shown more strongly than hitherto&#44; how
                kind and beneficent are the ways of the Infinite&#44; and Merciful One&#44; towards
                his creatures &#33; How pro&#8211; found a theme for meditation this presents to our

                his glory &#33; for so was Moses taught to satisfy his thirst for farther wisdom and
                knowledge of the ways of the Lord. Ask we then &#58; &#34; What is God &#63;&#34; we
                shall discover&#44; that He is good&#44; and that to his kindness alone all owe
                their being&#44; that to His benevolence all are in&#8211; debted for their
                preservation&#44; and that to His provi&#8211; dence all are compelled to look for
                happiness. &#8212; u No man can see me and live.&#34; No&#44; not whilst our soul is

                forgiven&#44; but that still a moderate punish&#8211; ment was inflicted&#44; to
                show that although God is merciful&#44; forgives sin and will not destroy&#44; still
                sin cannot escape without retribution. This is the glory of God which was shown to
                Moses&#44; and thus it was made manifest to him&#44; how far it is becoming for man
                to search into the ways of his Creator. &#34;I will let all my goodness pass before
                thee&#44;&#34; and so indeed it did happen &#59; and the power of God passed before
                Moses on Mount Sinai&#44; whilst he&#44; the chosen servant&#44; stood in the hollow
                of the rock at Horeb&#44; and before him was proclaimed &#58; &#34; The Eternal Lord
                is an everlasting Being&#44; merciful&#44; gracious&#44; long suf&#8211; fering&#44;

                of the glory of God&#44; and in this we acknowledge a kind and just Being&#44;
                who&#44; when forgiving sin&#44; pun&#8211; ishes past transgression with paternal
                chastisement&#44; and thus shows&#44; that there is a discrimination between his

                the cloud in which the glory of the Most High had descended&#44; he heard the

                written&#44; by request of an esteemed friend&#44; as an illustration of the
                eighteenth and nineteenth verses of the thirty&#8211;third chapter of Exodus. It
                will be perceived&#44; that I have followed the English version&#44; although I am
                well aware that the word 31D&#44; rendered goodness&#44; may also mean property or
                posses&#8211; sion. Still the selection of this word instead of &#34;N 2D&#44; used
                by Moses&#44; must refer to the quality or attribute of goodness more immediately
                than to a display of extraordinary power. Add to which&#44; that Moses had asked to
                be made acquainted with God&#39;s ways &#59; to which he was answered&#44; that the
                Lord would be merciful to those He thought deserving&#44; &#8212; implying&#44; that
                it is not for man to ponder too much upon God&#39;s government. &#8212; This
                discourse is merely a sketch&#44; an illustration more than a commentary&#44;
                and&#44; consequently&#44; its brevity and &#39;apparent want of connexion must not
                be too severely judged. The limits of a note will not permit me to say more&#44;

                RIGHTEOUS. Glory and adoration to our everlasting King and almighty Ruler. Amen.
                Brethren &#33; Of all things which we call certain&#44; and upon the coming of which
                we confidently rely in our earthly <pb n="238"/> 238 THE DEATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS.
                career &#58; nothing is more certain&#44; nothing more inevi&#8211; table&#44; than
                the close of this career&#44; the death of the body. &#8212; In every
                under&#8211;taking&#44; no matter how well every thing may have been arranged&#44;
                if even so&#44; as almost to preclude disappointment&#44; disappointment may
                nevertheless ensue&#44; and mar the confident hopes of the deceived expectant&#59;
                but unless the miraculous hand of God interferes&#44; to snatch his servants from
                the jaws of death&#44; as it happened with Enoch and Elijah&#44; no human being can
                escape the return to dust&#59; for no human power is able to avert the impending
                dissolution of the bodily organs&#44; or to oppose aught to the severing of the mind
                from matter. It has been so decreed&#44; ever since our first progenitors sinned in
                Eden&#44; that man should be mortal&#44; subject to decay and corruption&#44; and
                that however long the day of death be delayed&#44; come it must&#44; nay&#44;
                perhaps una&#8211; wares&#44; like the thief in the night&#44; who enters the
                de&#8211; fenceless and unwatched dwelling&#44; when flo one ex&#8211; pects or
                dreads his coming. &#8212; It behoves us&#44; therefore&#44; and every other member
                of Adam&#39;s sinful race&#44; to reflect on&#58; What is life&#63; what is
                death&#63; &#8212; what in&#8211; fluence have both upon the constitution and nature
                of man&#63; &#39;Life&#44; to judge from our experience&#44; is the state of
                existence in which created beings act and suffer&#59; and death is the state&#44;
                when the body of these creatures ceases to act&#44; and cannot&#44; to
                appearance&#44; be benefitted or harmed by the acts of others. But this is true of
                the body only&#44; and in this man is similar to the beast&#44; for that too acts
                while it lives&#44; and is be&#8211; yond the power of harm when dead. &#8212;
                Yet&#44; if this were all of life that belongs to man&#44; not so much anx&#8211;
                iety were needed to endeavour to obtain comforts and <pb n="239"/> THE DEATH OF THE
                RIGHTEOUS. 239 to obviate evil &#59; not then would it be matter of im&#8211;
                portance to acquire a knowledge of more than our eyes can behold or the ears
                hear&#59; not then would it be proper&#44; that men should traverse the trackless
                ocean in quest of the products of foreign climes&#59; not then would it be useful to
                restrain the passions&#44; and protect one from the evil intentions of the
                other&#59; since the mere clay&#44; which must perish&#44; and perish too before the
                thousandth part of all its desires is sat&#8211; isfied&#44; deserves not more care
                than the beast of the field or the bird of heaven requires&#44; that takes its food
                wherever it finds it&#44; and that dies as soon as the animal functions cease to
                operate from inward decay&#44; or when it falls a prey to the cupidity of man or the
                cunning and superior strength or address of other animals. But in addition to the
                experience derived from bodily sensations&#44; and the ideas acquired by means of
                the outward organs&#44; there is a feeling within us&#44; a monitor&#44; which
                teaches&#44; that life is not confined to outward&#44; bodily actions&#44; and that
                death is not the extinction of the vital spark. &#8212; For if we pursue a train of
                thought&#44; we will soon discover&#44; that although as men&#44; our ideas are
                inseparable from matter in the various shapes in which it exists&#44; we are yet
                able to extend our search beyond the objects which come immediately under our view
                or of which we have any particular knowledge from personal experience&#44; and that
                in fact &#94;ery often our greatest joys and our most poignant afflictions are
                produced by imagination and reflection. What&#44; I ask&#44; has this thought&#44;
                unconnect&#8211; ed with any particular outward object&#44; to do with the dull&#44;
                inert&#44; selfish mass of clay of which our outward forms are made &#63; Is it in
                the power of mere sentient <pb n="240"/> 240 THE DEATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS. matter to
                erect&#44; so to speak&#44; a structure of imagery to delight or depress the
                feeling&#63; In what manner could the animal sensation of the human system
                ena&#8211; ble us to go beyond ourselves from a serious contem&#8211; plation of
                nature &#8212; and next&#44; to let this view of nature exert a permanent influence
                over us&#44; so much so per&#8211; haps as to induce us even to change the line of
                con&#8211; duct upon which we have been hitherto acting &#63; And is it not
                notorious&#44; that many a careless person has had his attention arrested&#44; and
                has been roused to re&#8211; flection by contemplating&#44; in moments of joy or
                sad&#8211; ness&#44; the great works of the supreme Architect&#63; &#34; But truly
                there is a spirit within men&#44; and the mind of God maketh them wise&#59;&#34;
                this we are told by the sacred writer&#44; and this our experience&#44; the child of
                mental reflection&#44; teaches&#44; and in this our nature is infinitely elevated
                above that of the brute &#59; and it is by the operations of mind and not of matter
                that we are taught to feel that we are creatures of a merciful God&#44; and that to
                Him our spirit returneth&#44; when its connexion with the perishable body is
                dissolved. &#8212; Life&#44;&#44; therefore&#44; is the connected existence of a
                divine spirit with an animal body&#44; which compound state enables man to do
                whatever is necessary for his self&#8211; preservation&#44; and to judge at the same
                time of things presented to the consideration of his mind&#44; which mind&#44;
                however&#44; is restrained from having a correct and perfect view in all cases of
                the nature and object of things&#44; since it is encumbered with sensual organs
                which from their constitution are disqualified from comprehending aught essentially
                different from a bodily substance. And death is the dismemberment of this
                connexion&#44; by which the body is rendered <pb n="241"/> THE DEATH OF THE
                RIGHTEOUS. 241 unfit for the farther service of the soul&#44; and by which the
                latter is freed from the encumbrance of the clay&#59; and which dissolution renders
                her exempt from ca&#8211; lamities and circumstances attendant upon bodily or&#8211;
                gans. If this is admitted to be the nature of man&#44; his life and his death &#58;
                it follows that&#44; since death is not the annihilation of the human system&#44;
                life &#8212; so called &#8212; is a state of preparation&#44; in which it is our
                business to endeavour to acquire the means necessary to fit us for the impending
                altered state of existence&#59; unless one could persuade himself that human life
                had been so admirably organized without any refer&#8211; ence to an ulterior object.
                When&#44; however&#44; we look inquiringly into nature&#44; we shall find that
                nothing is without its object&#59; since even to our obscured rea&#8211; soning
                powers the causes of many things&#44; animate and inanimate&#44; are apparent&#44;
                and we are able to show how they are connected link by link with the great universal
                principle which pervades all. To judge then from analogy&#44; human life also has
                its ulterior object&#44; and it remains to be discovered what this may be &#59; or
                in other words&#44; we ought to inquire &#58; &#34; What course are Ave to
                pursue&#44; according to the instruction of our Creator&#44; that we may be ready
                and prepared for the altered state of existence for which we are destined &#63;
                &#34; If now we had not a revelation of God to guide us&#44; if we had no conception
                of his intentions&#44; we might li&#94;e the brief space allotted to us according to
                the impulse of our feelings &#58; we might then pre&#8211; sume that actions
                prompted by the outward senses are the proper deeds&#44; by which we can prepare
                our&#8211; selves for the future. But we have a revelation of God&#39;s will&#44; we
                have a system of rules from the All&#8211; VOL. I. 21 <pb n="242"/> 242 THE DEATH OF
                THE RIGHTEOUS. wise Father&#44; which were evidently instituted for our benefit
                &#58; and we maintain therefore that it is the law of the Lord which points out to
                us the means we are to employ to prepare ourselves for death. Let us then look into
                the book of revelation&#44; let us examine the records of God&#39;s wisdom&#44; and
                the testimony of his rule on earth &#58; and we shall be informed that it is his
                wish that every man should inherit happiness&#44; and be deserving of unchangeable
                satisfaction&#44; with this only condition&#44; that each and every member of the
                human family should earn this happiness for him&#8211; self by his own acts&#44; or
                regain the same by a sincere repentance and an humble submission to divine
                dis&#8211; pensation&#44; in case he has thoughtlessly lost sight for a time of the
                path of righteousness. For although to sin is contrary to our happiness&#44; still
                the Almighty will graciously accept a forsaking of the evil &#59; inas&#8211; much
                as our nature is not free from evil inclination&#44; nor our mind at all times fit
                to understand the ways of Providence &#59; and as thus sinning&#44; even with
                fore&#8211; thought&#44; may proceed from ignorance and inattention&#44; God will
                not utterly reject the transgressor&#44; because He is great and cognizant of our
                weakness&#59; since&#44; as we have said&#44; while the soul is yet connected with
                the body&#44; she is prevented from having a perfect and correct view of the nature
                of all things&#44; owing to her receiving her impressions through means of material
                organs&#44; which from their very constitution are unable to comprehend things
                essentially different in their composition from the qualities of matter. This
                be&#8211; ing the case in our state of mixed existence&#44; of flesh and spirit&#44;
                it is not to be wondered at that&#44; misled by appearance&#44; we may be
                induced&#44; unless we guard <pb n="243"/> THE DEATH OE THE RIGHTEOUS. 243 ourselves
                carefully&#44; to regard that as important which is really trifliug&#44; and even to
                mistake the evil for the good. If then we act from these erroneous impres&#8211;
                sions&#44; trusting to our knowledge and judgment as efficient guides&#44; it is
                almost necessary that we should be led into innumerable errors&#44; and practise the
                evil instead of the good&#44; and offend our heavenly Kiug by the wickedness of our
                works. But if we&#44; fully alive to our imperfections and watchful over the
                per&#8211; suasions of bodily organs&#44; firmly resolve to be guided by the
                instructions of divine revelation &#58; it is neces&#8211; sary that we should
                become virtuous&#44; nay more&#44; that we should be enabled to go counter to our
                natural impulses&#44; if they interfere with the dictates of God&#39;s w T ill &#59;
                and we may thus be rendered righteous&#44; as far as being righteous is compatible
                with our nature. And since now death is the aim and termination of earthly life&#44;
                since from the moment of our birth we verge onward to eternity &#58; how sweet must
                be the departure of him who&#44; having always the certain end in view&#44;
                invariably acted in a manner calculated to enable him to enter into the impending
                altered state of being&#44; into the more immediate presence of God&#44; free from

                worship&#44; to whom it could not be made intelligible that the providence of God

                forgetting that they are mortal&#44; and because they imagine that&#44; when they

                noth&#8211; ing to apprehend from the interference of Providence &#58; when they
                should know that to God they must return whether they deny his superintendence or
                not&#44; and render an account before Him&#44; the Judge&#44; from whom naught is
                concealed&#44; and to whom the past&#44; the pres&#8211; ent&#44; and the future are

                would be almost worse&#44; if it were not that existence even under suffering is
                better far than non&#8211;existence&#44; to be doomed to punishment after death for
                a period which our sins may demand from the justice of God&#63; Well must it be for
                each of us&#44; if we take our life and its close daily and hourly into
                consideration&#44; if we suffer neither prejudice nor self&#8211;love to blind
                us&#44; and to persuade us to close our eyes upon our failings and transgressions.
                We are but too apt to turn away our view from the consequences of one act&#44; for
                we say&#44; it is but a single folly &#59; but every folly&#44; every fault&#44;
                every sin&#44; will disqualify us in some respect from relishing the good and holy
                &#59; and where is the necessity of purchasing salvation by repentance&#44; when we
                can enjoy ease of mind and the good&#8211;will of God and men by a uniform virtuous

                is at best but a remedy&#44; it must be evident&#44; that it would be far better to
                adhere always to the law &#59; since if we act otherwise&#44; we may be overtaken by
                death before we have time to alter our course&#59; and whom can we blame for our

                uniform virtuous life&#44; there is jet another&#44; which is&#44; that it makes the
                person so acting always &#34;beloved bj all the world&#59; and when the good

                son is removed&#44; it strikes us as though something necessary to our comfort had
                been withdrawn. We do not pity the death of the good&#44; for we feel that their
                happiness is well secured&#59; but we lament for ourselves&#44; that we can no
                longer enjoy their example and be improved by their precepts. But let the wicked
                die&#44; how it almost makes us shudder to think of their pain&#44; their inglorious
                perishing &#59; and an in&#8211; voluntary feeling of anguish will come over us&#44;
                and we must bemoan their unhappiness&#44; although com&#8211; pelled to
                acknowledge&#44; that the world has gained by their removal from amongst active
                beings&#44; since now they have it no&#42; longer in their power to harm others and
                to injure themselves by their deeds of wicked&#8211; ness. &#8212; This is but a
                small portion of the difference existing between the death of the righteous and of
                the wicked&#59; but the few distinguishing traits here exhibited will doubtless be
                enough to demonstrate the superiority of virtue over vice&#44; although there were
                no greater pre&#8211;eminence in the former over the latter. Althouglt&#8211;it is
                unbecoming to make personal allu&#8211; sions to the faults of any individual in a
                public ad&#8211; dress&#44; I do not apprehend that any objection can be made to my

                of our ex&#8211; cellent sister&#44;&#42; whom we followed this week to the grave.
                She lived long&#44; and perhaps as happily&#44; as but few mortals can ever expect
                to live. But she deserved this long life and this happiness&#44; for during all the
                period of eighty and live years&#44; the breath of slander dared never to fasten
                upon her&#44; and under all the trials to which she was exposed in common with all
                the rest of mankind&#44; she exhibited the for&#8211; titude well becoming a
                daughter of Israel&#44; who knows her God&#44; and knows too&#44; that to confide in
                Him is the best support. And also the esteem of all who became acquainted with her
                was cheerfully yielded&#44; and unless I am much deceived&#44; there are few or
                none&#44; that did not admire her social and religious virtues&#44; and by whom she
                was not regarded with filial reverence. But at last the hour of her dissolu&#8211;
                tion came&#44; and although the close of her life was painful&#44; yet in mercy the
                illness that preceded it was of but few days&#39; duration &#59; and full of years
                and honours&#44; we consigned her to the tomb&#44; there to sleep till the Father of
                all wakens the slumberers in the dust to everlasting life and happiness. &#8212;
                Should not the example of this excellent person animate us to imitate her good
                deeds&#44; and endeavour to avoid any errors &#40;since all mortals are liable to
                err&#41; which we may discover in her ways &#63; Such a line of conduct &#42; The

                one of us &#59; but we ought to consider&#44; that not for reward should we be
                good&#44; but that through weal and wo we are bound to adhere to our
                righteousness&#44; taking the law of God as our guiding&#8211; star to the haven of
                happiness &#59; so that&#44; living faith&#8211; fully in the faith and fear of the
                Lord&#44; we may at the last be able to breathe out our spirit as did the
                right&#8211; eous men of old&#44; and deserve&#44; that our end should be like
                theirs&#44; untrammelled by sin&#44; and freed from the pollution to which our
                mortal body and sinful pro&#8211; pensities may have inadvertently exposed us. May
                the God of our fathers bless us all with his grace&#44; and render our life free
                from intense bodily suffering&#44; and give us every day our necessary sup&#8211;
                port&#44; so that we may be exempt from corroding care and temptation to sin &#59;
                and when the hour of our death has come&#44; may He make easy for us our de&#8211;
                parture hence&#44; and&#44; receiving us in favour&#44; bestow on us the undying
                light of his presence&#44; and the reward which He has laid by for those who confide

                next to assisting an enemy in the hour of his distress&#44; it is the noblest
                feeling in which we can indulge. I allude not to the ambition .which assumes the

                purpose of obtaining lucre&#44; power&#44; or renown. &#8212; Let such a patriot be
                ever so distant from the home of his childhood&#44; ever so far from the land of his
                birth&#44; to it his mind will re&#8211; vert &#59; nay&#44; though his countrymen
                have treated him with ingratitude or undeserved wrong&#44; he will still be willing
                to act the part of a good citizen&#44; despite of the ill&#8211;treatment he may
                have encountered. And the exile too will think with fond regret of the spot&#44;
                where his parents repose in their graves&#44; to the place&#44; where he first
                indulged in his youthful plays&#59; and no land upon earth can awaken in him those
                feelings of ardour and devotion&#44; which his native soil calls up within his
                bosom. &#8212; If we apply these general princi&#8211; ples to our own particular
                condition&#44; it behoves us to inquire&#58; &#34;Which is the country that the
                collective nation of Israelites can call their own land&#63;&#34; Is it this
                land&#44; where freedom dwells&#63; Is it the land of the Spaniard&#44; where the
                name of freedom is almost unknown &#63; Is it the wide desert of Central Asia&#44;
                where the barbarous Tartar feeds his countless herds &#63; Is it the country&#44;
                where the Russian despot rules with tyrannic sway&#63; &#8212; Xo&#33; no&#33; it is
                the favoured land of the East&#44; where the Israelites dwelled of yore&#44; it is

                home&#44; and he should always regard himself as having an interest in its soil&#44;
                although he has been born in exile&#44; in the country of the stranger&#44; far from
                the banks of the lovely Jordan&#59; for there it was&#44; where our national glory
                reached its highest eleva&#8211; tion&#44; and because we have remained scattered
                and disunited&#44; ever since we were driven thence. &#8212; Do not misunderstand me
                as saying&#44; that you should not re&#8211; gard the country in which you live as
                your own&#44; and that you should not endeavour to serve it according to the best of
                your abilities &#59; for we are commanded by the prophet&#44; speaking in the name
                of God&#44; &#34; to seek the peace of the city to&#44; which we have been
                banished.&#34; As Jews&#44; therefore&#44; and believers in the revealed law and the
                prophets&#44; we are bound to obey the laws of the land and to uphold the
                authorities in every instance&#44; where their edicts are not at variance with the
                commandments of God. Every Israelite is accordingly obliged to contribute to the
                maintenance of the state&#44; and it would be unpardonable in any one to endeavour
                to avoid paying the government dues by any fraudulent device whatsoever. In
                inculcating&#44; therefore&#44; a love for Palestine&#44; it must by no means be
                understood as in any manner teaching and enforc&#8211; ing a diminished love for our
                present abode&#59; nay more&#44; according to our rules&#44; it is wrong to offend
                against the laws of even a despotic country &#59; how much more then ought we to
                observe this regulation in this and other countries&#44; where we have a small share
                in the legislation&#44; by having the equal right to vote for the representatives of
                the people&#44; who. enact the laws. &#8212; Still&#44; as we have said in the
                beginning of <pb n="253"/> THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL. 253 these remarks&#44; the
                home of the Israelite is the distant land of Moria&#44; where the glory of the Lord
                used to shine and instruct the children of his choice &#59; and if we take hut a
                rapid view of our national history&#44; it can he readily shown that we have lost
                much by hav&#8211; ing been hurried from the boundaries of our own &#8212; our
                father&#8211;land. After the flood had swept away the sinful race of men from the
                surface of the earth&#44; and left Noah alone with his family to repeople the earth
                &#58; we find that those born after this catastrophe learnt in an in&#8211; credibly
                short time to dispense with the service of God&#44; undeterred by the destruction of
                their prede&#8211; cessors&#44; and they worshipped the most disgusting&#42;
                creatures of their fancy &#59; nay&#44; that their apostacy proceeded so far as to
                make it dangerous for any one to avow his attachment to the Creator. It was then
                that a man arose in the land of Chaldea&#44; whose name was Abram&#44; the
                ancestor&#44; as you all know&#44; of our people&#44; who acknowledged and
                worshipped the Most High alone&#44; the Maker of heaven and earth. The
                patriarch&#44; ordered by Him he adored&#44; left his native land and his
                father&#39;s house&#44; and wandered unto the neighbourhood of Hebron in the land of
                Canaan&#44; where he erected an altar and spread abroad the light which was within
                him&#44; and he taught an ignorant people the knowledge of that Being&#44; to whom
                alone their reverence was due. Now it must be observed&#44; that it was this same
                land&#44; at present known under the name of Palestine&#44; which God promised to
                him as an inheritance for his descendants &#59; and He told him&#44; that they
                should return to it&#44; after a temporary absence&#44; at the expiration of four

                in the quiet possession of it&#44; whilst they observed the covenant and precepts of
                the Lord. It therefore came to pass&#44; that when the Israelites&#44; the
                descendants of Abraham by his grandson Jacob&#44; surnamed Israel&#44; had been
                released from Egypt&#44; a deputation of the people entered the land of Canaan&#44;
                exactly at the expiration of the appointed time&#44; to survey the coun&#8211; try
                they were ordered to conquer. And when they had been led through the wilderness for
                a period of forty years&#44; under the guidance of Moses&#44; detained so long for
                their rebellion ten times repeated&#44; and for the sake of fortifying them in faith
                towards the Lord&#58; they were led by Joshua&#44; the servant and disciple of
                Moses&#44; over the Jordan into the land promised unto their ancestors. Here they
                dwelt for the space of nine hundred years&#44; governed by their own laws&#44;
                admin&#8211; istered by men chosen by and from amongst them&#8211; selves. And here
                too they might have dwelt for ever&#44; with none to make them afraid&#44; if they
                had been mind&#8211; ful of the covenant&#44; and had observed the statutes which
                alone were the firm foundation of their com&#8211; monwealth. But&#44; for the law
                of God they substituted the dictates of their own fancy&#59; and following the
                example of other nations&#44; they worshipped idols&#44; things that could not
                save&#44; and eventually neglected altogether the precepts of the law. &#8212; It
                had been fore&#8211; told to them by Moses&#44; that apostacy should be fol&#8211;
                lowed by expulsion from their lovely inheritance &#59; and they had&#44;
                therefore&#44; every reason to expect the threat&#8211; ened punishment as the
                instantaneous consequence of their transgression. But the Father of mercy&#44;
                knowing the weakness of human nature&#44; delayed his anger for a long time &#59;
                and to warn the people&#44; <pb n="255"/> THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL. 255 and in

                knowledge and renowned for their piety&#44; to incite their sinning brethren to
                re&#8211; pentance&#59; but ail was in vain&#59; for if even one genera&#8211; tion
                returned and sought the Lord&#44; the succeeding one added wicked sinfulness to the
                apostacy of their pre&#8211; decessors&#59; till at length it became an act of mercy
                to expel the children of Jacob from their land&#44; to obvi&#8211; ate by the timely
                punishment the utter estrangement of the chosen people of God. It therefore
                happened&#44; that the kingdom of Israel&#44; so called&#44; was subverted by the
                Assyrians&#44; who drove away the inhabitants to the cities of Media and to other
                places&#44; and substituted in their stead various foreign tribes&#44; all subject
                to the sway of the Assyrian king. &#8212; The kingdom of Judah&#44; composed of the
                tribes of Judah and Benjamin&#44; to&#8211; gether with the Levites&#44; who had
                been banished from the rival state&#44; ought now to have taken warning at the
                example of awful&#8211; retribution exhibited before their eyes. In fact&#44;
                Hezekiah&#44; son of Ahaz&#44; king of Judah&#44; rejected his father&#39;s
                idolatry&#44; and governed the people in piety&#44; a worthy successor of his
                glorious ancestor&#44; David &#59; he re&#8211;established the holy worship &#59;
                and in his clays it was really that the prophecy of Isaiah&#44; in calling the
                child&#44; expected at the time when Ahaz was threatened by the kings of Israel and
                Syria&#44; &#34;the Prince of Peace&#34; was fulfilled&#44; and it&#42; seemed that
                the favour of God had again been bestowed on the exhausted land. But the pious king
                was gathered unto his fathers&#44; and all the good accomplished by him was more
                than counterbalanced by his unworthy son Menasseh&#44; and by all the succeeding
                kings&#44; with the sole exception of Josiah&#44; who was&#44; as we are told&#44;

                so long denounced&#44; could now be no longer averted&#59; and when&#44; under the
                reign of Zedekiah&#44; the last king of David&#39;s line&#44; the measure of our
                sins was nearly overflowing&#44; Nebuchadnezzar&#44; permitted by the jus&#8211;
                tice of Heaven&#44; conquered the holy city&#44; and led the remainder of the
                Israelites&#44; that had escaped the slaughter&#44; captives to Babylon&#44; and he
                left none but the poorer classes&#44; who however soon fled to Egypt&#44; to escape
                the dreaded vengeance of the Babylonians for the murder of Gedaliah. Thus was the
                strength of Israel broken &#59; thus was all that was grand and beautiful
                demolished&#44; and Palestine&#44; once so populous and powerful&#44; was left
                without airinhabitant&#59; till at length God inclined the heart of Cyrus&#44; king
                of Per&#8211; sia&#44; to mercy&#44; and he permitted the Jews to return and to
                rebuild their city and temple. Let us observe&#44; that by this return of the
                captives&#44; the Israelitish na&#8211; tion was not restored &#59; since the ten
                tribes&#44; who for&#8211; merly had composed the kingdom of Israel&#44; were yet
                left in banishment&#59; and to this day the researches of travellers and wise men
                have not been able to trace their fate &#59; and we are unable to tell whether they
                are living in some remote land as firm adherents of the God of their fathers&#44;
                whose chastening hand they have felt&#59; or whether they have&#44; mingling with

                destruction of the first temple &#59; and where has been&#44; since that period&#44;

                the Psalmists after the rebuild&#8211; ing of the temple &#63; &#8212; But this
                second temple was never&#8211; theless in a measure much more glorious than the
                first&#59; since&#44; during the period of its existence&#44; the name of the Lord
                became more known to the nations of the earth&#44; and even the enemies of the Jews
                were&#44; by their intercourse with them&#44; taught a purer law&#44; and they
                caught a glimpse as it were of the blessed truths which are contained in our code.
                The false ideas of Grecian philosophers with regard to the di&#8211; vine nature
                received a shock from which they have never recovered&#44; by the translation&#44;
                and consequent farther diffusion&#44; of the Pentateuch by the seventy elders under
                the Egyptian king&#44; Ptolemy Lagos &#59; and thus it was verified&#44; that &#34;
                the glory of the second house should be greater than that of the first&#34; built by
                Solomon&#44; the outward splendour of which far sur&#8211; passed that of the one
                erected by the handful of ex&#8211; iles&#44; whom Cyrus permitted to revisit their
                desolate land. Add to which&#44; that idolatry&#44; as a national crime&#44; was
                unknown during the entire period under discussion&#44; and that the individual zeal
                of a great number of pious persons was now continually exerted to preserve the law
                unmixed&#44; by multiplying copies of the same and expounding obscure texts &#58;
                and we have enough to assert&#44; that the prediction of the pro&#8211; phet was

                temple&#44; it will keep the religion of our forefathers alive and active in our
                hearts&#59; if our sorrow cannot reunite the nation in one land&#44; it will at
                least link together the hearts of all believers&#44; be they ever so far separated
                by oceans&#44; by deserts&#44; by the eternal snows of the pole&#44; or the burning
                sand of Africa&#39;s inhospitable clime. More than this need not be urged in reply
                to the foregoing objections&#59; for if religion is not entirely absent from the
                mind&#44; the short explanations given must be amply sufficient to remove them. Let
                us then&#44; brethren&#44; unite from year to year&#44; whilst we live in foreign
                lands&#44; to pay the patriot&#39;s tribute&#44; the exile&#39;s tear&#44; to the
                deserted homes of our ancestors &#58; and let us devote the days of fasting
                ap&#8211; pointed by the prophets&#44; to mourn over the fallen glory of Jacob that
                has departed&#44; over the sun of Israel that has set&#44; &#8212; But no &#33; the
                sun of Israel has not set &#8212; for ever&#59; true&#44; his light is now
                veiled&#44; his rays we seek in vain with our agonized vision &#59; his warmth no
                more quickens the blood in our veins. Yet the time&#44; nevertheless&#44; will
                come&#44; when he will shine forth again with redoubled splendour&#59; when his
                light will be seven&#8211;fold to what it&#94;was before its obscuration&#44; when
                nations will bask in his beams&#44; and foreign climes be quickened into eternal
                life by his refulgence. &#8212; But&#44; alas&#33; for our sinful people&#44; they
                delay the time of salvation by their thoughtlessness&#59; they care not for the
                promised redemption &#59; nay&#44; some even hug the chains of their slavery&#44;
                and say &#58; &#34; We wish not freedom.&#34; Can we then wonder&#44; that the anger

                it&#44; and accept our birthright as a boon from the hands of our former
                enemies&#44; and forget that it is God who procures us enlargement&#63; Have we any
                right to complain of persecution&#44; when we are ever ready to break the laws&#44;
                as soon as the bonds of servitude are a little loosened &#8212; when we are always
                glad to escape from the burdens of religion&#44; so soon as the chains of the
                oppressor are rendered somewhat less galling&#63; And add to this ingratitude
                towards God&#44; the want of love one Jew feels for the other&#59; and see how
                little unanimity exists even in the small councils of our scattered communities&#59;
                and observe how apt and willing every one is to play the tyrant in his little
                circle&#44; when he is raised to au&#8211; thority &#59; and the want of
                obedience&#44; which many dis&#8211; play to wholesome regulations&#44; enacted for

                of commonwealth could be formed out of such materials&#63; No&#44; God is just&#44;
                it is ourselves who retard our happiness&#59; it is we ourselves&#44; who delay the
                day of salvation. But as there are&#44; thanks be to God&#44; always some in every

                so also will the hour of favour for our deliver&#8211; ance arrive&#44; though
                tardily. And how can we fear of its not coming on account of the delay&#63; Some

                holy law is spreading &#8212; in every country some rays of light are
                penetrating&#59; and to what other cause can this change be attributed&#44; but to
                the influence of the law&#44; which was given through Moses&#44; and which has
                be&#8211; come more known&#44; more admired&#44; and more followed by the nations of

                but they were enlight&#8211; ened by us&#44; and our wounds opened to them the
                fountain of light and happiness. &#8212; Am I asserting more than the experience of

                pass&#44; that our nation is then nigh its dissolution. But is there a Jew who would
                not exert all his energy&#44; no matter how little soever his acts may be in

                Israel&#44; have a temple to weep for&#44; and a conquered and oppressed people to
                bemoan &#59; but while thus mourning&#44; let us not waver in our hopes&#44; nor

                followed sin&#44; and that Israel was nevertheless at no time left entirely at the
                mercy of the foeman. Can any one then doubt&#44; that the other prophecies will be
                fulfilled as well as those which have already been accomplished&#63; And truly&#44;
                brethren&#44; we may say&#44; that if ever hope was well founded&#44; if ever
                confidence ought to visit the human breast&#44; it is the hope which we feel&#44; it
                is the confidence which animates us &#59; for we are promised by the prophet &#58;
                &#34; And the ransomed of the Lord shall return&#44; and come to Zion with loud
                songs of praise&#44; and everlasting joy shall crown their heads &#59; gladness and
                joy they shall obtain&#44; and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.&#34; Isaiah xxxv.

                the tears of the oppressed shall flow no more. May then the accepted year of the

                our existence. Many a one&#44; who in the bygone year was linked to a dear
                friend&#44; has seen this bond severed by the rude&#44; unsparing hand of death.
                &#8212; Many&#44; w T ho in the former days enjoyed the repose of luxury and

                on its verge. These are but a small portion of the changes&#44; which the past
                twelve months have witnessed&#44; and thus another revolution of the seasons has
                taught an awful lesson to the children of the dust&#44; and has admonished them&#44;
                to beware of clinging too closely to earthly things&#44; since they must so soon be
                wrested from the powerless grasp of the weak and fading mortal. &#34; Begun has the
                year.&#34; Again&#44; brethren&#44; the grace of God is dawning upon us&#44; who
                have by his mercy survived&#44; who have again been permitted to dwell for a while
                longer on earth&#44; who are yet left to be enabled to acquire a treasure in heaven
                by employ&#8211; ing the existence granted to us in deeds of active benevolence and
                energetic piety. &#8212; I said&#44; that the grace of God is dawning upon us&#59;
                for indeed&#44; breth&#8211; ren&#44; we are surrounded by light effulgent&#44; by
                the wisdom of an All&#8211;wise Creator&#44; by munificence un&#8211; bounded&#44;
                and by care unflagging&#44; and unwearied by continued exertion. And enough of grace
                has been granted us by God&#44; to render sickness supportable&#44; galling poverty
                not toilsome&#44; slaveiy and oppression tolerable&#44; nay death even an easy and
                an onward path to everlasting happiness. &#8212; Some may therefore be led to
                inquire&#44; &#34;Whence all the misery which afflicts the world&#63; whence all the
                calamities&#44; the horrors&#44; and the violence&#44; which desolate mankind&#44;
                if God is as good&#44; as we are told He is &#63;&#34; But reflec&#8211; tion will
                soon answer us&#44; that we ourselves are the cause of the manifold evil which
                exists &#59; for we are heedless of the divine light wdiich is beaming upon <pb

                would instruct us in the way of life&#59; and regardless of the bounty and
                munificence of God&#44; and unwilling to trust to his providential care&#44; we seek
                a way of our own&#44; inconsistent with the happiness of ourselves&#44; the welfare
                of others&#44; and displeasing and abhorrent to our Maker. And thus we draw
                punishment &#8212; the evil &#8212; down upon ourselves and others&#44; as a just
                rec&#8211; ompense for our misdeeds &#59; and crime and chastise&#8211; ment must
                follow each other&#44; since the same cause w T ill always produce a similar effect.
                And from the beginning of the presence of man on earth up to the present day&#44;
                this has been the uniform course of events&#44; and chastisement has ever followed
                in the footsteps of transgression &#59; and the Almighty has thus proved to an
                erring world&#44; that only in his favour there is happiness. &#8212; In the
                beginning peace reigned on earth&#44; when the work of creation was finished&#44;
                and in harmony all creatures lived with each other&#44; enjoying their
                existence&#44; as they proceeded perfect from the hand of their Maker. The lion
                rested in the forest along with the deer&#44; and between the tiger and the calf was
                peace&#44; and the lamb went unharmed by the wolf. But when Adam&#44; the father of
                our race&#44; ate of the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge&#44; all was
                changed &#8212; and discord followed the path of sin&#44; and it was not long before
                death lurked behind every shrub &#8212; before&#39;the winds were loaded with
                pestilence &#8212; before the clouds of heaven scattered destruction&#44; and&#42;
                the Hoods of the sea carried desolation in the force of their raging billows &#59;

                ever since&#59; through sin alone discord springs up&#59; and where the word of God
                is disregarded miseries are accumulating&#44; and ever and anon the terrible wrath
                of the Righteous Avenger is manifested in the judg&#8211; ment which He executes on
                sinners. But to punish is not the wish of the Merciful Ruler&#44; not to destroy is
                his pleasure&#59; He will instruct&#44; He will improve&#44; He will show bis
                children the way of life&#44; and by the pre&#8211; cepts of his wisdom He
                endeavours to lead them all into the sanctuary of unending happiness. Now this is
                the light of which we have spoken&#44; the grace&#44; the muniiicence&#44; and the
                care which we enjoy in our fallen state &#59; it is&#44; brethren&#44; the light of

                species&#44; and that he is accountable to Him for every act&#44; word&#44; and
                thought. In this class of duties we may reckon the laws relating to the
                festivals&#44; and the observances which are to be practised on the same&#44; since
                all of them&#44; as may be seen by an inspection of the holy law itself&#44; were to

                cere&#8211; mony on this particular day &#63; &#8212; To illustrate this com&#8211;
                mandment let us revert to the organization of our people&#44; and to the country
                whence our ancestors went forth. &#8212; We are&#44; as it is well known&#44;
                descended from Abraham the Hebrew&#44; and the country of our first or&#8211;
                ganization is Asia &#59; it was therefore so ordained by our Divine Legislator&#44;
                our God and Father&#44; to introduce such symbols and emblems into the framework of
                the law&#44; as were familiar to those who first received it&#59; and we have

                Abraham&#44; although so familiar&#44; presents&#44; nevertheless&#44; many very
                striking points for reflection&#44; from which par&#8211; ticularly we&#44; his
                descendants&#44; can draw useful and wise lessons&#59; and as the sacrifice of Isaac
                has an especial reference to the subject under consideration&#44; permit me to draw
                your attention to it&#44; as best fitted for to&#8211;day&#39;s reflection. &#8212;
                Abraham had seen the glory of his name spread among the children of the East&#59;
                his riches had increased to an immense extent&#44; and his wife Sarah had been&#44;
                blessed with the birth of the long&#8211;expected child &#59; and it may be
                said&#44; that in this way the whole series of promises made to the patri&#8211;
                arch were in a train of fulfilment. For&#44; prosperity had been promised&#44; and
                he was prosperous&#59; great&#8211; ness of name was his&#44; as God had
                foretold&#59; the child which Sarah was to bear had also been given &#59; and
                Abraham was thus established as the favourite of Heaven. The fair fame which he
                enjoyed had also confessedly not been lightly earned&#59; for his love of the
                Creator had been repeatedly tested&#44; and amidst all these trials he had not
                wavered&#44; nay&#44; his confi&#8211; dence had increased with every probation&#44;
                and the dispensations of Heaven&#44; and the persecution of men&#44; had never
                caused him to relax in his well&#8211;founded faith. But to crown all the sacrifices
                to principle and love to God hitherto made&#44; the last and severest was now
                demanded of him&#44; to prove that the man destined to be the father of a multitude
                of nations&#44; and of a people to be the depositary of God&#39;s holy covenant&#44;
                could offer up every thing to the Lord of heaven&#44; even the dearest hope of his
                heart&#44; and to comply with a mandate which&#44; to appearance&#44; threat&#8211;

                ever made to him&#59; that &#34; in Isaac his seed should be called.&#34; For the
                command had gone forth&#44; that he should take Isaac&#44; the only son&#44; the
                beloved&#44; the offspring of Sarah&#44; and sacrifice him on one of the mountains
                of the land of Moriah. Had Isaac now been actually sacrificed&#44; the promise just
                mentioned would have been broken &#59; and yet&#44; did Abraham ob&#8211; ject to
                this seemingly capricious order&#63; ~No&#44; on the contrary&#44; he obeyed
                cheerfully &#59; and armed with his usual confidence in the unwavering truth of
                God&#44; he thought&#44; that it was unbecoming in him who had re&#8211; ceived so
                many bounties at the hand of his Master to inquire after his unsearchable ways&#44;
                and he set forth on his perilous journey with the intended victim&#44; re&#8211;
                solved to fulfil the will of Heaven. The sacred spot is reached&#44; and behold
                them&#44; the father ready to sac&#8211; rifice his last hope&#44; and the son
                willing to become a burnt&#8211;offering on the altar of his Creator&#33; See on
                yonder eminence the altar is built &#59; the gray&#8211;headed patriarch arranges
                the wood &#59; he binds the yielding one&#59; and now behold the bright knife
                flashing over the. head of the victim&#44; and the sacrifice is almost fulfilled
                &#58; &#8212; when lo &#33; the outstretched hand is arrested by the messenger of
                Mercy&#44; for not the sacrifice it was that God desired&#44; but the readiness only
                to obey&#44; and here indeed had been exhibited an example of ready obedience&#44;
                which the ministering angels could not have surpassed&#59; and the intended
                sacrifice was stayed&#44; and the blessing of God was poured out over both&#44; and
                over their descendants after them. In the history of this occurrence&#44; we
                read&#44; that a ram was sacrificed in the place of Isaac &#59; this then will give
                    <pb n="274"/> 274 THE NEW YEAR. us an explanation of the verse of Leviticus
                xxiii. 25 &#58; &#34; On the first day of the seventh month shall be to you a day of
                rest&#44; of blowing of the cornet in remem&#8211; brance&#44;&#34; in
                remembrance&#44; namely&#44; of the sacrifice on Moriah of a ram instead of the
                devoted servant of God. And it is meet that at every new period in our existence
                especially the recollection of this mem&#8211; orable event should awaken in our
                hearts the no&#8211; blest sentiments of devotion. We should reflect that&#44; if
                Abraham was ready to devote his all&#44; the only son of his long&#8211;loved
                Sarah&#44; born to him at the age of a hundred years&#44; simply because he thought
                his God desired it&#44; we also should resolve to follow his ex&#8211; ample as far
                as lies within our power&#44; and to make daily those small sacrifices to
                principle&#44; which are de&#8211; manded of us in the service of Heaven.
                Abraham&#44; as we have seen&#44; was ready to yield the dearest posses&#8211;
                sion&#44; that which without a miracle could never have been restored&#59; how much
                more ought we to hasten to submit to any inconvenience in the discharge of our
                duties&#44; and to abstain from pleasures and pur&#8211; suits&#44; if they should
                militate in the least against our religious obligations. &#8212; Again&#44; we have
                the exhilarat&#8211; ing certainty&#44; exemplified in the history of our
                people&#44; that God blesses the child for the virtue of the par&#8211; ent&#59;
                what father&#44; then&#44; and what mother&#44; would not endeavour&#44; if they
                really love their offspring&#44; to se&#8211; cure them a legacy&#44; which all the
                ills of the world cannot dissipate &#59; a treasure&#44; which can never perish
                &#63; Let us&#44; therefore&#44; every year recal to mind the noble devotedness of
                the patriarchs&#44; and resolve to follow them in their virtue and implicit
                confidence in God&#59; and let us imagine that the spirits of the departed <pb

                city and the people not tremble &#63;&#34; &#8212; Brethren &#33; the shophar is not

                &#8212; Our life may be aptly compared to a road on which a stranger ventures in a
                foreign land. Onward he presses&#44; eager to reach his journey&#39;s end&#44; and
                heedless&#44; because unconscious&#44; of dangers which. still may beset him on all
                sides. Imagine him now on the brink of a precipice in a stormy and tempestu&#8211;

                are almost ready to curse the day that first opened to us an existence so full of

                led on by the cheering sound of comfort&#44; so richly scattered through the pages

                his people to throw every new&#8211;born male child of the Hebrews into the
                river&#59; but although his satellites carefully obeyed the ruthless decree&#44; the
                wife of Am&#8211; ram nevertheless succeeded in hiding her infant for a space of
                three months from the searching eye of the king&#39;s executioners. Three months she
                had thus spent in unceasing care and watching&#44; when she dis&#8211; covered to
                her sorrow&#44; that her home was no longer a place of safety for her innocent and
                tender offspring. Picture to yourselves the mother&#39;s grief&#44; when she was
                made conscious of the great&#44; the apparently in&#8211; evitable danger. Whither
                should she fly&#63; to whom should she look for protection &#63; Her own people&#44;

                listen to their entreaty&#59; nay&#44; he in&#8211; creased the burden of their
                labours&#44; when they prayed for an alleviation of their task. &#8212; But the

                hands of the Being who had confided him to her. She accordingly made a box of

                ter&#44; coming to bathe&#44; espied the box among the reeds&#44; and opening it she

                proscribed from his very birth&#44; she resolved to rescue him from death. &#8212;
                In short&#44; she adopted the child&#44; and called him Mo&#8211; sheh&#44; in
                commemoration of her having drawn&#42; him from the water &#59; and in the palace of
                the oppressor of his people the future messenger of Heaven passed the years of his
                infancy and early manhood. &#8212; Thus much for the early years of the chosen
                lawgiver &#59; and does it not strike you&#44; that his miraculous escape from a
                watery grave&#44; must have early impressed a mind like his with the conviction&#44;
                that there is a great and watchful Being ever regardful of whatever is done on
                earth&#63; that his own case must have taught him&#44; that the little no less than
                the great&#44; the humble and lowly no less than the proud and lofty are continually
                under the direction of an All&#8211; wise Supreme&#63; And in truth&#44; we should
                think&#44; that he was so impressed &#59; for we see in his early history that he
                opposed him&#8211; self to the cause of oppression&#44; although he had every thing
                to hope from it&#44; and nothing could be gained by favouring the suffering
                Israelites. &#8212; At length the time arrived&#44; when the fugitive Moses was to
                effect single&#8211;handed&#34;&#44; but armed with superior power&#44; the
                deliverance of his fellow&#8211;sufferers. He was feeding the flock of his
                wife&#39;s father in the wilderness&#44; when &#42; The word riE&#94;u

                thee to Pharaoh&#44; and thou shalt bring out my people of Israel out of Egypt.&#34;
                It was at the end of the period&#44; which had been set as the limit of the
                sufferings of our ancestors&#44; that Moses was com&#8211; missioned to lead them
                forth to the service of the Lord. He was&#44; therefore&#44; told to go to the king
                and tell him&#44; that the Eternal Lord of heaven and earth had appeared to him&#44;
                and had ordered him to demand the dismissal of his first&#8211;born son&#44; the
                children of Is&#8211; rael&#44; out of Egypt. &#8212; Moses went&#44; and spoke the
                words of the Lord before a despot&#44; who had made unto him&#8211; self a god&#44;
                who worshipped the water which he drank&#44; the ox who ploughed his field&#44; and
                the crocodile whose jaws destroyed many of his people. To him Moses spoke as God had
                told him &#59; but Pharaoh&#44; too confid&#8211; ing in his power&#44; too much
                corrupted by the flattery of his courtiers&#44; and too much emboldened by the
                submissiveness of his abject subjects&#44; said contempt&#8211; uously &#58; &#34;
                Who is the Eternal&#44; whose voice I shall obey to let Israel go&#63; I know not

                he was convinced&#44; that it is useless to endeavour to escape from the power of
                the Supreme. Signs and wonders were performed in his presence &#59; a staff thrown
                from the hands of Aaron became a serpent &#59; the water of the holy river of the
                Egyptians was changed into blood &#59; the clear stream produced frogs innumerable

                had shrouded the fair land of the sun for three days&#59; and yet Pharaoh relented
                not. Once&#44; indeed&#44; he ac&#8211; knowledged&#58; &#34;The Lord is
                righteous&#44; and I and my people are sinners&#59;&#34; but no sooner had the
                plague vanished&#44; than Pharaoh was like himself again&#59; he forgot the
                chastisement&#44; hardened his heart&#44; the flat&#8211; tery of his courtiers
                again induced him to look upon himself as the favoured son of his gods&#44; and in
                conse&#8211; quence&#44; he repeated his obduracy and sinned again. Here&#44; let me
                observe to you&#44; brethen&#44; that Pharaoh is not the only obdurate sinner&#44;
                who disregards the awful admonitions of Heaven. Even we&#44; ourselves&#44; are very
                often no better than the tyrant&#44; whose deeds we all denounce as cruel and
                oppressive&#44; and whom we all adjudge to have been rightly punished. Look&#44; I
                pray you&#44; at some passages of your life&#44; none of us is perfect&#44; for we
                all have sinned&#44; we all have trans&#8211; gressed against the laws of God&#44;
                and reflect&#44; how it occasionally happened&#44; that some unexpected check was
                given to your course &#59; how you at first were somewhat startled at the
                singularity of God&#39;s judg&#8211; ment against you &#59; but how you afterwards
                suffered the impression to wear off&#44; which the solemn and
                well&#8211;intendect&#34; warning had at first produced. It is even so &#59; our

                blindfolded&#44; and consequently having explained every circumstance of the strange
                occurrence to our satisfaction&#44; we sin anew&#44; and heap wilful
                transgres&#8211; sion upon our former trespasses. &#8212; The same was the case with
                the king of Egypt. He had all along con&#8211; ceived that his conduct towards the
                Israelites was just and right&#59; for&#44; thought he&#58; &#34;Shall my
                slaves&#44; those I have received as such from my predecessor&#44; go free&#44;
                without ransom&#63; they now build my towns&#44; they now labour for me in the
                field&#44; they now dig my canals &#59; and whence shall I obtain compensation for
                their loss&#63; No&#44; Israel shall not go free&#33;&#34; And as each plague had
                passed away&#44; and as soon as the pun&#8211; ishment was removed&#44; he
                attributed it to accident&#44; to some chance&#44; which he to be sure could not
                account for&#44; but which he yet did not believe to be a manifes&#8211; tation of
                the power of the Deity&#44; a Deity too&#44; whom neither he nor his ancestors
                acknowledged. &#8212; His ser&#8211; vants also lent their aid to inspire him with
                resistance. They had been accustomed to follow him implicitly&#59; to hear with them
                was to obey &#59; they&#44; therefore&#44; did not&#44; durst not&#44; advise him to
                yield&#44; and they even ap&#8211; plauded his acts&#44; as ive are told in
                Scriptures&#44; &#34;and Pharaoh hardened his heart&#44; he himself as well as his
                servants&#59;&#34; and then&#44; it must be considered&#44; that the Egyptians
                themselves were individually benefitted by the labours of the Israelites&#44; as
                well as the state. &#8212; Thus&#44; then&#44; Pharaoh resisted the ten times
                repeated warning and miraculous manifestation &#59; but now the time had
                arrived&#44; when longer disobedience was ren&#8211; dered impossible&#44; when by

                midst of Egypt&#44; when every first&#8211;born in the land of Egypt shall die&#44;
                from the first&#8211;born of Pharaoh&#44; who is to sit on his throne&#44; to the

                first&#8211;born of cattle.&#34; These are the words of the terrible denun&#8211;
                ciation. Pharaoh might have averted the blow&#44; which was to reach him no less
                than the meanest of his peo&#8211; ple&#44; by a timely compliance with the
                righteous de&#8211; mand &#59; but he would not listen&#44; and so the vengeance of
                the Lord took its course. It was at the dead hour of midnight &#59; it was in the
                night of the fifteenth of the first month&#59; it was whilst the Israelites were
                celebrating their first festival of redemption &#59; it was whilst the Egyptians
                rested as they thought&#44; securely in their beds&#44; that the destroyer walked
                forth in the land. It was as though a blighting dew had fallen in every house&#44;
                so instantaneous was the destruction&#59; in every palace&#44; in every house&#44;
                in every hovel&#44; in every prison there was death&#44; the young dropped down in
                the midst perhaps of the nightly revel&#44; and the aged lay&#44; as it were&#44;
                strangled on their couches. &#8212; And the king &#8212; he beheld his eldest son
                expiring at his feet&#44; the son who&#44; as he had hoped&#44; would have succeeded
                to&#44; his kingdom&#44; even he was cut off&#59; nay&#44; the cattle&#44; which the
                Egyptians worshipped&#44; perished&#44; and the images&#44; which they had set up
                for contem&#8211; plation&#44; for auguries or worship&#44; were hurled from their
                stands&#44; and they crumbled into dust before the mighty Hand that was outstretched

                ruined&#44; became irresistible&#59; and the obdu&#8211; rate king himself hastened
                to seek out Moses&#44; to bid him leave Egypt instantly&#44; together with the
                people of Israel. &#8212; Thus was the liberty of our people ob&#8211; tained &#59;

                unleavened bread&#44; the bread of poverty &#59; for in haste thou didst go out of
                Egypt&#44; for the sa&#39;ke that thou mayest remember the day of thy going out of
                the land of Egypt&#44; all the days of thy life.&#34; This&#44; brethren&#44;
                then&#44; is the reason of our being here this day&#44; and this is the cause of our
                abstaining from every thing which is leavened during the Passover. If the stranger
                now&#44; and our children&#44; who are as yet unacquainted with the wonderful deeds
                of the Lord&#44; which He wrought for us in olden times&#44; ask&#58; &#34;Why is
                this service &#63;&#34; we should answer&#44; that it is to re&#8211; mind us of the
                abundant mercies of which we all participated &#59; &#8211;for if it had not pleased
                the Almighty &#40;to adopt the language of our service&#41; to redeem our ancestors
                from Egypt&#44; then we and our children&#44; and our children&#39;s children would
                even to this day have been slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt. And an event like this is
                surely deserving of the most solemn commem&#8211; oration. Look upon the state of
                the world at the time of the Exodus. Idolatry rested like an incubus upon all
                mankind&#59; .the faculties of reasoning beings were blunted by gross superstition
                &#59; and had God not raised up to himself a people&#44; and gifted them with better
                statutes and more sublime conceptions of himself&#44; what&#44; I ask&#44; would
                have been for all ages the condi&#8211; tion of the children of Adam &#63; It is
                futile to assert&#44; that the progressive development of reason would have effected
                a&#94;reformation&#44; when we plainly see&#44; that the enlightenment of man had
                gradually deteriorated&#44; until he had become&#44; as said already&#44; the
                benighted idolater. Suppose now&#44; this state had continued to this period of
                time&#44; to this age&#44; which we are so apt to call enlightened&#58; is it to be
                believed&#44; that human vol. i. 25 <pb n="290"/> 290 THE PASSOVER. reason could
                have progressed&#44; unless an event similar to the miraculous deliverance of the
                Israelites had taken place&#63; And in truth&#44; this event was in itself
                sufficient to regenerate the world. First&#44; it was the dawning of freedom for
                every member of the human family&#44; since it is the first on record of the unjust
                power of tyranny broken &#59; and&#44; secondly&#44; it was the commencement of a
                new era in the disenthralment of the mind&#44; since it was then that the light was
                first kindled&#44; which has burned ever since with untar&#8211; nished lustre&#44;
                and which must ultimately beam with redoubled splendour upon every soul&#59; which
                must at last bring every existing reasoning being within the fold of our God&#39;s
                pasturage&#44; and make all nations only as so many members of the same family&#44;
                united by one common tie of unity of interest and uniformity of worship. &#8212;
                This is the event we celebrate&#44; a two&#8211; fold deliverance&#44; of mind and
                body&#44; not alone for ourselves&#44; but also for all who like us derive their
                parentage from the founder of the human race. &#8212; Let us then reflect seriously
                upon the cause of this festival&#44; and let us in truth&#44; according to the
                dictates of the law&#44; remember the day of our going out of Egypt all the days of
                our life &#59; since it was not merely the humbling of Pharaoh&#44; but also the
                regeneration of the whole world which was effected thereby. &#8212; In return for
                this great favour we can render the Al&#8211; mighty nothing but a virtuous
                conduct&#59; for&#39; to Him all the acts of man can be of no importance&#44;
                &#40;since they cannot affect his beatitude&#44;&#41; except when they&#44; in
                accordance with his will&#44; promote their own hap&#8211; piness. He wills our
                happiness only &#59; our deeds can neither hurt nor benefit Him&#44; as He is

                therefore&#44; the recurrence of the Passover animate us to a re&#8211; newal of our
                attachment to our God&#39;s holy precepts&#59; let us all join our hearts&#44; our
                hands&#44; our simultane&#8211; ous efforts&#44; to prove to all&#44; that we
                Israelites are not ungrateful for all the goodness we have received&#44; and are
                even yet receiving&#44; although no longer united under one paternal government. Let
                us forget all trifling differences&#44; let every man forgive the sins committed
                against him by his neighbour&#59; but let the proud oppressor of the poor&#44; and
                the hard&#8211;hearted avaricious man&#44; who both look upon the distresses of
                their fellow&#8211;beings with indifference&#44; let them&#44; I say&#44;
                reflect&#44; that retribution will come&#44; when they will find&#44; that neither
                power nor wealth will shield them against God&#39;s almighty power &#59; for He who
                punished Pharaoh and the guilty Egyptians&#44; can even now smite the sinner&#44; no
                matter how deeply he may lie conceal&#8211; ed&#44; no matter how much he may have
                fortified him&#8211; self by silencing his conscience&#44; no matter how loug the
                trespass is past&#44; and he vainly dreams his acts lie buried in oblivion. &#8212;
                In fine&#44; the admonition so often repeated in the Pentateuch &#58; &#34;
                Remember&#44; that thou hast been a slave in Egpyt&#44;&#34; should remind us of the
                debt of gratitude we owe to God&#44; and this reminding us should induce us also to
                love Him who has been so gracious &#59;&#94; so that we maybe rendered good and
                pious&#44; and worthy of bliss in this life&#44; and of happi&#8211; ness hereafter.
                May the grace of the Lord always surround us. Amen &#33; Nissan 13th. &#124; 5592

                of Israel&#44; who so often has displayed his glory and goodness toward his
                children&#44; be praise and glory for everlasting. Amen. Brethren &#33; In my late
                address on the occasion of the Passover I adverted briefly to the wonders which the
                Almighty displayed in Egypt&#44; and to the miracles and fearful deeds by which He
                brought about the enlargement of our ancestors from cruel bondage. This was
                in&#8211; deed an act of grace&#44; for which our everlasting thanks should ever be
                cheerfully rendered to Him who proved himself so good to the afflicted &#59; who
                listened to us when nothing attainable through human energy was able to assist
                us&#44; and who broke the bonds which cen&#8211; turies of oppression&#44; aided by
                the ingenious devices which cunning and cruelty had invented&#44; had well&#8211;
                niffh rendered irresistible. &#8212; But with all these won&#8211; derful acts the
                deliverance was yet left incomplete. The Israelites&#44; as they came from
                Egypt&#44; were tainted with all the vices and superstitions of their late
                task&#8211; masters&#44; so at least Ave should judge from the tenor of the
                Bible&#8211;history &#59; and they were therefore unfit to be called the people of
                God&#44; since nothing distinguished them from the nations of the earth&#44; save
                their descent from the patriarchs&#44; the original worshippers of the <pb n="293"/>

                fit subjects for God&#39;s empire&#44; it pleased Him&#44; their Father and the
                Father of all the world&#44; to come and instruct them himself&#44; for the purpose
                that they might know what was pleasing to Him&#44; and that by acting according to
                their newly acquired knowledge&#44; they might live as becomes the children of God.
                &#8212; The Lord&#8211; himself came to instruct the Is&#8211; raelites&#33; How

                himself&#44; although raised beyond the reach of our most elevated concep&#8211;
                tions&#44; greater far than the most daring flight of fancy can paint Him&#44;
                &#8212; He&#44; I say&#44; condescended to instruct in love the children of the
                dust&#44; whose life is like the fleeting shadow&#59; whose deeds are to Him as
                though they had not been &#59; and whose existence is derived from Him &#33; Ay&#44;
                even as a father teaches his son&#44; as openly as the mother speaks to her

                condescension is inseparably interwoven with unlimited greatness &#33; Yet if we

                Him &#59; how He is contained in nothing&#44; but all is contained in Him &#58; we
                shall &#39;cease to wonder&#44; and not deem the descent on Sinai&#44; which we
                celebrate this day&#44; as an act unworthy of the dig&#8211; nity of the Deity. He

                of the path of right&#8211; eousness &#63; &#8212; If&#44; then&#44; our opponents
                sneeringly ask us&#44; if we can be serious in believing in a direct revelation of
                an especial code of laws&#44; we will answer them&#58; The God who created man&#44;
                endowed him with a body&#44; so far superior to that of any other animal&#59; who
                caused him to walk erect&#44; that he with uplifted eyes might contemplate the
                expansion of yon firmament&#44; glitter&#8211; ing by day with the brilliant light
                of the sun&#44; and by night illumined by the silvery moon&#44; and the myri&#8211;
                ads of sparkling stars&#44; the suns of other systems&#59; and who&#44; to sum up
                all&#44; has bestowed on him an intelli&#8211; gent mind&#44; a living soul&#44; and
                a thinking spirit&#44; the like of which nothing earthly does possess&#58; can He
                not&#44; if so He wills&#44; speak audibly to the ear&#44; and through it to the
                mind&#44; those things which He may believe to be of general and permanent benefit
                &#63; His ability then cannot be denied&#44; and that He has actu &#58; ally done so
                is clearly proved&#44; by the fact&#44; that the ten commandments&#44; promulgated
                to an astonished world for the first time on this day&#44; in the year of the
                world&#44; according to our computation&#44; 2448&#44; are yet in existence&#44; are
                yet known&#44; read and acknowledged&#59; and no code&#44; which ever was

                Look to the laws of Babylon&#44; their memory is forgotten&#59; inquire for the
                statutes of Greece and Rome&#44; and they are no more obeyed &#59; for all were the
                work of men bent only upon their own aggrandizement&#59; whereas our laws&#44;
                founded upon the wisdom of God&#44; are as new this day&#44; as dear to the heart of
                the lover of his species&#44; as much the established code of our nation&#44; as on
                that day when our adoring ancestors stood at the foot of Sinai &#33; &#8212; Another
                evidence of the divine origin of the Decalogue can be found therein&#44; that it has
                never been improved upon since it was first given &#59; for what but divine Wisdom
                could be so perfect&#44; what but not being derived from human experience&#44; can
                render any thing free from the taint of human work &#8212; imperfection&#63; &#8212;
                But let me stop here&#59; to pronounce a eulogium upon the wisdom of God would ill
                be&#8211; come a fallible&#44; ignorant mortal &#59; for none but God himself can
                know the extent of good which has been and ever must be derived from the laws which
                He himself made known &#33; &#8212; Therefore&#44; let our silence be praise &#59;
                let our inability to express our admiration be the evidence of the depth of our
                feelings&#44; since we can never say enough&#44; even though the most elo&#8211;
                quent were for ever to expatiate upon the theme&#44; and exhaust the richest stores
                of language. Yet the heart must clothe itself in words&#44; or else all
                communication of ideas between man and man would become impos&#8211; sible&#59; so
                then&#44; whatever we express of feeling and of gratitude should always be taken as
                the tribute of the heart of the thinking to animate through example and precept
                those who surround him to an equal or superior share of piety and veneration to God
                &#59; and <pb n="296"/> 296 THE PENTECOST. to induce them&#44; by an exposition of
                the excellencies of the holy Torah&#44; to follow the precepts therein con&#8211;
                tained. &#8212; Having premised these views&#44; let us proceed to the consideration
                of the following verse from the portion we read to&#8211;day&#58; &#34;And now&#44;
                if you will hearken to my voice and observe my covenant&#44; you shall be to me the
                most beloyed of all nations &#59; for all the earth is mine &#59; and you shall be
                to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt
                speak to the children of Israel.&#34; &#40;Exodus xix. 5&#8211;6.&#41; The Almighty
                had visited our parents in Egypt&#44; and had seen them oppressed by slavery&#44;
                and sunk in ignorance and idolatry. They were the descend&#8211; ants of
                Abraham&#44; to whom God had promised&#44; that as soon as the servitude to which
                his children had been destined should have continued till the end of the limited
                period&#44; they should be redeemed. In consequence of this promise&#44; the
                oppressors of the Israelites were by degrees brought to relent of their cruelty&#44;
                and at length to dismiss them&#44; loaded with riches&#59; and thus&#44; as it
                were&#44; the Almighty had bought them for his servants&#44; since through his
                powerful in&#8211; tervention alone their deliverance from thraldom had been
                effected. It was then that they went forth into the wilderness of Arabia&#44; led
                through trackless deso&#8211; lation by the protection of God&#44; under guidance of
                his chosen servant. The Egyptians soon repented <pb n="297"/> THE PENTECOST. 297 of
                their having dismissed the Israelites&#44; and pursued them to the shores of the Red
                Sea&#59; and here again the arm of God interposed &#59; He caused the children of
                Jacob to pass through the divided waters&#44; and sunk the pursuing host of Pharaoh
                amidst the return&#8211; ing billows. At length the redeemed arrived at the foot of
                Sinai&#44; in the third month of their redemption&#44; and halted there by the
                command of God. This was the spot of their present destination&#44; for it was here
                the Israelites were to worship the Eternal Father&#44; upon their going out of
                Egypt&#44; as Moses had been promised. All&#44; indeed&#44; conspired to render the
                pres&#8211; ent moment and the present spot the best adapted to impress feelings of
                awe and veneration upon their minds. For as to the time&#44; it followed immediately
                upon the many miraculous benefits heaped upon them&#44; which to deserve they could
                have done nothing&#59; and to do aught in return for them must have appeared to them
                even&#44; uninstructed as they were&#44; utterly in&#8211; conceivable&#44; as they
                must have early enough dis&#8211; covered&#44; that the Being&#44; who had wrought
                so many things in their favour&#44; was One&#44; to repay whom with benefits was
                impossible. And as to the spot&#44; it was then&#44; and is now as travellers
                tell&#44; a beautiful moun&#8211; tain&#44; with various peaks&#44; one rising above
                the other&#44; its sides covered with verdure in the midst of a fright&#8211; ful
                and barren desert&#59; and in a country where there is no water to refresh the
                thirsty traveller stands Mount Horeb&#44; blessed with a cooling spring. It
                ap&#8211; pears as though it were a temple consecrated to the God of

                    <pb n="298"/> 298 THE PENTECOST. has almost yielded all hope of being saved from
                the perils of his pathless journey. So then the time of the promulgation of the law
                was the period when the Israelites had been practically taught&#44; that the
                All&#8211; ruling One is capable to convert the greatest calamity into
                blessings&#59; who could raise the humblest to a proud eminence&#59; who could
                punish the obdurate sinner with punishment beyond the regular course of nature &#59;
                and who watches over all&#44; the great and the humble&#44; the rich and the
                poor&#44; with the same pater&#8211; nal solicitude. This moment&#44; we should
                judge&#44; must have found the whole congregation in a temper of mind to inspire
                them with gratitude to their heavenly Benefactor&#44; and their own feelings must
                have induced them to prove their gratitude by their conduct. Be&#8211; hold
                them&#44; then&#44; encamped at the foot of the beauti&#8211; ful Mount Sinai&#44;
                at that green island amidst an ocean of sand &#59; behold Moses&#44; who had
                hitherto been with the people&#44; called by a voice of an unseen speaker to come up
                the mount&#44; and imagine the feelings of all his followers at seeing him obey the
                mysterious call. Anon he appears to listen in breathless attention to an unseen
                mouth and an unheard voice&#44; and at length he descends again to the camp. The
                Israelites had been told&#44; that on this spot they should serve God the Lord &#59;
                his service had hitherto&#8211; been entirely un&#8211; known to them&#44; and they
                knew not&#44; if the frightful worship of the heathen idols&#44; where human
                sacrifices bleed on the altar&#44; where the yet trembling heart of the immolated
                victim is drawn from the living bosom&#44; where the innocent nursling is laid upon
                the heated arms of Moloch&#39;s image&#44; &#8212; they knew not&#44; I say&#44; if

                299 same horrors&#44; unused as they were to any other wor&#8211; ship. &#8212; But
                no&#44; Moses came not with a message of abominations&#44; he spoke not the words of
                a wrathful but of a beneficent Being&#59; and thus he spoke in the name of Him who
                had sent him &#58; &#34; You have seen what I have done to Egypt&#44; and how I have
                borne you upon eagles&#39; wings&#44; and brought you to me &#59; and now&#44; if
                you will hearken to my voice&#44; and observe my covenant&#44; you shall be to me
                the most beloved of all nations &#59; for all the earth is mine &#59; and you shall
                be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&#34; In this first announcement
                was distinctly contained the whole subject of the intercourse&#44; if I may use the
                terms&#44; between God and the Israelites. He first states how He had been their
                benefactor&#44; and how great the redemption had been&#44; which He had vouchsafed
                to bestow on them. Next&#44; how He had protected them&#44; as the eagle covers with
                her body her young brood&#44; from the sword of the Egyptian pursuers and the
                Amalekite army&#59; how He had provided them with bread in a land where there is no
                sowing&#44; and how He had caused the water to flow from the hard rock to quench
                their thirst. And for what had all this great goodness been bestowed &#63; to
                aggrandize God&#39;s power &#63; No &#59; his power is unlimited&#44; and can
                there&#8211; fore not be made greater. What then was the object of all this&#63; 4
                Solely to introduce amongst mankind a purer worship than the various modes and
                species of idolatry then prevalent&#44; and to re&#8211;establish on a firmer&#44;
                and never to&#8211;be&#8211;shaken&#44; footing&#44; the covenant which He had made
                with Abraham &#33; &#8212; &#34; I have borne you upon eagles&#39; wings&#44; and
                brought you to me&#44;&#34; says <pb n="300"/> 300 THE PENTECOST. God&#59; &#34; I
                have done all this for your own benefit&#44; from no motives of enlarging my
                kingdom&#44; for all the earth is mine &#59; wherever I turn my view&#44; every
                thing stands ready to my will&#59; the angels of purity&#44; to whom no carnal
                desire is known&#44; are my servants&#59; the sun in his course must obey my mandate
                &#59; the moon in her orbit is ready to stop in her career at my bidding &#59; do I
                speak&#44; the waters of the vasty ocean are divided and show their deepest chasm
                &#59; and do I but will&#44; the devouring pestilence strides abroad&#44; and slays
                the children of men&#59; and at my nod all nature will return to a chaotic
                state&#44; and life and death&#44; spirit and matter&#44; and fire and water&#44;
                become mixed up in one wide mass of confusion and desolation. But all I desire is to
                bring you to me&#44; meaning&#58; It is my will to rear you as a people devoted to
                my service. You I have selected. Long you sighed in hopeless ser&#8211; vitude&#59;
                where were the gods of Egypt&#44; whom you used to regard with veneration&#63; And
                when I at length stood forth to relieve you&#44; where was again the power of
                Egypt&#39;s idols to stay my poiver&#63; Thus have I endeavoured to impress on your
                minds my greatness and my glory&#44; and thus prepared&#44; you are of all nations
                the one best calculated to receive my law&#44; and to become as it were members in a
                covenant with me.&#34; In this manner were the Israelites to re&#8211; pay the many
                blessings showered upon them&#44; they were in this address of God called on to
                adopt his kingdom&#44; they should henceforward obey Him as their chief ruler&#59;
                He would be their Legislator&#44; their King&#44; and Protector&#44; and they should
                only obey the laws which He would prescribe. &#8212; Thus also says the message&#58;
                &#34;You shall be a kingdom of priests <pb n="301"/> THE PENTECOST. 301 meaning&#44;
                every person of the congregation by obedi&#8211; ence to God&#39;s will would render
                himself as a priest&#44; administering before the sanctuary of the Lord. In the
                outward worship&#44; in the service of the temple and Synagogue&#44; not every one
                can be a minister&#59; for not every one can by previous education be qualified&#44;
                nor if the whole body of mankind were so qualified could they all simultaneously act
                as ministers. But in the worship of the heart&#44; in adoration of the Supreme&#44;
                in obedience to the law&#44; in charity and benevolence&#44; in purity of soul&#44;
                and in a devout spirit&#44; all can join&#44; simultaneously and perpetually. Virtue
                and fear of God are not qualities inherent to station&#44; age&#44; or sex&#59; but
                the whole mass of men are here capable of join&#8211; ing&#44; since virtue is so
                extensive in its operations&#44; that there is field enough for every one to act in
                righteous&#8211; ness. Nay more&#44; the more virtuous deeds are com&#8211;
                mitted&#44; the farther will the sphere of their operation be extended&#44; since
                the mass of iniquity is thereby diminished&#44; and that of useful piety extended.
                Thus can every one be as a priest&#44; and the whole Israelitish nation be a kingdom
                of priests&#44; when all endeavour to lead a holy life&#44; that is to say&#44; when
                all by a simul&#8211; taneous effort to act correctly contribute whatever is in
                their power&#44; &#8212; be it little&#44; be it much&#44; &#8212; to act vir&#8211;
                tuously themselves&#44; and induce others to do likewise. &#8212; For this beijig
                holy they were promised the imme&#8211; diate favour of God&#44; in fact&#44; a
                continuation of the mercies which they had received already. &#8212; The terms of
                the covenant were soon made known to them&#59; for on the third day the Lord
                descended in his awful glory&#44; and proclaimed to the Israelites his will. And
                what willed He &#63; were his laws those of inhumanity vol. i. 26 <pb n="302"/> 302
                THE PENTECOST. and ferocity&#63; was his yoke too severe a burden&#63; £To&#59; He
                commanded only the observance of a pure wor&#8211; ship&#44; where reason and not
                ignorance was to lead the people. In place of a multitude of adored beings or ideas.
                He placed before our parents the idea of One Maker&#44; Ruler&#44; and Preserver of
                all things. &#8212; In place of unmitigated service&#44; He commanded that one day
                in the week every man&#44; even the slave&#44; should cease from labour&#44; and
                thus celebrate the creation of all by the One Creator &#33; &#8212; In place of
                barbarities&#44; of mur&#8211; ders&#44; theft&#44; and false&#8211;swearing&#44;
                and duplicity&#44; He com&#8211; manded that whatever a man was possessed of should
                be inviolably his&#44; and was not to be taken from him&#44; except by a just&#44;
                impartial&#44; and as far as possible mer&#8211; ciful judicial verdict. In
                fine&#44; the foundation of the covenant is reason the most refined&#44; &#8212; its
                object hu&#8211; manity and peace. It was for this end that the Isra&#8211; elites
                had been redeemed from bondage&#44; that they&#44; moved by gratitude and separated
                from intercourse with the rest of sunken and degraded mankind&#44; might be induced
                cheerfully to adopt a wise and beneficent code of laws devised by the Supreme
                Wisdom&#33; &#8212; How those laws have acted&#44; how many and innumer&#8211; able

                will not now advert to&#44; as this subject would lead me too far&#44; even if I
                could hope to place it in a light becoming its importance before you. However&#44;
                every one of you can institute an estimate .for himself by merely taking a survey of
                the history of our people and that of any of the heathen nations. Weak in

                wars and persecutions from enemies&#44; we are yet left a proud monument of
                God&#39;s greatness and wisdom. Powerful in numbers&#44; and conquering in war&#44;
                our oppressors have passed away&#44; and perhaps some blackened ruins are nearly all
                that is left to tell&#58; &#34; Here is the grave of a powerful&#44; a wise&#44; and

                animate us to observe the terms of the covenant un&#8211; der which alone we can
                prosper &#33; I speak advisedly&#44; under the terms of the covenant alone we can

                were&#44; degraded amongst men&#44; and strangers to the pure religion of God. But

                the annual recurrence of some joyful period of deliverance are we assembled this day
                &#59; but to call&#44; as it were&#44; more unanimously than each individual can do
                by himself&#44; upon the God of our destinies for an exemption of the dreadful
                scourge&#44; which has been for fifteen years spreading desolation in its way&#44;
                and has at length burst with fearful vio&#8211; lence over our city&#44; together
                with many other towns in this hitherto favoured hemisphere. We have for a time been
                indulged to behold from afar the pun&#8211; ishment which was sent down upon distant
                lands&#59; already we imagined&#44; that here&#44; at so great a distance&#44; we
                should be safe. But&#44; alas&#33; the storm&#44; which has been gathering for so
                long a period&#44; has burst upon us in all its awful gloom&#44; with all the
                suddenness of the lightning&#59; and they who deem themselves secure in the joy of
                health and life&#44; are thrown upon the bed of wo&#44; and before human aid can
                commence its battle with death&#44; the spirit has flown&#44; and is snatched from
                this earth&#44; and its cares&#44; and its enjoyments. During the progress of this
                pestilence a rare&#44; per&#8211; haps an unexampled&#44; spectacle has presented
                itself to our view. Nations&#44; those near and those far from the native soil of
                the dreaded disease&#44; have endeav&#8211; oured&#44; by non&#8211;intercourse and
                other precautionary <pb n="308"/> 308 THE VISITATION OF HEAVEN. measures&#44; to
                prevent its introduction into their lands&#44; so that it appeared that&#44; if
                human power could do aught in averting the chastisement&#44; it would have been
                accomplished. But no&#44; how vigilant soever the watchmen were&#44; they had not
                the aid of God with them&#44; and &#34;vain is the watchman&#39;s vigilance&#44; if
                the Lord guardeth not the city&#59;&#34; and individuals who fled from infected
                places&#44; thinking to escape by dis&#8211; tance the death they dreaded at
                home&#44; met it in the solitude of the mountain&#44; the seclusion of the
                forest&#44; and upon the stormy billows of the ocean. And if ever
                Scripture&#8211;truth was verified&#44; the history of the cholera has done it as
                much as any event of which we have heard in profane story. I allude to the
                splen&#8211; did description of God&#39;s omnipresence contained in the one hundred
                and thirty&#8211;ninth Psalm of David&#44; where the holy singer thus speaks in the
                fulness of his heart&#58; &#34;0 Eternal One&#44; Thou hast searched me&#44; and
                Thou knowest me&#59; do I sit&#44; do I rise&#44; it is known to Thee&#59; already
                afar Thou probest my thoughts&#44; my walk and my couch Thou hast measured for
                me&#44; and prepared all my ways. Before yet a word&#44; was upon my tongue&#44;
                Thou&#44; Lord&#33; didst know all&#33; &#8212; Whither shall I go from thy
                spirit&#63; and whither shall I flee from thy face&#63; If I ascend to heaven&#44;
                Thou art there&#44; and if I should lie down in the abyss&#44; I should find Thee
                there &#33; Should I fly on the wings of the morn&#8211; ing&#8211;dawn&#44; to
                dwell at the farthest end of the sea&#58; even there thy hand would lead me&#44; and
                thy right hand would seize me&#59;&#39; If I should say&#44; Darkness shall surround
                me &#33; then night even would become light around me&#59; for darkness cannot

                It is this cer&#8211; tainty of the entire inefficacy of human agency which has
                caused us this day to meet here at the house of God&#44; to ask of Him an especial
                redemption from the devouring pestilence which now afflicts us&#59; us&#44; I
                say&#44; for although we may as yet he free from sickness&#44; we know not how soon
                our turn may come &#59; and are we not afflicted&#44; when we are conscious that so
                many of our fellow&#8211;mortais are at this very moment groaning and sinking under
                affliction&#44; which no human vigour can long sustain&#63; Let us&#44; then&#44;
                understand the na&#8211; ture of our appeal to the Deity&#44; and let us see if this
                appeal should not have an especial effect upon our&#8211; selves&#44; before we can
                expect to have our prayers an&#8211; swered from Heaven. As in all
                investigations&#44; relat&#8211; ing to our private as well as our public life&#44;
                we ought to search the Bible for instruction and reference&#44; let us adopt this
                religious course also in the present in&#8211; stance. In the Bible we are told&#44;
                that whenever affliction befals us&#44; as soon as we find that our even path of
                existence becomes ruffled &#58; we should turn our attention for succour to the
                Source of all good&#8211; ness&#44; and commence a rigid inquiry into our own
                conduct&#44; so that&#44; if we have acted amiss&#44; we may be&#8211; gin to
                correct our errors&#44; before we can with confi&#8211; dence look for a change in
                our misfortunes. And thus says Solomon in the prayer which he pronounced before all
                Israel at the time of the consecration of the temple which he had built for the
                worship of God&#58; &#34;When thy people Israel are smitten down before an
                enemy&#44; because they have sinned against Thee&#44; and shall turn again to
                Thee&#44; and confess thy name&#44; and pray and make supplication unto Thee in <pb
                    n="310"/> 310 THE VISITATION OF HEAVEN. this house&#58; then hear Thou in
                heaven&#44; and forgive the sin of thy people Israel&#44; and bring them again unto
                the land which Thou hast on ven to their fathers. &#8212; When the heaven is shut up
                and there is no rain&#44; be&#8211; cause they have sinned against Thee &#59; if
                then they pray towards this place&#44; and confess thy name&#44; and turn from their
                sin&#44; when Thou afflictest them &#58; then hear Thou in heaven&#44; and forgive
                the sin of thy ser&#8211; vants&#44; and of thy people Israel &#59; for Thou wilt
                teach them the good way wherein they should walk&#44; and give rain upon thy land
                which Thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance. &#8212; If there be famine
                in the land&#44; if there be pestilence&#44; blasting&#44; mildew&#44; locusts&#44;
                or if there be caterpillars&#59; if their enemy be&#8211; siege them in the land of
                their cities&#44; whatsoever plague or sickness there be&#59; what prayer and
                supplica&#8211; tion soever be made by any man&#44; or by all thy people Israel&#44;
                who shall know every man the plague of his heart&#44; and spread forth his hands
                towards this house &#58; then hear Thou in heaven&#44; thy dwelling&#8211;place&#44;
                and forgive&#44; and do&#44; and give to every man according to his ways&#44; whose
                heart thou knowest &#40;for Thou&#44; even Thou only&#44; knowest the hearts of all
                children of men&#41;&#44; that they may fear Thee all the days that they live in the
                land which Thou s&#94;avest unto our fathers.&#34; &#8212; Here&#44; brethren&#44;
                we have a proper exposition of the nature of prayer&#44; and of the objects for
                which all pun&#8211; ishment is sent on earth. &#8212; You will have observed
                already&#44; that in many parts of the Bible temporal punishments are uniformly
                threatened as a necessary consequence of dereliction from religious duties. Now&#44;
                some may ask&#58; &#34; Why did Moses not say&#44; that if you &#40;the
                Israelites&#41; will not obey the laws I have <pb n="311"/> THE VISITATION OF
                HEAVEN. 311 laid before you&#44; you shall be punished after death&#44; and specify
                the various degrees of punishment then to be inflicted&#63;&#34; To this we should
                answer&#58; that both this life and the life everlasting are the creation of the
                same truly infinite Being. But man in his human existence&#44; by which I would
                understand his sojourn on earth&#44; is&#44; as said on a former occasion&#44; a
                compound of the finite and infinite &#59; finite in so far as his body is composed
                of material substances &#59; in&#8211; finite&#44; or at least what our
                understanding will dis&#8211; tinguish by this appellation&#44; in as far as his
                soul does not partake of the nature of matter. £Tow let it be observed&#44; that in
                this state of being all ideas conveyed to our mind are&#39;borrowed in their forms
                and extent from the natural world. Thus are our joys always founded upon grounds
                which afford us pleasure&#44; profit&#44; or renown&#44; things in themselves
                positive&#44; or considered so by universal consent. And then&#44; also&#44; our
                grief is derived from causes which yield pain&#44; infamy&#44; poverty&#44; or
                contempt. Perhaps&#44; there may be found by an inquirer some more diversified and
                more minute descriptions of feelings&#59; but for our present purpose it is enough
                to adopt merely the fore&#8211; going positions&#44; without entering into a complex
                de&#8211; finition of the operations of our mind. &#8212; The truth of these
                positions is too self&#8211;evident to stand in need of argument&#44; and let
                us&#44; therefore&#44; proceed to apply them to the &#8211;subject of our
                to&#8211;day&#39;s consideration. &#8212; Pains and pleasures of this life are
                positive&#44; that is to say&#44; we can either count&#44; measure&#44; or at least
                survey their advantages or disadvantages &#59; Moses&#44; therefore&#44; speaking to
                men&#44; and not to angels&#44; continually drew the attention of his hearers to the
                state of rewards <pb n="312"/> 312 THE VISITATION OF HEAVEN. and punishments which
                could befal the nation at large&#44; as an evidence of the divine favour or
                displea&#8211; sure. To argue from his silence on spiritual punish&#8211; ments and
                rewards after death&#44; that the life everlast&#8211; ing is no part of the Mosaic
                dispensation&#44; would only betray in him who makes the assertion the grossest
                ignorance of many passages in the Bible&#44; which can only be explained upon the
                assumption&#44; that the im&#8211; mortality of the soul&#44; its reward and
                punishment&#44; and the resurrection of the dead&#44; were matters of univer&#8211;
                sal belief among the Israelites of the first temple. Moses&#44; however&#44; did not
                speak&#44; when speaking of rewards and punishments&#44; with but few
                exceptions&#44; of the individual Israelites&#44; but of the whole nation
                together&#59; thus&#44; that their prosperity should depend upon obedience&#39; and
                that disobedience would be sure to be followed by calamity. We may freely leave it
                to any one to answer&#44; what kind of punishment&#44; whether temporal or
                permanent&#44; should be inflicted upon a nation &#63; Surely the temporal appears
                to our understanding even to be the best manner for telling the world in a language
                not to be mistaken &#58; &#34; Upon this land rests the displeasure of God
                &#33;&#34; &#8212; If then any sudden and unexpected calamity comes over a land&#44;
                or if the whole habitable globe even should suffer simultaneously under a severe
                affliction &#58; it becomes us&#44; as religious men&#44; to ascribe it&#44; not to
                chance&#44; not to some fortuitous change in the atmosphere&#44; not to some
                telluric poison&#44; not to some extraordinary as&#8211; semblage of insects&#44; or
                all these and the like causes combined&#44; acting without the express agency of the
                Supreme&#44; but solely to his action&#44; by which He wishes to aifix his mark of
                displeasure upon mankind. Grant <pb n="313"/> THE VISITATION OF HEAVEN. 313 even to
                the deniers of a Providence all they ask&#44; yield to them their assertion&#44;
                that the air we breathe is pestiferous&#59; that the exhalations of the earth are at
                this moment noxious vapours&#59; that death is hidden in the water we drink&#44; and
                in the food we take to sustain life&#59; grant all this and more&#44; for all this
                may&#8211; be true&#44; since we have no means of disproving it&#58; and yet we&#44;
                in common with every thinking being&#44; must insist&#44; that it is a judgment of
                Heaven&#59; for God alone is capable of making the air more pestiferous than it

                secretly imbued with poison&#44; destructive of life. The more natural causes you
                produce&#44; the stronger becomes the evidence&#44; that all we witness this day
                comes from Him who is the Maker of light&#44; and the Creator of darkness. &#34; But
                why should this wrath be poured out upon earth&#63; Does God ever exercise
                judgment&#44; without a cause &#63;&#34; &#8212; No thought of this kind&#44;
                brethren&#44; ought ever to enter your mind &#59; no Israelite&#44; how little
                so&#8211; ever he may usually cogitate upon matters of re&#8211; ligion&#44; should
                suffer prejudice so gross to warp his mind&#44; as to accuse the Supreme of
                injustice &#33; &#8212; &#34; But the Lord is righteous in all his ways&#44; and
                upright in all his deeds &#33;&#34; The people of the world have sinned&#44; and for

                &#92;Ye&#44; indeed&#44; flatter ourselves often&#44; that the present age is the
                most enlightened one since the creation &#59; we also assume to ourselves a

                even by many grown gray in its ser&#8211; vice&#44; as a man would cast off&#39; a
                worn&#8211;out garment&#44; no longer fit for decent covering&#59; and the house of
                God is deserted&#44; because forsooth&#44; we must by main force compel God to give
                us riches&#44; and the days of the Lord&#39;s appointment are therefore looked upon
                as no better than other days&#44; for the reasoning&#44; that we are not born to
                starve &#33; And is this not true &#63; &#8212; And since no one can gainsay it&#44;
                why then&#44; I ask&#44; shall we express aught of astonishment at the judg&#8211;
                ment which is even now in the course of beino&#59; in&#8211; nicted upon the
                earth&#63; It is our sins that have made a division between us and our God&#44; and
                justly do we suffer&#44; for we have been rebellious against his words. Since now we
                acknowledge in God the Dispenser of the punishment&#44; we have to&#8211;day
                assembled to ask of Him&#44; by prayer&#44; to stay the evil&#44; and to come to our
                help &#59; since He who has afflicted is alone able to save us &#33; &#8212; But
                before we dare to hope for assist&#8211; ance&#44; we must first look into our
                conduct&#44; to see what requires amendment&#44; what total disuse&#44; and what
                virtues neglected are again to be cultivated &#33; &#8212; God is merciful&#59; this
                our daily experience teaches us&#44; since He suffers the sun to shine upon the

                per&#8211; mits him to live and repent. Nevertheless&#44; calami&#8211; ties are the
                concomitants of sin &#59; and if even the transgressor imagines&#44; that a long
                course of vice&#44; having so long remained without just recompense&#44; will for
                ever remain unpunished &#58; he will to his sor&#8211; row find&#44; that the Eye
                above watches unceasingly&#44; and that the ears of the Lord are ever open to the
                cries of the oppressed orphan and the complaints of the wronged widow&#59; and
                punishment will come&#44; when&#44; perhaps&#44; least expected. Ay&#44; calamities
                are the rods in the hands of God&#44; and with them He chastises the rebellious and
                careless&#44; that they may return&#44; repent&#44; and live &#33; Let this day&#44;
                then&#44; be the commencement of a sincere return to God&#44; and let us be mindful
                of the words of the prophet&#44; who says &#58; &#34; O come and let us return unto
                the Lord&#59; for He hath torn and will also heal us &#59; He hath smitten us&#44;
                and will also bind up our wounds.&#34; Hosea vi. 1. Here the Bible teaches us some
                valuable lessons&#44; which&#44; permit me briefly to enumerate. &#8212; The first
                is&#44; that whatever befals us&#44; be it evil&#44; be it good&#44; is the work of
                the Lord &#59; chance has no agency in the direction of affairs&#44; and whatever of
                healing&#44; what&#8211; ever of wounds we find&#44; is therefore to be ascribed to
                the Supreme Source. &#8212; The second consideration is&#44; that nothing happens
                without cause&#44; that is to say&#44; no calamity&#44; either individual or
                national&#44; is sent without there is sin for its origin&#44; and amendment as <pb

                consequence we are taught&#44; that by repentance the punishment may be averted
                before it comes&#44; or be suspended after it has already begun its ravages. &#8212;
                But what .is repentance&#63; Is it merely to enter the house of God after a long
                ab&#8211; sence&#44; perhaps&#44; and say to Him &#58; &#34; O our Father&#44; we
                have sinned &#33;&#34; and repeat thereafter our former course&#63; Ay&#44; if even
                we fast an entire day&#44; nay&#44; periodically for forty days&#44; to equal&#44;
                as far as our feeble strength will permit&#44; the time of Moses&#39;s pres&#8211;
                ence on Mount Sinai&#44; is this repentance&#44; I ask &#63; &#8212; No&#44;
                brethren&#44; this is mere lip&#8211;worship&#44; a repentance in which the heart
                has no share&#44; and such conduct is denounced by Isaiah&#44; who says &#58; &#34;
                Forasmuch as this people draw near with their mouth&#44; and with their lips do
                honour me&#44; but have removed their heart far from me&#44; and their fear towards
                me is taught by the precepts of men &#58; therefore&#44; behold I will proceed to do
                a marvellous work among this people&#44; even a marvellous work and a miracle &#59;
                for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish&#44; and the understanding of their
                prudent men shall be hid.&#34; &#40;Isaiah xxix. 13&#44; 14.&#41; &#8212; Repentance
                must not consist in mere outward show&#44; for though men might be im&#8211; posed
                upon by the specious appearance of the seem&#8211; ing repentant&#44; God will not
                be&#59; and what avails the opinion of the&#94;world in matters of virtue&#44; where

                second nature&#44; and my very existence is threatened&#44; if I mend now.&#34; How
                often has repent&#8211; ance been pushed off by such pretexts &#33; How num&#8211;
                berless are the victims of this most dangerous hypoc&#8211; risy &#33; for a
                reasoner of this class imagines&#44; there is no wrong in his doings&#59; for since
                he cannot avoid sinning&#44; he cannot be blamed&#44; and consequently that he ought
                not to be punished for it. But there is an error of the most fatal kind at the
                bottom of all this. Let us examine&#44; for instance&#44; the drunkard&#39;s plea
                &#58; that drinking has become absolutely necessary to him&#44; and that abstinence
                would be followed by death. &#8212; The latter assertion may be true &#59; but what
                then &#63; Was it not wrong in the first instance to commence the sinful course
                &#63; Now&#44; even suppose that his life should be the forfeit of his repentance
                &#40;which is&#44; however&#44; very doubtful&#41;&#44; would it not be better for
                him to die in virtue&#44; if he thereby can obtain the for&#8211; giveness he so
                much needs&#44; rather than live in deg&#8211; radation and die in sin&#63; &#8212;
                I merely adopt this ex&#8211; ample as an illustration&#44; and for every answer
                &#58; &#34; I cannot help sinning&#44;&#39; 5 we may find an equally strong&#44; and
                even a much stronger refutation&#33; &#8212; Upon the whole&#44; it is as much the
                duty of the sinner to repent at all hazards&#44; as it is the original duty of all
                men to act uprightly from the beginning of life at every sac&#8211; rifice&#59; and
                there is at the same time no distinction be&#8211; tween&#34; men&#44; why one
                should be absolutely compelled to be bad&#44; whilst another is good. And if we find
                the circumstances around us calculated to draw us into vice and irreligion&#44; we
                are bound to get rid of them &#59; and if we but begin&#44; we shall have soon ample

                reformation into effect&#59; as we are taught by our wise men &#58; &#34; Whoever
                comes to purify himself&#44; will be aided from Heaven.&#34; Having thus shown the
                danger of hypocrisy on the one side&#44; and self&#8211;deception&#44; which is but
                another species of hypocrisy&#44; on the other&#44; let us go a little farther into
                the extent of repentance. Repentance&#44; to be real&#44; must neither be partial
                nor temporary&#59; and if you once begin to find yourselves in the wrong&#44; if you
                discover&#44; lurking in your bosom&#44; the demon of impiety or insincerity&#44; it
                is your duty to root out the evil. Do not merely&#44; to use a physical simile&#44;
                cover it with a cataplasm&#44; to eradicate it by degrees&#44; but go resolutely to
                work and&#44; applying the knife of reforma&#8211; tion&#44; stop not till even the
                springs and roots of the malady are extracted. This alone can be a reforma&#8211;
                tion&#44; upon which the Almighty&#44; who knoweth all se&#8211; crets&#44; can look
                with pleasure &#59; for every thing short of this is but self&#8211;deception&#44;
                since although we appar&#8211; ently attempt to deceive the Deity&#44; we cannot do
                so&#44; as He knoweth all the secrets of our hearts. And much as a sincere
                repentance is approved of in Scrip&#8211; tures&#44; we find a hollow and insincere
                confession of sin denounced as unpleasing and abhorrent to the God of truth. For so
                we read in the seventy&#8211;eighth Psalm&#58; &#34; Nevertheless&#44; they sinned
                again&#44; and they trusted not in his wonders. In vain endeavours passed away their
                lives&#44; and their years in thoughtlessness. They sought Him when He smote
                them&#44; repented&#44; and called on God&#44; well remembering that God wa&#39;s
                their Rock&#44; and the Most High God their Redeemer. And yet they thought to
                deceive Him with their mouth&#44; and with their tongue they wished to lie to
                Him&#44; but <pb n="320"/> 320 THE VISITATION OF HEAVEN. their heart was not
                faithful to Him&#44; and they were not true to his covenant&#59; but He&#44; being
                merciful&#44; for&#8211; gave the iniquity&#44; destroyed them not&#44; withdrew
                often his anger&#44; and poured not out the whole of his wrath.&#34; Let me
                therefore beseech you&#44; brethren &#33; on this day of wo and lamentation&#44; to
                reflect that we&#44; in part&#44; as members of the human family&#44; are&#44;
                through our misconduct&#44; the cause that the pestilence now walk&#8211; eth
                abroad. And well has the destroyer fulfilled the command given him &#33; He appears
                within the walls of a city&#44; and the affrighted inhabitants fly as before the
                pursuing sword of a vengeful foe &#33; Anon&#44; the men skilled in the craft of
                healing endeavour to grap&#8211; ple with the enemy &#59; they marshal their
                forces&#44; as well becomes those who ween themselves to be the guar&#8211; dians of
                our health&#44; and in truth may deserve our thanks&#44; under Heaven&#44; for the
                care with which they apply the skill and experience which God has vouch&#8211; safed
                them. But wo &#33; neither flying nor skilful en&#8211; deavours can shield the
                city&#59; and in the haunts of dissoluteness&#44; amongst the nightly revellers&#44;
                in the house of the drunkard&#44; soon the groans of dreadful sufferings tell&#44;
                that here breaks a heart that expected not the stroke of death &#33; And desolation
                and mourn&#8211; ing are carried into the bosom of many a virtuous family even
                &#40;for so is the sad visitation&#41;&#44; and the number of the dying are hourly
                increased&#44; until the very heart within our bosom sinks&#44; and the chill of
                apprehension seizes hold of the stoutest mind &#33; &#8212; And all this is the
                fruit of sin&#44; the consequence of our transgression&#59; and yet we hesitate&#44;
                we seem barely to heed the warning&#44; as though it spoke not as loudly as ever the
                prophet&#39;s voice did &#33; &#34; Return ye&#44; for why <pb n="321"/> THE

                &#34; And but call upon me&#44; in the day of trouble&#44; I will save thee&#44; if
                thou but honourest me.&#34; &#8212; This is the language of God to his children
                &#59; and it is we only who reject the gracious boon by our perverseness and
                obduracy&#44; in thinking too little of the word of the Lord&#44; where so many
                glorious promises are held out&#44; to encourage the virtuous in his onward
                course&#44; and the sinner to repentance. &#8212; But neither should the
                contemptuous say&#58; &#34;The danger will soon be over&#44; and in a few days&#44;
                all will be safe again &#33;&#34; by which he would argue&#44; that there is no
                necessity for repentance. But why &#63; is the danger over when the pestilence has
                passed away &#63; may it not return with fearful violence&#44; and sweep off&#44; as
                its first victim&#44; per&#8211; haps&#44; the very man&#44; who thinks all is right
                with him&#63; And again&#44; is this disease the only instrument of pun&#8211;
                ishment&#63; we all know that this is not so&#59; and&#44; al&#8211; though the
                present occasion is peculiarly suited to awaken our attention &#58; there are a
                thousand occur&#8211; rences in our daily experience calculated to admonish us&#44;
                that we ai&#94; always in the hands of God&#44; and that in the midst of life we are
                in death &#33; &#8212; Another one may say&#58; &#34;Why shall I repent&#44; I see
                no others do&#8211; ing so&#44; and what good can my example do &#63;&#34; Thus

                should resolve to do his duty at all risks&#44; to exercise the right&#44; if even

                benefits of an individual&#39;s ex&#8211; ample&#44; every person&#44; even the most
                humble&#44; can do great service to virtue&#44; since we know not&#44; by what chain
                of events the efforts of the most lowly&#44; and the example of the most
                obscure&#44; may bring even a king upon his throne to repentance. Another
                objection&#44; which the ignorant may per&#8211; haps urge&#44; it behoves us to
                refute. It may be asked&#58; &#34; Since the soul is immortal&#44; and since life is
                so sur&#8211; rounded by clangers&#44; why is it desirable that we should live
                &#63;&#34; &#8212; If it were&#44; indeed&#44; that every human being were entirely
                isolated&#44; unconnected with any other member of the human family&#44; it might be
                at times&#44; to judge superficially&#44; a matter of indifference&#44; whether a
                man were to die or to live. But&#44; as every man is more or less connected with
                others of his species&#44; as upon the life and health of one man the welfare of
                perhaps thousands depends&#44; the subject under con&#8211; sideration assumes a
                different aspect. The good may die&#44; as far as he himself is concerned&#44; with
                perfect advantage to himself&#59; but the world cannot well spare him&#59; he
                is&#44; so to say&#44; a beacon&#44; by which other navi&#8211; gators of the ocean
                of life must steer their course &#33; And what is more animating&#44; what more

                indulgence maybe left us&#44; it behoves us not to guess at&#44; since God has
                called forth the pestilence to destroy&#59; and we&#44; therefore&#44; should all

                appearance in America&#44; about the eighth of June at Quebec&#44; and in the
                beginning of August it reached its highest point of malignity in this place. It
                declined after the middle of that month &#59; but re&#8211; turned two years
                later&#44; although in a much milder form&#44; and with a less extensive range. It
                is remarkable enough&#44; that not one adult died&#44; of this disease&#44; among

                XXIH. OBEDIENCE AND REPENTANCE. 0&#44; our Father and Kino &#33; we have sinned
                before Thee&#44; &#8212; pardon Thou our transgressions &#33; O&#44; our God &#33;
                we have been disobedient to thy will &#8212; do Thou forgive the children of thy
                servants in thy unbounded mercy &#33; &#8212; And show us in pity and kindness&#44;
                that they are safe who trust in Thee&#59; that they are not lost who seek
                forgiveness at the foot of thy throne &#59; and grant us life and salvation&#44; and
                avert from us the evil which our misdeeds may have merited&#44; and vouchsafe to
                accept in favour our fasting and prayer. Amen. Brethren &#33; It is but a few days
                since we listened in this place to the sound of the cornet&#44; which was to renew
                in our hearts the acknowledgment of God&#39;s almighty power&#44; and to rouse our
                minds to devotional feelings and repentance. &#8212; Let us hope&#44; that knowing
                the ob&#8211; ject of the blowing of the shophar&#44; it has not sounded in vain to
                our ears &#59; &#8212; that in this and other commu&#8211; nities it has made some
                hearts conscious of their weakness &#59; ancT~ that they have been reinduced&#44;
                feeling the unworthiness of their course&#44; to espouse the cause of sacred
                religion&#44; firmly resolved to unite themselves so closely to their God&#44; that
                this bond of union shall never more again be broken. To bind ourselves to God
                &#8212; that is the chief&#44; in fact the only&#44; duty which vol. i. 28 <pb
                    n="326"/> 326 OBEDIENCE AND REPENTANCE. the law demands of us&#44; and by it is
                understood an affectionate regard to the precepts of religion&#44; an en&#8211; tire
                reliance upon divine Providence&#44; and a cheerful resignation to God&#39;s
                dispensation. &#8212; I say that this feeling may be termed the only duty which we
                have to fulfil&#59; for where the heart is so imbued&#44; obedience to the details
                of the law is the necessary consequence &#59; and in return&#44; it is the result of
                a life of the most de&#8211; voted piety. To effect this end&#44; therefore&#44; is
                the ob&#8211; ject of all the commandments we have received &#59; and to prevent our
                ever losing sight of the same we have many ceremonial observances&#44; which
                uniformly tend to arrest our attention&#44; so that by being often led to inquire
                into the nature of religion&#44; we may be brought to apply the circumstances and
                events connected with them to ourselves&#44; and thus be rendered more
                thought&#8211; ful&#44; more contemplative&#44; and in consequence more rational and
                more pious&#33; &#8212; As a consequen3e from this exposition&#44; we should never
                let any religious act be performed by ourselves&#44; or see it performed by
                others&#44; without our making an application of it to our situation&#44; and
                suffering it in this manner to have the desired effect upon us. &#8212; The effect
                desired by the divine law is&#44; primarily&#44; obedience &#59; in the next
                place&#44; action&#59; thirdly&#44; improvement&#59; and lastly&#44; our
                happi&#8211; ness &#33; Observe&#44; brethren&#44; that not one religious duty is
                the result of a mere whim of the Deity&#59; for no matter how unimportant soever any
                thing may seem to us&#44; it is intended for our moral&#44; and perhaps also our
                physical&#44; improvement. &#8212; But what are the fruits of piety &#63;
                Contentment and satisfaction &#59; &#8212; content&#8211; ment with the lot which
                the Almighty may have as&#8211; signed to us&#44; be it humble&#44; be it high &#59;
                and satisfac&#8211; <pb n="327"/> OBEDIENCE AND REPENTANCE. 327 tion with ourselves
                &#8212; not that pompous self&#8211;sufficiency which would teach us to look upon
                ourselves as per&#8211; fect&#44; and every one else as far beneath us&#44; but that
                sort of mental ease&#44; of calmness&#44; which arises from a review of a life
                unstained by irreligion&#44; not deformed by moral turpitude. &#8212; And these are
                the fruits of the union with God which was alluded to above &#59; and what earthly
                treasures are bejond them in value&#63; are riches&#44; are power and glory &#8212;
                are honour and notoriety to be classed with them &#63; where are the riches which
                ever gave contentment and satisfaction&#63; when did power and glory leave a mortal
                nothing more to sigh for &#63; and did you ever see that man who was honoured of men
                and renowned for wisdom&#44; at whose heart the canker&#8211;worm of dissatisfaction
                gnawed not with greedy fatality&#63; &#8212; But the truly pious&#44; who looks upon
                the will of God as the purest source of all that is valu&#8211; able&#44; and who
                regards his word as the essence of wis&#8211; dom&#44; can never be said to be
                miserable&#44; can never be utterly bereft &#8211;of all treasures&#59; for he
                carries that within him which no riches can buy&#44; ay&#44; that which the king on
                his throne&#44; even on the very day of tri&#8211; umph&#44; might envy&#44; for it
                is the invaluable treasure of an inward peace of mind. And taking this stand&#8211;
                ard then as the measure of happiness&#44; we may in&#8211; quire &#58; &#34;Without
                an inward peace of mind&#44; how can life be happw&#63; without a peace with
                God&#44; how can our mind&#44; our life be peaceful &#63; without a love to God&#44;
                how can we have his peace&#63; without his religion&#44; how can we love
                Him&#63;&#34; &#8212; Thus should we reason&#44; brethren &#33; and if we do
                this&#44; we must of necessity turn our view from the world without to the mind
                within&#44; and if we find not peace there we will&#44; if we <pb n="328"/> 328

                remedy within our reach&#44; endeavour to introduce into our soul the love of God
                and of his law&#44; as a restora&#8211; tive to heal the wounds of our agonized
                spirit. This view at once brings us to the inquiry &#58; &#34;If piety is so
                valuable&#44; what means are we to use to ac&#8211; quire it &#63;&#34; To this we
                answer&#44; &#8212; Obedience and re&#8211; pentance. &#34;What is
                obedience&#63;&#34; It is not merely an acknowledgment in words of the justness of
                the divine commands&#44; not a mere theoretical acquies&#8211; cence in the truth of
                revelation&#44; &#8212; but also a cheerful and ever ready compliance with the
                demands of re&#8211; ligion. In other words&#44; faith and belief alone&#44; though
                they are the guides to piety&#44; are not the sole com&#8211; ponent parts
                thereof&#44; for deeds alone can finish the beautiful structure of mental
                greatness&#44; which listen&#8211; ing to the doctrines of faith and a confidence in
                their truth have commenced in the soul of man &#59; or to com&#8211; prehend the
                whole in one sentence&#44; religion should both be inward and outward &#33; &#34;
                And repentance &#63;&#34; is that state of regret for past misconduct and that
                atonement for errors&#44; which should be resorted to&#44; when we discover that our
                inward peace has been destroyed by a neglect of the laws of God&#44; or by an
                absolute contravention to the decrees of the holy Torah &#59; or in other words&#44;
                we should regret our past conduct&#44; and act differently from what we used to
                do&#44; as soon as we discover that we have strayed from the righteous path. Thus
                also speaks the prophet &#58; <pb n="329"/> OBEDIENCE AND REPENTANCE. 329 &#34;
                Return&#44; O Israel&#44; to the Lord thy God&#44; for thou hast stumbled through
                thy iniquity &#33; Turn hut with prayer unto the Lord&#44; and say&#44; Thou
                Pardoner of all iniquity I accept our return to good&#44; and receive our words as
                the offered steers.&#34; Hosea xiv. 2&#8211;3. &#34;Return&#44; O Israel to the Lord
                thy God&#33;&#34; this is the call which the Shepherd addresses to the strayed
                flock&#59; it is the language of encouragement spoken hy the Almighty himself to the
                reluctant&#44; trembling sinner &#59; it is the paternal invitation held out by the
                indulgent Father to the oft&#8211;offending and rebellious child. To understand now
                properly this prophetic call&#44; this invitation to the purifying and
                reconsecra&#8211; tion of ourselves to divine service&#44; let us examine a little
                more minutely the nature of our dependence upon God&#44; the causes of our
                transgressions&#44; and the effect which the indulgence in sin must have upon us.
                &#8212; To the first inquiry&#44; &#34; What is the nature of our relation to the
                Deity &#63; in what respect are we said to be dependent upon Him &#63;&#39; &#63; we
                answer &#58; Man is in&#8211; debted for his existence and preservation to God &#59;
                that is to say&#44; without a Creator&#44; no being can exist&#44; and without the
                continued watchfulness of this Crea&#8211; tor no created being can be preserved in
                existence. We are&#44; therefore&#44; absolutely speaking&#44; not only the mere
                works of God&#44; with whom He can act as pleases Him best&#44; but also nothing
                without Him&#44; since if He does not bless our efforts&#44; all our toiling is in
                vain &#59; and thus toq our daily experience proves to us&#44; that not to the
                strong is the battle &#59; not to the swift&#44; the race &#59; not to the
                industrious&#44; riches&#44; and not to the wise&#44; bread. This position being
                admitted&#44; that we are nothing without God &#58; it follows that being so
                dependent&#44; it should be our study to deserve God&#39;s 28&#42; <pb n="330"/> 330

                strive&#44; being certified of the will of God&#44; to live conformably to the
                precepts contained in the record of the divine will. To the reflecting mind&#44;
                therefore&#44; piety&#44; both theoretical and practical&#44; is the most
                natural&#44; and so far&#44; therefore&#44; from its being the effect of
                ignorance&#44; it springs from the best of knowledge&#44; the knowledge of
                ourselves. &#8212; &#34;What now are the causes of sin&#63;&#34; &#8212; Man&#44;
                being unmindful of his origin&#44; and confident in his conceit of his own
                importance&#44; neglects to look with becoming deference to the will of God&#44; and
                acts not as his reason dictates&#44; but as his passions or sup&#8211; posed
                interests lead. A man so constituted in mind imagines himself to be something
                superior to the rest of his fellow&#8211;beings&#44; or he thinks he has too great
                an interest at stake to be able to attend to the duties of a pious life &#59; and
                being thus&#44; as it were&#44; all in all to himself&#44; he weens he needs no
                farther im&#8211; provement&#59; his perfection he conceives to be com&#8211; plete
                &#59; and consequently the voice of religion cannot find in him a willing
                listener&#59; and as soon as this is the case&#44; the floodgates of iniquity are
                opened&#44; and sins upon sins&#44; crimes upon crimes&#44; are heaped upon the
                heart of the selfish&#44; proud reasoner&#44; and he stands a hideous spectacle of
                blasted moral deformity. &#8212; An&#8211; other cause of irreligion &#8211;can be
                found in carelessness and a desire for pleasure&#44; which are fully as perni&#8211;
                cious as the preceding cause. Some one imagines himself to be beneath the notice of
                Providence&#59; he thinks that One so elevated beyond all earthly in&#8211;
                fluence&#44; as the God we adore&#44; will not notice &#40;it be&#8211; ing&#44; as
                ke thinks&#44; unworthy of the Divine Nature&#41; the actions of man &#59; and since
                God does not regard <pb n="331"/> OBEDIENCE AND REPENTANCE. 331 our conduct&#44; it
                would be needless to pay any atten&#8211; tion to the duties of religion&#44; by
                which Ave are taught to bridle our passions and to rein in our desires &#59; and
                consequently the voluptuary thus underrating his im&#8211; portance in the eyes of
                the Omniscient hurries on eager for his ruin&#44; till virtue is neglected&#44; and
                sin has become a habit too inveterate almost for reforma&#8211; tion &#33; &#8212;
                But who of you&#44; brethren&#44; sees not the folly of both the above excuses for
                sin &#63; &#8212; One boasts of the superiority of his reasoning &#8212; ay&#44; his
                superior wis&#8211; dom &#8212; excellent moral energy &#33; &#8212; and in what are

                the ignorant &#63; in devotion &#33; No&#44; in avarice&#44; in the pursuit of
                ambition&#44; in idle declamation&#44; and in dissoluteness&#44; perhaps too in
                ridiculing those who dare to follow the better counsels of reason guided by the
                truths of revelation. &#8212; The irreligious scorns the humble believer&#44; and
                asks him &#58; &#34; What avails all piety&#63;&#34; But with how much more justice
                must the moralist laugh at all the vain pursuits of mankind who strut&#44; full of
                their own importance&#44; their brief space on the stage of life&#44; and are then
                hurried hence into oblivion&#44; into the total darkness of utter forget&#8211;
                fulness. &#8212; Look at the ambitious tyrant&#44; how he is toiling to oppress his
                subjects&#44; look at his fury when seeing his commands unobeyed &#8212; and then
                behold him again struck by the sudden dart of the pesti&#8211; lence&#44; and all

                interest and wisdom alone were to teach us&#44; we ought from preference to choose
                piety. But it would not be consonant with true religion to serve God from motives of
                being rewarded &#59; for what does the law say&#63; &#34;Thou shaft love the Lord

                when his work is done&#44; but like the love which the dutiful child bears towards
                the parent&#44; where all the duties&#44; even those more arduous than a servant can
                perform&#44; are cheerfully submitted to without the hope of reward or favour.
                Having thus briefly examined the futility of pride as an excuse of sin&#44; let us
                turn to the second chief reason&#44; carelessness. &#8212; The careless one
                says&#44; &#34;God regards not our course of life&#44; it is unworthy of his
                greatness to imagine that He should trouble himself about the conduct of
                mortals.&#34; &#8212; But is it true&#44; that it is beneath the dignity of God&#63;
                &#8212; Pray&#44; inform us&#44; if thou canst&#44; careless sinner&#44; what is
                deserving of God&#39;s notice &#63; Is it to regulate the course of the stars &#63;
                the arrangement of nature&#63; the calling into being of all things&#63; These&#44;
                surely&#44; thou too wouldst call ob&#8211; jects of grandeur &#8212; transcendent
                majesty&#59; and yet they all are no more than thou art&#59; for the word that
                formed thee&#44; formed them too&#44; and however little thou mayest value thy
                importance&#44; thou wast created&#44; as well as the brightest star in the wide
                expanse of heaven&#44; for the glory of thy Maker &#33; &#8212; If man would thus
                take a correct view of his own importance in the scale of beings&#44; he would act
                as becomes his dignity&#44; and the station he occupies as an intelligent creature
                of the Supreme Author&#44; and he would never suffer his life to pass away in the
                mere pursuits of pleasure and the empty nothings of this world. The Scriptures too
                inveigh against this sheltering of ourselves behind the idea of our being of but
                small importance&#44; and they emphatically teach us that noth&#8211; <pb n="334"/>

                men&#44; is beneath the notice of God&#44; for He surveys all with&#8211; out any
                effort&#44; and from his all&#8211;searching gaze nothing is hidden. &#8212; And
                thus speaks the Psalmist&#58; &#34;Lord&#44; how long shall the wicked&#44; how long
                shall the wicked triumph &#33; They oppress thy people&#44; and afflict thy
                heritage&#59; they slay the widow and stranger&#44; and murder the fatherless &#59;
                and say&#44; The Lord seeth not&#44; and the God of Jacob regardeth it not. But
                under&#8211; stand&#44; ye brutish among the people&#44; and ye fools&#44; when will
                ye be wise &#63; He&#44; that planteth the ear&#44; shall He not hear &#63; He&#44;
                that formeth the eye&#44; shall He not see&#63; He&#44; that chastiseth nations&#44;
                shall he not correct&#63; He&#44; that teacheth man knowledge&#44; shall He not
                know&#63;&#34; &#8212; And if man would but reflect&#44; that to Him.&#44; who
                created the materials of creation&#44; it can&#8211; not make any difference of
                exertion whether He pro&#8211; duces the greatest or the smallest thing known &#59;
                that the same creative energy called forth&#44; by his mere word&#44; the hosts of
                constellations and the humble worm of the earth &#58; he would never think that any
                thing could by any possibility be hidden from God&#59; for if He knows the course of
                nature in the aggre&#8211; gate&#59; if to his omniscience the beginning and the
                consummation of all is known&#44; can it be otherwise than that He should also know
                all that passes&#44; all that is transacted in all creation&#44; if even each star
                and every planet should be peopled by intelligent beings&#44; who like us act and

                interest&#44; passions&#44; or folly&#44; may counsel him. These briefly are the
                causes of sin&#44; as far as I can speak of them with confidence &#59; much more may
                be said about the ramifications in which these causes di&#8211; vide themselves&#44;
                but the limits of an address do not permit me to enlarge any more upon them. Having
                thus seen the motives&#44; let us view the effects of trans&#8211; gression. To
                understand the pernicious effects of sin&#44; you should look with proper care upon
                the benefits of virtue&#44; and the contrast will teach you&#44; emphati&#8211;
                cally&#44; the advantages and disadvantages of either. &#8212; The virtuous will
                look upon himself as a servant of God&#44; amenable for every part of his conduct to
                a Su&#8211; perior Tribunal. In accordance with this conscious&#8211; ness&#44; he
                will be humble in his own person &#59; not too confident in asserting the claims of
                his own merit&#59; meek and submissive to others&#44; where mere superior&#8211; ity
                of rank or the maintenance of pride can be the result &#59; kind to those who are
                his inferiors in life &#59; charitable to those who may need his gifts &#59;

                self&#59; and in accordance with this assumption he will be overbearing in his own

                poor &#59; oppressive to the unfortunate&#59; cringing&#44; low and servile to those
                above him&#44; although he hates them in his heart&#59; re&#8211; bellious to the
                commands of his parents or teachers &#58; he will be the disobedient son &#59;

                the pleasures they enjoy in their course of sin&#44; and laughing at those who act

                tween our God and ourselves&#44; the repentance due to Heaven should&#44;
                nevertheless&#44; not consist in a mere repentance of the heart alone. Acts&#44;
                too&#44; should in this case&#44; as well as in the preceding&#44; declare our
                sin&#8211; cerity &#59; and although to make a public show under ordinary
                circumstances would be inexpedient&#44; yet it is necessary that the acts of
                religion and the inward penitence should become manifest enough to others&#44; to
                prove that a reformation has taken place in the. mind of the sinner. And oh &#33;
                let no man be restrained from following this course because of the taunts of the
                irreligious world&#44; or from fear of being thought insincere&#44; nor let him be
                deterred by the difficulties of a thorough reformation&#59; but let him proceed&#44;
                under whatever disadvantages he may labour&#44; and he may safely trust that the
                positive determination to brave all for the sake of his God&#44; will cause the work
                to be of much easier accomplishment than he may himself imagine&#59; and let him be
                mindful of the just advice contained in the saying of the rabbins&#58; &#34;Whoever
                comes to purify himself will be assisted from heaven &#33;&#34; At the same time if
                the sinner wishes to be forgiven&#44; he must take especial care that his repentance
                consist not merely in one act of reformation &#59; but as soon as he begins his
                return to God&#44; he must leave his evil ways entirely&#44; and endeavour to forget
                his having been accustomed to sin&#59; and as his life has during his season of
                wickedness been rendered miserable&#44; be&#8211; cause he had not the peace of
                God&#44; he should strive with all his energy so to live henceforward as to possess
                this all&#8211;valuable privilege of the righteous. <pb n="341"/> OBEDIENCE AND

                all nature smile again &#59; if even the tears of repentance should then bedew thy
                cheek&#59; if even the burninsr of shame should now and then assail thy heart&#44;
                returning brother&#33; thy peace with thy God will have been restored. The
                sufferings thou wilt meet with will then appear the chastisements of Mercy&#44; sent
                to purify thee from former pollution&#44; and in place of former restlessness of
                spirit thou wilt have mental quietness&#59; and in place of the hatred thou once
                didst feel for thy species&#44; love and compassion will reign in thy breast&#59;
                and in place of stubborn resistance to the will of God&#44; thou wilt submit to his
                just decrees with meekness and cheerful resignation&#33; A reformation which is to
                effect this is the one designated by the law and prophets as the true offer&#8211;

                religion as the time emphatically devoted to repentance&#44; to seek again our Lord
                and his goodness &#59; it may be that we shall be graciously accepted before

                here&#44; in this house of God&#44; to spare us in the midst of the pestilence which

                has been taken away&#44; and we are here again to thank the Lord for all his

                else should we do&#44; but to nerve ourselves to live more strictly in the ways of

                mind&#59; and the little calls which they may make upon our posses&#8211; sions and
                leisure bear no proportion to the pains&#44; and time&#44; and wealth we bestow&#44;

                body in attending at the house of God&#33; Let me entreat you&#44; brethren&#44; in
                this perhaps my last address to you&#44; to forget each of you the peculiar
                grievance he may have to complain of. I know that in a society like ours&#44; where
                every man thinks himself&#44; and in fact&#44; is upon an equality with his
                brother&#44; every man too deems himself of equal importance with the other&#44; and
                imagines his advice deserves to be listened to with all due deference. I will admit
                that this should be so in part&#59;&#8211;yet this grants no one the right&#44;
                either according to religion or common sense&#44; to separate himself from the
                congregation &#59; no one should deem his own grievance too great for forgiveness
                &#59; since if this were so&#44; how can we&#44; any one&#44; the best of us&#44;
                hope for pardon from Heaven&#44; &#8212; we&#44; who have all so grievously

                our place of worship presents &#33; no one can imagine how much grief it must cause
                any sincere lover of his religion&#44; to see so little true respect paid to the

                filled with attentive audiences&#44; whilst our Synagogues are nearly empty&#33; Why
                should this be&#63; is not our faith as pure as the light of heaven&#63; is not our
                form of worship highly impressive&#63; is not our law as ancient as the descent upon
                Sinai&#63; Let us throw off the burden of this stigma upon our name&#44; let us be
                more united&#44; and let each person contribute to the public benefit by his
                purse&#44; as far as the means will allow with which God has blest him&#44; and by
                personal at&#8211; tendance where it may be needed. Let not one of us all hold back
                his contribution&#44; because of one silly reason or other&#59; for be assured&#44;
                brethren&#44; that before God&#39;s judgment no fictitious excuses will avail
                aught&#44; whatever the world may think of them here. Since now we must all
                acknowledge&#44; that we have been signally favoured&#44; much more than our merits

                therefore that my words will have some weight&#44; and let me entreat you all to pay
                for once something more than tran&#8211; sient attention to my remarks. We have been

                Heaven&#44; with professions of religion on our lips&#44; whilst in truth we do
                every thing to in&#8211; jure permanently the cause of our faith&#44; by pulling

                One strong effort at union is all that is want&#8211; ing to restore the proper

                sordid in&#8211; terest or private pique prevented Jews from being united&#44; when
                we have in truth so much to be thank&#8211; ful for&#44; that we ought to endeavour
                to deserve a little of the good we enjoy. In many other countries the Hebrew is
                oppressed and despised &#59; here he is upon an equality with other citizens&#44;
                and is unmolested in the exercise of his religion. Yet in tyrannical countries the
                Jew has always been a true believer&#44; and a zealot in his faith even to
                martyrdom. Let us then prove&#44; that in a free country the Jew is no less
                zealous&#44; no less animated with love of Heaven&#44; al&#8211; though the rod of
                persecution no longer compels him to seek shelter from the sword of man under the
                protection of the Almighty. &#8212; For even here we are not raised beyond hope of

                cares&#44; to manifold vexations and disappointments&#59; and although free and

                often asserted that we Israelites have no def&#8211; inite ideas of our religious
                doctrines&#44; that the light of the Bible&#44; although at first given to us&#44;
                sheds no benignant ray into our minds&#59; in short&#44; it is boldly maintained
                that we grope in darkness&#44; and are like the untutored infant in the midst of a
                collection of books&#44; unable to profit by the stores of learning con&#8211;
                tained in them&#44; because he has as yet not been taught to decipher their meaning.
                If by this and the like charges it is meant to be conveyed&#44; that we are
                en&#8211; tirely unable to give as reasonable definitions of our tenets as other
                denominations &#58; then is the charge ut&#8211; terly false &#59; for we have those

                which&#44; as Jews&#44; we owe to God. And can it be said&#44; that the plain and
                obvious knowledge so richly spread forth in revelation speaks no longer in
                intelligible terms to our people &#63; who will be bold enough to hazard the
                assertion&#44; that those promises which&#44; more than two thousand
                years&#34;ago&#44; were held forth to inspire hope into the fainting spirit&#44; to
                instil confidence into the wavering mind&#44; now no longer breathe the holy
                inspiration&#44; and the same refreshing invigorating thoughts which are inherent in
                the ora&#8211; cles of God &#63; &#8212; But if we are accused of an indiffer&#8211;
                ence to religious instruction &#59; if our adversaries assert that we are not such
                strict observers of the law as we should be &#59; if we are told&#44; that with the
                best light we act as though we were in darkness&#58; we must with shame confess the
                truth of these accusations&#59; for al&#8211; though instruction has been offered to
                us ever since the promulgation of the law&#44; it is lamentable to see how few
                profit thereby &#59; how rarely it is that a pub&#8211; lic teacher will be listened
                to&#44; how pleasant soever his instruction may be. And then&#44; even if he be
                listened to&#44; even if the people should come to hear him&#44; how few go away
                resolved in their minds to profit by the lessons they have heard. Ay&#44; we
                listen&#44; we acknowledge the justness of the rebuke addressed to our consideration
                &#59; but we go away from the lec&#8211; ture as bad as we entered the place of
                worship &#59; and if even a virtuous resolution should have for a mo&#8211; ment
                sprung up in our minds&#44; we endeavour by all means in our power to suppress its

                ashamed&#44; that even for a brief space of time we could find aught blameworthy in
                our course of life. Nay&#44; we perhaps blame the teacher for his unjust severity in
                placing cases before us by which we were induced to apply the rules he laid down to
                ourselves&#44; and upon second thoughts we im&#8211; agine&#44; that no part of the
                lecture could be justly ap&#8211; plicable to our case &#59; and to be brief&#44; we
                think&#44; that although othefs might need instruction and reforma&#8211; tion&#44;
                it is not we who are among the number. &#8212; It is owing chiefly to these
                causes&#44; to an overweening con&#8211; fidence in our virtue&#44; and to an undue
                notion of our importance and wisdom&#44; that we find so small a share of real
                religious feeling and a proper respect for teachers of religion among us. Hence it
                is that the world and its goods are so highly esteemed&#44; and that many&#44; very
                many&#44; of our people pay but little atten&#8211; tion to their immortal
                happiness. It is true&#44; they see riches snatched away from the gray&#8211;headed
                man&#44; who all his life has been the slave to avarice &#59; they behold the young
                and rich nursling of pleasure borne to the grave &#58; yet whilst poverty does not
                reach them&#44; they dream not that penury may be their lot also one day&#59; and
                whilst they enjoy life and health&#44; they place dis&#8211; ease and death at so
                great a distance&#44; that they appear not worth minding &#33; And if you call their

                flat&#8211; tering ourselves can our moral state be improved&#44; any more than the
                physician can cure his patient by encouraging him to indulge in those excesses which
                have deprived him of health.&#8212; It was owing to the belief&#44; that all my
                admonitions were useless&#44; belief do I say &#63; I am wronging myself&#44; to the
                absolute fact &#8212; that my several addresses had failed to draw our population to
                the house of God&#44; that I had almost re&#8211; solved never to address you
                again&#44; believing that you did not wish to hear me speak to you upon religious
                subjects. Understand me&#44; I do not say&#44; that I ever entertained the idea&#44;
                that all were unwilling to hear me&#59; for I am well convinced that there are some
                who always urged me to persevere &#59; neither should any one imagine that it was
                offended pride&#44; in not receiv&#8211; ing hearers enough&#44; which counselled me
                to desist. ~No&#44; although not indifferent to the approbation of those capable of
                judging&#44; yet would I have willingly foregone all praise&#44; would have gladly
                exposed myself to obloquy and hatred&#44; if by so doing I could have advanced the
                cause of religion and induced a more regular attendance upon our holy worship

                guage of the country were not universally approved of&#44; I thought that&#44; all
                things considered&#44; it would be best not to trouble you any more to pay attention
                to my addresses&#44; which some no doubt may also have thought an innovation in our
                worship&#44; though in truth&#44; it was first in our Synagogues and schools&#44; as
                early as the days of the second&#44; and perhaps too of the first temple&#44; that
                religious instruction was publicly dis&#8211; pensed&#44; and it is from us&#44;
                that a kindred faith&#44; kin&#8211; dred so far as it rests for its tenets upon our
                Scrip&#8211; tures&#44; has borrowed the custom. It was in accordance with these
                views&#44; that I in my last discourse an&#8211; nounced&#44; that it might probably
                be the last&#59; and do not think me inconsistent&#44; that&#44; with some of my
                views unchanged&#44; I now again address you. No&#44; it was not mortified pride
                which advised me to desist from my labours &#59; nor is it caprice which induces me
                to resume them. I do yet&#44; as I before did&#44; doubt my ability to effect any
                good purpose &#59; but I yield to the opinion of others&#44; who have advised me to
                con&#8211; tinue what I once have begun&#44; and I shall&#44; therefore&#44; from

                religious matters&#44; as far as I know&#44; or am acquainted with&#44; the tenets
                of our be&#8211; lief. I do not aim at novelty&#59; but all I shall endeav&#8211;

                endeavours&#44; before my voice be silenced&#44; my heart be stilled&#44; by death

                follow up with more certain success my humble beginning&#44; and thus&#44; although
                I may not live to see it here&#44; I shall have in another state the satisfaction
                not to have striven in vain &#33;&#8212; ~ Having said thus much&#44; which I
                conceived to be due both to you&#44; brethren&#44; and to me&#44; permit me to draw
                your attention to one of the most important tenets of our belief&#44; to wit&#44;
                the Advent of the Messiah&#44; and the restoration of the Israelites to their former
                land. &#8212; On this subject we read the following in the fourth chapter of Micah
                &#58; &#34;And it shall come to pass at the end of days&#44; that the mountain of
                the house of the Lord shall be prepared above the mountains&#44; and it shall be
                raised above the hills&#44; and to it shall stream the peoples. And many nations
                shall go and say&#44; Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord&#44; and to
                the house of the God of Jacob&#44; and He shall teach us of his ways&#44; and we
                will walk in his paths &#59; for &#40;says the prophet&#41; from Zion shall go out
                the law&#44; and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.&#34; Micah iv. 1&#8211;2. In
                Isaiah &#40;see the beginning of the eleventh chap&#8211; ter&#41; we read&#58;
                &#34; And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse&#44; and a sprout
                shall grow out of his roots.&#34; &#8212; And farther &#58; &#34; They shall not

                shall be full of knowledge of the Lord&#44; as the waters cover the sea. &#8212; And
                it shall come to pass on that day&#44; that the Lord will again display his

                out&#8211; casts of Israel &#59; and the dispersions of Judah He will assemble from
                the four corners of the earth &#33;&#34; That the passages just cited relate to a
                time which has not yet been experienced&#44; either by our or any other nation&#44;
                cannot be denied&#59; and whereas the words of Scripture have either come to pass or
                will eventually do so&#44; we say&#44; that we have either felt their
                fullilment&#44; or that we look forward to their eventual accomplishment. The first
                is knowledge&#44; the latter is hope&#59; and although we have no ocular evidence by
                which we can dive into the future&#44; yet we can compare this future with the
                past&#44; of which we have a record in history&#44; or appeal to our daily
                expedience&#44; which is the present&#44; and consequently to us mortals the best of
                evidence. Xow the ques&#8211; tion is&#58; &#34;What does past history or present
                experi&#8211; ence teach concerning Scripture&#8211;promises&#63; or&#44; in other
                words&#44; has any thing ever occurred which tended to verify
                Scripture&#8211;predictions&#44; and are there any events now in progress to verify
                these predictions&#63;&#34; &#8212; To these questions we answer&#44; that many
                predictions contained in the Bible have&#44; in times gone by&#44; seen their
                fulfil&#8211; ment&#44; and as far as the present period is concerned&#44; we also
                see the effects of the accomplishment of these events daily perpetuated. Xot to
                multiply examples&#44; let us refer to the admonitions contained in the books of
                Moses concerning our people. &#8212; They were there promised that they should enter
                the land of Canaan&#44; but that the nature of their tenure should be depend&#8211;
                ent on an exact obedience to the commandments con&#8211; tained in these books.
                &#8212; The event proved the truth of the prediction. The Israelites entered
                Palestine <pb n="353"/> THE ADVENT OF MESSIAH. 353 and conquered it. &#8212; Long
                they lived within its bound&#8211; aries&#44; and no nation was able&#44; during
                some periods of their history&#44; to withstand their power &#59; and yet they were
                but few in number&#44; living on a narrow margin of the eastern termination of the
                Mediterranean Sea. What then&#44; we ask&#44; made them so strong&#63; It was the
                power vouchsafed to them for obedience to the divine will. &#8212; Anon they
                trespassed &#8212; they were in truth tired of happiness &#8212; and followed the
                idolatrous course of other nations&#59; again and again were they warned of their
                threatening danger&#44; and thevlauovhed at the voice of admonition &#59; but the
                evil nevertheless came over them like a whirlwind&#44; and they were swept from off
                the surface of their land&#44; and fifty&#8211; two years of utter desolation saw
                not the foot of man or domestic beast treading the deserted his&#8211;hwavs of
                ruined Palestine. But seventy years soon elapsed&#44; and at their ending a small
                number of Jews&#44; now no longer the united Israelites&#44; returned to repossess
                their land&#44; and again they dwelt therein&#44; but not in that independence and
                national greatness which had been once theirs. A second time the temple was
                built&#44; and the smoke of sacrifices was again seen to arise from the sacred
                altar&#33; But wo&#33; bloodthirsti&#8211; ness and disunion broke out among
                them&#44; and the land&#44; which should not be defiled by innocent blood&#44; saw
                it shed in v torrents&#58; the brother murdered the brother at the &#39;foot of the
                altar&#44; and in the courts of the temple the aged was slain &#33; The Lord saw
                it&#44; and his anger was kindled&#44; and thereupon the ruth&#8211; less foe

                as thou yet art&#44; thou hast seen that tyrant&#39;s empire subverted by hordes of
                unheard of barbarians&#44; whilst thou art&#44; even in ruins&#44; the holy place of
                many nations &#33; In this manner was the prediction of our downfal accomplished
                &#59; and what is more remark&#8211; able still is that&#44; despite of this entire
                subversion of our state&#44; our nation has not ceased to exist. What&#8211; ever
                interdicting our worship&#44; slaughtering&#44; burning&#44; and torturing our
                people could accomplish&#44; has been tried by heathens&#44; Nazarenes and
                Mahomedans&#59; but yet all their toiling has been of no avail &#59; for we have
                been promised&#44; that even in the land of our enemies we should not be utterly
                forsaken&#44; as there too the Lord would still continue to be our Protector and our
                Father &#33; It is due to this promised supreme protec&#8211; tion&#44; not to any
                inherent obstinacy of our race&#44; that we have hitherto continued a nation&#44;
                undivided and unbroken&#44; although dispersed over all lands before the Lord. If
                then any one asks for a verification of Scriptural promises&#44; we can point to our
                past history&#44; and to our present experience &#59; and if even we can&#8211; not
                convince the unbeliever of the absolute certainty of our hope&#44; we believing
                Israelites have enough to uphold us in our faith under whatever sufferings it may
                please the Almighty to afflict us with. Having premised thus much&#44; we will now
                consider the promised future as absolutely certain and inevit&#8211; able&#44; as it
                is the decree and emanation of the same unending Being who before has promised&#44;
                and ful&#8211; filled to the letter the promises He had made. &#8212; The future
                then&#44; to which we conlidently look&#44; because <pb n="355"/> THE ADVENT OF
                MESSIAH. 355 it has been predicted&#44; is the change which the proph&#8211; ets
                have announced as sure to come over the nature of things in the social organization
                of mankind. &#8212; A time will come&#44; when the Lord will raise up a Branch from
                the root of Jesse&#44; who shall be the ruler of the Israelites&#44; and in whose
                days universal peace and uni&#8211; versal knowledge shall reign. &#8212; This
                prince&#44; so raised up by the special interposition of God&#39;s providence&#44;
                shall be endowed with the spirit of prophecy&#44; and be as good as he shall be
                wise. To him justice shall be as it were a girdle&#44; and truth a belt&#44; that is
                to say&#44; strict and impartial justice shall be administered by him &#59; since
                the wisdom which shall rest upon him is to be the special gift of Heaven&#44; and
                therefore he will be incapable of erring. Besides this&#44; peace shall be every
                where prevailing&#44; and no nation will prac&#8211; tise any longer the destructive
                arts of war &#59; because the desire for aggrandizement and oppression&#44; as well
                as the power of executing injustice&#44; shall be re&#8211; moved. &#8212;
                Independently of all this&#44; the outward and temporal tranquillity will be more
                than overbalanced by the spiritual renovation which is to take place. &#34; The
                earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord&#44;&#34; says the prophet&#44; the
                law of the Most High will then indeed become the beacon&#8211;light to all na&#8211;
                tions&#59; and thus many nations shall say&#58; &#34; Let us go to the house of the
                God of Jacob&#44; and He shall teach us of his wajis&#44; and we will walk in his
                paths.&#34; And what shall happen to the people of Israel who have so long and so

                shall be brought back to the land which God promised to Abraham&#44; when He made
                with him the covenant to give to him and to his descendants the land comprised
                between the Euphrates and the river of Egypt&#44; a land which shall then be
                fruitful in the extreme&#44; where famine shall be unknown&#44; and where no wild
                beast nor poisonous reptile shall injure or destroy &#33; And the temple at
                Jerusalem &#63; it shall be rebuilt in more than its former splendour&#44; and the
                walls then reared shall endure uninjured and unap&#8211; proached by any foreign
                invader &#59; for the Lord will be around them like a wall of fire &#33; &#8212;
                Envy moreover shall be banished&#44; and the divisions and quarrels&#44; which
                caused twice our banishment&#44; shall be no more heard of&#59; for the reason that
                oppression both inter&#8211; nal and external must have ceased&#44; when the
                anointed king&#44; the Messiah of the Lord&#44; shall reign on earth &#33; &#8212;
                The foregoing is a summary of the many coincid&#8211; ing prophecies to be found in
                the Bible&#44; and it will be seen&#44; that the reign of the Messiah is to be one
                of good&#8211; will to all men. &#8212; It would be out of place in a discourse to
                mix controversial matters&#44; and to recite the opinions entertained by others
                respecting the prophecies cited above. To prove the correctness of our ideas were
                easily possible &#59; but neither is this the place nor would it answer any good
                purpose to do so now. Enough&#44; that our hopes are founded upon the evident and
                literal interpretation of the biblical text&#44; and any other explanation is
                unworthy of the sacred oracles&#44; where&#44; if we but knew the exact meaning of
                the words&#44; and if we were but cer&#8211; tain to what the prophets alluded&#44;
                when they spoke to a nation having a community of feelings and a <pb n="357"/> THE
                ADVENT OF MESSIAH. 357 peculiar mode of expression&#44; we should never be at a loss
                to agree about the import of any sentence. But unfortunately&#44; much has been lost
                in the lapse of so many centuries&#44; and among so many and multi&#8211; farious
                sufferings. &#8212; Still much&#44; nay&#44; the greater part&#44; is &#42;yet very
                evident&#44; and where this is the case&#44; where the words employed by the Bible
                are yet well under&#8211; stood&#44; where the imagery employed requires no
                ex&#8211; traneous elucidation &#58; there&#44; even at this distance of time and
                place&#44; we need not seek for any interpreta&#8211; tion&#44; save what the words
                employed convey. &#8212; And the passages relating to the Messiah are for the most
                part of this obvious and self&#8211;evident nature&#59; and as the promises there
                made have as yet not been liter&#8211; ally fulfilled&#44; we say&#44; that their
                accomplishment is yet to take place. Some one may ask &#58; &#34; By what means are
                we to distinguish the Messiah &#63; how are we to ascertain that he is of the
                descendants of David&#44; since the division of families rests no longer upon a sure
                foundation &#63;&#34; &#8212; To these and similar ob&#8211; jections we reply &#58;
                that&#44; whenever the true Messiah shall appear&#44; he will bring such evidences

                inquire&#59; but enough we know to say&#44; that whenever he appears&#44; his
                mission will be universally acknowledged&#44; and his rule every where submitted to

                THE INSTITUTION OF SACRIFICES. 359 DISCOURSE XXV. THE INSTITUTION OF SACRIFICES. O
                Thou&#44; who art exalted above all existing beings&#44; &#8212; to whom the whole
                that is&#44; is as nothing&#44; &#8212; but who receivest in grace the acts of
                worship of the works of thy hands&#44; receive us in favour when we approach Thee
                with prayer&#59; and accept our humble offering&#44; when we devote our hearts&#44;
                and souls&#44; and our pos&#8211; sessions to thy will&#33; Amen&#33; Brethren&#33;
                When we survey the events of life&#44; and investigate seriously the chain of
                circumstances which occurred since we entered into being&#58; we will be struck with
                the remarkable fact&#44; that amidst all our toiling we have rarely been able to
                accomplish any thing very remarkable&#44; either for its wisdom or greatness. It is
                not&#44; that some of us may not be as wise or as good as those who have succeeded
                in doing mankind es&#8211; sential service&#44; and who have raised to
                themselves&#44; what we would call&#44; lasting monuments of greatness&#59; but
                solely because no opportunity for display has of&#8211; fered itself t© us. &#8212;
                Man&#44; in fact&#44; to distinguish him&#8211; self&#44; requires that the
                materials of greatness &#40;if I may use the expression&#41; should be laid
                abundantly within his reach&#44; and all tTiat the greatest master&#8211;mind is
                capable of doing is to fashion the materials thus given into something&#44; by which
                either he or others <pb n="360"/> 360 THE INSTITUTION OF SACRIFICES. may be
                aggrandized or benefitted. But then&#44; again&#44; he cannot work by himself&#59;
                for&#44; give a man ever so many opportunities&#44; he cannot do much unless aided
                by others&#59; since life is so short and health so uncer&#8211; tain&#44; that
                nearly every undertaking must be left un&#8211; finished&#44; if many do not work
                simultaneously upon the same plan of action. If it were necessary&#44; it would be
                easily possible to prove this by the most isolated acts of greatness&#44;
                accomplished by the great&#8211; est of mortals&#59; but its evident truth&#44; as a
                general rule&#44; will obviate the necessity. &#8212; I speak not&#44; however&#44;
                of virtuous actions&#44; of deeds of faith&#44; but only of worldly affairs&#44;
                where a man is not so much an individual&#44; as a part of a general system&#44; or
                in other words a mem&#8211; ber of society. &#8212; It is in the latter capacity
                that he must fail of distinguishing himself&#44; if he has not the opportunity given
                by being j&#94;aised above the level of his fellows&#59; since otherwise his acts
                will all be con&#8211; fined to himself&#44; or his immediate connexions&#44; and
                therefore apparently inoperative upon the general mass without. &#8212; Great
                acts&#44; therefore&#44; being difficult of accomplishment&#44; and what is
                more&#44; not being al&#8211; ways useful&#58; it would seem to follow&#44; that it
                is inex&#8211; pedient to be striving for their attainment. And in truth&#44; as a
                general rule&#44; it would be best that no at&#8211; tention whatever should be paid
                towards attempting great things&#59; for it is through these attempts&#44; whether
                successful or unsuccessful&#44; whether good or bad&#44; that so much evil has been
                entailed upon mankind. &#8212; Be&#8211; sides&#44; if only the truly virtuous and
                highly gifted were to undertake this task&#44; but&#34; very little evil&#44;
                com&#8211; paratively speaking&#44; would be the consequence&#59; but the misfortune
                is&#44; that so many bad and interested <pb n="361"/> THE INSTITUTION OF SACRIFICES.
                361 men scramble for greatness and notoriety&#44; that hardly any thing but positive
                evil is the general consequence of the almost universal desire for distinction. It
                is this knowledge of the utter inefficiency of all our best endeavours&#44; which
                induced our wise men in many instances to counsel their hearers &#58; &#34; Try to
                keep thyself distant from earthly greatness&#59;&#34; or&#44; &#34;He who pursues
                honour&#44; will not attain her&#59; she will fly from him.&#34; &#8212; &#34;If
                then&#44; we are not to be ambitious&#44;&#34; some one will ask&#44; &#34;what
                should be the aim of our life&#63;&#34; The answer is&#58; If it were that we
                ourselves were perfect and unimprovable&#44; our life would in&#8211; deed be spent
                in uselessness&#44; unless we attended to actions connected with the world
                without&#59; but&#44; since we must&#44; with the smallest share of penetration&#44;
                dis&#8211; cover&#44; that we have always an object of attention within
                ourselves&#58; we shall&#44; if we set a proper value upon our improvement&#44; have
                enough to do for the entire brief space of time which we are permitted to sojourn in
                this state of existence. And in the atten&#8211; tion which we thus pay to
                ourselves&#44; we may rest as&#8211; sured that we adopt the best means of improving
                ourselves and benefitting others&#59; for if we weigh every act and thought we shall
                seldom&#44; if we have correct knowledge&#44; be led into error&#44; and the nature
                of truth is so organized&#44; that benefit and instruction must flow out of its
                contemplation as well as prac&#8211; tice. &#8212; And because life&#39;s best
                efforts ought&#44; accord&#8211; ing to the &#94; Toregoing exposition&#44; to be
                directed to details more than to entire systems of action&#44; it is that we have in
                our religion&#44; revealed to us and to the world for our guidance and
                instruction&#44; so many particular precepts&#44; relating to the various stages of
                vol. i. 31 <pb n="362"/> 362 THE INSTITUTION OF SACRIFICES. private life especially.
                It was the object of our Father to educate&#44; so to say&#44; his children&#44;
                that they might become worthy members of his family&#44; and fit to in&#8211; habit
                the universal palace which He has opened for all the living&#44; without
                distinguishing whether they be Israelites or gentiles&#44; whether rich or poor&#44;
                whether wise or foolish&#44; whether powerful and exalted&#44; or op&#8211; pressed
                and humble. For in God&#39;s mansion the doors are always open&#44; the entrance is
                only closed to the undeserving&#59; since the price of admission to its pleasures is
                a virtuous life&#44; according to the best en&#8211; deavours&#44; guided by the
                best knowledge a man may have received of his duties&#59; and of him who has
                re&#8211; ceived much light&#44; much virtue&#44; according to his means&#44; will
                be asked&#59; and of the less instructed and less gifted less will be required.
                &#8212; It is&#44; therefore&#44; in the many small and apparently unimportant
                precepts which our law contains&#44; that we discover the great wisdom of its
                institution &#59; since the great acts of life are unattainable by most&#44; but the
                minor observances of religion are within the reach of all. But unfortunately&#44;
                although we have so many ways to make our Father graciously pleased with our
                con&#8211; duct&#44; too many hours pass away&#44; even in the life of the best&#44;
                without an especial regard to the holy dic&#8211; tates of religion&#59; too much
                time is spent in worldly occupations&#59; too much leisure is devoted to foolish
                amusements&#44; so that with many the idea of self&#8211;im&#8211; provement is
                hardly ever entertained. Again&#44; success in life very often calls forth all the
                latent germs of pride and self&#8211;sufficiency&#44; places before its victim the
                greatest notion of his own greatness&#44; and excludes all thoughts of superiority
                elsewhere even in his Maker. <pb n="363"/> THE INSTITUTION OF SACRIFICES. 363 And
                escapes from clangers&#44; too&#44; are then but another incentive to vaunting&#44;
                as though success in one&#39;s undertakings and escapes from difficulties are the
                fruits and the necessary consequences of human fore&#8211; sight and of a
                mortal&#39;s exertions&#33; &#8212; And if a man has those ideas of pride and
                obstinacy once engrafted on his mind&#44; he will step carelessly&#44; as it
                were&#44; over the course of life&#44; and heedless of false paths&#44; will hurry
                on to the goal of his existence&#44; regardless if he has missed the aim of his
                being here or not. &#8212; The reason is obvious. He has confidence in his good
                intentions and prudence&#44; and as he regards not what others say or think&#44; he
                must remain unimproved or perhaps retrograde&#44; hourly&#44; from the point of
                eminence he may have attained&#59; and every one at last must dis&#8211; cover&#44;
                that the man&#44; whom during the brilliancy of a successful career we were apt to
                esteem as wise and superior&#44; has ultimately left us no reason to desire&#44;
                that we might be like him. For though his actions may have savoured of earthly
                wisdom&#44; and apparently gilded his very words with a specious reasonableness&#58;
                we will&#44; upon closer investigation&#44; discover&#44; that he has been the prey
                of ambition&#44; and been tormented by insatiable desires at those very moments&#44;
                when his outward appearance denoted nothing but calm&#8211; ness to the casual
                beholder. &#8212; But religion w r as be&#8211; stowed upon us&#44; that we might
                watch ourselves &#59; and besides that we should endeavour to be free from the blame
                of tjie wise and the good&#44; we should also be able to hold up the mirror of
                God&#44; his holy law&#44; to our own souls&#44; and thereby discover&#44; if it be
                all right within&#44; if all our deeds can be as well defended upon true and solid
                grounds&#44; as they may seem right to <pb n="364"/> 364 THE INSTITUTION OF
                SACRIFICES. others. The oftener now we institute this inquiry&#44; the oftener we
                take this view into our natures&#44; the more capable we must he&#44; of
                necessity&#44; to discover the errors we may have committed&#44; and rectify them.
                &#8212; Now the greatest instruments we have to accomplish this change in our
                sentiments&#44; are regret and grati&#8211; tude &#59; for the former will teach
                us&#44; that there is some&#8211; thing unworthy in offending&#59; and the
                latter&#44; that benefits received demand some return on our part. It is to these
                considerations&#44; that we can refer the entire system and arrangement of the
                sacrifices&#44; which we were commanded to bring to the temple of God on certain
                occasions. &#8212; We read in Leviticus v. 5&#58; &#34;And it shall come to
                pass&#44; if he have incurred guilt by any&#8211; one of these things&#44; that he
                shall confess the sin he hath done &#59; and bring his trespass offering to the Lord
                for the sin he hath com&#8211; mitted.&#34; In this announcement of the institution
                of the offer&#8211; ing for guilt&#44; we are also&#44; at once&#44; shown the
                object of the ordinance. &#34;And he shall confess the sin he hath done&#59;&#34;
                not with careless inattention shall man present himself before the altar &#8212; not
                with an outward present&#44; but inward obstinacy dare he approach &#59; &#8212;
                no&#59; the first step is&#44; he must confess his sins&#33; Not before a man is he

                &#40;although both may be at times useful&#44; when one is done to obtain
                advice&#44; and the other to promote contrition&#41; &#8212; needs he to <pb n="365"

                fallible as himself&#59; but before his God he shall pour out his heart&#44; to the
                Almighty he must tell what the great&#8211; ness of his evil has been &#59; for to
                Him he cannot offer extenuations of his conduct&#44; nor can he endeavour to conceal
                the smallest minutia even of all his thoughts. Having thus fortified himself in
                regret&#44; he shall bring his offering&#44; an animal free from fault&#44; a
                bird&#44; or even a handful of flour&#44; if this be all his means can afford&#44;
                to the priest&#44; and have it sacrificed according to the dictates of the law in
                atonement for the wrong he has done. &#8212; Let us for a moment advert to the
                solem&#8211; nity of the occasion. A sinner&#39;s own reflections&#44; or the
                admonitions of his fellow&#8211;beings&#44; have awakened in him a consciousness of
                the wrong with which he has burdened his soul. Remorse seizes him &#59; &#8212; day
                and night he is agitated by the consciousness of the nothingness of his imagined
                exalted station&#59; &#8212; and the rest that is denied him&#44; when he reflects
                upon the oppression which the labourer&#44; the orphan&#44; the widow&#44; and the
                stranger have received at his guilty hands&#44; he now seeks to find in the religion
                which he has hitherto neglected. He reads the Word&#44; and he is told&#44; that
                confession&#44; restitution&#44; and amendment are the means of forgiveness&#59; and
                behold him then pouring out his anguished spirit in sincere prayer&#59; again he
                visits the humble roof of the labourer&#44; and gives him the wages which he has
                unlawfully detained from him&#59; lie shares the riches which he enjoys with the
                widow and the orphan whom he has oppressed&#44; and thus prepared&#44; he leads to
                the courts of God his trespass&#8211;offering. Again&#44; the fire is kindled upon
                the altar &#59; the offerer lays his hand upon the head of 81&#42; <pb n="366"/> 366

                imagines&#58; &#34;Thus did I deserve to die for my crimes&#59; but the Merciful One
                has given me an opportunity to re&#8211; gain the happiness I have lost by means of
                the sac&#8211; rifice which He receives at my hands.&#34; The song is chaunted by
                the singers of the temple&#44; the priest ar&#8211; ranges the fat upon the
                altar&#44; and the multitude rejoice at the return of another member to the
                frater&#8211; nity of the pious&#59; but this is nothing compared to the new
                affection for himself&#44; his God&#44; and the law awakened in the mind of the
                offerer&#44; who with a holy zeal newly rekindled&#44; with love for mankind again

                from their grasp. If regret can have this beneficial influence upon man&#44; the
                other prineiple&#44; which has been mentioned&#44; gratitude&#44; can and should
                have a similar effect. &#8212; Man has tilled the field&#44; and intrusted his seed
                to the fer&#8211; tile bosom of the earth. He has completed his share of the task
                for producing the bread which is to nour&#8211; ish him. But what is his labour&#44;
                if the Lord sendeth not the rain and the dew to fertilize the ground &#63; Or&#44;
                if this blessing should come down too abundantly&#44; where is the husbandman to

                finished his annual task&#44; he cannot help reflecting how much he owes to God&#44;
                how utterly useless would his toil have been&#44; if his humble means had not been

                peace&#8211;offerings &#8212; offered through the exuberance of grateful feelings
                which animate them &#58; and one excites the other to deserve hencefor&#8211;

                separated for his crimes&#44; or by the malice of enemies from his kindred and
                friends&#59; as also he&#44; who had seen the glories of the Creator displayed upon
                the vast and mighty ocean&#44; &#8212; all in fact&#44; who had been snatched from
                imminent danger&#44; were bound to bring&#44; in acknowledgment of their debt of
                gratitude&#44; a present to the sanctuary of God&#44; and publicly declare the
                goodness which had been bestowed on them. &#8212; These&#44; briefly&#44; were the
                objects of the sacrifices. They were not intended to induce people to get rid of
                their sins by killing a guiltless animal &#59; no such senseless idea lay at the
                foundation of this part of the law. As I have said &#58; for sins committed
                unwittingly and heedlessly&#44; for violence done to the property of another&#44;
                which could not be considered as theft&#44; the sin and trespass&#8211;offerings
                were instituted &#59; but sincere repentance and repara&#8211; tion of the evil done
                were imperatively demanded before the sacrifice could be received. Of the
                offer&#8211; ings dictated by gratitude nothing more need be said in illustration
                than has been mentioned already&#44; since their good tendency must be apparent to
                any one that thinks seriously. &#8212; That bloody sacrifices are expedi&#8211; ent
                cannot be denied &#59; for since we are permitted to&#44; and daily do&#44; make use
                of animals for food&#44; is it not entirely consonant with reason to devote them
                also to the service of Heaven&#44; at the same time&#44; that we make use of them
                for ourselves &#63; And as has been said already&#44; it was not the mere
                sacrifice&#44; but the idea which accompanied it&#44; which could render it&#44;
                according to our law&#44; an acceptable offering.&#8212; But&#44; brethren&#44;
                since the temple has been laid waste by our adversaries&#44; the sacrifices have
                ceased&#44; for only on <pb n="369"/> THE INSTITUTION OF SACRIFICES. 369 the site of

                the burnt&#8211;offerings&#39;&#44; and the song of the Levite is hushed in the
                ruined halls of the holy house. &#8212; But let it not be said that&#44; because the
                outward symbols have ceased to be&#44; re&#8211; gret and gratitude have no longer
                their full influence on our hearts &#33; No&#44; let us&#44; each and all&#44;
                demonstrate by the careful attention we pay to our conduct that we feel poignant
                sorrow when we have transgressed&#59; and that for every act of grace we are
                grateful &#59; and that we are fearful of offending and ready to obey our everkind
                Father. If thus we are animated&#44; our life&#44; be it ever so humble&#44; must be
                a series of blessings to ourselves&#44; and to all around us&#59; and if we then
                even occasionally transgress &#40;since no man is perfect&#41; we are assured&#44;
                that the forgiveness which we crave will not be denied to our prayers. &#8212; And
                if&#44; then&#44; no distinction await us on earth &#8212; if the selfish of the
                world will not listen to our advice &#8212; if even we see the wicked lord it as
                masters &#58; we should submit to this dispensation with patience and
                cheerfulness&#44; and re&#8211; flect that this life is not the entire time which
                our im&#8211; mortal soul is destined to endure. &#8212; And then again&#44; if we
                but reflect&#44; how short a space man can enjoy all sublunary good &#8212; how many
                times the greatest earthly pleasures are interrupted by sorrow &#8212; and how
                little security there is in their possession &#8212; and besides how soon thj£
                man&#44; who is praised to&#8211;day by the pub&#8211; lic&#44; is despised and sunk
                in oblivion &#8212; and how futile all fame is &#58; we must be easily reconciled to
                the hum&#8211; ble lot&#44; which we&#44; in common with the immense num&#8211; ber
                of those unknown to fame and riches&#44; have re&#8211; ceived as our sphere of

                when the glory of the great must vanish &#8212; when the wisdom of the wise will
                cease &#8212; when the power of rulers will be broken&#44; &#8212; when they&#44;
                together with their humblest menials&#44; must all appear before the impartial

                will be preferred&#44; provided his life has been virtuous and useful&#44; according
                to his means. &#8212; Let it be therefore our constant study&#44; to train our
                hearts to obedience&#44; and let us never neglect to listen to the holy
                monitors&#44; which God has planted within us &#8212; regret and gratitude. For if
                we listen to their admonition&#44; and offer a contrite spirit to our Maker&#44; we
                may rest assured&#44; that our sins will be forgiven&#44; and that we shall be

                &#33; teach us thy ways and fill our hearts with knowledge of Thee and thy
                wonder&#8211; ful works &#59; so that adoration of Thee may flow from the
                consciousness in us of thy might and wisdom. Amen. Brethren &#33; You must have been
                often struck with the remark&#8211; able fact&#44; that persons who to all
                appearance have the same opportunity of forming an opinion&#44; will take views
                entirely varying of the same subject&#59; and that others&#44; apparently possessed
                of the same talents&#44; have acquired tastes so very differing&#44; and pursue at
                times such opposite and contradictory lines of conduct&#44; as almost to baffle and
                surprise you. But upon a closer investigation of the springs of action&#44; we shall
                dis&#8211; cover the reason of the first mentioned case to be&#44; that those who
                are to form a judgment have not been all taught alike&#44; and do not possess the
                same degree of information&#59; and of the second&#44; that those equally endowed
                with reasoning powers do not regard things from the same point of view &#59; and
                consequently see&#8211; ing&#44; as it were&#44; the moral world from different
                posi&#8211; tions&#44; they each form a different idea of the objects placed within
                their intellectual horizon. This also will account for the difference discoverable
                in the de&#8211; grees of moral improvement or piety&#44; which we meet <pb n="372"
                /> 372 THE SINFULNESS OF PRIDE. with amongst the children of man. If all were
                equally well informed&#44; and if all would give their mind the same direction&#44;
                there would be a perfect unanimity of opinion amongst all men. There would then be
                no different sects&#44; and every member of the universal religion would act as the
                most distant from him in time or space could do. Because&#44; since actions are in
                sound minds the results of thought&#44; and since thought is the effect of
                information &#58; all consequen&#8211; ces of thought or information would in this
                case be the same&#44; since the source of them would then be of equal extent and
                equal usefulness in all thinking be&#8211; ings&#59; that is to say&#44; men would
                all be virtuous alike&#44; because they would then be acting from an equal de&#8211;
                gree of knowledge&#44; and from an application of this knowledge to the same
                purposes. &#8212; Now&#44; although it is true that the thoughts of men cannot be
                seen&#44; still&#44; as their effects are visible&#44; we can determine almost to a
                certainty the current of ideas in most persons &#59; for&#44; since actions are bad
                or good&#44; useful or injurious&#44; we may safely conclude&#44; that the thoughts
                of the agents are also of the same nature &#59; and consequently that those who act
                well are governed by good thoughts&#44; and the doers of evil are moved by a bad
                train of thinking. This view brings us at once to the conviction&#44; that&#44; if
                Ave wish to cultivate the duties of religion&#44; it is of the utmost importance to
                us to know which train of thought is the promoter of religious conduct&#44; and
                which is calculated to abstract us from a pious life. Let me premise that all
                reflections arising within ourselves&#44; and admonitions addressed to us by
                others&#44; although they may at first sight appear to conduce to <pb n="373"/> THE
                SINFULNESS OF PRIDE. 373 what is commonly termed moral improvement only&#44; may be
                properly considered as belonging to practical religious instruction &#58; if their
                tendency is to improve the mind&#44; and to fertilize it for the reception of the
                seed&#44; which is to be derived in the best manner and as the only source from the
                oracles of God themselves&#44; when we have been aided by correct information and
                careful attentive study. Lectures and addresses from even the most brilliantly
                endowed speakers are there&#8211; fore perfectly useless&#44; if their hearers are
                not in sym&#8211; pathy with them through previous knowledge of re&#8211;
                ligion&#44; or if they merely flatter human pride&#44; and exalt a mortal&#39;s
                self&#8211;sufficiency. But to become truly the means of improving the public
                morals&#44; they should be calculated to convey general religious impressions and be
                chiefly directed to remove all kinds of objec&#8211; tions to our holy religion&#44;
                with which impiety and ig&#8211; norance may endeavour to entrap the unwary&#44; or
                which self&#8211;interest or passion may frame as excuses to lull a disturbed
                conscience into security. To say something very surprising&#44; or to advance new
                ideas ou a subject like our immutable religion&#44; would be evidently improper&#44;
                even if it were possible&#59; since any thing not before heard of&#44; or not
                previously ac&#8211; quiesced in&#44; must be an innovation attempted to be
                engrafted on the rule of faith&#44; and which would at once stamp doctrines thus
                advanced with the seal of falsehood. On the other hand to treat of ceremonies and
                laws in a lecture&#44; which is to be heard but once&#44; can also have no very
                beneficial tendency&#59; since noth&#8211; ing is easier&#44; than that the hearers
                may not under&#8211; stand very accurately the instructions of the speaker&#44; or
                may recollect them but imperfectly. &#8212; All&#44; there&#8211; vol. i. 32 <pb

                the province of oral and public instruction&#44; is to endeavour by rational and
                clear expositions of the nature of religion to call the attention of the hearers to
                the subject&#44; and to answer those objections which a person may have made himself

                may at times flatter our vanity with so silly an excuse&#44; as from want of proper
                training. It is true&#44; we may not know every particular iota of religious duties
                &#59; it may be that we are not fully aware of the extent of the sacrifices
                de&#8211; manded of us &#59; but we may&#44; nevertheless&#44; avoid even in these
                instances doing unconsciously wrong&#44; if we keep within the limits of what is
                allowed us&#44; and not assume for ourselves too much liberty of range in departing
                from what many of us may perhaps think the too minute observances of the ignorant
                and su&#8211; perstitious of a former age. We should be careful not to disregard
                all&#44; because we cannot respect all &#59; and upon the whole&#44; rather mistrust
                our judgment than our information&#44; and rather do many an unim&#8211; portant
                action&#44; than&#44; by too great stickling to know the reason for all&#44; omit
                doing that which may be very important&#44; although we may not so conceive it. With
                these general remarks prefaced&#44; let us recur to the subject which I first
                introduced for this day&#39;s <pb n="375"/> THE SINFULNESS OF PRIDE. 375 reflection.
                &#8212; I said&#44; that it is absolutely necessary for the religious man to have a
                good train of thoughts and feelings as the basis of his actions&#59; for without
                this first requisite&#44; virtue is but another name for hypocrisy&#44; and piety
                but the cloak of wickedness. &#8212; On this subject&#44; as well as on every other
                connected with our moral improvement&#44; we find wholesome advice in the holy
                Scriptures&#44; and upon referring to them&#44; we will at all times find the best
                guide w T e can desire to lead us through life. &#8212; Now&#44; of all the good
                habits which are commended in the Bible&#44; meekness is the most prominent&#44; and
                pride&#44; on the other hand&#44; is always held up as that species of feeling we
                should above all endeavour to avoid. &#8212; We read in the book of Proverbs xvi. 4
                &#58; &#34; Every one proud of heart is an abomination of the Lord.&#34; If
                then&#44; we wish not to deserve the displeasure of our God&#44; we should strive to
                eradicate this enemy of our improvement&#44; this pride&#44; from our hearts&#44;
                and never suffer it to obtain dominion over our feelings or to influence our

                incompatible with arro&#8211; gance&#33;&#34; &#8212; We answer&#58; When God
                created men&#44; He ordained for them the same origin and the same felic&#8211; ity.
                It was through sin that they forfeited this felic&#8211; ity&#44; and then a uniform
                termination of life&#44; or death of the body&#44; was decreed against all
                descendants of the first sinners. &#8212; In thus far&#44; then&#44; no man has a
                right to assume any superiority over another&#59; and humility&#44; which is the

                even dependent npon him&#44; neverthe&#8211; less&#44; of the same beginning&#44;
                and a similar ending. But pride will induce a man to forget that his begin&#8211;
                ning is the same with that of the most degraded&#44; and that the same fate awaits
                him&#44; which is appointed for all the descendants of Adam. Let us now rapidly
                follow the proud man through his career&#44; and see what this forgetfulness will
                lead to. &#8212; In childhood&#44; alas&#33; pride often shows itself already&#44;
                and the infant&#44; corrupted by flattery&#44; will spurn the caresses of his nurse
                as though the touch of her&#44; by whose care his life has perhaps been
                prolonged&#44; were contamination to him&#44; one&#44; who is descended from a noble
                line of ancestry&#44; noble perhaps in their being distinguished for the
                perseverance with which they indulged in foolish pleasures&#44; and their
                subserviency to unjust power. Ridiculous as the exhibition of pride is at so early
                an age&#44; and obvious as the folly thereof is to every beholder&#58; children are
                too often countenanced by their parents in such a line of conduct&#44; for they
                encourage veiw often&#44; rather than check this early growth of presumption.
                &#8212; In boyhood the seeds of pride continue to produce their legitimate
                fruit&#44; and the once petulant child shows all the perverseness of the overbearing
                boy &#59; and the advice of the teacher is received with a frown &#59; his
                instruction is regarded as the proper appendage of the pedagogue&#44; which the
                noble and rich scholar need not acquire&#59; and thus the ideas of
                self&#8211;sufficiency&#44; early imbibed&#44; are still stronger confirmed&#44; and
                the boy attains the age of youth with a heart scoffing at all that are imagined

                seeks the gayeties and amusements which he conceives to be the proper province of
                his exalted rank&#59; habit has already taught him to regard wealth and fictitious
                greatness as the chief glories of life &#59; and he&#44; therefore&#44; now utterly
                abhors those whose means or opportunities allow them not to partake of the same
                enjoyments&#59; and he will hate those who may be above him in those ac&#8211;

                stops short at no obstacles&#44; and he toils and watches in these endeavours much
                more than the philanthropist in his exertions. &#8212; Vice too will be courted&#44;

                proud devotee of worldly enjoy&#8211; ment&#44; therefore&#44; will occasionally
                seek some other occupation. Suppose him now in a high office&#44; see him honoured
                by his country on account of the influ&#8211; ence which his wealth and rank
                naturally confer upon him &#59; and assume again&#44; which is highly probable&#44;
                that his occupation has been changed without any improvement in the unhealthy state
                of his neglected mind. He is merged in multifarious employments&#44; and to his
                heart&#39;s delight he can tyrannize over some others besides his own personal
                dependants. They who have to ask favours of the official are received with haughty

                upon him should depend their success or failure. He will endeavour to crush those
                who have not sufficiently valued his importance&#59; and the greater the misfortune
                he can cause&#44; the greater will be his delight&#44; particularly if moroseness

                naught&#59; our ease may be momentarily disturbed by pain &#59; and the very excess
                of wisdom may produce aberration of intel&#8211; lect. Aud God has given us in the

                those lessons. The Bible speaks of a Pharaoh and of a Sanherib&#44; kings&#44; who
                in their might almost thought themselves gods and unconquerable&#59; but one was
                drowned in the Red Sea&#44; and the other returned&#44; from an attempted
                conquest&#44; a fugitive to his own land. &#8212; Then we have the example of a
                Haman&#44; who for the sake of offended pride strove to exterminate the de&#8211;
                scendants of Jacob &#59; and a Korah&#44; who wanted to supplant the righteous
                Moses&#59; but one was removed by a supernatural punishment&#59; the other expired

                read of the proud ISTabal&#44; who in private life was ungrateful from pride &#59;

                Brethren &#33; Full often have we experienced the goodness of God. Already at the
                time when our ancestor Abra&#8211; ham was yet alone the star shining in the
                East&#44; and sending forth the rays of piety into a benighted world&#44; did we
                experience in him&#44; our progenitor&#44; the kindness which the Lord bestoweth on
                his servants. &#8212; You are all&#44; no doubt&#44; sufficiently familiar with the
                history of Abraham&#44; to understand me when I say&#44; that the approbation&#44;
                which was so miraculously vouchsafed to him was&#44; in all human probability&#44;
                the cause that the worship of God was spread through the first preacher&#39;s means
                over a great portion of the primitive world. I do not wish to&#8211; say&#44; that
                any other method would have been impossible &#59; for this would be circumscribing
                the power of the Almighty within the range of circumstances and casualties. But
                surely we may be permitted to believe that the grace given unto Abraham&#44; and the
                evident favour this great apostle of righteousness enjoyed from on high&#44;
                were&#44; as far as we can judge&#44; the best means of rivetting the attention of
                all mankind&#44; and therefore the best adapted to impress upon them&#44; how sweet
                it is to be a servant of the Being who had dealt so bountifully with his adorer.
                &#8212; Our nation having been thus early chosen as the peculiar treasure of God in
                the person of our first ancestor&#44; we shall find no diminution of kind&#8211;
                ness if we descend to later periods. &#8212; Isaac selected as a sacrifice&#44; to
                try the faith of his loving father&#44; and rescued by the messenger of Mercy&#44;
                was blessed by God&#44; and promised the assistance which his father had never found
                failing him in his hour of need. &#8212; Jacob fled from before the wrath of his
                brother&#44; and <pb n="387"/> MOTIVES OF GRATITUDE. 387 wandered into a distant
                land for the safety he found not in his parental home. &#8212; And was he forsaken
                &#63; not in the least &#59; for even whilst reposing upon the hard rock&#44; he
                received comfort in a dream &#59; and the promise of God&#44; first made to Abraham
                and repeated to Isaac&#44; was renewed to him&#44; and he was assured&#44; that in
                his person and the persons of his descendants should the prophecies be fulfilled.
                &#8212; Refreshed by these marks of Supreme favour&#44; he served for many
                years&#44; as we read in the book of Genesis &#59; but even in servitude he saw
                sufficient grounds for thankful&#8211; ness. A numerous offspring grew up around
                him&#44; all like their father&#44; untainted by idolatry&#44; and un&#8211; dented
                by the abominations of the heathen &#33; &#8212; At length Jacob returned&#44; but
                not to enjoy the ease of life&#44; which his great acquired riches might perhaps
                have induced him to look for as almost certain &#59; for Providence had willed
                it&#44; that he should go into Egypt&#44; with his whole family&#44; there to become
                the great nation&#44; to whom the Lord would be God. Through the force of love Jacob
                was moved to wan&#8211; der thither in his old age &#59; and he and his sons all
                departed from this life in the land of the children of Ham&#44; fully impressed with
                the conviction&#44; that the time would come when the Lord would lead the Israelites
                out of that land&#44; into the inheritance which He had given unto their
                ancestor&#44; when He made with him a covenant&#44; and commanded him &#34; to walk
                before him .and be perfect.&#34; &#8212; The time rolled on &#59; but the Egyptians
                had forgotten that they owed much gratitude to the Hebrew Joseph who&#44; by his
                Heaven&#8211;bestowed prudence&#44; had saved the land from the desolation of
                famine&#59; they weened that Israel <pb n="388"/> 388 MOTIVES OF GRATITUDE. would be
                dangerous to the peace of the state &#59; they imagined&#44; as tyrants of more
                modern times also have imagined&#44; that the Hebrews could have no community of
                interest with their fellow&#8211;citizens &#59; they therefore oppressed them with
                heavy labour&#44; and all manner of work in the field&#44; for the purpose of
                di&#8211; minishing their number&#33; But the arm of the Lord interposed&#44; and
                the more the Israelites were op&#8211; pressed&#44; the more they multiplied&#44;
                and the more they spread out. When at length the time of the redemption
                approached&#44; a prophet and messenger were chosen&#44; to apprise Mitzraim&#39;s
                king that it was the will of the Eternal God&#44; that he should dismiss the
                Israelites from his service. Pharaoh refused to obey &#59; nay&#44; he increased the
                burden of the enslaved&#44; till even hope had fled from the heart of Jacob&#39;s
                children. But then it was that the fearful arm of the Lord was bared over the
                devoted land of Egypt&#44; till at length the oppressor relented&#44; and
                permitted&#44; under the weight of awful visitations&#44; to let the tribes of
                Yeshurun leave his land in triumph. &#8212; They thus went forth into the
                wilderness&#44; devoted to God&#44; as the newly married bride is devoted to her
                husband&#44; and passed through the Red Sea&#44; secure from the pursuing host of
                the Egyptians&#44; who were sunk into the abyss&#44; through which the Israelites
                had passed in safety. &#8212; And when they wanted bread&#44; it was given them
                every morning&#59; and when they asked for water&#44; it flowed for them out of the
                flinty rock. &#8212; Soon after they were brought to the foot of Sinai&#44; to
                receive the law&#44; which was to instruct them in the way they were to go&#44; and
                the statutes and command&#8211; ments they were to observe. &#8212; Having in this

                them&#44; it was to have been hoped&#44; that obedience would have fol&#8211; lowed
                the knowledge of right &#59; but it was not so. Misguided by fear&#44; and yielding
                to inherited preju&#8211; dices&#44; they sacrificed to an idol&#44; and called it
                the god who had conducted them out of Egypt. The un&#8211; grateful nation now
                deserved to be exterminated&#59; but the Merciful withheld his anger&#44; forgave
                their sin and destroyed not&#44; and poured not out all his wrath. &#8212; Again
                they sinned by murmuring against the promised land&#44; and for a second time was
                the decree of destruction revoked &#59; and by a wandering for forty years in the
                wilderness and the death of all those wdio had reached man&#39;s estate&#44; when
                they left Egypt&#44; the sin of ingratitude was expiated. They now entered the holy
                land&#44; under the guidance of Moses&#39;s disciple Joshua &#58; they drove out the
                former inhabitants&#44; who had offended God by their wicked&#8211; ness&#44; and
                dwelled in houses they had not built&#44; drank out of cisterns which they had not
                hewn&#44; and en&#8211; joyed all delightful products which they had not laid up
                themselves. &#8212; Here they might have lived a truly beloved people of God&#44; an
                admiration to all nations&#44; and a beacon&#8211;light to all inhabitants of the
                earth. &#8212; But they were led away by the free lives of the idolaters&#44; the
                yoke of obedience to divine com&#8211; mands was too grievous for them to bear&#44;
                and they stumbled upon the path of corruption. &#8212; But as they had been
                foretold&#44; the punishment denounced speed&#8211; ily overtook them&#44; and when
                oppressed by their ene&#8211; mies they soon discovered the difference
                &#8211;between the effects of the service of Heaven and the result of sub&#8211;
                jection to men. &#8212; Whenever they repented&#44; however&#44; 33&#42; <pb n="390"

                time to time&#44; saved through means of the judges&#44; whom the Lord set up for
                them. &#8212; Thus elapsed many years&#44; and the Israelites were upon the whole
                happy under the&#8211; divine rule by which they were governed &#59; till at length
                tired of the simplicity of their own pure government&#44; they required a king to
                rule over them. &#8212; In this foolish demand they were gratified&#44; and not
                alone this&#44; but a wise and virtuous man was se&#8211; lected as their chief&#44;
                who&#44; whilst he sincerely ad&#8211; hered to his piety&#44; was a blessing to the
                people. And when his conduct was such&#44; as no longer to entitle him to the favour
                of God and confidence of men&#44; he was told&#44; that his kingdom should not
                en&#8211; dure&#44; but should be given to a better man. This prince was David&#44;
                of eight sons of Jesse the youngest&#44; and at the time of his election the
                shepherd of his father&#39;s flock. To him&#44; the poet&#44; the warrior&#44; the
                patriot&#44; and the devoted servant of God&#44; was the care of the Hebrew nation
                confided&#44; and under him our kingdom rose to an indeed proud eminence. &#8212; It
                would be foreign to our rapid sketch to dwell minutely upon David&#39;s history and
                to expatiate upon every single act of his life as given to us in the Bible. Suffice
                it to say&#44; that for the few sins committed under the peculiar circumstances in
                which he was placed&#44; he displayed on every occasion so humble a resigna&#8211;
                tion&#44; so entire a reliance&#44; and so contrite a hope for forgiveness from
                God&#44; that we cannot help admiring that man&#44; who among kings of his time the
                greatest&#44; of conquerors the most renowed&#44; and of poets of all ages the
                sweetest and most sublime&#44; never forgot&#44; on any one occasion&#44; his

                severely transgressed &#59; and yet even here his example&#44; although not to be
                imitated in sinning&#44; is a guide to all sinners&#44; yea&#44; the greatest&#44;
                to return like him&#44; to belike him received&#44; under chastisement&#44; again
                into favour&#44; when their repentance and contri&#8211; tion are sincere and
                heartfelt. If Israel had under David&#39;s rule obtained martial power&#44; their
                moral glory was no less advanced by the splendid efforts of Solomon&#39;s reign. The
                temple dedi&#8211; cated to the all&#8211;pervading but unseen God&#44; rose
                noise&#8211; lessly before the admiring world&#44; and the splendour of the
                arrangements of the service&#44; the enchanting sublimity of the choral songs&#44;
                the thrill of the unri&#8211; valled music&#44; awakened the attention of even
                distant nations&#44; who now acknowledged&#44; that there was a God in Israel
                exalted above all power&#44; and more .sublime than all thought&#44; and to whom
                it&#44; of right&#44; belonged&#44; that all should adore him&#44; and bring
                sacri&#8211; fices to his footstool. Whoever now had the feelings of a man loving
                the community of which he was a part&#44; whosever bosom glowed at the glory of his
                own native land&#44; had at that period enough of cause for exultation&#44; and
                abundant reason to thank God for the many blessings bestowed on his people. Even
                after this period&#44; when the splendour of our nation was eclipsed&#44; when the
                kingdom&#44; divided into two warring parties&#44; became an easy prey for the

                to say&#44; our entire dispersion over all the earth&#44; has in truth been our
                salvation. For when was it ever in the power of any one nation to harm us all at the
                same time&#63; where was ever that universal monarchy which comprised the whole
                Jewish nation in its boundaries&#63; The disposition to exterminate us has&#44; alas

                ever been beyond the power and reach of any one people&#44; or of all nations
                combined. After the banishment consequent on the sin of our ancestors had endured
                for seventy years&#44; God visited them in their captivity&#44; and they were
                permitted to rebuild the temple of the Most High in Jerusalem. &#8212; The love for
                idols had by their captivity in Babylon been entirely exterminated&#44; and we&#44;
                therefore&#44; find no indications during the existence of the second temple&#44;
                that this sin was ever general among the Jews&#59; and thus then they
                flourished&#44; protected by God&#44; and preserved a distinct people&#44; although
                now truly a handful of men among nations&#44; since the ten tribes who had been
                banished before the destruction of the first house never returned&#44; and even many
                of the Jews also remained behind in the lands of their captors. Many a time&#44;

                was again laid in ruins&#44; and we were a second time scattered as the grains fall

                power of men to deprive us of our religion&#44; the solace of our captivity&#44; the
                comfort amidst all our sufferings. It pleased God&#44; on the day&#42; the
                recurrence of which we now celebrate&#44; to raise us up to be unto Him as a

                territory had resulted therefrom&#63; &#8212; And what at last could have preserved

                this alone it is which made the covenant with Abraham effectual&#59; this made the

                vigilant over ourselves. And when is this point gained&#63; never&#44; in our
                exist&#8211; ence&#59; and it is well that it is so&#59; we must ever toil
                upwards&#44; undismayed by intervening obstacles&#44; un&#8211; disturbed by the
                howling of the storm&#44; which the world&#44; the passions&#44; the cares of life
                may stir up within us&#33; But he who vainly endeavours to hold the bal&#8211; ance
                between goodness and sin will fail&#44; and become the ungodly wanderer&#44; which
                he so sedulously avoided to be&#44; by bestowing&#44; what he imagined&#44; an equal

                be our endeavour to have this solemn lesson constantly before us&#44; and derive the
                benefit from it&#44; which we should ever obtain from the wisdom emanating from the
                Creator&#39;s own words. &#8212; Isaiah had been sent to denounce to the Israelites
                their sinful practices&#44; to tell them that the proud citadel of Zion should be
                left as desolate as the neglected hut in a vineyard&#44; and that&#44; but for the
                grace of God&#44; the destruction should be as total as the subversion of the cities
                of the plain. Perhaps they may have pointed to the long row of oxen&#44; of <pb

                sacrificed&#44; as an agreeable savour to the Lord&#44; to the pomp with which the
                new&#8211;moon&#8211;days&#44; the Sabbaths&#44; and festivals&#44; were
                celebrated&#44; to the sweet incense which daily was burnt upon the golden altar
                before the holy of holies. &#8212; And to this remonstrance&#44; why punishment
                should not come down upon the sinning people&#44; the prophet replies&#58; &#34;
                Hear then the word of the Lord&#44; chiefs of Sodom&#44; listen to the law of our
                God&#44; ye people of Gomorrah &#33;&#34; We read in the book of Genesis of the evil
                deeds&#44; the unblushing licentiousness exhibited in these towns&#44; and candour
                must compel us to add&#44; that depravity but little inferior&#44; and brought about
                by an attachment to idolatry and mixing with heathen na&#8211; tions&#44; had taken
                deep root in the times of the proph&#8211; ets&#44; as we must gather from their
                touching admoni&#8211; tions to an unwillingly listening people. &#34; Chiefs of
                Sodom&#44; people of Gomorrah&#44;&#34; says the prophet&#44; &#34; you&#44; who
                practise&#44; both high and low&#44; deeds discounte&#8211; nanced by the law of our
                God&#44; and follow institutions forbidden by the word of the Lord&#44; you will
                speak of sacrifices&#44; of incense&#44; of burning fat&#44; of smoking altars&#63;
                You point to the crowded courts of the holy temple&#44; to the number of pilgrims
                that grace Jerusa&#8211; lem at festive seasons&#44; and then imagine&#44; that evil
                cannot come &#63; &#8212; But you are mistaken&#44; God no longer desires you to
                tread down his courts&#59; the presence of sinners&#44; when corning unreformed&#44;
                for the sake of being seen of men&#44; is not pleasant&#44; and He abhors festive

                your hands are full of blood.&#34; &#8212; The consequences of sinning are here
                strongly exemplified. TV T e are commanded to observe Sabbaths&#44; the
                festivals&#44; to as&#8211; semble on those days in the city chosen as the
                pecu&#8211; liar seat of God&#39;s majesty&#59; He had promised&#44; that He would
                come and bless us&#44; whenever we obeyed his will in this respect&#44; so far even
                as to preserve our land from the inroads of enemies&#44; when all should be gone on
                their periodical pilgrimages&#59; but when our ancestors had sinned&#44; their very
                outward acts of piety were considered&#44; not as a mitigation&#44; but as an
                aggravating of their offence &#59; the celebrations of the festivals had become&#44;
                as it were&#44; a burden too heavy to be borne by&#94; the Sustainer of all&#59; and
                even the prayers of the congregation He would no more hear&#44; if prayers were ever
                so much multiplied&#44; if all were to appear with hands outstretched to heaven&#44;
                because their hands were filled with blood. &#8212; Xow&#44; if we look at what
                Moses said in the fourth chapter&#44; seventh verse of Deuteronomy &#58; &#34; For
                where is there a na&#8211; tion&#44; ever so great&#44; to whom the gods are as nigh
                as our God&#44; whenever we call upon Him &#63;&#34; we shall at one view have
                before us the difference between serv&#8211; ing God in sincerity&#44; and assuming
                piety as a cloak for wickedness. In the one place&#44; w T e need but breathe a
                wish&#44; anc&#94; our wish is fulfilled&#44; as the prophet tells us in another
                passage&#59; and when we transgress&#44; no multiplicity of prostrations&#44; no
                accumulation of words&#44; no show of outspread hands will avail &#59; for the eyes

                against the discordant sound of apparent devotion&#44; mixed up with the
                contamination of vice. After having in this manner pourtrayed the abhor&#8211; rence
                felt for wickedness and deceit&#44; the prophet an&#8211; nounces what would be
                pleasing to God&#44; and says&#58; &#34;Wash you&#44; cleanse yourselves&#44; remove

                orphan&#44; attend to the suit of the widow &#33;&#34; &#8212; The first step in
                reformation must be the purifica&#8211; tion of the heart&#44; that is to say&#44;
                we must endeavour to find out the sources of our hypocrisy and correct our
                thoughts&#44; so as not to produce again actions of the kind which our Lord
                abominates. &#8212; This first step taken&#44; active purification should
                follow&#58; First&#44; to learn what is right&#59; so that if a man has acted
                wrong&#8211; ly from ignorance&#44; he may not be misled again by the like cause.
                &#8212; Then he should endeavour to dispense justice&#44; restore what has been
                unlawfully obtained&#44; and prevent oppression from descending through the
                practices of others upon the heads of the helpless ones. For it is unfortunately but
                too true&#44; that when&#8211; ever any one becomes reduced&#44; people are very apt
                to begin to think ill of him&#44; and for fear that his downward course should not
                be rapid enough&#44; his former friends perhaps even assist in lending their aid to
                break from under his feet the little resting&#8211; place he may have found&#44; to
                precipitate him the faster into the gulf of ruin&#59; and&#44; strange as it may

                stranger&#44; are almost daily the victims of the rapacious and designing. The
                prophet&#44; there&#8211; fore&#44; designates the orphan and widow as the chief <pb

                wishes to ob&#8211; tain the favour of God &#59; he should&#44; namely&#44; having
                hitherto practised outward piety for the sake of ap&#8211; pearance only&#44; now
                oppose the wrong intended to&#8211; wards the defenceless&#44; though in this
                pursuit he should expose himself to the ridicule and even ob&#8211; loquy of a
                thoughtless world. &#8212; Conduct so contrary to hypocrisy and time&#8211;serving
                persevered in&#44; will next tend to obtain the forgiveness of sins&#59; as the Lord
                says&#58;&#44; &#34; If your sins be like scarlet&#44; they shall be white as the
                snow&#44; and if they be red as crimson&#44; they shall become like wool.&#34; This
                is the image the messenger of Heaven used to express the change which
                repentance&#44; inward and outward&#44; will invaria&#8211; bly produce in man &#59;
                the glare of the scarlet is to vanish&#44; and the pure whiteness of snow shall take
                its place&#59; and truly when the heart has undergone a change from wickedness and
                corruption to virtue and entire devotion to religion&#44; it is not what it was&#44;
                nay&#44; it bears not even the least resemblance to its former self&#44; but it
                is&#44; as though a heart of stone had been removed&#44; and one of flesh
                substituted in its place &#59; &#8212; the want of hope is supplied by hope in the
                Lord&#44; and the absence of peace is superseded by the all&#8211;healing grace of
                God. Thus were the effects of sin and the results of piety laid by Isaiah before
                Israel. He told them farther&#44; that doing &#94;&#39;ood would certainly bring the
                blessing promised&#44; but that the sword should destroy them&#44; if they refused
                obedience. &#8212; Alas&#33; however&#44; their ears were closed against
                hearing&#44; and their hearts against understanding&#44; and they continued their
                course of iniquity&#44; undismayed by the reproof and instructions <pb n="408"/> 408

                and the fire was kindled &#59; and our virgins&#44; our sages&#44; our tender
                children&#44; and our strong men were slaughtered&#44; and our palaces were
                burnt&#44; and our temple devoured twice by the consuming flame. And those whom the
                sword had spared&#44; were led into captivity&#44; and here we linger distant from
                all the scenes of our early institutions&#44; scattered and dispersed over all the

                aid&#44; to help them to buy bread for their helpless children&#44; and to rescue
                from the grasp of the cruel creditor the bodies of the ancients and sages among them
                &#33; All this has come over us&#44; because we refused to mould our actions by the
                ordinances of the law&#44; be&#8211; cause we preferred worldly pleasures to the
                favour of the Everlasting One. &#8212; We&#44; therefore&#44; have yet to mourn

                denunciations of the ancient prophet are as yet ap&#8211; plicable to our own days.
                &#8212; But this state of things must be altered&#44; this unrighteousness must
                cease &#59; for the day will come&#44; when God will revenge himself on his
