				<p>During <date>Passover</date> as we learn from our present<add>&#63;</add> correspon<lb/>dent the first semi annual public examination of the children attached<lb/> to the school lately organized by the <persName>Reverend Dr. Wise</persName> took place.  The<lb/> examination was conducted under the presidency of the President of the Beth&#45;el con&#45;<lb/>gregation&#44; assited by the School committee and the Reader&#44; the <persName>Rev. Mr. Traub</persName>.<lb/>  A very interesting introductory address was delivered by a male scholar of the<lb/> first class&#44; after which that <del>first</del> class was examined by <persName>Dr. Wise</persName> on Catechism<lb/> &#38; lessons in religion.  The female teacher&#44; <persName>Miss Chaplin</persName> to whose execution<add>&#63;</add><lb/> the greatest credit is due&#44; and who is a teacher any school may be proud of&#44;<lb/> examined in Spelling&#44; Reading&#44; Arithmetic &#38; Geography.  <persName>Dr. Wise</persName> also exami<lb/>ned in reading the Prayer Book &#38; Pentateuch&#44; and much praise is due<lb/> to the Rabbi for his labours in teaching the scholars the true way of becoming<lb/> what they ought to be.  The specimens of writing also afforded proof of<lb/> astonishing progress <del>for</del> during the first six months of the existence of the school.<lb/>  The sight the examination presented&#44; is said to have been a pleasant one&#44; and it<lb/> was delightful to witness parents watching with great anxiety&#44; to observe<lb/> whether their wishes would <del>be <add>&#63;</add> </del> be gratified&#44; and their children would indeed<lb/> become learned&#59; but the progress then exhibited inspired them with the<lb/> confident hope&#44; that they would not be disappointed with the blessing of Hea&#45;<lb/>ven.  The examination over&#44; prizes were distributed to the deserving<lb/> scholars&#44; and the whole was concluded by an address from a female<lb/> <del>scholar</del> pupil of the first class.  <del>We could use</del></p>
				<p><placeName><hi rend="underline">St. Thomas</hi></placeName>.</p> 
				<p><persName>Mr. A. Wolff</persName> the lately appointed president of the congrega<lb/>tion of <placeName>St. Thomas</placeName>&#44; held a fair at his house on the <date>2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi></date> &#38; <date>3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> of March</date> for the benefit of the Sunday school<lb/> of that place&#44; and we are happy to state that it realized the handsome sum<lb/> of five hundred Dollars.</p>
				<p><hi rend="underline"><placeName>Russia</placeName> &#38; the Jews</hi>.</p> 
				<p>We see it stated in the papers that the <persName>Emperor<lb/> Nicholas</persName> has lately issued a new edict which orders that Jews in<lb/> the military service shall not be held to do <add>&#63;</add> duties on <date>Sabbath</date>&#44;<lb/> &#38; holy days&#44; but be left at leisure to attend <add>&#63;</add> worship.  Also that<lb/> Hebrew may advance to the rank of lieutenant.  Both these<lb/> regulations are certainly a great concession and an improvement<lb/> upon the <add>&#63;</add> policy of the Russians&#44; especially the former&#44; which<lb/> gives Israelites opportunities to attend to this religions requirements.  We<lb/> trust therefore that the report which has reached us may be true&#44; &#38;<lb/> we can  only believe it to be so&#44; without assuming a cordial change of<lb/> policy in the Czar toward the Jews&#44; as he acts often <sic>acts</sic> from the caprice<lb/> of the moment&#44; as many of his <add>&#63;</add> too will demonstrate.</p>

				<p>I should like to ask your opinion upon many other points from time to<lb/> time&#44; if you would permit me&#44; to address you occasionally&#59; what I trust<lb/> you will grant me&#44; and I assure you&#44; that you still never need blame<lb/> yourself for the favour granted.  If you can conveniently do it&#44;<lb/> please to make your reply in English&#44; that it may be extensively<lb/> circulated.  Answer this if you can by the earliest packet&#44; since<lb/> not I alone but many other persons are anxious for your opinion.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I have seen with pleasure that <persName>Mr De Sola</persName> has undertaken<lb/> a new edition of the Portuguese service&#44; since the books formerly issued<lb/> by <persName>David Levy</persName> <add>&#63;</add> are not now to be had any more though often inquired<lb/> after.  Two years ago I wanted to undertake the same labour myself&#44;<lb/> but a <sic>sever</sic> illness&#44; the small&#45;pox&#44; kept me confined for several months&#44;<lb/> and my health has ever since continued too bad to permit me to<lb/> undertake so heavy a task.  Having been thus myself prevented by<lb/> the hand of God from accomplishing my desires&#44; I am glad to see it under&#45;<lb/>taken by one who I hope is fully capable to do justice to the work.  If it is<lb/> well done&#44; I shall rejoice that it has been accomplished&#44; and shall use<lb/> my endeavours&#44; feeble as they are&#44; to forward the author&#39;s design.  If you<lb/> think proper you may communicate this to him&#44; altho&#39; I have never<lb/> had the pleasure of hearing any thing about him&#44; till I heard of his<lb/> prospectus some weeks since from a bookseller of eminence&#44; who belongs<lb/> to our congregation&#44; and not till this morning was the prospectus itself<lb/> placed in my hands.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I am afraid I have detained you too long&#44; particularly by matters<lb/> not relevant to my <sic>enquiries</sic>&#44; if so I beg you to excuse me&#59; and to<lb/> forgive the errors of a stranger&#44; who speaks to a father and teacher<lb/> in <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#59; whom he would gladly personally see &#38; know.  May our<lb/> God preserve you many years in health and prosperity&#44; and may there<lb/> never be wanting one in your family to sit on the seat of judgment in <placeName>Israel</placeName>.</p>

				<p>week&#44; and after he has got a house his father and mother are to<lb/> follow.  As he has now an office it is possible that the congregation<lb/> may restore my salary&#59; but I doubt it much.  From <placeName>Charleston</placeName> I<lb/> hear that it is likely that <persName>Mr. Poznanski</persName> will be elected for life<lb/> at the expiration of his present term&#59; his salary now is 1500&#44;<lb/> from orphan society for 6 boys 144&#59; house say 150&#59; perquisites<lb/> &#38; other scholars at least 250&#44; which is an aggregate exceeding<lb/> 2000&#59; against which I have been elected four times and all<lb/> I got from teaching&#44; marrying and salary may amount to 875 and<lb/> not a farthing more.  Of course <persName>Mr. Poznansky</persName> is popular&#59; but<lb/> who more than myself nobody can tell.  <persName>Mr Hart</persName> had a rest<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> raising my salary&#59; but there being no quorum a <add>&#63;</add><lb/> the last meeting the whole must lay over till <date>September</date>&#44; near<lb/> five months longer.  My salary due <date>March 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> has not been paid<lb/> yet.  But enough of this&#44; all talking does not alter the whole<lb/> affair one cent&#59; and only irritates me when I think of it.<lb/>  Have my books I left gone to <placeName>Washington</placeName>&#63;<lb/>  Give my love to aunt &#38; all the family &#38; believe me</p>
