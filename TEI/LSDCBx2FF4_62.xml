				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>Charleston</placeName> <date>July 20 1857</date></p>
				<p><addressee>Revd I. Leeser</addressee></p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">Dear Sir&#47;</p>
			<p rend="indent(3)">Yours of the <date>26<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> Ulto<lb/> came duly to hand as well as the P<lb/> Books.  <persName>Abrn<add>&#63;</add> Moise</persName> desires a state<lb/>&#45;ment of a&#47;c &#38; please send it to me&#44; let<lb/> it be from the beginning&#44; I think he<lb/> owes at least 3 years to <date>April 1858</date>&#44; he<lb/> will not pay in advance &#38; I have<lb/> to send after its due several times.<lb/>  You complain of the ingratitude<lb/> of mankind&#44; I thought you had suf<lb/>ferred so much &#38; so often that you<lb/> had become used to their ingratitude<lb/> &#38; had therefore become a philosopher<lb/> in that respect.  Here I must make<lb/> you acquainted with the course of<lb/> the teacher whom I selected for our<lb/> Children &#38; of whom you make<lb/> mention in your last as not having<lb/> ever written you.  I <sic>dont</sic> know<lb/> whether it came to your knowledge<lb/> that he was a drunkard&#44; for he<lb/> certainly could not all at once<lb/> or since his sojourn with us&#44; have<lb/> become so&#44; but no less certain it is<lb/> that he indulged in private&#44; &#38; managed</p>

				<p>until <date>2d night</date> <add>&#63;</add> to keep it from<lb/> the public eye&#44; when on that night at<lb/> his boarding house he was so intox<lb/>&#45;icated that he was compelled to leave<lb/> the table where the recital of the prayers<lb/> were going on <add>&#63;</add> was annoying<lb/> to those around him.  He must there<lb/>&#45;fore have obtained his liquor at a pub<lb/>&#45;lic house &#38; therefore partook of <hi rend="underline">Homity</hi><add>&#63;</add><lb/>  His host &#38; Hostess&#44; not wishing to injure<lb/> him suffered this dereliction&#44; to remain<lb/> within themselves under the promise<lb/> that he would leave their house&#44; as<lb/> it was impossible to board him longer<lb/> &#38; thus I as well as the people were<lb/> kept unacquainted with this vice<lb/> until after <persName>Mr. Jacobs</persName> resignation as Hazan<lb/> when I called upon him to read<lb/> the Law&#44; presuming that he was a pro<lb/>&#61;per person&#44; &#38; he did read on <date>Sabbath</date><lb/> when those who were acquainted<lb/> murmured strongly &#38; loudly when it<lb/> reached my ears&#44; of course no blame<lb/> could be attached to me&#44; as I then<lb/> was only made acquainted of his<lb/> weakness to call it by a gentle name<lb/> of course some action was requisite<lb/> &#38; I did not allow him to read again</p>

				<p>the school committee inquired first into<lb/> the matter as well as the school&#44; &#38; they<lb/> reported the result to the Board of<lb/> Trustees&#44; who summoned <persName>Mr Cohen</persName> &#38;<lb/> his accusers before them.  <persName>Mr Cohen</persName><lb/> would not appear unless he had in<lb/> writing the charges against him&#44; we<lb/> accommodated him.  He appeared &#38; totally<lb/> denied the charge&#44; his accusers ap<lb/>&#61;peared &#38; substantiated the charge by<lb/> others&#44; in addition to which others not<lb/> belonging or connected with the congre<lb/>gation having seen him take at<lb/> one drink in a bar room nearly<lb/> a tumbler of brandy&#8212;with these facts<lb/> the board of trustees discharged him<lb/> but submitted their action to the con<lb/>gregation&#44; when they confirmed our action<lb/>  The board in their kindness of feeling<lb/> for him ordered a quarters salary to<lb/> be paid him&#44; which would not be<lb/> due him until next <date>August</date>.  The<lb/> gentleman turns away in disappointment<lb/> and sues the congregation for another<lb/> quarters salary which he thinks him<lb/>self entitled to because <hi rend="underline">I</hi> engaged him<lb/> for a year.  Now my dear Sir&#44; we<lb/> ought to do good for our kind so that<lb/> we may be repaid in such a manner</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>I was in hopes he would have<lb/> been thankful for our consideration<lb/> in giving him what he did not deserve<lb/> but he has thought it wiser to seek<lb/> justice in a court of Law</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I shall be obliged by your favour<lb/>&#45;ing me with his precedents&#44; &#38; all<lb/> you know about him prior to his<lb/> coming here&#44; why he was dismissed<lb/> from the congregations as well<lb/> as from the school which he super<lb/>&#61;intended.  It is necessary for the Vin<lb/>&#45;dication of the cause of Virtue &#38; jus<lb/>&#61;tice we have Black sheep around<lb/> us &#38; no one should be allowed<lb/> to wear a cloak who is unworthy<lb/> of it &#38; if this man is a drunkard<lb/> why the better for us &#38; all <placeName>Israel</placeName> that<lb/> the mark should be torn from<lb/> his face.  We have been favored<lb/> with the presence of the <persName>Rev H. Jacobs</persName><lb/> of <placeName>Richmond</placeName> who preached last <date>Sabbath</date><lb/> &#38; will do so on the next&#44; his hearers<lb/> were much pleased with his mild<lb/> &#38; gentlemanly manner &#38; his discourse<lb/> was plain &#38; sensible.  He is no orator<lb/> our people are much pleased with his<lb/> manners &#38; he is intelligent &#38; no doubt a<lb/> good &#38; con<add>&#63;</add> Jew.  As ever your friend</p>
