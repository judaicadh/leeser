			<p rend="indent(1)">Dr Friend</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">As your monthly has been<lb/> presented I presume that my ladyship may claim<lb/> a portion of your time without having it distracted<lb/> by more important matter&#58; for let me tell you<lb/> my dear Sir I like not to be numbered with the<lb/> public in your esteem or attention&#59; &#38; you are sadly<lb/> mistaken&#44; if you think that by hearing from you<lb/> through your Occident I am repaid for a reply<lb/> to my favors.  But badinage aside I like to<lb/> read you as you are not clad in your holy day<lb/> garb to meet the public scrutiny&#44; but plain friend<lb/> <persName>Leeser</persName> with all his odd notions &#38; novel views of men &#38; things<lb/> The world has tended somewhat to improve me&#44; as they<lb/> shew me&#44; that I am a very insignificant personage to<lb/> them&#44; without the claims which fortune Talent or<lb/> beauty give But to my friends I am still something<lb/> <hi rend="underline">of une enfante gat&#233;</hi> &#38; not content with demi<lb/> favors.  Therefore have I punished myself by not<lb/> writing before&#44; that when I did I should receive your<lb/> undivided attention I am not willing to recognize<lb/> you in your works&#44; for you appear so <hi rend="underline">august</hi> that<lb/> I should never dare to enjoy the pleasure of writing<lb/> my thoughts as they flow to you.  Believe me you<lb/> are <hi rend="underline">two in one</hi> &#38; two very distinct personages.</p>
				<p rend="The following is written sideways at the top of the page and is the continuation of page 2V"></p>
				<p>I often think of<lb/> them with much<lb/> pleasure&#8212;Will<lb/> you be kind<lb/> enough to remem<lb/>ber me also to<lb/> <persName>Miss Adler</persName><lb/> if she has yet<lb/> retained that<lb/> name&#8212;also to<lb/> any friends that<lb/> I may have in<lb/> sweet <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName><lb/> Yrs resptly<lb/> <persName role="author">Sarah Anna</persName><lb/> <persName>Rose</persName> sends<lb/> her love to her<lb/> little playmate<lb/> <persName>Edward</persName> and<lb/> also to <persName>Myr<lb/>tilla</persName>.  How<lb/> much I should<lb/> like to see<lb/> them again</p>

				<p>Our weather has been &#38; continues intensely cold with<lb/> rain &#38; damp in place of sunshine &#38; a dry genial<lb/> atmosphere.  We can hardly be comfortable with large<lb/> fires &#38; extra <sic>cloathing</sic> for our houses are not built<lb/> for extreme cold nor are our servants prepared for<lb/> it&#59; there is something in their nature repugnant<lb/> to cold &#38; like the beaver they would remain torpid<lb/> until Spring if our demands on their services were<lb/> not so imperative.  We have had some of your<lb/> citizens among us who seem astonished to meet the<lb/> cold winds of winter instead of spring &#38; flowers&#58;<lb/> Among our strangers are <persName>Mrs B Henry</persName> &#38; daughter<lb/> of your city very fashionable people.  The Mother<lb/> a very intelligent fascinating woman who has<lb/> been beautiful but the scythe of father Time has<lb/> nearly destroyed it all&#33;  The daughter is a beautiful<lb/> <sic>blonde</sic> brought up too much in fashionable<lb/> to inherit her mothers talents or acquirements.  As<lb/> they were with their relatives the <persName>Henrys</persName> I saw much<lb/> of them.  We have also a <persName>Mrs &#38; Mr Aulden</persName> residents<lb/> of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> <persName>Mr A</persName> is <sic>chaplin</sic> in the Navy &#38; alth<lb/>&#45;ough very cultivated &#38; accomplished people&#44; moving<lb/> in a different circle from the <persName>Henrys</persName> in your city<lb/> but receiving much attention in ours.  I am happy<lb/> to learn the good fortune of our friends &#38; trust as they<lb/> increase in worldly goods so may they in piety<lb/> &#38; religion &#38; may their purses &#38; hearts be ever open<lb/> to the wants of their fellow creatures.  While the Fickle<lb/> God is so liberally pouring his blessings on some of</p>

				<p>your friends could you not allure him to bestow a few<lb/> of his favors on a certain friend of yours who would<lb/> endeavour to make good use of them.  I am glad you<lb/> have by your perseverance succeeded in organizing a<lb/> Jewish publication Society in <placeName>America</placeName> May you be<lb/> able to carry out your plan.  I feel assured many bless&#45;<lb/>ings will attend your exertions &#38; the poor will more<lb/> particularly feel the advantage of your untiring<lb/> efforts.  I said from what I could learn you would<lb/> have many subscribers in <placeName>Charleston</placeName> &#38; you have<lb/> taken a sensible course by acting <hi rend="underline">under the rose</hi><lb/> &#38; making it appear as if you were only an agent<lb/> &#38; not an originator of this good object&#33;  Those who<lb/> <hi rend="underline">know</hi> you feel that the <sic>benifit</sic> of the Jews &#38; their<lb/> Salvation is your highest <hi rend="underline">aim</hi>.  Like all great men<lb/> your good deeds will live after you &#38; this must<lb/> console you for the many hard rubs you have<lb/> received from those you have by your <hi rend="underline">independence</hi><lb/> prejudiced <del>you</del> against you.  I have <sic>inclosed</sic> the poetry<lb/> I would satisfy your curiosity which seems to be equal to<lb/> a womans but The Dying Hebrew was sent <persName role="author">S A</persName> by a<lb/> friend &#38; we know not the author.  <persName>Mana<add>&#63;</add></persName> is not re&#45;<lb/>converted that I know of&#44; she is not however more<lb/> advanced in the Christian faith as she only attends church<lb/> occasionally&#45;but she rides &#38; goes to parties on <date>Sabbath</date><lb/> in truth I cannot tell what she <hi rend="underline">is</hi> for she appears<lb/> different at different times.  I do not believe she is writing<lb/> or studying any thing &#38; I asked <persName>Anna</persName> &#38; she said she<lb/> knew no more than I did about it.  Her Father reques</p>

She is my relative but I think<lb/> her of the <add>&#63;</add> <hi rend="underline">Worldly</hi> entr&#233; nous.  As <persName role="author">S A</persName> wishes<lb/> to add a few lines&#44; I must conclude after requesting<lb/> you to remember me to all those who ask after<lb/> me.  What can a plain moderate sized bible with<lb/> good print be bought at&#63;  We want them for our<lb/> Sunday school.  May your health &#38; strength be equal to your<lb/> exertions in the cause of our blessed faith prays an unworthy</p>

The other piece is called &#8220;<persName>Rachael&#39;s</persName><lb/> pillar in the wilderness&#8221; and though the style<lb/> is quite simple I think it pretty.  Perhaps it<lb/> is requisite for <hi rend="underline">you</hi>&#44; to have <hi rend="underline">only</hi> superior pro<lb/>ductions&#44; if so I fear my contributions will<lb/> be deemed unworthy.  There are a few questions<lb/> Dear Sir that I have for some time wished<lb/> to have answered satisfactorily&#44; if it would<lb/> not be too much trouble I would really<lb/> feel indebted if you would explain them.<lb/>  Pray excuse this informal visit of mine&#44; you<lb/> no doubt deem me an intruder&#44; but forgive this first<lb/> act &#38; like the children I promise not to do so again<lb/> Pray give my love to cousin <persName>A &#38; R.
