                if you think that by hearing from you<lb/> through your Occident I am repaid for a
                reply<lb/> to my favors. But badinage aside I like to<lb/> read you as you are not

                the <persName>Henrys</persName> in your city<lb/> but receiving much attention in
                ours. I am happy<lb/> to learn the good fortune of our friends &amp; trust as
                they<lb/> increase in worldly goods so may they in piety<lb/> &amp; religion &amp;
                may their purses &amp; hearts be ever open<lb/> to the wants of their fellow
                creatures. While the Fickle<lb/> God is so liberally pouring his blessings on some

                Society in <placeName>America</placeName> May you be<lb/> able to carry out your

                answered satisfactorily, if it would<lb/> not be too much trouble I would
