                done. Did I write<lb/> you that my first period of engagement being out, with
                my<lb/> congregation have with my consent renewed it for three years<lb/> longer at
                the same salary and endowments. Circumstances<lb/> considered they have acted very
                liberally but what was most<lb/> gratifying to me was the very flattering I may say
                indeed<lb/> affectionate terms in which they expressed their hope that I<lb/> would
                remain with them, and their “deep regret that they<lb/> could not increase my salary
                to the extent they considered<lb/> my <add>?</add> deserved.” There was a full
                meeting, every<lb/> member being present, but as far as I was concerned there<lb/>
                were no two opinions. It was but one attempt to render<lb/> my situation among them

                my post including my emoluments from teaching <add>?</add> would be<lb/> considered
                by some to be worth over $1000, if they confined<lb/> themselves to that amount they
                would not be far out, Thus<lb/> you see although few in number we having probably
                not more<lb/> than 15 respectable well-to-do and standard families — we<lb/> do not
                lack spirit here — we have other <sic>expences</sic> Shamas<add>?</add><lb/>
                synagogue &amp;tc<add>?</add>. I think I shall succeed in being able to<lb/> get the
                gas put in this fall and then our beautiful<lb/> little <hi rend="underline"
                    >Snoga</hi><add>?</add> will be complete. With this sum and<lb/> living being so
                very much cheaper in <placeName>Canada</placeName> than in<lb/>
                <placeName>England</placeName> or the <placeName>United States</placeName>, I think

            <p>like <persName>R Nissim</persName> did to me <add>לא טוב היות האדם לבדו</add> “but
                for you<lb/> no take own wife—all goot<add>?</add>; goot<add>?</add>

                    <add>בתולות יפות</add> get no <add>איש</add>.” This was his<lb/> manner of
                speaking “die Inglis” when he thought that it would be<lb/> more impressive than
                Hebrew in which we used generally to converse.<lb/> Then he would hold up his finger
                and reckon <add>בראטון</add>

                to those young ladies with whose amiable qualities you have had opportunities<lb/>
                of making yourself acquainted lately. You “think most of your<lb/> religion, you
                give it most of your time and attention.” So do I, I<lb/> am too much wedded to my
                books just now to think as I ought<lb/> of other weddings. I am in no humor yet to
                be bound — to be tied<lb/> corded, fixed, irretrievably tied, fastened, booked,
                    <sic>rivetted</sic>, glued or screwed<lb/> I would not even with my congregation
                much as I am attached to them<lb/> My engagement with them, although nominally for
                three years I<lb/> am <add>?</add> up at any time I choose, this I stipulated for,
                and<lb/> now but <add>לא תדע מה ילוד יום</add>. <persName>Dr. Raphall</persName> is
                likely to leave<lb/>
                <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> for the same reason. I think Hazanim
                    <del>slaves</del><lb/> in <placeName>America</placeName> slaves enough under the

                to show that I would do them justice under any<lb/> circumstances, and this having
                been time enough to judge of my character<lb/> they have no right to evince those
