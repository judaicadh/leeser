                LECTURES AND OCCASIONAL ADDRESSES. LECTURE I. HEBREW POETRY.&#42; Beloved Young
                Friends &#33; The pleasure I now have of appearing among you to respond to the
                request made of me to deliver an address before a body of Israelitish youths&#44;
                who have nobly resolved to devote their leisure hours to their mental
                improvement&#44; has been delayed much longer than I wished or could have
                anticipated. Circum&#8211; stances&#44; however&#44; beyond my control&#44; and
                various delays naturally incident to the life of one who holds a public&#44;
                responsible station which&#44; whilst it is hon&#8211; ourable&#44; nevertheless
                deprives him not unfrequently of the disposal of his own time&#44; have detained me
                &#42; A lecture delivered in Elul 5601 &#40;1841&#41;&#44; at the Crosby Street

                tion. VOL. X. &#40;1&#41; <pb n="2"/> 2 HEBREW POETRY. hitherto&#44; and I fear that
                some of you may have thought me lukewarm&#44; for not rcdcemhig sooiior&#8211;tlic
                promise I made of co&#8211;operatiug with you in your laudable efforts&#44; when you
                did mc the honour of electing me an honourary member of your society. But such a
                judgment would be unjust&#59; for at no time did I feel more hopes for the revival
                of that religion&#44; an un&#8211; worthy minister of which I have been chosen&#44;
                in this country&#44; than when I learned&#44; that those who were natives of the
                soil had associated for the purpose of diffusing a knowledge of it among themselves
                and their friends&#44; by the institution of a library&#44; lectures&#44; and a
                public school&#44; whereby the deeds of our ances&#8211; tors&#44; the mercy of the
                Creator so often displayed among the sons of Israel&#44; the ancient language of
                Jacob&#39;s sons&#44; and the sufferings of the martyrs of our faith&#44; might
                become widely spread and generally known. Could I then feel indifferent about the
                prog&#8211; ress of such a society as yours&#63; Could my non&#8211; appearance at
                an earlier date than to&#8211;day be sufHcient evidence that my spirit had not been
                with you long ere this&#63; I trust&#44; therefore&#44; that you&#44; my
                friends&#44; will acquit me of neglect&#44; and that you will bear with me&#44;
                whilst I in my turn call your attention to a theme which has not been without cause
                the glory of Israel. But it is not of the prowess in battle of our fore&#8211;
                fathers&#44; not of their daring deeds of arms&#44; how they stood forward in the
                day of light to strike for their people and the cities of their God &#59; not of the
                renown which they richly acquired for their unresisting suf&#8211; ferings&#44;
                rather than yield to the threats of the op&#8211; pressor and his
                allure&#8211;ments&#44; in the cause of their blessed religion&#44; that I mean to
                speak now &#59; for though <pb n="3"/> HEBREW POETRY. 3 rich and inexhaustible as
                these subjects would be to the Israelitish patriot&#44; they have already frequently
                roused the orator and the poet to pour forth their thoughts that burn&#44; and to
                excite others to go and do likewise. And indeed wherever the name of Israel&#8211;
                ite is mentioned&#44; there arise in the mind of the hearer ideas of his constancy
                and ancestral renown&#44; and even his enemies must acknowledge that he is not to be
                despised as one of obscure origin and a parentage of no note in the world&#39;s
                history. I therefore do not wish now to soar so high&#44; and to bring before you
                the account of deeds of which sinning man is scarcely worthy&#59; but I mean to
                offer to your consideration another branch of the Hebrews glory&#44; in a field
                where there are indeed thorns and weeds&#44; but where still no blood can flow by
                the cultivation of the soil. Deeds of arms&#44; though performed in the cause of
                justice&#44; bring home sutt&#39;erings to the bosom of many &#59; martyr&#8211;
                dom&#44; though endured in a holy warfare&#44; is still a pain&#8211; ful subject
                for reflection. But the glory achieved by the Israelites of old in the art of poetry
                is one which we can contemplate without feelings of regret or pain. And it is the
                triumph which those who went before us have acquired in this peaceful pursuit&#44;
                on which I would desire you to dwell for the brief space I am permitted to detain
                you this day. Poetry proper consists in investing the subject with a light and
                attraction which indeed belong to it&#44; but which are not represented in the
                language of conver&#8211; sation&#44; commonly called prose. The poet&#39;s
                province&#44; therefore&#44; is to select the beautiful and striking fea&#8211;
                tures of his subject&#44; and present them to the hearer or reader in such a manner
                as to captivate his fancy&#44; <pb n="4"/> 4 HEBREW POETRY. and to cause him to feel
                within himself that the image before him is truly beautiful&#44; powerful&#44; or
                good. The prose writer or the ordinary speaker&#44; ou the contrary&#44; may without
                impropriety represent the subject in all its parts without ornament or dress&#59;
                since he merely is to give an account of the thing so as to represent it correctly
                to tlie one he means to inform. If you therefore read in a medical work a
                description of a man&#44; you would in vain look for any agreeable or lively sketch
                of his structure and capacities&#44; but merely a dry detail of bones&#44;
                muscles&#44; sinews&#44; veins&#44; and internal organization &#59; for the
                writer&#39;s object will evidently be to convey to you intelligible information of
                something which he knows&#44; or fancies he knows&#44; and which he feels called
                upon to communicate to others. But if this subject were handled by one pro&#8211;
                fessing to be a poet&#44; you would be shocked were he to dwell in measured verse
                upon the anatomical struc&#8211; ture of the body&#44; upon the organs of
                sensation&#44; breath&#8211; ing&#44; or digestion&#59; because you would justly
                deem&#44; that a medical description is not to bo expected from a poet. It will be
                evident from this short definition&#44; which I believe to be as accurate as can be
                given without resorting to a long and laboured dissertation&#44; that the prosaist
                is to address the understanding&#44; the poet&#44; however&#44; the feeling
                chiefly&#59; and whilst the first must endeavour to convince our reason by his
                carefully arranged argument&#44; the latter should excite our sensibility by the
                quickness and rapidity with which he sketches&#44; as it were&#44; his subject
                before our perceptive faculty. It will&#44; however&#44; be apparent to you without
                re&#8211; quiring any extended explanation from me&#44; that mauy <pb n="5"/> HEBREW
                POETRY. 5 a thing&#44; which is neither actually beautiful&#44; nor great&#44; nor
                good&#44; may still be able to be presented in such a light as to excite the fancy
                or the imagination &#59; or in other words&#44; the art of poetry&#44; which in its
                proper application should only elevate what is really deserv&#8211; ing of
                admiration&#44; may be prostituted to endow with a fictitious outward glare that
                which of itself had better remain buried in its well&#8211;merited darkness and
                obliv&#8211; ion. Hence&#44; all the effects of every species of vice&#44;
                crime&#44; or cruelty&#44; are of right no fit objects upon which the genius of
                poetry should alight. They are of an impure nature&#44; and only calculated to
                contaminate the innocent and spotless. What connexion then can there be in the
                realms of truth between the spirit in its purity&#44; and the pollution of sinful
                nature&#63; We should say&#44; none whatever. In fact&#44; if we view it un&#8211;
                connected with the satisfaction which all men have not rarely in the contemplation
                of things wrong and sinful in themselves&#44; we must aver&#44; poetry cannot or at
                least should not exhibit aught but what is beau&#8211; tiful&#44; great&#44; and
                good&#59; since the contemplation of themes having one of these qualities alone can
                tend to the moral improvement of man. Nevertheless&#44; it is a deplorable fact&#44;
                that poets of all ages and coun&#8211; tries and languages&#44; save those of one
                people&#44; have lent the charms which flow from their well&#8211;stored minds to
                beautify things that are odious in moral de&#8211; formity&#44; and have glorified
                the worthless&#44; and praised the pernicious aniang men and things. In other
                words&#44; the glare of poetry has been thrown around vice&#44; crime&#44; and
                cruelty&#44; and has appealed for applause to the satisfaction which erring man has
                not rarely in the coutemphition of things wrong and sinful in them&#8211; 1&#42; <pb

                tliefact that we have inclinations which are not good&#44; at least such as are not
                unfreed from evil&#44; and because we are more or less attracted by sensual
                things&#44; ueces&#8211; sary perhaps to our self&#8211;preservation and the
                continu&#8211; ance of our species&#44; which are notwithstanding this far removed
                from an absolute state of purity. In other Avords&#44; if one takes advantage of our
                known propen&#8211; sity to sin and sensuality&#44; and sketches their effects in
                such a manner as to hide their coarse and offensive features&#44; he may produce a
                picture which&#44; though repugnant to virtue&#44; will yet be attractive in its
                col&#8211; ouring and arrangements&#44; and consecpiently well&#8211;cal&#8211;
                culated to mislead the imagination and &#8211;warp the understanding. Judgment and
                our better reason may loudly exclaim that such poetry is destructive to the peace of
                society and of the individual&#44; and injuri&#8211; ous to morals&#59; but the
                poison will still be diffused&#44; and its apparent sweetness will hide from the
                many the im&#8211; moral effect which it bears within it. Another fact may be
                adduced here&#44; that in exact proportion to the faulty selection of his
                subject&#44; a poet is often admired by the unthinking multitude. They see only the
                beauty of the colouring&#44; and the harmony of the style&#44; the rapid fire of the
                diction&#59; but they remain utterly forgetful of the fact&#44; that the subject
                itself is not one belonging to the realms of true poetry. It matters not&#44;
                however&#44; in what maimer the poet speaks&#44; whether it be in rhyme&#44; in
                rhythm&#44; that is&#44; in measured sentences&#44; or whether he discard the
                jin&#8211; gling sound of similarly ending lines and metre&#44; and uses elevated
                words&#44; as they flow freely from his richly endowed soul. I say it is all the
                same&#59; it is poetry&#44; <pb n="7"/> HEBREW POETRY. 7 or a subject treated to
                captivate the fancy more than convince the understanding&#59; and if used for an
                adorn&#8211; ing of vice&#44; or for a palliating of crime&#44; it is alike
                in&#8211; jurious in either of the modes we have just mentioned. And all of us
                &#40;for I believe that there can be scarcely an exception in this age&#44; when
                reading is so generally resorted to as a mode of recreation and instruction&#41;
                must have at times become aware in their own expe&#8211; rience of the truth of my
                assertion&#44; that a subject&#44; evil in itself&#44; treated in the attractive
                light of poetry&#44; has more or less tainted our mind&#44; before we were even
                aware of the injury to which we were exposed. Look at the immense array of
                novels&#44; dramas&#44; and other poems of the last three hundred years&#44; &#8212;
                not to men&#8211; tion those of the Grecians and Romans&#44; &#8212; and say then
                whether their perusal does not cause&#44; in most cases&#44; a dissatisfaction with
                the actual world around us&#44; and excite in us desires and passions&#44; the
                gratification of which is clearly prohibited by the religion of the Is&#8211;
                raelite. This is not&#44; however&#44; the time&#44; nor is this the place&#44; to
                prove the assertion by examples&#44; although&#44; it would be easy enough to do
                so&#59; sutficient for us that the fact is&#44; alas &#33; too true to suffer a
                denial&#44; and experience is too generally cognizant of it to require any argument.
                I said&#44; therefore&#44; that I would &#34; call your attention to a theme which
                has not been without cause the glory of Israel&#59;&#34; because the poets of our
                peo&#8211; ple &#8212; and there were times when we had poets of high eminence
                &#8212; properly applied their art to its only true province&#44; to illustrate what
                is truly beautiful&#44; great&#44; and good&#44; and although the greater part of
                what re&#8211; mains to us of their works refers to but one subject&#44; that one
                subject is nevertheless the most beautiful&#44; the <pb n="8"/> 8 HEBREW POETRY.
                greatest&#44; the best our imagination can conceive &#8212; it is the Creator
                himself&#44; beyond whom there is nothing that deserves the epithets of
                beautiful&#44; great&#44; and good. I do not mean&#44; liowever&#44; to say that
                nothing but God is a fit theme for poetry&#44; nor tliat the He&#8211; brews
                illustrated nothing else&#59; fur from it&#58; I meant to advance and to maintain
                that the general one&#8211; sidedness of our biblical and later poetry is nowise
                derogatory to its beauty&#44; dignity&#44; and usefulness&#44; in&#8211; asmuch as
                it treated&#44; wdien treating this great theme&#44; one which cannot be excelled by
                the creatures of the most lively imagination with proper dignity and force &#59; for
                the reality of the Deity is invested Avith all the attributes which can lend
                enchantment and pleas&#8211; ingness to the works of the poet. But even the other
                matters which engaged the at&#8211; tention of our poets&#44; such as outward
                nature&#44; and man in particular&#44; have not been treated to beautify crime and
                lend attraction to sin. On the contrary&#44; there is not a woi&#39;d in all the
                ancient remains which by any possibilitj&#39; could corrupt the morals of
                inno&#8211; cence&#59; and well may we be proud that our Jioly lan&#8211; guage
                &#8212; holy&#8211;&#44; therefore&#44; in more senses than one &#8212; was never
                abused by being degraded to be made the handmaiden of sin and impurity. Would to
                mercy that the same might with truth be said of the poets of other languages &#33;
                Let us then be charged with the poverty of the Hebrew&#44; a poverty rather in words
                than in ideas&#44; and which is owing more to the calam&#8211; itous dispersion of
                the nation than to any original inherent defectiveness&#44; which&#44; however&#44;
                could hardly have been the case when the people of Israel pos&#8211; sessed&#44; it
                as their daily conversational language&#44; as we <pb n="9"/> HEBREW POETRY. 9 may
                readily judge from the elegance of the Scriptural style&#59; &#8212; let it be said
                that no heroic poem is discover&#8211; able in our language&#44; that dramatic
                literature was nnknown in Palestine &#58; still we may proudly point to the
                beautiful illustrations of nature and of nature&#39;s God which we discover&#44; the
                sublime&#44; admiring thoughts awakened within us&#44; the love of truth and
                righteous&#8211; ness that is kindled up&#44; when we carefully peruse the writings
                of our psalmists&#44; prophets&#44; and teachers&#44;&#8212; writings which yet
                remain unapproached&#44; not even to think of unequalled&#44; although the world has
                been increasing&#44; as it is said&#44; in refinement and learning&#44; ever since
                when Moses first sang his hymn at the border of the dead&#8211;strewn gulf of
                Arabia. It is erroneous to believe that the Scriptures and later Hebrew writings
                contain nothing but merely religious subjects&#44; in the limited sense of the
                words&#59; for though all have a bearing towards religion&#44; still the matters
                selected to effect this bearing are as widely diflcrent as the whole range of nature
                itself. For our poets availed themselves of historical events&#44; of legends&#44;
                of natural historical illustration&#44; of de&#8211; scription of phenomena&#44; in
                short of everything which possesses the qualities of beauty&#44; greatness&#44; and
                dig&#8211; nity&#44; to dignify and adorn their subjects&#59; and let me here at
                once remark&#44; that were we but perfectly ac&#8211; quainted Avith the imagery
                they employed&#44; we would feel no difficulty to understand precisely their
                mean&#8211; ing&#44; which is now unfortunately very often quite ob&#8211; scure. We
                may freely say that religion was to them the life of life&#59; hence everything was
                to be used to adorn this life&#44; and to make it attractive and loved&#44; even as
                is the newly&#8211;married wife to a devoted bus&#8211; <pb n="10"/> 10 HEBREW

                have occasion hereafter to advert to it again&#44; that many of the line scenes and
                descrip&#8211; tions in the best modern writers liave their origin in tlie books of
                the Bible&#44; and that the more a poet liad studied the sacred text&#44; the nearer
                he approached in his tnrn to the sublime&#44; the true&#44; and the beautiful. Let
                us now advert to the nature and arrangement of the Hebrew poetry and its style. Our
                modern idea of poetry is pretty nearly confined to two modes of expression&#44; if I
                may use the word in this peculiar meaning&#58; and these are rhyme and blank verse.
                In the first&#44; certain lines of every verse terminate in similarly ending words
                &#59; in the other&#44; however&#44; this agreement in sound is omitted&#44; but
                still the verse proceeds in a rhythmical or measured manner. It is not to be denied
                that these modes of expressing poet&#8211; ical thoughts have their advantage&#44;
                and by way of illustration we will give an example of each. THE HOUR OF PRAYER.

                extent in the rhymed species&#44; a great de&#8211; gree of forced construction must
                frequently occur to give the verse its outward appearance&#44; and conse&#8211;
                quently be a constant check upon the boldness and rapidity which would at times
                appear but for these conventional trammels. For the poet is compelled&#44; not so
                much to give utterance to sublime thoughts&#44; as to express them in the form he
                himself has invented&#44; or the adopted rules of his art have prescribed. He has
                consequently to file away&#44; to use an expressive word&#44; everything which
                stands in the way of the adopted euphony&#44; and to reduce his ideas often to the
                measure of his lines. If&#44; therefore&#44; harmonious and even&#8211;progressing
                sounds have a decided advantage in one respect&#44; they are obnoxious to the fault
                we have&#44; just stated&#44; of preventing us from receiving the full gush of
                elevated feelings which animate the poet&#39;s soul. It is&#44; therefore&#44; not
                in the least surprising&#44; that in the early Hebrew poetical remains barely a
                trace of rhyme and even&#8211;measure is to be found. Our psalmists&#44;
                orators&#44; and poets&#44; had a higher aim than pleasing the ear and exciting
                pleasurable sensations in the hearer&#59; hence they looked more to the

                however&#44; be understood as assertuig that no attention was paid to a certain
                evenness of measure&#44; which latter is undeni&#8211; ably discernible in the
                Psalms&#44; Job&#44; Proverbs&#44; the songs of Moses&#44; the Canticles&#44; and in
                other passages of Scripture &#59; but as maintaining that it would be useless labour
                to look for an equal number of syl&#8211; lables in the verses of any Hebrew poem of
                as early a date as the Bible&#44; or for a regular structure of verse or stanza&#44;

                cxii. Psalms &#8212; as to make it certain that the exceptions are owing to another
                cause than the idea of regular versification. Let me say at once that these two
                Psalms are of the kind properly called alphabetical&#44; or those which are so
                arranged that each verse or part of a verse com&#8211; mences in succession&#44;
                with one of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet&#59; which&#44; as you all know&#44;
                amounted to twenty&#8211;two. If&#44; then&#44; the first verse commences with
                X&#44; the second would commence with r&#44; and so forth. Several Psalms and the

                commencing in regular order&#44; thus consisting of about twenty&#8211;two verses to
                the Psalm &#59; others&#44; however&#44; have the alphabet repeated&#44; as
                Lam&#8211; entation iii. and Psalm cxix.&#44; and others have other verses

                this arrangement&#44; the psalm&#8211; ist is compelled to make his verses of pretty
                nearly the same length&#44; or&#44; in other words&#44; adopt to a great extent the
                rhythmical structure&#44; which&#44; as can be proved&#44; was not known&#44; at
                least not adopted by the early Hebrews. When he&#44; therefore&#44; has gone through
                this arrangement eight times&#44; or with sixteen letters&#44; he throws the
                remaining six into two verses&#44; merely to vary the too uniform and unusual method
                he has here employed. Hence the apparent stanza form which is presented in the
                concluding verses&#58; We may likewise assert as an undeniable fact&#44; that the
                verses of the alphabetical Psalms are not so inti&#8211; mately connected with each
                other as are the others&#44; the structure of which is of a less laboured kind. The
                same is the case with the two Psalms on which we have been commenting&#44; and to a
                greater extent even&#44; since each semivorse&#44; or each part commencing with the
                proper alphabetic letter&#44; is a sort of aphor&#8211; <pb n="15"/> HEBREW POETRY.

                far as subdivision in the verses is concerned&#44; whether they consist of two or
                three parts&#59; and hence the varied combination discernible in these Psahns is no
                evidence of a metrical structure&#44; or of the existence of the modern stanza in
                Hebrew poetry. To prove the epigrammatical nature of Psalm cxi.&#44; let us adduce a
                translation &#58; &#34; Praise ye the Lord. 1. I will thank the Lord with all my
                heart&#44; In the midst of the righteous&#44; and the assembly. 2. Great are the
                deeds of the Lord&#44; Understood by all who search therein. 3. Glorious and
                beautiful is his work&#44; And his righteousness endureth forever. 4. He causeth his
                wonders to be remembered&#44; Gracious and merciful is the Lord. 6. Food He gave to

                Redemption He sent unto his people. He established his covenant unto everlasting

                we can readily see the independent struc&#8211; ture of the Psalm&#44; and we must
                be tarther convinced that the poet himself did not mean to attach himself to the
                artificial form of the more modern writers. In <pb n="16"/> 16 HEBREW POETRY.
                what&#44; then&#44; is Hebrew poetry distinguished from prose&#63; In this&#44; that
                it consists in an elevated style of diction&#44; in a rapid transition from point to
                point&#44; till the image before the mind&#39;s eye of the poet is completed with
                all the individuality and character which are required of the poetic mode&#44;
                whereas He&#8211; brew prose is&#44; like that of other languages&#44; diffuse and
                circumstantial in its details. The manner of ef&#8211; fecting this description is
                by dividing the idea as it appears generally in two parts&#44; occasionally in three
                or four&#44; and presenting it in contrast with the oppo&#8211; site idea&#44; or
                varying it by describing it in other though synonymous words&#44; so as to present
                it in a full and .readily remembered light. As an illustra&#8211; tion&#44; let us
                take the commencement of the Psalm XXX. &#58; &#34; I will extol Thee&#44; O Lord
                &#33; because Thou hast lifted me up&#44; And didst not suffer my foes to rejoice
                over me.&#34; David means to represent himself as thanking God for a signal
                deliverance&#44; and this idea is complete in the first part of the verse&#59; but
                to give it more inten&#8211; sity&#44; he adds another feature&#44; another motive
                of grati&#8211; tude&#44; that his enemies had not been gratified by his downfall.
                And after enlarging on this thought&#44; and awakening himself and others to
                feelings of devotion&#44; he says &#58; &#34; For his anger is momentary&#44; In his
                favour is life&#44; &#8212; In the evening cometh weeping&#44; But in the morning
                there is rejoicing.&#34; To illustrate how all is depending on divine dispen&#8211;
                sation&#44; he contrasts the effects of God&#39;s auger and those <pb n="17"/>
                HEBREW POETRY. 17 of liis mercy&#44; and says that evil and death are the re&#8211;
                sults of the anger of God&#44; which hists but a moment&#44; for the Lord loves not
                to inflict sufferings on his crea&#8211; tures&#44; whilst life is long
                enduring&#44; being the eflect of God&#39;s favour. If then we are threatened with
                evil&#44; which&#44; as it were&#44; would seem to sojourn with us in the
                evening&#44; we should not despair&#44; as it will be chased away by the joy of
                deliverance&#44; which is sure to come in the morning&#44; if but the favour of the
                Most High is invoked by us. Is not this idea well managed and beautifully expressed
                &#63; Is it not full of poetic fire&#44; without the aid of rhyme or measure&#63; It
                is true that a translation&#44; ever so carefully made&#44; cannot convey in full
                the whole force of the Hebrew&#44; because we cannot find equivalent words in any
                modern language. We are therefore unable to give&#44; as it ought to be done&#44;
                the epigrammatic i3X3 j&#59;j&#8211;i &#39;j &#34; For one moment He is

                favour&#44;&#34; in English&#44; without losing the point therein conveyed. Our
                translation is a mere approach to the original&#44; though far from reaching it. In
                modern languages the poet is bound to preserve strictly the identity of persons and
                numbers with which he commences&#59; or if he should deviate&#44; he must use such
                means of indicating the change as are customary In the language in which he writes.
                At the time&#44; however&#44; of the early Hebrews&#44; these aids were not known
                &#59; and as the intention was to express thoughts&#44; more than dwell long upon
                the arrange&#8211; ment&#44; we discover sudden changes from person to person&#44;
                and from tlie singular to the plural&#44; which very often cause some trouble to the
                translator. Let us instance the second Psalm&#44; one of those which 2&#42; <pb

                been variously explained&#44; to suit the particular views of certain sects. &#34;
                &#34;Why do the nations rage&#44; And people imagine vain things&#63; They stand
                up&#44; the kings of the earth&#44; And rulers take counsel Against the Lord and
                against his anointed.&#34; Here we find the poet speaking of the rage and the
                devices of the gentiles against the Lord&#44; that is&#44; against the peace and
                well&#8211;being of his anointed king&#44; probably David himself. He speaks of them
                in the third person&#44; and tlien at once introduces them as speaking without
                giving us any farther indication of the change of the speakers&#44; than what the
                context affords. He makes them say &#58; &#34; Let us tear asunder their bonds&#44;
                And let us throw from us their cords.&#34; He then introduces another actor&#44; the
                Lord him&#8211; self&#44; as if looking on at these vain endeavours&#44; smiling in
                derision at their presuming to thwart his counsel&#58; &#34; He that is enthroned in
                heaven laugheth&#44; The Lord holdeth them in derision. Then He will speak to them
                in his anger. And with his wrath He will ten&#8211;ify them.&#34; Again another
                speaker is brought forward&#44; and the Lord&#44; just introduced as acting&#44;
                then speaks&#58; &#34;And I have appointed my king &#8212; oven I&#44; Upon

                verse contains the rebuke of the Lord for the daring of the gentiles to disturb the
                prince whom He had chosen. Again David speaks &#58; &#34; I will declare it as an
                ordinance&#44; The Lord said unto me&#44; Thou art my son. This day have I begotten
                thee. Demand of me&#44; and I will give nations for thy heritage&#44; And for thy

                Like a potter&#39;s vessel thou shalt dash them.&#34; Having thus announced what
                w&#58;as the will of God&#44; he turns round to the kings of whom he at first
                spoke&#44; and addresses to them the following warning &#58; &#34; And now&#44; ye
                kings I reflect well&#44; Be instructed&#44; ye judges of the earth&#33; Serve the

                &#94;3 in the signification of son is found but once in Hebrew &#40;Prov. xxxi.
                2&#41; &#59; still this once is enough to justify our version. Kasheku may be

                would have been little trouble to accept the Eabbinical commen&#8211; tary&#44; had
                it not been for the endeavour of the adherents of the Naza&#8211; rene to prove his
                messiahship&#44; for no better reason than that he called himself&#44; or was called
                by his followers&#44; a son of God. But if this be the whole evidence of his
                claim&#44; it rests on the weakest foundation&#59; for ho first must prove that he
                is the son in question&#44; before he can ask of the world&#44; and Israel in
                particular&#44; to acknowl&#8211; edge his rule. The running commentary given above
                will&#44; it is believed&#44; clearly prove that the Psalmist describes the
                conspiracy of the gentiles against acknowledging the rule of the Lord&#39;s
                anointed&#44; and that be simply warns them against disobedience&#59; and no
                individual can&#44; therefore&#44; assert that this proves th.it he is meant&#44;
                mcrely because &#34; the son of God&#34; is spoken of as the one whose rule the
                nations are to acknowledge&#44; if they wish to avoid the wrath of the Lord. There
                is no occasion for an Israelite to decry the correctness of the common version&#44;

                the honour of the Messiahship&#44; which is founded erroneously on this text. A

                denounced the rebels against the Lord&#44; who merit his wrath in opposing his

                a pleasing task to go into a full exam&#8211; ination of the Psalms&#44; and exhibit
                their meaning in a clearer light than the ordinary translation affords&#59; but the

                Let us proceed&#44; therefore&#44; to the matter and subject of the poetic remains
                of the ancient Israelites. They consist&#44; with few exceptions&#44; of hymns&#44;
                prayers&#44; conversations&#44; proverbs&#44; descrip&#8211; tions&#44; and
                narratives. Epics and dramas we have none&#44; and what is more&#44; it is very
                doubtful whether these difiicult branches of poetry were invented con&#8211;
                temporaneously with the Bible&#44; or&#44; if they had been&#44; whether they would
                have been congenial to the genius of the Hebrew seers and psalmists. It was not
                their province to glorify the deeds of man&#44; nor to exhibit the vices of his
                nature and the various passions which ajxitate him for the amusement and instruction
                of the public &#59; besides which&#44; it was incompatible with their fiery nature

                measured and closely de&#8211; fined bounds&#44; as is required in the epic and

                more modern times have feigned to do&#44; in laying before the world their highly
                artificial numbers&#44; as the outpourings of a freely gushing etibrt of genius. Our
                poets did not alone seeia to speak extemporaneously&#44; but actually did so&#59;
                their ardour was not feigned&#44; but real&#59; their imagery was not looked after
                to be imitated in the words of tlieir verses&#44; as several celebrated lines in
                profane wu&#39;iters prove to have been done by others&#44; but was&#44; so to
                say&#44; snatched up from the iield of na&#8211; ture around them and from the soul
                within&#44; as they felt themselves Avarmed by the contemplation of the subject&#44;
                which stood prominently before their mind. It is owing to this&#44; that nothing
                ever equalled the beauty of the diction of our hymns&#44; and elegies&#44; and moral
                lessons&#59; they are true to nature&#44; and tind a response in every feeling
                breast. Let us take an example of the terrible exhibition of God&#39;s power as
                instanced in his workings on earth by his messengers&#44; the wind&#44; the
                fire&#44; the rain&#44; and other aerial phenomena &#58; &#34;And the earth shook

                heavens and went down. And a cloud of darkness was under his feet.&#34; How
                beautifully sublime &#33; God is represented as hearing the prayer of the
                oppressed&#44; as was the case <pb n="23"/> HEBREW POETRY. 23 when the Egyptians

                for ages&#44; feel themselves moved to their very centre&#44; and are terrified at
                the impending storm. The Psalmist disdains to ascribe the clouds charged with
                thunder and destruction to exhalations from the earth&#44; to a silent working of
                nature&#59; no&#44; he at once ascends to nature&#39;s God&#44; and he represents
                Ilim as issuing forth fire and burning flames&#44; which are soon to hasten along on
                their deadly mission. In describing the gathering of the storm&#44; he does not say
                that the sky became overcast&#44; but as though God were bending down the heaven
                above to make it approach nearer the earth&#44; and He then descends with his feet
                enveloped with the thick clouds with which lie means to execute his purpose. In this

                DEVELOPMENT. Ladies and Gentlemen &#33; There is perhaps not one duty enjoined by
                our re&#8211; ligion which is more than all others consonant to the human heart like
                that of prayer. This is not indeed &#42; Being a lecture delivered before the Hebrew
                Literary Asso&#8211; ciation of Philadelphia&#44; at their room&#44; on Thursday
                evening&#44; May 22d&#44; 5611. 3&#42; 30 ON PRAYER. based upon the conviction that
                we shall obtain that for which we ask&#44; but upon the full assufance of our entire
                helplessness in all circumstances of life&#44; when we liave to confess that nothing
                within our reach can extri&#40;&#59;ate us from our difficulty and embarrassment. If
                we then look around us and iind that all who are near us are equally powerless with
                ourselves&#44; we natur&#8211; ally cast our eye upward and seek the aid from Above
                which we in vain search for on earth. Reason&#44; cold human reflection&#44; might
                indeed tell us that it is of no use to address the God of all concerning our
                wants&#44; as He must know them&#44; and that if lie were inclined to aid us lie
                would&#44; as He surely can&#44; come to our assistance without our petitioning Him
                beforehand. Hence there are probably those&#44; who exalt the human intellect as a
                species of divinity&#44; who never pray. But if we&#44; as Israelites&#44; or
                believers in revelation in general&#44; have confidence in the Scriptures as they
                have been handed down to us&#44; we cannot so reason nor withhold humbling ourselves
                and asking divine support&#59; for Ave are assured from the highest author&#8211;
                ity which we recognize&#44; that prayer is efficacious&#44; al&#8211; though Ave are
                not told in Avhat manner this is or can be. God is not less omniscient&#44; because
                Ave are taught to pray to Him&#44; nor is He less good&#44; because He awaits our
                humiliation before He grants us relief&#59; but we must assume in general terms&#44;
                that the expression of our wants in prayer is one of the duties incumbent on us&#44;
                and is&#44; in common with all others&#44; a test whether Ave are obedient&#44; and
                thereby deserving the divine favours&#44; or Avhether Ave are obdurate&#44; and
                therefore deserving the continuance of the evil Avhich afflicts us&#44; as a just
                recompense for our transgressing <pb n="31"/> ON PRAYER. 31 in not recognizing the
                divine Power&#44; in whose hand alone our enhxrgement is phxced. Besides this&#44;
                we must naturally regard God as our parent&#44; through whose &#34; it shall be&#34;
                all things came into existence&#44; and among them we&#44; ourselves&#44; the
                sufterers and petitioners. When a child now sees that his parent has wealth&#44; and
                therefore gifts to be&#8211; stow&#44; if he be properly approached &#59; when a son
                dis&#8211; covers that his father has power to aid him in a great difficulty&#44; if
                his favour be but propitiated&#59; if the daughter feels conscious that her
                progenitor is com&#8211; passionate and willing to forgive any offence&#44;
                pro&#8211; vided only she crave for this grace with due submis&#8211; sion and
                humility &#58; what is so natural as that they should emploj&#39; these means&#44;
                that is&#44; petitioning in a proper manner&#44; to obtain of what they stand so
                much in need &#63; It would be deemed the height of folly and obstinacy in a child
                to refuse asking of an earthly parent any favour which this one could and would
                willingly bestow&#44; if it were merely desired in a be&#8211; coming manner. How
                much greater&#44; therefore&#44; is&#8211; this the case when we reflect that the
                Father of all is the One who requires of us&#44; to lay open before Him our wants
                and our sufferings&#44; in order that He may take cognizance of our
                helplessness&#63; For&#44; if man may have accidently wealth to bestow&#44; if he
                may have power to relieve in a few instances&#44; if once in a while he may be
                willing to forgive an injury or trespass without exacting recompense&#44; how
                immeasurably greater is all this with God&#44; who is emphatically Al&#8211; mighty
                and Most High &#59; because his wealth is un&#8211; bounded&#44; and no one will go
                away empty&#8211;handed&#44; for the reason that a preceding one had been already
                    <pb n="32"/> 32 ON PRAYER. supplied&#59; no one need to fear that he will remain
                un&#8211; aided for want of power in Ilim to grant our desire &#59; and finally&#44;
                we dare not think even that we would ask too much of his mercy&#44; when we crave
                forgiveness&#44; because that we might regard our conduct as past pardon and
                atonement&#44; since we are taught that God readily pardons iniquity and passes by
                transgression&#44; and no indication is given that there exists one sin for which
                atonement and free pardon are absolutely denied. Consequently our religion regards
                it as a simple duty&#44; which should never be omitted&#44; to resort at all times
                to prayer&#44; which means in other words that we should daily&#44; ay&#59;
                momentarily&#44; freely ask in becoming language for whatever the circumstances of
                our life may require&#44; be this worldly gifts&#44; en&#8211; largement from
                difficulties&#44; or forgiveness for past olfences. It is not my intention at
                present to treat the subject on purely religious grounds&#44; as 3&#39;ou have asked
                of me a lecture and not a sermon &#59; and perchance the very choice of the theme
                &#34; prayer&#44;&#34; may have been un&#8211; fortunate as altogether too
                religious&#59; but I fancy that the society of which our young friends are
                members&#44; and the character I myself possess&#44; will not render it amiss that
                even a lecture&#44; which means a scientific dissertation&#44; should largely
                partake of a religious nature &#59; since to Israelites their faith forms the basis
                of their actions through life&#44; and there is no possible contingency&#44; during
                their whole existence&#44; where it does not present itself as either approving or
                disap&#8211; proving what they have done&#44; be this in capacity as members of the
                synngogue&#44; household&#44; society&#44; or state. In all these various relations
                our religion is <pb n="33"/> ON PRAYER. 33 present as the priuciple to be
                consulted&#59; hence it and its interests are proper themes for discussion on all
                occasions when we meet for mutual instruction and friendly discussion&#44; that we
                may literally speak of it when we sit in our houses and walk by the way. But there
                is much that is purely scientific connected with the subject&#44; such as the
                history and development of the idea of prayer&#44; the method in which it is
                car&#8211; ried out by us and others&#44; the thoughts entertained of it by various
                classes of individuals&#44; and the man&#8211; ner in which our customary liturgy or
                book of prayers has gradually assumed its present shape&#59; so that there is ample
                scope for many lectures&#44; not to mention one&#44; without exhausting the subject
                scientifically&#44; and with&#8211; out touching once even its religious
                bearing&#44; strictly so called. So let us proceed without farther preface. Whatever
                may be alleged by learned and unlearned pretenders to science and to superior
                knowledge and information&#44; there is no assertion more consonant with truth&#44;
                than that the Pentateuch&#44; and especially the book of the creation. Genesis&#44;
                contains the most ancient account accessible with regard to man and his history.
                Many have endeavoured to throw doubt on the antiquity and authenticity of our
                law&#8211;book&#59; but without going into the inquiry&#44; as foreign to our
                pres&#8211; ent topic&#44; I may assert that no one acquainted with the grammatical
                structure of the Hebrew language&#44; in which&#44; as every one knows&#44; the
                Scriptures are com&#8211; posed&#44; can for a moment admit that the book of
                Gen&#8211; esis is otherwise than the most ancient document of history and religion
                which is at the present day ac&#8211; cessible to us. There may have been more
                ancient ones in times gone by&#59; but if so&#44; they have long since <pb n="34"/>
                34 ON PRAYER. passed out of existence&#39; and we have no reliable ac&#8211; count
                of them&#44; consequently they are of no impor&#8211; tance to us&#44; nor can they
                aid us in any inquiry which we may institute. I will not say&#44; however&#44; that
                it is not possible to bring forward architectural monuments&#44; which by some
                chance may antedate the composition of the book of Genesis&#59; for this is actually
                said to be the case&#44; and I would not hazard to array science against
                religion&#44; and falsify tlie one or the other as incompatible with the existence
                of this other&#44; or that religion and science are incongruous systems. I do not so
                understand my faith&#59; it can let science exist&#44; and still be the sole truth
                unto salvation&#44; free from doubt and error &#59; and the antiquity of Egyptian
                mon&#8211; uments&#44; and the long alleged duration of the dynasties of
                Mizraim&#44; may even be traced in some phrases of the book of Exodus&#44; and the
                only difficulty in the way would be the brief chronology of the eleventh chapter of
                Genesis&#44; which&#44; though I am not able to rec&#8211; oncile it&#44; may still
                be capable of elucidation by some one better familiar with the recesses of history
                than I can profess to be. But in candour I must say&#44; that the great age which is
                claimed for Egypt appears very doubtful to me &#59; for we have nothing&#44;
                absolutely noth&#8211; ing&#44; to mark the progress of man in science and re&#8211;
                ligion&#44; beyond what the monuments themselves pre&#8211; sent&#44; for 80 many
                centuries of the palmiest days of Egyptian glory. Now compare this simple fact with
                the mighty impulse given to society by Abraham&#44; Jacob&#44; and Moses&#44; the
                sudden and still lasting im&#8211; pression made by these teachers in Canaan&#44;
                Syria&#44; and Egypt itself&#44; and it becomes really incredible that the world
                could have stood still&#44; nay&#44; retrograded <pb n="35"/> ON PRAYER. 35 in all
                the essentials of civilization&#44; during the long continuance of so enlightened a
                set of legislators as the sages and priests of Egypt are alleged to have been. But
                we are leaving our subject&#44; and at this rate of progress my address would detain
                you hours instead of minutes &#59; so let us come back to where we started from. It
                was intended to convey that the Scriptures are the most ancient historical and
                religious records&#59; consequently&#44; if we wish to trace any religious idea to
                its first inception&#44; we must as a matter of course refer to them&#44; and but
                little doubt can be entertained of our finding a solution to our inquiry. Many
                people read the Bible as a religious task&#44; so many chapters a day or week&#44;
                little heeding that they survey in this perusal the greatest stores of antiquity. So
                also there are unthinking unbelievers&#44; who look upon the whole word of God as a
                fabrication of ambitious men&#44; and they fix the dates of the various books
                composing it at such times&#44; comparatively modern&#44; as to destroy all
                credibility of its contents. It requires&#44; however&#44; little penetration to
                exhibit the unsoundness of both&#44; unlearned believers&#44; and unwilling learners
                such as skeptics are. The Bible is in good earnest much more than a merely religious
                work&#44; and is&#44; as hinted already&#44; the only reliable source of information
                for the candid antiquarian&#44; and is actually what it pro&#8211; fesses to be&#44;
                a collection of various books composed at great intervals of time in various
                countries&#44; and under the greatest variety of circumstances&#44; and is&#44;
                therefore&#44; not a cunningly forged series of inauthentic documents&#44; but a
                veritable narrative of events&#44; and a contemporaneous exposition of ideas&#44;
                philosophical <pb n="36"/> 36 ON PRAYER. and moral&#44; prevailing at tlie periods
                that the events described took place. If Ave&#44; therefore&#44; wish to trace the
                idea of prayer&#44; we ought&#44; as is consonant with a common&#8211;sense view of
                the question&#44; refer to the Bible to see what it was in its first inception among
                men&#44; and follow it up in its gradual progress till it reaches the development
                which it has attained at the present time. The antediluvian history&#44; short as it
                is&#44; presents us with the first speci&#8211; men of prayer in the reply of Cain
                to God&#44; when he was doomed to exile for the crime of slaying his brother. The
                words&#44; however&#44; which he uses are more of a remonstrance than a
                petition&#44; and exhibit only a reliance on God&#39;s justice as tempered with
                mercy&#44; more than a humiliation of the petitioner him&#8211; self. These are the
                words &#58; &#34; Behold&#44; thou hast ban&#8211; ished me this day from the face
                of the ground&#44; and from thy face shall I be hid&#59; and I shall be a fugitive
                and vagabond on the earth&#59; and it shall come to pass that every one that findeth
                me will slay me.&#34; &#40;Geo. iv. 14.&#41; We are told that rude as this prayer
                seems to us&#44; it was accepted&#44; inasmuch as the first murderer received the
                assurance that he should be protected against the. violence which he dreaded.
                &#8212; It is not to be supposed that the voice of prayer was silent during all the
                centuries that elapsed from Cain to jSToah&#44; al&#8211; thouo&#8211;h we have no
                recorded evidence to prove this. The next case we have is in the second progenitor
                of our species&#44; who&#44; awaking from the sleep produced by his having drunk the
                product of the first vineyard mentioned in history&#44; pronounced a malediction on
                the disobedient child&#44; and a blessing on those who had pitied their father and
                shielded him in his un&#8211; <pb n="37"/> ON PKAYER. 37 conscious exposure. The
                language employed what poetical&#58; &#34;Blessed be the Lord&#44; thy Shem&#59; and
                Canaan shall be a servant to them&#44; may God enlarge the boundaries of
                Japheth&#44; and may he dwell in the tents of Shem&#59; and Canaan shall be a
                servant unto them.&#34; &#40;Gen. ix. 26&#44; 27.&#41; There is even here but little
                elevation of idea&#59; there appears much of impulse and little of deliberation
                &#59; still taking it as a prophecy and an indication of future events&#44; it is
                not the less important than though it had been couched in the magnificent language
                of Moses&#44; or the sweet poetry of David. But the next instance of prayer is quite
                of a differ&#8211; ent order. It is indeed a remonstrance against a pre&#8211; sumed
                injustice &#59; nevertheless the language is exceed&#8211; ingly deferential to the
                divine Majesty&#44; and exhibits that the petitioner felt his extreme lowness in
                thus in&#8211; terceding for others. I allude&#44; as you probably know already&#44;
                to the prayer of Abraham for the sinful in&#8211; habitants of Sodom.&#42; He sets
                out&#44; after being told that almighty Justice would take cognizance of the doings
                of the doomed city&#44; with saying &#58; &#34; Wilt Thou then destroy the righteous
                with the wicked &#63; Perad&#8211; venfcure there be fifty righteous within the
                city&#59; wilt Thou then also destroy and not spare the place for the sake of the
                fifty righteous that are therein &#63; Far be it from Thee to do after this
                manner&#44; to slay the right&#8211; eous with the wicked&#44; so that the righteous
                should be &#42; I omitted&#44; it appears&#44; the petition of Abraham for
                Ishmael&#44; &#8211;when the birth of Isaac was announced to him. &#40;Gen. xvii.
                18.&#41; Perhaps the remonstrance of the patriarch &#40;ib. xv. 2&#8211;8&#41; may
                also be regarded a similar prayer. VOL. X. 4 <pb n="38"/> 38 ON PRAYER. wicked; from
                Thee &#59; shall the Judge earth not exercise justice&#63;&#34; It is not nec&#8211;
                y to recite the whole of this passage&#44; which is contained in the eighteenth
                chapter of Genesis&#44; to which you are referred &#59; but on inspection it will
                ap&#8211; pear that it contains the main elements of a proper petition&#44; as we
                have sketched it in our introduction&#44; acknowledgment of divine power and of
                human in&#8211; feriority&#44; or what is the same thing&#44; placing the de&#8211;
                liverance or exemption from the evil entirely in the hands of God&#44; and only
                requesting of his attribute of mercy or justice a release from threatened or
                pass&#8211; ing evils. With Abraham&#44; therefore&#44; we have the first
                prayer&#44; in the proper sense of the word&#44; on record&#44; and by it we may
                freely frame any petition for our&#8211; selves&#44; of which we may feel that we
                stand in need. Subsequent to this we have no example of prayer prior to Jacob&#44;
                unless we may so construe the bless&#8211; ings of Isaac to his children&#44; which
                are in efiect in&#8211; vocations of the divine aid to do an act of mercy to those
                whom he wished especially placed under his protection. The words are again put in a
                poetical garb&#44; and assume a higher elevation than mere naked prose&#44; such as
                Abraham used&#44; although they bear in this respect no comparison with the
                productions of his own immediate son and remoter descendants. But if we recur to the
                history of Jacob&#44; we shall find the idea of prayer already farther developed
                than it was in his ancestors&#44; as in everything else relating to religion he
                exhibits the confirmed character of one to whom faith and virtue were inherited
                traits of character&#44; and not merely the acquisitions of a strong though
                untutored mind. The prayer to which refer&#8211; <pb n="39"/> ON PRAYER. 39 ence is
                made is found in the thirty&#8211;second chapter of Genesis. Jacob was on his return
                from his long resi&#8211; dence with Laban&#44; and dreaded to meet his brother&#44;
                whom he had obtained by obtaining&#44; upwards of twenty years before&#44; the
                blessing of their father origi&#8211; nally intended for him&#44; the
                first&#8211;born. The last of the patriarchs had numerous followers to oppose
                Esau&#39;s violence with the sword likewise&#59; but he revolted from such a
                thought&#44; and he justly conceived that One like him&#44; who had been shown the
                wonders of the Creator when he watched at night&#44; under the bril&#8211; liant
                glow of the constellations&#44; which beam and shine with peculiar splendour in the
                beautiful and clear sky of Mesopotamia&#44; the flock of his
                father&#8211;in&#8211;law&#44; would best show that the lesson thus acquired had not
                been lost on him&#44; by resorting to the Giver of all good for support in his
                trouble&#44; and aid under his apprehen&#8211; sion. He therefore spoke &#58; &#34;
                God of my father Abraham&#44; and God of my father Isaac&#44; the Lord who saidst
                unto me. Return unto thy country&#44; and unto thy birthplace&#44; and I will deal
                well with thee &#33; I am not worthy of all the mercies&#44; and of all the truth
                which Thou hast shown unto thy servant&#59; for with my staff I passed over this
                Jordan&#44; and now I am be&#8211; come two bands&#44;&#34; meaning that he had been
                com&#8211; pelled to divide his property on account of its great extent&#44;
                consisting as it did of cattle&#44; camels&#44; and flocks&#44; the usual wealth of
                those days&#44; in two divis&#8211; ions. And he then continues &#58; &#34; Deliver
                me&#44; I pray Thee&#44; from the hand of my brother&#44; from the hand of Esau
                &#59; for I fear him&#44; lest he will come and smite me&#44; the mother with the
                children. And Thou hast said&#44; I will surely do thee good&#44; and make thy <pb

                num&#8211; bered for multitude.&#34; You will see that Jacob does not rely on his
                own merit&#44; but first on the imputed righteousness of his progenitors&#44; who
                emphatically were the worshippers of the true God&#44; amidst an overwhelming number
                of idolaters&#44; so that he was authorized by the Lord himself to call Him the
                pe&#8211; culiar God of Abraham and Isaac. This we are sure was not done to remind
                the Supreme of this well&#8211; known fact&#44; but to awaken himself to a feeling
                of confidence in the same eternal Power&#44; seeing that through so many
                difficulties&#44; whatever they were&#44; his fathers passed unharmed. Was not
                Abraham put in confiict with numerous hordes of invaders&#44; and yet he overcame
                them with his household&#8211;servants alone&#63; &#34;Was not Lot saved from the
                destrution of Sodom&#44; through the merit of the same beloved servant of God &#63;
                Was Isaac not summoned to become a sacri&#8211; fice on the altar&#44; and was not
                his willingness accepted&#44; and a ram received in favour in his stead &#63; And
                now though dano&#8211;cr threatened him from his enras&#8211;ed bro&#8211; ther&#44;
                he could not imagine that God would be untrue to his promise&#44; and allow mother
                and children to fall a prey to the sword&#44; when they had been announced as the
                progenitors of the great nation that was to spring from Abraham. Jacob thus in his
                prayer rouses himself to cast ofl&#34; all apprehension &#59; he feels that the Lord
                would be untrue should extermination befall his family&#59; for himself&#44; the
                decaying stem&#44; he asked nothing&#59; he cared little that he should fall&#44;
                provided only those who were to perpetuate his lineage should survive&#59; and
                therefore&#44; although we do not find that any token of his petition having been
                granted was <pb n="41"/> ON PRAYER. 41 vouchsafed to him&#44; he went forward
                cheerfully&#44; rely&#8211; ing ou the truth of the One who never deceives those who
                put their trust in Him. I have not referred to the prayer which Jacob made when he
                was comforted by the vision of angels as&#8211; cending on a ladder&#44; and
                descending thereby&#44; as it is more in the nature of a conditional vow&#44; nor is
                it necessary for our object that we should introduce every verse which has the shape
                of entreaty into our discussion. It is enough for our purpose that we can prove that
                from the earliest period of the history of our race&#44; which properly commences
                with the Meso&#8211; potamian shepherd Abraham&#44; and will yet stretch far&#8211;
                ther onward till mankind shall be no more on earth&#44; if this catastrophe be
                actually impending&#44; or whilst any other family of men live in this world&#44;
                prayer in its fullest sense was prevalent among us&#44; and that we are furnished
                from the earliest periods with models not alone iit for imitation&#44; but which
                cannot be im&#8211; proved upon either in simplicity of language or the sublimity of
                ideas which they convey. It must be evident that when we address the Deity two
                thino&#8211;s must be avoided&#44; familiarity and vulgarity on the one side&#44;
                and high&#8211;sounding phrases and pompous expres&#8211; sions on the other.
                Language here&#44; as in every other case&#44; ought to be in consonance with the
                object in view&#59; hence the propriety of having our ideas clothed in chaste and
                dignified words&#44; in a style not too or&#8211; nate&#44; as though we wish to
                display our learning&#44; when approaching the throne of Grace. If we proceed onward
                in our investigation&#44; and contemplate the productions of Moses&#44; the father
                of all the sages and prophets of Israel&#44; we shall find him 4&#42; <pb n="42"/>
                42 ON PRAYER. eminently successful iu all the essentials we have just laid down.
                Examine the sublime prayer which he offered up to God when Israel had fallen into
                idol&#8211; atry&#44; and you will see that it is almost identical in its elements
                with that of Jacob just discussed. Like him&#44; Moses does not claim any merit for
                himself or people &#59; he only refers to the merits of the patriarchs&#44; and to
                the divine promise of the Lord of perpetuat&#8211; ing their descendants&#44;
                maintaining them on earth as his people and witnesses. He had indeed been told that
                entreaty would be useless&#44; so great was their transgression&#59; but he
                considered justly that the di&#8211; vine mercy far outweighs human guilt&#44; and
                forgives where justice demands the extermination of the transgressor. If we take in
                view this twofold quality&#44; if it be permitted to use such a term&#44; of our
                God&#44; as He is the Judge and the Merciful at the same time &#58; we shall perhaps
                be able to explain away the diffi&#8211; culty which presents itself in reading the
                thirty&#8211;second chapter of Exodus&#44; where the Lord&#44; on seeing that the
                Israelites had made the golden calf&#44; said to Moses that he should not pray&#44;
                but leave his anger to be kindled against them&#44; that they might be consumed.
                Moses&#44; however&#44; disregarded the injunction&#44; and asked&#44; and obtained
                a remission of the guilt. We may&#44; in this connexion&#44; freely assume that we
                are presented here merely with the contest between jus&#8211; tice and mercy.
                Justice demanded the severest pun&#8211; ishment&#44; which was that the erring and
                rebellious race should cease to exist&#59; but Mercy&#44; through the prophet&#44;
                pleaded for a mitigation of the evil&#44; inas&#8211; much as this would best carry
                out the promise to the patriarchs&#44; which we have already considered. Time <pb
                    n="43"/> ON PRAYER. 43 prevents me to&#8211;night from enlarging on this
                point&#44; which would require a long dissertation by itself&#59; so work out for
                yourselves the hint given you&#44; and no doubt but the subject will be as clear to
                you as any other which refers to the thoughts of the One above&#44; whom we can only
                approach&#44; but never reach in our mortal state. We know that Moses&#39;s prayer
                was ac&#8211; cepted&#44; and the doom was averted from the mass&#44; though many
                suffered &#59; since no guilt&#44; as we are told&#44; can be passed over without
                some punishment being inflicted on the sinners. The ninetieth psalm&#44; which is
                headed &#8212; &#34; A Prayer of Moses&#44; the man of God&#44;&#34; is every way
                worthy of the great prophet. It exhibits the Creator as the Producer of the
                universe&#44; and still as the Protector of every individual man on earth. Often as
                this idea comes before us in investigating any religious truth&#44; its importance
                is such that we cannot recur to it too often. Whether&#44; therefore&#44; we wish to
                elucidate that God is the Providence&#44; the Governor&#44; the Judge&#44; the
                Rewarder&#44; the Avenger&#44; or the Hearer of prayer&#44; it is always to be
                considered that He is especially watch&#8211; ful over all&#44; from his very nature
                as the Omnipresent and Almighty&#44; not as though He recpiired any special effort
                of power or vigilance to execute his wish in general or in detail&#44; on earth or
                in heaven. The prophet next sketches the eternity of God&#44; and the perishableness
                of man. He says &#58; &#34; For a thousand years arc in thy eyes as the
                yesterday&#44; when it passeth&#44; and as a watch of the night. Thou strewest them
                &#40;men&#41; out&#44; they spring up in sleep&#59; in the morning man sprouteth
                forth like grass&#59; in the morning he bloometh and sprouteth&#44; in the evening

                understanding to comprehend his existence and relation to God&#44; asks for mercy
                and the avertance of evil&#44; and closes with invoking protection and permanence
                for the work in which he was engaged&#44; probably the sanctuary&#44; which he was
                the means of erecting in the wilderness. You will find in the whole of this
                extremely beautiful psalm nothing mean&#44; no idea unworthy of acceptance&#59;
                so&#44; on the other hand&#44; there is no laboured attempt to glorify God&#44;
                &#8212; nothing but the gushing forth of simple and natural language of the highest
                order&#44; to express the emotions of his soul. The Psalms of David&#44; of
                Assaph&#44; of the sons of Xorah&#44; and other sweet singers of Israel&#44;
                are&#44; as may well be expected&#44; strictly made after the model of Moses. Though
                the Psalmists wrote on a great vari&#8211; ety of occasions&#44; and&#44; if critics
                may be believed&#44; at great intervals of time&#44; they always kept before them
                the illustrious and holy men who first taught us by their examples how to pray. I
                would gladly analyze specimens of each &#59; but the time to do so would be quite
                too long for a single lecture. But this much is certain&#44; that in the Book of
                Psalms we have a collec&#8211; tion of devotional exercises far exceeding in
                value&#44; both as regards their influence on the spirit and their stylistic
                excellence&#44; anything within the whole range of literature. Many have been the
                attempts to add by new compositions to the store in our possession&#59; and though
                some have rare merit&#44; they have not yet equalled the legacy of the ancients.
                &#34;With this I do not mean to assert that the psalms and prayers scat&#8211; tered
                through the Bible have exhausted the subject&#44; or that there are not occasions
                for which they might <pb n="46"/> ON PRAYER. 46 be considered inappropriate &#59;
                but we must not forget that we were never interdicted employing our own words to
                address our Maker&#59; and I only wish to maintain the simple truth&#44; that the
                biblical prayers are the best in existence&#44; and should alone serve as models by
                which we should frame our thoughts and combine our words&#44; so as to lay before
                God a prayer or thanksgiving worthy of his acceptance&#44; which we are assured it
                will be&#44; if duly offered with sincerity and devotion. It is perhaps impossible
                at the present day to ascer&#8211; tain whether&#44; during the existence of the
                first temple&#44; a set form of prayer was in use among us. Tlie Psalms&#44; or a
                portion at least&#44; existed in a separate collection&#44; and no doubt were used
                as devotional exercises&#59; but we know nothing of this with any degree of
                certainty. According to 1 Chronicles xxv.&#44; it appears that David appointed
                certain musicians and their assistants to sing and play at the house of God during
                the service of sacrificing. In 2 Chronicles v. 13&#44; we read that&#44; at the
                dedication of Solomon&#39;s temple&#44; the immense choir then estabhshed duly
                performed the task im&#8211; posed upon them&#44; &#34;praising the Lord who is
                good&#44; for his kindness endureth forever.&#34; And in the same book&#44; chapter
                xxix. 30&#44; we read that Hezekiah and the chiefs ordered the Levites to praise the
                Lord in the words of David and Assaph the seer&#44; which they accord&#8211; ingly
                did. In the reign also of Josiah&#44; xxxv. 15&#44; we see that the singers were at
                their post&#44; according to the ordinance of David&#44; Assaph&#44; Ileman&#44; and
                Jeduthuu the king&#39;s seer&#59; all which proves the probability at least
                that&#44; with the music thus traditionally brought down during the whole series of
                the Davidean kings&#44; <pb n="46"/> 46 ON PRAYER. the prayers of his composing and
                those of his asso&#8211; ciates&#44; the world&#8211;renowned Assaph and Heman&#44;
                and their contemporaries&#44; were also in practical use&#44; not alone at the
                temple&#44; but likewise among the people. If&#44; however&#44; the idea of regular
                prayer was not developed so early as the first temple&#44; we shall have no such
                difiiculty of arriving at the fact immediately after its destruction. It is probable
                enough that no sooner were the daily sacrifices abolished by the vio&#8211; lent
                irruption of the Chaldeans under Nebuchadnez&#8211; zar and his chief guardsman
                JSTebuzaraddan&#44; than the pious of Israel resorted to prayer as a suitable
                substi&#8211; tute&#44; knowing as they did that &#34; the sacrifices of God are a
                broken spirit&#44;&#34; and that &#34; obedience is better than the fat of
                rams.&#34; They came to the conclusion that&#44; with the abolition of the daily
                oblations on the altar at Jerusalem&#44; the permanence of Israel and the salvation
                of the pious were by no means forfeited. Hence they resorted to periodical
                prayer&#44; at those hours&#44; we may assume&#44; when the priests formerly brought
                the offerings to the door of the temple. Hence therefore the morning and
                afternoon&#8211;service &#59; add to this the obligation of speaking of the law
                &#34; when we lie down&#44;&#34; whence accordingly the evening&#8211;prayer. On
                referring to Daniel vi. 11&#44; you will find&#44; that &#34; when Daniel learned
                that the decree against praying had been signed by the king Darius&#44; or&#44; as
                he is called in the Bible&#44; Daryawesh the Median&#44; he went to his house where
                he had windows in his upper chamber which looked towards Jerusalem&#44; and three
                times every day he fell on his knees&#44; and prayed and praised before his God&#44;
                just as he had been doing before that time.&#34; If even this practice was customary
                with <pb n="47"/> ON PRAYER. 47 Daniel only&#44; which it would be absurd to
                suppose&#44; it soon spread to others&#44; as there is no doubt that the

                noon&#44; and evening&#8211;prayers&#44; are institutions existing during the second
                temple&#44; for which purpose the synagogues were erected not alone in the country
                of Palestine&#44; but Jerusalem&#44; the seat of the temple&#44; also&#44; and were
                thus established that the people might as&#8211; semble and pray in a body&#44;
                having their Sheliach Zib&#8211; biir&#44; or messenger of the congregation&#44;
                &#8212; now called Chazan&#44; or superintendent of the worship&#44; &#8212; to read
                aloud certain portions&#44; to which the people responded&#44; or listened in
                silence to be in readiness to answer Amen to the portions called Berachoth&#44; or
                blessings&#44; in case they could not recite the prayers themselves&#44; from
                ignorance of the words they should use. The Chazan thus acted mediatorially for the
                uninformed&#44; and the responses they made were considered equiv&#8211; alent to
                praying themselves&#59; hence the custom of repeating aloud the Shemonay
                &#39;Essray&#44; or eighteen benedictions&#44; otherwise called the &#39;Amidah
                &#40;from &#39;Amad&#44; to stand&#44; they being recited in an upright
                posture&#41;&#44; after they have been read by all able to read&#44; each one to
                himself&#44; in a low tone of voice. Hence also the formulas of Kedushah&#44;
                Kaddish&#44; Bahrechu&#44; and similar pieces. From Ezra iii. 10&#44; 11&#44; and
                Nehemiah xii. 45&#44; 46&#44; it appears that the ancient institution of David&#44;
                that is&#44; the Psalms&#44; was duly revived at the rebuilding of the temple&#44;
                and also that the law was publicly read in the street from a wooden stand by
                Ezra&#44; and that it was interpreted and expounded by his assistants&#44; who are
                recorded in Nehemiah viii. 7. Having thus clear <pb n="48"/> 48 ON PRAYER. proof
                that the temple was the place where the Psalms were chauntcd&#44; and that other
                localities were used to instruct the people&#44; we have at once the twofold
                ele&#8211; ment of Jewish worship&#44; &#8212; the temple for sacrifice and musical
                accompaniment&#44; &#8212; and the place of assembly&#44; whether this was a stand
                temporarily erected in the street to have much room&#44; or a separate building
                specially devoted to worship&#44; for prayer&#44; praise&#44; and instruction &#59;
                for we read in verses 5 and 7 of the chapter just now cited &#58; &#34; And Ezra
                opened the book before the eyes of the whole people&#44; for he stood above all the
                people&#59; and as he opened it&#44; all the people stood up&#44;&#34; just as we do
                when the law book is borne to the desk where it is read. &#34; And Ezra praised the
                Lord&#44; the great God&#44; and all the people cried out Amen&#44; Amen&#44; in
                lifting up their hands&#44; and they bowed down their heads&#44; and prostrated
                them&#8211; selves before the Lord with their faces to the ground.&#34; The latter
                observance of prostration is not generally followed among us at the present day&#44;
                except by the Israelites of the German custom on the IsTew Year&#39;s festival and
                the Day of Atonement&#59; but the genu&#8211; flexions&#44; and bowing of the head
                at particular pas&#8211; sages&#44; are yet practised&#44; as you all know &#59; so
                also the responding of Amen at a blessing&#44; or Bcrachah as was done when Ezra
                prayed before the reading of the law&#44; is yet constantly observed among us. If
                there&#8211; fore we freely acknowledge that the praj&#8211;er&#8211;book&#44; as it
                exists at the present hour&#44; is the gradual accumula&#8211; tion of many
                additions to an original simple form&#44; we at the same time claim for it much of
                the highest an&#8211; tiquity&#44; and a uniformity from the earliest return of the
                Israelites from the Babylonian captivity. <pb n="49"/> ON PRAYER. 49 It may be
                assumed as doubtful whether any one now living could determine with accuracy
                whether&#44; in the early days of our history&#44; any set form of prayer or liturgy
                was in use&#44; except the reading of portions of the sixth and eleventh chapters of
                Deute&#8211; ronomy&#44; and of the sixteenth of Numbers&#44; known collectively as
                the Shemang&#44; so called from the initial words of the first of these sections
                commencing with the words Shemang Yisi&#8211;ael&#44; &#34; Hear&#44; O Israel.&#34;
                It is more than probable that&#44; though prayer was always a duty&#44; the wording
                of it was left voluntary with each individual. When&#44; however&#44; at the return
                from Baby&#8211; lon&#44; the pure Hebrew had ceased to be the spoken language of
                the people&#44; and when&#44; we have every reason to judge from JS&#39;ehemiah&#44;
                no proper dialect was prevalent&#44; but a sort of Lingua Franca&#44; a com&#8211;
                pound of Hebrew&#44; Persian&#44; Aramaic&#44; and Phoenician&#44; and afterwards of
                Greek and Latin &#58; it became evi&#8211; dently the business of the Sanhedrin&#44;
                or Synedrion&#44; &#8212; those who both superintended the aflairs of the state and
                the interests of religion&#44; to introduce a formulary of prayer written in the old
                Hebrew&#44; so as to pre&#8211; serve the connexion with ancient Israel&#44; and to
                main&#8211; tain the purity of the law in its original&#44; uncorrupted&#44;
                traditional text&#44; and to add also pieces in the popular speech of the
                people&#44; chiefly Aramaic&#44; that they might understand&#44; without
                interpretation from the Meturg&#8211; eman or translator&#44; the words of praise
                which the Sheliach Zibbur uttered. &#34;We have several such fras&#58;&#8211; ments
                of prayers &#59; one the celebrated Kaddish&#44; evi&#8211; dently of great
                antiquity&#44; from all absence of allusion to Roman or gentile supremacy&#44; and
                the other the Ye&#47;cum Parkan Min Shemayah&#44; a petition for the peace <pb

                the welfare of the individual congregation where it is recited or used&#44; among
                the German Jews. There are other Aramaic pieces scattered through the prayers&#44;
                but it would take too long to quote them now. The most learned can only hazard
                conjecture&#59; but it is not reasonable to suppose that at any time great and
                violent changes could be introduced into Juda&#8211; ism. No one acquainted with the
                character and dis&#8211; position of our people&#44; and the pertinacity with which
                even small changes are opposed and little matters conserved&#44; can for a moment
                imagine that prayer three times a day could ever have been introduced&#44; unless
                the custom had always been more or less prev&#8211; alent&#44; as was the
                sacrificing twice or three times every day in the temple. The only difficulty in the
                case is the amount of pieces which are to be recited&#44; and in them&#44; even at
                the present moment&#44; the greatest di&#8211; versity of views prevails. If we&#44;
                however&#44; take up the prayer&#8211;book and examine it by the internal evidence
                of style&#44; we shall be able to determine pretty accu&#8211; rately the age of the
                various component parts. We need not expect the elevation of diction to be found in
                the ancient portions of the Bible&#59; for&#44; as said&#44; the Hebrew had ceased
                to be the vernacular tongue&#44; and was therefore merely the language of the
                learned&#44; or the priesthood and scholars. Still we can trace the gradual
                deterioration of the style&#44; until it received a new impulse&#44; first by the
                Asiatic school of neo&#8211;Heb&#8211; raico poets&#44; such as Kalir and Rabbi
                JSTissim of Baby&#8211; lon&#44; and afterwards by the writers of Spain and the
                Barbary coast&#59; for instance. Rabbi Jehudah llallevi&#44; R. Shelomah Ibn

                stand&#8211; ard&#44; and taking into account the hints regarding the blessings
                found in Mishnah and Talmud&#44; we must characterize as most ancient Elohai
                Neshamah&#44; to&#8211; gether with the benedictions and petitions till
                Vai&#47;e&#8211; c&#47;abber of the German Minhag&#44; which are also found&#44;
                though in a somewhat different order&#44; among the Sephardim or Portuguese. The
                subsequent portions till Yishtabbach&#44; except Barueh Sheamar&#44; are either
                se&#8211; lections from Bible&#44; Mishnah&#44; and Talmud&#44; or entire psalms and
                passages from Scripture. But from Yish&#8211; tabbach till the end of the
                &#39;Amidah or Shemonay &#39;Essrat&#47;&#44; with the exception of some
                interpolated pieces&#44; the whole is of high antiquity&#44; and is regarded as a
                preface and conclusion to Shemang&#44; and the &#39;Amidah is then joined to the
                last as the close of the prayers proper. The form for Nejilath Apayim or falling on
                the face&#44; which ceremony in full is not now in vogue&#44; is only in a small
                portion original&#44; as ilU the Minhagira em&#8211; ploy a Psalm&#44; and the
                variety of the phraseology of the various readings shows that modern additions and
                changes have taken place. The prayers proper were concluded with &#39;Alenu
                Ijcshabcach&#44; both in style and substance beautiful and forcible in the extreme.
                The same process of investigation will show us the portions of the evening and
                night&#8211;prayers which are from early ages&#59; and we may freely appeal to any
                one critically acquainted with the Hebrew&#44; to confess whether this hypothesis
                has not every appearance of correctness. I only wish that time would permit to <pb
                    n="52"/> 52 ON PRAYER. analyze the whole in your presence. But this being out of
                the question&#44; I must hasten to complete what I meant to advance. In going over
                the legacy of our fathers which our various Tefilloth&#44; Siddurim&#44; or
                prayer&#8211;books &#40;all these terms being synonymous&#41; afford&#44; the candid
                inquirer will be convinced that as little as our faith is wanting&#39; in containing
                all practical moral duties&#44; so little are our prayers wanting in all that is
                spiritual and soul&#8211; elevating. It is true that&#44; for those who have not
                leisure&#44; the forms are somewhat long&#44; at least as they now exist&#59; but
                this does not say that to the pious and devout soul they are too long&#44; or that a
                man properly alive to his position towards the Most High should not love to spend a
                considerable portion of his day in exercises of devotion&#44; by which he will live
                more in&#44; so to say&#44; a friendly intercourse with his Maker&#44; rather than
                think it a burden when he has to pray&#44; and which he cannot too quickly throw
                ofl&#34; from his shoulders. But those who were compelled to labour for their
                support&#44; and who were in imminent danger&#44; and therefore not able to fix
                their minds in devotion&#44; were not expected to recite the usual&#44; but a much
                shorter form. Permit me to give you the two forms which are already mentioned in the
                Talmud&#44; and thus accepted as authoritative. To premise&#44; let me call your
                attention to the fact that the various &#39;Am&#8211; idah&#8211;forms&#44; for all
                the year&#44; differing as they do&#44; all commence with the same three
                benedictions&#44; and con&#8211; clude Avith three others of the same tenor. The
                first refers to the covenant with the patriarchs&#44; the second to the universality
                of God&#39;s power&#44; and the third to his holiness. Of the last three&#44; the
                first speaks of <pb n="53"/> ON PRAYER. 53 the service&#44; which we pray may be
                acceptable&#59; the second is the general form of thanksgiving&#44; and the third is
                a petition for universal peace&#44; as the crowning blessing of all which the Lord
                can bestow. Now the rule is&#44; that when we are in a place of danger we need not
                say the whole of the &#39;Amidah&#44; not even the first and last three
                blessings&#59; but&#44; instead of this&#44; as fol&#8211; lows &#58; &#34; The
                wants of thy people are many&#44; but their knowledge is weak and limited. O&#44;
                may it please Thee&#44; OLord our God&#33; to give to each individual his
                maintenance&#44; and to every creature whatever he may stand in need of&#59; do&#44;
                however&#44; as seemeth best to Thee in thy wisdom. Blessed art Thou&#44; Lord&#33;
                who hearest prayer.&#34; When the danger&#44; however&#44; is not imminent&#44;
                another formula is required &#59; for then the first three blessings are to be
                recited&#44; after which&#44; &#34; Give us understanding&#44; O Lord&#44; our
                God&#33; to know thy ways&#44; and subject our heart to thy fear&#44; and for&#8211;
                give us our trespasses&#44; send us the redeemer&#44; and remove all diseases from
                us&#59; satisfy us also with the pleasant products of thy earth&#44; and vouchsafe
                to gather our scattered captives from the four corners of the world. Do Thou also
                judge those who go astray from thy law&#44; and raise thy hand over the wicked.
                Cause the righteous to rejoice at the rebuilding of thy city&#44; and the
                restoration of thy temple&#44; and the growing of the horn of David thy servant&#44;
                and the lighting up of the lamp of the son of Jessd&#44; thy anointed. Before we
                call&#44; answer Thou us&#59; while we speak&#44; do Thou hear&#59; for Thou&#44; O
                Lord&#33; re&#8211; deemest and savest in all times of trouble and afflic&#8211;
                tion. Blessed art Thou&#44; Lord &#33; who hearest prayer.&#34; After which&#44; the
                concluding benedictions are to be 5&#42; <pb n="54"/> 54 ON PRAYER. said. Those of
                j&#39;oii&#44; my hearers&#44; who are familiar with our daily service&#44; will
                readily reooguize in the above an epitome of the full eighteen&#44; or rather
                nineteen&#44; benedictions&#44; or&#44; more correctly speaking&#44; the thir&#8211;
                teen between the third and seventeenth of our series. You will readily understand
                that&#44; like the larger &#39;Am&#8211; idah&#44; the prayer Habinemi&#44; as it is
                technically called from the initial word&#44; contains all that man can ask of God
                in his individual and social capacity&#44; to satisfy his daily wants&#44; and to
                bestow on him wisdom&#44; as likewise the spiritual beneiits to be expected in the
                building up of the kingdom of the Messiah&#44; and the restoration of the worship of
                the Lord at Moriah. Let me here remark that it is probable that&#44; whilst the
                temple stood&#44; the clauses relating to worship&#44; and that referring to the
                restoration of Jerusalem&#44; may have been differently worded&#44; to answer the
                then state of things&#44; both in the large and condensed forms. But&#44; either
                during the existence of the Jew&#8211; ish commonwealth or now&#44; there is no
                question that the essence of prayer was known and appreciated among us&#44; and that
                this proceeded&#44; not from oppo&#8211; nents or reformers of Judaism&#44; but from
                its teachers and supporters. We may&#44; to prove this&#44; freely offer our
                liturgy&#44; &#8212; I speak mainly of the most ancient portions&#44; &#8212; and we
                need not fear the verdict of the world. It is&#44; therefore&#44; erroneous to
                assume that true spiritual prayer was invented or revealed by a man who&#44;
                descended from Israelites&#44; has in the pro&#8211; cess of time become the object
                of adoration to a large portion of mankind. I would deem my lecture incomplete&#44;
                were I to omit noticing the assumption of Christians&#44; which&#44; <pb n="55"/> ON
                PRAYER. 55 suicide&#8211;like&#44; some spiritualizing Jews acquiesce iu&#44; that
                the prayers of our neighbours are more spiritual than ours &#59; and as an evidence
                we are referred to the formula called the Lord&#39;s prayer&#44; which is said to
                have been composed by the founder of the iTazarene creed himself. It is found in
                Matthew vi.&#44; and is in these words&#58; &#34;Our Father&#44; which art in
                heaven&#44; hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth&#44;
                as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts&#44;
                as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation&#44; but deliver us from
                evil. For thine is the kingdom&#44; and the power&#44; and the glory&#44;
                forever.&#34; No one will gainsay that this prayer contains correct ideas of
                de&#8211; votion&#44; and conveys them in concise and proper terms. But&#44; from
                what has been said already&#39; this evening&#44; it would be the work of
                supererogation to prove its simple Jewish origin and its conformity with mate&#8211;
                rials in our own possession&#44; and which were in vogue when the man of Nazareth is
                said to have lived on earth. The phrase Abinu Shcbashamayin is so entirely Hebrew
                that no one can mistake it for a moment for one of foreign origin. The Talmudists
                loved to re&#8211; gard God as their Father&#44; in conformity to the Scrip&#8211;
                ture phraseology in a great variety of passages. &#34;Hallowed be thy name&#34; are
                the identical words with which the Kaddish commences&#44; &#8212; Yithgaddal&#44;

                exposition&#44; nothing original in this celebrated Christian prayer&#59; all it can
                claim is that it is a compilation not pos&#8211; sessed by us. But we really doubt
                whether the ideas which it embodies are properly comprehended by those who make use
                of it &#59; since the petition that God&#39;s kingdom should come precludes the
                assump&#8211; tion&#44; that the author of it could have been the Mes&#8211;
                siah&#44; who is destined to advance that very kingdom which is here asked for. But
                it is time that I should conclude. Gladly would I have given you a more carefully

                RESPECTING THE SCRIPTURAL PASSAGES CONTAINED IN THE PRAY&#8211; ERS &#8212; THEIR
                PROPRIETY &#8212; THEIR INFLUENCE &#8212; THE NECESSITY OF RETAINING THEM. Ladies
                and Gentlemen&#33; When last spring I appeared before you by request of the Hebrew
                Literary Association&#44; the theme chosen was that of Prayer. I have now to thank
                you for the strict attention you paid me whilst discussing a sub&#8211; ject so
                extremely dry&#44; and divested of all ornament as that was &#59; and it is this
                kindness which again em&#8211; &#42; Delivered by request of the Hebrew Literary
                Association. 58 ON PRAYER. boldens me to speak on this topic somewhat more at
                length. It is certainly encouraging to a public teacher to tind that it is not
                merely high&#8211;seasoued food which pleases the people&#39;s taste&#59; though
                there are so many who regard ornament and figurative language as alone fitted to be
                addressed to the popular ear&#44; and there is&#44; unfortunately&#44; not wanting a
                class of hearers&#44; to whom nothing else can afford the least pleasure. Plain
                truths&#44; plainly spoken&#44; are not always agree&#8211; able&#59; and tlie more
                disguised wholesome instruction is conveyed&#44; the more gratification do the
                unthinking display. Still it must be evident that a lecture which is&#44; or ought
                to be&#44; a dissertation on some scientific subject&#44; ought to partake largely
                of the severity and exactness of an argument&#44; where the reason and not the fancy
                should naturally preside. &#34;When a man rises before an audience to excite their
                sympathy&#44; to rouse their passions&#44; to awaken their good or bad feelings&#44;
                he may then deal freely in the flowers of oratory&#44; employ metaphor and
                allegory&#44; poetry and parable&#44; to rivet their attention. But even then he
                should be sparing of the glitter of fine words&#44; if he at all desires that his
                hearers should think him in earnest&#44; and not be led to the conclusion that all
                his excitement is but mere pretence&#44; all his elevation the product of cold
                study&#59; since the vehemence of pas&#8211; sion and the energy of
                high&#8211;wrought feelings soon subside&#44; after the first outburst of words to
                which they spontaneously give birth. My young friends&#44; I trust&#44; will pardon
                this digression&#44; indulged in before I fairly begin &#59; because many of them
                nuiy&#44; probably&#44; at one time or the other attempt to speak in public&#59; and
                having some experience&#44; I deem myself a little <pb n="59"/> ON PRAYER. 59
                qualified to advise them to beware of meretricious or&#8211; nament or false
                glitter&#44; and to depend more on the solidity of their intelligence&#44; their
                knowledge of the subject&#44; and the good sense of their audience&#44; than the
                adventitious display of fine words&#44; which are not rarely sound and fury&#44;
                signifying nothing. Ornament&#44; however&#44; well and skilfully applied&#44;
                pleases the most refined taste&#44; and it shows the hand of the master when it is
                displayed in the proper place&#44; and in proper time. And in this chiefly consists
                the differ&#8211; ence between the true orator and the meaningless violent
                declaimer&#44; and between the man of genius&#44; and the mere collector and
                condenser of other men&#39;s ideas. The ranter may inflame the passions of the vile
                and vulgar&#44; but he leaves the refined mind cold and untouched &#59; whilst&#44;
                at the same time&#44; the mere collector of thoughts and words of others cannot
                produce a permanent impression&#44; because&#44; being un&#8211; acquainted with the
                springs of thoughts and actions&#44; be cannot find the words to which the soul
                responds&#44; like the musical instrument to the skilful touch of the master.
                But&#44; to proceed with our subject. To many the idea of praj&#39;er embraces only
                a mode of asking a fa&#8211; vour&#44; or&#44; at most&#44; returning thanks for
                bounties re&#8211; ceived. Prayer&#44; according to such a view&#44; would simply be
                an outpouring of our necessities before God&#44; either to demand relief&#44; or to
                be grateful when it has been obtained. If this were so&#44; the duty of prayer would
                be confined to periods of necessity or moments of hilarity&#44; when we have enjoyed
                an ex&#8211; pected or unlooked&#8211;for good. In this case we should be always on
                the watch to keep a strict account with <pb n="60"/> 60 ON PRAYER. God&#44; as the
                recipients of his favours&#44; anxious to call on Him when in need&#44; and&#44;
                perhaps&#44; mindful of our dependence when our wishes have been granted. This would
                bring&#44; as a result&#44; that we should grad&#8211; ually lose sight of the power
                of the Supreme&#59; since&#44; in our self&#8211;confidence&#44; we would often
                defer praying&#44; because we might think that we had the ability to obtain justice
                for ourselves by our own strength&#44; wis&#8211; dom&#44; skill&#44; or
                dexterity&#59; and that&#44; when success has attended our eflbrts&#44; it was not
                Providence who had the least to do with the agreeable issue. Thus&#44; also&#44;
                would thanksgiving be omitted&#44; if it were only re&#8211; sorted to on signal
                occasions&#59; since&#44; for the reason just assigned&#44; we should&#44; to a
                certainty&#44; not always recognize the hand of our Father above in our pros&#8211;
                perity. So far as religious purposes are concerned&#44; there&#8211; fore&#44;
                prayer ought to be more universal than the mere petition and thanksgiving&#59;
                or&#44; in other terms&#44; re&#8211; ligion must require prayers which are neither
                the one nor the other&#44; and that they should be performed even at times wlien we
                are neither in any imminent trouble&#44; nor have received any great favour which
                expressly demands our gratitude. If this be once conceded&#44; we may go a step
                farther&#44; and claim that&#44; whereas the object of prayer is to draw man to God
                habitually&#44; and to remind him of his great power&#44; goodness&#44; and
                wisdom&#44; any matter&#44; which can have such an influence on the heart&#44; may
                fairly be introduced into the form or liturgy of a particular religious society. If
                we have arrived at this conclusion&#44; and its pro&#8211; priety could be proved if
                it were necessary&#44; we may at once assume that prayer should be a continual
                ex&#8211; <pb n="61"/> ON PRAYER. 61 ercise&#44; daily repeated&#44; and that it
                should embrace ever3&#39;thing which can bring the power of God ever present before
                our eyes. For since God is all&#8211;power&#8211; ful&#44; and is thus able to grant
                all that we need&#44; with&#8211; hold the expected favours&#44; or send afflictions
                even greater than those we already sufler under&#44; and since it is according as we
                are deemed worthy or otherwise&#44; that we receive reward or punishment&#58; it is
                evidently the best for us to have such influences acting on us and oup motives&#44;
                that the acts which we perform should be of such a kind as to draw on us the favour
                and not the displeasure of the One&#44; who not alone has created us&#44; but whose
                vigilance is ever active to accord to us the recompense which is justly our due.
                Those&#44; therefore&#44; who composed our daily service&#44; the seers of
                Israel&#44; who accompanied Ezra from the Babylonian captivity&#44; and their pious
                associates&#44; the men of the so&#8211;called &#34; Great Assembly&#44;&#34;
                did&#44; in ar&#8211; ranging for us a system or series of petitions and
                thanksgivings&#44; incorporate with these numerous Bible&#8211; passages&#44;
                literally copying without abbreviation&#44; or change&#44; entire verses or
                sections&#44; as part and parcel of our devotional exercises&#44; deeming them&#44;
                without doubt&#44; the best calculated to produce the proper effect of prayer ou the
                individual. For&#44; let us ask&#44; what do we declare when we pray &#63; Simply
                that we ac&#8211; knowledge ourselves inferior&#44; and under the protec&#8211; tion
                and control of the Lord in heaven&#44; who&#44; at his pleasure&#44; can dispose of
                our fate. If now the identi&#8211; cal words of Scripture can make this impression
                and utter this declaration in the best manner&#44; they are evidently the best
                calculated for our use&#44; although&#44; VOL. X. 6 <pb n="62"/> 62 ON PRAYER. in
                themselves&#44; they are neither petition nor thanks&#8211; giving. The best example
                I can give you of this Scripture&#8211; reading in the midst of our prayers
                proper&#44; is the celebrated collection of passages&#44; commonly called the
                iSliemang&#44; with which you are too familiar to re&#8211; quire any extended
                explanation. The Rabbis justly term it d&#94;ow niD&#94;o &#94;i&#59;r rhip&#94;
                &#34; The reception of the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven&#44;&#34; as it is viewed
                in the light of a daily renewed acknowledgment of our alle&#8211; giance to God&#44;
                who is alone in his power&#44; uncircum&#8211; scribed in his mercy&#44;
                unapproached in his wisdom&#44; single and alone in his unity. &#8212; Let us pause
                awhile on the last expression&#44; which has casually escaped me&#44; since it is
                pregnant with the highest significancy. The ideas which a man entertains of the
                beina&#58; or na&#8211; ture of the Supreme&#44; and of his own relative position to
                Him&#44; have a material influence on his thoughts&#44; motives&#44; and actions. If
                we believed that the Deity whom we worship delighted in cruelty and
                suft&#39;ering&#44; we would&#44; to a surety&#44; not regard the infliction of pain
                and sorrow on others in the light of a heinous offence. If we imagined that God took
                no cogni&#8211; zance of the acts of his creatures &#58; we would&#44; to a
                cer&#8211; tainty&#44; indulge in all the imaginations of our own untamed heart&#44;
                and live for ourselves alone&#44; regard&#8211; less of the wishes of others&#59;
                since the greatest amount of self&#8211;indulgence would&#44; in that view&#44; be
                the highest attainable happiness. If we could be induced to be&#8211; lieve that our
                God were powerless in himself&#44; and re&#8211; quired the conjoint aid of
                another&#44; in order to fulfil the desire of his creatures&#44; even assuming that
                He in this case&#44; too&#44; were the sole Creator of all things &#58; <pb n="63"/>
                ON PRAYER. 63 we would&#44; as in reason bound&#44; propitiate the favour of this
                adjunct&#44;&#42; or associate&#44; if this were in our power&#44; to the neglect of
                regarding the wishes&#44; com&#8211; mands and injunctions of the being&#44;
                who&#44; by himself&#44; is powerless to save and to execute his own purposes
                without ulterior assistance. In the first case we would be cruel&#44; in the second
                voluptuaries&#44; and in the third idolaters or polytheists &#59; since the very
                idea of an asso&#8211; ciation in the power of the Godhead is an assumption of a
                plurality of gods&#44; each more or less invested with the prerogative and powers of
                divinity. JSTow&#44; Judaism is in all respects an emphatic denial of these three
                ideas. It declares God to be benevolent&#44; and delighting in mercy&#59; it
                represents Him as ever atten&#8211; tive to the deeds of man &#59; and it exhibits
                Ilim as alone able to execute his will &#59; in the words of Scrip&#8211; ture&#44;
                &#34; Wherever the word of the King is&#44; there is his government&#59; and who can
                say to Ilira&#44; What doest thou&#63;&#34; &#40;Eccl. viii. 4.&#41; Again&#44;
                &#34;And He exists alone in his unity&#44; and who can turn Him back&#63; and what
                his soul desireth He executeth.&#34; &#40;Job xxiii. 13.&#41; If&#44; therefore&#44;
                it is our wish to please this great&#44; watchful&#44; benignant&#44; universal
                Being&#44; we ought to endeavour to follow all the rules of life which He may have
                prescribed for us to pursue &#59; and&#44; consequently&#44; the belief in this God
                should be exhibited in the acts which are to respond to it. &#42; This fact is
                proved by Catholics praying to what they call the mother of God&#44; to intercede
                with her son&#44; with whom she is said to bo all&#8211;powerful&#44; while he is
                equally influential with the father&#44; thus having three male gods&#44; the spirit
                being one&#44; and a fourth adjunct&#44; and this a female god. This is a plain view
                of the absurdities in&#8211; dulged in by a large and intelligent class of men. <pb
                    n="64"/> 64 ON PRAYER. The Scriptures&#44; therefore&#44; and if not these&#44;
                the chief men of our nation at the partial restoration of our government&#44; have
                made it our duty to repeat as a daily exercise those parts of the Bible&#44; wherein
                the truths just stated are found in a condensed and sim&#8211; ple form&#44; and
                which&#44; once admitted&#44; shut the door against the entrance of all erroneous
                ideas which might by any possibility injure the growth of this coniident belief in
                our hearts. Let us now trace the meanincj of the words of the iirst verse&#44; &#34;
                Hear&#44; O Israel &#33; the Lord Avho is our God&#44; is the Lord alone.&#34; In
                the correct acceptation of these words they present themselves as the beginning of
                an address&#44; which the great teacher Moses delivered to the people a few days
                prior to his death. For near forty years he had been their guide in religion &#59;
                their judge to settle their many disputes&#59; their political chief in

                camp of tents&#44; and their chief temple a movable structure of gold&#8211;covered
                boards. Yet much had been gained in that period of wandci&#39;ing in the desert
                &#59; the name of the national God of the Hebrews had alone usurped the places
                formerly occupied in the minds of the people by the multitudes of the divinities of
                the Egyptians&#59; the power of a grasping priesthood&#44; who kept the people in
                darkness by means of the superior knowledge which they alone possessed&#44; had been
                annihilated ibrever by imparting that knowledge&#44; and more yet which they had
                never dreamed of&#44; to an entire race of intelligent beings&#59; and profligacy
                and cruelty had <pb n="65"/> ON PRAYER. 65 been restrained by a severe system of
                laws&#44; terrible only to the transgressors&#44; but mild and merciful to those who
                would consent to bridle their passions in obedience to their dictates &#59; and all
                this was based on the sole idea that but one God does exist&#44; that but one God
                can be thought possible. Moses now in addressing his people&#44; after repeat&#8211;

                which then distinguished our own lovely Palestine&#44; where they were at that
                moment encamped&#44; and then said that all that had been witnessed by
                themselves&#44; and what&#8211; ever had been done since the creation&#44; was the
                work of but one sole pervading Power &#8212; eternal&#44; almiglity&#44; One. It is
                a constant re&#8211;echoing of the same words in our ears&#44; an everlasting

                his last energy he breathed forth the words which so strongly combine the greatest

                unaided by any other divine power&#44; unchecked by any substantial being&#59; since
                He alone is&#44; all others are created&#59; consequently it would be rebellion in

                that the enthusiasm which burst forth from the mouth of the most favoured of
                mortals&#44; found a re&#8211; sponsive thrill in the heart of all his hearers&#63;
                Had they not been witnesses of the same Power which he had seen &#63; Had they not

                fore did his inspired words enkindle the lamp which was already prepared in their

                their own heart&#39;s throbbing&#59; and now behold&#33; the lamp yet burns with

                and the sound yet vibrates&#44; undying&#44; imperishable in our bosom. Where is the
                son of Israel who does not feel the full force of the faith and hope which these
                fiery words of truth inspire &#63; yes&#44; he feels them inly&#44; deeprty &#59;
                and they dwell with him in his manhood&#59; they abide with him in his declining
                years&#59; and when as he sinks into decrepit age he loses the stores of learning he
                may have acquired in the days of his youth&#44; he still cherishes in his fading

                which 30U all have heard many examples related to you by those who have watched the
                life of their brothers in faith&#59; and it exemplifies beautifully how undying is

                loudly for awhile <pb n="68"/> 68 ON PRAYER. to the captive spirit&#44; to pursue

                they bloom&#44; to quaff the wine whilst it foams and sparkles in the ruby cup&#58;
                there is still seated within us that conviction of the power&#44; and greatness&#44;
                and unity of the God above&#44; which will speak when all other voices become
                silent&#44; which will cheer when all other pleasures are one by one failing and
                escaping from our grasp&#44; and stand as a faithful guardian by our sinking
                head&#44; when earth and sky&#44; and sun and moon&#44; fade into darkness before
                our quenched eye. It is diflicult indeed to check myself from continu&#8211; ing in
                this strain&#44; and to exalt the beauty and force of our religion&#44; to lapse
                into a sermon instead of a lecturcon prayer&#59; but I must return to where I
                di&#8211; gressed from&#44; the object and uses of introducing
                Scripture&#8211;passages as quotations or portions of devo&#8211; tional exercises
                into our various liturgies. All I meant to exhibit to you was&#44; that the daily
                acknowl&#8211; edgment of the unity of God was calculated to impress on the mind
                deeply&#44; undyingly&#44; the lesson which it conveys&#44; to be true and steadfast
                to the last&#44; not to turn aside to the right or the left&#44; after the
                inventions of sinful men&#44; who have set up for themselves objects of worship&#44;
                nonentities&#44; fictions&#44; which have no power. no reason&#44; no knowledge&#44;
                &#8212; idols which have no breath in their nostrils&#44; and cannot save those who
                call on them for aid. AYere it now that we could frame a prayer more emphatic in our
                own words&#44; more ex&#8211; pressive of our thoughts than that which springs
                di&#8211; rectly from revelation &#58; we might be permitted to use it&#44;
                substitute it&#44; if you will&#44; for the Shemang itself&#59; but where is that
                man&#44; who would dare to measure <pb n="69"/> ON PRAYER. 69 his intellect with
                that which spoke out of the son of Amram &#63; yes &#33; where is he who would
                venture on the contest to step into the arena and dispute the superi&#8211; ority of
                him who has never been and cannot ever be excelled&#63; &#34;For there never rose up
                a prophet in Is&#8211; rael like unto Moses&#44; whom the Lord knew face to
                face&#44;&#34; that is&#44; who so completely had cognizance of the things high and
                holy&#44; which are concealed from other mortals. And shall we disdain to continue
                using the words which he set up as a standard of faith&#63; No &#33; never&#59; for
                it is fit that the child of earth should learn from his heavenly Father how to
                pray&#44; to em&#8211; ploy those words which he knows beforehand that they will be
                received in favour. But perhaps you may after all say&#44; &#34;The Shemang is no
                prayer at all &#59; it contains no petition&#44; is no thanks&#8211; giving&#44; and
                is as a confession of faith quite inappro&#8211; priately placed in the midst of our
                petitions and praises.&#34; In so judging&#44; however&#44; my hearers&#44; you
                would misconceive the very object of prayer. Un&#8211; derstand well that prayer is
                not so much to remind God of your wants&#59; for He&#44; who knows all the ways of
                man&#44; cannot be ignorant or unmindful of what we actually need. Still&#44; as you
                have been told before&#44; it is our duty to lay our wants open before Him&#44; in
                order to obtain relief&#44; just as we are commanded to exercise other acts of
                religion&#44; in order to receive the divine aprobation of our deeds. It is not our
                prov&#8211; ince to look into the reason of this requirement of our religion&#59; we
                cannot understand the thoughts of God&#59; would He even reveal to us in words his
                mode of ruling the world&#44; we could not&#44; unless we were en&#8211; dowed with
                an increase of wisdom&#44; penetrate the <pb n="70"/> 70 ON PRAYER. depths of his
                designs. Is it not now the ease&#44; that tliough we are told in the Bible that God
                pardons sins and passes bj transgressions to those who sin&#8211; cerely repent&#44;
                there are millions of men who profess to believe that the justice of God cannot be
                satistied without a sacrifice&#44; without the absolute destruction of the sinner
                &#63; And yet by this belief they contradict the teaching of the Scriptures. But so
                is the insulii&#8211; ciency of our reason &#59; we cannot reconcile to our
                no&#8211; tions the unlimited power of God with our concep&#8211; tions of them
                &#59; and we venture constantly upon theo&#8211; ries which we shall have to discard
                upon a close investigation. The same now is the case with the duty of praying to God
                for relief from difficulties&#44; troubles&#44; and dangers &#59; we are told in
                revelation that the Lord will listen to us whenever we call on Ilim&#59; but we are
                not informed that by our words we convey to Ilim a knowledge of our state which He
                has not without them. If&#44; however&#44; the effect of prayer on the Supreme is
                not what it is on a fellow&#8211;man&#44; who is by our petition&#44; perhaps&#44;
                first made cognizant that we are in distress&#44; and that he can aid us &#58; it
                has&#44; never&#8211; theless&#44; a great influence on ourselves&#44; as it reminds
                us that we can obtain enlargement only from the Author of our spirit&#44; that human
                aid must fail&#44; un&#8211; less seconded by his blessing&#59; hence in framing
                words of entreaty to the throne of the Most High&#44; we must necessarily judge our
                own conduct&#44; to see whether we have antj rUjJit to approach llini&#44; wliether
                even in human reason we have not done that wliieli juust act as a bar to the
                acceptance of our entreaty. Etymologists say that the word TijUhdi Ti&#94;2r&#92;
                prayer&#44; is derived from the word &#94;&#94;Â£i to judge&#44; whence V73 <pb

                Uithpallel&#44; to pray&#44; as comniouly rendered&#44; ought properly to be given
                with &#34; to judge oneself&#44;&#34; which would thus convej&#39;&#44; that every
                act of prayer ought to be preceded by a strict self&#8211;examination&#44; in order
                to discover wliether we have any right to approach&#44; even as peti&#8211; tioners
                for an undeserved favour. Him who knows the secrets of our heart. There can be no
                question that such a self&#8211;examination and self&#8211;judging cannot fail of
                being highly promotive of a virtuous and re&#8211; ligious life&#59; for&#44; since
                daily we have some favour to ask&#44; we shall have daily an inducement to institute
                the inquiry which is the prerequisite to a proper en&#8211; treaty &#59; and if we
                lind that it is not right within our&#8211; selves&#44; we must&#44; as a matter of
                course&#44; set at once about remodelling our conduct upon a better and more pious
                plan than the one we have been pursuing&#59; and thus prayer will be a constant
                incentive to perse&#8211; verance in the right&#44; or an impulse to a thorough
                ref&#8211; ormation&#44; unless we are so lost to our accountable state as to pray
                with insincere lips&#44; and merely per&#8211; form it as a routine of duty&#44; in
                which the heart is cold&#44; the soul unmoved&#44; and the result unfelt in our
                conduct. But such a mode of praying can only be acceptable upon the supposition that
                the One whom we address can be deceived&#44; and merely hears our words which
                penetrate to his lofty presence&#44; while distance and intervening obstacles hide
                from his view the deformity of our conduct. That such prayers cannot avail us aught
                to obtain favour in our need&#44; requires no argument&#44; and common sense would
                at once declare it an insult to God&#44; if even the Bible uttered no condemnation
                of it. But the Word of <pb n="72"/> 72 ON PRAYER. God palpably conderaus insincere
                prayer&#44; and de&#8211; clares it unacceptable&#59; consequently&#44; there can be
                no excuse for offering it&#44; nor any reasonable hope that it will in the least
                benefit him who utters the same. It is now evident to yon&#44; that we can pray in
                sin&#8211; cerity as Jews&#44; only when our faith in our religion is perfect&#44;
                by which I mean&#44; that we have a full assur&#8211; ance in the truth of God&#44;
                as He has himself revealed to us through nature&#44; and more yet through the
                Scrip&#8211; tures. No thought which is in conflict with this con&#8211; viction
                must at all dwell in our mind when we utter petition or praise&#44; when we look to
                the Lord for en&#8211; largement&#44; or feel grateful for the mercies extended to
                us. Our heart should then&#44; if at any time&#44; be per&#8211; fect&#44; entire
                with God&#59; no possible doubt should ob&#8211; scure our entire dependence on
                Him&#44; our entire sur&#8211; render of ourselves to his holy keeping. What is&#44;
                therefore&#44; more proper than a full confession of faith&#44; in the midst of our
                formal prayers&#44; which have been framed by our sages&#44; to express all possible
                wants which we can experience individually and nationally&#63; And what confession
                of faith can you point out as existing&#44; or likely to be devised hereafter&#44;
                so every way adapted to declare our undivided trust&#44; as the words of the
                Shemang&#63; Each one calls to the other&#44; &#34; Hear&#44; Israel &#33;&#34;

                consciousness of the importance of the thought&#44; that the Lord Eternal&#44; whom
                we worship as the national God of the He&#8211; brews&#44; wlio has loved and

                is alone the Hearer of Prayer. And what <pb n="73"/> ON PRAYER. 73 do we thus
                declare&#44; but that&#44; in all that may befall us&#44; we will invoke no one

                thanksgiving&#59; but it is more&#44; it is a higher element of prayer&#44; as we
                have defined it &#8212; it is the essence of the surrender of self to the divine
                protection &#8212; it is the full declaration of our fealty to Him who was the Help
                of our fathers from the times of old. Prayer&#44; you will easily understand&#44;
                can only be de&#8211; manded as a duty&#44; upon the same general principle that all
                other religious precepts were instituted&#44; &#34; for our own good&#44;&#34; for
                our moral improvement. As little as God needs our charities to enrich Him&#44; or
                the labour of our hands to prepare Him a house to dwell in&#44; or offerings of
                steers and wethers&#44; that He maybe satisfied with our bounty&#58; so little can
                He require our petitions or praises to please his ear&#44; or to instruct his
                understanding of matters otherwise unknown to Him. If this view be correct&#44;
                prayer must partake of the means of instructing and elevat&#8211; ing the
                petitioner&#44; and to imbue him with proper thoughts&#44; with such ideas as are
                the best for his hap&#8211; piness. I must acknowledg&#39;e that this opinion is not
                shared by many Israelites&#44; who imagine that&#44; by the repetition of mere
                words&#44; they acquire a power over things&#44; by which these become obedient to
                their will&#44; if they are themselves fully prepared by a pious life and due
                knowledge to be worthy of this signal favour. In other words&#44; I allude to the
                Kabbalists&#44; who place an especial value on certain terms and expressions&#44;
                and regard many verses of Scripture as particularly VOL. X. 7 <pb n="74"/> 74 ON
                PRAYER. potent to produce given efiects. I know not&#44; indeed&#44; whether I state
                the case correctly&#59; but several pieces to be met with in the books which we
                use&#44; would seem to leave no room for any other solution. But be this as it
                may&#44; the Scriptures themselves&#44; and the early teachers of Israel&#44;
                subsequent to the close of the Bible&#8211;canon&#44; do not convey any such
                opinions&#59; where&#8211; fore we may not only freely reject them&#44; but
                express&#44; without any heresy&#44; the regret that the persons who&#44; in later
                periods&#44; reduced our prayers to a consistent form and had them printed&#44; did
                permit themselves to admit any mysticism or Kabbalistic allusions into our books of
                devotion. &#34;We will not now dwell on this point&#44; as we have not yet fairly
                reached it. We were led off to speak of it&#44; when remarking that prayer should
                properly have an instructive effect on the pe&#8211; titioner. This is so
                self&#8211;evident that we need hardly discuss it. But we will not hurry over
                it&#44; and endeav&#8211; our to illustrate it as briefly as possible. &#8212; If we
                pray at all with the least devotion&#44; the words which we employ must arrest our
                tlioughts&#44; so that we may not utter unworthy things in the presence of our
                Supreme King. Whether the prayer be extemporaneous&#44; or recited from a written
                form before us&#44; it should al&#8211; ways be in choice language&#44; in regular
                order&#44; and free from confusion and unworthy references. It should be&#8211;
                speak care in the arrangement&#44; and be clear&#44; concise&#44; and to the
                purpose. The Scriptures evidently are the source whence we can derive many elements
                for cor&#8211; rect prayer&#59; since the Psalms and other passages con&#8211; tain
                a large mass of the most sublime thoughts&#44; most cogently and beautifully
                expressed. But other por&#8211; tions of Holy Writ&#44; besides those just referred
                to&#44; <pb n="75"/> ON PRAYER. 75 have the tendency of elevating the thoughts&#44;
                and to lift man above the earth&#59; and these are principally those passages which
                recite the greatness and good&#8211; ness of Grod&#44; and give us an insight into
                his mode of governing the world &#59; such as the ten commandments&#44; the song of
                Moses&#44; the thirteen attributes of mercy&#44; the passages which refer to our
                redemption from Egypt&#44; the chapters six and eleven of Deuteronomy&#44; and
                several others of similar import. If now these portions contain universal
                principles&#44; which can easily be carried into practical life&#44; they may&#44;
                as a matter of convenience&#44; irrespective of the duty of employing them&#44; be
                incorporated with our daily exercises. And we shall find that this has been done.
                For after we have&#44; in the verse Shemang Yisrael&#44; adopted for our&#8211;
                selves the perfect acknowledgment of God&#39;s universal power&#44; and after
                uttering the praise&#44; &#34;Blessed be the glorious name of his kingdom&#44;
                forever and ever&#44;&#34; which&#44; by&#8211;the&#8211;by&#44; is said to have
                originated with our father Jacob&#44; when on his death&#8211;bed he felt convinced
                that all his sons were true and faithful to the Most Holy One &#58; we subjoin the
                verses immediately follow&#8211; ing the Shemang&#44; which enjoin&#44; first&#44;
                love to God&#59; secondly&#44; the duty of ever remembering his blessed words&#59;
                and thirdly&#44; the duty of imparting them to our children&#44; and to speak of
                them constantly in all possible relations of life&#44; to make them ornaments for
                our arm and head&#44; and to aflix them to the door&#8211; posts of our houses and
                our gates&#44; so that the com&#8211; mands of God may be always remembered. It
                would lead us too far&#44; at present&#44; to comment on all these points as fully
                as we have on the first&#59; but we may say&#44; as a general observation&#44; that
                after we have ac&#8211; <pb n="76"/> 76 ON PRAYER. knowledged the power of God and
                our subjection to Him&#44; it is well that we understand how we are to serve
                Him&#59; in respect to which we are then informed&#44; that it must be a perfect
                love which we are to offer to his acceptance&#44; not one which calculates
                costs&#44; dif&#8211; ficulties&#44; or dangers&#44; but such a one as will enable
                us to yield up everything&#44; health&#44; life&#44; the dearest we possess&#44; if
                so only we can maintain our allegiance to Him. He does not measure his bounties by
                our actual wants&#59; He does not send his blessing only at the moment of our actual
                need &#59; but before we call He has answered our entreaty&#44; and long before we
                frame our thoughts to prayer&#44; his light and his rain have been sent to clothe
                the earth with verdure&#44; and to prepare food for the children of man. No exertion
                on our part can ripen the products of the fields&#44; can cause a single flower to
                bud and bloom &#58; and yet all nature is robed in gladness&#44; and field and
                flood&#44; and bill and valley&#44; and mountain and plain&#44; and earth and
                sky&#44; and all that live&#44; and all that breathe&#44; pro&#8211; claim that a
                Bounty unlimited has supplied all they need for support&#44; for joy&#44; for
                ornament&#44; and that but one Spirit of goodness pervades all. Therefore should our
                devotion&#44; our love&#44; be also unlimited&#44; except by our ability&#44; and
                nothing that we can do&#44; no matter how great the exertion&#44; or how great
                soever the sac&#8211; rifice&#44; should be deemed too much in the service of God.
                For what do we oft&#39;er Him but that which is his own &#63; Is it wealth&#44; did
                He not enable us to acquire it&#63; Is it intelligence&#44; whence is wisdom derived
                but from Him&#44; the Source of all knowledge&#63; Is it life&#44; is not He the

                increase our happiness manifold&#44; far more than our imagination can con&#8211;
                ceive &#58; and even if we have then to go out of this existence&#44; what prevents
                Him from giving us joys far exceeding the pleasures of this life&#44; which is&#44;
                at best&#44; never free from care&#44; never unmingled with sorrow &#63; The next
                duty inculcated in this passage&#44; is that of laying to heart whatever words the
                Lord has taught us. This means that we should carefully study the Scriptures&#44;
                that we may be familiar therewith&#44; so as to be able to apply them in practice at
                every mo&#8211; ment&#44; when this becomes requisite. This study&#44; more&#8211;
                over&#44; is to perfect what the preceding command asks of us&#59; since without
                knowledge of our duties&#44; their execution becomes an impossibility &#59; and as
                our love to God can only be displayed in the practice of duties&#44; for the reason
                already stated&#44; that we have no means to increase his happiness&#44; it is
                evidently of the first necessity that we should endeavour to learn what He wishes us
                to perform&#44; if this information be within our reach. But that it is&#44; the
                existence of the Bible amply proves &#59; wherefore a constant study of it is an
                obligation incumbent on us&#44; from which nothing can absolve us &#59; and the more
                deeply we enter into it&#44; the more easy will it become&#44; and the more readily
                will we be able to prove that we love the Lord with all our heart and with all our
                soul. But not alone the adults&#44; those who have grown up in the practice of the
                faith&#44; are to be acquainted with the Divine Word&#44; but the children likewise.

                as a full discharge of this duty&#59; on the contrary&#44; the precepts must be
                repeated again and again&#44; till they be indelibly engraven on the memory&#44;
                that the younger Israelites&#44; too&#44; may step abroad and enter the busy walks
                of life without any danger&#44; that their trust in the true God should be weakened
                in the least. As the steel is not sharpened by once passing it over an&#8211;
                other&#44; and as this has to be done frequently&#44; in order to render the edge
                thin and smooth&#44; that it may enter quickly and deeply into the substance which
                it is to sever &#58; so should instruction be repeated in every pos&#8211; sible
                way&#44; and renewed again&#44; if the first impression should have faded&#44; till
                the youth of our people shall be quick in the knowledge of the Lord&#44; and they
                again be able to propagate the blessed plant of righteous&#8211; ness in the future
                soil&#44; which will be ready for them in their turn to labour in. But instruction
                should not be confined to children only &#59; for it should extend farther&#44; and
                become mu&#8211; tual teaching&#44; mutual reminding&#44; when we meet each other in
                our houses and on the road&#59; not as we do&#44; that every other topic is
                discussed save religion &#59; but it should be spoken of more than the common
                affairs of life&#44; that those who have knowledge may impart it&#44; and be
                themselves animated with new zeal&#44; when they see the fire of piety kindled in
                hitherto dormant minds. Therefore&#44; also&#44; when we lie down&#44; when we rise
                up&#44; should the law be read and thought over&#59; so that its precepts may always
                be fresh in our memory&#44; not lie there buried and be unthought of&#44; as a
                useless knowledge which we had to acquire as a school&#8211;exer&#8211; cise in our
                younger years&#44; but of which we can make no practicable application as we advance
                in life. For <pb n="79"/> ON PRAYER. 79 this reason&#44; also&#44; are we to make
                memorials of relig&#8211; ion&#44; to bind them literally&#44; not lignratively&#44;
                as signs on our hand and as frontlets between our eyes&#44; and fix them on our
                houses and gates&#44; as mementos to all comers to remember the God who instituted
                us as his people&#44; when He brought us forth from Egypt. It must strike you&#44;
                that however long I have de&#8211; tained you in explaining the object of the first
                sec&#8211; tions of the Shemang being among our prayers&#44; I merely glanced at the
                important ideas&#44; doctrines&#44; and duties it conveys &#59; one&#44;
                however&#44; who has ceased from her labours&#44; the late Grace Aguilar&#44; has
                beautifully commented on it in a separate work which she wrote to illustrate the
                &#34; Spirit of Judaism.&#34; I refer you to this production&#44; although I cannot
                say that you will find the same train of reasoning pursued by her which I have
                exhibited before you. Still&#44; as all are permit&#8211; ted to enter modestly the
                field of inquiry&#44; and candidly to state the fruits of their study&#44; I trust
                that what I have advanced may not be considered either useless or wrong in
                principle. The subject is&#44; however&#44; so multifarious in its bearing&#44; and
                so influeiitial on the afiairs of life&#44; that it may be often discussed without
                losing anything of its value or sacredness. All I meant to prove was&#44; that
                Scriptural passages are eminently useful to excite in us the spirit which should
                accom&#8211; pany prayer&#44; &#8212; that is&#44; a thorough devotion and
                yield&#8211; ing in all things to God. This is all which words can eft&#39;ect in
                us&#44; and this is again all which the Merciful One requires. It is true that we
                repeat the Shemang so often&#44; that we forget the important lessons which we have
                sketched as being conveyed in it. This is undoubtedly an evil &#59; still each one
                can rectify this <pb n="80"/> 80 ON PRAYER. within himself&#44; by always recalling
                his thoughts&#44; should they be wandering during prayer&#44; and causing them to
                dwell with proper edification on these verses. Is it not recommended to us to close
                our eyes to out&#8211; ward things whilst saying the first verse&#44; Shemang
                Yisrael&#44; and to place our hand over them and to dwell on the last word Echad
                One&#44; whilst we reflect that He is alone Sovereign on earth and in heaven&#44;
                and that there is none beside Him&#63; &#8212; are we not told to say to ourselves
                in a low tone&#44; inaudible to all but ourselves&#44; with the sole exception of
                the Day of Atonement&#44; when it is to be said aloud&#44; &#34; Blessed be the
                glorious name of his kingdom forever and ever&#63;&#34; &#8212; are we not farther
                required to read the remaining portion slowly&#44; solemnly&#44; with the proper
                intonation&#44; as indicated by the musical accents which the words bear &#63; What
                is all this for but to induce us to dwell carefully on each word&#44; on each
                syllable&#44; so that the whole may make&#44; each time it is read&#44; a new and
                powerful impression on the heart &#63; And say not that it is in vain&#44; that we
                recite the words without feeling&#44; without reflection&#44; without benefit.
                Yes&#44; let this happen a thousand times&#44; let it ever so often be a reciting by
                rote of so many verses from Scripture without a response from the heart&#44; without
                an emotion in the soul &#58; there will still be moments when either joys or sorrows
                draw us to God&#44; when a great deed happily consummated&#44; or a grievous sin
                sorely repented for&#44; recalls us to our&#8211; selves &#59; when we will feel
                anew that it is no idle thing to acknowledge the Unity of God&#44; to praise his
                holy Name&#44; and hope for the extending of his kingdom over the universal
                world&#59; when we feel strong in faith&#44; in trust&#44; in fear&#44; in love to
                our Father&#59; when <pb n="81"/> ON PRAYER. 81 we could go forth willingly and
                joyously to sacrifice our life as martyrs for the truth &#59; when we feel

                of Adam&#44; to entreat them&#44; to ex&#8211; hort them to join with us in
                rendering homage to Him who alone is great and holy &#59; when we would gladly spend
                whatever remnant of days is left us to teach to all comers that there is mercy to be
                obtained in our Father&#39;s mansion&#44; peace and glory in his holy temple. These
                are soothing moments&#44; and they em&#8211; belUsh the life of all men&#44; and
                they open to us a fore&#8211; taste of that felicity&#44; of that pure&#44;
                unalloyed delight which&#44; if anything can be&#44; must be the portion of the
                souls of the blessed. And if prayer has done this&#44; if the word of God has
                endowed us with such life&#44; who will say that we have prayed in vain&#44; that
                our reading has not had the happiest result &#63; To those who esti&#8211; mate the

                in a wealth of the soul which is not appreciable by any material test which we can
                apply. But if this were all we have worth living for&#44; how few would have

                We are assembled here this day to dedicate this field as a burying&#8211;place for
                the deceased of the house of Israel&#44; where they are to repose awaiting the
                sum&#8211; mons unto life of their God and Creator. On an oc&#8211; casion like this
                it is well to pause and casta reflecting look on life and its issues. All who are
                born must die&#59; there is a dark portal which looms in the dis&#8211; tance&#44;

                our fate rolling on our bed of sickness or tossed about on the wild&#44; stormy
                billows of the ocean &#59; and&#44; however unwelcome the thought may be&#44; we
                cannot shake it off&#44; that all this beauty of outward nature&#44; the bril&#8211;
                liant sky&#44; the teeming earth&#44; the pleasant valleys&#44; the limpid
                streams&#44; all must pass away from our eyes&#44; and that we must be brought
                hither to sleep the sleep of death. Well may the flesh creep on our bones when we
                reflect on what we are and what must be&#8211; come of us &#59; the stoutest heart
                may well be appalled when it brings home to it the conviction that but a brief
                period will elapse when its tumultuous heavings must cease and it become cold and
                still&#44; and that then all its dreams of aggrandizement&#44; enjoyment&#44; and
                worldly greatness will come to an end. What can console us when we thus are induced
                to reflect on our being&#63; that we are here merely to pass away&#63; Nothing but
                the consciousness that we are prepared to meet the change which awaits us&#44; that
                we have fit&#8211; tingly consumed the time which elapses between our entering life
                and our leaving it&#44; through the dismal portal which meets our view in the
                gayest&#44; happiest moments of our existence. To those who with me believe in the
                revelation of God&#44; who are of the house of Israel&#44; I may freely say&#44;
                Search in the law of your Creator for the guide which is to instruct you &#59; for
                it will point out to you the way of eternal life&#44; and clear up for you all
                doubts and misgivings of your future destiny. It will tell you that at God&#39;s
                right hand there are eternal pleasures&#44; and delights which fade not away&#44;

                spring. They are not like the pleasures here helow&#44; which are mixed with
                bitterness and sin &#59; but they are pure&#44; springing from a consciousness that
                we have discharged our duty&#44; in the conviction that we have obtained the grace
                of our Father. And this happiness we can ac&#8211; quire&#44; it is within our power
                to obtain it&#59; but we must listen to God&#39;s instruction&#44; and yield to Him
                our will and inclination when they militate against what He has taught us to regard
                as the path of right&#8211; eousness. If we have at the time of our leaving earth
                the feeling within us that we have violated the precepts we have received from
                God&#59; if we know that we have been unkind to our fellow&#8211;beings&#44; that
                our life has not been a blessing&#44; bat a burden to ourselves and others &#58;
                with how much horror must we then look back upon the dreary course we have
                pursued&#44; with what dread must we look upon the gloomy future be&#8211; fore

                possible enough that you may not acquire large possessions in so doing&#59; for the

                Christian citizens of this city and state&#44; to address a few observations to you.

                86 LIFE AND ITS ISSUES. sembling of Israelites as a body for religious pur&#8211;
                poses. There has been done nothing strange or sur&#8211; prising on the present
                occasion&#44; and with noiseless simplicity a few of the ancient house of Jacob
                resid&#8211; ing among you have dedicated this spot as the place where their
                fathers&#44; mothers&#44; wives&#44; and children are to repose when death has
                closed their eyes. They have thus given you an assurance that they intend to be
                permanent residents among you&#44; that they wish to share whatever calamity may
                befall you as well as your prosperity. For&#44; believe me&#44; that where the dead
                of the Jew repose&#44; there will not alone his spirit hover&#44; but his body will
                be present to protect the precious dust from being desecrated by the hand of
                violence. They give you thus the most solemn pledge that they mean to cast their lot
                with you &#59; to form with you one people in the land. And here in the same iield
                where the gentile is to bury his dead&#44; there the Jew means to inter his&#59; and
                side by side&#44; though in different enclosures&#44; the ancient inheritors of the
                Scriptures and those who newly adopted them will sleep quietly&#44; when the tumult
                of life is ended. Yet when living&#44; there is a distinction in the eye of the laws
                of your state between the Jew and his Christian fellow&#8211;citizens &#59; he is
                excluded from all offices of honor and trust&#44; simply because he is a Jew. In
                death all are alike &#59; but while the burden of earthly existence is on us&#44;
                the son of Israel is excluded from equal rights by the constitution which governs
                you as the supreme law. This is not well &#59; it is a dis&#8211; grace to a
                state&#44; in this age of the world&#44; to exclude any one for the sake of the
                opinions he entertains&#44; regarding his idea of the Godhead and the religious <pb

                surrender our conviction to you or any other power on earth. The Almighty&#44; who
                has given me intellect&#44; who has en&#8211; dowed me with a sentient soul&#44; has
                also given me the power to judge for myself in matters of faith. If I cannot
                comprehend what appears to you so clear and evident&#44; you must not blame me&#44;
                that my spirit is differently constituted from yours. For my conduct as a man I am

                day that is&#44; it means that we should prepare ourselves all our days&#44; as

                expected of a Jewish divine &#59; still&#44; I have endeav&#8211; oured to treat it
                as free from bias and prejudice&#44; as was possible to me. It has&#44; however&#44;
                an interest&#44; not alone to the Israelite&#44; but also to all persons of
                intel&#8211; ligence &#59; since the existence of the Hebrew people is well
                calculated to arrest the attention of all who are inclined to trace great effects to
                some well&#8211;defined causes. Perhaps not any people have ever been more spoken
                about than the Israelites&#59; the religionist has con&#8211; stantly to refer to
                them when expounding his own peculiar views&#44; and one is not far wrong to
                assert&#44; that scarcely a public religious meeting takes place in which the Jews
                are not either mentioned dby name&#44; or at least alluded to in some manner.
                Those&#44; how&#8211; ever&#44; who do not pay any deference to the popular ideas in
                religion&#44; are also not indifferent spectators on the presence of the Hebrew
                race&#44; and either praise them for their sturdy common sense&#44; when it suits
                them to denounce or revile other persuasions&#44; or&#44; if their object be to
                reject all positive religion&#44; they not rarely cast ridicule on Israelites&#44;
                for what they fanci&#8211; fully style their superstition. And with all this
                con&#8211; stant attention directed towards our people&#44; we are&#44; on the other
                hand&#44; fully warranted in asserting&#44; that no class of men is so much
                misunderstood&#44; or possi&#8211; bly&#44; so unknown&#44; as are these
                self&#8211;same Jews. Per&#8211; haps they are a mystery to themselves&#59; they are

                guisliable at first sight as a separate people &#59; and all this not because tliey
                desire to be singular&#44; but be&#8211; cause they cannot help it&#59; for they are
                as they are from&#44; what may be termed&#44; a natural conformation&#44; from an
                indelible&#44; unalterable impression which they received in their very origin&#44;
                and which they have carried with them down the path of the world&#39;s his&#8211;
                tory&#44; until this very moment. The matter is surely worth an inquiry&#59; it is a
                phenomenon certainly de&#8211; serving the serious consideration of every sou of
                Israel&#44; and of those&#44; too&#44; who feel an interest in that people from
                which they have derived their chief sources of religion&#44; or&#44; in other
                words&#44; the knowl&#8211; edge of how to live in purity&#44; and how to die in
                honour. Far down in the valley of time we see a little stream making its way between
                shelving rocks and thickly overhanging branches&#59; we behold a little rill just
                escaped from its flinty birth&#8211;place&#44; gradually urging its way to reach the
                broad plain where other and broader streams pursue their course. But ever and anon
                its progress is checked by obstacles which the nature of its bed presents to it at
                every turn &#59; yet the very narrowness and depth of the channel which it has to
                follow&#44; preserve its waters from being wasted and dried up by summer&#39;s
                heat&#59; and&#44; constantly re&#8211; filled from the icy source whence it
                springs&#44; it rushes onward&#44; though at times unseen&#44; till it emerges with
                irrepressible power&#44; a mighty river in the presence of the Lord&#44; before its
                waters finally mingle with the vast ocean to which it furnishes an unmistakable
                ac&#8211; cession of strength far away in its briny floods. Such a stream is&#44; in
                the history of the human race&#44; <pb n="98"/> 98 THE PAST AND FUTURE OF ISRAEL.
                the family of Israel&#44; which&#44; never very numerous&#44; is still one of the
                weakest of mankind&#44; if importance is to be considered as attachable only to
                millions and material power. It was in Chaldea&#44; the ancient seat of learning and
                early civilization&#44; that one man&#44; rising above the superstitions of his
                friends&#44; neighbours&#44; and relatives&#44; rejected the idols&#44; the works of
                human hands&#44; and proclaimed aloud his belief and trust in One&#44; eternal&#44;
                and invisible God&#44; whom he designated and adored as the Possessor of heaven and
                earth &#40;Gen. xiv. 22&#41;&#44; comprehending&#44; under the last term&#44; the
                globe on which we live&#44; and by the other&#44; the whole structure of the
                universe&#44; in comparison with which our earth is but like an atom that dances
                before our eyes in the bright sunbeams of a glorious sum&#8211; mer&#39;s day. It is
                not our province now to investigate whether Abram&#44; for that was this
                Chaldean&#39;s name&#44; had any conception of the great extent of the uni&#8211;
                verse&#44; which modern discoveries have taught us to ascribe to the same&#44;
                though there are traces enough in old Jewish writings which evidently betoken a
                knowledge of the vastness of the creation&#44; and it is also clear&#44; that in
                very early times already the great&#8211; ness of God was measurably described by a
                reference to the magnitude of the works of his hands. Eut this much is certain&#44;
                and it is all which we need to illustrate as belonging to our subject&#44; that the
                father of the Hebrew nation had acquired&#44; either by instruc&#8211; tion or from
                his own unaided research&#44; the conviction that the idols and objects of
                worship&#44; which received the homage of his countrymen&#44; had no power to
                con&#8211; fer any gift on man which he had not obtained from the Highest
                Source&#44; or&#44; in other words&#44; that there <pb n="99"/> THE PAST AND FUTURE
                OF ISRAEL. 99 existed but one&#44; universal&#44; controlling Power&#44; which
                we&#44; for want of a better name&#44; call God. It was just stated&#44; that it is
                not impossible that Abrara had received instruction from his progeni&#8211;
                tors&#44; though not his immediate father&#44; concerning the powerlessness of the
                divinities which were adored around him &#59; but even if this was actually the
                case&#44; it does not in the least detract from his merits&#44; nor lessen&#44; in
                the smallest degree&#44; the value of his great work in becoming boldly the
                professor of a truth which was evidently not in favour with his country&#8211; men.
                We have the authority of no less an historian than Joshua for asserting&#44; that
                our forefathers&#44; resid&#8211; ing on the other side of the Euphrates&#44;
                worshipped strange gods&#59; and however&#44; therefore&#44; there may have been
                here and there some few who revered the One who had displayed his omnipotence
                through the de&#8211; struction of the generation of evil&#8211;doers by means of
                the flood&#44; and scattered a rebellious assemblage through the confusion of
                tongues&#44; at the building of the tower of Babel &#58; there can be no doubt that
                the vast majority of mankind had&#44; either by their own impulse or by the cunning
                devices of priests and kings&#44; learned to adopt a multitude of worshipful
                beings&#44; instead of the One great Supreme. We have accordingly every reason to
                believe the truth of the ancient tradition&#44; which asserts that Abram was
                per&#8211; secuted for his bold profession of faith&#44; and for his daring
                denunciation of the folly of his contemporaries. It is said in this connexion&#44;

                by the interposition of Providence&#44; as did&#44; in a later period&#44; his
                descendants&#44; when they were doomed to a similar punishment for a like

                Chaldea&#44; Nebuchadnezzar&#44; the destroyer of Jerusalem. Whether we place
                implicit credence in this legend or not&#44; this much is certain&#44; that
                tradition which&#44; after all&#44; is the evidence of popular opinion and belief on
                a certain point&#44; ascribed to Abram an unflinching constancy in the profession of
                his views on God and the creation&#44; for which he must have been exposed to great
                risks&#44; as it is very natural that one or many always acquire from the
                masses&#44; from whom they differ&#44; ill&#8211;will&#44; and not rarely absolute
                hatred&#44; as the recompense of their dissent. It would have been singular&#44; if
                the ancient Plebrew should have escaped this fate common to all independent
                thinkers&#44; and if he should have been left unmolested to pursue the result of his
                own convictions. But notwithstanding the risk which he had run in his native
                land&#44; and that of his temporary sojourn at Ilaran in Mesopotamia&#44;&#42; we
                find him pursuing a similar course of life&#44; after he had attained his
                seventy&#8211;fifth year&#44; at a time when surely the enthusiastic excitement of
                youthful con&#8211; viction had long since passed away&#44; when he had reached the
                land of Canaan&#44; whither he had repaired&#44; as the Bible tells us&#44; by
                divine appointment. This &#42; Lately&#44; it has been asserted that Haran is a
                district of country not far from Damascus&#44; and that it was called Naharayim&#44;
                Two Rivers&#44; from being between the two streams&#44; probably Amanah and Pharpar.
                But wherever this Haran was&#44; it matters not&#44; as far as the truth of the
                Bible&#8211;history is concerned. <pb n="101"/> THE PAST AND FUTURE OF ISRAEL. 101
                land was then in the occupancy of the Canaanites and Perizzites&#44; tribes addicted
                to the bloody rites of Mo&#8211; lech&#44; sacrificing their children to a senseless
                idol. But the Hebrew&#44; though a stranger here&#44; erected altars to the God of
                heaven and earth&#44; and taught the benighted people to adore the Name which to him
                was the source of joy&#44; of hope&#44; of trust&#44; and of con&#8211; solation.
                Thus arose our nation&#44; far away in the early records of authentic history&#44;
                like a speck in the distant ho&#8211; rizon&#44; owing its origin&#44; as also its
                mental character&#44; to the daring reformer who&#44; regardless of danger and
                personal consequences&#44; boldly defied public opinion&#44; and sought to gain for
                the truth&#44; as he conceived it&#44; a few ardent adherents&#44; who&#44; like
                him&#44; might have the courage to avow it at all times&#44; and under all
                circumstances. We must not be surprised&#44; however&#44; to find that Abram&#44; at
                his first appearance&#44; or Abra&#8211; ham&#44; as he was called at a later period
                of his life&#44; had but few followers&#44; to such a degree that we meet with none
                but the descendants of Isaac his younger son&#44; and of this one&#39;s younger
                son&#44; Jacob&#44; who adhered to the doctrines of the founder of the family. For
                it was a severe trial to sever the ties of consanguinity&#44; to separate oneself
                from the associates of youth&#44; to adopt a new and strict mode of living&#44;
                which the new theory required&#59; and those therefore who&#44; as servants and
                friends of the Patriarch&#44; had in whole or part adopted his speculative
                ideas&#44; did not transmit them to their descendants&#44; because they had&#44; in
                all likeli&#8211; hood&#44; not at the same time submitted to all the duties which
                Abraham imposed on his own family. The early teacher of the truth which we have

                death&#44; nearly alone in his profession&#44; and the light which he endeavoured to

                Palestine&#44; burned yet with a feeble glimmer&#44; which to all human probability
                must have appeared nigh its extinction again&#44; from the little strength it had
                acquired under one so eminently cal&#8211; culated to nourish it. For to picture
                Abraham&#44; as he is represented to us in the authentic pages of Genesis&#44; we
                should judge that he was practical and earnest&#44; equally removed from
                enthusiastic excitability and frivolous haste &#59; we see him not unmindful of
                per&#8211; sonal advantages&#44; a prudent husbandman&#44; and a care&#8211; ful
                shepherd &#59; peaceable&#44; even submitting to personal wrong&#44; though a
                powerful chief in the land&#44; yet ready to take up arms when it concerned the
                righting of another&#39;s injuries&#44; notwithstanding that this person had at one
                time disturbed the peace of his household&#59; generous and liberal without forcing
                others to be as disinterested as himself. But more than all&#44; we shall have to
                admire his unshaken constancy&#44; his unswerv&#8211; ing confidence in the
                correctness of bis inward con&#8211; viction&#44; inasmuch as he never yielded but
                once to despondency&#44; although he saw so little to cheer him on in that which was
                so dear to him&#44; the spread of his own persuasion &#59; when perhaps every other
                man but he would have given up the struggle&#44; and ceased to teach where there was
                nothing gained. Perhaps some person&#44; glad to discover blemishes in the most
                perfect picture&#44; may point out to us that Abraham was guilty of duplicity in his
                intercourse with Pharaoh of Egypt and Abimelech of Philistia&#59; but let us not

                both these countries must have been exceedingly corrupt from the recorded fact that
                Abraham was exposed to lose his life owing to the charms of Sarah&#59; and our harsh
                judgment will be surely softened&#44; so as not to condemn too severely what we
                cannot altogether approve of. But we should reflect&#44; at the same time&#44; that
                we are presented with the character of a man&#44; sufhciently human to be ap&#8211;
                preciated&#44; not a monster of perfection such as the earth has never looked upon.
                Besides this&#44; we are nowhere told to follow Abraham&#39;s private conduct&#44;
                but only in what he taught of the ways of the Lord&#44; to exercise righteousness
                and justice. For this the record praises him&#44; and in this regard we may
                chal&#8211; lenge the world to produce his equal. The materials&#44; indeed&#44; are
                too scanty to permit us to compile a full biography of the father of the Hebrews
                &#59; but the few hints preserved for us are enough to convince us that he was
                precisely such a one as is calculated to leave an impression strong and
                ineifaceable&#44; by his talents&#44; his probity&#44; and undeviating love of
                justice. In thus connecting the character of Israel with that of their iirst special
                parent&#44; you have been presented with a key to the nature of the Jewish mind&#44;
                which has preserved its identity so strikingly amidst all the vicissitudes that have
                passed over it. You may say&#44; that I assume for it&#44; in thus stating it&#44;
                too high a posi&#8211; tion&#44; and that much that is ignoble is easily discovered
                in it. This will not be disputed &#59; for neither an indi&#8211; vidual nor a
                people is faultless&#44; only he is the best who has the fewest shadows to contrast
                with his brighter side&#44; and this test may fairly be applied to the Jewish

                sacred to his feeling heart&#44; and he appears more like the link between the

                not once from whose lineage he had sprung&#44; and that in him and his progeny
                centred the hopes of a world&#39;s salvation. O those bright visions enlivened his
                nightly vigils &#59; those glorious prospects sweetened every toil &#59; those
                blissful yearnings solaced his days of sadness&#44; and gave him strength and power
                to transmit the legacy of divine truth to all who were called by his name&#59; so
                that when at length Jacob&#44; who was surnamed Is&#8211; rael&#44; or he who had
                obtained dominion with God and men&#44; was summoned away from earth&#44; there
                stood around his bedside&#44; not one child&#44; as was the case with Abraham&#44;

                tax&#44; a fifth part of the annual product which had to be sent to the public
                treasury. It accordingly happened&#44; that although the stream of Israel was
                gradually expanding&#44; and this in peace and security for at least seventy years
                after their arrival&#44; or upwards of fifty years after Jacob&#39;s death&#44; it

                scendants when they first expanded into a nation &#59; since their numerical

                Israel. The Egj&#39;ptians had experienced their strong good sense &#59; they indeed
                detested their being addicted to the raising of flocks&#44; their eating the flesh
                of the emblem of their gods&#44; their denial of the power of the idols adored by

                indeed&#44; mere conjecture&#44; but for all that not unreasonable&#44; to as&#8211;
                sume&#44; that as shepherds and agriculturists&#44; who have no need for arms except
                to protect themselves against the attacks of savage beasts&#44; they were not
                prepared to ofl&#58;er any serious resistance to the well&#8211;trained mil&#8211;
                itary castes of Egypt&#44; who probably permitted no one&#44; not even the

                of warding off&#34; a foreign foe&#44; and ruling with unrelenting and irresistible
                tyranny over their own countrymen. Besides this&#44; it is not probable that&#44;
                although the increase of the Hebrews had been exceedingly great&#44; they could have
                amounted to any formidable number soon after the death of Joseph &#59; and it
                is&#44; on the other hand&#44; reasonable to assume&#44; that not long after his
                demise the jealousy of the na&#8211; tive Egyptians threw oft&#39; the
                restraints&#44; which grati&#8211; tude for their country&#39;s greatest benefactor
                had at first imposed on them. It was then resolved to make the Israelites
                harmless&#44; and at the same time useful to the country&#44; by compelling them to
                perform invol&#8211; untary labour to the state&#44; and to individuals to whom they
                might be assigned. The precise steps resorted to in order to enforce obedience&#44;
                are not recorded&#59; but we may freely assume&#44; that a large body of the
                warriors and a sufficient number of taskmasters were distributed through Goshen&#44;
                who&#44; by means of per&#8211; sonal violence and other efficacious measures&#44;
                com&#8211; pelled them&#44; singly and in masses&#44; to perform such labour as was
                demanded of them. Resistance was impossible&#59; no concert of action could take
                place&#44; where every act was watched&#44; where no one knew Avhom to trust&#44;
                where it was unknown whether the person confided in might not betray the fatal
                secret the next moment to a minion of power&#44; in order to obtain for himself a
                diminution of that severe tyranny which bore down with equal weight on all. And a
                refinement of cruelty was at last resorted to in addi&#8211; tion&#44; by appointing
                overseers of their own people over them&#44; and holding these to a rigorous
                responsibility&#44; to have the daily tasks finished to the utmost extent&#44; VOL.
                X. XO <pb n="110"/> 110 THE PAST AND FUTURE OP ISRAEL. It is not to be doubted&#44;
                that this constant toil&#44; these increasing hardships&#44; which saw their
                culminating point in the destruction of the male children&#44; so that the race
                might be gradually rooted out&#44; had a ten&#8211; dency to weaken the attachment
                of the Israelites to&#8211; wards their traditional faith and its practices&#44; and
                to induce many to adopt tacitly the opinions and man&#8211; ners of their
                oppressors&#44; notwithstanding that there were among them also men and women of a
                higher stamp of mind&#44; who revolted at the idea of sharing the pollution of
                morals and the imparity of thought of caste&#8211;ridden Egypt. But that a vast many
                had not these high aspirations&#44; is evident from the words of the prophet
                Ezekiel&#44; who&#44; in his twentieth chapter&#44; pointedly speaks of teachers
                who&#44; in the name of God&#44; exliorted the Israelites to cast away the
                abominations of their eyes&#44; and not to defile themselves on tiie idols of
                Egypt&#59; independent of the consideration that the race reijarded as inferior and
                treated as such with all the scorn and the contumely which the ruling classes ever
                assume&#44; is very apt to imitate those from whom it receives its directions
                respecting its daily employ&#8211; ment. Here was&#44; therefore&#44; another and a
                very im&#8211; minent danger&#44; that the labours of Abraham might at length be
                entirely obliterated&#44; if the residence of his descendants should have continued
                for an indef&#8211; inite period in the land where they then sojourned. In the
                course of probability&#44; a dim tradition of the national God&#44; so different in
                all respects from the be&#8211; ings&#44; or fanciful inventions rather&#44; adored
                all around them&#44; might have been perhaps retained by a few who had mind enough
                to think independently of out&#8211; ward circumstances&#44; despite of the heavy
                yoke which <pb n="111"/> THE PAST AND FUTURE OF ISRAEL. 111 rested on their necks.
                But how much would this have naturally been mingled with error&#44; with
                mythol&#8211; ogy&#44; or doctrine of fictions&#44; which everybody about them
                implicitly confided in. Perhaps&#44; also&#44; some of the aged&#44; who had heard
                their grandfathers speak of a free people invited to Egypt out of gratitude to
                en&#8211; joy the king&#39;s hospitality&#44; may have related in the bitterness of
                despondence to their toiling children&#44; how they remembered something of a
                blessing bestow&#8211; ed by Israel&#44; that the God of Abraham woukl at some
                future day think of them&#44; and that Joseph&#44; too&#44; had repeated the same
                hopeful words&#44; which had led them all to expect a joyful residence in a country
                not many days&#39; journey removed to the northward&#44; famous for its beauty&#44;
                fertility&#44; and variety of climate &#59; where the rains of heaven descend to
                moisten the earth &#59; where there is winter at times&#44; and fleecy snows are
                seen to place a wreath of winter&#8211;flowers on the denuded branches of the
                deciduous trees&#44; which flourish the more vigorously for their temporary rest
                &#59; where there are streams issuing out of vale and hill&#59; where there are
                mountains to break the constant unvarying level which fatigues tlie eye by its
                sameness. And now&#44; where was the fulfilment of this blessing&#63; was it not the
                result of an excited imagination&#44; reverting&#44; in the last hours of life&#44;
                to scenes of infancy&#44; to im&#8211; pressions dwelling in the memory&#44; without
                any other foundation for the words uttered than a simple wish that it might be
                so&#63; Thus reasoning&#44; thus despond&#8211; ing&#44; there was danger that the
                last firm hope might at length have vanished from the minds of Israelites&#44; and
                that they would have degenerated into a Pariah caste&#44; distinguished in features

                debased in morals&#44; slavish in mind&#44; morose in temper&#44; and superstitious
                to the lowest degree&#44; look&#8211; ing on their taskmasters in the light of
                superior beings&#44; and imitating them in all things which their low condition
                permitted them&#44; even granting that the decree to destroy their male
                children&#44; and thus the future fathers of the nation&#44; had either been revoked
                or not rigidly enforced. Thus deplorably were the Hebrews situated in Egypt&#44;
                when that wonderful event&#44; which is known as the Exodus&#44; or the going forth
                of Israel&#39;s descend&#8211; ants&#44; took place&#44; four hundred and thirty
                years after Abraham had begun his pilgrimage. The God who had aided the first
                patriarch when he proclaimed his Name&#44; would not let the truth perish so
                hopelessly so ingloriously&#44; as it was then in danger of doing. But He wanted no
                proud nation to proclaim his word&#59; He would not permit the fire and sword to be
                the in&#8211; struments in proyagating his Law &#59; He rather chose those who had
                been humbled&#44; who had no affiliated tribe among all mankind&#44; to become the
                recipients of the highest elements of civilization&#44; and to constitute these
                ideas the very means of their existence as a people&#44; whether residing in one
                country or scattered&#44; as they now are&#44; over all the earth. It may be
                ob&#8211; jected to me for introducing this topic&#44; that it is not philosophical
                in an historical inquiry to speak of a matter which&#44; in its very nature&#44; is
                preternatural&#59; but to this it may be replied&#44; that the best solution which
                can be given of the deliverance of Israel from Egypt&#44; and the subsequent
                promulgation of the Ten Commandments&#44; is to assume the correctness of the Mosaic
                record&#44; and this teaches us to regard the whole <pb n="113"/> THE PAST AND
                FUTURE OF ISRAEL. 113 process as an evident act of divine interposition&#44; and I
                feel no hesitation in saying&#44; that I accept it as such with the full assurance
                of conviction&#44; and so ought every correct thinker to do&#44; until others can
                furnish a more reasonable explanation. We will assume&#44; therefore&#44; as a tact
                that&#44; when the doctrines of Abra&#8211; ham were the nearest to extinction
                through the hor&#8211; rors of a relentless slavery&#44; they were suddenly placed
                on such a foundation that they should never more be forgotten. A people was unbound
                from the fetters which held it fastened to falsehood and bondasre&#44; and rendered
                free both in mind and in body&#44; and made capable of existing only by means of a
                peculiar code then conlided to its keeping. If you ask me&#44; then&#44; What
                constitutes the true character of the Israelites&#63; I will tell you&#44; that it
                is not their shrewdness&#44; not their cunning&#44; not their love of money&#44; not
                their poetry&#44; not their aptness for music and language&#44; not their old
                military prowess&#44; not their present timidity&#44; not their ancient agricultural
                skill&#44; not their present apathy for field&#8211;labour&#44; nothing in fact
                which the out&#8211; ward world calls great and little in the character of a nation
                or individuals&#44; but the possession of a set of ideas&#44; which took their rise
                with the first parent of their race&#44; and which they have carried with them in
                all their varied fortunes&#44; as shepherds in the per&#8211; sons of Isaac and
                Jacob and their household when living as a single family in Canaan&#44; as
                sojourners and as slaves in Egypt&#44; as wanderers in the desert of Arabia&#44; as

                can con&#8211; ceive&#44; and yet we have seen always the most weighty reasons for
                upholding our characteristics as Israelites. If we had but spoken a few unmeaning

                also&#44; Israelites are now domiciled&#59; and in old Iberia itself the exiles
                will&#44; without doubt&#44; be soon admitted again. Thus far have we been re&#8211;
                warded for our perseverance&#44; in retaining that for which we fought and suffered
                &#59; and it was for this we toiled&#44; and cringed&#44; and traded&#44; and
                resorted to small ignoble pursuits &#59; for as Jews every noble avenue of life was
                shut to us &#59; and whatever else we have lost&#44; we have at least maintained our
                identity and our presence in history. Our unsociability is&#44; therefore&#44; not a

                was truly a sowing in tears&#59; we then promised what we meant to do in our
                cause&#44; and held up to your view the necessity there exists for teaching the word

                us was dim and dis&#8211; heartening&#58; our means were limited&#44; and&#44;
                unless the blessing of Heaven had smiled on our efforts&#44; scarcely a year would
                have elapsed without leaving our treas&#8211; ury bankrupt&#44; bereft of the means
                of farther useful&#8211; ness&#59; the difficulty also was not small of influencing
                the people with confidence in our ability&#44; so as to in&#8211; trust their
                children to our charge&#59; we ourselves were inexperienced in the manner of
                conducting such an institution as ours&#59; the machinery of our association was yet
                new and untried &#59; and to have failed would have jeopardized the cause so dear to
                our heart for years to come. It is therefore easily conceivable with how many
                misgivings the founders of the Education Society and its scliool looked to the
                practical results of the working of the new enterprise&#44; and with how much
                solicitude they watched&#44; fearing that some un&#8211; foreseen event&#44; some
                discontent among the many who would have to work together&#44; would bring ruin on
                our infant institute. But we are happy to meet you to&#8211;day with the practical
                demonstration of our success&#44; in having at the present moment five teachers
                engaged under our charge&#44; with upwards of one hundred scholars on our lists&#44;
                and with an accumulated capital three times in amount to what we started with&#44;
                and in possession of this house in which we have met to dedicate it to the service
                of the God of Israel&#44; for a purpose deemed even holier than the house of prayer
                can claim&#44; for a seminary where are to be taught In&#39; faithful and zealous
                persons the law of God and the language of Israel&#44; to the children of Jacob who
                may resort hither in search of light and truth. And whilst doing this let us not
                forget the benevolent Israelite&#44; <pb n="119"/> A PLEA FOR RELIGIOUS EDUCATION.
                119 Jndah Tonro&#44; who&#44; before he quitted the earth&#44; let us hope for a
                better life&#44; thought of our eftbrts when he distributed his worldly
                possessions&#44; and left us a me&#8211; mento of his appreciation of the necessity
                of training Jewish children iji Jewish schools&#59; thus enabling us to acquire this
                building as a permanent home of edu&#8211; cation on a Jewish basis&#44; carried on
                for Jewish pur&#8211; poses&#44; calculated to make our children better men&#44;
                while enabling them to become familiar with their duties and privileges as sons and
                daughters of Abra&#8211; ham&#44; Isaac&#44; and Jacob. And let me here briefly
                ob&#8211; serve that&#44; however we might have wished Mr. Touro to have lived to
                enjoy the fruits of his benevolence in the good it is calculated to diffuse&#44; the
                merit is not less great in him that he did not&#44; as others would have done&#44;
                squander away his wealth on some im&#8211; practicable scheme which&#44; while it
                promises much&#44; leaves yet more undone. And let us hope that&#44; as Mr. Touro
                has led the way&#44; others will not be want&#8211; ing to carry forward the good
                merely begun by him&#44; until we shall be enabled to educate&#44; in this
                country&#44; all the children of Israelites in the highest branches of science&#44;
                without compelling the rich or the poor to place himself under non&#8211;Jewish
                guidance to acquire a knowledge of the every&#8211;day branches of education. But it
                is not our business to&#8211;day to praise the dead&#44; thougli it would have been
                ungrateful to have with&#8211; held the tribute due to the memory of our
                benefactor&#44; when formally enjoying the fruits of his bounty. Let us therefore
                proceed with the sketch of our operations with which I commenced. &#39;It was indeed
                with some fear that we resolved to open our school on the sev&#8211; enth of
                April&#44; 5611&#59; and had we listened to the coun&#8211; <pb n="120"/> 120 A PLEA

                we would assuredly have desisted from making the attempt. But the progress of our
                work has proved that we were in the right to judge the matter hoth practicable and
                useful&#44; and that it would have been wrong not to have commenced at the precise
                moment when the public mind had apparently become ripe for the enterprise. For
                see&#44; go where you will now&#44; in Boston&#44; New York&#44; Albany&#44;

                even San Francisco&#44; where Jews a few years ago were un&#8211; known&#44; eflbrts
                have been made&#44; or are making at this moment&#44; to impart religious
                instruction&#44; either sep&#8211; arately&#44; at stated times&#44; or daily&#44;
                in connexion with the usual elementary branches&#44; in the manner we are doing&#59;
                thus proving that Israelites have at length been awakened to the paramount necessity
                devolving on them to rescue our3&#39;oung members from the curse of
                iuditference&#44; which rests like a deadly pall on the sick spirit of so many Avho
                are of Israel. I have not the statistics at hand of the various schools
                enumer&#8211; ated&#44; nor can I at present designate the classes even to which
                they respectively belong&#44; nor even yet have I prepared myself with a tabular
                statement of our own doings&#44; deeming this particular matter more appro&#8211;
                priate for exhibition at another time and in another form &#59; but I have shown
                enough to convince you that the members of the Education Society&#44; however
                sol&#8211; itary they may have stood three years ago&#44; have now found many
                imitators&#44; and&#44; wliat is more to be rejoiced at&#44; successful competitors.
                It is this especially which has cheered us on&#44; to persevere in the dithcult

                of which requires care&#44; and not un fre&#8211; quently much
                self&#8211;denial&#44; more than you&#44; kind friends&#44; would be apt to imagine.
                Only consider how we began&#44; with means totally inadequate to the end in.
                view&#59; a capital of about two thousand dollars&#44; col&#8211; lected with much
                difficulty in various ways and after years of preparation&#44; was all we had to
                start with. From this we had to defray the expense of house&#8211; rent&#44;
                furniture&#44; books&#44; teachers&#44; and other incidental outlays&#44; and all
                this before we had secured a sufficient number of pupils to pay even a moiety of the
                out&#8211; goings. It is foreign to my plan to enter into elab&#8211; orate
                calculations&#59; but you can readily judge that&#44; even with the most niggardly
                economy&#44; nearly all our funds would have been consumed within two years&#44; had
                not a brave public spirit came to our aid&#44; especially as we soon found that our
                number of teach&#8211; ers would have to be doubled&#44; if we intended to do
                justice to the numerous pupils who sought admittance into our school. And let it be
                staled here once for all&#44; that not an applicant has ever been refused ad&#8211;
                mittance&#44; whether Jew or gentile&#44; whether he came with the fees which we
                usually charge&#44; or without means to satisfy the regular demands. We have
                strictly followed the object of our foundation&#44; to let all participate in such
                advantages as we could otter&#44; and that none should be refused&#44; let his
                situation in life be what it may. By a vote of the Portuguese Congregation&#44; for
                three successive years the sum of two hundred dollars was appropriated for our
                use&#44; which&#44; together with the members&#39; dues of three dol&#8211; lars per
                annum&#44; the school&#8211;fees for pay&#8211;scholars&#44; and the interest on our
                investments&#44; was the sum total VOL. X. 11 <pb n="122"/> 122 A PLEA FOR RELIGIOUS
                EDUCATION. from which we had to defray all demands on our treasury. At one of the
                meetings of the Board of Managers&#44; in the middle of the tirst scholastic
                year&#44; it was resolved to call for subscriptions to make up the deficit&#59; the
                appeal was cheerfully responded to&#44; and the necessary sum was realized. But what
                had been stated by those who opposed the collection&#44; among whom I must include
                myself&#44; that it would be proved by experience that such a collection could not
                be repeated for another season&#44; became soon evident to the collecting
                committee&#44; who found the task&#44; self&#8211; imposed as it was&#44;
                exceedingly unpleasant. When&#44; therefore&#44; the second year of our operations
                again threatened a deficit&#44; which would have had to be made good by a sale of
                the certificates in which our capital was invested&#44; it was&#44; after many
                consultations&#44; resolved to give a public dinner&#44; and to ofi&#58;er such
                attractions to the whole community as to induce many to join us at the festive board
                in the hopes of working on their liberality. But&#44; in order not to depend
                entirely on the impulse of the moment&#44; a col&#8211; lepting committee was
                appointed&#44; who made it their business to canvass among those they knew&#44; to
                ascer&#8211; tain the amounts they would bestow to our charity&#8211; fund&#44;
                which was to be shared with another benevolent society of our city. This committee
                was eminently successful &#59; and when we assembled with our invited guests&#44; on
                the evening of the 23d of February&#44; 5613&#44; we were sure of a surplus
                sufficient for our purposes above the outlay which the entertainment had en&#8211;
                tailed on our funds. But so well were our guests satisfied with the intellectual
                entertainment presented to them&#44; in addition to au abundant banquet&#44; that
                    <pb n="123"/> A PLEA FOR RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. 123 many additional donations were
                handed in&#44; so that the result far exceeded our expectation. Last yonv&#44; a
                similar dinner was gotten up&#44; but held on the 2d of February&#44; and&#44;
                though the surplus was not quite as large as on the first occasion&#44; it was
                sufficient for our need&#44; and it proved that we had calculated rightly in the
                supposition that there was sufficient public kindness not to let ow enterprise fall
                to the ground&#44; if the bestowal of money could prevent it. And let it not be
                supposed that Israelites alone contributed&#59; far from it &#58; a very large
                proportion was obtained from those who are not of our persuasion &#59; and it is but
                consonant with truth to assert&#44; that they gave to all appearance as cheerfully
                as did our own brother Israelites. It is gratifying to testify publicly to such
                liberality&#44; which gives ample demonstration that many regard not the creed of
                him who asks&#44; but only look to the object&#44; whether by fostering it the sum
                total of human happiness will and can be augmented. I could say much on this
                topic&#59; but I am admonished to be brief on it&#44; as so much more remains to be
                ofltered to your consideration. Enough that the man&#8211; agers were gratified at
                the noble response their appeal for public aid had met with&#44; and they went on
                ful&#8211; iilling the object of their union with the bounty thus placed at their
                disposal. But not alone the financial condition of our society was a subject of
                anxiety&#44; but the government of the school also&#44; and the means to be
                cmploj&#8211;ed to give satisfaction to the parents and guardians of the pupils
                intrusted to our care. Perhaps nothing could be more difficult than to reconcile the
                contiictiuo opin&#8211; ions entertained as to what ought to be done with <pb

                discipline to our school&#44; and as yet the ditficulty is not entirely overcome
                &#59; but where men meet for the purpose of acting in harmony for the general
                welfare&#44; as has been nearly always the case in our deliberations&#44; the path
                becomes generally easy to traverse&#44; and obstacles yield before a calm survey and
                a determination to surmount them. Hence we are grateful to be able to state
                that&#44; notwithstand&#8211; ing the usual withdrawal of the children of the poor
                and the middle classes from school after a brief trial&#44; which is experienced in
                every locality where attend&#8211; ance at school is not made obligatory as a
                police&#8211;law&#44; and the frequent removals from the city&#44; which is a
                phenomenon also often witnessed among us every&#8211; where&#44; the number of our
                scholars has gradually in&#8211; creased&#44; till it is&#44; as I have stated
                already&#44; above one hundred&#44; with every prospect of a yet farther aug&#8211;
                mentation&#44; the moment parents become aware that we are able to do them
                justice&#44; and to fulfil truly the duties we have assumed in establishing this
                first school under the Education Society&#39;s control. Do not forget&#44; ladies
                and gentlemen&#44; that it is not yet four years since we opened our doors&#59; and
                that we have scarcely yet acquired confidence enough to rely on our inherent
                strength&#59; and that there are many little ditficulties to overcome&#44; which
                many may think too small to cause any trouble &#58; and if you have then yet some
                fault to find&#44; we would thank you to inform us of your opin&#8211; ion at your
                earliest convenience&#44; and the Board of Managers pledge themselves that they will
                carefully weigh your suggestions&#44; and endeavour to profit by the hints 3&#39;ou
                may have the kindness to ofi&#39;er to their consideration. Only do not lightly
                imagine that the <pb n="125"/> A PLEA FOR RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. 125 errors in
                judgment you may see at a glance ought not to have escaped tbe eyes of the
                managers&#59; for tliey are but human&#44; like yourselves&#44; and their
                fallibility ouglit&#44; therefore&#44; to be no matter for astonishment&#44; though
                they are engaged in a holy cause. You must not forget&#44; at the same time&#44;
                that the materials at our command have not been the most manageable &#59; much has
                been expected&#44; perhaps too much demanded&#44; of a Jewish school&#44; which
                would not have been looked for in any other&#59; parents probably thought that&#44;
                having undertaken the management of an educational insti&#8211; tute&#44; we could
                at once mould teachers&#44; scholars and circumstances to suit our purpose&#59;
                and&#44; when the result was not such as they had imagined attainable&#44; they may
                have blamed us for not answering their an&#8211; ticipations. If so&#44; we would
                merely remark&#44; that the short period&#44; for so it is at last&#44; has not been
                sufficient to mature a system&#44; nor has it enabled us to prepare parents and
                children for such an institution as no doubt will grow up in the process of
                time&#44; when pupils have been long under our training&#44; and learned to
                appreciate the advantages they will derive from being educated under Jewish
                auspices. This brings us naturally to the principles on which we acted when we
                formed our Education Society&#44; when we opened this first school under our
                charter&#44; and which are to guide us still farther&#44; when we shall be enabled
                to open other schools&#44; to be followed ul&#8211; timately by a college&#44;
                whence the pupils are to issue armed with science&#44; and prepared with religious
                knowledge to act their part properly in the battle of life in which they will have
                to engage as men and Israelites. &#8212; Let us therefore exhibit to you the
                neces&#8211; 11&#42; <pb n="126"/> 126 A PLEA FOR RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. sity of
                proper Jewish schools. The objection has been made in my presence&#44; even by a
                minister of our religion&#44; that we are doing wrong to establish sec&#8211; tional
                schools for Jewish children &#59; that the general institutions&#44; both those
                maintained for the benefit of the teachers for their own emolument&#44; and those
                en&#8211; dowed by the state for the gratuitous instruction of all comers&#44; are
                fully sufficient for us also &#59; that we cannot expect to teach as well as is done
                there&#59; and that even if otherwise&#44; it is wrong to prevent Jewish children
                from mino&#8211;jiuo&#59; with their fellows of other creeds in their
                school&#8211;years&#44; when friendships and attachments are so naturally formed
                between con&#8211; genial and susceptible spirits&#44; which will endure for life to
                the advantage of all the parties &#59; that the family&#8211; circle is the place
                where religion is to be taught &#59; and that hence there is neither necessity nor
                propriety in erecting Jewish schools&#44; especially as we cannot hope for years to
                come to make them free &#59; and that there&#8211; fore the exaction of pay for

                their faith is viliiied&#44; without their having the opportunity of rebutting the
                foul charge. Do I exaggerate&#63; then inquire of your own children whether the name
                of Jew has not been made a term of reproach &#59; whether they have not shrunk

                children should not have their feel&#8211; ings wounded in their infancy for the

                which this is urged&#44; one would suppose that the Jewish family&#8211;circle was

                congregations&#44; having the ability&#44; to engage a suitable person as teacher of
                religion and Hebrew&#44; in addition to their Hazan&#44; who will have enough of
                min&#8211; isterial duties&#44; including visiting the people&#44; as this seems
                lately to be viewed&#44; though with doubtful propriety&#44; as a part of the Hazan
                &#39;s functions&#44; to perform&#44; without the superadded labour of preaching and
                giving instruction. If any one had been present in a large synagogue in a certain
                city on the last Day of Atonement he could easily have satisfied himself that the
                minister was taxed enough to read the Kol Nidre&#44; Shacharith&#44; Moosaph&#44;

                awful a strain very long&#44; and it is cruel to tax any man beyond his strength. I
                am for a good Hazan&#44; therefore&#44; as he is&#44; I do not underrate his
                services&#44; which few indeed can ever duly render&#59; but I think the public

                Now it is time that we turn to the last objection&#44; <pb n="139"/> A PLEA FOR
                RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. 139 that we cannot expect to raise better schools than are
                existing elsewhere&#44; and that&#44; as we are taxed for their support&#44; it
                would be hard if we had to tax ourselves to support our own sectional institutes in
                addition. But if we view the question calmly&#44; this specious counter&#8211;plea
                will not appear very formidable. It strikes a man who looks at the matter without
                being too much prepossessed in favour of public schools&#44; that it is after all
                not so very difficult to engage a number of teachers who are to give instruction in
                the elementary branches&#44; such as grammar&#44; history&#44; arith&#8211; metic
                and geography&#44; under the superintendence of Israelites&#44; selected from among
                those in whom the people have most confidence&#44; to as full an extent as this is
                practicable where the directors are chosen from the community at large &#59; since
                it is yet to be proved that Jews are not as well fitted for this task as any other
                sect or people. Hence&#44; it is not averring too much&#44; that we may safely
                promise to do all that is done elsewhere in the business of education&#44; provided
                only parents will assist us to discipline their children&#44; so that they will be
                obedient at school&#44; and study their tasks the same as they would have to do were
                they to attend any private or public school conducted by non&#8211;Israelites. It
                must not be imagined that lack of discipline&#44; or want of parental
                co&#8211;operation&#44; a rude disregard of authority and stubborn idleness&#44;
                will ac&#8211; complish any more in our establishment than these defects will
                elsewhere. Yet&#44; all other things being equal&#44; it is but reasonable to expect
                that Jewish schools&#44; both here and in other cities&#44; will be able to secure
                for our children more advantages than they can have elsewhere&#44; for the reason
                that the number <pb n="140"/> 140 A PLEA FOR RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. of our pupils&#44;
                in proportion to the teachers will in all likelihood be always smaller than in
                public estab&#8211; lishments&#44; where the largest possible amount of schol&#8211;
                ars will necessarily be placed under the smallest number of instructors. Public
                affairs must be con&#8211; ducted with much economy&#44; or else those who pay the
                taxes will soon make their complaints be heard by their delegates&#44; if these&#44;
                by their administration of affairs&#44; increase inordinately the burdens which
                weigh on the people. But&#44; admitting that we could not reach a higher point of
                excellence in education than is attainable generally&#44; though this may well be
                doubted&#44; I would still think it necessary that we should tax ourselves in order
                to have schools of our own&#44; which we can control ourselves&#44; and into which
                we can introduce a system of religious instruction&#44; for which the community at
                large does not&#8211;and should not provide. Public schools&#44; as republican
                institu&#8211; tions&#44; should of right be accessible to all on equal terms&#59;
                and consequently no one religion should have the preference over another &#59; and I
                deem it even of doubtful expediency to have the reading of the Bible&#44; out of
                what many call a sectarian version&#44; enforced&#44; though the book used should be
                without note or com&#8211; ment&#59; for&#44; as soon as a particular
                Bible&#8211;version is chosen&#44; the favoured society using this translation in

                various versions&#44; since as Israelites we have not the slightest interest which
                way soever this superiority be accorded&#59; for to us there can exist no authorized
                translation&#44; though all the Rabbins and scholars had been engaged in perfecting
                it&#59; because at best a version can only be a guide&#44; no decisive au&#8211;
                thority to decide any matter of doubt or collision. But the question of using the
                Bible&#44; or what people are pleased to call so&#44; may at no distant day become
                one of great public excitement&#44; and Jews may be ap&#8211; pealed to as to what
                they think on the subject&#44; and to what section they will give in their adhesion.
                It is evident enough to you&#44; that it would be exceedingly impolitic in us to
                become the arbiters between the parties J since our small numbers in comparison with
                either&#44; not to say both&#44; would expose us to much ill&#8211; will&#44; let

                view&#44; it may be demanded of our children&#44; and probably has been&#44; to
                read&#44; or hear read&#44; the books called gospels&#44; acts and epistles&#44;
                commonly bound up with the Scriptures&#44; improperly called the Old Testament&#44;
                as of equal weight and authority with Genesis and Isaiah &#59; and it is exceedingly
                doubtful whether any attention would be paid to the request of Jewish parents to
                de&#8211; sist from such a practice. For why should not the teachers read what
                they&#44; and nearly all their scholars&#44; consider the Bible &#63; for the sake
                of a few Jews &#63; surely not &#59; for they are the minority&#44; and have

                without note or comment &#59; but who warrants us that this will be strictly
                enforced&#63; who will assure us that a con&#8211; scientious teacher&#44; and I
                would not blame him if he carried out his religious convictions&#44; since to an
                hon&#8211; est man his faith is the highest principle&#44; may not drop a hint as to
                what he considers the meaning of some particular passage to be&#63; Could the
                children complain &#63; or would they have the necessary knowl&#8211; edge to detect
                the effort to make an impression on their mind &#63; and if they were to
                complain&#44; who would heed them &#63; and the parents in all likelihood would not
                deem it worth while&#44; and it would come with a bad grace from strangers to
                interest themselves in the welfare of other people&#39;s children. And do you not
                know any instances where such impressions have been made on the mind of your young
                friends&#44; that it was difficult to remove them&#63; Think a minute&#44; ransack
                your memory&#44; and I imagine you will find something to give confirmation to what

                gentlemen&#44; will agree with me&#44; that even in public schools where no religion
                is taught&#44; and in private seminaries where the principals are all persons of the
                greatest liherality&#44; some infiuence may be brought to bear&#44; even
                unconsciously to the teachers&#44; which will be anything but wholesome to their

                cannot&#44; however&#44; ask of the people to let us have the privilege of
                appointing religious teachers to visit the various public schools to instruct Jewish
                children in their faith&#59; and if the privilege could be granted&#44; it would
                conflict so much with the course of study&#44; that it would be only very
                imperfectly carried out. But do you believe that such a proposition to admit
                sectarian teachers into public schools would be listened to &#63; You know the
                general public sentiment as well as myself&#44; not to be convinced that it would be
                the death&#8211;knell of any party to breathe such a thought even &#59; and though
                it were carried&#44; there would be such a conflict between the endless number of
                persuasions&#44; that years would elapse before any preliminaries could be
                settled&#44; much less before oper&#8211; ations could be commenced with any hope of
                success. But granted even that we should succeed at length to have Jewish teachers
                rewarded for their labour by the state&#44; I for one would oppose our accepting the
                boon. It may do in France&#44; Holland&#44; and Belgium&#44; where&#44;
                constitutional states though they are&#44; and en&#8211; tire freedom of worsliipis

                matters are referred&#44; for Jewish reli&#8211; gious teachers to take their

                will not do to let the state meddle with religious instruction &#59; for then it
                would have a right to prescribe what religion should be taught&#44; and what
                particular branches should be embraced in the sum total of what is termed

                from all participation in the benefit&#44; which should either be conferred on
                all&#44; or refused to all. The only remedy we have is to do what we have done in
                our instance&#44; to erect schools of our own&#44; where we can engage teachers of
                religion at our own good pleasure&#44; prescribe to them what&#44; how&#44; and when
                they should teach&#44; without subjecting ourselves to state&#8211; control&#44; or
                allowing ourselves to be excluded from sharing in the distribution of the fnnds to

                equal claim thereto by right and fairness. The tax we impose on ourselves for the
                support of our schools is only a tribute we pay to our conviction of the necessity

                would tliink little of that Jew who could hesitate bringing this sacrifice to his

                re&#8211; tain their faith &#33; what persecutions and exclusions had they not to
                submit to&#44; because they were Israelites &#33; And here we shall complain of
                paying a small annual contribution to endow religious schools from which we derive
                all the benefits&#33; See again&#44; how much even comparatively poor people pay for

                noticeable progress&#44; after practising for years&#44; and compare it with what we
                demand of those who wish to come to us&#59; and then again cast a view on the large
                school&#8211;fees charged by what are termed private institutions&#44; where no more
                is tauo&#8211;ht than here &#58; and I am sure you will confess that the tax on
                knowledge which accrues to our funds is not to be weighed in the balance&#44; when

                it be faithfully carried out. Let it be recollected that Judaism demands sacrifices
                of its professors&#44; and in proportion as these are cheerfully offered on its

                will impress its characte&#8211;r on the age&#44; and control and shape the
                influence of our people. We have met to dedicate this edifice&#44; reared by those
                who worshipped and taught a plurality of gods&#44; to the service and teachings of
                the only Eternal One&#59; we have come to consecrate this as a temple of
                learn&#8211; ing&#44; wherein shall be taught those immortal truths that have
                survived the wreck of time&#58; and this&#44; though bigots&#44; misguided by false
                zeal&#44; have at times obscured their brilliancy&#59; though visionaries with
                re&#8211; forms and deforms have lured the tickle and wavering by their false lights
                &#8212; but all in vain&#59; as well might they attempt to hurl the orb of light
                from its sphere into the unfathomable sea and quench its fire. Our faith again
                shines on high&#44; cheering and inspiring our fond hopes&#44; and guiding our
                footsteps toward the promised land&#44; like that cloud by day and pillar of fire by
                night that guided and cheered our ancestors in their wanderings through the
                wilderness. Having glanced at the object of our assembling&#44; let us turn to the
                subject. At this time and place I need not plead for education when
                school&#8211;houses and halls of learning are scattered over the land&#59; when
                every village can boast of its seminary &#8212; even in the far &#34;West&#44; where
                the hardy yeoman scarce has felled the forests and upturned the virgin soil ere the
                school&#8211; master appears to plant the seed of knowledge. But&#44; my
                friends&#44; I appeal to you as Jews&#44; for a re&#8211; ligious education. If
                education be important&#44; how immeasurably important to us is a religious
                education&#44; <pb n="154"/> 154 A PLEA FOR RELIGIOUS EDTJCATION. whose faitli is so

                word&#44; we stand here the living links that bind the past&#44; with the present
                and the future. How can a Jew otherwise have a rightful apprecia&#8211; tion of the
                duties imposed by his faith&#44; that not only sets forth the obligations he owes to
                his Creator and to his fellows&#44; but even prescribes a complete code of kiws&#44;
                political&#44; dietetic and sanitary&#44; for his govern&#8211; ment&#44; founded in
                a wisdom that time the true test of all things&#44; proves has never been
                surpassed&#44; if equalled&#44; many of which have formed the basis of all human
                jurisprudence from their promulgation to the present time &#63; Few are the
                Americans learned in this&#44; and the knowledge that we possess is held by those
                who were educated in other lands. Hitherto there have been no systematic efforts to
                impart religious instruction&#44; owing to the sparseness of our numbers &#59; our
                fathers&#44; many of whom&#44; groan&#8211; ing under oppressions fearful to
                contemplate&#44; and de&#8211; spoiled of their bitter earnings at the whim of
                tyrants&#44; who smote them for no other offence than the worship of one eternal
                God&#44; severed the fond ties that bind man to his birth&#8211;place&#44; and the
                endearing attachments that cluster around his fireside and home&#44; whose sweet
                recollections linger in the mind to the last moments of existence&#44; and came
                hither to a new country&#44; a far&#8211; off land among strangers&#44; to enjoy the
                sweets of liberty and the fruits of industry&#44; and to worship in the faith that
                was hallowed by their fathers&#44; and to stand erect in the dignity of freemen. Our
                numbers have increased by immigration pro&#8211; digiously&#59; synagogues are

                on the shores of the Pacific&#44; where only seven years since were heard the whoop
                of the wild Indian and the growl of the bear&#44; stately edifices have been reared
                in which praises are sung to the God of Israel&#59; and school&#8211;houses should
                follow in rapid succession&#44; where should be taught the principles that are in
                the synagogue enforced. Providence has lavished his blessings with a bountiful
                hand&#44; and no cause now ex&#8211; ists to prevent us from the performance of our
                duty to the rising generation. Impressed with this&#44; a number of gentlemen at
                length formed the Hebrew Education Society&#44; under whose auspices this building
                was purchased and the school that assembles in it was formed. Long and anxious were
                the eflbrts for its establishment&#59; its foun&#8211; ders did not receive that
                encouragement from those for whose progeny they laboured&#44; and which their
                well&#8211; directed and well&#8211;meaning efforts richly merited&#59; funds had to
                be gathered&#44; suitable teachers obtained&#44; and even pupils solicited &#8212;
                no difficult task when we remember the many excellent public and private schools
                with which our city abounds. At length the parents grudgingly sent them as a favour
                to the gentle&#8211; men who were labouring to promote their and their
                children&#39;s welfare&#44; for no other reward than the con&#8211; sciousness of
                having performed their duty. Great were the difficulties and many the obstacles
                surmount&#8211; ed&#44; with a determination and energy worthy the noble cause. The
                Society&#39;s feeble resources were well hus&#8211; bantled &#59; at last its merits
                slowly began to be appre&#8211; ciated&#44; it was no longer a mere experiment&#44;
                and chari&#8211; table individuals contributed to its support&#44; when&#44; by the

                not unknown to benevolence&#44; the late Judah Touro&#44; our treasury was enriched
                by a princely sum. This school is now established on a permanent basis&#44; and an
                opportunity is now for the first time presented of receiving the rudiments of a
                systematic and thorough rehgious education&#44; without compensation and with&#8211;

                re&#8211; ligious instruction &#59; permit me to present in relation to it other
                considerations. We live in an active and stirring age &#59; events suc&#8211; ceed

                the spirit of the times&#59; and that which was regarded as perfect is changing with
                the transitions of the world &#59; new creeds are springing up like rank weeds&#44;
                and like them wither and die&#44; and new ones again spring up from their dust&#59;
                their advocates are engaged in pro&#8211; mulgating their doctrines&#44; with all
                the adjuncts of magnificent churches&#44; colleges and schools&#44; mission&#8211;
                ary&#8211; and tract&#8211;societies&#44; whose ramifications extend to the

                solitary and suffering in a large city where he is nn known and a stranger. In small
                communities the distress of any one of their members is soon known&#44; and will
                probably meet with ready relief But it is in large cities where one feels his
                loneliness most keenly. To wander up and down the magnificent avenues of
                commerce&#44; or where fortune has taken up her dwelling&#44; and to be conscious
                that in not one house of all around him he has a sympathizing heart to feel for
                him&#44; renders his position the most painful&#44; as he is conscious that he is
                alone in a crowd&#44; solitary amidst mighty throngs. Despair is then apt to seize
                on the unfortunate&#44; who is ill&#44; sore of foot&#44; and bereft of means to
                purchase the necessities which his suffer&#8211; ings claim&#44; and he may well
                wonder where he is to obtain relief amid the callous votaries of gain and pleasure.
                It is therefore well that the benevolent as&#8211; sociate together in large
                communities to provide asy&#8211; lums for all who need the aid of their
                fellows&#44; and to supply the means of relief before they are actually needed&#44;
                that the sufferers may not gaze around them in despair on the magnificence which
                meets their eye&#44; with a consciousness that of all they see there is noth&#8211;
                ing but misery as their share of life. And accord&#8211; ingly having acquired this
                property for the purpose of benevolence we are assembled here to&#8211;day to
                com&#8211; plete a good work&#44; which has been commenced in the name of&#34;
                religion and humanity&#44; and the realization of which has been enjoyed for some
                time past already by those whose sufferings appealed for aid and relief&#34; at the
                hands of their fell&#40;&#41;W&#8211;beings. You are all aware that it is not long
                since when we had not in this city&#44; in fact&#44; not in all America&#44; any

                associ&#8211; ated together to bestow aid on the poor&#59; to provide them with
                small sums to help them on their way &#59; to portion out to them garments and fuel
                in the winter season &#59; to supply them with physicians and medi&#8211; cines
                during sickness&#44; and to inter the deceased in Jewish cemeteries in the manner

                the moment his case of distress became known to us. But still&#44; when more was
                needed than the granting of temporary relief&#44; our hands were tied&#44; and the
                best we could do was to send the applicants to some institutions over which we had

                belong. But still our brothers and our sisters meet not with any religious

                receive from the common table&#44; what is prohibited to Israelites is not excluded

                precincts. The religious teachers&#44; who make it their business to visit the wards
                where the many afflicted are found&#44; speak to all of the hopes through a faith in
                which Is&#8211; raelites have no share nor portion&#44; and they bid the dying
                spirit to look for salvation from a being of whom we know nothing&#44; and to reject
                at that awful moment&#44; when the soul is about being severed from the aching
                body&#44; that blessed law and that trust in the Eternal God&#44; through which
                Israel alone can live and be saved with an everlasting salvation. It is for
                this&#44; therefore&#44; that we considered it our duty&#44; as have done our pious
                brotlners in all parts of the world&#44; to procure this house and these grounds as
                a temporary home for the afflicted&#44; whither they may resort to receive&#44;
                under the supervision of their own brothers and sisters&#44; that soothing care and
                kindness which are so grateful when the once vigorous limbs refuse to do their
                accustomed duty&#59; when the aching head cannot think&#59; when the surcharged
                breast can breathe with difficulty only&#59; when the burning fever palsies the arm
                and foot&#44; and makes rest compulsory. Here&#44; then&#44; our sufferers may come
                and claim it as a right to be under Jewish supervision &#59; to pray with&#8211; out
                molestation and annoyance&#44; without the malign surveillance of hostile priests
                and female devotees&#44; according to the practice of our ancestors &#59; to enjoy
                the quiet of the Sabbath&#44; and the joy of the festivals&#44; as they were

                prejudices&#44; that the present age must pull down all the barriers which have been

                peculiarities&#44; and lay them as an acceptable offer&#8211; ing on the altar of a
                common humanity. For by this same reasoning we need not erect synagogues&#59; for we

                occasionally as something very desirable to be realized. But&#44; what was a general

                expected in institutions where oui&#39; religion is not professed&#44; and that the

                the fact that of the seven members of the tii&#8211;st Hospital Committee&#44;
                one&#44; Mr. Lewis EI&#8211; linger&#44; who took a deep interest in the early
                proceed&#8211; ings&#44; and worked zealously for the accomplishment ot the
                task&#44; was summoned to eternal life about a year ago&#44; and left his work to be
                completed by others. Mr Sulzberger was impelled to bring the subject before his
                colleagues&#44; because&#44; when he was visiting one of the hospitals in our city
                for the purpose of makino&#8211; inquiries concerning a Jewish patient&#44; a member
                of his lodge&#44; as was his duty to do&#44; he was one day told that the sufferer
                was dead&#44; and on going to inspect the remains he found that the
                dissecting&#8211;knife had already been used to allow the curious physicians to make
                a post&#8211;mortem examination. Without stopping to inquire into the permissibility
                of such a step&#44; ao&#8211;ainsl which most of us naturally revolt&#44; as an
                outrage on the body of the dead&#44; there can be no doubt that it is a shocking
                practice in public institutions to degrade the remains of the poor into mere
                sidjjcds&#44; to teach young physicians the structure of the human frame and the
                diseases to which it is subject. It is in vain to talk about the claims of
                science&#59; enough&#44; it seems a profanation of the helpless dead&#44; to treat
                them in the manner indicated&#59; and if there were no other reason for our present
                undertaking&#44; we must applaud Mr. Sulzberger&#39;s honest zeal&#44; that moved
                him to uro&#8211;e the establishment of an asylum for the sick amono&#8211;
                ourselves where&#44; when sutfering&#44; they will have food against which the
                tenderest conscience will not revolt where&#44; when dying&#44; persons of their own
                faitli will repeat m their hearing the sacred watchword of our religion&#44; and

                remains will not be disfigured&#44; but be committed to Ktber Ylsracl like those of
                any of their brothers or sisters who die surrounded by their kindred in their
                houses&#44; and be followed by a few sympathizing friends at least&#44; and
                committed to the earth amidst the pray&#8211; ers required by our ancient customs.
                The proposal was not made in vain &#59; the meeting&#8211; accepted it without any
                dissent&#44; and a committee was appointed&#44; as stated already&#44; to carry out
                the resolu&#8211; tions&#44; and this promptly and without delay. Through this means
                a convention of nearly all the societies and congregations of our city was
                convened&#44; and after a number of meetings a constitution was adopted&#44; and the
                present Hospital Association organized&#44; during the winter of 1865
                &#40;5625&#41;. As may be expected&#44; large numbers of the sons of the covenant at
                once became members of the new society&#44; thus showing that they fully appreciated
                the actions of their managers&#44; and meant to second it honestly and truly&#44;
                and to prove that &#34; brotherly love and benevolence&#34; are not alone a
                motto&#44; but a reality of their Order. After the So&#8211; ciety was thus
                constituted&#44; the Board being substan&#8211; tially the same as at present&#44;

                work to carry into effect the object for which they had been chosen&#44; and they
                purchased&#44; after a careful comparing of different properties&#44; the one where
                we are now assembled&#44; but were not able to obtain at once possession of it&#44;
                and did not until April&#44; 1866. In the meanwhile&#44; in addition to many
                donations recorded in the printed list accessible to you all&#44; the Grand
                Lodge&#44; I. O. 13. 13.&#44; No. HI.&#44; gave a ball which realized above one

                congregations&#44; got up a fancy fair or bazaar in the month of January&#44;
                5626&#44; which netted upwards of live thousand dollars.&#39; You will hardly expect
                of me to give you a precise finan&#8211; cial statement &#59; but enough&#44; if I
                assure you that&#44; when we took possession of the property&#44; the whole of the
                purchase&#8211;money had been paid&#44; and we had yet enough left to put it in the
                good order for our purposes which you now see before you. Afterwards we
                purchased&#44; at a liberal credit&#44; pay&#8211; ment to be made in four annual
                instalments&#44; the prop&#8211; erty adjoining to the east and west&#44; so that we
                have now a front on a public street longer&#44; probably&#44; than any Jewish
                Institution in the country&#44; on which here&#8211; after our successors will be
                able to erect a structure which shall be a credit to the Israelites of
                Philadel&#8211; phia. We are fully aware that the present one is very simple and
                plain&#44; it strikes you not with its large and elegant proportions&#59; but it has
                every requisite for the purpose we had in view&#44; and we trust that it may be the
                means of ditfusing much comfort to those who may be compelled to seek shelter here.
                The house was opened on the 6th of August last for the reception of patients&#44;
                before it was dedicated solemnly as a hospital for Israelites. It was in the hot
                season of the year when so many are usually ab&#8211; sent from the city&#44; and
                though it was intended at first to fulfil the omitted duty soon after the holy
                days&#44; various causes prevented our accomplishing this wish&#33; But the idea was
                not abandoned&#44; and though delayed It IS not yet too late to dedicate this
                house&#44; its furniture and appurtenances&#44; with the land to the east and west

                may here call away to a better life. To one feature of our By&#8211;laws 1 want to
                call your attention before closing. Though the whole arrange&#8211; ments are
                strictly Jewish&#44; and though no one can be a member of our Society who is not a
                brother or sis&#8211; ter of Israel &#58; still are our doors open to the afflicted
                of every creed&#44; and several non&#8211;Israelites have re&#8211; ceived already
                the benefits which this hospital confers. It is in this connexion also pleasant to
                state&#44; that a benevolent member of the Society of Friends&#44; who is strictly
                catholic in her charities&#44; has made a present of five hundred dollars to our
                treasury&#44; after con&#8211; vincing&#58; herself that our Home deserves to be so
                en&#8211; dowed&#59; and I think that it is but right that mention should be
                made&#44; that this truly charitable lady&#44; Mary He Benneville Brown&#44; is the
                same&#44; who before this had already sent an equal sum to the Jewish Foster Home
                Society&#44; a kindred charity which strives to do for the helpless young what is
                here endeavoured to be aceompliished for the sick and the aged. It is by an
                interchange of acts of good&#8211;will and benevolence that inveterate prejudices
                may be ultimately over&#8211; come&#44; and that the wrongs of ages may at length be

                char&#8211; acter&#44; and prove man to be but little less than angels. &#34;We can
                contribute&#44; as in this case&#44; to hasten this hoped for result&#44; not by
                yielding up our identity&#44; but by a course of conduct&#44; which&#44; while it is
                strictly con&#8211; servative and Jewish&#44; proves that Israelites have a heart
                for all who sufler&#44; and an open hand for all that need. I could readily occupy
                hours to speak properly ou the momentous subject which has brought us hither. But it
                is time that I make way for others who are to follow me. Still&#44; I must advert to
                a pleasing circum&#8211; stance&#44; namely&#44; the celebration of the Seder&#44;
                the ser&#8211; vice&#44; as you know&#44; for the tirst and second evenings of the
                Passover&#44; which was duly celebrated by the inmates of this house on the last
                festival of redemp&#8211; tion. They met here&#44; where the distressed and
                suf&#8211; fering dwell&#44; to celebrate the great event of our his&#8211;
                tory&#44; in a new farnily&#8211;circle of which they are tem&#8211; porary
                members&#44; and no doubt their hearts were gladdened that they could thus keep the
                glorious feast&#44; with unleavened bread and bitter herbs&#44; just as the greatest
                and happiest household in Israel. If no other result were to spring from our
                work&#44; except that annually the afflicted could here observe the Passover of the
                Lord &#58; it would be enough to compen&#8211; sate those who have been active in
                this work for all they have done&#59; as such a privilege could not be en&#8211;
                joyed in any other house except where presides the blessed genius of Judaism&#44;
                the spirit of peace&#44; the spirit of charity&#44; the spirit of good&#8211;will to

                demands for the undertaking unduly great. It was then that the young daughters of

                active charity&#44; and that of other friends of our enterprise whom Thou didst

                and Gentlemen &#33; It is a matter of great regret&#44; than when any thing is to be
                undertaken by Israelites in Philadelphia&#44; tlie existence of a feeling of apathy
                strikes the most care&#8211; less observer. Our people here seem to have lost sight
                of the fact&#44; that in union there is strength&#44; while in division there is
                weakness. The few who are here this evening to respond to the call of charity are
                enough to chill my ardour&#59; and if any one had told me that the attendance this
                night would be so small&#44; I would not have believed it. But it is one proof more
                of the well&#8211;known truth&#44; that the very persons who are the loudest in
                talking out of doors&#44; are the last to contribute with their countenance and
                presence in the support and raising up of any good measure. It is not&#44;
                however&#44; my business to count an audience &#58; I will therefore proceed without
                farther&#8211; introduction. It may have seemed strange to many&#44; that having
                written for my magazine a few hasty remarks&#44; which were&#44; as some have
                supposed&#44; derogatory of this new &#42; A lecture delivered before the Hebrew

                my aid to increase its pecuniary means. The reason&#44; however&#44; of my apparent
                opposition was not that I would not desire the prosperous existence of this
                in&#8211; stitution&#44; but that I do not like half&#8211;measures&#59; I love to
                see a thing commenced rightly&#44; and carried out rightly. But I have always
                doubted&#44; and yet have my doubts&#44; whether there be sufficient energy of
                character here to follow up any project for a sufficient length of time&#44; so that
                it may come to maturity. The Jews&#44; indeed&#44; are not chary of their pecuniary
                means when charity calls&#59; for then they will cheerfully give plenty of
                money&#59; but in carrying out any particular measure strictly&#44; and with a
                single eye to the object in view&#44; I fear we are behindhand when compared with
                many other societies. Look at all the institu&#8211; tions that have been started
                here for the past twenty&#8211; five years&#8212; every one has languished for the
                want of sufficient support&#59; and at Avhatever meetings we have held&#44; there
                have always been absent those who are the loudest talkers out of doors&#44;
                including among them those who speak against us as inferior in intel&#8211; ligence
                to other sects&#44; and less liberal than other portions of mankind&#59; while&#44;
                notwithstanding their depreciating the character of other Israelites&#44; you cannot
                call upon these very persons for aid in any scheme calculated for the difiFusion of
                enlightenment or the promotion of charity. Let us take the following instance. It is
                now about SIX years ago&#44; when some of us first started The He&#8211; brew
                Education Society of Philadelphia. Of all the Jewish institutions in the United
                States &#40;and I think that I am acquainted with them alb&#44; there is not one <pb

                good&#8211;will of every true Israelite&#44; as this Society for the diffusion of
                useful and religious knowledge. Yet&#44; at every step which its founders and
                managers have taken&#44; they have met with the strongest opposition&#44; as though
                they were engaged in an enterprise which would necessarily bring disunion into the
                bosom of every family. There are not wanting persons who have endeavoured to cry
                down the seminary we have commenced&#44; and have said that they do not desire the
                existence of any sectarian school&#44; as though ours were such a one&#44; and
                therefore to be discountenanced. And when they were asked for subscriptions&#44;
                they refused them flatly&#44; in some cases even with rude&#8211; ness. That we are
                now flourishing and in a prosper&#8211; ous condition is not their fault&#44; but it
                is owing to the kindness of Providence which watched over us&#44; and aided us with
                the means to carry out the design we had in view. It is&#44; therefore&#44; that I
                dreaded the ill&#8211; success of the Foster Home pi&#39;oject when it was first
                started&#59; for I thought it would in all probability be strangled by the very
                persons who should watch over its birth. And I have seen too often the want of
                active sympathy in all our undertakings&#44; so as not to wish to have added another
                to the number of hapless societies&#44; which may struggle a little while against
                diiiicnlties and then fall into decay. But as the Foster Home Society has been
                actually called into being&#44; and whereas the ladies&#44; who always feel more
                than Ihe sterner sex for the wants of their fellow&#8211;creatures&#44; have
                commenced operations&#44; it would be cruel and unjust in every Israelite to refuse
                giving his support&#44; however slight&#44; and to aid it with his <pb n="177"/> OUR

                is no less true in charity than in every other thing. However small&#44;
                therefore&#44; any contribution may be&#44; it is of advantage to help forward the
                cause by as much as it is worth &#59; and however inetiectually one may plead&#44;
                still may this pleading be of some benelit&#44; and become&#44; ultimately&#44; the
                means to pro&#8211; mote the object in view by its influence&#44; when the gift
                itself is exhausted&#44; and the feeble voice is ren&#8211; dered silent by death.
                The many Jewish charitable societies&#44; in this and other cities&#44; established
                for every variety of objects&#44; demonstrate that it is needless to ask of the Jew
                to give&#44; and to prove to him the necessity of alms&#8211;be&#8211; stowing. No
                sooner does he see distress than his heart yearns to relieve it&#59; he must
                give&#59; he cannot rest while a fellow&#8211;being is in want of the necessaries of
                life&#59; and hence the Jew is pre&#8211;eminent for the be&#8211; stowal of
                charity. The very word&#44; by which alms&#8211; giving is designated&#44; shows
                what the Jew holds charity to be&#58; he calls it r&#94;p&#94;&#94;i
                &#40;Zedakah&#41;&#44; &#34;righteousness&#59;&#34; he esteems it a part of the
                duties by which he can alone merit divine tavour. The word is derived from the same
                root as the term pn&#94;f &#40;Zaddik&#41; &#34;the righteous&#44;&#34; an epithet
                applied even to God himself&#44; the Omnipo&#8211; tent&#44; the Creator&#44; the
                Benefactor of all that exists. The English term is derived from the Greek word &#44;
                benevolence&#44; or kindness&#44; signifying the princi&#8211; ple of love which
                moves a man&#39;s hand to give for the relief of another&#44; and that which
                diffuses joy and pleasure. It is then by these words that we signify the temper of
                our mind which prompts us to give and to hasten to the relief of the distressed. And
                so <pb n="178"/> 178 OUR CHARITIES. proverbial is this benevolence among us&#44;
                that even the boasted Irish charity sinks into insignificance when compared with the
                Jewish. Hence&#44; in every part of the world&#44; wherever the Jews happen to form
                a settlement&#44; their first organization is for the pur&#8211; pose of
                distributing charity with a liberal hand&#59; to bestow gifts to make the mind of
                the poor man easy when he looks despondingly on his sufi&#39;ering chil&#8211;
                dren&#44; or on his helpless wife whose limbs have been rendered useless by
                disease&#44; so that she is unable to labour for the support of her olfspring.
                Yes&#44; noth&#8211; ing is easier than to make the Jews purse&#44; so to say&#44;
                jump out of his pocket and to pour out its contents into the lap of the needy. But
                the mere giving away what we need not for our support is not all that is
                required&#59; for charity should be cliieily bestowed in order to raise the
                character of the poor&#44; no less than to relieve their pressing wants. To the true
                philan&#8211; thropist there is no spectacle so humiliating&#44; as to see the poor
                who appear to have no other prospect in life&#44; who care to do nothing else&#44;
                than to be fed by the hand of charity &#59; who can live in indolence&#44; stretch
                out their idle hands and be content to withdraw them&#44; so that they arc but
                filled with that which&#44; for the moment&#44; will drive away the pinching of
                poverty. And it is precisely such as these&#44; who fancy that all tlie
                righteousness of charity&#44; and all the benevolent lore which prompts it are
                there&#44; merely&#44; that they may be supplied with what they require to satisfy
                their urgent demands&#59; and they sink gradually into a state of proud beggary&#44;
                rather demanding than supplicating relief&#59; and&#8211; they eat the bread of

                humiliating spectacle to the lover of his species&#59; because he beholds here men

                inter&#8211; fered with by you or your counsel. They see the rich and envy them
                &#59; they behold the intelligent and are jealous of their higher station &#59; but

                deadened to everything save to satisfy their own bodily wants&#44; and to envy those
                who are above them. Now this teaching the needy to look to you as their almoners on
                every occasion&#44; is one of the worst con&#8211; sequences resulting from the
                system of giving indis&#8211; criminate charity to the poor who are constantly

                dependence of feeling among the humbler Jews than there is at the present day. And
                though we had at that time in all our societies not so many sources of revenue as
                there are now&#44; we had still enough to relieve all who applied&#59; and
                notwithstanding this&#44; we had almost every year a surplus in our treasury&#59;
                seldom indeed were we called upon to add voluntary con&#8211; tributions to our
                income&#44; as it was amply sufficient for all our purposes. Look at the case now.
                No matter how much you have increased the number of your societies&#44; and however
                often your treasuries have been made to overflow&#44; not enough can be raised to
                satisfy the demands of the constantly increasing poor. It is a melancholy fjict&#44;
                but one which cannot be doubted&#44; nor gainsaid&#44; nor argued away. I see one
                gentleman before me who has often acted with me as a fellow&#8211;manager in a
                beneficent associa&#8211; tion&#44; and there is also here the president of the Fuel
                Society&#44; both men of experience in these matters&#44; and they will bear me out
                in saying&#44; that with the increase of your charities&#44; the dependence of the
                poor has also been increased&#59; and we have seen that men&#44; who&#44; a little
                while ago&#44; were ashamed to receive what they had not earned by their own
                industry&#44; did not hesi&#8211; tate to go into the country on a trading
                expedition and leave their families unprovided for&#44; casting them as dependents
                on public charity. It is sureh&#39; an evil&#44; a growing evil&#44; and it ought to
                be stopped if possible&#59; for it is but right that our charity should ennoble&#44;
                not debase our fellow&#8211;men. Now what is to be done to increase the independence
                of the poor&#63; I ask you&#44; ladies and gentlemen&#44; will the multiplication of

                poor&#8211;house&#44; it will be yet more augmented&#59; for the more you tell the
                thriftless poor that there are charities&#44; asylums&#44; and treasuries of
                benevolence for them&#44; accessible without any merit or industry on their
                part&#44; the more helpless will they become. Do not misunderstand me as saying&#44;
                God forbid &#33; that you should not give money in charity to those who need
                immediate relief. God forbid &#33; that I should utter such a thousrht &#33; But I
                leave it to your own good sense&#44; ladies and gentle&#8211; men&#44; to determine
                whether it be always right to give&#59; whether it be proper at all times to put
                money in the hand of every one who asks for it&#44; and not to inquire into the
                character of those who are to receive it from you. To me it appears that you would
                do far better&#44; and subserve the cause of humanity much more ef&#8211; fectually
                by endeavouring to infuse into the humble higher aspirations&#44; and aiding them to
                dispense at length with your assistance&#44; however ample it might be. For&#44;
                recollect&#44; the needy can be lifted up to af&#8211; fluence by the same means you
                or your predecessors have risen to your present prosperous condition &#59; and it is
                really doing greater charity to point out the road to advancement to those who have
                not entered it&#44; than to block it against them forever by inducements to loiter
                in the path of indolence&#44; the surest bar to all progress. Look liow many noble

                eloquence to which senators listened in breathless silence&#44; or the fourth have

                &#63; If they had been reared in a poor&#8211;house&#44; would Clay have rescued his

                their loans&#59; for their gift is small&#44; and their shame is great.&#34; And
                this all experience will amply demonstrate. Let me in my distress go to my own
                brother&#44; if I have one&#44; who was born and nursed by the same mother&#44; and
                say&#44; &#34;Brother&#44; give me gifts&#59;&#34; and granted that he even bestows

                clothe them&#44; we must help them.&#34; Yes&#44; aid them &#59; for we must admit
                the right of every one who is poor to ask in order to be relieved. The Almighty has
                scattered his bounty everywhere&#59; and those who have themselves no means&#44; are
                at lib&#8211; erty to ask aid of you who have&#59; nay&#44; to demand a piece of
                bread&#44; while there is any remaining in the basket&#59; a stick of wood to
                burn&#44; while there is some left in the cellar&#59; a garment to wear&#44; while
                some re&#8211; main in the press. The needy should not perish&#44; so long as means
                exist anywhere to appease his hunger&#59; he has a claim on the score of humanity
                and religion which you cannot by any excuse disown. And hence&#44; in the minor
                matters just now indicated&#44; charity shonld be bestowed indiscriminately on all
                who need&#44; and this without any other inducement than that a fellow&#8211;being
                is in distress. But it is an absolute cruelty to place the respecta&#8211; ble
                poor&#44; without any distinction&#44; on the same footing&#44; with the undeserving
                and improvident. It is a shame that the man who&#44; without any fault on his
                part&#44; has been unfortunate in business&#44; should be put on the same level with
                the sturdy beggar&#44; who will not work though abundantly able to labour. But at
                the same time there is no discrimination in our present mode of distributing
                charity&#8211;funds&#44; and&#44; as things are con&#8211; ducted&#44; there can be
                none. Hence&#44; the respectable&#44; industrious&#44; and honest&#44; are treated

                something which they would rather hide from&#44; than reveal to the eyes of a
                prying&#44; unsympa&#8211; thizing world. I would&#44; therefore&#44; appeal to you
                to consider whether a system could not be devised&#44; under which the re&#8211;
                spectable should not be so much humbled when re&#8211; quiring and obtaining
                relief&#44; and the idle should be compelled to contribute something to their own
                sup&#8211; port. It may be difficult at lirst to accomplish this&#59; but it strikes
                me that there is a way to reach it&#44; and to do it judiciously&#44; which I will
                lay before you by and by. Holding myself the highest opinion of the efficacy of
                education&#44; let me come back to the school of the Hebrew Education Society of
                Philadelphia&#44; which we founded four 3&#39;ears ago&#44; and which is an
                institution which proclaims that it is ready to take the rich and the poor under the
                same roof&#44; to educate them in the same manner by the same teachers&#44; and to
                treat in the same kind way those Avho dwell in a palace and those who live in a

                difficulties to encounter of no ordinary kind&#44; and as various as the ingenuity
                of man can devise. But the present is not a proper place to dwell at length on this
                topic&#59; I will therefore merely refer to the unwillingness in the minds of those
                who are endowed with wealth to allow their children to associate with those of the
                poor. They say&#44; they will become contaminated&#59; acquire low habits&#44; low

                that poor children are not so graceful&#44; cannot enter a room as prettily as those
                who have learned dancing&#44; nor make so polite a bow as those who have been used
                to polished society all their life&#59; but it strikes me&#44; that all the
                rich&#44; and all the wealthy&#44; are not al&#8211; wa3&#39;s the most refined&#44;
                and are not necessarily wise and intelligent. I have seen rich men addicted to
                drunk&#8211; enness and other low vices&#44; and those who might have been well
                educated&#44; if they had taken advantage of their opportunities&#44; far below the
                level of the poor who had toiled under difficulties to improve them&#8211; selves in
                knowledge and science. To .say that those who associate with the rich must become
                wise&#44; is ut&#8211; tering a fallacy&#59; and to say that those who keep
                com&#8211; pany with the poor must become idle and vicious&#44; is also stating
                something equally destitute of founda&#8211; tion. Refinement rests in the mind&#44;
                and does not depend on the position of the man. Perhaps a poor person may be unable
                to conduct himself as politely as one brought up in the wealthier classes of society
                &#58; this is true&#44; and how should it be otherwise&#63; but &#34;a man&#39;s a

                high intellect and noble aspirations. The only remedy&#44; therefore&#44; by which
                you can cure the idea of dependence in the poor&#44; and to teach them not to look
                to you for sup&#8211; port&#44; is to educate them among yourselves. Let your
                children&#44; in this mingling together&#44; teach the poor how to live&#44; how to
                behave with propriety. By this your children will not become contaminated&#44; while
                they will see the deprivations to which the lowly are sub&#8211; jected under the

                little trouble&#44; from which the happy school&#8211;years are not exempt. Thus

                son&#44; the count&#39;s son&#44; the baron&#39;s son&#44; has no more prerogatives
                than the indigent doorkeeper who earns a small pittance by waiting in leisure hours
                on the rich scholars. And it may be assumed as an undeniable tratli that&#44;
                wherever education is freely diflused&#44; people will assuredly rise from their
                lowly estate. Thus&#44; there were formerly serfs&#44; at least in fact&#44; though
                not in name&#44; in Prussia&#44; who had to work for their landlords so many
                days&#44; as were specified in their leases&#44; with their servants&#44; carts&#44;
                and horses&#44; for the retainance of the small patch of ground on which they
                lived&#44; and this servitude could not be commuted for any price whatever. When
                knowledge began to be more general among the agricultural population&#44; the feudal
                system fell into disuse by its own weight. No bloody revolutions were witnessed in
                Prussia as elsewhere&#44; where the serf rose in rebellion to assas&#8211; sinate
                his master&#44; and where the tenants strove with deadly weapons against the
                landlords&#59; but the land&#8211; lords&#44; by the decree of the enlightened
                minister llard&#8211; enberg&#44; became themselves the emancipators&#59; and by
                degrees the poor man has grown to be of equal im&#8211; portance in the state with
                the nobleman. Education&#44; however&#44; is at the bottom of this peaceful
                revolution&#59; <pb n="189"/> OUR CHARITIES. 189 it would have been useless to give
                freedom where the capacity for enjoying it was absent&#59; for the people could not
                feel that they had the same rights as the rich&#44; without having an equality of
                mental cultiva&#8211; tion to appreciate this&#44; although they might have been
                conscious that they were created by the same Almighty Power. If&#44; therefore&#44;
                we wish to make the poor independ&#8211; ent of charity&#44; to abhor the idea of
                receiving without working&#44; we must educate them. At the same time we must not
                look back at the past&#44; when almost nothing was done &#59; but we should cast our
                views into the future&#44; in order to arrange our plans for the days which are
                coming. For we are yet in the infancy of our being in America. Some present now here
                to&#8211; night can recall the time when the Jews all over the country could be
                counted by tens&#59; when the syna&#8211; gogue of which I took charge
                twenty&#8211;live years ago had only about eighty male seat&#8211;holders&#59; and
                now let the president of the congregation&#44; whom I see present&#44; answer
                whether there is room enough for those who resort thither. This&#44; however&#44; is
                not the case only with the synagogue Mikvah Israel&#44; but like&#8211; wise with
                all others&#44; four in number in this city. On the holy days there is hardly room
                to stand in the synagogue Rodef Sholem&#44; much less to sit down &#59; but even the
                new ones are just as crowded as the older meeting&#8211;houses in Philadelphia. The
                same&#44; however&#44; may be said of every village temporary synagogue all over the
                country&#59; they are all over&#8211;crowded at the high festivals. This shows that
                we are on the eve of an important era of progress&#44; not at the end of our career.
                To say then that the Jew has seen his highest <pb n="190"/> 190 OUR CHARITIES. state
                of development in America&#44; is absolute folly. The Israelite has only commenced
                to be in tliis coun&#8211; try. If now we lay the foundation of our societies wisely
                and honestly&#44; the small beginnings may grow into a blissful and great
                ending&#59; hence&#44; if we have commenced our institutions in the right spirit and
                in the proper direction&#44; we should not despise the small and unsightly
                beginning&#59; and only by fostering what is noble among us can we arrive ultimately
                at the proper result. Let us apply this to the case of the Education Society. You
                may say that you have not yet seen the good it has done&#59; but reflect that the
                educational system which we have commenced is only four years old within one month.
                Thus far it has striven&#44; just as a settler in a new country has to do with the
                diseases to which he becomes subject by the change of residence&#44; such as the
                yellow&#8211;fever or any similar malady incident to the climate&#44; who&#44;
                though he may still be weak and feeble after his recovery&#44; will feel sure that
                he is exempt in future from a similar danger&#59; the climate had at first not
                suited him &#59; and by the attack of the disease which he has undergone&#44; a
                change has taken place within him&#44; permitting him a lonsrer residence in his new
                home without dan from local causes of sickness. Precisely this is the case with
                religious education among the Jews in America. It has survived the danger of
                acclimating&#44; and it has shown signs of vitality which its friends had scarcely
                hoped for and its enemies did not be&#8211; lieve it to possess. Or you may compare
                this ncwly&#8211; awakencd desire for information to the infantile state of man&#44;
                which is incident to many afflictions pecu&#8211; liarly its own&#44; which it
                has&#44; nevertheless&#44; to eucoun&#8211; <pb n="191"/> OUR CHARITIES. 191 ter. We
                may say then of our infant that&#44; though it has barely cut its teeth&#44; and has
                scarcely learned to walk&#44; it has already withstood some of the diseases which
                all infants have to encounter&#44; and we have well&#8211;ibunded hopes that it will
                survive later attacks of other disorders&#44; as it has triumphantly combatted those
                which it has already overcome. The practicability of uniting scientific and
                religious education has been already proved&#59; but there exists yet much
                disinclination in some parents to send their children to schools where the trainincr
                of the head and heart is confided to the same persons&#59; we must leave it to time
                to vindicate the propriety of the course we have adopted&#59; and then the
                means&#44; which are now neglected for the improvement of the moral state of the
                Israelites of America&#44; will to a surety be as eagerly seized as they are now
                left unheeded. In the mean&#8211; while we must rest satisfied with the experimental
                schools which we have started here and there&#44; and not expect too much at
                once&#44; by looking for results which cannot flow legitimately from the materials
                at our command &#59; still&#44; we may maintain&#44; that we are in the right road
                of ameliorating&#44; to a high degree&#44; the misery of the humbler classes.
                Now&#44; as regards the giving of charity&#44; I have al&#8211; ready remarked that
                we are pursuing a planless sys&#8211; tem&#44; which is&#44; in consequence&#44;
                fraught with more or less injury. IsTon&#8211;labouring and dependence I hold to be
                the most useless state to which man can be re&#8211; duced &#59; I have accordingly
                spoken with several gen&#8211; tlemen to ascertain if some strong eftbrt cannot be
                made to see whether the poor could not be compelled to improve their condition.

                public bounty of which he is the almoner. This is the case with every benevolent

                to the contaminating influence of a charity&#8211;hospital&#44; or a similar asylum
                of the insane. I will not enumerate instances within my knowledge&#44; of persons
                belonging to respectable native families being so treated. But it is evident to
                you&#44; ladies and gentlemen&#44; that you would do a great deal of good&#44; if
                you could find the ways and means by which you might succeed in establishing houses

                lot must otherwise be the resort to the poor&#8211;house. Some people have said in

                poor&#44; though they do not like a mere foster home. For my part I am no enemy of

                raised above your then condition&#59; but you must have experienced a corresponding
                depression from the want of hope. When you toil and labour&#44; and labour and
                toil&#44; and see that it is all of no use&#44; and that your efforts are fruitless
                &#58; everything will naturally seem to go wrong with you&#44; and your courage will

                the number of my hearers is so small this evening&#44; as I should be glad if the
                view offered to you might attract the attention and co&#8211;op&#8211; eration of
                many &#59; but you that are here can carry farther the plan I have laid before you
                from the in&#8211; most sincerity of my heart. I do feci that the Jew is a noble
                creature&#44; and hence his love of equality&#44; and his self&#8211;respect. You
                may think at times that he is obtrusive&#44; not polite enough when he addresses
                you&#44; or not obsequious to a sufficient degree when soliciting your kindness. But
                the nature of the Jew is such&#44; that he docs not feel that degradation in his
                mind&#44; nor the great distance of position which sepa&#8211; rates him from those
                higher than himself&#44; as men of other nations do. He is conscious that he dares
                to speak to his brother&#44; as a matter of right&#44; and to ask liim for
                assistance&#44; though he may be above him in life&#44; both as regards wealth and
                standing. For my own part&#44; I must confess that I do not feel myself in the least
                degraded by taking the poor man by the liand&#44; nor honoured by shaking hands with
                a rich <pb n="203"/> OUR CHARITIES. 203 man. The conviction which the Jew has&#44;
                that we are all children of the same God&#44; will preserve him walking erect in
                positions where others are apt to fall. The Jew cannot be made to believe that every
                person is so far above him&#44; as not to be a creature of God like himself&#59; and
                I say&#44; that instead of blaming him for this proud consciousness of equality&#44;
                we ought to praise him for entertaining it&#44; and regret deeply if he were to
                exchange it for that cringing and whining so often observed in the mendicants of
                foreign lands. We should therefore encourage&#44; by all means&#44; the Jew in
                maintaining his individual independence&#59; and to do this eftectually we should
                educate his children&#44; that they may be also imbued with the ancient high&#8211;
                born self&#8211;esteem as the chosen people of God. And if we mean to carry out this
                elevated system of train&#8211; ing in the persons of Jewish children&#44; if we
                wish to render future generations of our brothers an orna&#8211; ment to our name in
                America &#58; we must make it a rule that parents shall not be entitled to relief
                from our charities&#44; unless they give their children the ad&#8211; vantages of a
                religious and at least an ordinary gram&#8211; mar&#8211;school education. And if we
                had an association which could say authoritatively that no one should be aided from
                its funds unless he is deserving&#44; we would at once remove from all that feeling
                of dependence which teaches many to beg&#44; to ask&#44; to receive &#59; since a
                judicious and adequate charity would only be the reward of industry and integrity.

                support&#59; since idleness is not excusable in rich or poor. Therefore we may
                maintain that the idea that charity is a duty&#44; is perfectly just&#59; it is the
                essence of benevolence founded on religion. The one who has the means should give
                freely to him that needs his aid. But the idea that it is his duty to receive
                charity is false &#59; it is an irreligious notion that one is bound to support the
                able&#8211;bodied in idleness. The Bible teaches us &#40;Le&#8211; viticus XXV.

                as we live by in&#8211; dustry in a state of independence. Not locked up in a
                poor&#8211;house should our brother be&#44; but dwelling freely in his own home&#44;
                surrounded by his blooming children&#44; with his happy wife smiling upon him. We
                should therefore strive to render the poor man&#39;s home pleasant and holy&#59; to
                give him opportunity to rise from his humble condition&#44; and to educate his
                chil&#8211; dren to become industrious citizens and God&#8211;fearing men. But in
                addition to this&#44; we should provide a place of refuge&#44; a home for the
                unfortunate who have not the means to support themselves&#44; nor the ability to
                labour any Ibnger with their own hands. Only those&#44; however&#44; who can justly

                ADDRESS I. the end of life.&#42; My Friends&#33; We are assembled here this day to
                dedicate and set apart this inclosure as a burial&#8211;place for Israelites&#44; as
                a spot where they who are returned to the dust may repose side by side with those
                who have been dear to them in life. We dedicate it as a family burial&#8211;
                ground&#44; wherein they who desire it may purchase the right of being interred near
                their friends and rela&#8211; tives&#44; where their mortal remains may mingle with
                each other to await together the summons of the Most High to call them back to life.
                And&#44; though what is to be interred here is only the lifeless clay&#44; there is
                still a melancholy satisfaction in the thought that&#44; when our soul is fled&#44;
                we shall still be surrounded by those who were the near of kin of us&#44; though
                they&#44; like us&#44; sleep the slumber of death. Hence we have met to dedicate
                this ground for this purpose&#44; and we are assembled on this spot to devote it by
                prayer and word for the melancholy purpose for M&#39;hich it is destined. And we
                must not shrink from the contemplation which it forces on our mind &#59; for the
                doom of all is to pass away from this earth into its bosom&#44; and to quit&#44;

                &#40;Ecclesiastes vii. 2&#41; &#58; &#34; It is better to go to the house of
                mourning than to the house of feasting &#59; inasmuch as death is the end of all men
                &#59; and let he that llveth lay this to his heart.&#34; It is indeed well to turn
                aside occasionally from the merry scenes which attract us&#44; &#8212; from
                mirth&#44; the dance&#44; the sumptuous table&#44; the pleasant gathering&#44; and
                go where men lament the departure of some valued friend&#59; since if we live a
                short or long time&#44; whether we be cut off at our birth&#44; or our days be
                prolonged to the verge of extreme old age&#44; our end must come&#44; and death will
                gather us into his garners. &#34;It is the end of all men&#44;&#34; let us therefore
                prepare for its coming&#44; by leading such a life that we shall be prepared to
                exchange the mortal for the immortal&#44; the temporal for the eternal. And so also
                continues the same sacred authority &#40;ix. 5&#41;&#44; &#34;For the living know
                that they will die&#59; but the dead know not the least&#44; nor have they longer
                any reward&#59; for their memory is forgotten. Also their love&#44; and their
                ha&#8211; tred&#44; and their envy&#44; are now already lost&#59; and they will have
                nevermore a portion in all that is done under the sun.&#34; Yes&#44; even if we put
                aside all thought of our ap&#92;iroaching end&#44; the unwelcome conviction will
                force itself upon us in our most joyous moments&#44; that we nmst die&#59; that the
                rewards of our toil on earth&#44; the profits of commerce and the glory of our deeds
                will perish with us when we are borne to the <pb n="209"/> THE END OF LIFE. 209
                grave&#59; that our friendships&#44; our aversions&#44; our envi&#8211; ous
                heart&#8211;burnings at the success of others will not survive our activity&#59; and
                that even the memory of us will soon die away from the children of man. It is truly
                an unpleasant reflection that after all our striv&#8211; ing&#44; our pushing&#44;
                our ceaseless labour&#44; we shall not long survive in the recollection of those who
                are left after our going home to the earth whence we sprung&#59; but the fact
                is&#44; nevertheless&#44; so&#44; that few indeed of our acts will be
                remembered&#44; even if we are the ex&#8211; alted of the earth&#44; and that the
                vast majority of men pass away&#44; and leave no trace behind. Were it now that this
                were all of life&#44; who would desire to live&#63; how many pains&#44; how many
                suflferings&#44; have we not to endure from the day of our entrance on the stage of
                existence till its close &#33; Indeed the afflictions which Providence sends us we
                can submit to&#59; for in every trial there is a balm&#44; there is a con&#8211;
                solation which sweetens every bitterness. We can stand by the bier of the early
                departed&#44; by the grave of those with whose existence our own being was en&#8211;
                twined&#44; and say&#44; &#34;The Lord gave&#44; the Lord hath taken away&#44;
                blessed be the name of the Lord.&#34; We feel that they are safe within his holy
                keeping&#44; and we can resign them to the will of our and their eter&#8211; nal
                Father. But what can we say when the wicked tyrannize over us&#44; when we feel the
                agony of oppres&#8211; sion without the means of resisting it&#63; It is hard then
                to yield&#59; it is difiicult then to tell our swelling heart&#44; Be still. And yet
                there are men who delight in injuring their fellows&#44; who cause the tear of the
                widow and the orphan to flow&#44; who are known as those who are at enmity with
                their species&#44; yielding 18&#42; <pb n="210"/> 210 THE END OF LIFE. obedience
                only to the evil implanted in their nature. Let nie admonish you&#44; my
                hearers&#44; not to belong to the class just described. You know you must die&#44;
                you know that you must render an account of your actions before the unerring Judge.
                Be it&#44; therefore&#44; your effort to walk about among your fellow&#8211;men do
                ing good and seeking peace&#59; to comfort those who mourn&#44; and to aid those who
                need assistance&#59; so that the blessings of the helpless may follow you&#44; and
                your own sensations of good accomplished may sweeten the trials and afflictions
                which of necessity await j&#8211;ou. Permit me now to revert briefly to the object
                of your organization&#44; in which I have taken part as a member of your society. It
                has been said that you meant to separate from the congregations already es&#8211;
                tablished here in order to organize a new and changed form of worship. So far as
                known to me&#44; I can pro&#8211; nounce this charge unfounded&#59; if I understand
                you aright&#44; you merely have contemplated to have a family
                burial&#8211;place&#44; removed from the busy scenes of com&#8211; merce and the
                centre of a large city&#44; where the dead of your household may lie undisturbed by
                the march of improvement&#44; as it is termed&#44; and where you can purchase the
                privilege of interring all belonging to you in the same inclosure&#44; and not have
                their graves scattered over a wide space&#44; which privilege was hith&#8211; erto
                not attainable in the burying&#8211;grounds of the es&#8211; tablished
                congregations. In such a wish I see nothing unreasonable&#44; nothing against our
                established cus&#8211; toms&#44; nothing at which the most pious need feel any alarm
                &#58; and if it had been otherwise&#44; I would not have become a member of your
                body. But it may be said&#44; that by organizing a cemetery&#8211;association <pb
                    n="211"/> THE END OF LIFE. 211 where every person can purchase a
                burial&#8211;lot for a moderate price&#44; we may injure the finances of the
                congregations already in existence &#59; as many now be&#8211; long to them merely
                to have the privilege of burial in a Jewish burying&#8211;ground. I will not deny
                the force of this objection&#59; but so far from deeming it of any weight against
                our enterprise&#44; I would say em&#8211; phatically&#44; that synagogues would be
                better oft&#34; by being rid of such nominal Jews. They forsooth care not what they
                do all their life&#59; whether they violate all the duties incumbent on them&#59;
                whether they enter a place of worship all the year round &#58; all they wish for is
                to be buried as Jews when they can sin no more&#44; to be received into the place
                where the faithful rest&#44; when their career is ended. If this&#44; I say&#44; be
                all which attaches them to the synagogue&#44; they had bet&#8211; ter not visit
                it&#44; or rather&#44; hold nominally a seat there&#59; since it is not worship&#44;
                not devotion which impels them to it&#44; but merely that when dead they may be
                interred as Jews. This is wrong&#44; and only to be de&#8211; fended as a financial
                measure&#44; which is&#44; to say the least&#44; a matter of doubtful propriety. But
                let me urge you not to be less attentive to the welfare of the congregations to
                which you belong than you have been hitherto&#59; continue to contribute to the
                public treasury as though 3&#39;ou had not the right of burial secured in a cemetery
                of your own &#59; separate your&#8211; selves not from the bodies to whom you were
                for&#8211; merly attached&#59; and let it be seen that your belong&#8211; ing to a
                synagogue is owing to a nobler sentiment than merely to purchase thereby the right
                of inter&#8211; ment&#59; since it is just that we should come to the house of God
                for the purpose of uttering thanks to <pb n="212"/> 212 THE END OF LIFE. Him for his
                mercy&#44; to ask Ilim for assistance in the hour of need&#44; and to join with our
                brothers in invok&#8211; ing his holy and adorable Name. You have dedicated this
                land as a burial&#8211;place for Israelites&#59; as a Jewish society you have united
                to de&#8211; vote it as a spot where the departed of Israel are to sleep in the
                dust. Be it then your endeavour to prove that the life of an Israelite is something
                holj&#39;&#44; highly important to you. O do not Avaste away each hour as it speeds
                along&#44; in worldliness and trifling&#59; let not day by day flit past&#44; and
                lind you the same reckless seekers after gain&#44; the same devoted pursuers after
                pleasure. O speedily will the sand of life run low&#44; and all that we cling to
                will fade more and more from our grasp. As Israelites 3&#39;ou wish to be
                buried&#58; seek to prepare yourselves for your inevitable end&#44; by liv&#8211;
                ing as Israelites. You are sons of Jacob&#44; who was surnaraed Israel&#44; because
                he was considered a chief in favour with God&#44; who bestowed his love and blessing
                on him&#44; not from any favouritism&#44; but because he ful&#8211; filled the duty
                which he owed to God&#44; and to men as their fellow&#8211;mortal. This noble
                example ought to in&#8211; spire you with a sincere desire to imitate it to the
                ut&#8211; most of your ability &#59; and in every walk of life&#44; on every
                occasion&#44; forget not what may be justly de&#8211; manded of you as children of
                the great departed. And do not forget the words of the preacher&#44; who says
                &#40;xii. 1&#41;&#44; &#34;But remember also thy Creator in the days of thy youthful

                viirorous&#44; or robust in manly strength&#59; let us dash from our lips the
                foaming bowl&#44; while yet we can drink&#59; let us abstain from vain
                enjoyment&#44; before our strength has been wasted by excesses&#59; let us employ
                the time which is given us for nobler aims than gratifying earthly desires&#44;
                before the age of de&#8211; crepitude is upon us&#44; those gloomy days of a joyless
                old ao&#8211;e&#44; which is sure to follow on the indulgence of the passions&#44;
                when the thoughts of past pleasures the more embitter the feeling of inability to
                participate in them any longer. How much more becoming in us is it to use the gifts
                of God in moderation&#44; to taste of his bounties in the manner which his law
                permits ns&#8211; to eat and drink&#44; and pursue the delights of life with
                reference to the good of our soul&#44; no less than the gratification of the
                body&#59; by which we shall ef&#8211; fect that the years of age&#44; when they do
                come will not be a burden to us&#44; and we shall then be ab e to await the
                termination of our days as those who have founded their strong support in the mercy
                of their Creator. &#44; &#34;Because&#44;&#34; so continues the preacher&#44;

                may gaze on as our funeral procession passes&#59; but all this is nothing to us&#44;
                we must go to our eternal home &#58; &#8212; earth claims back her portion&#44;
                while God will take to himself what He hath delegated to our keeping&#44; &#34; When
                the dust will return to the earth as it was&#44; and the spirit will return unto God
                who gave it.&#34; God has given us the spirit to direct the house of clay in which
                it is placed&#59; but we should endeavour to preserve it pure&#44; that it may
                return&#44; when the day of separation of matter and spirit comes&#44; as holy&#44;

                chastisements&#44; the road to salvation. There is no evil in his government&#59;
                everything He dispenses is a means of our happiness&#59; nay&#44; death itself is
                but a transition from one state of life to another&#44; and it is the passage
                through the portals which open for us the mansions of eternity. God is too good to
                delight in the suiferings of those He has created&#59; there is no malevolence in
                his presence&#44; no pleasure when those on earth endure pain. Only when through the
                purifi&#8211; cation by suffering man&#39;s happiness can be secured&#44; does the
                Almighty permit what we call evil&#44; to befall us &#59; and in the same measure as
                we bear with resig&#8211; nation what He dispenses&#44; will be the purifying
                effects of the chastisement we meet with. They are to teach us to reflect on our
                past deeds&#59; they are to recall us to ourselves&#58; and if they do this&#44; we
                can freely thank our Father who has brought us back to himself by the rod which He
                sent&#44; when prosperity failed to chain us to his religion which He gave us for
                our happiness. O&#44; our God is good &#59; and we are his in health and in
                sickness&#44; in life and in death &#59; and let us invoke his blessing on our
                undertaking&#44; and pray to Him that it may yet be very long before the tears of

                soul is to be judged&#63; O it is a fearful thing&#44; that we have to confess&#44;

                themselves alone of all mankind had received a perfect freedom of action&#44; an
                exemption from visitation for their transgression. But is it well to trust to this

                certainty overtake us in common with other men&#44; and perhaps when too late we
                will discover that we have clung to a shadow&#44; grasped with unappeasable
                eagerness at vanity&#44; which flitted away and away from our sicrht&#44; the nearer
                we imagined we were about securing it unto ourselves forever. Especially is such
                worldlijicss reprehensible in a child of Israel&#44; in the descendants of those men
                who were selected as a people of God from amidst other <pb n="221"/> LIFE AND
                ETERNITY. 221 nations&#44; with signs and with mighty wonders. Un&#8211; belief must
                stand rebuked before a perusal of the his&#8211; tory of Israel&#59; there is too
                legibly impressed the tinger of Providence&#44; the guidance of our God&#44; who has
                con&#8211; ducted ns through tribulations without number&#44; to bear witness to his
                divine rule in the world which He created in his superabundant goodness. And for
                what was this selection made &#63; was it that we should live at ease&#63; in the
                enjoyment of all earthly things unre&#8211; strained and unrestricted &#63; The very
                reverse is the case&#59; we received the laws that we might live by doing them&#44;
                and we were promised blessing if we would abstain from what God had declared unto us
                to be unclean&#59; our pleasures were circumscribed&#44; and our days of labour were
                diminished&#44; in order that we might obtain the approbation of the Lord by
                yielding obedience to his voice. To judge therefore from the evident tenor of
                Judaism&#44; it was to be a religion for exalting the standard of humanity&#44; to
                teach an erring world to seek for happiness in things not pertaining to earth&#44;
                since in all matters of this nature we were hemmed round with prohibitions which
                attach not to the followers of other systems&#59; and accordingly we find that the
                holy men of the Bible always regarded the favour of their God&#44; to be obtained
                through obe&#8211; dience&#44; as their highest good &#59; they could and did arise
                superior to the trials of life&#44; and contemplated their end as an approach to
                their Creator&#44; as a return of a child&#44; after a long journey&#44; to the
                hospitable home of its parent. And in truth is it not our Father&#39;s house to

                wrath&#44; by refusing to walk in the way He bids you to go &#33; you will strive
                incessantly to make yourselves great on the earth&#44; without heeding whether you
                labour within the circle set unto you by the gracious permission of your God &#59;
                He in his good&#8211; ness points out the road to salvation&#44; whereas so many
                hurry away in their waywardness&#44; and heed not the blessed voice which resounds
                to them in so many ways to return to the safe inclosure whilst life is spared&#44;
                and they are permitted to earn beatitude through their own acts of obedience.
                Yes&#44; again and again is this call renewed&#59; as we read in Job xxxiii.&#44;
                &#34;If he prayeth to God&#44; He will be gracious to him&#44; and he will see his
                face in joy&#44; and render unto man his righteousness. If he hath acted harshly
                against men&#44; and he saith&#44; I have sinned and perverted righteous&#8211;
                ness&#44; and it hath not profitted me &#58; He redeemeth his soul from going into
                the pit&#44; and his life will see the light. Behold&#44; all these things God
                worketh twice&#44; thrice with man&#44; to bring back his soul from the pit&#44; to
                shine in the light of life.&#34; The light of the land of life&#44; the bond in
                which the spirit of the righteous is bound up with the Creator&#44; is the ultimate
                aim of the religion which He imparted to us from the be&#8211; ginning&#59; for that
                we are bidden to be obedient&#44; for that we are told to return if we liave sinned.
                No earthly prosperity&#44; you will easily observe&#44; is promised if we amend our

                righteous who induced many to seek their God will shine&#44; according to the
                prophecy of Daniel&#44; like the stars for evermore &#63; where&#44; though all will

                reflections which have forced themselves upon my mind whilst I was requested to
                accompany&#44; with a few words&#44; the remains of the de&#8211; parted Israelite
                which we have just borne to the grave. He had through his conduct obtained the

                many cases when distress fell upon those who could not help themselves. In our own
                congregation he always took an active part&#44; and without saying of the dead a

                And thou&#44; departed spirit&#44; go thou on thy way and arise to unending life
                amidst the servants of thy God on the day when lie will open the graves of his

                remember in mercy the spirit of thy departed ser&#8211; vant&#44; and grant him
                heavenly rest in thy presence&#44; with a forgiveness of sins and a pardon of all

                and cause them to look up unto Thee for consolation &#59; for Thou alone art our God
                who comfortest those who are grieved&#44; and rais&#8211; est up those who are bowed

                iniquity&#44; and become worthy of thy favour&#44; which is life everlasting. May
                also our prayer ascend unto Thee for the mourners of all thy people Israel&#44; and
                let it be thy will to cause thy spirit to breathe a hope of better things into their
                souls&#44; that they may be strengthened in Thee&#44; and bear with meek submission
                the ills which have been imposed upon them &#59; so that&#44; purified through the

                which has brought us together from so many places&#44; situated at a great distance
                from each other&#44; to this spot&#44; devoted to the repose of those who have
                departed this life &#63; What is the cause that on this field of death the unusual
                assembly of so many Israelites is witnessed&#44; in this city&#44; where none of
                their brothers in faith have their dwelling&#63; It is not&#44; as you well
                know&#44; to do homage to the remains of a brave warrior who has fallen gloriously
                in the defence of his country&#44; nor to honour the memory of one wlio has won for
                himself an imperishable renown in the world of letters &#59; but simply to commit to
                the bosom &#42; The late Mr. Touro departed this life at New Orleans on Tebcth 10th
                &#40;January&#41;&#44; 5G14&#44; and by his request&#44; as expressed long before
                his decease&#44; his body was conveyed to Newport&#44; Khode Island&#44; and
                interred in the Jewish cemetery there&#44; on Tuesday&#44; June 6th &#40;Sivan
                10th&#41;&#44; following. Sixteen congregations and societies were assem&#8211;
                bled&#44; and eight ministers. The Rev. Mr. Guthcinv&#44; of New Orleans&#44;
                delivered an affecting speech at the synagogue&#44; which had not been ojK&#8211;ned
                for many years&#44; and was found in oxcellent preservation&#44; and the writer of
                this had been selected by the executors as the per&#8211; sonal friend of the
                deceased&#44; to officiate at the funeral and to deliver a speech at the grave. The
                address itself will toll its own story&#44; and requires no comment. It simply
                paints Mr. Touro as he was&#44; and as I knew him. The full account of the funeral

                FUNERAL OF MR. TOURO. 227 of the eartli what is mortal of our friend&#44; Jiiclah
                ToLiro&#44; &#8212; a phiin man&#44; an unassuming merchant&#44; who breathed his
                last in the quiet of his chamber&#44; far away in the metropolis of the sunny
                South&#44; not surrounded by his own flesh and blood&#44; but those who watched over
                him from motives of duty and aftection &#8212; an af&#8211; fection enkindled in
                their hearts by his kindness and uniform charity with which he treated all who
                ap&#8211; proached him. Eighty years have elapsed since the minister of the Jewish
                congregation which then flour&#8211; ished in this isle of the sea was greeted by
                the birth of a son &#59; and&#44; after four scores of summer and win&#8211; ter
                have chased each other over our globe&#44; the wan&#8211; derings of this son are
                brought to a close&#44; and he is to be interred here where his kindred sleep&#44;
                mourned for by many who knew him not when living&#44; hon&#8211; oured by those to
                whom his person was unknown. And ask we &#34; Why &#63;&#34; The answer will present
                itself at once&#44; if you regard those who surround his bier. He amassed wealth by
                honest frugality&#59; treasures flowed into his coffers in the pursuit of his
                mercantile enterprises&#59; he had no one near him who was bound to him by the ties
                of blood and kindred&#59; yet he squandered not his acquisitions in extravagance and
                intemperance&#44; in boisterous wassail or secret de&#8211; bauchery&#59; but he
                relieved distress when it presented itself to his benevolent eye&#59; when he saw
                the naked&#44; he clothed them&#44; and those that needed food obtained it at his
                hands&#44; whether they belonged to his faith and country&#44; or whether they
                worshipped at other shrines&#44; and had first seen the light of day in foreign
                lands. And if 3&#39;ou had seen him in his daily walks&#44; you would not have
                suspected him to be the man of <pb n="228"/> 228 FUNERAL OF MR. TOURO.
                &#34;wealth&#44; and the honoured protector of the poor&#44; as he was &#59; the
                exterior of our brother betrayed not the man witliin. But when he gave you his
                hand&#44; when he expressed in his simple manner that you were wel&#8211; come&#44;
                you could not doubt his sincerity &#58; you felt convinced that he was emphatically
                a man of truth&#44; of sincere benevolence. And thus he lived for many years&#44;
                unknown to the masses&#44; but felt within the circle where his character could
                display itself without ostentation and obtrusiveness&#44; at a period when but few
                of his faitli were residents of the same city with him. But when they began to
                multiply around him&#44; his love for the people of his belief was awakened anew
                within him&#44; and he looked about himself for the means of supplying a permanent
                home for his religion in the vicinity where he resided. And if you have ever been in
                New Orleans&#44; where Mr. Touro lived for full half a century&#44; you will have
                seen an elegant structure&#44; with the necessary out&#8211;buildings attached&#44;
                which he presented&#44; somewhat more than four years ago&#44; to the
                congregation&#44; the &#34; Dispersed of Judah&#44;&#34; the Minister&#42; and
                President of which are now present to join Avith us in entombing the benefactor of
                their institutions. And if you have ever been present dur&#8211; ing the hours of
                worship in the house bestowed as a free gift&#44; without solicitation&#44; on his
                fellow&#8211;Israelites&#44; you may have observed a plainly&#8211;dressed old
                man&#44; seated in a corner in the upper portion of the S3&#39;na&#8211; gogue&#44;
                devoutly engaged in prayers&#44; not throwing about his eyes to the right or to the

                Creator&#59; and all the honour he ever received was the office of opening the ark
                where the testimony is de&#8211; posited before the reading of the law. And if you
                had been privileged to witness the depositing of the stone commemorating his noble
                gift beneath the en&#8211; trance of the synagogue&#44; on the day it was dedicated
                with song and thanksgiving to the Eternal One&#44; the God of Israel&#44; you would
                have seen the picture of heartfelt pleasure illuminating his placid countenance&#44;
                as he&#44; with his own hand&#44; applied the mortar to the tablet which witnesses
                that he voluntarily parted with a property which others would have regarded as
                securing them an independence for life. But when his hour came to be summoned away
                to the place destined for all the living&#44; was witnessed the greatest triumph of
                his abode on earth. While permitted to look forward to additional years of life&#44;
                in comparative good health&#44; his natural timidity pre&#8211; vented him from
                consummatino&#59; various benevolent endowments which he had contemplated. But when
                he saw that his time approached to die&#44; he dictated&#44; with an unclouded
                mind&#44; the manner in which his wealth was to be appropriated after his decease.
                And let me call your attention&#44; my friends&#44; to the noble manner in which our
                deceased brother&#8211;Israelite dis&#8211; tributed what still was his&#44; and
                over wdiich both his religion and the law of the land permitted him to ex&#8211;
                ercise an unchecked control. He thought of the widow and orphan in his own city and
                where he had dwelt in his youth&#44; and devoted a portion of his means to their
                relief&#59; and those to whom he has contided this trust are not of his own faith
                and kindred&#44; and VOL. X. 20 <pb n="230"/> 230 FUNERAL OF MR. TOURO. probably no
                Israelite will ever claim any benefit from these lunds. He thought of the poor in
                his own city&#44; and endowed a home of refuge to receive them in the day of their
                distress. He thought of those of his own persuasion who suffer from the lieavy hand
                of disease&#44; and supplied the means to afford them relief&#44; in seve&#8211; ral
                cities. He thought of the new and weak congre&#8211; gations in various towns&#44;
                and afforded them the means to carry on their holy mission in dispensing the
                bless&#8211; ings which our faith is so well calculated to bestow. He thought of the
                necessity of diffusing religious education to the children of Israel &#59; and with
                wise discrimination selected those institutions best calcu&#8211; lated to further
                this end&#44; to make Jewish religion and Jewish literature accessible to the
                greatest numbers&#44; lie thought of those heavenly societies whose mission it is to
                glide gently into the abodes of the poor&#44; to leave there the traces of
                benevolence&#44; to cheer spirits which&#44; without this&#44; would droop in
                despair and gloom. He thought of the afflicted iu the land of Israel&#44; to provide
                for them assistance in their distress&#44; and pro&#8211; tection against the arm of
                violence &#59; he&#44; the merchant in the far West&#44; who had lived for years
                separated from his people&#44; almost a solitary worshipper of the One God&#44;
                amidst those who acknowledged Him not alone&#44; forgot not those who still linger
                on the soil con&#8211; secrated by so many wonderful events which marked our early
                history&#44; to cheer them on in the depriva&#8211; tions to which they are
                subjected. And at last he forgot not cherished friendships&#44; some of which wore
                formed late in life&#44; and left them tokens of remoiu&#8211; brance&#44; in terms
                of affection and endearment. But more than all&#44; he clung&#44; with an attachment
                which <pb n="231"/> FUNERAL OF MR. TOURO. 231 nothing could sever&#44; to the
                man&#42; who had stood by him in the hour of trial&#44; on the field where the demon
                of war made sad havoc among the assailants atid the assailed of the place of his
                residence&#44; and bore him away to a place of safety beyond the reach of deadly
                missiles&#59; and he felt a pleasure in be&#8211; stowing on him the residue of his
                earthly posses&#8211; sions&#44; after satisfying the demands of benevolence &#8212;
                not because he needed this gift&#44; but to show that the friendship which had
                endured so many years&#44; which had been cemented amidst peace and war&#44;
                se&#8211; curity and danger&#44; deserved to be proved in a manner which few have
                the means to do. And let me say here&#44; in praise of the living&#44; that the gift
                has been well bestowed&#44; if for no other cause&#44; for the beautiful manner in
                which the residuary legatee has discharged all the trusts confided to him by his
                deceased friend&#59; no delay which the law permits has been suftered to intervene
                in the bestowal of the benefactions&#59; and what Mr. Touro had willed&#44; his
                friend discharged tu the extent he was able to do it. This&#44; therefore&#44; is
                the cause of so many being here who knew Mr. Touro only by name&#59; they come as
                delegates from various congregations and institutions to see the grave close over
                the mortal tenement cf so pure and benevolent a spirit&#59; this is the motive which
                brings Israelites and Christians&#44; the sons of Jacob and the gentile&#44; to
                mingle their regrets&#44; that one who was so kind&#44; so gentle&#44; so
                benevolent&#44; is not any more among us to witness the fruits of his benevolence
                &#42; The late Kezin D. Shepherd&#44; who however did not imitate Mr. Touro&#44; as
                he gave not a solitary penny to Jews and Jewish objects. This is a curious contrast.

                trust&#44; in a not barren soil. And well is this a fitting moment to dwell on the
                beautiful spectacle which could be exhibited scarcely in any other land. We
                Israelites&#44; strangers in this city&#44; come hither with the body of a beloved
                brother&#44; and leave him here to be watched over by those who are strangers to our
                creed&#59; we ask of the citizens of Newport to guard inviolate the grave of our
                friend&#59; not to sufter the rude arm of bigotry nor the grasp&#8211; ing hand of
                an avaricious march of improvement to invade the repose of the dead&#58; and we are
                sure that our wishes will be gratified&#44; and our request sacredly fulfilled. But
                after all&#44; Jews and Christians are alike interested in the deposit we make
                here&#59; and the city of Newport may well be proud that so rare a philan&#8211;
                thropist&#44; who practically exhibited to all the most beautiful traits of a
                heartfelt religion&#44; was a native of their city&#59; &#8212; especially as it is
                by his own request&#44; ex&#8211; pressed several years past already&#44; that he
                has been carried to the place of his nativity&#44; to sleep in the soil where his
                mother gave him birth. It is&#44; therefore&#44; to you&#44; citizens of this
                beautiful gem of the ocean&#44; that we confide the custody &#59; and when
                Israelites and strangers come hither in after&#8211;years&#44; they will thank you
                for having guarded the dust made sacred by the blessings of so many helpless&#44;
                whom his well&#8211;earned wealth was made to relieve. But it is time that we hasten
                to a close. &#34;We come not hither to praise a mortal&#44; but to consign him to
                the earth&#44; the final home to which we all must return &#59; for &#34; dust we
                arc&#44;&#34; and &#34; our days are only a shadow on the earth.&#34; Yet&#44; ere

                pleasures&#44; and what has been witnessed to&#8211;day will barely survive as a
                dream in the memory. Therefore&#44; let us utter some words of advice &#8212;
                peradventure they may have an in&#8211; fluence on our thoughts and actions&#44; and
                induce us to be more faithful to our trust&#44; find true to our duty to God and
                man. &#34;Well says Job&#44; &#34;Man&#44; born of wo&#8211; man&#44; is short of
                days and full of vexation. Like a blossom he cometh forth&#44; and is cut off&#59;
                he flieth away like the shadow&#44; and remaineth not.&#34; We realize this indeed
                in the residue of mankind&#44; except ourselves&#59; we wonder at the vanity of all
                earthly striving displayed by others&#44; yet are ourselves as frivo&#8211; lous and
                vain as all of them. Every man has his foi&#8211; ble which he cherishes&#44;
                &#8212; his idol to which he pays adoration. Yet&#44; there are moments in the life
                of the most careless and worldly&#44; when they realize their mortality&#44; when
                they are sick and weary of the bur&#8211; den which their vanity has imposed on
                them. Ouly one thing we cannot tire of &#8212; and this is&#44; the pursuit of what
                is truly good and beautiful&#44; which is&#44; in other words&#44; the exercise of
                virtue as expounded in the re&#8211; vealed will of God and its concomitant charity.
                When our heart overflows with love to our Maker&#44; when we have sacrificed to Ilim
                what we cherish of earth and its wealth&#44; we feel that we have done something
                which dignifies our better self&#44; which ennobles our spirit. When we have parted
                with our worldly means&#44; to establish some good institution&#44; or to deprive
                poverty 20&#42; <pb n="234"/> 234 FUNERAL OF MR. TOURO. and sorrow of their
                Bting&#44; a glow of boly peace per&#8211; vades our heart&#44; and we tell to
                ourselves &#34; Tliis is well done&#59;&#34; for the spirit of God sanctifies our
                deeds and throws a foretaste of felicity over our soul. Length of years&#44;
                however&#44; the greatest power&#44; the utmost pleasure&#44; the largest
                wealth&#44; the highest wisdom can&#8211; not afford this &#58; they are all the
                means of happiness&#44; not happiness itself. Therefore&#44; let us feel that we are
                mortal&#44; that our path is beset with thorns and briers&#44; but that death itself
                leads on to everlasting life &#59; and that trials&#44; overcome successfully&#44;
                confer immor&#8211; tal bliss. Let us be true to our trust&#44; faithful to our
                God&#44; and we shall obtain&#44; even in a worldly view&#44; more surely the fruits
                of a laudable ambition&#44; than by following the bent of avarice&#44; hatred&#44;
                and selfishness&#44; which sooner or later lead to our downfall. But if we love
                justice&#44; exercise benevolence&#44; and walk hum&#8211; bly with God&#44; we
                shall secure the good&#8211;will of man here&#44; and be children of salvation
                hereafter. And now&#44; departed brother&#44; rest in peace&#33; It was not thine to
                have eons and daughters to weep over thy inanimate clay&#59; but more was given thee
                &#8212; thou wilt have in the house of God an imperishable name which shall not be
                soon forgotten. And when after&#8211; generations drink in the knowledge of the
                faith which was thine&#44; they will rise up and bless thy memory&#59; inasmuch as
                thou wast made the chosen instrument to endow with thy labour the schools of
                learning where they arc instructed. And the widow and the oiphan and the suffering
                stranger will breathe thy name&#44; and ask of God to give thee heavenly rest in the
                abode of the blessed. And may lie who is all&#8211; merciful forgive thee thy sins
                and iniqiTities which <pb n="235"/> MR. LINCOLN&#39;S DEATH. 235 thou hast

                done his will. Amen. ADDRESS IV. MR. LINCOLN&#39;S DEATH.&#42; My Friends&#33; Since
                we assembled last&#44; yesterday afternoon&#44; in this house for worship of the
                Almighty God&#44; a fright&#8211; ful and unlooked&#8211;for crime has startled the
                whole land. This morning&#44; when I left my residence&#44; the papers announced
                that a murderous assault had been made&#44; late in the evening&#44; on the
                President of the United States&#44; but that at last accounts he was still
                living&#44; though without hope of recovery&#59; but since the commencement of the
                morning&#8211;service&#44; the pres&#8211; ident of this congregation has
                communicated to me that death has closed the scene&#44; and that Mr. Lincoln &#42;
                Substance of remarks made at the synagogue Beth&#8211;el&#8211;Emeth&#44; Franklin
                Street above Green&#44; on Sabbath &#40;Saturday&#41;&#44; April 15&#44; 5625. <pb
                    n="236"/> 236 MR. LINCOLN&#39;S DEATH. has been numbered with the dead. The man
                who was only yesterday&#44; perliaps&#44; the most powerful on earth&#44; who had
                nearly closed with marked success a war of vast dimensions&#44; which had raged full
                four years&#44; has been suddenly struck&#44; in the moment of his triumph&#44; by
                the fatal bullet of the murderer&#44; in the midst of a crowded assembly&#44; by the
                side of his wife&#44; and has been thus unconsciously hurried into eternity. A week
                had scarcely elapsed since he en&#8211; tered&#44; as conqueror&#44; the capital of
                his enemy&#44; where he sat in the chair erst occupied by the chief of the opponents
                of the government of the Union&#44; and he had returned in safety to the chief city
                of the country&#44; and tlie seat of its central power&#58; when the mighty ruler of
                the republic&#44; to whom the people had con. fided the government for another
                term&#44; who had an&#8211; ticipated so much that he had not yet accomplished&#44;
                was stricken down unawares&#44; unprepared&#44; and now lies low&#44; with none to
                fear him&#44; with none to do him reverence. For all that will be done hereafter
                will not affect him &#59; he rests from his toils in the arms of cold death. The
                history of the world gives us several instances of the murder of kings and other
                important persons&#44; and the Bible also has furnished us with similar occur&#8211;
                rences&#44; but especially the case of Abner&#44; the sou of Ner&#44; who was slain
                by Joab&#44; the son of Zeruyah&#44; the general of David. And let us take the words
                of this king&#44; as found in 2 Sam. iii. 33&#44; 34&#44; for the subject of our
                contemplation &#58; &#34; And the king lamented over Abner&#44; and said&#44; O that
                Abner had to die as the worthless dieth &#33; Thj&#8211; hands were not bound&#44;
                and thy feet were not put into fetters&#58; as one falleth be&#8211; <pb n="237"/>
                MR. LINCOLN&#39;S DEATH. 237 fore men of wickedness art thou fallen.&#34; David had
                hoped that&#44; by the union of the principal leader of Saul&#39;s adherents with
                the house of Judah&#44; peace and harmony would be produced in Israel&#59; he had
                re&#8211; ceived him kindly and dismissed him with marks of good&#8211;will&#44;
                when his benevolent purpose was rudely interfered with by the jealousy of Joab&#44;
                and the foul deed of Abner&#39;s murder sullied the reputation which his bravery had
                elsewhere achieved. In our instance&#44; too&#44; has the head of the United States
                been snatched away in the moment of security&#44; in the moment of triumph&#44; not
                by a hostile hand on the field of battle&#44; but by one who lay in wait to commit a
                deed of violence&#44; when his victim was surrounded by many friends in the full
                security of the absence of all danger. How bright must every thing have looked
                before him&#33; The leaders of the opposing hosts one by one had to retire before
                the armies of the Union&#44; their strong&#8211; holds had been captured one by
                one&#44; and it was im&#8211; agined that the noise of battle would soon cease
                ev&#8211; erywhere. And to celebrate this triumph&#44; a general demonstration of
                joy was to take place all over the land&#44; and this city was to be brilliantly
                illuminated&#44; and bells were to be rung merrily&#44; and the loud can&#8211; non
                was to thunder forth hi notes of triumph the victory achieved. But all this is
                changed now&#58; dark&#8211; ness will replace the light&#59; if the bells are
                rung&#44; they will utter only the funeral knell&#44; and the cannon will send forth
                only the measured minute&#8211;sounds as the token of general mourning over the
                land&#39;s bereave&#8211; ment. So fades human glory &#33; Respecting Mr.
                Lincoln&#39;s political career and char&#8211; acter it does not become me to speak
                &#59; politics is not <pb n="238"/> 238 MR. LINCOLN&#39;S DEATH. the province into
                which a minister of religion should enter. You are all familiar with the history of
                the conflict in which the deceased was engaged as the President of the United
                States&#44; and it would he use&#8211; less to enlarge on it at the present moment.
                But I may fittingly speak of the traits of the goodness of heart he displayed and
                his sense of justice&#44; of which I have become personally cognizant. I refer to
                the appointment of a chaplain to the hospitals in this city&#44; about which I wrote
                to him more than two years ago&#44; as it was deemed a hardship that Jewish
                soldiers&#44; when sick and wounded&#44; should not have the care and supervision of
                a minister of their own persuasion&#44; as those of other creeds have. Mr. Lincoln
                promptly acknowledged the justice of the application&#44; and soon thereafter
                appointed the Reverend Mr. Frankel to the office of hospital chaplain. And when the
                Senate of the United States had neglected to act on the nomination&#44; by which
                means Mr. Frankel&#39;s office terminated with the adjournment of the Senate&#44;
                Mr. Lincoln at once reappointed our worthy colleague as soon as his attention had
                been called to the case. He thus proved that he recognized in full our claims to an
                equality before the law&#44; and that he was not guided by sectarian prejudices.
                So&#44; also&#44; when General Grant banished the Israelites from the military
                district over which he commanded&#44; it was Mr. Lincoln who at once ordered him to
                revoke the unjust order&#44; and restored our brothers to their homes and pursuits.
                These in&#8211; stances have severally come under my own obser&#8211; vation&#44;
                and they speak loudly for the natural kind&#8211; ness of the late President&#44;
                which all can cheerfully acknowledge&#44; whatever their political opinions may <pb
                    n="239"/> MR. LINCOLN&#39;S DEATH. 239 be&#59; and let us hope that all in
                authority in America maybe animated by the same spirit of justice and liberality.
                But if we cast a scrutinizing view on the deplorable act of murder which has been
                committed on the chief magistrate of the republic&#44; we shall discover in it an
                evidence of the fearful moral deterioration which the desolating civil war has
                produced. It appears as though the recklessness of strife had loosened the bonds of
                society&#44; and that men have lost the appreci&#8211; ation of riglit and wrong.
                The rights of property have been in many cases not recognized with the nice
                distinction customary in the times of peace&#44; and also personal security seems to
                have declined with the habitual scenes of violence which have devastated the land.
                Formerly the President of the republic needed no armed men to guard him from
                personal harm&#44; the humblest could freely enter and speak with the head of the
                executive department&#44; who dreaded no danger from any one. But now&#44;
                notwithstanding the precaution taken to guard his life&#44; Mr. Lincoln has fallen a
                victim to the pistol tired by the concealed murderer. O&#44; it is terrible to
                contrast the two con&#8211; ditions of the republic&#44; the one of safety to
                all&#44; with the present&#44; when secret danger threatens even those high in
                authority &#33; It behoves us all to contribute our share to alter this state of
                things. Every man for himself should endeavour to review his moral char&#8211;
                acter&#44; and apply the corrective of the divine law to cleanse himself from
                evil&#44; and to counteract the tend&#8211; ency to wrong&#8211;doing which is now
                so universally prevalent. We Israelites&#44; too&#44; have much to answer for&#59; I
                acknowledge that we are not addicted to slay&#8211; <pb n="240"/> 240 MR.

                violence against the property of others&#59; but for all that&#44; we have awfully
                transgressed&#44; and swerved in many respects from the path of ancient conformity.
                We have&#44; in many instances&#44; set the laws of God at defiance&#44; and done
                deeds which ought to call the mantle of shame over our countenance. &#92;Here the
                speaker referred to an especial occurrence which had lately transpired&#44; and
                which he thought it his duty to condemn pointedly&#44; though&#44; as far as known
                to him&#44; none of his hearers had participated therein. The matter relates
                strictly to a ceremonial Jewish law&#44; and has no interest for the general
                public&#93; Such things &#40;he then continued&#41; ought not to happen among
                faithful Israelites&#44; who should be distinguished not more for their
                philanthropic action towards all men&#44; than by a strict conformity to the divine
                precepts which they have received as the rule for shaping their life. We can at the
                same time best promote the welfare of the republic by a close observance of all the
                moral restrictions which religion imposes on us&#44; and by en&#8211;
                deavouring&#44; singly&#44; to stem the torrent of moral de&#8211; linquency which
                now is so generally prevalent. We have no separate interest from our
                fellow&#8211;citizens&#59; their weal and their wo are ours likewise. Israelites
                should therefore labour to identify themselves with all the other inhabitants of the
                country&#44; and prove the justice of their claims to an equality of rights&#44; by
                cheerfully sharing all the burdens&#44; and conforming faitbrully to the laws
                enacted for the government of all. When evil bd&#39;alls the land&#44; let us also
                share in the grief which afiiicts all others&#59; but above all let us <pb n="241"/>
                MR. LINCOLN&#39;S DEATH. 241 cultivate good&#8211;will and peace towards our
                fellow&#8211;men of all creeds. You must excuse me for speaking somewhat in a
                disconnected manner&#44; more so than is customary with me. The dreadful news and
                its suddenness have in a great measure overcome my usual composure&#44; and my
                thoughts refuse to arrange themselves in their wonted order. The crime which has
                just been con&#8211; summated is well calculated to appal even the stoutest of
                hearts. In the midst of a great military success&#44; the director of the national
                aifairs is struck down in a moment&#59; and with the removal of the controlling
                mind&#44; dark clouds seem to lower over the future of the land. Who will guide
                safely the ship of state&#63; who will handle the government with a firm yet
                mer&#8211; ciful hand&#63; Will those who will be intrusted with the settlement of
                the difficulties&#44; which meet our view everywhere&#44; have the capacity to
                comprehend the duties which devolve on them&#44; and to fulfil them for the benefit
                of all &#63; Only by a firm reliance on Providence can they succeed&#44; and not by
                trusting to their own strength and wisdom. Let us hope that they will choose the
                right path&#44; and be the means of restoring peace and prosperity to the land so
                lately heaving under the tumult of civil strife. &#8212; As to your&#8211;
                selves&#44; let me exhort you to reflect on the uncertainty of your life. You in
                general are not exposed to in&#8211; dividual acts of violence&#44; for the exalted
                are more threatened with danger than the humble&#59; the storm will uproot the lofty
                and branching oak&#44; and leave the lowly herb undisturbed&#44; though torrents of
                rain have flooded the place where it grows. Still all have to meet their end&#44;

                who has so untimely fallen&#44; let us ask the divine mercy which we all need to
                purify us from iniquity&#58; may his spirit be received amidst the blest&#44; and

                which each of you assumes new relations&#44; both to each other and society&#44;
                which are to endure during all your life&#44; as long as the Lord of all spirits
                permits you to dwell on earth. Hitherto both of you were free to choose another mate
                from the rest of the world &#59; but you vow to be henceforth to each other iVicnds
                in joy and in sorrow&#44; and to travel the round of earthly existence liand in
                hand&#44; and heart linked to heart. Think&#44; therefore&#44; well of the nature of
                the engagement whith you are going to assume&#44; and do not esteem lightly the
                weight of the obligation which <pb n="243"/> WEDDING ADDRESS. 243 will rest upon you
                from this moment. I will not ad&#8211; monish you to love one another&#59; since it
                is for this very reason&#44; because you cherish the kindest mutual affection&#44;
                that you have invoked the aid of our holy religion to bless your union in the
                assembly of Israel&#8211; ites&#44; who like yourselves acknowledge love and fealty
                to the sole God who rules all in heaven and earth. Reflect&#44; then&#44; that it is
                before the Searcher of hearts you avow fidelity to each other&#44; to be true and
                faith&#8211; ful on all occasions&#44; and to bear together the trials which will in
                the course of nature assail even the happiest. Imagine not that the joy of this hour
                will last forever&#59; think not that the vigour of youth will always impart
                strength to your limbs&#59; or that sick&#8211; ness and sorrow will never reach
                you. To expect this&#44; would be to suppose that the common lot of mankind is not
                to be yours&#59; and sure I am&#44; that you have told this already to yourselves in
                the recesses of your souls&#44; though perhaps your lips have not given utterance to
                your apprehensions. But&#44; even in the ordinary calm and in the highest prosperity
                which our existence is capable of&#44; there are constant occasions for the exercise
                of domestic vir&#8211; tues&#44; which&#44; when observed&#44; will render the
                married state one of happiness&#44; but which&#44; when neglected&#44; will envelop
                it with the clouds of sorrow. The husband must consult his wife&#39;s wishes&#44;
                she must obey his di&#8211; rections in the government of the family&#59; he must be
                indulgent&#44; she yielding&#59; he should counsel with mild&#8211; ness and
                moderation&#44; she acquiesce in all his opinions&#44; even if she occasionally
                fancies that her views are the best&#59; and she should look upon him in all things
                as the one she ought to obey&#44; excepting only when <pb n="244"/> 244 WEDDING
                ADDRESS. it regards the higher obligation which she owes to her God&#44; in which no
                husband&#39;s injunctions can be an excuse for transgressing the requirements of
                re&#8211; ligion. In short&#44; husband and wife must not only be loving and
                affectionate when strangers are there to observe them &#59; but in the retirement
                also of their domestic fireside&#44; when no eye save that of the All&#8211; seeing
                is upon them&#44; should they be like one soul dwelling in two bodies. God created
                our first mother that she should be a help suitable to her spouse&#44; wiiose
                existence preceded hers in the order of crea&#8211; tion&#59; and thus her daughters
                should seek their high&#8211; est happiness in the marriage&#8211;state by helping
                their husbands in all things&#59; by assisting them with advice&#59; by assuaging
                them with a pleasant reception on their return home from the cares which business or
                harass&#8211; ing occupations so often inflict&#44; and to be to them unwavering
                friends&#44; though all the rest of mankind should forsake them. Reflect&#44;
                also&#44; that it is not merely to gratify the feelings of love which now animate
                you both&#44; that you have a right to invoke the name of the Lord to hallow your
                union. For if this were all&#44; the civil law of the land could declare you man and
                wife&#44; no less than the servant of your faith. But such a marriage&#44; you
                Justly think&#44; would lack the sanction of religion&#44; &#8212; religion&#44; the
                soother of our sorrows&#44; and the only source whence the pleasures of life derive
                their high&#8211; est value. You&#44; then&#44; wish to be united not as mere
                citizens of the commonwealth&#44; but as followers of the law of Moses&#59; and
                you&#44; bridegroom&#44; are going to espouse this your bride after the ancestral
                manner&#44; by means of a golden ring&#44; in the presence of Jewish <pb n="245"/>
                WEDDING ADDRESS. 245 witnesses&#44; according to the law of Moses and Israel&#44;
                not alone the written word of the Bible&#44; but also the institutions of our
                people&#44; under which Ave have al&#8211; ways administered the precepts which the
                Scriptures contain. As a son&#44; therefore&#44; of Israel&#44; you claim this
                daughter of Jacob as your chosen wife&#44; and as such she accepts from your hands
                the token of union&#44; by which she pledges herself to be yours&#44; and yours
                only&#44; in feeling no less than in person&#44; till death severs the link which
                now is to make you one. Do 3&#39;ou understand&#44; both of you&#44; the importance
                of this public declaration&#63; Perhaps you do&#59; still bear with me a little
                while&#44; whilst I endeavour to illustrate it in your presence&#44; and I trust
                that you will respond to it inwardly with a sincere affirmation. You stand&#44;
                then&#44; now in the presence of God to make a covenant with one another&#44; to
                love and cherish each other mutually&#44; to bear together whatever mishaps or
                pleasures may be decreed to you&#44; and to contribute all that is possible to
                promote each other&#39;s happiness. But you avow this as Israelites in the name of
                God&#44; whose aid you hope for&#44; to guide you aright and securely in the
                perilous and slippery path of life&#44; and without whose blessing all your striving
                would be in vain. Know&#44; then&#44; that to obtain this last&#44; you must deserve
                his love and approbation by a thorough religious con&#8211; duct. Our wise men teach
                us &#34; that three obtain a forgiveness of their sins &#58; a gentile who embraces
                our religion&#44; a person who is raised to a high dignity&#44; and a man who
                espouses a wife.&#34; Hence has sprung the good old custom for the parties to fast
                on their nup&#8211; tial day&#44; in order to make it a day of atonement and serious
                reflection and repentance for themselves. But 21&#42; <pb n="246"/> 246 WEDDING
                ADDRESS. a day of forgiveness of sin it only can be when&#44; as at the annual
                period of atonement&#44; the wrong is sin&#8211; cerely repented of&#44; and a
                resolution is adopted to sin no more. No man passes through the active turmoil of
                life without transgression &#59; the best&#44; therefore&#44; has a necessity of
                being forgiven&#44; and must humble him&#8211; self before God to entreat a
                remission of iniquity. If&#44; however&#44; a new life is commenced with the day of
                marriage &#59; if it is really the beginning of a renewed love of God in our hearts
                &#58; we may justly regard it as a means of reconciliation with our heavenly
                Father&#44; whom&#44; in the wantonness of youthful feeling&#44; we may have often
                forgotten in the hours of our joys&#44; or neglected in not seeking his aid when
                darkness rested on our souls. Resolve&#44; then&#44; to let your future days be
                distinguished by an active love of the Creator and a sincere endeavour to observe
                his precepts. Should your union be blessed with children&#44; regard them not as
                exclusively your own&#59; but as pledges intrusted to you by the Supreme for you to
                watch over&#44; to see that they grow up in his fear and his service. Instil early
                into their minds&#44; that as Israel&#8211; ites you were born&#44; that as
                Israelites jow were mar&#8211; ried&#44; and that as such you devote them to the
                same faith for which our nation has laboured so long&#44; has suffered so much.
                Speak yourselves of the pleasant concerns of everlasting life in their presence&#59;
                and show them&#44; by a careful heeding of all your duties&#44; that the religion of
                God is the highest good in your estimation. In this manner alone can your future
                offspring &#34; rise up and call you happy&#44;&#34; to use the beautiful words of
                the philosopher&#8211;king of Israel&#44; and thus only can you accomplish the
                obligation you as&#8211; <pb n="247"/> WEDDING ADDRESS. 247 Slime in being united
                according to the law of Moses and Israel. In whatever situation you may be&#44;
                remember that you are of the children of Jacob&#58; wherever your future walk may
                be&#44; honour your religion by a uni&#8211; form holy life&#44; and a bold avowal
                of its principles. It has all the sources of consolation which man requires in his
                earthly existence&#59; it refers all to God&#44; who is ever near us to aid and
                assist us in all times of trouble and affliction &#59; and never for a moment think
                to hide your faith&#44; as something to be ashamed of&#44; from the eyes of
                strangers. Should your brothers in hope be assailed&#44; defend them&#59; should
                they be ill&#8211;used&#44; pro&#8211; tect them&#59; should they require
                assistance&#44; aid them&#59; should they be misguided&#44; instruct them &#59; and
                do in your own persons whatever is required to magnify the name of God&#44; and
                increase the respect which the world at large will ultimately feel for our
                heaven&#8211;born law. As regards your conduct towards each other&#44; I need say
                but little&#59; for this has&#44; without question&#44; been long since impressed on

                among the responsible sons of Israel &#59; till this day I was an innocent
                child&#44; pro&#8211; tected by the kind hand of parental authority&#44; watched
                over by its care&#44; and restrained by the fear of giving offence and pain to those
                who laboured for my wel&#8211; fare. Even the eye of the Almighty looked mildly down
                on my doings&#44; not exacting from me punish&#8211; ment for transgression &#59; as
                I was still under the guar&#8211; dianship of those appointed by Him to watch over
                my dawning life. But from this hour I am a man in re&#8211; sponsibility&#44; though
                yet a child in years &#59; I stand here on the entrance of manhood&#44; and I shall
                have to pur&#8211; sue the road which all mortals tread&#44; to the end of my
                earthly existence. Joy and sorrow stand ready to accompany me on this
                pilgrimage&#44; and good and evil will ever be there to claim my choice. O&#44; how
                deeply do I feel the new responsibility &#33; God bids me to listen to his
                command&#44; in order that it may be well with me &#58; while pleasure and sin
                invite me to &#42; Written by request of a very intelligent youth&#44; and delivered
                by him at the residence of his parents. Though I have composed several similar
                addresses for different places&#44; this is the only one now accessible. It seemed
                to me that simplicity should be the pre&#8211; vailing characteristic of such a
                speech&#44; not that elaborate work which is so often offered as the effort of young

                of the earth&#44; which so many arouiicl me will choose as their portion. &#34;Well
                may I tremble in view of the fearful struggle&#44; which awaits me like all
                others&#44; and of the danger which threatens me&#44; that through haste&#44;
                passion&#44; or ignorance I might lay hold of the evil and its sorrows&#44;
                neglecting religion&#44; its trials and its ultimate reward. Could I make the years
                of my childhood last for&#8211; ever&#44; could I hope to go down to the grave
                without tasting of the trials to which mankind are destined &#58; I might wish
                myself again into the midst of infancy&#44; so that my innocence and unconsciousness
                of evil might still continue. But this cannot be&#59; every one must go onward to
                meet his destiny&#44; while he has the means placed before him&#44; by God&#39;s
                mercj&#8211;&#44; to enable him to distinguish between good and evil. Knowing
                this&#44; let me entreat our Father in heaven that He will give me a knowledge of
                his law&#44; that as I am now a Bar Mitzvah&#44; a child of Israel through the
                capacity of a religious majority to be one of the chosen people&#44; entitled like
                them to participate in the privileges and burdens of our brothers&#44; I may also
                have the mental enlightenment to understand my duty&#44; and the will and the power
                to observe it all the days of my life. This day shall not be the only one of
                rejoicing to me&#44; but one also to be remembered always&#44; to remind me&#44;
                when I shall be tempted to transgress&#44; that to&#8211;day I have thanked God&#44;
                amidst the assembly of his ser&#8211; vants&#44; the house of Israel&#44; that He
                has given us the law of truth&#44; and planted everlasting life in our hearts&#59;
                and that I would commit an offence against truth&#44; if I permitted myself to
                forget the parents who gave me earthly existence&#44; the glorious ancestors from
                whom <pb n="251"/> BAR MITZVAH ADDRESS. 251 the Israelites have sprung&#44; and the

                that those&#44; who feel in my welfare the interest of blood&#8211;kindred&#44;
                shall re&#8211; joice to call me their relative. Much is not in the power of a
                child&#44; such as I am as yet&#44; to accomplish &#59; but this I can do&#44; I can
                resolve to be good and dutiful&#44; and I will trust firmly in the mercy of the God
                who chose us as his heritage to be with me in my pilgrim&#8211; age&#44; to
                strengthen my resolve for good&#44; so that I may acquire the dominion over the
                desire for transgres&#8211; sion&#44; to which our natural inclination might
                otherwise lead me. The future is truly before me like a sealed book&#44; which I
                shall only be able to read slowly with advanc&#8211; ing years&#44; and a greater
                knowledge of things than I possess now. But I will learn daily from those who are
                wiser and better than myself&#59; I will listen to the voice of religion which
                admonishes me to depend on God and not on human aid&#44; and not to follow the

                ADDRESS VII. EDUCATION.&#42; It has been frequently observed&#44; that the best
                safe&#8211; guard for liberal institutioiis is a correct moral and intellectual
                education. Where the public mind is enlightened&#44; there can be security and
                freedom&#59; but where the passions arc not restrained by the force of mental
                culture&#44; freedom is but a mockery. Well has Schiller said&#58; &#34; &#39;Tis
                dangerous to awake the lion&#59; terrible is the tiger&#39;s teeth&#59; but the
                fiercest of all ter&#8211; rors is man in his madness.&#34; Look back a few years
                past&#44; when the banner of rebellion and resistance was unfurled in France&#59;
                when the people burst asunder &#42; The Education Society of Philadelphia gave a

                the tyranny of the house of Bourbon. The tocsin sounded to call the people to arms
                and the deadly struggle&#44; and the once peaceful citizens&#44; and even the women
                of the fish&#8211;market&#44; seized the mur&#8211; derous knife&#59; and in the
                streets of Paris blood flowed in streams&#44; and all the land was lurid with the
                flames of the burning castles of the nobles. E&#39;ow turn we to the American
                Revolution&#44; which also commenced in a resistance to the powers of ag&#8211;
                gressors. America was a new country&#44; with three millions of people&#44; when
                they threw oif the yoke &#59; but the tocsin did not sound to awaken the citizens
                from their sleep&#59; they had learned the peaceful art of
                self&#8211;government&#44; and by constitutional measures they resisted their
                foes&#44; and with the laws in their hands&#44; like freemen fighting for their
                rights&#44; they raised the standard of the thirteen colonies&#44; united upon
                principles of justice&#44; and resolved&#44; by the force of arms&#44; to acquire
                the blessings of peace. Here is the difterence &#58; in the one case the people had
                been trained&#44; through a knowledge of the arts of peace&#44; and
                self&#8211;government&#44; and a religion founded on the Scriptures&#44; to respect
                ihe rights of all&#59; while the other had never been restrained&#44; except by the
                force of tyranny and war. As soon as America could gather up her strength to
                establish schools in every village&#44; hamlet&#44; and dis&#8211; trict&#44; she
                did so&#59; and the spirit of public education is spreading from one end of the
                country to the other&#44; from the Atlantic to the Pacific&#44; from the Gulf of
                Mexico to the St. Lawrence. And&#44; in our own com&#8211; monwealth&#44; there are
                schools where each child&#44; no matter if his parents are rich or poor&#44; can

                liiniself to exercise the duties of a free citizen&#44; and to become&#44; in
                turn&#44; a men ber of an independent commonwealth. We have always felt that
                education is a blessing to all &#59; and early in the mighty dawn of our history
                were we taught to rely&#44; as Israelites&#44; upon education&#44; to carry down to
                posterity that blessed law wiiich God gave to us as the highest good. Moses&#44;
                himself&#44; wrote dovvn the law which he had received from heaven&#44; by which he
                obtained the greatest treasure which God ever bestowed upon us&#59; and we were made
                the guard&#8211; ians to preserve it&#44; not alone for ourselves&#44; but for all
                men &#59; and&#44; though we never went abroad as mission&#8211; aries&#44; to
                scatter our religion among those differing from us&#44; we have done more&#44; Ave
                have preserved for mankind that standard undefiled&#44; unmixed&#44; and pure in all
                its elements&#44; in words&#44; syllables&#44; and letters&#59; and mankind rejoices
                in &#39;the possession of the Bible&#44; the undefiled and pure Word of God. The
                Bible&#44; the Sacred Will of God&#44; is made known&#44; if not directly and
                through Israelites&#44; at least through the means of Israel. We have preserved what
                God gave us&#44; through trials which tried men&#39;s souls&#44; amidst troubles
                which crushed other people&#44; and amidst sor&#8211; rows well calculated to test
                that characteristic which Moses spoke of&#44; whether we were that
                stiff&#8211;necked people and that unbending race&#44; which we proved ourselves in
                disobedience to him soon after we had stood at Sinai to receive from heaven the law
                and the testimony. Hence&#44; we of the Hebrew Education Society now appeal to our
                friends&#44; both those of Israel and the <pb n="255"/> EDUCATION. 255 Christian
                community present&#44; to aid &#34;us to teacli to the children of Israel that law
                which we have re&#8211; ceived. We are not of that illiberal spirit to suppose that
                out of Israel there is no salvation. No&#59; we maintain &#34; that the righteous of
                all nations are entitled to ever&#8211; lasting happiness&#59;&#34; but for the
                Israelites themselves there is no happiness beyond the pale of the law. It is for
                this reason that the Hebrew Education Society of Philadelphia banded together&#44;
                some years past&#44; to found an institution where our children can obtain a
                knowledge of our religion&#44; together with a scientific education. We
                acknowledge&#44; with heartfelt gratitude&#44; that the public schools are open to
                us&#44; and that there is no dis&#8211; tinction made between Israelites and
                gentiles. But we need something which the public schools&#44; founded for a common
                purpose&#44; cannot aftbrd us. But to ac&#8211; complish our end we went not to work
                to irritate the public mind&#44; to bring men of our own mode of think&#8211; ing
                into the legislature. We desired no such agita&#8211; tion. We came together to
                promote amongst us a religious education by our own efforts. In conse&#8211; quence
                of this&#44; two public balls were given and a private subscription taken up&#44; by
                which a consider&#8211; able sum was raised&#59; but we waited awhile before we
                commenced making use of the means thus ob&#8211; tained. When we found&#44;
                however&#44; that our children were increasing in numbers&#44; we hesitated no
                longer&#44; but established a school under a charter obtained from the legislature
                of the State&#44; permitting us to open district&#8211;schools in the city of
                Philadelphia&#44; and a college for the higher branches within the limits <pb
                    n="256"/> 256 EDUCATION. of the commonwealth. This privilege&#44; cheerfully
                granted us&#44; shows that the principle of equality is not only a name hut a
                reality and that when an appeal is made for what is right and proper&#44; Jew and
                Chris&#8211; tian are alike before the law. Upon this foundation we started&#59; and
                we have progressed for the last two years in advancing a knowledge of our literature
                and religion&#44; connected with a scientific education. But&#44; as I have just
                hinted&#44; our funds were well&#8211;nigh exhausted&#44; and we are re&#8211;
                solved to make a public appeal&#59; and it is not for a sectarian purpose&#44; but
                to give us an equality of rights&#44; with other persuasions who arc more numerous
                and wealthy than we are. Look around. It is but lately since the Jews were a mere
                handful in America. It was long before the Israelites of Europe appreciated the
                benelits of the liberty they could enjoy here&#44; and it is only during the last
                ten or twelve 3&#39;ears that they have emigrated in large numbers to these shores.
                Hence&#44; the means of our people are yet small&#59; we have not yet had time to
                consolidate our strength&#44; as we are still in our infancy as a religious
                community in this land. We have&#44; therefore&#44; appealed to our friends to
                enable us to place our school on a better foundation than it hitherto has been&#44;
                and we promise that&#44; whenever we are called upon&#44; we will be ready to act as
                good citizens&#44; and return the kindness which we have received. We wish to do
                something for the community in which we live. We wish to educate good and
                intelligent citizens&#44; who may be willing and able to contribute all in their
                power to the safety of the state &#8212; with their purse&#44; with their deeds&#44;
                with their body&#44; and&#44; if need be&#44; with their life. We wish <pb n="267"/>

                we call our own. We wish to teach them that&#44; as Israelites&#44; it is our duty
                to aid in the defence of our country &#8212; to identify ourselves with the
                followers of other religions in the upholding of its principles &#8212; to form one
                brotherhood &#8212; to be inclosed in the same bond of union&#44; and to be faithful
                and true to the constitution and the laws by which we are sustained. ADDRESS VII.
                UNION IN ISRAEL.&#42; Mr. President&#44; Ladies and Gentlemen &#33; &#34;Were I to
                follow my own inclination&#44; and have re&#8211; gard to the lateness of the
                hour&#44; it being near the time when this assembly is to adjourn&#44; I would thank
                you for the compliment bestowed on me by you&#44; and resume my seat. But the
                subject you have assigned to me to descant upon&#44; &#34;Union in Israel&#44;&#34;
                is of that character as always to claim a response from every one whose heart is
                sincere in our cause&#44; and hence it &#42; At a dinner given for the benefit of
                the Jews&#39; Hospital in New York&#44; on the evening of January 2Gth&#44; 5G14
                &#40;1854&#41;&#44; the late Samp&#8211; son Simpson&#44; Esq.&#44; presiding&#44; I
                was asked to respond to the last toast&#44; &#34;Union in Israel&#59; may the Hebrew
                Congregations in this free land&#44; by zealous co&#8211;operation in works of
                charity&#44; and by un&#8211; swerving adherence to our ancient faith&#44;
                strengthen the cords which bind us together as a nation&#59;&#34; which was done in
                substance as above. 22&#42; <pb n="258"/> 258 UNION IN ISRAEL. would be wrono&#59;
                in me were I to refuse floinsr honour to so noble u sentiment. If any class of men
                need union&#44; it is surely we of Israel. We are scattered all over the earth &#59;
                and it is requisite for us that we as such should have a bond that will unite us in
                one common embrace. It is by union alone that all our enterprises can grow&#44; and
                by it alone can they be sustained. And this assembly here to&#8211;night&#44; the
                so&#8211; ciety over which you preside&#44; Mr. President&#44; prove conclusively
                how much can be done&#44; if we once will to act in unison to promote any good
                object. It is not long since the &#34;Jews&#39; Hospital Society&#34; was started
                with many misgivings&#59; and now behold tlie result. The building is slowly rising
                above the sur&#8211; face of the ground&#44; through the generous contribu&#8211;
                tions which willing hands have cheerfully given&#59; and the noble liberality
                displayed here to&#8211;night will en&#8211; able the directors soon to place the
                roof on the sup&#8211; porting&#8211;walls&#44; and finish the chambers for the
                recep&#8211; tion of those who suffer from disease or wounds&#44; to be there
                attended by those who are Israelites like themselves&#44; and who will pour
                consolation into their spirit in the moments of bodily anguish. But&#44; as regards
                the support of the Hospital after its completion&#44; it seems there is no longer
                any appre&#8211; hension to be felt&#59; the public charity will not have to be
                invoked soon to supply what is needful for the requirements of the sufferers. We
                have been in&#8211; formed this day by telegraph&#44; as is known to 3&#34;0U&#44;
                that a liberal bequest has been left by Mr. Judah Touro&#44; who has been summoned
                hence a week ago&#44; for the endowment of the ffews&#39; Hospital in the city of
                New York&#44; which bequest&#44; if judiciously applied&#44; <pb n="269"/> UNION IN
                ISRAEL. 269 will&#44; there can be but little doubt&#44; bo for the present amply
                sufficient to relieve all those who may be com&#8211; pelled to resort thither in
                their hour of need &#59; and many an aching bosom will have full cause to return
                thanks to our Creator for having inclined the heart of Mr. Touro to signalize his
                last days by so noble a benefaction. Permit me now&#44; Mr. President&#44; to say a
                few words of the generous deceased. It was my good fortune to meet him on two
                occasions &#59; and I may say freely&#44; that perhaps no man was ever more modest
                and humble with so much wealth&#44; united with such rare liberality. He constantly
                performed acts of kind&#8211; ness &#59; but he did this almost by stealth&#44; as
                though he feared his good deeds should become known&#59; he dreaded publicity&#44;
                and was ashamed almost to be dis&#8211; covered as the bestower of charity. This
                simplicity of character was unaffected&#44; his modesty was unas&#8211; sumed &#59;
                and this is the man to whom many a sufferer will be indebted for the relief he
                obtains when once the roof of j&#39;our institution is firmly placed on the
                walls&#59; and so was Mr. Touro an example worthy of the imitation of those who
                think rightly&#44; and who feel for the sorrows of their fellow&#8211;men. But&#44;
                my friends&#44; though the Hospital is approach&#8211; ing to completion&#44; and
                its endowment is secured&#44; there are yet other objects for which union is
                neces&#8211; sary &#59; our religion demands of us that we should la&#8211; bour
                unitedly in its behalf&#44; and to exert our strength for its promotion. We are
                indeed Israelites by birth &#59; but this will not preserve us from learning ways
                and customs unknown to our fathers. We need instruc&#8211; tion&#44; we need zealous
                teachers&#44; and it is demanded <pb n="260"/> 260 UNION IN ISRAEL. of US that we
                take heed that we may enjoy the first&#44; and have many of the hitter. Let me
                appeal to your own good sense&#44; and let me ask you to look around 3&#39;ou&#44;
                and then answer me&#44; whether 3&#39;ou discover such a religious conformity as
                there might&#44; as there ought to exist&#44; if there were a closer union for the
                support of the fahric of our faith than there is discoverable among us. And still it
                strikes me that a remedy is within our reach&#44; which remedy will not fail of
                pro&#8211; ducing the happiest result. We need a union for scliools&#44; we require
                popular educational establish&#8211; ments for the training of our children&#44; and
                a higher seminary likewise&#44; whence shall issue those who are to become hereafter
                the teachers of the people&#44; the expounders of our sacred religion. It is
                disgraceful to American Israelites&#44; that whenever they want a minister&#44; or
                one to explain the law&#44; they must look over the ocean to find a suitable person
                &#59; at home&#44; they have none &#59; and as things are&#44; there is no
                proba&#8211; bility of their finding men among themselves quali&#8211; fied to
                assume the sacred charge. It would be im&#8211; proper to speak of my own history
                &#59; of the bitter ex&#8211; perience I have had to encounter&#59; but I may say
                that let one born abroad&#44; who is here without connexions or relatives&#44;
                labour ever so hard and faithfully&#44; it is almost impossible for him to secure
                fully the public confidence&#59; and still without this&#44; his means of doing good

                will always be as limited in this country as they are now. For let us look back at
                what we were when we two first met&#44; and you will acknowledge that twenty years
                have made wonderful changes in our condition in this country. Every where new
                congre&#8211; gations spring up&#59; the land is becoming full of us&#59; and the
                grinding oppression which the tyrants of Europe make us feel&#44; will cause
                many&#44; many more to resort hither for safety and freedom of action. In European
                lands&#44; in Asia&#44; in Africa&#44; we are greatly circumscribed in our rights
                and privileges&#44; with but few exceptions&#44; which only render the weight of the
                yoke of Israelites more galling&#44; because of the par&#8211; tial freedom enjoyed
                by others of their faith else&#8211; where. But here there is no tyrant to tell us
                what we are to do&#44; what we are to think&#44; what we are to speak. While the
                constitution of this land&#44; emanat&#8211; ing from some of the wisest men whom
                God has ever permitted to frame laws for the government of man&#8211; kind
                lasts&#44; &#8212; while this lasts&#44; we need not dread to advance in the career

                here our taith&#44; and bear aloft the sacred standard which was intrusted to our

                aftairs&#44; the dawning of which has come already&#44; the end of which no human

                general education &#59; the theme has been ably treated by so many eminent for
                knowledge and wisdom. My present object is to invoke your aid for a union to diffuse

                this matter &#59; it is no ill&#8211;will towards mankind we mean to foster by
                fix&#8211; ing the principles of Judaism firmly in the hearts of Jewish men and
                Jewish women &#59; it is only that we wish to train them to be true to their
                God&#44; whose law is goodness &#59; to be true to their fellow&#8211;men who like
                them were made in the image of their common Creator. By training them in this manner
                we give them the best opportunity of becoming benefactors of their species &#59; and
                hence our religious progress is of importance to all who feel for the welfare and
                the moral improvement of mankind&#44; irrespective of creed and nationality. By

                trust&#44; there is intelligence enough among us not merely to perceive what is
                needed&#44; but to labour also for the removal of the evil. The eyes of the world
                are upon us &#59; man&#8211; kind expects of us to do our duty&#59; and only by
                elevating our moral character&#44; only by standing forth as the children of
                light&#44; can we occupy that position after which we ought to strive with honest
                and well&#8211; directed efforts. It is with pleasure&#44; Mr. President&#44; that I
                have learned that you have generously bestowed a valuable piece of land for the
                erection of a Jewish College with suit&#8211; able grounds. But this is not enough

                from those ancient Patriarchs whose glorious names enrich the pages of the
                Bible&#44; and who flourished in the earliest records of authentic history. Their

                who are the lineal descendants of the family of Abraham. But&#44; though the

                There is Isaac&#44; who transmitted the inheritance of wisdom he had received from
                his father to his own offspring. And there is Jacob&#44; who&#44; amidst his severe
                trials&#44; forgot not what had been confided to his care&#44; and delivered it&#44;
                pure and undefiled&#44; to a numerous progeny&#44; capa&#8211; ble and willing to be
                the bearers of the sacred truth which was to distinguish them in their words and
                actions. Now it is these men whom we claim as our fore&#8211; fathers &#59; but
                Christians and Mahomedans claim them as their models&#44; to conduct them through
                the dark path of life&#44; as those brilliant meteors in the moral heavens which are
                to guide the voyager on the sea of existence into a harbour where he may anchor in
                safety and security. Equally great with the fathers of Israel were their teachers.
                Who that knows anything of legislation&#44; but must admire the laws which Moses was

                must admire David &#63; Who that knows anything of eloquence and prophecy&#44; but

                prophecies of Isaiah&#44; Jeremiah&#44; Ezekiel&#44; and their contempo&#8211;

                whether Jews or Christians&#44; in the great men whose names adorn the Bible&#44;

                ancestors&#44; who carefully preserved and handed dowji to us the treasure they had
                received. Ages have <pb n="269"/> THE FATHERS AND TEACHERS OF ISRAEL. 269 passed
                away since Abraham first forsook the plains of Mesopotamia&#44; to seek a new home
                in Palestine &#59; and ages have elapsed since Moses brought the Is&#8211;
                raelites&#44; who had been redeemed out of Egypt&#44; to receive&#44; at the foot of
                Sinai&#44; the law of Heaven&#44; which was to be their national code and individual
                guide. But ages have shown us no brighter character than Abraham&#44; and these
                passing ages have shown us no truer law than that which Moses gave. Mighty changes
                have been witnessed since that time on the face of the earth&#59; but the truth then
                made known remains unimpeached to this day. Well&#44; therefore&#44; may Jews and
                Christians assemble at a charity&#8211;ban&#8211; quet&#44; to return thanks to the
                Giver of all good&#59; thanks to Him who favours us with health&#44; vigour and
                intellect to labour for our advancement in all that ennobles human nature &#59; in
                all that tends to alleviate the sufterings which beset us here below &#59; in all
                that scatters blessings on the path of our existence. Were it not for this gift of
                God&#44; in vain would be the search of the philosopher to discover what is the
                truth &#59; in vain would be the toil to find what is the best calcu&#8211; lated
                for the happiness of mankind. As Israelites&#44; therefore&#44; we honour our
                ancestors&#44; and revere the teachers of Israel &#59; and Christians&#44; who hear
                me to&#8211; night&#44; they also must revere the bright lights which&#44; after
                all&#44; are those whom they follow safely&#44; and whom they admire as the guides
                whom Providence has as&#8211; signed them to point out the way they should go. This
                is no sectarian triumph which we celebrate &#8212; no idle boast which we utter&#59;
                it is not vain conceit which holds up the great characters of our people to the

                instruction and guidance. That is common ground for all &#59; that is the spring at

                of whom we are justly proud &#59; and they must feel grate&#8211; ful to us that we
                have preserved for all sons of men a legacy so true in its nature&#44; so beneficial

                your feelings were appealed to by the eloquent stranger&#8224; who had come among us
                from a distant island in the sunny south&#44; and you responded cheer&#8211; fully

                enabled the blessed undertaking to go on prosperously&#44; and to shed ita happy
                effects over many a young mind during the third year of its existence which lias
                just elapsed. It is but three years&#44; do not forget this&#44; since our be&#8211;
                loved sisters&#44; headed by one whom we all prize and esteem&#44; voluntarily
                stepped forward to remedy in a measure the lamentable ignorance of our youths in
                religious matters. It is but three years ago&#44; when there was no establishment on
                a large scale which could receive all the Jewish children of this city&#44; to hold
                up to them the law of God for their instruction&#44; and its commandments for their
                guidance. It is but three years ago&#44; when our children imbibed daily the poison
                of heterodoxy without any assistance to set them right&#44; by their constant
                hearing doctrines taught&#44; which are subversive of a Jewish life&#44; and
                inimical to a faithful observance of the precepts of the Lord. There was danger in
                those days&#44; that the natives of this city and of this land might gradually be
                weaned from the fellowship of Israel&#44; and induced to embrace the tenets&#44;
                erroneous though they are&#44; of the majority of our fellow&#8211;citizens. Ay&#44;
                the danger was pressing&#59; the churches of the gentiles are filled with eloquent
                preachers&#44; who can make tlieir wrong views to appear the better side&#44; to the
                uninformed at least&#44; by the gloss of fine words&#44; and the web of
                ingeniousness&#44; which long researches and plausible arguments have thrown round
                their system. Our constant intercourse with our neighbours makes it almost a matter
                of course to have frequent invitations extended to us to hear some one or the other
                of their highly gifted and highly ed&#8211; ucated public teachers&#59; it is not to
                be supposed&#44; that <pb n="273"/> DANGERS AND REMEDY. 273 they ai&#42;e
                insincere&#44; although we have every reason to suppose that their views are aHke
                unsound in correct reasoning no less than biblical deductions&#59; for their
                education has rendered them early familiar with no other&#44; and our ideas when
                lirst presented to them seem perhaps to their mind absurd and monstrous &#59; hence
                their evident sincerity&#44; their splendid flow of words&#44; their dwelling with
                apparent delight upon the blessedness of their religious hopes &#59; their
                professions of inward changes by what they term the free gifts of grace &#59; their
                assertions that the literal fulfilment of the precepts is no longer demanded&#59;
                their terrible denunciation of divine vengeance upon all who may not freely adopt
                their mode of thinking&#59; their glow&#8211; ing imagery of a redemption by an
                atonement for sinful humanity&#44; which&#44; they allege&#44; the believers
                af&#8211; ter their manner are alone to enjoy &#59; their appeals to our rejection
                from divine favour evidenced by our expulsion&#44; and banishment&#44; and
                captivity&#44; and dis&#8211; persion &#58; &#8212; all these circumstances&#44; I
                say&#44; are highly calculated to weaken the attachment which we should feel for our
                holy&#44; blessed faith&#44; unless we are pre&#8211; pared to withstand the attack
                thus levelled against our constancy by a thorough religious training after the
                manner of ancient Israelites &#59; for if even apostasy should not succeed an
                attendance on such teaching&#44; it might have the effect of weakening altogether
                everything like acquiescence in religious conviction&#44; since from ignorance of
                the premises we might be in&#8211; duced to reject everything we hear as alike false
                and unessential. &#8212; Tlie more even the gentiles approach our mode of thinking
                and interpretation&#44; the greater would naturally become the danger of a falling
                off <pb n="274"/> 274 DANGERS AND REMEDY. from our ranks&#59; for then the eloquence
                expended upon an illustration of their peculiar tenets would leave the line of
                demarcation so narrow&#44; that to a su&#8211; perficial thinker the difference
                would not be worth the trouble of maintaining at the great sacrifice which our
                religion demands &#59; and still as far as our religious interests are concerned it
                matters not whether we be&#8211; come apostates to the doctrines of Popery&#44; of
                Luther&#44; of Fox&#44; of Arian&#44; of Mahomed&#44; or of the school of the
                infidel disbelievers in all positive religions &#59; for in all instances the
                connexion with the Israelitish commu&#8211; nity would necessarily be severed&#44;
                and if the fidling off&#39; should unfortunately become general&#44; the name of
                Jacob would gradually die away from the list of nations. And yet this was the danger
                to wdiich we were exposed in this country without almost any countervailing
                means&#59; since the simplicity of our worship and the small number of the properly
                trained teachers could not&#44; with the worldly&#8211;minded&#44; compete with the
                magnificent exhibition in the churches of the gentiles&#44; the grand and solemn
                peal of the swell&#8211; ing music&#44; the rich and elegant psalmody&#44; and the
                multitude of expounders attracting large audiences by the charm of flowing words and
                suasive diction. Can we wonder that a laxity of religious conviction became by
                degrees too evident for concealment&#63; what should induce Israelites to remain
                faithful when everything called them away to adopt hostile views&#63; And yet&#44;
                such is the strength of our heaven&#8211;born sys&#8211; tem&#44; that few only
                entirely forsook it&#44; very few families only in this city&#44; and fewer yet in

                275 observances dear to our people stood&#44; together with parental
                instruction&#44; imperfect though it might be&#44; as the defence between apostasy
                and adherence&#59; and the true cause remained triumphant&#44; though sadly shorn of
                a strict conformity&#44; and though many minds were lukewarm in the pursuit of the
                truth&#44; and al&#8211; most ready to cast off the last link that bound them to us.
                There is no exaggeration in this sketch&#44; it is the simple truth&#44; mortifying
                though it may be&#59; and we cannot deny that several sought for religious in&#8211;
                formation from gentile&#8211;teachers&#44; failing to obtain the wholesome access to
                the true water of life among their own brethren. In this melancholy state were our
                people here and elsewhere only three years ago&#44; when&#44; as I observed&#44; our
                sisters&#44; worthy daughters of a worthy race&#44; aroused themselves to the noble
                effort to scatter profusely among all who might come a knowledge of the prin&#8211;
                ciples it behooves them to know&#44; and of the duties they are to accomplish in
                obedience to the will of our God. Many then came who&#44; though past the age of
                infancy&#44; had scarcely any knowledge of their faith and of the principles on
                which it is founded&#44; and several of them are this day among us&#44; not as
                scholars&#44; but as teachers&#44; in their turn to assist in blessing others with
                the light that has thus been permitted to dawn on them. Is not this alone a subject
                of felicitation&#63; does it not warm your hearts to look upon these immediate

                Israelites&#44; from the ages of four to six&#8211; teen years&#44; have at

                this necessary element of education&#59; and the exhibition which you have
                wit&#8211; nessed this day must have convinced you&#44; that the labour has not been
                bestowed in vain. Another gratifying fact which I wish you to notice is&#44; that to
                the best of my knowledge&#44; not one of the teachers and children has died&#44;
                from the commencement of the school up to this day&#44; which evidences a remarkable
                degree of health&#44; almost beyond precedent in other cases. Are we saying too much
                when we assert&#44; that this evidences that God has thus shown his approba&#8211;
                tion of the work &#63; I will admit&#44; that it savours more of presumption than
                meekness to look upon every success attending our daily conduct as an approval of
                Providence &#59; for wickedness might thus not rarely claim an attestation from on
                High &#59; but still we are warranted by Scripture to say&#44; that in things of
                mag&#8211; nitude we have the undoubted right to aver&#44; that the srreat Creator
                who watches over all the aflairs of man approves of our deeds&#44; when we see that
                life&#44; health and a moderate share of success attend on our under&#8211; takings.
                We are&#44; therefore&#44; in the present instances authorized in asserting that the
                enterprise is one truly meritorious&#44; and emineutly calculated to produce much
                good in the household of Israel &#59; and that im&#8211; perfect as it is yet&#44;
                it is the proper remedy which can be opposed to the advances of the gentiles to

                who say positive religion is not requisite for salvation. &#8212; For in this school
                the children are taught the unity of God &#59; how that the Creator&#44; from whom

                this unending One gave his law to his servant Moses&#44; and that this law is yet in
                our possession&#44; and must ever remain the rule of conduct of all descendants of
                Israel. &#8212; They are taught to know that God will reward the good&#44; if even
                un&#8211; seen by man &#59; and that the most secret sin will be sure to meet with
                due visitation. &#8212; They have it im&#8211; pressed on their mind&#44; that the
                present state of the moral world is not destined to remain unaltered&#44; that a
                time will come&#44; be this sooner or later&#44; when the Lord will raise up to

                his name One. &#8212; They are also told in the words of the Scrip&#8211; tures&#44;
                that the death of the body is not everlasting&#44; that with this life all our hopes

                have subverted&#44; as it did subvert&#44; the organiza&#8211; tion of our
                state&#59; but in the dispersion&#44; if even thou&#8211; sands forsake the law&#44;
                our existence is not endan&#8211; gered&#44; because the nation lives and thrives in
                the individual will&#44; in each meri&#59;ber of the house of Ja&#8211; cob. And
                these individuals will ever be on earth&#59; it is impossible to judge from history
                and analogy on one side&#44; and from scriptural promises on the other&#44; but that
                some will always be willing to bear testimony to the truth of Revelation &#59; and
                it is these few&#44; of even an humble and poor people&#44; on whom our hopes must
                be placed&#44; and who are ultimately to be that remnant whose mouth shall not utter
                deceit&#44; and whose hand shall be free from iniquity. And it is they who&#44; when
                asked to rely upon a mediator for salvation&#44; seeing that those who so believe
                are prosperous whilst our Jerusalem is desolate and our temple burnt with fire&#44;
                will say that&#44; when the time of our purification is past&#44; when the twofold
                wrath for all our sins has been all poured out&#44; the desolate places will be
                rebuilt&#44; and <pb n="280"/> 280 DANGERS AND REMEDY. the palace be reared again
                and rise unto everlasting from its ruins&#59; that again shall there be heard&#44;
                in the streets of&#34; Jerusalem which are now desolate&#44; the voice of the
                bridegroom and the bride&#44; and the aged shall yet lean there upon their
                staffs&#44; whilst youths and maidens are plajung in the exuberance of joy &#59; and
                all this shall be the work of regeneration&#44; when the spirit of God shall fill
                every heart&#44; when the love of the Lord shall be the true characteristic of every
                son of Israel. But the idea of a mediator will then be forgotten &#59; no one will
                then believe that the Lord could possibly be the implacable enemy to his own
                creation &#59; no one will then credit that the deity is di&#8211; vided against
                himself&#44; and that one part is filled with love whilst the other is urged by
                inexorable justice&#59; no one will then admit that salvation was purchased by a
                dying god&#44; shedding his blood for the sin of Adam &#59; but all then will
                believe that a law was given for our salvation&#59; that the Lord is merciful and of
                unending kindness&#59; that He forgives iniquity and will not destroy&#59; and that
                He is able and willing to save all those who seek his forgiveness and grace.
                Yes&#44; this is the knowledge which is to be univer&#8211; sal &#8212; to
                acknowledge God alone&#44; and to view Him alone as the Saviour&#44; the Ruler&#44;
                the Legislator of his creatures &#59; and this is the science&#44; to be prized
                above all other wisdom&#44; which it has been the endeavour of our beloved sisters
                to infuse into the minds of their charges&#44; to fit them to become Israelites in
                thoughts&#44; in deeds&#44; no less than they are in name by the in&#8211; heritance

                in truth that the Unseen One spoke audibly to any mortal man&#63;&#34; he will
                answer&#58; I observe the law because I do believe that the great Creator does truly
                care about my doings &#59; that He watches my con&#8211; duct&#44; and will reward
                the good I do and punish the evil&#59; and because I do sincerely put faith in the
                his&#8211; torically&#8211;established fact of the promulgation of the law in an
                audible manner by the unseen God &#59; for this fact is not merely one of
                record&#44; but it is likewise established by our daily experience &#59; since all
                the evil effects of disobedience to the statutes which are re&#8211; corded in its
                pages are daily fultilled before our eyes&#44; and consequently the Author of so
                much wisdom&#44; He who foretold so many things before they could have become
                matters of history&#44; must be far wiser than man&#44; consequently the Author of
                man himself. And as regards the objection that ceremonies are of neces&#8211; sity
                no matters of importance to the Deity&#44; the Israel&#8211; ite will answer&#44;
                that in themselves there is doubtless no service rendered to God by observing them
                &#59; but since it was of importance to the Lord&#44; for his own wise purposes&#44;
                to sanctify Israel to be to Him a priestly people&#44; to become ultimately the
                messengers of the truth to all other nations &#58; it was necessary to hedge round
                the people so chosen by observances and duties which should form around them a wall
                of de&#8211; fence and separation&#44; within which the divine truths should be
                safely preserved from being cast off amidst the mass of error prevailing all over
                the world. The ceremonies&#44; to use the ideas of the great Mendelssohn&#44;

                referring to the trntli.s which we had received&#44; and adverting back to
                historical tacts&#44; and unceasing&#93; j cause an explanation&#44; or rather
                living instruction&#44; to be given whenever the uninformed saw them practised&#44;
                that they might ask of those who already knew of God&#39;s power and wis&#8211; dom
                for light and instruction&#44; to be in themselves again enabled to hand these
                ceremonies and these explanations down to future ages. &#8212; &#34;We may say&#44;
                farther&#44; that mere ideas unconnected with acts might be forgotten in the lapse
                of time&#59; error might be preached&#44; backed by sophistry and a seltisli
                philoso&#8211; phy&#44; which would seek its greatest happiness in mere animal
                enjoyment&#59; but since our truths are bound up with actions&#44; the truths
                themselves cannot be forgot&#8211; ten whilst those acts are the daily practice of
                our peo&#8211; ple. &#8212; So&#44; for instance&#44; we are taught that whatever
                is&#44; happens&#44; and is through the agency of God alone. &#33;Now&#44; we have
                the ceremony of prayer&#44; we are taught that to ask what we need is acceptable
                service to God&#58; and see you not that the observance of this duty brings home to
                our feelings that there is One who is able to help&#63; that there is One who hears
                us&#44; who watches us&#44; who is nigh unto us in all our attlictions&#63; and that
                by obedience we may render ourselves worthy of his favour&#63; &#8212; And when the
                blessed Sabbath is ushered in&#44; when the newly&#8211;arranged household and the
                quiet rest proclaim that that day is holy to the Lord&#44; are we not reminded of

                with a mighty hand the Lord brought us forth from Egypt &#63; &#8212; and that it
                was then proved how weak is man when contending against God&#44; and that there
                exists no being but the One Supreme who can wound and heal&#44; who can cast down to
                the grave and bring again to life&#63; &#8212; The same may be said of every
                ceremonial action&#44; for all tend to the same great end&#44; to unite by outward
                acts the inward spirit to the truths which were handed down to us&#44; and to
                per&#8211; petuate the work of divine legislation which took place on Sinai&#44; by
                constituting all Israel living wit&#8211; nesses and living agents in the deeds they
                do as fol&#8211; lowers of that great law which we then received. These briefly&#44;
                namely&#44; the resistance to an amal&#8211; gamation with the erroneously believing
                gentile&#8211; world&#44; and the refusal to yield the law to the false reasoning of
                unbelievers&#44; are the fruits which we maj&#39;&#34; justly expect from the
                progress of instruction&#59; and the means presented by the school before us&#44; we
                have every reason to believe&#44; will go a great way towards scattering the light
                and guidance of which our youths stand so much in need. The earnestness with which
                the enterprise thus far has been encouraged by the liberal brethren in this
                city&#44; the eagerness with which parents have availed themselves of the
                opportunity to have their children taught&#44; and the cheering emu&#8211; lation of
                the example set here in other cities&#44; besides the general wish expressed in
                every town almost of this land where Israelites dwell&#44; to obtain a more
                ex&#8211; tended knowledge of the ways of life &#58; are all tokens that the spirit
                of the law is not extinct in Israel&#44; and that we have well&#8211;founded hopes
                that we are at last about to shake ofl&#34; the long sleep&#44; and to do
                some&#8211; <pb n="284"/> 284 DANGERS AND REMEDY. thing in earnest to redeem our
                name from the charge of slothfiihiess in religious matters. And indeed&#44; brethren
                and friends&#33; it is not enough that you send your children to be taught their
                duties theoretically &#59; but 3&#39;ou are bound to show them the practical
                appli&#8211; cation to life of whatever they may learn&#44; and to make lovely to
                them the doctrines which are held up to them for their guidance. In short&#44; your
                children should not learn one thing from their teachers&#44; and another from their
                parents and guardians &#59; the Sab&#8211; bath held up as a sign between God and
                Israel should not be profaned by those whom they love and should obey&#44; in
                obedience to the Decalogue&#59; they should not be asked to eat forbidden food at
                home&#44; which is told them here to be in contravention of the will of God. No&#44;
                beloved friends &#33; be consistent&#44; but be consistent in the path of
                righteousness&#59; teach your children whatever they should do&#44; and be careful
                that the practice coincide strictly with the precept. And since this school has done
                so much already to elicit the desire for information and to furnish the means for
                gratifying this newly awakened longing&#44; it is to be confidently expected&#44;
                that you will not let the means be wanting to carry out the beneficent design for
                many years to come. It is needless to dwell long on this point&#59; the benefits to
                be derived have been placed before you&#44; and&#44; Israelites as you are&#44; I am
                confident that the accustomed bounty will not be withheld this time&#44; and that
                there will not be any occasion to stint henceforward the amount of good which ought
                to be derived by all Jewish children of this place&#44; without distinction to
                station or wealth. But all should be made welcome by the ampleuess of <pb n="285"/>
                DANGERS AND REMEDY. 285 the endowment&#44; and all should receive the instruc&#8211;
                tion which was of old given alike to all children of Israel. Before concluding&#44;
                I again deem it my duty to call your attention to the necessity there exists of not
                contining education to one day in the week only. There is always more or less danger
                in an indiscrimi&#8211; nate intercourse with persons differing from us&#59; this is
                the case in riper years when the judgment has already become matured &#58; how much
                more must this then be in childhood&#44; or early youth&#44; before princi&#8211;
                ples are fixed and a sufficient fund of correct knowl&#8211; edge has been acquired.
                I therefore would urge upon your consideration the propriety&#44; I may say the
                neces&#8211; sity demanded by the wants of the times&#44; to estab&#8211; lish a
                general school under your own superintend&#8211; ence&#44; where all the elementary
                and higher branches of a good education can be obtained in connexion with a thorough
                knowledge of Jewish things&#44; history&#44; customs&#44; and ceremonies&#44; and a
                familiar acquaintance with the Hebrew language and Hterature. The large number of
                pupils before us proves that scholars would not be wanting for such a seminary of
                righteousness &#59; and the success of similar undertakings in other coun&#8211;
                tries admonishes us&#44; that all which is wanted is a united eflbrt and a pious
                reliance on the blessing of Providence. With these&#44; the enterprise cannot
                fail&#59; and the success hitherto attending the attempt in this city at diffusion
                of religious knowledge admonishes us&#44; in a language not to be misunderstood&#44;
                that we would not be doing our duty if this weighty matter should not speedily
                engage our attention and be car&#8211; ried into efiect. It is to be hoped&#44;
                therefore&#44; that <pb n="286"/> 286 DANGERS AND REMEDY. you&#44; my friends &#33;
                who glory in the name of Israel&#44; will hasten to forward the good work which has
                been commenced in this city and elsewhere&#59; and not rest till you see our own
                children guided by our own teachers&#44; and so taught that every branch of
                knowl&#8211; edge they acquire may tend to improve their morals&#44; and make them
                more willing servants of the Most High&#44; imbued with the true spirit of
                righteousness&#44; to be lirm and faithful to the law of the Lord&#44; all the days
                they live upon the earth &#33; And you&#44; beloved young friends&#33; upon whom in
                a measure hang the future hopes of Israel&#44; forget not the instruction which you
                have received&#44; and may yet receive after this&#44; in the doctrines of your
                religion. I3e careful to observe all the duties which are de&#8211; manded of
                you&#44; and think no act trifling and unim&#8211; portant which the law of God
                makes it the duty of every Israelite to observe. Be obedient to your pa&#8211;
                rents&#44; and do not grieve them by misconduct or the exhibition of bad passions.
                Be kind to one another&#44; and ever strive to obtain the good&#8211;will of all
                your fellow&#8211;men. But above all&#44; be Urm in maintaining the truth of the
                religion which you have learned from your parents&#59; do nothing to disgrace the
                name of Jew in the estimation of those who hold opinions differ&#8211; ent from
                ours&#59; and never listen to any one who would persuade you by any offer&#44; be it
                ever so tempting&#44; to forsake the religion of your fathers. If you act so
                always&#44; yon will earn for yourselves an enviable name&#44; and you will be
                beloved by men&#44; and have the con&#8211; soling satisfaction of having earned the

                parents&#59; and you will have the assurance&#44; that when your days are ended you
                will be received into im&#8211; mortal happiness by your God and Saviour&#44; as

                very truth&#44; we have discovered this consolation in all our many and long

                sprung from Thee&#63; Lost would our name have been&#44; swallowed up in the vortex
                of forgetfulness&#44; and we would have been irretrievably mingled with the nations

                thy son from Egypt&#44; and place in his mouth thy word and thy wisdom&#44; that he
                should go forth and be a light to many nations that walk in dark&#8211; ness&#44;
                that they at length might be impressed with the conviction that all the earth is

                it is but a small thing which has been attempted &#59; surrounded by dif&#8211;
                ficulties which try our constancy&#44; we have made a feeble essay to difluse the
                knowledge of thy word. But Thou&#44; O Lord&#33; art mighty to save&#59; it is not
                to the strong that victory belongeth&#44; nor doth the race appertain to the swift
                of foot. And thy word does teach us that Thou hast often granted assistance to the
                weak and feeble&#44; and in the days of tribulation Thou didst save Israel through
                the hands of a woman whose arm could not wield the sword nor hold the shield in the
                day of strife. Let us&#44; then&#44; invoke thy aid in the work in which we are
                engaged&#44; cause thy blessing to increase the humble seed which is planted amidst
                difficulties and dangers&#44; and let it grow till it shoot up in a mighty tree&#44;

                boughs. And let each child that receives instruction in this institution be enabled
                to see the beautiful wonders of thy statutes&#44; that its spirit may love to
                contemplate the path of the true faith&#44; and it be led all its life to urge daily

                Gentlemen &#33; I have been requested by the superintendent and teachers of the
                Sunday&#8211;school to lay before you briefly the merits and claims of the
                institution under their charge. This is the seventh anniversary since its
                foundation&#44; and ever since the day it was first opened to receive those in whom
                you have so much interest&#44; it has gone on dispensing light and knowledge to all
                who have sought its benefits. Rich and poor&#44; the na&#8211; tive and the
                foreigner&#44; and in one or two instances even the non&#8211;Israelite&#44; have
                alike been welcome here&#44; and the result before you shows that it has not been in
                vain that the teachers have laboured. It does not need my admonition to prove to you
                that it is your duty to bestow a religious education on your children&#44; or else
                there would not be so many here to&#8211;daj&#8211; to wit&#8211; ness the annual
                examination. I am sure that it must be a pleasing task to the teachers to give
                instruction&#44; and a much greater pleasure to the parents and friends of the
                pupils to bestow the means to enable the highly meritorious labourers in the cause
                to progress with <pb n="292"/> 292 PLANTING THE SEED. their work without thought or
                care about the ex&#8211; penses wMiich they must necessarily incur. Ever since the
                first commencement of the Sunday&#8211;school it has had nothing to rely upon but
                your kindness&#59; a fund&#44; no doubt&#44; could have been established which would
                have insured its permanency&#59; but it appears best after a seven&#8211;years
                experience&#44; that it was left in a measure unprotected&#44; and compelled to rely
                upon the kindness of those themselves interested for its sup&#8211; port. It has
                given you every year an eligible oppor&#8211; tunity to demonstrate that 3&#39;our
                wishes have been grat&#8211; ified in the progress of the children&#44; and that you
                ar3 in earnest in your desire to see it continue in active operation and flourish
                under your kind approbation. I am sure that I express nothing but the real feeling
                of the superintendent and teachers when I return in their name my heartfelt thanks
                for the benevolent in&#8211; dividuals who have so generously always aided them&#44;
                and to the members of the congregation for having supplied them with a proper
                school&#8211;room wherein to pursue weekly their exercises. Perhaps many among you
                may have expected a great deal more than you have witnessed this day&#59; no doubt
                yon think that the holy tongue of Israel ought not to be neglected&#44; and that it
                should be taught to the pupils of the Sunday&#8211;school. There can be no doubt
                that the realization of this idea would confer the greatest benefit on our young
                brothers and sisters&#44; and that it is a thing which ought to be accomplisiied.
                But&#44; permit me to say&#44; that one day&#39;s instruction in the week would
                hardly accomplish it&#44; and then we would And it extremely difficult to obtain

                taught to all Jewish children &#59; but it re&#8211; quires honest and
                God&#8211;fearing teachers specially quali&#8211; fied for the task&#44; and it is
                for you&#44; who are here this day&#44; to take care that&#44; if you have such
                among you&#44; their services shall be not left unsought for. It is not so difiicult
                as some imagine to acquire a proper de&#8211; gree of knowledge in the elementary
                steps of the holy language&#59; a little study and some instruction are all that is
                required&#59; and whilst instruction can be had from competent persons&#44; there is
                no reason why ig&#8211; norance in this important particular should be longer
                tolerated. The Sunday&#8211;school was commenced to give instruction in the dogmas
                and duties of religion&#59; this must be done in the vernacular language of the
                coun&#8211; try&#44; and this end it has admirably responded to&#44; of which the
                prompt answers of the scholars are an am&#8211; ple testimony. Not alone this has
                been accomplished&#44; but books&#44; the real means of instruction&#44; not before
                existing&#44; have been written expressly througli the en&#8211; couragement which
                this and other similar institutions have afforded&#59; and you&#44; who can
                recollect back no farther than fifteen years ago&#44; must acknowledge that a
                lamentable deficiency then existing has been in a great measure supplied. It becomes
                me not to speak of the share I had in this work &#59; but I may speak of the labours
                of others&#44; and herein then I will say&#44; that the Israelites&#44; who have
                contributed their share&#44; have proved themselves fully equal to the writers of
                other beliefs in this important particular. No doubt&#44; if these institutions are
                continued and they meet with proper appreciation&#44; but that they will give rise
                to many other manuals of instruction&#44; so that before 25&#42; <pb n="294"/> 294

                them instruc&#8211; tion. Even the Sunday&#8211;school itself has during the course
                of the year printed two little books which it employs&#44; and fully half the
                expense has been defrayed by distant congregations&#44; who also required them for
                the rearing of their children. You have thus a brief outline of what has been
                done&#44; and a view of what is yet to be achieved &#59; and let me assure you&#44;
                that by fostering this institution&#44; and by giving the proper bent to the mind of
                our youth&#44; you secure the best means of accomplishing a far greater good
                hereafter. Through &#34; concord small things grow&#44;&#34; whilst discord destroys
                great em&#8211; pires. Be thig then your aim&#44; that our small school shall
                ultimately expand into a real nursery of Ju&#8211; daism&#44; whence light and
                knowledge may be scattered abundantly abroad&#59; and be not disheartened at the
                smallness of the present results&#44; but look upon them as an earnest of better
                things to come. The impulse to a national Jewish education in America was given in
                this city&#44; by ladies belonging to this congregation. Let me then express the
                hope&#44; that you will long cherish so well conceived an undertaking&#44; and rely
                upon divine aid&#44; that your aspirations may not be disappointed&#44; and that the
                seed which you help to sow may before long produce an abundant harvest of
                righteousness and piety&#44; not alone in this city&#44; but over the leuirth and
                breadth of this land. And may the unbouglit grace of God&#44; that blessing above

                readily discover&#44; from the wording of our text&#44; that the religion of Israel
                was not to be the ex&#8211; clusive property of any one&#44; or of a class of the

                pilgrimage took place as usual&#44; not alone the men&#44; who were accustomed to

                who on other occasions were absent&#44; in order that he miorht read to them the

                scattered among the assembly&#44; who recited and expounded the same words which the

                public proclamation&#44; so to say&#44; of the renewed adherence of Israel every

                at their want of understanding of what had been read in their presence&#58; whereas

                extended education from those who were familiar with the his&#8211; tory and law of
                the land. Religious education among us has never been con&#8211; fined to
                classes&#59; and though no doubt the priests and Levites were the best educated in
                this branch among us&#44; there is no doubt on the other hand&#44; that they
                employed the leisure left them when they were not required at the temple&#44; which
                was indeed but a trifle more than two weeks in every year&#44; to be the teachers of
                the people.&#42; All Israel were to be taught&#44; as all had an equal share in
                their religion. But in modern times the study of religion has fallen sadly into

                knowledge is professedly so highly prized&#44; that no time is left for an
                acquisition which is to direct our course of life. The consequence of this is the
                state of irreligion in which so many of our people are now found&#44; not so much
                from any hostility to the faith&#44; as from their ignorance of its doctrines and
                details. You have done well&#44; therefore&#44; ladies of Baltimore&#44; to unite

                state in&#8211; Lcidict secular lahour&#44; and when the other schools are
                closed&#44; to teach in this school&#44; which you have just founded&#44; the
                principles and practices of Judaism. I need not say that we do not attach any
                sanctity to the first day of the week&#44; nor that the words Sunday&#8211; school
                are synonymous with Sabbath&#8211;school&#44; as some of our neighbours might be led
                to suppose&#44; because we teach a religious school on Sunday&#59; for it is only
                selected as being a leisure day&#44; comparatively speak&#8211; ing&#44; with both
                teachers and children&#44; more than any other day of the week&#44; and therefore
                best suited for the purpose you have in view. In teaching&#44; however&#44;
                ladies&#44; you must understand well that all sects around us found their religion
                no less than we do on the holy Scriptures&#44; and they rely on its text for a
                support of their views&#44; however they dili&#39;er from those which are
                characteristic of the Jewish religion. Yes&#44; all be&#8211; lievers in revealed
                religion regard the Bible as the foundation of their faith. If&#44; therefore&#44;

                also a Catholic work&#44; made for the use of this sect&#44; omitting the Scp&#8211;
                tuagiiit&#44; or whatever other versions there may be&#44; &#8212; they Avould be
                utterly unable to know what their du&#8211; ties are&#44; bewildered as they would
                necessarily be by the diversity of explanations engrafted&#44; often arbitra&#8211;
                rily&#44; on the word of God. But they require with the reading of the Bible a
                Jewish exposition of the same&#44; that they may readily detect therein the
                principles which are peculiarly theirs&#44; and to defend them by means of the
                deductions and reasonings handed down to them by their forefathers. The main
                principles of our faith&#44; or that we should believe as Jews&#44; are comprised in
                what is commonly called the Maimonidean creed. I will not stop to inquire whether or
                not our second Moses was really the author&#44; or compiler rather&#44; of our
                credo&#44; as many assert&#44; or not&#44; as others maintain&#59; for it matters
                not to whom we are indebted for this short comprehen&#8211; sive view of
                Judaism&#44; as its truth is indisputable&#44; and every separate article could be
                proved from Scripture&#44; if time permitted me to&#8211;day to enter on the
                discussion. Let us&#44; however&#44; briefly recite the principles which are thus
                held up to our adoption. The first is the exist&#8211; ence of God&#44; who alone
                created and governs all that has been made. The second is&#44; that the Creator is
                one and alone&#44; our God&#44; who was&#44; is&#44; and will be. The third is&#44;
                that the Creator is not corporeal&#44; and not subject to any bodilj&#39;
                infirmity&#44; and cannot be rep&#8211; resented by any form. The fourth is&#44;
                that He is the first and the last. The fifth is&#44; that He is alone worthy to be
                praj&#39;cd to&#44; but that we cannot address our prayers to any one beside Him.
                The sixth is&#44; <pb n="303"/> INSTRUCTION FOR ALL. 303 that all the words of the
                prophets are true. The sev&#8211; enth is&#44; that the prophecy of Moses is the
                standard of the truth&#44; and that he was the greatest of all the prophets that
                have preceded him&#44; and will come after him. The eighth is&#44; that the Law now
                in our posses&#8211; sion is the same that was given to our teacher Moses. The ninth
                is&#44; that this Law will not he exchanged&#44; nor will there be any other law
                from the blessed Crea&#8211; tor. The tenth is&#44; that God knows all the deeds and
                thoughts of the sons of man. The eleventh is&#44; that God will reward those who
                keep his commandments&#44; and punish those who transgress them. The twelfth is&#44;
                that there will be a redeemer or Messiah sent by God&#44; to accomplish what has
                been proinised by the prophets. The thirteenth is&#44; that we believe in the
                resurrection of the dead at the time it may be the will of the Creator to open the
                graves to everlasting life. This is a brief view of what according to our
                cele&#8211; brated Mainiuni is the creed of Israel&#44; and I may leave it to
                you&#44; in passing&#44; to decide on the justice of some of our modern
                teachers&#44; who claim him as being a reformer of their own kind&#44; or in other
                words&#44; a de&#8211; nier of the truth of prophecy. But to leave this point as
                hardly belonging to our theme of to&#8211;day&#44; I must however call your
                attention to the evident fact&#44; how utterly subversive the features of our creed
                are of all dogmas and beliefs held by other persuasions&#44; although they profess
                to be based on the revelation of God. Still if we are properly instructed&#44; we
                shall readily acknowledge that this&#44; the religion of Israel&#44; is true&#44;
                and is confirmed by the course of history&#44; in which it has played so conspicuous
                a part&#44; and that its princi&#8211; ples are based pre&#8211;eminently on common

                believing&#44; since they require not the assumption of any mystery which our reason
                must reject or accept in blind faith &#59; and what is more yet&#44; that if we
                allow these principles to guide us in our conduct&#44; they will conduce to our
                happiness in the highest possible manner. Nevertheless we see so much ignorance&#44;
                so much indifference prevailing among us&#44; whereas other per&#8211; suasions&#44;
                which we justly deem to be in error&#44; use so many and powerful efforts to spread
                their doctrines by means of missions&#44; book&#44; tract&#44; education&#44;
                Bible&#44; publication&#44; and other societies&#44; while their churches are
                crowded to suffocation&#44; and a spirit of emulation pervades them all&#44; as to
                which shall contribute the most for religious purposes&#44; and as to which is to
                at&#8211; tract the largest crowd of converts. At the same time we&#44; who have the
                undeliled truth in our hands&#44; do so little to propagate it even among
                ourselves&#44; not to speak of offering it to others. It is owing to this
                circumstance&#44; already many 3&#8211;ears in operation all over this country&#44;
                that so many families who had been left uninstructed&#44; have by degrees forsaken
                the household of Israel&#44; and been silently mixed up and imperceptibly lost amid
                other sects. Arouse your&#8211; selves&#44; therefore&#44; you ladies who have

                our principles and peculiar tenets&#44; such as the Unity of God and the permanence

                world&#44; and remain still faithful as the followers of the God of Israel. And
                should you discover that your own knowledge is not yet sufficient to enable you to
                accomplish this sacred obligation&#44; then apply yourselves to a close study of our
                religion&#44; and seek likewise the counsel and aid of those who have acquired a
                just reputation as the &#34; elders who may tell you what is the true way.&#34; I
                must call your attention also to the necessity of not learning our religion alone
                from books composed in the vernacular&#44; no matter who their authors may be&#44;
                though this may be a good thing for a commence&#8211; ment. You ought to devise the
                means&#44; by which all should be able to obtain so good a knowledge of the Hebrew
                language&#44; that they may be at least able to read the Scriptures in the
                original&#44; and not need to depend on any version&#44; whether King James&#39;s or
                any other&#44; to know what God has taught us all as his will. With the Hebrew text
                in our hands we can meet and overcome all the erroneous interpretations attempted to
                be engrafted on the word of God&#59; without it&#44; we are in danger of

                gentlemen belonging to that body resolved to present me a token of their regard
                consisting of various pieces of silver. The presentation took place on the 11th of
                March&#44; 5021&#44; when the ad&#8211; dross of the committee&#44; as given
                above&#44; was delivered by Mr. Hart&#44; president of the congregation&#44; to

                of the late Solomon Solis&#44; between whom and myself a friendship of many
                years&#39; con&#8211; tinuance prevailed. Perhaps&#44; I should have omitted this
                and the two next papers out of this collection&#44; as they are apparently
                self&#8211; laudatory &#59; but my readers will see that I have avoided&#44; on my

                altogether unworthy of preservation. The addresses of the committees are in smaller

                their high appreciation of the zeal and devotion displayed by you in the cause of
                Judaism in America. As the pioneer of Jewish literature in this country&#44; the
                self&#8211;imposed task of manifesting the ennobling prin&#8211; ciples which our
                holy faith inculcates&#44; and of Avhich the following of its precepts cannot fail
                to engender&#44; your task has been one which could derive its support only in the
                firm conviction&#44; that in the endeavour to elevate the standard of moral
                excellence you were but fulfilling to the utmost of your power your duty towards
                God&#44; and pursuing that course which was best calculated to render your brethren
                worthy of his mercies. &#39;Tis true&#44; the field before you was an ample one. And
                that in this proud and happy land civil and religious lib&#8211; erty dwell together
                in peace and unity. Here were no obstacles placed in the way of our intellectual
                advance&#8211; ment. We might approach the fountain of wisdom&#44; and quaff of its
                delicious waters to our heart&#39;s content. But there was a danger to this new
                delight. The maxims of a worldly philosophy were mixed in the crystal draught &#59;
                and in imbibing them&#44; a distaste was created within us for some of the
                ordinances of that revered faith which God had revealed&#44; and time has
                sanctified. &#39;Tis true&#44; our religion did not demand of us a crusade against
                those who diff&#39;cred from us in faith and worship &#8212; on the contrary&#44; it
                commanded us to love our neighbour as ourselves&#44; and whilst repelling the
                attacks of those who would sap the foundation of our religious edifice&#44; it
                im&#8211; pelled upon us the duty of showing our own strength&#44; not the weakness
                of our adversaries&#59; and although it pointed out the race of Israel as the chosen
                ones of God&#44; it also made known that all mankind were his children. When but
                entering on the confines of manhood&#44; you <pb n="308"/> 308 A RETROSPECT. ushered
                into existence your work of &#34; The Jews and the Mosaic Law&#44;&#34; both America

                have benefitted by your ministry and instruction for the last twenty&#8211;one

                re&#8211; deemed. Your published works&#44; and the discourses to which Ave have had
                the gratification of listening&#44; whilst they have warned us of the danger of
                innovations&#44; and demanded of us a firm support and adherence to the Law of
                Sinai&#44; have never been imbued with that spirit of big&#8211; otry which views
                every discrepancy of opinion between others and one&#39;s&#8211;self as worthy of
                proscription. You have justly considered that a subject&#44; which would not admit
                of a free discussion&#44; deserves our suspicion&#44; and not our support. That the
                cultivation of the understanding&#44; whilst the heart is neglected&#44; would never
                bring to ma&#8211; turity the fruit of morality&#44; and that did we wish our people
                to occupy once more their proud position among the nations of the earth&#44; virtue
                must place the laurel on the brow of wisdom&#44; and the love of God and duty
                to&#8211; wards mankind bo our aim and end. In the age wherein we live&#44; few
                there arc who possess sufficient strength of character and energy of purpose&#44; to
                turn aside from the struggle after wealth and power&#44; to devote themselves to the
                cause of truth &#59; lor mankind delight the most in those undertakings whose fruit
                they can see bloom and mature. But whilst earthly grandeur is fleeting&#44; the
                knowledge of having laboured for the moral and intellectual advancement of our
                foUow&#8211;lieings&#44; must be a source of joy over which time has no power&#59;

                Chairman and Gentlemen of the Committee&#33; It is a trite observation with many
                persons who&#44; like me&#44; have become recipients of a public demon&#8211;
                stration of regard and afiection&#44; on behalf of their friends and admirers&#44;
                that the compliment was both unexpected and undeserved by them. The world is just in
                regarding all such disclaimers as a mere shal&#8211; low pretext&#44; to hide
                emotions of inward pride that at length an otherwise ungrateful public has duly
                ap&#8211; preciated their merit&#44; and acknowledged the services they had rendered
                to their species. JSTevertheless&#44; I trust you will do me the justice to believe
                me&#44; that though the reception of the beautiful present you have just tendered me
                was not altogether unexpected&#44; from the known attachment of you&#44; my
                friends&#44; it was not needed to reward me for the services&#44; what&#8211; ever
                they be&#44; which I have been permitted to render to the cause of our faith and
                people&#44; which is the cause of all mankind. Nay&#44; the very aftecting
                man&#8211; ner in which you have worded your presentation&#8211; address outweighs
                the value of your gift&#59; and I shall <pb n="310"/> 310 A RETROSPECT. never forget
                the words you have employed&#44; should even the time ever come when the present
                itself might lose its intrinsic worth. In all my public career I have not laboured
                for gain&#44; if I am at all a judge of my feelings&#44; and I trust I do not
                deceive myself&#44; conscious as I am that we are all too apt to overrate the purity
                of our own intentions&#44; and to un&#8211; dervalue that of others&#59; and hence I
                required not&#44; at the close of my ministry among you&#44; to receive a gift so
                valuable as a recompense of my services. You have been pleased to allude to my
                literary labours&#44; both as a writer and preacher&#44; and to the value you place
                on them. I assure you&#44; however&#44; gentlemen&#44; that in thus incidentally
                serving our peo&#8211; ple&#44; I also laboured in my own behalf&#44; and this I
                ex&#8211; pressed some months ago in a social assembly&#44; at the southern capital
                of the Union&#44; when allusion was made by a fellow&#8211;hibourer to my services
                in&#8211; the cause of Judaism. Believe me&#44; that from early youth a vague image
                of literary activity floated before my mind&#44; and however I pictured to myself
                the pleasant&#8211; ness of the task to labour in the field of Jewish liter&#8211;
                ature&#44; I had almost lost sight of all these aspirations&#44; when circumstances
                had induced me to look to the pursuit of commerce as the employment of my life. But
                it is now rather more than twenty&#8211;two years ago&#44; when a vile slander
                against the fair fame of our race and our religion&#44; first propagated on the
                other side of the Atlantic&#44; forced me to enter the lists as the champion of our
                cause. It is true&#44; I was unknown and very young&#59; there were abler&#44;
                older&#44; and more experienced men&#44; who could doubtless have done battle for
                the good cause&#44; if not better&#44; at least fully <pb n="311"/> A RETROSPECT.
                3ll as well as myself&#59; but my own honour and my own faith were assaulted no less
                than the dearest rights of my fellow&#8211;Israelites. Could I then stand idle&#44;
                whilst I felt the power to strike&#44; without dishonour&#63; Could I remain
                silent&#44; whilst I had the consciousness of being able to overthrow the calumny
                &#63; No&#44; I could not&#59; and I wrote my defence of ourselves be&#8211; cause I
                could not help myself&#44; and hence became unconsciously a champion for a
                cause&#44; when I only meant to maintain the purity of my own character among
                others. To this simple circumstance is owing the development of my subsequent life
                &#59; the vague image took a shape and form&#44; and by degrees was composed&#44; on
                detached sheets of paper&#44; my first work&#44; &#34;The Jews and the Mosaic
                Law&#44;&#34; written after the toils of the day were over&#44; in the quiet hours
                of the night&#44; when slumber rested on the eyelids of most of my other townsmen.
                It is the simple truth&#44; that I had not the remotest idea of writing a book&#59;
                and I almost felt ashamed to acknowledge the fact to my intimate friends&#44; when
                it became known that I had composed a volume of moderate dimensions. The kind and
                indulgent judgment of the friends of Israel&#44; which is also exemplified in your
                Address&#44; has since almost convinced me that my fears and hesitation were
                needless&#58; still I feel too deeply that that per&#8211; formance&#44; like my
                later productions&#44; leaves me far short of the point of excellence which I would
                gladly have attained. I fear that I am trespassing on your patience&#44; and that I
                am becoming egotistical&#44; much as I would de&#8211; sire to avoid this fault. But
                you will still&#44; I trust&#44; pardon me&#44; for glancing at my course

                emi&#8211; nently acquired the love and respect of the people&#44; I was summoned
                from Virginia hither&#44; against my own conviction of the propriety of the step I
                was taking&#44; to assume the office of Hazan in a community where I was not only
                personally unknown&#44; but where I had also not a single relative even in a remote
                degree. It was indeed a fearful position for a young man&#44; inex&#8211; perienced
                in the ways of the world&#44; to find himself suddenly an object of marked
                attention&#44; and often of close scrutiny&#44; among those who bore to liim the
                relation of a flock to their pastor. My hands were weak&#59; the understanding of my
                duty perhaps not definite enough &#58; what wonder then that I should have failed at
                times&#44; not wilfully&#44; but accidental&#93;y&#44; in pursuing the exact course
                wliich could have secured me in the best manner the confidence and love of my
                constituents&#63; It is possible&#44; too&#44; that I have given offence to one&#44;
                to all of you&#44; by an unbecom&#8211; ing heat of temperament&#44; by not
                conciliating&#44; when this may have been possible&#44; by insisting on points when
                perhaps it would have been prudent and wise to yield. But&#44; I assure you&#44;
                that never did I wilfully ofiend the least among you &#59; never did I from malice
                excite to anger the humblest individual who sought me for aid and counsel. I do not
                claim to be better than my neighbours&#59; do not imagine tliiit I deem myself free
                from the faults of humanity&#59; still I trust that no one can say&#44; with
                justice&#44; that during a long <pb n="313"/> A RETROSPECT. 313 career of public
                services&#44; I have made myself obnox&#8211; ious to the charge of being unfaithful
                to my trust. But I need not say this little&#44; even&#44; in the presence of
                you&#44; gentlemen&#44; to&#8211;day&#59; since you have met here to bestow on me a
                testimonial of your appreciation of my character and services&#59; and it would
                therefore be out of place to enlarge on the topic. Permit me&#44; however&#44; to
                add&#44; that if I have unwittingly otfended you or any one absent from this
                assembly&#44; I hope to receive a forgiveness&#44; as from the bottom of my heart I
                am ready to forgive any injury 1 may have received. Excuse me for saying this&#44;
                for alluding to past griev&#8211; ances&#59; but it is true that my career has been
                beset with difficulties&#44; with dangers&#44; and that I have been judged at times
                with a harshness which ought not to have been exhibited towards one&#44; who&#44; if
                not other&#8211; wise entitled to indulgence&#44; had a claim&#44; because he came
                among you a stranger&#44; by your own invitation&#44; and suifering&#44; as he
                frequently did&#44; from severe at&#8211; tacks of ill health. It is time&#44;
                however&#44; that I close my remarks&#44; al&#8211; ready&#44; perhaps&#44; too
                long. You have spoken of my sermons&#59; and indeed&#44; if I have any merit&#44; it
                is to these that I may point. The chair of instruction among us had long been
                vacant&#44; when the summons was addressed to me to arise and teach the people. I
                need not tell you how gladly&#44; yet with how much fear&#44; I responded to the
                call. It is not in the spirit of boasting that this is said&#59; but it is a
                satisfaction to reliect&#44; that a course commenced with trembling&#44; gradually
                obtained the approbation of many judicious persons in several countries&#44; and

                pleasing duty&#44; and no one can appreciate the delight I have felt at observing
                the close attention indulgent audiences have given to my instruction&#44; not alone

                Kentucky&#44; early in December&#44; where the people pre&#8211; sented me a silver

                however&#44; that the congregation has since sought new counsels and new men. The

                Sir&#44; it is presented to you as a small token of the high respect we entertain
                towards one whose best years have been spent in the unswerving&#44; unwavering&#44;

                ate me for this service&#44; as I conceive it to be the duty of every one&#44; who
                has the capacity&#44; to teach&#44; on all oc&#8211; casions when he may be

                Nevertheless&#44; I accept your gift with gratitude&#44; not&#44; as you have well
                said&#44; Mr. President&#44; for its intrinsic value as precious metal&#44; but as a
                token that Israelites sympathize with each other&#44; and that services rendered to
                our cause&#44; no matter where performed&#44; are received kindly&#44; and
                acknowledged everywhere by the rightly thinking. This thought shall urge me on to
                farther ex&#8211; ertions&#44; and I shall rely on the promise you have made me in
                behalf of those you represent&#44; that the congre&#8211; gation Adath Israel would
                support me in the works I may be engaged in at any time for the promotion of
                Judaism. I thank you all for this kind sentiment&#44; and it will cheer me in the
                hour of trial and labours&#44; that the good wishes and kind sympathy of your body
                are with me&#44; and this is reward enough in itself to recompense me for what I
                have done. For&#44; in serving the interests of our people&#44; I also served my own

                I at the same time vindicated my own right to the respect of those who differ from
                us in religious principles. Still it is a pleasing reflection&#44; that this

                MINISTRY. and for giving voice to this feeling&#44; accept my heartfelt thanks. Bat
                as I have acquired the greater portion of the in&#8211; fluence I have whilst acting
                as the minister of our faith&#44; permit me that I dilate a little upon the
                necessity of placing the officer who is to administer in the holy house of God on a
                footing of true respectability and usefulness. Much of the evil under which we
                labour is owing to the want of a proper ministry&#44; who can&#44;
                independently&#44; and fearless of temporal consequences&#44; reprove their flocks
                on all occasions when they behold anything deserving of animadversion and censure.
                But how can any one so situated reprove the evil he beholds around him&#44; when he
                casts a look on wife and children&#44; and reflects that by his imprudence he may
                render them breadlcss and homeless&#44; before an&#8211; other year comes round
                &#63; Do you expect&#44; can any one expect&#44; a man to discharge his full
                duty&#44; whilst the earthly happiness of those dear to him depends on his
                discretion&#44; his silence&#44; his yielding to the author&#8211; ities of the
                synagogues&#44; who are either by custom or law his superiors&#63; And still you
                require&#44; every con&#8211; gregation requires&#44; a man to be ready at all times
                to admonish fearlessly and boldly&#44; in the manner of the ancient prophets&#44; to
                spare no evil which he discovers&#44; to yield to no authority&#44; when it concerns
                the service of our Father in heaven. Let me&#44; therefore&#44; entreat you to
                render the situation of your minister one of independence&#44; by electing him for
                such a period that the fear from without may not rest on him&#44; that he may feel
                the full responsibility he incurs to God for the discharge of his duty&#44;
                faithfully as a man of Israel &#59; and do you denumd of him that he shall reprove
                you <pb n="319"/> SOME WORK OF THE MINISTRY. 319 mildly on all occasions&#44; and
                teach yon the way 3&#39;ou should go&#44; and see that the heavenly work suiter 110
                injury in his hands. In this manner alone can the connexion of minister and flock be
                one of mutual satisfaction to both&#44; and then will our ministers be able to
                discharge their duty&#44; and righteousness and the fear of God will abun&#8211;
                dantly increase in our midst. You have been pleased to allude to my literary
                works&#59; permit me&#44; therefore&#44; to say a few words concerning the
                enterprise&#44; for which I have come&#44;&#39; brethren&#44; to solicit your
                aid&#44; and in which I acknowl&#8211; edge with gratitude&#44; you have given me
                more sup&#8211; port in comparison with numbers&#44; than I have received elsewhere.
                I allude to the purposed new version of the Holy Scriptures. It has often struck me
                as very surprising&#44; that we have been so long satisfied with a translation which
                has sprung from men who&#44; in their ideas&#44; at least&#44; were hostile to our
                religion &#8212; if even otherwise they may have been friendly to Israelites
                themselves. It was to have been expected of such as these&#44; that they would carry
                into the Scriptures any peculiar views they might entertain as regards doc&#8211;
                trines and practice&#44; and this without any intention of being dishonest. But is
                this any reason for our adopt&#8211; ing such a version as our guide&#63; and&#44;
                it must be re&#8211; membered that&#44; to many of those who are unacquainted with
                the Hebrew&#44; the English Bible forms almost the only source of religious
                impressions. Time&#44; indeed&#44; was&#44; wlien our population was too small to
                support such an enterprise as I have laid before you&#59; but all this is changed
                &#59; and the numerous congregations now every&#44; where existing&#44; or springing

                effort to furnish a transcript of the Bible more in accordance with the original
                text. The task to execute this has been ren&#8211; dered much easier of late years.

                &#33; I regret that the pleasing duty assigned to me by this congregation has not
                been confided to some other mem&#8211; ber&#44; who might bave brought to the
                accomplishment of his task the treasures of learning and the power of elo&#8211;

                the lofty language of oratory. Could I catch one ray of that golden flood of
                light&#44; which your mind has so recently beamed upon us&#44; &#8212; did I possess
                your facility in pouring forth those &#34; breathing thoughts and burning
                words&#44;&#34; to which we have all listened with rapture and delight &#58; then
                might I be enabled to express to you in suitable terms the warm and enduring
                friend&#8211; ship of your brethren in Charleston. It is both profitable and
                pleasant to dwell upon the past&#44; and I trust that you will pardon me for
                reverting to circumstances over which nearly twenty&#8211;two years have passed. In
                the year 1831&#44;&#34;y a poor&#44; uneducated &#42; &#34;When on my return
                homeward&#44; during the journey noticed above&#44; the people of Charleston
                insisted on my accepting a present from them&#44; not deeming myself at liberty to
                decline &#59; for though I had refused money&#8211;compensation for the various
                addresses I had made them&#44; a simple token of respect was sometbing diflbrent.
                Mr. Nathaniel Levin&#44; at a meeting held at the synagogue&#44; February 17th&#44;
                5612&#44; made the remarks given above&#44; on the part of the people&#44; to which
                I replied extemporaneously&#44; nearly as printed here. I The speaker was&#44; in
                this remark&#44; somewhat in error. Mr. L. arrived in this country in 1824. He left

                toiling in the rugged path of mercantile life&#44; and earning a scanty subsistence
                by the sweat of his brow. Not adapted&#44; either by the peculiar character of his
                mind or temperament&#44; to this pursuit&#44; he devoted the few leisure moments
                snatched from labour to the culture of his mental faculties. While yet a tyro in
                learning and in science&#44; he was called&#44; by a large Jewish congregation&#44;
                from the counting&#8211;room to the sacred desk&#44; to minister ster&#44;
                answerini&#63; to the usual colleges in America&#44; to obey the sum&#8211; mons of
                the late Zalma Kehine&#44; of Eichmond&#44; Virginia&#44; his maternal uncle&#44;
                who desired to have a child of his deceased sister with him. Mr. L. finding no good
                opportunity to continue his studies in the capital of Virginia&#44; and&#44; after
                being at a private school for only ten weeks&#44; when the teacher left to study
                medicine in Philadelphia&#44; he resolved to learn business under his uncle&#39;s
                direction &#59; wherefore&#44; he entered definitively into his employ&#44; and
                continued with him in that capacity for nearly five years. Mr. L. had onco an
                opportunity&#44; before 1828&#44; to appear in the papers in defence of our religion
                &#59; but it was finally&#44; in 1829&#44; that he wrote several essays to rebut the
                calumnies&#44; which had been spread abroad through an English Ke&#8211; vicw
                against the character of the Jewish faith and people. These essays were the means of
                his being sent for&#44; to become Hazan of the congregation Mikv6 Israel&#44; of
                Philadeliihia&#44; in whicn capacity he officiated for upwards of twenty&#8211;one
                years. He has never been endowed with riches&#59; but his position in Eichmond
                was&#44; certainly&#44; one of entire independence&#44; and might have ultimately
                led to wealth and distinction&#44; had lie continued to pursue it with industry and
                prudence. But the acquisition of mere gain was not much to his taste&#44; and he was
                not unwilling at some time to exchange a mercan&#8211; tile life for other pursuits
                &#59; but he hesitated long before he could be induced to accept the invitation
                tendered to him from Philadelphia&#44; and only consented&#44; at length&#44; in
                obedience to the urgent advice of elderly gentlemen&#44; his uncle among others&#44;
                who insisted on liis doing so. As respects his education&#44; it was as carefully
                attended to&#44; and he had made as nnuh progress as can be expected of a youth of
                seventeen&#44; when he quitted school. He had to labour&#44; it is true&#44;
                persevcringly&#44; to accomplish what he has done&#59; but the foundation he owes to
                his many teachers&#44; both Jewish and Christian&#44; whose memory shall ever be
                sacred to him. <pb n="323"/> AN ANTICIPATION. 323 in a liigh&#44; holy&#44; and
                responsible situation. Though young in years&#44; by dint of severe application and
                untiring in&#8211; dustry&#44; ho soon made himself competent for all the duties of
                his sacred office. Not content with the mere minis&#8211; trations of our
                Ritual&#44; he infused new life and vigour into the torpid frame of his
                congregation&#44; by the introduction of prayers and addresses in the vernacular. A
                short time after his induction into office&#44; a vile and slanderous attack upon
                our religion and the character of our people&#44; called forth the latent talents of
                the youthful minister&#44; who stood forth the learned exponent of Israel&#39;s
                faith&#44; the fearless champion of Israel&#39;s wrongs. We next observe him
                advancing the cause of his religion&#44; by the introduction of schools for the
                instruction of Jewish youth&#44; and the publication of books adapted to the
                re&#8211; ligious&#44; moral&#44; and mental improvement of the young and old of our
                faith. The laborious task of arrano&#8211;inc. printing&#44; and publishing our form
                of prayers and the Pentateuch&#44; afterwards engaged the time and energies of his
                more mature years&#44; and have imposed upon the Jews of the United States a debt of
                gratitude which future generations will acknowledge. The next step in the
                development of Jewish literature&#44; by our learned friend&#44; was the
                establishment of a Jewish yeriodical &#40;the first in this country&#41;&#44; and

                philanthropy&#44; you have deemed it a duty of the highest and most solemn
                character&#44; to advance the religious and moral culture of Israel. You feel that a
                more important subject could not engross your time or tax your talents. You have
                truly called it &#34; a weighty and solemn responsibility.&#34; It is the
                high&#8211; est and holiest man can exercise &#59; for on its faithful dis&#8211;

                our eternal benefit&#44; which&#44; if preserved in our hearts&#44; will prove the
                surest guides to virtue and happiness. You have proved to us&#44; that in the Bible

                laws&#44; and morals. You have recommended it to us as the Book of infancy and the
                Book of age &#59; because in its divine pages may be found lessons of wisdom&#44;

                our frailties&#44; our hopes&#44; our prayers to God&#44; and our dependence on one

                duty&#44; and pleasure&#59; the sentiment that exalts&#44; the emotion that
                refines&#44; the resolution that gives strength to virtue&#44; and imparts firmness

                received injustice and hostility. You have merited the full measure of the regard
                and esteem of 3&#39;our brethren&#44; but have received in its stead vials of

                devotion to a cause as sacred as ours. I fear&#44; however&#44; that you
                over&#8211;estimate my services&#44; which I would be but too happy to believe had
                been so effectual in doing good&#44; as you&#44; Mr. Levin&#44; have represented
                them. All I can claim is an honesty of purpose&#44; in which I will yield to
                none&#44; to do all that was in my powder. Had my health&#44; indeed&#44; been
                good&#44; so that I could have de&#8211; voted all the energies of my mind to the
                pursuit of literature&#44; I might&#44; perhaps&#44; have achieved a degree of
                eminence to become truly useful&#59; but it pleased Heaven to afflict me frequently
                with dreadful attacks of sickness&#44; which have stamped on my frame and face&#44;
                I fear&#44; premature marks of age&#59; and I cannot dwell on the agonies&#44; which
                I have had to endure at these intervals&#44; without shuddering. Yet such as I
                am&#44; imperfectly educated and inferior to many&#44; whose health has enabled them
                to advance much farther&#44; it will ever be my pleasure&#44; no less than duty&#44;
                to devote myself to Israel&#39;s interests and Israel&#39;s cause. For it is no
                small thing for which we contend&#44; &#8212; it is the highest&#44; the holiest
                which can occupy man&#39;s thoughts&#59; it is the most sublime achievement of the
                intellect which engages our mind in the pursuit of our re&#8211; ligion&#44; which
                has stood so well the assaults of ages&#59; and hence every sou and daughter of
                Israel should&#44; of right&#44; contribute whatever they can to advance its
                knowledge and the observance of its precepts. It is possible that this is the last
                time that it will be my privilege to address an audience in this place &#59;

                is as a teacher in Israel that you have met to testify your attachment towards me.
                Let me entreat you all to be faithful to our faith&#44; in every walk and rehxtion
                of life&#44; and to omit nothing to honour our religion&#44; by word and deed&#44;
                and to induce others to follow in the path you are yourselves pursuing. Powerless
                must be the public teachers&#44; if they are not aided by the people themselves.

                they have heard the message&#44; they have been instructed &#58; why&#44; then&#44;
                should they not each en&#8211; deavour to carry farther the message of truth and
                salvation which they have received&#63; And let me ad&#8211; dress&#44; especially
                the ladies&#44; who are in a majority in our assembly to&#8211;day&#44; to use their
                holy intiuence to effect much good among those with whom they are connected by the

                worldly pursuits&#44; and takes not the time to attend to the concerns of his soul.
                But&#44; for all this&#44; he is not beyond the reach of holy intiuence&#44; and his

                you&#44; and let all who see you&#44; at once perceive by your deeds that you are
                faithful followers of the law of Israel. Yes&#44; let it be your endeavour to teach

                the same ancestral custom. But since then division has crept in among you&#44; and
                you present the spectacle of a Jewish community divided into 28&#42; <pb n="330"/>

                and the nltra&#8211;heterodox. All this should not be&#44; and is the result of
                false teaching. Men have arisen who have propounded to the people doctrines not in
                uni&#8211; son with our ancient system&#44; and have invented fan&#8211; cies of
                their own&#44; which thej cherish as something sacred. This has produced the natural
                results&#44; which have been predicted&#44; that disunion and heart&#8211;burning
                would spring from a course where the will of man was regarded superior to the
                doctrines of religion &#59; and you have experienced estrangement in families&#44;
                no less than division in religious sentiments&#44; and par&#8211; ties have arisen
                where formerly there were friend&#8211; ship and union. Are not the deplorable
                effects of erroneous teaching evident enough in all this&#63; Surely it is time that
                a reunion should take the place of the state of isolation now existing&#59; and
                you&#44; my hearers&#44; can do much towards elfecting this. The ladies&#44;
                es&#8211; pecially&#44; can be successfully active in this matter. Let them exhort
                each other to reunite the bonds which have been severed&#44; not in the spirit of
                fault&#8211; finding&#44; not with harsh words&#44; but by mild persuasion&#44; in
                meekness and forbearance &#59; and surely it must be discovered by all&#44; that in
                truth all have but one ob&#8211; ject&#44; one single aim&#44; the advancement of
                our common faith. And O &#33; what a happy day it will be for me&#44; should I

                one house de&#8211; voted to God&#44; and all worshipping again in the same
                manner&#44; acknowledging again the same faith as in former years. The evil effects
                of false teaching must have long since become apparent&#59; and I trust that a wise

                regards myself&#44; to reply to the remarks which you addressed me personally&#44; I
                can honestly assure you that I am deeply moved. For many years I have laboured hard
                and faithfully to discharge my duty&#44; in the office which was bestowed on me
                without my solicitation. My labours were also not unblessed&#59; and now I have been
                driven forth an exile from my home&#44; banished from the very congregation which I
                have built up&#44; under the aid of God. I will not trust myself to speak on the
                subject&#44; I cannot do it&#59; not one of you can feel the emotions which agitate
                me when I revert to the subject in my mind. I might say much&#44; but I cannot&#44;
                will not venture to do so. But let me tell you this&#44; that it is true that I set
                forth this winter&#44; to advance the interest of my publications&#44; by a personal
                intercourse with my fellow&#8211;Israelites throughout the land&#44; in which object
                I have also&#44; in a measure&#44; succeeded. J3ut I had another object also&#44; to
                appeal from the judgment of my late congregation to the verdict of the Israelites
                elsewhere &#59; and I am truly happy that it has been in my favour. Wher&#8211; ever
                I tarried any time&#44; I was requested to address the people&#44; and their
                undivided attention&#44; their kind reception of my remarks&#44; their friendly
                expression of sympathy&#44; have all tended to soothe my lacerated feelings&#44; and
                to convince me that I have not alto&#8211; gether laboured in vain&#44; and that
                mankind are not all unjust. Some such a thing was necessary&#44; to tran&#8211;
                quillize my mind&#44; to subdue my rebellious heart&#59; and hence I am thankful
                that I ventured abroad in the late severe winter&#44; and braved dangers inseparable

                ungrateful&#44; although I have cause to complain of those on whom I had the
                greatest chiims. You have alluded&#44; Mr. Levin&#44; to the tongue of calumny&#44;
                which has been busy with my character. I thank you&#44; with all my heart&#44; for
                your expression in regard to this&#44; that in your estimation&#44; and in the eyes
                of you all&#44; my friends&#44; I stand clear and un&#8211; spotted. And permit me
                to say&#44; that in so thinking&#44; you do me no more than justice&#59; for if I
                were un&#8211; worthy&#44; I would not now stand before you&#44; not now be the
                recipient of a token of your regard. I shall therefore receive this as a testimony
                that you believe me worthy of the calling of a teacher in Israel&#44; and one

                the name of the Lord. For this frequent attention&#44; accept my thanks&#44; and be
                assured that I shall with pleasure present myself before j&#39;ou again&#44; should
                I ever revisit your city. But&#44; in the mean&#8211; time&#44; let me recommend

                indulgence&#44; and do not condemn me&#44; should calumny ever dare to assail my
                reputation &#8212; should slander even charge me with one or the other wrong. It
                is&#44; alas&#33; the mis&#8211; fortune of all who hold the least station which
                places them in any prominence&#44; to be the mark for the shafts of slander. Were
                they as pure as an angel of mercy&#44; as spotless as the innocent new&#8211;born

                the sun will not escape detraction&#44; and the brighter tlie light&#44; the more
                will an evil tongue find something to blame&#44; something to which it can point the
                tinger of scorn. But slander is like the night&#8211;owl&#44; which 011I3&#39;
                ventures out from its concealment&#44; where it has spent the day&#44; after the sun
                has set&#44; when darkness covers&#44; with its dusky mantle&#44; the face of the
                earth. It is then that the night&#8211;bird goes forth to seek its prey&#44; to do
                its work of destruction of life&#44; under the protection of the gloom. Just so is
                slander&#59; in the presence of its victim&#44; it is all smiles and friendship&#59;
                but no sooner is his back turned&#44; no sooner has&#44; so to say&#44; his sun set
                by his absence&#44; than it pours forth its vile poison&#44; and fearlessly does the
                work of detraction&#44; because the slandered is not present to counteract it
                promptly in person. It is possible that this may happen to me also. I leave you&#44;
                therefore&#44; my friends&#44; to guard my reputa&#8211; tion&#44; in which you all
                have shown a deep interest by your friendly presence this day. Believe no evil of
                me&#44; of which you have no absolute certainty that it is true &#59; and if it be
                necessary for you to condemn me&#44; if the conviction be brought home to 3&#39;our
                mind that I have done wrong&#44; then let me entreat you to judge of me
                indulgently&#44; and to pronounce no judg&#8211; ment which is to banish me from
                3&#39;our good&#8211;will. There is only One pure&#44; only One free from all
                wrong&#44; and this is our Father in heaven &#59; but it is man&#39;s to err&#44; it
                is human to transgress&#59; the best have their faults&#44; the most virtuous need
                forgiveness. In a few brief hours I shall be afloat on the broad bosom of the
                deep&#44; on my return to my place of resi&#8211; dence. Think of me when far

                enveloped the summit of the holy Sinai&#44; on which Thou hadst descended to impart
                to a world unacquainted with thy ways of mercy a perfect knowledge of truth and

                worshipped&#44; and walked in the vain conceits of the erring heathens&#44; and the

                against his brothers&#44; and war be banished from the world. O shield us at our

                with our regrets&#44; and to entreat Thee&#44; O Father &#33; for the repose of his
                soul. May it be&#44; then&#44; thy will to look not to his transgres&#8211;
                sions&#44; but to his good deeds&#44; that these may outweigh all the evil effects
                of the others&#44; so that he may be ad&#8211; judged to thy forgiveness and
                mercy&#44; and be shielded under the shadow of thy wings from the power of
                destruction. Yea&#44; wash him clean by thy unbought grace&#44; and may the pangs of
                dissolution be accepted by Thee as an atonement for all his sins&#44; and cause them

                permitted to open my eyes to the beauties of thy creation&#44; and the hours of
                sleep have passed away&#44; and imparted to me new strength to stand in thy
                pres&#8211; ence. I feel that all I am&#44; I am through Thee&#44; and it is thy
                wondrous power which has ordered things so&#44; that the apparent death of sleep
                gives fresh vigour to the weary limbs&#44; and a renewed power to the ex&#8211;
                hausted spirit&#44; to toil&#44; and to labour&#44; and to enjoy. O let me be
                conscious of this during the hours of waking&#44; that I may not fill my soul with
                the impurity of sin&#44; and sink unawares into the pitfalls of iniquity. Stand by
                me&#44; O omnipresent Goodness&#33; to teach me to distrust my deceitful heart&#44;

                shall not be always prosperous&#44; and that occasionally the wicked should
                triumph&#44; while they dare to rebel against thy decree. It is in such moments of

                my own imagination&#44; far from the bounds set to us by the religion which Thou
                didst reveal to our fathers. Yes&#44; bless thy servant with thy spirit&#44; that

                and didst promise him that Thoil wouldst be the stay of his children in the

                wouldst redeem them at the fourth generation from the patriarch. And Thou hast
                fulfilled thy word&#59; and when their cry ascended to Thee from their oppression.
                Thou didst send thy messenger&#44; and by his intervention eftect the liberation of
                thy redeemed. &#8212; It also recalls to us the time when Thou didst appear again to
                the sage of Ur of the Chaldees&#44; then residing in the land of Canaan&#44; and
                make with him the covenant of circumcision&#44; that he and his descendants should

                though often sinning against thy precepts. It brings before our memory&#44;
                also&#44; the solemn mo&#8211; ment when the chosen teacher of thy people brought
                    <pb n="371"/> PRAYER XII. 371 them within the bonds of the third covenant&#44;
                when he was about to transfer the leader&#39;s staff to his trusty disciple&#44;
                when he bound them and our descendants for&#8211; ever to remain faithful to the law
                which had been proclaimed by thy voice from the summit of Sinai as the unalterable
                announcement of thy will to the chil&#8211; dren of the dust. This gracious promise

                ON EXODUS XVIII. BY DR. GOTTHOLT SALOMON&#44; LATE PREACHER AT THE TEMPLE AT
                HAMBURG. DELIVERED IN 5602. &#34; When Jethro&#44; the priest of Midian&#44;
                Moses&#39; father&#8211;in&#8211;law&#44; heard of all that God had done for
                Moses&#44; and for Israel his people&#44; and that the Lord had brought Israel out
                of Egypt&#58; then Jethro&#44; Moses&#39; father&#8211;in&#8211;law&#44; took
                Zipporah&#44; Moses&#39; wife&#44; after he had sent her back. And her two sons&#44;
                of which the name of the one was Ger&#8211; shom &#40;for he said&#44; I have been
                an alien in a strange land&#41; &#59; and the name of the other was Eliezer &#40;for
                the God of my father&#44; said he&#44; was my help&#44; and delivered me from the
                sword of Pharaoh&#41;. And Jethro&#44; Moses&#39; father&#8211;in&#8211;law&#44;
                came with his sons and his wife unto Moses&#44; into the wilderness&#44; where he
                encamped at the mount of God &#58; and he said unto Moses&#44; I thy
                father&#8211;in&#8211;law Jethro am come unto thee&#44; and thy wife&#44; and her
                two sons with her. And Moses went out to meet his father&#8211;in&#8211;law&#44; and
                did obeisance&#44; and kissed him &#58; and they asked each other of their welfare
                &#59; and they came into the tent. And Moses told his father&#8211;in&#8211;law all
                that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel&#39;s sake&#44;
                and all the travail that had come upon them by the way&#44; and how the Lord had
                delivered them. And Jethro rejoiced for all the good&#8211; ness which the Lord had
                done to Israel&#44; whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians. And
                Jethro said. Blessed be the Lord&#44; who hath delivered you out of the hand of the
                Egyptians&#44; and out of the hand of Pharaoh&#44; who hath delivered the people
                from under the hand of the Egyptians. Now I know that the &#40;376&#41; <pb n="376"

                dealt proudly&#44; He was above them. And Jethro&#44; Moses&#39;
                father&#8211;in&#8211;law&#44; took a burnt&#8211;offering and sacrifices for God
                &#59; and Aaron came&#44; and all the elders of Israel&#44; to eat bread with
                Moses&#39; father&#8211;in&#8211;law be&#8211; fore God. And it came to pass on the
                morrow&#44; that Moses sat to judge the people&#58; and the people stood by Moses
                from the morning unto the evening. And when Moses&#39; father&#8211;in&#8211;law saw
                all that he did to the people&#44; he said. What is this thing that thou doest to
                the people&#63; why sittest thou thyself alone&#44; and all the people stand by thee
                from morning unto even &#63; And Moses said unto his father&#8211; in&#8211;law&#44;
                Because the people come unto me to inquire of God &#58; when they have a matter&#44;
                they come unto me&#44; and I judge between one and another&#44; and I do make them
                know the statutes of God and his laws. And Moses&#39; father&#8211;in&#8211;law said
                unto him&#44; The thing that thou doest is not good. Thou wilt surely wear away&#44;
                both thou&#44; and this people that is with thee &#59; for this thing is too heavy
                for thee &#59; thou art not able to perform it by thyself alone. Hearken now unto my
                voice&#44; I will give thee counsel&#44; and God shall be with thee&#44; Be thou for
                the people to God&#8211;ward&#44; that thou mayest bring the causes unto God. And
                thou shalt teach them the ordinances and the laws&#44; and shalt show them the way
                wherein they must walk&#44; and the work that they must do. Moreover&#44; thou shalt
                provide out of all the people&#44; able men&#44; such as fear God&#44; men of
                truth&#44; hating covetous&#8211; ness &#59; and place such over them to be rulers
                of thousands&#44; and rulers of hundreds&#44; rulers of fifties&#44; and rulers of
                tens. And let them judge the people at all seasons &#59; and it shall be that every
                great matter they shall bring unto thee&#44; but every small matter they shall
                judge&#58; so shall it be easier for thyself&#44; and they shall bear the burden
                with thee. If thou shalt do this thing&#44; and God command thee so&#44; then shalt
                thou be able to endure&#44; and all this people will also go to their place in
                peace. So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father&#8211;in&#8211; law&#44; and
                did all that he had said. And Moses chose able men out of all Israel&#44; and made
                them heads over the people&#44; rulers of thou&#8211; sands&#44; rulers of
                hundreds&#44; rulers of fifties&#44; and rulers of tens. And they judged the people
                at all seasons &#59; the hard causes they brought unto Moses&#44; but every small
                matter they judged themselves. And Moses let his father&#8211;in&#8211;law

                your eye turns upon a friendly and less shrouded future &#58; then are these your
                remarkable festive hours&#44; such as Moses and Jethro experienced them &#59; they
                fill your eyes&#44; too&#44; with tears of joy&#44; and your hearts with pleasing
                sen&#8211; sations. Be they many or few&#44; frequently or spar&#8211; ingly
                scattered through our life&#44; they ought to guide us&#44; as Moses and Jethro were
                guided&#44; unto God and things divine. They ought to attune our hearts to return
                thanks to God. God sends them into the fa&#8211; tiguing&#44; exhausting
                every&#8211;day life&#44; that they maj&#34; shine therein like luminous points&#44;
                and that life may not become too uniform in scenery and colouring&#44; and be thus
                rendered a burden to ourselves. Joy&#44; however&#44; shall by its appearing not
                merely belong to the dust&#44; not alone to a fleeting enjoyment&#59; but it shall
                be a holy rejoicing&#44; a rejoicing in God&#44; through which the sensual man is
                spiritualized&#59; and the table becomes an altar&#44; the meal a sacrificial repast
                before God&#44; dtiVn &#39;&#58;sh as our text expresses it. Moreover we shall
                employ these hours&#44; like Moses and Jethro&#44; for open communication and the
                pouring forth of the heart. And whereas at such periods the heart feels deeper&#44;
                and the mind sees clearer&#44; and the powers of the soul and the sentiments are
                brightened and more elevated &#58; we shall also&#44; like Moses and Jethro&#44;
                apply and use the hours as they did&#44; for sage reflection and consultation on
                important affairs&#44; for instance&#44; how domestic life may be ennobled&#59; how
                the <pb n="380"/> 380 APPENDIX. education of the children can be improved &#59; how
                the affairs of the congregation may be placed on a better footing&#59; for then have
                these remarkable festive hours guided us to a higher elevation&#44; and made us
                better and wiser&#59; they have led us to God&#44; and we have been rendered more
                familiar with divine things. II. &#34; Live true to thy calling&#44; but so that
                thou mayest live long for its furtherance.&#34; Each of us knows that by the word
                &#34; calling &#34; is meant a fixed state of action&#44; in which we employ our
                powers for the benefit and use of human and civil society&#44; no less for the
                welfare of others than of the individual himself. But how we are to labour in our
                calling&#44; how we shall best employ our powers&#44; this is indicated to us in
                Scripture&#44; in the narrative of Moses and Jethro. Look upon Moses &#33; On
                yesterday he beholds again&#44; after a separation of many years&#44; after
                laborious ex&#8211; ertions&#44; his dear father&#44; his wife&#44; his children
                &#59; to&#8211;day already&#44; you find him in the midst of the business of his
                calling&#59; &#34;on the following day&#44;&#34; say the Scrip&#8211; tures&#44;
                &#34;he sat to judge the people.&#34; However full his spirit might be from the
                joyful meeting&#44; however loudly his heart might beat for the loved souls just
                restored to him&#44; it is fuller yet&#44; it beats louder yet for his calling. And
                how does Moses labour in his calling &#63; Un&#8211; interruptedly &#34; from
                morning till evening.&#34; The call&#8211; ing does not alone fill the whole
                heart&#44; but fills up also the whole time. He permits himself no empty <pb n="381"
                /> SPECIMENS OF GERMAN PREACHERS. 381 intervals from labour. Each hour is filled up
                with another duty&#59; perseveringly he pursues the labours of his calling&#44; he
                devotes to them his entire soul. This is one thing we have to learn. Whatever
                call&#8211; ing&#44; brethren&#44; we may have chosen&#44; as soon as we have made a
                selection&#44; and declared ourselves for the same&#44; it is obligatory on us to
                labour for it entirely&#44; and to live for it alone&#59; the sweetest
                pleasures&#44; the highest enjoyments&#44; must not seduce us to rob our calling of
                this or that hour&#44; or to condense the labours and duties incident thereto&#44;
                that is&#44; to abridge&#44; to lessen them &#59; because we ought to find the
                sweetest pleasures&#44; the highest enjoyment in our calling itself&#44; which is a
                direct command of God to man&#44; a daily worship&#44; just in the light as Moses
                viewed it. And if we reflect&#44; beloved brethren&#44; that a consid&#8211; erable
                portion of life must have passed away&#44; when we have fairly entered on our
                calling&#59; and if we re&#8211; flect farther how much time of our already so
                limited existence is moreover consumed by the necessary re&#8211; quirements for the
                sustaining of life&#44; which cannot remain unattended to&#59; and if we finally
                reflect how often sickness&#44; natural weakness&#44; the infirmities of old
                age&#44; prevent us from accomplishing the duties of our calling&#58; we shall
                surely&#44; unless our conscience is too much blunted&#44; not have the disposition
                to squan&#8211; der the time which is remaining to us after these con&#8211;
                siderable deductions&#59; but we shall deem it no more than right and reasonable to
                devote ourselves entirely to our calling&#44; in wherever God has placed us&#44; and
                wherever lie has assigned to us a sphere of actioii &#59; be this in the troubled

                &#8212; our calling should be to us the most important thing&#44; and as such we
                ought to devote to it our whole life. Nevertheless&#44; live in such a manner in the
                pursuit of your vocation that you may be able to live long for it&#59; and this we
                learn from Jethro. &#34; The thing thou doest is not good &#59; thou wilt surely
                wear away&#44; both thou and this people that is with thee &#59; for this thing is
                too heavy for thee&#44; thou art not able to per&#8211; form it by thyself
                alone&#59;&#34; thus spoke Jethro to Moses&#44; and you know the advice which he
                gave him&#44; which he closes with these words&#44; &#34; If thou wilt do this
                thing&#44; and God command it thee&#44; then wilt thou be able to endure&#44; and
                also all this people will go to their place in peace.&#34; For just as God has set a
                limit to our life and the duration of our days&#44; so also has He limited our
                powers&#59; and no one has ever yet transcended these limits with impunity. A short
                and eventful life is certainly preferable to a long and un&#8211; eventful one&#44;
                and the wise and pious eflects more in ten years&#44; nay&#44; more in one year&#44;
                and labours more blissfully&#44; than the fool and godless in a long series of
                years. Nevertheless&#44; a truly wise&#44; a truly pious man&#44; has never yet
                unduly strained his powers&#44; and purposely endeavoured to consume himself. If one
                knows how to economize with the energies of life wliich his time allows him&#44; he
                can to a surety do much in a few years&#44; nay&#44; effect great things&#44; and he
                will have no cause whatever to complain of the shortness of life. But we ought
                constantly to think of the words of Jethro&#44; iopa &#94;y nin oyrt S3 oai iD&#59;r

                their place in peace.&#34; Thou&#44; my hearer&#44; must live in such a manner in
                the pursuit of thy calling&#44; that thou mayest be able to endure&#44; that thou
                mayest not&#44; in contradiction to the will of God&#44; consume and exhaust thyself
                before the proper time the powers vouchsafed to thee&#44; that thou mayest not be

                Jethro &#59; according to the method and manner in which thou pursuest thy

                and labour more assiduously than thy powers will permit thee &#33; No&#44; in the
                pursuit of your calling you are bound to think especially of those for whom you
                live&#59; and&#44; guided by the hand of piety and wisdom&#44; live in such a
                manner&#44; that you may be able to live a long time for the benefit of your
                calling. III. &#34; Greatness and humility are always united in the truly wise.&#34;
                Jethro imparts his counsel to his son&#8211;in&#8211;law&#44; as to how he should
                live for himself and the people&#44; and Moses follows the advice. Moses&#44; the
                man of God&#44; the trusted by God&#44; the mediator between God and Israel
                &#40;Dent. v. 5&#41;&#44; the prophet&#44; the proclaimer of the one and only
                God&#44; accepts the advice imparted to him by a non&#8211;Israelite&#44; a
                heathenish priest. But for this very reason do our illustrious ancients apply to
                Moses the name of the wise&#44; and refer to him the proverb of Solomon&#44; ddh
                nyj&#39;&#94;&#94;&#39;niyi &#34;But the wise listeueth to advice.&#34; What
                humility &#33; and with what greatness is it united. Indeed&#44; I know not which is
                the mother&#44; which the daughter&#44; whether humility brings forth
                o&#59;reatncss&#44; or greatness humility &#59; but this much I do know&#44;
                that&#44; in order to possess and to exercise true humility&#44; one must be truly
                great&#44; &#8212; morally great &#59; since little souls know absolutely nothing of
                the ex&#8211; alted virtue of humility. <pb n="385"/> SPECIMENS OF GERMAN PREACHERS.
                385 Whoever possesses moral greatness thinks&#44; in the performance of important
                acts&#44; nowise on his own self&#44; does not in any manner feel disturbed whether
                perchance his own self might not be placed in the shade&#44; if but one voice&#44;
                but one merit be accorded to others. Therefore also does he consult with and listen
                to others. Whoever possesses moral greatness cares for the good cause which it
                behoves him to promote&#44; not for his own fame&#44; not for his own honour &#59;
                God&#39;s praise&#44; God&#39;s glory&#44; these are objects which he lays to heart.
                He therefore also asks and follows the counsel of those by whose means the praise
                and glory of God may be extended. &#34; If thou doest this&#44; and God command it
                thee&#44;&#34; were the words of Jethro. Whoever possesses moral greatness&#44; is
                sedulous for the truth&#44; not for appearance &#59; righteousness and the fear of
                God are to become more at home among man&#8211; kind&#59; through whom this takes
                place is of no im&#8211; portance&#44; provided only it does take place.
                There&#8211; fore does he call to his counsel the good and the noble&#8211;
                minded&#44; and he appreciates duly their advice&#59; there&#8211; fore was the
                noble&#8211;minded Moses so much moved by the words of Jethro&#44; &#34; Choose able
                men&#44; such as fear God&#44; men of truth&#44; hating covetousness&#59;&#34;
                because how much that is good and useful cannot men effect&#44; in whom all such
                exalted virtues are united &#33; Where&#44; however&#44; moral greatness is
                wanting&#44; there egotism will show itself openly&#44; an egotism which desiros
                only what is advantageous to one&#39;s self&#44; and seeks only one&#39;s own
                interest&#59; where moral greatness is absent&#44; there pride will puff itself into
                importance&#44; a pride which seems to understand every thing better VOL. X. 33 <pb

                wanting&#44; there the soul is full of ambition&#44; which longs ior
                high&#8211;sounding praise and flattery &#58; how could and would such a one share
                his incense and his laurels with another&#63; Every thing&#44; therefore&#44; is
                conducted according to his own will&#44; even if houses of God&#44; and schools&#44;
                and congregations should be ruined thereby &#33; Jethro is a heathenish priest&#44;
                and the greatest prophet in Israel follows his advice&#44; preserves the words as
                though they were gold and precious metal&#44; preserves them &#8212; in the holy
                Scriptures.&#42; This is a humility which belongs only to great souls. We may
                therefore assume that we have above all in our Pa&#8211; rashah&#8224; of
                to&#8211;day a measure of true greatness&#44; and we are certified that we are bound
                to listen to wisdom&#44; whether it come out of the mouth of the Israelite or
                non&#8211;Israelite. The truth belongs to God&#44; and who&#8211; ever teaches us
                the same&#44; even if he be a heathenish priest&#44; is a servant of the living God.

                the will of God than their own&#59; choose such as these&#44; for they work
                beneficially&#44; they devote their powers and capacities&#44; their days and
                years&#44; to their calling&#44; and desire no other acknowl&#8211; edgment than
                that of their own conscience&#44; and know of no other approbation than the
                approbation of God&#44; and their being pleasing in the eyes of God. IV. &#34;
                Coming and parting border very closely on one another.&#34; Only a short time had
                Moses been in the society of his father&#8211;in&#8211;law&#44; when fate&#44; which
                bid one go to the right&#44; the other to the left&#44; separated them anew.
                &#40;Exodus xviii. 27.&#41; Just so is it in our own life &#59; coming and parting
                border very closely upon one another. And it is not merely the all&#8211;separating
                death that steps in between the loving and the loved&#44; but innumerable
                circum&#8211; stances and duties demand in an imperious tone that those who have
                scarcely met and seen one another&#44; should soon separate again. But this
                arrangement also is derived from a higher Hand&#59; it is intended to eflect in part
                that our love for our friends should ever become more sincere and heartfelt. Let us
                endeavour to enjoy and to detain the hours &#8212; they are only hours &#8212; which
                we arc permitted to spend in the circle of love and friendship. Let us strive to
                enchain them&#44; I may say&#44; to perpetuate them&#44; by thinking&#44;
                working&#44; living&#44; while they last&#44; for one <pb n="388"/> 388 APPENDIX.
                another&#44; and then work and live thus that&#44; when we dismiss the object of our
                aiiection&#44; as Moses did Jethro&#44; and he returns to his land&#44; to his
                home&#44; or if we be the dismissed&#44; they who return&#44; no reproaches of any
                kind for neglected&#44; delayed duties&#44; may disturb the tranquillity of our
                soul. No &#33; we ought to be able to say unto ourselves at parting&#44; whilst
                bidding farewell &#58; &#34;We have completely tasted and enjoyed the short&#44; but
                eventful&#44; festive hours which Heaven had vouchsafed to us &#59; our being and
                living together were of a holy and divine nature&#44; and we have thereby been
                rendered happy and blessed. O how benefi&#8211; cently must the effect of this
                doctrine&#44; the truth that our coming and parting border so closely on each
                other&#44; act upon our narrow&#44; our narrowest circle &#33; What a blessing must
                the love of parents for their children&#44; and of children for their parents
                become&#44; if they mutually place it as manifest before their mind&#44; that they
                have received but fleeting hours for the ex&#8211; ercise of love. How must this
                thought spur on the parents to labour for the welfare of their children with the
                utmost solicitude&#44; and to establish it as firmly as possible&#59; for in this
                alone can genuine and true love be displayed. How must this thought stimulate the
                children&#44; even the giddy and the most unreflect&#8211; ing&#44; to sweeten the
                short pilgrimage of the guides of their life&#44; to become their pride and their
                joy. What a blessing will the thought that &#34; coming and parting border so
                closely on one another&#34; be&#44; if it admonishes brothers and relatives to live
                with and near each other&#44; not to live far apart and indifterent to each
                other&#39;s fate&#44; and to remove everything whicli may have placed enmity between
                them&#44; or what the <pb n="389"/> SPECIMENS OF GERMAN PREACHERS. 389 loveless
                world may have placed between them&#44; envy&#44; jealousy&#44; calumny&#44; or what
                othCr names the serpents may bear which are in the habit of forcing themselves into
                the paradise of love. O how greatly must the thought of coming and parting incite
                you all&#44; brothers and sisters&#44; to lay to heart the word of Scripture&#44;
                which is a word of the truest love &#58; &#34; How good and lovely is it when
                brethren dwell together in unity &#59; for there the Lord hath commanded the
                blessing&#44; life unto everlasting&#44;&#34; there will be understood what is life
                unto everlasting. And may such a blessing and such a happy life be your portion&#44;
                beloved brethren. May our to&#8211;day&#39;s lecture help to contribute to this
                result. It will&#44; it MUST happen&#44; if the festive hours in your life guide you
                unto God &#59; if you live wholly and fully in the pursuit of your calling in such a
                manner that you may be able to live long for the same &#59; if you walk humbly
                before God&#44; and&#44; as it accords with wisdom and true greatness&#44; you do
                not despise the counsel of tried souls &#59; if you finally take it to heart that
                coming and parting border very closely on one another&#59; and you employ&#44; for

                into the hearts of mankind. Yea&#44; the very idea is divine &#33; And what did the
                Lord desire&#63; To educate a great people to a knowledge of divine things&#44; to
                justice&#44; to religion. Therefore did He draw them forth out of the dark country
                of superstition and slavery&#44; to ren&#8211; der them free from the bonds of error
                and depend&#8211; ence&#44; as a child is drawn out of the dark domain of
                unconsciousness&#44; out of the region of sleepiness to the light of day and
                freedom. Therefore did He lead them forth into the wilderness&#44; that they might
                be alone&#44; separate during their time of instruction from a contact with the
                vicious&#44; sunken nations&#44; just as we shieldingly guard our children from the
                evils and vices of the world. He fed them there with a pecu&#8211; liar species of
                food&#44; as we do to our children as long as they arc infants. He led them through
                the wil&#8211; derness for forty years&#44; till they acquired the power to enter
                into an independent life&#44; just as we keep our children with us till they reach
                manhood&#39;s years&#59; in the wilderness He taught them doctrines and justice&#44;
                truth and virtue&#44; knowledge of divine things and piety&#44; just as we would
                gladly impress them upon our children&#44; and lay them&#44; if we could&#44; in
                their open heart. And after they had become grown up and strong. He caused them to
                enter the land of contest&#44; to become manly in the battles for their country&#44;
                and assisted them in the struggles for that land&#44; till they could live and act
                as an independent people. So also do we parents let our youth and maidens enter into

                following three questions&#58; How ought they to be educated &#63; For what end
                ought they to be educated &#63; In what spirit ought they to be educated &#63; And
                behold&#44; the truest aim of education is expressed by the prophet in the Haphtorah
                of to&#8211;day &#58; &#39; They went every one straight forward &#59; whither the
                spirit was to go&#44; they went&#44; and they turned not when they went.&#34;
                Ezekiel i. 12. L My friends &#33; how should education be conducted &#63; &#8212;
                nay&#44; is education at all requisite &#63; &#8212; If we take coun&#8211; sel of
                past experience&#44; the effect of education may at times appear very questionable.
                We behold children educated in the most excellent manner deviate from the road
                marked out to thera which they had already entered upon &#59; in other words&#44;
                that a good education produces bad fruits. We on the contrary behold children
                greatly neglected become excellent and dis&#8211; tinguished men &#59; or&#44; that
                a bad education produces good fruits. But this is not the way of considering the
                subject&#44; brethren. The prophet says &#58; &#34; Whither the spirit was to go
                they went&#44; and they turned not when they went.&#34; This is a word of deep
                import. The direction which a man has once received he never forsakes again&#44; or
                it never leaves him. Let us rather ask&#44; What would have become of the first

                which you can bestow upon your children than a good edu&#8211; cation &#33; The
                spirit of man in childhood is like wax&#44; which receives every impression&#44; but
                like iron retain&#8211; ing for after&#8211;life and forever fast all impressions it
                has received. But how should education be constituted in order to be good &#63; It
                must&#44; in the first instance&#44; be an education of carefulness&#44; of constant
                watching&#59; the parental eye must be continually awake over the child &#59; and if

                educate their children&#44; and they themselves must edu&#8211; cate them. For to a
                stranger&#39;s heart the child appeals but negligently&#59; the stranger labours for
                pay&#44; and he cannot confer on him what is the second requisite of a good
                education&#44; an education of love and affection. O &#33; how soft is the touch of
                the hand of the father or mother to the heart of the child&#44; how gratefully is
                the child penetrated by the exertions of the parents&#44; how readily do all the
                blossoms of the young soul open themselves under the loving rays of the paternal
                eyes&#44; to which it turns as the sunflower does to the day&#8211; star of our
                planet. Who protects the child from every rude blast &#63; The mother&#39;s love.
                Who guards the child against the worm that secretly gnaws at the root &#63; The
                father&#39;s love. But this love must at the same time be the true love &#59;
                education must therefore be thirdly &#8212; an education wherein mildness and
                sever&#8211; ity are united. Whoever in educating his child in&#8211; dulges him in
                everything&#44; and yields to his whims and caprices&#44; renders him effeminate and
                self&#8211;willed. Whoever educates his child with rigorous and love&#8211; less
                severity and coldness renders him unsociable and headstrong. Whoever makes a
                plaything of his child at one moment and then breaks out in fits of fury like a
                thunder&#8211;storm&#44; renders him uncertain and waver&#8211; ing. On the
                contrary&#44; love and severity must go hand in hand&#44; at the right time and
                according to a judicious plan&#59; out of the midst of mildness severity must ever
                be discernible&#44; and in severity the child should perceive the traits of
                mildness. The good ac&#8211; tions must be rewarded&#44; faults must be
                punished&#59; but the punishment must appear to the child as a nec&#8211; essary

                united with the mildness of the other&#44; that the educa&#8211; tion should neither
                be feminine nor morose. Finally&#44; and fourthly education should be an education
                of a good example. For a good example is the soul of education. There are&#44; ye
                parents&#44; no more attentive observers of 3&#39;our conduct than your
                children&#44; there are no severer judges&#44; but at the same time no more ready
                imitators than they Take especial care &#59; and if ye sin&#44; do not show it to
                the children &#59; if you com&#8211; mit an act of injustice&#44; let them not see
                it&#59; if disunion is between you&#44; let them not become aware of it. Only go
                before them with an example of mercj&#8211;&#44; and righteousness&#44; and
                piety&#44; and they will follow. For they go whither the spirit is directed to
                go&#44; and they depart not therefrom. And was not this the educa&#8211; tion which
                the Lord vouchsafed to Israel with so much care&#44; since the pillar of cloud did
                not depart during the day nor the pillar of fire by night&#44; &#8212; so

                therefore should we educate our children. But for what end&#63; in reference to what
                object shall we educate them&#63; what direction shall we give them that they may
                fol&#8211; low it&#63; When the Lord educated the people of Israel He gave them the
                divine code of justice and mercy&#44; and the law of sanctification. He first
                instructed Israel concerning their acts towards their fellow&#8211;men&#44; and then
                concerning their conduct towards the Lord. And thus is man given to two
                directions&#44; and has to build up for himself two worlds&#44; the one the existing
                human world&#44; the other the inward and higher world of the spirit. And for both
                must our children be educated. First for the earth. To whom is it more necessary
                that the growing generation should become a sterling class of men&#44; than Israel
                &#63; Scarcely as yet acknowledged&#44; scarcely yet somewhat tolerated&#44;&#42;
                and yet much restricted in society our children ought to be able to maintain an
                honourable position throuo&#8211;h the power of mind&#44; firmness&#44; worth&#44;

                en&#8211; larged field from our opponents. Yes&#33; a man who is laborious&#44;
                active&#44; productive among mankind is a glorious phenomenon. But how can education
                con&#8211; duce to this result&#63; When it is in the first place an education of
                order&#44; of the severest&#44; strictest order. Order is a divine attribute&#44;
                for only through means of it can God&#39;s world exist. Order stamps the char&#8211;
                &#42; The learned divine of course alludes to tho then situation of the Jews in

                acter of health and usefuhiess upon body and soul. Order is the foundation of
                temperance&#44; and conquers the passions. Cliildren must be accustomed from their
                earliest infancy to a careful order in time and space&#44; in their person and
                possessions &#59; and in this very point there is witnessed the most frequently a
                lamentable neglect. To form&#44; however&#44; a useful character there is
                necessary&#44; as a second requisite&#44; an education of perfection. From early
                infancy the child should be made to do nothing by halves&#44; but to do everything
                fully and completely. Whatever has been commenced ought to be finished&#44; he must
                not be permitted to remain standing still half&#8211;ways. Only in this manner can
                unskilfulness in any craft be avoided&#44; and thus only can one become master in
                any pursuit&#44; whatever it may be. Let the boy choose&#44; or be compelled to
                choose&#44; whatever branch it may be&#59; but let it be his endeavour to perfect
                himself therein and become master thereof as of his proper province. And
                thirdly&#44; education must be also one of earnest&#8211; ness. Away with every
                frivolity&#44; with every species of trifling in education&#44; &#8212; an education
                which cannot initiate and force the child too early into the vanities of the
                world&#44; there where light enjoyments and dan&#8211; cing play the first part of
                life &#33; Away with that efteminacy of education which would prepare for the child
                nothing but a succession of pleasures&#44; as though he entered the circle of the
                human fiimily for no other purpose&#59; an education which cannot make the child
                acquainted at too early an age with all the en&#8211; joyments of life&#44; and
                which calls forth nothing but degeneracy and the desire to enjoy. The child should
                be early taught by experience&#44; that life is something <pb n="399"/> SPECIMENS OF
                GERMAN PREACHERS. 399 earnest and difficult&#59; he must early learn how to govern
                himself&#44; how to dispense with many things&#44; how to conquer his desires. Leave
                to himself the task of pursuing his plays and amusements&#59; for he is a child&#44;
                and understands these matters better than you&#44; and will be most pleased with
                things of his own invention. Finally&#44; and fourthly&#44; education should be one
                of relinement and nobleness of mind&#59; for in every situation one can be refined
                and noble&#8211;minded&#44; and thus ennoble himself and be a joy to others. But not
                in mere bowing and in graceful words con&#8211; sists the refinement and nobleness
                recommended to you&#44; but in disposition and behaviour&#44; in demeanour and
                conduct. This therefore renders man what he should be&#44; and ripe for intercourse
                with mankind at large &#58; &#8212; when he observes order and perfection&#44;
                earn&#8211; estness and refinement. But is this enough&#63; No&#44; farther yet does
                the province of education extend itself before our view&#58; it should rear man also
                for the inner&#44; the spiritual world. In the first place the mind should be
                awakened to a free&#44; living activity &#59; superstition &#124; and terror should
                be avoided&#44; that the spiritual eye may be en&#8211; abled to survey everything
                with a clear vision&#44; that man &#8211;may demand an account and obtain the reason
                of all that takes place. Next&#44; however&#44; the feelings of the child must be

                APPENDIX. that the child may betimes be made aware of the judge inherent in hia own
                heart&#44; to listen to his voice&#44; to attend to his reproof and his
                approbation&#44; and to mark his warning and his inciting. In this manner ought you
                to habituate your children betimes&#44; not merely to live uithout&#44; but also to
                live witliin them&#8211; selves&#44; and to yield themselves to a contemplation of
                their inward man. Only through an equal cultiva&#8211; tion of the mind&#44; the
                feelings&#44; and conscience&#44; does man in reality become an entire man&#44; who
                governs himself and the world&#44; who is a king in his own kingdom. And if you have
                succeeded in this through your mode of education&#44; then will your children
                fol&#8211; low in this direction&#44; not depart therefrom&#44; but pursue their
                onward course. III. Yes&#44; education&#44; beloved friends&#44; is a difficult&#44;
                a great work&#44; and nevertheless I have not yet led you to its highest
                pinnacle&#44; &#8212; to religion&#44; to religious education. But if you were to
                ask me for the third requisition&#44; &#34;In what spirit shall our children be
                educated&#63;&#34; what else could I answer you&#44; except in the spirit of the
                Israelitish religion&#44; in Israelitish piety&#63; Religion must be the basis of
                education&#44; or else it is valueless and a useless fragment. Kcligion must be the
                spir&#8211; itual influence which covers&#44; the spiritual bond which unites the
                whole system of education&#44; or else the whole will one day fall to pieces and
                vanish into noth&#8211; ing. For&#44; since in religion alone all the virtues&#44;
                what&#8211; ever is beautiful and immortal&#44; have their root&#44; how could these
                be transplanted into the soul of youth <pb n="401"/> SPECIMENS OF GERMAN PREACHERS.
                401 without religion &#63; And if Israel has been educated by God himself to be a
                people of religion&#44; as the bearer of religion&#44; of religious knowledge&#44;
                how could our youth solve this problem&#44; this divine task&#44; with&#8211; out
                the aid of religion &#63; But in truth&#44; in nothing is our age so
                vacillating&#44; so careless&#44; so uncertain&#44; as precisely in religious
                education. Most parents are only careful that their children be instructed in the
                arts and sciences of the world&#44; but religious knowl&#8211; edge they postpone to
                the last. The frequenting of the school where religion is taught is a burden to the
                parents&#44; which they put away as far as possible&#44; and then abridge it as soon
                as possible. How often do I hear children say in the name of their parents&#44;
                &#34; I have too many things to learn for my general school&#44; I cannot find time
                to get the religious lesson&#59;&#34; and this from children of such parents as
                profess to ob&#8211; serve the true religion of Israel &#33; And then&#44; what can
                the school alone accomplish &#63; The home must effect the principal thing in the
                department of re&#8211; ligion. It may be left to the teacher alone to incul&#8211;
                cate worldly knowledge &#59; but religion must be visibly displayed at home before
                the children &#59; love and re&#8211; spect for religion must be made daily and
                hourly manifest at home to the children&#44; and be in word and deeds the evident
                traits of parents&#44; if they are to take root in the minds of the j&#39;ounger
                portions of the household. How then ought the Israelitish religious education to be
                constituted &#63; First&#44; how ought it 7iot to be &#63; In the first place&#44;
                it must not be an educa&#8211; tion to produce a mere religious lip&#8211;worship.
                Juda&#8211; ism requires not the like&#44; and our times are not suited in anywise
                for the same. So long as children stand 34&#42; <pb n="402"/> 402 APPENDIX. ill fear
                of the father&#39;s rod&#44; they may follow it np &#59; but then they seize the
                first opportunity to rid theni&#8211; selyes from it &#59; religion has taken no
                root in them. But much more injurious is that altogether irreligious education which
                imparts to the child nothing of re&#8211; ligion&#44; of prayer&#44; of worship&#44;
                and of the law &#59; or that species which lets children grow up in such ignorance
                that they learn&#44; perhaps for the first time&#44; from the opprobrious epithets
                of other children&#44; that they are Jews. How confounded must then such children
                be&#33; They feel no bond which unites them to our religion&#44; and they are
                neyertheless bound to the name. &#8212; There are also many parents who let their
                children be in&#8211; structed as much in Christianity as in Judaism&#44; and let
                them attend at school during those hours when instruction in the Christian religion
                is imparted. Against such a course&#44; all religion&#44; all reason ex&#8211;
                claims. What shall the children look upon as right&#63; What shall theybelieye&#63;
                With how much laxity&#44; with how much leyity&#44; bow speedily&#44; will the
                children cast olf all religion &#63; In all this lies hidden a deep religious
                corruption. The child must be early penetrated by the breath of religion&#44;
                early&#44; at the first dawning of his con&#8211; sciousness already&#44; must he
                obtain an experienc&#39;e of God&#44; must learn to loye&#44; to be grateful to Him
                &#59; and this loye and gratitude must be strengthened through regular hours of
                prayer&#44; which first should be short&#44; and then constantly increase in
                length&#59; but it should never be omitted&#44; as being the most important
                busi&#8211; ness of the day. He must learn to obey this God as the Supreme
                Wisdom&#44; and to follow his law he must be taught to consider as the highest aim
                of life. He <pb n="403"/> SPECIMENS OF GERMAN PREACHERS. 403 must live in constant
                connexion with this omnipresent God&#44; and regard Him as the attentive
                Observer&#44; as an indulgent Judge of error&#44; as the strict Judge of sin&#44;
                and as the merciful Father of his creatures. And with the increase of years he must
                learn to acknowl&#8211; edge the only one God&#44; and be instructed in his holy
                revealed word&#44; and regard religion as a positive re&#8211; ality&#44; whether it
                be in divine worship&#44; the law&#44; or the practice of piety. And as he has been
                educated as a man&#44; he must now be educated to become a Jew. He must be informed
                of Israel&#39;s eventful history&#44; learn to understand IsraePs high destiny&#44;
                to comprehend Israel&#39;s exalted possession in the word and law of the Lord&#44;
                and how and in what Israel&#39;s religion differs from the systems of others&#44;
                and how highly exalted it is above all human knowledge&#44; and how it animates the
                true Israelite&#44; strengthens&#44; renders him firm&#44; and conducts him to
                everlasting felicity. In this atmos&#8211; phere should the Israelitish child be
                educated&#44; be animated by this spirit&#44; and then will he follow it to
                whithersoever it is turned&#44; and not depart therefrom. I turn myself now to
                you&#44; you elder fathers and mothers&#58; have you thus educated your
                children&#63; and should they not have become all you could wish&#44; are you free
                from all blame &#63; Can you perhaps retrieve something yet of the work left undone
                &#63; Of you&#44; younger fathers and mothers&#44; I ask&#44; do you educate your
                children in the manner indicated&#63; do you give them such a direction that they
                can freely pursue it &#63; I testify against you to&#8211;day that you are
                responsible for your acts to God&#44; the religion of Israel&#44; nay to your own

                desire to be worthy of this high calling&#44; prepare your&#8211; selves for it&#44;
