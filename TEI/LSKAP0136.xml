                you have sent to him amongst other accounts a charge<lb/> of $12 against me for the

                publication as<lb/> I thought &amp; full believed I had paid my brother about two

                decline receiving your paper<lb/> for the present at any rate, or until I have paid
                up my<lb/> deficiency, I regret the necessity but having embraced a new<lb/> life,
                &amp; being at present not settled in occupation, with an in<lb/>creasing family, I
                feel the necessity of debaving<add>?</add> myself of<lb/> this as well as other
                luxuries you will appreciate my mo<lb/>-tives.When <persName>Mr Gutheim</persName>

                practical knowledge of business &amp; commercial affairs gen<lb/>erally, I flatter
                myself that I shall succeed eventually. <persName>Mr<lb/> Moses</persName> asked me
                to act as your agent but I think him very<lb/> capable and efficient &amp; being
                disengaged the best one you can<lb/> procure. I am engaged closely at my studies
