				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>Kingston Jam</placeName>&#58; <date>6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> March<lb/>1863</date>.</p>
				<p>My dear <addressee>Mr. Leeser</addressee>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I duly acknowledge<lb/> your last 2 letters&#44; and the receipt of<lb/> Occidents and 3 copies of the printed<lb/> Edition of the Pentateuch.  You must<lb/> like all good and loyal citizens of the<lb/> great Republic&#44; submit to the difficulties<lb/> of the present situation.  When so much<lb/> paper is required for <hi rend="underline">Green Backs</hi> and<lb/> other numerous varieties of notes&#44; issued<lb/> for the maintenance of public credit&#44; the<lb/> Editor of the Occident should not grumble<lb/> at the rise in price of printing material.<lb/>  Sacrifices are indispensable on the part<lb/> of every individual when so glorious a war<lb/> for the redemption and freedom of the negro<lb/> race&#44; and the subjugation of white rebels<lb/> is to be brought to a triumphant close.</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>When that object is accomplished&#44; your self<lb/> denial&#44; tho&#39; it may involve you in pecuniary<lb/> losses&#44; will be appreciated&#59; and congress&#44; when<lb/> personally appealed to&#44; will&#44; doubtless&#44; especially<lb/> the <hi rend="underline">republican</hi> part of it&#44; recompense you with<lb/> a grant from the public treasury.  Your petition<lb/> cannot fail of being signed by all the Jewish<lb/> population throughout the States&#44; and public<lb/> virtue will thus meet its own reward.  I have<lb/> not yet had time to peruse the article to which<lb/> you direct my attention.  My time is so occupied<lb/> with my school&#44; owing to the Shamash of the<lb/> Congregation&#59; my assistant Hebrew teacher&#44;<lb/> having left for <placeName>California</placeName>&#44; that I have had no<lb/> leisure.  Our new minister&#44; <persName>Mr. Myers</persName>&#44; has got<lb/> himself into a dilemma with some of the big<lb/> wigs of the Synagogue&#44; in consequence of his<lb/> many refusal to sanction the calling up to<lb/> the Sepher&#44; of people married to Christian women&#44;<lb/> and <hi rend="underline">colored</hi> women to boot.  You can have no<lb/> conception of the falling off in this particular congre&#45;<lb/>gation from various causes within the last twenty<lb/> years.  Its numerous members have dwindled down<lb/> to a mere <sic>handfull</sic>&#59; but the pride and arrogance<lb/> remain as of old&#59; and tincture all their acts&#44; to<lb/> which had feelings&#44; towards all who venture to differ<lb/> from the <hi rend="underline">rulers</hi> in opinion&#44; largely add their share.<lb/>  As for the <hi rend="underline">minister</hi> of the other Synagogue&#44; De<add>&#63;</add><lb/> the least I say of him the better.  I am not a <add>Hebrew</add></p>

			<p rend="indent(1)">work out for the Occident&#44; if my <hi rend="underline">liver</hi> permits.<lb/>  <persName>Moses</persName>&#44; it is evident could not have imposed on the<lb/> 2 <add>&#63;</add> tribes the duty of going over the <placeName>Jordan</placeName> <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> but only <add>Hebrew</add> armed for war&#59; and therefore he uses the<lb/> latter&#59; whereas <persName>Joshua</persName> could&#44; as commanded&#44;<lb/> decline to forage for them&#44; and compel them to manage<lb/> their own commissariat.  The sacred text is not<lb/> strained to <del>meet</del> <sic>acord</sic> with this explanation but rather<lb/> removes the difficulty of accounting in what<lb/> way the people subsisted&#44; until the <add>&#63;</add><lb/> fell.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I have formed an acquaintance with<lb/> a <persName>Dr. Daniell</persName>&#8212;of the British army&#44; a man<lb/> of wonderful knowledge in all matters relating<lb/> to <placeName>Africa</placeName>&#44; where he passed 18 years of his life.<lb/>  He is a great scholar&#44; not alone in the studies<lb/> appertaining to his profession&#44; but in others&#44; and<lb/> is esteemed an <hi rend="underline">authority</hi> in <placeName>England</placeName> in philology&#44;<lb/> ethnology&#44; botany&#44; &#38;c.  A bosom friend of <persName>Professor<lb/> Owen</persName> the Eminent naturalist.  We had a<lb/> delightful evening&#39;s talk till 12 o&#39;Clock last<lb/> night&#44; and that is how I spent my <date>Purim</date>.  He<lb/> possesses monotheism&#44; but believes in the Bible&#44;<lb/> not I think&#44; in the Testament.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The war&#44; I see&#44; continues to linger.<lb/>  The termination cannot however be very<lb/> distant&#44; and I hope it will end as I wish.</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>It may however become more complicated<lb/> by the defiant attitude of one of the<lb/> belligerents towards the French Emperor.<lb/>  The English Government is not hypocritical.<lb/>  Your charge is not just.  If it had intervened&#44;<lb/> I incline to think with <persName>Lords Palmerston</persName><lb/> and <persName>Russel</persName> that the <placeName>north</placeName> would have raised<lb/> such an overwhelming force as would have<lb/> crushed the <placeName>south</placeName> at once <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> applies as well to nations as individuals.<lb/>  <placeName>England</placeName> has enough on her hands in meeting the<lb/> hungry cravings of her starving operatives<lb/> without putting her fingers into her neighbour&#39;s<lb/> dish.  I call their neutral action wise and<lb/> humane&#44; and it will prove to be so in the<lb/> long run.  The feelings of the English government<lb/> &#38; nation too are with the <placeName>south</placeName>&#44; and the<lb/> ravings of <persName>Bright</persName> &#38; <persName>Cobden</persName> and the anti&#45;<lb/> slavery party are ineffectual to change them.<lb/>  I am alive to the short comings of my native<lb/> country&#44; but <del>they are</del> in this matter it is not<lb/> obnoxious to the abuse lavished upon it by the<lb/> people of <placeName>America</placeName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">My wife and mother join with<lb/> me in affectionate wishes &#38; regards</p>

				<p>but I would surprise you&#44; were I to often the<lb/> budget of doings and sayings of this man.  Judaism<lb/> is in a bad state here&#44; spirit of religion is utterly<lb/> wanting&#44; with no one competent to rouse it from the<lb/> torpor into which it has fallen.  We have had here a<lb/> certain <persName>Rabbi Alfendri</persName> from <placeName>Smyrna</placeName>&#44; his mission<lb/> here was a failure&#59; we are too poor ourselves&#44; and<lb/> have too many indigent ones in our midst&#44; to<lb/> contribute to the claims &#40;&#63;&#41; of such travelling gentry.<lb/>  Why don&#39;t they stop at home&#63;  We hear of the<lb/> doings and writings of <persName>Mr. De Solla</persName>&#44; late of <placeName>Montego<lb/> Bay</placeName>&#44; against <persName>Mr. Morais</persName>.  Can&#39;t you send me some<lb/> of that precious productions&#63;  Are you not going<lb/> to use your pen in defense of scripture against<lb/> <persName>Bishop Calendo</persName>&#63;  <persName>Benisch</persName> has come out manfully&#44;<lb/> but altho&#39; he has answered some points admirably&#44;<lb/> I do not like <hi rend="underline">all</hi> he has written.  The wood&#44; water&#44;<lb/> and pasture question he has handled ably.  I<lb/> am&#44; just to keep my hand in&#44; maintaining a cor<lb/>respondence on the subject with a <sic>xtian</sic> clergyman&#59;<lb/> and made the word <add>Hebrew</add> <del>the</del> my study&#44; at his request.<lb/>  I cannot agree that it means equipped&#44; or harnessed&#44;<lb/> in gist&#44; or armed&#44; but <add>&#63;</add> think it signifies<lb/> v<hi rend="underline">ictualled</hi> or <hi rend="underline">provisioned</hi> from <add>Hebrew</add> the abdomen.<lb/>  The Bible says <add>Hebrew</add>&#59; Does that imply that<lb/> they had no <hi rend="underline">food</hi> at all except the <add>Hebrew</add>&#63;  I should say<lb/> that <add>Hebrew</add> means <hi rend="underline">cooked</hi> or <hi rend="underline">prepared</hi> provisions&#44; and<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> being joined to it&#44; an act of preparation or<lb/> cooking is inferred&#44; the same as <add>Hebrew</add> to <add>Hebrew</add> before<lb/> the latter becomes <add>Hebrew</add>.  Hence the Israelites might</p>
			<pb n="6"/>
				<p>not have had <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; and get the onions&#44; leeks<lb/> garlic&#44; and Cucumbers as vegetables&#44; and the<lb/> melons and <hi rend="underline">dates</hi> as fruits might have afforded<lb/> them a plentiful supply of food for the <add>Hebrew</add> belly<lb/> or stomach&#44; and hence they were <add>Hebrew</add>.  In <persName>Joshua</persName><lb/> chap&#58; i 11 the people are ordered <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; whilst<lb/> in verse 14 the <persName>Reub</persName>&#58; <persName>Gad</persName>&#58; through&#58; are told <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> ye shall pass over <hi rend="underline">victualled</hi>&#44; ergo&#44; you must<lb/> furnish your own commissarist.  Again in IV.12<lb/> it is written they passed over <add>Hebrew</add> <hi rend="underline">provisioned</hi>&#44; and in<lb/> the following verse <add>Hebrew</add> in <hi rend="underline">fighting tr<add>&#63;</add></hi>&#44; or<lb/> <hi rend="underline">armed for war</hi>.  In Judges VII.II the <add>Hebrew</add> could not<lb/> have been the <hi rend="underline">armed men</hi>&#44; or they would have been<lb/> called sentinels&#44; patriots&#44; or piquets&#44; whose duty is<lb/> always <add>Hebrew</add>&#59; and in verse 19 they are properly<lb/> named&#44; <add>Hebrew</add> which you have rendered <hi rend="underline">sentinels</hi>.  These<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> must consequently have been the <hi rend="underline"><sic>suttlers</sic></hi><lb/> whose place or station was <hi rend="underline">outside</hi> the <hi rend="underline">lives</hi>&#44; and<lb/> not within them with the soldiery.  If this view<lb/> can be maintained&#44; it disposes of the objections of<lb/> those who assert that the people had no food but<lb/> the <add>Hebrew</add>.  God did not lead them thro&#39; a fertile country<lb/> like the <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; but into the <add>Hebrew</add>&#59; yet that unpro&#45;<lb/>ductive waste had no terrors for them&#44; they had no<lb/> immediate fears of hunger&#44; for they were <add>Hebrew</add> furnished<lb/> with food&#44; tho&#39; not with <add>Hebrew</add> cooked food.  If<lb/> rationalists must be satisfied and shown demon&#45;<lb/>stratively that the multitude was not in a<lb/> starving condition&#44; my exegesis will convince<lb/> them.
