				<p rend="align(right)"><date>Friday&#44; 20th Adar&#44; &#40;April&#41;&#44; 1860</date>.</p>
				<p>Very honored friend&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I have received your worthy letter with a willing soul. Why<lb/> and wherefore have you turned down my important articles without telling<lb/> me a word &#63; &#8220;Is this the Torah and this its reward&#63;&#8221; If I could have<lb/> suspected this&#44; I would have offered them to a different publication.<lb/> How can your newspaper prosper &#63; In your time it has had a good develop&#45;<lb/>ment. You will never be finished with this stuff of <hi rend="underline"><persName>de Sala</persName></hi><lb/> when only the very few learned people in the world are interested in it. &#8220;The dwel&#45;<lb/>ler in heaven laughs&#8221;&#44; for God hears my laughter<add>&#63;</add>. &#8220;God mocks them&#8221;.<lb/> Whom&#44; then&#44; Who is interested in <persName>Ellis Joseph&#39;s</persName> present <hi rend="sup">gift</hi>&#44; who leaves<lb/> his congregation like sheep without a shepherd&#63; That&#39;s fodder for the<lb/> &#8220;Messenger&#8221;. I regret this matter very much. This affair will be old<lb/> news next week. I have some more material&#44; especially <persName>Krones</persName>&#44; of <placeName>Bres&#45;<lb/>lau</placeName>&#44; sent me his excellent program for the <persName>Frankel</persName> seminary of <date>January<lb/> 27&#44; 1866</date>&#44; and to have let me say good luck&#44; through you. He gave <persName>Szold</persName> only a<lb/> German certificate&#44; for he had not attended the Seminary as a student&#59;<lb/> he only lodged with him&#44; but did not study. He has no title <hi rend="underline">Morenu</hi>&#44;<lb/> and certainly not the permissions to be a rabbi. He has a <hi rend="underline">Morenu</hi> and&#44;<lb/> perhaps&#44; even a <hi rend="underline">Semicha</hi> from the ultraorthodox <persName>Rabbi Tiktin</persName> in <placeName>Breslau</placeName>&#44;<lb/> who writes willingly&#44; without knowing the warning of the rabbis. It is<lb/> a case of &#8220;A disqualified one who makes illegitimate children legitimate&#8221;.<lb/>  So you see again these ultraorthodox. There is no fear of God in this<lb/> place&#44; there is no God in another place. <persName>Frankel</persName> is hurt by your<lb/> failure to send him the &#8220;Occident&#8221;. He will send you his &#8220;Monatschrifft&#8221;.<lb/> He wants to write against <persName>Szola</persName>. In exchange for that German certificate&#44;<lb/> <persName>Szola</persName> presented the seminary with an entire set of Talmud. &#8220;Bribery blinds<lb/> even the wise&#8221;. <persName>Frankel</persName> mentions him among the donors&#44; but only as<lb/> &#8220;<persName>Herr Szola</persName>&#44; preacher in <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>&#44; not &#8220;doctor&#8221; or &#8220;Rabbiner.&#8221;  What does<lb/> <persName>Rabbi Abraham Rice</persName> say about this &#63; &#8220;The four houses of trampling&#8221; which</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>developed out of the one which he consecrated all of them torn apart<lb/> and over&#45;pious&#44; occupying themselves with the treatise about Samaritans<lb/> and those who fear sexual looseness.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Couldn&#39;t you obtain for me&#44; by means of a Committee sent to <persName>Mr.<lb/> Hart</persName>&#44; a call for one of two lectures on history&#44; over there &#63; Please<lb/> see that it is arranged. &#8220;The deed is greater than the doer&#8221;.  <persName>Frankel&#39;s</persName><lb/> discussion in the program&#44; about marriage&#44; is excellent.  I would have<lb/> sent it to you&#44; but I am angry. I expect that the entire article will<lb/> be printed next week.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Write to me about a lecture. I want to read &#8220;<persName>Esther</persName>&#8221; for them&#44;<lb/> or about the establishment of the Second Temple. Write to me about it.<lb/> Perhaps I could work in the German congregation&#44; but only truth and<lb/> peace. I expect a immediate reply.</p>
			<p rend="indent(4)">Your friend&#44;</p>
			<p rend="indent(5)"><persName role="author">Jonah Bondi</persName></p>
				<p>In the <sic>Porutguese</sic> congregation here&#44; an examination for Sanochecim<add>&#63;</add> took<lb/> place here recently&#44; at which <persName>Solomon Joseph</persName> and <persName>Sanat Phillips</persName> were<lb/> chosen as Shochetim and <persName>Rabbi Abraham</persName> as the head of the court. Think&#44;<lb/> should such things happen in <placeName>Israel</placeName> &#63; Are these Jews &#63; They appear to<lb/> me like Karaites who have Tzizit and T&#39;phillin hanging in the synagogue.<lb/> They may have the schochet and the slaughtering knife also in the syn&#45;<lb/>agogue. Stand up the former and hang up the latter. The sensible pro&#45;<lb/>posal&#44; to join in with other congregations and appoint schochetim who are<lb/> capable&#44; in various parts of the city&#44; was turned down&#44; in order that the<lb/> Portuguese Jew who lives in the 40&#39;s &#40;streets&#41; should not be forced to<lb/> eat slaughtered meat because of the distance. That would be compulsion.<lb/> As it is&#44; the schochet stands in his place and we changed the process<lb/> around. The slaughtering knife is not placed on the throat&#44; but it hangs<lb/> in the air. <persName>Einhorn&#39;s</persName> protest must be welcome to you and to me. He has<lb/> made up his mind that that is better. Decision forces decision. Thus<lb/> the board will make no further concessions &#63; The <persName>Harts</persName> will not permit<lb/> <persName>Lewengut</persName> to represent them. They will attain their ends through<lb/> <persName>Einhorn</persName>. Thank him for it. That is the reason why you should keep si&#45;<lb/>lent now. Let the others bargain&#44; who opposed your views&#44; such as <persName>Isaacs</persName>.<lb/> &#8220;The wise man has eyes in his head&#44; the fool walks in darkness&#8221;. That<lb/> is how it had to be. <persName>Dr&#44; Raphall</persName> called the <persName>de Sola</persName> &#8220;en soof<add>&#63;</add>&#8221;.</p>
