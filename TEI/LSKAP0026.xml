            <p rend="indent(1)">My dear Sir</p>
            <p rend="indent(3)">It is a long time since I had<lb/> the pleasure of hearing from you.
                Your time<lb/> is, I suppose, as usual, pretty well occupied<lb/> with your numerous
                public and private duties,<lb/> and as, in addition, you have to
                    <sic>chaperone</sic><lb/> your nieces, your silence is not surprising.
                There<lb/> is nothing new to communicate respecting<lb/> religious matters. The
                question whether the<lb/> Representatives and minister combined are to<lb/> decide
                on the admissibility or not of the required<lb/> changes and modifications in public
                worship, or<lb/> whether the minister alone, has not yet been<lb/> decided by the
                Government. The affair is<lb/> therefore in status-quo. Meanwhile the small<lb/>
                minority identified with the origination of the<lb/> measure, commonly called
                    <persName>Mr. Clorio's</persName><add>?</add> clique, keeps<lb/> away from the
                Synagogue, tho', occasionally, its</p>
            <pb n="1V"/>
            <p>members are seen in their places. Their chief and I<lb/> are not on intimate terms
                however. I have done,<lb/> according to the admission of his own friends, all<lb/>
                that a man and a minister of religion <hi rend="underline">can</hi> do, to<lb/>
                reconcile past differences, not of <hi rend="underline">my</hi> creating, but<lb/>
                as he is an impracticable man, I have now come<lb/> to the inflexible resolution of
                refusing all further<lb/> overtures, and to avoid all risk of prospective<lb/>
                disputes, certain of occurring if we are on speaking<lb/> terms, I shall say
                    “<add>אם השמאל ואימינה וג"ו</add>. Our public<lb/> services, particularly on
                    <date>Sabbath</date> mornings, continue<lb/> to be well-attended, and Quietness
                reigns in the<lb/> Congregation.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The news of our late lamented friend<lb/>
                <persName>Mrs. Ostermans'</persName> death gave <persName>Mrs. N.</persName>
                and<lb/> me a great shock. She was all you<lb/> described her. What a melancholy
                termination<lb/> of a noble life. We loved her as a dear sister,<lb/> and the time
                we lived in her house <add>?</add>,<lb/> and she another sister in ours at
                    <placeName>W/O</placeName>, were some of<lb/> our happiest days on earth. We
                often recur to<lb/> those times with that sadness and regret inseparable</p>
            <pb n="2R"/>
            <p>from the thought that they are passed and gone<lb/> to return no more. Be good enough
                to send<lb/> me the address of <persName>Mrs O's</persName> sister
                    <persName>Hannah</persName>. The<lb/>
                <persName>Pollack's</persName> will be able to tell you, but I know not<lb/> where
                they live in <placeName>Pa.</placeName> How goes on your plan<lb/> for a college in
                your city! I observe that the<lb/> situations in the southern congregations are
                not<lb/> yet filled. There must ever be a difficulty in<lb/> the way of getting
                proper men until the college<lb/> be established. With the change of the season,
                to<lb/> the great heat felt in this place from <date>May</date> till now,<lb/> my
                liver begins to trouble me. If the complaint<lb/> should become as troublesome as it
                was in <date>64</date>, I<lb/> most certainly will have to take a trip to the
                    <placeName>states</placeName><lb/> for a month or two. My good old
                assistant,<lb/> Chazan <persName>Maduro</persName>, is, I fear, almost past duty.
                He<lb/> is now 68 years old, and a long neglected hernia<lb/> is making sad havoc
                with his constitution. He has<lb/> scarcely done any duty the last 5 months. The
                whole<lb/> falls on me. I do not mind the labor for the sake<lb/> of the old
                gentleman, who, if super <add>?</add> and<lb/> pensioner, will lose perhaps more
                than half his salary,</p>
            <pb n="2V"/>
            <p>But I also begin to feel after 32 years residence,<lb/>
                <del>almost</del>, in place-like <placeName>St. Thomas</placeName>,
                    <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, and<lb/>
                <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>, a want of former rigor and strength.<lb/> I have
                not the energy of former days, at a time<lb/> when I require it more than ever to
                accomplish<lb/> a certain object I have long had in view. We manage<lb/> to have
                service every night of the <add>עומר</add>, the same as last<lb/> year, and 4
                services from <date>Friday</date> evening to <date>sabbath</date><lb/> evening. So
                we are not so bad after all. I coincide<lb/> entirely with your arguments against
                the new views<lb/> of <persName>Geiger</persName>. But the agitation of such
                questions keeps<lb/> alive Jewish attention to the mosaic Religion, and<lb/>
                prevents that apathy and indifference more destructive<lb/> to its progress than
                erroneous theories.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Plenty of opportunities offer themselves monthly<lb/> for writing me
                a few lines. The Brazilian, <sic>Venezuelean</sic>, and <add>?</add> steamers bring
                mails from the <placeName>states</placeName><lb/> every month. <persName>Mrs.

                best wishes. Hoping<lb/> this will find you in health, and with remembrances<lb/> to
