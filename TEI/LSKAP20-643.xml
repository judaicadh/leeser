            <p rend="align(right)">To the Editor of the Occident!</p>
            <p>Rev. Sir! In the <date>April</date> Number of the Occident<lb/> I found an article by
                one who adopts <add>אמת</add> for his name,<lb/> but it is indeed the first time,
                that I see "trust" <sic>controdic˶<lb/>ting</sic> itself, a <sic>fictious</sic>
                truth is the newest of all the<lb/>
                <sic>phantomes</sic> of the modern time. Permit me, Sir, to state<lb/> some words
                against that article. The highly learned<lb/> "truth" expounds (page 5) "The
                Occident cannot signify<lb/> news or light from the <placeName>western
                    states</placeName>, but xc<add>?</add> to instruct<lb/> ˶the Israelites." I
                suppose in my humble opinion, it is the<lb/> very problem of a <sic>jewish</sic>
                journal to represent the present<lb/> history of our people as much as accessible,
                all other articles<lb/> are a mere addition to attire the pamphlet, or a
                history<lb/> of <sic>hebrew</sic> literature of the day, causes and consequences
                of<lb/> the ruling spirit of the age. Truth will find the motto<lb/> of the Occident
                    <sic>corrosponding</sic> with my views about Journalism,<lb/> if he merely
                considers, that old latin proverb: Historia<lb/> mater <sic>vivae</sic> est. History
                is indeed the teacher of life and<lb/> the best conductor through the career of
                life; History is<lb/> a second and very distinct revelation. God placed
                    <persName>Moses</persName><lb/> on a rock, where he should learn to know God by
                His<lb/> divine Attributes. <persName>Maimonides</persName> calls that rock
                "nature"<lb/> and I add to it ˶History" both of them reveal the God of<lb/>
                <placeName>Israel</placeName> in His Glory and Majesty. Page 5: "Truth" says:
                "and<lb/> ˶thirdly how to conduct themselves towards their neighbors<lb/> ˶which
                latter duty includes, according to the Talmud, the observance<lb/> ˶of the whole
                religion" I most <sic>emphitically</sic> object against<lb/> such an atheistical
                statement, where, O <sic>fictious</sic> brush! where<lb/> is, <date>Sabbath</date>,
                Festivals, Milah, Shehita, Tefilin, Mesusah,<lb/> Zirith, Pidyon Bechar, Mazah and
                many other commands<lb/> understood under, love thy neighbor? He pleases to
                translate<lb/> the word of the Talmud <add>ואהבת לרעך כמוך זו זה כלל גדול</add>, And
                thou<lb/> shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, is the principal<lb/> command of the
                law; but every one will understand that the<lb/>
                <add>ש</add> of <add>שבתורה</add> could be spared, I <sic>persume</sic>, it
                ought<lb/> to be translated: Love thy neighbor as thyself is one of<lb/> the grand
                principles of our law, but there are still others</p>
            <pb n="1V"/>
            <p>principles and germs, as: love God, be holy xc<add>?</add>, but they are<lb/> above
                the horizon of many people, as it was the case<lb/> with the <sic>Prosalite</sic>
                demanding of <persName>Hillel</persName> to learn him all<lb/> the Torah while
                standing on one foot. Does perhaps Truth suppose<lb/> we shall learn to love our
                God, to become fit and willingly<lb/> to love our neighbour? Now, Sir, we love our
                neighbour in<lb/> order to learn to love also our God, then the latter is a<lb/>
                higher principle than the former. Or does he suppose,<lb/> that we shall be holy in
                order that our manners and feelings<lb/> towards our fellow-mortal should be pure?
                That is the<lb/> beginning but the end of it shall be: to serve God with a<lb/> pure
                heart with a spotless mind. "Truth" <del>is</del> does not know<lb/> neither the
                true problem of Journalism nor the principles<lb/> of our religion. His views are
                clearly those of a Chabalnic<lb/> Chasid, or with <sic>english</sic> words of a
                    <sic>jewish</sic> methodist,<lb/> as they have been masterly described by
                    <persName>Dr. Lilienthal</persName>,<lb/> ignorance, arrogance and
                    <sic>hypocracy</sic> mixed up with a good<lb/> portion of superstition and
                prejudice are the attributes of the<lb/> majority of the so called Chasidim in
                        <placeName><sic>Polland</sic></placeName> and
                <placeName>Russia</placeName>,<lb/> but <persName>Dr. Lilienthal</persName> treated
                them with too much modesty, therefore<lb/> the representative of that class in
                    <placeName>America</placeName> charges him<lb/> with the tendency to break down
                the fences of our sages.<lb/> He did not proof his arrogant presumption, not
                because<lb/> he would not, merely because he could not. We shall<lb/> petition the
                Congress at <placeName>Washington</placeName>, to call Truth to<lb/> the Censorship
                for the <sic>american</sic>
                <sic>jewish</sic> press, and we<lb/> will soon have a prompt Zionmächter. Next<lb/>
                Truth comes out with his well studied phraseology against<lb/> the advertisement of
                the <placeName>Charleston</placeName>
                <sic>congrigation</sic>, he is<lb/>
                <sic>aversed</sic> to their kind of reading the Bible, and his argument<lb/> to
                condemn them is, that the annual reading was already intro˶<lb/>duced by
                    <persName>Ezra</persName>, <add>נקרא ומתורגם</add> is also a doctrine of
                    <persName>Ezra</persName>
                <add>כל אדם קורא לעצמו</add> 5<lb/> is another doctrine of
                <persName>Ezra</persName>, who entitled us to violate these<lb/> doctrines? none
                under heaven, ever not Truth. He thunders<lb/> about their <sic>fasion</sic> to read
                the Bible, but against the organ<lb/> in the Synagogue, <sic>english</sic> prayers
                    xc<add>?</add> he knows nothing<lb/> to state about. How ignorant is Truth"!</p>
            <pb n="2R"/>
            <p>He comes out in a particular manner against the violation<lb/> of the second
                festivals; page 8 he says, that God commanded<lb/> You shall not add to nor
                diminish! Thou shalt not<lb/> turn from the word to the right or to the left!
                then<lb/> he gives as the reason of the second festivals <add>של תוף מרים</add>,
                that is<lb/> indeed below criticism. I will not rectify the steps of<lb/> the
                    <placeName>Charleston</placeName>
                <sic>Congrigation</sic>, I will but show how short-<lb/>sighted "Truth" is, there
                are much better reasons in the<lb/>
                <add>משנה</add> for the second festival, but Truth did not know<lb/> them; there are
                reasons, which do not <sic>controdict</sic> the<lb/> above mentioned biblical
                quotation, but "Truth" knows<lb/> nothing of them. Then Truth thunders against the
                articles<lb/> of <sic>Talmid</sic> and <persName>H. G.</persName>, supposing they
                should have discussed<lb/> their disagreements in their own study
                    <sic>privatly</sic> among<lb/> themselves. These articles have been published
                for the purpose<lb/> to <sic>ashame</sic> all those omniscient and all-understanding<lb/>
                <sic>schoolars</sic> like "Truth," that they are not mindful enough<lb/> to write a
                single word in <sic>defence</sic> of their own religion.<lb/> "Truth" refers
                    <sic>Talmid</sic> to the <add>חכמי התלמוד</add>, but, Sir, what<lb/> say the
                    <add>חכמי התלמוד</add>? If you know it, you may say it, that<lb/> also the
                public may know it and <sic>Talmid</sic> be <sic>controdicted</sic>.<lb/> A
                    <sic>jewish</sic> Journal publishes Clesphamans articles against<lb/> Judaism,
                based altogether upon one error, the Editor<lb/> published them to awaken the
                sleeping <sic>schoolars</sic> of the<lb/> western hemisphere, and—O pity! O tempus!
                O mores!<lb/> —"Truth" arose and wishes, a Journal of this enlightened<lb/> age
                shall fill up its <sic>columnes</sic> with discussions about<lb/>
                <add>אתרוגים מורכבים</add> about Lard Oil, shall teach the people<lb/> a better
                knowledge of the hebrew, Gemara and Kebalah—<lb/><add>?</add>balah—did you hear it?

            <p>It is a pity to meet such dark midnights under the sun<lb/> of this all-exploring
                age, and I deem it proper to disclose<lb/> to the public eye how dark this midnight
                is; therefore<lb/> you may please to assert this in the next number<lb/> of the
                Occident, but if you can not, you may please<lb/> to send it back to me, for I am
                sure that during<lb/> a space of two months other people will address<lb/> that so
                called Truth. I should have signed my<lb/> name justice but I am <sic>truely</sic>
