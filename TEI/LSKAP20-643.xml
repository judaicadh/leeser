				<p rend="align(right)">To the Editor of the Occident&#33;</p>
				<p>Rev. Sir&#33;  In the <date>April</date> Number of the Occident<lb/> I found an article by one who adopts <add>Hebrew</add> for his name&#44;<lb/> but it is indeed the first time&#44; that I see &#34;trust&#34; <sic>controdic&#758;<lb/>ting</sic> itself&#44; a <sic>fictious</sic> truth is the newest of all the<lb/> <sic>phantomes</sic> of the modern time.  Permit me&#44; Sir&#44; to state<lb/> some words against that article.  The highly learned<lb/> &#34;truth&#34; expounds &#40;page 5&#41; &#34;The Occident cannot signify<lb/> news or light from the <placeName>western states</placeName>&#44; but xc<add>&#63;</add> to instruct<lb/> &#758;the Israelites.&#34;  I suppose in my humble opinion&#44; it is the<lb/> very problem of a <sic>jewish</sic> journal to represent the present<lb/> history of our people as much as accessible&#44; all other articles<lb/> are a mere addition to attire the pamphlet&#44; or a history<lb/> of <sic>hebrew</sic> literature of the day&#44; causes and consequences of<lb/> the ruling spirit of the age.  Truth will find the motto<lb/> of the Occident <sic>corrosponding</sic> with my views about Journalism&#44;<lb/> if he merely considers&#44; that old latin proverb&#58; Historia<lb/> mater <sic>vivae</sic> est.  History is indeed the teacher of life and<lb/> the best conductor through the career of life&#59; History is<lb/> a second and very distinct revelation.  God placed <persName>Moses</persName><lb/> on a rock&#44; where he should learn to know God by His<lb/> divine Attributes.  <persName>Maimonides</persName> calls that rock &#34;nature&#34;<lb/> and I add to it &#758;History&#34; both of them reveal the God of<lb/> <placeName>Israel</placeName> in His Glory and Majesty.  Page 5&#58; &#34;Truth&#34; says&#58; &#34;and<lb/> &#758;thirdly how to conduct themselves towards their neighbors<lb/> &#758;which latter duty includes&#44; according to the Talmud&#44; the observance<lb/> &#758;of the whole religion&#34; I most <sic>emphitically</sic> object against<lb/> such an atheistical statement&#44; where&#44; O <sic>fictious</sic> brush&#33; where<lb/> is&#44; <date>Sabbath</date>&#44; Festivals&#44; Milah&#44; Shehita&#44; Tefilin&#44; Mesusah&#44;<lb/> Zirith&#44; Pidyon Bechar&#44; Mazah and many other commands<lb/> understood under&#44; love thy neighbor&#63;  He pleases to translate<lb/> the word of the Talmud <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; And thou<lb/> shalt love thy neighbour as thyself&#44; is the principal<lb/> command of the law&#59; but every one will understand that the<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> of <add>Hebrew</add> could be spared&#44; I <sic>persume</sic>&#44; it ought<lb/> to be translated&#58; Love thy neighbor as thyself is one of<lb/> the grand principles of our law&#44; but there are still others</p>
			<pb n="1V"/>
				<p>principles and germs&#44; as&#58; love God&#44; be holy xc<add>&#63;</add>&#44; but they are<lb/> above the horizon of many people&#44; as it was the case<lb/> with the <sic>Prosalite</sic> demanding of <persName>Hillel</persName> to learn him all<lb/> the Torah while standing on one foot.  Does perhaps Truth suppose<lb/> we shall learn to love our God&#44; to become fit and willingly<lb/> to love our neighbour&#63;  Now&#44; Sir&#44; we love our neighbour in<lb/> order to learn to love also our God&#44; then the latter is a<lb/> higher principle than the former.  Or does he suppose&#44;<lb/> that we shall be holy in order that our manners and feelings<lb/> towards our fellow&#45;mortal should be pure&#63;  That is the<lb/> beginning but the end of it shall be&#58; to serve God with a<lb/> pure heart with a spotless mind.  &#34;Truth&#34; <del>is</del> does not know<lb/> neither the true problem of Journalism nor the principles<lb/> of our religion.  His views are clearly those of a Chabalnic<lb/> Chasid&#44; or with <sic>english</sic> words of a <sic>jewish</sic> methodist&#44;<lb/> as they have been masterly described by <persName>Dr. Lilienthal</persName>&#44;<lb/> ignorance&#44; arrogance and <sic>hypocracy</sic> mixed up with a good<lb/> portion of superstition and prejudice are the attributes of the<lb/> majority of the so called Chasidim in <placeName><sic>Polland</sic></placeName> and <placeName>Russia</placeName>&#44;<lb/> but <persName>Dr. Lilienthal</persName> treated them with too much modesty&#44; therefore<lb/> the representative of that class in <placeName>America</placeName> charges him<lb/> with the tendency to break down the fences of our sages.<lb/>  He did not proof his arrogant presumption&#44; not because<lb/> he would not&#44; merely because he could not.  We shall<lb/> petition the Congress at <placeName>Washington</placeName>&#44; to call Truth to<lb/> the Censorship for the <sic>american</sic> <sic>jewish</sic> press&#44; and we<lb/> will soon have a prompt Zionm&#228;chter.  Next<lb/> Truth comes out with his well studied phraseology against<lb/> the advertisement of the <placeName>Charleston</placeName> <sic>congrigation</sic>&#44; he is<lb/> <sic>aversed</sic> to their kind of reading the Bible&#44; and his argument<lb/> to condemn them is&#44; that the annual reading was already intro&#758;<lb/>duced by <persName>Ezra</persName>&#44; <add>Hebrew</add> is also a doctrine of <persName>Ezra</persName> <add>Hebrew</add> 5<lb/> is another doctrine of <persName>Ezra</persName>&#44; who entitled us to violate these<lb/> doctrines&#63; none under heaven&#44; ever not Truth.  He thunders<lb/> about their <sic>fasion</sic> to read the Bible&#44; but against the organ<lb/> in the Synagogue&#44; <sic>english</sic> prayers xc<add>&#63;</add> he knows nothing<lb/> to state about.  How ignorant is Truth&#34;&#33;</p>
			<pb n="2R"/>
				<p>He comes out in a particular manner against the violation<lb/> of the second festivals&#59; page 8 he says&#44; that God commanded<lb/> You shall not add to nor diminish&#33;  Thou shalt not<lb/> turn from the word to the right or to the left&#33; then<lb/> he gives as the reason of the second festivals <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; that is<lb/> indeed below criticism.  I will not rectify the steps of<lb/> the <placeName>Charleston</placeName> <sic>Congrigation</sic>&#44; I will but show how short&#45;<lb/>sighted &#34;Truth&#34; is&#44; there are much better reasons in the<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> for the second festival&#44; but Truth did not know<lb/> them&#59; there are reasons&#44; which do not <sic>controdict</sic> the<lb/> above mentioned biblical quotation&#44; but &#34;Truth&#34; knows<lb/> nothing of them.  Then Truth thunders against the articles<lb/> of <sic>Talmid</sic> and <persName>H. G.</persName>&#44; supposing they should have discussed<lb/> their disagreements in their own study <sic>privatly</sic> among<lb/> themselves.  These articles have been published for the purpose<lb/> to <sic>ashame</sic> all those omniscient and all&#45;understanding<lb/> <sic>schoolars</sic> like &#34;Truth&#44;&#34; that they are not mindful enough<lb/> to write a single word in <sic>defence</sic> of their own religion.<lb/>  &#34;Truth&#34; refers <sic>Talmid</sic> to the <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; but&#44; Sir&#44; what<lb/> say the <add>Hebrew</add>&#63;  If you know it&#44; you may say it&#44; that<lb/> also the public may know it and <sic>Talmid</sic> be <sic>controdicted</sic>.<lb/>  A <sic>jewish</sic> Journal publishes Clesphamans articles against<lb/> Judaism&#44; based altogether upon one error&#44; the Editor<lb/> published them to awaken the sleeping <sic>schoolars</sic> of the<lb/> western hemisphere&#44; and&#8212;O pity&#33;  O tempus&#33; O mores&#33;<lb/> &#8212;&#34;Truth&#34; arose and wishes&#44; a Journal of this enlightened<lb/> age shall fill up its <sic>columnes</sic> with discussions about<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> about Lard Oil&#44; shall teach the people<lb/> a better knowledge of the hebrew&#44; Gemara and Kebalah&#8212;<lb/><add>&#63;</add>balah&#8212;did you hear it&#63;  There is the Chahatin Chasid</p>
			<pb n="2V"/>
				<p>It is a pity to meet such dark midnights under the sun<lb/> of this all&#45;exploring age&#44; and I deem it proper to disclose<lb/> to the public eye how dark this midnight is&#59; therefore<lb/> you may please to assert this in the next number<lb/> of the Occident&#44; but if you can not&#44; you may please<lb/> to send it back to me&#44; for I am sure that during<lb/> a space of two months other people will address<lb/> that so called Truth.  I should have signed my<lb/> name justice but I am <sic>truely</sic> your friend</p>
