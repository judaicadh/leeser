                              <p rend="indent(5)">Last week I intended adding<lb/> some news items
                                        to the letter I there sent you, but being<lb/> interrupted,
                                        was obliged to close my letter ,as <add>מועד</add> was
                                        close<lb/> at hand. I shall now send you some news, though
                                        not<lb/> all I then intended, as I received the
                                                  <date>March</date> &amp; <date>April</date> nos
                                        of<lb/> the Occident just as I was going to Synagogue on the
                                        day<lb/> I had been abusing your agent (and justly so I
                                        guess) for<lb/> delay. I see you noticed the appointment of
                                                  <persName>Mr Benjamin</persName> &amp;<lb/> the

                                        something more than my due. If the<lb/> young ones “got up”

                                        parents were the sole agents, I certainly<lb/> indulged them
                                        with <hi rend="underline">3</hi> rehearsals, and encouraged
                                        them to<lb/> get on with their design, firstly because these
                                        kind of<lb/> things are the grounds for those future
                                        reminiscences of<lb/> pleasant boy hood, which cause us to
                                        love the feasts<lb/> of the Almighty because they are the
                                        feasts of our youth, and<lb/> secondly because it was
                                        improving to them. The notes on<lb/> Perisol<add>?</add>
                                        have been very correctly inserted this time, true<lb/> there
                                        are a few other graphical errors, but what of them?<lb/> It
                                        strikes me that I shall be rather hard pushed to send<lb/>
                                        you the continuation as I have so many things to do and<lb/>

                                        placemen, From<lb/> the circulars received I find that you
                                        are not desirous that<lb/> our congregation should have
                                        anything to do with the proposed<lb/> assembly. True you
                                        send us circulars, but these circulars<lb/> tell us that the
                                        delegates are only to be from congregations<lb/> in the
                                        Union. We Britishers are to be kept out, whether<lb/> near

                                        may say, however, that the majority of my congregation<lb/>
                                        approve the measure. I might it is true call a meeting<lb/>
                                        the result of which would undoubtedly be a resolution<lb/>
                                        unanimously passed after this fashion “Resolved. That
                                        as<lb/> we are not wanted in the proposed assembly; as
                                        is<lb/> evident from a circular just received from

                                        But this I wish to avoid, now my dear friend<lb/> if you
                                        really desire to see this congregation represented<lb/> at
