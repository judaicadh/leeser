            <p rend="indent(1)">Dr Sir</p>
            <p>By rights I ought not to have noticed the report which reached me<lb/> respecting the
                hospital movement in <placeName>baltimore</placeName><add>?</add>; for if people do
                not<lb/> choose to inform the conductors of Hebrew periodicals of their<lb/> doings,
                I do not see any necessity on the part of the conductors<lb/> of these to bother
                themselves about what has not been communicated<lb/>
                <sic>officiallyy</sic>. I really do not see the propriety in the people of<lb/>
                <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>
                <del>?</del> hardly ever sending me a line respecting any thing<lb/> taking place
                among them; in this the reformer, the <hi rend="underline"><sic>moderador</sic></hi>
                and<lb/> orthodox are alike; it seems the Occident with its editor are of<lb/> no
                use to them. It is otherwise with the Israelite; this<lb/>
                <add>blank</add> edited by the gentlemanly of polished<lb/>
                <add>blank</add> has its favorite<add>?</add> in large numbers. If you<lb/>
                <add>blank</add> on the old proverb have <sic>I</sic><add>?</add> “a fellow-feeling
                makes us<lb/> wondrous kind.” It is not joke what I say. I felt the reverse of<lb/>
                pleased to receive the first and only information of the hospital<lb/> movement from
                a person who had been in <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, or rather from<lb/> one
                who heard it from another. They say “reported” to some and<lb/> some to me. It is
                not fair<add>?</add> and those who labor for the <sic>Israelit</sic><lb/> in this
                country, if their treatment that <add>blank</add> mine<lb/> have another cause for
                complaint, nay disgust for the cruel <sic>neglec</sic><lb/> with which they are
                uniformly treated.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">But a truce to complaining, which I am certain will produce no<lb/>
                remedy. <sic>let</sic> me resort to your request <del>?</del> retired<lb/> last
                evening at nine P. M. (your letter reached me at ½ p.5 P.M.<lb/> on Dr
                    <add>blank</add> and he kindly lent me the accompanying volume, at<lb/> the same
                time stating that $4 would buy it. I thought the hint</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>about the price not very polite; while it is an offer, which you need<lb/> not mind
                however, as you can at your leisure return the book to<lb/> me, when I will restore
                it to <sic>it</sic> owner, <sic>It</sic> sounded however, like<lb/>
                <persName>Ephron's</persName> disinterestedness, in offering a piece of land for
                nothing<lb/> valued at 400 shekels; thought the present is only the<lb/> percent in
                greenbacks; a great difference truly.</p>
            <p>I hope you may soon succeed in erecting a building of enough dimen<lb/>sions for all
                    <add>blank</add>; since it is a cruelty to leave our<lb/> poor to the mercy of
                Christians who use all the means at their<lb/> command to affect conversions while
                they professedly attend to the<lb/> bodily wants of the sufferers. This has proved
                in <placeName>America</placeName> no<lb/> less than in
                <placeName>Europe</placeName>; and I rejoice therefore at every effort made to<lb/>
                lessen the evil.</p>

                of <persName>Miss G. Aguilar's</persName> Jewish Faith, and hope to complete the
