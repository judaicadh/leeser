				<p>Dear Uncle&#44;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In <persName>Rachel&#39;s</persName> letter to <persName>Abby Iserawles</persName> a few lines&#44; but<lb/> as <persName>Mr. Moses</persName> does not go till tomorrow I have resolved&#44;<lb/> to write a little more in detail on the matter just now engrosses<lb/> rationally a good deal of my attention.

				<p>In all forty four members.  Absent and I believe no longer voters<lb/> <persName>Joseph J. Andrews</persName> <persName>David S. Seixas</persName>&#59; &#38; <persName>Raphael De Cordova</persName>&#59; absent <persName>Jacob De Lange</persName>&#44; and<lb/> <persName>Levi M. Goldsmit</persName>&#44; who if present would be for me&#44; and be certain<lb/> at meeting.  Of those ten put down for <persName>Lyons</persName>&#44; it is possible but<lb/> hardly likely that <persName>Joseph</persName> &#38; <persName>E. L Moss</persName> will not be present&#59; and the<lb/> <persName>Cohens</persName>&#44; altho&#39; they are somewhat bitter against me&#44; may perhaps be<lb/> gained&#44; if <persName>Mr. Gratz</persName> can get a chance of speaking to them after the<lb/> <persName>Lyons</persName> have done all they can.  <persName>Joseph Cohen</persName> is in my favour&#44; but<lb/> <persName>Abraham</persName> has somehow conceived an opinion that I have slighted<lb/> him&#44; but I can freely say&#44; that it is without foundation.  He has<lb/> avoided me for about two years&#44; and I never once saw him even<lb/> at his own house during all this time.  No doubt some persons<lb/> have been busy with him as well as with others&#44; and his about<lb/> such a man&#44; as can be influenced if his pride is flattered.  His<lb/> brothers hardly dare to disobey him&#44; so that if they will not vote<lb/> for <persName>Lyons</persName> they will perhaps stay at home&#44; unless <persName>Miss Gratz</persName><lb/> &#38; her brother&#44; as I have mentioned already can induce them to<lb/> do as <add>they</add> should and would do&#44; were it not for the friendship of<lb/> <persName>Samuel Lyons</persName>.&#8212;Old <persName>Mr. Nathan</persName> is calculated on by them&#44;<lb/> but I hardly think&#44; that he has authorized them to use his name&#59;<lb/> on the contrary his expressions are upon the whole in my favour.<lb/>  <persName>Altamont Phillips</persName> never was for me&#44; altho&#39; to all appearance there<lb/> never was a difference between us.  <persName>Polock</persName> once owed me fifteen<lb/> Dollars for 18 months&#44; and because he had to pay he is angry<lb/> these four years.  <persName>Dreyfous</persName> never was for me&#59; why I never heard.<lb/>  The brothers <persName>Asch</persName> last year were busy to cut my salary down<lb/> and though then at variance with the <persName>Lyons&#39;</persName> have since been<lb/> flattered over.  <persName>Mr. Moss</persName> &#38; his sons all likewise his son in law <persName>D.<lb/> Samuel</persName> &#38; his brother are of course for the family.&#8212;But those on my</p>

				<p>side put down as certain have been uniform supporters except <persName>Jacob<lb/> Phillips</persName> &#38; <persName>Elias Hyneman</persName>&#44; as also <persName>Joseph Phillips</persName> &#38; <persName>I. J. Levy</persName>&#44; who last year<lb/> gave such votes as caused all the present difficulty&#59; if these four<lb/> had supported <persName>Abraham Hart&#39;s</persName> resolution and not been fooled by <persName>Mr<lb/> John Moss</persName> I would have been elected for three years&#44; but <persName>Mr. M.</persName> pro&#45;<lb/>fessing that he never wished to see me out of office&#44; they believed him&#44;<lb/> and were caught in the cunning trap of annual elections&#44; in <add>&#63;</add><lb/> as was said to keep the officers <sic>dependant</sic>&#44; but in truth to make<lb/> room for <persName>Lyons</persName>.  <persName>S. Morais</persName> has been friendly&#44; though I know not whether<lb/> he ever gave a vote for me&#44; I rather think the opposite is the case.<lb/>  <persName>Isaac B. Phillips</persName> never attended meeting&#44; but now he has<lb/> been roused  by the monstrous injustice the <persName>Moss</persName> family intend.<lb/>  <persName>Simon Gratz</persName> likewise was never present at an election these 8<lb/> years&#44; altho&#39; it is said he has now expressed his intention of<lb/> attending.  <persName>David</persName> &#38; <persName>Jack<add>&#63;</add> Nathans</persName>&#44; son of <persName>Isaiah</persName> may perhaps be<lb/> brought to the meeting by <persName>David Pesoa</persName>&#44; as also <persName>Samuel M.<lb/> Salomon</persName>&#44; who is counted on by <persName>Lyons</persName>&#59; <persName>Lewis Allen</persName> I call doubtful<lb/> because he is a brother in law of <persName>Lyons</persName>&#44; and has not said any<lb/> thing from which his intentions can be known.  <persName>Ab. Elkin</persName> never<lb/> goes to meeting and then he cannot be depended upon because<lb/> he speaks fair to all.  <persName>Jacob Gratz</persName> altho&#39; a staunch friend<lb/> has <sic>latterly</sic> almost withdrawn from congregational business &#38; it is<lb/> doubtful whether he will be in town&#44; and if whether his sisters can<lb/> make him go down&#59; yet doubtlessly he will be roused&#44; and if so&#44; he<lb/> will cast a vote in my favour.&#8212;<persName>B. Eylinge<add>&#63;</add></persName> is lame of gout&#44;<lb/> but yet if urged by my friend may go for me&#44; or otherwise for<lb/> <persName>Lyons</persName>&#59; he is like <persName>Elkin</persName> smooth spoken.  <persName>Isaac Moses</persName> &#38; <persName>Isaac<lb/> Hays</persName> never go to meeting&#44; yet <persName>Miss Gratz</persName> may induce them to<lb/> attend for that day.&#8212;<persName>Zaligman Phillips</persName> has never been for me&#44;<lb/> and even if he votes for me&#44; he may do it in such a manner as to<lb/> destroy all good effects from it.  <persName>Aaron Levy</persName> is also very doubtful&#44; altho&#39;</p>
			<pb n="2V"/>
				<p>he is said to have spoken in my favour.  <persName>Reuben Etting</persName> is calculated on for <persName>Lyons</persName>&#44;<lb/> because I would not attend the funeral of his grandchild&#59; yet I believe this<lb/> to be false&#44; as he would hardly so much offend his relatives&#44; who always have<lb/> been kind to him&#59; yet I should think he will not go to meeting.  His son<lb/> <persName>Gratz</persName> you know has been crazy&#44; and if he is even well&#44; it is hardly to be<lb/> supposed that he will dare to expose himself to the existence of a<lb/> public meeting.  I candidly believe that I have given you a fair statement&#44;<lb/> and you will see that <persName>Lyons</persName> will have certain from 8&#45;10&#59; I about 14&#44;<lb/> doubtful when present 19&#59; doubtful whether they will come 10&#59; now if we<lb/> divide these 20 and give him 20&#44; the rest for me 24&#59; it is certainly<lb/> by no means ascertained who will be elected&#59; but if there is a<lb/> full meeting&#44; it is not likely that he can be carried.  The<lb/> only fear is&#44; <sic>a</sic> this meeting&#44; when 12 or 14 determined men<lb/> can do as they please.  But persons have so often publicly said&#44;<lb/> that <persName>Mr. Lyons&#39;</persName> conduct was shameful&#44; that one would suppose<lb/> in reason&#44; that it would unite all&#44; who are in my favour&#59; but time<lb/> only can show.  He may be elected&#59; but if he is&#44; it is by management<lb/> and such tricks as he must be ever ashamed of.&#8212;They have also been<lb/> round to get scholars for him&#44; without asking us&#44; whether it would<lb/> interfere with my interest.&#8212;Last <date>Sunday</date> week I called at <persName>Mr.<lb/> Allen&#39;s</persName> and left word&#44; that if <persName>Mr Lyons</persName> would let me see his certificates<lb/> I would let him read.  The certificates were left in <persName>Mr A&#39;s</persName> hands&#44; never&#45;<lb/>theless they continued running to members&#44; and at length obtained <add>&#63;</add>.<lb/>  Even to <persName>Sol. Moses</persName> they sent <persName>Joseph Moss</persName> &#38; <persName>Isaac Phillips</persName>&#44; not daring<lb/> to go themselves&#59; but he told them&#44; they Tebah belongs to me&#44; and<lb/> alone had the powers to dispose of the prayers.  The signers to the<lb/> petition requesting the Parnass to appoint &#40;whether I would or not&#41; were <persName>I Nathans</persName>&#44;<lb/> <persName>E. L. Cohen</persName>&#44; <persName>F. Samuel</persName>&#44; <persName>Hyman Pollock</persName>&#44; <persName>E. Hyneman</persName>&#44; <persName>A. Elkin</persName>&#44; <persName>Aaron Arch</persName>&#44;<lb/> <persName>B. Eytinger</persName>&#63; I think <persName>Aaron Levy</persName>&#59; but I am not certain.  <persName>Hyneman</persName> &#38; <persName>Nathans</persName><lb/> declared they merely did it to give him a chance&#44; but nothing further.

			<p rend="indent(2)">Dear Sir&#44;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Understanding that the <persName>Rev<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Jacques Judah Lyons</persName>&#44; Hazan of a<lb/> congregation of Israelites in <placeName>Paramaribo&#44; Surinam&#44; Dutch Guiana&#44;<lb/> South America</placeName>&#44; is desirous of reading the Prayers for an entire Sab&#45;<lb/>bath&#44; and you having submitted to my inspection his credentials&#44;<lb/> which prove that he has been Hazan for a space of five years&#44;<lb/> and that his conduct has uniformly been religious&#59; I yield<lb/> cheerfully to him the right of so reading the entire service&#44; I doing<lb/> this however I utterly disclaim the power of the congregation&#44; unless<lb/> by a majority in meeting assembled&#44; of compelling the Hazan for the<lb/> time being&#44; to admit any other person to officiate upon any occasion&#44;<lb/> or for any purpose whatever.  My yielding the right of the <hi rend="underline">Tebah</hi> to<lb/> him is owing to a mere spirit of courtesy&#44; as I could not well<lb/> refuse one who has been in office&#44; to read the service&#44; if he is<lb/> earnestly desirous to do so&#59; although I must at the same time<lb/> express my surprise at the unusual request&#44; especially as no<lb/> communication whatever from the applicant himself has up<lb/> to this moment reached me.  In conversation with sundry<lb/> persons I expressed myself before <persName>Mr. Lyon&#39;s</persName> arrival&#44; that<lb/> if he had been Hazan&#44; I would permit him&#44; to read&#59; I trust<lb/> therefore that my compliance with the Rev<hi rend="sup">d</hi> gentleman&#39;s<lb/> <hi rend="underline">implied</hi> wishes may not be ascribed to motives which I do<lb/> not entertain.
