                <persName>Joseph J. Andrews</persName>
                <persName>David S. Seixas</persName>; &amp; <persName>Raphael De Cordova</persName>;
                absent <persName>Jacob De Lange</persName>, and<lb/>
                <persName>Levi M. Goldsmit</persName>, who if present would be for me, and be
                certain<lb/> at meeting. Of those ten put down for <persName>Lyons</persName>, it is
                possible but<lb/> hardly likely that <persName>Joseph</persName> &amp; <persName>E.
                    L Moss</persName> will not be present; and the<lb/>
                <persName>Cohens</persName>, altho' they are somewhat bitter against me, may perhaps
                be<lb/> gained, if <persName>Mr. Gratz</persName> can get a chance of speaking to
                them after the<lb/>
                <persName>Lyons</persName> have done all they can. <persName>Joseph Cohen</persName>
                is in my favour, but<lb/>
                <persName>Abraham</persName> has somehow conceived an opinion that I have
                slighted<lb/> him, but I can freely say, that it is without foundation. He has<lb/>
                avoided me for about two years, and I never once saw him even<lb/> at his own house
                during all this time. No doubt some persons<lb/> have been busy with him as well as
                with others, and his about<lb/> such a man, as can be influenced if his pride is
                flattered. His<lb/> brothers hardly dare to disobey him, so that if they will not
                vote<lb/> for <persName>Lyons</persName> they will perhaps stay at home, unless
                    <persName>Miss Gratz</persName><lb/> &amp; her brother, as I have mentioned
                already can induce them to<lb/> do as <add>they</add> should and would do, were it
                not for the friendship of<lb/>
                <persName>Samuel Lyons</persName>.—Old <persName>Mr. Nathan</persName> is calculated
                on by them,<lb/> but I hardly think, that he has authorized them to use his
                name;<lb/> on the contrary his expressions are upon the whole in my favour.<lb/>
                <persName>Altamont Phillips</persName> never was for me, altho' to all appearance
                there<lb/> never was a difference between us. <persName>Polock</persName> once owed
                me fifteen<lb/> Dollars for 18 months, and because he had to pay he is angry<lb/>
                these four years. <persName>Dreyfous</persName> never was for me; why I never
                heard.<lb/> The brothers <persName>Asch</persName> last year were busy to cut my
                salary down<lb/> and though then at variance with the <persName>Lyons'</persName>
                have since been<lb/> flattered over. <persName>Mr. Moss</persName> &amp; his sons
                all likewise his son in law <persName>D.<lb/> Samuel</persName> &amp; his brother
                are of course for the family.—But those on my</p>
            <pb n="2R"/>
            <p>side put down as certain have been uniform supporters except <persName>Jacob<lb/>
                    Phillips</persName> &amp; <persName>Elias Hyneman</persName>, as also
                    <persName>Joseph Phillips</persName> &amp; <persName>I. J. Levy</persName>, who
                last year<lb/> gave such votes as caused all the present difficulty; if these
                four<lb/> had supported <persName>Abraham Hart's</persName> resolution and not been
                fooled by <persName>Mr<lb/> John Moss</persName> I would have been elected for three
                years, but <persName>Mr. M.</persName> pro-<lb/>fessing that he never wished to see
                me out of office, they believed him,<lb/> and were caught in the cunning trap of
                annual elections, in <add>?</add><lb/> as was said to keep the officers
                    <sic>dependant</sic>, but in truth to make<lb/> room for
                    <persName>Lyons</persName>. <persName>S. Morais</persName> has been friendly,
                though I know not whether<lb/> he ever gave a vote for me, I rather think the
                opposite is the case.<lb/>
                <persName>Isaac B. Phillips</persName> never attended meeting, but now he has<lb/>
                been roused by the monstrous injustice the <persName>Moss</persName> family intend.<lb/>
                <persName>Simon Gratz</persName> likewise was never present at an election these
                8<lb/> years, altho' it is said he has now expressed his intention of<lb/>
                attending. <persName>David</persName> &amp; <persName>Jack<add>?</add>
                    Nathans</persName>, son of <persName>Isaiah</persName> may perhaps be<lb/>
                brought to the meeting by <persName>David Pesoa</persName>, as also <persName>Samuel
                    M.<lb/> Salomon</persName>, who is counted on by <persName>Lyons</persName>;
                    <persName>Lewis Allen</persName> I call doubtful<lb/> because he is a brother in
                law of <persName>Lyons</persName>, and has not said any<lb/> thing from which his
                intentions can be known. <persName>Ab. Elkin</persName> never<lb/> goes to meeting
                and then he cannot be depended upon because<lb/> he speaks fair to all.
                    <persName>Jacob Gratz</persName> altho' a staunch friend<lb/> has
                    <sic>latterly</sic> almost withdrawn from congregational business &amp; it
                is<lb/> doubtful whether he will be in town, and if whether his sisters can<lb/>
                make him go down; yet doubtlessly he will be roused, and if so, he<lb/> will cast a
                vote in my favour.—<persName>B. Eylinge<add>?</add></persName> is lame of gout,<lb/>
                but yet if urged by my friend may go for me, or otherwise for<lb/>
                <persName>Lyons</persName>; he is like <persName>Elkin</persName> smooth spoken.
                    <persName>Isaac Moses</persName> &amp; <persName>Isaac<lb/> Hays</persName>
                never go to meeting, yet <persName>Miss Gratz</persName> may induce them to<lb/>
                attend for that day.—<persName>Zaligman Phillips</persName> has never been for
                me,<lb/> and even if he votes for me, he may do it in such a manner as to<lb/>
                destroy all good effects from it. <persName>Aaron Levy</persName> is also very
                doubtful, altho'</p>
            <pb n="2V"/>
            <p>he is said to have spoken in my favour. <persName>Reuben Etting</persName> is
                calculated on for <persName>Lyons</persName>,<lb/> because I would not attend the
                funeral of his grandchild; yet I believe this<lb/> to be false, as he would hardly
                so much offend his relatives, who always have<lb/> been kind to him; yet I should
                think he will not go to meeting. His son<lb/>
                <persName>Gratz</persName> you know has been crazy, and if he is even well, it is
                hardly to be<lb/> supposed that he will dare to expose himself to the existence of
                a<lb/> public meeting. I candidly believe that I have given you a fair
                statement,<lb/> and you will see that <persName>Lyons</persName> will have certain
                from 8-10; I about 14,<lb/> doubtful when present 19; doubtful whether they will
                come 10; now if we<lb/> divide these 20 and give him 20, the rest for me 24; it is
                certainly<lb/> by no means ascertained who will be elected; but if there is a<lb/>
                full meeting, it is not likely that he can be carried. The<lb/> only fear is,
                    <sic>a</sic> this meeting, when 12 or 14 determined men<lb/> can do as they
                please. But persons have so often publicly said,<lb/> that <persName>Mr.
                    Lyons'</persName> conduct was shameful, that one would suppose<lb/> in reason,
                that it would unite all, who are in my favour; but time<lb/> only can show. He may
                be elected; but if he is, it is by management<lb/> and such tricks as he must be
                ever ashamed of.—They have also been<lb/> round to get scholars for him, without
                asking us, whether it would<lb/> interfere with my interest.—Last
                    <date>Sunday</date> week I called at <persName>Mr.<lb/> Allen's</persName> and
                left word, that if <persName>Mr Lyons</persName> would let me see his
                certificates<lb/> I would let him read. The certificates were left in <persName>Mr
                    A's</persName> hands, never-<lb/>theless they continued running to members, and
                at length obtained <add>?</add>.<lb/> Even to <persName>Sol. Moses</persName> they
                sent <persName>Joseph Moss</persName> &amp; <persName>Isaac Phillips</persName>, not
                daring<lb/> to go themselves; but he told them, they Tebah belongs to me, and<lb/>
                alone had the powers to dispose of the prayers. The signers to the<lb/> petition
                requesting the Parnass to appoint (whether I would or not) were <persName>I
                    Nathans</persName>,<lb/>
                <persName>E. L. Cohen</persName>, <persName>F. Samuel</persName>, <persName>Hyman
                    Pollock</persName>, <persName>E. Hyneman</persName>, <persName>A.
                    Elkin</persName>, <persName>Aaron Arch</persName>,<lb/>
                <persName>B. Eytinger</persName>? I think <persName>Aaron Levy</persName>; but I am
                not certain. <persName>Hyneman</persName> &amp; <persName>Nathans</persName><lb/>
                declared they merely did it to give him a chance, but nothing further. He read<lb/>

            <p rend="indent(1)">Understanding that the <persName>Rev<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Jacques
                    Judah Lyons</persName>, Hazan of a<lb/> congregation of Israelites in
                    <placeName>Paramaribo, Surinam, Dutch Guiana,<lb/> South America</placeName>, is
                desirous of reading the Prayers for an entire Sab-<lb/>bath, and you having
                submitted to my inspection his credentials,<lb/> which prove that he has been Hazan
                for a space of five years,<lb/> and that his conduct has uniformly been religious; I
                yield<lb/> cheerfully to him the right of so reading the entire service, I
                doing<lb/> this however I utterly disclaim the power of the congregation,
                unless<lb/> by a majority in meeting assembled, of compelling the Hazan for the<lb/>
                time being, to admit any other person to officiate upon any occasion,<lb/> or for
                any purpose whatever. My yielding the right of the <hi rend="underline">Tebah</hi>
                to<lb/> him is owing to a mere spirit of courtesy, as I could not well<lb/> refuse
                one who has been in office, to read the service, if he is<lb/> earnestly desirous to
                do so; although I must at the same time<lb/> express my surprise at the unusual
                request, especially as no<lb/> communication whatever from the applicant himself has
                up<lb/> to this moment reached me. In conversation with sundry<lb/> persons I
                expressed myself before <persName>Mr. Lyon's</persName> arrival, that<lb/> if he had
                been Hazan, I would permit him, to read; I trust<lb/> therefore that my compliance
                with the Rev<hi rend="sup">d</hi> gentleman's<lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">implied</hi> wishes may not be ascribed to motives which I
