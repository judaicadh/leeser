            </p>
            <p rend="indent(2)">Dear Sir</p>
            <p rend="indent(3)">I have been quite unable to answer<lb/> your favor of <date>12<hi
                        rend="sup">th</hi></date> inst until now, having had so<lb/> many calls upon
                my leisure—not the least pleasant<lb/> of which was the arrival here of my brother from<lb/>
                <placeName>London</placeName>.Your reply with reference to the publishing<lb/> of
                school books is certainly satisfactory so far as<lb/> your willingness to unite with
                me in the undertaking<lb/> is concerned, but permit me to say it is less so
                with<lb/> reference to other points. You say when you have<lb/> returned from your
                collecting tour you will be able<lb/> to speak more positively as to what can be
                done in<lb/> the matter of printing school books; Am I to<lb/> understand that your
                willingness to go on<lb/> depends upon your success in collecting? Please<lb/>
                recollect in the matter of <persName>Templo's</persName> Grammar that<lb/> it is not
                pleasant for me to appear laboring so<lb/> many months in advertisement to produce a<lb/>
                <persName><hi rend="underline">Leão</hi> (Templo)</persName> and yet not even
                producing a mouse<lb/> nor, perhaps, would it be quite right to withdraw<lb/> my
                advt unless I announced there would certainly<lb/> appear jointly that book or one similar—whether<lb/>
                <persName>Leesers</persName> or <persName>Templo's</persName> would not much matter
                so<lb/> that we had the one best adapted for schools<lb/> that at least one person
                expects the book Templo</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>and has paid for it the enclosed will testify.<lb/> Please return me <persName>Mr
                    Alexander's</persName> letter in your<lb/> next favor. Do you know him?</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I would beg to ask you one question, do<lb/> you object to increase
                “the burthen under which<lb/> you stagger” by “going halves” as the school boys<lb/>
                say in producing <hi rend="underline">only</hi>
                <persName>Templos</persName> book or a<lb/> Hebrew Grammar. Without involving either
                of us<lb/> to any large amount we show that we are in the full with <hi
                    rend="underline">the right article</hi> and we shall<lb/> have made a
                commencement. I do not say we should<lb/> print before you return “about
                    <date>Purim</date> time”<lb/> but I do think that before you commence your<lb/>
                trip I would find it very acceptable were the<lb/> public notified of a contemplated
                joint publica<lb/> of a Heb. Gram. as a positive thing; and as a thing<lb/> not so
                positive, but dependent upon the support<lb/> they extend to the plan—inform them of
                the<lb/> projected issue of the other books named. A<lb/> comprehensive good Hebrew
                Grammar is unquestionably<lb/> wanted—we have
                    <persName>Nerurtz's<add>?</add></persName> but it is too<lb/> large and
                expensive, <persName>Newmans</persName> is too <sic>meagre</sic><lb/> and too badly
                arranged, all others in the English<lb/> language by Jews or Christians for
                Jewish<lb/> schools are in my estimation worth <hi rend="underline">nichts</hi><lb/>
                I have no fear that any of the books I before<lb/> referred to will not make their
                way &amp; expenses<lb/> support before hand I do not like to solicit. I<lb/> would
                therefore much like to hear that you</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>are disposed to make announcement in your next<lb/> Occ. that out we will come
                    <del>and</del> that I may be<lb/> enabled to withdraw my advertisement from
                the<lb/> Asmonean &amp; supply #c notification of <persName>Templo's</persName>
                appear-<lb/>ance under altered circumstances. You say you<lb/> do not know the
                books. I could send it you on by express<lb/> to look at. It requires a little
                alteration of arrangement<lb/> and will make about <hi rend="underline">70
                    pages</hi>
                <add>?</add>. I think it<lb/> a good book so do many others, my brother among
                them<lb/>—but I would of course like your opinion.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I am sorry you were not here <add>Hebrew</add>. I should be<lb/>
                much pleased if next year, <persName>D. L.</persName> you extend your<lb/> visit and
                come to us. I should be very glad to hear<lb/> you read what portion of the prayers
                you prefer<lb/> while in exchange I could myself stand <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> as
                said the <add>?</add> lingue of our friend. What I can<lb/> do for your Bibles
                defence I will. I don't know<lb/> why the Oc. comes late, but it comes late.
                    <persName>Mrs<lb/> S<add>?</add> Joseph</persName> is sullen<add>?</add> and I
                believe proposes taking<lb/> a trip south. The prayer books being too late<lb/> I
                can be explained by the party's altering his mind<lb/> that a set cost “viel geld”
                and a secondhand one<lb/> could be got cheaper—hence the excuse “too late<lb/> when
                    <add>Hebrew</add> was only a week off and no books<lb/> had arrived. It is not
                the first time <add>?</add> have<lb/> changed their minds after ordering my
                fathers'.<lb/> I must close though I have more to write<lb/> Hoping to hear soon
                from you I am</p>
