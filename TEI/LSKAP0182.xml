            <p>Dear Uncle.</p>
            <p rend="indent(2)">It is with a good deal of mortification that I write to you<lb/>
                about a new difficulty that has occurred between me and the congregation.<lb/> You
                know that at the last meeting I was elected for three years at a<lb/> salary of
                eight hundred Dollars. I at once objected to the salary, and so<lb/> stated to the
                committee; and was perfectly satisfied to have the<lb/> matter rest for a year at
                least. Now however, as you will see<lb/> by the constitution which I send, there is
                a law 27, page 23<add>?</add>, which<lb/> demands a bond for the faithful
                performance of the duty of office.<lb/> When the thing was first mentioned I at once
                refused signing<lb/> a bond for three years; and asked it as a great favour to let
                the<lb/> matter rest. But the Parnass was urged by some persons, and on<lb/>
                <date>Thursday</date> two weeks ago he put a paper in my hand which contains<lb/> as
                one stipulation that I should stay of three years, and that<lb/> the congregation
                should pay eight hundred Dollars in full, at the<lb/> regular quarter day, each
                under a penalty of $500. He wanted an<lb/> answer at once by <date>Friday</date> to
                lay it before the board on <date>Sunday</date>; of course<lb/> the time was too
                short to consult with you, and I accordingly upon<lb/> my own thoughts of what
                    <add>is</add> correct and proper refused to sign for<lb/> more than one year,
                till I were sure that the congregation would not<lb/> consent to give my usual
                salary, upon which by the by no vote was<lb/> taken, as the question only occurred
                on $800, the confusion being so great<lb/> that every thing went on rather
                curiously. At the meeting of the<lb/> Board this day two weeks, <persName>Mr.
                    Hackenburg</persName> proposed to let the<lb/> matter rest for one year, but
                    <persName>Mrssrs Allen</persName>, <persName>J. A. Phillips</persName> &amp;
                    <persName>A. Hart</persName><lb/> refused, and it was determined to call a
                meeting on this day two weeks.<lb/> Since then <persName>Mr. Gratz</persName>,
                    <persName>Mr. Israel</persName>, <persName>Mr. Allen</persName>, <persName>Mr.
                    Hart</persName> and<lb/>
                <persName>Mrs Gratz</persName> have been urging me to sign the bond, and all
                acknowledge<lb/> that it is unjust to reduce the salary. There are those in the
                congrega_</p>
            <pb n="1V"/>
            <p>tion who would move to let the election aside, in case it were understood I refused
                accept_<lb/>ing the terms. There is a great objection in the minds of my friends to have<lb/>
                <persName>Lyons</persName> elected, and they say, that it is nevertheless probable
                that he would<lb/> succeed. They appeal to me, whether I would consent to see him
                unworthy<lb/> as him in office, and whether my character would not be subject
                to<lb/> an inadversion<add>?</add> if for the sake of maintaining my own opinion
                or<lb/> even positive declaration, I should refuse acceding to the wishes of my<lb/>
                friends. Further <persName>Mr. Gratz</persName> just now said that he would bring
                the<lb/> business again before the congregation at their next meeting.<lb/> These
                are all the principal features of the case. My own opinion<lb/> is decidedly opposed
                to my pledging myself to stay with the congregation,<lb/> as they have done so much
                to mortify me; secondly; tis almost<lb/> yielding my entire independence; thirdly it
                is an act of injustice,<lb/> and it is certainly not reasonable to exact my
                    <add>?</add> thereto.<lb/> However the whole subject has caused me a great deal
                of painful<lb/> excitement and care and thought. As I said my own opinion is
                unchanged<lb/> which I expressed to <persName>Simha</persName> the last time we went
                up to St<add>?</add>
                <persName>Emanuels</persName><lb/> of which she can tell you. Yet I now defer to
                you, and refer the whole<lb/> to your judgment, and as you command, so I shall obey.
                If you think my<lb/> opinion right, and that I ought not to yield, I shall refuse;
                but if you<lb/> desire my stay, I shall then sign the paper and send it to
                    <persName>Mr<lb/> Allen</persName> without any further remark.__Answer this
                therefore<lb/> at once as soon as you get it, and put the letter in the post office
                before<lb/> it closes. However think well, and reflect that upon your advice<lb/>
                the happiness or unhappiness of my future life may depend. According<lb/> my view of
                the question I can lose nothing by leaving <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>,<lb/>
                for the congregation who cannot treat me properly after an acquaintance<lb/> of 8
                years deserve not to have me.</p>
