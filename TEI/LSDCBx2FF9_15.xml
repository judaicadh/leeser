				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>San Francisco</placeName> <date>June 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1862</date></p>
				<p><addressee>Revd Isaac Leeser</addressee></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Dr Sir</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">You must not think me<lb/> neglectful in not having written to you before<lb/> this.  Many things at times prevent me from <lb/>writing at the time and then it passes over.<lb/>  No doubt ere this you have received a Letter<lb/> from <persName>Mr Myers</persName> and with it the receipt signed<lb/> by me of the Books he placed in my possession<lb/> on sale for you.  I shall try and do my best<lb/> to dispose of them for you.  The prices here are<lb/> too high there are so few buyers&#44; please let<lb/> me know positively the lowest price at which<lb/> I may sell&#44; so that I can act safely and I<lb/> will do all I can.  I hope you received my<lb/> parcel by <persName>Rabbi Nissan</persName> if you can send me<lb/> any more of the Back Nos for which I wrote<lb/> you will oblige me&#44; at the same time have<lb/> you any whole <hi rend="underline">Nos</hi> as 1&#45;2&#45;3&#45;4&#45;5&#45;6&#45;7&#45;8<lb/> I have none of these Vols. I should like to have<lb/> them either bound or unbound I shall then<lb/> be the only <hi rend="underline">one</hi> in the <placeName>Pacific Coast</placeName> who will<lb/> have a regular file of them.  Of course I will</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>pay for them.  Please let me know what I<lb/> owe you up to the present&#44; and I will hand<lb/> it to <persName>Mr Myers</persName> to whom I have spoken on<lb/> the subject.  Religious matters here are of<lb/> no importance&#44; all is quiet.  Your <date>April</date> <hi rend="underline">No</hi><lb/> caused a great consternation among a certain<lb/> class who were delighted to find that these acts<lb/> were made known to the world&#44; altho&#39; they are<lb/> not able to prevent them of course the Gleaner<lb/> has its supporters as there are so many<lb/> who will do wrong in spite of every thing<lb/> you will no doubt see how the Gleaner<lb/> answers for itself.  Not one thing satisfactory<lb/> because as you know <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> still we must do our duty.  The Letter<lb/> which he inserts is from one of the ladies<lb/> whom I refused to marry.  I have no<lb/> doubt that the Gleaner managed this<lb/> matter to be <add>&#63;</add> <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> but the truth was not stated therein and<lb/> if even all was true&#44; what right had<lb/> <persName>Dr Eckman</persName> to marry her.  He certainly does<lb/> not think I am greater than he is to act<lb/> in opposition to a Law because I or<lb/> any man ventures an opinion&#44; which you<lb/> yourself can see how he shirks the question.</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>Many here surmise that I inform you of<lb/> all that passes&#8212;but I do not wish my name<lb/> to appear for many reasons&#8212;especially as<lb/> some of my members and other of the <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> are friends to the Gleaner&#44; and have pity on the poor old man as they call him x<lb/> that encourages him in all his doings&#8212;<lb/> I shall still inform you of all that passes<lb/> because I do think that ultimately by so<lb/> doing we shall in time affect some good<lb/>  In the pulpit I speak of these things fearlessly<lb/> I will send you a sermon I preached on<lb/> the <date>1<hi rend="sup">st</hi></date> day <add>Hebrew</add> by which you will see<lb/> that I do as I say and act upon the principle<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>.  <persName>Eckman</persName> does all he can to<lb/> injure me in the minds of the people as<lb/> my Election is only from year to year but<lb/> I tell my folks that my <add>Hebrew</add> is in God x<lb/> not in man&#44; even the Reformers hold<lb/> me in respect altho&#39; I tell them of their<lb/> wrongs.  <sic>even</sic> <persName>Dr Cohn</persName> will not do such<lb/> things as these men do.  He works hard with<lb/> me to get the people to keep <add>Hebrew</add> .  I have<lb/> succeeded in one or two instances and I hope<lb/> in time we shall do more&#8212;but it is very difficult<lb/> the Dollars &#38; cents are the main thing with<lb/> our people here&#8212;still we must do our duty</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>I must give you Credit for the very able<lb/> note you appended to the article &#38;<lb/> I can assure you that all the <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> here were pleased with it in the<lb/> hope that we may be <add>Hebrew</add></p>
				<p rend="align(center)"><add>Hebrew</add></p>
				<p>some people here think that we should not<lb/> publish such matters as it brings us into<lb/> disrepute before the world and exposes<lb/> our religion to ridicule&#44; they say better let<lb/> us chose between the two evils&#44; and they<lb/> think that the &#8220;<hi rend="underline">wrong doings</hi>&#8221; is the lesser<lb/> evil.  I tell them plainly I differ from<lb/> them entirely upon the principle</p>
				<p rend="align(center)">&#8220;<add>Hebrew</add>&#8221;</p>
				<p>and I feel assured that you think with<lb/> me in this respect and I should be pleased<lb/> if you think well of it to publish your<lb/> sentiments on the subject I will keep<lb/> you posted on all matters of any interest<lb/> Both congregations were well attended in<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>.  I am told that <persName>Dr Cohn</persName> delivered a<lb/> very impressive sermon in confirming a<lb/> number of Boys and Girls upon the new System<lb/> in the Reform World.  My sermon I will send<lb/> you and judge for yourself my folks were very much<lb/> pleased.  We had a Boy <add>Hebrew</add> on the <date>2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi></date> day of</p>
			<pb n="5"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">&#47;5</p>
				<p><add>Hebrew</add>.  And read the <add>Hebrew</add> in the<lb/> old Orthodox Style to a crowded auditory<lb/> which gave great satisfaction.  I still and<lb/> will adhere to our good old times and<lb/> will suffer no innovation&#44; and I am happy<lb/> to say that with few exceptions my <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> support me in this respect&#44; altho&#39; at<lb/> times I have to go into the Battle field<lb/> but I will and do not flinch.  The Gleaner<lb/> being the only Jewish Organ here sometimes<lb/> rouses up one or two who go abroad<lb/> and say this is old and out of tune and<lb/> that causes mischief.  I heed them not<lb/> and when I reason with them they are<lb/> silenced.  I am so far fortunate that the<lb/> Board of Trustees tho&#39; individually not<lb/> very ultra Orthodox yet they will not allow<lb/> any one to interfere with me in the synagogue<lb/> service&#44; at the head of them is our <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> an Englishman who has held office for<lb/> many years who is really a stanch <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> and who never neglects to be in<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> whenever service is performed<lb/> our <add>Hebrew</add> is opened every <add>Hebrew</add> and<lb/> three times an <add>Hebrew</add> and there you find<lb/> the <add>Hebrew</add> at his port and this has a</p>
			<pb n="6"/>
				<p>powerful influence with the congregation<lb/> in general when they see the President<lb/> setting the good example the old adage<lb/> &#8220;<add>Hebrew</add>&#8221;<lb/>  The charitable Institutions among us<lb/> are flourishing and do much good<lb/> the people are certainly ready at all times<lb/> to dispense charity and that too liberally.<lb/>  I believe now my dear sir I have<lb/> exhausted all my sources of information<lb/> and I hope I have not exhausted<lb/> your patience to read my long epistle<lb/> but I suppose you are like me at<lb/> times glad to get something fresh from<lb/> abroad however trifling</p>
				<p>I leave you now in the hope that<lb/> this will reach you in health of mind<lb/> and Body and expect to hear from<lb/> you soon</p>
