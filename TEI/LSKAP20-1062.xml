            <p>Gentlemen: I have the honor, herewith, to acknow-<lb/>ledge the receipt of your
                esteemed favor of the<lb/>
                <date>6<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi> of Shevat</date>, Ult.; and,
                whilst thanking you<lb/> for the confidence you have been pleased to<lb/> repose in
                me, I can not refrain from expressing<lb/> my deep appreciation of the firm
                attachment<lb/> to our most ancient law, so nobly evinced in<lb/> your above
                mentioned communication. In com_<lb/>pliance with your wishes, I shall forthwith
                pro_<lb/>ceed to enter at some length into the question,<lb/> for the clear
                development of which, it will<lb/> be requisite to direct your attention to the<lb/>
                three undermentioned principles:</p>
            <p>I. Our religion enjoins most strictly the<lb/> necessity of burying the dead in a <hi
                    rend="underline">respectful</hi><lb/> manner.</p>
            <p>II Our Religion teaches that a certain degree<lb/> of sanctity be attached to the
                lifeless remains</p>
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p rend="align(right)">4</p>
            <p>of a human body; and</p>
            <p>III As a natural consequence of these two<lb/> principles, our religion forbids every
                kind<lb/> of maiming and desecration of the dead.</p>
            <p>I. ˶Our religion enjoins the necessity of burying<lb/> the dead in a respectful
                manner." This may<lb/> be proved from the following facts:</p>
            <p>1. Throughout the Bible, the burial of historical<lb/> characters is specially
                recorded.</p>
            <p>2. The want of burial is considered as a terrible<lb/> calamity.
                    (<persName>Isaiah</persName> XIV 19.20; Psalms LXXIX 3;<lb/> Ecclesiastes VI
                3.)</p>
            <p>3. Decent burial is sufficiently important to<lb/> be promised as a reward for good
                actions<lb/> (1 Kings XIV 13.)</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The oral law likewise repeatedly dwells on<lb/> the great necessity
                of decent interment, de-<lb/>clares that the burial of an exposed corpse<lb/>
                supersedes all other precepts, and considers<lb/> every person engaged in burial, as
                being en-<lb/>gaged in a most important duty.</p>
            <pb n="6"/>
            <p rend="align(right)">5</p>
            <p>Although both the Bible and oral law speak<lb/> of burning, in <sic>connexion</sic>
                with deceased kings,<lb/> yet that burning does not refer to the corpse,<lb/> which
                was uniformly buried, but to valuable<lb/> articles which were burnt in honor of the
                dead.<lb/> That this is the true meaning, may be proved<lb/> from the
                considerations:</p>
            <p>1. Both in the Bible and in the oral law the word <add>שרף</add>,<lb/> when used in
                reference to the above mentioned custom,<lb/> is never followed by the accusative
                sign <add>את</add>, but<lb/> by the particles <add>על</add> or <add>ל</add> denoting
                "concerning"<lb/> "for" (vide <persName>Jeremiah</persName> XXXIV, 5; 2 Chronicles
                XVI. 14,<lb/> ibid. xxi 19; Talmud Abodah Zorah, fol. 11., Joreh-<lb/>Deah, cap.
                348).</p>
            <p>2, The Talmud (ibid.) and Joreh-Deah (ibid.) express-<lb/>ly mention <hi
                    rend="underline">what</hi>
                <hi rend="underline">articles</hi> were burnt.</p>
            <p>3, The matter is, however, put beyond doubt by this<lb/> verse, (2 Chronicles xvi 14)
                ˶and they buried him in<lb/> his own sepulchre;....and they made a very<lb/> great
                burning for him" This needs no farther<lb/> comment.</p>
            <pb n="7"/>
            <p rend="align(right)">6.</p>
            <p>II ˶Our religion teaches that a certain degree<lb/> of sanctity be attached to the
                lifeless remains<lb/> of a human body˶ The proofs of this are:—</p>
            <p>1. The Divine command not to permit the corpse,<lb/> even of <del>the</del> a
                criminal, to be exposed over night.</p>
            <p>2 The wish which was expressed to be buried close<lb/> to a prophet. (1. Kings XIII.
                28-31.)</p>
            <p>3. The restoration to life of the corpse which touched<lb/> the body of
                    <persName>Elisha</persName> (2 Kings XIII. 21.)</p>
            <p>4 The great reverence felt towards the burying<lb/> place of ancestors.
                    (<persName>Nehem.</persName> II. 3-5.)</p>
            <p>The oral law also forbids delay in burial,<lb/> unless it be fore the purpose of
                preparing a<lb/> more dignified funeral; and strictly commands<lb/> that the funeral
                should be solemnized with be-<lb/>coming marks of respect to the Departed.
                (Vide<lb/> Moed Katan, fol. 27; Joreh Deah, cap. 343.</p>
            <p>III ˶As a natural consequence of these two prin-<lb/>ciples, our religion forbids
                every kind of maiming,<lb/> and of Desecration of the dead."</p>
            <p>The desecration thus prohibited is of three kinds:—</p>
            <pb n="8"/>
            <p rend="align(right)">7</p>
            <p>1<hi rend="underline">st</hi> The appropriation of any portion of the corpse for<lb/>
                purposes of gain, or private use of any kind. This is<lb/> prohibited, Yaddim IV. 6;

                Yorah Deah, Chap. 349.</p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> Disinterment likewise prohibited. Baba Bathrah,<lb/> fol.
                154; Abel Rabbathi, IV. 12; Joreh-Deah cap. 363;<lb/> Chosen-Mishpat, cap. 235,
                §13.</p>
            <p>3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> Post mortem examinations, also prohibited<lb/> (Chulin fol.
                    11.<hi rend="underline">b</hi>;-Joreh-Deah, cap. 403, §6.) except<lb/> in cases
                wherein the life of a human being depends<lb/> on such examination; as, for
                instance, when anyone<lb/> is accused of having murdered the deceased, and<lb/> a
                post mortem examination is required for the purpose<lb/> of investigating the
                charge, or when the nature of<lb/> the disease is unknown, and there is another
                patient<lb/> affected with the same malady,—then a post mortem<lb/> examination is
                permitted, in order to save the life of<lb/> the survivor: these however, are only
                the rare exceptions.<lb/> But as a general rule, post mortem examinations
                    <sic>is</sic> con-<lb/>sidered by our law as desecration, and prohibited.<lb/>
                It may be urged, on the other side, that the progress</p>
            <pb n="9"/>
            <p rend="align(right)">8</p>
            <p>of medical science renders a certain amount<lb/> of post mortem examination
                unavoidable; but to<lb/> this I reply, that since such treatment of the
                Decea-<lb/>sed is a desecration, it can only be permitted in<lb/> cases of extreme
                necessity; and even if some<lb/> exceptions must be made, the poor ought not to<lb/>
                be the victims. You would surely not embitter<lb/> the sweetness of charity by such
                hardship, and not<lb/> allow that the feelings of the poor man, when<lb/> necessity
                compels him to seek shelter in your<lb/> Hospital, be harrowed on his death bed by
                knowing<lb/> that he must pay, even with his body, for the hos-<lb/>pitality of your
                roof; and it is hardly necessary<lb/> to describe to you the agonizing pangs of the
                near<lb/> relatives, who can not protect their dear departed<lb/> ones from that
                desecration which they view with the<lb/> greatest horror. Thus humanity forbids us
                from<lb/> making an exception in cases of the poor; and<lb/> you know that the oral
                law, in several places,<lb/> enjoins that, in our treatment of the Dead, we<lb/>
                ought to make no distinction whatever between</p>
            <pb n="10"/>
            <p rend="align(right)">9.</p>
            <p>the rich and the poor. The only exceptions which<lb/> either reason or humanity can
                admit, are crimi-<lb/>nals who had committed high crimes.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">From the above, I trust that it will be clear<lb/> to you, that
                religion and humanity unite also here<lb/> in declaring that post mortem

                present inquiry, I would<lb/> simply ask: ˶Does the mosaic Religion in-<lb/>terdict
                such examinations?˶ In a communica-<lb/>tion, lately received from the
                    <persName>Chief Rabbi Adler</persName>,<lb/> of <placeName>London</placeName>,
                are arguments which, with due defer<lb/>ence to so learned an authority, I
                cannot<lb/> admit; and I would like to have stronger<lb/> reasons and proofs
                adduced, before acknow-<lb/>ledging that our religion prohibits an
                in-<lb/>vestigation, which is purely for the benefit of<lb/> the human race.</p>
            <p>The Rev. gentleman commences by laying<lb/> down three principles or propositions</p>
            <pb n="12"/>
            <p rend="align(right)">11.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="underline">first</hi> that ˶Our Religion enjoins burial of the
                dead<lb/> in a respectful manner;˶ to this I fully assent.<lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">Second</hi>, That ˶our religion attaches a certain degree<lb/>
                of sanctity to the lifeless remains of a human body;<lb/> for argument's sake let
                this be allowed. And, as a<lb/> natural consequence of these two principles we<lb/>
                may admit the deduction that our religion forbids<lb/> every kind of <hi
                    rend="underline">desecration</hi> of the dead. But I<lb/> cannot concede that
                the dead can be maimed,<lb/> or that a post mortem examination is either<lb/> a
                maiming or a desecration of the dead, any<lb/> more than a surgical operation is a
                desecration<lb/> of the living. In the former case, the intention<lb/> is to benefit
                millions living, and yet to live;<lb/> in the latter, the primary object is
                individual<lb/> good only. The revd. Dr. endeavors to prove<lb/> that a degree of
                sanctity is <sic>attaches</sic> to the<lb/> remains of a human body, and cites a
                few<lb/> incidents from the scriptures to establish it;<lb/> but if they are the
                strongest that can be ad-<lb/>duced, I think the second principle is not so</p>
            <pb n="13"/>
            <p rend="align(right)">12.</p>
            <p>clearly proved, i. e. of there being a degree of<lb/> sanctity (i. e. holiness and
                purity) attached, etc<lb/> as for the wish to be buried close to a Prophet,<lb/> (1.
                Kings, XIII 28-31.) the desire was not expressed<lb/> because it was "<hi
                    rend="underline">a dead body</hi>", but on account<lb/> of the sanctity
                (holiness and purity) attached<lb/> to the <hi rend="underline">character</hi> of
                the Prophet. Regarding the resto-<lb/>ration to life of the corpse which touched the
                body<lb/> of <persName>Elisha</persName>, (2 Kings XIII.21) I can not perceive<lb/>
                how, or in what manner, that miracle signifies<lb/> a degree of sanctity attached to
                human remains<lb/> generally. It appears to me, as though the fact<lb/> of his being
                a Prophet, only, produced the miracle,<lb/> unless it be claimed that <hi
                    rend="underline">any other body</hi> would<lb/> have caused the same.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The doctor for this informs us what is considered<lb/> desecration.
                First, the appropriation of any portion<lb/> of the corpse for purposes of gain, or
                private use;<lb/> in this I fully concur. As to disinterment, I beg<lb/> to differ
                with the learned gentleman, and the author,<lb/>ities he cites. There are numerous
                circumstances under</p>
            <pb n="14"/>
            <p rend="align(right)">13.</p>
            <p>which disinterment is the reverse of desecration;<lb/> but as this is irrelevant at
                present to the point<lb/> at issue, I will not farther pursue it.</p>
            <p>I have always believed that what was not for-<lb/>bidden in the laws of
                    <persName>Moses</persName> we might do, provided<lb/> such things were not
                against reason or nature;<lb/> and farther that the spirit of those Laws make<lb/>
                it an imperative duty, to do that which will<lb/> benefit our fellow-creatures; and
                it cannot<lb/> be denied that post mortem examinations are<lb/> made with that
                humane end in view. But the<lb/> exceptions in the Doctors communication would<lb/>
                limit post mortem investigation to the examination<lb/> only of a person suspected
                to have been killed by<lb/> foul means. For, as to the exception made, when<lb/> the
                    <hi rend="underline">nature</hi> of a disease is <hi rend="underline"

            <p>My dear friend! About four years have elapsed<lb/> since I enjoyed the pleasure of a
                literary<lb/> communication from you. I received no direct<lb/> news from you, and
                was satisfied to learn from<lb/> other sources of your well-being. I exclaimed<lb/>
                with <persName>cicero</persName>, si vales, bene est, ego valeo. But<lb/> meeting
                with one of your productions in the<lb/> Asmonean, a <del>fiew</del> few weeks ago,
                engaged as<lb/> you are, in a controversy on an important<lb/> question, I resolved
                to break my silence and<lb/> to address these lines to you.</p>
            <p>I perfectly agree with you, my dear friend, in<lb/> the opinion that <hi
                    rend="underline">Dissection</hi> is by no means<lb/> contrary to our oral law;
                nay, I do even<lb/> maintain that our sages and ancient teachers<lb/>
                <sic>practised</sic> themselves anatomical investigations.<lb/> For, how could they
                otherwise have <sic>aquired</sic> that<lb/> knowledge of the structure of the human
                frame<lb/> which they so frequently display in the Talmud<lb/> and Zohar? How else

            <p>so positively that the human body consists of 248<lb/> members in contradiction to
                the wise men of other<lb/> nations, some of whom assert that their number<lb/> is
                only 245, while others count 249, others 256,<lb/> and some even 266 members?</p>
            <p>I will now cite, for the satisfaction of your oppo-<lb/>nent, several passages from
                the Talmud and Zohar,<lb/> and then ask him how our sages could speak<lb/>
                scientifically of a thing of which they could have<lb/> no idea, how they could
                infer one proposition from<lb/> another, if they were not allowed to convince
                themselves<lb/> of the correctness of their inferences? How could<lb/> they, for

            <p>We find also mentioned in the Talmud several<lb/> surgical operations and

                requested to be informed through the<lb/> ISRAELITE whether the Jewish Law<lb/>
                prohibits a post mortem dissection for<lb/> the purpose of a medical
                investigation.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">This question was occasioned by an<lb/> occurrence in a hospital
                where a Jewish<lb/> man died of a peculiar kidney dis-<lb/>ease the nature of which
                the physi-<lb/>cians were anxious to ascertain by an<lb/> autopsy. To this, however,
                the rela-<lb/>tives strongly objected stating that<lb/> the Jewish religion
                prohibits any mu-<lb/>tilation of the dead body of a human<lb/> being.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">In answer, I would say that a want-<lb/>on mutilation of a human
                body would<lb/> certainly be against the spirit of the<lb/> Jewish law which
                ordained that even<lb/> the corpse of the executed criminal<lb/> shall be protected
                against a disgrace-<lb/>ful exhibition (Deut. xxi, 23). But<lb/> whether it is
                permitted or prohibited<lb/> to perform a dissection of the dead<lb/> for the
                purpose of ascertaining the<lb/> cause, seat or nature of a disease—such<lb/> a
                question was entirely foreign to the<lb/> Biblical antiquity. In the Book of<lb/>
                Judges xix, 29, the dissection of the<lb/> dead body of an outraged woman is<lb/>
                mentioned, but this was for a different<lb/> purpose and concerned an
                extraordi-<lb/>nary case from which no conclusions<lb/> can be made for the question
                before us</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">That dissections of corpses were per-<lb/>formed in an early time of
                the rabbi-<lb/>nical period is evident from the con-<lb/>siderable anatomical
                knowledge which<lb/> the Mishna teachers displayed in stat-<lb/>ing almost exactly
                the number of<lb/> bones and of sinews in the human<lb/> body and in each of its

                corpse of an execut-<lb/>ed criminal, for the purpose of an<lb/> anatomical
                investigation. A Jewish<lb/> physician by name <persName>Theodosius</persName>

                so<lb/> skillful in the science of anatomy<lb/> that, on a certain occasion and in
                the<lb/> presence of other physicians, he proved<lb/> to be able to select from a

            <p rend="indent(1)">While thus the <sic>Palestinean</sic> authori-<lb/>ties of the
                Mishna period seemed to<lb/> have had no objection to dissecting<lb/> corpses for
                necessary purposes. <persName>Rabbi<lb/> Cahana</persName> one of the Babylonian
                Amora-<lb/>im of the <date>fourth century</date> remarked<lb/> incidentally in a
                discussion of the law<lb/> that dissecting a dead body was a dis-<lb/>grace, adding
                however that for the<lb/> purpose of saving a human life in a<lb/> judicial
                investigation it ought to be<lb/> permitted. (Chullin 11b.)</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Although the rabbinical codes of<lb/> the <date>Middle Ages</date>
                contain no express<lb/> prohibition against dissections, such<lb/> an act was
                generally held to be con-<lb/>trary to the regard due to the dead.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The celebrated <persName>Rabbi Ezekiel Lan-<lb/>dau</persName> in
                    <placeName>Prague</placeName>, flourishing in the<lb/>
                <date>second part of the last century</date>, dis-<lb/>cusses in one of his
                responses (<hi rend="italics">Noda</hi><lb/>
                <hi rend="italics">Bihuda</hi>, second collection, Yore Dea,<lb/> No. 210) the
                question whether it<lb/> was permitted to dissect a body in or-<lb/>der to determine
                the nature of the<lb/> disease that caused death so as to know<lb/> how to treat it
                under similar symp-<lb/>toms. As was to be expected of this<lb/> Rabbi who though
                very distinguished<lb/> in rabbinical lore strongly opposed<lb/> secular studies,
                his answer was not<lb/> wholly in favor of the medical science.<lb/> He decided that
                such a dissection was<lb/> only permitted when it immediately<lb/> could serve to
                heal a patient who is<lb/> just suffering of a similar disease, but<lb/> it was not
                allowed when it should<lb/> merely serve to enrich medical science<lb/> to possibly
                heal a similar case at<lb/> some future day.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">A modern Rabbi will hardly make<lb/> such a <sic>subtile</sic>
                distinction but, when<lb/> asked for his opinion, allow a dissec-<lb/>tion or an
                autopsy whenever it is very<lb/> desirable in the interest of medical<lb/> science
                and of suffering humanity.</p>
