			<p rend="indent(1)">of Directors of the Jews&#39; Hospital&#44; <placeName>New&#45;York</placeName>.</p>
				<p>Gentlemen&#58; I have the honor&#44; herewith&#44; to acknow&#45;<lb/>ledge the receipt of your esteemed favor of the<lb/> <date>6<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi> of Shevat</date>&#44; Ult.&#59; and&#44; whilst thanking you<lb/> for the confidence you have been pleased to<lb/> repose in me&#44; I can not refrain from expressing<lb/> my deep appreciation of the firm attachment<lb/> to our most ancient law&#44; so nobly evinced in<lb/> your above mentioned communication.  In com&#95;<lb/>pliance with your wishes&#44; I shall forthwith pro&#95;<lb/>ceed to enter at some length into the question&#44;<lb/> for the clear development of which&#44; it will<lb/> be requisite to direct your attention to the<lb/> three undermentioned principles&#58;</p>
				<p>I. Our religion enjoins most strictly the<lb/> necessity of burying the dead in a <hi rend="underline">respectful</hi><lb/> manner.</p>
				<p>II Our Religion teaches that a certain degree<lb/> of sanctity be attached to the lifeless remains</p>
			<pb n="5"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">4</p>
				<p>of a human body&#59; and</p>
				<p>III As a natural consequence of these two<lb/> principles&#44; our religion forbids every kind<lb/> of maiming and desecration of the dead.</p>
				<p>I. &#758;Our religion enjoins the necessity of burying<lb/> the dead in a respectful manner.&#34;  This may<lb/> be proved from the following facts&#58;</p>
				<p>1. Throughout the Bible&#44; the burial of historical<lb/> characters is specially recorded.</p>
				<p>2. The want of burial is considered as a terrible<lb/> calamity.  &#40;<persName>Isaiah</persName> XIV 19.20&#59; Psalms LXXIX 3&#59;<lb/> Ecclesiastes VI 3.&#41;</p>
				<p>3. Decent burial is sufficiently important to<lb/> be promised as a reward for good actions<lb/> &#40;1 Kings XIV 13.&#41;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The oral law likewise repeatedly dwells on<lb/> the great necessity of decent interment&#44; de&#45;<lb/>clares that the burial of an exposed corpse<lb/> supersedes all other precepts&#44; and considers<lb/> every person engaged in burial&#44; as being en&#45;<lb/>gaged in a most important duty.</p>
			<pb n="6"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">5</p>
				<p>Although both the Bible and oral law speak<lb/> of burning&#44; in <sic>connexion</sic> with deceased kings&#44;<lb/> yet that burning does not refer to the corpse&#44;<lb/> which was uniformly buried&#44; but to valuable<lb/> articles which were burnt in honor of the dead.<lb/>  That this is the true meaning&#44; may be proved<lb/> from the considerations&#58;</p>
				<p>1. Both in the Bible and in the oral law the word <add>Hebrew</add>&#44;<lb/> when used in reference to the above mentioned custom&#44;<lb/> is never followed by the accusative sign <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; but<lb/> by the particles <add>Hebrew</add> or <add>Hebrew</add> denoting &#34;concerning&#34;<lb/> &#34;for&#34; &#40;vide <persName>Jeremiah</persName> XXXIV&#44; 5&#59; 2 Chronicles XVI. 14&#44;<lb/> ibid. xxi 19&#59; Talmud Abodah Zorah&#44; fol. 11.&#44; Joreh&#45;<lb/>Deah&#44; cap. 348&#41;.</p>
				<p>2&#44; The Talmud &#40;ibid.&#41; and Joreh&#45;Deah &#40;ibid.&#41; express&#45;<lb/>ly mention <hi rend="underline">what</hi> <hi rend="underline">articles</hi> were burnt.</p>
				<p>3&#44; The matter is&#44; however&#44; put beyond doubt by this<lb/> verse&#44; &#40;2 Chronicles xvi 14&#41; &#758;and they buried him in<lb/> his own sepulchre&#59;....and they made a very<lb/> great burning for him&#34; This needs no farther<lb/> comment.</p>
			<pb n="7"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">6.</p>
				<p>II &#758;Our religion teaches that a certain degree<lb/> of sanctity be attached to the lifeless remains<lb/> of a human body&#758; The proofs of this are&#58;&#8212;</p>
				<p>1. The Divine command not to permit the corpse&#44;<lb/> even of <del>the</del> a criminal&#44; to be exposed over night.</p>
				<p>2 The wish which was expressed to be buried close<lb/> to a prophet. &#40;1. Kings XIII. 28&#45;31.&#41;</p>
				<p>3. The restoration to life of the corpse which touched<lb/> the body of <persName>Elisha</persName> &#40;2 Kings XIII. 21.&#41;</p>
				<p>4 The great reverence felt towards the burying<lb/> place of ancestors. &#40;<persName>Nehem.</persName> II. 3&#45;5.&#41;</p>
				<p>The oral law also forbids delay in burial&#44;<lb/> unless it be fore the purpose of preparing a<lb/> more dignified funeral&#59; and strictly commands<lb/> that the funeral should be solemnized with be&#45;<lb/>coming marks of respect to the Departed.  &#40;Vide<lb/> Moed Katan&#44; fol. 27&#59; Joreh Deah&#44; cap. 343.</p>
				<p>III &#758;As a natural consequence of these two prin&#45;<lb/>ciples&#44; our religion forbids every kind of maiming&#44;<lb/> and of Desecration of the dead.&#34;</p>
				<p>The desecration thus prohibited is of three kinds&#58;&#8212;</p>
			<pb n="8"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">7</p>
				<p>1<hi rend="underline">st</hi> The appropriation of any portion of the corpse for<lb/> purposes of gain&#44; or private use of any kind.  This is<lb/> prohibited&#44; Yaddim IV. 6&#59; Sanhedr. fol. 47&#44; 48&#44;<lb/> Chulin&#44; fol. 122&#59; Niddah 55<hi rend="underline">a</hi>&#59; Yorah Deah&#44; Chap. 349.</p>
				<p>2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> Disinterment likewise prohibited.  Baba Bathrah&#44;<lb/> fol. 154&#59; Abel Rabbathi&#44; IV. 12&#59; Joreh&#45;Deah cap. 363&#59;<lb/> Chosen&#45;Mishpat&#44; cap. 235&#44; &#167;13.</p>
				<p>3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> Post mortem examinations&#44; also prohibited<lb/> &#40;Chulin fol. 11.<hi rend="underline">b</hi>&#59;&#45;Joreh&#45;Deah&#44; cap. 403&#44; &#167;6.&#41; except<lb/> in cases wherein the life of a human being depends<lb/> on such examination&#59; as&#44; for instance&#44; when anyone<lb/> is accused of having murdered the deceased&#44; and<lb/> a post mortem examination is required for the purpose<lb/> of investigating the charge&#44; or when the nature of<lb/> the disease is unknown&#44; and there is another patient<lb/> affected with the same malady&#44;&#8212;then a post mortem<lb/> examination is permitted&#44; in order to save the life of<lb/> the survivor&#58; these however&#44; are only the rare exceptions.<lb/>  But as a general rule&#44; post mortem examinations <sic>is</sic> con&#45;<lb/>sidered by our law as desecration&#44; and prohibited.<lb/>  It may be urged&#44; on the other side&#44; that the progress</p>
			<pb n="9"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">8</p>
				<p>of medical science renders a certain amount<lb/> of post mortem examination unavoidable&#59; but to<lb/> this I reply&#44; that since such treatment of the Decea&#45;<lb/>sed is a desecration&#44; it can only be permitted in<lb/> cases of extreme necessity&#59; and even if some<lb/> exceptions must be made&#44; the poor ought not to<lb/> be the victims.  You would surely not embitter<lb/> the sweetness of charity by such hardship&#44; and not<lb/> allow that the feelings of the poor man&#44; when<lb/> necessity compels him to seek shelter in your<lb/> Hospital&#44; be harrowed on his death bed by knowing<lb/> that he must pay&#44; even with his body&#44; for the hos&#45;<lb/>pitality of your roof&#59; and it is hardly necessary<lb/> to describe to you the agonizing pangs of the near<lb/> relatives&#44; who can not protect their dear departed<lb/> ones from that desecration which they view with the<lb/> greatest horror.  Thus humanity forbids us from<lb/> making an exception in cases of the poor&#59; and<lb/> you know that the oral law&#44; in several places&#44;<lb/> enjoins that&#44; in our treatment of the Dead&#44; we<lb/> ought to make no distinction whatever between</p>
			<pb n="10"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">9.</p>
				<p>the rich and the poor.  The only exceptions which<lb/> either reason or humanity can admit&#44; are crimi&#45;<lb/>nals who had committed high crimes.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">From the above&#44; I trust that it will be clear<lb/> to you&#44; that religion and humanity unite also here<lb/> in declaring that post mortem examinations should<lb/> <hi rend="underline">not</hi> be permitted in the hospital.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">With the assurance that I shall be ever<lb/> ready to afford to you any information you may<lb/> require in the matter&#44; and praying for your<lb/> prosperity and spiritual welfare&#44;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I have the honor to be<lb/> Gentlemen&#44; yours faithfully&#44;</p>
				<p><persName>N. Adler Dr.</persName></p>

				<p rend="align(right)">10.</p>
				<p>Although neither connected <del>connected</del> with the<lb/> medical profession&#44; nor disposed to view the<lb/> dissection of the human body with any<lb/> degree of pleasurable interest&#44; nor advo&#45;<lb/>cating post mortem examinations generally&#44;<lb/> whether of those dying in a Hospital or at<lb/> home&#44; whether &#758;high or low&#44; rich or poor&#44;&#34; all<lb/> of which circumstances appear&#44; however&#44; quite<lb/> irrelevant to the present inquiry&#44; I would<lb/> simply ask&#58; &#758;Does the mosaic Religion in&#45;<lb/>terdict such examinations&#63;&#758;  In a communica&#45;<lb/>tion&#44; lately received from the <persName>Chief Rabbi Adler</persName>&#44;<lb/> of <placeName>London</placeName>&#44; are arguments which&#44; with due defer<lb/>ence to so learned an authority&#44; I cannot<lb/> admit&#59; and I would like to have stronger<lb/> reasons and proofs adduced&#44; before acknow&#45;<lb/>ledging that our religion prohibits an in&#45;<lb/>vestigation&#44; which is purely for the benefit of<lb/> the human race.</p>
				<p>The Rev. gentleman commences by laying<lb/> down three principles or propositions</p>
			<pb n="12"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">11.</p>
				<p>The <hi rend="underline">first</hi> that &#758;Our Religion enjoins burial of the dead<lb/> in a respectful manner&#59;&#758; to this I fully assent.<lb/>  <hi rend="underline">Second</hi>&#44; That &#758;our religion attaches a certain degree<lb/> of sanctity to the lifeless remains of a human body&#59;<lb/> for argument&#39;s sake let this be allowed.  And&#44; as a<lb/> natural consequence of these two principles we<lb/> may admit the deduction that our religion forbids<lb/> every kind of <hi rend="underline">desecration</hi> of the dead.  But I<lb/> cannot concede that the dead can be maimed&#44;<lb/> or that a post mortem examination is either<lb/> a maiming or a desecration of the dead&#44; any<lb/> more than a surgical operation is a desecration<lb/> of the living.  In the former case&#44; the intention<lb/> is to benefit millions living&#44; and yet to live&#59;<lb/> in the latter&#44; the primary object is individual<lb/> good only.  The revd. Dr. endeavors to prove<lb/> that a degree of sanctity is <sic>attaches</sic> to the<lb/> remains of a human body&#44; and cites a few<lb/> incidents from the scriptures to establish it&#59;<lb/> but if they are the strongest that can be ad&#45;<lb/>duced&#44; I think the second principle is not so</p>
			<pb n="13"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">12.</p>
				<p>clearly proved&#44; i. e. of there being a degree of<lb/> sanctity &#40;i. e. holiness and purity&#41; attached&#44; etc<lb/> as for the wish to be buried close to a Prophet&#44;<lb/> &#40;1. Kings&#44; XIII 28&#45;31.&#41; the desire was not expressed<lb/> because it was &#34;<hi rend="underline">a dead body</hi>&#34;&#44; but on account<lb/> of the sanctity &#40;holiness and purity&#41; attached<lb/> to the <hi rend="underline">character</hi> of the Prophet.  Regarding the resto&#45;<lb/>ration to life of the corpse which touched the body<lb/> of <persName>Elisha</persName>&#44; &#40;2 Kings XIII.21&#41; I can not perceive<lb/> how&#44; or in what manner&#44; that miracle signifies<lb/> a degree of sanctity attached to human remains<lb/> generally.  It appears to me&#44; as though the fact<lb/> of his being a Prophet&#44; only&#44; produced the miracle&#44;<lb/> unless it be claimed that <hi rend="underline">any other body</hi> would<lb/> have caused the same.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The doctor for this informs us what is considered<lb/> desecration.  First&#44; the appropriation of any portion<lb/> of the corpse for purposes of gain&#44; or private use&#59;<lb/> in this I fully concur.  As to disinterment&#44; I beg<lb/> to differ with the learned gentleman&#44; and the author&#44;<lb/>ities he cites.  There are numerous circumstances under</p>
			<pb n="14"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">13.</p>
				<p>which disinterment is the reverse of desecration&#59;<lb/> but as this is irrelevant at present to the point<lb/> at issue&#44; I will not farther pursue it.</p>
				<p>I have always believed that what was not for&#45;<lb/>bidden in the laws of <persName>Moses</persName> we might do&#44; provided<lb/> such things were not against reason or nature&#59;<lb/> and farther that the spirit of those Laws make<lb/> it an imperative duty&#44; to do that which will<lb/> benefit our fellow&#45;creatures&#59; and it cannot<lb/> be denied that post mortem examinations are<lb/> made with that humane end in view.  But the<lb/> exceptions in the Doctors communication would<lb/> limit post mortem investigation to the examination<lb/> only of a person suspected to have been killed by<lb/> foul means.  For&#44; as to the exception made&#44; when<lb/> the <hi rend="underline">nature</hi> of a disease is <hi rend="underline">unknown</hi>&#44; what mortal<lb/> physician can affirm that another patient is<lb/> affected with the <hi rend="underline">same</hi>&#63;  Thus the second exception<lb/> amounts almost to prohibition.</p>
				<p>The Doctor adds&#44; as apparently his own opinion&#44;<lb/> that &#758;since a post mortem examination is a desecration&#44;</p>
			<pb n="15"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">14</p>
				<p>it can only be permitted in cases of <hi rend="underline">extreme</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">necessity</hi>&#44; and that the only exceptions which<lb/> reason and humanity can admit&#44; are criminals&#44;<lb/> who had committed high crimes.&#34;  The latitude<lb/> given to the words &#758;extreme necessity&#44;&#34; not<lb/> being defined&#44; I am unable to construe this<lb/> portion of the Reverend gentleman&#39;s reply.<lb/>  Regarding &#758;reason and humanity&#44;&#34; I think<lb/> it can be clearly proved they both unite in<lb/> sanctioning any effort to progress in a knowledge<lb/> so useful and practical as surgical science.<lb/>  And from what I have read in the Doctors com&#45;<lb/>munication&#44; I cannot see wherein religion<lb/> prohibits it.</p>
				<p>As to individual feelings and prejudices which<lb/> are not confined to any particular position<lb/> in life&#44; whether affluent or otherwise&#44; I &#40;individually&#41;<lb/> would conform to the wishes of the Deceased&#44; if<lb/> such had been expressed&#44; or to those of his family&#59;<lb/> but all this is quite foreign to the question.<lb/>  We have nothing to do with personal prejudices and</p>
			<pb n="16"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">15</p>
				<p>family feelings&#44; or the wealth or poverty of the parties&#44;<lb/> or as to the place in which they die.  The simple question<lb/> to decide is&#44; does the letter or the spirit of the<lb/> laws of <persName>Moses</persName> forbid post mortem examinations&#44;<lb/> when such will throw light upon science&#44; and<lb/> ultimately benefit the human race&#63;</p>

				<p>To <addressee>S. Abrahams M. D.</addressee> <placeName>New&#45;York</placeName>.</p>
				<p>My dear friend&#33;  About four years have elapsed<lb/> since I enjoyed the pleasure of a literary<lb/> communication from you.  I received no direct<lb/> news from you&#44; and was satisfied to learn from<lb/> other sources of your well&#45;being.  I exclaimed<lb/> with <persName>cicero</persName>&#44; si vales&#44; bene est&#44; ego valeo.  But<lb/> meeting with one of your productions in the<lb/> Asmonean&#44; a <del>fiew</del> few weeks ago&#44; engaged as<lb/> you are&#44; in a controversy on an important<lb/> question&#44; I resolved to break my silence and<lb/> to address these lines to you.</p>
				<p>I perfectly agree with you&#44; my dear friend&#44; in<lb/> the opinion that <hi rend="underline">Dissection</hi> is by no means<lb/> contrary to our oral law&#59; nay&#44; I do even<lb/> maintain that our sages and ancient teachers<lb/> <sic>practised</sic> themselves anatomical investigations.<lb/>  For&#44; how could they otherwise have <sic>aquired</sic> that<lb/> knowledge of the structure of the human frame<lb/> which they so frequently display in the Talmud<lb/> and Zohar&#63;  How else could they have asserted</p>
			<pb n="18"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">17</p>
				<p>so positively that the human body consists of 248<lb/> members in contradiction to the wise men of other<lb/> nations&#44; some of whom assert that their number<lb/> is only 245&#44; while others count 249&#44; others 256&#44;<lb/> and some even 266 members&#63;</p>
				<p>I will now cite&#44; for the satisfaction of your oppo&#45;<lb/>nent&#44; several passages from the Talmud and Zohar&#44;<lb/> and then ask him how our sages could speak<lb/> scientifically of a thing of which they could have<lb/> no idea&#44; how they could infer one proposition from<lb/> another&#44; if they were not allowed to convince themselves<lb/> of the correctness of their inferences&#63;  How could<lb/> they&#44; for instance say with such precision and<lb/> positiveness&#58; <add>Hebrew</add>&#63;</p>
				<p>It is generally known that the word <hi rend="underline">brain</hi> is<lb/> a collective term which signifies those four princi&#45;<lb/>pal parts of the nervous system exclusive of<lb/> the nerves themselves&#44; which are contained within the<lb/> cranium&#59; they are&#58; the cerebrum or the larger part.</p>

Another passage<lb/> of the Zohar reads thus&#58; <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>.</p>
				<p>The heart of an adult person consists of four<lb/> muscular cavities&#44; namely&#44; the two auricles<lb/> &#40;or attria&#41; which their two auricula cordis and<lb/> two ventricles&#44; which are respectively named<lb/> from their position right and left.  The right<lb/> auricle and right ventricle form together the<lb/> right part and the left auricle together with<lb/> the left ventricle form together the left part of<lb/> the heart.  In the Zohar&#44; section Behar&#44; we read<lb/> as follows&#58; <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>.  Of the auricula cordis we read in</p>

Zohar&#44; adza Rabbah fol. 136<lb/> describes the skull as follows&#58; The skull or crani<lb/>um has three holes or sockets wherein the brains<lb/> are imbedded&#59; the brain is covered and protected<lb/> by two membranes&#44; the one is firm and strong&#44; &#40;Sura<lb/>mates&#59;&#42;&#41; the other &#40;pia mater&#44;&#41; thin and tender.<lb/>  Three parts of the brain diffuse themselves<lb/> through thirty&#45;two nerves all over the body</p>

You will admit that the three main organs<lb/> with their thirty&#45;two nerves&#44; which are so systematically<lb/> distributed&#44; giving sensation and motion to the en<lb/>tire animal organism of life could not be more<lb/> distinctly described.</p>
				<p>We find also mentioned in the Talmud several<lb/> surgical operations and experiments&#44; as also&#44;<lb/> amputations of important limbs&#59; for instance&#44;<lb/> in Aboda&#45;Zarah&#44; where an account is given<lb/> of an operation for the cure of a fistula.<lb/>  In Talmud Yebamoth&#44; fol. 75&#44; it is stated that<lb/> <persName>Mur Bar Rab Ashi</persName>&#44; who is so frequently mentioned<lb/> in the Talmud&#44; had operated on a person suffering<lb/> from a <add>Hebrew</add>.</p>

				<p>but I could cite ten times more if required&#44;<lb/> showing that the men of the Talmud possessed a<lb/> knowledge of the interior as well as the exterior<lb/> structure of the human body&#44; which they could<lb/> never have acquired without dissecting&#44; and without<lb/> anatomical investigations of their own&#59; and there<lb/> is no passage known to me&#44; which could&#44; in the<lb/> least&#44; justify the presumption that the Jewish<lb/> physician ever made any distinction between the<lb/> body of an Israelite or a non&#45;Israelite&#44; in this<lb/> respect&#59; and therefore I coni<del>n</del>cide with you<lb/> in the opinion that dissecting is not only not pro&#45;<lb/>hibited to the Jewish surgeon&#44; but that it is right<lb/> that he should not neglect any opportunity<lb/> where he can enter the secret laboratory of<lb/> nature in order to scrutinize her working within&#44;<lb/> and understand her symptoms from without.<lb/>  Very respectfully&#44; your friend</p>

				<p rend="align(center)"><hi rend="bold">TEM DISSECTIONS.</hi></p>
				<p rend="align(center)">&#91;For the ISRAELITE.&#93;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">A gentleman in the far <placeName>West</placeName> lately<lb/> requested to be informed through the<lb/> ISRAELITE whether the Jewish Law<lb/> prohibits a post mortem dissection for<lb/> the purpose of a medical investigation.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">This question was occasioned by an<lb/> occurrence in a hospital where a Jewish<lb/> man died of a peculiar kidney dis&#45;<lb/>ease the nature of which the physi&#45;<lb/>cians were anxious to ascertain by an<lb/> autopsy.  To this&#44; however&#44; the rela&#45;<lb/>tives strongly objected stating that<lb/> the Jewish religion prohibits any mu&#45;<lb/>tilation of the dead body of a human<lb/> being.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In answer&#44; I would say that a want&#45;<lb/>on mutilation of a human body would<lb/> certainly be against the spirit of the<lb/> Jewish law which ordained that even<lb/> the corpse of the executed criminal<lb/> shall be protected against a disgrace&#45;<lb/>ful exhibition &#40;Deut. xxi&#44; 23&#41;.  But<lb/> whether it is permitted or prohibited<lb/> to perform a dissection of the dead<lb/> for the purpose of ascertaining the<lb/> cause&#44; seat or nature of a disease&#8212;such<lb/> a question was entirely foreign to the<lb/> Biblical antiquity.  In the Book of<lb/> Judges xix&#44; 29&#44; the dissection of the<lb/> dead body of an outraged woman is<lb/> mentioned&#44; but this was for a different<lb/> purpose and concerned an extraordi&#45;<lb/>nary case from which no conclusions<lb/> can be made for the question before us</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">That dissections of corpses were per&#45;<lb/>formed in an early time of the rabbi&#45;<lb/>nical period is evident from the con&#45;<lb/>siderable anatomical knowledge which<lb/> the Mishna teachers displayed in stat&#45;<lb/>ing almost exactly the number of<lb/> bones and of sinews in the human<lb/> body and in each of its limbs &#40;See<lb/> Mishna Ohaloth I&#44; 8&#41;.  Of the disci&#45;<lb/>ples of <persName>Rabbi Ishmael</persName> &#40;in the <date>second<lb/> century C. E.</date>&#41; it is expressly stated<lb/> in the Talmud &#40;Bechoroth 45a&#41; that<lb/> they prepared the corpse of an execut&#45;<lb/>ed criminal&#44; for the purpose of an<lb/> anatomical investigation.  A Jewish<lb/> physician by name <persName>Theodosius</persName> who<lb/> flourished in <placeName>Palestine</placeName> in the <date>second<lb/> century</date> is reported &#40;in the Tosephta<lb/> Ohaloth ch. iv.&#41; as having been so<lb/> skillful in the science of anatomy<lb/> that&#44; on a certain occasion and in the<lb/> presence of other physicians&#44; he proved<lb/> to be able to select from a basket full<lb/> of human bones those belonging to<lb/> each other and in this way reconstruct<lb/> the original skeletons.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">While thus the <sic>Palestinean</sic> authori&#45;<lb/>ties of the Mishna period seemed to<lb/> have had no objection to dissecting<lb/> corpses for necessary purposes.  <persName>Rabbi<lb/> Cahana</persName> one of the Babylonian Amora&#45;<lb/>im of the <date>fourth century</date> remarked<lb/> incidentally in a discussion of the law<lb/> that dissecting a dead body was a dis&#45;<lb/>grace&#44; adding however that for the<lb/> purpose of saving a human life in a<lb/> judicial investigation it ought to be<lb/> permitted.  &#40;Chullin 11b.&#41;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Although the rabbinical codes of<lb/> the <date>Middle Ages</date> contain no express<lb/> prohibition against dissections&#44; such<lb/> an act was generally held to be con&#45;<lb/>trary to the regard due to the dead.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The celebrated <persName>Rabbi Ezekiel Lan&#45;<lb/>dau</persName> in <placeName>Prague</placeName>&#44; flourishing in the<lb/> <date>second part of the last century</date>&#44; dis&#45;<lb/>cusses in one of his responses &#40;<hi rend="italics">Noda</hi><lb/> <hi rend="italics">Bihuda</hi>&#44; second collection&#44; Yore Dea&#44;<lb/> No. 210&#41; the question whether it<lb/> was permitted to dissect a body in or&#45;<lb/>der to determine the nature of the<lb/> disease that caused death so as to know<lb/> how to treat it under similar symp&#45;<lb/>toms.  As was to be expected of this<lb/> Rabbi who though very distinguished<lb/> in rabbinical lore strongly opposed<lb/> secular studies&#44; his answer was not<lb/> wholly in favor of the medical science.<lb/>  He decided that such a dissection was<lb/> only permitted when it immediately<lb/> could serve to heal a patient who is<lb/> just suffering of a similar disease&#44; but<lb/> it was not allowed when it should<lb/> merely serve to enrich medical science<lb/> to possibly heal a similar case at<lb/> some future day.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">A modern Rabbi will hardly make<lb/> such a <sic>subtile</sic> distinction but&#44; when<lb/> asked for his opinion&#44; allow a dissec&#45;<lb/>tion or an autopsy whenever it is very<lb/> desirable in the interest of medical<lb/> science and of suffering humanity.</p>
