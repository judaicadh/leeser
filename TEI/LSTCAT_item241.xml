				<p rend="align(center)"><persName>MR. HART&#39;S REMARKS</persName>.    5</p>
				<p>Our brethren are accused of being accomplices in murder&#44; in order to<lb/> make&#44; with the blood of murdered men&#44; their <date>Passover</date>&#45;cakes&#44; a thing<lb/> in itself incredible&#44; as being forbidden by our holy religion.  This<lb/> report has&#44; however&#44; found credence with the governing <persName>Pachas</persName> of<lb/> <placeName>Damascus</placeName> and <placeName>Rhodes</placeName>&#44; and they oppressed and incarcerated not only<lb/> several old men and rabbins&#44; but even a number of children&#44; putting<lb/> them to tortures which it makes one shudder to hear.  Such is the<lb/> afflicting picture drawn in the letters of our persecuted brethren&#44; of<lb/> which letters&#44; with deep regret&#44; we hand you copies.</p>
				<p rend="align(center)">TRANSLATION OF A HEBREW LETTER FROM THE JEWS OF <placeName>DAMASCUS</placeName> TO<lb/> THE ELDERS OF THE CONGREGATION AT <placeName>CONSTANTINOPLE</placeName>.</p>
				<p>&#8220;<hi rend="italics">To <persName>Messrs. Aram Cornorte</persName> and <persName>Aaron Cohen</persName></hi>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#8220;Expressing my best wishes for your health&#44; to my deep regret I<lb/> address you these few lines&#44; to inform you of the continued state of<lb/> misery in which our brethren&#44; inhabitants of <placeName>Damascus</placeName>&#44; still remain&#44;<lb/> as communicated to you in my letter of the <date>17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Adar &#40;February&#44;&#41;</date><lb/> by the steam packet.  I had hoped to advise in this letter&#44; that the cir&#45;<lb/>cumstances of the murder respecting which they were calumniated had<lb/> been ascertained&#44; but in this hope I have been sadly disappointed&#59; I<lb/> will&#44; therefore&#44; now repeat every thing in detail&#44; and it is thus&#58;&#8212;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#8220;On <date>Wednesday&#44; the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> day of the month Adar &#40;February&#44;&#41;</date> there<lb/> disappeared from <placeName>Damascus</placeName> a priest&#44; who&#44; with his servant&#44; had dwelt<lb/> for forty years in this city&#59; he exercised the profession of a physician&#44;<lb/> and visited the houses of Catholics&#44; Jews&#44; and Armenians&#44; for the pur&#45;<lb/>pose of vaccination.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#8220;The day following &#40;<date>Thursday</date>&#44;&#41; there came people into the quarter<lb/> of the Jews to look for him&#44; stating that they had seen both him and<lb/> his servant on the previous day &#40;<date>Wednesday</date>&#41; in that quarter.  In  order<lb/> to put in execution their conspiracy&#44; they seized a Jewish barber&#44; tell&#45;<lb/>ing him he must know all about the matter&#44; and thence they imme&#45;<lb/>diately carried him before the Governor&#44; before whom they accused<lb/> him&#44; and he instantly received five hundred stripes&#44; and he was also<lb/> subjected to other cruelties.  During the intervals between these inflic&#45;<lb/>tions he was urged to accuse all the Jews as accomplices&#44; and he&#44; think&#45;<lb/>ing by these means to relieve himself&#44; accused <persName>Messrs. David Arari</persName>&#44;<lb/> <persName>Isaac Arari</persName>&#44; <persName>Aaron Arari</persName>&#44; <persName>Joseph Laguado</persName>&#44; <persName>Moses Aboulafia</persName>&#44; <persName>Moses<lb/> Bonar Juda</persName>&#44; and <persName>Joseph Arari</persName>&#44; as instigating accomplices&#44; who had<lb/> offered him three hundred piastres to murder the above&#45;mentioned<lb/> priest&#44; inasmuch as&#44; the <date>Passover</date>&#45;holydays approaching&#44; they required<lb/> blood for their cakes&#59; that he did not&#44; however&#44; give ear to their</p>

				<p>instigations while at the same time he knew not what might have<lb/> happened to the priest and his servant.  Upon this the <persName>Pacha</persName> caused<lb/> the aforesaid traduced persons to be arrested as instigators&#44; and punished<lb/> with blows and other torments of the most cruel nature&#59; but as they<lb/> were innocent&#44; they could not confirm as true that which was a<lb/> calumny&#44; and therefore&#44; in contradiction&#44; they asserted their innocence&#44;<lb/> appealing to the sacred writings&#44; which strictly prohibit the Jews feed&#45;<lb/>ing upon blood&#44; much more that of a fellow&#45;creature&#44; a thing totally<lb/> repugnant to nature.  Nevertheless&#44; they were imprisoned&#44; and daily&#44;<lb/> with chains around their necks&#44; there were inflicted on them the most<lb/> severe beatings and cruelties&#44; and they were compelled to stand with&#45;<lb/>out food of any kind for fifty hours together.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#8220;Subsequently to this the Hebrew butchers were cited to appear&#59;<lb/> they were put in chains&#44; together with the rabbins.  <persName>Messrs. Jacob An&#45;<lb/>tier</persName>&#44; <persName>Solomon Arari</persName>&#44; and <persName>Asaria Jalfon</persName>&#59; and they&#44; too&#44; were beaten to<lb/> such an extreme that their flesh hung in pieces upon them&#59; and these<lb/> atrocities perpetrated in order to induce them to confess whether or not<lb/> they used blood in the <date>Passover</date>&#45;cakes&#44; to which they replied&#44; that&#44; if<lb/> such had been the case&#44; many Jewish proselytes would have published<lb/> the fact.  This&#44; however&#44; was not sufficient.  Subsequently to this&#44;<lb/> the same Governor went to the college of the boys&#59; he had them carried<lb/> to prison&#44; loaded them with chains&#44; and forbade the mothers to visit<lb/> their imprisoned children&#44; to whom only ten drachms of bread and a<lb/> cup of water per day were allowed&#44; the Governor expecting that the<lb/> fathers&#44; for the sake of liberating their children&#44; would confess the truth<lb/> of the matter.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#8220;After this&#44; the Jew&#44; who was still at liberty&#44; presented himself be&#45;<lb/>fore the Governor&#44; stating that the calumny&#44; that we make use of blood<lb/> for our <date>Passover</date>&#45;cakes&#44; had been discussed before all the powers&#44; who&#44;<lb/> after consulting their divines&#44; had declared the falsehood of such a<lb/> calumny&#59; and he added&#44; that either others had killed the priest and his<lb/> servant&#44; or that they had clandestinely absented themselves from the<lb/> country&#44; and that the barber&#44; to save himself from persecution&#44; had<lb/> stated that which was not true.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#8220;Upon this the Governor replied&#44; that as he had accused other per&#45;<lb/>sons of killing them&#44; he must know who were the murderers&#59; and in<lb/> order that he should confess&#44; he was beaten to such an extreme that he<lb/> expired under the blows.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#8220;After this&#44; the Governor&#44; with a body of six hundred men&#44; pro&#45;<lb/>ceeded to demolish the houses of his Jewish subjects&#44; hoping to find the<lb/> bodies of the dead&#59; but not finding any thing&#44; he returned&#44; and again<lb/> inflicted on his victims further castigations and torments&#44; some of them</p>

			<p rend="indent(1)">&#8220;The Governor&#44; hearing the confession&#44; asked them where they had<lb/> secreted the blood of the murdered man&#44; to which one of them replied<lb/> that it had been put into a bottle&#44; and delivered to <persName>Mr. Moses Aboulafia</persName>&#44;<lb/> who declared he knew nothing of it&#44; and in order that he should confess<lb/> he received one thousand stripes&#59; but this infliction not extorting his<lb/> confession&#44; he was subjected to other insupportable torments&#44; which at<lb/> length compelled him to declare that the bottle was at home in a chest<lb/> of drawers.  Upon this the Governor ordered that he should be carried<lb/> on the shoulders of four men&#44; &#40;for he could not walk&#44;&#41; that he might<lb/> open the bureau.  This was opened&#44; but nothing was found in it&#44; except<lb/> a quantity of money&#44; which the Governor seized&#44; asking him&#44; at the<lb/> same time&#44; where was the blood&#59; whereupon the said <persName>Aboulafia</persName> replied&#44;<lb/> that he made that statement in order that the Governor should see the<lb/> money in the bureau&#44; trusting by these means to save himself from the<lb/> calumny.  Upon this&#44; the torments were repeated&#44; and <persName>Aboulafia</persName>&#44; to<lb/> save himself&#44; embraced Mahometanism.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#8220;It is thus that they treated the whole&#59; they have now been for one<lb/> month in this misery.  In <placeName><sic>Beirout</sic></placeName>&#44; and much more in <placeName>Damascus</placeName>&#44; the<lb/> Jews are not at liberty to go out.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#8220;After this&#44; an individual came forward and stated that&#44; by means<lb/> of astrology&#44; he had discovered and ascertained that the seven indivi&#45;<lb/>duals above named assassinated the priest&#44; and that the servant was<lb/> killed by <persName>Raphael Farhi</persName>&#44; <persName>Nathan Levi</persName>&#44; <persName>Aaron Levi</persName>&#44; <persName>Mordecai Farhi</persName>&#44;<lb/> and <persName>Asser</persName>&#44; of <placeName>Lisbon</placeName>.  The two first of these were immediately ar&#45;<lb/>rested&#44; the others&#44; it appears&#44; sought safety in flight.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#8220;You will judge from this&#44; dear friends&#44; what sort of justice is ad&#45;<lb/>ministered by means of astrology&#44; and how such justice is adminis&#45;<lb/>tered.  And there is no one who is moved to compassion in favour of<lb/> the unfortunate victims of oppression.

				<p>Christians&#44; by the heathens of the first three centuries&#44; under which the<lb/> Jews of <placeName>Damascus</placeName> were now suffering even around us&#44; and the bane&#45;<lb/>ful effects which this report had produced among an ignorant and<lb/> bigoted population&#44; it was immediately resolved amongst the members<lb/> of our mission&#44; especially our worthy and revered <sic>superintendant</sic>&#44; <persName>Mr.<lb/> John Nicolayson</persName>&#44; that I should forthwith go to <placeName>Damascus</placeName>&#44; in order&#44; if<lb/> supported by the European consuls there&#44; that I might give my testi&#45;<lb/>mony that the Jewish religion&#44; so far from requiring murder and the<lb/> use of blood&#44; expressly forbids both&#59; and to this fact I am prepared to<lb/> repeat in addition&#44; in my own name&#44; the famous oath of your illustrious<lb/> <persName>Manasseh Ben Israel</persName>.  Whether the Jews had committed murder or<lb/> not&#44; we could not decide at a distance&#59; but what we wished to do was<lb/> to prevent the crime of one&#44; or some&#44; being made a national crime.  I<lb/> was fixed on for this mission&#44; as I was born a Jew&#44; and was trained up<lb/> for the Rabbinical profession&#44; and therefore best qualified&#44; and as a<lb/> Christian&#44; and by no means a friend to&#44; or advocate of Rabbinism&#44;<lb/> reasonably accepted as a witness in such a case.  I will not describe<lb/> what my feelings were when at <placeName>Damascus</placeName>.  I found the whole charge<lb/> against them a fabrication&#44; and that all means and right of legal<lb/> <sic>defence</sic> were denied them&#44; while the most cruel tortures were employed<lb/> to extort from them false confessions of guilt&#44; which some were cowards<lb/> enough to make.  You are now in possession of the result of my<lb/> labours in <placeName>Damascus</placeName>&#44; and know also what steps I am now taking in<lb/> <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>&#44; and intend to take in the case.

			<p rend="indent(1)">Let it not be supposed that the letter I have just read is a fancied<lb/> picture&#44; a mere imagination of the brain&#8212;no sir&#44; it is PERSECUTION as<lb/> it NOW EXISTS IN THE <placeName>EAST</placeName>.  But will it stop there&#44; unless by exertions<lb/> of this and other meetings the facts be disproved&#59; unless it be shown<lb/> that these accusations are not true&#44; cannot be true&#44; such things being<lb/> incompatible with our sacred and holy religion&#63;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">If such a calumny is not nipped in the bud&#44; its effect will not be limited<lb/> to any particular place&#44; but will be extended to every part of the globe.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In <persName>Mr. Peiritz&#39;s</persName> letter he remarks&#44; some were <hi rend="italics">cowards enough to make<lb/> false confessions of guilt</hi>&#44; which I cannot in justice pass by unnoticed.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">It would not&#44; sir&#44; have surprised me&#44; if all had made false confessions<lb/> of the improbable crimes imputed to them&#44; after suffering the cruelties<lb/> of their inhuman tormentors&#59; <hi rend="italics">but it is to be wondered at</hi>&#44; that so many&#44;<lb/> or indeed any&#44; should have endured unflinchingly&#59; maintaining their<lb/> innocence notwithstanding their almost insufferable anguish&#59; an in&#45;<lb/>stance of which is cited in the reply from the chief Rabbi of the Jews<lb/> in <placeName>Damascus</placeName>&#44; which is extracted from a letter dated <date>18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of June</date>&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#8220;The chief Rabbi being requested to sign a confession of the murder&#44;<lb/> said&#8212;&#39;When you smote me with five hundred stripes all over my<lb/> body I would not confess to a lie&#59; when you plunged me into a pool<lb/> of cold water for three hours on a winter&#39;s day&#44; a drawn sword over<lb/> my head so that I could not raise it&#44; I lied not&#59; and when you inflicted<lb/> a hundred and seventy stripes on my hand&#44; I would not utter a false&#45;<lb/>hood&#59; and when you drove the bones which you placed round my head<lb/> into my eyes to blind me&#44; I still lied not&#44; and spoke not this falsehood&#59;<lb/> and now shall I sign to a lie&#63;&#8221;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The writer adds&#44; &#8220;the Rabbi was then sent back to prison to await<lb/> his trial.&#8221;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">This&#44; sir&#44; does not look much like cowardice.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Who&#44; I would ask&#44; in this community&#44; after hearing the outrages<lb/> committed upon an innocent and unoffending people&#44; but will sympa&#45;<lb/>thize for their sufferings&#63;  It is unnecessary for me to say any thing<lb/> in refutation of the charge of &#8220;Jews using the blood of Christians to<lb/> mix with their <date>Passover</date>&#45;bread&#8221; to my brethren here assembled&#44; or in<lb/> any part of the known world&#44; or to the enlightened and educated of<lb/> other religions.  But to disabuse the minds of the credulous and unin&#45;<lb/>formed in our laws&#44; who give credence to the statement&#44; I would<lb/> merely refer them to our sacred records&#44; The Five Books of <persName>Moses</persName>&#44; in<lb/> which the use of blood is strictly forbidden&#44; as stated in chap. vii. 26Th<lb/> and 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verses&#44; of Leviticus&#8212;&#8220;<hi rend="italics">Moreover ye shall eat no blood&#44; what&#45;<lb/>soever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood&#44; even that soul shall be<lb/> cut off from his people.</hi>&#8221;</p>

			<p rend="indent(1)">The educated and well&#45;informed Christians know from Holy Writ<lb/> the falsehood of the charge&#44; and many of the most respectable in <placeName>Eu&#45;<lb/>rope</placeName> have untied with the Jews in expressing their abhorrence of the<lb/> cruelties <sic>practised</sic> on them&#44; and their sympathies for their suffering&#59;<lb/> and are using their best endeavours to stay the hand of violence&#44; and<lb/> obtain for the persecuted ample justice from their oppressors.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">It gives me pleasure to perceive from many of the public journals&#44;<lb/> that this humane and sympathetic feeling is finding its way to the<lb/> bosoms of the worthy Christians of this enlightened and happy land.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">It is well known that during the <date>twelfth and thirteenth centuries</date> the<lb/> Jews were accused in <placeName>Europe</placeName> of crimes equally as atrocious as that<lb/> now brought against the Jews of <placeName>Damascus</placeName>&#44; and from <hi rend="italics">similar motives</hi>&#44;<lb/> a desire to <hi rend="italics">possess their estates</hi>&#44; and a hatred to their <hi rend="italics">religion from<lb/> bigotry</hi>.  In such times it was not to be wondered at&#59; but it is almost in&#45;<lb/>credible that in these enlightened times&#44; a man who represents the French<lb/> nation in the <placeName>East</placeName>&#44; should be found guilty of having the innocent Jews<lb/> subjected to the torture&#44; and that too without any evidence.  Had he<lb/> not lent his aid&#44; these barbarous cruelties would never have been in&#45;<lb/>flicted on our brethren.&#8212;It has been asked by many what benefit can<lb/> we in <placeName>America</placeName> bestow on our brethren who are suffering at such a dis&#45;<lb/>tance from us&#63;  Can there be any one who doubts or disbelieves that<lb/> the free expression of opinion and outpouring of sympathy&#44; from those<lb/> who reside in a country where every one acts and speaks as his judg&#45;<lb/>ment and conscience dictates&#44; will tend greatly to inspire confidence in<lb/> the sufferers&#44; and to strike terror into their persecutors&#63;  Tyrants are<lb/> ever cowards&#44; and though the evils we are now noticing may not be<lb/> wholly suppressed&#44; yet let us hope&#44; and we may do so with confidence&#44;<lb/> that the expressions of disgust and horror which have proceeded from<lb/> every portion of the civilized world&#44; and particularly from the <placeName>United<lb/> States</placeName>&#44; the only land of entire freedom&#44; will operate&#44; AS IT OUGHT&#44;<lb/> SPEEDILY&#59;&#8212;EVENTUALLY IT MUST.</p>

				<p>met for the purpose of publicly expressing our sympathy for those of<lb/> our brothers who&#44; living where the &#8220;bond of slavery twineth&#44;&#8221; have<lb/> lately been subjected to persecutions at which the blood runs cold&#44; and<lb/> this for the sake of false accusations brought against them&#44; not as men&#44;<lb/> but as members of the Jewish community.  Were it that they only<lb/> suffered unjustly&#44; even if the charge did not touch our ancient system<lb/> of faith&#44; still&#44; as sons of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; we ourselves would <hi rend="italics">feel</hi> the wrong that<lb/> they have unjustly to bear.  But now we have an additional incentive<lb/> to rouse our every feeling of commiseration and regret&#44; since the<lb/> religion&#44; which we profess in common with them&#44; has been stigmatized<lb/> as authorizing the shedding of human blood at the recurrence of the<lb/> annual <date>Passover</date>.  You may perhaps smile that such an absurd accu&#45;<lb/>sation should at all be made&#33; you may feel contempt at the ignorance<lb/> which could give credence to such superannuated folly&#33; but our smile<lb/> of derision&#44; our hearty contempt&#44; do not affect the mass who regard not<lb/> with kindness the remnant of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; and will not disarm the malice of<lb/> those who are only glad of every opportunity to send new sorrows to<lb/> our bosoms.&#8212;It is not the first time that it has been said and believed<lb/> that the Jews are commanded to slay their Christian neighbours&#59; and<lb/> at a time when the pestilence raged over almost the whole known<lb/> world&#44; our people were accused of causing the great destruction of<lb/> human life by poisoning the wells&#44; simply because in proportion to<lb/> numbers less Jews died than Christians.  The consequence was that<lb/> multitudes of the accused were butchered without pity&#44; and those whom<lb/> the <hi rend="italics">black death</hi> had spared fell a prey to the fury of an excited popu&#45;<lb/>lace&#44; rendered lawless by the prevalence of a fatal disorder&#44; which daily<lb/> hurried thousands to the tomb.  And whenever superstition and rapa&#45;<lb/>city wished to glut themselves in the destruction of our <sic>defenceless</sic><lb/> race&#44; the charge of murder for our religious rites was raised&#44; and&#44; as<lb/> was the case lately&#44; it was made the pretext for unsheathing the sword<lb/> and dooming countless numbers of innocent victims to merciless<lb/> slaughter.  O&#33; then were times of sorrow and affliction&#59; we wept&#44; but<lb/> no one pitied&#44; our gore rendered turbid the streams&#44; but all passed<lb/> carelessly by&#59; they heeded not our cries&#44; they regarded us aliens to<lb/> the rights of man&#44; outcasts from Divine favour.  Those were indeed<lb/> times when our harps were hung upon the willows&#59; when the voice of<lb/> wailing was heard in every home&#59; when the houses of prayer were<lb/> filled&#44; not with living <sic>worshippers</sic>&#44; but with the bodies of those slain<lb/> by the unpitying persecutor.  Whither then could we fly&#63;  We were<lb/> shunned as murderers&#44; as those unclean with leprosy&#44; as banished<lb/> from the pale of the laws&#59; and every land almost forbade us its bounda&#45;<lb/>ries&#44; every city almost shut its gates against our fugitives&#44; and where</p>

				<p>be the accounts related of him false or true&#44; was nevertheless the means<lb/> of the spread of a system analogous to our own over a large portion of<lb/> the pagan world&#59; he became&#44; though doubtlessly without himself<lb/> dreaming of such a result&#44; the messenger of better things to many who<lb/> knew not God.  Still was he a son of <persName>Abraham</persName>&#44; a professor of the<lb/> same religion we profess at this very hour&#59; and he enjoined&#44; if there be<lb/> any truth in the books said to contain an account of his life&#44; an<lb/> adherence to the law as it existed at his day&#59; at the same time all the<lb/> injunctions of brotherly love which he is said to have promulgated&#44; are<lb/> clearly referable to the Law of <persName>Moses</persName>&#44; and the sayings of our blessed<lb/> Rabbins.&#8212;After his death&#44; and centuries after his religion had begun<lb/> to spread&#44; there appeared another claiming affinity with our race&#44; and<lb/> pronounced himself inspired to teach better things to mankind&#59; and he<lb/> too founded his doctrines upon the Law of <persName>Moses</persName>&#44; even so far as to<lb/> <sic>recognise</sic>&#44; in addition to the unity of God&#44; a weekly day of rest and the<lb/> prohibition of certain articles of food&#44; besides the fundamental covenant<lb/> of <persName>Abraham</persName>.

But it surpasses belief&#44; that with the progress of<lb/> enlightened principles&#44; this absurd idea should have survived in its odious<lb/> deformity&#59; at a time&#44; too&#44; when <placeName>Spain</placeName>&#44; once the slave at the feet of an<lb/> inquisition&#44; demands a free constitution&#44; and when the new Sultan of<lb/> the Osmalins gives a new charter to his people&#44; who will doubtlessly in<lb/> future ages revere the name of <persName>Abdul Meschid</persName>&#44; whatever his fate now<lb/> may be in those mutations&#44; from which thrones are not exempt.&#8212;We<lb/> cannot be too much astonished at the folly or effrontery which&#44; at the<lb/> present day&#44; pretends to lend credence to a foul calumny which the bet&#45;<lb/>ter disposed&#44; during even the dark ages&#44; refused to entertain.  But so<lb/> it is&#44; the mass is ever ready to put faith in the <sic>marvellous</sic> and the ex&#45;<lb/>traordinary&#44; no matter if their absurdity should be apparent on the very<lb/> surface&#59; and all we can say is&#44; that with the progress of civilization<lb/> many have fallen behind the march of intellect in others&#44; and that hu&#45;<lb/>man nature is prone to err&#44; and this is an aggravated degree&#44; at all<lb/> ages of the world.  Were any proof of this wanting&#44; the recent tragic<lb/> scenes in <placeName>Damascus</placeName> and <placeName>Rhodes</placeName> would give ample confirmation.

				<p>here no one can demand of him a test&#45;oath to testify to that which he<lb/> inwardly disbelieves&#44; before he is permitted to fill a station for which<lb/> his talents qualify him.  Yet&#44; in many lands we are tolerated merely&#44;<lb/> and constitute not a part of the state&#44; as we do here and in a few other<lb/> enlightened countries.  So&#44; too&#44; in the dominions of the <persName>Pacha</persName> of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>&#44;<lb/> the renowned <persName>Mehemet Ali</persName>&#44; are we left unprotected by any law&#44; save<lb/> the will of the ruling chief&#44; or those who administer the government in<lb/> his name&#59; add to which that in the lands of the <placeName>East</placeName>&#44; human life is not<lb/> held sacred&#44; but is ever at the mercy of the despot&#44; and the possession<lb/> of wealth is often the passport to destruction.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Now it so happened&#44; as you already know&#44; that an old man disap&#45;<lb/>peared&#59; whether murdered or not no one has clearly shown&#59; and if<lb/> murdered&#44; it has not yet been proved&#44; as far as our knowledge extends&#44;<lb/> who his murderers are.  But our brothers in <placeName>Damascus</placeName> are wealthy&#44;<lb/> they are subject&#44; at the best of times&#44; to great cruelties and grinding<lb/> exactions&#59; and do you think that so favourable an opportunity for<lb/> pillage would be suffered to pass&#63;  Little would you know the spirit of<lb/> despotism&#44; if you were to think so&#59; for though ever ready to oppress&#44; it<lb/> greedily seizes every opportunity to give some colouring of justice to<lb/> its exactions.  The result has been what might naturally have been<lb/> expected.  One humble individual at first arrested upon the vaguest<lb/> suspicion&#44; was beaten till his tormentors could not do otherwise than<lb/> cease in the infliction&#59; he was taken back to prison&#44; and there tampered<lb/> with to induce him to accuse&#44; not those of a low degree like himself&#44;<lb/> but the first in wealth and learning which the city could furnish.<lb/>  They were seized and tortured&#59; some died under the excruciating pain<lb/> they had to endure&#59; others accused themselves guilty of the crime of<lb/> murdering the missing individual&#59; one adopted the Mussulman religion&#59;<lb/> whilst others&#44; patiently enduring the most intense suffering&#44; still clung<lb/> to the truth&#44; and refused making any confession of guilt in themselves<lb/> or others&#44; of which they were guiltless.  The name of one of these<lb/> noble martyrs has reached me&#44; it is <hi rend="italics"><persName>Mussa Salonikli</persName></hi>&#44; who adhered to<lb/> the protestation of his innocence&#44; when the endurance of others was<lb/> broken down.  Such a man deserves to be held in honourable remem&#45;<lb/>brance for future ages&#44; as an example of a true Israelite&#44; who exhibited<lb/> a filial confidence in his God under the greatest trials to which poor<lb/> mortality can be subjected.&#8212;But with the seizure of the first accused<lb/> the persecution did not stop&#59; others of the best and noblest were bar&#45;<lb/>barously maltreated&#44; and many children were thrown into prison&#44; and<lb/> kept upon miserable food&#44; to induce their parents to come forward and<lb/> accuse persons acceptable to the monster <persName>Sheriff Pacha</persName>&#44; who&#44; if report<lb/> speaks true&#44; must have known&#44; from the recantation of one who had</p>

				<p>embraced Moslemism&#44; that the charge of murder against our brothers<lb/> was no less false than foul.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">You may ask&#44; Why did not the Jews rise against their oppressors&#63;<lb/>  But&#44; Mr. Chairman&#44; ages of suffering deaden the spirit&#59; and they<lb/> render powerless the hands of those who otherwise might strike for<lb/> their own liberation&#59; faint&#45;heartedness has long&#44; therefore&#44; been the lot<lb/> of our brothers who languish under oppression&#44; and many have become<lb/> passive even under every cruelty.  We who&#44; under different circum&#45;<lb/>stances&#44; feel so very differently&#44; must not&#44; in the knowledge of our<lb/> security&#44; despise those whom adverse fortunes have so bowed down&#59;<lb/> on the contrary&#44; let us admire their patient endurances&#44; for having<lb/> remained true to our faith under every trial they had to undergo.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Let us from the midst of our thankfulness to God for having blessed<lb/> us so much more than we deserve&#44; express our sympathy for those who<lb/> suffer elsewhere&#59; those who&#44; with us&#44; are descended from the stock of<lb/> the Patriarchs.  But what need is there for this appeal&#63;  Around me<lb/> are those who have assembled for no other purpose than to express&#44; in<lb/> language not to be misunderstood&#44; that they feel for their brothers who<lb/> languish under the cruel bondage of oppression&#59; that every cry of<lb/> anguish uttered by their fellow&#45;believers elsewhere&#44; touches a sympa&#45;<lb/>thetic chord in their own hearts.&#8212;O&#44; this is a soothing reflection&#33; we<lb/> have no country of our own&#59; we have no longer a united government&#44;<lb/> under the shadow of which we can live securely&#59; but we have a tie<lb/> yet holier than a fatherland&#44; a patriotism stronger than the community<lb/> of one government&#59; our tie is a sincere brotherly love&#44; our patriotism<lb/> is the affection which unites the Israelite of one land to that of another.<lb/>  As citizens&#44; we belong to the country we live in&#59; but as believers in<lb/> one God&#44; as the faithful adorers of the Creator&#44; as the inheritors of the<lb/> law&#44; the Jews of <placeName>England</placeName>&#44; and <placeName>Russia</placeName>&#44; and <placeName>Sweden</placeName>&#44; are no aliens<lb/> among us&#44; and we hail the Israelite as a brother&#44; no matter if his home<lb/> be the torrid zone&#44; or where the poles encircle the earth with the impene&#45;<lb/>trable fetters of icy coldness.  We have therefore met for the purpose<lb/> of expressing our abhorrence of the calumny cast on our religion in<lb/> another part of the world&#44; and to offer our aid&#44; in conjunction with our<lb/> brothers in other towns both of this country and elsewhere&#44; to those who<lb/> have been subjected to such unmerited barbarities.  Perhaps the united<lb/> voice of all the professors of our blessed religion may reach the ears of<lb/> the potentates of the earth&#59; perhaps public attention may be roused to<lb/> the wrongs we have so long suffered&#44; and all acknowledge that our sys&#45;<lb/>tem is one of love and peace&#44; and that it is an essential point with us to<lb/> do our duty to the state no less than to observe the divine commands.<lb/>  If this should be the case&#44; if those differing from us would grant us</p>

				<p>everywhere an equality of rights not as apostates from&#44; but as adherents<lb/> to&#44; our ancient religion&#58; then indeed will the martyrs at <placeName>Damascus</placeName> not<lb/> have suffered in vain&#44; for their sorrows would then bring peace to<lb/> <placeName>Israel</placeName>.&#8212;Now&#44; Mr. Chairman&#44; is this hoping for too much&#63;  I hardly<lb/> think so.  Already the transaction which we deplore has raised up<lb/> advocates for us among our Christian friends&#59; and if the name of <persName>Rat&#45;<lb/>ti&#45;Menton</persName> will live in the disgrace which he so well merits&#44; the generous<lb/> <persName>Mr. Merlato</persName> at <placeName>Damascus</placeName>&#44; and <persName>Mr. Laurin</persName> at <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>&#44; who there<lb/> represent the <persName>Emperor</persName> of <placeName>Austria</placeName>&#44; will be remembered with gratitude<lb/> for their unsolicited exertions in our behalf.&#8212;In <placeName>England</placeName>&#44; too&#44; the sub&#45;<lb/>ject has awakened attention&#44; and one of its great minds&#44; who formerly<lb/> opposed our admission to equal rights&#44; the renowned <persName>Sir Robert Peel</persName>&#44;<lb/> has already thought proper to mention the case of the sufferers in par&#45;<lb/>liament&#44; with every demonstration that he too feels that a great wrong<lb/> has been done to an innocent people.  There too has been an <persName>O&#39;Connell</persName>&#44;<lb/> a <persName>Noel</persName>&#44; a <persName>Thompson</persName>&#44; and many others&#44; to speak in our behalf&#59; and<lb/> doubtlessly in this land too&#44; perhaps in this city&#44; men will step forward<lb/> to vindicate the rights of man outraged in the persons of the Jews at<lb/> <placeName>Damascus</placeName>.  Perhaps a voice too loud to remain unheeded may be raised<lb/> against the use of torture in trials&#44; and that the <persName>Pacha</persName> of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>&#44; in<lb/> whose dominions are <placeName>Damascus</placeName> and <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>&#44; may be induced to<lb/> abolish it altogether&#59; and so not we alone&#44; but all the inhabitants of<lb/> the earth&#44; may have cause to rejoice at the present movement in which<lb/> we are engaged&#44; though sorrow was its first promoter.  And why<lb/> should the case of the Jews be less attended to than that of the Greeks&#63;<lb/>  When the sons of ancient <placeName>Hellas</placeName> broke the chains of the Ottoman<lb/> power&#44; all <placeName>Europe</placeName> and <placeName>America</placeName> were awakened in their behalf&#59; but<lb/> have they any greater claim upon the sympathy of the world than we<lb/> have&#63;  We admit that the Greeks may have been the fathers of archi&#45;<lb/>tecture&#44; of painting&#44; of sculpture&#44; and of tragic poetry&#59; but the world is<lb/> indebted to us far more&#44; for a gift far nobler&#44; for the possession of the<lb/> Decalogue&#44; for the word of God&#44; the holy and precious Bible&#44; the book<lb/> more venerable than all books&#44; the parent of a pure belief&#44; the founda&#45;<lb/>tion of true human happiness&#44; of religion without bigotry&#44; of liberty<lb/> without licentiousness.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Another happy effect has already resulted from the same cause&#59; it<lb/> has awakened anew the spirit of brotherly love among us&#44; and we have<lb/> had an opportunity of experiencing that oceans may intervene between<lb/> our dispersed remnants&#44; that mountains may divide us&#44; but that yet the<lb/> Israelite is ever alive to the welfare of his distant brother&#44; and sorrows<lb/> with his sorrow&#44; and rejoices in his joy.  The times also have pro&#45;<lb/>duced spirits adequate to the emergency&#44; and a <persName>Cremieux</persName> of <placeName>Paris</placeName>&#44; and a<lb/> <persName>Montefiore</persName> of <placeName>London</placeName> will be long remembered as the generous&#44; active</p>

			<p rend="indent(1)">The have learned also&#44; with unfeigned horror&#44; that several prominent<lb/> men at <placeName>Damascus</placeName> have been seized by their ruthless persecutors&#44; and<lb/> tortured till some confessed themselves guilty of a crime which they<lb/> never committed&#59; and others died under the most exquisite barbarities&#44;<lb/> which ignorant bigotry&#44; urged by the love of plunder and hatred of the<lb/> Jewish name&#44; could invent.</p>

				<p>DEAR SIR&#44;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I learn from the papers of this morning&#44; that a meeting of your<lb/> people is to be held at the Synagogue&#44; next week&#44; to take into consi&#45;<lb/>deration the sufferings of the unhappy Israelites in the <placeName>East</placeName>.  As the<lb/> call is intended for none but Israelites&#44; there will of course be no<lb/> Christians there.  Had it been general&#44; I have no doubt their attend&#45;<lb/>ance would have been very large.  However&#44; perhaps it is best that<lb/> the first movement in the matter should be made among yourselves.<lb/>  As I shall not be present when you meet&#44; I write this to assure you of<lb/> my deep sympathy in the sufferings of your persecuted brethren&#44; and<lb/> of my hearty wishes for the speedy termination of their calamities.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I can speak for myself only with certainty&#59; but I feel persuaded that<lb/> the Christian community generally&#44; and the Christian clergy especially&#44;<lb/> will gladly and generously co&#45;operate with you in any plan you may<lb/> adopt for their relief.  As it regards myself&#44; allow me to say&#44; that if it<lb/> should be thought by you necessary to resort to any aid beyond what<lb/> you yourselves can give&#44; I will most cheerfully bring the case before<lb/> my congregation&#44; plead their cause before that kind&#45;hearted and gene&#45;<lb/>rous people&#44; and obtain from them all the assistance which they can<lb/> give.  I would not have obtruded this communication upon you&#44; but<lb/> that I thought it possible you might have some delicacy about applying<lb/> to your Christian friends for their co&#45;operation&#44; unless some intimation<lb/> were given that your appeal would be gladly and promptly responded<lb/> to by some at least.  It is not&#44; sir&#44; the cause of the <hi rend="italics">Jews</hi> only you are<lb/> about to espouse&#58; it is the cause of humanity.  And&#44; in reference as<lb/> well to their deliverance from almost unheard of sufferings&#44; as to their<lb/> spiritual condition&#44; I&#44; as a Christian&#44; can truly adopt the language of<lb/> one of the noblest of the apostles of your faith&#44; and say&#44; &#8220;My heart&#39;s<lb/> desire and prayers to God for <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; is&#44; that they might be saved.&#8221;</p>

				<p rend="align(center)"><persName>REV. MR. RAMSAY&#39;S</persName> REMARKS.    23</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">He was followed by the <persName>Rev. Mr. Ramsay</persName>&#44; of the Presbyterian<lb/> Church&#44; who said&#44;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Mr. President&#44; I gladly embrace your kind invitation to express&#44; thus<lb/> publicly&#44; my sympathy for the Jewish people&#44; in whose behalf you<lb/> are now met.  I fully concur with the <persName>Rev. Dr. Ducachet</persName>&#44; who has<lb/> preceded me&#44; in the remarks he has made&#44; and in the feelings he has<lb/> expressed.  My object in rising is not to detain you by any protracted<lb/> remarks that I have to make&#44; but merely to express for myself&#44; how<lb/> sincerely I sympathize with you in your affliction.  I feel persuaded&#44;<lb/> however&#44; that the same feeling pervades the breasts of all of my Chris&#45;<lb/>tian brethren in this city.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Sir&#44; I feel for the Jewish people.  I love them&#44; and have strong rea&#45;<lb/>sons for so doing.  In the providence of God I have been permitted to<lb/> mingle among them in the <placeName>East</placeName>&#44; and have always found them kind and<lb/> obliging.  When frowned upon by the haughty Mohammedan&#44; and<lb/> treated with scorn by the heathen&#44; I have always found the door of the<lb/> Jews open for my reception&#44; and have found a shelter under his hospita&#45;<lb/>ble roof.  I love them also for their Father&#39;s sake&#44; for they are the<lb/> children of the faithful <persName>Abraham</persName>&#59; yea&#44; I love them&#44; for they are my<lb/> brethren.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">As to the calumnies alleged against those in <placeName>Damascus</placeName>&#44; no candid<lb/> mind&#44; I think&#44; could for a moment entertain the idea that they are true.<lb/>  They cannot be.  I have&#44; however&#44; seen enough of Mohammedan inso&#45;<lb/>lence and oppression&#44; to know that the mere expression of our sympa&#45;<lb/>thies&#44; or that any interference on our part&#44; cannot reach the case of the<lb/> oppressed&#44; or awe their oppressors.  Something more powerful is<lb/> needed.  My only hope is in the Lord God of <persName>Abraham</persName>.  Your own pro&#45;<lb/>phet&#44; <persName>Ezekiel</persName>&#44; and ours&#44; &#40;for we hold to the same word of God&#44;&#41; speaking<lb/> by inspiration of God and promising blessings to <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; says&#44; &#8220;Yet&#44; for<lb/> this will I be inquired of by the house of <placeName>Israel</placeName> to do it for them.&#8221;  I<lb/> would&#44; therefore&#44; affectionately urge upon all present to unite with our<lb/> brethren&#44; Jews and Christians&#44; in looking up to the God of <placeName>Israel</placeName> for<lb/> aid.  Let us unite in prayer&#44; that God would break the oppressor&#39;s<lb/> arm so that the oppressed may go free.  Yea&#44; that He would banish<lb/> tyranny and oppression from the earth&#44; and that the whole family of<lb/> man may become&#44; as they ought to be&#44; one brotherhood.</p>

He had also expounded to them the Holy Law&#44;<lb/> exhibiting the entire falsehood of the charges alleged against the<lb/> wretched victims at <placeName>Damascus</placeName>.  The expressions of sympathy con&#45;<lb/>tained in the resolutions&#44; at once kindled the warm feelings of the gen&#45;<lb/>tlemen&#44; who&#44; though the advocates of other religious tenets&#44; <hi rend="italics">can</hi> feel<lb/> for their fellow&#45;creatures&#44; and they had outpoured their promises&#44; their<lb/> feelings&#44; and their hopes&#44; and it would be amiss were we to permit our<lb/> meeting to be here dissolved&#44; unless one of our own nation&#44; in some<lb/> measure at least&#44; responded to the remarks which had been so unex&#45;<lb/>pectedly&#44; though gratifyingly&#44; made to us.

			<p rend="indent(1)">Mr. Chairman&#44; the expression of public opinion will be heard even in<lb/> the land of the barbarians&#59; there are nations where public opinion is<lb/> moulded upon the will of the monarch&#44; and the opinion of such is not&#44;<lb/> of course&#44; as valued as the expression of free and <sic>untrammelled</sic><lb/> sentiments&#59; but in this happy country where every man is a monarch&#44;<lb/> where it is known that every man says what he thinks and feels&#44; the<lb/> utterance of public opinion is every where known to be sincere&#44; and<lb/> elsewhere it cannot fail to command universal respect.</p>
