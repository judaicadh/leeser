                they were calumniated had<lb/> been ascertained, but in this hope I have been sadly
                disappointed; I<lb/> will, therefore, now repeat every thing in detail, and it is
                thus:—</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">“On <date>Wednesday, the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> day of the month
                    Adar (February,)</date> there<lb/> disappeared from
                    <placeName>Damascus</placeName> a priest, who, with his servant, had dwelt<lb/>
                for forty years in this city; he exercised the profession of a physician,<lb/> and
                visited the houses of Catholics, Jews, and Armenians, for the pur-<lb/>pose of
                vaccination.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">“The day following (<date>Thursday</date>,) there came people into
                the quarter<lb/> of the Jews to look for him, stating that they had seen both him
                and<lb/> his servant on the previous day (<date>Wednesday</date>) in that quarter.
                In order<lb/> to put in execution their conspiracy, they seized a Jewish barber,
                tell-<lb/>ing him he must know all about the matter, and thence they
                imme-<lb/>diately carried him before the Governor, before whom they accused<lb/>
                him, and he instantly received five hundred stripes, and he was also<lb/> subjected
                to other cruelties. During the intervals between these inflic-<lb/>tions he was
                urged to accuse all the Jews as accomplices, and he, think-<lb/>ing by these means
                to relieve himself, accused <persName>Messrs. David Arari</persName>,<lb/>
                <persName>Isaac Arari</persName>, <persName>Aaron Arari</persName>, <persName>Joseph

                accomplices, who had<lb/> offered him three hundred piastres to murder the
                above-mentioned<lb/> priest, inasmuch as, the <date>Passover</date>-holydays
                approaching, they required<lb/> blood for their cakes; that he did not, however,

            <p>instigations while at the same time he knew not what might have<lb/> happened to the
                priest and his servant. Upon this the <persName>Pacha</persName> caused<lb/> the
                aforesaid traduced persons to be arrested as instigators, and punished<lb/> with
                blows and other torments of the most cruel nature; but as they<lb/> were innocent,
                they could not confirm as true that which was a<lb/> calumny, and therefore, in
                contradiction, they asserted their innocence,<lb/> appealing to the sacred writings,
                which strictly prohibit the Jews feed-<lb/>ing upon blood, much more that of a
                fellow-creature, a thing totally<lb/> repugnant to nature. Nevertheless, they were
                imprisoned, and daily,<lb/> with chains around their necks, there were inflicted on
                them the most<lb/> severe beatings and cruelties, and they were compelled to stand
                with-<lb/>out food of any kind for fifty hours together.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">“Subsequently to this the Hebrew butchers were cited to appear;<lb/>
                they were put in chains, together with the rabbins. <persName>Messrs. Jacob
                    An-<lb/>tier</persName>, <persName>Solomon Arari</persName>, and
                    <persName>Asaria Jalfon</persName>; and they, too, were beaten to<lb/> such an
                extreme that their flesh hung in pieces upon them; and these<lb/> atrocities
                perpetrated in order to induce them to confess whether or not<lb/> they used blood
                in the <date>Passover</date>-cakes, to which they replied, that, if<lb/> such had
                been the case, many Jewish proselytes would have published<lb/> the fact. This,
                however, was not sufficient. Subsequently to this,<lb/> the same Governor went to
                the college of the boys; he had them carried<lb/> to prison, loaded them with
                chains, and forbade the mothers to visit<lb/> their imprisoned children, to whom
                only ten drachms of bread and a<lb/> cup of water per day were allowed, the Governor
                expecting that the<lb/> fathers, for the sake of liberating their children, would
                confess the truth<lb/> of the matter.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">“After this, the Jew, who was still at liberty, presented himself
                be-<lb/>fore the Governor, stating that the calumny, that we make use of blood<lb/>
                for our <date>Passover</date>-cakes, had been discussed before all the powers,
                who,<lb/> after consulting their divines, had declared the falsehood of such a<lb/>
                calumny; and he added, that either others had killed the priest and his<lb/>
                servant, or that they had clandestinely absented themselves from the<lb/> country,
                and that the barber, to save himself from persecution, had<lb/> stated that which
                was not true.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">“Upon this the Governor replied, that as he had accused other
                per-<lb/>sons of killing them, he must know who were the murderers; and in<lb/>
                order that he should confess, he was beaten to such an extreme that he<lb/> expired
                under the blows.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">“After this, the Governor, with a body of six hundred men,
                pro-<lb/>ceeded to demolish the houses of his Jewish subjects, hoping to find
                the<lb/> bodies of the dead; but not finding any thing, he returned, and again<lb/>
                inflicted on his victims further castigations and torments, some of them</p>
            <pb n="7"/>
            <p rend="align(center)"><persName>MR HART'S</persName> REMARKS. 7</p>
            <p>too cruel and disgusting to be described. Incapable of bearing further<lb/> anguish,
                they preferred death, and confessed that the calumny was true.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">“The Governor, hearing the confession, asked them where they
                had<lb/> secreted the blood of the murdered man, to which one of them replied<lb/>
                that it had been put into a bottle, and delivered to <persName>Mr. Moses
                    Aboulafia</persName>,<lb/> who declared he knew nothing of it, and in order that
                he should confess<lb/> he received one thousand stripes; but this infliction not
                extorting his<lb/> confession, he was subjected to other insupportable torments,
                which at<lb/> length compelled him to declare that the bottle was at home in a
                chest<lb/> of drawers. Upon this the Governor ordered that he should be carried<lb/>
                on the shoulders of four men, (for he could not walk,) that he might<lb/> open the
                bureau. This was opened, but nothing was found in it, except<lb/> a quantity of
                money, which the Governor seized, asking him, at the<lb/> same time, where was the
                blood; whereupon the said <persName>Aboulafia</persName> replied,<lb/> that he made
                that statement in order that the Governor should see the<lb/> money in the bureau,
                trusting by these means to save himself from the<lb/> calumny. Upon this, the
                torments were repeated, and <persName>Aboulafia</persName>, to<lb/> save himself,
                embraced Mahometanism.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">“It is thus that they treated the whole; they have now been for
                one<lb/> month in this misery. In <placeName><sic>Beirout</sic></placeName>, and
                much more in <placeName>Damascus</placeName>, the<lb/> Jews are not at liberty to go
                out.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">“After this, an individual came forward and stated that, by
                means<lb/> of astrology, he had discovered and ascertained that the seven
                indivi-<lb/>duals above named assassinated the priest, and that the servant was<lb/>
                killed by <persName>Raphael Farhi</persName>, <persName>Nathan Levi</persName>,
                    <persName>Aaron Levi</persName>, <persName>Mordecai Farhi</persName>,<lb/> and
                    <persName>Asser</persName>, of <placeName>Lisbon</placeName>. The two first of
                these were immediately ar-<lb/>rested, the others, it appears, sought safety in

            <p rend="indent(1)">“You will judge from this, dear friends, what sort of justice is
                ad-<lb/>ministered by means of astrology, and how such justice is

            <p>Christians, by the heathens of the first three centuries, under which the<lb/> Jews
                of <placeName>Damascus</placeName> were now suffering even around us, and the
                bane-<lb/>ful effects which this report had produced among an ignorant and<lb/>
                bigoted population, it was immediately resolved amongst the members<lb/> of our
                mission, especially our worthy and revered <sic>superintendant</sic>,
                    <persName>Mr.<lb/> John Nicolayson</persName>, that I should forthwith go to
                    <placeName>Damascus</placeName>, in order, if<lb/> supported by the European
                consuls there, that I might give my testi-<lb/>mony that the Jewish religion, so far
                from requiring murder and the<lb/> use of blood, expressly forbids both; and to this
                fact I am prepared to<lb/> repeat in addition, in my own name, the famous oath of
                your illustrious<lb/>
                <persName>Manasseh Ben Israel</persName>. Whether the Jews had committed murder
                or<lb/> not, we could not decide at a distance; but what we wished to do was<lb/> to
                prevent the crime of one, or some, being made a national crime. I<lb/> was fixed on
                for this mission, as I was born a Jew, and was trained up<lb/> for the Rabbinical
                profession, and therefore best qualified, and as a<lb/> Christian, and by no means a
                friend to, or advocate of Rabbinism,<lb/> reasonably accepted as a witness in such a
                case. I will not describe<lb/> what my feelings were when at
                    <placeName>Damascus</placeName>. I found the whole charge<lb/> against them a
                fabrication, and that all means and right of legal<lb/>
                <sic>defence</sic> were denied them, while the most cruel tortures were
                employed<lb/> to extort from them false confessions of guilt, which some were
                cowards<lb/> enough to make. You are now in possession of the result of my<lb/>

                unless by exertions<lb/> of this and other meetings the facts be disproved; unless
                it be shown<lb/> that these accusations are not true, cannot be true, such things
                being<lb/> incompatible with our sacred and holy religion?</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">If such a calumny is not nipped in the bud, its effect will not be
                limited<lb/> to any particular place, but will be extended to every part of the

            <p rend="indent(1)">In <persName>Mr. Peiritz's</persName> letter he remarks, some were

                which I cannot in justice pass by unnoticed.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">It would not, sir, have surprised me, if all had made false
                confessions<lb/> of the improbable crimes imputed to them, after suffering the
                cruelties<lb/> of their inhuman tormentors; <hi rend="italics">but it is to be
                    wondered at</hi>, that so many,<lb/> or indeed any, should have endured
                unflinchingly; maintaining their<lb/> innocence notwithstanding their almost
                insufferable anguish; an in-<lb/>stance of which is cited in the reply from the
                chief Rabbi of the Jews<lb/> in <placeName>Damascus</placeName>, which is extracted
                from a letter dated <date>18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of June</date>:</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">“The chief Rabbi being requested to sign a confession of the
                murder,<lb/> said—'When you smote me with five hundred stripes all over my<lb/> body
                I would not confess to a lie; when you plunged me into a pool<lb/> of cold water for
                three hours on a winter's day, a drawn sword over<lb/> my head so that I could not
                raise it, I lied not; and when you inflicted<lb/> a hundred and seventy stripes on
                my hand, I would not utter a false-<lb/>hood; and when you drove the bones which you
                placed round my head<lb/> into my eyes to blind me, I still lied not, and spoke not
                this falsehood;<lb/> and now shall I sign to a lie?”</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The writer adds, “the Rabbi was then sent back to prison to
                await<lb/> his trial.”</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">This, sir, does not look much like cowardice.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Who, I would ask, in this community, after hearing the outrages<lb/>
                committed upon an innocent and unoffending people, but will sympa-<lb/>thize for
                their sufferings? It is unnecessary for me to say any thing<lb/> in refutation of
                the charge of “Jews using the blood of Christians to<lb/> mix with their
                    <date>Passover</date>-bread” to my brethren here assembled, or in<lb/> any part
                of the known world, or to the enlightened and educated of<lb/> other religions. But
                to disabuse the minds of the credulous and unin-<lb/>formed in our laws, who give
                credence to the statement, I would<lb/> merely refer them to our sacred records, The
                Five Books of <persName>Moses</persName>, in<lb/> which the use of blood is strictly
                forbidden, as stated in chap. vii. 26Th<lb/> and 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verses, of
                    Leviticus—“<hi rend="italics">Moreover ye shall eat no blood, what-<lb/>soever

            <p rend="indent(1)">It is well known that during the <date>twelfth and thirteenth
                    centuries</date> the<lb/> Jews were accused in <placeName>Europe</placeName> of
                crimes equally as atrocious as that<lb/> now brought against the Jews of

                enlightened times, a man who represents the French<lb/> nation in the
                    <placeName>East</placeName>, should be found guilty of having the innocent
                Jews<lb/> subjected to the torture, and that too without any evidence. Had he<lb/>
                not lent his aid, these barbarous cruelties would never have been in-<lb/>flicted on
                our brethren.—It has been asked by many what benefit can<lb/> we in
                    <placeName>America</placeName> bestow on our brethren who are suffering at such

                reside in a country where every one acts and speaks as his judg-<lb/>ment and
                conscience dictates, will tend greatly to inspire confidence in<lb/> the sufferers,
                and to strike terror into their persecutors? Tyrants are<lb/> ever cowards, and
                though the evils we are now noticing may not be<lb/> wholly suppressed, yet let us
                hope, and we may do so with confidence,<lb/> that the expressions of disgust and
                horror which have proceeded from<lb/> every portion of the civilized world, and
                particularly from the <placeName>United<lb/> States</placeName>, the only land of

            <p>met for the purpose of publicly expressing our sympathy for those of<lb/> our
                brothers who, living where the “bond of slavery twineth,” have<lb/> lately been
                subjected to persecutions at which the blood runs cold, and<lb/> this for the sake
                of false accusations brought against them, not as men,<lb/> but as members of the
                Jewish community. Were it that they only<lb/> suffered unjustly, even if the charge
                did not touch our ancient system<lb/> of faith, still, as sons of
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>, we ourselves would <hi rend="italics">feel</hi>
                the wrong that<lb/> they have unjustly to bear. But now we have an additional
                incentive<lb/> to rouse our every feeling of commiseration and regret, since
                the<lb/> religion, which we profess in common with them, has been stigmatized<lb/>
                as authorizing the shedding of human blood at the recurrence of the<lb/> annual
                    <date>Passover</date>. You may perhaps smile that such an absurd
                accu-<lb/>sation should at all be made! you may feel contempt at the ignorance<lb/>
                which could give credence to such superannuated folly! but our smile<lb/> of
                derision, our hearty contempt, do not affect the mass who regard not<lb/> with
                kindness the remnant of <placeName>Israel</placeName>, and will not disarm the
                malice of<lb/> those who are only glad of every opportunity to send new sorrows
                to<lb/> our bosoms.—It is not the first time that it has been said and believed<lb/>
                that the Jews are commanded to slay their Christian neighbours; and<lb/> at a time
                when the pestilence raged over almost the whole known<lb/> world, our people were
                accused of causing the great destruction of<lb/> human life by poisoning the wells,
                simply because in proportion to<lb/> numbers less Jews died than Christians. The
                consequence was that<lb/> multitudes of the accused were butchered without pity, and
                those whom<lb/> the <hi rend="italics">black death</hi> had spared fell a prey to
                the fury of an excited popu-<lb/>lace, rendered lawless by the prevalence of a fatal
                disorder, which daily<lb/> hurried thousands to the tomb. And whenever superstition
                and rapa-<lb/>city wished to glut themselves in the destruction of our
                    <sic>defenceless</sic><lb/> race, the charge of murder for our religious rites
                was raised, and, as<lb/> was the case lately, it was made the pretext for
                unsheathing the sword<lb/> and dooming countless numbers of innocent victims to
                merciless<lb/> slaughter. O! then were times of sorrow and affliction; we wept,
                but<lb/> no one pitied, our gore rendered turbid the streams, but all passed<lb/>
                carelessly by; they heeded not our cries, they regarded us aliens to<lb/> the rights
                of man, outcasts from Divine favour. Those were indeed<lb/> times when our harps
                were hung upon the willows; when the voice of<lb/> wailing was heard in every home;
                when the houses of prayer were<lb/> filled, not with living <sic>worshippers</sic>,
                but with the bodies of those slain<lb/> by the unpitying persecutor. Whither then
                could we fly? We were<lb/> shunned as murderers, as those unclean with leprosy, as
                banished<lb/> from the pale of the laws; and every land almost forbade us its
                bounda-<lb/>ries, every city almost shut its gates against our fugitives, and

                their true light of creatures of the imagina-<lb/>tion.—At a later period there
                arose one of our own community, who,</p>

            <p>be the accounts related of him false or true, was nevertheless the means<lb/> of the
                spread of a system analogous to our own over a large portion of<lb/> the pagan
                world; he became, though doubtlessly without himself<lb/> dreaming of such a result,
                the messenger of better things to many who<lb/> knew not God. Still was he a son of
                    <persName>Abraham</persName>, a professor of the<lb/> same religion we profess
                at this very hour; and he enjoined, if there be<lb/> any truth in the books said to
                contain an account of his life, an<lb/> adherence to the law as it existed at his
                day; at the same time all the<lb/> injunctions of brotherly love which he is said to
                have promulgated, are<lb/> clearly referable to the Law of
                    <persName>Moses</persName>, and the sayings of our blessed<lb/> Rabbins.—After
                his death, and centuries after his religion had begun<lb/> to spread, there appeared
                another claiming affinity with our race, and<lb/> pronounced himself inspired to
                teach better things to mankind; and he<lb/> too founded his doctrines upon the Law
                of <persName>Moses</persName>, even so far as to<lb/>
                <sic>recognise</sic>, in addition to the unity of God, a weekly day of rest and
                the<lb/> prohibition of certain articles of food, besides the fundamental
                covenant<lb/> of <persName>Abraham</persName>. Speedily persuasion and the sword
                banished, under his<lb/> guidance and that of his immediate successors, the worship
                of idols<lb/> from <placeName>Arabia</placeName>, <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
                    <placeName>Tartary</placeName>, and the far <placeName>India</placeName>; even
                    <placeName>Ethiopia</placeName>, the<lb/> coasts of
                    <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and <placeName>Spain</placeName>, nay, the very
                distant lands of the <placeName>Eastern<lb/> Archipelago</placeName>, and the
                countries beyond the great desert, yet inaccessible<lb/> almost to the European's
                foot, acknowledged the sway of the Koran,<lb/> and the Islam became the law of as
                large a portion of mankind as then<lb/> acknowledged the Christian Gospels.—Yet,
                take it as we will, these<lb/> two mighty revolutions in opinion were the effect of
                the religion of the<lb/> Jews, an adoption of an essential part, with the rejection
                of the cere-<lb/>monial laws, by many and powerful nations. In this manner then<lb/>
                were civilization and an enlightened philosophy indebted to the Jews,<lb/> or rather
                the code they then obeyed, and to this day obey, for much,<lb/> if not all their
                progress; and whatever of equality of rights, of mercy,<lb/> and benevolence, is now
                prevalent, we may freely say, has its founda-<lb/>tion in the Pentateuch, the law of
                the Jews. Does now the Christian<lb/> religion recommend human sacrifice? does the
                Koran command a<lb/> victim to be slain at the great festival of the Moslems? We
                know the<lb/> answer must be in the negative; nothing but ignorance,
                    <sic>wilful</sic> igno-<lb/>rance, could charge the Monotheists who are not Jews
                with the com-<lb/>mission of a crime so foreign to their belief. But does the Jewish
                law,<lb/> less than that of Christians or Mahomedans, demand the exercise of<lb/>
                mercy, forbid the commission of murder? We have yet to learn that<lb/> it does; for
                he who has no mercy is no son of <placeName>Israel</placeName>, and he who<lb/>
                pollutes his hands with human blood becomes a prey to the sword of<lb/> the avenger.
                We know of no difference between the Israelite and the</p>

                who, like us, bears the stamp of the human face divine, be<lb/> his opinions what
                they may; be he our friend or our enemy!</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">And yet, how much had we to suffer, because of the accusation
                that<lb/> we employed human blood, the blood of our Christian fellow-men, in<lb/>
                the celebration of the birth of our people! We ask, Where is the his-<lb/>torical
                evidence that such a thing ever took place? we demand, Where<lb/> is the permission
                to be discovered, I will not say in the Pentateuch, but<lb/> in any of our writings?
                To eat of the blood, nay, in the smallest<lb/> quantity, of a brute animal, is most
                energetically interdicted; and can<lb/> reason be so blinded as to suppose that we
                would mix human blood in<lb/> the unleavened bread, over which we call down the
                blessings of the Lord,<lb/> and return thanks for his manifold mercies to his people
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>?—We<lb/> will admit, that at a period when the
                rights of the subject were but im-<lb/>perfectly understood, when a pontiff could
                dispose of crowns as of eccle-<lb/>siastical benefices, when a mighty effort was
                made to enforce a uniform-<lb/>ity of opinions, when the iron-clad barons were not
                able to sign their<lb/> names, when might made right, and the dictum of one man
                could not<lb/> be disputed, except at the risk of life: it might have been supposed
                pos-<lb/>sible for the multitude to be deluded by the persuasion of those whose lead
                they followed, to believe any absurdity with regard to the Jews<lb/> who lived among
                them as outcasts from human rights, and whose sup-<lb/>posed wealth was always an
                object to be coveted by the lords no less<lb/> than by the rabble. But it surpasses
                belief, that with the progress of<lb/> enlightened principles, this absurd idea
                should have survived in its odious<lb/> deformity; at a time, too, when
                    <placeName>Spain</placeName>, once the slave at the feet of an<lb/> inquisition,
                demands a free constitution, and when the new Sultan of<lb/> the Osmalins gives a
                new charter to his people, who will doubtlessly in<lb/> future ages revere the name
                of <persName>Abdul Meschid</persName>, whatever his fate now<lb/> may be in those
                mutations, from which thrones are not exempt.—We<lb/> cannot be too much astonished
                at the folly or effrontery which, at the<lb/> present day, pretends to lend credence
                to a foul calumny which the bet-<lb/>ter disposed, during even the dark ages,
                refused to entertain. But so<lb/> it is, the mass is ever ready to put faith in the
                    <sic>marvellous</sic> and the ex-<lb/>traordinary, no matter if their absurdity
                should be apparent on the very<lb/> surface; and all we can say is, that with the
                progress of civilization<lb/> many have fallen behind the march of intellect in
                others, and that hu-<lb/>man nature is prone to err, and this is an aggravated
                degree, at all<lb/> ages of the world. Were any proof of this wanting, the recent
                tragic<lb/> scenes in <placeName>Damascus</placeName> and
                    <placeName>Rhodes</placeName> would give ample confirmation. You<lb/> must know,
                Mr. Chairman, that not every where have our rights been<lb/> acknowledged as in this
                happy land, happy for the Israelite, because</p>

            <p>here no one can demand of him a test-oath to testify to that which he<lb/> inwardly
                disbelieves, before he is permitted to fill a station for which<lb/> his talents
                qualify him. Yet, in many lands we are tolerated merely,<lb/> and constitute not a
                part of the state, as we do here and in a few other<lb/> enlightened countries. So,
                too, in the dominions of the <persName>Pacha</persName> of
                    <placeName>Egypt</placeName>,<lb/> the renowned <persName>Mehemet
                Ali</persName>, are we left unprotected by any law, save<lb/> the will of the ruling
                chief, or those who administer the government in<lb/> his name; add to which that in
                the lands of the <placeName>East</placeName>, human life is not<lb/> held sacred,
                but is ever at the mercy of the despot, and the possession<lb/> of wealth is often
                the passport to destruction.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Now it so happened, as you already know, that an old man
                disap-<lb/>peared; whether murdered or not no one has clearly shown; and if<lb/>
                murdered, it has not yet been proved, as far as our knowledge extends,<lb/> who his
                murderers are. But our brothers in <placeName>Damascus</placeName> are wealthy,<lb/>
                they are subject, at the best of times, to great cruelties and grinding<lb/>
                exactions; and do you think that so favourable an opportunity for<lb/> pillage would
                be suffered to pass? Little would you know the spirit of<lb/> despotism, if you were
                to think so; for though ever ready to oppress, it<lb/> greedily seizes every
                opportunity to give some colouring of justice to<lb/> its exactions. The result has
                been what might naturally have been<lb/> expected. One humble individual at first
                arrested upon the vaguest<lb/> suspicion, was beaten till his tormentors could not
                do otherwise than<lb/> cease in the infliction; he was taken back to prison, and
                there tampered<lb/> with to induce him to accuse, not those of a low degree like
                himself,<lb/> but the first in wealth and learning which the city could
                furnish.<lb/> They were seized and tortured; some died under the excruciating
                pain<lb/> they had to endure; others accused themselves guilty of the crime of<lb/>
                murdering the missing individual; one adopted the Mussulman religion;<lb/> whilst
                others, patiently enduring the most intense suffering, still clung<lb/> to the
                truth, and refused making any confession of guilt in themselves<lb/> or others, of
                which they were guiltless. The name of one of these<lb/> noble martyrs has reached
                me, it is <hi rend="italics"><persName>Mussa Salonikli</persName></hi>, who adhered
                to<lb/> the protestation of his innocence, when the endurance of others was<lb/>
                broken down. Such a man deserves to be held in honourable remem-<lb/>brance for
                future ages, as an example of a true Israelite, who exhibited<lb/> a filial
                confidence in his God under the greatest trials to which poor<lb/> mortality can be
                subjected.—But with the seizure of the first accused<lb/> the persecution did not
                stop; others of the best and noblest were bar-<lb/>barously maltreated, and many
                children were thrown into prison, and<lb/> kept upon miserable food, to induce their
                parents to come forward and<lb/> accuse persons acceptable to the monster
                    <persName>Sheriff Pacha</persName>, who, if report<lb/> speaks true, must have
                known, from the recantation of one who had</p>

            <p>embraced Moslemism, that the charge of murder against our brothers<lb/> was no less
                false than foul.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">You may ask, Why did not the Jews rise against their
                oppressors?<lb/> But, Mr. Chairman, ages of suffering deaden the spirit; and
                they<lb/> render powerless the hands of those who otherwise might strike for<lb/>
                their own liberation; faint-heartedness has long, therefore, been the lot<lb/> of
                our brothers who languish under oppression, and many have become<lb/> passive even
                under every cruelty. We who, under different circum-<lb/>stances, feel so very
                differently, must not, in the knowledge of our<lb/> security, despise those whom
                adverse fortunes have so bowed down;<lb/> on the contrary, let us admire their
                patient endurances, for having<lb/> remained true to our faith under every trial
                they had to undergo.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Let us from the midst of our thankfulness to God for having
                blessed<lb/> us so much more than we deserve, express our sympathy for those
                who<lb/> suffer elsewhere; those who, with us, are descended from the stock of<lb/>
                the Patriarchs. But what need is there for this appeal? Around me<lb/> are those who
                have assembled for no other purpose than to express, in<lb/> language not to be
                misunderstood, that they feel for their brothers who<lb/> languish under the cruel
                bondage of oppression; that every cry of<lb/> anguish uttered by their
                fellow-believers elsewhere, touches a sympa-<lb/>thetic chord in their own
                hearts.—O, this is a soothing reflection! we<lb/> have no country of our own; we
                have no longer a united government,<lb/> under the shadow of which we can live
                securely; but we have a tie<lb/> yet holier than a fatherland, a patriotism stronger
                than the community<lb/> of one government; our tie is a sincere brotherly love, our
                patriotism<lb/> is the affection which unites the Israelite of one land to that of
                another.<lb/> As citizens, we belong to the country we live in; but as believers
                in<lb/> one God, as the faithful adorers of the Creator, as the inheritors of
                the<lb/> law, the Jews of <placeName>England</placeName>, and
                    <placeName>Russia</placeName>, and <placeName>Sweden</placeName>, are no
                aliens<lb/> among us, and we hail the Israelite as a brother, no matter if his
                home<lb/> be the torrid zone, or where the poles encircle the earth with the
                impene-<lb/>trable fetters of icy coldness. We have therefore met for the
                purpose<lb/> of expressing our abhorrence of the calumny cast on our religion
                in<lb/> another part of the world, and to offer our aid, in conjunction with
                our<lb/> brothers in other towns both of this country and elsewhere, to those
                who<lb/> have been subjected to such unmerited barbarities. Perhaps the united<lb/>
                voice of all the professors of our blessed religion may reach the ears of<lb/> the
                potentates of the earth; perhaps public attention may be roused to<lb/> the wrongs
                we have so long suffered, and all acknowledge that our sys-<lb/>tem is one of love
                and peace, and that it is an essential point with us to<lb/> do our duty to the
                state no less than to observe the divine commands.<lb/> If this should be the case,
                if those differing from us would grant us</p>

            <p>everywhere an equality of rights not as apostates from, but as adherents<lb/> to, our
                ancient religion: then indeed will the martyrs at <placeName>Damascus</placeName>
                not<lb/> have suffered in vain, for their sorrows would then bring peace to<lb/>
                <placeName>Israel</placeName>.—Now, Mr. Chairman, is this hoping for too much? I
                hardly<lb/> think so. Already the transaction which we deplore has raised up<lb/>
                advocates for us among our Christian friends; and if the name of
                    <persName>Rat-<lb/>ti-Menton</persName> will live in the disgrace which he so
                well merits, the generous<lb/>
                <persName>Mr. Merlato</persName> at <placeName>Damascus</placeName>, and
                    <persName>Mr. Laurin</persName> at <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, who
                there<lb/> represent the <persName>Emperor</persName> of
                    <placeName>Austria</placeName>, will be remembered with gratitude<lb/> for their
                unsolicited exertions in our behalf.—In <placeName>England</placeName>, too, the
                sub-<lb/>ject has awakened attention, and one of its great minds, who formerly<lb/>
                opposed our admission to equal rights, the renowned <persName>Sir Robert
                    Peel</persName>,<lb/> has already thought proper to mention the case of the
                sufferers in par-<lb/>liament, with every demonstration that he too feels that a
                great wrong<lb/> has been done to an innocent people. There too has been an
                    <persName>O'Connell</persName>,<lb/> a <persName>Noel</persName>, a
                    <persName>Thompson</persName>, and many others, to speak in our behalf; and<lb/>
                doubtlessly in this land too, perhaps in this city, men will step forward<lb/> to
                vindicate the rights of man outraged in the persons of the Jews at<lb/>
                <placeName>Damascus</placeName>. Perhaps a voice too loud to remain unheeded may be
                raised<lb/> against the use of torture in trials, and that the
                    <persName>Pacha</persName> of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, in<lb/> whose
                dominions are <placeName>Damascus</placeName> and <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>,
                may be induced to<lb/> abolish it altogether; and so not we alone, but all the
                inhabitants of<lb/> the earth, may have cause to rejoice at the present movement in
                which<lb/> we are engaged, though sorrow was its first promoter. And why<lb/> should
                the case of the Jews be less attended to than that of the Greeks?<lb/> When the sons
                of ancient <placeName>Hellas</placeName> broke the chains of the Ottoman<lb/> power,
                all <placeName>Europe</placeName> and <placeName>America</placeName> were awakened
                in their behalf; but<lb/> have they any greater claim upon the sympathy of the world
                than we<lb/> have? We admit that the Greeks may have been the fathers of
                archi-<lb/>tecture, of painting, of sculpture, and of tragic poetry; but the world
                is<lb/> indebted to us far more, for a gift far nobler, for the possession of
                the<lb/> Decalogue, for the word of God, the holy and precious Bible, the book<lb/>
                more venerable than all books, the parent of a pure belief, the founda-<lb/>tion of
                true human happiness, of religion without bigotry, of liberty<lb/> without
                licentiousness.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Another happy effect has already resulted from the same cause;
                it<lb/> has awakened anew the spirit of brotherly love among us, and we have<lb/>

            <p>friends of their people, who nobly volunteered to plead the cause of<lb/> their
                brothers in distant lands. Let us trust that the Lord may pros-<lb/>per their way,
                and bring them back to their families after the happy<lb/> termination of their
                mission of love.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">It is now, Mr. Chairman, as ever it was; although banished and
                scat-<lb/>tered over every land for our manifold transgression, we are not cast<lb/>
                off nor utterly forsaken by our God. He has been our shield, as He<lb/> was the
                shield of our forefathers; and as out of every evil He always<lb/> caused good to
                spring unto <placeName>Israel</placeName>, so let us hope that this present
                occa-<lb/>sion may not pass away without a proportionate benefit accruing unto<lb/>
                us and the world at large, under the dispensation of His Providence. I<lb/> say
                “unto us and the world at large;” for our cause is not the cause<lb/> of faction,
                and when we prosper it is not for the oppression of any<lb/> human being, for never
                yet were our people persecutors for opinion's<lb/> sake, for the law of God was
                always a code of toleration and benevo-<lb/>lence; and then, the more the knowledge
                of the truth spreads, the more<lb/> it is understood, the stronger will be the
                feeling of attachment which<lb/> will unite all the inhabitants of the earth as a
                nation of brothers.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I will repeat the words of the wise<lb/>
                <persName>Solomon</persName>, invoking the blessing of our heavenly Father upon us
                and<lb/> our undertaking: “The Lord our God be with us, as He was with<lb/> our

                Him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his com-<lb/>mandments, his statutes and
                judgments which He commanded our<lb/> fathers.”</p>

                living in a land where, under<lb/> the blessing of Providence, equality of civil and

                for opinion's sake:<lb/> still they cannot rest while so foul a blot is cast upon
                their ancient and<lb/> sacred faith, a faith on which both the Christian and
                Mahomedan reli-<lb/>gions are founded, and which is essentially a law of justice, of
                mercy,<lb/> and benevolence; and they would deem themselves traitors to
                brotherly<lb/> love and the rights of outraged humanity, were they to withhold
                their<lb/> expression of sympathy for their suffering brethren, who writhe

            <p>DEAR SIR,</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I learn from the papers of this morning, that a meeting of your<lb/>
                people is to be held at the Synagogue, next week, to take into consi-<lb/>deration
                the sufferings of the unhappy Israelites in the <placeName>East</placeName>. As
                the<lb/> call is intended for none but Israelites, there will of course be no<lb/>
                Christians there. Had it been general, I have no doubt their attend-<lb/>ance would
                have been very large. However, perhaps it is best that<lb/> the first movement in
                the matter should be made among yourselves.<lb/> As I shall not be present when you
                meet, I write this to assure you of<lb/> my deep sympathy in the sufferings of your
                persecuted brethren, and<lb/> of my hearty wishes for the speedy termination of
                their calamities.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I can speak for myself only with certainty; but I feel persuaded
                that<lb/> the Christian community generally, and the Christian clergy
                especially,<lb/> will gladly and generously co-operate with you in any plan you
                may<lb/> adopt for their relief. As it regards myself, allow me to say, that if
                it<lb/> should be thought by you necessary to resort to any aid beyond what<lb/> you
                yourselves can give, I will most cheerfully bring the case before<lb/> my
                congregation, plead their cause before that kind-hearted and gene-<lb/>rous people,
                and obtain from them all the assistance which they can<lb/> give. I would not have
                obtruded this communication upon you, but<lb/> that I thought it possible you might
                have some delicacy about applying<lb/> to your Christian friends for their
                co-operation, unless some intimation<lb/> were given that your appeal would be
                gladly and promptly responded<lb/> to by some at least. It is not, sir, the cause of
                the <hi rend="italics">Jews</hi> only you are<lb/> about to espouse: it is the cause
                of humanity. And, in reference as<lb/> well to their deliverance from almost unheard
                of sufferings, as to their<lb/> spiritual condition, I, as a Christian, can truly
                adopt the language of<lb/> one of the noblest of the apostles of your faith, and
                say, “My heart's<lb/> desire and prayers to God for <placeName>Israel</placeName>,
                is, that they might be saved.”</p>

                now, for<lb/> the first time for centuries, was a Christian minister addressing a

                spirit of prophecy, that relief would<lb/> come, “the oppressors arm would be broken
                and the oppressed go<lb/> free.” He cited instances of Divine vengeance against
                those who had<lb/> pursued a similar course of conduct, and concluded by proferring
                the<lb/> kind sympathies, the pecuniary assistance, and moral influence of the<lb/>
                Christian community, to aid in the worthy cause for which the Israelites<lb/> had
                called this meeting.</p>

            <p rend="indent(1)">He was followed by the <persName>Rev. Mr. Ramsay</persName>, of the
                Presbyterian<lb/> Church, who said,</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Mr. President, I gladly embrace your kind invitation to express,
                thus<lb/> publicly, my sympathy for the Jewish people, in whose behalf you<lb/> are
                now met. I fully concur with the <persName>Rev. Dr. Ducachet</persName>, who
                has<lb/> preceded me, in the remarks he has made, and in the feelings he has<lb/>
                expressed. My object in rising is not to detain you by any protracted<lb/> remarks
                that I have to make, but merely to express for myself, how<lb/> sincerely I
                sympathize with you in your affliction. I feel persuaded,<lb/> however, that the
                same feeling pervades the breasts of all of my Chris-<lb/>tian brethren in this
                city.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Sir, I feel for the Jewish people. I love them, and have strong
                rea-<lb/>sons for so doing. In the providence of God I have been permitted to<lb/>
                mingle among them in the <placeName>East</placeName>, and have always found them
                kind and<lb/> obliging. When frowned upon by the haughty Mohammedan, and<lb/>
                treated with scorn by the heathen, I have always found the door of the<lb/> Jews
                open for my reception, and have found a shelter under his hospita-<lb/>ble roof. I
                love them also for their Father's sake, for they are the<lb/> children of the
                faithful <persName>Abraham</persName>; yea, I love them, for they are my<lb/>
                brethren.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">As to the calumnies alleged against those in
                    <placeName>Damascus</placeName>, no candid<lb/> mind, I think, could for a
                moment entertain the idea that they are true.<lb/> They cannot be. I have, however,
                seen enough of Mohammedan inso-<lb/>lence and oppression, to know that the mere
                expression of our sympa-<lb/>thies, or that any interference on our part, cannot
                reach the case of the<lb/> oppressed, or awe their oppressors. Something more
                powerful is<lb/> needed. My only hope is in the Lord God of
                    <persName>Abraham</persName>. Your own pro-<lb/>phet,
                    <persName>Ezekiel</persName>, and ours, (for we hold to the same word of God,)
                speaking<lb/> by inspiration of God and promising blessings to
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>, says, “Yet, for<lb/> this will I be inquired of
                by the house of <placeName>Israel</placeName> to do it for them.” I<lb/> would,
                therefore, affectionately urge upon all present to unite with our<lb/> brethren,
                Jews and Christians, in looking up to the God of <placeName>Israel</placeName>
                for<lb/> aid. Let us unite in prayer, that God would break the oppressor's<lb/> arm
                so that the oppressed may go free. Yea, that He would banish<lb/> tyranny and
                oppression from the earth, and that the whole family of<lb/> man may become, as they
                ought to be, one brotherhood.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">You have, Sir, I repeat it, my sincere sympathy in this matter,
                and<lb/> aid so far as I can yield it.</p>

            <p>mined to be a silent listener, nor would he now obtrude himself or his<lb/> remarks
                upon its attention, had any one else risen at this time for such<lb/> purpose; but
                little able at any time to do justice to the matter, he was<lb/> peculiarly unfit
                just now, suffering, as he was, from the debility inci-<lb/>dent to protracted
                indisposition; but (said <persName>Mr. P.</persName>) the occasion seemed<lb/> to me
                to call for something in conclusion from one of <hi rend="italics">our nation</hi>,
                and<lb/> therefore he had now risen. He continued: the meeting was our own, but<lb/>
                we were gratified that the privilege of introduction had been embraced<lb/> so as to
                introduce to our acquaintance the reverend gentleman who had<lb/> so liberally and
                kindly expressed their sympathies for our unhappy and<lb/> suffering brethren, and
                who had promised assistance from sources<lb/> where it could not have been expected
                nor looked for, and was there-<lb/>fore the more gladly accepted, since it was
                offered voluntarily, dis-<lb/>interestedly; nor can I permit myself to doubt that
                the benevolent feel-<lb/>ings avowed here, are felt as sincerely as professed. The
                business of<lb/> the meeting was our own. One of ourselves (<persName>Mr.
                    Hart</persName>) had eloquently<lb/> unfolded its objects at the opening of the
                meeting, and our reverend<lb/> pastor (<persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>) had followed
                in detail of the barbarous cruelties<lb/> and outrages, the recital of which could
                not fail to arouse every<lb/> virtuous indignation. He had also expounded to them
                the Holy Law,<lb/> exhibiting the entire falsehood of the charges alleged against
                the<lb/> wretched victims at <placeName>Damascus</placeName>. The expressions of
                sympathy con-<lb/>tained in the resolutions, at once kindled the warm feelings of
                the gen-<lb/>tlemen, who, though the advocates of other religious tenets, <hi
                    rend="italics">can</hi> feel<lb/> for their fellow-creatures, and they had
                outpoured their promises, their<lb/> feelings, and their hopes, and it would be
                amiss were we to permit our<lb/> meeting to be here dissolved, unless one of our own
                nation, in some<lb/> measure at least, responded to the remarks which had been so
                unex-<lb/>pectedly, though gratifyingly, made to us. And most peculiarly does<lb/>
                this seem to be a duty, being, as we are, in a country where the enjoy-<lb/>ment of
                full liberty is real and not theoretical.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">It is not my intention, (said <persName>Mr. P.</persName>) to go
                over the ground which<lb/> has been so well covered already, I merely wish to remind
                those whom<lb/> I see assembled around me, of the occasion which calls us here,
                and<lb/> the results which ought to, and will follow our assemblage. We are<lb/> not
                here for ostentation or any vain purposes; we are not here for the<lb/> purpose of
                mere self-respect; but we are convened as Israelites and as<lb/> men, to express
                freely our views and sentiments, in relation to matters<lb/> in which our religious
                feelings and our humanity are alike interested.<lb/> Is there one here who believes
                that the oppressors are punishing for<lb/> the causes which they allege? An aged

                    rend="italics">actual</hi> participation in the murder of one<lb/> individual,
                and the insincerity of the accusers can be at once known<lb/> by the <hi

                mur-<lb/>derers, nor was even a murderer's trial granted to their poor victims,<lb/>
                but they were hurried to tortures; the hearts of mothers were wrung<lb/> by the

                that their object is to obtain the worldly possessions of<lb/> their victims, and to
                annihilate (so far as they can,) what <hi rend="italics">we</hi> have<lb/> been
                taught to believe are the doctrines of the true faith.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">We may do much good from our assemblage of to-night: we may<lb/>
                heretofore have expressed our sympathies, and freely unfolded our feel-<lb/>ings to

            <p rend="indent(1)">Mr. Chairman, the expression of public opinion will be heard even

                moulded upon the will of the monarch, and the opinion of such is not,<lb/> of
                course, as valued as the expression of free and <sic>untrammelled</sic><lb/>
                sentiments; but in this happy country where every man is a monarch,<lb/> where it is
                known that every man says what he thinks and feels, the<lb/> utterance of public
                opinion is every where known to be sincere, and<lb/> elsewhere it cannot fail to
                command universal respect.</p>
