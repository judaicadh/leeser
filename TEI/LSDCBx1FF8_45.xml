          <p rend="indent(4)">Your favor of <date>May 6th</date><lb/> came duly to hand giving much regret at<lb/> the ingratitude practiced towards you. But<lb/> you have that written which must baffle all<lb/> all the efforts of your enemies&#59; the cannot<lb/> eqult<add>&#63;</add> long and in their exultation of &#40;what<lb/> they may <hi rend="underline">term</hi> your defeat&#41; they must be<lb/> condemned by the <add>&#63;</add> and more enlight&#45;<lb/>ened portion of the world to which your<lb/> devotion to their service has been known<lb/> I trust that your literary efforts will meet<lb/> with more <hi rend="underline">praising</hi><add>&#63;</add> encouragement<lb/> than they do here&#58; the few readers there are<lb/> are unwilling to pay for knowledge&#44; in<lb/> part&#44; with few exceptions&#44; they are not a<lb/> people to be depended on. <persName>Mr Laruton</persName> has<lb/> changed his mind on his contemplated visit<lb/> to the <placeName>States</placeName>&#59; he&#44; <add>&#63;</add> your parcel but as the</p>

I showed him your letter to which<lb/> he replied that he could sell as many of your<lb/> works &#40;naming the purchasers&#41; as to remit<lb/> you &#36;80. but could not under sell them<lb/> without your sanction. I requested him to<lb/> communicate the same to you by the<lb/> Steamer&#59; but fearing he has not done so&#59; I<lb/> feel it necessary to make you acquainted with<lb/> it. According to his account the books are somewhat<lb/> injured&#59; my advice would be to take what you<lb/> can get for them&#44; and after that charge your full<lb/> price for new ones. Great complaint at the high<lb/> price of your publications I friend to literature<lb/> told me that he thought you would <del>effect</del> confer<lb/> more benefit <del>to</del> on yourself and the public<lb/> by sending out your magazines in the way that<lb/> <placeName>Chambers</placeName> does. Let them be sold by numbers</p>

My literary friend would<lb/> rather feast on a good substantial work<lb/> than all the dainties of the universe. In<lb/> fact were it not for his librarying<lb/> mind &#40;to use your own adage&#41; would long<lb/> since have gone to vast so much am I indebt&#45;<lb/>ed to my friend <persName>Mr Heyman Cohen Del<add>&#63;</add></persName>&#59;<lb/> a young gentleman of good parts&#59; clear mind<lb/> and would by little practice be a fine lec&#45;<lb/>turer&#59; <add>&#63;</add> for the world he is only the merchant.<lb/> I should like to hear some publications of<lb/> your honorable successor <persName>Mr. Morais.</persName> How<lb/> strange it will appear to me should I reform&#44;<lb/> to see another occupying your place. <persName>Louisa</persName><lb/> seems to regret much the state of affairs<lb/> when she last wrote. <persName>Mrs H</persName> has not said<lb/> anything on the subject but that was owing<lb/> to the melancholy state of my feelings.
