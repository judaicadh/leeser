JEWISH RELIGION. 



DISCOUESE I. 



THE GOD OF ISRAEL. 



O Thou only One&#44; to whom peculiarly appertains 
the essence of eternity&#44; who wast&#44; who art&#44; and who 
wilt be &#33; come&#44; and let thy holiness dwell in our 
midst&#44; among the children of Israel&#44; who sanctify 
Thee only&#44; and rejoice in thy praise. 0&#44; how infinite 
art Thou&#33; Thou wast from the beginning&#59; and the 
revolutions of ages&#44; the mutations of all created things&#44; 
have found no change in Thee. And thy Word&#44; too&#44; 
has stood fast&#44; and been upheld above all that is on 
earth&#59; and it has subdued empires&#44; and is still going 
on conquering the wayward will of man&#44; humbling 
the stubborn sinners before thy might. And the 
same&#44; as Thou once didst reveal thyself to the father 
of the prophets&#44; we find Thee to be by our daily ex&#8211; 
perience. Thou saidst&#44; &#34; I will be hath sent me to 
you&#59;&#34; and even now there is no abatement of thy

power&#44; and thy vigour is imdimiiiislied&#44; as also is tliy 
boiiiily unabated&#44; and the same goodness is now ex&#8211; 
tended over thy children as that which they experi&#8211; 
enced in the commencement of their call to thy ser&#8211; 
vice. O Father&#33; let this truth he deeply impressed 
on our minds&#59; till us so entirely with thy spirit&#44; that 
we may discover thy exalted wisdom in all thy ways&#44; 
that prosperity may not elevate us above the duties 
we owe unto Thee&#44; and that tribulations may draw 
us closer to the sheltering Rock&#44; even thyself&#44; O God 
of truth&#33; to seek protection from Thee alone&#44; who 
hast power to save&#44; and to ask for comfort from Thee&#44; 
the only One&#44; who art the Lord of consolations&#44; the 
Shield of Abraham&#44; who wilt send the redeemer to 
thy people&#44; to rescue them from the yoke of their ene&#8211; 
mies&#44; even as Thou didst send Moses in ancient days 
to free them from the hibour of Pharaoh. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

Let us once more revert to a contemplation of the 
peculiarities of our faith&#44; which distinguish it from 
the other systems which mankind have adopted at 
various times&#44; as their means of seeking happiness. 
When we start in life&#44; say without any instruction 
even&#44; we must nevertheless soon discover that we 
are&#44; individually&#44; not more potent than are other be&#8211; 
ings whom we meet with&#59; but that we are weak&#44; 
subject to diseases&#44; destined for death&#44; just as others 
are &#59; for we came into the world powerless like other 
infants&#44; and only grew to our present stature and 
mental development by imperceptible degrees&#44; like 
other men. In health&#44; we may perhaps deem our&#8211; 
selves invulnerable&#59; prosperity may iuiluence us with

the idea of a species of independence&#44; a vague no&#8211; 
tion of our self&#8211;sufficiency&#59; but let sickness assail 
us&#44; let our success be overthrown by adversity&#44; and 
we at once acknowledge that our strength is de&#8211; 
rived&#44; not inherent in our nature &#59; that our pros&#8211; 
perity was granted&#44; not depending on our own will &#59; 
and&#44; consequently&#44; that of our own selves we cannot 
lay claim to any of the gifts we enjoy&#44; nay&#44; not to 
the very breath which is in our nostrils. Hence 
we are led to the reflection that&#44; as we are like all 
other men on earth&#44; that&#44; as they are not superior to 
us any more than we are superior to them&#44; no one 
who bears the same outward appearance with us &#8212; 
that is to say&#44; neither ourselves nor any other human 
beings &#8212; can be the authors of our happiness&#44; and 
that&#44; in consequence&#44; we are necessarily dependent 
upon a higher Power for whatever we enjoy. So&#44; 
then&#44; the first inquiry which any thinking mind is 
led to make will bring him to the acknowledgment 
of a Being who is his superior&#59; and as this Being 
needs must be powerful&#44; because of the display of his 
superiority&#44; man in his helplessness is induced to ask 
Him for aid on any occasion where he finds that his 
own strength does not suffice to obtain what he needs&#44; 
&#8212; or&#44; in other words&#44; the worship of a superior Power 
is natural to man. But this does not say that his 
ideas must necessarily be based upon what we call a 
correct standard&#44; or that he will assimilate with us 
in the acknowledgment of a uniform&#44; all&#8211;pervading 
Being&#44; who created&#44; sustains&#44; and governs all from 
the beginning of things unto the present moment&#59; 
for this is a depth of discovery at which man can 
scarcely arrive by his own reflection. On the con&#8211;

brilliant sun&#44; the dispenser of light and heat&#44; seated&#44; 
as it were&#44; upon the highest throne of visible beings&#58; 
and he fancies that in this beneficent star there is 
placed the power to bless and to vivify all labours&#44; as 
without the presence of his heat in due season the 
harvest is blasted&#44; the vintage is withered&#44; and the 
olives rot on their branches&#59; and&#44; not heeding that 
the sun also is a creature&#44; he erects to him temples 
and altars&#44; and represents him as a man in the prime 
of life&#44; possessed of vigour and high intellect&#44; and 
calls on him on the day of trouble&#44; and says unto him&#44; 
&#34;Save me&#44; for thou art my father&#33;&#34; &#8212; Or he sees&#44; 
when the light of day has vanished&#44; and he wanders 
forth in the gloom of night on the dark and cheerless 
road where lies his way&#44; the splendid orb of the moon 
elevating itself slowly and majestically above the dis&#8211; 
tant hills&#44; and he is cheered by the mild effulgence 
which is scattered around over mountain and valley&#59; 
and he rejoices that he is thus blessed&#44; and he thanks 
in his heart the dispenser of his joy. But lie again 
thinks not of the Creator who hung the lesser Inmin&#8211; 
ary in the wide expanse&#44; to give light on earth during 
the hours of night&#59; and he fancies that the star her&#8211; 
self has power&#59; and to her also he consecrates groves 
and temples&#44; and appoints priests to interpret the will 
of the goddess whom he deems endowed with strength&#44; 
and vows to her sacrifices&#44; to propitiate for himself 
the iavour of the guardian of his sleeping hours. &#8212; 
And in like manner will it probably be for every ex&#8211; 
hibition of power which he may discover in nature&#58; 
each individual exhibiting it is to liim a source of joy 
and of terror. &#8212; Time&#44; in his irresistible progress&#44; de&#8211;

imbued with uncontrollable strength over all who 
launch their bark on his waves &#59; the lire&#44; which is so 
powerful in subjecting Nature to the service of man&#44; 
is to him an object of reverence and of fear&#59; its be&#8211; 
neficence&#44; as well as its devastations&#44; must be propi&#8211; 
tiated &#59; and for its dwelling the centre of the earth is 
considered the fitting place&#44; and the craters of burn&#8211; 
insf mountains are viewed as entrances to its domin&#8211; 
ion &#59; the earth herself&#44; as the sustainer of life&#44; and 
unchanging as she is in her aspect and the regularity 
with which she performs all her functions&#44; is also 
viewed as the progenitor of all the other powers 
which are derived from her&#44; according to their nature. 
The various passions which agitate the human soul&#44; 
be they love&#44; hatred&#44; mercy&#44; justice&#44; envy&#44; or any 
other&#44; are likewise exhibitions which claim a regard 
from the untutored son of earth&#44; who beholds in them 
powers uncontrollable by him&#44; to which&#44; however&#44; he 
himself is subject during his sojourn in the world. 
So&#44; the calamities of war and death&#44; the blessings of 
peace&#44; plenty&#44; and life&#44; become personified as beings 
to be adored&#44; and as exercising an influence over the 
affairs of man. In short&#44; all the phases of outward 
Nature become instinct with a controlling direction 
over the beings whose lot is cast on the earth &#59; and 
if man once leaves out of sight that all we see owes 
its origin to one Cause&#44; every subordinaie force hecoraes 
naturally a something which can injure or benefit the 
powerless mortal &#59; powerless&#44; I say&#44; because&#44; from the 
dny of his birth to that of his dissolution&#44; time&#44; and 
fear&#44; and heat&#44; and cold&#44; disease and joy&#44; pleasure and

his &#40;lays&#44; and will at length be folloAved by death&#44; to 
finish his existence&#44; should he have even successfully 
resisted all the ills which flesh is heir to&#44; to an age 
which exceeds that of all other men. But&#44; even then&#44; 
even to the child of nature&#44; there is a something be&#8211; 
yond&#44; a controlling influence&#44; which guides what is 
immortal in us&#59; and imaginative man&#44; therefore&#44; has 
invested the kingdom of the shades with its judges 
and its terrors&#44; its Elysium and its Tartarus&#44; not&#44; per&#8211; 
haps&#44; in accordance with the sober light of reason&#44; 
but because there is a law impressed on the essence 
of our soul&#44; which teaches us&#44; &#34;I shall not totally 
die.&#34; The idea of annihilation&#44; an entire extinction 
of the vital spark&#44; is abhorrent to the perfect work 
which we find developed in our moral and physical 
organization &#59; hence&#44; if we fancy that on earth we 
have our demons and our gods&#44; our good and evil 
geniuses&#44; it necessarily follows that the severed soul 
also is subject to the consequences which either the 
justice or caprice of the gods may decree to her&#44; just 
as they found cause to be pleased or displeased with 
the conduct of the composite of flesh and spirit who 
erst dwelt in the upper regions&#44; otherwise called &#34;the 
living man&#59;&#34; and hence also arose the same division 
in the control over the spirit which formerly was ac&#8211; 
corded to the body when living&#44; or the theory of the 
gods of the nether world. 

But it is not necessary that we should go through 
the whole series of the divinities of refined polytheism 
which is found in the poetry of the Greeks and Ro&#8211; 
mans&#59; as those who have any plcasui&#8211;o in the inquiry 
can examine the various and easily&#8211;accessible authori&#8211; 
ties for themselves. Only one thing appears to us so

singularly defective in the wliole&#44; tbat a system so 
strangely artiiicial&#44; Avliere one god is the husband of 
a particular goddess&#44; and where the prod net of such 
a union is a succession of a new race of immortals&#44; 
did not disgust the followers thereof. There is no 
purity in the gross representations which were given 
in the writings of the ancients&#59; and whatever&#44; there&#8211; 
fore&#44; of sublime thought was originally connected 
with such ideas of worship&#44; was gradually lost in the 
absurd fables of mythology&#44; as developed in the books 
which treat of the pagan divinities. Still&#44; so it is &#59; 
for as soon as one departs from the simplicity of the 
original ideas of the Deity which&#44; no doubt&#44; were re&#8211; 
vealed to our first parents in Eden&#44; and invests Na&#8211; 
ture or any of its component parts with independent 
powers&#44; or imagines the same as coexistent with the 
Creator&#58; he at once opens the flood&#8211;gates of error and 
folly&#44; and one absurdity after the other will gain ad&#8211; 
mittance into a system of belief so constituted&#59; and 
if even he or his generation may not at once sink in 
the entire abyss of unreason&#44; his followers or succes&#8211; 
sors will&#44; to a surety&#44; reach that state of imbecility&#44; if 
they persevere to pursue the vanities of their precur&#8211; 
sors. ISTevertheless&#44; it is not to be denied that&#44; in the 
midst of Ifeathen follies&#44; there were a few who&#44; en&#8211; 
dowed with superior faculties&#44; could not find satisfoc&#8211; 
tion in the multiplicity of gods they were called on to 
worship. They conceived that there must be a great 
Arcliitect&#44; a Unity&#44; to whose immediate power all 
owes its existence. There were such&#44; as history 
shows us&#59; but how laborious must have been their 
search&#44; how painful their reflections&#44; before thoy 
could at all arrive at the to us evident conclusion.

It was with them the struggle of human reason 
against the errors inherited from their fathers&#59; and 
only hy slow and gradual approaches could they 
reach that point of perfection where the Creator&#44; with 
his attributes of infinite mercy and irresistible power&#44; 
stood revealed to their eyes. But we cannot well 
determine if ever a heathen obtained a true knowl&#8211; 
edge of his relation to God by his own reflection&#44; or 
wdiether he did not always&#44; under the most favoura&#8211; 
ble circumstances&#44; retain some attachment to the 
works of human hands and the inventions of the hu&#8211; 
man mind which were adored around him. We may 
go farther&#44; and maintain that originally the truth 
of the divine existence was made manifest to the 
world by a direct revelation of his being by the Cre&#8211; 
ator himself&#59; and that it was only a long course of 
wilful rebellion against the Godhead which at length 
allowed the baneful errors of Paganism to acquire 
the whole dominion over the human heart. But it 
is impossible to believe that no glimmer of pure 
light occasionally passed over the face of the gloom 
which shrouded the human intellect&#44; and that when&#8211; 
ever a glimpse of the truth reached a mind of great 
endowment&#44; whom the Lord occasionally raised up 
to arouse a sleeping world&#44; the acquiescence in the 
dogmas of his countrymen became&#44; perhaps&#44; more a 
matter of policy than of conviction. A fear of of&#8211; 
fending might probably have prevented him from an 
entire separation from the errors which were up&#8211; 
held every where&#59; and whatever is alleged of the 
toleration of heathenism&#44; it is equally certain that&#44; 
if even it admitted any addition to its gods and de&#8211; 
mons&#44; it looked upon and i&#41;unishod as atheism a di&#8211;

rect denial of the beings which it had established as 
divinities. I leave it to historians to enter into the 
minutios of the subject&#59; my present aim is the single 
point of the dissent which our religion presents to 
the views under discussion. 

Another fact why we find&#44; in comparatively later 
times&#44; Grecians and Romans speaking more in con&#8211; 
sonance with reason&#44; has perhaps been overlooked 
by many who have given the subject a mere careless 
reflection. It is this &#58; The wars of David&#44; in the 
first instance&#44; carried with his armies a knowledge 
of the faith and practice of Israel into the countries 
bordering on the Euphrates. The fame of Solomon&#44; 
and the commerce which he opened with the distant 
Ophir and Tarshish &#40;probably India and Si&#41;ain&#41; must 
have also tended to leave some seeds of Judaism in 
the minds of those who either visited the court of 
this wise prince&#44; or who had intercourse with his ser&#8211; 
vants in foreign lands. During the remaining time 
of the first temple&#44; more or less commerce was kept 
up with the coasts of the Mediterranean&#44; and the 
countries to the east of Palestine &#59; and when at length 
the kingdoms of Israel and Judah were subverted&#44; &#8212; 
especially the latter&#44; where the religion of the Bible 
liad always been more observed than in Samaria&#44; &#8212; 
the followers of the Lord were scattered far and wide&#44; 
from Media to Egypt &#59; and in the latter country Jere&#8211; 
miah the prophet&#44; with Baruch&#44; his scholar&#44; became 
the guide of the fugitives who sought there refuge 
from the anger of the Babylonian king. ISTow&#44; who&#8211; 
ever reflects how much of its wisdom Greece bor&#8211; 
rowed or obtained from Egy&#94;it will not be easily led 
to suppose that Pythagoras&#44; Socrates&#44; and Plato&#44; not

to mention their successors&#44; were not in some manner 
indoctrinated witli the Bible dogmas&#44; which had ob&#8211; 
tained so strong a foothold on the shores of the Nile 
live hundred years before the commencement of the 
vulgar era. It need not surprise any one that our 
doctrines are not cited by name by the heathens&#59; for 
this would have made them appear as copyists&#59; where&#8211; 
as they desired to figure as inventors&#44; as founders of 
new systems of philosophy. It will&#44; therefore&#44; not 
be assuming too much to assert that the Bible tended 
greatly&#44; if not alone&#44; to infuse a purer idea of the 
Creator and his attributes into the religious views of 
Western pagans&#59; and that but for this they would 
have continued as debased as they were in the be&#8211; 
ginning. 

Perhaps&#44; &#8212; to resume the thread of our argument&#44; 
&#8212; those who came the nearest to the simplicity of 
truth in their conceptions of the Deity were the Per&#8211; 
sians&#44; who viewed him as a twofold being&#44; one the 
prwcrpli&#58; of evil&#44; and the other&#44; that of good. They had 
thus a narrower ran&#58;e for error&#44; althous&#58;b this did not 
bring them upon the truth that there is but one 
Author&#44; from whom both what we call evil and good 
are derived&#44; and that the. very evil which to us ap&#8211; 
pears as that which we ought to guard against&#44; such 
as bodily pain and death&#44; is at the bottom a neces&#8211; 
sary ingredient in the government of the universe&#44; 
and will in its consequences conduce to the permanent 
benefit of the creation. The Persians endeavoured 
to account for the presence of evil by supposing that 
it was the emanation of an independent spirit&#44; and 
not derived from the Good Principle&#44; who is a pure&#44; 
eternal light&#44; the original source of all perfection&#59;

and they averred that man himself becomes the ser&#8211; 
vant of the one or the other&#44; as he may choose vice 
or virtue&#44; folly or wisdom. We have here again a 
division of power&#44; no homogeneous working of all 
for one purpose. Man can reject for himself after this 
theory his allegiance to the good Creator&#44; and become 
a willing servant and an adherent of the evil and the 
author thereof. 

It is not to be supposed that&#44; however pure the 
refined systems of idolatry were&#44; they did not de&#8211; 
scend gradually into the grossest misconceptions of 
truth&#44; and lead to immorality and misgovernment&#59; 
for&#44; even admit that the priests and philosophers&#44; as 
I have remarked on a former occasion&#44; may have 
known better&#44; and believed&#44; accordingly&#44; in a more 
refined view of the origin of things&#44; they were natu&#8211; 
rally too much interested in the support of the arti&#8211; 
ficial system which gave them such power over the 
multitude of their countrymen&#44; to impart to these any 
doubts&#44; except under a strict injunction of mystery&#44; 
of the popular views of religion and morality. Hence 
gross ignorance was the lot of the people&#59; and those 
who handled the state religion were the actual leaders 
in peace and in war of the aflairs of the common&#8211; 
wealth&#44; and there was but one step from the augur 
and pontifex to that of consul. This was the case 
with all Paganism&#44; more or less&#44; as investigation will 
prove&#59; and this will again be&#44; should ever the light 
expire &#40;of which&#44; thanks be to our Maker&#44; there is no 
danger&#41; which was enkindled by his own inspiration. 
How far Moses&#44; when he led the flock of his father&#8211; 
in&#8211;law far into the desert&#44; to the Mount of God&#44; to 
Horeb&#44; was instructed in the fiiith of Abraham&#44; we

liave no meana of ascertaining. The Israelites&#44; in 
general&#44; bad evidently become deeply contaminated 
with the grossness of superstition around them&#59; and 
whether or not the elders and leaders of the people 
had escaped the corruption&#44; &#8212; whether they firmly ad&#8211; 
hered to the idea of a unity in the Godhead&#44; or not&#44; &#8212; 
must ever remain a matter of doubt. Be this&#44; how&#8211; 
ever&#44; as it may&#44; it is certain that the man Moses was 
one in whom had been implanted a true spirit of wis&#8211; 
dom&#44; a discerning soul to learn with readiness and to 
appreciate any moral proposition presented to him. 
What his frame of mind was in respect to the suffer&#8211; 
ings of the Israelites is evident from the danger he 
incurred by slaying the Egyptian who smote a He&#8211; 
brew man&#44; one of his brethren&#44; &#8212; not an actual brother 
from parentage&#44; but a brother in descent from Abra&#8211; 
ham the Hebrew&#44; &#8212; a slave to Pharaoh&#44; whilst he was 
the favourite of the king&#39;s daughter&#44; raised in luxury 
in the royal palace as the son of the princess. He 
fled from the threatened vengeance of the tyrant&#39;s 
sword&#59; and the pampered courtier became at first a 
fugitive&#44; and at length the keeper of the flock of the 
priest of Midian. How his mind must have boiled 
over with indignation&#44; as rumour wafted to his ears 
new accounts of the sorrows of Israel &#33; how his soul 
must have longed for an irrepressible power to break 
the fetters of his suflering brothers&#33; But&#44; alas I he 
grew aged&#59; the termination of his life &#40;for he was 
eighty years old&#41; presented itself&#59; and still the sons 
of Jacob sighed under bondage&#44; though a new king 
had arisen in the place of the one grown old in tyv&#8211; 
ranny&#44; who had made their burdens heavy&#44; and their 
life bitter. But&#44; wdien human aid and humayi intcl&#8211;

lect had uo means of saving&#44; the Divine aid was ready 
to interpose&#44; to effect the purpose of the call of Ab&#8211; 
raham&#44; and to redeem the promises made to the 
patriarchs&#44; &#8212; promises which had almost ceased to 
excite a vibration of hope in the hearts of Pharaoh&#39;s 
bondmen. It was&#44; therefore&#44; that the man of high as&#8211; 
pirations&#44; though in the humble guise of a shepherd&#44; 
was especially chosen to become the mighty instru&#8211; 
ment of the twofold purpose&#44; to break asunder the 
chains of slavery&#44; and to establish anew the knowl&#8211; 
edge of the God of our fathers. Our lesson of to&#8211;day 
describes&#44; in simple and awful words&#44; how Moses was 
awakened unto the high consciousness of his pro&#8211; 
phetic errand&#44; and how he beheld the vision of the 
Supreme revealed to his outward eyes&#44; and how he 
acquired new wisdom from hearing the immediate 
voice of the Author of the world. ISTo comments can 
add aught to the force of the words&#44; which say&#44; &#34; I 
am the God of thy father&#44; the God of Abraham&#44; the 
God of Isaac&#44; and the God of Jacob. I have seen 
the affliction of my people wdiich is in Egypt&#44; and 
their cry have I heard on account of their taskmas&#8211; 
ters&#59; for I know their sorrows. And I have come 
down to deliver them from the hand of Egypt&#44; and 
to bring them np from this land into a land good and 
ample&#44; into a land flowing with milk and honey&#44; unto 
the place of the Canaanite&#44; the Ilittite&#44; the Emorite&#44; 
the Perizzite&#44; the Hivite&#44; and the Jebusite.&#34; Here at 
once was a promised consummation to all that Moses 
had ever hoped for&#44; a view of the highest knowledge&#44; 
and an assurance of the safety of his own people. 
Nay&#44; more&#44; when he offered his own unworthiness as 
a reason why he should not go to Pharaoh to accom&#8211;

plisli the work of redemption&#44; he was assured that 
he should be specially aided by the One who then 
spoke to him&#44; and be the means of bringing the people 
to worship God at the very place where he then was. 
NoAV&#44; mark the query of Moses&#58; &#34;Behold&#44; when I 
come to the sons of Israel&#44; and I say unto them. The 
God of your fathers hath sent me unto you&#44; and they 
say to me. What is his name&#63; what shall I say unto 
them&#63;&#34; The people were probably in the habit of 
calling on the gods of their masters&#59; they had learned 
to reverence a multitude of beings&#44; all objects of ador&#8211; 
ation&#44; though all ditiering in power. They therefore 
would naturally ask&#44; &#34; Who of all these is the God 
of our fathers&#63; or is there a different name&#44; another 
God&#44; of whom we as yet know not who he is&#63;&#34; It 
was so much in accordance with Egyptian ideas&#44; that 
this strange question of Moses loses its singularity&#44; 
when we view it by the light which this consideration 
will throw upon it. The Almighty&#44; therefore&#44; showed 
uo evidence of displeasure&#44; as He did afterwards at 
Moses&#39;s perseverance in refusing his mission&#59; but the 
answer was simple&#44; and beyond measure comprehen&#8211; 
sive and grand &#58; 

&#34; I&#8211;will&#8211;be He that I&#8211;will&#8211;be&#59; and He said&#44; Tims shalt thou say 
to the sons of Israel&#44; I&#8211;will&#8211;be hath sent me unto you.&#34; Exodus

the express exponent of his being&#59; as He is in power 
unlimited&#44; in essence infinite&#44; in wisdom unsearchable.

no appellation which human language can invent 
could possibly suffice to embrace all He is in one 
word. No name&#44; therefore&#44; can be applied to Him&#44; 
except the phrase &#34; I will be&#44;&#34;&#8212; conveying an infinite 
duration&#44; an existence without limit. If then the 
children of Israel should wish to know by what name 
they are to call the God of their fathers&#44; they should 
be told that it is the same of whom it could be said&#44; 
in the beginning of all creation&#44; &#34;I will be&#44;&#34; and 
who&#44; when all shall again&#44; if that be his will&#44; sink 
into chaos or nothing&#44; will still exist in the same 
power&#44; and yet say&#44; &#34; I will be.&#34; And this&#44; brethren&#44; 
was the subject&#8211;matter of the great revelation of which 
Moses was the constituted messenger&#44; of which the 
Israelites were appointed the bearers to all times&#44; 
from that day and forward. Great as was the day 
of the assembly at Horeb&#44; it was but the more com&#8211; 
plete exponent of the first Divine appearance in the 
uncousumed bush on the same sacred spot. The first 
mcssao&#8211;e of Moses to the Israelites revealed at once 
what only was attained by unassisted human reason&#44; 
if ever it attained thereto&#44; by the most intense reflec&#8211; 
tion&#44; and by traditions of the discovery of the prede&#8211; 
cessors who had accumulated thoughts and reflections&#44; 
which were rendered more perfect by the labours of 
those who followed them. But&#44; by the announce&#8211; 
ment before us&#44; how was the conceit of priests and 
mystifiers brushed away at once and forever &#33; &#34; I will

and they vanish. He is the Governor of all &#59; He sees 
wliatever is done in the highest and most secret places &#59; 
and he too will judge the living and the dead&#44; be&#8211; 
cause he is the God of spirits of all flesh&#44; and all must 
return to Him at his bidding. We do not claim any 
merit for the discovery of our religion &#59; we ask not 
for Moses the highest niche in the temple of fame as 
the greatest reformer&#58; we only aver that we were 
instructed again at Horeb&#44; by the Deity&#44; in the truths 
which lie had revealed from the beginning&#44; and 
which sinning men had obscured by their inventions&#44; 
by their substituting as objects of worship the crea&#8211; 
ture instead of the Creator. We too were either sunk 
in or fast hasteninii&#58; to the slou2&#58;h in which the hea&#8211; 
theus had been immersed &#59; and it was the mercy of 
our Father only which rescued us thence&#44; to become 
the witnesses of his great and holy Name. Now&#44; what 
was revealed to Moses&#63; A simple&#44; single truth. 
What did it concern &#63; The nature of the Deity. What 
Avas its import&#63; That the God of Israel is the One 
who will be. There is no plurality indicated&#44; no me&#8211; 
diator alluded to &#59; but it says&#44; emphatically&#44; &#34; I WILL 
BE hath sent me unto you&#59;&#34; &#8212; the same who created 
the world&#44; &#8212; the same who selected Abraham as his 
servant for his well&#8211;tested piety&#44; &#8212; the same who 
promised to be with Isaac in. his pilgrimag&#8211;e&#44; &#8212; the 
same who told Jacob that He would go down with 
him to Egypt and bring him up from there&#44; &#8212; in short&#44; 
the One&#44; who was God from ever&#44; had heard the cry 
of anguish of the sons of Israel&#44; and now showed his 
glory to Moses&#44; to send him with a message of happy 
tidings&#44; to fulfil the promise of establishing a nation 
of worshippers to spring from Abraham&#44; at the Mount

are yet left to continue the truth in ourselves and our 
descendants. May we be true to our trust&#44; and merit 
speedily the t&#58;oming of the Son of David to redeem 
the world.

DISCOURSE II. 

TEMPORAL AND ETERNAL&#42; PUNISHMENTS. 

O GRACIOUS Father&#44; who chosest us from all na&#8211; 
tions to be thy own heritage &#33; listen we pray Thee 
to our supplication&#44; and grant unto us the desires of 
our hearts which are for good&#44; and satisfy our souls 
with the blissful assurance of thy favour&#44; which is the 
portion of those who fear thy Name. Ages&#44; our 
God &#33; have passed away&#44; since Thou didst call us unto 
thy presence&#44; to witness thy glory&#44; and to see thy con&#8211; 
suming fires&#59; and the recollection thereof still abides 
with us&#44; and we rejoice to be called thy servants. Do 
Thou then bless us with the evidences of thy bounty&#44; 
and lead us gently unto the shadow of thy fold&#44; and 
appoint over us faithful shepherds who will guide thy 
Hocks rightly&#44; and give us righteous teachers who 
will instruct us in all that appertains to thy law. So 
shall we be safe amidst the gentiles&#44; and all will ac&#8211; 
knowledge&#44; that we are thy divinely&#8211;chosen people&#44; 

&#42; That means&#44; punishment after death&#44; not unceasing.

though our sins luive banished us from thy land&#59; and 
we shall thus also be ever ready to bear the testimony 
to thy unwavering truth&#44; for which sake Abraliani 
was called&#44; and the sons of Jacob were appointed thy 
messengers&#44; until the day when all creatures shall 
adore Thee alone&#44; and worship only Thee as their 
God and King. Amen. 

Brethren&#33; 

In the chapter next following the one containing 
the Ten Commandments we find not a theoretical ex&#8211; 
position of the principles laid down in our blissful 
constitution&#44; not a laboured defence of the ideas 
therein contained as the basis of our religion&#59; but a 
practical statement of laws calculated to subserve the 
civil government of the people of Israel&#59; and thus 
speaks the text &#58; 

&#34;And these are the laws of justice which thou shalt lay hefore 
them.&#34; Exod. xxi. 1. 

Perhaps not a single circumstance other than this 
exordium of a state government so immediately fol&#8211; 
lowing upon the revelation of the Decalogue&#44; could 
give us so clear an insight into the nature of the di&#8211; 
vine legislation&#44; as the one before us. If we look 
into the Ten Precepts which were given to the people 
as the direct emanation of their God&#39;s teaching&#44; we 
will tind in them nothing but naked enactments of 
simple duties&#44; without any attempt to prove their cor&#8211; 
rectness or necessity. And in tracing out the ramifi&#8211; 
cations which were engrafted upon them afterwards&#44;

and comranuicated to the messenger whom the peo&#8211; 
ple had chosen to announce to them the divine will&#44; 
we can discover nothing of a ditterent nature in their 
tenor or their wording&#59; they are precisely as the con&#8211; 
stitution on which they are founded&#44; and must iiill or 
stand hy their inherent weakness or strength&#44; as the 
text itself gives us no arguments whatever in their 
favour&#44; farther than that they are the expressed will 
of God&#44; and their observance will redound to our hap&#8211; 
piness. Nay&#44; more&#44; we iind&#44; properly speaking&#44; no 
affirmations of any truths&#44; only legislative enactments 
in their proper sense &#59; and whatever of the former are 
conveyed to us&#44; they are brought before us incident&#8211; 
ally&#44; or as connected more or less with the outward 
observances which are demanded of us in our code. 
We must hence draw the conclusion&#44; that we would 
look upon the INIosaic law from a wrong point of 
view&#44; were we to deny the existence of any doctrine 
or truth simply because it is not mentioned there in 
express terms&#44; and do this to that degree as to enter&#8211; 
tain any position as correct which is diametrically 
opposed to either of the commandments or assertions 
which are to be found therein. It is evident that 
though the first verse of the Decalogue is a mere dec&#8211; 
laration&#44; it has still all the force of a most imperative 
injunction&#44; announcing to the people that the Being&#44; 
who was then addressing them&#44; was the imperishable 
Eternal One&#44; who had alone redeemed them from 
bondage&#44; and hence that they were bound to confide 
in Ilim solely&#44; and to be ready to execute whatever 
He might ask of them in response to his being their 
God. &#34;in other words&#44; the declaration merely recites 
the fact and truth which they had known and became 

<pb n="20"/>

convinced of before&#59; they had experienced tliem&#8211; 
selves the benefits resulting from their deliverance&#44; 
and had been impressed by the force of the strongest 
possible evidence which miracles could aftbrd&#44; that 
their God was in truth an existing Power&#44; and that 
moreover He must of necessity be the greatest of all 
existing beings&#44; lie having subverted the ordinary 
course of events to bring them to Ilim. No second&#8211; 
ary truth was requisite to impose upon them the con&#8211; 
viction that tliey ought to submit to be taught by 
Him who is the highest&#59; for common sense would 
certainly be enough to exact such a consent from 
them and all other men &#59; for since they were crea&#8211; 
tures&#44; as all other mortals are at the present hour&#44; 
and as their wisdom was in consequence subordinate 
to that of the Creator&#44; it would only be obeying the 
emanation of a sure Intelligence to follow implicitly 
all the ordinances and statutes which He might dic&#8211; 
tate. It need not therefore surprise 3&#8211;ou that no other 
doctrine or matter of belief is laid down in the Deca&#8211; 
logue as the foundation of the Jewish religion&#44; and 
no laboured definition is given of what the Deity is. 
lie exists &#59; this we feel in the innermost secret dwell&#8211; 
ing of our soul &#59; this our fathers felt with the most 
perfect conviction&#44; at the moment they were as&#8211; 
sembled at Sinai &#59; and consequently no other induce&#8211; 
ment is required to believe in Him&#44; nor is it requisite 
to base legislation upon any other assumption than 
that the Legislator had the right and the power to 
cause his will to be obeyed. Hence it would be the 
reverse of sound reasoning to say&#44; that&#44; because the 
Decalogue recites not in so many words the eternity 
of God&#44; Ho is&#44; therefore&#44; not eternal &#59; or that because 

<pb n="21"/>

it is silent with regard to the permanence of the 
law&#44; the hiw is destined to undergo the fate of all 
things on earth&#44; and fall at length into ohlivion. On 
the contrary&#44; we must examine tlie other portions of 
the hook written hy the ins&#124;&#41;iration of God&#44; and learn 
from them what we are to think and believe with re&#8211; 
spect to the things which concern our happiness. As 
far as the necessity for obedience is to be taken in 
account&#44; it is enough for us to be convinced of the 
existence of God &#59; but if we wish to understand our 
relation to Him&#44; we must go farther&#44; and see how He 
has revealed himself to us in all the manifestations 
which we have obtained through his merciful instruc&#8211; 
tion. There is therefore no necessity to look in the 
Pentateuch&#44; the books of Moses&#44; for a coniirmatiou 
of all the articles of our belief&#59; if we find confirma&#8211; 
tion therein&#44; it is certainly well&#59; but the reverse need 
ijot alarm us&#59; for it is enough if our hopes and views 
are established by the messages of the later prophets&#44; 
who were sent by the Lord to complete the system 
which was commenced in Moses. 

ISTor is it to be said that&#44; because the law may 1&#41;0 
silent with respect to certain truths&#44; such as the im&#8211; 
mortality of the soul&#44; and the reward and punishnient 
after death&#44; &#8212; they were unknown to the Israelites of 
the times of Moses&#44; or that he did not impart them 
to the people in his familiar instruction&#59; only this 
can be asserted with regard to such omissions&#44; that 
they did not come naturally within the range of the 
subjects which he was commanded to lay before them &#59; 
and consequently it was not comportable with the 
nature of his system&#44; that he should&#44; without cause or 
uecessity&#44; but merely to lay down sinijile doctrines&#44; 

<pb n="22"/>

22 TEMPORAL AND ETERNAL TUNISHMENTS. 

recite a number of truths wliicli it behoved us to 
know and to believe in. The existence of the Deity 
alone it was necessary to teach as an article of pri&#8211; 
mary acknowledgment&#59; because without it there could 
be no legislation &#59; but as respects the future state&#44; its 
joys and its sorrows&#44; it could not be made an object 
of legislation&#44; because it naturally cannot apply to 
man in his mixed state of existence&#44; and to such alone 
was the law given &#8212; to a being who has his existence 
on the earth&#44; and who cannot&#44; do what he Avill&#44; lift 
himself above the things of the earth&#44; during any por&#8211; 
tion of his sojourn here below. Besides the views 
resulting from immortality can only relate to man 
in his individual capacity&#59; they cannot reach him in 
his position as a member of society&#44; nor can society 
at large be governed by views which have not earth 
as their native place. &#34;Whatever felicity the spirit of 
the righteous will attain in its purified existence&#44; can&#8211; 
not enter into the calculations of justice and duty&#44; so 
far as this depends upon the action of judges and ex&#8211; 
ecutive magistrates&#59; they cannot allow the virtuous 
to be abridged of his personal rights&#44; because he is 
sure of a hirge reward in heaven&#59; nor can they con&#8211; 
scientiously hide their eye from the malefactor&#44; from 
the consideration which the Scriptures hold out&#44; &#34; that 
God will not let the guilty pass unpunished.&#34; We 
have nothing to do with abstractions in our social re&#8211; 
lations &#59; here we must deal with matter&#44; and material 
things &#59; consequently a truly wise legislation conlines 
itself solely to those points which it can handle and 
carry into execution. 

Do not misunderstand me&#44; brethren&#44; as saying that 
the law of Moses contains no allusions to a purer state 

<pb n="23"/>

of existence than our present&#59; or that every doctruic 
Avhich Ave confide in is not directlj&#8211; traceable from 
some text therein which only by violent wresting 
could bear another interpretation &#58; I only argue 
against those who deny many of our views altogether 
or claim for them an origin of a later period&#44; and 
from an authority which Ave cannot admit. Against 
all such objections I would maiutain that&#44; if even Ave 
grant all they claim from the view that the laAv itself is 
silent respecting our doctrines&#44; Ave are nevertheless 
justly empoAvered to claim for them full credence and 
hope&#44; so long as we can deduce them from those books 
of Scripture Avhich Avere Avritten doAvn sooner or later 
after the death of Moses &#59; and that though not the 
slightest allusion to any other doctrine than the sim&#8211; 
ple existence of God Avere contained in the Liw&#44; all 
the articles of our belief&#44; being&#44; as they are&#44; supported 
by the evident sense of texts from other portions of 
Holy Writ&#44; would be true&#44; and demand our strictest 
belief and acquiescence. There can be no difterence 
between one portion of Scripture and the other as re&#8211; 
gards sanctity &#59; and hence the whole becomes a founda&#8211; 
tion of doctrine and belief&#44; Avithout our being author&#8211; 
ized to choose betAveen one and the other section. 

But as respects the absolute intentions of the law 
itself&#44; it Avas instituted to teach us statutes and ordi&#8211; 
nances AA&#94;hich Ave should observe in our national ex&#8211; 
istence&#44; and as individuals belonging to the people of 
Israel. It Avas intended that the Decaloo&#8211;ue should 
be the constitutional basis&#44; and the other precepts the 
code for a commouAvealth of equals and freemen&#44; of 
whom the head and sovereign is the Lord himself.

the residence whicli his mercy permitted the people 
to erect in the midst of them to his holy ilTame &#59; and 
they were to he nationally prosperous or suffering as 
their conduct towards their Sovereign might merit. 
The people hore to the Lord the relation of subjects 
to Lheir king&#44; and in the measure as they deserved 
his bounty&#44; should they obtain it. ISTow it is not nec&#8211; 
essary to argue that future rewards or punishments 
could not affect the Israelites as a nation&#44; nor could 
such a procedure be an evident manifestation of di&#8211; 
vine favour or displeasure. Suppose that a whole 
generation should have been condemned to perpetual 
punishment hereafter &#58; this could not have any visible 
effect on earth&#44; and must hence fail of affecting the 
succeeding generations&#44; whilst at the same time it 
would have been utterly inoperative to act as a cor&#8211; 
rective to the doomed themselves &#59; whereas it com&#8211; 
ports best with the justice of the Lord that all punish&#8211; 
ment should be dispensed to redeem the erring child 
of the dust from his evil ways. Now observe the wis&#8211; 
dom of God as displayed in his law. Immediately 
after announcing himself at Sinai&#44; and convincing 
the people that none but the Supreme had taught 
them himself in his tire and his glory. He proceeded 
to organize his kingdom on earth through the estab&#8211; 
lishment of laws of justice and practice&#44; which are to 
be accompanied with rewards and punishments tan&#8211; 
gible alike to the capacities of the whole people and 
individuals&#44; and affecting them in their national and 
individual prosperity. &#8212; God announced himself as the 
Preserver of justice and equal rights&#59; hence the 
judges&#44; who wore to do on earth what He exercises 
in the universe&#44; should not regard whether the matter 

<pb n="25"/>

TEMPORAL AND ETBRNAL PUNISHxMENTS. 25 

brought before them was little or great&#44; whether the 
parties were the poor or the wealthy &#59; but they should 
hold an even balance&#44; keep themselves free from par&#8211; 
tiality&#44; hy not accepting gifts or favours from those 
whom they had to judge&#44; and to speak out freely 
their judgment which they had arrived at after their 
best and mature reflection&#44; without regard whether 
they agreed with their colleagues in opinion or wheth&#8211; 
er theirs was overbalanced by the authoritative decis&#8211; 
ion of the many. &#8212; Respecting personal rights there 
could he no prerogative&#44; no exemption&#44; no privilege 
which all did not enjoy alike&#59; they were all brothers&#44; 
all of the same importance in the presence of their 
King&#59; and the beggar of to&#8211;day might become the 
leader of the morrow. &#8212; Consequently the rewards and 
punishments were such as the people themselves could 
exercise &#59; the body and property of each citizen be&#8211; 
came surety for his faithful adherence to the national 
constitution&#44; and both could become forfeited&#44; when&#8211; 
ever the unbiassed judgment of honest men&#44; supported 
by undoubted testimony&#44; had proved that the accused 
had been guilty of such a violation of the laws&#44; as 
demanded that visitation which the code&#44; under which 
all lived&#44; of right attached to the transgression. 

This much as regards a state of things&#44; when but 
few required correction&#44; when the many were true to 
their allegiance. But the Sovereign did not resign 
his power of coercing obedience&#44; because He had ap&#8211; 
pointed judges on earth &#59; 3n the contrary He reserved 
to himself the great exe 3ise of his kingly power to 
do his pleasure or witli old his blessing according to 
the merits of the entire nation. yational prosperity&#44;

when unjustly attacked by foreign invaders&#44; length 
of days on earth&#44; robust health&#44; in short all the out&#8211; 
ward tokens of a happy community&#44; Avero to be the 
reward of obedience&#44; and an incentive to persevere 
in the path of righteousness. But they were certified 
that if the reverse sliould take place&#44; if there were 
war&#44; or famine&#44; or mortality&#44; or the absence of the 
refreshing rain of heaven&#44; &#8212; in each and all of these 
occurrences they might be sure that sin was abound&#8211; 
ing in their land&#44; and that it was time to repent of 
the evil&#44; and to strive to propitiate the indignation of 
their King by a sincere seeking of righteousness&#44; that 
is&#44; by a renewed and firm observance of the precepts 
of the law which they had received for their guidance. 
The result of all this was that&#44; as we see in all 
periods of our national history&#44; the people were con&#8211; 
stantly aroused&#44; whenever they fell into transgres&#8211; 
sion&#44; to a knowledge of the wrong they had done. 
During the time of Moses we find recorded several 
cases of plague&#44; which struck down many of the 
people &#59; and they at once felt that they had merited 
this visitation&#44; because they had rebelled against God. 
When Jochua led the Israelites to the conquest of the 
Holy Land&#44; Achan sinned and took of the condemned 
spoil of Jericho&#44; and at once Israel tied from before 
their enemies &#59; the reverses which they had met with 
caused them to seek where the guilt was &#59; and with 
the punishment of the culprit victory again crowned 
the arms of the Hebrew warriors. In later times&#44; 
when the people threw ofi&#58;&#34; the yoke of the Lord of 
hosts and worshipped the idols of their neighbours&#44; 
these overcame the now forsaken tiock&#44; and &#34; when 
Israel sowed came up the bands of Eastern marauders&#44;

and despoiled both fields and vineyards.&#34; The sin 
was thus rendered manifest&#44; and by a repentance&#44; thus 
forced upon them by the combination of circum&#8211; 
stances clearly betokening the wrath of Heaven&#44; the 
calamity was averted and peace again revisited the 
land. Thus it was for many years&#44; periods of out&#8211; 
ward prosperity succeeded those of national calamity&#59; 
until at length the great corruption which had lasted 
for several generations&#44; and after repeated warnings 
had been unheeded by the children of rebellion&#44; 
caused their final expulsion from Palestine&#44; and this 
clearly proved that their conduct had become so 
odious in the sight of God&#44; that He had needs to ex&#8211; 
pel them for a time from his presence&#44; to teach them 
the diflereuce between the easy yoke of their Master&#44; 
and the burdens of those whose alliance and customs 
they had preferred in their wicked choice. 

It will be readily understood&#44; that all the chastise&#8211; 
ments were not calculated to effect the eternal con&#8211; 
demnation of the people or the individuals thereof&#59; 
but that they were in the spirit of the corrections of 
which Solomon speaks when he says &#58; &#34; For him 
whom the Lord loveth he chastiseth&#44; and as a father 
who wisljeth to correct his son.&#34; A few&#44; it must be 
admitted&#44; perished in their iniquity&#59; but their re&#8211; 
moval operated always as an example to others&#44; and 
so they died not in vain &#59; and as with the death of the 
body our existence is not ended&#44; who knows but that 
the very ones who were taken&#44; may thereby have 
made an expiation for their sins&#44; and become puri&#8211; 
fied&#44; and been tried&#44; and rendered white before the 
Lord&#63; It were unjust almost to impute any other 
course to the Judge of all flesh&#44; whose mercy so im&#8211;

measurably exceeds his indignation&#44; and to whom 
the minutest insect is an object of providential care. 
We may&#44; therefore&#44; assume as a fact clearly estab&#8211; 
lished&#44; that the omission of announcing in the Pen&#8211; 
tateuch spiritual punishments and blessings&#44; which 
affect us after death&#44; is no evidence that the Israelites 
were unacquainted with this scheme from the com&#8211; 
mencement of revelation&#59; since Moses&#39;s legislation 
was for a practical end&#44; for a government existing on 
earth&#44; and therefore to be exercised by such means 
as are evidently within the reach of human beings&#44; 
comprehended by the ordinary understanding of man. 
But in the various expressions that God would dwell in 
the midst of us&#44; and come and bless us with his pres&#8211; 
ence&#59; his calling himself constantly the God of Abra&#8211; 
ham&#44; Isaac&#44; and Jacob&#44; who already long since slept 
in their sepulchres &#59; his saying emphatically that He 
was the one who slayeth and maketh alive&#44; and many 
other expressions which we could easily enumerate&#44; 
establish to the satisfaction of the sincere believer&#44; 
that there never was a time when the Israelites were 
uninstructed of their responsibility in the spirit&#44; when 
severed from the body&#44; for the deeds in their mixed 
state of existence. But as the punishment in the liesh 
is intended for our purification&#44; so are we also author&#8211; 
ized to hope at least&#44; that the punishment after death 
will not be for eternity&#44; except perhaps in rare cases&#44; 
where one man is the cause of the sinning of many 
others&#59; but as very few can thus sin for a permanent 
time&#44; so few only can be punished for more than a 
season&#59; and when their visitation has been endured&#44; 
their spirit will be restored to that state of felicity&#44; 
or life&#44; for which we all are created&#44; as our wise men

over all his creatures&#44; who is good to the righteous 
and the sinner&#44; which is his greatest praise&#44; and whose

DISCOURSE III. 

SACRIFICES AND ATONEMENT. 

O Father of man. Creator of the universe&#44; to whom 
all flesh comes for aid and sustenance &#33; we approach 
thy mercy&#8211;seat to crave thy bounty and favour. Our 
hands are polluted with the stains of sin&#44; and our 
souls feel the burden of our iniquity&#44; and we have 
neither temple nor priest to make atonement for our 
transgressions. In ancient days&#44; indeed&#44; when thy 
glory dwelt in the house which our &#34;fathers had built&#44;

for thy service&#44; Thou wast pleased to accept at our 
hands offerings for sin and trespass&#44; and if the spirit 
was humbled and entreated for forsriveness. Thou 
wast graciously pleased to promise a remission of the 
guilt. But now we approach Thee not with the first&#8211; 
lings of flocks and herds&#44; because the enemy has pre&#8211; 
vailed&#44; and thy sanctuary lias been rendered desolate&#44; 
and thy altar is overthrown. Still art Thou&#44; holy 
One of Jacob&#33; our Father&#59; thy goodness is yet the 
same it ever was&#44; and thy mercies are not limited&#44; 
nor in aught abridged by the Avrong we have done&#44; 
and the evil that has come upon us. May it then bo 
thy will to regard us with the compassion which has 
ever been extended to us &#59; look upon our lowly state 
and not to the humbleness of our oiferings&#59; receive 
our prayer as incense before Thee&#44; and let the words 
of our lips arise up to thy throne as an agreeable sa&#8211; 
vour. So that we may experience thy merciful par&#8211; 
don&#44; and be cleansed from our miquity&#59; since we 
know Thee as the merciiul Kulcr who liast borne 
with our rebelliousness from our first existence as a 
nation until now. And then shall the redeemed sins&#58; 
thy praise at the return of the captives to their land&#44; 
and the spirits of the saints rejoice in thy salvation. 
Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

To judge from the goodness of God&#44; supported as 
we are in this view by the evident words of Revela&#8211; 
tion&#44; we must come to the conclusion that the happi&#8211; 
ness of his creatures is the ultimate object of the 
Creator. If it is true that no joy on earth is perma&#8211; 
nent&#44; if we are constantly forced to acknowledge that 

<pb n="31"/>

SACRIFICES AND ATONEMENT. 31 

no fortune is established on an immovable basis &#58; it 
is equally true that no evil nor suffering is of endur&#8211; 
ing length&#44; and the deepest misery and the most 
fearful deprivation will also see their close before the 
sufferers themselves even expect release. There is 
perhaps one exception&#44; that is the death of the body 
which awaits us all &#59; but then it forms part of our ex&#8211; 
istence&#44; it is a vicissitude to which our life is sub&#8211; 
jected&#44; and will to a surety lead to a farther develop&#8211; 
ment in our being not otherwise accessible to us. 
And with those sufferings which seem to accompany 
us during our whole earthly life&#44; those diseases which 
cling to us as a part of ourselves&#44; those struggles which 
narrow circumstances impose on us from day to day 
and year to year&#44; long habit makes us at length quite 
familiar&#44; so that we lose almost a sense of their bur&#8211; 
den &#59; our mental and bodily conformations both will 
fashion themselves to answer to our position&#44; and&#44; 
being thus iitted to bear the ills which beset us&#44; we 
shall be rendered able to sustain their weight&#44; and 
be cheerful and active under a pressure and burden 
which would weigh down others not so heavily laden. 
For there is a sweetener of sorrows&#44; a comforter to 
our mourning&#44; a remedy accessible to all who suffer&#44; 
&#8212; it is resignation to the divine will&#44; be this will ex&#8211; 
pressed in whatever form it may&#59; be it poverty&#44; be 
it ill&#8211;health&#44; be it loss of friends&#44; be it living in ob&#8211; 
scurity&#44; whilst we see others not more industrious 
than we are&#44; wealthy&#44; others not more prudent than 
ourselves&#44; enjoying robust liealth&#44; others near us 
blessed with the society of those they hold dear&#44; oth&#8211; 
ers no more deserving than we are&#44; revelling in the 
public estimation and earning an imperishable fame. 

<pb n="32"/>

32 SACRIFICES AND ATONEMENT. 

Let all this meet our view &#59; and still we can bear our 
lot and be cheerful and happy&#44; provided only we 
teach ourselves that it is the will of God that so it 
shall be&#44; and that as his servants we dare not rebel 
at seeing others more blessed than we are ourselves. 
But it must not be that grudging resignation which 
says&#58; &#34;I submit&#44; because I cannot help myself&#59;&#34; no 
no&#44; thai is not resignation&#44; it is repining&#44; and it is tanta&#8211; 
mount to rebellion&#44; accusing the Deity of injustice in 
laying upon us sorrows which we did not deserve&#44; 
and which we submit to only because He is strong 
and we are weak. Resignation to be such&#44; and in 
order to enable it to render our sufferings tolerable 
and us cheerful under them&#44; must result from a full 
conviction that all the acts of the Creator are not 
merely arising from the considerations that lie is 
powerful&#44; and can therefore do as He pleases&#44; but that 
lie is wise and good&#44; and regulates the affairs of man 
as best comports with his wisdom and their ultimate 
happiness. Afflictions therefore should teach us sub&#8211; 
mission to his decrees &#59; they should admonish us that 
it is best for us to suffer&#59; and then we will regard 
our God at all times as our Benefactor&#44; though we 
feel at the same time the weight of his chastisement &#59; 
and if even the heart bleed because of the sorrow 
that lies heavily upon us&#44; it can elevate itself in 
prayer and see the goodness of the Creator in its 
blessing on others&#44; and view their prosperity and 
peace without murmur or repining. In truth there 
is no unmixed evil &#59; in every visitation&#44; if we would 
only confess our candid feeling&#44; we could discover 
evidences of mercy&#44; and find cause to thank our 

<pb n="33"/>

SACRIFICES AND ATONEMENT. 33 

Father for the many favours with which our lot is 
surrounded. 

These observations&#44; rather foreign to the subject 
which I mean to discuss to&#8211;day&#44; are intended to elu&#8211; 
cidate the general proposition that God wills the 
happiness of his creatures &#59; and inasmuch as He pun&#8211; 
ishes never more than they are able to bear&#44; we may 
go a step forther and maintain&#44; that He demands 
nothing of them whicli they are not able to execute. 
In other words&#44; religion as revealed to us must con&#8211; 
tain all the acts which to do will insure unto us sal&#8211; 
vation&#44; and must at the same time contain all the 
dosrmas which to believe will be demanded of us as 
the means of our obtaining the divine favour. To 
imagine for one moment that this were not so&#44; would 
be in effect asserting that we had received a religion 
imperfect in its details&#44; or impracticable in its appli&#8211; 
cation to human nature&#59; and still it must be both 
perfect and practicable&#44; since we as men and Israel&#8211; 
ites are called upon to obey all the words of the law&#44; 
and to make them the guides to the path in whicli 
we should walk. We may then assume as a princi&#8211; 
ple&#44; that the law of ISIoses is enough to insure salva&#8211; 
tion to all who faithfully follow it&#44; and that nothing 
else than what it contains can be of right demanded 
of us &#59; because God gave it unto us as the sole ex&#8211; 
pression of his will&#44; and bade us to walk in his ways 
whicli are indicated therein. If we now wish to be 
pleasing to the Lord&#44; or Avhat is the same&#44; if we are 
desirous of accomplishing our whole duty&#44; we have 
nothing else to do than to study carefully the whole 
law&#44; and believe the doctrines which it inculcates and 

<pb n="34"/>

34 SACRIFICES AND ATONEMENT. 

observe all the precepts the accompHshmeut of which 
is iu our power. 

There may be many persons who&#44; from reasoning 
on our sinfuhiess and our proneuess to evil&#44; will as&#8211; 
sert that we of our own means cannot deserve salva&#8211; 
tion&#44; and in consequence that nothing which we can 
do will insure it to us. But there is a fallacy at the 
bottom of this&#44; which a little careful reflection will 
at once detect. We may admit that we are sinful&#44; 
and that we are from our natural constitution prone 
to evil &#59; that&#44; moreover&#44; nothing which we can do is 
so meritorious in itself&#44; as to deserve the favour of 
God &#59; since with all our striving we at last do noth&#8211; 
ing to add the smallest particle to his happiness&#44; or 
increase his power by any service which we can or 
do render Him. But this does not say that we cannot 
please the Lord by our acts&#44; that we are unable to 
insure our salvation&#44; not so much by words and 
thoughts&#44; as by actions and the fulfilment of our du&#8211; 
ties which He has prescribed in his legislation. Let 
me explain myself a little more at length. If I ob&#8211; 
serve the Sabbath strictly&#44; and abstain from all la&#8211; 
bour&#44; neglect my usual pursuits&#44; do not speak of my 
private affairs by which they can be promoted on the 
days on which bodily exertion is permitted&#44; I actually 
add nothing tomy Creator&#39;s beatitude&#59; for He is as 
perfect without my resting&#44; as He is wlien I abstain 
from work &#59; consequently I can claim no reward from 
Him for any services rendered Him by my keeping 
Sabbath. But the case is very different&#44; if my rest&#8211; 
ing is regarded as a test of obedience&#44; if thereby I 
prove my devotion to God&#44; if through this means I 
exhibit to the world the example of relinquishing 

<pb n="35"/>

SACRIFICES AND ATONEMENT. 35 

mj own private interests&#44; because I am certified that 
so is the command of the Lord. Here then obedi&#8211; 
ence stamps the act as one of merit&#44; it marks it as a 
surrender of my own judgment to the wisdom of the 
Supreme&#44; it is an act of faith&#44; it testifies that I hallow 
his day because I regard Him as my God and King&#59; 
and therefore I have well&#8211;founded hopes that He will 
accept my acquiescence in his revealed will as a 
means of purifying my soul&#44; and adding to its means 
of earning salvation. The same can be said of every 
religious act which we practise&#44; be the deed small or 
large&#44; be it a pleasant or a disagreeable duty&#44; which 
we accomplish&#59; it is not the amount or quality&#44; it 
is the cheerfulness which hallows it&#44; and consequently 
will acquire for us the favour of the great Being by 
whose inspiration this particular act of faith has been 
demanded of us. 

When therefore we are told that of our own selves 
we cannot merit the favour of God&#44; we must reject 
the whole idea as unscriptural and erroneous&#44; by a 
common&#8211;sense view of our relation to our Maker. 
He evidently had a wise purpose in bestowing his 
law &#58; what now can this be &#63; can it be to make the 
life of the Israelite one of more hardship than that of 
any other man &#63; to hedge him round with prohibi&#8211; 
tions &#63; to surround him with means of transjyressions&#63; 
Evidently &#8211; not&#59; for this would be to transform the 
Merciful One into an arbitrary and cruel tyrant who&#44; 
not enough that He made us sinful by nature&#44; im&#8211; 
posed on us the additional curse of the law&#44; by which 
we must then necessarily become more and more en&#8211; 
snared&#44; so as to secure our utter perdition. This of 
itself is suflScient to prove that that could not have 

<pb n="36"/>

36 SACRIFICES AND ATONEMENT. 

beeu the intention in tlie giving of the law&#59; because 
divine goodness could not be thus inconsistent with 
itself&#44; divine wisdom could not thus contradict its 
highest predicate of perfection. Still as we have re&#8211; 
ceived the law&#44; we must look for a different solution 
of its multifarious duties and prohibitions&#59; and upon 
reflecting on the nature of man&#44; the many cares and 
distractions to which he is constantly subjected&#44; we 
will readily see that the greater the number of the 
means of righteousness which are placed at his dis&#8211; 
posal&#44; the more easy will it be for him to acquire ho&#8211; 
liness&#44; always supposing that man can attain it&#44; which 
in fact all religions allege he can do. It was said on 
a previous occasion&#44; that the accomplishment of great 
deeds is not within the reach of all men&#44; nor are they 
attainable by those who do them at all times &#59; once 
in our days we may be the means of saving a human 
being &#59; once in our life it may be granted to us to have 
the holy satisfaction of retrieving from sin a fellow&#8211; 
being by our pious persuasion &#59; but the great majority 
of our days pass in the execution of little matters&#44; 
and most men never have an opportunity to do such 
deeds of mercy as all the world calls great. Religion&#44; 
accordingly&#44; to be really the purifier of our lives&#44; 
must be in all respects commensurate with our wants 
and our nature&#59; it must be practicable&#44; it must be 
multifarious&#44; accessible alike to the wise and the sim&#8211; 
ple&#44; to the rich and the poor&#44; the powerful and the 
humble. I&#94;Tow look at the Mosaic law &#58; and what do 
you discover&#63; It teaches you how to please your 
God by deeds and by abstinence&#44; how to be obedient 
in great things&#44; and how to show your reverence in 
the afiairs of every&#8211;day life &#59; it asks not of you to be&#8211; 

<pb n="37"/>

SACRIFICES AND ATONEMENT. 37 

lieve impossibilities&#44; nor to obtain favour through de&#8211; 
basing the human intellect. It asks simply of you to 
believe in the existence of the Almighty by whose 
will you have breath and being&#44; and it demands of 
you to follow Him in the path on which He is ready 
to guide you&#44; and that you should submit to be taught 
by the &#34;Wisdom which formed your body and created 
your soul. Look upon our faith in this simple light&#44; 
and it is nothing else&#44; take any view of it you please&#44; 
and the commandments will not present themselves 
as snares to cause the unwary to stumble&#44; not as 
means to fasten yet stronger the curse of human folly 
upon the child of clay &#59; but as the purifiers of this 
very proneness to sin which we deplore&#44; as the means 
to remove from us the heart of stone which the uu&#8211; 
regenerate man&#44; in his ignorant state&#44; bears in his 
bosom&#44; and to endow us with a clear perception of 
our relation to our Maker&#44; to mollify the obduracy 
of the savage state of our nature&#44; to render us broth&#8211; 
ers of all mankind&#44; and obedient&#44; submissive children 
to the behests of our God. 

Take up any portion of our law &#8212; I use this word 
advisedly rather than religion&#44; because it is in effect 
a series of enactments to be observed &#8212; take it in pre&#8211; 
cepts of personal holiness and in its injunctions re&#8211; 
garding the claims of our fellow&#8211;men upon us &#58; and 
you will find therein precisely the same leading feat&#8211; 
ures&#44; the evident design of increasing our adoration 
for God and our readiness to serve those who like us 
are his creatures. Moreover&#44; to every class of pre&#8211; 
cepts the same admonition is attached. For instance&#44; 
we are told&#58; &#34;Observe the Sabbath to sanctity it&#59;&#34; 
the reason given us is &#34; Because thou wast a bondman

in Egyitt.&#34; So also&#44; when we are commanded&#44; &#34; Love 
ye the stranger&#44;&#34; the cause assigned is again &#34;For ye 
yourselves were strangers in the land of Egypt.&#34; 
True worship of God&#44; a clear acknowledgment of his 
unity&#44; a total rejection of idolatry&#44; and an entire sur&#8211; 
render of our wishes to his wisdom&#44; are thus founded 
npon the same reason&#44; which l&#41;ids us to protect the 
most helpless among the helpless&#44; the poor stranger 
in a strange land. God saw our affliction&#44; and laid 
bare his holy arm before the eyes of the idolaters to 
purchase us to himself as a people&#59; lie had cogni&#8211; 
zance of the wrong strangers suffered in a land which 
owed them hospitality and kindness&#59; and hy this re&#8211; 
demption He claims from us that we should only 
know Iliin as God&#44; and to confer upon all who need 
our aid those charitable offices of brotherly love&#44; 
which were most violated against ourselves not by 
Egypt alone&#44; but by all the many peoples who have 
lorded it presumptuously over Jacob&#39;s children. We 
could enlarge on this point&#44; call your attention to 
many similar injunctions&#44; but one example must suf&#8211; 
fice for the present &#59; for it is needless to enforce on 
Israelites the truth and holiness of their faith. 

Enough for our purpose that the law of JSIoses ex&#8211; 
hibits itself to us as the sole requisite means for in&#8211; 
suring salvation &#59; as the only principle neexlful to rec&#8211; 
oncile the erring child of earth to the gracious Father 
in heaven. Within the law is the balm to heal all 
wounds&#44; within it are all the appliances to assuage the 
anguish of the agonized spirit when discovering that&#44; 
led away through love for sin&#44; it has strayed from the 
fold of the beneiicent Shepherd&#44; and joined itself to 
those who seek for pasture by the broken fountains 

<pb n="39"/>

SACRIFICES AND ATONEMENT. 39 

of irreligion and false belief&#44; against the approach 
to which we are Avarned by many a prophetic voice 
which speaks to us from amidst the pages of that 
book which was written for our instruction. It would 
be evidently a monstrous absurdity to entertain the 
belief that&#44; notwithstanding the twofold state of our 
nature&#44; we would be inevitably lost the first time we 
neglected any of our duties&#44; and that no door would 
be open to us for a return to our Father&#39;s mansion&#44; 
the moment we had been lured away from duty by 
the impulse of our passions. For though we have 
been admonished by the words of Scripture&#44; and 
shown the righteous way which nothing prevents us 
from following&#58; still we are surrounded by objects 
which often call us away into tlie by&#8211;paths of iniquity&#59; 
since every departure from a strict line of duty&#44; the 
smallest even&#44; is sin. We have therefore well&#8211;founded 
hopes for believing that there is a pardon for sinners&#44; 
that the sinning soul shall not be absolutely cut off 
and forever&#44; whilst there is life left to repent and to 
return. And truly we will find it so laid down in the 
law. The Lord is merciful &#59; He is cognizant of the 
works of his hands&#44; and lie waits indulgently from 
day to day&#44; that perhaps they may become awakened 
to their sins and seek his footstool&#44; in order to be for&#8211; 
given. The very idea now of repentance demands a 
sincere trust in God&#44; or faith&#44; and secondly a perfect 
abhorrence of the wrong committed&#59; for if we do 
not have confidence in God&#44; we will not seek his par&#8211; 
don&#44; and if we love the deeds which we have done&#44; 
we cannot resolve on forsaking them. But it is for 
such an altered course of life that a remission of ouilt 
IS promised&#44; provided that a reparation be made for 

<pb n="40"/>

40 SACRIFICES AND ATONEMENT. 

the wrong inflicted&#44; in order that we may be re&#8211; 
minded that the course of life we have been hitherto 
pursuing has been one in opposition to the will of 
God&#44; and that hence we must correct the evil so far 
as this lies within our power. 

As a means of farther eftbcting this end&#44; were the 
sacrifices instituted&#44; which a man when acknowledg&#8211; 
ing his sin was ordered to bring to the altar of God&#44; 
at the place chosen from all the tribes of Israel for 
the residence of his N&#34;ame. It was&#44; however&#44; not the 
victim itself which made the atonement&#44; but the feel&#8211; 
ing of obedience which prompted the sinner to seek 
the sacred courts with his sacrifice. All the minute 
directions which we find recorded&#44; though unimpor&#8211; 
tant to human reason&#44; had to be strictly followed out&#44; 
before he could look for pardon and atonement. In 
other words&#44; the same faith which gives value to our 
greatest deeds of piety and philanthropy&#44; had to pre&#8211; 
side over the sin&#8211; trespass&#8211; or burnt&#8211;ofl&#58;ering before it 
could be regarded as deserving the acceptance of the 
Most High. But whether the rich man came with 
his bullock&#44; the humbler man with his lamb&#44; the 
countryman with his turtle&#8211;dove&#44; and the needy with 
his little flour&#44; the gifts were all alike accepted&#59; be&#8211; 
cause persons with true devotion brought them to 
acknowledge their guiltiness&#44; and sincere repentance 
presided over the sacrifice. The contrite heart&#44; the 
shame for having offended the Benefactor of the 
world&#44; entered the precincts of the temple&#59; and He&#44; 
the Father of man&#44; would not then hide his face&#59; but 
He graciously was there also&#44; and accepted the atone&#8211; 
ment from the children of his creation. 

Sacrifices&#44; according to this view&#44; were not them&#8211; 

<pb n="41"/>

SACRIFICES AND ATONEMENT. 41 

selves the atonement&#44; but only the means by which 
the believer might publicly demonstrate his sorrow 
for his transgressions &#59; since the very presence of the 
offerer at the temple&#44; coupled with the nature of the 
sacrifice&#44; demonstrated that&#44; having offended&#44; he hesi&#8211; 
tated not to avow publicly having trespassed against 
God&#44; and that he was anxious to deserve the divine 
favour which he had of right forfeited&#44; through a 
change of his conduct&#59; nor is it to be doubted that 
the solemnities consequent upon such an occasion&#44; 
the splendour of the temple&#44; the chorus of the Le&#8211; 
vites&#44; the simple magnificence of the priestly orders&#44; 
all were strongly calculated to make a lasting impres&#8211; 
sion upon the mind of the believer&#44; and leave their 
traces ineffaceable through all his after&#8211;life. But this 
does not say that there can be no forgiveness without 
sacrifices&#44; or that&#44; because we have now no temple 
and no established priesthood&#44; we are unable to ob&#8211; 
tain the forgiveness of our sins against God. For in 
the first place&#44; there must have been many cases even 
during the time of the temple when the sinner was 
unable to reach the sacred precincts&#44; being detained 
thence by distance or sickness&#44; and it would not be 
consonant with mercy to suppose that&#44; in all such in&#8211; 
stances&#44; the sacrifice being omitted&#44; no humiliation&#44; 
no repentance&#44; and no deeds of piety and humanity 
were able to weigh against the non&#8211;production of a 
beast for sacrifice. Besides this&#44; the whole tenor of 
Scripture teaches that God requires contrition and 
obedience&#44; not sacrifices &#59; that the broken and humble 
spirit will not seek forgiveness in vain. Farther&#44; it 
was already predicted&#44; in the book of Leviticus&#44; that 
a time Avould come when&#44; through the sins of our 

4&#42;

peoijle&#44; God would not accept the savour of our offer&#8211; 
ings&#59; and still we were then promised that lie would 
not forsake us&#44; nor forget the covenant which He had 
made with our fathers. Moreover&#44; it was only for 
grave offences that sacrifices were at all demanded&#44; 
whilst minor transgressions&#44; and omissions to do acts 
of righteousness&#44; were not so to he atoned for&#44; when in 
truth every wrong done or virtue omitted needs the 
forgiveness of our God to whom we are accountahle. 
Well&#44; therefore&#44; says the prophet Jeremiah &#40;vii. 21&#8211; 
23&#41; &#58; &#34; Thus suith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel&#44; 
Add your burnt&#8211; to your peace&#8211;offerings&#44; and eat the 
flesh. For I spoke not with your fathers&#44; and I com&#8211; 
manded them not on the day I brought them out of 
Egypt concerning &#40;voluntary&#41; burnt&#8211;offering and sac&#8211; 
rifice. But this word did I command them&#44; saying. 
Hearken to my voice&#44; and I will be to you a God&#44; 
and you shall be to me a people&#44; and ye shall walk in 
all the way which I will command you&#44; in order that 
it may be well with you.&#34; Obedience&#44; in other words&#44; 
was asked&#44; and the sacrifices specified were only to 
serve as a medium of justification&#44; or the outward 
evidence of a thorough repentance. But our fathers 
misapprehended their line of duty&#44; they came with 
sacrifices&#44; whilst the law remained neglected&#59; thej&#8211; 
mistook the means for the end&#44; and they were then 
notified by the prophets that their altar should be 
overthrown&#44; and their sanctuary trodden down hy the 
heavy foot of gentile armies. Still was there to be 
hope&#44; still was there to be redemption. &#34; The name

stronsr hand is stretched forth to redeem our souls 
from death&#44; provided only we abhor our misdeeds&#44; 
and knock with all our might at the gates of mercy&#59; 
for they are the entrances to the house of our benefi&#8211; 
oe&#41;&#41;t Fatlier&#44; and He stands ready with open arms to 
receive us back in his presence. It is He who says 
&#40;Isaiah xliii. 25&#41; &#58; 

&#34; It is I&#44; it is I&#44; who blot out thy transgressions for my own sake&#44; 
and thy sins I will not remember.&#34; 

Not for the sake of our righteousness&#44; not because 
we deserve his favour&#44; will He be gracious to us&#59; but 
only because He finds delight in mercy&#44; because He 
wishes to bless the children of the dust&#44; though they 
are laden with sin. O let us then turn to this blessed 
Fountain&#44; let us hasten to Him to cleanse ourselves 
from the pollution of sin&#44; and He will cause our mis&#8211; 
deeds to vanish like a cloud&#44; and we shall stand pure 
in his presence&#44; and He will bless us with his spirit&#44; 
and ransom the captives from all the earth to be again 
his own treasure&#44; as of old. Amen.

DISCOURSE IV 

THE MOSAIC POLITY AND SACRIFICES. 

God of onr fathers&#44; the eternal and exalted Ruler 
of the world &#33; look with favour upon the remnant of 
thy people in all their dwelling&#8211;places&#44; and hear their 
voice from wheresoever their prayer may be offered 
up unto Thee. From one end of the world to the 
other mankind acknowledge thy existence &#59; for in the 
very idols which they frame&#44; they confess themselves 
subject to a creative power which controls them&#59; yet 
they all walk not in thy light&#44; and they refuse to re&#8211; 
ceive instruction from the revelation which Thou hast 
made known. Yet we have received the knowledc&#94;e 
of thy truth&#44; and been trained in the faith which Thou 
didst impart to our fathers&#44; thy servants&#44; and we are 
thus freed from the bonds of superstition and unbe&#8211; 
lief&#44; which are the heritage of other men&#44; for which 
grace we return thanks to thy blessed jSTame. But 
let us entreat Thee to let thy glory be made manifest 
to all the earth&#44; cast down the altars of false worship&#44; 
and rend asunder the vail which is spread over the 
gentiles&#44; that they may look upon Thee as Thou hast 
taught us to do&#44; that they may walk in thy light&#44; 
which was kindled at Sinai&#44; as we do in obedience to 
thy decrees. And then shall we live securely in our 
land&#44; and our sacrifices will again be acceptable to 
Thee as in former years and in the days of old&#44; when

Thou alone wilt be King over all the earth&#44; and thy 
name be adored as one&#44; as Thou art indeed the sole 
Creator&#44; blessed for evermore. Amen &#33; 

Brethren&#33; 

Let us speak about the future of our nation in com&#8211; 
parison witli the past&#44; in order to strengthen ourselves 
in faith&#44; and to be obedient to the demands which our 
religion makes on us. There are men among us&#44; I 
hope they are but few&#44; who say&#44; with all vehemence 
and loud declamation&#44; that we are forever to wander 
outcast and scorned in foreign lands&#44; and that the 
commonwealth of Israel sunk to perpetuity into dis&#8211; 
jointed fragments from the time that disunion among 
the tribes&#44; in the first instance&#44; and the inroads of 
foreign conquerors in the second&#44; destroyed the ad&#8211; 
herence of the people to the house of David&#59; that our 
existence is to be merely spiritual&#44; not national &#59; that 
we are to merge quietly into the nations among which 
we dwell&#44; and should seek for no other redemption 
than a general enlightenment of the world&#44; and the 
universal diffusion of the monotheistic principle of 
our religion. Two things&#44; however&#44; are acknowl&#8211; 
edged by the supporters of this theory&#44; the first&#44; that 
the present state of belief and religion among man&#8211; 
kind is not to be permanent&#44; and the second&#44; that we 
can on no account be permitted to give up our own 
faith and practices&#44; and thus be lost among the na&#8211; 
tions&#44; or what is the same thing that&#44; though they 
would wish us to be&#44; and remain incorporated among 
the various states&#44; we should continue to be Jews in 
practice&#44; distinguished thus from our fellow&#8211;citizens 
of other persuasions in all that relates to our bearing

ill reference to worship and the arrangement of our 
faniily&#8211;coiicerns. 

It would be all very well if we had no prophetic 
records to refer to as arbiters in the question &#59; but if 
words mean anything at all&#44; they to a certainty signify 
that not alone are the two above points to be accom&#8211; 
plished&#44; but the national restoration of Israel is also 
to be effected in a manner best consonant with the 
wisdom and power of Providence. It is not to be 
denied by any ingenious pleading&#44; tliat God must 
have had u great object in view by the establishment 
of the descendants of Abraham as a peculiar people&#44; 
living in a country given to them as their property&#44; 
governed by laws and a polity eminently their own&#44; 
however they might be in themselves the product of 
divine revelation&#59; for though no human counsel was 
called in to perfect the details&#44; the whole was precisely 
adapted to the character of the people&#44; and the coun&#8211; 
try they inhabited&#44; whereas&#44; it would be almost im&#8211; 
possible to predicate the entire legislation for any 
people other than Israel&#44; and a country materially 
differing from Palestine&#44; I refer&#44; as regards the latter&#44; 
to the regulation of the festivals in connexion with the 
annual harvesting&#44; and other similar laws. 

ISTor it is not a matter of doubt&#44; but one deducible 
from the nature of the Divinity&#44; that the divine de&#8211; 
crees are based upon the solid foundation of truth&#44; 
and are not subject to change or abridgment&#59; since 
the Lord cannot change his opinion through the ac&#8211; 
cession of a new light in the process of time&#44; which 
was beyond his reach at the beginning of things. 
Consecpiently it follows&#44; that the laws regarding Israel 
as a people must always continue authoritative&#44; if even 

<pb n="47"/>

THE MOSAIC POLITY AND SACRIFICES. 47 

not executed for a time through circumstances over 
whicli they themselves have no control&#44; so that&#44; when&#8211; 
ever the circumstances inimical to them cease&#44; they 
may resume their ancient customs and usages&#44; as 
though no interruption had ever taken place. To 
presume that this were not so&#44; would be denying the 
permanence of religion&#44; and ascribe vaciUation to 
God &#59; whereas we are constantly told by all prophets 
that precisely the reverse is the case&#44; if even simple 
reasoning from philosophically demonstrated prem&#8211; 
ises were insutficient to convince us of this truth. 
But with the permanence of the particulars of the 
Mosaic polity is inseparably connected the nationality 
of the Israelites upon the soil of Palestine&#44; in order 
that the annual offerings and sacriHces may be 
brought in their proper season&#44; as we are commanded 
in the law. Let us instance the festivals of Passover 
and Pentecost. On the first we are commanded to 
offer an omer&#8211;full of barley&#44; as the first produce of the 
harvest&#44; and on the latter two loaves of fresh wheaten 
flour&#44; both as national offerings to the Bestower of 
fruitfulness and plenty. We need not argue that no 
country in the regions of cold Europe&#44; or northern 
America and Asia&#44; nor any situated on the south side 
of the equator&#44; could enable us to fulfil these particu&#8211; 
lar injunctions at their respective periods&#59; for in the 
one case the grain ripens at a later season&#44; in the other 
in an opposite part of the year. There are certainly 
other lands where the harvest is as early as in Pales&#8211; 
tine &#59; but this much is certain&#44; that our own ancient 
heritage enabled us to fulfil the injunctions in tpes&#8211; 
tion without any difficulty&#44; and hence&#44; to say the least&#44; 
it is not less advantageously situated in this respect 

<pb n="48"/>

48 TFIE MOSAIC POLITY AND SACRIFICES. 

than any other land nndor the snn. This considera&#8211; 
tion may appear to some a small matter&#59; but in truth 
it is not so&#59; for it proves that the most consummate 
wisdom directed the arrangement of the details of the 
law&#44; so that they should tally faithfully with one an&#8211; 
other. If now&#44; to resume the argument&#44; our religion 
is in its nature permanent&#44; and requires at the same 
time a certain locality for its perfect execution &#58; it 
follows that a time will come&#44; when the people pro&#8211; 
fessing this religion shall be enabled to fulfil to the 
letter all the duties enjoined on them&#44; precisely as 
they were originally commanded &#59; and since they are 
now so situated through acts not their own&#44; though 
they came as an infliction for their sins&#44; that they are 
not enabled to assemble at the place where the pecu&#8211; 
liar rites of their faith are to be observed&#44; they will 
not be held responsible nor accounted as sinful for 
not fulfilling all those peculiar duties&#44; which are 
bound hy an express injunction of the law to the 
country of Palestine. 

This being the case&#44; and hardly any believing Is&#8211; 
raelite will deny our premises&#44; it likewise follows that 
our redemption from our present state of bondage in 
some lands&#44; and the subjection to antibiblical laws in 
all&#44; cannot be accomplished by a mere civil emanci&#8211; 
pation &#59; for this would still leave us beyond the pos&#8211; 
sibility of satislying the demands of our religion. We 
do not ask merely to be free from tyrannical rule&#44; but 
to see the supremacy of our code restored. There 
may perhaps be a few unbelievers who pretend to say 
that the pains and penalties of the Mosaic legislation 
are barbarous&#44; and uncongenial with the progress of 
an enlightened civilization&#59; but they surely cannot 

<pb n="49"/>

have correctly examined the details of jurisprudence 
it lays down &#59; nor the great safeguards it throws 
around all the members of the commonwealth&#59; nor 
the deep and searching inquiry which constitutes a 
prominent feature in the arraignment of criminals &#59; 
nor the responsibility of the witnesses for false charges&#44; 
even at the risk of their lives &#59; nor the institutions of 
the cities of refuge to prevent the disgraceful scenes 
of private vengeance&#44; which disfigure modern times 
even with all their boasted refinement &#59; nor the per&#8211; 
fect security of property&#44; both personal and landed 
estates&#44; to the possessor&#59; nor the inviolability of 
character&#44; the absence of the branding&#8211;iron for minor 
criminals&#44; the public whipping&#8211;post&#44; the sale of the 
maintenance of the poor to the lowest bidder&#44; the 
venality of a corrupt system of justice&#59; nor&#44; in short&#44; 
the whole tenor of our legislation proper&#44; so pure in 
its details&#44; so holy in its principles. 

The crimes for which death is the forfeit are cer&#8211; 
tainly more numerous than the fancies of modern 
philanthropists would sanction&#44; if their opinions were 
to be consulted. Let it&#44; however&#44; not be forgotten 
that the penalty of death&#44; denounced in the Mosaic 
Law&#44; is only against crimes of the gravest character&#58; 
murder&#44; incest&#44; disobedience against paternal au&#8211; 
thority&#44; wounding or cursing father and mother&#44; re&#8211; 
bellion against the chief judicial authority&#44; false accu&#8211; 
sation where life was at stake&#44; violation of the Sabbath&#44; 
blasphemy&#44; idolatry&#44; seduction to idolatry&#44; false proph&#8211; 
ecy&#44; incest&#44; and&#44; finally&#44; selling into slavery a fellow&#8211; 
Israelite. No one need expose himself to the com&#8211; 
mission of any of these deeds&#59; consequently any citizen 
of the state can escape the utmost penalty of the law

without any difficulty&#59; none could be seized and 
condemned by the arbitrary command of any ruler&#44; 
nor could conviction take place except in open court&#44; 
upon the clearest and most irrefragable testimony of 
two men of known probity&#44; upon their parole evi&#8211; 
dence&#44; given in the presence of the criminal&#44; that they 
saw him engaged in the crime&#44; and&#44; as is said&#44; with 
warning him of the consequence of his misdeed. Life 
so hedged round with judicial defences could not be 
easily put in jeopardy&#59; and when the doom was&#44; not&#8211; 
withstanding all this&#44; pronounced by a majority of 
the judges&#44; never less than twenty&#8211;three&#44; for this was 
our practice&#44; of whom thirteen must have been for 
conviction&#44; the guilt must have been so incontestably 
proved that the malefactor himself could not have 
complained of injustice. I know that efforts are now 
making to banish from the codes all punishments of 
death for whatever offence&#44; upon the ground that we 
Lave no right to take life&#44; since we cannot restore it 
after taking it away. But have we any more right 
to deprive a man of his personal liberty&#44; shut him up 
like a noxious beast for life in the narrow walls of a 
prison cell&#44; barred out from all intercourse Avith the 
world&#44; even the good&#44; save the few that may happen 
to seek his prison&#8211;house by special permission of his 
jailors&#63; Amoral discourse is not the most fitting 
vehicle for the discussion. I only touched upon it 
incidentally&#44; in connexion with the law of Moses. I 
must therefore be brief&#44; and answer the query with a 
single remark. Society&#44; without referring to religion 
as the basis thereof&#44; has a claim upon eac&#8211;h one of its 
members&#44; that be shall be pledged&#44; with all he pos&#8211; 
sesses&#44; for his good behaviour towards all others&#59; he 

<pb n="51"/>

THE MOSAIC POLITY AND SACRIFICES 51 

therefore stakes his property&#44; his liberty&#44; and his life&#44; 
that is&#44; all which he can have&#44; that he will be amen&#8211; 
able with them all in case he do anything to the in&#8211; 
jury of his neighbour individually&#44; or the state in 
general. Hence if he commits a fraud or theft&#44; his 
property may be taken from him &#59; if he disturbs the 
public peace&#44; he may be put under restraint by im&#8211; 
prisonment&#44; if a fine previously imposed should have 
failed to arrest his unlawful behaviour&#59; and lastly&#44; if 
he deprives another of life&#44; his own earthly existence 
is the only forfeit which is at all commensurate with 
the violence committed&#59; it is not that the dead de&#8211; 
mands the requital of life with life&#44; but only to place 
others in security&#44; that murders shall not be commit&#8211; 
ted&#44; and because the state or society at large cannot 
become of right chargeable with the safe&#8211;keeping of 
a man who has shown such a recklessness of the per&#8211; 
sonal rights of others&#44; that his escape or release may 
expose those who are innocent&#44; and therefore have a 
right to protection&#44; to renewed danger from his vio&#8211; 
lent and bloodthirsty disposition. The ridiculous 
sympathy with criminals of the highest degree&#44; to&#8211; 
gether with the trickery of the law&#44; which will not 
be satisfied with the most positive proof of guilt&#44; is 
only calculated to rob society of its security&#44; to arm 
man against his brother&#44; in order to seek justice by 
his own strong hand&#44; since an appeal to courts of mis&#8211; 
called justice often fails to redress the grievances of 
which he complains. Besides&#44; it levels all crimes by 
making them all punishable with the same visitation&#44; 
the prison being for each and for all the only corrective &#59; 
and the duration of the confinement&#44; though in some 
cases called perpetual&#44; is necessarily left to the arbi&#8211;

traiy will of extra&#8211;jndicial aiitlioritios&#44; which every 
state or comnionwealth is compelled to recognize. 
That society is therefore the best governetl&#44; in tliat 
community are life&#44; limb&#44; liberty&#44; and goods the safest&#44; 
where each individual is held strictly accountable&#44; 
and the laws are so administered&#44; that the certainty 
of punishment is always at hand to check the criminal 
inclinations&#44; which will more or less rise up in the 
minds of most men. 

Judged by this standard&#44; the Mosaic polity is of all 
others the only one which apportions punishment to 
crime&#44; which in its worst inflictions regards the crimi&#8211; 
nal as a brother&#44; whose misdeeds&#44; if they can be 
amended with minor visitations&#44; can be thus atoned for&#44; 
and he be restored to the bosom of society&#59; whereas&#44; 
when this is not possible&#44; he must sacrifice his earthly 
existence for the happiness of others. We could en&#8211; 
large &#59; but we must forbear for the present &#59; enough 
we have shown that the permanence of the law&#44; in 
its civil details&#44; no less than those properly called 
religious&#44; can be maintained to its fullest extent&#44; 
should our state be ever restored&#44; and we need not 
dread the severity of some enactments&#44; even when 
viewed by the light of an advanced civilization and 
the march of discovery&#44; so far superior to what was 
known at the time when Moses wrote down the 
statutes which he had received from the Most High. 

The reasonableness of the sacrifices and otierings&#44; 
to continue the subject with which we started&#44; is not 
deducible from human wisdom&#44; but simply we are to 
abide by them as they are divine decrees. I know 
well enough that many good men among us and the 
gentiles have endeavoured to establish their origin in 

<pb n="53"/>

THE MOSAIC POLITY AND SACRIFICES. 53 

something to which paganism had accustomed our 
fathers &#59; but such a sohition does not seem consonant 
with the wisdom of God&#44; nor with the fact that offer&#8211; 
ings are mentioned as already in existence with the 
immediate children of Adam&#44; consequently they are 
almost as old as the presence of man on earth. It is 
enough for us to know that they became incorporated 
in the Mosaic legislation as a duty appertaining to 
the temple&#8211;service on every day in the year&#44; and no 
reason was assigned other than that they should be&#44; 
as the Bible terms it&#44; nn&#34;j nn &#34; an agreeable savour&#44;&#34; 
which&#44; so to say&#44; the Lord of all would smell as their 
smoke ascended&#44; and receive it as a token of obe&#8211; 
dience of his servants&#44; for which He would accept 
them in favour. Many&#44; not satisfied with viewing 
sacrifices in the light of a statute&#44; given as a test of 
obedience&#44; for which&#44; therefore&#44; no other reason can 
be discovered&#44; have endeavoured to give them a mys&#8211; 
tical&#44; or Avith others a typical solution&#44; and arranged 
thus all to their own satisfaction&#44; and have arrived at 
length at the conclusion that they have ceased for&#8211; 
ever&#44; the object for which they were instituted having 
been accomplished. But the words of Scripture bear 
no trace of any such grounds&#59; we are merely told 
that so should be done to obtain for us atonement&#59; 
but nothing is hinted of any especial mystery being 
connected with a burnt&#8211; or sin&#8211;offfering&#44; nor that either 
of them was a type of any event&#44; past or future. Con&#8211; 
sequently&#44; if our position is correct&#44; that the whole 
scheme was a special ordinance&#44; neither originating 
in pagan rites&#44; nor terminable by any supposititious 
fulfilment of their object at the happening of any 
particular event&#58; it must result as a necessary deduc&#8211;

tion&#44; that we are not empowered to assume that the 
sacrifices of Judah and Jerusalem will not be accep&#8211; 
table again at a time to come&#59; but the rather&#44; that it 
is absolutely requisite&#44; both from reason and proph&#8211; 
ecy that&#44; with the restoration of the Jewish people&#44; 
the sacrifices&#44; with all the other institutions of the 
priesthood&#44; will be likewise re&#8211;established. The law 
was given to be forever remembered &#59; years and ages 
of troubles have passed over it no less than over its 
possessors&#59; and still it is the study of millions of 
enlightened spirits&#44; and it has exerted&#44; and continues 
to do so still&#44; an irresistible power over the march of 
civilization. Can it then be presumed for a moment 
that any portion of its contents should be a mere 
accommodation to circumstances and&#44; the religious 
enactments especially&#44; only inserted to act as a mere 
negation to other ideas foreign to its holiness&#63; Con&#8211; 
sequently the whole of it must be of equal importance&#44; 
of equal duration&#44; as all its parts are of equal sanc&#8211; 
tity&#44; and that therefore nothing contained therein but 
will again be practised&#44; whenever the opportunity and 
occasion may again demand them. 

As to the possibility of the restoration&#44; it is not nec&#8211; 
essary to frame any argument. God redeemed us 
before this from the slavery of Egypt&#44; and again res&#8211; 
cued us from the power of Babylon&#44; and both times 
we journeyed to Palestine&#44; established the worship 
in the temple&#44; and resisted successfuUy the foreign 
foe. Why He should not be enabled to do the same 
deed again&#44; is beyond the power of my imagination to 
ascertain&#59; the unwillingness of the scattered Israel&#8211; 
ites themselves is the greatest difficulty &#59; but in his 
good providence He will devise the means&#44; equally

as He did when in Egypt the contented slaves said to 
Moses &#58; &#34; Leave off from us&#44; that we may serve the 
Egyptians&#59; for Ave had hetter serve the Egyptians 
than perish in the wilderness.&#34; But who heeded 
their opposition &#63; who regarded the refusal of their 
tyrant to grant their freedom &#63; Let sacred history 
tell&#44; how the reluctant obtained their liberty&#44; and how 
the unwilling ruler was forced to yield. And now&#44; 
has the Lord forsaken Israel&#63; Do his thunders 
sleep &#63; have his lightnings lost their brightness and 
their fearful force &#63; Look up to the heavens&#44; whether 
dressed with the brilliance of the day&#44; or clad in the 
sombre garments of the night &#59; let the seasons speak&#44; 
whether they do not change in their wonted regu&#8211; 
larity&#44; and produce plenty or dearth as their Master 
and ours may decree &#59; ask of the ocean whether his 
roarings are not controlled by the same mighty Hand 
that cleft before the ransomed the waters of the Ara&#8211; 
bian Sea &#58; and then tell me&#44; that the same Force 
which scattered us cannot gather us again together&#44; 
that the same Being who broke the power of ruthless 
rulers cannot accomplish the same work again&#44; that 
the God who established his kingdom in the midst 
of our tribes&#44; who sighed for the galling bonds of 
slavery&#44; will not come again to reign triumphantly as 
the King of Israel and the Chief of the nations &#63; We 
may be unwilling to go forth &#59; we may prefer the 
lands of our captivity where we enjoy freedom and 
security as the boon only of righteous gentiles &#59; but 
prophecy tells us that we shall nevertheless be sent 
forward from our exile&#44; again to inhabit the hills and 
valleys of lovely Palestine&#44; then restored to its fer&#8211; 
tility&#44; its sweet soil cleansed from the foot of maraud&#8211;

ing savages that now defile it by their noxious pres&#8211; 
ence. In mute surprise&#44; unbelief will ask in the 
words of the prophet Isaiah &#40;Ixvi. 8&#41;&#44; &#34; Who hath 
heard the like&#63; who hath seen such thincrs&#63; shall a 
land be made to travail in one day&#63; or shall a na&#8211; 
tion be born at once&#63; that Zion hath travailed&#44; also 
brought forth her children &#63;&#34; And we are answered &#58; 

&#34; And they shall bring all your brethren out of all nations as an 
offering unto the Lord&#44; upon horses&#44; and in chariots&#44; and in letters&#44; 
and upon mules&#44; and upon swift beasts&#44; to my holy mountain Jeru&#8211; 
salem&#44; saith the Lord&#44; as the children of Israel bring an offering in 
a clean vessel into the house of the Lord.&#34; &#40;Verse 20.&#41; 

Let&#44; like Pharaoh of old&#44; the rulers of the earth 
say&#44; &#34; We know not the Lord&#44; nor will we let Israel 
go free&#59;&#34; let us say&#44; &#34; We will rather be subject to 
many kings and states than free citizens of Palestine 
under the government of the Lord&#39;s anointed &#59;&#34; the 
word which was spoken before the overthrow of our 
state will be fulfilled&#44; and in one day&#44; like it was at

to stand before the sanctuary to make atonement for 
the people.&#34; &#40;Ezek. xlv. 17.&#41; And as respects all 
the world&#44; each man will cast away his follies and 
idols&#44; and mankind will seek to know the Creator of 
all heaven and earth&#44; acknowledging that they had

spot to decide with equity for high and low&#44; and all 
flesh will come on every new&#8211;moon day from month 
to month&#44; and Sabbath to Sabbath&#44; on the days held 
sacred by the ordinance of God among the children 
of Israel&#44; to bow down and to worship at the shrine

DISCOURSE V. 

THE SPIRITUALITY OF JUDAISM. 

Guardian of man &#33; God of everlasting &#33; how glo&#8211; 
rious art thou in. Thy unsearchable greatness&#44; which is 
displayed over the face of creation&#44; like a canopy of 
light encircling all that exists&#59; for wdiithersoever we 
turn our ardent gaze&#44; there too we shall meet with 
the undeniable traces of thy presence. Whether we 
dwell in the farthest East&#44; or seek a home in the most 
distant West&#59; whether we are surrounded by the ice 
of the frozen poles&#44; or pant exhausted amidst the 
heats of the burning tropics&#44; it is only thy hand that 
guides&#44; thy eye which sees us. In the gloom of night 
and in the brilliancy of the day thy providence keeps 
watch over us&#44; and our feet are made to stand firm&#44; 
or our steps are made to totter&#44; just as it pleases thy 
will to hold us up or to cast us down. O that this 
truth might be firmly enthroned in the being of our 
soul &#33; that we may thereby be rendered conscious 
of our accountability&#44; ever prepared to follow the 
dictates of thy will&#44; and be ready at all times to fol&#8211; 
low thy guidance&#44; and shun sin and pursue righteous&#8211; 
&#33;iess. Be it then thy will&#44; to strengthen the desire 
lor good iidierent in us&#44; and aid us in our struggle in 
the subduing of our bad passions&#59; so that we may 
escape from the snare of iniquity&#44; and stand in thy 
presence as children of salvation&#44; as those whose God

Brethren &#33; 

No doubt you have been often assailed in your in&#8211; 
tercourse with your gentile neighbours with the ob&#8211; 
jection&#44; whenever religion became the topic of con&#8211; 
versation&#44; that our faith was merely a ceremonial 
burdensome sort of belief&#44; a something in which the 
spirit has but little aliment&#44; and in which the higher 
duties of humanity occupy only a subordinate posi&#8211; 
tion&#44; or played at least a very inferior part. There 
are also no doubt men who call themselves Jews&#44; 
who nevertheless from a sheer unacquaintance with 
their spiritual concerns are of the opinion just stated&#44; 
and decry Judaism as a gross system of ceremoniali&#8211; 
ties and outward observances. But if we come to 
look into the Scriptures for light&#44; nay if we only ob&#8211; 
serve the practical eflect of our faith in the conduct 
of a believing Israelite&#44; we must readily discover that 
our religion lacks nothing of all that can elevate the 
mind&#44; refine the sentiment&#44; and lead man to look up&#44; 
in all things&#44; for aid and consolation to his Father in 
heaven. There is a nervousness in many persons 
when religion is spoken of&#44; for fear that the one they 
profess should be found to contain the largest num&#8211; 
ber of positive duties&#44; as though this circumstance 
must necessarily derogate from its usefulness and 
holiness&#59; and hence they are so anxious to make it 
appear that the essence or spirit of Judaism does not 
consist in them but in something else which is more 
akin to those easy religions where belief is everything&#44; 
and observances as such are of very subordinate im&#8211;

portance. Now it is not to be denied&#44; that belief&#44; 
faith&#44; or the acquiescence in the truth of certain fun&#8211; 
damental principles must be held as the basis of any 
line of conduct &#59; for without such belief no one could 
be induced to pursue any course of life &#59; but as Jews 
we must deem it equally futile to be satisfied with 
mere belief&#44; if the result springing from it should be 
only a reproduction of itself&#59; and hence we need ex&#8211; 
press no alarm&#44; for the soundness of the law&#44; because 
it ostensibly demands a fulfilment of many outward 
acts as obligatory in consonance with its principles. 
Let us depart a little from the strict line of argument 
into illustration. Faith or belief demands that we 
believe or receive as true one or more doctrines with&#8211; 
out which our religion or any other religion cannot 
have any existence. This does not mean that we must 
not investigate&#44; whether this one is or these many 
principles are true or not&#59; only that&#44; if we say we be&#8211; 
long to such a one or the other church&#44; society&#44; or 
relio&#59;ion&#44; we have satisfied ourselves that the doo&#94;mas 
on which it rests are true&#44; so far as we can discover. 
There are&#44; however&#44; multitudes who merely receive 
opinions without search or inquiry&#59; they are taught 
by parents&#44; preceptors&#44; or associates&#44; or they as it 
were intuitively receive certain impressions&#44; and they 
accept them as proved&#44; regardless that the&#59;f have in&#8211; 
stituted no inquiry whether there may or may not be 
some fundamental errors in the very inception of 
their received views. But conviction is often the re&#8211; 
sult of the most careful analysis which the mind is 
capable of&#59; there are large numbers&#44; and have always 
been&#44; who bring to the study of religion an extensive 
acquaintance with the phenomena of nature&#44; a fa&#8211;

miliar knowledge of antiquity and the history of the 
day&#44; and a penetrating insight into the character and 
functions of man. Men&#44; such as these&#44; have also come 
to the conclusion that there is good reason for the ac&#8211; 
ceptance of religion&#44; and they feel accordingly within 
themselves a conviction of the truths it teaches &#59; they 
believe as much therefore in the existence of the God&#8211; 
head and the existence of a revelation&#44; as though 
they had become practically acquainted with the Cre&#8211; 
ator&#44; and had themselves received direct instruction 
from Him. We will admit that the exact sciences&#44; 
such as mathematics and chemistry&#44; are capable of a 
better demonstration than reliÂ£&#58;ion is. But thouo&#8211;li 
they proceed from clearly laid down principles&#44; it is 
nevertheless true that in them also we must assume 
certain axioms before we can proceed to build our 
superstructures. Those who know the sciences will 
readily understand my meaning&#59; and to those who 
do not&#44; it may be sufficient to state that the most 
magnificent triumphs of astronomy&#44; astonishing and 
true though they be&#44; rest at last upon a foundation 
which assumes certain things as true without any pos&#8211; 
sibilitj&#8211; of proving their correctness&#44; farther than that 
they are evident and can be actually brought into 
practice. If we proceed equally with religion&#44; and 
assume that notliing we see around us can make it&#8211; 
self&#59; that every being we have any ocular or sensual 
perception of is destructible&#44; renewable&#44; and therefore 
finite &#58; we come to the next step&#44; that there must be 
a Power somewhere&#44; though we cannot show&#44; nor 
demonstrate&#44; nor understand how He exists&#44; who is 
of necessity not alone able to produce the things the 
origin of which we feel must be derived&#59; but who is

indestructible by tbeni and superior to each one sep&#8211; 
arately or to the whole of them combined&#44; or in other 
words&#44; the weakness of each separate part of outward 
nature&#44; the liability of all to decay&#44; and the convic&#8211; 
tion that all must have had an origin&#44; lead us to the 
adoption of the idea of an omnipotent Creator&#44; the 
Author of all we know&#44; the Ruler of all of which we 
have any conception. 

If we now go farther into an inquiry into the nature 
and organization of the sentient beings on earth&#44; that 
is to say into the constitution&#44; mental and physical&#44; 
of men &#58; we will be struck with the remarkable fact&#44; 
that though all claim to have a notion of what is 
called among them right and wrongs few only agree as 
to the precise items which make up the general idea 
of these two principles. Moreover we shall speedily 
arrive at the conviction that we have all&#44; individually 
and collectively&#44; a strong and paramount interest in 
the idea which prevails on this point&#59; since each of 
us is individually interested to a considerable extent&#44; 
as regards his personal safety&#44; domestic comforts&#44; and 
the pursuits he may engage in&#44; in the whole range of 
conduct which others may deem it right to pursue 
towards himself. For instance&#44; every one is especially 
interested that no other man shall be permitted to take 
away his life&#44; or to wound and maim him &#59; to enter his 
dwelling and to deprive him of his wife and children &#59; 
and lastly&#44; to obstruct him at pleasure in the prosecu&#8211; 
tion of his employment&#44; and to take from him the 
fruits of his industry. &#8212; It is now evident&#44; I say&#44; to a 
mere cursory observer even&#44; that mankind are not 
all agreed about their ideas concerning this right and 
wrong&#44; and that moreover this disagreement is greatly 

<pb n="63"/>

THE SPIRITUALITY OF JUDAISM. 63 

modified by or depending on the peculiar conception 

they have respectively of the character of tlie Creator&#59; 
or that in fact the so&#8211;called moral obligations which 
mankind acknowledge are in conformity to the spec&#8211; 
ulative or assumed opinions regarding the Godhead 
which they place as the foundation of their systems&#59; 
and this holds good not alone with distant communi&#8211; 
ties who have from some cause or the other adop&#8211;ted 
either simultaneously or by degrees certain peculiar 
ideas or matters of belief&#44; but among different per&#8211; 
sons of the same state&#44; city&#44; community&#44; or lastly 
family &#59; since in all there is a marked and percepti&#8211; 
ble difference of conduct&#44; just in proportion as they 
have one or the other opinion in regard to the Uni&#8211; 
versal Cause from Avhom all originates. This being 
so&#44; and your own experience will convince you of it&#44; 
the deepest thinker and the most astute philosopher&#44; 
though they at the first outset are devoid of any posi&#8211; 
tive belief in anything&#44; may at length come to this sim&#8211; 
ple inquiry &#58; &#34; Since we see that there is a Supreme 
Intelligence discoverable in everything which we 
behold with our n.aked eye&#44; and also in the immen&#8211; 
sity of space whither we penetrate with the instru&#8211; 
ments of science&#59; since we discover that man pos&#8211; 
sesses in a remarkable degree the power of judging 
and weighing with his mind any fact presented to 
him &#58; is it to be supposed that though instructed in 
everything else&#44; he should have been left altogether 
ignorant of his relation towards his fellow&#8211;man and 
to his Creator &#63; Of himself man seems utterly unable 
to solve the various problems of moral government&#59; 
for all experience hitherto has taught us that not two 
will come to the same conclusion in this respect&#59; 

<pb n="64"/>

64 THE SPIRITUALITY OF JUDAISM. 

consequently there can be no moral guidance&#44; unless 
there be a direct instruction from the Creator to the 
creature&#44; by which he can&#44; if so he is inclined&#44; frame 
a universal and uniform rule of conduct for all cir&#8211; 
cumstances and throughout all generations. This 
question must present itself to every thinker&#59; and then 
he will readily cast a view around himself to see ichere 
such an instruction can be found&#59; and if he should 
then be presented with a volume of the Scriptures for 
the first time in his life&#44; and trace therein the uniform 
laws of charity and universal benevolence &#58; he would 
necessarily come to the conclusion that at length his 
search is satisfied&#44; and that&#44; although there are things 
which he cannot at once adopt&#44; they are in the main 
precisely such rules for the moral government of the 
world as in their tendency will be permanent and 
universally beneficial&#44; consequently that the Scrip&#8211; 
tural records contain precisely that sort of code which 
will answer for the moral government of the world 
in regard to the right and the wrong&#44; and that there&#8211; 
fore every one by conforming thereto will contribute 
to the well&#8211;being of his fellow&#8211;men&#44; and secure&#44; so far 
as may be&#44; his own personal security and well&#8211;being. 
I remarkedjust now that at a first view of the Scrip&#8211; 
tures an unprejudiced thinker would come to the 
conclusion that in the main they contain what he 
could readily adopt&#44; whilst there are other things in 
which he could not acquiesce at once withoat farther 
inquiry. I refer in the latter clause to the ceremonial 
observances&#44; which have no reference ostensibly to 
the moral conduct of man to man&#44; and seem therefore 
merely arbitrary enactments without any just reason 
for their existence. But we could easily satisfy him 

<pb n="65"/>

THE SPIRITUALITY OF JUDAISM. 65 

of their necessity and propriety&#44; if we recur to the 
time and circumstances at and under which the whole 
code in question was made known. We might tell 
him that history teaches us that&#44; from the very begin&#8211; 
ning of the presence of man on earth&#44; he was certified 
of his duties and responsibilities &#59; but that he soon 
forgot or neglected the demands made of him&#44; though 
they were solely given for his own benefit. That at 
length after the mutations of centuries had still found 
man rejecting instruction as often as it had been re&#8211; 
newed&#44; the Almighty created a new thing&#44; a nation&#44; 
that is to say&#44; one with peculiar usages and customs&#44; 
who were to become proprietors of the code in which 
the Almighty had made his will known&#44; and they 
were to retain its guardianship uutil such time&#44; as 
the remaining portions of mankind should come to 
acknowledge the same fundamental principle and 
adopt it as their guide and law&#59; in the words of a 
portion of that very record&#44; which are &#58; &#34; Lord&#44; my 
strength&#44; and my fortress&#44; and my refuge on the day 
of trouble &#33; unto Thee shall nations come from the 
ends of the earth&#44; and say&#44; ITothing but falsehood 
have our fathers inherited&#44; vanity&#44; wherein there is 
no profit.&#34; &#40;Jeremiah xvi. 19.&#41; We can tell him that 
the only way to preserve this precious knowledge of 
truth and morality was by surrounding its professors 
with such a line of defences&#44; as would prevent their 
being assimilated to&#44; and thereby absorbed by the 
large masses of men who would not admit their di&#8211; 
vinely&#8211;revealed opinions of the Deity&#44; nor adopt the 
peculiar laws which had in this manner been delivered 
to them. The ceremonial duties are therefore easily 
shown to be of great signiticancy and meaning&#59; they

are the landmarks by whicli the believers iu revela&#8211; 
tion cau regulate themselves&#44; and preserve at the same 
time for their own persons and their families that ac&#8211; 
quaintance with their relation to God and man&#44; which 
was given to them when first they appeared in the 
world as an independent and distinct people&#44; as a 
separate and marked race though but comparatively 
few in number. &#8212; The ceremonies in themselves are 
however of such a nature as to inflict no injury upon 
any man &#59; they are matters of observance for the in&#8211; 
dividual or the people&#59; 3&#34;ct in no one thing do they 
trench upon the rights and personal security of others&#44; 
whether they adopt them or not&#59; they wea&#8211;e to limit 
and restrain men in certain things&#44; and thereby make 
them better members of society and more devout fol&#8211; 
lowers of religion than they would otherwise be&#59; es&#8211; 
pccially was this to be so with the people to whom they 
were given&#44; to distinguish them from all others by 
outward tokens and visible means&#44; and as being dis&#8211; 
tinct and separate from those who did not think 
themselves thus bound and restricted. 

What harm cau therefore be attributed to the cere&#8211; 
monies &#63; are they so derogatory to human reason that 
we should be ashamed of them&#44; or hide ourselves in 
an obscure corner when practising them&#63; is it con&#8211; 
sonant wilh common sense for us to yield our own 
received opinions that we may not be taunted with 
being ceremonialists&#63; It is strange indeed how little 
many of us understand the full strength of their re&#8211; 
ligion. They ought to be told over &#59;uid over again 
that Judaism is a system of practical duties based 
upon belief&#44; and that anything short of this standard 
is not Judaism &#59; make any system ever so beautiful&#44; 

<pb n="67"/>

THE SPIRITUALITY OF JUDAISM. 67 

poetical&#44; and enchanting&#44; speak of its purifying the 
soul&#44; rendering it fit for heaven &#59; but unless it be full 
of activity&#44; full of life and works&#44; it is not the religion 
which we have received from Sinai&#59; and this is at 
last that which we should strive to accomplish&#44; and 
endeavour to conform to as the standard set up for 
us by our divine Legislator. &#34;Were it indeed that 
Moses&#44; or any one else&#44; had of his own heart in&#8211; 
vented the law of Israel&#44; no matter how many good 
ordinances it contained &#58; we might then find reason to 
choose and to reject&#44; just as our fancy might dictate. 
But&#44; if our religion is worth anything at all&#44; if it really 
deserves to be called divine in its origin and develop&#8211; 
ment&#44; we cannot permit ourselves to measure the im&#8211; 
portance or otherwise of any of its ordinances by any 
scale short of itself&#59; for the whole law as we have re&#8211; 
ceived it is beyond the reach of human reason. And 
to descend to particularities&#44; what effect is religion to 
have on the mind of man &#63; Evidently a twofold one&#44; 
to acknowledge his subjection to God&#44; his Creator&#44; 
and to exercise justice in the fullest sense of the word 
towards other mortals. Whatever&#44; then&#44; promotes 
these two objects&#44; &#8212; and religion can have no other&#44; 
since we ourselves are individually among those to 
whom we have duties to perform&#44; &#8212; is a legitimate 
branch of religion&#44; and deserves&#44; nay demands&#44; the 
most careful observance. Ceremonies however were 
given to us that we might remember the Creator in 
every stage and position of life&#44; and&#44; consequently be 
reminded of our accountability for all our acts and 
omissions&#59; and&#44; in consequence&#44; being so reminded 
and taught&#44; we shall be naturally the more induced 
to watch carefully our own conduct&#44; so that we may

do no injury to onr neighbour&#44; or abridge his rights 
and possessions in the smallest degree&#44; whether this 
might be for our advantage or not. What is it to us 
that other religions demand less duty&#63; permit greater 
license &#63; have few or no prohibitions against many 
indulgences interdicted to us &#63; When&#44; lo &#33; these in&#8211; 
dulgences were not granted to Israelites&#44; nor are cal&#8211; 
culated to educate a kingdom of priests and a holy 
nation of missionaries&#44; who by their living teaching&#44; 
their silent cxam&#94;jle&#44; and their constant presence&#44; are 
ultimately to reform the whole earth&#44; and render it 
the throne of the Blessed One who lives forever. We 
have no reason whatever to search into the gospel&#44; 
Koran&#44; the Vedas&#44; the Roman or French code&#44; no 
motive to inquire of a heathen philosophy or the 
discoveries of modern reekers for wisdom&#44; to know 
how we are to act&#58; all is clearly pointed out to us in 
its principal features in the written word which is 
ours&#44; and the observances under the same that have 
come down to us from many ages of pious prede&#8211; 
cessors&#44; and form those decisions and particular du&#8211; 
ties&#44; which now constitute our customs and observ&#8211; 
ance under and in consonance with the law. 

As respects to ceremonies themselves they consti&#8211; 
tute the active part of religion &#59; they are the daily or 
periodical exercises&#44; as the case may be&#44; of faith and 
obedience to the teaching of God. Were it that all 
religion should consist in mere acts of humanity and 
moral propriety&#94; all our duties might then be per&#8211; 
formed from a cold calculation of personal advantage&#59; 
since we might naturally expect a reciprocity in kind 
for whatever good we executed. But now we have a 
number of commandments which we are to observe 

<pb n="69"/>

THE SPIRITUALITY OF JUDAISM. 69 

from motives of gratitude solely&#44; or as remembrances 
of the favours which we have received individually 
or nationally from the Giver of all good &#59; and we have 
thus an opportunity of being active in piety although 
we care not to have the eyes of our fellow&#8211;men di&#8211; 
rected upon us&#44; and without expecting the least re&#8211; 
ward or return from them &#59; since the deeds in question 
do not concern others&#44; and have no ostensible bearing 
upon the welfare of society at large. 

But we may perhaps be told&#44; that there are many 
ceremonial Jews who are dishonest and immoral&#44; 
who neglect the duties towards men&#44; whilst they are 
strictly observant of all the outward forms of religion. 
For argument&#39;s sake we will admit the fact to be so. 
But it only says that we have people among us&#44; like 
all other classes&#44; who either do not understand their 
whole duty&#44; or fail of reaching the standard of perfec&#8211; 
tion which is prescribed to them. Men like these 
have taken an imperfect view of religion&#44; and are 
therefore in error&#59; but the duties they fulfil&#44; whilst 
they are thus imperfect&#44; are nevertheless part and 
parcel of what the Lord demands of them to do. &#8212; 
Perhaps it may be said farther that the Jews are not 
spiritual enough&#44; their whole religion is too sensual&#44; 
too much given to externals. But again there is a 
misconception of the case. Let us examine&#44; as I have 
said already&#44; the life of a pious Israelite&#44; and he will 
be found truthful&#44; obedient&#44; charitable&#44; resigned un&#8211; 
der suflering&#44; laborious in his daily avocations&#44; cheer&#8211; 
ful in every state of life&#44; and meeting death with the 
calmness becoming a man&#44; the child of God&#44; who sees 
his end approaching. I could increase easily the ena&#8211; 
meration of the spiritual qualities of a good Jew&#59;

but there is no need of pronouncing a eulogy upon 
our own people however well deserved it might be&#59; 
we may appeal to history to prove how we bore with 
patience&#44; meekness and resignation whatever ills the 
world without was pleased to inflict upon us for the 
profession of our faith &#59; and say what gave us this 
moral courage&#44; what streugthened our spirit so that 
we could bear the heavy yoke which was laid on us&#44; 
but that very religion which you say is not spiritual 
enough &#63; And this was in times when the observ&#8211; 
ances were more minutely regarded than they now 
are in many places&#59; and still when did the world be&#8211; 
hold more devotion&#44; more self&#8211;sacrifice&#44; a purer faith&#44; 
and a more unshrinking trust in the God of all the 
world &#63; And shall we&#44; the descendants and succes&#8211; 
sors of so many holy martyrs&#44; now turn the murder&#8211; 
ous knife against the bosom of our venerable mother&#44; 
the religion which caused our existence&#44; to undervalue 
what she teaches&#44; to slay the spirit which she has 
breathed into us&#63; Such a procedure would rejoice 
the heart of those who have striven so many centuries 
to blot out our name from the records of nations &#59; 
thus we would prepare to throw ourselves into the 
arms of those whose embrace would bring death to 
Judaism &#59; for it is only by its preserving its pecu&#8211; 
liar national features&#44; by hedging round its followers 
with restrictions&#44; that it can maintain its position 
amidst the struggle for empire among the contending 
opinions which now agitate the sons of man. Yield 
up the veneration for our ceremonial observances&#44; and 
what would distinguish the Jew from another man &#63;

alone&#44; if we have not outward conduct to mark us as 
belonging to the same class of believers&#44; to those who 
have the same past&#44; who hope to enjoy the same 
future. 

Lastly&#44; as regards the little importance which acts 
of humanity are alleged to possess among us&#44; it is 
needless to advance any refutation after what has been 
said already. The Israelites are moreover proverbi&#8211; 
ally kind to the poor&#44; and their hands are seldom red 
with the blood of a brother&#59; robberies and high&#8211; 
handed crimes against individuals&#44; or the state&#44; are 
of rare occurrence among them &#59; and seldom docs the 
cry of distress from even those who have habitually 
oppressed them appeal to them for relief in vain. Our 
outward religion&#44; in brief&#44; does not stifle in the slight&#8211; 
est the aspirations after the highest perfection&#59; and a 
system so constituted lacks nothing of being consid&#8211; 
ered a worthy emanation of the highest Wisdom. 
But as regards the multitude of our duties we ought 
to rejoice in their possession&#44; that we have thus re&#8211; 
ceived the means of rendering ourselves deserving of 
the mercy which is promised to us as a reward for 
obedience. Let us reflect well&#44; that when enjoining 
kindness to the poor&#44; it is commanded to us &#58; &#34; Thou 
shalt not take from him interest 04&#8211; increase&#44; and thou 
shalt be afraid of thy God&#44; and let thy brother live 
with thee &#59;&#34; and respecting ceremonial duties we are 
warned &#40;Lev. xxvi. 2&#41;. 


&#34; My sabbaths shall ye observe&#44; and my sanctuary shall ye rev&#8211; 
erence &#59; I am the Lord.&#34;

72 THE SPIRITUALITY OF JUDAISM. 

This must teach ns that not he fears the Lord who 
forgets to have compassion on his poor brother&#44; and 
brother means any one who Uke him bears the im&#8211; 
press of the human face divine&#59; not he can claim 
to have fulfilled his duties who hears unmoved the 
groans of suffering without hastening to its relief&#59; 
nor is he a true son of Israel who imascines that he can 
bribe his way to heaven&#44; who fancies that by scatter&#8211; 
ing charity&#44; by bestowing what he does not need 
himself&#44; by spending some time which hangs heavily 
on his hand in deeds of benevolence&#44; he has accom&#8211; 
plished the whole task of justification. No &#33; brethren &#33; 
we must labour assiduously as men and as Israelites&#44; 
to obey the will of our Father&#59; He bids us to be 
holy&#59; He bids us to remember the poor&#59; He bids us 
to observe his Sabbaths&#44; the days which He declared 
holy&#59; and with all his precepts He enforces our obe&#8211; 
dience by declaring that He is the Lord&#44; everliving&#44; 
omnipresent to reward and to punish. Let us heed 
then these behests&#44; these calls for immortality &#59; and 
as sure as our Father lives&#44; so sure will be our recom&#8211; 
pense &#59; and when our days draw to a close&#44; we shall 
be like the setting&#8211;sun&#44; throwing a more beautiful 
radiance though the whole day has been bright&#44; as it 
hastens to its close &#59; and then the righteousness which 
we have acquired will go before us&#44; and the glory of 
God will receive our spirit in favour&#44; and treasure it 
up in the bond of life. Amen.

DISCOURSE VI. 

THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH. 

From Paran thy glory dawned upon our fathers&#44; 
and from Seir&#39;s mountain thy brightness burst over 
them&#44; on that blessed day&#44; when Thou earnest&#44; O God &#33; 
to teach thy people truth and knowledge &#59; and creation 
stood mute&#44; the earth shook&#44; the mountains were 
moved to their centres&#44; wdiilst thy own omnipotent 
Voice broke over the wide expanse of mount and 
plain&#44; and penetrated into hearts unused to knowl&#8211; 
edge&#44; and it took up its abode in the deepest recesses 
of the souls of thy heritage to dwell therein forever. 
O how glorious is the gift thus bestowed &#33; how per&#8211; 
fect the wisdom thus infused &#33; and though generation 
upon generation has been borne to the grave&#44; though 
countless hosts have sunk before the destroj&#8211;erof life&#58; 
thy law stands unshaken&#44; and its precepts ai&#34;e revered 
by the many who look up to Thee for aid&#44; who wait 
alone upon thy salvation. And we thank Thee&#44; 
Father of Israel&#33; that Thou hast been thus mindful 
of us&#44; and that according to thy promise thy goodness 
has not forsaken us in our afHiction. Be it now thy 
will&#44; to continue to us to the end of days thy protec&#8211; 
tion&#44; and to shield us against the assaults of the un&#8211; 
godly&#44; and the machinations of those who love not the 
nation whom Thou chosest as thy people&#59; and bear 
us safely as the father bears away his child from

Brethren &#33; 

ISTo doubt that&#44; in your occasional readings of the 
Scriptures&#44; you have met with single verses or even 
solitary expressions which appeared to you as contain&#8211; 
ing an epitome of volumes of learning&#44; and as open&#8211; 
ing up to you a wider field for contemplation and 
thought&#44; than entire elaborate treatises&#44; where the 
careful writers have striven to heap idea upon idea&#44; 
and to convey by close and intense application the 
treasures of information which they have so labor&#8211; 
iously gathered up in years of toil and research&#59; and 
at a glimpse the truth you were seeking for was 
revealed to you in all her beauty and unadorned 
splendour&#59; and when you had seen such a passage&#44; 
you must have felt that in reality you had learned all 
that could reasonably be obtained&#44; and that farther 
search was useless&#44; and labour exerted in vain. You 
have felt like the traveller who is journeying to the 
far&#8211;famed palace of a mighty sovereign through long 
deserts&#44; difficult mountain defiles&#44; and impenetrable 
forests&#44; when suddenly and unexpectedly to himself 
the royal residence bursts upon his enraptured view 
through a vista wdiich opens to him the goal towards 
which he has been toiling&#59; and though he be alone&#44; 
with no one near to confirm his impressions&#44; he feels 
the utmost conviction and the most positive assurance 
that no other than his revered sovereign could have

erected such a structure as the place of his habitation. 
Even so are the Scriptures in the sudden liglit which 
they throw upon matters in which the unaided mind 
has been toiHng perhaps for years without success&#44; 
without a single ray to illuminate the darkness in 
which all human reasoning&#44; relying upon itself alone&#44; 
must ever tind itself involved during its search for 
truth. And should you have once felt the force of 
divine illumination&#44; although unexpectedly brought 
home to your soul&#58; it is utterly impossible that you 
can ever after lose totally sight thereof&#59; but the con&#8211; 
viction thus produced will be present to you&#44; and give 
strength to your resolves and firmness to your hopes&#44; 
which naught on earth can shake&#44; provided only you 
choose to let the belief take root in your spirit&#44; that 
it was indeed the teaching of God which instructed 
you&#44; and you seek not for the vain&#8211;glorious distinc&#8211; 
tion of having by your own fallible knowledge evolved 
the principles which you now feel to be based on truth. 
One of those peculiarly animating verses of which 
I have been speaking occurs in the fourth chapter of 
Deuteronomy&#44; and is in the following words &#58; 

&#34;Know therefore this day&#44; and reflect in thy heart&#44; that the 
Eternal is the God in the heavens above&#44; and upon the earth be&#8211; 
neath&#58; there is none else.&#34; &#40;Verse 39.&#41; 

Ay &#33; there is none else&#33; IIow does this single ex&#8211;

change has come&#59; nay even turn your gaze of hiquiry 
upon the insect world&#44; all curiously and wonderfully 
shaped in the endless variety in which they exist&#44; 
whether it he the worm that crawls in the dust&#44; or 
the gay butterfly which enlivens the landscape in the 
season of summer&#59; look at all parts of the entire 
world&#44; &#8212; and then you will still discover and feel the 
force of the truth of the Scripture&#44; that the Eternal 
is the true God&#44; the Creator who made all&#44; and that 
there is no one who aided Ilim in elaborating the 
vast structure of which you are but a minute part&#44; 
and that there is no god who shares with Ilim the 
rule in any part of Creation&#44; be this over the matter 
which is visible to the eye and perceptible to the 
senses&#44; or over the spirit&#44; the invisible power by 
which the inert masses of matter are set in motion. 
&#8212; In nothing whatever can the other power&#44; granted 
there be any&#44; be discovered &#59; whithersoever we jour&#8211; 
ney&#44; wheresoever we are&#44; in whatever age we live&#44; in 
whatever concern we busy ourselves&#44; we meet with 
evidences of one vast system of design&#44; of a uniformity 
of will&#44; of a oneness of purpose&#44; without an opposing 
force to retard&#44; without an assistant to aid our God. 
And lest we might be misled by the discrepancies 
which daily occurrences present&#44; through the insuf&#8211; 
ficiency of our knowledge and experience&#44; which&#44; 
therefore&#44; do not enable us to judge with certainty 
of every thing&#44; to suppose that the different results 
which we witness are the productions of different and 
independent powers &#58; the Bible comes to our aid&#44; and 
tells us that we need not alarm ourselves because all 
the effects of actions around us are not such as we 
might perchance desire&#59; there is&#44; despite of the regret

we experience at results unpleasant to ns&#44; but one 
Cause from whom they all spring&#44; that all is based 
on goodness&#44; and all is led by mercy&#44; and the whole 
of what strikes us either in our experience or that 
of others will to a surety tend at length to the happi&#8211; 
ness of all&#44; though we ourselves cannot at present 
trace the connexions which will lead to such an ulti&#8211; 
mate result. 

It is possible enough&#44; as indeed it occurred in ages 
before this&#44; that men might be induced to adopt the 
idea&#44; that the source of good and evil is diverse&#44; or 
in other words&#44; that the results which we witness have 
ditfcrent causes for their origin&#59; and because men 
once commenced to look upon a diversity of results 
as proceeding from a diversity of principles&#44; they 
came at length to the adoption of the absurd idea 
of investing every manifestation around them with 
an independency of being&#44; and of ascribing divine 
honours to whatever they loved or feared&#44; and to 
look with veneration upon every thing the origin of 
which they did not comprehend with sufficient accu&#8211; 
racy And having once commenced thus to multiply 
the objects of worship&#44; it must have been impossible 
to limit their number within a reasonable compass&#59; 
and tliough the first believers in a plurality in the 
Deity might have confined the ideas of worship to 
two&#44; the origins of good and evil &#59; or to three&#44; the 
creative&#44; sustaining&#44; and destructive principles&#59; or to 
the power over the sky&#44; that over the earth&#44; and the 
one over the sea&#44; &#8212; or at length into whatever original 
form polytheism at first presented itself as the most 
reasonable to its first adherents&#58; it must have soon 
been perceived that&#44; whatever dogma was first adopted&#44;

it foiled to explain all the phenomena of outward na&#8211; 
ture which are perceptible to mankind&#59; and hence a 
constant addition to the number of divinities became 
the prevailing folly&#44; until a heathen could admit into 
his catalogue of worshipful beings the most contra&#8211; 
dictory&#44; and those whose origin was the most diverse 
and uncono&#8211;enial. It mattered not to him who invented 
a certain god and proclaimed his worship &#59; it was noth&#8211; 
ing singular to him that rites the most barbarous and 
monstrous were demanded to appease the wrath of 
his own or others&#39; absurdities&#58; his Olympus was capa&#8211; 
cious enough to atibrd a suitable dwelling for all of 
them&#44; and every new addition of inhabitants to the 
abode of the celestials only demanded of him the erec&#8211; 
tion of a new temple at a place declared sacred to the 
respective deity&#44; with perhaps an order of priests&#44; 
sacrifices&#44; and rites&#44; in consonance with the peculiar 
influence which was ascribed to the same by the 
brutalized worshippers. And this was not the cur&#8211; 
rent belief of the ignorant only &#59; but the wisest among 
the ancient nations readily acquiesced in all these 
absurdities&#59; and the magnificent temples and statues&#44; 
which have come down to our own age&#44; only too well 
attest what wealth&#44; and skill&#44; and ingenuity were ex&#8211; 
hausted to adorn and dignify the follies which dis&#8211; 
figured the face of the earth in those days&#44; and they 
will ever continue to excite our wonder at the depth 
of debasement into which human reason could sink&#44; 
when once it departed from the path of truth. Still 
when we duly reflect upon the downward tendency of 
all departures from the proper standard&#44; at the im&#8211; 
possibility of fixing a stopping&#8211;point&#44; when once we 
are afloat on the ocean of conjecture and uncertainty &#58;

we will cease to wonder at the greatness of the aber&#8211; 
ration of paganism&#44; and return sincere thanks to the 
Creator&#44; that He in mercy condescended to teach us 
himself something of his being&#44; and to bring us near 
unto his service. 

The miraculous descent on Sinai after our firoins&#58; 
forth from Egypt&#44; on the day the recurrence of whi9h 
we now celebrate&#44; has often been dwelt upon &#59; and in 
our imagination we yet can hear the thunders which 
shook the sacred mountain and made the people trem&#8211; 
ble&#59; we yet behold the brilliant flames of fire which 
blazed upward to the heart of heaven &#59; we can picture 
to us the millions who stood at the base of the chosen 
Horeb&#44; eager to hear the voice of their King. It will 
therefore be well to question ourselves&#44; &#34;Why all this 
was done &#63; what matters it whether we believe in and 
follow one system or the other &#63; is not the morality 
of the gentiles the same as that of the Jews &#63; is not 
their idea of justice equal to our own &#63; But we for&#8211; 
get&#44; if thus we argue&#44; the origin of the morality and 
justice of the gentiles&#44; and after all we exaggerate 
their value and extent&#44; in our haste to undervalue our 
own. But first&#44; as regards heathen ideas of right and 
wrong&#44; we would be unwise to measure them by the 
standard which prevails at this day&#59; if you examine 
history you will find how many things deemed now 
criminal and unlawful&#44; in any code of laws now prev&#8211; 
alent&#44; were considered harmless and lawful &#59; and sys&#8211; 
tems which deified the evil&#44; sacrificed to war&#44; terror&#44; 
and bloodshed&#59; assigned divine honours to theft and 
the basest passions&#59; which permitted temples to be

were the legitimate results of the most refined sys&#8211;

what sort of morality&#44; what sense of justice could pre&#8211; 
vail to any&#94;great extent&#59; must not every sensuality&#44; 
even the grossest&#44; every violence&#44; even the most cruel&#44; 
have found more than a justification in the conduct 
and examples of their gods&#63; And what debasement 
must have rested upon the minds of the unenlightened 
masses&#44; when those in authority&#44; and the teachers of 
the people excused crimes by such appeals &#63; It is not 
uecessary for us to go into an extensive and detailed 
examination of the question at issue &#59; since the small&#8211; 
est practical acquaintance with history will more than 
bear out our inference. We therefore say&#44; with the 
utmost sense of our dependence on Providence for all 
our blessings&#44; and for none more than the gift of re&#8211; 
ligion&#44; &#34; Blessed be the Lord God of Israel for his 
mercy&#44; in having had respect to our humble state&#44; 
and sent us redemption from the chains of tyranny 
and the trammels of unbelief&#34; Yes&#44; it was the man&#8211; 
ifestation of his mighty power by which we were 
released from thraldom &#59; and it was likewise by the 
display of his omnipotence and wisdom that our syirit 
was freed from the bonds of superstition&#44; and we re&#8211; 
ceived a law which teaches us to know what God is&#44; 
and how we are to act in consonance with this high 
knowledge. It was the teaching of divine wisdom 
alone which tore from before our eyes the impene&#8211; 
trable veil of unbelief and falsehood&#44; of that gross 
blindness which would not permit the wondrous

perversion of truth and justice as the principles upon 
which to base our course of life. But it required all 
the training in Egypt and the desert which we re&#8211; 
ceived to make the divine truths acceptable unto us&#44; 
to eradicate from our very being the pernicious errors 
which we had imbibed in our early infancy &#59; and 
only after a pilgrimage of forty years through a land 
which has neither field&#8211;labour nor vintage&#44; the resi&#8211; 
dence of horrid monsters and poisonous serpents &#8212; a 
land where we obtained bread and water only through 
the special intervention of Providence&#44; the great 
prophet could address us in the w ords of our text &#58;

dures for everlasting&#44; who is not only eternal but is 
also one and alone&#44; who is powerful to save&#44; who 
blesses and no one can recall the word&#44; who smites 
and no one can stay his outstretched arm. Observe 
well&#44; that the prophet in the passage under discussion 
refers to the love which God bore to our fathers&#44; 
wherefore and in order to observe the covenant which 
He had made with them. He had compassion on us 
when we were in affliction&#44; and brought us unto his 
service by causing us to see his great fire on earth&#44; 
and letting us hear his mighty voice in the announce&#8211; 
ment of his precepts. And in all this display of good&#8211; 
ness and power there was no associate&#44; no inter&#8211; 
mediate agent to eftect the ends proposed&#59; since 
Moses himself was merely the instrument for the 
conveyance of the deeds&#44; and as respects the promul&#8211; 
gation of the Decalogue not even he was deputed&#59; 
for all the people themselves heard the words&#44; there 
was a voice audible to all&#44; but no similitude or form teas 
perceived by more than six hundred thousand men of 
Israel who surrounded the Mount Sinai&#44; besides their 
wives and children and the multitude of strangers 
among them. Indeed&#44; from the call of Abraham to 
be a servant of God&#44; down to the very moment at 
which Moses was delivering that sublime speech to 
the people&#44; just before his death&#44; there had not been 
felt&#44; seen&#44; or known any mediatorial personage who 
did or could aid the great Supreme in the execution 
of his will&#44; or could thwart Ilim in his intention&#44; or 
turn away his decrees of justice by any act of his own 
from tbe exposed head of guilty mortals.

ISTow the display of the glory of God on the great 
day of the first Pentecost&#44; was not for the sake of 
merely astonishing the dwellers of the earth at the 
profusion of strength and power which are the 
Lord&#39;s &#59; hut to impress on tlie minds of the people 
of Israel that they were accountahle only to the One 
Creator&#44; who alone is God&#44; and who therefore alone 
had the legitimate power and right to prescribe to 
them the deeds which they should accomplish&#44; and 
the way in which they should go. In short&#44; the Eter&#8211; 
nal One came to instruct&#44; and while doing so. He 
naturally had to impress the minds of his el&#94;ct with 
a conviction so strong&#44; that they should be able to 
withstand all the powers of persuasion of worldliness 
and of fear in their intercourse with others not so 
instructed&#44; and to remain faithful to the laws which 
they had received&#44; though all others should continue 
to follow the base inclinations of sinful passions and 
the emanations of folly and unbelief. But as the Lord 
is not alone the God of Israel&#44; since lie is the Father 
of all mankind&#44; He did not limit the exercise of mercy 
and justice to the Hebrews alone&#44; but bade them to 
love the stranger&#44; and to follow Ilim in his ways of 
providence wherewith He takes care of the helpless 
and dependent creatures&#44; and provides them with 
their daily bread&#44; and with raiment to protect them 
against the inclemency of the seasons. In addition 
to this He promised us as the greatest blessing&#44; not 
triumph over our enemies&#44; but a state of peace&#44; in 
case we should truly observe his commandments&#59; so 
that even victory and success in arms were not so 
great an evidence of his favour as that state of na&#8211;

industrial engagements without fearing an enemy&#44; 
or thinking to put on his armour to go beyond the 
borders of his land to molest others in their posses&#8211; 
sions. So then the revelation of Sinai was and is 
virtually a religion of peace and good&#8211;will towards all 
men&#44; and a system of justice and charity towards 
every one&#44; based upon the acknowledged sovereignty 
of the Great God who alone created&#44; who solely gov&#8211; 
erns the world&#44; and loves all He has made. 

In this manner is it clearly proved&#44; that in every 
point of view it is of the utmost moment that we ad&#8211; 
here to the Mosaic law&#44; in contradistinction to the 
heathenish rites and beliefs of whatever sort&#44; either 
those of ancient or modern times. And as respects 
the views of the followers of the Koran or the Gospels&#44; 
whose morality approaches our own&#44; we can dismiss 
them with one single remark &#58; no new revelation was 
ever vouchsafed to these since God spoke to our 
fathers in the desert of Iloreb&#44; and they have there&#8211; 
fore received no new light with regard to what the 
Lord requires of his creatures. And as respects a 
superior holiness inherent in any of them above what 
is with Israel&#44; we have yet to learn that the idea of a 
mediatorial interference&#44; in the one&#44; and of a sensual 
felicity after death in the other&#44; have rendered their 
followers more observant of justice towards each 
other&#44; or ever sheathed the sword of persecution or 
the love of conquest towards others. More than 
eighteen hundred years ago it is alleged that a reign 
of peace has commenced on earth &#59; we are told the 
lamb lies down witli the wolf&#44; and a young child can 
play upon the den of the cocatrice &#59; but if we look

and war&#44; and injustice as yet holding rule on earth &#59; 
and so far from its being true that the belief in a me&#8211; 
diator tranquillizes the spirit and purifies the heart&#58; 
the most monstrous absurdities and contradictory 
systems are constantly invented and propagated in 
the name of the same imaginary being. I am not 
saying this as an invective against non&#8211;Israelites&#44; but 
to show in a few words&#44; true in every particular&#44; why 
we cannot become followers of the Mahomedan and 
Nazarene beliefs &#59; why we stand to this day on the 
same platform on which we were placed more than 
three thousand years ago by the One who formed our 
body out of the dust of the earth&#44; and breathed into 
our nostrils the breath of life. He also breathed into 
us&#44; on the day we now celebrate&#44; a new spirit&#44; even 
the law which He delivered into our charge&#59; He in&#8211; 
corporated it with our being&#44; with our separate exist&#8211; 
ence as a peculiar people&#44; the descendants from a 
common origin &#59; He placed us in the vanguard of 
those who profess to believe in his salvation &#58; and 
should we turn traitors at this late day &#63; forget his 
mercy&#63; forget his truth&#63; reject Him as our Sover&#8211;

bid it justice &#33; forbid it gratitude &#33; We are bound by a 
thousand ties of mercy to our great Father. He has 
said unto us&#44; &#34; And I severed you from the peoples to 
be mine&#59;&#34; and though we sin&#44; though many of us 
may prove false on the day of trial &#58; his word will 
not fail of its ultimate effect&#44; and we shall be pre&#8211;

Brethren &#33; 

The history of our people is full of instruction&#44; and 
serves as a guide to point out the proper path on which 
we should go&#44; and the deeds which we should avoid 
whenever they present themselves to us in the course 
of our earthly pilgrimage. &#34; But&#44;&#34; I hear some one 
say&#44; &#34; the same is the case with all other narratives 
of national events&#59; for history is philosophy teaching 
hy example.&#34; This certainly is true enough as re&#8211; 
gards political features&#44; and violent changes in morals 
and government&#59; for such as these strike the atten&#8211; 
tion of the chroniclers&#44; and they record them with all 
the details which can embellish them&#44; and in a style 
the best calculated to interest the reader. But the 
silent working of principles&#44; the mental struggle of 
the actors in the scenes sketched for us&#44; are unknown 
to the general historian &#59; and hence the most impor&#8211; 
tant events which we find recorded burst upon us in 
all the startling effect of suddenness&#59; for we are not 
prepared&#44; at least in most instances&#44; to comprehend 
how they came upon the stage of life in the manner 

<pb n="89"/>

tliey did. Though&#44; therefore&#44; we are presented with 
the fearful tragedies with which history is filled&#44; and 
with the revolutions&#44; the horrors of which are enough 
to make man blush for his species &#58; they are not pos&#8211; 
sessed of the character of examples to affect the life 
of the individual&#59; they are truly national&#44; and are 
only thus calculated to teach communities as such&#44; 
not to ijovern the individual life of those who com&#8211; 
pose them. But the history of the Israelitish people&#44; 
being traced by those who had a knowledge of the 
Avorkings of the human heart&#44; and wrote down the 
events which they record not to gratify curiosity&#44; but 
to inform men of their moral obligations&#44; presents us 
with the connexion of the thought with the deed 
which it prompted&#44; and exhibits to us clearly how the 
wrong which is perpetrated by mankind&#44; either in 
masses or singly&#44; springs from a previous corruption 
of the healthy sentiment&#44; which it is the province of 
religion to inculcate. So then it is in vain that you 
measure the importance of Jewish history with nar&#8211; 
ratives of other nations&#44; either ancient or modern &#59; 
you need not look for a detailed account of mighty 
revolutions or the shocks of contending hosts&#59; no 
doubt these did occur frequently in the course of our 
national existence&#59; but they are not a necessary in&#8211; 
gredient in the im&#94;&#94; &#8211;ovement of the spirit&#59; and hence 
they are merely sketched&#44; where their introduction 
was necessary&#44; in the simplest and fewest words&#44; merely 
to snatch them from oblivion &#59; but beyond this they 
are neither dwelt upon nor exhibited in the vividness 
of profuse description&#44; which profane historians are 
so sedulous to bestow on scenes of carnage and bloody 
encounters. The Jews had unquestionably their his&#8211;

torians and chroniclers&#44; who noted down whatever of 
the striking or great their ohserv&#94;ation had taught or 
study had discovered &#59; several such are indeed alluded 
to in Scripture. But the Bible itself must not be 
viewed merely in the light of a book of biographical 
story&#44; of scientific discovery&#44; and brave deeds in arms&#44; 
although you discover traces of all this interwoven in 
its pages &#59; on the coaitrary&#44; it is professedly an exposi&#8211; 
tion of duties&#44; and the consequences resulting from 
their observance or neglect&#59; and it presents us&#44; on 
the one side&#44; the perfect and happy man who fears 
the Lord&#44; and the people who are mindful in their 
national afiairs of tlieir allegiance to Heaven &#58; and on 
the other hand&#44; we see individuals and nations going 
to their downfall&#44; simply because they would not re&#8211; 
ceive instruction&#44; and not because they lackecl wis&#8211; 
dom&#44; learning&#44; bravery&#44; and enterprise. I&#94;ay&#44; the 
very reverse will be found the case. The shepherd 
Abraham&#44; whose wisdom is not recorded in many a 
book of elegant verse and sublime prose&#44; became the 
father of a great people&#44; though he was a wanderer&#44; 
as his descendants were to be&#44; in a land not his by 
birth or inheritance&#58; while the wise Solomon&#44; whose 
beautiful thoughts and deep reflections were the theme 
of admiration of his age&#44; and are a mine of knowledge 
at this very hour&#44; in whose reign civilization and re&#8211; 
finement obtained the highest elevation in Palestine&#44; 
which then was more extensive in its boundaries than 
ever before or since&#44; in whose days there was a uni&#8211; 
versal peace throughout his dominions&#44; could not suc&#8211; 
ceed in securing the undisturbed possession of the 
government to Ijis son&#44; nor to stifle during his own 
reign the discoiUent existing in the minds of the

people by his administration. And when you come 
to examine why this was so&#63; you will find the answer 
in tlie recorded characters of these two eminent men&#44; 
sketched by a pen that wished not to flatter human 
weakness nor to accord a merit which was not de&#8211; 
served. In brief&#44; Abraham was and remained the 
simple traveller from Chaldea amidst all his exalta&#8211; 
tion&#44; and Solomon forgot the ways of David&#44; his father&#44; 
and permitted a foreign influence to corrupt his better 
judgment&#44; and thus to destroy the foundation of his 
peaceful dominions. 

Apply the same analysis to any and every portion 
of the biblical history&#44; and you will discover the same 
object and course of the narrative&#59; it is not to teach 
philosophy merely by example&#44; but to inculcate the 
great lesson on which our religion is founded&#44; &#34;that 
only in a pious execution of all the prescribed duties 
which are within our reach&#44; superinduced by the 
latent feeling of deep&#8211;seated faith and confidence in 
the teaching of God&#44; can we attain to that point of 
excellence which is accessible to us&#44; and the con&#8211; 
sequent real success in what is best for our permanent 
welfare.&#34; Anything short of this would be failing in 
the object of our creation &#59; for we were made in the 
intelligent image of God&#44; in the similitude of his 
divine spirit of wisdom &#59; and therefore we can only 
then claim to be in a faint degree like our Father in 
heaven&#44; when we have reached that point of perfection 
in intelligence and knowledge of God&#44; which to at&#8211; 
tain is our appointed duty on earth. It is for this end 
that we have received the power of distinguishing 
between good and evil&#44; that we have been blessed 
with a free choice&#44; that we can regulate ourselves as

WO please in a moral point of view&#59; and that&#44; finally&#44; 
we shall be happy or otherwise&#44; only in the measure 
that we have ourselves chosen wisely or unwisely&#59; 
and that no outward aid can avail us in this enter&#8211; 
prise for which we were created&#44; if we neglect the 
inherent powers of the mind which have been be&#8211; 
stowed on us as a special gift from the Creator. The 
history of Israel is therefore a mirror in which we all 
can see our own likeness foreshadowed&#44; the odious Na&#8211; 
tures of our base desires&#44; and their baleful consequences 
clearly portrayed &#59; and this has been done&#44; not to 
amuse us by curious developments of the history of 
the mind&#44; but to enable us to call to our aid all the 
appliances for wisdom and self&#8211;government which 
have been bestowed on us in the divine law promul&#8211; 
gated through the greatest of prophets&#44; the meekest 
of men&#44; who&#44; basking in the light of divine effulgence&#44; 
maintained a childlike simplicity&#44; being always one 
of the people&#44; rejoicing in his greatness only as it 
enabled him to lead wisely and faithfully the flock of 
the Lord intrusted to his charge from the time that 
he was destined to be their leader. 

These preliminary reflections will perhaps account 
for the very remarkable fact that&#44; in all the wander&#8211; 
ings of the Israelites through the wilderness&#44; we are 
oidy presented with a continued series of transgres&#8211; 
sions and punishments consequent thereon&#44; and that 
at length we And the great leader himself ensnared 
ill the decreed exclusion from the holy land&#44; to see 
wliich he so ardently desired&#44; but which wish was not 
accorded to him&#44; because he had not duly sanctifled 
the name of the Lord on the memorable occasion 
when the people thirsted for water in the arid plains

of the wilderness of Kadesh. Let no one imagine 
that during the forty years which the connexion of 
Moses with the sons of Israel lasted&#44; there occurred 
so few opportunities for self&#8211;praise&#44; or that there were 
no other than the few recorded instances when faith&#44; 
charity&#44; and liberality were displayed on the part of 
the people and their chiefs&#59; all we can assume is&#44; 
that only by tracing&#44; as Moses did&#44; the various ex&#8211; 
hibitions of the stubborn rebellion of the nation just 
released from slavery&#44; and the visitations which suc&#8211; 
ceeded so punctually on their various backslidings&#44; 
could he impress in the strongest manner on their 
successors the absolute necessity of surrendering them&#8211; 
selves entirely to the guidance of God&#44; though this 
should apparently lead them through the most appal&#8211; 
ling dangers&#44; secure in the conviction that the wisdom 
of the Lord will ask nothing of man which is beyond 
his power of accomplishing. 

The Bible therefore is intended to teach us the great 
principle of faith&#44; not that sort which demands a 
belief in certain incomprehensible dogmas for which 
credence is claimed as the price of salvation&#44; but that 
perfect abandonment of our whole being to God&#39;s 
care&#44; in the conviction that He desires our welfare 
only&#44; and that his laws&#44; when followed up closely and 
truly&#44; will have the result of securing our best hap&#8211; 
piness both here and herea&#94; But some one may 
ask me here&#58; &#34;Is this so greau a thing&#63; does not 
God give us whatever we possess &#63; does He not be&#8211; 
stow on us the very power of enjoying&#63; are we not 
altogether his subjects over whom He can dispose at

are constantly bidden to rise and to eat&#44; equally with 
the renowned prophet Elijah&#44; when he fled into the 
wilderness from fear of the threatened vengeance of 
the wicked Isebel&#44; But for all this faith is not of 
that easy growth which some may imagine. Perhaps

on the cheek&#44; and the world around smiles an ap&#8211; 
proval on what we undertake&#44; many a one may feel 
the sentiment that he has cause for thankfulness to 
his Maker who has so bountifully bestowed his good&#8211; 
ness upon him&#44; granted even that his pride does not 
substitute his own powers as the cause of his happi&#8211; 
ness. But where will be his faith when fortune van&#8211; 
ishes &#63; when health fades &#63; when youth is fled &#63; when 
the undeserved censure of the world pursues him 
with remorseless rancour &#63; will he then see the bless&#8211; 
ing which others enjoy without envy&#44; and their ag&#8211; 
grandizement without repining &#63; And yet God is the 
same in all instances&#59; for when prosperity&#8211; is his&#44;

others are just as much empowered to indulge in this 
sinful feeling when he is prosperous. The faith of

site of a religious life&#44; precisely that peculiar quality 
of the mind which is the fitting problem of the great&#8211; 
est prophet to solve&#44; although it is equally demanded 
of the humblest follower of the Lord. It must ac&#8211; 
cordingly be impressed in early childhood that it is 
the same Goodness which directs the stars&#44; and 
causes the grass to grow from the field&#44; which sup&#8211; 
plies the power to the planets to pursue their pre&#8211; 
scribed course&#44; and produces the seed for the seed&#8211; 
man&#44; and food for him who needs food. When we 
grow up and begin to appreciate the diversities of 
position&#44; of wealth&#44; and mental endowments among 
mankind &#58; we ought to be taught that it is not the 
precise amount which each one receives which con&#8211; 
stitutes his happiness&#44; but that it is to be found in 
the correct appropriation of the gifts of Heaven. 
&#34;When we have attained to mature years&#44; and we find 
ourselves jostled by the eager crowd who with us 
hasten forward in the race for preferment and great&#8211;

we think less deserving than we are &#58; we ought to 
tell ourselves sincerely that v&#44; &#8211;&#94; failure&#44; even when

in the Lord&#44; that we have believed in Him as Abra&#8211;

promises of a numerous progeny&#44; though already 
more than eighty times had he seen the seasons re&#8211;

was ready and willing&#44; but &#33; with what depth of 
grief filling his soul&#44; to sacrifice the very child of

is not safe against the attacks of temptation&#44; let this 
conic in the accumulating tide of prosperity&#44; or the 
downward flow of distress and sorrow&#59; in the one 
case you would perhaps forget the Power that has 
blessed your labour&#44; and in the other you would needs 
murmur against the all&#8211;just Judge who metes out to 
you the recompense of your misdeeds. 

Now&#44; it was precisely this want of faith&#44; the doubt&#8211; 
ing of Providence&#44; which characterized our ancestors 
during their sojourn in the wilderness&#44; especially in 
the first years after their departure from Egypt. &#8212; 
Wliilst yet in bondage they had been promised the 
possession of the goodly land on both sides of the 
Jordan&#44; the same which God had given to their 
fathers&#44; with the assurance that it should be possessed 
by their descendants after their deliverance from the 
Land of their servitude. Four hundred years from 
the commencement of Abraham&#39;s wanderings had 
been accomplished&#44; when the promise made to him 
was so far fulfilled that the shackles of Egypt&#39;s bond&#8211; 
age were removed from their limbs&#44; and they had 
stood redeemed and untrammelled at the foot of 
Horeb&#44; and had of a free accord accepted the Revela&#8211; 
tion of God&#44; and entered without compulsion into an 
everlasting covenant with the Author of the universe. 
More than their imagination had ever conceived&#44; they 
had experienced&#59; what no human eye had ever before 
seen&#44; they had witnessed&#59; what no ear had ever lis&#8211; 
tened to they had themselves heard&#59; but we will not 
enumerate all the miracles&#44; for they are only&#94; subordi&#8211; 
nate to the great truth they had received&#44; that their 
God was all&#8211;powerful&#44; superior in wisdom&#44; unequalled 
in deed&#44; and ready to hear the petition of the needy.

Why then would they not coufide&#63; why did they not 
believe that he meant to act a father&#39;s part with 
them &#63; But again and again they rebelled&#44; and when 
they accordingly arrived at the confines of the land 
whither they were journeying&#44; they hesitated to enter&#44; 
before they had made a proper reconnoissanco of its 
position&#44; the strength of its cities&#44; the fruitfulness of 
its fields&#44; and the military prowess of its inhabitants. 
But as the Lord always employs human agency&#44; al&#8211; 
though ever so inadecpiate&#44; to effect his purposes&#44; He 
did not forbid the sending forth of the twelve spies 
to search out the land. Bat however unfavourable 
the report should have been&#44; it was the duty of the 
people to go forward under the direction of their well&#8211; 
tried leader&#44; in the fall conviction of finding the land 
suitable for their dwelling&#44; and of ample success in 
capturing it&#59; inasmuch as the Lord had promised 
them a victory over their opponents&#44; and they had 
had already such ample testimony both of his power 
to accomplish his will&#44; and of His truth to fulfil all 
that he promises. But no &#33; the messengers spoke of 
the great danger to be encountered by the unhealthi&#8211; 
ness of the climate of Palestine&#44; the powerfal state 
of its natural and artificial defences&#44; and the extreme 
stature of its inhabitants. Its fruitfulness they did 
not deny&#59; but the very gigantic size of tlie fruit 
which they bore along with them to the camp gave 
some well&#8211;founded colouring to their artful calumny&#44; 
regarding the gigantic stature of the warlike inhabi&#8211; 
tants so like the vegetable productions of the land&#44; 
but calumny only in their exaggerating the existing 
dangers&#44; and not heeding what Joshua and Caleb so 
well enforced&#58; &#34; Whilst the Lord is with us&#44; you

need not fear them.&#34; How ungrateful&#44; how thor&#8211; 
oughly imbued with a slavish spirit did the Israelites 
prove themselves to be at that time&#59; the blows of 
their taskmasters were barely as yet healed&#44; when 
they&#94; consulted together in order to appoint a chief 
to return with him to Egypt&#59; freedom was nothing&#44; 
God&#39;s favour unheeded&#44; provided they could drag out 
a miserable existence without being compelled to face 
actual danger&#44; which they had been assured should 
vanisli&#44; provided only they would advance boldly&#44; 
trusting in the Being who had benefitted them al&#8211; 
ready in so many and wonderful ways. ISTeed we 
then wonder that the most condign punishments were 
decreed against the unbelieving generation&#63; It was 
therefore from no undeserved severity that the Lord 
spoke to Moses &#58; 

&#34; How long will this people incense me&#44; and how long will they 
not believe in me&#44; despite of all the signs which I have done in the 
midst of them&#63;&#34; Numb. xiv. 11. 

Instruction had failed to impress them&#59; forgiveness 
for the making of the golden calf had not left a con&#8211; 
viction of their unworthiness &#59; the death of the dis&#8211; 
satisfied longers for meat had also passed unheeded&#58; 
what more could be done to correct the propensity 
to follow in the senseless superstitions of the worship&#8211; 
pers of stocks and stones &#63; Nothing less&#44; than the 
death of the whole generation &#59; and so then it was 
decreed&#44; that of six hundred thousand and up&#8211;

wards of the men over twenty years old at that time&#44; 
but two&#44; the faithfid Caleb and Joshua&#44; should survive 
to enter the holy land&#44; so that the children might be 
taught&#44; daring a weary pilgrimage through the desert 
of forty years&#44; that the only way to deserve the divine 
favour is to have the fullest confidence in the Lord&#39;s 
justice and truth. 

The dreadful decree was announced to the people&#44; 
and that no repentance could revoke what was in&#8211; 
violably to happen&#44; and they were soon convinced 
that it was their duty to submit patiently to the will 
of offended Justice. Still the death of that generation 
did not take place suddenly &#59; but as the various kinds 
of corn and fruit are gathered in&#44; each one in its 
season&#44; while their seed is left to reproduce their like 
asrain in another season &#58; so were the fathers of Israel 
removed one by one&#44; during a period of thirty&#8211;eight 
years&#44; so that the nation remained undiminished&#44; save 
by a very small number&#44; when a second numbering 
took place in the fields of Moab by the Jordan op&#8211; 
posite Jericho&#44; just before the prophet was to lay 
down his authority&#44; and transfer it into the hands of 
his trusty follower Joshua the son of Nun. It was thus 
that Justice sent retribution&#59; but Mercy wielded the 
sword&#44; and sent healing with every wound that was 
inflicted. Those who lacked laith&#44; who being Ihint&#8211; 
hearted under adverse circumstances would probably 
have grown outrageously wicked under success&#44; were 
removed out of the way&#44; not to be a stumbling&#8211;block 
to those who were to continue the household of Israel&#59; 
and these were aU along trained under the immediate 
superintendence of Providence we may freely term 
it&#44; since they knew of. uo.enjoymdni&#59; which did not

come to them more immediately from a supernatural 
Source&#44; than was ever the case with any other people 
that had existed since the creation of the world. And 
when the time of prohation came&#44; when numerous 
well&#8211;appointed armies met them on the field of battle&#44; 
they were ready to obey the call of duty&#44; and they 
did not turn the back on the day of strife. 

Brethren &#33; the eventful history of the exploration 
of Palestine proves to us how abliorrent is in the eyes 
of God that faintheartedness which has its birth in a 
want of a firm trust in liis goodness and truth&#44; tin&#8211; 
fortunately for us&#44; modern times have witnessed an 
analogous dereliction &#59; men have begun to doubt of 
tlie permanence of the obligation which religion de&#8211; 
mands of them. Will they who neglect their duties 
ultimately prosper&#63; will not the broken covenant 
claim its victims as in olden days&#63; Let those&#44; then&#44; 
who have the fear of God in their heart flee from sin 
whilst yet it is time&#59; let them arm themselves with 
faith to resist the temptation with which a new state 
of circumstances surrounds them&#59; and let them then 
turn a deaf ear to all the allurements which a newly 
engendered love for gentile customs addresses to 
them. If our fathers were unwise to desire a&#34;return 
to Egypt&#44; equally foolish is it in us to seek an assimil&#8211; 
ation to those who not long since persecuted us even 
unto death. All foreign alliance is fatal to Israel&#44; all 
desire for it is a betrayal of faith in the Lord. So let 
us stand by the law which was given to us&#44; heedless 
of the attempts to rob us of our heritage&#44; mindful in 
our present state of peace of how much we risked 
and braved to preserve it in days which tried the con&#8211; 
Hiancy of our souls. So will the Lord be with us in

congregational government.&#42; 

Brethren &#33; 

Yesterday you were assembled here to listen to the 
voice of psalmody and thanksgiving&#44; inasmuch as you 
had been spared to see the completion of your ardent 
hopes &#59; and now the house dedicated to the Holy One 
of Israel stands finished&#44; and within the veiled ark 
rests the book of the covenant of your God&#44; yea&#44; i/our 
God&#44; who by his great power purchased unto himself 
your forefathers out of the bondage of Egypt&#44; that 
they might be unto Ilim a people of his heritage&#44; as 
it is this day. Well might a heathen prophet&#44; at see&#8211; 
ing the far&#8211;outspreading camp of Israel&#44; say &#40;Num&#8211; 
bers xxiv. 5&#41; &#58; 

&#34; How goodly are thy tents&#44; O Jacob I thy dwelling&#8211;places&#44; O Is&#8211;

&#94; AikI well may we repeat the same beantifal cxcla&#8211; 
matiou&#44; with all the fervour of awakened piety&#44; when&#44; 
after a short absence or a long separation&#44; we enter 
again the abodes sacred to the name of the Lord&#44; 
erected by the sons of Israel in the various places of 
their dispersion&#44; where the iron hand of power is not 
laid on them to prevent their honouring their Father 
by dedicating houses devoted to his worship. Beau&#8211; 
tiful indeed are those tents&#44;&#8212; those temporary struc&#8211; 
tures where the sons of Jacob worship &#59; they speak 
a language which all the world may understand &#59; they 
proclaim&#44; in a voice louder than that of the brazen 
trumpet&#44; that our brothers&#44; let them come from the 
&#59;East or the West&#44; the North or the South&#44; still cling 
to the ancient faith which was confided unto them &#59; 
that they are true and steadfast&#44; and are not counted 
among the nations &#59; that they know of no law beyond 
the one proclaimed through Moses &#59; that they fear no 
God&#44; except the Holy One who first called Abraham 
to his service&#44; and made afterwards his will known to 
his chosen servants. And ye have been strengthened 
in the Lord&#59; ye have accomplished what you had 
resolved on&#44; to dedicate to Ilim a sanctuary&#44; where 
He might come to dwell among you &#59; and therefore 
those who see you here assembled may fittingly ad&#8211; 
dress you in the words of the holy bard &#58; &#34; Blessed 
be ye who come in the name of the Lord &#59; we bless 
you from the house of the Lord&#59;&#34; we wish you suc&#8211; 
cess in the good work that has been accomplished&#44; 
we wish you success in all the good works you may 
purpose yet to do&#44;&#8212; till the evident satisfaction of the 
Most High may be manifested over you&#44; and the 
labours of your hands stand firm and established

tlirougli his favour. Do you ask for liigLer reward &#63; 
Surely not &#58; tliere is notbing exceeding it. The peace 
within&#44; which the grace of God produces&#44; the holy 
satisfaction which is felt over every duty accomplished&#44; 
is surely a higher recompense than mere power over 
others enjoyed by the proud&#44; or a mortal&#39;s praise pro&#8211; 
ceeding from insincere lips&#44; or monuments erected to 
grudgingly&#8211;acknowledged merit out of perishable ma&#8211; 
terials&#44; which&#44; daringly called indestructible&#44; barely 
survive a single night when assailed by the storms of 
heaven. And then&#44; Avlien God is with you&#44; if you 
have acted so that lie can approve&#44; liow prosperously 
will all your good intentions meet their accomplish&#8211; 
ment&#33; Religion will flourish in your midst&#44; and 
though even worldly wealth and success may be 
denied for the wisest of purposes&#44; the humble life 
which you are destined to lead will be full of those 
heavenly joys&#44; the foretastes of a blessed hereafter&#44; 
which no king on his throne can experience&#44; unless 
ho feel the same humility before God&#44; which your 
faith demands of the lowliest among you. 

Let us now endeavour to trace out some of the 
ideas which are included in the main one of dedi&#8211; 
cating a synagogue to divine service. The iirst which 
will strike you is the principle of union which is re&#8211; 
cjuired before even a single stone can be laid. One 
individual cannot build a house of prayer&#44; unless he 
be gifted with immense wealth &#59; and even if such a 
one be found&#44; &#8212; one Avho is willing to spend his means 
liberally ibr this holy purpose&#44; &#8212; it is still questionable 
whether&#44; under all circumstances&#44; it would be advisa&#8211; 
ble lor a community to permit his doing so. But 
generally speaking&#44; at all events&#44; it is necessary that 

<pb n="105"/>

CONGREGATIONAL GOVERNMENT. 105 

many men combine with a. settled purpose for the 
sake of collecting funds&#44; and properly expending 
them in order to build the liouse of God. One may 
give much&#44; the other may give little&#44; each according 
as his means suffice&#44; or as his liberality impels him&#59; 
and when thus the expenses are secured&#44; there must 
be a plan for building devised&#44; materials must be 
procured&#44; labourers engaged &#59; and only when all these 
have wrought for one well&#8211;defined purpose&#44; when one 
mind has directed all their eflbrts&#44; can the well&#8211;finish&#8211; 
ed enterprise be discovered in the beautiful propor&#8211; 
tions which now greet the eyes of the beholder&#44; and 
the structure be ready to receive the worshippers&#44; 
anxious to enter its portals for prayer and humiliation 
before God. Union alone can perfect the thought 
which at first was merely an undefined idea&#44; perhaps&#44; 
in the mind of the originator&#59; and only by following 
it out in all the various branches needed in the un&#8211; 
dertaking can success crown the fond expectations 
of the pious servants of the Most High&#44; when desiring 
to erect unto Him a sanctuary&#44; whence instruction 
and consolation may flow unto those who confide in 
his mercy. 

The second idea embraced in the work is peace&#44; &#8212; 
that sentiment of good&#8211;will towards each other which 
hallows every work&#44; which renders all the blessings 
of life more instinct with heavenly light. If a union 
of purpose in planning&#44; arranging&#44; and erecting the 
outward sanctuary be absolutely requisite before the 
building can be completed &#58; there is no less demanded 
a mutual bearing and forbearing with one another&#39;s 
foibles and offences&#44; and a mutual concession of views 
in the government of the public affairs. Every one

cannot be right&#44; nor is it likely that every one is al&#8211; 
together ill the wrong in any proposition he may 
make. The only method of proceeding is to ascer&#8211; 
tain the opinion which is favoured by the majority&#59; 
and though those composing the minority have an 
undoubted right to complain&#44; and to endeavour by 
all peaceful and proper means to induce a sufficient 
number of those opposed to them to embrace their 
opinions&#44; so that they in their turn may become the 
majority &#58; they have&#44; till this be effected&#44; no right 
whatever to take exceptions to the views which have 
been adopted as the rules of the congregation&#44; but 
they&#94; are bound to abide by and to uphold them in all 
their vigour&#44; as though they had not only approved&#44; 
but had actually originated them. Whatever has been 
resolved on is for the time being the law of the con&#8211; 
gregation&#44; and&#44; as such&#44; it demands the acquiescence 
of all the members&#44; and they should accordingly 
never threaten a withdrawal from the general body&#34;&#44; 
or put obstacles in the way of the proceedings from 
the mere impulse of offended vanity&#44; because at a 
particular meeting the measures proposed by others 
were adopted&#44; whilst those they offered were rejected. 
There can be no question on the other side&#44; that a 
majority should not rule with a high hand &#59; that it is 
lorong for a number to combine before yropcr deliberation 
to carry a measure at all hazards&#44; be it acceptable to 
many others or not. The rule is&#44; that a nnijority of 
one is as good as one of a hundred&#59; but it is surely 
unwise for a bare plurality of voters to force their per&#8211; 
haps crudely&#8211;digested plans upon their associates&#44; 
though these have good reasons&#44; in all likelihood&#44; for 
their dissent. Power is one thing&#44; propriety and 

<pb n="107"/>

CONGREGATIONAL GOVERNMENT. 107 

right quite another. As said&#44; the minority must&#44; 
and&#44; for that matter&#44; should quietlj&#8211; submit to resolves 
lawliiUy arrived at&#44; when an opportunity has been 
given to hear the dissent freely stated and fairly can&#8211; 
vassed. At the same time&#44; those who have the power 
ought to endeavour to conciliate all sides&#44; and never 
attempt to govern a congregation by party. As soon 
as this is done&#44; then farewell to all love&#44; to all union&#44; 
to all peace. We should meet as brothers&#44; all bavin o&#8211; 
one uniform end in view&#44; &#8212; the promotion of godli&#8211; 
ness&#44; the spread of the divine kingdom&#44; the sanctifi&#8211; 
cation of every son of Israel&#44; in and through the law 
and commandments revealed to us through Moses and 
the prophets&#59; and whatever tends best to promote 
these ends is alone to be followed out in our congre&#8211; 
gational transaction&#94;&#94;. ISTo one should presume to be 
better than his neighbour&#59; and if he be richer&#44; wiser&#44; 
or more respected&#44; that is something for him to be 
grateful for&#59; but it is no reason why he should look 
Avith disdain upon one less favoured. He may argue&#44; 
he may plead with his fellow&#8211;men to forego their 
prejudices&#44; and to join him in views which he deems 
honestly to be better in their tendency. But never 
let him use threats&#44; violence&#44; or unlawful combina&#8211; 
tions&#59; never let him&#44; for the sake of carrying a fa&#8211; 
vourite measure&#44; close his ears to appeals not to pro&#8211; 
ceed hastily and without sufficient cause. Something 
really good can wait a little postponement&#59; a useful 
measure of reform will ultimately be carried&#44; despite 
of some temporary delay&#59; and&#44; though we all may 
individually regret the slow progress certain whole&#8211; 
some measures make&#44; notwithstanding our efforts to 
induce the public to adopt them&#44; we ought neither to 

<pb n="108"/>

108 CONGREGATIONAL GOVERNMENT. 

urge them forward prematurely&#44; nor to be angry with 
others for not adopting them at once&#59; nor&#44; on the other 
hand&#44; onglit we to relinquish them because of our 
first disappointment &#59; but we sliould bear with pa&#8211; 
tience the ill&#8211;success of our endeavours&#44; and try to 
seek a more fitting opportunity of inducing a public 
acceptance. 

One of the greatest trials of those who have the 
management of our congregations does consist in the 
perversity of many of the members&#44; who&#44; always dis&#8211; 
satisfied with any measure which they have not them&#8211; 
selves proposed&#44; endeavour to create disturbance and 
dissatisfaction in others&#44; who&#44; but for their animad&#8211; 
versions&#44; would have passed the matter over in silence&#44; 
and&#44; perhaps&#44; without feeling anywise aggrieved by 
the same. It is perhaps difiicult to deal with such as 
these&#44; either through means of persuasion or by pass&#8211; 
ing by their machinations with silent uegleet &#59; they 
are in all likelihood too obstinate to understand for&#8211; 
bearance&#44; and too restless to permit silent disregard 
to put a permanent check on them. But even with 
these there is no occasion to proceed to the extent of 
open hostility. Conciliate them&#44; brethren&#44; if such 
are among you&#44; which I hope&#44; however&#44; may never 
be the case. If there are any grounds for complaint 
Avhich they can justly urge&#44; endeavour to redress them 
in time&#59; remove every species of burden which may 
lie heavily on those whose means may be circum&#8211; 
scribed&#44; and never let a brilliant scheme of any sort 
induce you to rush hastily upon expenditures which 
the public resources cannot easily defray. Give&#44; in 
short&#44; no cause for fault&#8211;finding to the vast majority&#44; 
who are always rightly&#8211;thinking people&#44; though once

in a while they may be misled by demagogical 
would&#8211;be leaders &#59; and&#44; if you do this faithfully U&#92;i/b 
D&#39;Dty&#44; you need never fear the restless beings under 
discussion&#44; who are unfortunately to be found in 
every community&#44; from the few members of a house&#8211; 
liold to those who compose the masses of a mighty 
empire. But if your object is to carry your measures 
with the high hand of authority&#59; if you forget that 
you are stewards merely&#44; appointed over the house of 
God for the general good&#44; and that only by promot&#8211; 
ing this you can really be benefitted yourselves&#59; if 
you imagine that the confidence of your brothers&#44; 
which has raised you to dignity&#44; places you at once 
far above their cognizance&#44; and your acts beyond the 
range of their scrutiny&#58; then know that you are un&#8211; 
faithful servants&#44; they who &#34; do the work of Heaven 
slothfully&#44;&#34; and no good can result from your meas&#8211; 
ures&#44; and no respect can attach to you because of 
your oflice &#59; nothing but evil can spring from your 
administration&#44; and the sooner then you quit your 
station&#44; the better for the public good&#44; the better for 
yourselves&#44; unless you will brave the wrath of God&#44; 
who&#44; whilst watching over the great concerns of man&#8211; 
kind&#44; does not pass by unnoticed the affairs of each 
and every community of Israelites in all their disper&#8211; 
sions. It should be your serious endeavour to follow 
the advice of one of our ancient doctors of the Mish&#8211; 
nah&#44; who says &#58; u&#94;h onoj&#59; D&#39;poi&#59;&#39; vrr &#34;ini&#39;n d&#59;&#39; D&#39;pou&#39;n hz&#41; 
â–¡oc&#39; &#34; And all who are busied for the congregation 
should busy themselves with them for the name of 
Heaven&#44;&#34; by which expression our Rabbins always 
meant to convey a pure disinterested act&#44; performed 
as a duty which we owe to God&#44; and for the faithful 
VOL. vir. 10

performance of which we are directly responsible to 
liiin who knows the actions and motives of man&#44; and 
is always ready to punish or reward just as our con&#8211; 
duct may deserve. 

It is accordingly not the office which the public ad&#8211; 
ministrators should desire&#44; but the benefit of the peo&#8211; 
ple&#59; and hence&#44; if they find that they cannot carry 
the measures which they believe necessary and nseful 
without exciting more than a passing discontent&#44; if 
they have just cause to expect virulent opposition 
and personal enmity to spring from their proposed 
line of conduct&#58; they ought to transfer back their 
authority to those k&#8211;oia whom they have received it&#44; 
so that no act of theirs may give cause for enmity or 
controversy in the councils of their constituents. 
There is more dignity acquired in thus relinquishing 
a post which has lost its power of cfl&#58;ecting good&#44; 
than&#44; by triumphing over opponents&#44; run the risk of 
estranging the good wishes of many. If the people 
prefer your administration to that of any other party 
which they could select&#44; they can easily Express this 
preference by calling you again to the places which 
you have voluntarily vacated&#59; so that on no possible 
ground of true expediency can you ever be justified 
to urge forward hastily any measures of doubtful 
propriety. On the other hand&#44; as said before&#44; the in&#8211; 
dividual members of the congregation have no right 
whatsoever to expect that the directors shall yield to 
every whim or fancy of theirs&#59; to postpone acts for 
the public good simply because they do not like&#44; or 
because they have not originated them. Nor have 
they any just reason to withdraw from public meet&#8211; 
inirs because men obnoxious to them have been elected 

<pb n="111"/>

CONGREGATIONAL GOVERNMENT. 111 

to office&#44; or because&#44; despite of their opposition&#44; a re&#8211; 
solve has been adopted against the sanction of which 
tliey liave earnestly laboured. There is&#44; it is true&#44; a 
limit to this &#59; for if the acts of the public bodies should 
unfortunately be such that conscientious scruples are 
involved in yielding thereto &#59; then opposition will be 
a duty&#59; and if this should prove of no avail&#44; then a 
temporary withdrawal may become excusable or even 
necessary. But where mere expediency or a dilfer&#8211; 
ence about electing one or the other person is con&#8211; 
cerned&#44; there is no question but that a cheerful acqui&#8211; 
escence in the action of the public becomes the bound&#8211; 
en and sacred duty of every individual member. 

It is only by such a mutual concession that peace 
in any community can be preserved&#44; and useless con&#8211; 
tention be avoided. It is only thus that men can 
meet and concert measures for their own and the 
public welfare&#59; for then those whom the Lord has 
blessed with wisdom can step forward to counsel in 
any matter in which deliberation is requisite &#59; for 
then only can those who have wealth contribute the 
requisite materials&#44; knowing that they will be well 
and wisely applied&#59; and those who are intrusted 
with the execution of any scheme can proceed cheer&#8211; 
fully with the work&#44; because they&#94; are confident that 
they will meet with encouragement and approbation 
from the public voice&#44; and be aided by all when as&#8211; 
sistance should become necessary. It is only when 
union and peace reign among us that we can hope to 
see education flourish in our midst&#59; since&#44; to effect 
this&#44; counsel&#44; pecuniary means&#44; and an upholding of 
the rules to be adopted&#44; are required to enable us to 
progress with the good work of refining the intellect&#44;

diffusing knowledge&#44; and implanting religions infor&#8211; 
mation among infants and adults. And by this 
means solelj&#8211; can we combat the injurious effects of 
the so&#8211;called spirit of the age&#44; which has already at&#8211; 
tempted&#44; and threatens to do yet more so&#44; to rob us 
of our religion&#44; by weakening our faith in its tenets 
and bv abridi&#94;fins&#94; the ran2&#58;e of observance. For our 
children must be taught to know the ways of their 
God&#44; and to have a clear understanding of the scope 
and tcndency of his precepts&#44; before they can with&#8211; 
stand the arguments of sophistry and a pretended 
wisdom&#44; which is based solely upon den3ang all that 
is ancient&#44; which would subject everything to the 
caprice of fashion and change&#44; even the unchangea&#8211; 
ble and the eternal &#34;Word of our heavenly Father. 

It is only through union and peace that the friendly 
relation of man to his neighbour&#44; as enjoined in the 
law&#44; can be maintained &#59; because then only do we 
behold a friend and brother in all mankind &#59; then we 
see the poor only to aid him &#59; we behold the naked 
only to cover his shivering limbs&#59; we perceive the

other&#44; no sympathy with the degraded state of our 
fellows&#44; can find a place in our breast&#44; and religion 
languishes&#44; and humanity weeps&#44; because the founda&#8211; 
tions on which they rest have been pulled down by 
the greatest enemies which our mental &#94;eace can 
know. Well therefore said our wise men &#58; &#34; The 
Lord could not find any vessel containing so much 
blessing as peace&#59; wherefore the Psalm affirms. The 
Lord would give strength to his people&#44; He therefore 
blesseth his people with peace.&#34; These are the words 
of the Siiges and teachers of Israel&#44; based upon the 
sui&#41;erior wisdom of the records of revelation &#59; and it 
is well for you&#44; brethren&#44; at the present moment when&#44; 
through union and liberal expenditure&#44; you have 
erected this house of prayer to the name of the God 
of Israel&#44; and have assembled here to lift up your 
voices in praise and prayer before his awful presence&#44; 
to reflect deeply upon the work you have done&#44; and 
to strive that the great blessing of peace may not be 
banished from you through any fault of yours&#59; that 
no act of oppression or of injustice may drive the 
humblest strangers from the portals of this house. 
And unite hand and heart&#44; counsel and action&#44; that 
nothing but brotherly union and a peace founded on 
the fear of God may reside within these walls &#58; so that 
all who come hither to worship&#44; whether they be resi&#8211; 
dents of this town or strangers from a distant laud&#44; 
whether they be sons of Israel or those who are not 
of Jacob&#39;s descendants&#44; may exclaim&#44; in the words 
of the sweet singer of our own God&#8211;favoured race&#44; 
&#34; Behold&#44; how good and how pleasant it is for breth&#8211; 
ren to dwell together in unity &#33;&#34; seeing that you are

brothers in faith&#44; and united by the bonds of peace&#44; 
concord&#44; and union. 

Another idea which is connected with the erection 
by Israelites of a synagogue is that of godliness. It 
is not for&#94;he sake of ostentation that we are to build 
houses of prayer&#59; not that we may be equal to our 
gentile neighbours in the possession of handsome 
meeting&#8211;places&#59; but that we may be enabled to as&#8211; 
semble on a spot especially dedicated to the Redeemer 
of our fathers&#44; there to pour forth our prisons&#44; and 
there to be strengthened in faith and obedience. We 
wish to meet there with our fellows in belief and 
bope &#59; we wish to be animated by their example&#44; and 
humbly to endeavour to influence them in return by 
our own words and deeds. We wish to meet with 
those worthy to be called Israelites&#44; and we trust fer&#8211; 
vently that our joining ourselves with them may con&#8211; 
tribute in a measure to render us acceptable to the 
Deity. But how can we accomplish this accepta&#8211; 
bility &#63; Is it merely by appearing here or elsewhere 
at stated periods to be seen of men&#44; and to exhibit 
ostentatiously our festive garments&#44; our costly jewels&#44; 
or at best our public liberality &#63; Are we to come 
before God in the pride of external trappings&#44; of what&#8211; 
ever kind they may be&#44; it matters not which&#44; and then 
say that we have done enough&#44; when we have erected 
to Ilim a handsome house&#63; when we have appeared 
there becoming our station in life&#63; when we have 
there distributed of our wealth for the public good&#63; 
Perhaps there may be many who deem that by acts 
like these they have done all that is demanded of 
them. But if thus any one of you reasons&#44; he mis&#8211; 
takes the truth &#59; he is lamentably deficient in all that

wliicli God requires of&#34; him before he can be received 
in favour&#44; l&#94;o objection can be made to our coming 
ill an outwardly becomiug manner wlien we assemble 
for prayer&#59; but the inward beauty&#39; of holiness must 
not be wanting to falsify the handsome extftnor. No 
one must come to show himself among the faithful&#44; 
whilst he neglects the precepts of the law&#59; it is not 
religion to be a constant attendant at prayers on the 
Sabbath&#44; only to quit this house to attend to secular 
aftairs&#44; to business or amusements&#59; to be devout at 
synagogue&#44; whilst at home you devour forbidden food&#44; 
or neglect to train your children in the pleasant&#44; 
peaceful paths of your faith &#59; for such hypocrisy would 
only expose you to the vengeance of the God who 
liates falsehood&#44; and who does not tolerate ostenta&#8211; 
tious sacrifices accompanied by iniquity. 

Your meeting here is in fact declaring that you 
acknowledge yourselves servants of&#8211; the Lord&#59; you 
assemble here to present yourselves to the King of 
the universe&#44; the Master of your life&#44; the Creator of 
your spirit. Serve Him then in singleness of heart&#44; 
in purity of soul&#44; in devoted faith&#44; in meek submis&#8211; 
sion. Go to the synagogue to pray and to meditate&#44; 
and issue thence improved in your sentiments&#44; and 
add the grace of private conformity to public adora&#8211; 
tion. Every deed thus performed will tend to im&#8211; 
prove your spirit&#44; and render the next step in piety 
easier and more pleasant. And when the house of 
God thus tends to incite one by the example of the 
other&#44; if the prayer offered up in the community of 
the faithful enters deeply into the whole being of the 
worshipper&#44; if the law proclaimed in the hearing of 
all finds a response in the willingness of the awakened

conscience&#44; and when all present resolve to be faithful 
to all which the Lord asks of them &#58; then can you 
truly afiirni that godliness has sprung from your dedi&#8211; 
cating a dwelling&#8211;place unto the God of Abraham&#44; 
Isaac&#44; an&#94; Jacob&#59; his spirit will mingle itself in your 
assemblies&#44; and the peace of Ileaveu will invigorate 
your souls&#44; and union and harmony will strongly bind 
brother to brother&#44; and conduce to render the perilous 
journey of life more pleasant and less arduous than 
otherwise it would be&#44; seeing that the helping hand 
is held out to the needy&#44; the foolish are instructed in 
the way of salvation&#44; and the tear of anguish is dried 
up by the holy words of consolation. And should 
this result be found among you&#44; beloved brothers iu 
the Lord &#33; through this house&#44; which will hencefor&#8211;

Gates of Prayer&#44; whence their orisons may ascend

has been erected unto thy pure and holy worship&#44; 
where they of the seed of Israel may resort&#44; to offer 
up unto Thee prayer without guile&#44; and praise with&#8211; 
out a deceitful tongue. &#33; how great is the thought&#44; 
that mortal man is permitted by thy own expressed 
will to build a house for the dwelling of thy spirit&#33; 
behold&#44; the whole world cannot embrace thy essence&#44; 
and yet Thou wiliest to dwell in a sanctuary&#44; the 
work of the hands of man&#59; for even according to thy 
unending greatness is thy miraculous condescension. 
But Thou&#44; Iloliest&#44; Purest&#33; demandest a sanctifying 
spirit&#44; in order that man himself may hallow his 
labour to make it acceptable unto Thee. Aid us&#44;

the ills which beset our path during our pilgrimage&#44; 
and give to each of us his daily bread&#44; and endow 
all with wisdom to understand the pure truth of thy 
holy law&#59; so that&#44; understanding our responsibility&#44; 
wp may subdue the stubbornness of our heart of 
stone&#44; and walk before Thee in the humility proper 
to fallen&#44; sinful man. And upon this house shed thy

DISCOURSE IX. 

DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY. 

O God of Israel&#33; we acknowlecige before Thee 
thy unending truth and kindness which Thou hast 
shown to our fathers and to us their descendants&#59; in&#8211; 
asmuch as Thou didst bring us near unto thy service&#44; 
and establish thy kingdom in the midst of our hearts 
by imparting to us the knowledge of thy ways and 
of the deeds we should do. But wo unto us &#33; that we 
would not hearken&#44; and that we entered the path of 
iniquity which ends only in destruction&#59; and we ac&#8211; 
knowledge therefore that in righteousness were thy 
judgments sent&#44; and that we merited all the evils 
which overwhelmed us in our own land and since our 
general dispersion among the nation. But even in 
thy indignation we have had the manifest evidence 
of thy truth &#59; and the storm of adversity passed over 
without consuming us &#59; for thy glory was in the 
blast&#44; and it purified whilst it prostrated &#59; and we&#44; un&#8211; 
worthy though we be in thy sight&#44; have not ceased to 
exist&#44; but are left to experience yet longer thy protec&#8211; 
tion and thy chastisement&#44; to be forever thy witnesses&#44; 
even unto the day of the gathering of all nations iu 
the valley of judgment&#44; when Thou wilt show to all 
who is holy&#44; and bring near unto thyself those Thou 
hast chosen&#44; by the signs and wonders which Thou 
alone canst display&#44; and set them up as a light to the

nations&#44; that these too niay come and seek thy service 
in truth and singleness of faith. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

If the object of the Creator is benevolence&#44; and a 
shigle unbiassed look at every thing around us suffi&#8211; 
ciently establishes this&#44; the bestowal of religion could 
not have originated from any other than this motive. 
Whoever then regards it as an unnecessary restriction 
placed upon his natural liberty&#44; as a useless restraint 
which interferes unpleasantly with his prerogative as 
a free agent&#44; has certainly not arrived at a satisfactorj&#8211; 
conclusion with regard to his own position iu refer&#8211; 
ence to society&#44; nor as&#39; respects the fact that he is 
himself an emanation from the Creator. Unrestrained 
liberty would presuppose that we owed nothing to 
any one beyond ourselves&#59; and if we then wish to 
exercise this when we are about to act&#44; Ave must in 
return expect the same exhibition of freedom from 
others ta us&#44; if they have to do anything which may 
affect us iw a great or small degree. Absolute free&#8211; 
dom of action also requires a state of irresponsibility&#44; 
an autocratic exercise of all our faculties &#59; and still 
where is the man who can say of himself&#44; that lie 
owes allegiance nowhere&#63; and again&#44; if allegiance is 
due to any one in the smallest conceivable degree&#44; 
then is unrestrained will a thing not to be thought of. 
Men in an humble sphere of life&#44; those for instance 
who work by the day for others in return for a snuiU 
pittance which supplies them with scanty drink and 
limited food&#44; may in their bitterness of incessant toil 
imagine that the masters of their labour nmst bo 
happy&#44; since they can control all with their wealth and

tlirongli tlieir standing in the community&#59; but in 
good truth are they not depending on their liirehngs 
for the work these perform for them &#63; Even assume 
that a pure spirit of benevolence actuates them in 
employing many in order to supply them in an hon&#8211; 
ourable manner with the things they need &#58; still are 
they&#94; beholden to them or to others not so immedi&#8211; 
ately depending upon them for the production of the 
bread they eat&#44; and for the garments which they wear&#44; 
for the houses in which they live&#44; for the water even 
which they drink&#44; nay for the very means by which 
they can obtain so simple a thing as a common rush&#8211; 
light placed in a mean earthen vessel &#59; since no one is 
able to provide himself by his own unaided labour 
with the necessaries of life except in a very limited 
degree&#44; and then at the expense of such toil and time&#44; 
that existence must lose all charm and pleasure. We 
will not in this connexion look upon man as depend&#8211; 
ing on a Supreme Being&#44; my intention being to ex&#8211; 
hibit the necessity of duty from a reference to man 
as surrounded simply by those of a similar nature to 
himself So soon&#44; therefore&#44; as he steps from beyond 
the limits of isolation and enters into society&#44; let the 
relation be what it may&#44; as a subject or a ruler&#44; as a 
child or parent&#44; as a scholar or teacher&#44; as a labourer 
or master&#44; he ceases from that moment to have a nat&#8211; 
ural right to the uncontrolled exercise of his will&#44; so 
soon as this can come into collision with the wishes 
or convenience of others&#59; and this must be so in 
every imaginable organization&#44; and in every state&#44; of 
society. This means simply that we have reciprocal 
duties to perform&#59; and with this admission we ac&#8211; 
knowledge that we cannot be left to the uncontrolled

122 DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY. 

exercise of our own will and pleasure&#44; the v&#94;ery term 
duty&#44; or indebtedness&#44; being in opposition to unre&#8211; 
stricted license. If men were even tben&#44; at this mo&#8211; 
ment&#44; to iind themselves in a state of nature&#44; entirely 
uncontrolled by laws&#44; untrammelled by any moral or 
religious restrictions &#58; they would soon ascertain that 
this condition of things could not last&#44; if they wished 
for the least security&#44; or for the smallest share of do&#8211; 
mestic enjoyment. I need not paint to you the evils 
which would follow upon a state of perfect anarchy 
in this very community &#59; each one of you can well im&#8211; 
agine the state of horror where our weakness would 
expose us to assault of the violent&#44; and the strong 
man would be compelled on his part to unsheath the 
sword in order to move along unmolested and to 
ward off constant danger. Mankind would soon van&#8211; 
ish&#44; at least all refinement and elegance would neces&#8211; 
sarily perish&#44; if society were to be disorganized upon 
the basis that might made right. Even those of a 
strong hand and hasty impulses&#44; whose greatest de&#8211; 
light it seems to be to bear rule over the weaker or 
more yielding&#44; would speedily discover that they 
Avould necessarily become exposed amidst such con&#8211; 
fusion to the violence of those more cunning and en&#8211; 
ergetic than themselves&#59; and consequently all&#44; with&#8211; 
out exception&#44; whether they be strong and intelligent 
or otherwise&#44; have their interests best subserved by a 
mutual forbearance and a certain degree of order 
among all the members of society&#44; let them be of 
whatever degree of station and mental and physical 
development&#59; and this at once establishes a line of 
duty Avhich all have to practise towards each other. 
Let us now take the second element in the compo&#8211; 

<pb n="123"/>

DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY. 123 

sition of our duty&#44; that we are emanations from a 
Creator &#58; and we have at once an additional motive 
for submitting to certain restrictions and artiUcial re&#8211; 
straints upon our will&#44; &#8212; I call artificial those which 
are not based upon phj&#8211;sical inability&#44; and which are 
therefore not originating in the powerlessness of man&#44; 
but in the will of some one superior&#44; or in a conven&#8211; 
tional agreement with society at large&#44; and are super&#8211; 
added as a governing principle over and above tq 
that which is impossible for him to accomplish by 
not having been endowed by nature with the facul&#8211; 
ties for its achievement. If we now regard ourselves 
as deriving our being and the power of exertion from 
the Supreme &#58; we cannot avoid acknowledging to our&#8211; 
selves the legitimate right on his part to ask of us to 
use our faculties in such a manner as He may direct&#44; 
and to eschew using them&#44; even if inclination should 
prompt&#44; in every case and at every season when this 
may be demanded by Him for any cause whatever. 
Now&#44; as it is not to be expected that every man is to 
receive a particular illumination&#44; in order to teach 
him what he is to do and what to avoid &#58; it is enough 
that there be general laws and principles by which all 
may regulate their doings and omissions&#44; and act 
agreeably to the wishes of their Creator. It is then 
not so much the abridgment of our natural liberty 
of action which is contemplated&#44; as the limiting of 
our rights in reference to other men and the Creator&#59; 
since every act&#44; whether small or great&#44; must have an 
effect somewhere beyond ourselves&#44; so soon as it pro&#8211; 
ceeds beyond those things which have reference to 
the mere preservation of our physical existence and 
health &#59; nay&#44; even these again may become legitimate 

<pb n="124"/>

124 DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY. 

subjects of legislation&#44; inasmuch as we are here by 
the express permission of God&#44; endowed with his 
gifts&#59; wherefore both our existence and the powers 
of mind and body bestowed on us were conferred for 
a certain purpose&#44; though this be unknown to us&#59; 
consequently our own personal life and Avell&#8211;being 
are matters in which lie may be supposed to feel a 
paternal interest&#44; and therefore He has a just right to 
prescribe to us how we are to act&#44; so that our life and 
health maj&#8211; be preserved in the best possible manner. 
And as&#44; on the other hand&#44; no man scarcely stands 
so isolated that his existence can be a matter of per&#8211; 
fect indifi&#39;erence to all mankind&#58; society has also a 
right to demand of him that he is to do nothing to 
injure his health and life&#44; so that his exertions&#44; when 
required&#44; may contribute to the support of his family&#44; 
and by the bestowal of counsel and the personal ser&#8211; 
vice of the state&#44; to the general welfare. 

Let us take a view of religion by this simple light&#44; 
and what is it &#63; Merely the regulations which the 
Creator has instituted for the preservation of a knowl&#8211; 
edge of his providence&#44; for the security of society&#44; and 
for the preservation of the individual &#59; or wliat is the 
same&#44; for the promotion of the general good. To 
know that He rules&#44; that He wills our happiness&#44; that 
He watches over the afiairs of nations and indivichials&#44; 
will leave us always ample room for the exercise of 
all our faculties in a useful and ao&#8211;reeable manner&#44; 
though our life should be prolong&#8211;ed to any imagina&#8211; 
ble extent&#59; and whatever religion denies to us&#44; we 
may be assured&#44; Avill militate against our natural dutj&#34; 
to God and tlic happiness of society&#44; and this at last 
is all which the greatest claimant of personal liberty 

<pb n="125"/>

DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY. 125 

can reasonably demand &#59; since he is a creature of God 
whether he is Avilling to acknowledge it or not&#44; and 
is amenable by his being here to the laws of society 
in his relative position to his fellow&#8211;men. To any 
single individual the religious laws may be oppres&#8211; 
sive&#44; he may not feel the want of them&#44; nor compre&#8211; 
hend the reason for their enactment&#59; but this does 
not say&#44; that any unjust burden has been placed upon 
him&#44; or that his legitimate sphere of action has been 
uselessly circumscribed. 

Religion in all its manifold prohibitions has ac&#8211; 
cordingly but one object&#44; that is the general welfare&#44; 
and is intended to produce a state of society&#44; in which 
the Creator is regarded as the supreme&#44; the legiti&#8211; 
mate Source of all authority&#44; and mankind as equals 
in origin&#44; in rights and in destiny&#44; all having a uni&#8211; 
form claim to each other&#39;s good&#8211;will and offices of 
kindness. It is easy then to understand from what 
source opposition to religion springs &#58; it is namely&#44; 
the idea of self&#8211;sufficiency which raises a man in his 
own estimation above the prescribed rules and laws 
enacted for the general observance&#59; since he vainly 
imagines that&#44; however necessary they may be to 
others so as to insure among the rest of mankind his 
own safety and peace&#44; he is not for the moment bound 
to adhere to them&#44; either because a good opportunity 
for transgression presents itself&#44; or because his own 
intellect will prevent any hurtful result to arise from 
his conduct&#44; or because he will not listen to instruc&#8211; 
tion from an overweening sense of pride and a con&#8211; 
lidence in his judgment. The very idea of unbelief 
is a species of pride&#44; an evidence merely that the un&#8211; 
believer does not wish to listen to divine teaching&#59; 

11&#42; 

<pb n="126"/>

126 DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY. 

Lis own sense is sufficient&#44; so lie imagines&#44; to teach 
him how to act&#59; and he is therefore incredulous with 
respect to the first assertion of religion&#44; on which it is 
based&#44; that there has been given to us a revelation as a 
special gift from heaven. Every such admission is a 
gainsaying of the perfect efficacy of human reason&#59; 
consequently the egotist will not acknowledge&#44; by an 
observance of positive religious precepts&#44; that there 
is anything which he could solely obtain from a su&#8211; 
perior Source&#44; in matters which relate to the govern&#8211; 
ment of himself in moral concerns&#59; hence&#44; though 
he must often feel convinced that there is truth and 
sublimity in the revelation which is in our possession&#44; 
he will affect to disbelieve&#44; because one or the other 
of its precepts would act as a restraint upon his in&#8211; 
clination&#44; not because he does not deem such regula&#8211; 
tions beneficial in the case of other persons. 

The same was the cause of the transgression of our 
forefathers. They had been promised that with obe&#8211; 
dience to the divine law&#44; they should have plenty in 
all their boundaries&#44; as the physical evidence of divine 
favour&#59; that they should be exempt from disease&#44; 
famine and war&#44; as the outward token that their 
course of life was pleasing to God &#58; while at the same 
time the Lord would establish among them his resi&#8211; 
dence&#44; whence unseen pure spiritual blessings should 
be imparted to their souls. But this polity was ac&#8211; 
companied witli many restrictions&#44; both political and 
individual &#59; the mighty and the rich were ordered 
to be liberal to the needy to protect those who 
were helpless&#44; and to succour the distressed&#59; they 
were told to let universal freedom prevail among 
all their brothers of the house of Israel so soon as the

jubilee&#44; the year of liberty and release&#44; had been pro&#8211; 
claimed at its periodical recurrence&#44; that is&#44; once in 
every fifty years &#59; it was then that the poor man should 
return to his family&#44; and the paternal estate&#44; which 
he had been compelled to dispose of&#44; was to be re&#8211; 
stored to him free from any charge of mortgage&#8211;right 
or annual rent to the purchasers. In personal con&#8211; 
duct&#44; the Sabbath was established as a weekly day of 
rest&#59; many degrees of consanguinity were prohibited 
as those from which marriages could not take place &#59; 
certain kinds of food were interdicted&#44; and many cere&#8211; 
monial acts were prescribed which were to be per&#8211; 
formed by Israelites in consequence of their being in 
covenant with their heavenly King. In short&#44; the 
Israelites were hemmed round with ordinances which 
were not obligatory upon their gentile neighbours &#59; no 
man however powerful had any especial rights&#44; conse&#8211; 
quently the great could not acquire that absolute con&#8211; 
trol over the humble as was the case with the hea&#8211; 
thens of those days &#59; and no matter how far a man 
might have progressed in scientific attainments&#44; he 
was governed by the selfsame laws which bound the 
unlettered ploughman who toils in the field from sun&#8211; 
rise until evening&#44; or the simple shepherd who feeds 
his flock on some lonely mountain&#8211;top or the pastures 
of the desert. With the Israelites it was all &#34; serve 
God&#44; and love thy neighbour&#59;&#34; under the one head 
many acts of personal sanctity were demanded&#44; some 
of which interfered wath the ease and the pursuit of 
pleasure on the part of tlie worldling &#59; and under the 
other&#44; the least act of injustice&#44; of fraud&#44; or of decep&#8211; 
tion&#44; was visited by judicial punishment&#44; or when com&#8211; 
mitted in high places&#44; and could thus not be reached

in the ordinary course&#44; it was denounced by tlie 
prophets&#44; the messengers of the Lord. So stood the 
case&#44; when the unbridled license of heathenism at&#8211; 
tracted the attention of the Hebrew people&#59; and they 
truly considered that there was an absolute agree&#8211; 
ment between the service of the God of Jacob&#44; and 
that universal moral sanctity and exercise of justice 
which were demanded of them&#59; whereas heathen&#8211; 
ism furnished but few traces of morality and regard 
for the rights of the humble of the earth. So then 
they resorted to idolatry&#44; not because they could 
believe in the follies and superstitions which they 
saw practised&#44; but because&#44; by throwing oif the God 
of the Scriptures&#44; they would also rid themselves of 
the onerous restrictions which their self&#8211;indulsrence 
had to encounter in the execution of the divine pre&#8211; 
cepts. And thus they sinned. What was now the 
result&#63; Did freedom increase in the land with the 
dismissal of the priests from the family of Aaron&#63; 
was the liberty to sacrifice through any one and at 
every place&#44; the enjoyment of the greatest freedom 
of action&#44; promotive of the happiness and security of 
the lower classes and the peace of the state &#63; Far 
from it&#59; with the increase of idolatry came the prev&#8211; 
alence of licentiousness in the family&#8211;circle&#59; came 
the state of vassalage&#44; of slavery of free&#8211;born Israelites 
to their wealthy neighbours&#59; came the forgetfulness 
of justice&#44; so that the stranger&#39;s cause was unheeded&#44; 
and the widow and the orphan pleaded in vain for 
their rights &#59; came disunion in the state and a rapid 
descent from the high degree of refinement which it 
once had attained. Thus therefore complains the pro&#8211; 
phet Isaiah &#58; &#34; Hear&#44; heavens&#44; and give ear&#44; O earth &#33;

The ox knoweth his owner&#44; and the ass his master&#39;s 
crib&#59; Israel doth Dot know&#44; my people doth not con&#8211; 
sider&#59;&#34; meaning&#44; that the ingratitude of Israel was 
beyond measure. In Egypt we were bondmen&#44; groan&#8211; 
ing under an almost hopeless slavery&#44; wdien God mani&#8211; 
fested himself to our fathers&#44; and purchased us through 
his goodness to be Ids people. And many other acts 
of mercy also had been superadded&#59; but wdien all the 
promises of kindness and truth had been faithfully 
accomplished&#44; we forgot all that had occurred&#44; and 
though grown great under the fostering care of our 
heavenly education&#44; &#94;ve rebelled against the Father 
who had done all this for us. More ungrateful than 
the ox who soon learns to know the man who has 
bought him&#44; more heedless than the silly ass who re&#8211; 
turns for shelter and food to the stall where he is 
usually fed &#58; we would not know the God who had 
proved to us his power and mercy&#59; and the constant 
display of his rewards in return for our small deeds 
of righteousness we would not recognize as acts of 
his providence&#44; but ascribed them to our own intel&#8211; 
lect&#44; to our skill and enterprise. And then followed&#44; 
as a natural consequence&#44; that we set ourselves up 
above the law and its Author&#59; and exclaims the 
prophet &#58; &#34; Wo &#33; sinful nation&#44; people laden with ini&#8211; 
quity&#44; seed of evildoers&#44; children that are corrupt&#59; 
they have incensed the Holy One of Israel&#44; they have 
departed backward.&#34; And what was the effect on 
the political state of the people &#63; Again hear Isaiah &#58; 
&#34; How is she become a harlot&#44; the faithful city &#33; she

now murderers.&#34; And he concludes his terrible pic&#8211; 
ture of the wickedness of his own people&#44; by saying &#58; 

&#34; They princes are rebels&#44; and companions of thieves&#59; every one 
lovetli bribes&#44; and runnetii after rewards&#59; the fatherless they judge 
not&#44; and the cause of the widow doth not come unto them.&#34; Isaiah 
i. 23. 

It was not then the freedom from oppressive cere&#8211; 
monial acts which the transgressors desired&#44; but the 
freedom from all control&#44; &#8212; the privilegeof being disso&#8211; 
lute in manners&#44; and oppressive to every one who had 
not the strength to defend his own cause&#59; the orphan 
they did not judge&#44; he had no powerful friends to 
plead his case&#44; he appealed perhaps against one of the 
very judges who had plundered the estate of his de&#8211; 
ceased father&#59; crime had become enshrined in the 
place of justice&#44; and hence the lone widow could not 
think of approaching the workers of oppression with 
an appeal to listen to her cause&#44; since she could not 
purchase the verdict of a venal tribunal&#44; already cor&#8211; 
rupted by the gold or overawed by the political in&#8211; 
fluence of her mighty antagonist. 

Our history te&#41;&#42;s how this lawlessness ended. Even 
without the direct influence of divine vengeance&#44; 
which caused destruction to pass speedily over the 
land&#44; our commonwealth must have sunk sooner or 
later under such misrule. But it might have taken 
several centuries longer to sap the foundations of the 
state by slow degrees&#59; since our people were naturally

fearless in battle&#44; and wise in counsel and expedients&#58; 
whilst their land was one full of natural defences&#44; be&#8211; 
sides that art had been invoked to add tliereto by 
walls and towers and other appliances of the military 
art. Such a people and such a land might have bid 
deiiance to any nation under ordinary circumstances&#59; 
but under the influence of a load of sin our warriors 
stumbled on the day of strife&#44; their swords were 
blunted&#44; and their arrows were pointless&#44; and their 
javelins were sent forth harmless&#44; and our fortified 
cities crumbled into dust before the blows of the as&#8211; 
sailant&#44; and desolation took up its abode in the fertile 
valleys and the forest&#8211;clad hills and mountains of 
Palestine. And what did we gain by the exchange 
of the theocracy for the freedom of the heathens &#63; 
Let our mournful history tell&#44; how instead of the 
mild restraints which are merely the checks upon 
unbridled license&#44; we had to submit to all manner 
of hardship and sorrow&#44; inflicted on us by those very 
nations whose habits we were anxious to copy&#44; whose 
false gods we foolishly adopted. If ever the truth 
of any system and its justice were vindicated by his&#8211; 
tory&#44; the law of Moses stands justified before all the 
world&#44; as that which would&#44; if obeyed&#44; contribute 
most to render a people happy and free&#44; enlightened 
and pure&#59; and it therefore claims our regard&#44; and 
challenges our adoption&#44; if even upon grounds of 
reason solely. &#8212; But yet what does meet our view&#63; 
how is the precious gold dimmed too in our day&#33; the 
same folly which our fathers committed is again ours&#59; 
for we wish to follow gentile rites&#44; we are anxious to 
cast oft&#34; the burdens of the law. Look abroad and 
behold how many there are who have thrown aside

the yoke of religion&#44; who love the daughters of the 
stranger&#44; who deny their portion in Israel and Israel&#39;s 
God&#44; who hate their brothers&#44; and will not heed the 
voice of the Mighty One of Jacob &#33; And how many 
are there who are lukewarm&#44; careless about being 
servants in God&#39;s house&#44; who&#44; like their fathers of old&#44; 
know not the Master of the universe&#44; who&#44; wliile they 
partake largely of his bounty&#44; refuse to be guided by 
his counsel &#33; Our fathers&#44; beloved brothers &#33; sinned 
and they are not&#44; and we bear their iniquity to this 
day in our dispersion &#59; because we have not yet re&#8211; 
turned from transgression&#44; nor sought the presence 
of our God with repentance and prayer. But shall 
we thus continue to brave the wrath which perhaps 
even now is gone forth&#63; can we count forever on im&#8211; 
punity&#63; shall our state of present security be never 
disturbed&#63; O let us flee ere the storm bursts in its 
fierceness&#59; let us call to one another to remember our 
accountability&#44; that we are servants of a King whose 
vigilance never sleeps&#44; but whose favour is also in&#8211; 
exhaustible if we perform his will. Each son of Israel 
has received his mission to act rightly himself&#44; and 
to induce many to return from evil unto the fold of 
God. Do we fulfil this duty&#63; are we earnest enough 
in our righteousness&#63; sedulous enough in warning&#63; 
O &#33; it is a fearful thing to see the indiflbrcncc with 
which religion is regarded&#44; the constant endeavour 
to throw it aside as a useless burden &#33; But again and 
again have we felt that under it is our only safety&#44; 
that&#44; though with it we are exposed to the malice of 
others&#44; without it we are sure to perish. And the

even if this be from the young to the old&#44; and the

O Source of eternal life&#44; in whose presence is the 
fulness of holiness &#33; bless us with that grace and the 
consciousness of thy favour&#44; which Thou in days of 
yore didst bestow on those devoted men who walked 
before mankind as a light unto salvation. Thou didst 
then call us thy children&#59; and we then full often ex&#8211; 
perienced thy paternal protection and thy benevolent 
vigilance which guarded us against the arrows of the 
adversaries of thy law. But O&#44; Father&#33; we are now 
severed from our laud&#44; disjointed in many fragments&#44; 
and tlie evil of adverse circumstances lays many a 
hinderiince in our path&#44; on which we struggle to ob&#8211;

O God&#44; who delightest in righteousness&#33; give us un&#8211; 
derstanding to know thy ways&#44; and calm for us the 
waves of the stormy ocean of life&#44; that we may be 
enabled to pursue the even tenor of our way&#44; unawed

Brethren &#33; 

Whatever exists in the world is the gift of God&#59; 
the greatest good ever achieved by mankind&#44; no less 
than the smallest plant which administers to our health 
and gratification&#44; but is derived from Ilim&#44; and Him 
only. Man may invent&#44; contrive&#44; arrange&#44; and im&#8211; 
prove &#59; still the material wherewith to labour&#44; and the 
capacity of the mind which prompts the action&#44; are 
bestowals from the Supreme Source&#44; gifts&#44; in other 
words&#44; granted unto the sons of the earth for their 
use and improvement. To judge then by analogy 
merely&#44; we would arrive at the conclusion that moral 
ideas are also a gift of God&#44; not bestowed for the pur&#8211; 
pose of elevating the thinking and intelligent above

the thoughtless and foolish as superior beings in the 
scale of society&#44; but to conduce to the spiritual im&#8211; 
provement of all&#44; by which means every one capable 
of action may succeed in doing what will cause the 
least possible injury to himself and others&#44; and pro&#8211; 
duce the largest possible amount of general good. 
&#34;What is more&#44; they are as freely given as the air which 
we breathe &#59; they are the equal right of all men&#44; and 
cannot be monopolized by any particular class. They 
are a universal property of which every one may par&#8211; 
take without molestation&#44; and to the progress of which 
each one ought to contribute his share of activity and 
influence. The power to become morally good and 
great is assigned to each individual member of so&#8211; 
ciety&#59; the capacity of mind alone will determine the 
degree of political and social excellence which a 
man can attain &#59; but in morals it requires none of the 
far&#8211;reaching power of intellect&#44; no great depth of 
learning which will place him on a level with the 
exalted of the earth&#44; but only the deep&#8211;seated feeling 
of dependence on the bounty and power of the Su&#8211; 
preme&#44; and the conviction that all acts which a mortal 
performs are within the cognizance of an ever&#8211;watch&#8211; 
ful Providence. We occasionally hear certaui syco&#8211; 
phants&#44; those flatterers of human vanity who bow at 
the shrine of wealth or political prominence&#44; speak 
of the natural mental elevation of the nobly born&#44; as 
though moral excellence&#44; liberality&#44; courage&#44; truth&#8211; 
fulness&#44; and fidelity were by nature the inheritance 
of those nurtured in the lap of luxury or under the 
shadow of power &#59; to them the poor&#44; the humble&#44; who 
are born to toil and reared to labour&#44; are an inferior 
race&#44; with grovelling propensities&#44; with ignoble de&#8211;

sires&#44; with appetites appeasable by gross indulgence 
only&#44; without aspirations for the noble&#44; without desire 
for mental elevation. But are these the character&#8211; 
istics of the poor&#63; Are they indeed ditfcrent in their 
nature from the children of ease and refinement &#63; 
Perhaps they may not be able to express their sym&#8211; 
pathy&#44; their sorrow&#44; their joy in the measured terms 
of a honeyed phraseology&#44; which distinguishes those 
who have been from infancy habituated to an inter&#8211; 
course with the educated and wealthy classes of so&#8211; 
ciety&#59; their mirth may perhaps be noisy&#44; their grief 
loud&#44; their sympathy boisterous&#59; but who can say 
that the feelings wliich ennoble human nature are 
not as sincere with them as with those who are better 
able to restrain all outward expression of them under 
the conventional mantle of outward coldness and 
formality&#63; The simple&#8211;hearted son of the earth is 
struck with external objects as keenly as the pam&#8211; 
pered child of the saloons of fashion &#59; but he does 
not feel that it is requisite for him to smile only in 
the prescribed manner which the rules of etiquette 
demand&#44; or to weep only as loudly as polite ears are 
accustomed to tolerate &#59; but he yields his heart to the 
emotions of the moment&#59; his whole being is pene&#8211; 
trated witli the idea that excites him&#44; and he ex&#8211; 
presses it in the homely style of untutored nature&#44; 
not the less sincere&#44; not the less ardent&#44; because he 
knows little&#44; and values less what others require of 
those who tread a different path of life from what he 
himself is accustomed to. Whatever distinction for&#8211; 
tune&#44; position in society&#44; and education may introduce 
among mankind&#44; however greatly a high state of 
refinement may soften the ills and cares of existence&#44;

they do not authorize us to assume&#44; that a less degree 
of eminence in any of the points enumerated leaves 
the mind less able to acquire moral elevation&#44; or that 
these humble and less favoured ones will commit 
enormities and gross violations of the rules of right&#44; 
any more thau that the possession of wealth&#44; or station&#44; 
or the acquisition of great knowledge&#44; gives the least 
dispensation to permit us to commit those things 
which are condemnable in those less favoured. 

Analogy thus and experience give&#42;us the result of 
a uniform&#44; universal&#44; moral equality of mankind&#44; and 
consequently we must assume an equality in respon&#8211; 
sibility for moral actions&#44; provided only that a re&#8211; 
sponsibility does attach to mortals for their acts and 
omissions. But the very existence of moral feelings&#44; 
and the pleasure experienced in doing something in 
conformity to their impulse&#44; already exhibit both their 
usefulness and necessity &#59; and any disregard of them 
must therefore be in the very nature of things inju&#8211; 
rious to the general welfare&#59; and as the Supreme 
Euler cannot be indifferent to the happiness of his 
creatures&#44; any delinquency in conduct must expose 
us to his displeasure in the precise proportion of the 
injury we have inflicted&#59; and by the same rule&#44; that 
all mankind have an appreciation of moral excellence&#44; 
all must be equally responsible for their conformity 
or non&#8211;conformity with the acts required of them as 
free agents&#44; endowed with the attributes and capaci&#8211; 
ties incident to human nature. 

Now it is not less remarkable than soul&#8211;inspiring 
to the believer in revelation&#44; that precisely these 
views&#44; so reasonable in themselves&#44; are the very doc&#8211; 
trines which the prophets and teachers of Israel have 

12&#42; 

<pb n="138"/>

138 THE WATERS OF LIFE. 

left to the world as the eraauatiou of the divine wis&#8211; 
dom with which they were inspired. There are many 
passages establishing this view of the universality of 
moral perception&#44; and an equality of power in ac&#8211; 
quiring the needful degree of moral excellence. But 
no single text is more emphatic than the one from 
Isaiah Iv. 1 &#58; 

&#34; Ho &#33; every one that thirsteth&#44; come ye to the water&#44; and he that 
hath no money &#59; come ye&#44; buy and eat &#59; yea&#44; come ye&#44; buy without 
money and without price wine and milk.&#34; 

That the prophet speaks of a spiritual food&#44; of a 
spiritual drink&#44; is proved not alone by the invitation 
held out to the needy to purchase without silver or 
gold&#44; but by the context&#59; because he continues&#58; 
&#34; Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not 
bread &#63; and your labour for that which satisfieth not &#63; 
hearken then unto me&#44; and eat ye that which is good&#44; 
and let your soul delight itself in fatness. Incline 
your ear and come unto me &#59; hear and your soul shall 
live&#59; and I will make with you an everlasting cove&#8211; 
nant&#44; the promised mercies of David&#44; which are sure &#33;&#34; 
The holy preacher here expostulates with his hearers&#44; 
iu the name of God&#44; about the vanity of spending all 
for worldly things&#44; of purchasing at an exorbitant 
price the corporeal bread which is not sufficient to 
satisfy the demand of the spirit&#44; and of labouring 
incessantly for the acquisition of those goods which

after all leave a painful void in the thinking soul. 
And &#34;who is there&#44; be he among the noblest&#44; the 
mightiest&#44; or the wisest of the earth&#44; who has not felt 
tired of the enjoyments which he once so ardently 
craved &#63; There is a youth with feelings of ambition &#59; 
he pants for glory&#44; he covets to see his name regis&#8211; 
tered &#94;mong those whose deeds fill the pages of 1ms&#8211; 
tory&#59; and he runs the race of the blood&#8211;stained war&#8211; 
rior&#44; and the wheels of his chariot are soiled with the 
gore of slaughtered enemies&#59; awd now he reposes as 
an aged man upon his dearly&#8211;purchased laurels&#59; with 
many a wound on his brow&#44; with many a scar on his 
worn&#8211;out frame &#58; and think you that he has not toiled 
for what will not satisfy his holy desires &#63; think you 
that he feels the content&#44; the mental repose which he 
rushed after like fleeting phantoms on the field of 
battle &#63; &#33; search not too deeply in his agonized 
heart &#59; there are seated discontent and anguish &#59; for 
he who shed his blood freely in his country&#39;s cause in 
order to acquire a name loathes his own deeds&#44; be&#8211; 
cause of the ingratitude of his countrymen &#59; they as&#8211; 
sign him perhaps the post of honour&#59; still they tlirow 
a doubt over his disinterestedness&#44; and ascribe to him 
motives of self&#8211;aggrandizement&#44; and his success to 
chance&#44; and not to the deep genius which he claims 
for himself&#44; in having snatched the palm of victory 
from opposing hosts&#44; not so much by brute courage 
as by his mental superiority and intellect&#44; which 
secured success by patient thought and ready adapta&#8211; 
tion of occurring circumstances in the hour of trial 
and strife&#44; whilst he disdained to enrich himself with 
the captured treasures of the enemy&#44; and shared the

as coarse and scant as the humblest in the camp. &#8212; 
Or you hiiagine perhaps that he who lias inherited or 
acquired a throne has truly obtained the exalted prize 
of existence&#44; the unfading contentment of the spirit 
wliicli leaves nothing to sigh for on earth. But this 
also is not the case. The highest position does not 
exempt man from care &#59; and the mere possession of 
power exposes one to the same discontents which the 
possession of any other earthly goods engenders&#44; or at 
least not removes&#59; the mind is ever restless and 
active&#59; and even if farther acquisition is not desired 
or impossible&#44; then the very height of the position 
afflicts the spirit with a feeling of vacancy&#44; a want of 
something to acquire&#44; which authorizes us to assert 
that labour herein too has been expended for that 
which satisfies not&#44; and which therefore does not 
render the mind happy. &#8212; But the wise&#44; you may per&#8211; 
haps think&#44; have surely not laboured in vain &#59; they 
have earned for themselves a reputation above that 
of the men of power and strife&#59; their ideas are cast 
abroad on the ocean of thought&#44; they enter freely&#44; 
through the minute subdivision of channels&#44; into the 
palace and the cottage&#59; they are felt in the work&#8211; 
shops and the assembled wisdom of nations&#59; they 
bring consolation to the mourner and amusement to 
the sick suflerer&#59; they entertain childhood and render 
pleasant the declining days of the gray&#8211;haired nuui 
of fourscore years&#44; when his weakened limbs forbid 
his moving abroad&#44; and his hands refuse any longer 
to labour. Most men would think that the reflection 
of having caused so much good must render the men 
of science the happiest of their race&#44; and tliey no 
doubt accuse them of want of gratitude towards the

Deity if they should express aught of discontent with 
their lot. But&#44; alas &#33; mere science&#44; mere knowledge&#44; 
mere wisdom&#44; are powerless of imparting content&#8211; 
ment &#59; they who possess them in the highest degree&#44; 
they whose works are perhaps scattered over town 
and country&#44; palace and cottage&#44; dwell in penury&#44; 
whilst others luxuriate on the proceeds of their days 
of toil and nights of incessant application &#59; or perhaps 
they are ignorant of the very good which they have 
been made instrumental of effecting&#44; since envy and 
malice may have reported to them the evil wdiich is 
spoken concerning them&#44; and carefully concealed all 
the good which mankind express of their benefactors&#44; 
and give no utterance to the blessings which were 
heaped upon the names of those unknown who liave 
beguiled many an hour of pain&#44; or breathed comfort 
through their silent though eloquent pages into the 
spirit of the mourner. &#34;We will not view in this con&#8211; 
nexion tlie uselessness of wealth and the pursuit of 
pleasure&#44; the hollowness of which the commonest 
observation must discover&#59; but we may freely con&#8211; 
tend&#44; that even in the satisfaction obtained from high 
renown&#44; power&#44; and learning&#44; even extended useful&#8211; 
ness which the best of men consider justly their 
greatest earthly acquisition&#44; there is still that want 
of perfect gratification&#44; and that discontent with our 
lot&#44; which must ever leave every human happiness far 
from complete&#44; and cause us to look yet farther for a 
realization of our desires. 

Yes&#44; on earth everything is incomplete&#59; the flower 
only blooms to fade apace&#44; and the sun only shines to 
yield to the envious clouds that speedily envelop his 
face with the mantle of darkness. Virtue itself fails

of reiicliiiig perfection when based solely on linman 
attainments&#44; and wisdom only delights for the moment 
to leave the soul sunk in yet deeper despondeny. 
The youth sighs for the approach of manhood &#59; and 
barely is this attained than he grieves for the days 
of innocence&#44; when all nature was fair to look upon&#44; 
when tears and smiles alternated upon his visage&#44; as 
change the raindrops and the sunshine in the spring&#8211; 
time of the year. Therefore says the prophet &#58; &#34; No 
every one that thirsteth&#44; come ye to the waters&#44; and he 
that hath no silver.&#34; Every human being feels the 
same wound &#59; every one that breathes has a thirst for 
the refreshing stream which&#44; he is sure&#44; flows some&#8211; 
where to gratify his earnest craving. Every one is 
therefore invited to come and seek the fountain&#44; even 
he who is not blessed with silver&#44; with worldly means 
to purchase earthly goods&#59; no one is asked to bring 
power or wisdom to authorize him to join in the com&#8211; 
petition for the precious draught &#59; but the call is gen&#8211; 
eral&#44; for every thirsty one to come to the waters of 
life&#44; not because he can pay for them&#44; only because 
they are ofiered to his acceptance&#59; the Almighty pre&#8211; 
sente them to each one who demands them&#44; and 
whether he have merits or none&#44; whether he be rich 
or poor in deeds or earthly possessions&#44; it matters 
not&#44; provided he come upon the call addressed to 
him&#44; and ask in return for the bread of life which&#44; 
when eaten&#44; never cloys&#44; and he petitions for those 
drinks which never intoxicate&#44; which throw no chains 
around the body&#44; and darken not for a time the light 
of the spirit. It is such bread&#44; such water&#44; such wine 
and milk which mankind are invited to seek and to 
find&#59; and in what do they consist&#63; To which an&#8211;

swers the text&#58; &#34;Incline your ear&#44; and come to me&#59; 
hear and your soul shall live&#44; and I will make with 
you an everlasting covenant.&#34; It is the law of God 
which is to elFect all the remedies for our unhappy 
state &#59; it is this which is to add contentment to the 
enjoyment of all perishable gifts we may have re&#8211; 
ceived&#44; which is to sweeten every bitterness which we 
may have to taste&#44; lighten every burden which rests 
heavily on our shoulders&#44; and assuage every disease 
which may afflict us. For the man who inclines his 
ear to the instruction of God&#44; who only acts in con&#8211; 
formity with the duties which religion teaches him&#44; 
will always regard himself as a child of a universal 
Providence&#44; of an inexhaustible Goodness and pater&#8211; 
nal Care. lie may see his efforts unavailing&#44; he may 
find his hopes deceived and his prosperity turned to 
affliction &#59; but he will nevertheless feel secure of an 
ultimate happy result&#59; because he is convinced&#44; that 
no heavier burden will be laid upon him than he is 
enabled to bear by the strength already inherent in 
him&#44; or which he will receive in the progress of his 
trials. And this is a peculiarity of religious forti&#8211; 
tude&#44; far exceeding that derived from philosophical 
reflections or stoical indifference&#59; in the first of these 
it is at most a submission to an unconquerable neces&#8211; 
sity to which man yields not because he considers it 
best for himself&#44; but only from his inability to resist&#59; 
and in the latter case it is a sort of insensibility to 
outward impressions&#44; a species of a deadness of the nat&#8211; 
ural functions and a stupefaction of the spirit to any 
and every event fvhich may occur. The philosopher 
and stoic may perhaps succeed in resisting the im&#8211; 
pulse of self&#8211;destruction when evils come thick and

fast upon them &#59; but it is most probable&#44; that they 
will hasten away from the scene of action and rush 
unbidden into their Maker&#39;s presence&#44; because they 
will prefer the momentary pain of a dissolution of 
their system&#44; which is at last according to their creed 
the unavoidable fate which is suspended over all man&#8211; 
kind&#44; to the long and weary suffering day by day of 
the wasting hand of disease&#44; of which one sees no 
probable termination short of the grave&#44; the constant 
pressure of poverty which increases sooner than it 
diminishes&#44; the longer one struggles against its fet&#8211; 
ters&#44; or the loss of a reputation unjustly robbed from 
him by the tongue of malevolence and the pestiferous
breath of slander. But let the humble believer find 
himself so situated&#44; he will endeavour to seek&#44; by 
deeply and inly searching himself&#44; whether or not he 
may have incurred guilt through the commission of 
sin or indiscretion&#44; whether accordingly it is not a 
just chastisement he has to bear as a paternal visita&#8211; 
tion from above&#44; that he may be purified from trans&#8211; 
gression. When he discovers his sin&#44; he will accord&#8211; 
ingly endeavour to remodel his life by the standard 
of the law which he has been taught &#59; and in case he 
should be unable to convince himself that his own 
misdeeds have caused his sorrow &#40;but where is the 
man who honestly can say that he has not merited 
punishment&#63;&#41; he will still submit with cheerful meek&#8211; 
ness&#44; and await with patience the time when the hand 
that smites will be transformed into one that heals&#59; 
for he feels convinced that life and death&#44; wounds

cause to the Most High for vindication&#44; sure that ul&#8211; 
timately even so severe a trial will work out its own 
cure and redound to his advantage&#59; and in the last

Physician who&#44; if it meets his blessed pleasure&#44; can and 
will send a cure for his affliction&#44; and render his flesh 
again as healthy as that of an infant&#44; and prolong&#44; if 
so it meets his all&#8211;wise views&#44; the days of his pilgrim&#8211; 
age on earth.&#8212; And with all&#44; though no relief should 
come&#44; though day by day the efforts of enemies should 
more and more prevail&#44; though minute by minute the 
approach of death become more apparent &#58; the ser&#8211; 
vant of God need not quail&#44; and his eye need not 
blanch&#44; though around him is closed out all approach

immortal spirit&#44; wliere poverty and penury are not 
known&#44; where neither ingratitude nor slander embit&#8211; 
ters the days&#44; and where neither sickness nor death 
imirs the sunshine of perennial existence. And then 
he is convinced that it is altogether within his own 
power to become a participant in all this great happi&#8211; 
ness&#44; heaped up in the treasuries of the Lord for his 
servants who have faithfully trusted in Ilim&#44; who

allured to enjoyment&#44; and who walked the path of 
simple faith and pious trust&#44; although the worldlings 
invited to pursue with them the road of pleasure&#44; or 
that of personal aggrandizement and high&#8211;towering 
ambition. 

This then is the meaning of the words &#58; &#34; Hear&#44; 
and your soul shall live&#44;&#34; in a life where happiness is 
perfect&#44; where the incidents attaching themselves to 
the most perfect and exalted state of humanity dis&#8211; 
turb not the inward tranquillity &#59; but where the ab&#8211; 
sence of all distracting agencies leaves the soul free 
to indulge in the everlasting light which springs from 
the presence of the Lord of life. &#34;And I will make 
Avith you an everlasting covenant&#44; the promised mer&#8211; 
cies of David which are sure.&#34; As with the sweet 
singer of Israel a covenant of everlasting kindness 
was made&#44; which covenant will not be broken&#44; al&#8211; 
though for a time strangers occupy his throne&#44; and 
barbarians worship on the site which he appointed 
for the service of his God &#58; so will it be with each 
one whom our Father calls near unto Ilim&#44; because 
that He found him acceptable through his pious deeds. 
Let evil for a time befall him&#44; let terrors unknown to 
the luxurious and happy surround him on all sides &#58; 
he will nevertheless be shielded from destruction &#59; 
the promise of a better future is well secured&#44; and he 
will live to see the pleasures of eternity&#44; and experi&#8211; 
ence to its full extent what constitutes the delights of 
those who have through trials and through shame per&#8211; 
severed in their innocence&#44; and borne the yoke of ad&#8211; 
versity&#44; as becomes those who have lull confidence in 
the word and the mercy of their heavenly Father.

easily deduce its tendency &#58; it is in brief a merciful 
dispensation by which we are to attain that happiness&#44; 
that perfection of felicity not otherwise within our 
reach. And we therefore say with justice that it is a 
gracious gift of God&#44; for wdiich we ought to be thank&#8211; 
ful to a yet greater degree than for mere worldly 
things&#44; and it is therefore no idle phrase when we 
say &#58; &#34; Blessed art Thou O Lord &#33; who givest the law.&#34; 
Dut we ought to feel it deeply&#44; that it is this law alone 
which crowns our life&#44; which opens for us the avenues 
of that blissful state&#44; which is denied unto us when we 
only follow our inclinations&#44; and seek not to know 
the ways of the Lord. And then the prophet invites 
all to come to the water. And why does he compare 
the religion of Heaven to water&#63; Because this ele&#8211; 
ment so necessary to animal life is universally diffused 
in every place fitted for human habitation&#44; and its ne&#8211; 
cessity is therefore not greater than its universality. 
It is found in the mountains and in the plains&#59; and to 
have it always in requisite plenty&#44; the rains of heaven 
descend and replenish the pools and the springs&#44; and 
these carry their superabundance into the reservoirs 
appointed for them&#44; the lakes and rivers. Even so is 
the law of God&#44; it has been given to us for our guide&#44; 
in a language rendering it intelligible to all who come 
under its rule &#59; and to insure its permanence God ever 
raises up those who are endowed with intelligence&#44; 
that they may go forth among the sons of man&#44; and 
scatter abroad the knowledge which they have re&#8211; 
ceived &#58; so that from all hearts there may flow a trib&#8211; 
ute of submission to the will of the universal Father&#44; 
by which all may become worthy of his mercy and 
love. It is only owing to the unwillingness of sinful

men that they are not taught what is demanded of 
them&#59; they do not wish to live&#44; and hence they seek 
the roads which end in death and perdition. &#8212; But let 
us not lose our firm trust in the ultimate triumph of 
holiness&#59; the struggle may be prolonged to a time of 
which we can form no adequate idea&#59; still the pre&#8211; 
dicted event will surely come to pass&#59; and then right&#8211; 
eousness will have fought its last contest&#44; and the fear 
of God will be as universally diffused&#44; as are now the 
elements which sustain our animal life. The sufier&#8211; 
ings of the servants of God will be changed into bless&#8211; 
ings&#44; and their mourning into heartfelt rejoicing&#59; in 
those times the wolf and the sheep will lie down to&#8211; 
gether&#44; and on all the earth there will be peace and 
harmony&#44; and in the seat of justice there shall be 
truth&#44; and the humble shall not call in vain upon the 
man of power. For the anointed of the Lord will 
reign&#44; and he will&#44; under the providence of Him who 
wull send him&#44; &#34; decide in equity for the meek of the 
earth&#44;&#34; and promote peace and good&#8211;will among all 
nations. Amen.

ISRAEL&#39;S RELATION TO GOD. 

Guardian of man &#33; be nigli unto us in our afflic&#8211; 
tions&#44; and hear our voice whenever we call on Thee 
in our time of need&#59; for we are powerless on the day 
of our glory&#44; and helpless dependants in the midst 
of our deeds of might&#59; and whence shall come our 
help&#44; when the clouds of adversity lower over our 
seeming security&#63; whence our aid when the storm 
bursts in its fury and terror&#63; But Thou&#44; O our 
Father &#33; art our stay&#44; our strong support in the hour 
of sorrow&#44; and from thy right hand comes to us en&#8211; 
largement&#44; and from thy spirit is breathed unto us 
consolation. come&#44; then&#44; and be with us at all 
hours of our existence&#59; come and dwell in the midst 
of the assemblies of thy worshippers &#59; that they may 
daily and hourly enjoy thy mercy&#44; and be adjudged 
worthy of thy unbounded favour&#44; which is held as a 
shield over the whole structure of the universe which 
thy greatness has called forth. &#8212; Do this&#44; God of

wiliest the salvation of mankind through faith and

Brethren &#33; 

In the section of the law appomted to be read this 
day&#44; we meet with the reciprocal relation of God to 
Israel clearly defined by the great prophet just before

his withdrawal to a better life&#44; at the moment when 
lie was anxious for the welfare of the people whom 
he had led so long&#44; and Avhen the blessed Lord per&#8211; 
mitted him to see&#44; if any thing more clearly than 
ever before&#44; what was to Ijappen hereafter&#44; and gave 
him the power of condensing volumes of thoughts in 
few but comprehensive words&#58; so that they might be 
remembered as memorials to everlasting&#44; and readily 
treasured up in the minds and recollections of ordi&#8211; 
nary men. We will recite the whole passage&#44; since we 
cannot lose one word of it without missing a portion 
of the instruction it conveys and the hopes which it 
inspires. I refer to the four verses&#44; from the IGtli to 
the 19th verse of the twenty&#8211;sixth chapter of Deuter&#8211; 
onomy. &#34; This day the Lord thy God commandeth 
thee to do these statutes and ordinances&#59; and thou 
shalt keep and do them with all thy heart&#44; and with 
all thy soul. Thou hast this day acknowledged that 
the Lord is thy God&#44; and that thou wilt walk in his 
ways and keep his statutes&#44; and his commandments&#44; 
and his ordinances&#44; and hearken unto his voice. And 
the Lord hath acknowledged thee this day to be unto 
Him a peculiar people&#44; as He hath spoken unto thee&#44; 
and that thou shouldst keep all his commandments.&#34; 

&#34; That He may set thee higli above all tlie nations tiiat He hath 
made&#44; in praise&#44; in name&#44; and in honour &#59; and that thou mayost be

We hav&#94;e been often invited and solicited by many 
who feci truly friendly to us among the gentiles&#44; by 
men and women who sincerely profess to believe in 
revelation&#44; to forsake our religion&#44; and to embrace 
whatever system or ideas of belief they&#44; our not&#8211; 
Jewish friends&#44; may believe as the truth. We do not 
impugn the honesty of such zealots&#59; we will give 
them full credit to be sincerely anxious for our salva&#8211; 
tion&#59; but we must say that they have studied Scrip&#8211; 
tures to but small advantage&#44; if they can imagine 
that we could forsake our connexion with ancient 
Israel&#44; and still claim to act in obedience to the will 
of God&#44; as they do who&#44; whilst the&#59;y have adopted a 
belief unknown to our ancestors&#44; claim nevertheless 
to be the true spiritual Israel&#44; not&#44; it is true&#44; the real 
Israel descended from Jacob&#44; but one selected&#44; it is 
averred&#44; and made thus through grace&#44; when the 
children of the patriarchs lost their election through 
rejecting the messenger of new things who had come 
among them&#44; and of whom they knew nothing&#44; nor 
viewed him otherwise than as an ordinary man from 
among themselves. The Israelites have grievously 
sinned&#59; they often incurred&#44; and to this day incur&#44; 
the displeasure of the Most High for their rebellion 
and backsliding&#59; but if their sins had only been like 
the one which we have just mentioned&#44; then would 
the wrath of God never have been kindled aerainst us 
and against our land &#59; for then we should have basked 
in the sunshine of divine favour&#44; and through the 
mouth of messengers of Heaven we should have been 
notified&#44; that our heart had been purified and our 
deeds accepted from on High. &#8212; To little purpose in&#8211; 
deed must the Bible have been studied&#44; if the main&#8211;

152 ISRAEL&#39;S RELATION TO GOD. 

tenance of our faith can be justly charged unto us as 
a crime&#59; and little conception can men have of the 
justice of God&#44; if they do invest the One who never 
changes with the fallible attributes of human imper&#8211; 
fection&#44; by saying that He selected a people for his 
worship&#44; and then cast them off utterly&#44; because an&#8211; 
other nation had to be chosen&#44; the others failing to 
accomplish their mission. And little faith can that 
Israelite have&#44; who&#44; listening to such vain aypeals&#44; 
imagines himself absolved from his allegiance&#44; and 
joins&#44; thus induced&#44; the multitudes of the earth&#44; who 
are not of Jacob&#39;s seed&#44; in their newly invented rites&#44; 
and believes with them in a god wdio cannot save. 

Let us take up our text and see what God demands 
of us&#44; and in what respects we are with Him in a 
covenant of everlasting duty and love&#58; it is simply 
duty that is demanded from us to Him&#44; and we are 
promised love from Him&#44; the most Holy&#44; to us&#44; chil&#8211; 
dren of a day&#44; creature of the earth&#44; whose body will 
be necessarily given to corruption&#44; and whose spirit 
is fleeting&#44; anxious to return to the home whence it 
came&#44; that it may hie away and be at rest. &#8212; Fii&#8211;st&#44; 
the prophet says &#58; &#34; This day the Lord thy God com&#8211; 
mandeth thee to do these statutes and ordinances.&#34; 
i&#33;&#94;ow the commonest understanding&#44; the merest child&#44; 
must naturally ask&#44; &#34;What laws are here meant&#63; &#8212; 
where are we to look for them &#63; were they known to 
the persons to whom Moses spoke&#63; were they familiar 
tilings to which he could refer&#63; were they written 
down in his day&#63; or were they something future&#44; 
which was to be developed in after&#8211;centuries&#44; of 
which he himself had no knowledge&#44; the details of 
which were unknown to his hearers&#63;&#34; These are 

<pb n="153"/>

Israel&#39;s relation to god. 153 

simple questions&#44; and demand an answer as simple as 
tbemselves &#59; for it is to the general mass the prophet 
spoke&#44; or rather speaks at this day&#44; because the very 
words which were addressed to our tathcrs&#44; appeal to 
us at this very hour in all their force and cogency. 
Moses&#44; then&#44; to give the simple answer which was 
then and is now needed&#44; referred not to things future 
aud unknown&#44; but to laws and institutions which 
were then and there revealed &#59; &#34; this day the Lord thy 
God commandeth thee&#44;&#34; not in days past&#44; not in days 
to come&#44; the first of which might have been forgot&#8211; 
ten&#44; the second of which could not then be known&#44; 
but those ideas&#44; those precepts&#44; those commands and 
duties&#44; the knowledge of which was then just im&#8211; 
parted&#44; in the reception of which they were them&#8211; 
selves the receivers&#44; and in imparting which he was 
himself the teacher. Hence&#44; whatever was mani&#8211; 
fested through Aloses to the people of his day&#44; is the 
subject of obedience here demanded&#59; for we are told 
to keep and do them with all our heart and all our 
soul. But the word &#34;keep&#34; has also the significa&#8211; 
tion of&#34; watching over&#59;&#34; &#34; guarding against encroach&#8211; 
ments &#59; &#34; &#34; defending against attacks&#59; &#34; or else it would 
have been enough to say&#44; &#34; and thou shalt do them with 
all thy heart and with all thy soul.&#34; Yet we see that 
this is not enough&#59; the laws must bo kept&#44; watched 
over&#44; guarded&#44; defended with intense interest and 
perseverance&#59; the future can only be hoped for&#44; not 
so watched over&#59; it may be confided in&#44; but never 
kept and observed &#59; for it is not present&#44; and there&#8211; 
fore escapes for the moment from our power of action.

declared to us&#59; but at the present moment we cannot 
watch over its preservation&#59; this can only be predi&#8211; 
cated of things now present&#44; already placed within the 
range of our control. So then we are commanded to 
guard the commandments. Against what &#63; Against

attachment for them&#44; against every adversary who 
may endeavour to rob us of their precious privileges. 
They were placed in our custody&#44; they are our in&#8211; 
heritance now&#44; our treasure transmitted to us by our 
living Father &#59; and we are told that we ought to pre&#8211; 
serve them&#44; because He has conferred them on us&#44; 
and we are to fulfil all they demand&#44; inasmuch as 
they are necessary to our happiness. For these are 
the words&#58; &#34;Thou hast this day acknowledged that 
the Lord is thy God&#59; and the Lord hath acknowl&#8211; 
edged thee this day to be unto him a peculiar people&#44; 
as He hath spoken.&#34; But how is this to be accom&#8211; 
plished&#63; Simply by obedience&#59; because in accept&#8211; 
ing the Lord as our God&#44; and in becoming his people&#44; 
we pledged ourselves that we would walk in his ways&#44; 
keep his statutes&#44; his commaudments&#44; and his ordi&#8211; 
nances&#44; and hearken to his voice. We reserved nothing to ourselves short of a full compliance with his 
demands on our will&#59; He is the Eternal One whom 
we chose from all imaginable divinities as our adored 
God&#59; there were the gods of Egypt&#44; of Persia&#44; of the 
Zabeans&#44; and the children of the East&#44; all of which 
had followers far more numerous than the Hebrews 
ever have been from their very institution to this 
very hour &#59; yet&#44; we the fewest of nations had rejected 
by our willing acceptance of Moses&#39;s message&#44; saying 
that we would do all that the Lord might say&#44; all as&#8211;

sociation in the godhead&#44; and we claimed as our wor&#8211; 
shipful king the sole Power who can say&#44; &#34; I will be&#44;&#34; 
to whom there is no seco&#94;id in descent&#44; no associate in 
might and goodness&#59; and because we confided in 
Ilini&#44; since we had felt the extent of his greatness 
and invincible strength&#44; we submitted to be taught by 
his wisdom&#44; and to observe faithfully&#44; and to &#34;keep&#34; 
his ordinances. In recompense He promised us&#44; in 
the words of our text&#44; that we should be his peculiar 
people&#59; separated through this means from the errors 
of gentiles&#44; and be placed high in the rank of nations&#44; 
and excel all mankind in praise&#44; in name&#44; and in 
honour&#44; and that we should be a holy people&#44; unto 
Him the Lord&#44; as He had spoken. Spoken when &#63; 
and to whom&#63; Even to Abraham&#44; when he said to 
him&#44; &#34; Walk before me and be perfect&#59;&#34; when He 
promised him a son by his wife Sarah&#59; when He 
promised to establish his covenant with Isaac&#59; when 
He commanded him to become circumcised in the 
flesh in obedience to the divine mandate&#59; yes it was 
then that the Lord spoke of his covenant of everlast&#8211; 
ing protection to Abraham and to his descendants&#44; 
but always through the same means as in our text&#44; 
that is to say&#44; through obedience to whatever the Lord 
might teach. 

Now it was through Moses that the promise to 
Abraham was so far accomplished&#44; that the sons of 
Jacob received a consistent code of religious&#44; moral&#44; 
and civil laws&#44; by which they were enabled to pursue 
the course pleasing to God&#44; or&#44; to use the words of 
Scripture&#44; &#34; to walk in his ways.&#34; The uncertainty&#44; 
if there ever was any&#44; arising from an unwritten law 
&#40;though we may assume that the most necessary duties

were already revealed in the earliest stages of the 
world&#41;&#44; was theu and there removed&#44; and a clear def&#8211; 
inition of the path of salvation given to the people at 
large&#44; not to the learned and intelligent only&#44; but to 
the simple and untutored also&#44; to which fact your atten&#8211; 
tion has been called before. God was acknowledged 
universally among Israel&#44; and his ways were univer&#8211; 
sally revealed among the same people. It required 
then&#44; it requires now&#44; no comment&#44; to understand in 
the main the precept&#44; &#34; Remember the Sabbath to 
keep it holy&#59;&#39;&#34;&#39; and if there were&#44; the exposition was 
given at once &#58; &#34; Six days mayest thou labour&#44; but 
the seventh day is a rest in honour of the Lord thy 
God&#44; then shalt thou do iio manner of work&#59;&#34; the 
command is sufficiently comprehensive&#44; forbidding 
every exertion which resembles labour&#44; and thus ex&#8211; 
cepts nothing as permitted on that day. So also 
&#34;Honour thy father and thy mother&#59;&#34; whoever has 
parents&#44; whoever had parents&#44; and this includes the 
whole human race&#44; is bound to treat those with re&#8211; 
spect who are his earthly progenitors&#44; when living&#44; 
and not to malign their memory&#44; when dead. But 
equally clear is the prohibition&#44; &#34; Thou shalt have 
no other gods before me.&#34; The presence of God is 
everywhere&#44; his existence is through all time &#59; He an&#8211; 
nounced himself to us as the Eternal One who had re&#8211; 
deemed us&#59; and as we have always existed since then&#44; 
the same reason is still applicable to us &#59; and through 
all the ages of our being the same appeal is addressed 
to all who come under the guidance of the law&#44; to 
acknowdedge no other divinity than the One whom 
we always adored as our Redeemer. The revelation 
was intended as a plain exponent of opinions and du&#8211;

ties&#44; or rather of duties founded on opinions&#59; and 
as each Israelite was a descendant of Abraham&#44; or 
one adopted into the covenant among his children&#44; all 
were bound to accept and did receive a clear knowl&#8211; 
edge of their position to God and of their obligation 
to Him through their membership in Israel. And it 
is precisely this pre&#8211;eminence which constitutes our 
praise&#44; our name&#44; and our honour &#59; it is not any worldly 
advantage&#44; not any high rank in civilization and re&#8211; 
finement&#44; though these are not incompatible with it&#44; 
which is promised&#44; but simply a superior knowledge 
of wdiat is due from man to his Maker&#44; by which 
blessings both temporal and spiritual will be called 
down to invigorate those who trust in the Lord. 
Hence arises the beautiful custom which is so pecu&#8211; 
liarly Jewish of reading the law every Sabbath and 
other times in the midst of our assemblies&#59; we re&#8211; 
quire but little preaching to expound the way of life&#44; 
provided only all our brothers have learned what God 
ordains &#59; and therefore the annual repetition of the 
whole Mosaic dispensation is the very means of ren&#8211; 
dering it familiar to all Israelites. If men will but 
take up once a week the written word of the Lord&#44; 
in the language which they comprehend&#44; but best of 
all if they can read it in the Hebrew understandingly 
and with pleasure &#58; they will acquire an immense 
fund of knowledge&#44; of the extent of which they can 
form no conception beforehand&#44; and they will be 
armed with a safeguard against every attack which 
human weakness is liable to during our life on earth. 
Talk of the consolations of philosophy &#59; speak of com&#8211; 
fort through a mediator &#59; but what are they compared 
to the knowledge that all proceeds from the great

Source&#44; whose are counsel and wisdom&#44; who is the 
essence of truth and goodness &#63; And then lie is not 
the inexorable master&#44; who punishes because He feels 
a delight in suffering&#59; he is not surrounded by in&#8211; 
evitable circumstances or necessity which prevent 
Ilim from exercising his will &#59; He is not circumscribed 
in mercy&#44; so that his wrath should burn forever&#44; and 
He not be able to pardon &#59; but on the contrary. He 
is lonely&#8211;suffering and waits constantly&#44; perchance man 
may repent and rend thus asunder the decree of evil 
which is impending over him&#59; and then all the pun&#8211; 
ishments are represented to us as means leading at 
length to an amelioration of the heart&#44; and conse&#8211; 
quently to the ultimate happiness of the sufferer him&#8211; 
self&#44; provided he will apply for healing from the great 
Physician&#44; so that mercy&#44; forgiveness and health may 
be granted to him&#44; because of his faith and hope. 

But to maintain ourselves in the path of the re&#8211; 
ligion of Moses&#44; to be faithful to the observance of 
the precepts&#44; to be distinguished above the nations 
in the praise&#44; name and honour of God&#39;s chosen race&#44; 
we must needs maintain the distinctive character 
which has been ours for so many centuries. It is 
futile to assert that other nations serve the Lord as 
well as we&#59; nay admit that they are more pious&#44; 
more devoted&#44; more enthusiastic in all that elevates 
man to God&#59; grant that we are punished for our 
transgressions&#44; so often repeated that in mercy we 
were expelled from our ancient patrimony &#58; all this 
only says&#44; that we are unworthy despite of our supe&#8211; 
rior knowledge. But can any wrong be the excuse 
for one yet greater&#63; can we pretend to say&#44; that 
since we were expelled from Palestine because we dis&#8211;

Israel&#39;s relation to god. 159 

obeyed the will of God&#44; we are to place ourselves 
beyond the possibility of obeying our religion at all &#63; 
This would be a foolish proceeding&#44; one becoming only 
those who had lost all faith in God&#44; all hope of the 
accomplishment of his merciful promises. And say&#44; 
what have the systems of gentiles to offer to us which 
is so valuable and holy &#63; in what is their hope in God 
greater&#63; in what respect are their morals better&#63; by 
what right do they claim more than we a portion in 
life everlasting&#63; But on the contrary they all preach 
up an exemption from the duties of our law&#59; they 
absolv&#94;e themselves from the rest of the Sabbath&#59; 
they permit the &#34; flesh of the swine&#44; and the creeping 
thing and the mouse&#59;&#34; they regard as nothing the 
eating of the bread of affliction on the festival of our 
redemption &#59; nay they abrogate circumcision&#44; the ever&#8211; 
lasting covenant with Abraham and his children &#59; but 
to crown all&#44; they pray through a mediator&#44; as one 
having alone power with God &#58; when lie emphatically 
declared to us that his law was everlasting&#59; that his 
covenant should never be moved&#44; that his glory He 
would give to no one else&#44; that He the Only One is 
the Redeemer of Israel&#44; that we should call on Him 
whenever we needed aid and consolation&#44; and that 
lie would be near to listen unto all who invoke Him 
in truth. On the score of expediency therefore there 
is no reason why we should embrace the system of 
the gentiles&#59; since&#44; all things considered&#44; there is as 
much in our favour&#44; Jews as we are&#44; as we could ob&#8211; 
tain by any change&#44; or which a union with them would 
afford us. But there is a positive advantage in our 
adherence to our faith &#58; it has a superiority over all 
others &#59; it is truth without disguise&#44; belief founded on 

<pb n="160"/>

160 Israel&#39;s relation to god. 

reason&#44; and enables all men to be equal in the knowl&#8211; 
edge of that which is the most essential for them to 
know&#59; and then thereisthe great uniformity of opinion 
which is inseparable from Judaism. For though we 
have also in the process of evil times become disunited 
on questions of policy or limitations of the command&#8211; 
ments of the law&#44; no one has yet arisen to gainsay 
the principles of our faith&#44; or to abrogate any of tlie 
chief distinguishing features of our religion &#59; for those 
who act so are at once denounced as having placed 
themselves beyond the pale of Judaism&#44; and are&#44; like 
other apostates&#44; traitors against their allegiance to 
Heaven. But it may be said with truth&#44; that Judaism 
has maintained a singular uniformity of character 
since its first institution &#59; there has been no violent 
change in its observances from the commencement&#44; 
and not the least abatement in its acknowledo&#8211;meut 
of the unity of the Godhead and the eternity of his 
rule and providence. It is to this character of our 
belief&#44; this uniformity in its practice&#44; this univer&#8211; 
sality of the knowledge thereof which distinguishes 
Israel&#44; that we may point as a triumpliant vindication 
of our adherence to the same. The ISTazarene system 
and Mahomedanism have assumed raanifohl phases&#44; 
especially the former&#59; observance&#44; and creed&#44; and 
belief have been attempted to be fixed by the dicta 
of councils&#44; conventions&#44; assemblies&#44; debates&#44; and cor&#8211; 
respondence &#59; but what has everything availed &#63; The 
ditfercnccs remain irreconcilable&#59; and persecution 
has not even reached an approach to produce uni&#8211; 
formity&#59; whereas wc have kept united for all prac&#8211; 
tical purposes without even an understanding among 
our leading men &#59; every one has been at liberty to 

<pb n="161"/>

Israel&#39;s relation to god. 161 

elucidate the Bible&#44; to ofter his opinions and viewa &#59; 
and still there is a oneness of hope&#44; a singleness of 
faith which may well astonish the world &#59; and all is 
owing to the simplicity of the words of revelation 
which are as accessible to one as to the other. 

Baton the score of necessity&#44; too&#44; we cannot swerve. 
Our God has given us his law&#59; He has appointed us 
its guardians&#59; we are&#44; as our text says&#44; &#34; to keep and 
to do it.&#34; Can we escape his vigilance&#63; can our 
leaving his standard screen us from his cognizance&#63; 
How do we know what evil we may entail upon us
and our children if we forsake Him&#44; the Lord &#63; how 
do we know what torment may be in store for us&#44; if 
we cease to call ourselves by the noble name through 
which Jacob was marked as a chief beloved by God&#63; 
And then it will not avail us aught to say that&#44; by 
changing our religion&#44; we only fulfil the ultimate in&#8211; 
tention of the prophecies which have been announced 
concerning us. This is a mere fiction&#44; of which not 
a trace can be found in Scripture&#44; and you may freely 
challenge your gentile friends who ask you to join 
them&#44; for a shadow of a proof to be found throughout 
the whole Bible. On the contrary&#44; we are admonished 
to observe the law which Moses laid before the people 
of Israel&#44; and this includes circumcision&#44; the Sabbath&#44; 
the Passover&#44; the Day of Atonement&#44; the Shophar&#44; the 
Tabernacles Feast with its attendant ceremonies&#44; the 
Jewish household&#44; the prohibitions of mixtures in our 
garments&#44; fields and vineyards&#44; the worship of the sole 
God to the exclusion of aught else &#58; and then tell us&#44; 
how we are to do all this&#44; if we are no longer of the 
faith of Israel&#44; and adhere outwardly to a system the 
reverse of all this. Let nations&#44; who are not believers&#44;

plume themselves hi a name which they Viave derived 
from us &#59; let them vauut in the appellation of the spir&#8211; 
itual Israel &#59; but tell them that they are not thereby 
elevated to that position by which they could claim 
our alliance. &#8212; Let them say that we have been driven 
out before the enemy from our lovely heritage&#44; be&#8211; 
cause we rejected the new covenant which they allege 
was sent to us first through a messenger whom we 
refused to listen to&#44; since we believed him not inspired 
of the Lord &#59; but again tell them&#44; our transgressions&#44; 
for which this evil befell us&#44; were of another kind&#44; 
and that long since&#44; before the advent of that rei&#41;uted 
prophet and his later imitators&#44; Moses had predicted 
what would come over us if we did not remain faith&#8211; 
ful to the law and the testimony. Still in these very 
curses then pronounced is foreshadowed that they 
should not crush us &#59; but that&#44; spite of all the anguish 
they caused&#44; we should nevertheless remain the peo&#8211; 
ple chosen from all others as the hearers of God&#39;s 
holy ark&#44; the depositary of his blessed laws. And 
has this been accomplished or not &#63; Let those speak 
who esteem us lightly &#59; let those speak who call on 
us to forsake the Lord and his word. But as for our&#8211; 
selves&#44; so speak ye&#44; brothers and sisters of Israel &#33; we 
have received our mission to be and to remain a light 
to the world &#59; and with the word of God which is ours 
will we travel boldly through life&#44; rel&#94;&#8211;ing on his 
mercy and truth&#44; that He will not fail us in the time 
of need. For thus said He through his prophet 
Isaiah &#40;lix. 21&#41; &#58; &#34; As for me&#44; this is my covenant with 
them&#44; saith the Lord&#44; My spirit that is upon thee&#44; and 
my words wliich I have put in thy mouth&#44; shall not 
dart out of thy mouth&#44; nor out of the mouth of thy

seed&#44; nor out of the mouth of thy seed&#39;s seed&#44; saith 
the Lord&#44; henceforth and forever&#44;&#34; And may for this 
grace his Kame be blessed in the mouth of all liesh 
from eternity to eternity. Amen.

DISCOURSE XII. 

GOD&#39;S HERITAGE.&#42; 

Brethren &#33; 

You stand here this day before the Lord your God&#44; 
with your wives and children to devote this building 
to the service of the Redeemer of Israel&#44; the Holy 
One of Jacob. It is well therefore that you and we&#44; 
who are with you on this solemn occasion&#44; should re&#8211; 
flect upon what has been done this day&#44; and to take 
due care that the impression may not be speedily re&#8211; 
moved. The Scriptures&#44; beloved friends&#44; have ever 
served for many centuries as the groundwork on 
which to base reflection and doctrine &#58; let us then 
proceed in the same manner to select a text for the 
elucidation of our thoughts at this moment&#44; when 
you are yet full of joy at having at length found a 
suitable place wherein to worship the God of your 
fathers. 

Moses had for forty years laboured for and suftered

througli the people of Israel &#59; he had seen their back&#8211; 
slidings&#44; heard their murmurings&#44; and been affected 
to the depth of his soul by their transgressions against 
their eternal Benefactor. In vain had he asked to be 
continued among them&#44; merely to see the land be&#8211; 
yond Jordan &#59; he had offended&#44; overcome by their 
rebellion&#44; and he was to mingle his bones within the 
plaiiis of Moab with the clod of the valley&#44; and the 
frame which encircled erst the holy spirit&#44; the purest 
and best that ever appeared among men&#44; was to be 
hidden from the view of the thousands who had so 
long beheld their venerable teacher in the front ranks 
of their marching hosts. If ever&#44; therefore&#44; a mortal 
had cause to detest his countrymen&#44; it was surely 
Moses at that moment&#44; when through them his dear&#8211; 
est hopes had been annihilated. But not so acted 
our teacher&#59; he rose above all cares&#44; foibles&#44; and 
thoughts of earth&#44; and surveyed the past and future 
with that prophetic eye&#44; vouchsafed to him alone&#44; 
which is not deceived by the events of the days which 
are gone&#44; nor uncertain of the occurrences of those 
which are to follow. And it was then that&#44; notwith&#8211; 
standing the many faults which he censured in our 
people&#44; he exclaimed&#44; in the conviction of its being 
the pure truth &#58; 

&#34; For the portion of the Lord is his people&#59; Jacob is the lot of 
his inheritance.&#34; Deut. xxxii. 9. 

Moses had in the preceding verses described the 
great care the Lord had taken of the sons of Israel&#44; 
though they were a perverse and rebellious genera&#8211;

tion &#59; and then he accounts for tliis goodness so un&#8211; 
merited on their part by the reason assigned&#44; that 
the portion of the Lord among the children of the 
earth is the people whom he was then addressing&#44; 
and that Jacob is the lot which He has chosen above 
all tlie other inhabitants of the earth&#44; a nation to 
whom lie had manifested his greatness&#44; to whom He 
had given a law of statutes and ordinances&#44; and to 
whom He would keep his truth&#44; as sure as He is the 
d&#39;d&#39;&#63;&#33;&#59;&#59; &#39;n the One who lives forever. And you&#44; breth&#8211; 
ren&#44; have arisen in the strength of faith and dedicated 
this house to the God whose lot of inheritance you 
are &#59; heirs of the law of Moses&#44; you have declared 
that you will adhere to it in its details and doctrines &#59; 
you have exclaimed the words of your faith with holy 
fervour&#44; and the words&#39; ha&#94;y j&#8211;&#39;oty yet ring in our ears 
as they ascended on High to proclaim that you are yet 
true to the creed that was established in days of old&#44; 
when the world was yet in its infancy&#44; and mankind 
not yet enlightened in the paths of truth&#44; and that 
you are not tired of the appellation of Israelites&#44; but 
wish to preserve your race and its peculiar institu&#8211; 
tions&#44; as far as in you lies&#44; to the utmost age of the 
world. Do I interpret aright your hopes &#63; your de&#8211; 
sires &#63; your positive determination &#63; I cannot be mis&#8211; 
taken &#59; it is the character of the remnant of Israel&#44; it 
is the spirit which Moses foresaw would animate us&#44; 
when he predicted that his song would never be for&#8211; 
gotten from the mouth of the remotest descendants 
of Jacob. You are then here to declare your alle&#8211; 
giance to your God&#44; to devote yourselves to his ser&#8211; 
vice &#59; and take you good heed that you fail not in 
your duty&#44; that you do not pretermit anything which

can prove you to be a portion of God&#39;s people&#44; his 
inheritance on earth. 

But&#44; beloved friends &#33; we have lived to see a great 
change developing itself in our communities&#59; ancient 
rites and usages have been violently attacked&#44; or 
thrown aside as useless&#44; and the conservators of the 
law have turned against it as its most violent enemies. 
Strife and disunion have shown themselves in many 
congregations&#44; and the peace and concord&#44; the con&#8211; 
formity to our rules and the pious observances &#40;5f our 
forefathers have in many places fallen into a lament&#8211; 
able decay. Impiety even has assumed the garb of 
holiness&#44; and professes that all its deeds of horror 
have a pious object&#44; to preserve our faith through its 
destruction. Perhaps you may think the present mo&#8211; 
ment totally unsuited to such a discussion &#59; you come 
hither to consecrate a house of God&#44; and only words 
of joy should be heard&#44; only messages of peace should 
be spoken. But yet&#44; brethren&#44; I speak of joy&#44; though 
I allude to occurrences which are painful and morti&#8211; 
fying &#59; I utter words of peace&#44; though I call upon you 
to buckle on the bright and burnished and well&#8211;tried 
armour of religion to do battle&#44; bravely&#44; in the holy 
fight for our God and his sanctuaries. There is a 
purity in our law&#44; which it behoves us to feel &#59; there 
is a peace which it imparts&#44; which we ought to ren&#8211; 
der our own portion. It is therefore I tell you of the 
dangers which you run in your intercourse with the 
world&#44; and speak to you of enemies that assail your 
immortal hopes&#44; though they come to you as friends 
of human rights&#44; as the defenders of human reason. 
And it is by flattering human weakness&#59; by railing 
against antiquated prejudices&#59; by attacking all that 

<pb n="167"/>

has come down from ages long past&#44; that they en&#8211; 
deavour to win followers&#44; to acquire imitators&#59; and 
could they succeed&#44; which&#44; God be praised&#44; they can&#8211; 
not&#33; there would soon he no synagogue wherein a 
Jew could worship&#44; there would be no congregation 
which a Jew could join&#44; there would be no deed of 
piety which he could perform in the community of 
the faithful&#59; and soon the sun of righteousness would 
set forever&#44; and the baleful sway of human passion&#44; 
the unbridled impulses of human reason would speed&#8211; 
ily cover the earth with deeds of horror as with a 
deadly pall&#44; and justice would flee affrighted to hap&#8211; 
pier realms&#44; and the earth would be rendered corrupt 
and ripe for destruction before the Merciful One who 
reigns in heaven. And do you remember the object 
for which this house was built at first &#63; do you recall 
to mind the assemblies that were held here &#63; have 
you forgotten the man who deified human reason 
within these walls &#63; I blush to say that Israelites by 
name&#44; and&#44; I hope by feeling&#44; were among those who 
laid the foundations of this house when its uses were 
so unhallowed&#44; and I regret that week after week&#44; on 
a day not known to our religion&#44; there came hither 
men and women who are Jews by blood to listen to 
the rhapsodies of one who&#44; whilst declaiming against 
the creed of the Nazarenes&#44; among whom we live&#44; 
levelled the arrows of his satire and unsound argu&#8211; 
mentation also against the ever&#8211;blessed Law&#42; promul&#8211; 

&#42; Tho present Synagogue Eodef Sholem was originally built for 
the use of iifree congregation. The notice in the text is sufficiently

gated at Sinai. I will do them the justice to believe 
that they may have thought that arguments&#44; strong 
and unanswerable against the dogmas of the prevail&#8211; 
ing religion of the country&#44; would tend as a defence 
of Judaism &#59; but Israelites ought never to forget that 
they cannot be religious by denying what othei&#42;s hold 
sacred&#44; but by being positively impressed with the 
truth of their own received doctrines&#44; and by follow&#8211; 
ing up faithfully the duties which they are certified 
are demanded of them. Consequently there is the 
greatest danger to be dreaded from a constant listen&#8211; 
ing to opinions&#44; especially if they are enforced by the 
charms of eloquence&#44; and a sort of special pleading 
which appeals to the innate strength of human reason&#44; 
which opinions are in substance that man needs no 
guide except what is implanted in his own bosom &#59; 
that all received views are merely the inventions of 
bygone days&#44; and of no use or necessity for men of 
the present enlightened century. There is in truth 
not much danger that Israelites would ever adopt the 
Nazarene or Mahomedan doctrines from conviction&#44; 
though I would not dispute that there may be some 
Jews who accept these or any other ideas&#44; however 
absurd&#44; because their mind may have received a bent 
in a direction not easily accounted for&#59; but as a gen&#8211; 
eral truth&#44; we may state that Jews are not likely to 
be converted to religions other than their own. The 
case however is more serious with respect to indiffer&#8211; 
ence to all religions. Man is but too apt to overvalue 
the small portion of intellect which the Lord has as&#8211; 
signed to him&#59; he is only too prone to vaunt unduly 
of the glimpses&#44; and they arc but glimpses&#44; which he 
has taken in the widely&#8211;extended field of science&#59;

and straightway he imagines that he knows enough&#44; 
more than enough to guide himself securely on the 
intricate path of life&#44; and he heeds not the admonition 
which his parents address to him&#44; and he turns a deaf 
ear to the instructions of his spiritual guides. Es&#8211; 
pecially is this the case with many Israelites of the 
present day&#58; they have at length been aroused from a 
long mental sleep in wdiich oppression had cast their 
fathers &#59; and&#44; intoxicated with the new draughts of 
science&#44; after awakening from their slumber of centu&#8211; 
ries in duration&#44; they imagine themselves equal to solve 
all the difficult problems of life&#44; and no longer under 
the necessity of the least&#44; even divine&#44; direction and 
control. Their fathers&#44; they say&#44; were men of dark&#8211; 
ness&#44; stationary&#44; and opposed to progress&#44; simply be&#8211; 
cause they knew nothing of science and classical lit&#8211; 
erature &#59; but that&#44; for the very reason that the present 
age is one wherein sciences and literature have be&#8211; 
come incorporated in our being&#44; we may safely dis&#8211; 
pense with revelation even&#44; that too having lost its 
potency and use. Is it not evident&#44; therefore&#44; breth&#8211; 
ren&#44; that the preacher of intidelity&#44; who absolves his 
hearers from religious obligations&#44; is far more likely 
to find followers among those Jews whose moral self&#8211; 
government has already been shaken by the whisper&#8211; 
ings of egotism and self&#8211;congratulation&#44; than the 
teachers of those creeds which demand faith and sub&#8211; 
mission to received dogmas&#44; which are not asserted 
to be emanations from human reason&#44; this modern 
golden calf&#44; wdiich has so many worshippers from 
among all sorts of men &#63; Now imagine one who has

forefathers&#44; coming into an assembly before whom 
stands one chosen for his eloquence&#44; descanting week 
after Aveek upon the rights of absolute freedom of 
conscience&#44; of the paramount privileges of human in&#8211; 
tellect &#58; and do you not think that he will be strongly 
appealed to to forsake the religion of his ignorant 
fathers&#44; as he deems them to have been&#44; to bask at 
pleasure in the newly&#8211;discovered mental freedom&#44; 
which holds out so many golden hopes of liberation 
from all that can burden life with fetters&#44; which are 
said to enslave reason and trammel the will&#63; And 
though such a one does not apostatize to the churches 
of the Nazarenes or Ishmaelites&#44; can he be called a 
child of Israel &#63; He neglects the Sabbath&#44; he eats the 
flesh of the swine&#44; he takes for wife the daughter of 
the stranger&#44; his children are uncircumcised in the 
flesh&#44; and horror upon horror&#44; in his hour of death 
he calls not on his Father in heaven&#44; and he refuses to 
subdue his heart before the Creator of the world. 
What then is his nominal adherence worth to us&#44; nay 
to himself&#63; 

Against these dangers I warn you&#44; against such 
doctrines which produce these results and their teach&#8211;

the way wherein the Lord bids you walk all the days 
that you live on the earth. And let it be your con&#8211; 
stant care to distinguish between good and evil&#44; not 
by unaided human reason&#44; but by the light of revela&#8211; 
tion&#44; that revelation which has shone so brilliantly on 
the wide atmosphere of moral existence ever since it 
was first cast thither from the mighty hand of the 
living God&#44; to give light to the children of man in 
their search for truth&#44; that they may travel securely

the brightness of worldly prosperity&#44; and the gloom 
of sorrow and tribulation. Much may be said to you 
of the triumphs of human reason&#44; of the march of 
intellect&#44; of the progress of improvement&#59; but&#44; as you 
value your salvation&#44; be cautious how you let the least 
impression be made upon you by such general asser&#8211;

is in any danger from within or without&#59; and that 
hence there will be no blame attachable to any one 
for quitting an institution so little able to sustain it&#8211; 
self against its enemies&#44; which are confessedly so 
numerous and becoming daily more so. For despite 
of these apparent dangers&#44; despite of these enemies&#44; 
it wnll assuredly prove itself again victorious. It has

have an interest in thejcgaey which is ours&#44; and we 
should watch over it that it meet with no injury from 
the rude hands of opponents&#44; if we can by our exer&#8211; 
tions prevent it&#44; and to labour incessantly that others 
may be drawn into our fellowship&#44; and become like 
us heirs of salvation. 

It was once said&#44; as I was told&#44; within this house&#44; 
before it was dedicated to the God of Israel&#44; by the 
man who here endeavoured to scatter his poisonous 
seed&#44; that the Mosaic religion was like a scaftblding 
reared up before the temple of reason&#44; on which the 
builders were engaged in finishing their work. He 
averred that it had well answered its pui&#42;pose&#59; but 
now that&#44; as the temple is finished&#44; it is necessary to 
remove the unsightly scaffolding to exhibit the temple 
in its beauty&#44; sublimity&#44; and purity&#44; to the admiring 
gaze of the millions. &#8212; A hearer&#44; enraptured as she 
was by what she thought so true and beautifully ex&#8211; 
pressed&#44; reported to me the words in a foreign tongue&#44; 
the sonorous language of the German&#39;s fatherland&#44; 
whence so many of us have emigrated into this dis&#8211; 
tant home&#44; where freedom of conscience and security 
in the pursuit of happiness are the boon of the hum&#8211; 
blest inhabitant. The man who spoke the Avords also 
had come over the wide ocean from that land&#44; whence 
much good and much that is evil in morals and re&#8211; 
ligion have reached these shores. The words were 
too remarkable to be soon forgotten by a follower of 
Moses&#59; and I recall them to&#8211;day merely to show the 
singular connexion there exists in the events of life&#44; 
and how strangely the Almighty shapes every thing 
for a Avise end. This structure was erected to deify 
human reason&#59; liere was unfurled a banner which 

<pb n="173"/>

god&#39;s heritage. 173 

bore a device of defiance against all revelation &#59; and 
here it was declared that the law of Moses was a 
mere preparation for a brighter development&#44; a some&#8211; 
thing better than the instruction derived from God. 
The creature called reason should alone decide&#44; 
should alone be arbitrator in all that relates to moral 
opinions and actions&#59; and Israelites and gentiles were 
alike invited to mingle as one people under the folds 
of this banner&#44; and to forget what both had been 
taught&#44; and to hury here all their prejudices in the 
common grave of past errors. It sounded well in 
the hearing of many&#59; a brotherhood of mankind&#44; a 
universality of human freedom based on their intel&#8211; 
lect&#59; it was sublime&#44; it was enchanting. Only one 
thing was forgotten&#44; and that is&#44; that we are God&#39;s 
chosen race&#44; chosen not to grant us favour&#44; and wis&#8211; 
dom&#44; and wealth&#59; but that we might become by slow&#44; 
yet sure&#44; degrees the moral reformers of the world&#44; 
and to enlighten human reason irjjon the principles of the 
divine loisdoni intrusted to our care. But if we must 
needs preserve this power of enlightening&#44; we can 
only accomplish this our destiny in one way&#44; in one 
way solely&#44; I maintain&#44; that is by retaining our iden&#8211; 
tity&#44; remaining as we have been&#44; not by surrendering 
our portion as the common stock of mankind&#44; nor 
by adopting something else from them&#44; any new or 
old invention which they may offer us instead of our 
faith. Yes&#44; we expect a union of all men under the 
one standard &#59; but it is not that of reason&#44; untaught 
by the Lord&#44; but that of the law of Moses&#44; planted 
immovably in the heart of the rock of Horeb&#44; whence 
its folds flutter to this day with every breeze that is 
wafted to the four corners of the earth. It is indeed 

15&#42; 

<pb n="174"/>

the triumph of reason for which we long and pray&#59; 
but then it will be reason illuminated and made per&#8211; 
fect by tlie inspiration of the Lord of the universe&#44; 
He who framed our body from the dust of the earth&#44; 
and breathed into our nostrils the breath of life&#44; 
through which we were rendered intelligent&#59; and 
though this also constituted us free agents&#44; we were 
likewise made responsible for all the deeds we may ac&#8211; 
complish during our sojourn in the world. And thus 
it has occurred this day&#44; that those who thought to 
have found in this house a foothold for the untaught 
intellect of man&#44; have quitted its precincts&#44; and the 
shouts wdiich deified their own will no longer are 
heard Avithin these walls. And you Ixave come hither&#44; 
brothers in Israel &#33; with the transcripts of the Code 
of Moses in the language of the ancient Hebrews&#44; 
and with volumes filled with nothing else than the 
laws and statutes which were laid before the sons of 
Jacob&#44; by their great teacher who so well fulfilled 
his mission to them. And ye are here present this 
day in a house devoted to the Lord God&#44; the Sovereign 
of the universe&#44; and you profess yourselves believers 
in the truth of his holy word&#44; and you say that you 
have full faith in its permanence&#44; and that you are to 
this day bound by all that it contains. You have felt 
that your religion is something more than a mere 
scaflblding to rear thereby another structure&#44; be this 
one of reason&#44; or a belief in another creed which re&#8211; 
cpiires a messenger of divine truths other than Moses&#44; 
or a redeemer other than the great God of Israel&#44; who 
WAS&#44; who IS&#44; and who will be. You are here to de&#8211; 
clare that your own intelligence is not enough to 
guide you aright&#44; but that you wish to be taught by 

<pb n="175"/>

god&#39;s heritage. 175 

the omnipotent Teacher who enlightened your fore&#8211; 
fathers&#44; whose words are words of fire&#44; whose pre&#8211; 
cepts are the lamp to eternal happiness. And well 
do yon act to desire this instruction&#59; and hehold it is 
not far from you&#44; it is not over the sea&#44; nor in the high 
realms of heaven &#59; but in yonder ark is the treasure 
found&#59; it is literally within your hearts&#44; within your 
mouths&#44; that you may fulfil it. 

Do you now understand &#34;what is the import of the 
words&#44; &#34;We dedicate this house to the God of Israel&#63;&#34; 
You do&#44; I am certain&#59; but permit me to give tongue 
to your thoughts&#44; and sure I am that you will respond 
to all that I can say. You know of no One in heaven 
and on earth&#44; in times past&#44; present&#44; and future&#44; to 
whom worship is due&#44; but the Most High One who 
chose Abraham in making a covenant of everlasting 
with him and his seed&#44; who confirmed his oath unto 
Isaac&#44; and who established it with Jacob as a statute 
for Israel&#44; unto all eternit3&#94; Ilim you have followed 
out of Egypt&#59; Him you have heard on Iloreb&#59; Him 
you have worshipped in Palestine&#59; Him you have 
found a beneficent Father and a righteous Judge&#59; 
Him also you have found a sure Protector&#44; inasmuch 
as with all your sorrows you have never been con&#8211; 
sumed. And you know that the religion which is 
yours is derived from his intelligence&#44; it is the portion 
which the Godhead delivered unto you&#44; through which 
means you are rendered his inheritance&#59; and you 
feel that by obeying it you obey his will&#44; and that if 
found worthy you will obtain his approbation&#44; without 
the necessity of any aid from any other source. And&#44; 
therefore&#44; do you devote this house to Him&#44; who is 
the universal God&#44; the Creator of all flesh&#44; the Lord 

<pb n="176"/>

of all spirits&#59; but who permits you to call Ilim by 
your own name&#44; as the national God of Israel&#44; and 
henceforth his Name is to be invoked here&#44; and hero 
is his word to be proclaimed to those who thirst not 
for water&#44; nor are hungry for food&#44; but who pant for 
instruction&#44; to certify unto them how they are to serve 
the Lord. Here the mourner and the helpless are to 
appear to crave aid and mercy&#59; here the one escaped 
from danger is lo resort to return thanks in the midst 
of the faithful&#59; and hither too should come those who 
are happy&#44; and joyful&#44; whose storehouse is filled with 
plenty&#44; and whose children grow up around them like 
the vigorous trees of the forest&#44; to confess theii&#42; in&#8211; 
debtedness to the Bestower of all good&#44; who has 
blessed them more than they deserve&#44; who has heaped 
benefits on them which their deeds do not merit. 
Here all are to recognize the same God as the Source 
of all that is dispensed&#44; be this good&#44; be this evil&#59; and 
here all are to seek a remedy for their troubles&#44; or to 
pour out their hearts in prayer and praise at the shrine 
of the One whose power is unlimited&#44; and whose hand 
is still stretched out to punish and to save&#44; to slay&#44; 
and to call again unto life. 

Now rejoice&#44; the work is done&#44; and this place is 
called by the name of your God &#59; you have fulfilled 
one duty in having procured a suitable house wherein 
to ofi&#58;er your orisons&#44; the sacrifices of your lips. But 
take heed&#44; that your work of to&#8211;day may not ascend 
against you as an accusing angel&#44; and demand ven&#8211; 
geance on you for not being diligent in the services 
of God. It is not enough that you have ample room 
for many worshippers&#44; whilst the benches are empty&#44; 
and the seats deserted. It is not enough that you

have a fine place of worship&#44; whilst on the Sabbaths 
and festivals your resorts of business are thronged by 
those whose presence is demanded here. It is not 
enough that your synagogue exhibits the beauty of 
holiness&#44; whilst in your private life you are not holy 
unto your God. But let me entreat you to be con&#8211; 
sistent Israelites &#59; be not one thing in profession and 
another in practice&#59; take heed that your honoured 
name become not a reproach through your own mis&#8211; 
deeds &#59; but let your acts appeal to your Father in 
heaven for his blessing&#44; and let men of other persua&#8211; 
sions see that you feel your high destiny&#44; that you 
know the full import of being called children of the 
Lord&#44; the first&#8211;born of grace&#44; the heirs of immortal 
happiness. Thus only can you live before the Lord&#44; 
and be accepted in his presence&#44; and thus only can 
you in your own persons justify the words of our text&#44; 
that &#34; God&#39;s portion is his people&#44; Jacob the lot of 
his inheritance.&#34; &#8212; And may He who blessed our fa&#8211; 
thers&#44; bless you all with his spirit&#44; and inscribe you 
in the book of life&#44; so that you may live in peace on 
earth&#44; and be blessed with eternal felicity hereafter.

But not in wrath do Thou&#44; Holy One&#33; come to judge

ing to thy goodness have we acted towards Thee &#59; for 
in the same measure as Thou hast removed our bur&#8211; 
dens&#44; have we risen in rebellion against thy will and 
law&#44; and followed the evil inclinations of our heart&#44; 
whereby we have violated thy precepts&#44; and shown 
ourselves unworthy of the name which we bear. Still 
let us entreat Thee&#44; to let thy hand tall lightly when 
it is stretched out to strike the sinners&#44; and let each 
blow be so directed that it may appeal to the obdu&#8211;

Brethren &#33; 

The Scriptures contain niany words of consolation &#59; 
but none are more &#39;comforting than those which as&#8211; 
sure us that the wrath of God is not everlasting&#44; and 
that the sinner can obtain again the mercy which he 
has forfeited through means of a voluntary return to 
righteousness. And thus speaks the Lord through 
Ezekiel the prophet &#40;xviii. 26&#41; &#58; 

&#34; Again when the wicked turneth away from his wickedness 
which he hath committed&#44; and doth what is lawful and right&#44; he 
will preserve his soul alive.&#34; 

In our hurried manner of judging of the events of 
life&#44; we are very apt to claim for ourselves a species 
of blamelessness&#44; as though we are always the crea&#8211; 
tures of circumstances which compel us to act in a 
certain way&#44; and leave us no liberty of motion and 
action. If we may be believed&#44; we love righteous&#8211; 
ness sincerely and ardently&#44; and we only transgress&#44; 
either through the force of circumstances&#44; our posi&#8211; 
tion in society&#44; the defects of education&#44; ill health&#44; 
multiplicity of engagements&#44; and whatever else the 
excuses may be&#44; which we so aptly apply to drown 
the voice of conscience&#44; when it&#44; in the moments of 
occasional wakefulness&#44; accuses us with our imper&#8211; 
fections&#44; and brings before us the evidences of our

guilt. &#8212; Now it is certainly true&#44; that circumstances 
have a very powerful influence over us&#44; and that they 
to a great extent prompt our actions. But it is not 
true that we are entirely dependent upon things with&#8211; 
out us&#44; or that they can be pleaded as a complete jus&#8211; 
tification for our course of life. In the first place 
circumstances may be viewed as the providential in&#8211; 
dication of our intended plan of life&#44; the limitation 
of the sphere in which we are to move and act. If 
we&#44; for instance&#44; happen to be born of rich parents&#44; 
of persons in an elevated walk of life&#44; we are surely 
in a very different position from that we would be if 
our first breath were drawn in the abodes of wretch&#8211; 
edness&#44; where the morning dawns without a morsel 
of food to put before the half&#8211;naked little ones&#44; shiv&#8211; 
ering in a fireless room&#44; whilst the chill blast of fierce 
winter enters through many a chink in the cracked 
walls&#44; which offer no adequate resistance to its fury &#59; 
from that if our earliest recollections should carry 
us back to scenes of strife and debauchery&#44; to igno&#8211; 
rance and its concomitant crimes. In the one case 
the mind will run back to a smiling innocence of in&#8211; 
fant years&#44; in the other to the dreary picture which 
so checks in the young all aspiration for what is pleas&#8211; 
ant and beautiful. There is therefore a marked dis&#8211; 
tinction in the start which individuals placed in these 
respective ranks have in the race of life &#58; the one is en&#8211; 
couraged by all the soft attractions of ease&#44; refinement&#44; 
and luxury&#59; the other is repelled by the struggles&#44; 
the coarseness&#44; the penury of his lowly condition &#59; the 
one has a path ready broken and levelled&#44; all he needs 
to do is to advance &#59; the other has to battle against 
adversity in every step he takes&#44; and has not only to

seek the road which leads onward&#44; but has to force 
for himself a uarrow passage on which he may push 
forward amidst the eager crowd&#44; in whose way the 
new aspirant stands. But having stated this&#44; we have 
assigned all the advantages to a pleasant commence&#8211; 
ment which it can claim&#59; for beyond this neither 
wealth&#44; nor position&#44; nor education can help any one &#59; 
all the gifts we receive are properly speaking means 
for progress&#44; not the perfection of human happiness&#59; 
and therefore it is merely the proper use of our posi&#8211; 
tion&#44; not the position itself which&#44; of right&#44; stamps 
our character with honour&#44; and places us in the front 
ranks of society. It is tlierefore true that the man 
whose origin is low&#44; I use the word designedly as ex&#8211; 
pressing something positively deleterious&#44; not merely 
humble&#44; who in infancy was surrounded with the de&#8211; 
basing influences of immorality and vulgar associates&#44; 
has a natural incentive presented to him to become 
like his companions&#44; and parents&#44; if you include them 
also&#44; low&#44; debased&#44; and vulgar. But this is not the 
case of necessity&#44; or in other words&#44; he is not irresist&#8211; 
ibly drawn to a course of vice&#44; through the defects 
of his position &#59; for he is enabled by the spirit which 
his Creator has implanted in him to rise superior to 
circumstances&#44; to discard his wicked companions&#44; to 
become industrious and frugal&#59; to accumulate prop&#8211; 
erty&#44; and what is more&#44; to acquire a character for 
probity and moral worth&#44; and a position among the 
pious&#44; so that he can be well satisfied with the hum&#8211; &#8211; 
bleness of his descent and the lowness of his original 
condition. 
We may state as an incontrovertible truth&#44; that

wealth is not always destined for the sons of the rich &#59; 
nor is respectability universally the property of the 
educated and high&#8211;born solely. The offspring of in&#8211; 
dic&#94;ence may rise to be the merchant&#8211;princes of the 
land&#44; and the humblest may ascend to the pinnacles 
of renoAvn&#44; unapproached by those who once despised 
their mean origin. Because the Almighty&#44; in the 
equal distribution of his gifts&#44; has not overlooked the 
lowly&#8211;placed&#59; and commensurate with their trials 
has He given them talent&#44; energy&#44; and perseverance&#44; 
through which means things deemed almost impossi&#8211; 
bilities may often be accomplished. Search then the 
annals of the world&#44; and you will find precisely the 
children of poverty&#44; men whose pedigree was un&#8211; 
known to themselves almost&#44; occupy the most con&#8211; 
spicuous positions&#44; and contributing to the develop&#8211; 
ments of the mind which&#44; without their co&#8211;operation 
would&#44; to all appearance&#44; have been greatly retarded. 
People speak often contemptuously of these new men&#44; 
of these mushrooms of the day&#44; whom nobody heard 
of before&#44; whose parents were common labourers&#44; 
mendicants&#44; or even criminals &#59; but these and the like 
observations do not derogate in the slightest degree 
from their eminence&#44; or diminish by aught the meas&#8211; 
ure of their merit. 

In the above I have not dealt with fancies&#44; but 
merely recited to you facts&#44; of which you can all find 
a verification in your own experience. Now what 
does this prove to us&#44; so far as morals and religion 
are concerned &#63; Simply this&#44; that no man is born to 
be irretrievably wicked&#44; and that there exists no 
moral force which restrains any one to persevere in a 
course of crime&#44; though his earliest recollections carry

him back only to a concourse of wicked and depraved 
characters. Some indeed tell us&#44; that there are in 
certain large conimunities and in many lonely and 
distant settlements what may be termed schools of 
vice&#44; where no sound of a religious word arouses the 
conscience&#44; where profanity and excesses are prac&#8211; 
tised without restraint&#44; and where robbery and vio&#8211; 
lence are enforced as a branch of education&#44; and the 
most expert acts in defiance of law and good order 
are applauded as deeds meriting the highest praise. 
That children reared under such influences should 
be almost foredoomed to a vicious life is evident 
enough &#59; for their conscience remains a blank&#44; an 
unimpressed capacity&#44; without any active powe&#94; for 
development&#44; simply because the motives of activity 
are entirely absent. Still this does not say that the 
ability to improve is denied to such unfortunates even&#44; 
and that&#44; should virtuous men step forward and snatch 
many such a brand from the midst of the burning&#44; 
they might rescue all&#44; on whom their labours of love 
are bestowed&#44; from the degradation to which they 
seem destined by their wretched position. Only let 
the light of reason illumine these living caverns of 
corruption&#44; and they must naturally be changed at 
least from the perfect corpse&#8211;like state to that of a 
partial animation&#59; and thus may a better and holier 
spirit be gradually breathed into them&#44; and they will 
arise on their feet and stand upright&#44; like one awak&#8211; 
ened from the dead&#44; and live. I have assumed the 
worst state possible of society&#44; where evil is positively 
taught and regarded as a virtue&#44; if this be at all possi&#8211; 
ble&#44; of which however we can hardly form a concep&#8211; 
tion&#44; for the picture is too horrible to be readily real&#8211; 

<pb n="184"/>

184 REGENERATION. 

ized&#59;&#42; and still upon investigation it will be found 
that the moral force is only buried up beneath heaps 
of corruption&#44; not extinguished&#44; however&#44; but ready to 
start into activity so soon as it is left free to develop 
itself. In other words&#44; we come to the conclusion 
that absolute depravity&#44; or an entire inability to ap&#8211; 
preciate virtue&#44; is a thing not to be imagined&#59; and 
hence no one will censure the philanthropist who 
seeks in the abodes of vice for objects on which to 
exert his benevolent efforts of regeneration&#44; and ac&#8211; 
cuse him of a want of common sense&#44; or deem him in 
the least irrational for believing that of such bad ma&#8211; 
terials even any good can be elaborated. 

Let us apply these general principles to the doc&#8211; 
trine of repentance and regeneration as developed in 
our Scriptures. The call to righteousness&#44; you will 
find&#44; is uniform and universal &#59; there is no reserva&#8211; 
tion for those lowly born&#44; for those who have been 
badly educated&#44; or those who have been corrupted by 
early wicked associates. For what are the words of 
the Decalogue&#63; &#34;For I&#44; the Lord thy God&#44; am a 
watchful God&#44; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon 
the children&#44; upon the third generation&#44; and upon 
the fourth generation of those who hate me&#44;&#34; which 
words &#34; who hate me&#34; are correctly explained by your 
wise men&#44; &#34; When the children follow the example 
of their fathers&#44;&#34; which then teaches that to the 
wicked only will ancestral delinquency be retributed&#44; 
not to those who forsake the path of death and choose 
life. There must therefore be a right to expect a love 

&#42; Still it is said to bo true&#44; iis the annuls of wickedness and the 
records of police courts are said to have revealed in large towns 
especially.

for God even among the descendants of his enemies&#44; 
which term includes all who hate righteousness and 
pursue the evil. And how can such a right exist 
if there could be a single human beinsr who is in&#8211; 
capable of reform &#63; who is so much the slave of cir&#8211; 
cumstances as to feel no pleasure whatever in virtue&#44; 
no delight except in crime &#63; It may be that the height 
to which the son of the ungodly will be able to rise&#44; 
is limited by his education&#59; granted&#59; but this does 
not say&#44; that all improvement is impossible to him &#59; 
and how do we know in what estimation the Lord 
may hold the partial self&#8211;regeneration of the son of 
the sinner &#63; who knows but that the little he accom&#8211; 
plishes may be accounted of higher value&#44; than the 
great acts of the one who has always been trained to 
obedience &#63; whose earliest lisping was exercised in 
repeating the truth of religion &#63; We mortals can only 
judge from the outside of a substance&#44; from the mere 
surface of passing events&#59; whereas the Searcher of 
hearts knows all the secrets of the soul&#59; He beholds 
the struggles which even the smallest amendment 
requires &#59; the Obstacles which a course of sin places 
in the way of amendment &#59; and hence He will doubt&#8211; 
less&#39; regard with favour the sincerity of the attempted 
reform&#44; though it fail of reaching its full development 
through the defect of human nnture&#44; and the want of 
knowledge which the sinner may have of the full ex&#8211; 
tent of his duty. 

You will observe&#44; brethren&#44; that I put the worst 
cases&#44; the most unlikely to produce a reformation&#59; 
and still we see that amendment is not impossible&#44; 
and that it is required by the Lord&#44; with a threaten&#8211; 
ing of condign visitation&#44; if the demand be not satis&#8211;

fied&#44; No one should therefore say &#58; &#34; I violate the 
Sabbath&#44; because my father violated it before me.&#34; 
True&#44; the example was bad&#44; perhaps there may have 
been compulsion employed to induce the son to la&#8211; 
bour&#59; but so soon as he has learned his duty&#44; so soon 
as he can bid defiance to a wicked father&#39;s tyranny&#44; 
the law speaks to him authoritatively &#58; &#34; Rememl&#41;er the 
Sabbath&#8211;day to keep it holy.&#34; No one should say&#58; 
&#34; In my father&#39;s house forbidden food was put on the 
table &#59; they taught me there to partake of whatever 
food pleased the palate without regard to the prohibi&#8211; 
tions of the Mosaic Law.&#34; For he should remember 
that the knowledge which he has received of the will 
of God in this respect&#44; testifies unto him that the con&#8211; 
duct of his parents was unjustifiable&#44; and that he is 
bound to listen to the voice of the Eternal&#44; the Parent 
of all mankind&#44; to the exclusion of that of an earthly 
father and mother&#44; whose breath is a mere loan&#44; re&#8211; 
sumable at pleasure by the Holy One who bestowed 
it on them. Men do not plead old fashions as an 
excuse for wearing antiquated garments&#44; or being 
conveyed in carriages of an inconvenient form&#44; be&#8211; 
cause their grandparents so appeared in public&#44; and 
because they saw such things before them in their 
infancy. And still when religion is in question&#44; men 
have a ready excuse that they have not been taught 
better&#44; they only follow the example of their prede&#8211; 
cessors. But how supremely ridiculous is such an 
excuse from the mouth of a professed believer &#33; If 
you are infidels&#44; if you believe your own reason sufli&#8211; 
cicnt for your guidance &#59; if you do not put full faith in 
the truth of revelation&#59; if you imagine&#44; but O&#44; how 
vain &#33; that there is no responsibility in the grave 

<pb n="187"/>

REGENERATION. 187 

whither you are going &#58; then there may be a shadow 
of a shadow for defending sin on the plea of the ex&#8211; 
ample of others. But for a believer&#44; who confides 
sincerely in the instruction of his God&#44; who justly 
deems the word of the Lord the only sure guide in 
the duties of life&#44; who is firmly convinced that he 
must stand in judgment before the Most Holy Judge&#44; 
who knows the secrets of every bosom&#44; and who for&#8211; 
gets not any act though it be wrought in the dark&#8211; 
ness of concealment &#8212; for such a one to say&#44; he sins 
because his father sinned before him&#44; is indeed incom&#8211; 
prehensible&#44; and we may well say&#44; How much is this 
one braving the wrath&#44; of God&#33; He does not plead 
ignorance&#44; he does not advance the lack of oppor&#8211; 
tunity&#44; &#8212; only tiiat he was originally placed in circum&#8211; 
stances unfavorable to religion. Yet how can this 
single fact have all the force he claims from it&#44; to 
excuse him for neglecting what he knows to be con&#8211; 
trary to his own conviction &#63; what he deems to be 
a violation of the sacred duty which his religion de&#8211; 
mands of him &#63; &#8212; Perhaps he may be disposed to 
enter upon the exercises of the law as one enters a 
market&#8211;house furnished with many delicacies&#44; with 
a variety of fruits and vegetables&#44; from which he 
chooses what pleases his taste&#44; and rejects those things 
which do not suit his fancy. Thus indeed we see 
many a one making a religion of his own &#59; permitting 
himself much or little which to others is interdicted&#44; 
and proceeding with the most sacred concern of life 
as one would do with any earthly&#44; or mere human 
thing&#44; unawed by its sanctity&#44; unterrified by the 
threats of its Supreme Bestower. But this again is 
irrational&#44; unworthy especially of those whose mind 

<pb n="188"/>

188 REGENERATION. 

has drunk in the streams of knowledge and mental 
enlightenment&#44; l&#94;o proposition is truer&#44; than that 
the whole law is either true or false. There is no 
limit&#44; no definite line behind which we can range the 
different precepts&#44; and then declare the one part to 
be ill force&#44; the other to be useless. Through the 
Avhole Pentateuch&#44; our only standard of duty&#44; it is 
nearly everywhere said&#44; &#34; The Lord spoke to Moses&#44; 
saying&#44;&#34; &#38;c. &#59; the phraseology is everywhere the 
same wherever the context permits it&#44; and the other 
few deviations will be found to be so merely in form&#44; 
not in substance. And what does all this prove &#63; but 
that so far as internal evidence is concerned&#44; there is 
no distinction to be drawn between precept and pre&#8211; 
cept&#59; all are alike binding&#44; seeing that they are all 
based on the selfsame authority &#58; consequently there 
can exist no valid reason for observing the one at the 
expense of the other&#44; or for deeming some command&#8211; 
ments pre&#8211;eminently holy more than the rest&#44; as is 
done by so many who pretend to piety&#44; but who are 
deficient in the great essential of humilUy &#59; inasmuch 
as they place their own judgment above the declared 
will of God. 

We are thus commanded to love God&#44; to be the 
friends of our Creator&#44; though our fathers hated Ilim 
and were his enemies. As already said in tlie verse 
which we quoted from the Decalogue&#44; there is ven&#8211; 
geance threatened against the sons of the sinner who 
follow him in his wickedness. But our text says&#58; 
&#34; When the wicked turneth away from his wicked&#8211; 
ness&#44; he will preserve his soul alive.&#34; So then it is 
contemplated that life shall be given to any one who&#44; 
learning to hate his previous conduct&#44; turns away 

<pb n="189"/>

therefrom&#44; and does what is lawful and right. It 
matters not therefore how the evil course was con&#8211; 
tracted&#44; whether through the example of the parent&#44; 
or one&#39;s own impulse and inclination for the pleasant 
vices which are at times so attractive in their exterior&#44; 
yet so destructive in the bitter fruits of death which 
they produce&#58; all the wicked are invited to ask for 
life of the soul&#44; and they are promised the cer&#8211; 
tainty of attaining it. And the prophet justifies this 
merciful dispensation&#59; because the Lord would judge 
each of the house of Israel according to his own ways&#44; 
irrespective of the actions or advice of any other hu&#8211; 
man being&#59; because the responsibility of obedience 
is imposed upon all men alike&#44; according to the op&#8211; 
portunities which are given them&#59; but no one is ex&#8211; 
empt from duty&#44; and no one is permitted to do wdiat 
is absolutely wrong. It must therefore be actually 
possible for each one of us to amend his course&#44; since 
the Almighty can ask nothing from man which he 
cannot accomplish &#59; it must be that no one is placed 
so low in the scale of humanity&#44; but that he has some 
means of acquiring a degree&#44; ever so slight even&#44; of 
godliness&#59; and thus the law has a just claim upon all 
the children of Israel&#44; that they should observe its 
precepts and act accordingly. No one in his sloth&#8211; 
fulness can rest his claims for mercy upon the rio&#8211;ht&#8211; 
eousness of his father&#59; no one can appeal to his 
father&#39;s sin for an extenuation of his owai guilt. No 
one can ever claim to have done enough&#44; and at any 
portion of his life Ibrsake the ways of piety&#44; and dis&#8211; 
regard the duties and obligations of his faith. But 
every son of Israel should direct his inquiry to the 
pages of the law of his God&#44; and&#44; learning what is

there required&#44; act up to that alone&#44; and look for 
mercy solely by striving incessantly to omit nothing 
on his part&#44; by which&#44; humble mortal though he is&#44; 
he may deserve that favour which the Bible promises 
to the simple in faith&#44; to the sincere follower of the 
Lord. Let no one continue in his course of sin under 
the infatuation that he is born to a sinner&#39;s fate&#44; that 
he has no power within himself to turn from iniquity&#59; 
for if this were so&#44; then would the Ten Command&#8211; 
ments not denounce punishment against the enemies 
of God&#59; and we are his enemies&#44; whilst we rebel 
against his declared will. There is an element of sin 
implanted in our heart &#59; the antagonizing principle&#44; 
however&#44; also is deeply seated there&#44; and has a ten&#8211; 
fold greater power &#59; since it is able to overcome the 
other altogether&#44; whilst the principle of evil&#44; however 
gratified by repeated indulgence&#44; fails of obtaining 
the complete mastery over virtue&#59; and this is proved 
by the agony which the most degraded&#44; the least edu&#8211; 
cated criminal experiences in the presence of the 
righteous &#59; he feels self&#8211;abashed&#44; although he may not 
have sufficient knowledge to arrive at the perfection 
which he admires in others&#44; for having so entirely 
failed in ennobling his character through those deeds 
which adorn the lives of the good. And then we 
have ample experience to prove that&#44; through such a 
feeling of contrition&#44; a new desire for virtue was often 
awakened&#44; and that&#44; it being thus awakened&#44; it led the 
unfortunate to seek for instruction&#44; and then he loved 
to practise what he so late acquired. 

Indeed the gates of repentance are never closed&#59; 

the power of the Merciful One is extended to save all 

who call on Him for aid and mercy. The beginning&#44;

however&#44; must come from us&#44; as the prophet sajs &#58; 
&#34; Cast away from yourselves all your transgressions&#44; 
whereby you have transgressed &#59; and make yourselves 
a new heart and a new spirit&#59; for why will ye die&#44; O 
liouse of Israel &#63;&#34; We must acknowledge our guilt&#44; 
condemn sincerely our conduct&#44; throw away as it 
were from us all our transgressions&#59; and then com&#8211; 
mence a new system of life&#44; as though &#94;e had a new 
heart and a new soul&#44; not those which formerly thought 
on sin and delighted in iniquity&#44; but sucli as reflect 
only on serving God and find the highest pleasure in 
yielding obedience to his decrees. If then we com&#8211; 
mence&#44; it matters not what our state of life may be&#44; 
what our education may have been &#58; we have a well&#8211; 
founded assurance that we have rent asunder the de&#8211; 
cree of death recorded against us&#44; and we shall have 
life&#44; ay&#44; the life of the soul&#44; which life is not quenched 

in death&#44; and terminates not within the grave. This 

blissful assurance was announced to us in the days of 
Ezekiel &#59; but it also &#8211;applies to our time&#44; to us who 
are here this day. O let the call arouse you&#44; breth&#8211; 
ren&#44; to a sincere reflection &#59; investigate wherein you 
have sinned&#44; exculpate not your misdeeds by the 
force of circumstances or the allurement of example &#59; 
but accuse yourselves of every transgression against 
the Law of which you are cognizant&#44; and endeavour 
to avoid in future the recurrences of the same sins. 
So shall your prayers be heard on High&#44; and the ap&#8211; 
proaching Day of Atonement be in truth one of for&#8211; 
giveness of sin&#44; and you will be rendered indeed clean 
before the Lord&#44; as you desire&#8211; Amen.

Brethren&#33; 

There is but one single principle which can of 

<pb n="193"/>

THE CREATION. 193 

right be regarded by all persons as the foundation of 
Judaism&#44; and this is the existence of one God&#44; from 
whom all has sprung&#44; and this we are told in the first 
words of Scripture &#58; 

&#34; In the beginning&#44; God created the heavens and the earth&#44;&#34; 
Gen. i. 1. 

This means thrit the first origin of matter&#44; not less 
than its arrangement&#44; the production of the stuff from 
which heaven and earth are made&#44; is the work of the 
Being here called God&#44; D&#94;n&#94;a or the One in whom all 
the powers perceivable any where and every wliere 
are centred&#44; and from whom in consequence all 
powers&#44; faculties&#44; and capacities are derived. He is 
the Origin&#44; &#8212; every thing else the product&#59; He is the 
Bestower&#44; &#8212; every one else the recipient. The Bible&#44; 
therefore&#44; in the narrative of the creation&#44; does not so 
much give a consecutive account of how the organiz&#8211; 
ation of the universe took place&#44; although this also is 
done in the first chapter of Genesis&#44; as to exhibit the 
agency through which the mighty structure in its 
vastness and its details was brought forth&#44; and this 
agency was the creative word of the Most High&#59; as 
the Psalmist says&#58; &#34;By the word of the Lord the 
heavens were made&#44; and by the breath of his lips all 
their host.&#34; &#40;Psalm xxxiii. 6.&#41; There is&#44; let me re&#8211; 
mark in passing&#44; a great error&#44; of which many are 
heedlessly guilty&#44; that is of regarding the Bible pri&#8211; 
marily as a mere history&#44; or as a philosophical expo&#8211; 
sition of the causes of the events recorded there &#59; 

VOL. VII. 17 

<pb n="194"/>

194 THE CREATION. 

whereas in truth this cannot be the aim of our Scrip&#8211; 
tures&#44; inasmuch as for the one purpose the details are 
not sufiiciently ample&#59; and for the other&#44; the minute 
points on wliich to form a judgment are omitted. Yet 
it is not on this account to be supposedthat our Bible 
contradicts history or enforces unphilosophical con&#8211; 
clusions&#59; we only say that its value does not depend 
upon these considerations&#44; which nevertheless have so 
often been looked for&#44; and this not always with full 
satisfaction by many who have studied the word of 
God with improper ideas respecting&#8211; its nature and 
tendency. In modern times&#44; accordingly&#44; there liave 
arisen men who profess to account for the age of the 
world in a dilferent manner from what they fancy is 
laid down in the book of Genesis&#44; and they aver that 
it required many centuries&#44; many thousands of years&#44; 
for the crust of the earth to assume its present shape&#44; 
and for the consolidation of the rocks and mountains 
and the other formations which present themselves 
on the surface of the globe. And if the small part 
of creation on which we live required so long a time&#44; 
how old then must all the vast universe be&#59; since our 
earth is scarcely the size of a single grain of sand in 
comparison with the thousands on thousands of worlds 
which revolve on every side around us. But that the 
creation is not confined to the earth&#44; and that this is

these are not a fixed sort of a tent stretched out for 
the habitation of the sun and moon and the starry 
host of the night&#44; is not a discovery of modern phi&#8211; 
losophers only&#44; but has long since been felt and ex&#8211; 
pressed by those writers who have transmitted to us 
the Scriptures of the Lord&#44; and also by their followers&#44;

who justly estimated their own insignificance in the 
scale of beings by their littleness&#44; when compared 
with the immensity of matter of which they formed 
but a mere speck&#44; not recognizable to the most pain&#8211; 
ful search in the totality of things. They knew that 
their earth was but a minute portion of all the many 
mighty worlds which the Creator has cast abroad&#59; 
and still they felt that&#44; with all this comparative small&#8211; 
ness of their globe&#44; and with the absolute insignifi&#8211; 
cance of their own bodies on the earth&#44; they were 
the objects of providential care&#44; of a watchfulness 
which is not fatigued by the survey of dominions of 
such vast extent&#44; nor wearied&#44; by the inspection of the 
minuter particles which form the aggregate of the 
entire whole. &#8212; &#34; The Lord&#39;s are the earth and what 
fiUeth it&#44; the world and its inhabitants&#44;&#34; thus they 
thought&#44; and they therefore confided in his instruc&#8211; 
tion &#59; and though they knew the sun to be vast&#44; 
though they felt assured that in the constellations on 
high they beheld worlds piled upon worlds&#58; they did 
not for tliat reason doubt that they themselves pro&#8211; 
ceeded from the same Source&#44; and that the same 
Power had called them into being. In this light 
merely must we accordingly regard the account of 
the creation&#44; as an indication that the whole universe 
of which we can form an idea was and is the work of 
God&#44; the Almighty&#44; who is here announced as the 
Creator. It matters not in this view whether before 
the earth and the presoit outward structure of things 
were organized&#44; God had created the original matter 
many centuries antecedently&#59; nor tliat it may take 
ages&#44; not days&#44; for the rocks to rise above the surface 
of the water&#44; and to become by degrees hardened to

their present consistency &#59; nor tliat the mountains are 
not a uniform structure&#44; but contain remains of ani&#8211; 
mals and pkmts long since vanished from the earth&#59; 
nor that originally what is now dry land must have 
been a reservoir of water&#44; or been the bed of mighty 
torrents rolling along in their fury masses of stone 
and banks of earth &#58; all this does not in the least con&#8211; 
tradict the assertion of the text&#44; which informs us 
that &#34; God created in the beginnincr the heavens and 
the earth&#44;&#34; that He originated the elements&#44; and as&#8211; 
signed to them their power of action&#44; limited their 
sphere and controlled their progress. The more you 
assume that only simple elements were originally sent 
forth&#59; the more you insist that all we see and know 
of is reducible to so limited a number of original 
substances&#44; that a child can write them down&#58; the 
more you magnify the power of the Most High&#44; that 
He from so few means of combination produced the 
immense variety of worlds&#44; of suns&#44; of beings&#44; of 
animals&#44; of vegetables&#44; of minerals&#44; all so varied&#44; all 
so distinct in their nature&#44;&#42; qualities&#44; and powers&#59; 
especially as with all the knowledge mankind have 
hitherto obtained of the mechanism of organized 
things&#44; they have failed to imitate in a solitary in&#8211; 
stance a single object of the vast variety of substances&#44; 
and giving to any of their products the least semblance 
of life and voluntary motion&#44; or the power of repro&#8211; 
duction. With all our knowledge we are only able 

&#42; This holds good even in substances where the chemist finds the 
same identical elements&#44; but yet exhibiting diilcrent qualities&#44; owing 
to the presence in diflerent quantities&#44; probably&#44; of the imponder&#8211; 
able forces&#44; such us light&#44; heat&#44; electricity&#44; or whatever has yet 
escaped human search.

to dissolve&#44; to disconnect&#44; to combine&#44; to change&#59; and 
where we leave a product of our own&#44; there we shall 
iind it again&#44; unincreascd&#44; and unimproved by time 
or circumstance&#44; but perhaps transformed tin&#8211;ongh its 
own want of cohesion&#44; or dissolved by the incongruity 
of the elements m our combining. It is accordingly 
the province of the Creator himself alone to fix on a 
permanent footing what lie elaborates&#59; since with 
Him there is no conceivable want of knowledge of 
the nature of his elements&#44; nor of the means to place 
them in harmony with each other&#44; and to preserve the 
equilibrium between them and cognate substances. 

But it is by no means certain that it was necessary 
for God to submit to a progress in his creation &#59; or 
that He required time&#44; like a chemist&#44; to see his pro&#8211; 
ducts&#44; so to say&#44; ripening under his supervision&#44; be&#8211; 
fore they could assume the necessary form or could 
crystallize by slow degrees in definite shapes and pro&#8211; 
portions. This is talking of Him as of a human be&#8211; 
ing&#59; this is placing the Creator upon the same level 
with his creatures&#58; these exist in the space and the 
limit of time set by Him&#44; their Author&#59; but is He&#44; 
the unlimited and illimitable&#44; to be thought of in this 
light&#63; is not He who produces all able to call it forth 
in an instant of time&#44; and to destroy it again at his 
pleasure&#63;&#8212; The Bible says&#58; &#34;And the earth was 
without form and void&#44; and darkness was upon the 
face of the deep&#59;&#34; meaning&#44; when first the matter 
which now forms our earth was made&#44; it was a con&#8211; 
fused mass of all the elements which constitute it&#44; 
without form&#44; without divisions&#44; without light. It 
was mixed&#44; and cold&#44; and dark&#44; in a manner of which 
we can form no conception&#44; since we lack the ele&#8211;

mcnts of comparison. This was on the first day of 
creation. How long this state of things may have 
lasted the text gives us no farther insight of than by 
ending &#34; and it was evening and it was morning the 
first day.&#34; But it does not distinctly declare that the 
state of the beginning&#44; the n&#39;tyxn &#40;Reshith&#41;&#44; might not 
have preceded the formation of light for many long 
and dreary years&#44; in which&#44; for all we know&#44; a slow 
process of gradual and beneficent change may have 
been wrought by the Creator&#44; so as to prepare the in&#8211; 
coherent mass for the habitation of living things. So 
also it is said&#44; &#34;And the spirit of God was moving 
&#40;more correctly&#44; hovering&#44; waving&#44; or fluttering&#44;&#41; on 
the surface of the water.&#34; There was&#44; we may ex&#8211; 
plain&#44; the mass of earthy and waterj&#8211; particles thrown 
out into space&#44; uncongenial and cold&#44; dead to all pur&#8211; 
poses and in appearance&#59; nevertheless it was subject 
to an influence which gathered into one the harmo&#8211; 
nizing principles&#44; and separated those which had pe&#8211; 
culiar tendencies inio diflerent classes&#59; &#34; the spirit of 
God&#44;&#34; as it is figuratively called in the Bible&#44; was 
moving to and fro on the suriace of the undivided 
fluids&#44; to work upon them and through them the 
changes Avhich unsearchable &#34;Wisdom had at first con&#8211; 
templated. Though we have assumed in this numner 
that this state of transition may have lasted a long 
period&#44; it is by no means certain that this must have 
been so&#59; for there is nothing to prevent the Deity 
from accomplishing the creation of chaos and its or&#8211; 
ganization in the same day&#44; such a day as oui&#42;s&#44; con&#8211; 
sisting of a period from sunrise to sunrise&#44; although 
the sun at that period was not yet assigned as the 
luminary of our globe. We forget&#44; in speaking of

God&#44; that the subject of our discourse is the &#42;&#63;0&#39; Sd 
the All&#8211;sufficient&#44; who no sooner wills than He exe&#8211; 
cutes&#44; who no sooner desires than his desires are ful&#8211; 
filled. To us the transition appears too rapid&#44; too 
precipitate&#44; too unexpected&#59; but this does not cir&#8211; 
cumscribe Ilim within our rano&#8211;e&#44; does not abridije 
his power or render unreasonable his wisdom. &#8212; The 
changes which we discover on the earth may have&#44; 
moreover&#44; sprung from another circumstance&#44; &#8212; from 
the great flood&#44; which at a later period was sent over 
the whole surface of the habitable globe&#44; when the 
landmarks between dry land and ocean were obliter&#8211; 
ated&#44; when the course of the rivers was not recogrniz&#8211; 
able amidst the vast extent of the treeless sea&#44; the 
heaving of billows without a shore to break their 
force. TVho can tell that in that dread year&#44; when 
all which lived on the dry land perished&#44; except the 
few that had been safely harboured in the ark with 
Noah&#44; all the changes which now puzzle the inquirer 
may have not taken place&#63; who will assure us that 
in that fearful convulsion of nature rocks may not 
have been softened&#44; and whole tribes of animals and 
plants found their graves in the bowels of the granite 
mountains&#44; or deep in the fields of clay or sand &#63; who 
can tell us what influences were called forth by the 
Creator to produce the universal flood&#44; of which we 
now can scarcely form the &#39;smallest idea&#63; and who 
can precisely inform us what powers were afterwards 
called forth again to dry up the earth&#44; that it might 
once more be tittcd for the habitation of mankind &#63; &#8212; 
You will see that all speculation on this subject is but 
painful uncertainty&#44; and all attempts to fix the age of

ouly labouring in the darkness&#44; a mere hypothesis 
without the least approach to certainty. 

Now&#44; I do not contend that the Scriptures do not 
assert that the world was organized in six days&#59; they 
certainly teach this in so many words&#59; but it is also 
clear either that the beginnivg may have endured a 
considerable period&#44; and that this season of transition 
may have been sufficient to produce all the phenomena 
which we see traced around us&#44; or that&#44; if so it pleased 
the Creator&#44; six simple days were enough to create 
and arrange all matter&#44; and all beings which owe their 
existence to Ilim &#59; since&#44; as we have said&#44; to will with 
Ilim is to execute&#44; to think is sufficient to establish 
whatever is his desire. We need not therefore trem&#8211; 
ble at the assertion of geologists&#44; that they have found 
a contradiction between revelation and science &#59; for&#44; 
admitting that to man if he had made the earth slow 
progress would have been required&#44; to God it would 
be folly to assign any such a necessity &#59; the term out&#8211; 
side force is not applicable to Ilim&#44; for the very idea 
of such a state would argue a deficiency on his part&#44; 
and a superiority in some higher unknown power to 
coerce and limit Ilim&#59; and who could be this power 
beyond the sole Author of all &#63; &#8212; where should He find 
one that could control Him&#44; and tell Ilim &#58; &#34; Thus far 
and no farther shalt Thou proceed &#63;&#34;&#39; Time and space 
are to Him no assignable limits&#44; and what to us ap&#8211; 
pears infinity and eternity is with Him but the begin&#8211; 
ning of power and existence. It is true that so far as 
we can discover&#44; in all his workings in nature Pie em&#8211; 
ploys natural means&#44; or rather those principles im&#8211; 
planted by Him witliin his system of the Avorld&#44; to 
work out the ends He purposes establishing&#59; but this 

<pb n="201"/>

does not say that in the commencement of things He 
was bound to institute those laws of nature which 
now operate&#44; or to proceed in conformity with the 
views of a modern philosopher&#44; who would assert that 
to produce slate&#44; for example&#44; should require so many 
years&#59; to form stone&#44; coal&#44; or marble&#44; or chalk&#44; or 
anything else&#44; would demand so many more years. 
Perhaps he may be right&#44; that under certain circum&#8211; 
stances the precise time indicated would be absolutely 
consumed&#59; for instance&#44; if he had discovered that in 
his laboratory he had succeeded to produce the given 
substance at such an expense of labour and time. 
But who with all this can tell us that in the great 
alembic of nature&#44; where the fire is the will of God&#44; 
the crucible the whole universe&#44; the product all na&#8211; 
ture&#44; the producing of things is not carried on at a 
rate which no investigation can attain to&#44; the duration 
of which no reasoning can determine &#63; 

So mucli as regards the general views of the di&#8211; 
vine power&#44; which we&#44; as Israelites&#44; have received 
from our forefathers. They are above liuman science&#44; 
for they are inherent in the very idea of an infinite&#39; 
eternal Deity&#44; the God of Abraham&#44; of Isaac&#44; and of 
Jacob. But even without bidding defiance to the 
thoughts of scientific men&#44; we may free&#39;y endeavour 
to stand by the Scriptures&#44; since they are reconcilable 
to the idea of a gradual progress in creation. As the 
Talmud &#40;Aboth v. 1&#41; well observes&#44; with ten sayings&#44; 
the world was created&#59; that is&#44; we find ten&#42; times the 
expression &#34;and God said&#44;&#34; in the first chapter of 

&#42; Eather&#44; nine times&#44; but &#34;in the beginning God created &#34; 
also considered r.s one&#44; it being the origin of &#34;all creation&#44; or the 
eflect of the Word. 

<pb n="202"/>

202 THE CREATION. 

Genesis&#59; though it is&#44; at the same time&#44; contended 
that all this could have been produced by one saying. 
Still so it is&#59; God preferred to till up the outlines of 
creation by slow degrees&#44; slow when viewed in com&#8211; 
parison with his omnipotence &#59; and precisely as the 
work of formation progressed&#44; so came on the stage 
of our world&#44; the earth&#44; the beings suited to the state 
of preparations made to receive them. Chaos and 
darkness existed till the light was made&#59; not the re&#8211; 
flected light of the sun and the moon&#44; but the sub&#8211; 
stance itself&#44; of which the luminaries are merely the 
distributors. This new state of light produced the 
first day&#44; a period when the mute creation enjoyed a 
refulgence till then unknown and unfelt by it. l&#33;&#94;ext 
was the separation of the atmosphere from chaos&#44; 
the expanse in the midst of the water &#59; next the sev&#8211; 
erance of the aqueous from the terrestrial particles &#59; 
and only then was the earth fitted for the habitation 
of grasses&#44; plants&#44; and trees&#44; as only in a solid soil&#44; 
surrounded by an atmosphere&#44; life&#8211;sustaining air&#44; and 
overshadowed by light&#44; can these creatures have their 
being. Nay&#44; observe the words which bid the plants 
appear&#58; &#34;Let the earth bring forth grass&#44; herbs&#44; 
trees bearing fruit&#44;&#34; a rise from the inferior to the 
higher degrees of vegetable substances&#44; thus instanc&#8211; 
ing a progress even discoverable here&#44; and let no 
one suppose that the expression is merely accidental &#59; 
for there is no such thing as accident in the words 
of the law &#59; all proceeds from the purest Source&#44; from 
the highest Wisdom&#44; and we may rest assured&#44; that 
however unable we may be to fathom the reason of 
the divine Mind for so inditing his will&#44; it is not 
the less true that so&#44; only&#44; and not otherwise&#44; could

the record have come down to us with due regard to 
truth. But this would open to us a wide field of 
coutemplation &#59; and we must hasten to condense the 
remainder of our subject in a few words. When 
plants were thus on earth&#44; existing as they could for 
a time without heat&#44; even assuming that this was not 
felt before the sun was appointed to distribute it on 
earth &#58; the next step was to place the light and the 
heat requisite for the subsistence of nature in the 
great solar globe&#44; which was endowed by the Lord 
with the power of eliciting that amount of these 
gifts which is necessary for the subsistence of the 
various degrees of animated and growing created 
things&#59; and as from the nature of the earth&#44; the sun 
cannot be always visible to us&#44; our planet was accom&#8211; 
panied by a satellite&#44; the moon which&#44; accompanying 
it in its revolutions&#44; is to give us back the reflected 
light which it first receives from the centre of our 
system. And only then when there were earth&#44; and 
air&#44; and water&#44; and light&#44; and heat&#44; and food&#44; were the 
different kinds of animals brought Ibrth&#44; first&#44; the in&#8211; 
ferior kind&#44; which live in the water and in the air&#44; 
and afterwards those whose habitation is on the dry 
land &#59; and when the earth was then clad and peopled&#44; 
then only was man created&#44; the crown&#44; as he is&#44; of 
God&#39;s works&#44; the combination of matter with intel&#8211; 
lect&#44; of perishable earth and undying spirit. And&#44; 
as soon as created&#44; he was inspired by God with 
knowledge&#44; and was appointed the governor of all 
inferior things&#44; he being the last and the noblest in 
the scale of creatures whom the Lord God created 
on the earth&#59; and thus&#44; so far as concerns our globe&#44; 
the work was finished with the production of man&#44;

at the end of the sixth day&#44; or period&#44; from the com&#8211; 
mencement of things on our planet. In the whole 
progress&#44; in all the various things called into existence&#44; 
the same agency&#44; as we said at first&#44; was alone at 
work&#59; &#34;and God said &#34; is the uniform phrase&#59; and 
the result&#44; &#34; it was so&#44;&#34; crowned the will. Thus have 
we been taught that in all the wide extent of the 
universe there is no associate with the adorable Crea&#8211; 
tor&#44; and hence we cannot bend the knee before any 
shrine which is inscribed with the name of any other 
god&#59; we cannot invoke in prayer any other saviour 
save the mighty and fearful Father&#44; the Lord our 
God. We are the children of but one God &#59; from 
the beginning it was but one Power only who pro&#8211; 
duced&#44; or could produce&#44; all the creatures&#44; the high 
ones who stand at the foot of his throne of glory&#44; 
ready to execute the will of their Master&#44; and the 
children of the earth&#44; whose greatest strength is 
weakness&#44; and who crave his aid in their hour of 
trial. &#8212; And Him alone will we serve&#59; let the world 
frown on us for our faith&#44; or love us as brothers&#44; and 
follow us in our example of fearing alone the God 
of Israel&#44; &#8212; it must be all the same to us&#59; we cannot 
swerve from our allegiance&#44; we cannot forsake our 
Father&#44; who spoke and the world was&#44; who com&#8211; 
manded&#44; and all creation stood forth at his call. &#8212; And 
may lie be with us and our spirit&#44; and bless us as He 
has spoken&#44; with plenty&#44; and with wisdom&#44; and with 
liofht and truth. Amen.

O God &#33; who art miudful of thy covenant&#44; faithful 
and steadfast in thy promises&#44; we call on Thee in all 
ages and in every place as our only Guardian and 
King&#44; as the One from whom proceeds our salvation&#44; 
and who is the Rock of our strength. For who is 
with Thee in heaven &#63; and whom can we find near 
Thee on earth&#63; The other gods&#44; where are they&#63; 
and the saviours&#44; where can they be found &#63; truly 
have we felt and experienced that it is only Thou&#44; the 
unending and undying One&#44; who art alone all&#8211;power&#8211; 
ful&#44;&#8212; omnipotent to punish&#44; and almighty to save&#44; 
and from thy wrath there is no concealing the sinner&#59; 
for all the earth is full of thy glory&#59; and when Thou 
wiliest to bless&#44; there is nothing to stay thy pleasure&#59; 
for all benefits and mercies are in Thy hand. Father 
of eternity &#33; who livest forever. So bless us all with 
thy goodness&#44; and satisfy our souls with thy munifi&#8211; 
cence&#44; and preserve us before Thee&#44; as thy people 
whom Thou hast redeemed&#44; with whom Thou madest 
a covenant of everlasting truth&#44; that they should al&#8211; 
Wiiys obtain thy favour&#44; if they would only lean on 
Thee for support&#44; and call on thy I&#94;ame for forgive&#8211; 
ness and mercy. And&#44; O&#44; let the light of thy counte&#8211; 
nance shine on us&#44; and remove from our midst all the 
ills which afflict us&#44; and grant us thy favour&#44; which is 
life&#44; now and forever. Amen.

Brethren&#33; 

It is well said by men of the world&#44; that the price 
of civil liberty is eternal watchfulness &#59; carelessness 
of our personal rights would soon surrender them to 
the ill usage of designing and crafty oppressors &#59; and 
it is only the vigilance and the jealousy with which 
we watch every approach of tyranny and injustice&#44; 
that enable us to preserve for ourselves the boon of 
self&#8211;government&#44; which is the native right of every 
human being&#44; and of which he cannot be deprived 
without manifest injustice&#44; Now it is nothing un&#8211; 
usual for men to be sedulous in defence of their civil 
freedom &#59; they sacrifice for it life and treasure&#44; and 
assail at other times fiercely those who would rob 
them of it &#59; and the annals of the world are filled with 
details of heroic deeds of the champions of the rights 
of men&#44; and their memory is embalmed as a precious 
legacy to after&#8211;generations. Yet this liberty is not 
the highest boon which we have received from God&#59; 
it is not the best gift which we have obtained&#44; high 
and good though it be. For there is a higher and 
better treasure which is within our reach&#44; and it will&#44; 
when properly appreciated&#44; perfect yet more the ben&#8211; 
efits which the other bestows&#44; &#8212; and this divine thing 
we call RELIGION. It is indeed the light of the soul&#44; 
the guide to eternity&#44; which flourishes best in the 
mind of him who is free from all fear except that for 
his Maker&#59; who is deaf to the allurements of gain&#44; 
of interest&#44; of personal aggrandizement&#44; and who 
heeds no voice which is not the echo of that glorious 
revelation which was heard by our fathers from the 
sunmiit of Mount lloreb&#44; when it was enveloped 
by the brilliant clouds and the blazing fire which

issued from the midst of darkness&#44; when the Majesty 
of lieaven descended unto earth to teach mankind 
wisdom and knowledge &#58; wisdom &#8212; that they might 
be freed from the corruptions of wicked deceivers 
who elevate the creature above the Creator&#44; and 
knowledge &#8212; that they might know how to live in 
accordance with the wishes of the Father of all that 
have breath and spirit. &#8212; Do you wonder then that 
ages have elapsed and the law is still revered &#63; Are 
you astonished that trials and dangers have but riv&#8211; 
etted yet closer the chains which bind us to God &#63; If 
one does love liberty the more&#44; after he has been un&#8211; 
justly held in bondage and compelled to labour for 
those who return no wages for his daily toil&#44; and who 
repay every complaint with the blow of the taskmas&#8211; 
ter&#39;s whip&#59; if one does prize freedom the more 
dearly&#44; after he has been kept locked up within the 
prison&#39;s walls for a defence of the inalienable rights 
of man&#44; with no society save the spider that wove his 
web between the bars of his narrow cell &#59; and who 
heard no pleasant sound save that of the chirping 
bird when he alighted gay and free near the cleft in 
the walls of the dungeon &#59; and who saw no human 
face except the cruel visage of the jailor when he 
brought him his daily scanty portion of bread and 
water&#59; &#8212; ay&#44; do such as these prize the privilege of 
being once more restored to the free enjoyment of 
their natural rights and powers &#58; can the Israelite do 
otherwise than glory in the possession of his religion&#44; 
which has been endeared to him by the multitude of 
struggles which he had to Avage in its defence &#63; by 
the incessant strife against all the hateful passions of 
an ignorant world&#44; who sought to extinguish the

spark of heavenly flame wliicli glows and kindles ever 
a new and brighter light within the recesses of our 
soul&#44; where it is buried deeply&#44; and lives securely&#44; 
sheltered by the inherent strength which our God 
has implanted within us&#44; so that we might be his wit&#8211; 
nesses&#44; and his servants unto the end of days&#63; Unto 
the end of days&#33; monstrous thought&#33; we throw out 
these words as of no particular meaning&#44; as a vague 
conception of something indefinite. But let us define 
them in their literal acceptation &#59; and what do they 
mean &#63; Simply this &#58; that let all on earth perish &#59; let 
the sun be blotted out from the skies &#59; let the moon 
vanish from her orbit&#58; and only then can we cease to 
follow our appointed course&#44; even like these servants 
of God&#44; who will fulfil their mission up to the time 
of their destruction&#44; which is a period so remote by 
the action of natural causes that we cannot estimate 
its arrival&#59; for to our apprehension the earth is built 
upon an immovable basis&#44; that it may not be de&#8211; 
stroyed unto eternity. Yet even so are we to be from 
our organization &#59; this was our destiny&#44; and hitherto 
we have followed it amidst all the danjjers from with&#8211; 
out and rebellion from within&#44; of which oar checkered 
history has furnished the record&#59; and we are left on 
earth to proclaim the same truth which our fathers 
for so many generations delivered down from one to 
the other unto our own days&#59; and we have never yet 
adopted in its place anj&#8211; doctrine or custom which 
had not its foundation in the same faith&#44; which they 
were the instrument of diffusing abroad in the world. 
And hence it is that we call ourselves Israelites at 
this day&#59; that we yet acknowledge that we are ser&#8211; 
vants of the Most Iligh under the law of Sinai &#59; that

we stand in contradiction to all the other nations&#44; who 
do not acquiesce in our line of duty&#44; and teach salva&#8211; 
tion through other means than an obedience to the 
code of Moses&#44; and a belief in dogmas which did not 
descend to us from the calling of Abraham and the 
election of Israel. Let then the world say that you 
have been rejected by your Father&#44; let them say that 
others have been called to testify to God&#39;s glory &#58; wa&#8211; 
ver not&#44; fear not&#44; change not &#59; but tell them that it is 
true that &#8211;we have sinned&#44; that the wrath of God is 
still poured out as it was in former years &#59; but that 
for all this the prophet says&#44; in the name of the Lord &#58; 

&#34; For a small moment have I forsaken thee &#59; but with great mer&#8211; 
cies will I gather thee. &#8212; For the mountains may depart&#44; and the 
hills may be removed &#59; but my kindness shall not depart from thee&#44; 
neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed&#44; saith the Lord 
that hath mercy on thee.&#34; Isaiah liv. 7&#44; 10. 

You will see in these two verses that it was sup&#8211; 
posed probable&#44; in the providence of God&#44; that a time 
would come when the children of Israel should be for 
a time forsaken by their Father on account of their 
neglecting his instruction&#44; of which the j&#41;rophet him&#8211; 
self&#44; whose words we quote&#44; gives us ample illustration&#59; 
nevertheless he adds at once that&#44; although thus for a 
while forsaken&#44; we should be gathered again at the 
awakening of the great mercy which was foreshad&#8211; 
owed by the prophetic visions from the beginning&#59; 

18&#42; 

<pb n="210"/>

210 GUARDING THE FAITH. 

inasmiicli as it is not the intention of the Creator to 
prolong his anger unto all generations&#44; and to let his 
indignation burn without ceasing. And observe the 
conclusion of the prophecy&#59; for there it says&#44; that 
though destruction should overtake the immovable 
hills and mountains&#44; by which the earth would fall 
into decay&#44; the mercy with which God has always re&#8211; 
garded us shall not depart from watching over our 
being&#44; and his covenant of peace shall not be removed 
from us&#44; and this we are assured by the One through 
whose mercies we live though ever so undeserving of 
his favour &#59; undeserving&#44; I say&#44; because we have ne&#8211; 
glected his laws in so many ways&#44; and this whenever 
opportunity presented itself for sin. 

Now let us see what is our duty in this connexion. 
The prophet uses a peculiar phrase as that which is 
not to be removed&#44; it is &#34; the covenant of God&#39;s 
peace.&#34; Words so remarkable cannot have been 
chosen without design&#44; the holy Spirit which spoke 
through the prophets could not have selected an ex&#8211; 
pression so peculiar without intending to convey to 
us grave and serious instruction. Let us then endeav&#8211; 
our to trace the idea here embraced&#44; by the light 
which tlie Scriptures throw on the subject. Kindness&#44; 
the first word used in the impending blessing&#44; is read&#8211; 
ily distinguished as that sentiment of affection Avhich 
one feels for those connected with him by the ties of 
kindred&#44; whom he serves without any thought per&#8211; 
haps of their worthiness or otherwise&#59; it is unbonght 
love which impels the gift&#44; it is to benefit which is 
designed&#44; be the recipients grateful or not&#44; for we 
gratify the impulse which bids us to serve those of 
whom we have the knowledge that they arc ours by 

<pb n="211"/>

GUARDING THE FAITH. 211 

the blood which flows in their veins. Thus then the 
Almighty promises us his kindness&#44; as though we 
Ave re of his own family&#44; to use a word almost profane 
wlien speaking of the Iloly One&#44; were it not that lie 
himself has called Israel &#34;liis firat&#8211;born son&#44;&#34; which 
means those members of the human family in whom 
He has that peculiar interest which a parent naturally 
entertains for the first&#8211;born among his children. So 
that worthy or not&#44; virtuous or sinful we are assured 
that&#42; we shall not be lost sight of by our heavenly 
Father&#59; but that He will watch over and protect us&#44; 
because He delighteth in mercy. But the second 
clause&#44; &#34; the covenant of God&#39;s peace&#44;&#34; must mean 
something in which the Israelites themselves have a 
sphere of action. A covenant is generally speaking a 
contract by which something is conceded for an equiv&#8211; 
alent&#44; where the one who receives the favour is to 
do something in return&#44; however inadequate it may 
be&#44; to that which is bestowed on him. There may 
perhaps be an exception to the general acceptation of 
the term in the institution of the rainbow as a siarn  

of &#34; the covenant between God and every living crea&#8211; 
ture&#44; of all flesh that is upon the earth&#44;&#34; where evi&#8211; 
dently the whole exemption from a recurrence of the 
flood is a mere gracious favour of God&#44; not in any 
manner to be obtained by human actions. Still in 
other places&#44; covenant means a mutual concession&#44; or 
a recompense in other cases for something already 
done. For instance with Abraham it is said&#44; &#34; But 
thou shalt observe my covenant&#59;&#34; with the Sabbath 
it is said&#44; &#34; And the children of Israel shall observe 
the Sabbath&#44; to make the Sabbath throughout their 
generations as an everlasting covenant&#59;&#34; and in the 

<pb n="212"/>

212 GUARDING THE FAITH. 

same manner in many other places. If then it bo 
in our power to do something as contracting parties 
in the covenant of peace promised us here in Isaiah &#58; 
it is evidently quite reasonable that whatever this be 
can be justly demanded of us&#44; in return for the mercy 
received. &#8212; Now the additional word &#34; peace&#44;&#34; as it is 
said &#34; the covenant of my jDcace&#44;&#34; will give us the 
clue to supply the desired answer. We may main&#8211; 
tain as a general principle&#44; that whereas observing 
God&#39;s law confers peace&#44; a state of sin is one of war&#8211; 
fare against the Deity &#59; righteousness is the support 
of the world&#44; whereas sin is its subversion &#59; through 
obedience to God&#39;s commands individuals are accept&#8211; 
ed on Pligh&#44; and nations prosper in their civil and 
domestic relations&#59; whereas through transgressions 
individuals are rejected by the Lord&#44; and strife and 
bloodshed&#44; and tribulations of all kinds&#44; distract entire 
communities and bring to ruin the mightiest empires. 
So then says the prophet &#40;Isaiah Ivii. 21&#41; &#58; &#34; There is 
no peace&#44; saith my God&#44; to the wicked.&#34; Thus also 
in the preceding verse &#58; &#34; But the wicked are like a 
troubled sea&#44; which cannot rest&#44; whose waters cast up 
mire and dirt.&#34; Since the effect of unrighteousness 
is evil&#44; and&#44; whenever the wicked come on the stage 
of life&#44; they are at once in opposition to the peaceful 
reign of the law of God&#44; bringing the workings of 
human passions to bear with an oppressive weight 
upon the good which others&#44; who fear the Most High&#44; 
may attempt to produce. But when righteousness is 
restored to the heart of the sinner&#44; the state of strife 
instantly terminates&#44; he re&#8211;enters into a covenant with 
God&#44; that he will keep the commandments&#44; and call 
down upon himself the blessings which the pious are 

<pb n="213"/>

GUARDING THE FAITH. 213 

to receive at the hand of Supreme Mercy. We are 
therefore told&#44; that when contrition shall have taken 
possession of the heart of man&#44; there shall be &#34; Peace&#44; 
peace to him that is far off&#44; and to him that is near&#59;&#34; 
meaning whether a man have transgressed little&#44; or 
whether he have totally neglected his duties&#44; he will 
h&#8211;ave the divine peace restored to liim&#44; as soon as he 
has been healed of his mental disease by the means 
of righteousness which are so abundantly pointed out 
in the Scriptures. It is our business to return from 
our iniquity&#44; to seek the favour which we have jeop&#8211; 
ardized by our misdeeds&#44; thus restoring the harmony 
which is to subsist in all creation&#44; which is however 
disrupted&#44; whenever sin lifts up her baleful head. 

We are thus enabled to explain satisfactorily the 
significance of the promise we are discussing. It is 
a prediction that a time will come&#44; when there shall 
subsist a covenant of peace between God and Israel&#59; 
not a condition of sin&#44; wherein the Creator is&#44; so to 
say&#44; excluded by men&#39;s own folly from being their 
true Governor&#59; but a state of righteousness wherein 
lie is acknowledii&#94;ed as He is indeed notwithstanding&#58; 
our occasional stubbornness&#44; the Supreme Head of all 
the beings which exist in the whole extent of the 
creation. But of whom is this happy reconciliation 
possible&#63; of whom can it be&#44; nay is it&#44; said&#44; that they 
shall enjoy the divine kindness and be reconciled to 
God and nature through a covenant in which peace 
is founded upon a union with the Lord&#63; It is pre&#8211; 
dicted of the congregation of Israel&#44; who in their 
present state of captivity&#44; isolation&#44; dispersion and 
disunion&#44; are compared to a barren woman who has 
never felt the pains and joys of maternity. This na&#8211;

tlon&#44; thus long neglected&#44; thus so long deemed for&#8211; 
saken&#44; is called on to rejoice at the numerous offspring 
which are to present themselves as its descendants&#44; to 
such a degree that the dwellings&#44; at one time deemed 
ample and strong enough for the small number of 
believers&#44; shall have to be enlarged and strengthened&#44; 
so that there may be room and place for the mighty 
throng who are to hasten again to worship the Lord 
of Hosts&#44; the God of their firthers. Now what does 
this presuppose&#44; but the permanence of the people of 
Israel&#63; And how is this to be effected &#63; Only through 
our constant adherence to God&#44; and by training 
up our children tliat they too may walk in the light 
of the Lord&#44; and transmit again the instruction which 
they have received to those who are to rise up after 
them&#44; to the end of all times&#44; let the age of the world 
be ever so old&#44; ever so far remote. And how are we 
to accomplish this mission &#63; are we to neglect the 
duties which we have been taught to regard as sa&#8211; 
cred &#63; are we to be careless&#44; whether or not the name 
of God be profaned through our means &#63; do we ac&#8211; 
complish our destiny when it may be said of us with 
justice &#58; &#34; Behold&#44; these men call themselves the 
chosen of the Lord&#44; and see how they neglect their 
religion &#33; see how their places of business are open 
on the days they call holy &#33; see how they are not to 
be distinguished in their religious acts from other 
men &#33; see how they slight the social duties and laws 
of personal holiness which their faith demands of 
them&#63;&#34; Is it possible that in this ma&#44;nner we can be 
justitied before God&#63; be considered even just before 
men &#63; And yet it is for the paltry object often of being 
less ridiculous in the eyes of mortals like ourselves&#44; 

<pb n="215"/>

GUARDING THE FAITH. 215 

that we hide and conceal our religion as something 
to be ashamed of&#59; that we may pass in the crowd as 
other men&#44; as persons not belonging to the house of 
Israel&#44; as though our religion could&#44; with any degree 
of justice&#44; bring upon us shame and disgrace. Per&#8211; 
haps this shyness may be a remnant of the dread 
WTLth which we regarded&#44; in times of persecution&#44; all 
non&#8211;Israelites&#44; when all gentiles&#44; almost without any 
exception&#44; had to be looked upon as enemies to the 
Jews&#59; since nearly every hand was raised up to strike 
us down to the earth&#44; when compassion towards a 
child of Israel was well&#8211;nigh held as a crime in the 
then moral aspect of a vast majority of mankind. 
But let me ask you&#44; &#34;What reason have we to assign 
now&#44; especially in this land of religious liberty&#44; of 
constitutional freedom&#44; for hiding our principles in a 
corner&#63; in shrinking from a public profession of 
what we believe to be true&#44; of openly doing what we 
believe to be right and proper &#63; O&#44; that we had the 
same pride in our religion which so many sectarians 
feel &#33; 0&#44; that we had the same energy to diffuse a 
knowledge of our tenets&#44; which the zealous ones of 
other persuasions display so much to our shame&#44; so 
greatly to our confusion &#33; Is our cause less deserving 
of zeal than theirs&#44; that we are so lukewarm in its 
defence&#44; so careless about its propagation &#63; IIow&#44; I 
demand&#44; are the children&#44; the pledges which the Lord 
has entrusted to your safekeeping&#44; to become firm and 
true Israelites&#44; if their parents are so slothful in their 
education &#63; so remiss in training them to the true 
way by precept and example &#63; how are they to be&#8211; 
come participants in the future glory of our race&#44; to 
be members of the covenant of God&#39;s peace&#44; if they

are left to stray&#44; through ignorance&#44; from the fold of 
the great Shepherd&#44; to become a prey to the devour&#8211; 
ing wolves who are constantly watching their steps&#44; 
and lay snares that they may be caught and torn 
away from their faith &#63; You say&#44; perhaps&#44; &#34; We let 
our children know they are Jews&#59; we teach them 
their praj&#8211;ers&#59; they are made acquainted with the 
Hebrew&#59; we t&#94;ll them to honour their Sabbath&#44; and 
to attend public worship.&#34; But this is not enough. 
You must endeavour to make them proud of the priv&#8211; 
ilege of being Jews &#59; they ought to be made to feel 
that it is a blessing to be a scion of Israel&#44; a member 
of that people who are blessed above all others with 
the possession of a law which is derived from heaven&#44; 
which is free from error&#44; based on truth&#44; and promo&#8211; 
tive of all that is good and blissful. And &#33; never 
let it be laid to your charge&#44; that you gave them 
cause for apostacy&#44; that you led them to sin by your 
conversation&#44; by your ridiculing the principles and 
practices of Judaism &#59; never let it be on your con&#8211; 
sciences&#44; when the hand of sickness lies heavily on 
you&#44; or when death stands near to bear ofi&#42; your soul 
to the judgment&#8211;seat of your Creator&#44; that you con&#8211; 
tributed in the least to the lamentable result that one 
of your descendants should be wanting in the con&#8211; 
gregation of Israel. And when the dread Judge&#44; 
the Lord of all spirits&#44; comes to number his flock&#44; to 
select those who are his&#44; to cause those to dwell in his 
presence who are holy &#58; let Him not have to frown on 
you&#44; because that you led astray unto foreign pastures 
the lambs entrusted to your watchful keeping&#59; and 
be it the business of your hfe&#44; to have all faithful&#44;

whomsoever you can influence by your instruction&#44; by 
your authority&#44; and by your example&#44; in order that the 
servants of the Lord may be many&#44; and all Israel be 
benetitted by your exertions. Nor should you say&#44; 
&#34; What use can our actions be &#63; we are humble&#44; we 
are ignorant&#44; we are poor &#59; who heeds our words &#63; 
who regards our admonition &#63;&#34; In this you deceive 
yourselves &#59; act your part&#44; fulfil faithfully your mis&#8211; 
sion&#44; and consider well that the Lord requires all his 
servants to labour &#59; to Him no one is high &#59; in his 
regard no one is low &#59; for the highest among men is 
nothing compared to his greatness&#44; and the lowliest 
is a participant of his care and providence. So then 
teach and exhort&#44; act and guide&#44; however lowly you 
are&#59; and the hearts of many may be warmed&#44; excited 
to a better impulse &#59; and as a small portion of leaven&#44; 
however unsightly&#44; leavens a whole dough&#44; so may 
you be instrumental&#44; unknown to yourselves&#44; to give 
an impulse to some one near you&#44; by which means 
more and more may be gradually drawn into the sa&#8211; 
cred influence&#44; to be&#44; like yourselves&#44; servants of the 
Most High. Equally foolish would it be in those oc&#8211; 
cupying an elevated position to imagine that they 
could not be expected to labour&#44; like the humble&#44; in 
the cause of their religion &#59; or that there existed for 
their children any exemption from the active duties 
incumbent on Israelites in general. For they are all 
subject to the same laws&#44; descended from the same 
honoured ancestry&#44; and as Israelites only can they 
participate&#44; at the end of the warfare of our race&#44; in 
the good which the Lord has promised us. And 
how do we know what may result from any act of 
our own &#63; can we foresee&#44; and therefore set bounds

beforehand&#44; to the consequences of our deeds&#63; can 
we penetrate into the ramifications of ultimate re&#8211; 
sults from a given cause &#63; No one of us can know 
aught of all this. It is evident&#33;y&#44; therefore&#44; our sa&#8211; 
cred obligation to contribute to the permanence and 
glory of Israel by every means in our power&#44; and to 
rest satisfied with nothing less than a continual striv&#8211; 
ing in the fulfilment of the duty expressed in the 
words of the law&#44; &#34;And I will be sanctified in the 
midst of the children of Israel.&#34; 

Brethren &#33; Let us act as we will&#44; we cannot destroy 
the identity of Israel&#59; it is not so much a constantly 
newly produced miracle which causes this result&#44; as 
the nature of the religion which God gave to our 
fathers. Just as the sun receives not daily a ricw 
light&#44; but shines on with the luminous power impart&#8211; 
ed to him at the creation &#58; so does Israel work on in 
the path designed for it through the mental light 
which was imparted to it from Sinai. &#94; But it is the 
preservation of the individuals to which you&#44; broth&#8211; 
ers and sisters of our noble people&#44; are called on to 
contribute&#59; let this be your task&#44; your whole striv&#8211; 
ing&#44; the problem of your life&#59; so will your descend&#8211; 
ants and disciples&#44; to the last generation&#44; become 
participants in the covenant of peace through right&#8211; 
eousness&#44; which the Lord has made and will renew 
with us all&#44; and thus will none of your oftspring be 
absent when the God of heaven and earth will bless 
us and all mankind&#44; but chiefly us of Israel&#44; with 
abundance of peace at the coming of the son of 
David. Amen.

220 our political obligations. 

Brethren &#33; 

When Isaac&#44; our ancestor&#44; dwelt in tlie land of the 
Pbilistuies&#44; he was driven away by the authorities of 
the country because he had become too powerful for 
them&#59; perhaps in the then sparse state of the popula&#8211; 
tion of Philistia&#44; an enterprising chief who like Abra&#8211; 
ham could arm three hundred and eisrhteen inmates 
of his house whenever he needed their services&#44; and 
which power was doubtless possessed by Isaac like&#8211; 
wise&#44; although it is not so distinctly staled&#44; might in 
a measure become dangerous to the existing govern&#8211; 
ments in the various districts&#44; governed as each of 
them were by a separate king or chief&#44; should he 
deem it comporting with his interest to join either a 
domestic faction who might rebel against the regular 
authorities&#44; or some foreign enemy&#44; who&#44; as was the 
custom in that early period of the history of man&#44; 
might invade the country for conquest or mere love 
of plunder. It was&#44; therefore&#44; probably no personal 
dislike to our peaceful prog&#8211;enitor&#44; so much as the 
dread of what he might become&#44; were he so disposed&#44; 
which induced the king Ahimelech to tell him to go 
away from the capital of his small dominions&#44; because 
he had literally grown too powerful for the safety of 
the state. Xevertheless&#44; Isaac obeyed the royal man&#8211; 
date&#44; though he might have remained against the 
wishes of the king&#44; if we consider his numerous ret&#8211; 
inue and the attachment which his servants evidently 
felt for him&#59; he set an example of submission to law&#8211; 
ful authority although he was personally put to great 
inconvenience by so doing&#44; and like his eminent father 
he went to dwell in tents&#44; and devoted his attention 
to agriculture and the improvement of the soil&#59; and

though constantly foiled by the malevolence of the 
country people&#44; who disputed unjustly the possession 
of the wells which he had caused to be dug&#44; under 
the plea that the water was theirs&#44; he persevered in 
his peaceful walk of life &#58; till at length all opposition 
ceased against a man Avho&#44; whilst fearlessly doing what 
is just&#44; disdained to use violence to maintain his 
right through the power which he possessed&#44; and who 
recognized the even doubtful rights of others&#44; sooner 
than let the sword be the arbiter of their disputes. 
It was indeed with him the triumph of the pious mind 
which we are called on to admire&#59; the patient per&#8211; 
severance which&#44; leaning on God for support&#44; could 
well await the issue of the contest in which he was 
engaged despite of his peaceful temperament. And 
the cud was as the whole tenor of the Bible teaches 
u&#94;5&#44; that it will always be well with the righteous&#44; often 
in this life even&#59; and the blessing of the Lord was 
vouchsafed to him&#59; inasmuch as on removing a short 
distance from the valley of Gerar he dug another well&#44; 
of which the Philistines no longer contested his right 
of possession&#44; and he called it&#44; therefore&#44; Bcchoboth&#44; 
from the root 3m rachab&#44; broad&#44; signifying that then 
the Lord had given him ample room&#44; and that he 
and his household could&#44; therefore&#44; increase in the 
land. And the consequence of the action of Isaac is 
next given us in the narrative which follows&#44; being 
in effect that Abimelech with his general and friend 
came to him from Gerar&#59; and upon question of the 
patriarch why they sought hira out in his retirement&#44; 
since from their hatred to him&#44; as he had good reason 
to think it&#44; they had sent him away from their midst&#63; 
they replied that they had come only to make a treaty

of mutual peace with liira&#44; so that he&#44; thougli uow 
even mightier than before&#44; should do them no evil&#44; 
inasmuch as they had done him no bodily harm wlien 
banishing him from Gerar&#44; and shown him kindness 
before they sent him away&#59; for&#44; they added&#44; 

&#34;Thou art now one blessed of the Lord.&#34; Gen. xxvL 29&#44; 

They acknowledged in this manner that the pros&#8211; 
perity which he enjoyed was the effect of an imme&#8211; 
diate divine blessing&#44; seeing that under all adverse 
circumstances&#44; whether this was from the hindrance 
laid in his way by men&#44; or the unfavourable state of 
the country wdierein he toiled&#44; his success was more 
than any one had ever estimated&#44; and since he bore 
his prosperity in such a way that no injury resulted 
thence to any one around him. All this induced the 
chiefs of Philistia to desire the friendship of the God&#8211; 
favoured stranger&#59; and he at once&#44; forgetting the ban&#8211; 
ishment which he had suffered at their hands&#44; and the 
violent seizure of his wells&#44; swore unto them a cove&#8211; 
nant of peace&#44; and they departed from him as friends 
to their homes. 

Shall not the history of Isaac have a powerful in&#8211; 
fluence on us&#44; on all Israelites wherever they may 
dwell&#63; Reflect&#44; brethren&#44; the Bible is given us for 
instruction&#59; it is not merely an idle curiosity which is 
to be gratitied by the various narratives which it con&#8211; 
tains&#59; but it is intended that we should thence draw 
lessons for life&#44; in order that we may be improved by 
the example of the holy ones who lived before us&#44; and 

<pb n="223"/>

OUR POLITICAL OBLIGATIONS. 223 

become distinguished in our words and actions as a 
X&#94;cople taught and saved by the Lord&#44; the Shield of 
our salvation and the Sword of our excellency&#44; as the 
holy One is called in reference to us by the great 
prophet when giving us his last charge&#44; the moment 
before he was concealed from the eyes of the living. 
Not less&#44; therefore&#44; than other passages in Scripture 
is the history of Isaac calculated to give us lessons 
of holiness. It is indeed an unobtrusive narrative&#44; 
of a quiet man who never performed any great deeds 
in his life&#59; who never roamed far from the place of 
his birth&#44; and sought no renown by remarkable or 
romantic adventures. His was not the bold spirit of 
nis father Abraham&#44; nor had he the patient endurance 
of his renowned son Jacob&#44; by which this one rose 
superior to difficulties which would have crushed 
weaker minds&#44; or bodily constitutions less firm and 
less able to bear up against fatigue and exposure. 
ISTotwithstanding&#44; we have in Isaac an example of an&#8211; 
other kind&#44; that of a uniform faithfulness and honesty 
of purpose throughout a long if not eventful life&#44; and 
have thus exhibited to us a chart&#44; we may call it&#44; of 
the duties which fall to the lot of all men. Great 
deeds&#44; such as the bold rupture with the idolaters of 
his time on the part of Abraham&#44; the fearless public 
preaching of the truth which his heart so deeply 
treasured up by the father of the faithful&#44; can only 
be rarely witnessed&#59; for even if the men were there 
to do these great acts&#44; the opportunities would not 
offer themselves at all times and at all places. With 
the times and emergencies&#44; men equal to grapple with 
them will ever be forthcoming to the light of day&#59; 
they will emerge from the masses of beings around

them&#44; and show by the power inherent in them that 
they are destined by Providence to rule the storm&#44; 
and to ride upon the angry waves of public commo&#8211; 
tion. But in times of quietness&#44; when no great crisis 
impends over the affairs of men&#44; the minds&#44; endowed 
with greatness&#44; may quietly rule by their inherent 
superiority over others&#59; but they cannot acquire that 
far&#8211;reaching and preeminent station which times of 
danger&#44; revolution&#44; and high excitement alone can 
produce. Although it may be granted that genius of 
a high order will create in some shape or other the 
opportunities for display&#44; for this is a portion of 
the endowment which it receives from the hand of 
Creative Power&#58; it is nevertheless undeniable that 
its range is limited by the atmosphere in which it 
breathes&#44; and the circumstances of the times in which 
it is called on the stage of life. So that&#44; however 
much we may be excited to admiration by the acts 
of tlie threat luminaries which have shed their lus&#8211; 
trous light over the history of the human race&#44; we 
may sigh in vain in the utter hopelessness of ever be&#8211; 
coming like them. N&#34;o.one may dream&#44; in his wildest 
reveries&#44; of being an Abraham&#44; a Moses&#44; a David&#44; or 
an Isaiah &#59; it is only the few&#44; who are to be a light to 
the world&#44; who reach the eminence on which they were 
placed &#58; and yet each one had a quality peculiarly his 
own to which the others did not attain. There are&#44; 
however&#44; deeds in which all can excel&#44; there are 
eminences which all can reach &#59; there are qualities 
of the heart and mind which all can acquire as their 
own &#58; so that no one need sigh or grieve that it is not 
given to him to be of the exalted&#44; of those whose 
names are familiar household&#8211;words to all men&#44; and 

<pb n="225"/>

whose cliaracters Lave become the conimon property 
of all mankind. Mortals may perhaps imagine that 
their cause has not been properly adjudged by their 
Maker in thus elevating the few to an unapproachable 
height&#59; yet in good truth it is not for their own sake 
that they were distinguished&#44; but the general benefit 
of all&#59; great deeds were demanded&#44; and they became 
the agents of Heaven to effect his high behests &#59; in&#8211; 
struments were needed&#44; and the Creator selected 
those whom He found endowed with the proper spirit 
to work out the regeneration of mankind. It is in&#8211; 
deed something exalted to be so distinguished as 
Moses was&#59; nevertheless it was an especial divine 
guidance which&#44; after all his greatness of soul and 
strength of intellect&#44; enabled him to fulfil the mission 
for which he had been chosen&#59; and this he teaches us 
in almost every line of the books which he was or&#8211; 
dered to write for our instruction. So then mankind 
at large must necessarily labour according to the in&#8211; 
scrutable decrees of Providence&#44; each one in his 
assigned sphere of limited capacity and usefulness&#59; 
and only according as he exerts himself well and 
cheerfully up to the utmost capacity he has received 
will he be accepted as having accomplished the full 
measure of his duty&#59; and then when the Lord appor&#8211; 
tions the reward which He has in store for his serv&#8211; 
ants&#44; will each one receive that precise recompense 
which his honesty of purpose deserves&#59; i.t will not be 
so much the amount as the manner of the perform&#8211; 
ance&#44; which will be the standard of merit before the 
One who creates the heart and knows all its imper&#8211; 
fections. 

So then we have in the lives of the Patriarchs 

<pb n="226"/>

various degrees of greatness &#59; that of a bold awaken&#8211; 
ing of mankind on the part of Abraham &#59; the firm 
resistance to unexpected misfortunes without for&#8211; 
saking his innocence on the part of Jacob&#59; and the 
acceptability through unostentatious righteousness in 
the person of Isaac. ISTow let us see how his life is 
sketched to us in the usual few rapid strokes of the 
pen of the sacred historian&#44; who in teaching us em&#8211; 
ploy&#39;s but a limited number of words to finish his pic&#8211; 
tures&#44; so that we might be induced to think over what 
is given to us&#44; not peruse it lightly as a mere amusing 
narrative or pleasantly wrought up sketches of inte&#8211; 
resting characters. &#8212; Isaac&#44; like us his descendants&#44; 
was a sojourner in the land Avhich he inhabited&#59; his 
native place was probably the neighbourhood of Beer&#8211; 
sheba&#44; where we find that Abraham was settled soon 
after the birth of his son &#59; at all events Philistia was 
not the land he considered his home&#59; this was the 
country of Canaan which had been assigned to him 
as his inheritance&#44; and the future theatre of his chil&#8211; 
dren&#39;s greatness. We have already shown that he 
was a powerful chieftain&#44; whose wealth and numerous 
retinue appeared dangerous to the rulers of the state. 
&#94;Nevertheless we see him paying prompt obedience to 
an unjust decree&#44; not wishing to shed human blood&#44; 
and because he deemed it his duty to submit to the 
legal authorities of the country&#8211;&#44; although injuriously 
afi&#58;ccted by them. Moreover he devoted himself to 
the improvement of the soil&#44; commenced agriculture 
on an extensive scale&#44; although informed through the 
prophecy which had been revealed to his immediate 
progenitor that his descendants should become stran&#8211; 
gers in a land not theirs&#44; and that they should be held 

<pb n="227"/>

OUR POLITICAL OBLIGATIONS. 227 

to labour for a long period. Consequently he must 
have been convinced that all improvement he might 
make would&#44; before long&#44; fall to the share of those 
among whom he temporarily lived. Notwithstand&#8211; 
ing this he devoted much energy to the permanent 
improvement of the country&#44; not alone by tilling the 
soil and raising cattle&#44; but by opening again the wells 
which in their malicious spite and envy the senseless 
Philistines had filled with earth after the death of 
Abraham who had first caused them to be dug. Any 
one acquainted with the nature of the country in and 
around Palestine&#44; must readily acknowledge that no 
greater blessing can be conferred upon the husband&#8211; 
man there&#44; than to give him a full supply of water&#44; in&#8211; 
asmuch as rain is unfrequent in summer&#44; and since in 
seasons of drought this necessary element often entirely 
disappears from the running brooks. So let us even 
admit that both patriarchs had the wells in question 
made for the use of their numerous flocks in the first 
instance &#58; there can be for all that no question that 
they conferred a permanent benefit in the country of 
their adoption&#59; since they gave the farmers places of 
access for irrigating their fields&#44; should the rains of 
heaven fail or the dew not sufficiently moisten the 
thirsting soil&#44; and to the shepherds pleasant cisterns 
whither they might lead their flocks&#44; to give them 
drink out of the troughs left there by their perhaps 
unknown benefactors. &#8212; After all when Isaac had sub&#8211; 
mitted to every sort of insult&#59; when he had yielded 
his previous labour to those who were either too indo&#8211; 
lent to help themselves or had not sufiicient scientific 
knowledge to sink wells&#44; he was ready at the first word 
of conciliation to make peace and renew friendship 

<pb n="228"/>

228 OUR POLITICAL OBLIGATIONS. 

with those who had wrongfully thought that he would 
harhour views inimical to the interests of the state&#59; 
and he forgave them all the vexations and injuries 
tliey had caused him&#44; without even demanding com&#8211; 
pensation for the losses he had sustained through 
their wrong&#8211;doing. &#8212; The malevolence of the Philis&#8211; 
tines had in vain been exercised to check the prog&#8211; 
ress of Isaac&#59; no matter what they did&#44; no matter 
how many obstacles they threw in his way&#44; he suc&#8211; 
ceeded beyond all sanguine calculations &#59; he grew 
not less in moral greatness at the same time than in 
worldly prosperity&#59; and with every new trial he had 
a greater opportunity for showing in his quiet way 
the great superiority of a follower of the true God 
over those who worshipped the vanities and follies of 
human invention. In the midst of anticipated failure 
the servant of God prospered abundantly&#44; and though 
urged by the sting of wrong suffered to use the carnal 
power and seek redress for grievance by his own 
might&#44; he submitted patiently until it should please 
God to grant him enlargement. The heathens them&#8211; 
selves had thus an undeniable proof that their former 
enemy. enemy they deemed him though he had done 
them no wrong&#44; was one protected by that great Power 
whom Abraham had proclaimed in former years&#44; and 
to whose Name many altars had been erected by that 
great light in his wanderings through the land. They 
had all learned that his power was great&#44; that of right 
He deserved the adoration of mortals&#44; though in the 
perverseness of their heart they still had not adopted 
his service. As one then blessed by the Eternal&#44; the 
God of Abraham&#44; they now viewed the man they had 
so fearfully tried&#44; and demanded his friendship as one 

<pb n="229"/>

whom events had proved the blessed of the Lord&#59; 
and as a servant of this&#44; the Most High&#44; was Isaac 
induced to swear them in truth&#44; and they departed 
from him in peace. 

Let US apply the lesson here given to ourselves. 
We like our ancestors are wanderers from our dis&#8211; 
tant home&#59; speak to us of the freedom we enjoy&#59; 
of the privileges whicli are accorded to us by the 
potentates of the earth &#58; we still may say&#44; the Israel&#8211; 
ites land is that of the olive and vine&#44; the citron 
and myrtle&#44; of the palm&#44; the rose and the cedar&#59; 
where the skies are bright&#44; and the earth is fruitful 
from the springs of the earth and the plenteous 
showers and dews of heaven. Ay&#44; now it lies deso&#8211; 
late&#44; its cisterns are broken&#44; its terraces are swept 
away&#44; and thorns choke up its fountains&#44; and thistles 
wave in triumph over fields where once rose and fell 
the waves of a rich corn&#8211;harvest&#44; as it bowed and bent 
before the pleasant breeze that swept over the beau&#8211; 
tiful landscape. Ay&#44; its inhabitants are far away&#44; 
scattered to the four winds of heaven&#44; wanderers 
wherever the ocean laves a distant shore&#44; scattered 
wherever the sun shines on the face of the earth&#59; 
speaking the language of every people&#44; and obeying 
the laws of every land. Long has this state endured&#59; 
changes have passed over the fate of our race&#59; still 
we constantly think of the days that are past&#44; and 
of the glorious hopes which the Bible has given us&#59; 
we believe&#44; and therefore do we speak&#44; that a day 
will come when the wilderness shall bloom&#44; and the 
waste places shall be built up&#44; and the government be 
restored as aforetimes. But what should we be in 
the meanwhile in all the lands where we live &#63; Even

as was Isaac in Philistia&#44; although he knew&#44; as we 
know now&#44; that a future fall of peace&#44; and freedom&#44; 
and light&#44; is before us&#44; that he should suffer in his 
descendants the horrors of slavery and oppression 
before the fixed period for redemption. The divine 
Providence&#44; thus impending&#44; did not inspire him 
with a moody recklessness of the passing hour&#44; not 
with hatred to the unbelievers among whom he 
lived&#59; on the contrary&#44; we have seen how he laboured 
faithfully and successfully to promote his worldly 
prosperity thereby contributing to the good of the 
state&#44; whilst he displayed a character full of love&#44; for&#8211; 
bearance and forgiveness to those who differed from 
him in religion. He remembered that&#44; as a true ser&#8211; 
vant of God&#44; he was bound to omit nothing by which 
the name of the Lord might be honoured&#59; and we 
have seen also that he succeeded in this noble effort. 
Let us&#44; therefore&#44; also act in this manner. Let us 
contribute to the welfare of every state in which we 
liappen to live&#59; omit no opportunity of showing a 
ready obedience to the laws &#59; aid cheerfully towards 
supporting the burdens of the state&#44; in whatever 
manner we can&#44; and never be guilty of breaches of 
the laws&#44; by which we could justly draw upon our&#8211; 
selves public animadversions&#44; or the punishments 
which the criminal codes may prescribe. As Israel&#8211; 
ites&#44; in short&#44; we are bound to seek the peace of the 
country wherein our lot is cast&#44; and we cannot in&#8211; 
fringe against this solemn civil duty without&#44; at the 
same time&#44; violating the positive injunction of our 
Scriptures&#44; and neglect the example of our fathers. 
Let our enemies say that we are aliens to the state&#44; 
that&#44; as we hope for a national reunion&#44; we have no

interest in any other country than Palestine&#59; but tell 
them&#44; that wherever we are&#44; we are by the dispensa&#8211; 
tion of God &#59; whatever land we live in&#44; we consider 
our fatherhind up to the moment in which it may 
please the Lord to simimon us away&#59; our religious 
hopes have no concern whatever with our political 
duties&#44; and consequently cannot aifect&#44; with any de&#8211; 
gree of justice&#44; our political rights. &#33;N&#34;o Jew can 
consistently with his religious obligations defraud the 
revenues&#44; or transgress the statute&#8211;laws of any state&#44; 
however unjust he may deem them to his personal 
interest &#59; he is willing to be obedient in all things&#44; 
save when this should come in conflict with his duties 
to God&#44; since no human laws can exact from him an 
unfaithfulness to his religion. Within this range&#44; the 
Israelite is from duty and inclination obedient to the 
laws of all lands&#59; and what citizen or subject can be 
more so&#63; why then should strangers regard him with 
suspicion&#44; because on a speculative doctrinal point he 
entertains views of his own&#44; which can at the same 
time never come in conflict Avith his social obliga&#8211; 
tions &#63; Thus may you meet objections that are urged 
against you&#59; but never renounce your hopes&#44; either 
to obtain favour from the gentiles&#44; or to appear ready 
to assimilate with them in your opinions. You may 
value your future destinies but lightly&#59; you maybe 
yourselves indifierent about what is to happen at the 
end of days&#59; but your indifierence and unbelief do 
not destroy the power of God to efiect his purpose &#59; 
and the future will as surely become history&#44; the pre&#8211; 
diction will become fulfilment&#44; as the past has hitherto 
faithfully corresponded with the declared intentions 
of the Lord. Read the records of the past&#44; and un&#8211;

belief must stand rebuked&#59; and if you do not under&#8211; 
stand how die fulfilment of the promises is to bo 
brought about&#44; confess your own want of knowledge&#44; 
but do not limit the power of the Creator&#44; or assert 
that lie is unwilling and unable to execute all wliich 
He has spoken. 

But whilst you thus do your duty as citizens of the 
world&#44; forget not that you must follow faithfully in 
the path of duty as Jews which your rehgion marks 
out to you. You should be consistent in your pro&#8211; 
fessions and actions&#44; so that no man should be able to 
charge you with dishonouring your faith by an open 
neglect of its precepts. Be herein&#44; too&#44; like your 
ancestor. He lived alone with his household among&#58; 
idolaters&#59; yet he contrived to combine the duties of 
the citizen with those of the follower of the One 
Supreme. Do so in your own persons. Love your 
neighbours of whatever creed&#59; assist them in their 
distress&#44; comfort them in their sorrow&#44; and let j&#8211;our 
plighted word be the most sacred pledge&#44; by never 
violating it in letter or spirit. Let your yea be yea&#44; 
and your no&#44; no &#59; truth without disguise&#44; fairness and 
candour in your intercourse with the world&#44; should 
preeminently characterize all who profess to believe in 
Him whom Isaac reverenced. At the same time let it 
be your constant striving to bring your civil character 
in strict conformity and agreement with your religious 
obligation&#59; Ibrcgo all offices the execution of which 
would compel you to violate your duty to God&#59; rather 
prefer obscurity than purchase distinction by becom&#8211; 
ing strangers to the sanctuary of t&#41;ur Fatliei&#8211;. In short 
do every thing so&#44; that should evil or good betide you&#44; 
the gentiles may be compelled to acknowledge that.

turns liis thanks for the many mercies which he had 
received from the Giver of all good&#44; and in the midst 
of the outpouring of his grateful feelings he says &#58; 

&#34;All the kings of the earth shall thank thee&#44; O Lord&#33; because 
thejr have heard the words of thy mouth.&#34; Ps. cxxxviii. 4. 

And well may we say&#44; that daily the inspired hopes 
of the prophet&#8211;poet of Israel are becoming more and 
more fulfilled. Who in his day called on the Father 
of all &#63; &#34;What nation save the Hebrews&#44; knew then 
of the words of the Lord &#63; Who did not amons&#58; the 
gentiles ascribe power to the inventions of his own 
fancy&#44; the works of the hands of man&#44; of gold and 
silver&#44; of wood and of stone &#63; But since his time the 
people whom he was ordained to guide&#44; as a shepherd

the great God who had so long protected them&#44; and 
shown them mercies without number&#59; and thej&#8211; were 
driven out of their peaceful folds by the devouring 
beasts of the forest&#44; and many of them were torn in 
pieces bythe claws of the lion&#44; or were given as food 
to the liungry night&#8211;wolf And yet they perished not 
all &#59; and the more they were given to slaughter&#44; the 
farther the&#94;&#8211; were scattered&#44; the more extensively be&#8211; 
came their law and their God known and revered 
among the nations&#44; and truly may we afiirm&#44; that 
through our wounds healing has been carried unto 
many nations&#59; since they learned first from us&#44; then 
afterwards from each other&#44; some of the truths of our

law&#44; and they have become convinced&#44; &#34;that the Lord 
is the God in the heavens above and in the earth be&#8211; 
neath&#59; there is none else.&#34; It is true&#44; that they have 
not totally been freed from error and misconception 
of divine truths&#59; that still they worship not as we do&#59; 
that tlicv even now do not call on the One 2&#58;reat and 
tremendous Name&#44; before whom the angels tremble&#44; 
and the servants in the celestial sanctuary stand in 
dread and awe &#58; nevertheless we may affirm that many 
hearts are turned to seek the way of the Lord from 
the book of life which He lirst imparted to us&#59; and 
that&#44; though they are not Israelites&#44; and perhaps pity 
or hate us because that we do not share their ideas 
of the godhead&#44; or with ihem neglect the positive 
precepts of the law&#44; they still are visibly tinctured 
with our morality and guided by the selfsame moral 
precepts of universal love which breathes through the 
pages of the holy Scriptures. If this is the case with 
the imperfect adoption of our belief&#44; mixed up as the 
popular opinions are with much that we must reject 
as incompatible with the evident meaning of the 
words of our sacred text&#58; how great will needs be the 
universal change&#44; and how unspeakable the general 
happiness&#44; when once the law of Heaven becomes the 
sole and universal standard of right&#44; and the only 
arbiter between man and man&#44; and teaches all alike 
how to fear&#44; how to worship God. If already so 
many kings of nations and mighty empires call on 
the Lord&#44; and cast away the dependence they formerly 
felt on things which are not god &#58; how much more 
universal must this state become when all the kings 
of the earth shall have heard the words of the mouth 
of the Lord&#44; the true words which lie proclaimed

from Sinai&#44; when his redeemed servants stood as&#8211; 
sembled&#44; with their wives and little ones&#44; to hear the 
commands of their almighty King and everlasting 
Father&#44; when they became bonnd to Ilim by chains 
which no time can disrupt&#44; which no rust can eat up 
in the lapse of centuries. And the very institution&#44; 
which has grown almost universal in this country&#44; 
of having annual days of thanksgiving to thank the 
Lord of the harvest for his goodness in providing 
abundance and plenty&#44; proves in a great degree that 
the people of this land have truly imbibed a portion 
of the character of a God&#8211;fearing nation &#59; inasmuch 
as they are ready to acknowledge their dependence 
upon the great Power by whose fiat the world was 
called into being&#44; the same Power who made himself 
known to our fathers&#44; and spoke unto Israel from 
amidst the tire and the darkness. 

It is&#44; thereibre&#44; a beautiful sight&#44; and a soul&#8211;elevat&#8211; 
ing circumstance to a true child of Israel&#44; that the 
chief mao&#8211;istratcs of so manv states&#44; seeins&#94; that the 
Lord has blessed the land in his great mercy with 
whatever can subserve to the well&#8211;being of the in&#8211; 
habitants&#44; have recommended this day as a general 
day of thanksgiving&#44; that all men&#44; laying aside their 
usual avocations&#44; should resort to their places of wor&#8211; 
ship&#44; and there return their thanks to the Bestower 
of all the good they enjoy&#44; and to acknowledge their 
dependence upon tlie Creator and the Governor of 
the universe. There is no sectarianism in this hu&#8211; 
miliation&#59; there is no sectional ditference in this gen&#8211; 
eral homage to the great first Cause from whom all 
have sprung&#58; we&#44; therefore&#44; sons of Jacob&#44; who have 
no hope save in the Lord of heaven and earth&#44; who

know of no saviour except the God of Abraham&#44; can 
readily unite with our fellow&#8211;citizens of other and 
differing creeds&#44; and hie us to our houses of assembly&#44; 
and there pour out our expressions of the gratitude 
which we feel for the many mercies which we have 
received in common with others&#44; thongli we be unde&#8211; 
serving in the e&#94;&#94;es of the Supreme Judge of the world. 
Let us survey the wliole extent of this vast country &#58; 
and what does meet our eye &#63; Plenty&#44; in the fullest 
sense of the word&#59; everywhere the harvest has been 
abundant&#44; and no thought of famine terrifies the 
dwellers in even the distant settlements&#44; where civil&#8211; 
ization is just battling with savage nature&#44; and where 
the trees are just beginning to fall before the blows 
of the axe of the enterprising backwoodsman&#44; where 
not long ago the wily red man ensnared the fox&#44; or 
hunted the proud buffalo&#44; under whose hoof tlie wil&#8211; 
derness shakes&#44; or entrapped near the lonely stream 
of the great solitudes the industrious beaver. Gaunt 
famine&#44; and grim death the result of starvation&#44; may 
terrify other lands&#59; elsewhere may be heard the 
moaning of unfed labourers&#44; whose unrequited toil 
affords them not sufficient for the support of their 
dependent families&#59; but here food is abundant&#44; and 
the hand of industry is not palsied by the inadequate 
supply ot nourishment which strengthens the arm&#44; 
and lends weight to the artisan&#39;s hammer&#44; and speeds 
the plough of him who tills the soil. &#8212; Elsewhere 
people pine under oppression&#59; they fear to labour&#44; 
because bands of plunderers lurk in bypaths and on 
the highways&#44; to reap where they sowed not&#44; and to 
carry off the vintage where they did not prune the 
vine. But here you may travel whithersoever it be

your pleasure to go&#59; you need not arm yourselves 
against the thieving Bedouin&#44; or be in dread of the dar&#8211; 
ing Turcoman&#59; but you can intrust your seed to the 
ground in the almost certain expectation of carrying 
home your harvest in its proper season&#44; and to store 
up for your own household the fruits of your industry&#44; 
with no fear of a tyrant to seize on your persons&#44; and 
to appropriate to his own use what you have pro&#8211; 
duced for the support of your household. &#8212; Elsewhere 
is heard the din of battle&#59; towns are sacked and vil&#8211; 
lages are burned&#44; and fields are red with the blood of 
slaughtered armies&#59; in valleys is heard the booming 
cannon&#44; and mountains reecho the sound of the deadly 
artillery&#59; and with fatal aim battalions are ranged 
against each other&#44; and peace shrieks in agony that 
her arts are despised&#44; and because man strives in his 
fury to mar the image of God&#44; which&#44; like himself&#44; 
his foeman&#8211;brother bears within him &#58; whilst in this 
land&#44; though we hear of war afar oiF&#44; and many are 
hastening away to where the phantom which men 
call glory leads them on to scale fortified walls&#44; and 
where the bright sword flashes in the shock of hostile 
hosts&#44; we are dwelling securely with none to make us 
afraid&#44; and feel none of the horrors of the deadly con&#8211; 
flict which inspires our neighbours with fear and with 
sorrow. &#8212; During the past summer season&#44; too&#44; whilst 
on the confines and the distant towns of this country&#44; 
the pestilence raged fiercely&#44; and severed rudely the 
bonds of friendship and the ties of kindred&#44; whilst 
youth perished prematurely&#44; and manhood sunk in 
the midst of bright anticipations of a good old age &#58; 
we have enjoyed here health in a high degree&#44; and 
there was no cry&#44; no migration iu our streets because

of the destroyer&#59; and there&#44; too&#44; where death reaped 
so great a liarvest&#44; tlie eliill bhist of autumn&#44; Avhich 
many look upon with mournful regret&#44; because then 
the landscape is shorn of its beauty&#44; has chased away 
the pestilential influence &#59; and those who fled from 
their homes again return thither&#44; and the haunts of 
commerce once more are filled with those whom the 
love of gain even could not detain whilst the terror 
of death was upon them&#59; and now the.y speak of the 
danger as past&#44; and the early fallen are referred to as 
those whom the grave has already held for a long 
season. 

Do these mercies not call for our gratitude&#63; for 
our acknowledgment of the goodness of the Supreme 
Ruler of nature&#44; that He has been so munificent to 
us the undeserving&#63; For what are we&#44; that we should 
assume to ourselves the merit of our prosperity &#63; 
Could we command the harvest&#63; can we keep afar 
the marauder from our fields&#63; can we ward oft&#34; the 
locust and cut&#8211;worm from devouring the plants and 
the leaves of the trees &#63; can we by our wisdom keep 
away the assaults of war and the terrors of slaughter&#63; 
can we arrest by our wisdom the arm of tyranny&#63; 
can we by our medical skill stay the pestilence from 
reaching us&#44; or arrest its progress after it has invaded 
our domicils&#63; O&#44; powerless indeed is man&#33; and all 
his wisdom is as naught when he vauntiugly dares to 
measure himself with the One by whose providence 
he lives&#44; or by wdiose will his existence terminates in 
a moment. Be it therefore joy or sorrow which falls 
to our lot&#44; let us not imagine that it is our skill which 
has acquired us the former&#44; or that it is altogether the 
want thereof which has engendered the latter. It is 

<pb n="241"/>

freely acliiiittecl that it is our duty to employ all our 
energies&#44; whatever of knowledge and skill we may 
have&#44; to succeed in any pursuit in which we may en&#8211; 
gage&#59; but having done so&#44; we cannot for all that say 
with certainty that we shall not fail&#59; because to insure 
success is not in human power&#44; but it is solely the 
gracious favour of Grnd which blesses our energy&#44; and 
permits our knowledge and skill to have for us bene&#8211; 
ficial results. Perhaps you may say that the pros&#8211; 
perity and the progress of the country are owing to 
prudent legislation&#44; and the wise constitutional enact&#8211; 
ments of the sages of the revolutionary struggle&#44; 
which placed these states high in the scale of the 
nations of the earth. It is readily admitted that those 
great men have endeared themselves to posterity 
more even by their careful provision for the great and 
general development of the principles of universal 
liberty&#44; than by their successful and daring resistance 
to arbitrary power. Nevertheless they were but men&#44; 
and acted only as dependent agents. Other nations 
too have had wise and good counsellors&#44; no less de&#8211; 
voted to the interests of humanity and their native 
land. And still the liberties of most countries have 
been overthrown&#44; and yielded soon to the tyranny of 
ambitious military leaders&#59; and where freedom is yet 
the property of the inhabitants&#44; we do not observe 
the same prosperity which distinguishes this land. 
You may allege that this is owing to the richness of 
the virgin soil&#44; to the immense domain which here 
invites the labour of the farmer&#44; promising him rich 
returns with comparatively small exertions. Com&#8211; 
merce flourishes here&#44; because of the facilities for 
trade everywhere met with&#44; to the length and depth

of the rivers&#44; to the breadth and extent of the inland 
kdvos&#44; more properly mediterranean seas. All this 
too will be athiiitted&#59; but are not all these things the 
gilts of God&#44; who has cast your lot in sneh pleasant 
parts &#63; and whose are the broad acres&#44; and the long riv&#8211; 
ers&#44; and the vast lakes&#44; but tlie Creator&#39;s&#44; who allowed 
yon to use them&#63; And have not other countries also 
their fertile soil and noble streams&#63; Nevertheless 
they are in some instances retrograding from their 
former eminence&#44; and lapsing again into barbarism&#44; 
and tlie cities are turned into ruins&#44; and fruitful fields 
into solitudes&#59; and of many countries the curious 
traveller asks in vain concerning the great people 
that once was there&#44; which built the mighty ruins 
which he meets with in his search for the remarkable 
and wonderful. No&#44; brethren&#59; it were idle for us to 
remove from us the consciousness of a debt due to 
the Most High for the mauy favours which we enjoy 
here&#44; by reducing them t&#44;o mere results of a wise legis&#8211; 
lation and the fertility and exteut of the soil &#59; for 
were it not that lie had blessed us&#44; all these advan&#8211; 
tages would have left the same results of vexation 
and disappointment which we are struck with in our 
travels through other lands&#44; apparently equally fa&#8211; 
voured hy nature with this republic. 

Look at the history of our own ancient common&#8211; 
wealth in Palestine&#44; excelling in fertility and position 
for commerce any state almost of which we have any 
records&#44; the legislation of which was the wisest&#44; and 
the defenders of which were the bravest on whom the 
Kun ever shone&#59; and yet Palestine fell&#44; its laws were 
abrogated by the arbitrary will of Konian emperors&#44; 
and the children of that land scattered far away from

THE PROSPERITY OF THE STATE. 243 

their hearths and altars&#59; and our being here now 
proves how totally the scattering was which overtook 
oar unhappy people. But it was not because our laws 
were not good&#44; and not because our judges were in&#8211; 
competent&#44; only because we had no longer the favour 
of Heaven&#44; that all this occurred&#59; and He cast us 
away from his presence&#44; and drove us out of our 
heritage&#44; that we might be an evidence how power&#8211; 
less is man if he is without the help of his God. So 
then let us&#44; the inhabitants of this country&#44; at this 
age of the world&#44; not imagine that mere natural ad&#8211; 
vantages will establish our prosperity or insure its 
continuance&#59; that humau combinations will save us 
from the accidents and revulsions&#42; which overthrew 
the states of antiquity. It would indeed be a dread&#8211; 
ful blow to the progress of human freedom&#44; were the 
experiment at self&#8211;government ou a large scale to fail 
in the United States &#59; were the sycophantic advocates 
of royalty&#44; of the one&#8211;man&#8211;power&#44; to be able to point 
to the ruins of this maguiticeut commonwealth&#44; and 
descant upon its fall through civil feuds&#44; through the 
provocation of foreign enemies&#44; through demoraliza&#8211; 
tion and injustice. How would the enemies of man&#8211; 
kind&#44; and this are all lovers of arbitrary rule&#44; glory 
to see their croaking of the incompetency of man for 
ireedom verified by the overthrow of the constitu&#8211; 
tional government in this republic &#59; and yet their pre&#8211; 
dictions are sure to be veritied&#44; if you&#44; brethren&#44; among 
others&#44; do not guard the state against those evils 



&#42; The subsequent history of the country has amply proved this &#59; 
for the wise institutions dif&#42; not save it from a fratricidal war and 
its frightful consequences. August&#44; &#39;27

which undermine its prosperity. Do not imagine for 
one moment tliat liberty is a native product of these 
climes&#44; Avlicnce she cannot be banished&#44; be the con&#8211; 
duct of the citizens what it may. Fatal delusion &#33; 
woful error&#33; should the majority yield themselves to 
such vain imaginings. Nothing but justice&#44; a mutual 
regard for each other&#39;s rights&#44; domestic concord and 
the cultivation of peace with neighbouring nations&#44; 
can uphold this great country in a state of union and 
prosperity&#59; for on no other grounds can the&#44; people 
expect the blessing of Heaven to be with them in 
town and country&#44; and prosper the work of their 
hands whithersoever they go. But let the crimes&#44; 
which have destroyed other commonwealths before 
our day&#44; become universally prevalent in the land&#59; 
let party&#8211;spirit endeavour to stifle the rights of others 
and prevent the free inquiry in public business which 
belongs to every free citizen &#59; let demoralization and 
the love of foreign conquest take the place of simpli&#8211; 
city of manners and a contentment with the bounds 
of the already extended domain &#58; and it requires no 
prophet to predict that this land will fare as did Pales&#8211; 
tine and Home&#59; and the hand of the patriot will be 
paralyzed in his struggles against foreign aggression&#59; 
the voice of the counsellor&#44; though uttering the warn&#8211; 
ings of wisdom&#44; will be unheeded&#44; and dismembered 
and disunited&#44; tlu&#94;se states will be divided and torn 
by factions&#44; and arbitrary rule or military despotism 
will usurp the place of a nation strong in its freedom&#44; 
famous for the universal protection which the poorest 
even can claim under the shadow of equal laws&#44; made 
to shield alike the humble from the violence of the 
rich&#44; and to secure these in the enjoyment of their

the evil&#8211;doer. 

&#34;But how &#44; &#34; you may ask&#44; &#34;are we&#44; individual 
citizens&#44; to contribute to prevent the evils which have 
just been sketched &#63; we are but few&#44; and our influence 
is not likely to bf felt among so many millions of be&#8211; 
ings &#63;&#34; To this I would reply &#58; Let others do as they 
may&#44; it is jours to foster the virtues which will give 
stability to the state&#59; yon are Israelites&#44; descended 
from those who first received the law of universal 
love&#44; the infringement of which was so fearfully 
avenged of our own forefathers&#44; that the effects of 
this vengeance are still palpably visible on us&#44; their 
descendants. Let it then be your study not to defend 
any act in tlio public servants which savours of injus&#8211; 
tice&#44; cruelty&#44; or oppression &#59; and in your private con&#8211; 
duct be charitable&#44; tolerant of the failings of your 
fellow&#8211;citizens of whatever creed&#44; strictly honest in 
all your dealings with your fellow&#8211;men&#44; and hesitate 
not to reprove fearlessly a public wrong whenever 
yon tliiidv that you have discovered the same. But 
above all be religious&#44; in the strictest sense of the 
word&#59; endeavour to obtain a full knowledge of your 
duties as men in covenant with God&#44; as descendants 
from Abraham&#44; Isaac&#44; and Jacob&#44; and let not the free&#8211; 
dom you enjoy inspire you with the false and danger&#8211; 
ous idea that&#44; in a country like this&#44; and in this remote 
age&#44; there is the least exemption for you from the pos&#8211; 
itive observances which the Scriptures enjoin. Ifere&#44; 
brethren&#44; you are free to pursue your conscientious 
convictions without molestation from the civil power&#59;

of a Jewish system of belief were as nearly as possi&#8211; 
ble uniform and universal among all classes&#44; and&#44; we 
may freely add&#44; individuals of our people. I will not 
say that many singular notions were not adopted into 
the general belief of Israelites&#44; derived from their in&#8211; 
tercourse with the various peoples among whom they 
lived&#44; and that these notions were not counter to a 
sound reason and even against the evident meanino&#59; 
of the Scriptures&#59; for it would be folly to maintain 
that we are so superior to all children of man in in&#8211; 
tellect and intuitive knowledge&#44; as to avoid the con&#8211; 
tagion of popular errors and superstitions on the one 
side&#44; or to escape on the other the influence of a phi&#8211; 
losophy which rejects everything as unworthy&#8211; of con&#8211; 
fidence&#44; for which we have not the actual experience 
of our senses. The Israelites are men &#59; and there&#8211; 
fore it would be impossible&#44; unless a special miracle 
were constantly performed for them&#44; that they should 
remain entirely iminfluenced by what is thought&#44; 
spoken&#44; and done by those among whom they reside&#44; 
and whose actions they are compelled to witness daily 
and hourly&#44; whether they wish to observe them or 
not. So&#44; then&#44; we may freely say&#44; that we always 
received an impulse from without either for good or 
evil&#44; and our character was doubtless materially mod&#8211; 
ified&#44; either refined or liardened&#44; either imbued with

love for the gentiles or a bitter aversion for them&#44; in 
the same proportion as they exhibited among them&#8211; 
selves progress or otherwise&#44; civilization or rudeness&#44; 
love or hatred&#42; towards ourselves. But with these 

&#42; Many enemies of the Jews have been in the habit to hunt up 
expressions of illiberality which they discover in the Jewish writ&#8211; 
ings&#44; and to exhibit them to the consideration of their readers as 
the genuine exponents of Jewish feeling towards the gentiles. But 
it must be a malignant heart which does not discover the real cause 
for these expressions. What was the whole world to the Jew in the 
middle&#8211;ages up to the end of the eighteenth century&#63; what is it to 
him now in Kus&#8211;sia&#44; in Pi&#39;ussia&#44; in Austria&#44; and wherever he is found 
in the greatest numbers&#63; He is dealt with in a manner tliat the 
brute is treated kindlier in the field than he is. All around him are 
his enemies &#59; the government oppresses him &#59; the people turn from 
Lini in disdain &#59; and the preachers&#44; they who profess to promulgate 
a religion of peace and good&#8211;will to man&#44; fan the flame of hatred 
towards the rejected of their church. Was this not done by Chris&#8211; 
tians of past ages &#63; is the outrage not repeated in the present en&#8211; 
lightened period by those who have the most light&#63; It was also 
practised by heathens and Mahomedans. Whom then had the Jew 
to love&#63; No one. Whom had he to fear&#63; All mankind. Is it 
then to be wondered that he in return hated the world&#63; that he 
should even think that whatever came into his hand through the 
error of a gentile was lawfully his&#63; was he not plundered openly&#44; 
and this daily&#44; by prince and peasant&#63; by bishop and layman&#63; 
Where then should he get his wealth&#44; the means to satisfy the ava&#8211; 
rice of his tormentors&#44; but by cunning&#44; trick&#44; and circumvention&#63; 
And yet he remained the noble&#44; tbe patient&#44; the hopeful Israelite&#59; 
he continued kind to his persecutors&#44; and loyal to the land of his 
oppression&#59; and he sought no private opportunities for revenge&#44; 
referring his quarrel to God only&#44; asking from Him&#44; who said 
&#34; Mine are vengeance and recompense&#44;&#34;&#39; to look upon the rivers of 
innocent blood that were shed&#44; and to have regard to the tears that 
flowed in streams down the cheek of the sage and the matron&#44; of 
the youth and the maiden&#44; of the bridegroom and the bride&#44; in the 
anguish of tlieir hearts and the constant dread of the sword and 
rsipine which threatened them. And then you wonder that a trace 
of illil&#94;erality is here and there discoverable in the books written

Kolo limitations&#44; we may boldly assert&#44; that the relig&#8211; 
ious opinions&#44; properly so called&#44; of the Jews&#44; had 
not undergone the smallest cliange for many centu&#8211; 
ries&#44; so fiir as the records will permit us to decide&#59; 
since the Scriptures were always the basis of our be&#8211; 
lief&#44; and since these have not undergone the least 
change from the moment they were first intrusted to 
our custody. &#8212; The main i&#41;rinciples of our belief then&#44; 
are&#44; hrst&#44; the existence of God&#44; including his unity&#44; 
eternity&#44; nuchangeability&#44; incorporeality&#44; and sole 
claim to worship &#59; secondh&#42;&#44; the existence of revela&#8211; 
tion from the God of all nature&#44; including the confi&#8211; 
dence in the truth of the propliete&#44; especially the 
great teacher of Israel&#44; Moses the son of Amram&#44; and 
the certainty that this revelation is yet in our posses&#8211; 
sion&#44; and that it will not be exchanged&#44; and has 
hitherto not been changed for any&#8211;other by the Power 
who bestowed it on us &#59; thirdly&#44; the existence of re&#8211; 
wards and punishments&#44; including the inherent power 
of God to know all that is done in any part of his 
world by the beings whom IJe has created&#59; fourthly&#44; 
the coming of a messenger to be specially deputed by 
God to fulfil all the promises which have ever been 



under tho spur of the agonized spirit which was then so abundant 
everywhere &#33; that men&#44; though they were Israelites&#44; could learn to 
hate Ihei r enemies &#33; It strikes one as most curious that Jews should 
iiiush to find such expressions in their books &#59; on the contrary&#44; it is 
only to be wondered that they still could teach&#44; &#34; The righteous of 
the nations of the world are entitled to a share of eternal hap&#8211; 
liiness &#59;&#34; &#34; The Lord does not withhold the reward due to any crea&#8211; 
ture whatever&#58;&#34; were it not that our wise men taught the pure 
truth to their followers&#44; and felt convinced of the ultimate triumph 
of the pure faith&#44; as the sincere Hebrew believes now&#44; too&#44; althouo&#8211;h 
in many respects his political condition has improved.

their being ultimately brought to a true knowledge 
of the Godhead&#44; by which means much especial hap&#8211; 
piness is to accrue to the people of Israel &#59; and fifthly&#44; 
the resurrection of the dead&#44; embracing the spiritual 
perfection of all the intelligent beings that ever ema&#8211; 
nated from the creative hand of God&#44; and the perpet&#8211; 
ual abolition of all imperfections&#44; sufierings&#44; sinful 
inclinations&#44; and death&#44; from the face of the earth&#44; a 
state in which righteousness shall be supremely re&#8211; 
warded&#44; and ffuilt be exhibited in its fullest and most 
hideous complexions. 

Xow&#44; iis all those doctrines have been given to us 
in general terms&#44; no doubt that different persons al&#8211; 
ways expounded them in somewhat varying colours&#44; 
or understood them in different limitations. But&#44; 
despite of the various outward influences which acted 
upon us&#59; notwithstanding the many changes which 
came over us during so many centuries&#44; and the 
many wanderings and expulsions to which we were 
subjected during all this time&#44; we clung to our creed 
with the tenacity of affection&#44; and would not yield a 
single fragment of an idea connected with it&#44; though 
for so doing we were promised all that men prize 
high on earth&#44; and our adherence to it subjected us 
to Jill that the world calls hardship&#44; sorrow&#44; iind deg&#8211; 
i&#8211;adation. In former years&#44; no one breathed a doubt 
against the hope of Israel&#44; against the expected com&#8211; 
ing of the Messiah to lead us again to the holy land&#44; to 
dw&#34;Gll there in peace and contentment&#44; with God for 
our King&#44; with the whole world for our confederates &#59;

truth and holiness which we possess. If any one at&#8211;

a part of our liturgy&#44; both in the daily service and 
the particular prayers used for the solemn festivals&#44; 
to entreat the Almighty for a conversion of the world 
to his law&#44; &#34; that the fear of the Lord might be ex&#8211; 
tended over all his Avorks&#44; and his dread over all that 
He has created&#44; so that all his works may fear Him&#44;

earth be turned towards Him &#59; and that all the in&#8211;

yoke of liis kingdom&#44; and lie thus reigns over them 
for ever and ever.&#34; I coukl easily adduce many 
racu&#39;e passages to sliow what oiir forefathers under&#8211; 
stood by the coming of the redeemer&#44; as devek&#41;ped 
in our prayers&#44; the beet standard by which to measure 
tlie real sentiments of any people which&#44; like us&#44; has 
written forms by which to address the throne of 
Grace. 

As I have said already&#44; the composition of the 
prayers extended over a long period of time&#44; proba&#8211; 
bly more than two thousand years&#59; consequently&#44; 
there is the amplest proof of a uniformity&#44; nay&#44; iden&#8211; 
tity&#44; in the religious opinions of the Jews during all 
tliat period&#44; as respects the belief in a redemption. 
Our fathers knew as well as we do of the existence 
of Mahomedan and ISTazarene creeds&#59; they had seen 
the various triumphs of the crescent and the cross&#44; 
and the gradual downfall of the many systems of 
idolatry which at one time were universal in Europe&#44; 
Asia&#44; and Africa&#44; and the substitution therefor of the 
doctrines of the man of Mecca&#44; and him of Nazareth. 
We had in those days men of great intellect&#44; inferior 
to none in the present age&#59; we had a Judah the cliief&#44; 
author of the Mishnah &#59; a Rab Ashi&#44; the author of 
the Talmud&#59; a Saadyah Gaon&#44; one of the iirst trans&#8211; 
lators of the Scriptures into the vernacular language 
of the country which to him was the Arabic&#59; a Ju&#8211; 
dah Ilallevy&#44; the prince of poets&#44; and next to David&#44; 
the sweetest hymnologist &#59; an Aben Ezra&#44; great in 
all the sciences of his day &#59; a Moses of Cordova&#44; uni&#8211; 
versally known as Maimonides&#44; renowned as philoso&#8211;

comments on the Scriptures and Talmud&#44; as the light 
of the captivity&#44; under the name of Rashi&#59; and a&#44;ls&#124;st 
of others&#44; who excelled all their contemporaritjs in 
wisdom and knowledge. Many of our great teachers 
were also principal officers at the courts of their sov&#8211; 
ereigns&#44; and&#44; at one time&#44; nearly every prince had a 
Jewish physician&#44; so much were our medical men re&#8211; 
spected and trusted. Butdid they for one moment falter 
in their faith &#63; did they fancy salvation to have pro&#8211; 
ce&#8211;eded from Mecca or Nazareth &#63; Let their writings 
testity&#44; that they were not misled&#44; and never bowed 
their pure souls to the inventions of men&#44; but held 
fast to the standard of the law and the prophets. 
They saw large empires converted to one system or the 
other&#44; more rapidly than this takes place in our own 
days&#59; they beheld the extermination of many idols&#44; 
which bowed and stooped before the advance of new 
opinions &#58; yet they saw not in this the regeneration 
of the world &#59; they felt that the sword was yet the 
arbiter between mankind&#44; and was often unsheathed 
to aid the triumph of certain religious dogmas&#44; and 
not rarely wielded to exterminate dissentients from 
the popular doctrines. They therefore sighed for the 
day of the Lord&#44; when He will come inhis glory to 
reign alone on earth&#44; when his truth shall be every&#8211; 
where acknowledged&#44; and his iTame feared by every 
one. They forgot not Jerusalem in their prosperity&#44; 
and though surrounded wnth honour and case&#44; they 
composed many of those elegiac hymns which even 
now touch a chord of anguish in our hearts&#44; as thev 
make us weep over the sanctuary of God&#44; into which 
the enemy forced his bloody way&#44; and for the sons of 
Jacob that fell by the sword. These glorious men

Judah covered with Hocks of men&#44; and the streets of 
the holy city crowded with playful boys and maidens&#44; 
shouting in the innocent glee of their early years&#44; 
unterrified by the powers of the adversary&#44; who will 
exist no more. And when they languished in the 
dungeon of an Inquisition appointed to exterminate 
their faith&#44; their beatified vision revelled in the over&#8211; 
throw of that abominable system which required 
their blood as its sacrifice&#44; and they saw the prison&#8211; 
house levelled to the earth&#44; and its builders and sup&#8211; 
porters&#44; its judges and executioners cowering in the 
dust before the Lord&#39;s elect&#44; and they gazed on the 
priests of Heaven&#44; robed in white&#44; and burning with 
intense devotion to the Father of Israel&#44; again sur&#8211; 
rounding the altars&#44; to bring thereon sacrifice and in&#8211;

over him&#44; and trod him to death under the hoofs of his horse. &#8212; Late

tbe saiutccl martyrs to the accursed stake&#44; their soul 
rose above the din and tumult of the world&#44; and&#44; su&#8211; 
perior to death&#44; it conquered all fear and trembling&#44; 
and they feasted their sight on the assemblage of the 
thousands of the faithful who will&#44; at the time which 
is coming&#44; hasten again to the temple of the Lord&#44; to 
the city where He will again cause his ISTame to dwell&#44; 
and whence are to go forth the law and the word of 
God to all sous of men. 

Were all these great men deceived&#63; were their 
hopes but the vision of a night&#63; their fond anticipa&#8211; 
tions but the baseless fabric of a dream&#44; or the fevered 
fancy of delirium &#63; No&#44; it cannot be &#59; their words 
bear too much the stamp of sober earnestness&#44; &#8212; of 
deep conviction &#59; and they endured too much ever to 
have yielded themselves to anything but the certain 
persuasion&#44; that theirs was the faith which emanated 
from the Avisdom of God. And thus armed&#44; they 
cared not what happened to them &#59; was it life&#44; was it 
death&#44; was it ease&#44; was it exile&#44; it was of no impor&#8211; 
tance to these devoted servants&#59; they were but fulfil&#8211;

unerring finger of Providence&#44; and they followed 
cheerfully the heavenly guidance&#44; convinced that in 
the kingdom of their Father there would be ample 
reward for them&#44; and for all who had trusted on to 
the last. 

But these saints now sleep in the dust of the earth&#44; 
joyfully awaiting their awakening from the grave to 
an immortal glory&#44; and the fullilnient of their dearest 
hopes. And there have arisen men in our day&#44; Avho

to square with the views of tyrannical rulers&#44; or fo 
please states hy their pretended identity of opinions. 
These men wish to strike out from our prayers all al&#8211; 
lusions to the restoration of the sacrifices&#44; or tl&#94;c an&#8211; 
ticipated return of liberated Israel to their ancient 
domain. Tliese men look for an ideal kinofdom of 
God&#44; wherein our nation is quietly to expire in the 
universal prevalence of a purified religion. These 
men wish not to see Israel restored &#59; they ask for no 
greater happiness than to be regarded as entitled to 
a few offices in the respective states&#44; and to be placed 
on a legal equality with the other citizens. They 
claim as their country exclusively that wherein they 
were born&#44; or in which they live&#59; and they imagine&#44; 
or profess to believe&#44; that the hope of a restoration 
must clash with our duties as citizens or subjects of 
the various potentates under whom we live protected 
and at peace. Such erroneous opinions are boldly 
propounded&#44; and diversified under a vast variety of 
peculiar shadings&#44; to correspond with the greater or 
less degree of Jewish feeling yet inherent in the re&#8211; 
spective reformers&#44; as they style themselves. But&#44; if 
it were true that the belief in a restoration of temple&#44; 
people&#44; sacrifices&#44; and the kingdom&#44; implied&#44; neces&#8211; 
sarily&#44; hostility to the various states in which we so&#8211; 
journ&#44; it woukl follow&#44; as a matter of course&#44; that our 
forefathers must have been enemies to all the workl&#44; 
by their pertinacity in adhering to their opinions&#59; 
and hence our enlightened men&#44; as they love to style 
themselves&#44; the men of progress and of light&#44; become 
the most obsequious defenders and apologists of 
all the cruel oppressors who have so multifariously

islnnent&#44; &#63;vnd oppression of those who would not re&#8211; 
linquiyh it at their bidding. 

To judge from the vehemence which one occasion&#8211; 
ally sees exhibited&#44; when it is hinted that the real 
belief of the Jew is his national restoration&#44; he would 
come to the conclusion that a more pernicious doc&#8211; 
trine never was entertained by any class of human 
beings&#59; that it is absolutely a hideous monster&#44; against 
the approach of which we ought to guard o.urselves 
by all the contrivances of modern science&#44; and which 
we must deny with the bold effrontery of confirmed 
infidelity. But it requires no argument to prove that 
all this denial of Judaism has its source in the mean&#8211; 
est of human failings&#44; and that it is owing either to 
infidelity&#44; an entire indifference to religion&#44; or an 
obsequious yielding of conviction for the sake of flat&#8211; 
tering secular power&#44; to wheedle it out of some tangi&#8211; 
ble benefit&#44; which o4&#59;herwise would be denied to the 
professing Jew. How differently did the great ones 
of antiquity act&#33; with how much self&#8211;devotion and 
forgetfulness of all personal interest did they ac&#8211; 
knowledge their convictio&#8211;ns&#44; let the consequences be 
what they might&#33; and it is precisely this love for 
things of the world which has caused so much de&#8211; 
struction among us&#44; and brought about the painful 
exhibition of open profanity and shameless sinning 
which so much characterize our age. &#8212; I have stated 
before&#44; that the progress of science all over the world&#44; 
not among us alone&#44; has produced a great revolution 
in opinions&#44; and ideas once acquiesced in&#44; and boliels 
once firmly entertained&#44; have faded before the light 
of investigation&#44; whicji proved their unsoundness. iSo 
also were many ideas once common among us&#44; super&#8211;

stitious notions I mean&#44; borrowed hy degrees from 
surrounding influences&#44; the silent inroads of which 
we coukl not resist&#44; again silently dropped as not 
compatible with reason and religion&#44; and before long 
thcj will not be known any more as ever having had 
a place in the minds of Jews&#44; But the wicked and 
the thoughtless have taken advantage of this circum&#8211; 
stance&#44; and they have dared to treat as an antiquated 
error whatever stands in their way and opposes their 
interests&#44; or that which their Umited intellect cannot 
comprehend&#44; and which their vain&#8211;glorious pliiloso&#8211; 
phy places in the category of impossibilities. But it 
must be evident to every child even that&#44; if religion 
is nothing more than a system changeable with every 
change in reiinement and scientific progress or retro&#8211; 
gression&#44; it cannot be an emanation from Heaven. 
It is true that it has l>een confided to mankind for 
their use and employment&#44; and hence httle nuitters 
may change with the times&#44; which fact will be clearly 
reconcilable with the Mosaic code when correctly 
viewed. But to assert that time has any legitimate 
business with principles or great observances&#44; would&#44; 
as said&#44; destroy religion totally as a safe guide on the 
path of morals and belief&#44; which we all feel the ne&#8211; 
cessity of possessing. If the progress of society in 
civilization justifies the removal of all that men do 
not find to accord with their own notions of advance 
in all things&#58; it follows as a legitimate deduction&#44; that 
if society retrogrades&#44; which it frequently has done&#44; 
and may do again&#44; then all the superstitions and 
cruelties resulting from a perverted view of duty will 
become again justifiable&#59; in other words&#44; that what&#8211; 
ever is done by public assent&#44; this being the standard

of social opinion&#44; is just and proper&#44; be this tlic foHy 
of the Crusaders&#44; the bloody wars of Mahomed laid 
Charlemagne&#44; for the propagation of their creeds&#44; or 
the wholesale butcheries of the Inquisition in the 
faith ordered and recognized as legitimate by the
decrees of many Roman pontiffs. But&#44; I imagine&#44; 
that the wildest claimant for the right of progress 
will not say that such acts were ever justifiable&#44; and 
that the most we can assert is that the perpetrators 
thereof are to be pitied for their blind ignorance&#44; 
since they were through mistaken views guilty of 
heinous crimes in the name of religion. Religion 
itself&#44; however&#44; has never justified any act of barbar&#8211; 
ity&#44; and at all times there were those who inveighed 
against the deeds which were wrought within their 
knowledge&#44; by an appeal to that very code in the 
name of which the outrages were committed&#44; Now&#44; 
taking this sober and candid view of the question&#44; 
we must deny any right of appeal to the spirit gf the 
age as a valid excuse to remodel our religion&#44; upon 
the arbitrary basis thus attempted to be forced upon 
us. We want something far more stable than the 
visionary notion of every one who has skill enough to 
write a book&#44; or power of speech to preach a sermon &#59; 
we want a more permanent support for our light to 
futurity&#44; than the mad schemes of some disappointed 
worldling who&#44; because he cannot be a Rabbi among 
the Jews&#44; is ready to become grand inquisitor among 
their oppressors. But we need not search far for this 
stable basis&#44; this permanent support&#44; this unfading 
liglit&#59; for it is already with us&#44; in those Holy Scrip&#8211; 
tures which we have in our possession&#44; and which 
have been watclied over with more than maternal

solicitude by the Israelites&#44; in all their sorrows&#44; in all 
their exiles&#59; and what they declare to be right&#44; has 
ever been our law&#44; has ever formed the matter which 
we called our belief&#59; and&#44; whatever may be alk&#94;gcd to 
the contrary&#44; the Scriptures alone have always con&#8211; 
stituted the Jewish religion&#44; and nothing opposed to 
them can be regarded as of any weight whatever. If 
this is the truth&#44; and there can hardly be any doubt on 
that point&#44; it follows that there is a standard&#44; superior 
to the spirit of any age&#44; which requires no change nor 
amendment with every discovery or newfangled no&#8211; 
tion which makes its appearance before the world. 
yOAv&#44; upon the basis of Scripture do we rest our be&#8211; 
lief in a redeemer&#44; not upon the mere imaginings of 
any eminent man of any age&#44; nor upon the scientific 
discoveries of a college of learned experimentalists. 
Look at the prophecies from one end of the Bible to 
the other&#44; and all speak of a change in the afiairs of 
mankind&#44; and of Israel in particular&#44; which has not 
been witnessed to this hour&#44; and which&#44; nevertheless&#44; 
the course of events clearly points out as certain to 
arrive. 

I have detainetl you so long already to&#8211;day&#44; that I 
must omit the discussion of the details for a future 
occasion&#59; and merely finish at present&#44; with a positive 
announcement of the restoration&#44; which is found in 
the Haphtorah of to&#8211;day&#44; from Ezckiel xxxvii. The 
prophet was ordered to explain&#44; by the union of two 
pieces of wood&#44; which he was to exhibit to the people&#44; 
the future union of the rival kingdoms of Judah and 
Ephraim&#44; which both had ceased to exist at the time 
the prophecy was spoken. Ephraim now is lost&#44; and 
the tribes associated with him are not known among

lis. Judah is scattered&#44; and fills tlie whole world witli 
liis fugitives. And yet we are promised that they 
shall become one people on the mountains of Israel&#44; 
luider the rule of one king. And then shall they no 
more be chargeable with sin and transgression &#59; be&#8211; 
cause&#44; when gathering them from all their dwelling&#8211; 
phices&#44; God will himself cleanse them from guilt&#44; and 
they shall be his people. And he says in continuation&#44; 
verse 24&#58; 

&#34; And my servant David shall be king over them &#59; and one shep&#8211; 
herd shall be for them all &#59; and in my ordinances they shall walk&#44; 
and my statutes they shall observe and do them.&#34; 

This is the future of which the prophet speaks&#44; and 
this is the Messiah&#44; the King David&#44; the one shepherd 
whom we are told to expect. Shall we believe in the 
God who has so long guarded us&#44; or shall we cease to 
be Jews for worldly gain&#44; or from unbelief&#63; Decide 
for yourselves&#44; brethren&#44; and sure I am that&#44; ulti&#8211; 
mately&#44; enlightened fiiith will triumph over worldli&#8211; 
ness&#44; and we shall all march under the same banner 
which waved over our fathers&#44; and that we shall con&#8211; 
tinue as the people of God&#44; and merit at length his 
mercy. Amen.

THE PERPETUITY OF JUDAISM. 

O Thou&#44; who hast redeemed us and our fathers 
from slavery unto freedom&#44; and from darkness unto 
a great light &#33; be with us also this day&#44; and let the 
light of thy countenance shine unto us that we may 
be blessed&#44; as our fathers were blessed&#44; with a knowl&#8211; 
edge of the things which concern our immortal hap&#8211; 
piness&#44; and that knowing our duty we may learn to 
subdue the evil propensity of our nature&#44; and only do 
that which is declared lawful in the words of thy law. 
O&#44; inspire our heart with wisdom&#44; that we may bo 
able to distinguish between the true and the false&#44; be&#8211; 
tween the doctrines which are from Thee&#44; and those 
which are merely the devices of men&#44; the inventions 
of deceit and cunning&#44; by which many are withdrawn 
unto the paths of sin. Yes&#44; guard us&#44; as a father 
guards his son&#44; and ward oft&#34; the shafts of evil which 
are scattered through the world&#44; and grant us oppor&#8211; 
tunities that we may render ourselves worthy of thy 
iavoui&#8211;&#44; which is the portion of those who have done 
thy will. Amen. 

Brethren &#33;

&#34;And this day shall be unto you for a memorial&#44; and ye shall 
celebrate it as a feast in honour of the Lord &#59; throughout your gen&#8211; 
erations&#44; as a perpetual statute shall ye celebrate it.&#34; 

This verse is found in connexion with the institu&#8211; 
tion of the Passover&#44; and speaks plainly of the per&#8211; 
petuity of the celebration&#44; as a memorial of the great 
mercy which God displayed at the time the ordinance 
was given to the Israelites&#44; in breaking asunder the 
yoke of their servitude and letting them go free&#44; re&#8211; 
lieved from the dread of their taskmasters&#44; no longer 
fearing the tyranny of Pharaoh and his equally guilty 
people. &#8212; AVe have heard so much about a new dis&#8211; 
pensation&#44; about relieving the world from the burden 
and the curse of our law&#44; as our opponents have dared 
to call the service of the Lord as indicated in his holy 
Scriptures&#44; that we are surely at liberty&#44; without of&#8211; 
fence to any one&#44; to examine into the pretensions of 
this new system&#44; which men endeavour to force upon 
us&#44; either by violence or by flattery&#44; either by threats 
or specious appeals and pretended argument. If our 
opponents may be believed&#44; the Lord first gave a law&#44; 
selecting Israel as its bearers&#44; and then repealed it 
without any public declaration to that effect&#44; and re&#8211; 
jected Israel from being any farther his people&#44; be&#8211; 
cause they could not believe that the Blessed Creator 
had sent a messenger&#44; to contradict his own revelation 
which He had imparted to them through Moses. If 
we&#44; however&#44; take a simple view of the term divine 
revelation&#44; it will appear at once that it has a pecu&#8211; 
liarity of meaning which distinguishes it from a hu&#8211; 
man declaration of will&#44; A man to&#8211;day is in a par&#8211;

enterprise&#44; or depressed by being unwell&#44; or thwarted 
in his expectations &#59; whereas&#44; on the morrow he may 
feel very difterently&#44; the circumstances under which 
he acted the previous day being diiierent. It may 
also happen that in the meantime he has acquired 
more knowledge&#44; and is therefore not alone able&#44; but 
compelled to take a ditferent view of tlie subject on 
which he is to decide&#59; and hence must arise an un&#8211; 
certainty&#44; a mutability in regard to whatever is 
brought under the direction of the human mind&#44; 
whether this be in one or iu many individuals acting 
or acted on in concert. But how does it stand with 
regard to the mind of the Almighty &#63; Is He diseased 
to&#8211;day and well to&#8211;morrow&#63; do his plans succeed in 
one year and fail in another&#63; are in this age his fac&#8211; 
ulties limited&#44; and do they become more expanded in 
a succeeding one &#63; Who gave Ilim counsel when lie 
called the world into being&#63; who advised llim when 
he set limits to earth and sea&#63; And when He came 
in his glory&#44; like unto a king who appears before his 
subjects to receive their homage&#44; to teach to Israelites 
and mankind the statutes of his will&#44; &#8212; where was his 
want of experience&#44; where his insufliciency of knowl&#8211;

experimental sciences&#44; the march of discover &#34;

enlarged&#44; because forsooth we of the present day have 
more objects the produce of science than former 
generations had &#63; The very proposition proves its ab&#8211; 
surdity&#59; it would be insulting to reason to adduce 
arguments to establish that the Most Perfect cannot 
be farther perfected&#44; and that the Most Wise cannot

augment in wisdom&#44; through the uid of those to 
whom He imparts the wisdom and the power of un&#8211; 
derstanding which they possess&#44; &#8212; If then we are told 
of a better system than ours as coming from God&#44; 
one of two things must necessarily be the case &#58; either 
that He had at first not the requisite knowledge to 
enable Ilim to come to a correct conclusion Avith re&#8211; 
gard to what is and ought to be right&#44; or that He 
causelessly changed his intentions with regard to one 
or more particulars from an arbitrariness of disposi&#8211; 
tion&#44; without any just reason arising from an acquisi&#8211; 
tion of new knowledge rendering such a change neces&#8211; 
sary&#44; Now&#44; in what light would either assumption ex&#8211; 
hibit the blessed and unchangeable&#44; the omniscient 
and most holy God &#63; Precisely as you would figure to 
yourselves a human being swayed by want of infor&#8211; 
mation&#44; and governed by caprice &#59; either of which 
would reduce Him to the level of a finite creature&#44; 
subject to all the imperfections and infirmities which 
we discover in our own nature. 

If we now look into the Scriptures&#44; even if our 
reason were insuflicient to represent to us the Holiest 
without blemish&#44; and as not liable to accidents of 
whatever kind&#58; we shall discover that the Bible&#8211;doc&#8211; 
trine is one which exactly corresponds with the result 
of our own reflection. Bileam in his enraptured 
prophecy exclaimed&#44; &#34;God is not a man that he 
should lie&#44; and not a son of man that he should 
repent.&#34; Moses said&#44; &#34;For the Lord thy God is a 
mercifid God&#59; and He will not forsake thee&#44;. neither 
destroy thee&#44; nor forget the covenant of thy fathers 
which He swore unto them.&#34; &#34;And the Lord com&#8211; 
manded us to do all these statutes&#44; to fear the Lord

onr God&#44; that it may be well with us all the days&#44; tliat 
He might preserve us alive&#44; as it is at this day.&#34; 
&#34; For the Lord will again rejoice over thee for good&#44; 
as He rejoiced over thy fathers &#58; if thou slialt heark&#8211; 
en unto the voice of the Lord thy God&#44; to keep his 
commandments and his statutes which are written in 
this book of the law&#44; and if thou returnest unto the 
Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy sonl.&#34; 
&#34; He is the Rock&#44; his work is perfect&#59; for all his ways 
are just&#58; a God of truth and without iniquity&#44; just 
and risjhteous is He.&#34; If these several selections 
from the law have any meaning at all&#44; they assert 
positively that in the Lord and in his law there can be 
no change&#44; and that as He is from the beginning&#44; be&#8211; 
fore any creature had any existence&#44; so is his princi&#8211; 
ple of right and justice eternal&#44; one and uniform&#59; 
because He being just and merciful&#44; upright and 
true&#44; the attributes thus sanctified are a part of his 
being&#44; and are therefore inseparable from Him in all 
ages of the world and in every stage of existence. 

&#34;When therefore we obtain a commandment from 
the Lord&#44; and are told it shall be a perpetual sign of 
the covenant between God and man&#44; between God 
and Israel &#58; we are certified that through every age 
of the world&#44; in whatever place we are&#44; and under 
whatever circumstances we may be found&#44; we are 
bound to believe in the truth of the ordinance&#44; and to 
conform to it in letter and spirit. We have then also 
no power conferred on us to reason on its propriety 
or to limit it to circumstances&#44; short of a prevention 
through actual and insurmountable necessity&#44; where 
physical incapacity&#44; or external force which we cannot 
resist&#44; hinders us in the perlbrmaucc of our duty. 

<pb n="269"/>

Because so soon as we know that a tiling is trom God 
and conformable to liis wisdom&#44; it becomes evidently 
the business of our life to learn herein submission to 
the will of Him who gave us life&#44; and to yield the re&#8211; 
sult of our reasoning to the mandate of Him who 
alone endowed us with knowledge. There is accord&#8211; 
ingly no time which we can imagine as absolving us 
from our allegiance to the law&#44; in the words of the 
eighth and ninth articles of our creed&#44; &#34; I believe 
With a perfect foith that all the law which is now 
found in our possession&#44; is the same that was given 
to our blessed teacher Moses. I also believe with a 
perfect faith that tJtis law will not be exchanged&#44; nor 
Avill there be another law from the Creator&#44; whose 
name be blessed.&#34; For as believers in the purity of 
God and his perfection in wisdom and knowledge&#44; we 
cannot admit that He has left the world without a 
thorough acquaintance with their duty&#44; or that He 
has or will alter that which He ordained as a law 
for everlasting. 

Let us now revert to the words of our text &#58; &#34; And 
this day&#34; &#40;meaning the Passover&#41; &#34; shall be unto you. 
for a memorial&#44; and ye shall celebrate it as a feast in 
honour of the Lord &#59; throughout your generations&#44; as 
a perpetual statute shall ye celebrate it.&#34; What does 
this mean &#63; but that the whole succession of genera&#8211; 
tions of Israelites should celebrate&#44; as a memorial of 
what God had wrought in behalf of their ancestors&#44; 
the identical fifteenth day and the next six succeeding 
days of the spring&#8211;month in every future year&#44; to ac&#8211; 
knowledge that they believe truly and firmly&#44; that 
through the display of an irresistible power the Lord 
had liberated the bondmen of Pharaoh from a thral&#8211;

&#40;lorn from which no earthly exertions could have freed 
them&#44; and that lie had given them hh command&#8211; 
ments&#44; by observing Avhich tliey might in truth be 
properly termed the servants of the Most High. The 
very term Most High&#44; just used&#44;&#8211; calls up in our soul 
the idea of the utmost conceivable superiority &#59; im&#8211; 
agine any being ever so high&#44; exalted&#44; great and 
powerful&#44; still our God would be above him. He being 
high in the most eminent degree. Our keeping then 
of the Passover was intended to exhibit our faith in 
tlic unlimited power of the Godhead&#44; to rule in all the 
earth and over the whole range of the universe&#44; though 
this should consist of millions oii millions of worlds&#44; 
existing through millions on millions of centuries&#44; 
whilst at the same time He takes cognizance of all 
that is done in any part of his vast domain without 
fatiguing his vision or exhausting his strength&#44; or be&#8211; 
ing wearied in his watchfulness&#44; and lessening his 
energy. We are to testify that we keep the Passover 
to honour the Lord&#44; because He has so commanded 
us&#44; &#8212; not that we can thereby repay Him for his 
goodness&#44; not that we can by the ceremonial observ&#8211; 
ances of the season secure to us any particular worldly 
advantiige&#44; or claim as our right especial favours from 
Him &#59; but only to confess that we are willing to be 
guided by our Benefactor&#44; and to follow strictly his 
teaching&#44; thereby hoping to obtain his approbation &#59; 
because&#44; and only because. He has promised that such 
obedience&#44; however little it may be in itself&#44; should 
secure to us the mercy of Him our Father who is in 
heaven. 

The object of the commandment of the Passover is 
then twofold &#58; the iirst&#44; the gloriticntion of the Lord&#44;

through which means truth will be best established 
on earth&#44; and secondly&#44; the beatitude of the subjects 
of his mighty kingdom. With the Lord for the solely 
acknowledged Sovereign of the earth&#44; with the uni&#8211; 
versal acceptance of his revelation as the basis of hu&#8211; 
man conduct&#44; there will be no room for false belief&#44; 
no space for the exercise of violence and wrong. 
When all the world fully and truly acknowledge that 
to our Father belongs the dominion&#44; that He alone 
rules wherever his eye penetrates&#44; that lie needs and 
has no associate to affect his will &#58; there will evidently 
be no cause for the widely differing views concerning 
the Power to be worshipped&#44; which now prevail over 
the earth. There will be no need then for colleges 
of learning and cumbrous volumes to expound who 
and what God is&#59; for the simple words of our creed 
will explain all that is now mystified by comments 
on comments&#44; and by flimsy ingenuity heaped upon 
productions of the same kind. The words of the law&#44; 
which we repeat daily and on so many occasions of 
our life&#44; are &#34; The Lord our God is alone the Lord&#44;&#34; 
or as literally rendered&#44; the Eternal our God&#44; the 
Eternal is one &#59; emphatically declaring a simple and 
a perfect unity&#44; in whom there is no conceivable divis&#8211; 
ion&#44; nor any imaginable aggregation of parts from 
without&#59; He who is in good truth the One&#44; like whom 
none does exist&#44; nor can exist in all the extent of the 
universe. ISTow in honour of this One we are told to 
celebrate a perpetual festival&#59; let otlier men worship 
each his own god&#44; let other men follow each the 
law which he deems divine and true &#58; it matters not 
to us&#44; for we walk in the name of the living God and 
the King of everlasting. With each returning spring

we renew the celebration of his power &#59; we gratefully 
acknowledge that we are debtors to the same un&#8211; 
changing One who watched over us in ages gone by&#44; 
and who still keeps his providence extended over us&#44; 
so that we are not consumed in the lands of our op&#8211; 
ponents. We testify that though changes innumer&#8211; 
able have come over the earth&#44; we&#44; the sons of Jacob&#44; 
not having been consumed&#44; stand in the same relation 
to Ilim as we did from the beginning&#44; and the un&#8211; 
leavened bread is eaten in our houses&#44; the bitter herbs 
are taken as a memorial of our captivity&#44; and the 
leaven is removed as an evidence of our willingness 
to obey the behests of God&#44; although new and en&#8211; 
lightened nations have arisen in the lapse of centu&#8211; 
ries&#44; have kindled their lamp by the blazing lire of 
Sinai&#44; and now pretend to have received a new in&#8211; 
struction from God which He has not imparted to us 
directly. But if even the Holy One could have 
changed&#59; if even his mind had undergone the vacil&#8211; 
lation of humanity &#58; still we would reject any yre&#8211; 
tended new revelation w&#8211;hicli has not the publicity 
of Sinai. There lie came down in clouds of glory&#44; 
and an entire people exclaiming &#34;WcAvill do and 
obey&#34; received the precepts in words simple and in&#8211; 
telligible to the commonest understanding&#44; words&#44; 
which then spoken to men just liberated from slavery&#44; 
are to this hour unsurpassed in cogency and truth&#44; 
and to which no philosophy&#44; or high&#8211;learned theology&#44; 
or discovery in the art of government has been able 
to add one single letter as an improvement or ampli&#8211; 
fication. We were then told lliat we should observe 
whatever other precepts the Lord might write down 
for our instruction&#44; and we promised to Him&#44; through

his accredited raessengei&#34;&#44; that we would for ourselves 
and our posterity forever strictly follow all the divine 
instructions thus received through Moses&#44; as though 
we had iieard them with our own ears proceeding 
from the moutli of Almighty Power. N&#34;ow the least 
that could have heen done to ahsolve us from this 
solemn compact&#44; would have heen an announcement 
equally well authenticated from amidst the fire of 
glory&#44; that a new law had heen given&#44; the old law 
being thereby repealed and of no farther binding 
force. But well may we ask to be shown a tittle of 
evidence&#44; that any such abrogation ever took place&#59; 
that any one man even professing to be inspired by 
God ever taught a revocation of the principles of duty 
as laid down in the law. Ask your opponents where 
they find a law of morality&#44; separate and distinct 
from the Pentateuch &#63; ask them in what volume is 
the ordination of the Sabbatic institution&#63; of chastity &#63; 
of restitution of stolen property &#63; in short of all the 
distinguishing features of civilized life by which it is 
elevated above barbarism and idolatry &#63; Curse of the 
law&#33; do you call our observances&#63; Pray&#44; tell us 
where are the blessings which the denial thereof pro&#8211; 
duces&#63; where do you find the support for all the in&#8211; 
stitutions which confer a blessing on society&#44; except 
in the pages which ordain likewise our ceremonial 
observances&#63; It will not do to separate the moral 
from the strictly religious ordinances&#59; for though 
they are distinct in their character&#44; the divine dis&#8211; 
pleasure denounced for their infraction is threatened 
as ranch in the one as the other case. The distinc&#8211; 
tion therefore attempted to be thus created&#44; is &#40;juite 
arbitrary&#44; and against every principle of correct inter&#8211;

pretation &#59; since tlie law of God itself makes no marked 
difference in the sanctity&#8211; of the purely moral and the 
purely ceremonial laws&#44; &#8212; Grant then the possibility 
that the Lord could change his religion&#44; and that the 
ceremonial law had been repealed&#44; and assume that 
this assertion should rest upon the best possible evi&#8211; 
dence&#44; all of which assumption we thoroughly deny &#58; 
the question would still arise&#44; &#34; In what manner have

right to yield the smallest portion of our observance 
in favour of any doctrine or argument&#44; which can be 
derived from their teaching&#44; their writings&#44; or their 
example. I speak not now of any particular kind 
of belief&#59; but I include all which have been hitherto 
developed&#44; and which still threaten to astonish or 
stultify the world&#44; before the final triumph of truth&#44;

tertained by many enlightened persons&#44; all claiming&#44; 
and no doubt sincerely so&#44; that they are right. We 
as Jews can have but one standard&#59; not even mere 
human reason and the results of progression in sci&#8211; 
ences can affect us &#59; we are a people created as such 
solely by the Bible&#44; and to that standard we must 
submit&#44; let the world say what they will&#44; unless they 
can show that there is any authoritative repeal which 
would absolve our conscience from any farther alle&#8211; 
giance to the revelation contained in the Scriptures. 
But so far from all this being the case&#44; all en&#8211; 
lightened persons admit the superior morality and 
force of the word of God &#59; and whilst denying the 
ceremonial obligations&#44; they claim as a precious right 
whatever else they find therein&#44; prizing it as the rich&#8211; 
est possession which the Lord could possibly bestow 
on man. And still we are denounced as infidels and 
unbelievers for the highest exercise of faith and truth&#44; 
in hoping unfalteringly in the perfection of God&#39;s 
words and promises&#33; True&#44; we cannot share the 
belief of the vast majorities of the inhabitants of the 
world&#59; in England&#44; in Tartary&#44; in China&#44; in Ilindos&#8211; 
tan&#44; in Nigretia&#44; and the Republics of America&#44; we 
testify against the truth of the popular beliefs&#59; but 
not because we are particularly concerned about their 
various religions&#44; but only because we have received 
ourselves a religion which we prize as the highest 
truth&#44; and which we must continue to regard in that 
light&#44; let other men believe what they may. It is a

popular error&#44; and an error notwithstaiuling it is so 
generally entertained&#44; that Jews are particularly bos&#8211; 
lile to one system of the gentiles or the other&#44; and 
the ruling majorities in various countries debate 
fiercely&#44; whether according to their peculiar principles 
they can admit the Jews to a participation of&#8211;&#8211;the 
rights of man notwithstanding their belief&#44; as they 
fancy that there is something injurious to the state 
to be feared in letting a Jew have the privileges 
which he claims as his own. But if mankind would 
only consider that we are not Israelites out of oppo&#8211; 
sition to them&#44; but only because we have received a 
religion founded upon universal love&#44; based upon uni&#8211; 
versal wisdom&#44; and that nothing we can do as Jews 
but would conduce to the benefit of all the world&#58; they 
would surely cease to injure and oppress us&#44; as has 
been the custom too much hitherto. Our viewing 
all religions except ours as more or less erroneous 
concerns in nowise the personal rights of others&#59; but 
it only confers on us the obligation to remain steadfast 
in our observances&#44; notwithstanding others teach that 
they have been abolished in the establishment of an 
alleged new revelation&#44; of which we have no sufficient 
knowledge&#44; and which we cannot admit as true with 
the evidence presented to us. &#8212; It may then happen 
that we may &#8211;be looked upon by those differing from 
us with distrust and jealousy&#44; because we M&#8211;ill not 
yield our conviction to their appeals&#59; but let us re&#8211; 
main undismayed&#44; we are still in possession of the 
same faith with which Moses and the Israelites of 
his day were blessed &#59; it Avas true when we alone 
knew of an eternal God&#44; and it continues to be so 
notwithstanding so many nations have learned in a

measure to know the God who made lieaveu and 
earth. Bat&#44; brethren&#44; the struggle is not&#44; therefore&#44; 
ended&#44; and we must even suffer the contumely&#44; if there 
be any&#44; for being distinguished from the gentiles&#59; and 
let us boldly then bear the testimony which we have 
always done&#44; that our Lord is the sole Creator and 
saving Power&#44; and that it is only in obedience to his 
will that we continue to observe the annual Passover 
and other ceremonies as memorials to everlasting&#44; 
and to prove that we are not wearied to wait for his 
kingdom&#44; and that we hope for his salvation&#44; and the 
kindling of the great light which is to fill all the earth 
with the knowledge of the pure truth&#44; as the waters 
cover the bed of the sea&#59; and on that day we shall be 
joined by all flesh in the adoration of the One and 
only Supreme in sincerity and holiness. Amen.

Brethren &#33; 

The idea of worship is extremely natural to man. 
He feels himself powerless&#44; and beholds all around 
him evidences of the existence of a Being mightier 
far than he is&#44; and hence he feels impelled&#44; by the 
very weakness inherent in him&#44; to seek the aid and 
protection of Iliin whom he justly deems as power&#8211; 
ful to save. Since&#44; however&#44; the attention is in gen&#8211; 
eral too much distracted by surrounding objects&#44; and 
as interrui&#41;tions in the intercourse with the family&#44; or 
on the public highways&#44; are too numerous to allow 
the mind to be properly abstracted&#58; it has been from 
time immemorial the custom of mankind to erect 
separate structures&#44; and to dedicate them foitnally for 
the worship of what they thought the power able to 
lielp them&#44; or&#44; in other words&#44; their God&#44; and they 
performed therein those rites and acts which they 
deemed justly or unjustly calculated to propitiate 
their respective deities. Ceremonies and postures&#44; 
which would appear unbecoming and onerous if per&#8211;

formed and exhibited in the ftimily&#8211;circle&#44; assumed a 
position and propriety in the pubHc temple&#59; and 
hence&#44; even were there no other source&#44; arose by de&#8211; 
grees the peculiarities attending public worship in 
the houses especially dedicated for this purpose. But 
it is not to be supposed that all men would ao&#8211;ree in 
their ideas as to what should make up the sum of 
the peculiarities of their worship&#44; and they have al&#8211; 
ways differed in proportion to the views they enter&#8211; 
tained of the nature and power of the Godhead. 
Hence they who believed in a multitude of powers 
among whom they&#44; though falsely&#44; conceived the 
superintendence of the various functions of the world 
were divided&#44; required a multitude of temples&#44; groves&#44; 
or secluded grottos&#44; adapted to the peculiarities of 
the various divinities&#44; each of whom had his especial 
ceremonies&#44; emblems&#44; and decorations&#44; and not rarely 
a particular order of attendants&#44; either male or fe&#8211; 
male&#44; to perform the obligatory ceremonies apper&#8211; 
taining to the place. If you look a little into any 
book treating of the antiquities of Egypt&#44; Italy&#44; or 
Greece&#44; the matter will be perfectly clear to you&#59; 
and you will then understand how the sea&#44; or its tu&#8211; 
telary divinity&#44; the sky&#44; the earth&#44; and every visible 
object&#44; and the invisible causes which control our life&#44; 
as wisdom&#44; fortune&#44; love&#44; discord&#44; peace&#44; and the like&#44; 
were all represented under some outward shape&#44; with 
peculiar symbols&#44; and were supposed to inhabit pecu&#8211; 
liar localities&#44; where they might be most readily ap&#8211; 
proached&#44; and they had also each their worship&#44; 
sacrifices&#44; and attendant priests and priestesses&#44; as 
was thought most conformable to their especial char&#8211; 
acteristics. And even since the heathenish rites of

these various countries have yielded to the progress 
of enlightenment&#44; since their temples fell and their 
idols stooped before new systems which far exceed 
thcni in Ijcauty and trntli &#58; their errors have not totally 
vanished&#44; and many of the false ideas especially de&#8211; 
rived from them have descended down to our day&#44; 
among nations who vaunt of a knowledge of things 
superior to Vvhat they allege to exist in Israel. It is 
true no churches are now erected to the sun or the 
moon&#44; to fortune or to wisdom&#59; but they are never&#8211; 
theless called by certain names derived from some 
peculiar imagined manifestation of the godhead&#44; or 
even after men who are presumed according to the 
common assumption to have obtained during their 
lifetime a high state of sanctity&#44; and have been 
hence enrolled by the judgment of fallible mortals 
on a list of beatified souls&#44; who are vainly supposed 
to have a certain influence with tlie deity whom tbey 
invoke. Those of you who have been in foreign 
lands&#44; and all of you who have taken the least trouble 
to be informed concerning what is done abroad&#44; or 
even under your own observation near the doors of 
your own dwellings&#44; must be able to call to mind the 
amplest confirmation of what I now state to jou &#59; 
and farther it will be apparent&#44; upon a slight inspec&#8211; 
tion of the customs of some of our neighbours&#44; that 
they have borrowed another feature from ancient 
paganism&#44; in the establishment of orders of ascetics&#44; 
with peculiar dresses&#44; manners&#44; vows&#44; and vocations&#44; 
named after some presumed manifestation of divine 
persons&#44; or some accredited saint&#44; who first instituted 
the respective order with its characteristic and dis&#8211; 
tinctive features. Then we shall see these saints or 

<pb n="281"/>

MODES OF WORSHIP. 281 

manifestations represented by the chisel of the sculp&#8211; 
tor or the pencil of the painter&#44; in all imaginable va&#8211; 
rieties of position and colour&#44; and we shall find even 
these dead and meanino&#8211;less tio&#8211;ures obtaining&#59; a con&#8211; 
sideration which mere marble and canvas&#44; or gold 
and silver images&#44; ought in no manner to receive&#59; 
and even more yet we shall discover&#44; to shock our 
ideas of what is worshipful&#44; in the well&#8211;known tact 
that immense importance has been and is still at&#8211; 
tached to fancied relics of certain implements of tor&#8211; 
ture and the remains of the bodies of departed saints. 
It is nothing libellous which I utter&#59; but sober facts&#44; 
which are verified by an inspection of the manners 
of the most enlightened nations of the present day &#59; 
and the many elegant structures&#44; under the names of 
churches&#44; cathedrals&#44; chapels&#44; convents&#44; and monas&#8211; 
teries&#44; and the vast collections of works of art&#44; in 
stone&#44; in metal&#44; in wood&#44; and in ivory&#44; in painting 
and sculptures&#44; in shrines and in reliquaries&#44; all 
viewed with veneration and respect by those who put 
faith in them&#44; amply testify to the truth of what is 
stated. It is true that Ihey profess to have no respect 
for the particular objects as things to be adored&#44; and 
that they oniy view them as materials for reflection&#44; 
leading to an adoration of the Godhead &#59; but they 
cannot deny&#44; at the same time&#44; that they value the 
syml&#41;ols as something liol&#41;&#8211;&#44; and would regard their 
violation as meriting condign punishment&#42; by the arm 
of the civil power. If we now take cognizance of 

&#42; Indeetl&#44; many of our people have boon put to death for the 
fancied crime of maltreating the .siicnunental wafer of the church. 
Shocking&#44; indeed&#44; but too true.

tliis outward symbolism&#44; coupled with the institution 
of the various orders of male and female priesthood&#44; 
each of them bound by some peculiar oath or oblio&#8211;a&#8211; 
tion&#44; in consequence of which they are compelled to 
perform duties not belonging to other men and 
women&#44; or held to abstain from many indulgences 
lawfully allowed to other persons&#58; it will be apparent 
that much of what was originally derived from hea&#8211; 
then manners of worship&#44; and pagan ideas about pro&#8211; 
pitiating the gods&#44; has passed over into the manners of 
our own age&#44; and is&#44; for all that we can see&#44; likely to 
continue in force for an indefinite time to come&#59; for 
though it seemed at one period that superstition was 
fast waning from the earth&#44; recent developments 
have&#44; alas&#33; proved that the battle for what is true 
and holy will have to be fought again in our day&#44; and 
even after we are gone&#44; so far as a mortal&#39;s reason 
will allow us now to see into the future. 

But it is with our mode of worship as with our 
moral duties &#59; for&#44; as these are established on a firm 
basis simply by the command of God&#44; so is the espe&#8211; 
cial obligation&#44; naturally springing up in the human 
breast to show by outward acts the inward devotion&#44; 
sanctified and limited by the instruction which God 
gave to our teacher Moses. Let us well understand 
the nature of duty. It is to do that which is demanded 
of us&#59; hence in doing what is not required we may 
act pleasingly to our divine Father&#44; but we fulfil no 
duty&#59; since the particular act in question is nowise 
obligatory on us&#44; and can only be considered meri&#8211; 
torious&#44; inasmuch as it may contribute to the glory 
of God and the well&#8211;being of the human family&#44; whom 
to serve and love is next to the love of God our first 

<pb n="283"/>

MODES OF WORSHIP. 283 

oblig&#8211;ation. Still as religion is something specific&#44; it 
is evident that all that is not prohibited is not there&#8211; 
fore lawful &#59; especially if it is attempted to enforce an 
act on others as a duty&#44; and when its adoption is 
urged along with other especial ordinances which are 
the peculiar province of religion. I do not now refer 
to any particular matter&#44; but to the general idea of 
duty&#44; and I wish then to define it as that which God 
demands of ns&#44; or permits us to do in his blessed rev&#8211; 
elation. Now we are not commanded in so many 
words that we should pray or ask the aid of the Lord&#59; 
but the history of the great ones of former ages is 
given to us&#44; and it is announced at the same time 
that their entreaties were accepted on High as a pro&#8211; 
pitiatory offering to the Supreme. In one instance it 
is said &#8212; I refer to the case of Abimelcch &#8212; that Abra&#8211; 
ham should pray for him&#44; that he might live&#59; and 
this with the example of other saints gives us accord&#8211; 
ingly the assurance&#44; that the natural impulse which 
we feel in the moments of our helplessness to call ou 
the Almighty for assistance is both proper and ejffi.&#8211; 
cacious &#59; and hence we may lawfully include the reg&#8211; 
ular recitation of prayers as a duty incumbent on us 
all the days of our life&#44; since there is not a moment 
in our existence&#44; when we are able to proceed in our 
course without the blessing&#34; of Him who lets the sun 
shine by day&#44; and the moon and stars hy night&#44; whose 
arc the earth and all that tills it&#44; the sea and its vast 
domain&#44; the Lord of Hosts is his name. It results 
hence&#44; that if prayer is a part of our duty&#44; it is not so 
merely once in a long while when the pressure of cir&#8211; 
cumstances pinches us&#44; and compels us for the nonce 
to acknowledge a Supreme Power&#44; but every d&#58;iy of

onr life&#44; when we enjoy liis bounty or feel afllicted 
by his chastisement. 

When therefore we had been redeemed from Egypt&#44; 
and God had made himself manifest to our outward 
senses in the bestowal of the Decalogue&#44; He at once 
divested our mind of any specialty of time or place 
when and where He was to be Avorsliipped. It was 
not told us to wait asking for mercy till we arrived 
at a certain spot&#44; or till the approach of a particular 
moment of time&#59; but we were simply informed&#44; &#34;In 
whatever place I shall permit my name to be men&#8211; 
tioned&#44; will I come and bless thee&#59;&#34; be it on the 
mountain&#8211;top&#44; or in the caverns of the earth&#44; in the 
field or the columned temple&#44; it is all the same &#58; we 
call on the great and adoral&#41;le l&#94;ame&#44; and He will be 
there and bless us with his favour &#59; for as God is uni&#8211; 
versal&#44; his power everywhere&#44; and his providence 
watching in every spot&#58; so will his goodness be near 
to help those who have no aid but their invisible King&#44; 
who unseen by all&#44; and felt by everything that has 
breath&#44; is nigh at hand to lift up those who are bowed 
down&#44; and to open the bonds of those who are enfet&#8211; 
tered. In no stronger manner could the Almighty 
have annihilated with a single phrase all the baseless 
fabrics of heathenism&#44; which assigned special habita&#8211; 
tions to its different gods&#44; and demanded often unnat&#8211; 
ural ami absurd rites and sacriiices to propitiate the 
capricious demons of its invention. With God it was 
and is every place&#44; and with Him it is the mention 
of his name&#59; and both these requirements are in the 
power of every human being to satisfy&#44; and thus he 
can worship every moment and at every place. 

Nevertheless wo were told fit the same time to erect 

<pb n="285"/>

MODES OF WORSHIP. 285 

unto God an altar of earth&#44; to sacrifice thereon any 
offering which we might vohuitarily offer up to Ilim&#44; 
according to the example of our patriarchs&#59; for ex&#8211; 
cept the Passover&#8211;lamb no other sacrifice had been 
demanded of us at the time the law was given &#59; thus 
denoting that&#44; though the Lord is universal&#44; wo are 
authorized to cor3ecrate to Him certain places&#44; as 
especially devoted to his service. But the simplest 
material was asked &#59; no elaborate work of art&#44; no 
sculptured statuary&#44; no flaunting pictures were to dec&#8211; 
orate the altar&#59; &#34;an altar of earth shalt thou make 
unto me&#59;&#34; and if perchance we might desire to erect 
one of stone&#44; it was limited to rude blocks as they are 
taken from the earth&#44; for the iron tool employed in 
dressing them would be profaning our labour&#44; thus 
emphatically interdicting any symbolic ornament or 
configuration upon the material of the altar&#44; whether 
these figures were alto&#8211; or basso&#8211;relievos&#44; wdi ether for 
worship&#44; symbolism&#44; or commemoration&#59; no&#44; the 
blocks were to be piled one on the other&#44; with noth&#8211; 
ing but cement to hold them together&#44; and nothing 
but that simple material wherewith to cover the out&#8211; 
side and to render smooth the rough surface. Thus 
simply was our altar to be constituted &#59; so rude&#44; if you 
will&#44; divested of all art and its concomitant labour 
and evil consequences&#44; were to be the places espe&#8211; 
cially dedicated to the Lord of heaven and earth. For 
wdiat need was there to represent Ilini or his attri&#8211; 
butes by outward symbols&#44; signs&#44; or tokens &#63; can we 
reach even an approximation of what He is by any 
sign&#44; figure or grouping which our art can invent&#63;

daringly attempted to convey their conceptions of the 
attributes of the Divinity &#58; and you must acknowl&#8211; 
edge their .veakness&#44; their folly&#44; their wickedness and 
absurdity&#44; without any appeal from any one or ref&#8211; 
erence even to the hiw. The thing speaks for itself. 
So tlien&#44; the very materials for our altar were to be 
the reverse of art or ornament&#44; not that art or orna&#8211; 
ment is in itself sinful&#44; but because it was best to wor&#8211; 
ship the Most High in the simplicity of nature&#44; in all 
the grandeur of humility &#59; for before Him who is ex&#8211; 
alted and the supreme over all&#44; the greatest decora&#8211; 
tion sinks into utter insignificance and meaningless 
show. 

Still was the whole system of worship not exhausted 
by the permission of universal prayer and the erec&#8211; 
tion of a simple altar. God disdains not the homage 
of his creatures&#44; although all we have comes from his 
hand&#44; and we only give unto Him from what He has 
bestowed on us. Nay more&#44; He vouchsafed to tell 
unto Moses&#44; 

&#34; And they shall make me a sanctuary&#44; and I will dwell among 
tiieni.&#34; Exodus xxv. 8. 

He whom the heavens cannot contain&#44; in whom 
the universe exists&#44; promises to dwell in a sanctuary 
the work of the hands of man. We must understand 
this verse well &#59; it is not said by this that God&#39;s es&#8211; 
sence should be confined to the space within the four 
walls thus to be erected &#59; but that ihrough this struc&#8211; 
ture&#44; so established&#44; there should be present a greater 
and closer manifestation of his power than can be at&#8211;

tuineJ ill any other spot on the earth&#44; and the sanc&#8211; 
tuary would thus become not alone metaphorically&#44; 
but literally&#44; the residence of the glory of the Most 
High&#44; whilst at the same time his providence and 
mercy would be&#44; as they would be without the exist&#8211; 
ence of the tabernacle&#44; pervading all space at all times 
and seasons. But there is a peculiarity observable 
in the command for the erection of the sanctuary&#44; and 
it is found in the words immediately succeeding those 
just quoted&#44; &#34;All just as I am showing thee&#44; the model 
of the tabernacle&#44; and the model of all its vessels&#44; thus 
only shall ye make it.&#34; When it was thus told us 
that we were permitted to imitate other nations in 
the erection of a structure for worship&#44; and when thus 
certified that it was become our duty to devote a por&#8211; 
tion of our possessions in this manner to the service 
of the Lord &#58; it was at the same time made manifest 
that&#44; like all other duties&#44; it was to be lawful only 
within specified limitations&#44; and that to do more or 
less would render it unacceptable to the Deity A 
miraculous image of the tabernacle was exhibited to 
Moses&#44; whilst he was in communion with the God of 
Israel during forty days and forty nights on Mount 
oiiiai &#59; the shape of every vessel&#44; of the altars&#44; the ark&#44; 
the candelabrum&#44; the table&#44; the laver&#44; and in brief 
every part in the most minute details&#44; was exhibited 
to him&#44; and he was told&#44; &#34; Thus shall ye make it&#59;&#34; 
and hence when Moses was afterwards satisfied &#34; that 
all had been made as the Lord had commanded him&#44;&#34; 
he blessed the workmen who had been filled with 
divine knowledge to fulfil their task&#59; because they 
had strictly conformed to the duty assigned to them&#44; 
and had not added to nor diminished from the exact 

<pb n="288"/>

288 MODES OF WORSHIP. 

line of duty which had been pointed out to them in 
this respect. This now must teach us the important 
lesson &#58; that it is not the elegance of the structure 
which we erect for worship which renders it accept&#8211; 
able to our Master&#44; but it is our acting in consonance 
with his will&#44; and from a motive on which He inhis 
knowledge of our heart can bestow his approbation. 
It is not the fretted roof&#44; nor the burnished gold&#44; nor 
the carpeted floor&#44; nor the beauty of the design 
which can sanctify the outward house of God&#44; when 
the inward man is corrupt&#44; and he prides himself in 
his liberality so ostentatiously displayed&#44; and seeks 
for new ways to worship God&#44; which are not embraced 
in the law. JSTor does it materially enhance the value 
of the temple whether it be large and elegantly dec&#8211; 
orated&#44; so it only be in accordance with the pre&#8211; 
scribed forms of religion and commensurate with the 
means of its builders. The essence of the sanctuary 
is obedience &#59; with it a small building of rude boards&#44; 
or even a temporary tent in the wilderness&#44; is a recep&#8211; 
tacle for the glory &#59; witliout it the temples of Solomon 
and of Ilerod became odious in the sight of the Al&#8211; 
mighty Judge&#44; and He had them swept off the earth 
by the fire of the enemies of Israel. 

Yes&#44; worship&#44; natural as it is to man&#44; should not be 
performed from this motive solely &#59; but only because 
it is permitted to us by our Father&#44; to honour Him with 
the words of our lips&#44; and to ask his aid in the time 
of our need. We should erect synagogues where we 
can meet for the common worship of our common 
Father&#44; nndistraeted by domestic cares&#44; and uninter&#8211; 
rupted by our daily avocations. But they should be 
l&#41;uilt in the fear of God&#44; and their foundation be laid

in the inward adoration which our liearts owe to Him&#44; 
because He is great&#44; because He is good and holj. 
It is fixrther our duty not to resort to foreign instruc&#8211; 
tion to direct us how to worship&#59; but we should &#34;ask 
our fathers and they are to tell us&#44; and our elders 
who shall declare it unto us&#59;&#34; we cannot search in 
the annals of error for our guide to the presence of 
the Most High&#44; but only in the Scriptures which we 
have received&#44; and there we shall learn that to Him 
the high and low are alike &#59; that He respects no per&#8211; 
sons&#59; that He asks for no mediator&#59; that He alone is 
our God and our Saviour&#44; and that hence all Israel&#44; 
no matter who and where they are&#44; should&#44; as they 
are permitted by his providence&#44; enter the places 
sacred to his Name&#44; and there in unison with their 
fellows of Jacob&#39;s seed pray in direct terms for mercy 
and favour&#44; and obtain instruction in the words of 
salvation&#44; rendered common property by the gift of 
God to all the descendants of Israel. It is not worldly 
greatness which constitutes Israel&#39;s glory&#59; for what 
people is lowlier&#44; less regarded&#44; less loved&#44; than the 
wandering tribes of Jacob &#63; But our excellence con&#8211; 
sists in the possession of our religion&#44; and this then is 
the true ornament of the synagogue&#44; and its promo&#8211; 
tion is the chief aim of public worship. You can 
pray devoutly and acceptably at home&#59; your Father 
in heaven stands by in his glory to receive the hom&#8211; 
age of sincere lips which is offered to Him on all the 
earth &#59; nevertheless it is the assembly of the faithful&#44; 
in the houses wherein his Name is called&#44; that we arc 
animated by each other&#39;s example&#44; and urged forward 
by onr common bond of brotherhood. If one is weak

the same tribute of obedience in worshipping accord&#8211;

of ancient days&#44; in whom youth is no token of vigour

and to save. Only let the sanctuarj&#8211; be sanctiiied by 
the spirit which hallowed the temple in its palmy 
days&#44; and there will be the presence of the Lord ex&#8211; 
perienced&#44; even here and at this time&#44; so far from Pal&#8211; 
estine&#44; so remote from the land of our birth. But if 
we follow in the errors of the gentiles&#44; if outward 
beauty is to be exhibited whilst the inward sanctifica&#8211; 
tion is wanting&#58; better far would it be that we meet 
in the recesses of the forest or under the shadow of 
some overhanging clitf&#44; if only there be holiness in 
the hearts of all&#44; and mutual good&#8211;will and friendship

In the lesson from the Pentateuch which we read 
this day are the following words &#58; 

&#34; All as the Lord hud commanded Moses&#44; so made the children 
of Israel all the service. And when Moses saw all the work&#44; and 
beheld they had made it&#44; as the Lord had commanded&#44; so had they 
done&#44; then Moses blessed them.&#8211; Exodus&#44; xxxix. 42&#44; 43. 

These verses are a part&#44; and this the concluding 
portion of the history of the erection of the taber&#8211; 
nacle which our fathers made in the desert&#44; together 
with all the appurtenances and the priestly garments&#44;

and the matters belonging to the service connected 
therewith &#59; and they then say&#44; that precisely as Moses 
had been instructed&#44; so did the artists accomplish the 
task assigned to them&#44; and though excelling in inven&#8211; 
tive power&#44; and endowed with skill to carry out their 
ideas&#44; they did not depart from the instruction and 
charge given to them&#44; simply obeying what they had 
been taught as their duty&#59; and when the great 
teacher found this to be the case&#44; he bestowed his 
benediction&#44; and thereby expressed the satisfaction 
of the Divine Mind&#44; whose mouthpiece he was&#44; on 
those who had accomplished the work of preparing 
the habitation for the Name of the Lord. This is the 
simple exposition of our text&#44; and its words mean 
nothing else in their evident tendency. But they 
teach us a lesson&#44; which is also applicable to the pres&#8211; 
ent day&#44; and will be so likewise to the end of all our 
generations &#59; and it is accordingly not without a wise 
purpose&#44; that in last week&#39;s and to&#8211;day&#39;s sections the 
very words almost of Therumah and Thetzavveh are 
repeated &#59; as this is evidently done to show the exact 
correspondence between the command and the obe&#8211; 
dience. 

Here my sermon on the text I have chosen might 
well and fittingly end&#44; although I have but just com&#8211; 
menced. It requires no skill to apply the lesson to 
our life&#44; to the practical workings of an every&#8211;day 
existence. But even familiar subjects gain by dis&#8211; 
cussion&#44; and self&#8211;evident truths become stronger im&#8211; 
pressed on the mind when they are illustrated more 
completely&#39; to our satisfaction &#59; and so let us travel 
together a brief space&#44; to study the nature of the 
Jewish religion&#44; as illustrated by the text. 

25&#42; 

<pb n="294"/>

294 STRICT OBEDIENCE. 

If you seriously listen to the arguments of gentiles&#44; 
and to the assertion of many Jews&#44; even of some 
who profess to be religious&#44; you would be almost dis&#8211; 
gusted with your religion&#44; upon the allegation that 
we are without spirit&#44; without any high appreciation 
of pure faith&#44; and only bound to the dead letter of 
form and ceremony&#59; and then it is asserted by a 
parity of reasoning that the spirit is every thing&#44; and 
the letter and the observance of its plain meaning a 
matter of no vital importance&#44; but on the coutrary&#44; a 
sort of hindrance to the acquisition of holiness ob&#8211; 
tainable in some way by a course of thought and 
action not based on the words&#44; but the spirit of re&#8211; 
ligion. There is a great confusion of terms and ideas 
in all this&#59; but it is just as I have ever been able to 
comprehend it. A professed great value is thus at&#8211; 
tached to mere feelings&#44; things in themselves not cog&#8211; 
nizable by the outward eye&#44; and which&#44; therefore&#44; a 
man may allege to possess&#44; without being in reality 
imbued with them in the remotest desrree. Mere 
Avords cost nothing&#59; and in truth&#44; very often one is 
exceedingly eloquent and loud concerning that of 
which he knows the least&#44; and which really affects 
him to a very small extent&#59; and instances are not 
wanting where men persecuted others for not enter&#8211; 
taining speculative dogmas&#44; of which they themselves 
had neither knowledge nor actual conviction. If now 
religion is required to reside in the spirit only and if 
no acts are needed to demonstrate its existence&#44; there 
would be at once a great absurdity involved&#59; for 
what value would religion have&#44; if it is not to regu&#8211; 
late the conduct&#63; The very savage would be su&#8211; 
perior&#44; in his natural impulsive action&#44; to the refined 

<pb n="295"/>

STRICT OBEDIENCE. 295 

thinker wlio regulates the inward man exdusively&#44; 
without bestowing any care on externals. It is thus 
evident&#44; that it is not intended to define religion to 
consist mcrchjin thoughts&#59; since evidently the veriest 
spiritualist demands some sort of action in corres&#8211; 
pondence with his principles&#59; and though there are 
not wanting examples of those who taught that to the 
saints&#44; as they are arrogantly called&#44; everything is per&#8211; 
mitted&#44; and those who inculcate that wrong may be 
done that good may come out of it &#58; it is a fortunate 
thing that such monstrous doctrines have received 
the abhorrence of mankind. Society is based upon 
something stronger than speculation &#59; the security of 
the public demands conformance to certain fixed laws&#59; 
and hence no one will be permitted to offend against 
them by the profession&#44; that he is governed by the 
spirit which dictated the statutes of the common&#8211; 
wealth&#44; whilst he thinks that the letter which pro&#8211; 
hibits and enjoins certain things&#44; was not meant for 
one of so subhme a soul as he is&#44; though perfectly 
applicable to the less enlightened. 

The only real distinction&#44; then&#44; between professors 
of relig&#8211;ion&#44; the true servants of God and friends of 
humanity&#44; can be the number of the acts which are 
deemed requisite &#59; and if this is once admitted as the 
true standard&#44; then it is a simple matter of diiierence 
of quantity&#44; not as regards the necessity of acts&#59; and 
hence&#44; if one deems a single act of religion or mo&#8211; 
rality requisite in obedience to his religion&#44; he is as 
little spiritual as regards this one&#44; as though he deemed 
as requisite to his salvation and practised a thousand 
actrs. &#8212; Do not then be terrified by the word formalist&#44; 
which has occasionally been applied to Jews who

think themselves bound to lay TeJUlin&#59; to wear a 
Tatliih&#59; to lix a Mezuzah to the door&#8211;posts of their 
houses and their gates&#59; to address their Maker in 
words of prayer three times every day&#59; to abstain 
from certain food&#59; to fast on the appointed da3&#94;s&#59; to 
rest on the Sabbath&#44; and so on with other command&#8211; 
ments. If this be the only fault which can be found 
with you&#44; you need not blush for your course of life&#44; 
nor for your rehgion&#44; nor for your people who act on 
the same principles. For you are then acting in obe&#8211; 
dience to the essence of religion&#44; and prove that the 
teaching of your God has not been lost upon you. 
But then other men do not Avear Tetillin &#63; other relig&#8211;

True&#44; most true&#59; but then you are Israelites&#59; you 
have received instruction as to what the Lord asks of 
you &#59; and since you believe that both the letter and 
the spirit of the faith 30U have are derived from 
Him&#44; that is to say&#44; that you are tauglit how to be&#8211; 
lieve and how to act in obedience to the commands 
of your Maker&#44; you can have no excuse&#44; no pretence 
whatever for relying on the practices or professions 
of others for your course of conduct. You are not 
to go around among heathens or unbelievers in rev&#8211; 
elation&#44; nor among Mahomedans and Nazarenes&#44; nor 
among Catholics and Protestants&#44; nor among Univer&#8211; 
salists and Unitarians&#44; nor among philosophers and 
atheists&#44; to ask them &#34; What is your opinion of this or 
the other Mosaic precept&#63; have you reflected on it&#63; 
do you deem it reasonable&#63; have you adopted it in

vinced you&#63;&#34; No&#44; brethren &#33; it is no concern of 
yours &#59; you have uo religious connexion with any 
one man&#44; nor all mankind together&#59; if the one or 
the whole act according to the instruction you have 
received&#44; then it is so much the better&#44; so much more 
conducive to their individual and eternal happiness&#59; 
but if the cue or the whole differ from you&#44; how does 
this affect your obligation &#63; your sense of duty &#63; your 
superior religious education &#63; Yes&#44; education is the 
word&#59; you were redeemed from Egypt&#44; not merely 
that you might be no longer slaves to the sons of 
Mitzrayim&#44; though this was also an object of the 
Deity&#44; but that the Lord might be your God&#59; as we 
read in Leviticus xxv. 55 &#58; &#34; For unto me are the sons 
of Israel servants&#59; my servants they are&#44; whom I 
have brought out from the land of Egypt&#44; I am the 
Lord your God.&#34; And again&#44; xxvi. 45 &#58; &#34; And I will 
remember unto thera the covenant with the ancients&#44; 
whom I have brought forth from the land of Egypt 
before the eyes of the nations&#44; to be unto them a 
God&#59; I am the Lord.&#34; So then we must maintain&#44; 
without enlarging particularly on this subject at the 
present moment&#44; that our dwelling in Egypt and our 
liberation from it were intended as our education for 
the divine service. 

The Lord desired to raise up a family of men to 
whom his name and his worship were to be a per&#8211; 
petual heirloom&#59; and He therefore tried them in the 
furnace of affliction&#44; and impressed on their mind 
the never&#8211;to&#8211;he&#8211;forgotten conviction of his greatness&#44; 
goodness&#44; and power&#59; and gave them those laws and 
ordinances which He deemed requisite to their hap&#8211; 
piness. Have other nations the same history &#63; the

same consequent obligation as collective bodies for 
divine favours&#63; have they the same destiny&#63; Evi&#8211; 
dently not &#59; the very chronicles of the world contra&#8211; 
dict such an assumption&#59; and hence their conduct 
cannot of right become a source of inquiry to us&#44; that 
we might act according to their example. The very 
reverse is the case. Long after we were basking in 
the brillmnt sunshine of the holy revelation of our 
eternal Father&#44; fill the people walked each in the 
name of Iws god&#44; the invention of the conceits of 
men &#59; and when in the process of time healing came 
to them through our wounds&#44; when our sorrows and 
bruises redounded to their advantage &#58; it was not a 
new light which was kindled for them &#59; it was not a 
new display of the glorious Majesty&#44; which of old 
blazed before our enraptured eyes&#44; which descended 
unto them &#59; but they accepted a portion of our law 
for their guidance&#44; adopting for their standard the 
mere scintillations of the faith which the Holiest had 
imparted to us. And are we to reduce our religious 
duties&#44; because they have not adopted the whole of 
them &#63; are we to follow them in rejecting what they 
refuse as useless&#44; simply because they follow the 
teaching of men whom God has not sent&#63; who ran 
to announce messages&#44; when He did not command 
them &#63; Is this acting up to the ancient love of Israel 
for God at the time of our espousal&#44; when we became 
united to the Lord of the universe by the ties of love&#44; 
of protection on his part&#44; and obedience on ours&#63; 
When was the dispensation granted &#63; inform us&#44; that 
we may know &#59; not indeed in dark riddles and double&#8211; 
meaning phrases&#44; but in direct terms&#44; so that we may 
understand our new relation to our God&#44; our Father&#44;

onr Lord and our Spouse &#63; Where&#44; if it be as you sny&#44; 
was the spot whence this new light emanated to the 
world&#44; that we may hie thither and worship in a phaco 
so signally favoured by the divine glory&#63; But we 
demand answers in vain&#59; we call for light&#44; bat there 
is no one to show it to us&#59; we are referred to dreams 
of pretended prophets&#44; to the preaching of an alleged 
redeemer&#59; and withal&#44; it is pretended that the law is 
not abolished&#44; that not an iota nor a tittle thereof shall 
pass away whilst heaven and earth endure. Even so 
mote it be &#59; every Israelite&#44; who is true to his God&#44; will 
join in this idea with an emphatic &#34;Amen&#59; yes&#44; 
heaven and earth may vanish&#44; as the grass withers 
and as the flower fades&#44; but the word of our God wnll 
stand forever.&#34; 

If then you are justly accusable of a want of spirit&#8211; 
uality&#44; it cannot be owing to your adhering to your 
religious duties&#44; but to your not observing the pre&#8211; 
cepts from a correct appreciation of their origin and 
their object&#59; or if you are careful of external acts of 
worship&#44; and neglect the duties of personal holiness 
and those relating to the intercourse between man 
and man&#44; or those due from the individual to society. 
To be imbued with the spirit of religion truly&#44; means 
nothing else than that a man feels the sacred obliga&#8211; 
tion of the whole law in every relation of life&#44; when 
he is in youth or age&#44; in public or alone&#44; rich or poor&#44; 
exalted or humble&#59; in every instance there must be 
no break in the connecting bond which unites him 
to God&#44; there must be no link wanting in the chain 
which binds him to the creatures whom his Father 
has placed around him. If we observe the Sabbath&#44; 
which is our holiest testimony to the existence of God&#44;

and that He is the Creator&#58; we sliould at the same 
time be careful not to ofiend by viohitiiigthe prop&#8211; 
erty of our neighbours&#44; nor to injure them in feehng&#44; 
in lionour&#44; or reputation. If we abstain from those 
things which our religion justly calls unclean&#58; there 
must not adhere to our hands the plunder of the 
widow&#44; or the hard&#8211;earned wages of the helpless or&#8211; 
phan. &#8212; If we are devout at the house of God&#44; and 
say with holy unction the prayers which are pre&#8211; 
scribed to us by the ancient teachers of Israel &#58; we 
should not desecrate our lips on our return home by 
slandering the absent&#44; or making the helpless ashamed 
by the bitter taunting words whi&#8211;ch drop from our 
mouth&#44; words oftener more bitter than the stab of the 
assassin&#39;s dagger&#44; for that kills outright the perish&#8211; 
able body&#59; but unkind and wrongly inflicted brutal 
censure rankles for a long life&#8211;time in the soul of the 
afflicted&#44; and they carry often the degradation with 
them to the grave &#59; and so also teach the sages of 
Israel&#58; &#34;He who makes his neighbour&#39;s face blanch 
in public will have no share in the future world&#44; al&#8211; 
though he be possessed of a knowledge of the law 
and have committed many good deeds.&#34; Spirituality 
then means that our mind&#44; the spirit&#44; is thoroughly 
impressed with our relative position to God&#59; and if 
this be the case in sincerity and truth&#44; there can be 
no divergence between outward acts of religion and 
those of morality&#59; between the man before the gaze 
of millions and him in the recesses of his chamber&#44; 
with no eye to see him but that of his God&#39;s provi&#8211; 
dence. Ay&#44; you find but few such&#59; this is readily 
admitted&#59; but this is not the fault of outward acts of 
faith&#44; but is ascribable to the imperfection of human

nature&#44; and that no man is so upright on earth that 
he sin not. This&#44; however&#44; is no excuse for trans&#8211; 
gression &#59; but is only given as an iUustration of a 
well&#8211;known fact&#44; the cause for which is not to be 
found in the existence of religion&#44; but in the lament&#8211; 
able circumstances&#44; that very few&#44; if any&#44; men yield 
themselves entirely to the dictates of their God. Let 
the religion be ever so beautiful&#44; the duties prescribed 
by it ever so beneficial&#44; ever so few&#58; there will be 
always transgressions against the plainest dictates of 
reason&#44; against the most self&#8211;evident advantages re&#8211; 
sulting from the acts demanded. If this is a cause 
of censure to the outwardness of the Jewish cere&#8211; 
monial observances&#59; it is equally so&#44; and in fact to a 
far greater degree&#44; against those who claim a superior 
illumination of the soul by a light&#44; which they allege 
to be o&#8211;ranted to those who have become the elect. 
Sinning in the simple meaning of the word is not 
destroyed by any system of faith or rule of practice&#59; 
but both were given to correct us&#44; the one&#44; the errors 
to which the human mind is liable when uninstructed&#44; 
the other&#44; to point out the acts which are to be done 
to produce the greatest amount of happiness com&#8211; 
patible with the state of individuals and society. The 
very existence of duty proves that something was 
necessary to overcome the evil which untaught hu&#8211; 
man passions would have produced in the world&#59; and 
the frequent neglect thereof only establishes the su&#8211; 
perior excellence of those who abide by it in the 
greatest degree. 

Some will allege that they are good&#44; notwithstand&#8211;

citizens&#44; they are so cliaritaLle&#44; that they fancy every&#8211; 
thing can be atoned for by their good civil deeds. 
They point to the rogueries of some outwardly pious 
persons&#44; to the ill temper of others&#44; to the bigotry 
and want of charity both in feeling and money of an&#8211; 
other party&#59; and then they ask exultingly whether 
they are not far better&#44; though they eat forbidden 
food and labour on the Sabbath &#63; It is surely a mark 
of a diseased mind&#44; to compare seriously one set of 
sins with another&#44; and then demand which is the best 
defect&#33; A defect&#44; a gross sin either of the above 
lines of conduct is to a certainty&#44; and each is fatal to 
the life of the soul&#58; where then is the superior merit 
in either&#63; where the cause of congratulation which 
some utter&#44; &#34; Thank God&#33; that I am not so bad as my 
neighbour&#63;&#34; If one man expires under the influence 
of a violent fever and another from a slow consump&#8211; 
tion&#44; is there any perceptible benefit to the individual 
sufferer that he has escaped the disease which slayS 
his friend &#63; And yet upon such frivolous pretences 
do people stigmatize the strict Jew for his adherence 
to minute forms&#44; what they call trifles&#44; but which the 
Scriptures demand as a part of our duties. The holy 
Record establishes no difference between the qualities 
and degrees of sin&#44; farther than fixing the penalty for 
many social crimes and a few against the religious 
ones proper. But beyond this there is no line of dis&#8211; 
tinction drawn&#44; which points out that the observance 
of the Sabbath is of less importance than the law 
which prohibits stealing&#44; and so with other precepts. 
Doubtless society is more injured&#44; immediately&#44; so far 
as we can judge&#44; by a man&#39;s robbing his neighbour&#59; 
and hence the whole community is alive to punish

liini wlio violates other&#39;s rights and property. But 
no one can tell us&#44; with any show of reason&#44; that to 
the sinner himself the violation of a purely religious 
obligation may not be more injurious than that of a 
mere moral kind. Temptation&#44; poverty&#44; or a mis&#8211; 
taken view of personal rights&#44; may induce a criminal 
violation of property &#59; the very punishment so readily 
meted out is often more than a fair retaliation for the 
wrong inflicted&#59; but to neglect a religious duty is 
often the result of a previously&#8211;studied disregard of 
what has been taught from infancy&#44; and is tantamount 
to a removal of the fear of God from our heart. But 
I will not fall into the error I condemn in others&#44; of 
defining which is the worst sin &#59; our only guide herein 
is the word of God&#44; and whatever that enjoins is duty 
and should be observed&#44; and whatever it prohibits is 
sin and should be carefully avoided. 

Kow let me revert to our text. The tabernacle 
which our fathers built in the wilderness&#44; equally 
with the temple which afterwards was erected in 
Jerusalem&#44; Avas an actual outward thing&#44; not a mere 
spirituality&#44; or a type of something which was to oc&#8211; 
cur thereafter. Men of a dreamy disposition&#44; who 
can fancy nothing real in the most palpable reality&#44; 
have indeed endeavoured to show that the tabernacle 
was not to be for itself&#44; but to foreshadow things to 
happen in future generations&#59; they insist&#44; in accord&#8211; 
ance with their plan&#44; that mere observance is nothing 
in comparison with ideal religion&#44; they remove the re&#8211; 
ality from the erection of a house of God&#44; and en&#8211; 
twine with it a species of mystery &#40;I hardly know what 
word to use&#41; which the letter of the commandment 
does nowise indicate. But to us&#44; Israelites&#44; the erec&#8211;

tion of the tabernacle was a positive duty&#59; each man 
was desired to give what he pleased&#59; and tliey in 
whose heart God had phiced wisdom and knowledge 
were to perfect&#44; after the ordained form&#44; the rough 
materials which the taithful brought in abundance to 
the treasuiy of the sanctuary. &#34;But what was then 
the meritoriousness in all this&#63;&#34; ask our opponents&#44; 
&#34;if you do not look for anything holier or better in 
the tabernacle than its boards&#44; its hangings&#44; its ves&#8211; 
sels&#44; and its internal arrangements&#59; if you see noth&#8211; 
ing more in the order of priesthood than merely a set 
of men devoted to perform the sacrifices and attend 
to the other duties imposed on them&#59; when you be&#8211; 
hold in the sacrifices merely the blood and the flesh 
of brute victims which were slaughtered in expiation 
of the sins of the sacrificers &#63;&#34; But there is one thing&#44; 
after all&#44; which is forgotten in all these questions&#44; and 
that is&#44; that we did not originate the manner of erect&#8211; 
ing the tabernacle&#59; we did not ourselves estal&#41;lish the 
priesthood in Aaron and his sons &#59; we did not invent 
the order of sacrifices&#44; nor did we teach that the blood 
of them atoned for the soul &#59; but all sprung from the 
will of God&#44; who so desired a habitation for his glory&#59; 
so sanctified Aaron and his sons from the midst of 
the children of Israel&#59; so ordered his altar to be fed 
with the flesh of burnt&#8211;otFerings and the fiit of sacri&#8211; 
fices for trespass and sin&#44; and thanksgiving and vol&#8211; 
untary sacrifices. There was&#44; therefore&#44; but one spirit 
presiding over the whole arrangement&#44; as over the 
Sabbath&#44; parental love&#44; filial obedience&#44; and other du&#8211; 
ties &#8212; it was&#44; in a word&#44; &#40;&#41;l&#41;edience &#8212; a readiness to do&#44; 
because God had commanded. It was therefore not 
the elegance of the work which the Israelites had

completed&#44; but the exactitude with which they had 
followed the directions which the prophet had re&#8211; 
ceived from the mouth of Supreme Glory which de&#8211; 
manded and obtained his blessing&#44; as we are told &#58; 
&#34;All as the Lord had commanded Moses&#44; so had 
made the Israelites all the service.&#34; I have preferred 
rendering the word mD>&#39; otherwise used to designate 
the outward worship&#44; literally with &#34; service&#44;&#34; and we 
may be sure that it was not em&#94;Dloyed without design. 
Thus the nr&#94;Sn work&#44; performed by Bezalel and Aho&#8211; 
liab&#44; and others&#44; was at the same time a service unto 
the Most High&#44; because&#44; gifted as they had been with 
all knowledge&#44; they had not added of their own in&#8211; 
vention to the prescribed form&#44; number&#44; and dimen&#8211; 
sions of the things they made&#59; bat they had truly 
served their God by fulfilling his commands to the 
fullest extent of the instruction which they had re&#8211; 
ceived. It was&#44; however&#44; not a blind&#44; unreasoning 
obedience&#44; but an act of faith&#59; an obedience because 
the Supreme Wisdom had thought it best that so He 
would be honoured by the work of the hands of his 
creatures. Therefore&#44; when Moses saw this&#44; how the 
highest perfection of human intellect had been ex&#8211; 
erted to worship the Most Higli in simple obedience&#44; 
he blessed the faithful servants who had so well ac&#8211; 
complished their whole task. The work was out&#8211; 
wardly done&#44; but the spirit was sanctified&#59; and there&#8211; 
fore only could the glory of the Lord dwell in the 
fabric thus made&#44; thus finished&#44; in exact conformity 
with his revealed will. If it had been a thousand 
times larger&#44; a thousand times more beautiful&#44; it 
would not have obtained the Lord&#39;s approbation&#59; be&#8211; 
cause He&#44; in whom the world exists&#44; requires no habi&#8211;

tation wliicli we can erect for his dwelling. But when 
the sou&#33; is subdued&#44; penetrated with the sacredness 
of his being&#44; and conscious that to Ilim all obedience 
is due &#58; then will He come&#44; unending as is his majesty&#44; 
and be evident in our midst&#44; and his blessing will 
make even for us the rugged path of life&#44; and our 
eje will behold the wonders of his law&#44; and as we 
grow older we shall become wiser&#44; and the nearer we 
approach the brink of the grave the riper shall we be 
for heaven. 

You need not then be ashamed&#44; sons and daugh&#8211; 
ters of Israel &#33; that such is the religion which you pro&#8211; 
fess&#44; which points out to you the path you should 
travel while on earth&#44; and which opens for you the 
portals of heaven when you depart hence according 
to the inevitable decree of your Father and God. 
Only live in his fear&#44; only walk in his way&#44; and you 
may travel on securely amidst the dangers which be&#8211; 
set your path &#59; and when on earth&#44; your steps will be 
guarded that you stumble not&#59; and when your days 
are ended&#44; you will rest securely in your graves until 
the last awakening from the sleep of death&#44; and your 
souls will be bound up in the bond of life before the 
Lord your God. Amen.

THE HEALING OF NAAMAN. 

O LoKD our God&#44; almighty and merciful Father &#33; 
how long wilt thou delay having mercy on Jerusalem&#44; 
and the outcasts of thy people &#63; Behold &#33; our city is 
desolate&#44; and but a ruin remains of thy sanctuary&#59; 
and thy children are scattered over the face of the 
earth&#44; without a government&#44; without a shepherd&#44; and 
many of them are lost among the gentiles through 
the length of the &#8211;captivity&#44; and are drawn unto sin 
because they listen to the overtures of their adver&#8211; 
saries&#44; and worship the strange gods which others 
worship&#44; as though the hope of Israel were lost and 
extinguished in the whirlpool of eternity. &#34;Whereas 
Thou&#44; O living God&#33; art the sole Hope of our race&#44; 
the God whom alone we will adore &#59; the true Shep&#8211; 
herd&#44; who wilt lead us securely on rich pastures&#59; the 
Saviour of Jacob&#44; who wilt in mercy send the Re&#8211; 
deemer to us to reinstate us in our inheritance&#44; to 
restore thy law to its ancient power over the heart 
and aliairs of man&#44; to banish all false belief&#44; all vanity 
from the earth&#44; when all who have spirit will truly 
see thy glory&#44; and call alone on Thee&#44; and worsliip 
none beside Thee&#44; on that brilliant day when justice 
and rio&#59;hteousness will rule the earth&#44; and nation will 
not lift up sword against nation&#44; and mankind no 
more learn war. And then will our temple again bo

ccptable to Thee as of old&#44; when Thou wilt abide in

Brethren &#33; 

In the Ilaphtorah of to&#8211;day&#44; taken from the fourth 
and fifth chapters of the second book of Kings&#44; is told 
the history of the leper Kaaman&#44; the chief officer of 
the ruler of Syria&#44; who&#44; on being informed that the 
Israelitish prophet had power not granted to any other 
man&#44; was prevailed upon to visit Samaria&#44; with the 
permission of his master&#44; to obtain from the man of 
God that relief from his incurable disease&#44; which he 
had hoped for in vain from the remedies of the phy&#8211; 
sicians of his own country and belief. Behold him 
full of doubts and misgivings on his adventurous jour&#8211; 
ney&#59; a Jewish captive maiden had indeed assured his 
wife that he should of a certainty be cured by the 
prophet of Samaria&#59; but it might be the boasting of 
a captive&#44; who reverted back with regret to her native 
land&#44; where she had sported in innocent mirth among 
maidens as gleesome as herself&#44; and whose romantic 
soul covered everything in her lost home with the 
mantle of marvellousness&#44; and the interest of a pecu&#8211; 
liar holiness not appertaining to other lands. It was 
merely the desperation of hopelessness&#44; perhaps&#44; 
which induced the valiant soldier to listen to so won&#8211; 
derful a tale&#59; his own priests&#44; the worshippers of his 
own gods&#44; had no such power&#44; they claimed not to 
restore a man from leprosy&#58; and why should such a 
power be inherent in the men of that people over 
which he had so often triumphed &#63; And still he had 
heard of the mighty God of Israel&#44; of the many great 

<pb n="309"/>

THE HEALING OF NAAMAN. 309 

deeds wbicli He had wrought in Egypt and Palestine 
for his people &#59; and how He was supposed by them 
to be superior to all gods&#44; and all&#8211;sufficient to do of 
liiraself whatever might be pleasing to his will. But 
again he may have thought&#44; If this God be so great&#44; 
why does He not extend his kingdom over all the 
earth&#44; which the Israelites allege is the work of his 
creation &#63; Avhy does He allow other gods to be wor&#8211; 
shipped wwu He is God alone &#63; Again he may have 
supposed that&#44; granted even that God had power&#44; 
would He heal one like himself who worshipped Him 
not&#63; who paid his adoration to what must be false&#44; 
in case the idea of the Hebrews with rejirard to the 
Deity were true&#63; And observe farther in our narra&#8211; 
tive&#44; the general had gone and told the king of Syria 
of the marvellous story of the maiden&#59; and as po&#8211; 
tentates of tlie earth always think their power para&#8211; 
mount to all else&#44; he at once conceived the idea that&#44; 
if Naaman could be cured in Samaria&#44; it must be 
through means of the king of Israel&#44; who if even liot 
able to devise the required remedy himself&#44; would 
to a certainty have the influence with the liumble 
prophet&#44; who had no armed legions to do his will&#44; 
nor courtiers to flatter his vanity to do all he desired. 
But for once the worshipper of the calves of Jero&#8211; 
boam felt that he had no ability to do the bidding of 
the Syrian monarch. &#34; Am I a god&#44;&#34; said he&#44; &#34;to 
slay and to make alive&#44; that he hath sent unto me to 
cure a man of his leprosy&#63;&#34; and straightways he im&#8211; &#8211; 
agined that it Avas a device of the Syrian to seek a 
mere pretext for renewing the ancient hostilities be&#8211; 
tween Aram and Israel. Yes&#44; the idolatrous king of 
Samaria rent his garments&#44; so agitated was he at the 

<pb n="310"/>

unexpected message&#44; so horrified was he at the pres&#8211; 
ence of the leper who asked to he restored to health. 
But what earthly kings cannot achieve&#44; what neither 
wealth nor station can accomplisli&#44; is nevertheless 
within divine possihility. Nor had the Jewish maiden&#44; 
who first had spoken of the miraculous gifts of EUsha&#44; 
in common with others acquainted with the ways of 
God with man&#44; for a moment thought the power in&#8211; 
herent in&#44; or attainable by the ruler&#44; but in the man 
on whom had fallen a twofold share of the spirit of 
him who ascended to the abodes of the blessed with&#8211; 
out passing through the gates of death&#59; and as said&#44; 
it was only the natural error of the idolater of Damas&#8211; 
cus&#44; who&#44; because he was all&#8211;potent with his priests 
and soothsayers&#44; imagined the same to be the case 
with all other religions&#44; so that over its followers 
everywhere the chief of the state bad ample control 
to mould them to his will&#44; to coerce them to do his 
bidding. l&#41;Ut it need not be told you how utterly 
inapplicable all this is to our faith&#44; which has its 
source from God&#44; and knows of no authority on earth 
to which it must render homage&#44; which views all alike 
who have received life and intellect from the Creator&#59; 
since even the priests and prophets are not established 
for their own especial benefit&#44; but that they might 
render to the people the services which their God con&#8211; 
ceives will be for the great benefit of all&#59; so that all&#44; 
whether people or their religions&#44; nay their civil lead&#8211; 
ers&#44; are included in the one great idea of all being 
banded together to worship&#42; the Most High&#44; and pro&#8211; 
mote each other&#39;s greatest happiness. When Elisha 
therefore had heard that King Joram had rent his 
garments&#44; he demanded that the Syrian should be 

<pb n="311"/>

THE HEALING OF NAAMAN. 311 

sent to him&#44; that he might experience that there was 
a prophet in Israel&#44; not like the soothsayers of the 
heathens&#44; who deceived the people by flilse and pre&#8211; 
tended revelations&#44; but a true messenger&#44; who had 
received from the Lord the mission to prove the great 
power of our God&#44; how that He is supreme and alone 
exalted above all. 

Now the Syrian&#44; though sufiering from a loathsome 
disease&#44; had not thereby diminished in the least of 
the pride of his position as leader of the rgyal army&#44; 
and he went with his chariots and horses and stood 
at the door of Elisha&#39;s house&#44; expecting that the 
prophet would come out to him&#44; lay his hand on the 
diseased part&#44; call on the name of the Lord&#44; and thus 
not alone restore him to health&#44; but exhibit to him at 
once the connexion between the power of God&#44; and 
the prayer and influence of Elisha. This procedure 
would have shown ISTaaman to be a man whose well&#8211; 
being was of importance to the divine economy&#44; and 
the evident miraculousness of the cure&#44; the solemnity 
of the prophet&#39;s prayer&#44; in the presence of the chiefs 
and nobles of Damascus and Samaria&#44; would have 
been well&#8211;pleasing to the haughty military commander 
who came to expect relief&#44; not to look for it in humil&#8211; 
ity. It was therefore with deep chagrin that he re&#8211; 
ceived a message merely from Elisha&#44; who himself 
did not deign even to look upon his military visitor&#44; 
the noise of whose followers&#44; and the tramplings of 
whose steeds resounded in the street in front of his 
dwelling. And what was the message &#63; was any great 
demand made&#63; any deep medical skill displayed&#63; 
any immediate miracle to be performed&#63; any public 
prayer to be oftered up &#63; Nothing of all this was done&#59; 

<pb n="312"/>

312 THE HEALING OF NAAMAN. 

uut ivduman was ordered to go farther to the east&#44; 
till he reached the banks of the sacred Jordan&#44; and 
in its waters he was to bathe seven times&#44; neithei&#8211; 
more or less&#44; when his flesh should again assume a 
healthy complexion&#44; and he should be cleansed from 
the contagion. You can easily picture to yourselves 
the wrath of the proud soldier&#44; at finding his dignity 
so thoroughly slighted by the holy man of Samaria. 
So there was to be no prayer even offered up in his 
behalf&#59; and who could tell why he bid him to go on 
that errand&#63; was it perhaps to gain time&#63; was it a 
mere device because he had no power to act in the 
case &#63; and why not order him to the beautiful rivers 
of Damascus&#44; to the lovely Amanah&#44; and the clear 
Pharpar&#63; were they not far superior to the unpi&#8211;e&#8211; 
tending rivers of Palestine &#63; what virtue could there 
be in Jordan which his own streams did not possess&#63; 
But he forgot all the time&#44; that neither he nor any 
other man had a right to demand that an unusual 
cure should be wrought in his behalf&#59; that nothing 
he had done could entitle him to be exhibited before 
the world as one for whose restoration signs and won&#8211; 
ders should be performed&#44; and that at length&#44; if he 
would do something to deserve the divine mercy&#44; 
the first they would have to be his submitting him&#8211; 
self entirely and unconditionally to the demands of 
God&#44; as exhibited to him by his prophet. It was not 
then that Elisha had not power to cure by prayer&#59; 
but it was withheld in order to afford ISTaaman some 
slight opportunity to render liimself worthy of the 
blessing which he solicited &#59; he had not yet learned 
the Avorship of the Lord&#44; and he became thus famil&#8211; 
iarized with the sublime truth&#44; that it is obedience 

<pb n="313"/>

THE HEALING OF NAAMAN. 313 

WHICH IS DEMANDED&#44; IF WE WISH TO BE PLEASING TO 

God&#44; and that as its reward only can mercy be shown 
to us. Moreover&#44; though bathing seven times in the 
Jordan made the wonderfulness of the cure no less 
evident than any other inadequate means to produce 
a given cause&#44; still was it employing some natural 
method&#44; some aid from man himself&#44; through which 
means the divine blessing could be conferred&#59; and 
again ISTaaman was thus taught another important 
lesson&#44; that man must do something of his own&#44; that 
he must be active in some shape or other&#44; in order to 
obtain that assistance from above&#44; without which all 
labour is in vain&#44; and without which nothing can 
avail. After ISTaaman had therefore turned away in 
anger&#44; his servants persuaded him not to throw away 
lightly the promise of divine mercy which the&#39;prophet 
had opened to him. Yes a great thing&#44; the slaying 
of a thousand steers&#44; the giving away of treasures to 
any amount&#44; wading through blood of conquered 
armies&#44; would have appeared insignificant in his 
sight&#44; if he could only thereby regain his strength &#59; 
and therefore the sraallness of the trial displeased him 
even more than the prophet&#39;s own apparent indifier&#8211; 
ence to his suffering. They entreated him then to 
submit to this little condition &#59; and when thus sub&#8211; 
dued&#44; lo &#33; he went into the water which he had 
esteemed so lightly&#44; and barely had the seventh ablu&#8211; 
tion taken place&#44; than his flesh was again like the flesh 
of a little boy&#44; and he was clean&#44; and the marks of the 
contagion which had made him shunned&#44; despite of 
his greatness&#44; were at once removed&#44; in accordance 
with the conditionary promise of the man of God. 
Let it be observed that had any priests of falsehood

obtaiiiecl sucli a triumph over the disease which liad 
affected so important a personage in the state&#44; it would 
have&#44; been performed under imposing circumstances&#44; 
with all possible contrivances to lend importance and 
high sanction to the occasion. Presents too&#44; rich and 
costly&#44; would have been demanded&#44; not alone re&#8211; 
ceived &#59; and the individual actors would have glorified 
themselves at their unexpected success&#44; for however 
artfully contrived&#44; there could never be any certainty 
in any jugglery or trick thus attempted to be con&#8211; 
summated. The very absence&#44; however&#44; of Elisha in 
the present instance&#44; the simplicity of the remedy&#44; 
the confident tone of the promise&#44; the entire success 
of the obedience of Naaman&#44; convinced not only the 
object of the cure but the unbelieving Syrians&#44; as 
well as the sinning Israelites&#44; that the power of the 
Lord is indeed the irresistible influence which governs 
the world&#44; and that hence&#44; unless there be another 
deity of equal ability to work his will with himself. 
He must be the sole controller of the whole world. 
But as all the nations of that day worshipped a mul&#8211; 
titude of divinities&#44; all of which partook of the nature 
of finite beings&#44; and were even&#44; according to their 
priests&#44; under the influence of uncontrollable chance&#44; 
and since from this consideration they could not pre&#8211; 
dict&#44; nor cause others to predict with certainty what 
was to occur&#59; and whereas Elisha had clearly pointed 
out an unusual means to eftect a given purpose&#44; and 
predicted to a certainty all the occurrences as they 
took place&#44; and this all based upon the will of God&#58; 
ISTaaman came justly to &#8211;the conclusion that&#44; as the 
God of Elisha had thus proved his ability to eftect 
his purpose&#44; and had so clearly defined how it was to 

<pb n="315"/>

THE HEALING OF NAAMAN. 315 

be accomplisbed&#44; it proved that He must be uncon&#8211; 
trolled by any other power&#44; and is in fact the sole 
God in all the earth. And so say the Scriptures&#44; 2 
Kings V. 15 &#58; 

&#34; And he returned unto the man of God&#44; he with all his camp&#44; 
and he came and stood before him&#44; and said&#44; Behold&#44; now I know 
indeed that there is no God on all the earth but in Israel.&#34; 

What first he had heard in anger and derision had 
now proved to him that with God all is possible&#44; and 
that although he had done nothing to deserve the 
mercy shown unto him&#44; it was now made evident uuto 
him&#44; that when God desires to bless&#44; no one can stay 
Him&#44; and no circumstance&#44; however slight&#44; Avill be 
ineffectual to effect his almighty purposes&#44; the moment 
it is his intention to bless or to punish&#59; and he left 
Samaria with different feelings from those with which 
he had entered it&#44; and he resolved henceforward to 
be a follower of the true God&#44; and when making 
sacrifices&#44; to do so only unto Him&#44; whose are the 
majesty&#44; and the glory&#44; and the dominion of all the 
world. 

Perhaps it may be asked why so much undeserved 
kindness was shown to Naaman&#44; especially as nothing 
farther is said of him in the subsequent passages of 
the Bible&#63; But without going very deeply into the 
subject&#44; it would be enough to answer in general 
terms&#44; that we must apply here also&#44; as on other occa&#8211; 
t&#94;ions&#44; the words which the Lord himself taught unto

Moses when asking for a knowledge of the ways of 
God &#58; &#34; And I will be gracious unto him to whom I 
will be gracious&#44; and J will have mercy on him to 
whom I will show mercy.&#34; It is&#44; in other words&#44; the 
province of our Father alone to determine who is to 
be blessed&#44; and also to cause it to have a permanent 
influence on the affairs of the world at large. We 
may not&#44; indeed&#44; have any knowl&#8211;edge or conception 
even how any one occurrence&#44; for instance this one 
of ISTaaman&#44; may or can affect mankind in general&#59; 
but for all that there may have been a great necessity 
in the fearful demoralization of that age&#44; as it was in 
the preceding one&#44; through Elijah&#39;s miracles&#44; to teach 
the Israelites&#44; &#8212; as the depositaries of the law&#44; &#8212; the 
great truths which Moses had first handed down to 
the assembled people. Fearful inroads had the va&#8211; 
rious systems of idolatry made upon the simple re&#8211; 
ligion of the Bible&#59; the Israelites had adopted the 
vagaries of the heathen mythologies&#44; and the observ&#8211; 
ance of the commandments fell daily inore in abey&#8211; 
ance. It mattered not then so much who the instru&#8211; 
ments that were made the cause of arresting the total 
extinction of religion were&#44; as that such wore raised 
up for the wisest of purposes&#44; by the most benevolent 
of all beings&#59; and that they were so various&#44; from the 
poor man who had to borrow an axe to chop down a 
tree&#44; to the general of Benhadad&#39;s army &#8212; from the 
simple female of Shunem&#44; to the valiant king of Israel&#44; 
only confirmed the more thoroughly the many who 
yet adhered to the truth&#44; that they would not be 
forsaken themselves&#44; and that the God whom they 
adored and the religion which they followed would 
forever remain the inheritance of their people&#44; and 

<pb n="317"/>

that notliing done by them within&#44; and nothing done 
by others from without&#44; would ever obliterate the be&#8211; 
lief in the sole Creator from the hearts of their latest 
descendants&#44; or let the law perish from out of their 
mouth. Whatever God has created is for his glory&#59; 
and hence those whom He deems so are the most fit&#8211; 
ting to carry oUt his benevolent views. If&#44; then&#44; to 
our apprehension even they are not the most suitable&#44; 
we ought to be very cautious how we allow ourselves 
to sin by impugning the wisdom of which we cannot 
understand the very beginning &#59; and that the actors 
in these great events appear but once on the scene&#44; is 
not to assert that they were useless. The example 
needed was one of a peculiar kind&#44; we may assume&#59; 
and it having been given&#44; its repetition was not neces&#8211; 
sary&#44; and the actors also required not to be dwelt 
upon in the future development of the history of the 
world. The Bible&#44; let it be remembered&#44; was not 
written for our amusement&#44; or to satisfy our curiosity&#44; 
but to instruct us in the way of life&#59; and the healing 
of Naaman is accordingly complete in itself&#44; and 
teaches the lessons which we have already touched 
upon&#44; and which we will now recapitulate in a con&#8211; 
nected form. First&#44; whatever afflicts us is a divine 
dispensation &#58; Naaman&#39;s disease was evidently witliiu 
the divine cognizance&#44; and consequently we must not 
imagine that we are neglected or forsaken of God&#44; if 
the pleasantcurrentof our days is interrupted&#44; andsick&#8211; 
ness and its pains invade our domicil. Secondly&#44; that 
all our cures are in the hands of Him who afflicts us&#59; 
consequently we should always hope that we shall be 
relieved from all our sorrows&#44; so soon as divine mercy 
deems the end of our trials has arrived. Thirdly&#94; 

27&#42; 

<pb n="318"/>

318 THE HEALING OF NAAMAN. 

that we are permitted to use bniiian remedies and 
natural means to restore ourselves to liealtli &#59; but we 
must never forget&#44; when so applying them&#44; that they 
can only be efficacious when blessed by God&#44; but that 
otherwise the skill of the physician is exhausted in 
vain&#44; and no balm can heal the wound against which 
the decree has gone forth that it should hasten the 
sufferer&#39;s end. Fourthly&#44; that in order to obtain the 
blessing of God&#44; we must relinquish all our precon&#8211; 
ceived opinions of what we may deem right and proper&#44; 
but should assiduously endeavour to submit without 
question and reluctance to what religion teaches us&#44; 
in order that God may bless us and accomplish the 
desires of our heart. It was said to Naaman&#44; &#34;Bathe 
thyself and become cleansed&#59;&#34; and the healing which 
he obtained was the immediate consequence of his 
fuliilling what he had in this respect been told was 
the will of God. And&#44; fifthly&#44; that the power of God 
is unlimited by Avhat we call impossibilities and con&#8211; 
tradictions&#59; with Ilim the will and the power are in&#8211; 
separably connected&#44; and no matter what the con&#8211; 
ditions of the case may be&#44; the ability of the Lord to 
effect his will is not in the slightest degree abridged. 
Men speak of impossibilities&#44; because they soon feel 
the extent of their power&#59; they speak of their not 
knowing&#44; because they speedily discover the limit 
which their wisdom can attain&#59; they soon complain 
of weariness and sleepiness&#44; because their endurance 
has been tasked to the utmost extent of their ability&#59; 
but with God there is no conceivable want of power&#44; 
not the remotest idea of a want of mental comprelien&#8211; 
sion&#44; no possibility of weariness and sleep&#59; but lie ii&#58;&#33; 
always in the full enjoyment of strength&#44; his is a con&#8211;

stHiit source of inexhaustible wisdom&#44; and He lias an 
unflagging endurance&#44; and a wakefulness which needs 
not rest to enable it to stand firm in a new task&#44; to 
bear with all the hardships which continued toil 
would require. In short&#44; man is all&#8211;dependent&#44; God 
is self&#8211;sufficient&#59; man is powerless&#44; God is omnipo&#8211; 
tent&#59; man derives his being and whatever comprises 
it&#44; God is self&#8211;existence&#44; perfect and happy in himself&#44; 
and requires nothing beyond Him to add to his per&#8211; 
fection and happiness. 

This is the idea which the Decalogue meant to 
convey of the Supreme&#44; inasmuch as it announced 
Him as the creative power who punishes and re&#8211; 
wards&#44; not according to caprice&#44; but according to tlie 
merits of the creatures themselves. To enforce this&#44; 
to render it permanent&#44; were the subsequent events 
recorded in the Bible contrived&#44; &#8212; to rivet faster and 
faster in the minds of the people their entire depen&#8211; 
dence on the solo and only Creator. To effect this&#44; 
great and small deeds were wrought&#59; the agents 
were either pious or sinners&#44; high or humble&#44; Israel&#8211; 
ites or gentiles &#59; and with all it had for the only ob&#8211; 
ject contemplated to let the world understaiid&#44; that 
the whole economy of creation is the effect of one 
Being&#44; who is good and beneficent&#44; asking only to be 
obeyed&#44; in order that the greatest good may be con&#8211; 
ferred on the greatest numbers&#59; not that lie is in&#8211; 
jured by what is done in tlie world&#44; but that his 
creatures might be rendered as happy as their nature 
will admit of. It is true that nature is also his&#44; and 
He can alter it to suit his purposes. But we in our 
limited knowledge know not what is the best for us 
and others&#59; we cannot tell how the whole economy

is progressing to a jitoiut of absolute perfection &#59; we 
cannot see how the grass grows or the grain ripens &#59; 
but when we compare the barren field and the burnt&#8211; 
up meadow with the state of luxuriance they present 
in the bright sunlight of summer&#44; we are conscious 
of the creative progress which has taken place un&#8211; 
seen to us&#44; though our annual experience tells us to 
expect such a result as certain to occur&#44; to a great ex&#8211; 
tent at least&#44; if not to the self&#8211;same degree&#44; in every 
change of seasons. So it is with the development of 
the world. A religion was given to us&#59; it has been 
attested as excellent by the sanctifying influence it 
has had and still has on those of Israel who submit 
to its behests&#59; sparks flying&#44; as it were&#44; from the 
rock on which it was built&#44; shivered&#44; as it has been&#44; 
by the calamities of a long and still enduring cap&#8211; 
tivity&#44; have kindled a mighty flame all over the face 
of the globe&#59; the elements are in commotion&#44; there 
is a chaos in the intellectual world&#44; there are com&#8211; 
mingled truth and error&#44; light and darkness&#59; but the 
spirit of God is moving with the swiftness of eagles&#39; 
wings over the face of the waters&#44; and as the pinions 
touch the darksome element every now and then a 
spirit is awakened&#44; and it says&#44; &#34; There is no God in 
all the earth but in Israel.&#34; Ay&#44; it sinks again into 
the abyss&#44; and its testimony is hushed amidst the 
roaring of adverse elements&#59; but still the voice has 
gone abroad&#44; atid others will take up the refrain&#44; and 
new witnesses will be calleil forward&#44; and new spirits 
will be awakened&#44; till the whole mass of beings will 
be ripe for the kingdom of God&#44; as the harvest is 
ready for the sickle of the harvester&#59; and then will 
suddenly go forth&#44; as in the beginning&#44; the words &#34; Let

there be light&#44;&#34; and there will bo light&#44; and darkness 
will away from the face of the new creation&#44; and 
error&#44; and snperstition&#44; and talsehood will be forever 
banished from the earth&#44; and the new world will 
stand resplendent in the new light of God&#39;s truth&#44; 
when the Lord himself will be the universal Sun and 
Shield&#44; as when the lower world emerged from the 
mass of confused existence on the iirst day of creation. 
Let it not be imagined that the world was entirely 
lifeless before light was called forth from the dark&#8211; 
ness&#59; there was the Creator&#39;s will breathing on the 
elements&#44; preparing them for the new functions to 
which they were destined. So&#44; too&#44; in the moral 
world. The giving of the Decalogue was but the 
beginning of the end&#59; the elements were set in mo&#8211; 
tion by it&#59; it is the spirit of God which floats over 
the human mind&#59; it prepare&#94; all for the final triumph 
of truth&#44; and it will prevail&#44; no matter how much the 
wicked may despise the prophetic people&#44; no matter 
how many may claim to be possessed of the truth&#44; a 
better truth than is in Israel. The leprosy which af&#8211; 
fects the masses must be removed&#59; Israel&#44; as well as 
the v.orld&#44; will have to be washed of their unclean&#8211; 
ness &#59; but it is faith in God which will effect this. 
Unwilling or willing&#44; men will seek to throw off their 
load&#44; the burden of which afiiicts them&#44; in this purify&#8211; 
ing stream&#59; and when they find themselves restored 
to primitive innocency&#44; their flesh&#44; as it were&#44; ren&#8211; 
dered like that of a healthful child&#44; tliey all will go 
before those who knew the Lord and worsliipped 
Him during the days of tribulation&#44; and say&#44;&#34; Surely

Brethren &#33; 

We read iu Leviticus xviii. 5&#44; the following words&#44; 
which are given as the reason for demanding of us 
the observance of religious duties &#58; 

&#34; And ye shall observe my statutes and my ordinances which a 
man is to do that he may live through them &#59; I am the lord.&#34; 

Pvashi says to this text in his commentaries&#44; &#34;And 
live through them in the world to come&#59; for if thou 
wouldst saj&#44; It means this world&#44; the question would 
arise&#44; Is lie not at length compelled to die &#63;&#34; Let us 
look carefully into the requirements of religion and 
its consequences. Man in his un religious state&#44; with 
passions awakened and with physical developmeiits 
sufficiently strong to gratify them&#44; will have&#44; can 
have&#44; no impediment thrown in his way&#44; from rush&#8211; 
ing upon any animal enjoyment which may be in his 
power of tasting&#59; he is free to act&#44; and there is no 
internal check to withhold him&#59; he is the Urst and 
only thought to be regarded in his soul&#44; and he feels 
nothing&#44; and therefore cares nothing&#44; for the injury 
he may inflict on others. Divine responsibility has 
no echo in his heart &#59; he knows not God&#44; and there&#8211; 
fore does not fear Him&#44; and all mankind are but to 
him so many beings present to administer to his 
pleasure or aggrandizement&#44; and he will accordingly 
endeavour to mould them so as to fit them to become 
instruments in the gratilication of his ambition or 
pui&#8211;suit after pleasure. Hence arise murders&#44; incests&#44;

thefts&#44; and all the evils which man inflicts on man in 
the prosecution of Ijis selfish gratifications. For man 
without a God is the enemy to all creatures&#58; he is 
without responsihility&#44; and therefore the most noxious 
animal in existence&#44; far more destructive than the un&#8211; 
chained lion&#44; exceeding in ferocity the savage tiger&#44; 
and more insatiable in his thirst for blood than a 
hungry wolf amidst the defenceless sheep of the 
pasture. 

&#34;When therefore the Almighty beheld the weakness 
of untaught human nature&#44; He vouchsafed to reveal 
himself from the beginning to the men whom He 
deemed most fitting to be his messengers&#44; and en&#8211; 
dowed them with wisdom and knowledge&#44; that they 
might go abroad and teach truth&#44; and mercy&#44; and 
justice&#44; to their fellows&#44; in order that&#44; thus instructed&#44; 
society might be bound together by the ties of love 
an&#94; kindness&#44; and all live abstaining from injuring 
others&#44; and not receiving any injury in return. In 
short&#44; religion&#44; which is another term for divine rev&#8211; 
elation&#44; was to cure man of his savage impulsiveness&#44; 
and teach him that there are higher enjoyments than 
the mere gratification of base passions&#59; that it is a 
greater pleasure to preserve than to destroy life&#59; that 
it is a higher satisfaction to have shielded female in&#8211; 
nocence than to have sacrificed it to the base impulse 
of unbridled lust&#59; that it confers more lasting delight 
to the soul not to have taken our neighbour&#39;s prop&#8211; 
erty&#44; even in our moment of need&#44; than to have en&#8211; 
riched ourselves by appropriating by a violent hand&#44; 
by fraud&#44; or by stealth&#44; that for which we had not 
laboured&#44; and which had not come into our hands by 
voluntary gift or inheritance. It is for the correcting

therefore of the twofold teiidoney of liumauity&#44; that 
religion was bestowed&#44;&#8212; which means that&#44; since we 
are endowed with an inclination to gratify our im&#8211; 
pulses and desires&#44; whilst we have at the same time 
a countercheck within us which cannot satisfy itself 
about the justness of every intended act which we at 
first resolve upon&#44; we have received an especial guide 
to instruct us&#44; when it is safe to proceed to satisfy 
what our inclination for enjoyment demands for its 
use&#44; and when we are bound to listen to the admon&#8211; 
ishing voice which whispers into our ear &#34;Beware.&#34; 
It were folly to assert that all enjoyment is sinful&#44; 
that the flesh is always evil&#44; tliat nothing but mortifi&#8211; 
cation of the outward man is proper for one who loves 
his God &#59; for this would at once arraign the goodness 
of our Creator for endowing us with propensities 
which could only be satisfied at the expense of what 
is really and universally just and right. But whatever 
the Almighty has instituted is right&#59; there is nothing 
in the world&#44; not a propensity in our soul which can 
be viewed otherwise than beneficent in tendency if 
only properly applied. It is in all things the measure&#44; 
and not the quality which constitutes right or wrong&#44; 
and this measure is religion&#44; or the revealed expres&#8211; 
sion of God&#39;s will. We use then the terms &#34; good 
inclination&#44;&#34; jidh n&#125;f&#39;&#44; and &#34; evil propensity&#44;&#34; &#59;&#39;nn ni.&#34;&#44; 
merely in a relative sense&#44; good and evil so far&#44; as 
they are limited by the law of God&#44; and evil&#44; entirely 
so&#44; if they lead us beyond the prescribed bounds 
which Supreme Wisdom has set to them. AVhen 
therefore a certain commentator expounds &#34;and thou 
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart&#34; to 
mean with both the evil and good propensities&#44; inas&#8211;

the allwise Creator&#44; and he fully eonipiehends bow 
there was nothing truly evil in the simple creation 
which God cahed into being&#44; till the freedom of will 
given to man introduced sin into the world&#44; and 
brought in its train the sorrows and suiFerings inci&#8211; 
dent on the altered state&#44; from primitive innocence to 
a struggle with the vicissitudes thus evoked&#44; and re&#8211; 
sulting from the misconduct of man. But again&#44; 
who is there bold enough to assert that even this is 
altogether unmitigated evil &#63; Who warrants us to

forth at tlie iirst pain or disappointment&#44; as in others 
of his age. And still because he was taught what is 
right&#44; because he was guided well&#44; because the way 
was opened to him by providential circumstances&#44; 
and because he himself subdued the savage heart 
within him&#44; he has ascended on tlie path which leads 
upwards&#44; unconscious to himself&#44; heedless perhaps of 
the consequences of his own acts and words&#44; till you 
find him as he is&#44; a blessing to himself&#44; a happiness 
to others. And yet whilst he lives&#44; he knows not 
what his end may be&#44; whether he will persevere to the 
last&#44; and descend to the tomb with the righteousness 
which he has acquired&#59; but when at length the grave 
has closed over him&#44; then&#44; and only then&#44; can you 
speak from experience&#44; that that man has been faith&#8211; 
ful&#44; and earned&#44; so far as mortals can tell&#44; the appro&#8211; 
bation of his God. And yet all the trials&#44; all the dif&#8211; 
ficulties&#44; all the evil passions which others encounter&#44; 
fell to his lot also&#59; no one escapes them&#59; they&#44; like 
death&#44; are the common lot of humanity. And has 
the righteous overcome them with triumph &#59; has he 
been exalted above them even in the eyes of man &#59; 
have they left his virtue untouched&#44; and placed him 
in a brighter and holier light before other mortals 
like himself&#59; nay&#44; have they called forth in him high 
and noble traits&#44; which otherwise ii light liave lain 
dormant&#58; who can say that his lot has not been ulti&#8211;

the valley. But with life and the intellect therewith 
comhined&#44; without restraint or check&#44; what would 
man have been&#44; but the most destructive of all ani&#8211; 
mals &#33; and if one doubts this&#44; let him examine the 
records of history&#44; and he will read of atrocities which 
make the blood run cold&#44; and crimes which make the 
flesh creep&#44; all perpetrated under the unbridled influ&#8211; 
ence of lawless passions. It is possible&#44; that since 
man was created in the image of God&#44; &#8212; since he has 
an appreciation of virtue inly implanted in his heart&#44; 
he might&#44; after long and laborious struggles&#44; at length 
have arrived at defining some rules by which a gov&#8211; 
ernment might have been carried on&#44; securing to 
each man the possession of life and its acquisitions &#59; 
but even with this concession in favour of the human 
mind&#44; unaided by God&#44; what efi&#33;ect could this have 
had on eternity &#63; where would have been the cer&#8211; 
tainty that acts of the nature described had secured 
us the approbation of God &#63; But it may be safely de&#8211; 
nied that human reason alone was ever able to frame 
equitable laws for a general government&#44; or that there 
ever was a time when some direct communication of 
the will of God was unknown to mankind &#59; for the 
sustaining of the first position&#44; we may cite the bar&#8211; 
barities of heathen nations&#44; and for the second the 
biblical evidence that&#44; with the cessation of the flood&#44; 
the Lord revealed to Xoah the principles of justice&#44; 
evidenced in the inviolability of human life so strongly 
enjoined. But these few laws were&#44; as can easily be 
seen&#44; not enough to govern the world when popula&#8211; 
tion became denser&#44; and the interests thereby exist&#8211; 
ing more complicated and diversified. &#34;We&#44; therefore&#44; 
may assume that&#44; although not written down&#44; other

precepts were ordained &#59; since we find Abraham com&#8211; 
mended for observing God&#39;s charges&#44; commandments&#44; 
statutes&#44; and laws&#44; which doubtless included rules for 
justice&#44; charity&#44; and obedience to parental authority&#44; 
or the main pillars which support society. Prob&#8211; 
ably these laws were traditional&#44; handed down by oral 
precept&#44; as we read of Abraham&#44; &#34;And he built there 
an altar and proclaimed in the name of the Lord&#44;&#34; 
evidently the duties i&#41;ertaining to a profession of faith&#44; 
and it was this especial mark which distinguished 
Abraham and his household at first&#44; and afterwards 
his own descendants and their adherents&#44; from the 
rest of the community where they lived&#44; and called 
down on them the promise of divine protection. 

But this was not yet the end of Abraham&#39;s destiny &#59; 
he was to receive a still higher life&#44; a brighter exist&#8211; 
ence &#59; and this was accomplished at the revelation of 
the divine glory on Horeb&#44; when the laws of God were 
not left any farther to the yerishableness of mere 
tradition&#44; but were given over in the form of a code&#44; 
civil and religious&#44; to the charge of an entire people&#44; 
who were appointed to watch over its preservation&#44; 
because their ancestors had obeyed the will of God in 
whatever had been demanded of them&#44; and thus ob&#8211; 
tained the promise of an everlasting covenant from 
their ISIaker. Moses was&#44; therefore&#44; justly empow&#8211; 
ered to tell the people that they should not go after 
the ordinances of the land of Egypt where they had 
dwelt&#44; nor follow the practices of the land of Canaan 
whither they were going&#59; simply because neither 
were in accordance with the dictates of the Lord&#44; who 
had not approved of the inventions of fallible men in 
institutiuii&#8211;such absurdities and crimes&#44; and enforcing

them as religious duties. But he was told to say &#58; 
&#34; My laws ofjustice shall ye observe&#44; and my statutes 
shall you keep to walk in them&#59; I am the Lord your 
God &#58;&#34; meaning&#44; that the laws we had received were 
not emanating from a fallible mortal&#44; but from the 
supreme Source of wisdom and power&#44; whose words 
are true&#44; and in whose judgment there is no possible 
room for error or deception. But not alone this&#59; for 
it is not an arbitrary system which we are to follow&#59; 
not one which is solely intended to magnify Ilim&#44; and 
to render us the subjects of his kingdoini &#59; for&#44; con&#8211; 
tinues the message&#44; &#34; And ye shall observe my stat&#8211; 
utes and my ordinances&#44; which a man is to do that 
he may live in them.&#34; This means&#44; there are many 
practices. of the gentiles which are hurtful to life&#44; 
which are subversive of piety&#44; injurious to the wel&#8211; 
fare of the state&#59; but if you observe the ordinances 
of the Bible&#44; you will not only escape these dangers&#44; 
but you will obtain by them life and happiness. And 
says the commentator&#44; &#34;But how is life to be pre&#8211; 
served&#63; has not every man&#44; no matter how good he 
is&#44; however observant of all the laws&#44; ultimately to 
pay the forfeit of all mankind&#63; must he not yield his 
spirit and return to the earth from which his body 
has sprung &#63;&#34; He then answers &#58; &#34; The life promised 
is the future state&#44; where the existence is permanent&#44; 
where the interruptions which disturb our earthly 
lite are not any more to be dreaded&#59; but it&#34; one has 
once entered therein he will be forever in the pres&#8211; 
ence of God&#44; and bask in the great light which issues 
from the mercy of the Creator.&#34; The verse&#44; there&#8211; 
fore&#44; properly concludes&#44; not with the usual &#34;I am 
the Lord your God&#44;&#34; or the One who has done you

SO many benefits&#44; and therefore asks this service as a 
return of grateful feelings&#44; but simply &#34; I am the 
Lord&#44;&#34; or&#44; as the Hebrew term is the symbol of the 
permanence of the Deity&#44; &#34; I am the Everlasting &#59;&#34; 
thus saying that the reward promised for obedience 
will be commensurate with the divine existence&#44; and 
as this is everlasting&#44; so will also be the recompense 
which obedience will obtain at his hands &#58; not like 
the riches of the earth&#44; which are acquired in toil and 
sorrow&#44; and are often taken in the twinkling of an 
eye&#59; or human glory&#44; which is not rarely purchased 
with the tears of the orphan and the sobs of the 
widow&#44; and which at length barely endures for a 
night&#59; or human power&#44; which leaves a man in the 
midst of his exaltation a byword and a reproach to 
his enemies &#59; but those treasures which require no 
miser&#39;s care to hoard them&#44; which the worm cannot 
devour nor the moth destroy &#59; that glory which 
springs from devotion to God and the light issuing 
from his own essence&#44; over which others shed no 
tears&#44; and which excites no sorrow in the breast of 
aught that lives&#59; that exaltation which is the off&#8211; 
spring of acceptability with the Lord&#44; over which no 
enemies can prevail&#44; and of which not all the powers 
of the world can deprive the possessor. In short&#44; the 
state of the righteous who live through the faith and 
works prescribed to us&#44; will be analogous to the divine 
existence&#44; which is not marred by bodily suffering 
and by mental darkness&#44; and which is not interrupted 
by death&#44; which has not any power or dominion over 
those who dwell under the shadow of the Lord&#39;s pro&#8211; 
tection. 

If now they who follow the commandments of God

are beset in their travels through life with dangers and 
difRcnlties&#59; if they see themselves pursued by the 
malevolence of their enemies&#44; and scorned by hollow&#8211; 
hearted friends&#59; if they see their efforts followed by 
disappointment&#44; and their labour exerted in vain&#59; if 
ill health seems attached to them as an heirloom 
from their birth to their grave &#58; they must not repine 
at the hard lot which is thus assigned them&#59; they 
should feel that the more they endure here&#44; the more 
wull their virtues be purified&#44; the more will they be 
cleansed from iniquity&#44; the more will they be ren&#8211; 
dered fit to come unspotted&#44; freed from the pollution 
of earthly life&#44; into the presence of Him who is the 
Holiest and Purest &#59; who is&#44; moreover&#44; the righteous 
Judge&#44; who never sends any dispensation without a 
wise motive&#44; and who&#44; being unforgetting&#44; will not 
let a single deed&#44; a single suffering of theirs pass&#44; 
without assigning reward for the one and giving them 
a due recompense for the other&#44; if it was borne in 
meekness and resignation to his just decrees&#44; He 
being the perfect God&#44; with whom there is no un&#8211; 
righteousness or iniquity. 

And as individuals are thus promised life in the 
law&#44; we as a nation must likewise expect to have 
existence and permanence through the same means. 
I stated that both nations and individuals have their 
end&#44; the object for which they were created&#59; that for 
the individual&#44; we see&#44; is tliat he is to be rendered 
truly and permanently happy&#44; without sorrow or pain &#59; 
that for our nation must be analogous&#44; though not 
identical&#44; since nationalities&#44; with our means for arriv&#8211; 
ing at a correct judgment&#44; are but existences of the 
earth&#44; of life in this world&#44; inapplicable to the disem&#8211;

bodied state. As human beings living on the earth&#44; 
in the midst of mortals&#44; then&#44; must we look for our 
destiny&#44; and as such we must become identified with 
the living God. But how&#63; can we then see Him and 
live&#44; when Moses&#44; the prophet of prophets&#44; could not&#63; 
But the question answers itself&#44; when we look at the 
first institution of our race as a people. When Abram 
left ITaran by the command of God&#44; he was told that 
he should become a blessing to all the families of the 
earth. He was then but a wanderer&#44; a childless man 
of the age of seventy&#8211;five years&#44; alone&#44; unknown in 
the country assigned to him as the future residence 
of his descendants. Still he went forward on his 
mission in full confidence of the truth of the word of 
God&#44; though he could not understand how it was to 
be accomplished&#59; it spoke of descendants when he 
was childless&#59; it spoke of blessings&#44; and soon famine 
compelled him to leave his new home for the land of 
Egypt&#59; and when at length after the son of promise 
had been born&#44; and he hoped thus to see the fulfil&#8211; 
ment of his hopes&#44; he was ordered to bring him for a 
l&#41;urnt&#8211;ofi&#58;ering on one of the mountains which the 
Lord would show him. Nevertheless&#44; amidst all 
these doubts and trials&#44; he never wavered&#44; he believed 
in the Lord&#44; who reckoned it to him as righteousness. 
After him came Isaac&#44; and then Lsrael&#44; and after a 
period of more tlian two hundred years since the mis&#8211; 
sion of Abraham&#44; the whole number of worshippers 
of the One God was less than a hundred persons&#44; con&#8211; 
nected with the family of the patriarch. And still 
there was no defection&#44; no complaining at the slow 
fulfilment of the promise&#44; that in them all the earth 
should be blessed. It was enough that God had

promised&#44; and they lived forward to meet tlie accom&#8211; 
plishment&#44; come when it might&#44; thongh delayed age 
after age&#44; and century after century. Again peace 
fled from our race&#44; and we were kept in bondage and 
held to labour for so long a time&#44; that we were defiled 
with the idols of Eygpt&#59; but hope fled not from the 
breast of all&#44; and there were those who clung with 
unshaken faith to God&#44; till the time of the fulfilment&#44; 
when we as a nation were publicly betrothed and es&#8211; 
poused by the great Father of mankind&#44; to be his own&#44; 
his peculiar treasure&#44; his kingdom of priests&#44; his holy 
nation. But even then we stood alone&#44; solitary amidst 
the families of the earth&#44; in the invocation of the Holy 
Name&#44; which is reverenced among the angels. Yet 
it was the commencement of the great accomplish&#8211; 
ment of the covenant with Abraham&#59; seventy males 
had now increased to sixty myriads&#44; and in the mouth 
of two millions of human beings was the Lord of 
heaven invoked as their God and Creator. We next 
arrived in Palestine&#44; and increased in power and in&#8211; 
telligence&#44; and the fame of our commonwealth spread 
far over the East and the countries to the South &#59; but 
still we stood alone&#44; and we had no associates to join 
us in our testimony against the vanities and idols of 
mankind. And though our state fell at last a prey to 
our transgressions&#44; and our iniquities destroyed our 
sanctuary&#44; the religion&#44; which is ours&#44; did not perish&#44; 
and survives even now aS the glory of the sons of 
Jacob. O &#33; how did Ave sufter since the day that 
Nebuchadnezzar sent the captain of his guards to 
burn our temple &#33; O how weary were our wander&#8211; 
ings since a second time the holy of holies was entered 
with fire and sword&#44; under the cruellest of all oppres&#8211;

sors&#44; Titus&#44; the Roman general&#44; and his unpitying 
legions &#33; But for all this&#44; we adhered&#44; few of us at 
least&#44; to the statutes of the Lord&#44; and thus we live in 
and through the commandments which we received 
at Sinai. As yet we have not ceased&#44; as yet our des&#8211; 
tiuy is not accomplished&#44; because our end has not 
come &#59; nor are all the families of the earth blessed in 
Abraham and his descendants. But we are hasten&#8211; 
ing to the accomplishment&#59; event crowds on events&#59; 
falsehood sinks after falsehood &#59; and who can doubt 
that truth at length will triumph &#63; Who can gainsay 
that at length the Lord alone will reign on earth &#63; 
Yea&#44; Abraham&#44; Isaac&#44; Israel&#44; and Moses&#44; faltered not &#58; 
why then should we falter&#44; when the prospect is so 
much brighter&#44; the hope so much more likely&#44; accord&#8211; 
ing to human reasoning even&#44; to be accomplished&#63; 
So then let us hold fast to the Law&#44; adhere firmly to 
our God&#44; and invoke in humility his blessing on U3 
and all mankind&#44; and pray that He may speedily send 
the Messiah to restore peace on earth&#44; as it is in 
heaven. Amen.

EQUALITY OF MEN. 



O Lord God &#33; whose servants we are&#44; and who hast 
chosen ns to be thy own treasure&#44; be with us and our 
spirit&#44; and prosper us in our undertakings&#44; whether 
these be to provide food for our household&#44; or to ac&#8211; 
quire a knowledge of thy ways&#44; a knowledge more 
priceless than pearls&#44; and more refreshing to the soul 
than healing balsam is to wounded limbs. O &#33; how 
blessed are those whom Thou blcssest &#33; how well 
guarded are those whom Thou guardest &#33; and where 
then shall we look for blessing and protection but 
from Thee&#44; in whose hands are the power and the 
dominion over all &#63; Yea to whom shall Israel fly for 
aid&#44; if it be not to Thee their God&#44; their Guardian&#63; 
Let us then entreat Thee to have regard to our lowly 
state&#44; and save us from the grasp of the violent&#44; against 
whose uplifted arm we have no strength to defend 
ourselves&#44; whose wrath would overwhelm us&#44; if we 
were to rely on mere human aid to defend us. And 
let it be made evident that we are indeed thy servants 
whom Thou hast chosen&#44; thy own inheritance whom 
Thou hast deputed to make known thy ways and thy 
laws to mankind. Yes&#44; bless us as Thou liast blessed 
our fathers&#44; and let through us thy JSTame be glorified&#44; 
for our happiness and the welfare of all mankind. 
Amen.

338 equality of men. 

Brethren &#33; 

The principles of the Jewish religion are evident 
upon a simple inspection of its details&#44; they are in 
brief the piiriiication of the human lioart&#44; and to in&#8211; 
duce it to practise acts of kindness to all others&#44; who 
can be reached by any deed of ours. &#33;Man&#44; by means 
of the precepts of our faith&#44; is taken from his state of 
isolation and loneliness&#44; and placed in oue of al&#8211; 
liance and fraternal union with all others who like 
him are composed of the same elements&#44; body and 
soul&#44; and who are therefore not merely fellow&#8211;mortals&#44; 
like him&#44; subject to decay&#44; but also fellow&#8211;beings&#44; 
whose fate cannot be of right a matter of indifference 
to him. The reverence due to the Deity from whom 
everything has sprung is&#44; at the same time&#44; alike in&#8211; 
cumbent on all&#44; as all have the same origin&#44; and con&#8211; 
sequently the same relative position to their Author. 
In Judaism therefore no man is without a neighbour&#44; 
as little as he can be without a God &#59; and in the sajue 
measure as he is bound to serve the Lord and to ac&#8211; 
knowledge Ilim in spirit&#44; so is he bound to serve his 
fellow&#8211;men in whatever is within his power&#44; and to 
recognize in each of them an equal and a brother. 
The rich and the proud may perhaps be disposed to 
look upon themselves as peculiarly favoured by Prov&#8211; 
idence&#44; or&#44; as they generally call it&#44; by fortune and 
circumstances&#44; and therefore elevated above the ordi&#8211; 
nary level of mortals&#44; and that they therefore have an 
inherent right to claim the services and respect of 
others&#44; without repaying them to a greater extent than 
is agreeal&#41;le to their own views&#44; irrespective of the 
opinions which the others may entertain. They may 
in this wise fancy themselves not bound by the same

rules of conduct which biiul others&#59; since tlioir very 
position is&#44; in their opinion&#44; proof enough that n pe&#8211; 
culiar degree of leniency is to be extended to them&#44; 
which applies not to common men. Hence it is not 
rare to hear the crimes&#44; which would disgrace the la&#8211; 
bourer&#44; considered venial offences if committed by 
the higher orders&#44; falsely so called&#59; and drunkenness 
from wine at the tables of the rich is excused as a 
trifling foible&#44; whereas the labourer would be de&#8211; 
servedly condemned for inebriety produced by vulgar 
intoxicating drinks. But in truth&#44; reason and com&#8211; 
mon sense cannot tolerate such a distinction &#59; crime 
is crime&#44; whether it is dressed in royal purple or the 
shepherd&#39;s gray vestment&#59; and the filthiness of a rich 
voluptuary is equally disgusting with that of the 
meanest vagabond in the world. One common fate 
awaits all&#59; and whether you are reposing on gilt 
couches&#44; courting slumber on the softest down and 
under silken coverlets&#44; or tossing on a hard plank 
with scarcely a rag to cover you against the inclem&#8211; 
ency of winter&#44; death will cut short your career&#44; and 
you will be borne to the grave&#44; and you will moulder 
equally under a marble monument which recounts 
virtues which you never possessed&#44; and in a sepulchre 
witliout a single token to tell the world the name of 
the unknown wanderer who here expects his awak&#8211; 
ening. The earthly happiness of man consists but in 
the degree of exemption which he may enjoy from 
some cares which oppress others &#59; but free from them 
altogether&#44; and exempt from the decree of dissolution&#44; 
be is not&#59; and for all the greatest and most llivoured 
can know&#44; the veriest hind&#44; the meanest slave who

administers to their pleasures may have joys of which 
they can have no conception. 

The Mosaic Law therefore looks upon all mankind 
as equals&#44; and prescribes for them the same regula&#8211; 
tions. It is impossible&#44; it is true&#44; from the organiza&#8211; 
tion of society&#44; that all men shall liave the same pur&#8211; 
suit&#59; for if this were so&#44; there could be no advance&#8211; 
ment in society&#44; because every one would tlien have 
to toil in one uniform round to provide for himself 
Avhatever he may want for food and clothing &#59; and as 
each man&#39;s powers are exceedingly limited&#44; he could 
make only very small progress&#44; even in satisfying the 
simplest cravings of nature. Elegauce and mental 
progress would be totally out of the question &#59; since 
the longest period of human existence would not leave 
the time to enable a man to do more than merely 
prolong his existence&#44; and then there must be no in&#8211; 
terruption from disease and any of the other causes 
which retain men in a state of inaction&#44; such as in&#8211; 
fancy and age. If&#44; however&#44; as it is now&#44; men have 
various pursuits&#44; wdiich are indicated to them in a 
multitude of providential ways &#59; since invention is 
stimulated by the co&#8211;operation of many to effect a 
common end &#58; society acquires a solidity&#44; and each 
individual&#44; and this under the worst circumstances&#44; 
such an increase of means of happiness and enjoy&#8211; 
ment&#44; as the soiitaiy hermit&#44; who has never lived in 
society&#44; can have no conception of. The wants of man 
bind the human lamiiy in one mass&#44; like the staves 
of a barrel are conlincd and btuiiid together by the 
hoops which are lirndy driven around them. Each 
individual s&#94;iave is a useless article by itself&#59; but let a 
number be set up and lirndy and properly united.

and you have the most useful domestic articles&#44; Avhich 
administer in a countless variety to the comfort of 
man. &#8212; But wliilst it is for tlie happiness of all that 
pursuits shonld vary&#44; it is evidently no disgrace to any 
one to follow an humbler calling than his neighbour&#44; 
either from i&#41;reference or necessity. Every one can&#8211; 
not be a leader&#44; or there would be no one to be led&#44; 
and consequently no authority&#59; but it is equally pre&#8211; 
posterous for the authority to imagine that he is there 
and thus for his own sake&#44; and that&#44; because he is 
chief&#44; society is hound to him&#44; and not he to society. 
On the contrary&#44; whoever can and does contribute 
something to the general welfare has an undoubted 
claim&#44; by a luitural deduction of sound common sense&#44; 
to the general consideration and protection&#44; and there&#8211; 
fore a right to expect relief and kindness&#44; if his own 
powers fail&#44; and he be thrown through sickness&#44; age&#44; 
or other causes of helplessness&#44; upon the commisera&#8211; 
tion of the world at large. His loneliness&#44; his want 
of power&#44; his inability to repay kindness&#44; is then no 
bar to his claim for mercy&#59; he has laboured whilst 
he could&#44; he contributed his all that his physical 
ability allowed him&#44; that his mental acquirements 
permitted him to accomplish&#59; and he is a brother 
among brothers&#44; a man amongst his fellows&#44; and they 
cannot&#44; dare not&#44; let him perish&#44; but should of right 
administer to his wants&#44; and smooth for him his 
descent to the grave. What is it to you&#44; that your 
brother&#39;s name was never trumpeted abroad anu&#94;ng 
the famous ones of the earth&#63; it was not his calling 
to do mighty deeds&#44; to strike out great and astonish&#8211; 
ing thoughts&#59; but still he is a creature like yourselves&#44;

in accomplishing all his splendid designs and beauti&#8211; 
ful arrangements&#59; but builders and masons must as&#8211; 
sist him&#44; and even these will have their work grcatly 
abildged by having mere labourers&#44; who can neither 
design nor execute&#44; to bring from a distance the ma&#8211; 
terials wdiich are to be wrought up into shape and 
placed in order&#59; and when a palace or temple is 
finished&#44; though no one dreams of the poor carrier 
of wood&#44; stone&#44; and mortar&#44; though the giant mind 
who devised the pile alone is celebrated for the work 
to the exclusion of all others &#58; it is still evident that 
all who wrought thereon have some claim to be con&#8211; 
sidered its builders&#44; or at the least promoters of its 
construction. &#8212; Society is thus ramified&#44; so widely ex&#8211; 
tended in a vast variety of pursuits and employments &#59; 
and whoever is not idle&#44; and follows tip his task to 
the best of his intellect&#44; has fulfilled all that can be 
demanded of him. 

Still some wlio&#44; because they have wealth and 
power&#44; need not labour&#44; may think that those whose 
lot it is to provide for their wants are their inferiors&#44; 
of a clay not as pure and refined as that out of which 
their body is framed&#44; with a soul not as elevated as 
that which was breathed into their own nostrils. But 
if they would only reflect one instant&#44; they would be 
cured of their vain and unholy dream. If the la&#8211; 
bourers are so inferior as they imagine&#44; let them con&#8211; 
trive for once to do without their aid&#59; let them plough

the field themselves&#44; let them reap tlie harvest&#44; let 
them thresh out the corn&#44; let them grind it into Hour&#44; 
let them knead the dough and bake the bread &#58; and 
then if they discover that all this is too much for 
them to do&#44; they must at the same time ackiK&#94;wledge 
that they are fully as much indebted to the labourers&#44; 
to them unknown&#44; who supply them with their daily 
food&#44; as these can be for the amount of pay they ob&#8211; 
tain in their tarn. The rich have distinction and 
favour enough by being exempt from bodily labour&#58; 
still it is only that they may have the means to pur&#8211; 
chase it&#44; not that they can exist without its being per&#8211; 
formed&#44; which is the lot assigned them&#59; consequently 
the labourer is their equal in the scale of humanity 
for all their arrogance and assumption&#44; and they have 
no right to assign him a lower degree as man&#44; simply 
because they pay and he labours. Their money will&#44; it 
is true&#44; make him comfortable&#44; it will give him the 
means to purchase what he requires&#59; but then the 
labour he performs renders a service also to his em&#8211; 
ployers&#44; without which&#44; whether done by others or 
themselves&#44; they could not eat&#44; nor drink&#44; nor have 
garments&#44; nor a house to dwell in. 

These views are developed simply from a consid&#8211; 
eration of the mutual wants of society &#59; if now re&#8211; 
ligion is in consonance with them&#44; we must confess 
that reason and religion coincide&#44; and that hence the 
revealed will of God has a responding voice in the 
human mind&#44; and demands therefore an impHcit obe&#8211; 
dience&#44; even without taking into view that the execu&#8211; 
tion of the precepts will have an abiding effect&#44; after 
the spirit shall have gone to its eternal rest in the 
presence of its Creator. Whatever now may be said

by those who do not understand Judaism&#44; or those 
who look at it with the jaundiced eye of prejudice&#44; 
it is pre&#8211;eminently a religion of reason&#44; of social prog&#8211; 
ress&#44; and freedom&#44; and equality. It places men in 
society&#44; not in isolated&#44; however high&#44; positions&#59; it 
recognizes the right of acquiring wealth by labour 
N&#94; and ingenuity&#59; it permits inventions and discoveries&#59; 
it encourages learning and refinement&#59; but what is 
more than all&#44; it places every man on an absolute 
equality in the eyes of the law with his neighbour&#44; 
though he be poor&#44; and the other tlie wealthiest in 
the land. Crime in the poor is crime in the rich&#44; 
and infirmities of temper in the one are the same in 
the other. Besides this&#44; the poor never loses for the 
sake of his mere poverty his consideration in the 
state &#59; because the state of the Lord consists of in&#8211; 
dividual Israelites&#44; not of rich and powerful land&#8211; 
holders and merchants&#44; of generals and princes&#59; but 
whoever has his birth or adoption in the state is 
hedged round by the power of the law&#44; and his prop&#8211; 
erty and his personal liberty are held inviolable&#44; and 
if he loses both or either by misfortune&#44; he ceases 
not for all this to be an object of the tenderest care 
to the code under which the state is established. It 
is no idle declamation which asserts that the Mosaic 
religion has furnished us an example&#44; the first and 
highest&#44; how a state can be practically free under the 
operation of well&#8211;defined legal enactments on the one 
liand&#44; and obedience of all the citizens on the other. 
Take whatever other state you please&#44; and you never 
will discover any stronger guarantees for the attain&#8211; 
ment of the object just mentioned than in the books 
of Moses. You may&#44; as men&#44; differ about the policy

to pursue any calling which a man&#39;s circumstances 
or capacity may impel him to choose&#44; and at length 
universal love and henevolence. By thus constituling 
the kind impulses of our natures a portion of his leg&#8211; 
islation&#44; Moses&#44; in the name of God&#44; has sanctified&#44; 
by throwing over them the mantle of religion&#44; what 
we are apt to deem mere exercises of pleasant duties&#59; 
whilst it impresses those whose miserly&#44; or indifferent&#44; 
loveless disposition might induce them to look with 
callous apathy on their neighbours&#39; sorrows&#44; that they 
are bound to overcome this cruelty of heart&#44; and suc&#8211; 
cour the distressed&#44; as much as they would from a 
pride for their tair name&#44; and fear of incurring pun&#8211; 
ishment&#44; practise the usual rules of honesty and fair 
dealing towards those to whom they are indebted&#44; 
or who are indebted to them. Thougli therefore un&#8211; 
believers and heathens may be as benevolent as the 
Israelite&#44; he has a superadded motive&#44; that of doing 
an act pleasing to and commanded by his God&#59; by 
which means he will have a powerful incentive to for&#8211; 
give and to be kind even to those who have done him 
a personal injury&#44; seeing that his enemies too are his 
brothers&#44; children of the same God&#44; and therefoi&#8211;e 
entitled to liis indulgence and forgiveness&#59; and thus 
he can&#44; conquering his own ill&#8211;will&#44; render them kind&#8211; 
ness for the wrong they have done him&#44; and he will 
serve them in the hour of their need&#44; although he 
owes them no ccratitude.

In truth&#44; brethren&#44; you need not be ashamccl&#44; as 
citizens of a free republic&#44; for being followers of 
Moses &#59; you have not in your religion to mystify or 
to explain away any doctrines relating to society&#44; 
which&#44; carried into literal execution&#44; would be sub&#8211; 
versive of the state. Justice&#44; mercy and truth shguld 
be the basis of every commonwealth&#44; of every mon&#8211; 
archy even&#44; since kings too&#44; when thej&#8211; rule&#44; should 
govern in the principles which promote human hap&#8211; 
piness &#59; but no free state&#44; where the people are the 
source of power&#44; can prosper wherein these eter&#8211; 
nal safeguards of mankind are lost sight of. And as 
they are the foundation of the social law of Moses&#44; 
and as not one of his enactments is opposed to them&#44; 
and as&#44; on the contrary&#44; they all tend to promote 
them in the highest degree&#44; since they repress vio&#8211; 
lence&#44; encourage benevolence&#44; and counsel man to 
speak the truth as it is in his heart&#58; the law which is 
our inheritance is of right the one whi&#40;&#59;h may be 
called the first&#44; and hitherto the onlv religious code 
which combines safe rules of government with direc&#8211; 
tions for tlie personal holiness of the individuals. 
And if even&#44; as already said&#44; men have substituted 
difterent degrees of punishment for those first re&#8211; 
vealed through Moses&#44; arbitrarily substituting their 
fancies for wliat God had decreed as right&#58; they nev&#8211; 
ertheless have in the main proceeded to legislate on 
the great basis of the Ten Commandments&#44; on the 
foundation of which the other precepts of our re&#8211; 
ligion have been erected&#44; as a superstructure on an 
immovable basis&#44; one which is unalterably true&#44; and 
must remain so&#44; though the earth should wax old as

a garment&#44; and the light of the sun and the moon be 
extinguished from our horizon. 

The above reflections just presented to you are well 
connected with the Parashah of to&#8211;day&#44; in which are 
laid down the principles on which the land of Israel 
was to be cultivated&#44; in what manner each individual 
was to be restored to his freedom and his paternal 
possessions&#44; how land was to be sold&#44; ordinary bar&#8211; 
gains between man and man were to he made&#44; and 
how charity was to be conferred&#44; and lastly how ser&#8211; 
vants were to be treated when they were compelled 
from a pressure of poverty to forego for a time their 
personal freedom and seek service and protection in 
the houses of those whose means were more ample&#44; 
whether these were native Israelites&#44; or idolatrous 
strangers who had taken up their abode and acquired 
wealth in Palestine. It is perhaps curious to a casual 
observer that in every instance the word nx &#34; brother&#34; 
is used&#44; to denote the unfortunate who had from the 
force of circumstances to sell his estate&#44; and at another 
time to forego his personal freedom&#44; or to seek for aid 
from his fellow&#8211;mortal. But as the Bible never uses a 
word without a good cause and well&#8211;defined purpose&#44; 
we must assume that as much is taught by the phrase&#8211; 
ology of the precept&#44; as by the precept&#44; itself. What 
I liave said already will answer the question regard&#8211; 
ing the rights of Israelites in their state&#59; it is simply 
this &#58; whether we purchase another&#39;s land&#44; his own 
personal liberty&#44; or aid a man to the extent of his 
wants&#44; we have no right to assume towards him any 
arrogance or pride&#59; nincc no matter how prosperous 
we be&#44; and liow lowly he be sunk&#44; we are at best no 
mure than he is&#59; he is our fellow&#8211;man&#44; our brother&#44;

onr neigliboiir&#44; and the service which we render him&#44; 
in the instances mentioned&#44; is no more than he has an 
absolute right to expect from us&#59; because we have re&#8211; 
ceived our prosperity only that we might become 
thereby serviceable to those who stand in need of our 
aid. So&#44; then&#44; says the text&#58; 

&#34; And if thy brother become poor&#44; and let his hand sink near 
thee&#44; then shalt thou render him assistance&#44; whether he be a stran&#8211; 
ger or sojourner&#44; that he can live with thee.&#34; Lev. xxv. 35. 

There is no stipulation made here as to the cause 
of poverty&#44; nor who the poor one is&#44; whether he be 
even not an Israelite&#44; but one who has sought a home 
under our benignant laws&#59; it is all the same&#44; he is 
entitled to aid&#44; to comfort&#44; to being lifted up from 
his lowly estate&#44; he is a brother&#44; so that he may be 
able to live near us. Understand&#44; the precept is not 
here as to mere almsgiving&#44; to turn away a poor man 
with a small donation which is soon expended &#59; but a 
higher&#44; a more self&#8211;sacrificing duty is inculcated&#44; it is 
tljat of endowing the poor brother with means to help 
himself&#44; by which he may step out from the position 
of lowliness to take his place amidst the nobles of 
the land&#44; those who though now the wealthy and the 
honoured are at last nothing more than his brothers&#44; 
his fellow&#8211;citizens&#44; whose equal he is of right&#44; and 
whose associate in honour and consideration he may 
become hereafter&#44; if God only blesses his labour&#44; and 
sends prosperity to the works of his hands. In thus

bestowing aid we were warned not to look to our 
own interest&#44; not to make the necessities of the un&#8211; 
happy petitioner subservient to our own advantage. 
No&#44; as God had freely blessed us&#44; so should we freely 
bless our neighbour&#59; we should lend him our money 
without interest&#44; and our food without increase&#44; sat&#8211; 
isfied with having discharged in a small degree our 
obligation to Heaven&#44; by the mercy which we show 
to those whom He has afflicted&#44; in order that we may 
see his judgments&#44; and which circumstance gives us 
an opportunity to prove that we are not unworthy 
stewards of his bounty&#44; and that though prosperous 
we have not forgotten the One by whose gracious 
will &#34; our mountain has been made to stand firm&#44;&#34; 
whose sunshine has ripened our grain&#44; whose grass 
has fed our flocks&#44; and whose favouring gales have 
wafted our ships over the dangerous deep into the 
haven of safety. The precept therefore fittingly con&#8211; 
cludes &#58; &#34; I am the Lord your God&#44; who&#42;have brought 
you forth out of the land of Egypt&#44; to give unto you 
the land of Canaan&#44; to be unto you a God&#44;&#34; meaning&#44; 
Look back on the dreadful state of debasement in 
which you were plunged&#44; slaves as you were to Pha&#8211; 
raoh in Egypt&#44; not permitted to labour for yourselves&#44; 
your very life depending on a tyrant&#39;s will. And 
from this thraldom you were released&#44; in order to 
render you free&#44; enlightened&#44; and acquainted with 
the pure worship of the One Eternal&#44; who would give 
you a beautiful country as a home&#44; where you can&#44; if

THE BLESSING OF THE LORD. 351 



DISCOUESE XXV. 

THE BLESSING OP THE LORD. 

May the name of the Lord be blessed forever&#59; for 
the power and the government are his&#44; and He raiseth 
up kings&#44; and He casteth down kings&#44; and without 
Him nations kibour in vain attempts&#44; and if He with&#8211; 
hokls his protection&#44; all nature stands aftrighted and 
astonished at his presence. This is our God&#44; whom 
we worship&#59; this is our Father&#44; whom we adore&#44; be&#8211; 
cause He created the world in the beginning&#44; and 
erected the foundations of the earth by his own 
mighty will&#59; and when it pleased Him&#44; He descended 
before his redeemed servants and pointed out to them 
the way of life&#44; how they might walk in his presence&#44; 
and obtain his gracious favour by obedience. May it 
then be his will to plant his love and his fear in our 
hearts&#44; that we may direct to Him our thoughts&#44; and 
always consult the inspiration which He has vouch&#8211; 
safed to us in his word&#44; before we act or resolve on 
any course of life&#59; so that we may be supported by his 
love&#44; and discover his goodness in whatever may be 
dispensed to us in his wise and righteous judgment. 
So shall our life pass away in pleasantness and peace&#44; 
and contentment dwell in our habitations&#44; till we be 
summoned to the high abode of the pure and holy&#44; 
who are blessed by the light of the countenance of 
their Almighty Father&#44; who will shield and uphold

thera&#44; as those who are precious in his eyes&#44; and 
whom lie will bless with evcrlastiug life. Amen. 

Brethren &#58; 

In onr lesson of to&#8211;day&#44; there is given to us the 
form of the priestly blessing&#44; which the sons of Aaron 
arc to pronounce over the people&#44; and thus invoke for 
them the aid and countenance of the Grcjit Eternal&#44; 
whose name shall be glorified in the mouth of all the 
living&#44; as follows &#58; 

&#34; The Lord bless tliee&#44; and keep thee &#59; the Lord make his face to 
shine upon thee&#44; and be gracious unto thee &#59; the Lord lift up his 
countenance upon thee&#44; and give thee peace.&#34; Numb. vi. 2i&#8211;26. 

The words are almost the simplest which could be 
devised&#44; and they could only have sprung from the 
spirit of God himself&#59; for human invention would 
have added other matters &#8212; would have amplified&#44; 
and not appealed in so few expressions for all that we 
can ask of our heavenly Father. Yes&#44; even David in 
his Psalms&#44; when he asked for the same favours&#44; 
though he too spoke from the spirit that dwelt in 
him&#44; used&#44; in his sixty&#8211;seventh Psalm&#44; many more 
words to petition the Lord for the favours embraced 
in the D&#39;JHD nD&#8211;&#92;3 &#40;Priestly Blessing&#41;. It is even thus 
that we may appeal to the absence of all ornament 
and amplification in the Mosaic books&#44; to the extreme 
and severe simplicity which they present when speak&#8211; 
ing of both precept and doctrine&#44; for an additional 
testimony of their sacrcduess and truth&#59; and we may 

<pb n="353"/>

insist that their author was so thoroughly convinced 
of what he wrote&#44; for the instruction of the people&#44; 
to be the whole truth&#44; and nothing but the truth&#44; 
that he disdained borrowing from the orator and the 
poet any embellishment which they employ to render 
their words and thoughts pleasant to their hearers or 
readers. But&#44; few as the words are&#44; simple as is the 
construction of the three sentences comprising the 
blessing&#44; they are of the utmost importance and sig&#8211; 
nificance. 

Let us refer&#44; as we have done already&#44; to the sixty&#8211; 
seventh Psalm&#44; and we will find the following words 
T&#92;&#39;iD iJHN ViD &#8211;iN&#94; ij3&#8211;iyi ujn&#94; D&#39;&#39;n&#39;&#63;N &#34;May God be gracious 
unto us and bless us&#59; may He cause his face to shine 
with us. Selah.&#34; But the passage in Numbers vi. 
24&#8211;26&#44; commences&#44; Tiai5&#34;i &#39;n idm&#34; &#34;The Lord bless 
and keep thee&#59;&#34; thus using a different phrase from 
David when speaking of &#34;the Deity&#44; nevertheless re&#8211; 
ferring to the same great Being as the Author of all 
blessings. You may readily imagine that there is a 
deep design why Moses was bidden to use the term 
he did&#44; and that it is of high importance to us&#44; even 
at this late date in the history and progress of man&#8211; 
kind&#44; notwithstanding a great change has taken place 
in the condition of the world since that time&#44; to ascer&#8211; 
tain it. I&#34; will endeavour to make myself understood&#44; 
and beg of you to devote due attention to the perhaps 
dry definitions which I deem it my duty to give you. 
When Moses was first commissioned to speak to the 
Israelites&#44; he asked of God&#58; &#34;Behold&#44; I come to the 
children of Israel and say unto them&#44; The God of 
your fathers hath sent me unto you&#59; and if they then 
say unto me&#44; What is his name&#63; what shall I say unto

them &#63; &#34; This question may appear to jon very singu&#8211; 
lar&#59; you may say&#44; perhaps&#44; AVould it not be enough 
for Moses to tell the people tliat God had deputed 
him to effect their liberation&#63; and if they would be&#8211; 
lieve him at all&#44; must not this announcement satisfy 
them&#63; Besides&#44; what is there in the name of God&#44; 
that should render it of so much importance&#44; as to 
effect in Moses&#39;s estimation the mission with which he 
had been sent by the word which had then been&#44; for 
the first time&#44; revealed to him&#63; 

But you must reflect that when Moses was address&#8211; 
ing the Deity in the above words&#44; there was not that 
revealed knowledge of the great Adored which is now 
so widcly diffused abroad&#59; everywhere there were 
associations either of two or three persons in the 
idea which men entertained of God&#44; or at least&#44; there 
were a multitude of real or imaginary beings&#44; who 
were conceived all to have some divine attribute&#44; that 
is&#44; all to be more powerful than man&#44; and&#44; therefore&#44; 
claiming his homage. These gods were each known 
by a particular appellation&#44; under which worship was 
offered to the same&#59; and as each country had its own 
peculiar mythology&#44; its own divan of gods&#44; nations 
might be aptly called the people of the one or the 
other god or group of gods&#44; of which examples may 
be found in Scripture&#44; which&#44; however&#44; it would be 
out of place to detail in this comiexion. The earth 
was thus parcelled out among different tutelary pow&#8211; 
ers&#44; as much as there was a diversity of language&#44; com&#8211; 
plexion&#44; and manners. 

Moses himself&#44; though a descendant of Israel&#44; had 
imbibed in Egypt a knowledge of the customs and 
ideas of the people&#44; and of the priests of that land &#59; 

<pb n="355"/>

and tlicro can be no doubt but that the Israelites had 
iiniversally been deeply tinctured with the supersti&#8211; 
tions and idolatry that prevailed around them. I need 
not remind you how apt we are to borrow the views 
of those wbo surround us at all sides&#44; and how difier&#8211; 
ent appear the Jews of the East and the West&#44; simply 
because of the people in the midst of whom they live. 
It is not&#44; therefore&#44; to be wondered at tliat a residence 
of two hundred and ten years in Egypt&#44; for a very 
great period of which time we were subject to the ar&#8211; 
bitrary cruelties of the idolaters&#44; had vitiated what&#8211; 
ever knowledge we had derived from the patriarchs 
of the nature of God&#59; and though Moses may at the 
time have been free from idolatry himself &#40;indeed&#44; 
we ought to entertain the opinion that as he was 
chosen the instrument of a great deed&#44; he was merito&#8211; 
rious in the sight of God&#44; by being a devoted servant 
and true believer&#41;&#44; he spoke for and of the people&#44; ac&#8211; 
cording to the ideas prevailing at his time&#44; and de&#8211; 
manded&#44; therefore&#44; the name of the national God&#44; to 
report the message with which he had been charged 
in his name and belialf. Understand&#44; the liberation 
of the Israelites was to be effected against the evident 
will and interest of the Egyptians&#44; consequently&#44; also 
against the supposed assent of the gods of that coun&#8211; 
try&#44; assuming for them a power to prevent it&#44; as was 
alleged by their worshippers. It was&#44; therefore&#44; none 
of the Egyptian deities&#44; in whose name the message 
could be spoken &#59; perhaps they had been called by 
the same general appellation&#42; wdiich the Israelites 

&#42; The word God&#44; in its various Ibrms&#44; signifies&#44; in European lan&#8211; 
guages&#44; the being or beings to whom worship is rendered&#44; hence it 
is equally applicable to the Supreme or false divinities. If now&#44;

had given to their ancestral God. But&#44; he this as it 
may&#44; Moses found no distinctive name in liis recol&#8211; 
lection which would inspire that confidence which he 
considered&#44; and justly so&#44; as the first requisite to the 
accomplishment of that mission which had heen forced 
upon him to fulfil&#44; unwilling and fearful as lie was to 

the patriarchs only knew of a term which embraced the idea of 
power or greatness&#44; as the Almighty&#44; Most High&#44; or God &#59; and if 
the Egyptians called their gods by names significant of the same 
idea embraced in these terms &#58; it was evidently nothing distinctive 
to speak of the God who then spoke to Moses&#44; by any one of the 
names or attributes of the divinity then known. But the name 
then revealed in reply to his inquiry was&#44; of all others&#44; the one 
which had not been invented by man&#44; because not within his finite 
idea of conceiving&#44; unless it be by the aid of the Lord himself. It 
is&#44; the4&#34;efore&#44; that we may assume&#44; that the name we have received 
as the expression of God&#39;s eternity&#44; is the proper appellation em&#8211; 
bracing&#44; at the same time&#44; Unity and Eternity&#44; as we say &#39;p&#124; 
&#34;&#94;nx lOB&#94;l npN &#34; The Eternal is one&#44; and his name is one&#44;&#34; in con&#8211; 
tradistinction to other ideas which conceive the divine essence to 
consist of a combination of powers&#44; and consequently not one in 
name&#44; however great the attributes may be&#44; which are ascribed to 
the divine nature&#44; thus exhibited in the belief which embraces the 
idea of a plurality. Some persons think that the Jews would not bo 
Jews except out of opposition to other creeds&#44; or because they inter&#8211; 
pret certain scriptural passages differently from others &#59; but neither 
of these views is true. We are Jews because we have received a 
peculiar revelation &#59; and we remain so&#44; not because there is any im&#8211; 
portance to be attached to the few alleged fulfilments of prophecy&#44; 
but because any other belief in the nature of the Divinity and the 
divine legation of the prophets is hostile to the very principles on 
which we were established as a people&#44; and for the ujiholding of 
which&#44; the revelation of Sinai was given to us. We would teach 
the same doctrines whether there were Mahomcdans in the world 
or not &#59; tlieir jiresence may compel us to reply to their assumptions &#59; 
but it does not liave any real infiuence on our peculiar doctrines&#59; 
tliey are always true&#44; and always dcrivahh&#33; from the same source of 
information&#44; the Scriptures themselves&#44; and them only.

return to Egypt. The God of Abraham&#44; of Isaac&#44; and 
of Jacob&#44; as He had announced himself&#44; was not angry 
with Moses for the question which he had put&#44; and in 
mercy enlightened his ignorance&#59; and in so doing&#44; lie 
did not give him any name which is of arbitrary de&#8211; 
rivation&#44; as many proper names are&#44; but He employed 
the future tense of the verb to be&#44; or in other words&#44; 
He called himself I will be&#44; in Hebrew&#44; n&#94;nx &#40;Ehyeh&#41;&#44; 
or as given otherwise&#44; in the combination of the future 
and the present tenses of the root n&#94;n&#44; with the four 
letters mn&#39;&#44; embracing the idea of &#34;He who was&#44; is&#44; 
and will be.&#34; Jews now consider this revelation of 
God of himself and his being so sacred that they do 
not pronounce it as it is written&#44; and it was only used 
on certain solemn occasions&#44; such as when the high 
priest made his public confession on the Day of Atone&#8211; 
ment&#44; or when the priests pronounced the blessings 
on the people in the temple &#59; at other times&#44; it is pro&#8211; 
nounced as though it were written &#94;Jix Adonay&#44; equiv&#8211; 
alent to the English word &#34;Lord.&#34; The national God 
of the Hebrews was not&#44; according to this view&#44; to be 
known by any name denoting his other attributes&#44; but 
that expressing his eternity&#59; and as this name is inca&#8211; 
pable of a plural&#44; at least it is never found in the plural&#44; 
and is thus referring to one only&#44; and this invariably 
throughout Scripture&#58; we shall have better means 
than otherwise of understanding the phrase&#44; which 
we also owe to Moses&#44; and which constitutes the creed 
of the Jews&#44; I mean inx &#39;n imbx &#39;n &#34; The Lord our 
God&#44; the Lord is one.&#34; AVe know that the Avord o&#8211;n&#94;x 
is often used in the plural&#44; either to signify idols&#44; or 
the gods of the nations&#59; or angels&#44; as the messengers 
of God&#59; or at last judges&#44; as the human beings who

are placed in authority. The word Mohim&#44; dirme&#44; does 
not&#44; therefore&#44; carry in Hebrew&#44; by any means&#44; the 
same sacred character as it does in EngUsh or other 
modern language &#59; as it is merely an expression of 
power&#44; either actual or imaginary&#44; and is&#44; in truth&#44; 
derived from &#39;&#94;x &#34; power&#44;&#34; &#34; strength&#44;&#34; or &#34; might.&#34; 
There can&#44; therefore&#44; be false d&#94;h&#94;n&#44; as â–¡&#39;&#34;inx o&#8211;n&#39;7x&#59; or 
not&#8211;gods m&#94;N xS&#44; things having neither power nor 
being&#44; as they exist merely in their divine idea in the 
arbitrary assumption of their worshippers &#59; whilst at 
the same time the term may&#44; with equal propriety&#44; 
be applied to the Holiest and Highest&#44; the God whom 
we worship. And as the form is plural&#44; so may the 
idea be which we have of the divine nature in its 
being the source of all power&#44; or the totality of the 
forces of nature centred in one who directs all &#59; the 
verb or adjective belonging to it may&#44; therefore&#44; oc&#8211; 
casionally be met with in the plural number&#44; not as 
indicating a multitude or aggregation of persons in 
the Godhead&#44; but as agreeing in form merely with 
the substantive expressing the Divine Being. I have 
spoken of this on a previous occasion&#44; and only refer 
to it now in combination with the subject before us. 
We call God&#44; therefore&#44; either &#94;x or m&#39;7x&#44; the universal 
power&#44; in the&#8211; singular&#44; or d&#94;hSn&#44; the aggregation of 
all imaginable powers in one&#44; in the plural&#44; in contra&#8211; 
distinction to the worshipped beings of other people 
which are un&#8211;gods&#44; nibx xb&#44; or foreign&#44; strange&#44; other 

gods&#44; D&#34;&#34;&#40;nN D&#39;H&#94;N. 

It is somewhat curious&#44; let us note in this place&#44; 
that with sufRxes&#44; which answer to the possessive pro&#8211; 
nouns in English and other languages&#44; we always iind 
the word God construed in the plural&#44; with the ex&#8211; 

<pb n="359"/>

THE BLESSING OF THE LORD. 359 

ception when applied to the first person singular&#44; 
which alone derived its form either from the root &#94;x 
or D&#39;nSx thus &#63;x Eli&#44; or also &#39;n&#92;x Elohay&#44; &#34; my God.&#34; 
Otherwise we find always the plural suffixes&#44; as yn&#59;c.&#44; either when meaning thy &#40;or his&#41; god or 
gods&#44; either applied to the true God&#44; or idols. 

Thus much for the form&#44; to which some erroneous 
interpreters have attached an importance which it 
does not deserve&#44; especially as there are other words&#44; 
such as jnx and &#34;7&#59;>3 lord&#44; master&#44; which are always 
construed with plural suffixes&#44; though but one person 
is meant&#59; such as niyx i&#94; &#124;n&#94; mx dn &#34; If his lord should 
give him a wife&#34; &#40;Exod. xxi. 4&#41;&#59; or io&#59;&#39; j&#92;x v&#94;&#94;jjd &#34; The 
owner thereof not being with it&#34; &#40;Ibid. xxii. 13&#41;. 
These phrases clearly prove that the plural construc&#8211; 
tion of a word does not necessarily imply a plurality 
of persons&#44; and it depends entirely on the use and 
custom of the language&#44; wdiether this be the Hebrew&#44; 
or any other tongue &#59; since examples of the kind can 
be found in all others&#44; at least those with which I am 
acquainted. Bat as in fact the true God is&#44; as said&#44; 
the One embracing all the powers&#44; we may truly call 
Him the Elohim D&#39;nSx&#44; or the Container and Dispenser 
of all possible springs of action&#44; the Accumulation of 
all the forces which sustain and give life to all. It is 
not that there is a plurality in the person&#44; but because 
there is a multitude in the ideas of power which com&#8211; 
prise his attributes. 

But far different is it with the special attribute of 
eternity&#44; wdiich is in itself perfect&#44; so that no accession 
or diminution can herein be imagined. God could 
be the most potent&#44; though lie lacked any one of the 
attributes of greatness which we ascribe to Him. But 

<pb n="360"/>

360 THE BLESSING OF THE LORD. 

He could not be the Eternal&#44; if He lacked either past&#44; 
present&#44; or future existence. But as the first Cause&#44; 
as the Creator&#44; as the Sustainer of things&#44; and under 
this word I comprehend whatever of physical or 
spiritual beings or powers may be existing or possible 
to exist&#44; He must have this continuity of being&#44; to be 
what He is. There must not be any one or more than 
one who could have preceded Him&#44; nor must there 
be one or more than one wdio will succeed or survive 
Him &#58; He is the first and the last&#44; as our creed desig&#8211; 
nates the blessed All&#8211;father. H there wxre two coex&#8211; 
isting powers equally great&#44; there could be no con&#8211; 
cord in the government of the world&#44; unless they 
existed at the same place&#44; and had an identity of will&#44; 
or unless the two would be practically one. If there 
were&#44; however&#44; two powers not so entirely coinciding 
in the same will&#44; then could there not reign that har&#8211; 
mony in universal nature of wdiich all investigation 
gives us the amplest proof. For from the earliest 
record of history&#44; and this is all we have to govern 
our views in this investigation&#44; we have evidence of 
the same progression of outward nature&#59; and whatever 
the chronicles of science hand down to us&#44; amounts to 
the confirmation of the same idea&#44; that there has been 
no interruption in the regular course of whatever is 
subject to our observation&#44; and that nothing has been 
destroyed or added by any extraneous influence which 
we can discover. Or&#44; in other words&#44; the same eter&#8211; 
nal Vigilance which created in the beginning&#44; still 
watches and sustains all&#44; &#8212; and this by himself alone&#44; 
Avithout help or associate. He is comprising within 
himself all the powers requisite to carry out his plan 
of government&#44; whilst He exists as such alone&#44; and 

<pb n="361"/>

needs not&#44; and cannot obtain in aught the help or coun&#8211; 
sel of any being&#44; since no one of all things is eternal&#44; 
whereas He existed prior to them all&#44; and will survive 
them all&#44; in the event of their change or destruction&#44; 
&#8212; the period at which this is to occur being again 
altogether within his knowledge&#44; as the capacity to 
change or destroy is also entirely and solely within 
his means and power. 

So then Moses taught us our faith in the words 
which we have cited&#44; and which mean accordingly&#44; 
&#34; The Lord Eternal&#44; whom we call our God&#44; the God 
Israel&#44; is lie who alone is the Eternal.&#34; If the 
nations worship Him&#44; they worship the &#34; God of 
Israel&#59;&#34; and if they worship another&#44; then is there 
no existence for the same&#44; because he is not eternal&#44; 
and consequently not God. The oneness is the in&#8211; 
separable idea of the eternity of God&#44; and a mul&#8211; 
titude in this eternity is inconceivable&#44; and conse&#8211; 
quently not in existence&#59; and because it is requisite 
that the God of Israel should be eternal&#44; it also fol&#8211; 
lows that He is one&#44; without an associate&#44; as He is 
without any beginning or end&#44; which we can fix as 
the commencement and termination of his existence. 
Now&#44; few as are the words inx &#39;n irn&#39;&#63;&#94; &#39;n they are 
justly the watchwords of Israel&#44; and simple as they 
arc they can hardly be rendered by any other terms 
in any other language&#44; and consequently every at&#8211; 
tempted translation must be far from attaining to the 
force and sublimity which are contained in the origi&#8211; 
nal. We can feel the ardour of holiness mounting up 
in our soul&#44; when we contemplate the elevation&#44; the 
power&#44; and the eternity of God &#59; we can imagine how 
He is alone enthroned in might&#44; how all proceeds

from Ilim&#44; the poreunicil Source of all existence&#59; but 
Avords fiiil to convey our thoughts &#59; our mind wanders 
when we mean to condense what has sprung up in 
our spirit&#44; and we humbly close the book of inquiry&#44; 
we repose on the revelation of himself which God has 
given us&#44; and we say indeed&#44; &#34; O Thou God who hast 
created all&#44; Thou art the Eternal &#33; Thou art One&#44; and 
the sole Eternal.&#34; None but the higliest inspiration 
could so have pictured the Divine Majesty&#44; and none 
but the Lord Eternal himself could have given the 
embodiment of what and how He is&#59; that as the one&#44; 
lie combines all the power&#44; and tijat as the other. He 
is unlimited by time&#44; and not controlled by any asso&#8211; 
ciate&#44; and that He therefore requires not any aid to 
effect his supreme will wherever his omniscient gaze 
penetrates the uttermost end of things. 

You will therefore understand that the name of the 
national God of the Hebrews has no reference what&#8211; 
ever to anything connected with the descendants of 
Abraham&#44; &#8212; nothing peculiar to this or that people&#44; 
but only as indicating his eternity&#44; and by conse&#8211; 
quence his unity. We therefore cannot say &#34;our 
Eternal&#44;&#34; or the holy Name united with a possessive 
pronoun&#44; because we have no claim to Him in that 
capacity&#59; but by acknowledging Him&#44; and worshij&#41;&#8211; 
ping Him alone. He becomes our God&#44; U&#39;n&#94;x Eloham&#59; 
and we are by the same means his people&#44; &#92;&#94;v &#39;Ammo. 
But as we said&#44; at the lirst calling of Moses the peo&#8211; 
ple were ignorant of his name&#44; and it required there&#8211; 
fore a revelation to teach them how they and the 
whole world stood related to the Being who was 
about to redeem them. Now&#44; as no name was as&#8211; 
signed to Him which would exclude any nation from

joining Lis worship&#44; as no people were able to assume 
tlie peculiar name of this God as their own peculiar 
appelation&#44;&#42; as they remained sons of Israel after 
their election as before &#58; it necessarily follows&#44; that 
though the Lord Eternal calls us his people&#44; if we 
obey his commandments&#44; all nations can become 
equally identified with llim&#44; if they follow the path 
He has marked out for our course of life. The privi&#8211; 
lege of Israel consists not in an exemption from any 
worldly sufferings&#44; but in the possession of a superior 
system of laws and morals&#44; devised by the Creator 
himself as the expression of his will to the sons of 
man. Whoever then glories himself in the Lord&#44; 
becomes a child of the Lord &#59; and the privilege is one 
of universal diffusion &#59; and no one is excluded by any 
insurmountable difficulty&#44; as soon as the message of 
life is made known to him. It is therefore false&#44; if 
our opponents assert&#44; that the national God of the 
Jews is represented by us as one of narrow sentiment&#44; 
of an exclusive regard for our insigniiicant tribe&#44; for 
a people not distinguished for any peculiar noble trait 
and high endowment. For even admit that our in&#8211; 
tellect were the lowest of all mankind&#44; it would not 
affect the question in the least&#59; since our faith is not 
based upon our inventive faculties&#44; our peculiar ex&#8211; 
cellence&#44; either moral or physical&#44; but upon the great&#8211; 
ness of the Lord&#44; who is supreme in heaven and on 
earth. But it is not true that we are unfitted for the 
sphere assigned us&#59; we are a peculiar&#44; hardy&#44; endur&#8211; 
ing race&#44; rushing like a mighty torrent amidst the

waves of Immau population without mingling with 
it&#59; distinguishable at all ages by the unmistakable 
landmarks which define every other nation&#44; and&#44; if 
we regard a pure and unmixed descent&#44; more so than 
any other people which ever existed. And whether 
this was a new impression made on our character 
when we received the law&#44; or whether it was always 
so&#58; enough&#44; the fact exists&#44; and no one can deny it&#44; 
as history has stamped an indelible seal on every 
word which I have just now uttered. But we assert 
that the Lord is the universal God of all the world&#44; 
only that we were chosen his instruments&#44; his pecu&#8211; 
liar servants&#44; or his kingdom of priests&#44; to be devoted&#44; 
for as long a time as He might deem fitting&#44; to propa&#8211; 
gate his relio&#59;ion amongst the inhabitants of the world. 
The Lord is accordingly the term used throughout 
the books containing the events of Moses&#39;s life&#44; with 
few exceptions&#44; to signify the One who is pre&#8211;eminent 
in his holy attributes&#44; and who alone claims the wor&#8211; 
ship of Israel&#59; not because He is something to them 
which He is not to other nations&#44; but because He is 
that in truth which other divinities are not. He is 
the God of Israel&#44; and called by their name&#44; and they 
are called after Him&#44; &#34; the people of the Lord&#59;&#34; not 
because we were ignorant&#44; or are so now&#44; of his uni&#8211; 
versal rule&#44; but because other nations did not&#44; and do 
not now receive his word alone as their guide &#59; because 
they act not as He has written in his law&#44; and because 
they unite in their prayers ideas whirh He has not 
taught&#44; or call on a being or beings other than the 
Eternal One. &#8212; Now all the time that Moses lived&#44; it 
was his mission to bear testimony&#44; emphatic and uni&#8211; 
form&#44; against the vanities of the worship of the geu&#8211; 

<pb n="365"/>

tiles&#59; and he used&#44; therefore&#44; every opportunity to 
impress the great truth&#44; that &#34; from the Lord is all&#44;&#34; 
upon the people. But in the time of David&#44; our re&#8211; 
ligion had been confirmed&#44; centuries had elapsed&#44; and 
the code promulgated at Sinai had taken deep root 
in the heart of the sons of Jacob &#59; and when they 
spoke of God&#44; surrounded as they were by his bless&#8211; 
ings in their beautiful land&#44; protected by the govern&#8211; 
ment of the laws of Moses&#44; the word &#34; God&#34; carried 
with it at once an acknowledgment of the sole Su&#8211; 
preme. David&#44; therefore&#44; properly says &#58; &#34; May God 
be gracious unto us and bless us&#59;&#34; it is no doctrine 
which the Psalmist teaches&#44; but he mercly appeals to 
his heavenly Sovereign to have a favourable regard 
on his servants&#44; and to bless them with the light of 
his countenance&#44; with that everlasting&#44; inward&#44; holy&#44; 
peace which He bestows on those who serve Him. 
He&#44; for this reason also&#44; properly includes all nations 
in the praise&#44; which all shall offer up&#44; when His king&#8211; 
dom shall be established&#44; and all the families of the 
earth shall be judged in equity. But Moses was the 
teacher in every word which he was told to write&#59; 
he therefore does not use the word &#34; May God bless 
thee&#44;&#34; but &#34; May the Lord bless thee and keep 
thee&#44;&#34; or the one who is alone able to grant a bless&#8211; 
ing&#44; who alone is able to guard and watch oyer his 
creatures&#44; with whom there is no mediator&#44; with 
whom there is no associate&#44; with whom there is not a 
second to share his glory&#44; who has no successor to 
whom to transfer his power. And in this late age 
the appeal is yet made &#59; it is a sequel to the Shemang 
Yisrael&#44; or rather as the revelation of the last was 
subsequent to the Priestly Blessing&#44; it is with it an

exposition of the idea embraced in the first precept 
ofthe Decalogue&#44; &#34; I am the Lord thy God.&#34; It then 
means that the God who brought such stupendous 
deeds&#44; as made the unwilling tyrant let millions of 
bondmen go free&#44; is the same from whom all l&#41;less&#8211; 
ings proceed&#44; and who is the sole Being who has any 
substantive power&#44; unchecked by any other to eifect 
his will in all parts of creation. &#8212; Yes&#44; the time is long 
past since the faithful received this blessing from the 
one who was trusty in all God&#39;s house&#59; and empires 
and creeds have since changed&#44; and have followed 
each other upon the ruins of former empires and 
creeds&#59; and still in the Creator himself there is no 
change&#59; lie is yet the only Eternal wdio existed in 
the times of the son of Amram &#59; and he&#44; this happy 
mortal&#44; this great Moses&#44; rescued by Providence from 
the flood of the Nile&#44; to become a prophet&#44; the mouth&#8211; 
piece of his Master&#44; is yet the teacher of the people 
for whom he was chosen the messenger. Whatever 
was true in ethics then is true now&#44; and no addition 
has since been made to our stock of moral ideas&#44; nor 
to our knowledge of the ways of the Most High. Just&#44; 
then&#44; as we were instructed&#44; so must we proceed&#44; and 
by the same wu&#41;rds by which our predecessors craved 
for themselves the acknowledged aid and assistance 
of God&#44; must we continue to implore the blessing of 
the Lord. It is not that we are hostile to the world &#59; 
for truth opposed to error is no hostility on the part 
of truth&#59; but well does error alwaj&#8211;s endeavour to 
stifle the voice of conviction&#44; for fear of its empire 
falling&#44; should heaven&#8211;born sincerity appeal to the 
hearts. But let us not heed the storm that ever and

dom endures from generation to generation &#33; give his 
wisdom to understand thy ways&#44; and enlighten our 
mind that we may fully comprehend our relation to 
Thee&#44; and thereby learn to subdue our heart to be 
devoted to thy worship. Teach us to distinguish be&#8211; 
tween the apparent and the real&#59; between the seem&#8211;

the outside of things&#59; whereas Thou probest the soul&#44; 
and knowest the thought and desires of the.heart of 
man&#44; that they are vain. Yes&#44; let thy law be our guide&#44; 
thy wisdom the beacon for our wayward course&#44; that 
we may live to please Thee&#44; and depart hence with 
the blessed assurance that we have obtained thy 
grace&#44; which is life everlasting. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

It is not simple believing&#44; blind faith&#44; which con&#8211; 
stitutes the Jewish religion &#59; for we are perfectly at 
liberty to search and investigate the reasons and 
foundations of the precepts which we have received&#59; 
at the same time&#44; however&#44; should we not succeed 
in our search&#44; it is the part of Israelites&#44; as men of 
faith&#44; to submit to the teaching of the Lord&#44; and obey 
to the letter&#44; even where they do not clearly distin&#8211; 
guish the motives of the divine Author of our law. 
It is not very difficult to understand the nature of this 
double quality of our religion&#44; &#8212; its being founded on 
reason and on faith &#59; for in the first principle is in&#8211; 
cluded the reliance that God has given us power to 
comprehend in a great measure his ways with man&#44; 
and in the other we are presented with an incentive 
to follow the Great Shepherd&#44; whichever direction He 
may be pleased to lead us&#44; without our &#40;piestioning 
Him wherefore lie has chosen the road on which Ave 
are bidden to walk. In our articles of belief&#44; there&#8211; 
fore&#44; there is nothing contrary to the simplest dictates 
of human reason&#58; whilst in the details of the com&#8211; 
mandments there are&#44; besides the precepts which owe 
their origin to historical events&#44; and others which are 
clearly referable to what intelligent men will readily

acquiesce in&#44; some which no human reason would 
have evolved&#44; and for the fullilment of which we can&#8211; 
not adduce any arguments founded on what our ra&#8211; 
tiocination might produce. In brief&#44; they spring from 
the Divine Mind as trials of our obedience&#44; and to 
prove whether indeed we love the Lord our God with 
all our heart and with all our soul. With these views 
premised&#44; let us take for our to&#8211;day&#39;s consideration 
the words which we find in the second verse of the 
nineteenth chapter of Numbers &#58; 

&#34; This is the statute of the law which the Lord hath commar&#94;ded&#44; 
saying&#44; Speak to the children of Israel that they take unto thee a 
red faultless cow&#44; on which there is no blemish&#44; on which no yoke 
hath come.&#34; Numb. xix. 2. 

It is not requisite to transcribe the whole precept&#44; 
as you can refer to it by inspecting your Bible&#44; out 
of which it is to be hoped it is your custom every 
Sabbath and festival to read the whole section of the 
day&#44; together with the prophetic lessons&#44; either before 
or after hearing the same read to you authoritatively 
in the house of God&#59; ibr thus only can you become 
familiar with your religion&#44; by imbibing gradually&#44; 
and therefore imperceptibly&#44; the words on which it is 
founded. At a future day your special attention will&#44; 
God willing&#44; be called to the benefit of stated Scrip&#8211; 
ture reading&#59; but at present it is only incidentally 
that I alluded to it. So it is to be supposed that you 
have read before this&#44; or will read hereafter the con&#8211;

text of our text&#59; wherefore it is necessary only to 
refer to it as though wo had now recited it aUogethcr. 
You will then see how minute the directions are 
which are given concerning the preparation of this 
unique sacrifice&#44; as it was not oftered&#44; like all the 
others&#44; to be burnt on the altar&#44; or to be eaten by the 
people or priests&#44; nor was its blood sprinkled on the 
horns of the altar&#59; but it was slain outside of the 
camp&#44; or afterwards outside of the city of Jerusalem&#44; 
its blood was sprinkled on the ground in the direc&#8211; 
tion&#44; however&#44; of the front side of the sanctuary&#44; and 
afterwards the entire carcass was burnt with the ad&#8211; 
dition&#44; thrown into the burning mass&#44; of a piece of 
cedar&#8211;wood&#44; some hyssop&#44; and a scarlet thread. If 
the other part of the sacrificial scheme is in a great 
measure a mystery to us&#44; since we may assume&#44; with&#8211; 
out impugning the wisdom of God&#44; that He could 
always&#44; as He does now&#44; forgive sin without the in&#8211; 
tervention of sacrifices&#58; this one in particular baffles 
all our research to assign any rational cause for its 
institution&#44; contrary as are its especial ordinances to 
those referring to the others &#59; inasmuch as it is a 
sacrifice&#44; without entering the temple precincts&#59; the 
priest ordained to prepare it&#44; is the second in rank 
of his brothers&#59; and then whoever handles it or its. 
ashes is defiled till evening&#44; whilst it is instituted&#44; and 
the ashes thereof are used&#44; to cleanse the unclean 
who has come near the dead&#44; so that he may again 
enter the holy courts of God&#44; which act would in his 
state of defilement call down upon him the punish&#8211; 
ment denounced against him who profanes the sanc&#8211; 
tuary of the Lord. It is&#44; therefore&#44; properly termed 
a &#34; statute of the law&#44;&#34; or an enactment which is 

<pb n="371"/>

not deducible from human reason&#44; nor resolvable by 
onr usual rules of computing cause and effect. At 
the same time it must bo evident that this&#44; with some 
other precepts which the law contains&#44; can be easily 
explained allegorically &#59; for instance&#44; we might as&#8211; 
sume that it is a type of our human nature&#44; impure 
in its unbridled tendencies&#44; and holy when governed 
by the will of God&#59; wdioever yields himself to the 
government of his passions without reflecting on the 
consequences of his doings will be defiled thereby&#59; 
he renders himself unfit for the perfect entrance into 
the sanctuary of God&#44; until he have&#44; so to say&#44; waited 
in anxiety and sorrow till troubles have improved his 
heart&#44; when&#44; as it were&#44; he is restored to favour as 
one renders himself clean by washing his soiled gar&#8211; 
ments. So also becomes the human heart a purified 
receptacle of holy thoughts when it lias invested itself 
with the attributes of obedience and resignation to 
divine decrees&#59; or&#44; it is pure or impure according as 
its promptings are good or evil&#44; just as the red cow 
was defiling or cleansing according to the various 
circumstances and phases in which the same was 
found&#44; and all this by the decree of God&#44; which alone 
is of right the arbiter of what is good and evil in our 
life. But although we might carry this allegorical 
exposition out with ease&#44; and add perhaps some few 
historical illustrations to complete the picture&#44; we 
have nevertheless no reason whatever to suppose that 
any such motives entered the Divine Mind in giving 
this and other ordinances of bis religion. Where no 
reason is assigned&#44; it would be vain to assume any 
particular ground as a basis&#44; and thus injure and mar 
the beauty of religion by mukiug things types of any

circumstance or event&#44; with which they have no con&#8211; 
nexion by direct aUusion and necessary deduction. 

If it were indeed that Moses was merely sent to 
foreshadow things to occur hereafter&#44; and that his 
mission was not a reaUty&#44; but a mere image of future 
events &#58; then might we proceed in hunting up for 
spiritualizing and allegorical expositions&#44; and&#44; suiting 
the text to posterior events&#44; say that this is the type 
of that particular thing which occurred so many cen&#8211; 
turies thereafter&#44; although the Bible does not say so 
itself. But bow does the case stand&#63; What was the 
mission of Moses &#63; was it to establish an evanescent 
legislation&#44; or to promulgate half&#8211;developed doctrines&#63; 
Whoever would dare to maintain such a proposition&#44; 
would to a certainty betray a very imperfect knowl&#8211; 
edge both of the words and spirit of Scripture. Ex&#8211; 
amine the Pentateuch&#58; and what does it profess to 
be &#63; Simply an exposition of a few fundamental doc&#8211; 
trines which are to lie as the foundation of religious 
and s&#8211;ocial practices&#44; and a multitude of observances 
which are to govern society and individuals&#44; and then 
again to be supporters of those doctrines on which they 
are founded. Doctrine and duty are like the stones 
of a mighty arch which support one the other&#44; and 
which by themselves individually are nothing but 
disjointed&#44; and therefore useless masses. 

Whatever the ultimate design of the Deity may 
be&#44; and which is not for us to inquire into farther 
than his revelation will permit us to go&#44; since we have 
received no other light &#58; &#40;his much is certain&#44; that 
ISIoses was deputed to teach doctrines which are true&#44; 
and precepts which are just. It is not to be supposed 
now&#44; that one truth can be the foreshadowing of an&#8211; 

<pb n="373"/>

THE STATUTES. 373 

other dissimilar trutli&#44; or that one precept which is 
just can be the type of another which is to repeal 
this one. It would be indeed wonderful that two 
things not alike can each be true&#44; or that one of them 
should at this period be invested with all the charac&#8211; 
teristics of certainty&#44; and cease to be thus at a future 
day&#44; yielding its force and convictive power to some&#8211; 
thing radically diflering from itself&#44; and which was 
not known at the time when it first became estab&#8211; 
lished as a truth. The same holds good with duties. 
Assume that it is consonant with divine Reason or 
the divine Will to establish a certain code of laws&#44; and 
without starting from this point we cannot believe in 
a revelation &#58; then it is also certain that sucli a code 
of laws must be good and true&#59; since nothing evil 
and false can proceed from God. If now the Mosaic 
law was both true and good at its first institution&#44; it 
is utterly impossible that it could have been designed 
as a type of a future new legislation diftering from it 
in any one particular&#44; especially if no direct reference 
can be found in the law itself to such a new and al&#8211; 
tered state of things. It therefore follows that&#44; to in&#8211; 
vest our law with nothing but a typical force&#44; and to 
place the statutes on a basis of shadows and images 
of what was to be&#44; is certainly not carrying out the 
design which is evident throughout the Pentateuch 
and the writings of the prophets&#44; even if our reason 
could admit such a procedure&#44; wliicli it does not. 
In all the law we are told that the ordinances should 
be statutes for everlasting&#59; consequently they must 
be constantly of binding force&#44; under all circum&#8211; 
stances where their execution becomes practicable&#59; 
and this must be for all those who were included 
VOL. VII. 32 

<pb n="374"/>

374 THE STATUTES. 

among the persons to whom the legislation applied. 
The liiw was&#44; as we know&#44; giv&#8211;en to the IsracUtes 
alone&#44; for tlie time being&#59; it was instituted for all 
their generations&#59; consequently&#44; if there is any truth 
at all in it&#44; it must apply to all who belong to these 
generations&#44; without any limit of time&#44; unless this limit 
be indicated in the law itself. Different&#44; however&#44; is 
it with those who were not included in the legisla&#8211; 
tion &#59; to these a portion only of the law may be justly 
applicable&#59; and this can be maintained without in 
the least absolving the others from any part&#44; even the 
minutest of their obligations. All this does not con&#8211; 
fer on the part not applicable to those first excluded 
any typical nature&#59; since it cannot be applied to any 
thing other than itself&#44; as nothing beyond itself has 
a&#44;ny necessary connexion with it. 

But there was an evident desio&#59;n in establishing 
the law&#44; which we can detect without any great 
search&#44; and this is the imprin>ting of everlasting 
truths on the minds of the people. Nor need ixwy 
one imagine that it is unworthy of the greatness of 
God to use external means to have an inward eiiect. 
We are children of the earth&#44; material beings&#44; flesh 
and blood&#44; although we have a spirit also by means 
of which we think and feel. Mere doctrines divested 
of outward acts would speedily fall into oblivion&#59; 
tradition might uphold them for a time&#59; but if they 
are assailed by contrary opinions&#44; and assume that 
these are professed by the vast majorky&#44; tliey must 
necessarily yield&#44; not having any tangible point in 
life on which they can lean for support. This is 
human weakness perhaps&#59; granted&#59; hut we have to 
deal with frailties&#44; faults and i&#41;assions in this life&#59; it

is our organization&#44; and right or wrong it exists&#44; 
and we cannot elevate ourselves above the sphere 
in which we are placed. Tlio boldest skeptic there&#8211; 
fore&#44; how much soever he may exclaim against the de&#8211; 
fects of the human heart which he discovers&#44; and&#44; by 
which he justifies his rebellion against the Author of 
our being&#44; must therefore confess&#44; that man requires 
matter or material things in which to labour and to 
exert himself The spirit itself is enlightened through 
means of material things&#59; the eye must perceive out&#8211; 
ward objects&#59; the ear must drink in outward sounds&#59; 
and any other means of obtaining information&#44; or spir&#8211; 
itual progression&#44; is supernatural&#44; a gift not avouched 
to any one save the prophets and messengers of God. 
&#34;We may then assume that our religion was also in&#8211; 
tended to act as a negative to heathen doctrines&#44; or 
those ideas which are contrary to revealed truths&#59; 
and at the same time the acts were so arranged as to 
be a constantly recurring remembrance of the doc&#8211; 
trines which we had received. It was not accordinjrlv 
to be expected that all our deeds were to be such&#44; 
as man might liaveinventtxl upon reasonable grounds&#44; 
or in fact such as we could defend upon experience of 
every&#8211;day life. Were it so&#44; it would argue that we 
could completely enter into the counsel of God&#44; or 
what is the same&#44; place our own reason upon an 
equality with the Divine Mind&#44; an absurdity which is 
apparent upon its being stated. But we may farther 
assume&#44; that the more startling acts and ceremonies 
we had to observe&#44; the stronger was our mind drawn 
to think and to dwell on the doctrines which we were 
appointed to guard&#44; and for which purpose alone we 
had been instituted a people. Only look upon the

spectacle which we now present to the world. Re&#8211; 
move however the SabbatJi&#59; the abstaining from for&#8211; 
bidden food&#59; the restriction on a connubial connexion 
with other people&#44; and similai&#34; laws &#58; and it need not 
be proved that we must long since have been obliter&#8211; 
ated from the face of the earth&#44; and a distinctive son 
of Israel would not have been found in existence&#44; 
from the very period when these peculiar features in 
his life ceased to be witnessed. But if it Avas needed 
for a wise purpose to announce the great truths of 
religion through means of a peculiar race&#44; not other&#8211; 
wise so except through its peculiar laws&#44; it neces&#8211; 
sarily follows&#44; that till there be no farther use for this 
people to promulgate the doctrines of which they are 
the bearers&#44; they must necessarily be upheld by the 
same principles through which they were instituted 
a people&#44; a nation amidst the other families of the 
earth&#44; 

Now our religion presents precisely such features&#44; 
as contradistinguished it formerly from the ancient 
systems of belief and practice&#44; and it yet marks us 
separate amidst the masses of modern times. In 
Egypt we had observed the senseless worship of ani&#8211; 
mals&#59; those creatures which had been assigned to us 
as food&#44; were elevated by the highly civilized race of 
the land of the Nile into objects of dread and adora&#8211; 
tion. And when our fathers&#44; soon after tlicir liber&#8211; 
ation&#44; forgot their newly&#8211;bestowed religion&#44; they 
speedily turned back to the idols which they had 
long known&#44; and they bowed themselves to the image 
of a grass&#8211;eating ox. In their transgressing&#44; they de&#8211; 
iiled themselves on the idol of their ancient masters&#44; 
and showed themselves unworthy of their precious

privilege which had just been conferred on them. 
And dearly was the sin&#44; which had been consum&#8211; 
mated in a measure through the forced complicity of 
the man who had been chosen as the chief of the 
priests of God&#44; the first and the head of his line&#44; 
atoned for. Have we now a solution of the institu&#8211; 
tion of the red cow&#44; slain under the direction of tlic 
second priest&#44; defiling by contact all who touch it&#44; 
whilst its dust purified the highest known degree of 
uncleanness &#63; Was not also the golden calf burnt in 
fire and ground into dust by the prophet&#44; to probe 
therewith the sinning people&#63; Let us analyze. The 
highest priest had been the means of promoting sin&#44; 
through the emblem of a calf&#59; a red cow&#44; red being 
a type of sin&#44; let it be remendjered&#44; one free from 
blemish&#44; never having been subjected to labour&#44; and 
all over red&#44; was to be carefully selected from all the 
herds of the laud&#44; to be given into the hands of the 
second priest&#44; in order to render it an object of puri&#8211; 
fication. It was not a sacrifice to propitiate&#44; to atone&#44; 
or to return thanks&#59; it was an emblem of sin and its 
defilements&#44; of contrition and its healing power&#59; 
therefore was it taken out of the camp&#44; beyond the 
precincts of the sanctuary&#44; though it was itself to be 
the means of permitting the unclean to come back 
into the tabernacle of the Lord. The lofty cedar&#44; the 
type of exaltation&#44; and the lowly liyssop&#44; the emblem 
of humility&#44; were tied together by another type of 
sin&#44; the string of scarlet&#44; and&#44; while the cow was re&#8211; 
duced to ashes&#44; the priest was to drop them together 
into the pile &#59; because if one asks for forgiveness&#44; and 
feels that he has sinned in the presumptuous reliance 
on his own greatness&#44; he must become contrite and 

32&#42;

lowly as the hyssop on the wall&#44; before he can be re&#8211; 
ceived into favour. And as the sin of the golden 
calf was the first of a series of acts of ingratitude&#44; 
by means of which we drew down upon ourselves the 
dread punishments which are still visible among us &#58; 
the sacrifice&#44; historically emblematic of this trans&#8211; 
gression&#44; was to be used for all our generations as 
the means of restoring the unclean to the functions of 
an Israelite&#44; and of rendering liini again a fellow&#8211;wor&#8211; 
shipper among the undcfiled of his people. And as it 
is not the man&#44; who is but the instrument&#44; nor the water&#34; 
itself that makes the atonement&#58; so was it ordained 
that he that sprinkled and he that touched the water 
of purification should both be unclean for the day&#59; 
though by the sprinkling itself the unclean was made 
clean&#44; just as sin can be forgiven only by the power 
of God&#44; who himself wills to forgive&#44; and who sanc&#8211; 
tifies the unworthy and humble means which we em&#8211; 
ploy in his service&#44; though in themselves they are so 
utterly inadequate if measured against his greatness 
and sanctity. According to this view the waters of 
purification were an energetic testimony against the 
deep&#8211;roQted love for the idols of Egypt&#44; and in conse&#8211; 
quence also against all systems of false worship &#59; and 
the precept was given to cause us to regard as un&#8211; 
sound and untrue every doctrine which tends to as&#8211; 
cribe&#44; in the first place&#44; any special power to any par&#8211; 
ticular object in all creation&#44; though it be adored by 
many and enlightened men&#59; for was it not the abomi&#8211; 
nable emblem of the Egyptian mythology wliicli thus 
was burnt among us&#63; and secondly&#44; that njan must 
not presume to rely on his own merits for justification&#44; 
nor to prescribe to himself how he will worship in

anglit which is not consoimnt with the revelation of 
God&#59; since we see that the same thing both purifies 
and defiles&#44; just as it pleases the Lord to ordain &#59; 
wherefore worship the inventioii of man is not ac&#8211; 
ceptable&#44; while the humblest offering commanded by 
God will secure us his favour. 

It hence follows that virtue and vice&#44; piety and 
wickedness&#44; are not regulated by what mortals may 
think these words do convey&#44; but by the sense in 
which they have been taught us in our belief. If 
then it is a claim in other religions that they operate 
on the mind by faith&#44; or a blind acquiescence in not&#8211; 
understood dogmas&#44; thus purifying the heart and ren&#8211; 
dering it subject unconditionally to the will of God &#58; 
our system requires an equal exercise of whatever is 
l&#94;ractically virtuous&#44; although no articles of creed are 
demanded of us in which our reason is blindly sur&#8211; 
rendered to the arbitrary interpretations of men on 
doctrinal points&#59; inasmuch as our religion daily and 
hourly furnishes us with practical works of piety&#44; in 
which we can be active with a submissive and meek 
spirit&#44; relying on the truth and mercy of Ilim who 
ordained them that lie would not teach us aught that 
is not true&#44; nor enjoin any thing which is not bene&#8211; 
ficial in its tendencies. There is a pleasing exhibi&#8211; 
tion of filial piety when a child obeys all the instruc&#8211; 
tion of its parent&#44; because it loves him&#44; and does not 
each time require a plain and palpable reason for the 
same before it resolves to act&#59; and this holds good 
likewise in our intercourse&#44; if we may so term it&#44; be&#8211; 
tween ourselves and the great Father of mankind&#44; 
when we are willing to obey and to fulfil his com&#8211; 
mandments from the simple motive that they are his

instructions&#44; and not merely that our reason has been 
satisfied about their ubsokite necessity to us or the 
world at large. On one thing we can always rely&#44; it 
the motive of any commandment is ever so unknown 
to us &#58; and it is&#44; that the more we are active in ob&#8211; 
serving religious duties&#44; the more purified will our 
feelings become&#59; the more readily will we have an 
absolute command of our passions&#44; and be able to 
conquer them whenever any opportunity to sin may 
present itself&#44; which a mere acquiescence in incom&#8211; 
prehensible dogmas never can effect. No one can 
demonstrate to us&#44; either by theory or example&#44; that 
a man was ever rendered better by believing in the 
most beautiful theory that ever was invented. One 
may dream away all his life&#44; yet not be a whit the 
better for all the most exalted contemplations which 
he may have indulged in without ceasing&#59; but it is 
eqtially impossible for one to be constantly engaged 
in checking his natural love for indulgence&#44; and meas&#8211; 
uring his conduct by a strict and determined rule of 
action without becoming a wiser and a better man. 
We will not seek for any arguments or examples to 
prove the first proposition &#59; but for the second&#44; as it 
concerns ourselves especially&#44; we may appeal to the 
events of our history for justification of every word 
which I have advanced. Many nations on being op&#8211; 
pressed or transplanted to other climates have sunk 
into apathy or been transformed into savages or bar&#8211; 
barians&#44; and this even among those who were never 
driven away from their country&#44; but in which they 
had been rendered subjects to foreign or domestic 
misrule. But look for one moment only on the pic&#8211; 
lure which we present to the admiring gaze of man&#8211;

wanderers even now amidst the burning sands of

prostrated more powerful and numerous nations than

this all derived &#63; Simply and solely from the force 
of the precepts which we have received&#44; which have

Brethren &#33; 

At this season of the year&#44; which has been devoted 
from the very commencement of our dispersion until 
now to the commemoration of what we suffered when 
our sins appealed against us&#44; &#8212; when our backsliding 
demanded almost our extermination &#8212; when it was 
merely the undeserved mercy of God which permitted 
a small remnant to escape the pestilence&#44; and the 
famine&#44; and the sword&#44; which slew our multitudes&#44; &#8212; 
at this season of our annual commemoration it is 
surely fitting to us&#44; as thinking men&#44; to dwell on the 
past and the future&#44; and to indulge in reflection&#44; be it 
ever so little&#44; on what we have been and what we 
may become again. It is illy in accordance with the 
cpialities of rational worshippers to let season after 
season pass by&#44; and to observe the fasts and ceremo&#8211; 
nies by rote merely&#44; without permitting them to have 
any farther influence on our character&#59; for if this 
were all that is needed&#44; it is evident from the charac&#8211; 
ter and writings of the prophets that they would not 
have sanctioned burdens in addition to the law on the 
people. But we know tliat the fasts were so sanc&#8211; 
tioned&#44; and that the great council of our nation con&#8211; 
firmed them at a later period&#44; and the people always 
acquiesced in them&#44; even when they were kindly 
treated&#44; and they kept alive the commemoration of 
Jerusalem at the height of earthly prosperity. It is 
therefore evident that to us also&#44; who live now free

from the fear of tyranny&#44; and in the equality under 
the law wuich this country enjoys&#44; there must be 
something significant in the season of mourning for 
the fall of our ancient state. Let it then be our study 
to trace some of the causes which should influence us 
to weep for Jerusalem when our joy is the highest&#44; 
nor to forget our ancient city when all around us 
smiles with pleasure and prosperity. 

My country &#33; 0&#44; my country &#33; is the exclamation 
of the patriot when&#44; exiled from his native land&#44; he 
recalls on distant shores the paternal roof which he 
may not hope to see again&#44; because of the tyrant that 
forbids his return. He dwells with a melancholy 
pleasure on the hills of its cluerished neighbourhood&#44; 
whcn&#8211;e as a child he used to play with the companions 
of his ciivly years. lie recalls his innocent sports&#44; his 
search for tlie wild berries and fruit of the pleasant 
valleys which surrounded his father&#39;s cottage&#44; and 
lives over again in the rapid flight of the imagination 
the years which have elapsed from liis cradled in&#8211; 
fancy to his now unhappy manhood&#59; and though the 
stranger&#39;s land be more fruitful than his&#44; &#8212; though he 
now quaffs in the fragrance which scents the gale&#44; 
odours unknown to his rugged clime &#58; he will disdain 
all the allurements of nature and art&#44; and sigh to be&#8211; 
hold once more the rugged fields and the barren land 
which he loves because there he drew his first breath 
&#8212; because there repose the bones of his cherished 
parents&#44; and there are hidden the ashes of one who 
had vowed to travel with him the varied road of life. 

Have we not as a nation also some recollections 
which carry us back to Palestine&#44; and for which no 
compensation obtained in other lands can repay us &#63;

What were we in our ancient land&#44; even wlien sufttii&#42;&#8211; 
ing at times the visitation due to our sins &#63; We were 
under the worst circumstances a united people&#44; having 
one country&#44; one law&#44; one destiny. When the teach&#8211; 
ers of righteousness arose among us&#44; they addressed 
not merely a small isolated congregation&#44; where the 
voice of admonition is rendered fruitless by the sur&#8211; 
rounding evil influences&#44; which stifle now among us 
all appeals to amendment&#59; but they called on a whole 
people&#44; on an entire race of believers&#44; and they poured 
forth such strains of eloquence as only such a pulpit 
as the entrance to the temple could elicit&#59; and they 
spoke in such terms of entreaty as only they could 
employ&#44; whose whole soul was bound up in the wel&#8211; 
fare of their nation. And in good truth&#44; it is not to 
be supposed that&#44; though they failed in arresting the 
degeneracy of their age&#44; they laboured entirely with&#8211; 
out eftect&#59; for they did oppose&#44; and with success&#44; the 
entire overthrow of the great fabric of the law &#59; they 
stemmed the overwhelming tide of gentile corruption 
which had seized on the men of Judahand the daugh&#8211; 
ters of Zion&#59; and to them we owe it that we were not 
lost in the whirlpool of heathenish profligacy&#44; and that 
there are left those whose mouth swear fealty to the 
Lord&#44; and in whose hearts his law is inly implanted 
to the moment of their death. It was owing to their 
teaching that we had the myriads of saints who prized 
nothing but the Creator and his law&#59; who loved 
Him with the ardent devotion of faithful children&#59; 
who saw nothing in all the cartli but a preparation for 
a better life &#59; and who hence were enabled to resign 
all&#44; life itself included&#44; the moment they believed that 
the sacrifice was demanded by the service of their

Maker&#44; whom they were ready to follow through tho 
gates of death into a glorious etoriiity&#44; so his word 
bid them advance on that road so beset with terror 
to common mortals. &#8212; And O &#33; when we lived in our 
own land&#44; and obeyed our own laws&#44; the villages 
three times every year poured forth all their male 
population&#44; and troop followed on troop to hie them&#8211; 
selves to the mountains of our Lord&#44; to worship the 
Father of all in the place chosen as his residence. 
There came the age&#8211;bowed man of a hundred years&#44; 
leaning on his staff because of the multitude of his 
days&#44; and by his side walked gaily the grandchild of 
the fourth generation&#59; the one once more to see the 
sanctuary of his God before his departure hence&#44; the 
other to be there for the first time amidst the faithful 
multitude &#59; and there came the shepherd who had 
left his flock in the desert &#59; and the merchant from 
the seashore&#44; and the farmer from the plains of Jez&#8211; 
reel&#44; and the labourer from his work&#8211;bench&#44; all eager 
to testify their reverence for the portion whvch they 
had received from the almighty Disposer of events&#44; 
and none was afraid because behind him were left his 
wealth and those dear to his heart&#44; without his arm 
to protect&#44; without his vigilance to watch over them &#59; 
in the full confidence that lie&#44; who had ordained for 
them to seek bis courts&#44; would not fail in his promise&#44; 
and not permit the sword to pass through the land&#44; 
nor sufler the wild beasts to injure the unprotected&#44; 
and to let the rain be given in its due season only&#44; 
not to come to destroy and to sweep away the labours 
of those who looked up to Ilim as their Sovereign&#44; 
their Lord&#44; their God. &#8212; And if there was a contest 
between neighbour and neighbour&#44; any unkindness

of feeling&#44; any estrangement between brother and 
brother&#44; where better than at the foot of the altar 
could peace be restored &#63; Who more fittingly than 
the priests of God could interpose to arrest enmity 
and restrain the angry strife &#63; &#8212; And between Israel&#8211; 
ite and Israelite there was no distinction &#58; we knew 
nothing of a nobility&#44; nothing of privileged classes&#59; 
all were servants alike to the Most High&#44; all were 
equals one to the other. Labour was the lot of all&#44; 
as all were the sons of mortality&#59; but no one was 
degraded by the handicraft he pursued &#59; and an ex&#8211; 
altation to the offices&#44; which the people were empow&#8211; 
ered to bestow&#44; did not render any one more than 
any of his brothers&#44; and he was bound by the same 
laws and regulations which were instituted for the 
government of the whole state&#44; and there was no im&#8211; 
munity for crime which the highest even might have 
committed. From the sanctuary&#44; therefore&#44; at the 
very season of the festivals&#44; proceeded then the stream 
of justice to all the land&#59; and there&#44; when all Israel 
appeared to worship the Lord&#44; were felt the benefits 
which result from equitable laws administered for the 
benefit of all&#44; by those who owed their elevation to 
their brother Israelites&#44; and with them feared the 
great Head of their common country. 

In such a state of things no one needed to dread 
the arm of power&#44; because of the religion he professed&#59; 
11&#94; one needed to plead any excuse for the profession 
of faith in the One God &#59; because this very belief was 
the foundation of his personal security&#44; and under it 
were contrived the laws which governed the land. 
And whilst our fathers hearkened to the instruction 
of the Lord&#44; they were blessed with peace and free&#8211;

dom&#44; with civil liberty and domestic tranquillity&#44;&#8212; 
to borrow the words of Scripture &#58; &#34; Judah and Israel 
were as numerous as the sand by the sea in multitude&#44; 
eating&#44; drinking&#44; and rejoicing.&#34; &#34;And Judah and 
Israel dwelt securely&#44; each under his own vine and 
under his fig&#8211;tree.&#34; Such a state might have endured 
up to our own days&#59; we might have expanded to the 
east&#44; to the west&#44; to the north&#44; and to the south&#44; cov&#8211; 
ering the face of the land with a united&#44; hajipy&#44; God&#8211; 
fearing race&#44; distinguished for refinement&#44; integrity&#44; 
knowledge&#44; and the pursuit of peace. Our silent ex&#8211; 
ample would have crushed tyranny and misrule&#44; and 
we would have chased away the worship of idols&#44; and 
banished superstition and false belief from all the 
places whither our fame would have reached. But 
we would be wise above the law&#59; we would be more 
intelligent and more free than the religion of Heaven 
permitted us &#59; we set up our judgment above the wis&#8211; 
dom of our Creator&#59; we sought license&#44; exemption 
from restraint &#59; and as we saw the nations of the earth 
act&#44; so did we endeavour to do likewise. Therefore 
it occurred&#44; that moral corruption took possession of 
our commonwealth &#59; our rulers did not govern in the 
fear of the Lord&#59; falseliood and vanity usurped the 
places of truth and virtue&#59; and with the increase of 
personal licentiousness and irreligion&#44; the more we 
became like the nations in our morals and thoughts&#58; 
the more had we to lament the decrease of enlighten&#8211; 
ment and personal freedom&#59; so that at first we were 
ruled by domestic tyrants&#44; who filled the streets of 
Jerusalem with blood and carnage&#44; and then we fell 
an easy prey to foreign invaders&#44; and the temple of 
the Lord&#44; which we prized for its fame&#44; splendour&#44;

and beauty&#44; as a national safeguard&#44; fell in tlie midst 
of the crasli of our state&#44; and with it vanished our 
independence&#44; our self&#8211;governing power&#44; our isolated 
position amidst the nations. And from the day that 
tlie flames encircled in their fury tlie dwelling of the 
great King&#44; the Lord of all the earth&#44; what unspeak&#8211; 
able horrors have not passed over our heads &#33; Speak 
of the sufferings of any people of which history gives 
us an account &#8212; but what are its sorrows compared to 
ours&#63; What are its trials in comparison with the 
hard fate of Israel &#63; Have famine&#44; the pestilence&#44; 
malignant diseases&#44; intestine warfare within&#44; the sword 
of the foemen without&#44; thinned the ranks of the hu&#8211; 
man family in any age&#44; in any country &#58; we are yet 
to learn that a parallel to the destruction of human 
life as witnessed among us&#44; not for one&#44; but for a long 
series of generations&#44; was ever discovered in the 
chronicles of another people. But not alone this &#59; for 
happier were those who died at once&#44; than were those 
who were reserved for the horrors of persecution&#44; 
which in a hundred varying forms was applied to 
us to make us swerve from the Lord. History may 
well be silent in details of what did befall Israel after 
their glory sunk&#59; for too deep a stain is affixed to 
human nature on account of the wanton outrages 
perpetrated against God&#39;s ancient people. Ay&#44; thus 
they styled us&#44; yea in mockery of our wo &#59; and still 
they hunted us like a partridge on the mountain&#44; out 
of mere sport to see the sufferings of the outcasts of 
Judah. And all this was done out of a false profes&#8211; 
sion of love for our future happiness&#44; as though the 
Lord had told them&#44; &#34; Go and destroy Israel.&#34; 

All this our prophets foresaw when they beheld the

ruins of our teniylo&#44; as the natural consequence of our 
sins&#59; and that with the disruption of our state there 
would be an end&#44; for a long time&#44; to our happiness 
and peace. And hence it was proper and consistent 
with our dependent state on the bounty of God&#44; to 
appoint days of commemoration&#44; which should be ob&#8211; 
served during the whole period in which the visita&#8211; 
tion is felt&#44; as days of penance before the Lord&#44; who 
will not forsake his people&#44; nor cast them off iu utter 
abhorrence. The Israelite&#44; by fasting then on tlie 
days set apart in the fourth&#44; fifth&#44; seventh&#44; and tenth 
months&#44; and which are intended to call to mind the 
progress in our downfall&#44; does not say that he is not 
a good citizen of the state in which he lives&#44; that he 
is not ready to contribute his all for its welfare&#59; but 
that he especially regrets that his own people are not 
now sovereign in their own land &#59; and that his relig&#8211; 
ion suffers&#44; and its followers endure all the hardships 
of a conquered people. He can freely mingle the 
character of a citizen&#44; true to his land&#44; and that of 
an Israelite faithful to his own race &#58; the two do not 
come in conflict&#44; unless there should be an enactment 
denumding a violation of his duty to God&#44; when 
nothing can absolve him from his first allegiance&#44; 
every consideration compelling him to know no man&#44; 
and no human mandate&#44; wlien it concerns that whirh 
our Father has taught us. And the saints of the 
Lord always acted so. In all that concerned the state 
they were strict followers of all the ordinances which 
afiected the other inhabitants&#59; but when a surrender 
of Judaism was asked&#44; they would at all times be 
found amount those who surrendered their lives rather 
than be untrue to the Lord of heaven and earth.

THE PAST AND FUTURE. 391 

There were men of this kind already in the time before 
our Bible canon was finally closed&#44; &#8212; I speak of Dan&#8211; 
iel&#44; Ilananiah&#44; Mishael&#44; and Azariah &#59; and after them 
there were found millions&#44; who embraced death&#44; as 
an honourable distinction&#44; to die for the faith which 
their Mhers had handed down to them &#59; and though 
they acquired no great renown on earth&#44; their deeds 
and sacrifices are recorded there&#44; where no forgetfal&#8211; 
ness will obliterate their memory. 

But some may say that tlie changes&#44; which have 
taken place in our political condition&#44; render the ob&#8211; 
servance of the fasts of no fixrther importance. Still 
if we take a more extensive view of the question than 
our merely personal benefit&#44; we shall come to a differ&#8211; 
ent conclusion. It is not only the political extinction 
of our state which we regret&#44; but also the little im&#8211; 
portance which our religion obtains in the eyes of 
mankind at large. Under the best circumstances in 
which we are found&#44; it cannot but be observed that 
we have a great drawback operating against us&#44; when 
compared with non&#8211;Israelites. There is attached to 
us a great degree of ill&#8211;will from the vast majority 
of mankind&#44; no matter what may be their religious 
opinions&#44; political views&#44; or country&#44; for no other 
reason than that we are not of them&#44; but a people 
different from all through our religion. Tell them&#44; 
and prove to them&#44; again and again&#44; that our interest 
in worldly matters is the same with theirs&#44; exhibit a 
character ever so pure and philanthropic&#44; prove your&#8211; 
selves as elevated as possible above all mean sectarian 
feelings and exclusive prejudices&#58; still you will never 
succeed in disarming the world of their prepossession 
against us. It is after all the Jew that is l&#41;efore them&#44;

and they love him not as they love others&#44; tliough the 
respective persons ditier in the widest manner from 
each other in all speculative opinions. It is perhaps 
unaccountable that this has been so among liomans&#44; 
Grecians&#44; Egyptians&#44; and Persians&#44; who were hea&#8211; 
thens&#44; and among modern Nazarenes&#44; and Mahom&#8211; 
cdans&#59; but the fact cannot be denied&#59; and I say&#44; do 
what you may&#44; cringe to the public as much as you 
will&#44; and change your ideas to appearance as often as 
you please to gratify the public prejudice&#58; and still 
your original character will obstinately adhere to you&#44; 
and you will even as apostates bear the opprobrium 
which attaches to you as descendants of Jacob. It 
is indeed a providential dispensation that this repul&#8211; 
sion should exiet against us &#59; as it is well calculated 
to draw the scattered remnants in bonds of love to 
each other&#44; and to make them fly to a mutual protec&#8211; 
tion as soon as a community of descent becomes re&#8211; 
vealed to otherwise strange and distant individuals&#59; 
and that Jew has j&#8211;et to be born&#44; who&#44; let his conduct 
be what it may&#44; does not feel deep regret Avhen hear&#8211; 
ing the oppressions to which we are constantly ex&#8211; 
posed&#44; in all stages of the progress of society. Let 
me not be told that I overcharge the picture of the 
evils of our position. Look at the history of the 
present day&#44; when nations are awakening to their 
political vassalage&#58; and still you will discover that in 
every direction&#44; whilst freedom is accorded to us in 
law&#44; many enormities are practised against us&#44; result&#8211; 
ing from the inveterate prejudice to which we are 
subject. Whether this &#94;vill ever be ciianged&#44; it is not 
within the power of man to determine&#59; but that it 
exists now&#44; no one can deny. Even take the most 

<pb n="393"/>

THE PAST AND FUTURE. 393 

favourable view of the case &#58; still the number of us 
who enjoy a comparative state of freedom is small 
indeed&#44; when viewed against the millions who merely 
breathe by the sufferance of tyrants and despots&#44; and 
to whom the horrors of a constant dread of persecu&#8211; 
tion are familiar as matters of daily occurrence. Does 
this prove that we need not weep for the past&#44; or look 
with hope to the bright future &#63; I speak of the bright 
future &#59; because to my mind there is no doubt of its 
coming. It is not a brighter&#44; freer state&#44; by the suf&#8211; 
ferance of the powers which now divide the earth 
among them&#44; which I expect&#59; but that very state of 
glory of which the prophets speak with one voice&#44; 
with a unanimity and precision which can leave no 
doubt on the mind of a believer. It is not that we 
who hope thus do not sympathize with the progress 
of freedom&#44; that we do not rejoice whenever a single 
shackle is removed from the chain which binds Israel&#44; 
and which enslaves the world at large. JSIay it please 
our Father to extend freedom more and more&#44; till the 
name of oppression and tyrant be forgotten. Butwc 
hope for something especial&#44; notwithstanding&#59; for a 
spiritual regeneration of the world&#44; through means 
of the restored Israelites&#44; &#8212; the Israelites&#44; no longer 
scattered in every corner&#44; ruled over by every tongue 
and people&#44; but united again under one head&#44; over&#8211; 
shadowed by the laws which erst Moses received on 
Sinai. It is for Zion&#39;s glory that we pray &#59; it is for 
the temple rebuilt in splendour that we turn our eyes 
to God in prayer. We feel that we are destined to a 
bright end&#44; that future in which our sun will not set&#44; 
in which our moon will not wane&#59; that period in 
which the profession of our faith will not subject us 

<pb n="394"/>

394 THE PAST AND FUTURE. 

to any loss or suspicion from antagonizing creeds 
and systems&#59; that era when universal freedom shall 
spring&#44; not from grants of kings or the tumults of 
the nations&#44; but from the pure knowledge of the Name 
of the Lord which shall pervade every breast&#59; when 
from sincere love&#44; a newly kindled affection for the 
Most High&#44; each man will cease from injuring his 
neighbour&#44; and from forging fetters to keep him in 
subjection &#59; when peace and the covenant of mercy 
will bind heart to heart&#44; and tears of anguish at a 
brother&#39;s wrong will be shed no more. 

But till this end comes&#44; it well behoves us to weep 
for the glory&#34; of Israel which has been dimmed&#44; and 
for the children of our God who have fallen by the 
sword. Again I say&#44; you are not the less attached to 
the state by so doing&#59; but only by duly honouring 
your faith&#44; by being deeply imbued with your relig&#8211; 
ions obligations&#44; can you be induced to render obedi&#8211; 
ence to the duties which devolve on you as citizens. 
There is no other appeal&#44; unless it be the threat of 
physical force&#44; which can otherwise be addressed to 
you to make you kind to your neighbours of all per&#8211; 
Huasions&#44; and it is to be hoped that you will have a 
nobler incentive to do what is demanded from you&#44; 
and this is a sense of datu &#59; and this again is founded 
only on religious conviction. The glory of Israel 
never yet militated against the peace of the world. 
If our religion flourishes&#44; if our state is triumphant&#44;

are to be the pioneers of the regeneration of man &#59; 
liow &#63; will be shown when the fulfihiient draws umh. 
In the mean time let us cherish the memory of our 
fallen state&#59; let us love our religion&#59; let us defend 
with firmness the legacy which we have obtained&#59; let 
us also love one another&#44; listen with charity to the 
cry of distress from all men&#44; but especially of our 
fellow&#8211;Israelites&#59; and let our whole conduct be such 
that it may be a beautiful commentary on the truth 
of our religion. So shall the word of the prophet be 
fulfilled&#44; that unrighteousness shall be purged from 
our midst through the ordeal of fire to which we have 
been subjected&#44; and then&#44; 

&#34;Zion will be redeemed through justice&#44; and those who return 
in her through righteousness.&#34; Isaiah i. 27. 

And thus shall he behold the kingdom of the son 
of David&#44; when we shall no more weep for our sor&#8211; 
rows&#44; but rejoice everlastiugly at the renewed mercy 
of the Lord. Amen.

Note. &#8212; The doctrine of the restoration&#44; through a lineal descend&#8211; 
ant from David&#44; the King Messiah&#44; is to my mind the one most im&#8211; 
portant after the cardinal principles based on the belief in God&#44; and 
the belief in the revelation. The state of mankind is one of war&#8211; 
fare &#59; that of Israel one of suffering &#59; and change the ideas as you 
will&#44; assert what you will&#59; you cannot convince me or any sound 
reasoning person&#44; tliat Christianity and civilization&#44; philosophy and 
jirogress&#44; have resulted in anything else than leaving the moral 
world as it was many centuries ago&#44; when the earth was governed 
by rules less elevated&#44; in the opinion of those who claim everything 
for modern times. &#34; Glory to God in the highest&#44; and on earth 
peace&#44; good&#8211;will toward men &#34; is said to have been the song of

angels when the founder of Christianity first saw the light&#59; hut 
has tlie fulfilment ever taken place up to this moment&#63; has not 
every step the new religion has made in its progress over the earth&#44; 
been marked by blood and violence&#63; did not the sword always 
force the way for the missionaries of glad tidings &#63; yes&#44; even in 
the present day&#63; Look at Otahiti&#44; Algiers&#44; China&#44; India&#44; yes&#44; the 
western prairies of America&#44; and how has Christianity penetrated 
into them &#63; Was it the olive&#8211;branch of peace&#44; or the prancing war&#8211; 
steed&#44; the thundering cannon&#44; the ship of war&#44; the flashing steel &#63; 
Let history answer&#44; and the assumption must be confounded with&#8211; 
out farther argument. Still the prophets speak of a reign of peace&#44; 
under a leader whom God will raise up as his standard&#8211;bearer 
&#40;Isaiah xi. 9&#44; 10&#41; &#59; and shall we think that this will not be &#63; AVhence 
do the flatterers of gentile opinions draw their warrant that the 
Son of David shall not come&#63; Let them wrest Scripture as they 
please &#59; but unless they totally deny all religion&#44; the truth of all in&#8211; 
spiration&#44; the words of the prophet as they stand without note or 
comment must compel them to be silent&#44; compel them to confess 
that they have taught falsely in the name of the Lord. There is 
but one thing true in the world&#44; and that is the word of God &#59; hence 
all the innovations of modern times&#44; which teach us to look for the 
fulfilment of the good to Israel in the progress of liberal ideas&#44; are 
the essence of error and departure from God. It may to some look 
like incimsm to hope for a renovation of human society upon a bet&#8211; 
ter platform than has yd been witnessed on earth &#59; but irrespective 
of its being foolish to flatter the present governments by professing 
an uncalled&#8211;for admiration&#44; the very progress of ideas which these 
men claim as the highest to be expected political good&#44; presupposes a 
destruction of the present forms of government. But we have suf&#8211; 
fered so much under every form of rule and exclusion among all na&#8211; 
tions&#44; that our neighbours must beshoeked at our hypocrisy&#44; when wo 
jirofess to hope for all the prophets promise us through their agency. 
It is absurd to maintain such notions&#44; and they never can gain us&#44; 
moreover&#44; the favour of the intelligent gentiles. How much nobler 
will it be&#44; then&#44; if we all boldly avow our belief as we have received 
it&#44; and really act so as to challenge the admiration of mankind by 
our religious and moral demeanour. Our hopes should inspire us 
with rectitude&#44; and then only can we look forward to the accom&#8211; 
plishment of the good which God has foretold for Israel.
