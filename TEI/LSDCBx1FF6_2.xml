I thank you for your kind in<lb/>quiry about my health&#44; which I thank God is very good &#38; were it<lb/> not that in going to town in the morning I find Passengers overtake<lb/> &#38; pass me I should not be conscious of the lapse of the last 20 or 30<lb/> years at which time my usual pace kept me ahead of those<lb/> who set off at the same time indeed I have reason to be &#38; am<lb/> grateful for the health I enjoy I think shortly after the<lb/> dispatch of your letter you must have received one of mine written<lb/> in bed last in which I <sic>inclosed</sic> a copy of some <add>&#63;</add><lb/> addressed on <persName>Dr McCourt</persName> on some lectures which he had published<lb/> I do not know whether they would be of any use for your Occident<lb/> I hope you do not make any compliment with me I have already<add>&#63;</add><lb/> explained my feeling with respect to <sic>censhorship</sic> if what I<lb/> had written can be useful I feel pleasure in its being published<lb/> I wish to be treated with candour which will to me be a proof of<lb/> your friendship You are no doubt aware of the great loss<lb/> which our nation has suffered by the death of <persName>Mr H Belasstro</persName><lb/> the panegyrics which have been made on him in the daily &#38;</p>

			<p>garded. a pretty mess that gentleman made of his Faithful missionary<lb/> I think his Prospectus was enough to underserve any one who supposed he<lb/> could execute one quarter of what he proposed yet I am told he is<lb/> an accomplished Hebrew Scholar. there was another gentleman who<lb/> was to do wonders who called on me for Subscription to a work on<lb/> Chronology which has never made its appearance he also was a<lb/> very learned young man. I do not know whether it is from the apathy<lb/> of the nation or from these learned gentlemen being able to apply their<lb/> knowledge to any practical purpose by very little of any advantage has<lb/> accrued from their abilities 30 <add>&#63;</add> on Saturday I paid a visit</p>

I think she has neglected<lb/> me I heartily hope you will be able to rouse our yankee Brothers<lb/> &#38; that they will have the good sense to place you at the head of the move<lb/>ment&#44; a place you are so eminently qualified to occupy but I fear there<lb/> is very little to be done with the present Generation. Our Christian Bro<lb/>thers talk of the signs of the time &#38; the near approach of the period of<lb/> our restoration but without for a moment doubting the full accomplish<lb/>ment of the glorious promises made to us I can see very little prospect<lb/> of the near approach of our long deferred restoration nor do I think<lb/> that it can be accelerated by any human efforts. all we can do is to improve<lb/> our moral &#38; Intellectual condition that we may be more worthy of the<lb/> blessings when we receive them When you have a few minutes <add>&#63;</add><lb/> passages you will bestow them on me as your letters always afford me much<lb/> pleasure Wishing you a continuance of healthy happiness I remain Sir</p>
