                                        write more fully when I send you a Sermon yesterday.<lb/> In
                                        frimis[?]–I had made up my mind not to send again<lb/> a

                                        more induced to determine this, since you did not<lb/> even

                                        acknowledge, I have<lb/> been somewhat amiss in not having
                                        sent you the<lb/> article I promised but this has arisen
                                        from an<lb/> unavoidable circumstance, viz. The
                                        necessity<lb/> of referring to a rather source work which
                                        it<lb/> is impossible for me to see in

                                        make amends, I sent you a Sermon<lb/> and as I wished to

                                        copied as possible, as I was told<lb/> at the Post Office
                                        that the American mail was<lb/> just about being closed I
                                        thought it better to<lb/> send it you on without delaying a
                                        day, as you<lb/> might then be able to insert it your
