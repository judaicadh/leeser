                              <p>Peace and well-being to my dear sir,</p>
                              <p rend="indent(1)">Please be good enough to forgive my intrusion,
                                        that I burden<lb/> you with my letters, even though this
                                        matter is of no practical value to you<lb/> I write simply
                                        to defend myself against you and to justify myself in<lb/>
                                        view of the fact that in this matter I am completely
                                                  unhampered<add>?</add>, since I can per<lb/>form
                                        marriages without the permission of a representative of the congregation<lb/>
                                        <persName>Mr. Cohen</persName> came to me and asked that I
                                        should perform the marriage<lb/> ceremony for him. He told
                                        me that his bride was a proselyte. She<lb/> had been
                                        proselytized in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, and
                                        was, therefore, compelled<lb/> to remain unmarried until the
                                        first of <date>April</date>. It seemed pecu<lb/>liar to the
                                        gentiles that the woman should remain in a separate<lb/>
                                        room. Therefore, he wanted to settle the matter as soon as
                                        possible. I<lb/> asked him whether his bride had a document
                                        about this and he<lb/> told me that he had forgotten to
                                        bring it along, and that I<lb/> could believe him, upon his
                                        honor, that she was a proselyte,<lb/> that he could get it
                                        from <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> at any time, also
                                        that <persName>Mr<lb/> Cohen</persName> had
                                                  <add>enjoyed</add> a great deal of confidence in
                                                  <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> since he
                                        has<lb/> been a preacher. I, therefore, reposed the same
                                        confidence in him and<lb/> took his word for it. There is
                                        one other consideration—that <persName>Mr.<lb/>
                                                  Cohen</persName> had at one time married her among
                                        the gentiles and had<lb/> therefore kept he and had lived
                                        with her contrary to law. Since<lb/> she was satisfied to
                                        live as a Jewess and, as she said that, if <persName>Mr.
                                                  Cohen</persName><lb/> would let her live according
                                        to Jewish law, she would do so with the<lb/> greatest
                                        pleasure and try to act accordingly, it would be better
                                        that<lb/> she should have a Jewish marriage performed. In
                                        such a case,<lb/> if they had children, they would be called
                                        Jewish children. Let<lb/> there at least be the descendants
                                        of parents who had been properly<lb/> married. As in the
                                        case of <persName>Joseph</persName>, who said to
                                                  <persName>Jacob</persName>, our father,<lb/> *

                                        <persName>Jacob</persName> the document of a Jewish
                                        marriage. We do not find that he had<lb/> made them
                                        proselytes, for we find that they were already the
                                        proselytes.<lb/> That is what is written in the case of our
