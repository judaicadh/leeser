			<p>Peace and well&#45;being to my dear sir&#44;</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">Please be good enough to forgive my intrusion&#44; that I burden<lb/> you with my letters&#44; even though this matter is of no practical value to you<lb/> I write simply to defend myself against you and to justify myself in<lb/> view of the fact that in this matter I am completely unhampered<add>&#63;</add>&#44; since I can per<lb/>form marriages without the permission of a representative of the congregation<lb/> <persName>Mr. Cohen</persName> came to me and asked that I should perform the marriage<lb/> ceremony for him.  He told me that his bride was a proselyte.  She<lb/> had been proselytized in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>&#44; and was&#44; therefore&#44; compelled<lb/> to remain unmarried until the first of <date>April</date>.  It seemed pecu<lb/>liar to the gentiles that the woman should remain in a separate<lb/> room.  Therefore&#44; he wanted to settle the matter as soon as possible.  I<lb/> asked him whether his bride had a document about this and he<lb/> told me that he had forgotten to bring it along&#44; and that I<lb/> could believe him&#44; upon his honor&#44; that she was a proselyte&#44;<lb/> that he could get it from <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> at any time&#44; also that <persName>Mr<lb/> Cohen</persName> had <add>enjoyed</add> a great deal of confidence in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> since he has<lb/> been a preacher.  I&#44; therefore&#44; reposed the same confidence in him and<lb/> took his word for it.  There is one other consideration&#8212;that <persName>Mr.<lb/> Cohen</persName> had at one time married her among the gentiles and had<lb/> therefore kept he and had lived with her contrary to law.  Since<lb/> she was satisfied to live as a Jewess and&#44; as she said that&#44; if <persName>Mr. Cohen</persName><lb/> would let her live according to Jewish law&#44; she would do so with the<lb/> greatest pleasure and try to act accordingly&#44; it would be better that<lb/> she should have a Jewish marriage performed.  In such a case&#44;<lb/> if they had children&#44; they would be called Jewish children.  Let<lb/> there at least be the descendants of parents who had been properly<lb/> married.  As in the case of <persName>Joseph</persName>&#44; who said to <persName>Jacob</persName>&#44; our father&#44;<lb/> &#42; &#8220;Whom God had given me here&#8221;&#44; <persName>Rashi</persName> says&#44; that <persName>Joseph</persName> had shown<lb/> <persName>Jacob</persName> the document of a Jewish marriage.  We do not find that he had<lb/> made them proselytes&#44; for we find that they were already the proselytes.<lb/>  That is what is written in the case of our father&#44; <persName>Abraham</persName>.  &#8220;And the &#42;&#42;<lb/> souls which they made in Haran&#8221; and <persName>Rashi</persName> says&#44; &#8220;<persName>Abraham</persName> used to<lb/> proselytize the men&#44; and <persName>Sarah</persName>&#44; the women&#8221;.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">Aside from this&#44; I have nothing more to write to you.  I hope you<lb/> will not take it amiss that I burden you with my writing</p>
          <p rend="indent(3)"> I remain&#44; your most devoted servant&#44;</p>
