            <p rend="indent(3)">My brother in law <persName>Rev. A. P. Mendes</persName> of<lb/>
                <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> calls my attention in a letter received from
                him<lb/> yesterday to the fact that <persName>Dr Wise</persName> of
                    <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName> accuses<lb/> him most wrongfully of plagiarism
                in a sermon called<lb/> “The Perpetual Light” preached by <persName>Mr.
                    M.</persName> in <placeName>London</placeName> and<lb/> continues “I have
                addressed myself to <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> to whom I have<lb/> written a
                letter for publication in the Occident and have also<lb/> sent my sermon claimed by
                this <persName>Wise</persName>, for publication in<lb/> his pages. I do not know
                whether he will oblige me with the<lb/> space solicited as I have not the pleasure
                to be known to him.<lb/> Will you oblige me by using your influence with him to
                procure<lb/> for my request his kind consideration?” At <persName>Mr M's</persName>
                expression<lb/> “all my influence with you” I could but smile. I regretted<lb/>
                however that though misconception he should have written<lb/> to the last person
                competent to do him a service with you in<lb/> the matter. Fortunately for him his
                case (in my humble,<lb/> estimation) is one that recommends itself by its own
                merits.<lb/> Though I believe too much is made of the affair on both sides<lb/> yet
                some texts (and God forbid there should be a monopoly<lb/> of Scripture) and even
                identical ideas do not warrant the<lb/> harsh term plagiarism. I have not seen
                    <persName>Mr M's</persName> sermon<lb/> (and therefore my name must not appear
                in this controversy<lb/> as yet,) but (I am pretty sure from my intimate
                knowledge)<lb/> of him his abilities &amp; (principles that he would not stoop</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>to the plagiarism of which he is accused. Now, my dear Sir, although<lb/> I cannot
                “use any influence with you to procure for <persName>M's</persName> request<lb/>
                your kind consideration” still I will venture to represent to you<lb/> that as
                    <persName>Mr Mendes</persName> considers himself <hi rend="underline"
                    >wrongfully</hi> accused<lb/> of no trifling thing, and as you have in the pages
                of the Occident<lb/> declared your willingness to give them to any defense of
                the<lb/> Jewish Ministry when wrongfully accused—and as <persName>Mr
                M's</persName><lb/> reputation (and perhaps even to some extent his usefulness<lb/>
                may be endangered were the charge of literary <hi rend="underline">theft</hi>
                not<lb/> immediately refuted—your own charity shown in cases<lb/> somewhat similar
                will induce you to give <persName>Mr M</persName>, an<lb/> opportunity of being
                heard in his <sic>defence</sic>. I do not urge the many<lb/> considerations which
                occur to me &amp; which would have the effect<lb/> of entitling your sympathy in his
                cause for I do not wish nor have<lb/> I time to trouble you with a longer letter,
                but they will very<lb/>—much more—readily occur to you.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Will you oblige me with a line at your convenience to<lb/> inform me
                definitely whether you are willing or decline to<lb/> with the joint publication of
