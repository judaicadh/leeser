            <p>My Dear Sir,</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I am almost ashamed to address you in<lb/> reply to yours of such an
                early date, but, believe me<lb/> sir, it is from no want of regard for your kind
                attention<lb/> to me, neither is it from any disrespect to your correspon<lb/>dence,
                far from it, for, although personally unacquainted<lb/> yet, from the tenor of your
                letters, I feel satisfied, I could<lb/> too esteem you as a friend, and I have no
                doubt that<lb/> the reasons I assign for my delay, will be ample apology<lb/> for
                not replying to you at an earlier period, firstly,<lb/> I had to make preparations
                in my school for a public<lb/> &amp; private examination, in which I am sure
                you<lb/> will sympathize with me, (I have sent you the whole<lb/> particulars for
                insertion in your Occident,) secondly,<lb/> though not least, I had to complete
                arrangements for<lb/> my union with <persName>Mr. Sarfaty's</persName> daughter,
                this completed<lb/> I will devote myself to your service. Should you feel<lb/>
                disposed to appoint me your Agent, I shall most<lb/> readily render my aid in order
                to forward your in-<lb/>terests, but I fear, as the state of things are, you
                must<lb/> not expect great progress, as to all appearance we<lb/> are in a fallen
                state, and very likely a just retribution<lb/> for the well known immorality
                    <sic>practised</sic> here<lb/>
                <add>Hebrew</add> I hear of no other country with<lb/> so little hope of success as
                    <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, the veil of <sic>dispair</sic><lb/> seems to
                overshadow us, and a gloom hovers over<lb/> us, threatening the approach of some
                impending<lb/> evil. I have been here about 9 years, but I have<lb/> not known
                things to bear such a fearful aspect<lb/> as at present, 'tis true it affects me
                little, but every<lb/> thing sooner or later must have its turn, and I fear<lb/> the
                future, I will at any rate do my best for you</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>let me know the state of your affairs in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>,<lb/> and
                order to be handed over to me such Books<lb/> as you have in the possession of other
                persons, I obtained<lb/> a Subscriber for you, and would have obtained more,
                had<lb/> I been in possession of your authority, this was merely<lb/> in
                conversation with <persName>Mr. Phenias Bravo</persName> on your<lb/> letter to
                    <persName>Mr. Jacobs</persName>, which was the gem of the day<lb/> in
                    <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, I went up at <persName>Sollas'</persName> my
                brother in law, to<lb/> operate at his child's b<add>Hebrew</add> and he was
                delighted with<lb/> it, I think it a good incentive to your getting
                sub-<lb/>scribers, but you must know more or less that we<lb/> have very few
                literary characters here. I thank<lb/> you for the numbers you have sent me
                gratuitously</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Miss Peixotto</persName> handed me your last<lb/>
                correspondence enclosed in hers, when she was ex-<lb/>ceedingly ill, and indeed not
                expected to live, she<lb/> has since recovered, and wrote a letter in reply<lb/> to
                yours but not living in <placeName>Kingston</placeName> she left it at<lb/> her
                brother's residence in <placeName>Spanish Town</placeName>, so<lb/> therefore she
                has been unable to address you by<lb/> this conveyance. I have taken the
