          <p rend="indent(4)">I became quite disappointed on<lb/> <date>Monday</date> last when the American letters were delivered and none for me&#44; but this<lb/> disappointment was soon settled on the <date>Tuesday</date> when your <date>28th Shebat</date> was sent<lb/> to me by so me unknown person&#44; notwithstanding <add>Hebrew</add> I <sic>loose</sic> no time to reply<lb/> as your case is at heart <add>Hebrew</add> of my pure sincerity and zeal&#44; for there was<lb/> one <hi rend="underline">only</hi> &#40;whom I knew&#41; in the field my own dear nephew when I first wrote to you&#44; still<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> on behalf of a man of your high value in the literary world&#44; not<lb/> once&#44; twice&#44; or trice&#44; did I express it by writing to my friends in <persName>Abrahams</persName> of <placeName>N&#58; York</placeName>&#44; <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> that notwithstanding all the Revd you have imported from <placeName>England</placeName> &#38; other parts <add>&#63;</add><lb/> Revd <hi rend="underline">Drs</hi> <add>Hebrew</add> and <persName>Isaac Leeser</persName> <add>Hebrew</add> let us then consider the number of<lb/> years <add>Hebrew</add> what shall I denominate your opponents there <add>Hebrew</add> I am quite<lb/> surprised of <persName>Mr. Harts</persName> conduct towards you and myself as well&#44; as he might have had<lb/> the common civility of acknowledging my important letter even should he be not desirous<lb/> of interfering&#59; you say unless &#8220;I was charged with keeping the subject a secret.&#8221; No&#8212;<lb/> I shall say to you <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; you should in <hi rend="underline">confidence</hi> know all but to this day<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> I shall address him a few lines which you will be pleased to seal<lb/> Now for business&#8212;I am fully persuaded of your honor &#38; integrity&#44; I am never<lb/> afraid of what I write&#44; but where I am friendly to a person I do not wish him<lb/> to have the least surmise of my being the author&#44; for it is only meant as information<lb/> to an honorable friend as yourself.<lb/> therefore if my name is not mentioned in any way I care not&#8212;so whatever I am<lb/> to state to you let it be in the <hi rend="underline">most secrecy and confidence</hi>. At last <persName>Mr.<lb/> Morais</persName> opened his mind to me this 10 days past&#44; which I really was surprised at<lb/> his behavior of not giving me the least information before&#44; or taking my advice&#44; all the place<lb/> and every one knowing it after the pretended friendship and my corresponding it&#44; moreso<lb/> as he was <sic>reccomended</sic> to me from his master when he first came here and he being <add>&#63;</add><lb/> convinced that my behavior to him was as a father&#8212;however he has full cleared<lb/> himself and he is not in the least culpable since he could not say any thing about it</p>

			<p>about it until he had a reply&#44; it is about a fortnight &#40;that is after 3 months&#41; he recd a letter<lb/> from <persName>Mr. H.</persName> stating all the particulars and the duties&#44; and he might <hi rend="underline">take his chance</hi><lb/> which letter he read part to me&#44; and that made him then take the resolution to go&#44; he is<lb/> now preparing and I am almost sure that some part last week or beginning of the one after<lb/> he sets off to steam to his destiny&#44; it something surprised me <persName>Mr. H</persName>&#58; letter wherein he<lb/> says that they do not require regular lectures but as they have been accustomed by the<lb/> lost <add>Hebrew</add> they expect him occasionally to give one or something like it&#8212;it was on that point which<lb/> caused me to write to you in my last concerning him&#44; for after you <sic>deliverd</sic> sermons in<lb/> that place which the whole world must confess that you are almost <add>Hebrew</add> without any<lb/> flattery&#44; how could they reconcile to hear from a foreign gangman<add>&#63;</add> who is just learning<lb/> the language and above all has not the least notion of lecturing nor he assumes it&#44; he has lectured 3 or 4<lb/> times in the school as an attempt who is the author of them&#63; That is better known&#33; the<lb/> method how he came to apply for the situation he acquainted me was thus&#44; a Female a<lb/> <persName>Mrs Levi</persName> from your place was on <add>Hebrew</add> at our synagogue and heard <persName>Mr. M.</persName> make<lb/> some <add>Hebrew</add> which the schoolmasters perform. She sent for him the day after and said if he would allow her she would<lb/> obtain him the situation she would write as she thought he would do&#44; and <add>&#63;</add> that she<lb/> was fully commissioned to look out for one&#44; he and her managed the affair for some<lb/> time secretly&#8212;but his finding no immediate answer of his being accepted&#44; things came<lb/> out and public&#44; when I heard of such a female being here&#44; I took the opportunity<lb/> of calling upon her with my card and presented her with one of my sermons. I was<lb/> so eager to serve you that I wished to know how matters stood and if there were no ways<lb/> or method of reconciling affairs with such a great man as <persName>Leeser</persName>&#44; she received me<lb/> in such a way&#44; replied so short and abruptly&#44; far from a Lady&#44; therefore I styled her to<lb/> you a <hi rend="underline">Female</hi>&#44; I quitted and never returned&#44; <sic>than</sic> I resolved to write so far how affairs<lb/> stood. I have not nor shall fail to speak to <persName>Mr. M</persName> since he has behaved friendly as<lb/> it was his duty so to do&#59; to hesitate &#38; give him the full description of the congregation&#44; but you<lb/> must know that he flatters himself <hi rend="underline">safe</hi> and <hi rend="underline">sure</hi> to be elected as he hears there are<lb/> <hi rend="underline">only 2 Germans</hi> who are candidates and he stands the best chance with them&#44; as<lb/> he has a strong voice&#8212;not harmonious nor musical&#44; he has a very poor family at<lb/> <placeName>Leghorn</placeName> &#40;my country&#41; he wants to do the best for them <hi rend="underline">that is his object</hi>&#44; he is a good<lb/> hebrew teacher for <sic>beginers</sic> such as the Bible &#38; translation &#38; grammar and God only<lb/> knows how all this may suit your congregation and his sermons should be ordered to treat on<lb/> a particular point. I think I have given you a full account and information of<lb/> all particulars. I believe <persName>Mr. M</persName> would succeed and do well in a school if there are<lb/> no other masters there competent to teach hebrew Grammar. I did not hesitate<lb/> to mention it to <persName>Mr DeSolla</persName> that which you stated&#44; his reply was&#44; &#8220;<hi rend="underline">if you examine</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">dates you will find that</hi> you had already given it up&#44;&#8221; so your complaint<lb/> must fall with the other candidates as well.&#8221; I shall not fail of writing my nephews<lb/> my sentiments&#8212;no one should have been too hasty about it after the number of years<lb/> you served the congregation <add>Hebrew</add> you will excuse my troubling you with such</p>

			<p>a long letter but perhaps all the information may be of some use to you&#44; but earnestly<lb/> <sic>reccomending</sic> confidence as <persName>M</persName> is a good young man and friend. Again let me intreat<lb/> you to give in a little&#44; reconcile matters&#44; <sic>dont</sic> let it be said <add>Hebrew</add> give<lb/> in in that which may be consistent we are all over and in all places <add>Hebrew</add> I trust<lb/> that you will hearken to my humble <add>Hebrew</add> and I shall have the felicity to hear that by such<lb/> all is <hi rend="underline">peace</hi>&#44; it afforded me much satisfaction to read in this days Chronicle of the<lb/> resolution of the <date>13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> January</date> in your praise. <persName>Sir Moses</persName> at present he is for moments<lb/> here but as soon &#40;which will be very shortly&#41; as he remains in town for a day or<lb/> two I shall forward your literary undertaking and in any other way I can<lb/> serve you command the <add>Hebrew</add>&#8212;pray please in your reply to explain two points<lb/> which I did not rightly understand wherein you say <hi rend="underline">such as speaking of my manner</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">of reading the service</hi>.&#8221; and the passage you say &#8220;His intention to apply were made<lb/> known through other channel.&#8221; favour me with a little <add>Hebrew</add> I fully expect your<lb/> answer in full and how matters stand I do not care for Postage or <sic>expence</sic> to serve<lb/> a friend&#8212;it is rather strange that <persName>Mr. H</persName> is not very punctual to reply&#58; <persName>M</persName>&#58; told<lb/> me it was many and many weeks. he talks of going to <placeName>Liverpool</placeName> next <date>Thursday</date><lb/></p>

			<p>A who was this channel.</p>
			<p>You certainly must excuse the writing<lb/> interlines &#38;c. the fog is so dense this<lb/> morning&#8212;my sight far from the best<lb/> and was determined to reply at once<lb/> had I time I should transcribe it again</p>
