                                        occasionally to give one or something like it—it was on that

                                        the language and above all has not the least notion of

                                        perform. She sent for him the day after and said if he would

                                        write as she thought he would do, and <add>?</add> that
                                        she<lb/> was fully commissioned to look out for one, he and

                                        came<lb/> out and public, when I heard of such a female
                                        being here, I took the opportunity<lb/> of calling upon her
                                        with my card and presented her with one of my sermons. I
                                        was<lb/> so eager to serve you that I wished to know how
                                        matters stood and if there were no ways<lb/> or method of

                                                  <persName>Leeser</persName>, she received me<lb/>

                                        you<lb/> must know that he flatters himself <hi
