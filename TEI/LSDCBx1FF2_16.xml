                                        the least, for I could no otherwise expect from one who<lb/>

                                        the congregation, but let us reason. Is it done with
                                        that<lb/> motive? Or is it perhaps done because out of
                                                  <sic>innocense</sic> I'll say, out of<lb/>
                                        arrogance, or convenience? May be the intention of the

                                        and in these<lb/> cases instead of denying him the honor. I
                                        for my part would<lb/> allow it to him since it can not hurt
                                        me. Excuse my Liberty<lb/> Sir! I do not pretend to dictate
