				<p>&#8220;Man cannot be established by wickedness&#8221; &#40;Proverbs XII. 3&#41;</p>
				<p>My friends&#33;  The present is not a season for recriminations.  I will not administer now<lb/>  the scathing rebuke which they will deserve who in their political harangues have<lb/> dispersed<add>&#63;</add> the fair name of <placeName>Israel</placeName>.  Were I ever inclined to analyze at the bar of your<lb/> impartial opinion individuals who abused their positions by conjuring up the demoniac<lb/> Hurt of prejudice against my people&#44; I would be restrained by the magnanimous crumple<lb/> of our chief Executive.  He&#44; than whom none could be more vilified by his opponents&#44;<lb/> appeals to God as a witness&#44; that animosity does not rankle in his breast.<lb/>  Yes&#44; I will say it with the ancient moralist &#8220;Hatred stirreth up strife&#44; but love<lb/> covereth all sins&#8221;  The heart that throbs with undying affection for the Union&#44; can<lb/> forgive the offense of some of its narrow&#45;minded children.  We my Brethren&#8212;the<lb/> representatives of a sublime Truth&#44; for the preservation of which we have suffered and<lb/> bled&#44; ought never to judge of the merits of a preamble from the illiberality of some<lb/> who profess to advocate it.  We ought&#44; under all circumstances though unjustly held in<lb/> contempt&#44; to triumph over the strides taken by our fellow&#45;men toward the attainment<lb/> of glorious ends.  Therefore upon this day&#44; when the harmonious voice of loyalty is raised<lb/> to heaven with thanksgivings and praises&#44; the <sic>worshipper</sic> of a Unity should duly be forced<lb/> <del>among</del> mid the national chorus <del>of</del> that <del>In</del> celebrates the victories of the Union.  But I see&#44; I have&#44;<lb/> for the sake of a rhetorical flourish&#44; employed an incorrect expression.  Not the victories<lb/> of the Union&#44; but those of Freedom&#44; my friends&#44; we do celebrate.  What is Union with<lb/> human degradation.  Who would again affix his seal to the bond that resigned millions<lb/> to <add>&#63;</add>dom&#63;  Not I&#44; the enfranchised slave of <persName>Myraim</persName>.  Not you&#44; whose motto is progress<lb/> and civilization least then your version yonder&#44; and behold the happy change wrought by the<lb/> hand of Providence.  When the <add>&#63;</add> which summoned all to arms&#44; resounded throughout this<lb/> land&#44; a band of patriots vowed to set high upon <placeName>Fort Sumter</placeName> the flag that treason had<lb/> lowered to the earth.  Who arose then to impede their work&#63;  The men of a state which<lb/> has now buried in the waters of the <placeName>Potomac</placeName> the shackles of servitude.  She blushed at a deed<lb/> that had stained her escutcheon&#44; and timely laid on the national altar&#44; an offering of atonement.<lb/>  Her momentary indiscretion misled the foe&#44; therefore she was <sic>comitted</sic> by the adversaries of a universal<lb/> freedom.  They coquetted with her&#44; who fancied that she would be easily <add>&#63;</add> by their acts&#44; but<lb/> she withstood the seduction&#44; and voluntarily cast her lot among the free &#38; the brave.  My name<lb/> shall no longer be called <placeName>Maryland</placeName> but merry&#45;land for thou hast verily breathed in joyous spirit<lb/> into the souls of thy inhabitants.  And when I remember&#44; my friend&#44; that from the windows<lb/> of our legislative hall a scene could be witnessed&#44; two years ago&#44; that belied the enactments of<lb/> a Republican Senate&#44; I discover&#44; with a naked eye&#44; the finger of the Almighty Creator working<lb/> wonders.</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>The <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName> gave the first impulse to the wheel of progress&#44; and it has ever since<lb/> rolled on with a steady motion.  My beloved hearers&#33;  If this alone were the issue<add>&#63;</add> of our struggle&#44; it<lb/> would suffice the philanthropist.  It would offer him ample occasion to pour forth sincere thanksgivings<lb/> for the benevolence of his unfortunate fellow&#45;beings.  But we have also taught the world thereby<lb/> a lesson of incalculable utility Aye &#8220;man cannot be established by wickedness&#8221;.  A few ambitious men<lb/> because they could not yet as chiefs in all high places&#44; sought to destroy the happiness of their country.<lb/>  But the fore&#45;brand which they threw in her midst has very nigh well devoured their vitals.  God who<lb/> abhors inequity confounded their counsel.  Innumerable were the means which they employed to divide<lb/> and conquer.  The diplomatic skill in which they confidently abound&#44; undaunted courage&#44; a power of<lb/> resistance worthy of a holy cause&#44; all the appliances of science&#44; all the dexterity of arts&#44; were resorted to<lb/> by the leaders of factions and their deluded followers to fasten upon the <placeName>North</placeName> ruin and disgrace&#44;<lb/> but they conceived vanity and brought forth naught.  <placeName>England</placeName>&#44; envious of <del>he</del> our greatness&#44; may<lb/> have in an <sic>earl</sic> hour for herself&#44; lent them her moral or rather <hi rend="underline">im</hi>moral aid.  Her Majesty of<lb/> <placeName>France</placeName> who ascended the throne by treading upon the corpses of revolutionary victims&#44; may have inspired<lb/> the hope of an early recognition&#44; but the display of our <sic>collossal</sic> strength rendered our enemies <add>&#63;</add><lb/> of their promises.  Thus frustrated in all their schemes&#44; those whites of the <placeName>South</placeName> that have rebelled against<lb/> legitimate authority&#44; let loose now their piratical agents&#44; and an unbridled soldiery to devastate our<lb/> fields and prey on our commerce&#44; but &#8220;man cannot be established by wickedness.  <placeName>Gettysburg</placeName> and the<lb/> <placeName>Shenandoah Valley</placeName> tell the flight of the invading host&#59; the <add>&#63;</add> and <sic>Wachusset</sic> prove his<lb/> impotency.  The fate of a confederacy founded upon fraud has been sealed above.  The conqueror of<lb/> <placeName>Atlanta</placeName> will dismantle its ramparts&#59; the hero of <placeName>Vicksburg</placeName> will make an end of its rule.<lb/>  But say they&#44; who from feelings of humanity are averse to blood&#45;shed.  How dearly will our final victory<lb/> be bought&#33;&#8221;  It may cost the lives of thousands of our promising youths&#59; it may cover the face of<lb/> the land with the pall of death&#59; we may again and again be startled by the <sic>shreeks</sic> of desolate<lb/> mothers&#59; we may behold the crushing sorrow of fathers.  My kind&#45;hearted friends&#33;  I also share<lb/> with you the horror which war inspires&#44; and could I have averted it from this country of our love&#44;<lb/> no sacrifice would have been deemed too great.  I would have even yielded a cherished desire&#44; which<lb/> pervades my very soul&#8212;that of universal liberty&#8212;and trusted to God&#44; who might in His good time<lb/> bring it to pass&#44; but the gage was thrown at our feet.  We must either accept it&#44; or bear<lb/> upon our foreheads the mark of ignominy.  What American will hesitate how to choose in the<lb/> alternative&#63;  To stake his existence at the battle&#45;field in the defense of the Stars and Stripes&#44; or to<lb/> be the contempt of people and the derision of Kings&#63;  Life is a precious gift&#44; but the poltroon who<lb/>  to preserve it sells his country and his rights&#44; is a worthless carcass.  Besides&#44; it appears &#40;may I<lb/> not sin of impiety&#41; it appears as though<del>t</del> the fiat of the Omnipotent was that great truths<lb/> must wend their course through blood ere they are firmly established upon earth.  It may be with<lb/> the wise design that their value be enhanced in our estimation&#44; that they may <del>me</del> be rendered dearer<lb/> to all hearts.  But what ever may be the inscrutable motive&#44; we cannot expect that for our sake<lb/> the divine decree will be altered.  Deploring therefore&#44; the dire necessity of war&#44; we must not sh<add>&#63;</add></p>

				<p>from it&#44; when the life of a nation hangs thereupon.  The <sic>heros</sic> of your revolution&#44; those<lb/> noble names &#8220;that grace the rolls of fame&#8221; went boldly forth to the conflict&#44; because they<lb/> preferred death to foreign subjugation.  Not the thirst of blood stirred them up&#44; but the<lb/> conviction that from its reeking mass the genius of Liberty would rise.  Your <persName>Montgomery</persName> and<lb/> Your <persName>Warrens</persName>&#44; who breathed their last mid the roar of the cannon&#44; were the instruments by which<lb/> the God of battles&#44; wrought the happiness of a whole generation.  True&#44; the men they gallantly<lb/> fought were not the children of this soil&#8212;brothers nurtured at the same breast.  They were<lb/> the sons of the stranger&#44; who attempted to rule over us.  Now&#44; alas&#33; we are marshaled in mortal<lb/> array against the offspring of our kind mother.  But upon them&#44; who first unsheathed the<lb/> <sic>fritricidal</sic> sword rests the terrible responsibility.  Unnatural and perfidious they endeavoured to sunder<lb/> at a stroke that bond of union which constitutes our greatness.  That which <add>&#63;</add> is the glory of <placeName>America</placeName>&#44;<lb/> and the joy of the oppressed they would demolish&#44; to rear upon its ruin a monument to human bondage.<lb/>  It shall not be.  The thundering voice of millions <del>of</del> among the free has so proclaimed.  Upon the<lb/> day that the suffrage of a sovereign people was to declare  in whose hands they shall trust their<lb/> interests during another cycle of years&#44; my anxious looks were directed to the wires whereby intelli<lb/>&#61;gence is spread abroad.  The air had been previously filled with inauspicious rumors.  The<lb/> most incredulous believed that the mighty contest would surely give birth to violence and sedition.<lb/>  My friends&#33;  We have won many battles&#44; but the last was the most decisive.  It cut off the<lb/> remaining prop upon which the fungus confederacy rested for support.  No more can it trust <del>on</del><lb/> for success in the diversity of our political opinions.  Every man exercised his elective franchise<lb/> agreeably to his best judgment&#44; but even they who bestow an undue degree of pity on our misguided<lb/> foes refused to lead countenance to treason.  The dreaded clamour of angry multitudes was not heard<lb/> in our borders&#44; the threats of disaffection found no utterance in our midst.  I <del>called</del> challenged<lb/> the world to show a parallel case.  Of a nation&#44; I say&#44; wrought up to the highest pitch of<lb/> political effervescence who&#44; nevertheless regulate their actions by the square and compass of equity.<lb/>  Let now the foreign press <sic>indite</sic> its diatribes about man&#39;s inability for self government.  We<lb/> have proved our capacity for it.  We have proved moreover&#44; that we are resolved at all hazards&#44;<lb/> to bequeath to posterity the country founded by our <persName>Washington</persName> in all its untarnished <sic>lustre</sic>.<lb/>  Once more will we call upon the rebellious to desist &#8220;Return ye wayward children&#59; your<lb/> trespasses shall be remembered no more&#8221;  If they hearken&#44; we will &#8220;beat our swords into <sic>plough</sic>&#45;shares&#44;<lb/> and our spears into pruning&#45;hooks.&#8221;  If they harden their hearts&#44; we shall lament so much contumacy&#44;<lb/> but its disastrous effects shall be required at their hands.  Oh&#33;  Let us pray that they may heed our call.<lb/>  Let us in all sincerity tender the olive branch.  Let us endeavour by honorable means to facilitate its<lb/> acceptance.  More than in the prowess of our army and the feats of our navy we ought to seek<lb/> glory in laboring peacefully for the reconstruction of our once mighty Republic.  Our progress in<lb/> arts and sciences&#44; which thus <del>uh</del> unhappy war has caused to develop will sink into utter insignific<lb/>&#61;ance before the progress which all the human race shall attain&#44; when tutored by a nation whose laws</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>are the laws of righteousness and whose sole defense is peace.  Oh&#33;  Let us pray for the<lb/> dawning of that joyous day when thirty five reunited States shall offer a national<lb/> thanksgiving&#44; while the symbol of their greatness shall proudly wave over every<lb/> dome and sphere.  Let us pray for peace.</p>
				<p>Parent of good&#33;  We lay prostrate at the footstool of Thy mercy and crave for peace.<lb/>  Grateful for Thy manifold favors at all times and this year especially&#44; we yet cannot fully<lb/> rejoice in its fruition.  Thou hast verily filled to overflowing the cup of our prosperity&#44; but<lb/> that of bitter sorrow is also brought nigh to our lips.  The aspect of the dead&#44; the<lb/> agony of the wounded&#44; the moaning of the sufferers&#44; tear our hearts.  From the<lb/> <sic>ensanguined</sic>battle field&#44; from the chilly and dreary camps&#44; from the bereaved and lonely<lb/> hearth&#44; a voice rises unto Thee&#44; O compassionate Lord&#33;  and &#8220;peace&#44; peace&#8221; it cries.  Oh I send<lb/> a ray of Divine wisdom to <sic>illumme</sic> the mind of our Chief Magistrate&#44; that he may discover<lb/> the instrument of peace.  Let the gentle spirit of forbearance hover around the Assembly<lb/> of our Senators and <del>Le</del> Representatives and guide their deliberations.  Repress the vehemence<lb/> of zealots&#44; and let the feelings of the obdurate be softened by tokens of brotherhood and love.<lb/>  May we speedily throw again My holy courts&#44; to thank and praise Thy name&#44; Oh most<lb/> High God&#33; <sic>for</sic> the longed&#45;for peace of our beloved Union.</p>
				<p>And now I beseech Thee O Lord&#33; <sic>to</sic> excite within us a sentiment of patriotism&#44; that we may<lb/> enlist our names among these of our beneficent men and women who labor for the sake of our<lb/> defenders at sea and on land.  May our hospitals&#44; our sanitary commissions and our<lb/> soldiers and societies obtain a ready and generous cooperation from those who have been taught<lb/> to believe that &#8220;Charity <del>delive</del> delivereth from death&#8221;.  May such be Thy gracious will&#44; O<lb/> Heavenly Creator.  Amen.</p>
