			<p rend="indent(1)">IF the life of a good man were the only source of benefit to man&#45;<lb/>kind&#8212;if the sphere of his usefulness was limited only to his contem&#45;<lb/>poraries or to the age in which he lived&#44; or if perishable&#44; like the<lb/> transitory things of life&#44; his death would be an irreparable loss&#44; and<lb/> our grief would be inconsolable.  But fortunately&#44; the good man lives<lb/> forever.  The muse of history&#44; in gathering the fragments which she<lb/> records&#44; blots out the interval of time&#44; and makes the past and the<lb/> present but one.  The great and the good of the many centuries<lb/> that have rolled on in their course&#44; live now fresh in our recollections.<lb/>  We share their hopes and fears&#44; we rejoice in their gladness&#44; and<lb/> grieve in their sorrow&#44; and the wisdom that fell from their lips has<lb/> all its original freshness and vigor.  It would be deplorable&#44; indeed&#44;<lb/> if man&#39;s usefulness were circumscribed by the short span of life&#59; for it<lb/> is not till the tongues of those envious of his fame have been silenced&#44;<lb/> the passions of his antagonists have been stilled&#44; and the ambition of<lb/> his rivals has been gratified or lost its zest by his death&#44; that the<lb/> clouds that obscured his name are dispelled&#44; and his worth and his<lb/> merits shine out in all their brilliancy.  For we do not properly<lb/> appreciate him whom we meet in the daily walks of life&#44; &#8220;famili&#45;<lb/>arity breeds contempt&#44;&#8221; we see the petty faults and foibles com&#45;<lb/>mon to humanity&#44; specks on the character that our weakness oft<lb/> magnifies to colossal proportions&#44; but when the career of a good</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">4</p>
				<p>man has been impressed with the seal of death&#44; the recollections of<lb/> his virtues throng the memory&#44; and we discover&#44; oft too late&#44; our<lb/> great loss.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">My friends&#44; we have met to pay a tribute to the memory of <persName>Isaac<lb/> Leeser</persName>.  But a few brief hours have passed since his death&#44; and our<lb/> people&#44; by their manifestations of grief&#44; show that they have <sic>sup&#45;<lb/>denly</sic> risen&#44; as if from a stupor&#44; to a consciousness of their loss.<lb/>  Death has been active in our ranks&#59; within a brief period&#44; he has<lb/> cut down some of our brightest men&#59; men whose career has con&#45;<lb/>ferred honor and renown on our race&#44; but he has taken none brighter<lb/> or more devoted to Judaism than he.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> was born in the village of <placeName>Neuenkirchen</placeName>&#44; in the pro&#45;<lb/>vince of <placeName>Westphalia</placeName>&#44; on <date>December 12&#44; 1806</date>.  At the early age of<lb/> eight years he was bereft of his mother&#44; when his grandmother as&#45;<lb/>sumed the care of him.  At the age of fourteen he lost his father.<lb/>  <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> recently&#44; in speaking of his grandmother&#44; said&#58; &#8220;We<lb/> honor her memory and she deserves it&#44; as she watched over us from<lb/> our eighth year&#44; when our own mother was early called&#44; till our four&#45;<lb/>teenth&#44; when both she and her son&#44; our father&#44; were borne to the<lb/> grave in the course of three weeks&#44; and left us thus orphaned in a<lb/> double degree&#44; in the wide world.  Her instructions and admonitions<lb/> have never left us&#44; and we trust that we shall be preserved faithful<lb/> to the end.&#8221;  After some preliminary education in a preparatory<lb/> school&#44; he entered the gymnasium of <placeName>M&#252;nster</placeName>&#44; where he remained<lb/> until the year <date>1824</date>.  We have often heard <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>&#44; in speaking<lb/> of his early education&#44; express his praise for the Catholic priests who<lb/> instructed him.  In <date>February&#44; 1824</date>&#44; he came to the <placeName>United States</placeName> at<lb/> the instance of his uncle&#44; <persName>Zalma Rehin&#233;</persName>&#44; who resided in <placeName>Richmond&#44;<lb/> Va.</placeName>  His uncle being engaged in the mercantile business&#44; employed<lb/> young <persName>Leeser</persName> in his store&#44; when it soon became apparent that he<lb/> was not adapted to such a pursuit&#59; though frequently in after life&#44;<lb/> he expressed a different opinion.  In <date>July&#44; 1828</date>&#44; there appeared<lb/> an article in the <hi rend="italics"><placeName>London</placeName> Quarterly Review</hi>&#44; attacking Judaism.<lb/>  <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> being then a young man&#44; a foreigner&#44; and a resident<lb/> of this country but four years&#44; single&#45;handed and alone entered</p>
			<pb n="5"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">5</p>
				<p>the lists with his unknown and powerful adversary&#44; and defended<lb/> our cause with such ability as to attract great attention.  This de&#45;<lb/>fence introduced <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> to the notice of the congregation<lb/> Mikveh Israel&#44; of this city.  The readership having become vacant<lb/> by the death of <persName>Mr. Keys</persName>&#44; <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> was chosen&#44; in the year <date>1829</date>&#44;<lb/> to fill that position&#44; which he retained till the year <date>1850</date>.  Some time<lb/> subsequently&#44; the new congregation Beth El Emeth was formed&#44; ex&#45;<lb/>pressly for him&#44; by a number of his friends.  He was chosen the<lb/> minister of it.  The congregation&#39;s pecuniary resources being very<lb/> limited&#44; the compensation for his services was trifling indeed&#59; but<lb/> as usefulness was his object&#44; not money&#44; he accepted this position&#44;<lb/> which he retained till his death.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In the year <date>1839</date> <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> again appeared before the public&#44; in<lb/> a series of articles addressed to the editor of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> Gazette</hi>&#44;<lb/> in reply to unfounded and illiberal strictures on our religion in the<lb/> <hi rend="italics"><placeName>London</placeName> Quarterly Review </hi>of <date>1839</date>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Mr. Leeser&#39;s</persName> literary labors&#44; for their variety&#44; number&#44; character&#44;<lb/> and extent&#44; are surprising&#59; in this&#44; few men of our age have sur&#45;<lb/>passed him.  In the year <date>1830</date> he published a work entitled &#8220;In&#45;<lb/>structions in the Mosaic Religion&#44;&#8221; translated from the German of<lb/> <persName>Johlson</persName>&#44; of <placeName>Frankfort on the Main</placeName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In the year <date>1833</date> he published an original work entitled &#8220;The<lb/> Jews and the Mosaic Law&#44;&#8221; in the preface of which he stated that<lb/> &#8220;This book&#44; now for the first time published&#44; was composed more<lb/> than four years ago&#44; whilst I was engaged in pursuits quite uncon&#45;<lb/>genial to literature.  Many a time&#44; after a day of active application<lb/> to business&#44; have I spent the hours of night in writing.  Books for<lb/> reference I had but few&#44; and the reader will therefore excuse the<lb/> brevity with which many of the points are treated&#44; which no doubt<lb/> would have received more attention could I have had authorities to<lb/> refer to.&#8221;  In the years <date>1836</date> to <date>1838</date> he published a collection of<lb/> sermons in two volumes.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In the year <date>1837</date> he published the Portuguese Form of Prayers<lb/> in Hebrew&#44; with his English translation&#59; and in the same year&#44; he<lb/> published a Hebrew spelling and reading book.</p>
				<p rend="align(right)">1&#42;</p>
			<pb n="6"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">6</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The Hebrew Sunday School of this city having been formed&#44; in a<lb/> great measure through his exertions&#44; there was no book for imparting<lb/> instruction in our religion to the young children&#44; which he deemed<lb/> adapted to that purpose.  To supply this want&#44; he published his<lb/> Catechism in the year <date>1839</date>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In <date>1841</date> he published another volume of his sermons&#44; to which he<lb/> appended a series of his articles which had appeared in the <hi rend="italics"><placeName>Phila&#45;<lb/>delphia</placeName> Gazette.</hi></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In the year <date>1842</date> he edited <persName>Grace Aguilar&#39;s</persName> Spirit of Judaism.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In the year <date>1845</date> he published the Pentateuch in Hebrew with<lb/> his English translation&#44; in five volumes.  A short time subsequently&#44;<lb/> he published the Daily Prayers in Hebrew and English&#44; for the use<lb/> of the German Jews&#59; and in the year <date>1853</date> he published&#44; in quarto<lb/> form&#44; his translation of the Bible.  Of this <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> said&#44; &#8220;That it<lb/> is not a new notion by which he was seized of late years&#44; which<lb/> impelled him to the task&#44; but a desire entertained for more than a<lb/> quarter of a century&#44; since the day he <sic>quitted</sic> school in his native<lb/> land to come to this country&#44; to present to his fellow&#45;Israelites an<lb/> English version&#44; made by one of themselves&#44; of the Holy word of<lb/> God.&#8221;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">If <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> had done naught else&#44; this work alone would entitle<lb/> him to the gratitude of every English reader.  Prior to this edition&#44; the<lb/> only English versions of the Bible were that of <persName>King James</persName> and the<lb/> <placeName>Douay</placeName>&#44; the imperfections of which were deplored by biblical scholars<lb/> <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> availed himself of the great ancient commentators&#44; <persName>Rashi</persName>&#44;<lb/> <persName>Redak</persName>&#44; <persName>Aben Ezra</persName>&#44; <persName>Rashbam</persName> and others&#59; and of the labors of <persName>Men&#45;<lb/>delssohn</persName>&#44; <persName>Wessely</persName>&#44; <persName>Zunz</persName>&#44; <persName>Herxheimer</persName>&#44; <persName>Philippsohn</persName>&#44; and of that host<lb/> of illustrious modern commentators&#44; who&#44; devoting their erudition to<lb/> the proper interpretation of the Holy Scriptures&#44; have shed a flood<lb/> of light over them.  To these <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> added his own critical<lb/> knowledge&#44; in which he at that time&#44; perhaps&#44; had no superior in<lb/> <placeName>America</placeName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In the year <date>1857</date> he published this Bible in an 18mo form.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In the year <date>1864</date> he published <persName>Miss Grace Aguilar&#39;s</persName> religious<lb/> works and poems&#44; and at the time of his death&#44; he was engaged in</p>
			<pb n="7"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">7</p>
				<p>publishing his sermons in ten volumes&#44; eight of which had appeared<lb/> previous to his decease&#44; and the remaining two of which will shortly<lb/> be published.  In the year <date>1843</date> he began the publication of the<lb/> <hi rend="italics">Occident</hi> magazine&#44; which he continued till his death.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In addition to these literary labors&#44; <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> translated and pub&#45;<lb/>lished a number of other works&#44; such as <persName>Mendelssohn&#39;s</persName> <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>&#44;<lb/> catechisms&#44; and primary educational books&#44; and when it is remem&#45;<lb/>bered that he faithfully attended to his labors as minster of his con&#45;<lb/>gregation&#59; that in his literary&#44; as well as all other labors&#44; he was<lb/> unaided by an amanuensis or other assistant&#59; that he was his own<lb/> proof&#45;reader&#44; that he had to teach printers to compose in Hebrew&#59;<lb/> that frequently he was compelled to set up Hebrew type&#44; we can<lb/> have some conception of the immensity of his labors and the inde&#45;<lb/>fatigability of his industry.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">When <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> arrived in the <placeName>United States</placeName>&#44; the number of<lb/> Jews was small&#44; and they were scattered over our broad expanse of<lb/> territory.  The little learning they possessed was confined to a few<lb/> persons.  Most of our people&#44; having fled from the oppression <sic>prac&#45;<lb/>tised</sic> on our race by <placeName>Europe&#39;s</placeName> political tyrants or religious bigots&#44;<lb/> came here with but few of the world&#39;s goods&#44; and in their struggles<lb/> against the pinchings of poverty&#44; could give but little time or at&#45;<lb/>tention to their religious culture&#44; and many&#44; who possessed both<lb/> knowledge and pecuniary resources&#44; were indifferent to their religious<lb/> duties.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The means for instruction in the Hebrew were very limited and in&#45;<lb/>efficient.  The knowledge of those who were born here did not greatly<lb/> exceed the rudiments of the language in which our prayers were<lb/> printed&#44; and some elementary principles.  <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> soon saw the<lb/> deplorable state of affairs&#44; and his first efforts were directed to our<lb/> improvement&#59; and with his characteristic ardor&#44; by his writings<lb/> and addresses&#44; he infused vitality into the inert Jewish body.  His<lb/> earnestness&#44; devotion and purity attracted around him the true Jews&#44;<lb/> who lamented their destitution&#59; though but a youth&#44; they hailed<lb/> him as a leader&#59; his agitations extended over our entire land&#44; and<lb/> were felt even in <placeName>Europe</placeName>.</p>
			<pb n="8"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">8</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">His labors accomplished a two&#45;fold purpose.  They not only in&#45;<lb/>structed us&#44; but they contributed in an eminent degree to eradicate<lb/> those prejudices respecting our people&#44; which ignorance and bigotry<lb/> had engendered.  Immediately on accepting the ministerial office&#44;<lb/> he commenced to teach and exhort by public addresses.  He may<lb/> be said to be the originator in this country of the delivery of sermons<lb/> among our people.  His fame soon became extended&#59; he received<lb/> numerous invitations for his services from various parts of the Union&#44;<lb/> which he always cheerfully accepted&#44; and in many places his ad&#45;<lb/>dresses and sermons were the first delivered in English by a Jewish<lb/> divine.  In the accomplishment of his purpose to elevate Judaism&#44;<lb/> his magazine&#44; the <hi rend="italics">Occident</hi>&#44; was an important aid&#59; in its pages&#44; as<lb/> well as by his other literary labors&#44; there was unfolded to the new<lb/> world&#44; some account of the names and writings of those illustrious<lb/> men&#44; who by their learning contributed to preserve and protect our<lb/> existence&#44; religion&#44; and name&#44; through that long period of suffering<lb/> and tribulation&#44; which stained the historic page with the bloody<lb/> record of man&#39;s inhumanity.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Mr. Leeser&#39;s</persName> learning was not profound&#59; that is&#44; he had not de&#45;<lb/>voted himself to some especial subjects&#44; and exhausted or attained<lb/> the highest degree of knowledge by them&#44; but he possessed a great<lb/> fund and variety of learning.  There were but few subjects on which<lb/> he had not some information&#59; his mind was perspicuous&#59; he saw at<lb/> a glance&#44; and from all sources&#44; absorbed knowledge which became<lb/> indelibly fixed in his wonderful memory.  He knew Hebrew&#44; Chal&#45;<lb/>dee&#44; Greek&#44; Latin&#44; French&#44; German and English.  He had a natural<lb/> adaptation for philology&#44; and thoroughly understood the philosophy<lb/> of the structure and grammar of languages&#59; it was this knowledge<lb/> which enabled him to translate with great fidelity&#44; without losing<lb/> the spirit of the original.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">His traits of character were strongly marked&#59; his idiosyncrasy<lb/> unmistakably distinguished him from his fellows&#59; with an indomi&#45;<lb/>table will&#44; he had but few negative qualities.  His industry was<lb/> <sic>marvellous</sic>.  After transacting the multifarious duties of the day&#44;<lb/> he curtailed the hours allotted for rest&#44; by his incessant toil.</p>
			<pb n="9"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">9</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">His perseverance was untiring&#44; his energy was inexhaustible&#44; his<lb/> determination was unfaltering.  By the combination of these qualities<lb/> he accomplished those great results which will render his name<lb/> immortal.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The practices of his life strictly accorded with his professions&#59; of<lb/> the highest purity&#44; he neither said nor did that which could produce<lb/> a blush on the cheek of chastity.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">His charity was as broad and expansive as that of the religion<lb/> which he taught&#59; he was neither avaricious nor sordid&#59; with many<lb/> opportunities for the accumulation of pecuniary wealth&#44; he rejected<lb/> them with disdain&#59; he had higher and holier aspirations&#44; and at<lb/> his death left but few worldly goods.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">He regarded life as a period of obligations and duties&#59; impressed<lb/> by its stern realities&#44; he rarely indulged in those amusements or<lb/> enjoyments which lighten our burdens and invigorate mind and<lb/> body.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">But in this recital of the traits of this truly noble man&#44; it must<lb/> not be forgotten that justice requires &#8220;<hi rend="italics">De mortuis nil nisi verum.</hi>&#8221;<lb/>  He was human.  In his ardor for the accomplishment of some good<lb/> purpose &#40;he had none other&#41;&#44; he sometimes forgot that all were not<lb/> gifted with his quick perceptions&#44; and&#44; in urging them on&#44; was impa&#45;<lb/>tient and impetuous&#44; and at times he would wound tender sensibili&#45;<lb/>ties by his frank and outspoken manner&#59; for he had never learned<lb/> the art of disguising his thoughts.  If these be frailties&#44; they are<lb/> too infinitesimal to dim his name.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> was connected with the various Jewish charitable in&#45;<lb/>stitutions of this city&#59; in these he exhibited his customary restless<lb/> activity&#59; he strove to make them permanent&#44; and not dependent on<lb/> spasmodic efforts for their existence.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">He was the founder of the Hebrew Education Society of this<lb/> city&#44; the Society that I am now honored in addressing.  For years<lb/> he endeavoured to establish schools wherein Hebrew should form one<lb/> of the leading branches of education.  The result of those endeavours&#44;<lb/> was the establishment of this Society and its school&#44; which was the</p>
			<pb n="10"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">10</p>
				<p>precursor in this country of all schools of a similar character.  Sub&#45;<lb/>sequently&#44; he directed his efforts to its permanence&#44; and at his in&#45;<lb/>stance&#44; the late <persName>Judah Touro</persName> endowed it with a liberal bequest.  To<lb/> the school he devoted much time and attention&#59; it was his favorite<lb/> scheme.  He regarded it as a powerful instrument in the advance&#45;<lb/>ment and elevation of Judaism&#44; but his ambition did not rest here.<lb/>  In the draft of the Act for the incorporation of this Society&#44; he<lb/> inserted a provision authorizing a higher institution of learning&#44; and<lb/> Maimonides College sprang into being but a short period previous<lb/> to his death&#44; an appropriate closing act of his life.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In recognition of his services&#44; he was chosen the Provost&#44; and in<lb/> the distribution of the duties among the faculty&#44; he had no ambition<lb/> beyond that of serving in a capacity in which he could be most<lb/> useful.  He entered on his duties&#44; but death had already marked<lb/> him for his victim.  The sands of life had nigh run out&#44; and ere he<lb/> could witness the fruition of his hopes&#44; death closed his earthly<lb/> career.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> dedicated his life to Judaism&#44; of which he was the<lb/> embodiment and type&#59; it was the subject of his reveries by day&#44;<lb/> and the theme of his dreams by night.  He sympathized with its<lb/> sorrows and rejoiced in its gladness.  Not having the cares of a<lb/> wife or family&#44; he watched over it with the fond solicitude of a hus&#45;<lb/>band and parent.  He was a vigilant sentinel&#59; when descrying danger<lb/> threatening it&#44; he became its valiant champion&#44; and&#44; clad with the<lb/> panoply of truth&#44; defended it with his power and strength.  No<lb/> soldier rushing against the blazing cannon&#39;s mouth&#44; in his country&#39;s<lb/> <sic>defence</sic>&#44; or martyr writhing under the tortures of the Auto&#45;da&#45;f&#233; for<lb/> conscience&#39; sake&#44; exhibited greater devotion than he.  It was the<lb/> object of his creation&#44; the purpose of his life.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Within a brief period&#44; <placeName>Israel</placeName> has mourned for the loss of illus&#45;<lb/>trious children&#44; but none greater than he.  What a void his<lb/> death creates&#33;  Upon whom shall his mantle fall&#63;  Let not our<lb/> grief be heartless lip&#45;service.  Let our actions attest our truthful&#45;<lb/>ness and earnestness.  Let us build up as an imperishable monu&#45;</p>

				<p>ment to his fame&#44; an edifice on the deep and broad foundations which<lb/> he planted.  <persName>Isaac Leeser</persName> is dead&#44; but the memory of his public<lb/> services and private worth&#44; will live through the ravages of time&#44;<lb/> and his name will be enrolled among those who have conferred<lb/> honor and renown on our race&#44; and who recognized no earthly dis&#45;<lb/>tinction equal to that conferred on us by the great Creator.</p>
