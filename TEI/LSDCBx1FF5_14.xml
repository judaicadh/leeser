			<p>My dear friend</p>
          <p rend="indent(2)">I avail myself of the first<lb/> trip of the Steamer hence to <placeName>N. Y.</placeName> to drop you<lb/> a line acknowledging your last&#44; assuring<lb/> you of <persName>Mrs. Nathan&#39;s</persName> and my good health&#44;<lb/> and cherishing the hope that this will meet you<lb/> and all our friends in the full enjoyment of<lb/> that blessing.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">Nothing that can be in any way<lb/> interesting does it fall to my lot to inform you<lb/> of. Political revolutions bring about commercial<lb/> ones&#44; and this little depot&#44; for the manufactures<lb/> and productions of <placeName>Europe</placeName> and <placeName>America</placeName>&#44; is much<lb/> affected by the stir which nations are making<lb/> to obtain from Kings and priests the liberty&#44; rights&#44;<lb/> and privileges of which they have&#44; until now&#44; been<lb/> cruelly depauded<add>&#63;</add>. The events in the <placeName>eastern hemisphere</placeName><lb/> and those in <placeName>Venezuela</placeName> are bringing our merchants to<lb/> the ground. Of course every one must suffer in<lb/> the general stagnations. The Synagogue is losing many<lb/> reliable members who are quitting this for <placeName>America</placeName>&#44;<lb/> and I suffer among the number in the <add>&#63;</add><lb/> of my income. In a year the Synagogue will be<lb/> too poor to support any one I have a mere Reader</p>
		<pb n="2"/>
			<p>were it not for the School my income as<lb/> minister would not keep me in board and lodging.<lb/> I am obliged to toil in that laborious profession<lb/> as before&#44; when&#44; I hoped that&#44; after leaving <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>&#44;<lb/> I should not be again obliged to resume it.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">There is little or no improvement in<lb/> spiritual matters. Sometimes&#44; I am half inclined<lb/> to blame myself as the cause of want of progress&#44;<lb/> were the character of the people not so well known.<lb/> There is too much <add>Hebrew</add> here. It requires a being<lb/> of greater capability than I possess to effect any thorough<lb/> good. Thanks be to God we are quiet. I am grateful<lb/> for small things in despair of accomplishing <add>&#63;</add><lb/> <add>&#63;</add>. I have still<add>&#63;</add> the rage for violent changes&#44;<lb/> and even our friend <persName>Wolff</persName> is becoming orthodox.<lb/> The field of operation was better in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>. I shall<lb/> never affect as much here as I did there. Still<lb/> <persName>Carillon&#39;s</persName> mad schemes are silenced for the <add>&#63;</add>&#44;<lb/> and the accomplishing so much is an evidence<lb/> of the successful result of my ministry. People<lb/> are more strict in pot and kettle than formerly there<lb/> is good attendance at the Synagogues on Sabbath&#44;<lb/> and holy days&#44; and the children generally are learning<lb/> Hebrew&#44; and religion. The girls generally are studying<lb/> the sacred language&#44; and several of them show great<lb/> proficiency.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">A most <add>&#63;</add> calamity has lately</p>
		<pb n="3"/>
			<p>befallen us&#44; and it is my duty&#44; as a minister of<lb/> <placeName>Israel</placeName> to inform you of it. Incest has been com&#45;<lb/>mitted&#44; between brother and sister&#44; and the fruit of<lb/> it was brought forth to the disgrace of us all. The<lb/> parties have left the <placeName>Island</placeName>&#44; had they not&#44; the General<lb/> would have sent them in chains to <placeName>Copenhagen</placeName>. The<lb/> young man who acted this abominably received<lb/> a <hi rend="underline">German</hi> education. I doubt by this mean to cast<lb/> a slur on <placeName>Germany</placeName>&#44; but on the parties who undertake<lb/> to teach without making religion the basis of instruction.<lb/> When Jewish parents send their children to a Jew<lb/> who has married a Christian&#44; and yet who is a<lb/> Parnass of the <placeName>Hamburg</placeName> Temple&#44; who breakfasts on<lb/> <date>Kippur</date> and then goes in solemn mockery to ask<lb/> atonement for his sins&#44; what can be the result. The<lb/> unprincipled teacher will make a corrupt <del>pu</del><lb/> pupil as in the present instance. <persName>Dr Fr&#228;nkel</persName><lb/> was the master&#44; <persName>Mr. David Pretto</persName> son of <persName>Jacob Pretto</persName><lb/> the pupil&#33; The parents of the wretched children<lb/> are gone to the <placeName>states</placeName> the incestuous <add>&#63;</add> wish the<lb/> guilty daughter are with them. God grant they may<lb/> never attempt to marry the child &#40;a boy&#41; in the<lb/> Jewish family. I write this for your Guidance<lb/> should they come to <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>. The child has<lb/> not been circumcised&#44; as they went away before</p>
		<pb n="4"/>
			<p>the eighth day. It has afflicted every one of<lb/> us. We hang down our heads with shame.</p> 
          <p rend="indent(1)">I was lately in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>&#44; and was<lb/> warmly welcomed. Whilst there&#44; somebody told<lb/> me that the <placeName>N. O.</placeName> congregation had written me an<lb/> invitation to come and be their minister&#44; but if so&#44;<lb/> the letter has never reached my hands. <persName>Carillon</persName><lb/> applied to me to give him letters of introduction<lb/> and recommendation in order to obtain the<lb/> situation. I declined doing so&#44; and gave him<lb/> as my reasons&#44; his uniform bad conduct in <add>&#63;</add><lb/> dissension and propagating improper and heterodox<lb/> doctrine. His eloquence did not move me. I<lb/> also refused to preach for him in <placeName>Spanish Town</placeName>&#44; as<lb/> I would not aid him in the principle of sending<lb/> round the begging box for his benefit.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">Pray give my best respects to <persName>Miss<lb/> Gratz</persName> and all her family&#59; to my friends <persName>Mrs Hart</persName><lb/> and <persName>Miss Louisa</persName>&#44; <persName>Mr Abr. Hart</persName> &#38; family&#44; <persName>Mr Peixotto</persName><lb/> your good land lady and <persName>Miss Couzens</persName>&#44; if she be <persName>miss<lb/> Couzens</persName> still&#44; and all my kind well wishers&#44; send<lb/> me 100 of the Roads of faith. I hope you corrected<lb/> any errors without regard to my vanity or self&#45;<lb/>love. Wishing you success in all your undertakings<lb/> in which <persName>Mrs Nathan</persName> and family <add>&#63;</add>.</p>
