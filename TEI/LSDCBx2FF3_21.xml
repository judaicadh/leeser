				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>Montreal</placeName> <date>13 July 5616</date>.</p>
				<p>My dear sir</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">I employ my earliest leisure<lb/> in replying to yours of <date>30<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> ult&#44; because<lb/> I wish to disabuse you of the idea you<lb/> seem to entertain that I had written some<lb/> of our Ministers in the states had invited<lb/> my cooperation in undertakings which<lb/> certainly would have injured you.  But I<lb/> did not write this&#44; No doubt you have<lb/> just grounds of complaint against some<lb/> &#8212;you are the best judge of this&#44; but it<lb/> might have occurred to you that laymen<lb/> also might have made these overtures.<lb/>  I wrote you in my last what I have<lb/> stated to you personally&#8212;that <hi rend="underline">with reference</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">to the election</hi> I had been deemed guilty<lb/> of insincerity by you&#44; because some<lb/> ministers had represented one thing to you<lb/> and another to me.  Of this I have proof<lb/> but I bore the imputation &#40;and have done<lb/> so until now&#41; because I believed that if<lb/> your many professions of friendship &#38;<lb/> esteem extending over 6 years had been</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>sincere&#44; you had not deemed me guilty<lb/> of such meanness not to say irreligion.<lb/>  You repeat&#44; you did me no wrong.  But<lb/> irrespective of your unwarrrantable attack in<lb/> the Occident you forget you wrote in here<lb/> to <persName>Mr J Joseph</persName> &#40;<add>&#63;</add>&#41; that I had <hi rend="underline">underhandedly</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">endeavored to supplant you</hi>.  I have denied<lb/> and do as earnestly as ever deny this &#38; convinced<lb/> as were all your best friends&#8212;<persName>Miss Gratz</persName><lb/> included&#8212;that you had made unjustifiable<lb/> changes.  You know yourself the change is<lb/> not a trifling one which you wrote to <persName>Mr<lb/> J H Joseph</persName>.  And conscious of me&#44; <add>&#63;</add><lb/> you might suppose I could not congratulate<lb/> you on your decision or judgment or friendly<lb/> feeling.  But Pope&#45;like&#8212;excuse my candor&#8212;<lb/> You <hi rend="underline">will</hi> be infallible.  I have still <persName>Mr Josephs</persName><lb/> letter wherein you write as above.  I will trouble<lb/> you no more on this subject&#44; but I believe the<lb/> day will yet come when you will admit that<lb/> you unwarrantably accused me&#44; and also that<lb/> I was not &#8220;too foolish to act properly.&#8221;  One<lb/> more remark however&#8212;you write&#8212;you would<lb/> have wished ministers to have acted towards<lb/> you&#44; as they would have expected you to have<lb/> acted towards them.  You no doubt imply I did<lb/> not so act.  But I shall be satisfied if any<lb/> one coming here&#44; when I have acted &#38; said as you<lb/> did&#44; shall act as underhandedly to me as I did to you.</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I know of no plan concocted or concocting<lb/> that could injure you&#59; nor have I heard of<lb/> any new magazine or periodical project.<lb/>  I think however that the <del>Orthodox</del> Occident<lb/> is not sufficient for the wants of orthodoxy<lb/> although you are the first one I have ever<lb/> stated this much to&#8212;as otherwise I should<lb/> hear from you that I had been underhandedly <add>&#63;</add><lb/>  We want a weekly&#8212;a good spirited weekly<lb/> in the orthodox interest&#44; that would give<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> in a civil way the attention<lb/> the want oftener than once a month.  If the<lb/> Asmonean were more of my way of thinking<lb/> I would like to see it flourish&#44; but enterprising<lb/> &#38; worthy man as <persName>Mr Lyons</persName> is&#44; he has allowed<lb/> his paper to become too frequently the <add>&#63;</add><lb/> of the most dangerous views&#44; editorially as<lb/> well as by means of correspondents.  Is there<lb/> any chance of you publishing a weekly.<lb/>  I promise you not to supplant you in any way<lb/> otherwise don&#39;t be surprised if you find me<lb/> doing what I can for an orthodox weekly<lb/> one of these days.  But perhaps the Asmoenan will prove a true ma<lb/>&#45;cabee.  I write to my father today &#38; shall tell<lb/> him you had not heard from him to date.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I dare say that&#44; proportionately&#44;</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>they would do their share here for a<lb/> college but where is the action in more<lb/> important places&#63;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I will do what I can in collecting<lb/> and remain&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yours truly</p>
