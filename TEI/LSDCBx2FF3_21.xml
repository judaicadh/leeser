            <p>My dear sir</p>
            <p rend="indent(2)">I employ my earliest leisure<lb/> in replying to yours of
                        <date>30<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> ult, because<lb/> I wish to disabuse
                you of the idea you<lb/> seem to entertain that I had written some<lb/> of our
                Ministers in the states had invited<lb/> my cooperation in undertakings which<lb/>
                certainly would have injured you. But I<lb/> did not write this, No doubt you
                have<lb/> just grounds of complaint against some<lb/> —you are the best judge of
                this, but it<lb/> might have occurred to you that laymen<lb/> also might have made
                these overtures.<lb/> I wrote you in my last what I have<lb/> stated to you
                personally—that <hi rend="underline">with reference</hi><lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">to the election</hi> I had been deemed guilty<lb/> of
                insincerity by you, because some<lb/> ministers had represented one thing to
                you<lb/> and another to me. Of this I have proof<lb/> but I bore the imputation (and
                have done<lb/> so until now) because I believed that if<lb/> your many professions
                of friendship &amp;<lb/> esteem extending over 6 years had been</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>sincere, you had not deemed me guilty<lb/> of such meanness not to say
                irreligion.<lb/> You repeat, you did me no wrong. But<lb/> irrespective of your
                unwarrrantable attack in<lb/> the Occident you forget you wrote in here<lb/> to
                    <persName>Mr J Joseph</persName> (<add>?</add>) that I had <hi rend="underline"
                    >underhandedly</hi><lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">endeavored to supplant you</hi>. I have denied<lb/> and do as
                earnestly as ever deny this &amp; convinced<lb/> as were all your best
                    friends—<persName>Miss Gratz</persName><lb/> included—that you had made
                unjustifiable<lb/> changes. You know yourself the change is<lb/> not a trifling one
                which you wrote to <persName>Mr<lb/> J H Joseph</persName>. And conscious of me,
                    <add>?</add><lb/> you might suppose I could not congratulate<lb/> you on your
                decision or judgment or friendly<lb/> feeling. But Pope-like—excuse my candor—<lb/>
                You <hi rend="underline">will</hi> be infallible. I have still <persName>Mr
                    Josephs</persName><lb/> letter wherein you write as above. I will trouble<lb/>
                you no more on this subject, but I believe the<lb/> day will yet come when you will
                admit that<lb/> you unwarrantably accused me, and also that<lb/> I was not “too
                foolish to act properly.” One<lb/> more remark however—you write—you would<lb/> have
                wished ministers to have acted towards<lb/> you, as they would have expected you to
                have<lb/> acted towards them. You no doubt imply I did<lb/> not so act. But I shall
                be satisfied if any<lb/> one coming here, when I have acted &amp; said as you<lb/>
                did, shall act as underhandedly to me as I did to you.</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I know of no plan concocted or concocting<lb/> that could injure
                you; nor have I heard of<lb/> any new magazine or periodical project.<lb/> I think
                however that the <del>Orthodox</del> Occident<lb/> is not sufficient for the wants
                of orthodoxy<lb/> although you are the first one I have ever<lb/> stated this much
