                <persName>Lyons</persName> have done all they can. <persName>Joseph Cohen</persName>

                <persName>Abraham</persName> has somehow conceived an opinion that I have

                <add>?</add> me for about two years, and I never once saw him even<lb/> at his own
                house during all this time. No doubt some expenses<lb/> have been busy with him as
                well as with others, and he is about<lb/> such a man, as can be influenced of his
                pride is flattered. His<lb/> brothers hardly dare to disobey him, so that if they
                will not vote<lb/> for <persName>Lyons</persName> they will perhaps stay at home,
                unless <persName>Mrs Gratz</persName><lb/> &amp; her brother, or I have mentioned
                already can induce them to<lb/> do as <add>they</add> should and would do, were it

                calculated on by them,<lb/> but I hardly think, that he has authorized them to use
                his name,<lb/> on the contrary his expressions are often the whole in my favour.<lb/>
                <persName>Altamont Phillips</persName> never was for me, altho' to all appearance

                    <persName>Joseph Phillips</persName> &amp; <persName>I. J. Levy</persName>, who
                last year<lb/> gave such votes as caused all the present difficulty; of them
                four<lb/> had supported <persName>Abraham Hart's</persName> resolution, and not been
                fooled by <persName>Mr<lb/> John Moss</persName> I would have been elected for three
                years; but <persName>Mr. M.</persName> pro-<lb/>fessing that he never wished to see
                me out of office, they believed him,<lb/> and were caught in the cunning trap of
                annual elections, in order<lb/> as was said to keep the officers defendant, but in
                truth to make<lb/> room for <persName>Lyons</persName>. <persName>S.
                    Morris</persName> has been friendly, though I know not whether<lb/> he ever gave
                a vote for me, I rather think the opposite is the case.<lb/>
                <persName>Isaac B. Phillips</persName> never attended meeting, but now he has<lb/>
                been roused by the monstrous injustice the <persName>Moss</persName> family intend.<lb/>
                <persName>Simon Gratz</persName> likewise was never present at an election these
                8<lb/> years, altho' it is said he has now expressed his intention of<lb/>
                attending. <persName>David</persName> &amp; <persName>Jacob Nathans</persName>, son
                of <persName>Isaiah</persName> may perhaps be<lb/> brought to the meeting by
                    <persName>David Peroa</persName>, as also <persName>Samuel M.<lb/>
                    Solomon</persName>, who is counted on by <persName>Lyons</persName>;
                    <persName>Lewis Allen</persName> I call doubtful<lb/> because he is a brother in
                law of <persName>Lyons</persName>, and has not said any<lb/> thing from which his
                intentions can be known. <persName>Mr. Elkin</persName> never<lb/> goes to meeting
                and then he cannot be depended upon because<lb/> he speaks fair to all.
                    <persName>Jacob Gratz</persName> altho' a staunch friend<lb/> has latterly
                almost withdrawn from congregational business &amp; it is<lb/> doubtful whether he
                will be in town and of whether his sister can<lb/> make him go down; yet doubtless
                he will be roused, and if so, he<lb/> will cast a vote in my favour.__<persName>B.
                        Eylinge<add>?</add></persName> is lame of grat<add>?</add>,<lb/> but yet if
                urged by my friend may go for me, or otherwise for<lb/>
                <persName>Lyons</persName>; he is like <persName>Elkin</persName> smooth spoken.
                    <persName>Isaac Moses</persName> &amp; <persName>Isaac<lb/> Hays</persName>
                never go to meeting, yet <persName>Miss Gratz</persName> may induce them to<lb/>
                attend for that day.—<persName>Zalegman Phillips</persName> has never been for
                me,<lb/> and even if he votes for me, he may do it in such a manner as to<lb/>
                destroy all good effects from it. <persName>Aaron Levy</persName> is also very
                doubtful, altho'</p>
            <pb n="2V"/>
            <p>he is said to have spoken in my favour._ Remember <persName>Etting</persName> is
                calculated in for <persName>Lyons</persName><lb/> because I would not attend the
                funeral of his grandchild; yet I believe this<lb/> to be false, as he would hardly
                so much offend his relatives, who always have<lb/> been kind to him; yet I should
                think he will not go to meeting. His son<lb/>
                <persName>Gratz</persName> you know has been crazy, and if he is even well, it is
                hardly to be<lb/> supposed that he will dare to expose himself to the excitement of
                a<lb/> public meeting. I candidly believe that I have given you a fair
                statement,<lb/> and you will see that <persName>Lyons</persName> will have certain
                from 8-10; I about 14,<lb/> doubtful when present 19; doubtful whether they will
                come 10; now if we<lb/> divide these 20 and give him 20, the rest for me 24; it is
                certainly; by no means ascertained who will be elected; but if there is a<lb/> full
                meeting, it is not likely that he can be carried. The<lb/> only fear is a thin
                meeting, when 12 or 14 determined men<lb/> can do as they please. But persons have
                so often publicly said,<lb/> that <persName>Mr. Lyon's</persName> conduct was
                shameful, that one would suppose<lb/> in reason, that it would unite all, who are in
                my favour; but time<lb/> only can show. He may be elected, but if he is, it is by
                management<lb/> and such tricks as he must be ever ashamed of._They have also
                av<lb/>owed to get scholar for him, without asking me, whether it would<lb/>
                interfere with my interest._Last Sundry<add>?</add> week I called at
                    <persName>Mr.<lb/> Allen's</persName> and left word, that if <persName>Mr
                    Lyons</persName> would let me see his certificates<lb/> I would let him read.
                The certificates were left in <persName>Mr A's</persName> hands, never.<lb/>

                    <persName>Joseph Moss</persName> &amp; <persName>Isaac Phillips</persName>, not
                daring<lb/> to go themselves; but he told them, they <add>?</add>ebah belong to me,
                and<lb/> I alone have the power to dispose of the prayers. The signers to the<lb/>
                petition requesting the Parnass to appoint (whether I would or not) were
