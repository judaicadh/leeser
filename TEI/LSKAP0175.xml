				<p>In all forty four members Absent and I believe no with us<lb/> <persName>Joseph J. Andrews</persName> &#38; <add><persName>David G. Seinar</persName>&#59;</add> <persName>Raphael De Cordova</persName>&#59; absent <persName>Jacob De Lan<add>&#63;</add></persName>&#44; and<lb/> <persName>Levi M. Goldsmit</persName>&#44; who if present would be for me&#44; and be certain<lb/> at meeting.  Of those ten put down for <persName>Lyons</persName>&#44; it is possible but<lb/> hardly likely that <persName>Joseph</persName> &#38; <persName>E. L. Moss</persName> will not be present&#59; and the<lb/> <persName>Cohens</persName>&#44; altho&#39; they are somewhat bitter against me&#44; may perhaps be<lb/> gained&#44; if <persName>Mr. Gratz</persName> can get a chance of speaking to them after the<lb/> <persName>Lyons</persName> have done all they can.  <persName>Joseph Cohen</persName> is in my favour&#44; but<lb/> <persName>Abraham</persName> has somehow conceived an opinion that I have slighted<lb/> him&#44; but I can freely say&#44; that it is without foundation.  He has<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> me for about two years&#44; and I never once saw him even<lb/> at his own house during all this time.  No doubt some expenses<lb/> have been busy with him as well as with others&#44; and he is about<lb/> such a man&#44; as can be influenced of his pride is flattered.  His<lb/> brothers hardly dare to disobey him&#44; so that if they will not vote<lb/> for <persName>Lyons</persName> they will perhaps stay at home&#44; unless <persName>Mrs Gratz</persName><lb/> &#38; her brother&#44; or I have mentioned already can induce them to<lb/> do as <add>they</add> should and would do&#44; were it not for the <hi rend="underline">friendship</hi> of<lb/> <persName>Samuel Lyons</persName>.&#95;&#95;Old <persName>Mr. Nathans</persName> is calculated on by them&#44;<lb/> but I hardly think&#44; that he has authorized them to use his name&#44;<lb/> on the contrary his expressions are often the whole in my favour.<lb/>  <persName>Altamont Phillips</persName> never was for me&#44; altho&#39; to all appearance there<lb/> never was a difference between us.  <persName>Plock</persName> once owed me fifteen<lb/> Dollars for 18 months&#44; and because he had to pay he is angry<lb/> there four pay.  <persName>Dreyfous</persName> never was for me&#59; why I never heard.<lb/>  The brothers <persName>Asch</persName> last year were busy to cut my salary down<lb/> and thought them at variance with the <persName>Lyons&#39;</persName> have since been<lb/> flattered over.  <persName>Mr. Moss</persName> &#38; his sons are likewise his son in law <persName>D.<lb/> Samuel</persName> &#38; his brother are of course for the family.&#95;&#95;But those on my</p>
			<pb n="2R"/>
				<p>side put down on certain have been uniform supporters except <persName>Jacob<lb/> Phillips</persName> &#38; <persName>Elias Hyneman</persName>&#44; as also <persName>Joseph Phillips</persName> &#38; <persName>I. J. Levy</persName>&#44; who last year<lb/> gave such votes as caused all the present difficulty&#59; of them four<lb/> had supported <persName>Abraham Hart&#39;s</persName> resolution&#44; and not been fooled by <persName>Mr<lb/> John Moss</persName> I would have been elected for three years&#59; but <persName>Mr. M.</persName> pro&#45;<lb/>fessing that he never wished to see me out of office&#44; they believed him&#44;<lb/> and were caught in the cunning trap of annual elections&#44; in order<lb/> as was said to keep the officers defendant&#44; but in truth to make<lb/> room for <persName>Lyons</persName>.  <persName>S. Morris</persName> has been friendly&#44; though I know not whether<lb/> he ever gave a vote for me&#44; I rather think the opposite is the case.<lb/>  <persName>Isaac B. Phillips</persName> never attended meeting&#44; but now he has<lb/> been roused by the monstrous injustice the <persName>Moss</persName> family intend.<lb/>  <persName>Simon Gratz</persName> likewise was never present at an election these 8<lb/> years&#44; altho&#39; it is said he has now expressed his intention of<lb/> attending.  <persName>David</persName> &#38; <persName>Jacob Nathans</persName>&#44; son of <persName>Isaiah</persName> may perhaps be<lb/> brought to the meeting by <persName>David Peroa</persName>&#44; as also <persName>Samuel M.<lb/> Solomon</persName>&#44; who is counted on by <persName>Lyons</persName>&#59; <persName>Lewis Allen</persName> I call doubtful<lb/> because he is a brother in law of <persName>Lyons</persName>&#44; and has not said any<lb/> thing from which his intentions can be known.  <persName>Mr. Elkin</persName> never<lb/> goes to meeting and then he cannot be depended upon because<lb/> he speaks fair to all.  <persName>Jacob Gratz</persName> altho&#39; a staunch friend<lb/> has latterly almost withdrawn from congregational business &#38; it is<lb/> doubtful whether he will be in town and of whether his sister can<lb/> make him go down&#59; yet doubtless he will be roused&#44; and if so&#44; he<lb/> will cast a vote in my favour.&#95;&#95;<persName>B. Eylinge<add>&#63;</add></persName> is lame of grat<add>&#63;</add>&#44;<lb/> but yet if urged by my friend may go for me&#44; or otherwise for<lb/> <persName>Lyons</persName>&#59; he is like <persName>Elkin</persName> smooth spoken.  <persName>Isaac Moses</persName> &#38; <persName>Isaac<lb/> Hays</persName> never go to meeting&#44; yet <persName>Miss Gratz</persName> may induce them to<lb/> attend for that day.&#8212;<persName>Zalegman Phillips</persName> has never been for me&#44;<lb/> and even if he votes for me&#44; he may do it in such a manner as to<lb/> destroy all good effects from it.  <persName>Aaron Levy</persName> is also very doubtful&#44; altho&#39;</p>
			<pb n="2V"/>
				<p>he is said to have spoken in my favour.&#95; Remember <persName>Etting</persName> is calculated in for <persName>Lyons</persName><lb/> because I would not attend the funeral of his grandchild&#59; yet I believe this<lb/> to be false&#44; as he would hardly so much offend his relatives&#44; who always have<lb/> been kind to him&#59; yet I should think he will not go to meeting.  His son<lb/> <persName>Gratz</persName> you know has been crazy&#44; and if he is even well&#44; it is hardly to be<lb/> supposed that he will dare to expose himself to the excitement of a<lb/> public meeting.  I candidly believe that I have given you a fair statement&#44;<lb/> and you will see that <persName>Lyons</persName> will have certain from 8&#45;10&#59; I about 14&#44;<lb/> doubtful when present 19&#59; doubtful whether they will come 10&#59; now if we<lb/> divide these 20 and give him 20&#44; the rest for me 24&#59; it is certainly&#59; by no means ascertained who will be elected&#59; but if there is a<lb/> full meeting&#44; it is not likely that he can be carried.  The<lb/> only fear is a thin meeting&#44; when 12 or 14 determined men<lb/> can do as they please.  But persons have so often publicly said&#44;<lb/> that <persName>Mr. Lyon&#39;s</persName> conduct was shameful&#44; that one would suppose<lb/> in reason&#44; that it would unite all&#44; who are in my favour&#59; but time<lb/> only can show.  He may be elected&#44; but if he is&#44; it is by management<lb/> and such tricks as he must be ever ashamed of.&#95;They have also av<lb/>owed to get scholar for him&#44; without asking me&#44; whether it would<lb/> interfere with my interest.&#95;Last Sundry<add>&#63;</add> week I called at <persName>Mr.<lb/> Allen&#39;s</persName> and left word&#44; that if <persName>Mr Lyons</persName> would let me see his certificates<lb/> I would let him read.  The certificates were left in <persName>Mr A&#39;s</persName> hands&#44; never.<lb/>  theless<add>&#63;</add> they  continued running to members&#44; and at length obtained g<add>&#63;</add><lb/>  Even to <persName>Sol. Moses</persName> they sent <persName>Joseph Moss</persName> &#38; <persName>Isaac Phillips</persName>&#44; not daring<lb/> to go themselves&#59; but he told them&#44; they <add>&#63;</add>ebah belong to me&#44; and<lb/> I alone have the power to dispose of the prayers.  The signers to the<lb/> petition requesting the Parnass to appoint &#40;whether I would or not&#41; were <persName>Mr Nathans</persName>&#44;<lb/> <persName>E. L. Cohen</persName>&#44; <persName>T.

Lytinger</persName> &#38; I think <persName>Aaron Luz</persName>&#59; but I am not certain.  <persName>Hyneman</persName> &#38; <persName>Nathans</persName><lb/> declared they merely did it to give him a chance&#44; but nothing further.
