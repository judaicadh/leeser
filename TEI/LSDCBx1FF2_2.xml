                        >th</hi> of Kislev (Nov.) 1825</date>.</p>
            <p>Peace and all good forever to our master and teacher, the crown of our<lb/> head,
                chief of the court, rabbi and guide of the holy flock, <persName>Rabbi<lb/> Abraham
                    Sutro</persName>, etc., and peace and all that is good to his wife,
                    <persName>Rebecca</persName>,<lb/> and to all the members of his household.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I have been very much pained to find out that you have not
                received<lb/> my letters. I was the more sad about this because I must have seemed
                un-<lb/>grateful, since you might have supposed that my silence was due to the
                fact<lb/> that I had already forgotten everything that I received from you and
                my<lb/> other friends. But, believe me, that after having been here four days,
                I<lb/> began to write, and wrote fourteen<lb/>
                <del>a a a</del> on the 10th day, and dispatched<lb/> them at once. How it happened
                that you did not receive them, I cannot<lb/> understand, for I wrote, and waited
                from <date>Rosh Hodesh Ellul</date> for a letter<lb/> daily. Until finally I was
                fortunate enough to receive four letters<lb/> from <persName>Dulmen</persName>
                <sic>Two</sic> hours after we left the synagogue on <date>Sh'mini
                Atzereth</date>.<lb/> It is now about 2 weeks since I sent a bundle of letters
                addressed <del>?</del><lb/> in care of <persName>Mr. A. Leffman</persName>, by way
                of <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, but I cannot tell when<lb/> these letters will
                arrive in <placeName>Germany</placeName>. Since now an opportunity presents<lb/>
                itself by way of <placeName>Rotterdam</placeName>, since the <persName>brig Somers,
                    E. P. Lord</persName>, company, is<lb/> about to leave for that point, I decided
                to send as many letters as pos-<lb/>sible to such people to whom I have not yet
                written.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I had to overcome several dangers before arriving in
                    <placeName>America</placeName>.<lb/> Sometimes it seemed as if "The cords of
                death encompassed me and the<lb/> straits of the grave had come upon me"*. The
                storms which we had during our long journey sometimes threatened destruction, a
                precipitate death,<lb/> a cold, sad, terrible end, but, "I found trouble and sorrow
                and called upon<lb/> the name of the lord"**. Frequently, dear Rabbi, your blessing,
                your wishes<lb/> at my departure, gave me new strength, new courage. For, was not
                this<lb/> your blessing, "If you go in water, I am with you, and streams will
                not<lb/> overwhelm you"*** Although I was unprepared to die, nevertheless I
                gave<lb/> myself silently over to the will of the Almighty. and since I had no<lb/>
                prayer book in which there was a prayer for travelers on the sea, I made</p>
            <p>*Psalm 116:3 **Psalm 116:3 ***Isaiah 43:2 (somewhat misprinted[?])</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>up my own, which occasionally brought me some comfort. I had to overcome<lb/> certain
                unpleasantnesses, but, thank God, without their c<add>a</add>using me the<lb/>
                slightest loss. I learned from it how little one needs to live, how<lb/> much to
                live well. <sic>So?</sic> Much about my journey, I have related <sic>agreat</sic>
                deal<lb/> in my letters to <persName>Rabbi Benjamin K. Z.</persName>, which went by
                way of <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>.<lb/> And since you are the chief of our
                communities in <placeName>Westphalia</placeName>, the follow-<lb/>ing report, the
                translation of which I want to give to you, will probab-<lb/>ly interest you.
                    <persName>George Bethune English</persName> was a teacher of philology in<lb/>
                one of the universities of the <placeName>northern states</placeName>. Through
                research he dis-<lb/>covered that the religion of the Nazarene was false and that
