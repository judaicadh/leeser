                are endeavoring<lb/> to make an impression that he is an ill-used man; and many<lb/>
                well-disposed persons, in ignorance of the facts, have brought<lb/> themselves to
                believe that the congregation have treated him<lb/> badly. To correct these
                erroneous impressions, and to diffuse<lb/> the light of truth, is the object of this
                publication.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">It is proposed to give the reader a brief review of the late
                con-<lb/>troversies between <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> and the congregation,
                which, if<lb/> read without prejudice or passion, but with a sincere desire to<lb/>
                arrive at the truth, will satisfy any candid person not only how<lb/> groundless are
                the complaints of the reverend gentleman, but<lb/> that the congregation and its
                officers are the parties aggrieved,<lb/> and, under the repeated provocations they
                have received from<lb/> him, have manifested no small degree of forbearance.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">It is not a pleasant duty to be under the necessity of putting<lb/>
                such matters in print; but as <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> has not hesitated<lb/>
                editorially to review and censure the congregation through the<lb/> columns of a
                periodical, he cannot complain if those aggrieved<lb/> by his course shall seek,
                through the Press, to disabuse the minds<lb/> of the members of our congregation and
                our co-religionists else-<lb/>where.</p>

            <p rend="indent(1)">The principal subjects of dispute between him and the
                con-<lb/>gregation were threefold.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">1. That he insisted upon being elected Hazan for what he<lb/> called
                during good behaviour,—or in other words, <hi rend="italics">for life</hi>.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">2. His expressed determination not to sign a contract for the<lb/>
                faithful performance of his duties, as required by the by-laws.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">3. His disrespectful and uncourteous bearing towards the<lb/>

            <p rend="align(center)">I.</p>
            <p rend="align(center)">AS TO THE TENURE OF THE OFFICE.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The regular <hi rend="italics">Hazanim</hi> of the congregation who
                preceded <persName>Mr.<lb/> Leeser</persName>, were, the <persName>Rev. Gershom
                    Mendes Seixas</persName>, <persName>Jacob Cohen</persName>,<lb/>
                <persName>Emanuel Nunes Carvalho</persName>, and <persName>Abraham Israel
                    Keys</persName>—all men<lb/> of unaffected piety, great moral worth, learned in
                our laws,<lb/> thorough-bred Portuguese <hi rend="italics">Hazanim</hi>, familiar
                with all the duties<lb/> of their office, which they so exercised as to deserve and
                win the<lb/> love and respect of the congregation. Of them it might truly<lb/> be
                said, “There were giants in those days.” Yet no one of<lb/> these pious and learned
                divines was ever elected for life. Some<lb/> of them held their offices at the will
                of the congregation, or<lb/> from year to year, and others for limited periods. Our
                congre-<lb/>gation always repudiated the life tenure of the office, and the<lb/>
                correctness of the doctrine is at this time sustained throughout<lb/> the length and
                breadth of the land. We have seen State after<lb/> State cast off the life tenure of
                their Judges, because those Judges<lb/> felt themselves wholly irresponsible; and no
                matter how gross<lb/> their official or personal misconduct might be, if it was not
                such<lb/> as to consign them to the Penitentiary, the idea of an impeach-<lb/>ment
                was a burlesque,—it seldom or ever amounted to anything.<lb/> So would it be with
                any other officer with a like tenure; it is at<lb/> best but frail human nature, and
                the <sic>sarcedotal</sic> character of the<lb/> office would not tend to make the
                incumbent less arrogant or<lb/> presuming. This principle of the limited tenure of
                office, was<lb/> not first called in requisition towards <persName>Mr.
                    Leeser</persName>, but was acted<lb/> on by the congregation before he was born.

                life tenure, was never recognised; and the<lb/> records of the congregation for more
                than thirty years, shew<lb/> the constant assertion of the opposite principle. A few

            <p rend="indent(1)">“A frequent recurrence to elections of their [the congregation's]
                officers, is the<lb/> best check upon them, and the best guarantee for good

            <p rend="indent(1)">Again—</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">“It has always been the policy of the congregation to elect the

                Shohet.”</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)"><date>1850. March 24</date>. The following resolution, after
                many<lb/> amendments were previously disposed of, was adopted:</p>

                the <date>third Sunday of June</date> next, for<lb/> the purpose of electing a Hazan
                to serve for ten years, at a salary of $1300 per an-<lb/>num, if a single man, or
                $1700 per annum if a married man; that the Hazan so<lb/> elected shall execute a

                publications as he may think<lb/> proper.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Before this resolution was adopted, an unsuccessful effort was<lb/>
                made to strike out the words, “for ten years,” and insert the<lb/> words, “during

                    <persName>Abraham Hart, Esq.</persName>, Parnas, announced from<lb/> the Chair
                that he was authorized by <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> to state to the<lb/>
                congregation, that if they adopted any other tenure of office</p>
            <pb n="7"/>
            <p rend="align(center)">7</p>
            <p>than during good behaviour, he would not be a candidate for<lb/> re-election; but
                adding, in substance, that if he were elected<lb/> during good behaviour, he was
                willing to hand in a written re-<lb/>signation of his office, to take effect
                whenever called for by the<lb/> congregation. He also stated, that <persName>Mr.
                    Leeser</persName> was willing to<lb/> remain with the congregation for six
                months after the expiration<lb/> of his present term, in order to afford them an
                opportunity of<lb/> selecting a successor.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">From this it will be seen that the congregation acted
                through-<lb/>out with the utmost good faith in the assertion of a principle<lb/>
                sound in itself, and peculiarly applicable to the present state of<lb/> society. The
                predecessors of <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> acted under it; he<lb/> himself took
                five engagements under it without complaint on<lb/> that score; and no better
                evidence of the good disposition of<lb/> the congregation could be shewn than this,
                that with many pro-<lb/>vocations induced by the reverend gentleman himself,
                they,<lb/> during five successive terms, retained him for twenty-one years,<lb/> and
                it is believed that a majority of the members would have<lb/> been willing to have
                elected him for ten years longer, if the<lb/> other causes of complaint on their
                part had not induced the<lb/> same state of feeling towards him that he continually
                appeared<lb/> to manifest towards them.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">He assigned two reasons for insisting on the life tenure,
                first,<lb/> because the congregation could and ought to trust him, to which<lb/> the
                answer was obvious, that he also might safely have trusted<lb/> them, the bond that
                could most closely have bound him and<lb/> them together, would have been on his
                part, attention and<lb/> fidelity to the duties of his office, courtesy, kindness
                and good<lb/> feeling towards his flock, and the capacity to think that those<lb/>
                who differ with him on questions of policy or principle, might<lb/> honestly differ,
                and that such difference was not of itself an act<lb/> of personal hostility towards
                him; this line of conduct would<lb/> have ensured him a voluntary and not a coerced
                life tenure, and<lb/> what is better, would have carried with it the love, respect
                and<lb/> confidence of those under his pastoral charge. His other reason<lb/> was
                this, that most other congregations elected their Hazanim<lb/> for life, and that he
                being the only exception, would be degraded</p>
            <pb n="8"/>
            <p rend="align(center)">8</p>
            <p>by being chosen for a term of years; all this is sophistical and<lb/> unsound, even
                admitting, as we do not, that other congrega-<lb/>tions choose their Hazanim for
                life, it does not follow that we<lb/> should on that account give up the assertion
                of a sound principle<lb/> working well in practice, we believe that some
                congregations who<lb/> elected a Hazan for life, have regretted it, and would
                gladly<lb/> undo that which they are now convinced they ought not to have<lb/> done.
                But the inconsistency of <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> is here very glaring,<lb/>
                he was willing to hold himself out of the world as elected for<lb/> life, and yet
                take the office under a secret written engagement<lb/> with the congregation,
                converting its tenure into a tenancy at<lb/> will, subject to be determined at any
                given time by a bare majority<lb/> vote;—which was the more degrading position, an
                open honora-<lb/>ble engagement for ten years, or a false representation to the<lb/>
                world of engagement for life, with the reality of a secret un-<lb/>derstanding, that
                it was but a tenure at will? The congrega-<lb/>tion very properly refused to become
                a party to such a hypo-<lb/>critical proceeding.</p>

                the habit of denouncing this by-law, and avowing his deter-<lb/>mination never to

                <persName>Mr. Leeser's</persName> motive for refusing to obey a plain duty; he
                did<lb/> not appear to put it upon any footing except a determination<lb/> not to
                recognize the authority of the Board; with how little<lb/> foundation may be seen by
                reference to the second section of<lb/> Article first of the Charter of the
                congregation, setting forth<lb/> that “the Parnas and Adjunta shall form a Board of

                to the Hazan's disrespectful letter to the Board, and to his<lb/> pertinacious
                refusal to sign the contract which was declared to<lb/> be the correct and only

                hurried through<lb/> our beautiful Hebrew ritual, how unintelligibly he mumbled
                the<lb/> offerings, and with what impatience he bore with any one who he<lb/>
                thought detained him too long with offerings; this produced on<lb/> the part of
                himself and his friends repeated attempts to abolish<lb/> the free-will offerings;
                this subject was often discussed, the<lb/> members having no particular attachment
                to the system of free-<lb/>will offerings, but looking upon it as a financial
                measure, did not<lb/> wish to throw away this source of revenue without providing
                a<lb/> substitute, as the expenses of the congregation were heavy;<lb/> the
                substitute was tried and failed, and the congregation on<lb/> several occasions
                refused by decided votes to abolish free-will<lb/> offerings; many other matters
                might be stated, but they would<lb/> unnecessarily swell this publication; the

                distinguished apart with as much facility as in a daily news-<lb/>paper. In the last

            <p rend="indent(1)">NEWS ITEMS.—<placeName>PHILADELPHIA</placeName>.—At the last annual
                election of the congrega-<lb/>tion Mikveh Israel, the gentlemen composing last

                    <persName>Mr. Simeon W.<lb/> Arnold</persName>, elected Secretary. We regret at
                not being able to announce that some whole-<lb/>some legislation with respect to the
                office of Hazan, and the commutation of the<lb/> money offerings, has not taken
                place; both the by-laws affecting the subjects not<lb/> having met with the
                approbation of the members. They seem to be afflicted with a<lb/> sort of
                nervousness whenever any measure somewhat new in its tendency is pro-<lb/>posed;
                they go into meeting with the resolve of the English iron-clad barons, “not<lb/> to
                change the laws” of their order, however useful, expedient, or even necessary
                the<lb/> measure proposed may be, or however wrong and oppressive the old rule may
                have<lb/> proved in practice. At present we do not think it requisite to say more;
                but a time<lb/> may come, especially if a contingency should arise, which now seems
                possible enough,</p>

                justifi-<lb/>cation, when we shall have to lay some circumstances before the people
                which we<lb/> now mean to let pass in silence, as it is probable that before many
                months some slight<lb/> changes may be made in an obnoxious law; a consummation
                devoutly to be wished.<lb/> Some may believe it imprudent in us to say even this
                little; but since, as said already,<lb/> it may affect our personal standing in the
                community, in case that something is not<lb/> done in the premises before the
                expiration of another year, we hold it right to fore-<lb/>warn our distant friends
                not to throw any blame on us if we do not submit to a usage<lb/> peculiar to our
                congregation, although we were twice over-persuaded to do so before<lb/> this.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">There could be no mistake as to the character of the article.<lb/>
                <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> undertook to hold up the congregation to public
                cen-<lb/>sure, because they would not abolish free-will offerings, and pass<lb/> a
                very ridiculous by-law which had been offered by a member,<lb/> but was believed to
                have been framed by himself; and it is not<lb/> difficult to understand his threat
                of appealing to the public in<lb/> case the congregation refused to elect him for
                life, or dispense<lb/> with the Bond. He himself, a professed opponent of
                innova-<lb/>tions and reforms, could see no sincerity in his congregation<lb/>
                thinking on that subject as he did; and his sneering expression,<lb/> “that they
                seem to be afflicted with a sort of nervousness,” was<lb/> in the very worst spirit.
                His allusion to the iron-clad Barons<lb/> was, as was afterwards remarked by a
                member in debate, “sin-<lb/>gularly unfortunate, as those old feudal Barons were, in
                the early<lb/> days of <placeName>England</placeName>, the conservators of the
                public liberty, who<lb/> resisted <persName>King John</persName> at
                    <placeName>Runymede</placeName>, and wrung from the reluctant<lb/> tyrant MAGNA
                CHARTA. Their memorable declaration—<lb/> THAT THEY WOULD NOT CHANGE THE LAWS OF THE
                REALM, was a<lb/> bold defiance to the power of PRIESTCRAFT, that endeavoured<lb/>
                to force on them a portion of the canon law tending to licenti-<lb/>ousness and
                immorality.”</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">It is not to be supposed that the constituted authorities of
                the<lb/> congregation would pass over in silence an article like this;
                ab-<lb/>solute impunity would have only emboldened him, and the future<lb/> numbers
                of the Occident would have teemed with similar attacks<lb/> upon the congregation.
                Accordingly, a Board meeting was<lb/> held on <date>October 21, 1849</date>, when
                the whole Board were present,<lb/> consisting of <persName>A. Hart, Esq.</persName>,

            <p>preamble and resolutions, offered by <persName>J. A. Phillips</persName>, and

                whole five<lb/> members voting for them:</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">WHEREAS, There appeared in the last number of the Occident—a
                periodical pub-<lb/>lished here by the Hazan of this congregation—an editorial
                article, reviewing, in<lb/> terms of censure, the business proceedings of the
                congregation, and containing a<lb/> threat to appeal to the public, unless certain
                things were done which the editor wishes<lb/> done: And whereas, such misconduct on
                the part of an officer of the congregation,<lb/> deserves the severest animadversion
                and reproof. Therefore—</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)"><hi rend="italics">Resolved</hi>, That it is the opinion of this
                Board, that the conduct of the <persName>Rev. Isaac<lb/> Leeser</persName> in the
                premises, is highly censurable, as tending to provoke irritation, create<lb/> bad
                feeling, and as interfering in matters with which he hath no rightful concern.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)"><hi rend="italics">Resolved</hi>, That his threat to appeal to the
                public, shews an absence of the good<lb/> feeling that should exist on the part of
                the Reader towards his congregation.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)"><hi rend="italics">Resolved</hi>, That the Parnas transmit a copy of
                this preamble and these resolutions<lb/> to <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>, and
                also report the same to the congregation at their next meeting.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">This preamble and these resolutions were officially
                communi-<lb/>cated to <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>; who never to the Board or
                congregation<lb/> offered any explanation, palliation, or apology. They were
                laid<lb/> before the congregation on the <date>24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of March,
                    1850</date>, and would<lb/> have been read, and filed away in silence, and
                without further<lb/> action, but for an onslaught on the Board, made by one or
                two<lb/> of the Hazan's indiscreet friends. This brought the members<lb/> to their
                feet, and the following resolution was adopted:</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)"><hi rend="italics">Resolved</hi>, That the action of the Board be
                approved.—Yeas, 20; Nays, 7; Ex-<lb/>cused, 2.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">This brings to a close the unpleasant review we have felt it<lb/>
                our duty to make. It is matter of painful notoriety, that<lb/> during the long
                sojourn of <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> among us, his personal<lb/> and official
                career has been signalized by repeated outbreaks<lb/> similar to those already
                sketched. Our business, however, has<lb/> been with him as a Hazan, and not as a
                man, and it has been<lb/> no part of our purpose to dilate upon the numerous
                objections<lb/> to his personal deportment, they will readily occur to all who<lb/>
                know him; and his best friends are always obliged to admit,<lb/> that he is an
                indiscreet, imprudent man. It is certain that he<lb/> never loved his congregation,
                and in turn they could not love<lb/> him. His office was a respectable one, the
                salary liberal, and</p>
            <pb n="18"/>
            <p rend="align(center)">18</p>
            <p>his position one that would have enabled him, if rightly dis-<lb/>posed, to have done
                much for his flock, and for the Jewish com-<lb/>munity. That the congregation has
                flourished, in spite of their<lb/> past withering connexion with him, is to be
                attributed to the<lb/> high respectability of the members, and seat-holders
                generally,<lb/> the good dispositions of the elective officers, and the
                influences<lb/> of education upon the rising generation.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">But the connexion between <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> and the
                congregation<lb/> is ended—severed by his own involuntary act. His errors were<lb/>
                fatal, but might have remained unnoticed but for the ceaseless<lb/> attacks of
                himself and his friends upon the congregation and<lb/> its officers, rendering
                necessary this review of his official career,<lb/> and shewing, as it must, to ever
                unprejudiced mind, that the<lb/> minister, and not the congregation, has been
                invariably in the<lb/> wrong. It is hoped that this exampled will be a salutary
                one,<lb/> and that his successor will learn that he will best promote a LIFE<lb/>
                TENURE of office by a single-minded and faithful discharge of<lb/> his duties—by
                obedience to the constituted authorities in the<lb/> exercise of their legitimate
                functions—by deferences to the will<lb/> of the majority—by non-interference in the
                business proceed-<lb/>ings of the congregation—and by cultivating kindly
                feelings<lb/> and agreeable intercourse with the members. This line of<lb/> conduct
                will be appreciated, and the connexion between the<lb/> Pastor and his flock will be
                happy and instructive, bringing<lb/> back the agreeable reminiscences of the earlier
                days of the<lb/> congregation.</p>
