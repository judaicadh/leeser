				<p rend="align(center)">REVIEW.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The late controversies between the <persName>Rev. Isaac Leeser</persName>&#44; <hi rend="italics">Hazan</hi><lb/> of the congregation Mikveh Israel in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>&#44; and the offi&#45;<lb/>cers and members of that body&#44; are now brought to a close&#44; by<lb/> the voluntary withdrawal of the former&#44; and his authorized<lb/> announcement that he will not be a candidate for re&#45;election.<lb/>  At the same time&#44; <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> and his friends are endeavoring<lb/> to make an impression that he is an ill&#45;used man&#59; and many<lb/> well&#45;disposed persons&#44; in ignorance of the facts&#44; have brought<lb/> themselves to believe that the congregation have treated him<lb/> badly.  To correct these erroneous impressions&#44; and to diffuse<lb/> the light of truth&#44; is the object of this publication.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">It is proposed to give the reader a brief review of the late con&#45;<lb/>troversies between <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> and the congregation&#44; which&#44; if<lb/> read without prejudice or passion&#44; but with a sincere desire to<lb/> arrive at the truth&#44; will satisfy any candid person not only how<lb/> groundless are the complaints of the reverend gentleman&#44; but<lb/> that the congregation and its officers are the parties aggrieved&#44;<lb/> and&#44; under the repeated provocations they have received from<lb/> him&#44; have manifested no small degree of forbearance.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">It is not a pleasant duty to be under the necessity of putting<lb/> such matters in print&#59; but as <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> has not hesitated<lb/> editorially to review and censure the congregation through the<lb/> columns of a periodical&#44; he cannot complain if those aggrieved<lb/> by his course shall seek&#44; through the Press&#44; to disabuse the minds<lb/> of the members of our congregation and our co&#45;religionists else&#45;<lb/>where.</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">4</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The principal subjects of dispute between him and the con&#45;<lb/>gregation were threefold.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">1. That he insisted upon being elected Hazan for what he<lb/> called during good behaviour&#44;&#8212;or in other words&#44; <hi rend="italics">for life</hi>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">2. His expressed determination not to sign a contract for the<lb/> faithful performance of his duties&#44; as required by the by&#45;laws.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">3. His disrespectful and uncourteous bearing towards the<lb/> officers of the congregation&#44; and towards the congregation them&#45;<lb/>selves.</p>
				<p rend="align(center)">I.</p>
				<p rend="align(center)">AS TO THE TENURE OF THE OFFICE.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The regular <hi rend="italics">Hazanim</hi> of the congregation who preceded <persName>Mr.<lb/> Leeser</persName>&#44; were&#44; the <persName>Rev. Gershom Mendes Seixas</persName>&#44; <persName>Jacob Cohen</persName>&#44;<lb/> <persName>Emanuel Nunes Carvalho</persName>&#44; and <persName>Abraham Israel Keys</persName>&#8212;all men<lb/> of unaffected piety&#44; great moral worth&#44; learned in our laws&#44;<lb/> thorough&#45;bred Portuguese <hi rend="italics">Hazanim</hi>&#44; familiar with all the duties<lb/> of their office&#44; which they so exercised as to deserve and win the<lb/> love and respect of the congregation.  Of them it might truly<lb/> be said&#44; &#8220;There were giants in those days.&#8221;  Yet no one of<lb/> these pious and learned divines was ever elected for life.  Some<lb/> of them held their offices at the will of the congregation&#44; or<lb/> from year to year&#44; and others for limited periods.  Our congre&#45;<lb/>gation always repudiated the life tenure of the office&#44; and the<lb/> correctness of the doctrine is at this time sustained throughout<lb/> the length and breadth of the land.  We have seen State after<lb/> State cast off the life tenure of their Judges&#44; because those Judges<lb/> felt themselves wholly irresponsible&#59; and no matter how gross<lb/> their official or personal misconduct might be&#44; if it was not such<lb/> as to consign them to the Penitentiary&#44; the idea of an impeach&#45;<lb/>ment was a burlesque&#44;&#8212;it seldom or ever amounted to anything.<lb/>  So would it be with any other officer with a like tenure&#59; it is at<lb/> best but frail human nature&#44; and the <sic>sarcedotal</sic> character of the<lb/> office would not tend to make the incumbent less arrogant or<lb/> presuming.  This principle of the limited tenure of office&#44; was<lb/> not first called in requisition towards <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>&#44; but was acted<lb/> on by the congregation before he was born.  The early records</p>
			<pb n="5"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">5</p>
				<p>of the congregation are imperfect&#59; but we all know that the<lb/> good behaviour&#44; or life tenure&#44; was never recognised&#59; and the<lb/> records of the congregation for more than thirty years&#44; shew<lb/> the constant assertion of the opposite principle.  A few extracts<lb/> will shew this&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><date>1815. July 30</date>. At a meeting of the congregation&#44; &#40;<persName>Hyman Marks</persName>&#44; <hi rend="italics">Parnas</hi>&#44;&#41; a<lb/> communication was received from <persName>A. H. Cohen</persName>&#44; offering to serve for one year&#44; or<lb/> from year to year&#44; at &#36;600 per annum&#44; if regularly invested with the office of Hazan&#59;<lb/> but this proposition was refused&#44; the congregation not being willing to consider him<lb/> a regular Hazan.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><date>1815. Oct. 29</date>. The <persName>Rev. E. N. Carvalho</persName> was engaged as Hazan&#44; at a salary of<lb/> &#36;800 per annum&#44; with a dwelling&#45;house&#44; and the usual perquisites.  Nothing was<lb/> said about the term of service.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><date>1824. April 25</date>. <persName>Mr. Hyman Marks</persName> moved that the Committee on the subject of<lb/> a Hazan&#44; should be authorized to engage such person as may be elected by the con&#45;<lb/>gregation at their next meeting&#44; for any term not exceeding two years&#44; at a salary<lb/> not exceeding     per annum&#44; free of perquisites.  While this motion was under<lb/> consideration&#44; the meeting adjourned until <date>May 2</date>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><date>1824. May 2</date>. This resolution was adopted&#44; and the blank filled with &#36;700.  <persName>Mr.<lb/> A. M. Cohen</persName>&#44; seconded by <persName>Mr. Isaiah Nathans</persName>&#44; moved a reconsideration&#44; so as to<lb/> reduce the term to one year.&#8212;Lost.  The meeting then went into a ballot&#44; when<lb/> <persName>Mr. E. S. Lazarus</persName>&#44; of <placeName>New York</placeName>&#44; was unanimously elected.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><date>1824. May 23</date>. <persName>Mr. Lazarus</persName> declined the office&#59; but a resolution was adopted&#44;<lb/> authorizing the Committee to engage him on such terms as they shall think proper&#44;<lb/> not exceeding two years.  Carried&#8212;yeas 21&#44; nays 4.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><date>1824. June 6</date>. The Committee reported that <persName>Mr. Lazarus</persName> declined any engage&#45;<lb/>ment&#44; except during good behaviour&#44; and at a fixed salary&#44; and recommended the<lb/> following resolution&#44; which was adopted&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><hi rend="italics">Resolved</hi>&#44; That it is inexpedient to engage any person as a Hazan&#44; except for a<lb/> stated number of years.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><date>1824. June 26</date>. The <persName>Rev. A. I. Keys</persName> was elected Hazan&#59; and after his election&#44;<lb/> a resolution was adopted to take him up for five years&#44; at &#36;1000 per annum&#44; his<lb/> salary to commence from the time of his leaving the <placeName>island of <sic>Barbadoes</sic></placeName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><date>1828. Oct. 26</date>. The death of <persName>Mr. Keys</persName> being announced&#44; resolutions of condo&#45;<lb/>lence were adopted&#44; and the sum of &#36;1000 was voted to his widow.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><date>1829. April 12</date>. The congregation voted a pension of &#36;8 per month to the widow<lb/> of Hazan <persName>Carvalho</persName>&#59; and at the same meeting&#44; the following resolution was adopted&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><hi rend="italics">Resolved</hi>&#44; That the salary which shall be allowed to the Hazan who may be<lb/> elected by his congregation&#44; shall not exceed &#36;1000 per annum&#44; and that his engage&#45;<lb/>ment shall not be for a longer period than five years.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><date>1829. Sept. 6</date>. A ballot being taken&#44; <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> was elected Hazan.  After his<lb/> election&#44; a resolution was passed to engage him for two years&#44; at &#36;800 per annum.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><date>1829. Sept. 20</date>. A letter of acceptance was read from <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>&#44; in high terms<lb/> of compliment&#44; and containing no allusion to the tenure of his office.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><date>1831. May 15</date>. A Committee was appointed to confer with <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> on the<lb/> subject of a re&#45;engagement for a period not exceeding five years&#44; at &#36;800 per annum&#44;<lb/> with power to engage him accordingly.</p>
			<pb n="6"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">6</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><date>1831. Sept. 4</date>. The Committee reported that <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> could not serve at that<lb/> salary&#44; and laid his letter to them before the congregation&#44; when it was</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><hi rend="italics">Resolved</hi>&#44; That the Parnas be requested to engage the services of <persName>I. Leeser</persName> as<lb/> Hazan for the term of five years&#44; at a salary of &#36;1000 per annum.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><date>1836. Sept. 4</date>. A ballot being gone into&#44; <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> was elected Hazan.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><date>1836. Oct. 2</date>. A resolution was passed&#44; fixing his term at one year&#44; at same<lb/> salary.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><date>1837. Sept. 24</date>. <persName>Isaac Leeser</persName> and <persName>Jacques Lyons</persName> presented themselves as candi&#45;<lb/>dates for the office of Hazan.  The following resolution was first adopted&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><hi rend="italics">Resolved</hi>&#44; That the Hazan to be elected shall serve for three years&#44; and at a salary<lb/> of &#36;800 per annum&#44; payable quarterly.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">A ballot was then gone into&#44; and <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> was elected.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><date>1840. May 17</date>. A resolution was adopted to re&#45;engage <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> for ten years<lb/> from <date>September 29&#44; 1840</date>&#44; at &#36;1250 per annum.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><date>1840. Sept. 26</date>. The Committee reported <persName>Mr. Leeser&#39;s</persName> acceptance of his re&#45;<lb/>engagement.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><date>1842. Nov. 20</date>. The Committee on the subject of certain com&#45;<lb/>plaints against the <hi rend="italics">Shohet</hi>&#44; made a report&#44; in which they recom&#45;<lb/>mended that the tenure of his office&#44; which before that time was<lb/> during the pleasure of the congregation&#44; should be turned into<lb/> an annual term.  This report was adopted without a division&#44;<lb/> and&#44; it is believed&#44; unanimously.  The following extracts from<lb/> it are in point&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#8220;A frequent recurrence to elections of their &#91;the congregation&#39;s&#93; officers&#44; is the<lb/> best check upon them&#44; and the best guarantee for good conduct.&#8221;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Again&#8212;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#8220;It has always been the policy of the congregation to elect the Hazan for a stipu&#45;<lb/>lated period&#44; and the principle is the same as to the Shohet.&#8221;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><date>1850. March 24</date>. The following resolution&#44; after many<lb/> amendments were previously disposed of&#44; was adopted&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><hi rend="italics">Resolved</hi>&#44; That a special meeting be held on the <date>third Sunday of June</date> next&#44; for<lb/> the purpose of electing a Hazan to serve for ten years&#44; at a salary of &#36;1300 per an&#45;<lb/>num&#44; if a single man&#44; or &#36;1700 per annum if a married man&#59; that the Hazan so<lb/> elected shall execute a contract similar to the existing one&#44; with this addition&#44; <hi rend="italics">that he</hi><lb/> <hi rend="italics">shall in all things conform to the Jewish law</hi>&#59; and that the Parnas give notice of<lb/> this election in the Asmonean&#44; and such other Jewish publications as he may think<lb/> proper.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Before this resolution was adopted&#44; an unsuccessful effort was<lb/> made to strike out the words&#44; &#8220;for ten years&#44;&#8221; and insert the<lb/> words&#44; &#8220;during good behaviour&#59;&#8221; and pending the discussion of<lb/> this amendment&#44; <persName>Abraham Hart&#44; Esq.</persName>&#44; Parnas&#44; announced from<lb/> the Chair that he was authorized by <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> to state to the<lb/> congregation&#44; that if they adopted any other tenure of office</p>
			<pb n="7"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">7</p>
				<p>than during good behaviour&#44; he would not be a candidate for<lb/> re&#45;election&#59; but adding&#44; in substance&#44; that if he were elected<lb/> during good behaviour&#44; he was willing to hand in a written re&#45;<lb/>signation of his office&#44; to take effect whenever called for by the<lb/> congregation.  He also stated&#44; that <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> was willing to<lb/> remain with the congregation for six months after the expiration<lb/> of his present term&#44; in order to afford them an opportunity of<lb/> selecting a successor.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">From this it will be seen that the congregation acted through&#45;<lb/>out with the utmost good faith in the assertion of a principle<lb/> sound in itself&#44; and peculiarly applicable to the present state of<lb/> society.  The predecessors of <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> acted under it&#59; he<lb/> himself took five engagements under it without complaint on<lb/> that score&#59; and no better evidence of the good disposition of<lb/> the congregation could be shewn than this&#44; that with many pro&#45;<lb/>vocations induced by the reverend gentleman himself&#44; they&#44;<lb/> during five successive terms&#44; retained him for twenty&#45;one years&#44;<lb/> and it is believed that a majority of the members would have<lb/> been willing to have elected him for ten years longer&#44; if the<lb/> other causes of complaint on their part had not induced the<lb/> same state of feeling towards him that he continually appeared<lb/> to manifest towards them.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">He assigned two reasons for insisting on the life tenure&#44; first&#44;<lb/> because the congregation could and ought to trust him&#44; to which<lb/> the answer was obvious&#44; that he also might safely have trusted<lb/> them&#44; the bond that could most closely have bound him and<lb/> them together&#44; would have been on his part&#44; attention and<lb/> fidelity to the duties of his office&#44; courtesy&#44; kindness and good<lb/> feeling towards his flock&#44; and the capacity to think that those<lb/> who differ with him on questions of policy or principle&#44; might<lb/> honestly differ&#44; and that such difference was not of itself an act<lb/> of personal hostility towards him&#59; this line of conduct would<lb/> have ensured him a voluntary and not a coerced life tenure&#44; and<lb/> what is better&#44; would have carried with it the love&#44; respect and<lb/> confidence of those under his pastoral charge.  His other reason<lb/> was this&#44; that most other congregations elected their Hazanim<lb/> for life&#44; and that he being the only exception&#44; would be degraded</p>

The writer is unable to divine<lb/> <persName>Mr. Leeser&#39;s</persName> motive for refusing to obey a plain duty&#59; he did<lb/> not appear to put it upon any footing except a determination<lb/> not to recognize the authority of the Board&#59; with how little<lb/> foundation may be seen by reference to the second section of<lb/> Article first of the Charter of the congregation&#44; setting forth<lb/> that &#8220;the Parnas and Adjunta shall form a Board of Mana&#45;<lb/>gers&#59; they shall be entrusted with the management of the<lb/> affairs of the congregation&#44; they shall see that the provisions of<lb/> this Constitution and of such By&#45;laws as may hereafter be<lb/> adopted are properly observed and administered&#44; they shall have<lb/> the control of the annual income of the Corporation&#44;&#8221; &#38;c.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The next vote of censure came from the congregation on the<lb/> <date>3d of January&#44; 1841</date>&#44; and has been already referred to&#44; it re&#45;<lb/>lated to the Hazan&#39;s disrespectful letter to the Board&#44; and to his<lb/> pertinacious refusal to sign the contract which was declared to<lb/> be the correct and only one.</p>

				<p>set a particularly high value on his English discourses&#44; so much<lb/> so as to render nearly all his official duties subordinate to this<lb/> one engrossing fancy&#59; it was the theme of constant remark in<lb/> what an undignified and unimpressive manner he hurried through<lb/> our beautiful Hebrew ritual&#44; how unintelligibly he mumbled the<lb/> offerings&#44; and with what impatience he bore with any one who he<lb/> thought detained him too long with offerings&#59; this produced on<lb/> the part of himself and his friends repeated attempts to abolish<lb/> the free&#45;will offerings&#59; this subject was often discussed&#44; the<lb/> members having no particular attachment to the system of free&#45;<lb/>will offerings&#44; but looking upon it as a financial measure&#44; did not<lb/> wish to throw away this source of revenue without providing a<lb/> substitute&#44; as the expenses of the congregation were heavy&#59;<lb/> the substitute was tried and failed&#44; and the congregation on<lb/> several occasions refused by decided votes to abolish free&#45;will<lb/> offerings&#59; many other matters might be stated&#44; but they would<lb/> unnecessarily swell this publication&#59; the free&#45;will offerings are<lb/> alluded to in order to elucidate what is to follow.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">It is matter of notoriety that <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>&#44; is the editor and<lb/> publisher of the Occident&#44; a monthly periodical published in this<lb/> city&#44; in which the editorial and communicated articles can be<lb/> distinguished apart with as much facility as in a daily news&#45;<lb/>paper.  In the last <date>October</date> number of this magazine&#44; there ap&#45;<lb/>peared under the editorial head an article too long to publish<lb/> entire&#44; but from which the following extract is given as applica&#45;<lb/>ble to the congregation.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">NEWS ITEMS.&#8212;<placeName>PHILADELPHIA</placeName>.&#8212;At the last annual election of the congrega&#45;<lb/>tion Mikveh Israel&#44; the gentlemen composing last year&#39;s Board were re&#45;elected&#44; <persName>Mr.<lb/> A. Hart</persName> as Parnas&#44; and <persName>Messrs. J. A. Phillips</persName>&#44; <persName>M. Arnold</persName>&#44; <persName>A. S. Wolf</persName>&#44; and <persName>I. J.<lb/> Phillips</persName>&#44; as Adjuntas&#59; <persName>Mr. H. Gratz</persName> was re&#45;elected Treasurer&#44; and <persName>Mr. Simeon W.<lb/> Arnold</persName>&#44; elected Secretary.  We regret at not being able to announce that some whole&#45;<lb/>some legislation with respect to the office of Hazan&#44; and the commutation of the<lb/> money offerings&#44; has not taken place&#59; both the by&#45;laws affecting the subjects not<lb/> having met with the approbation of the members.  They seem to be afflicted with a<lb/> sort of nervousness whenever any measure somewhat new in its tendency is pro&#45;<lb/>posed&#59; they go into meeting with the resolve of the English iron&#45;clad barons&#44; &#8220;not<lb/> to change the laws&#8221; of their order&#44; however useful&#44; expedient&#44; or even necessary the<lb/> measure proposed may be&#44; or however wrong and oppressive the old rule may have<lb/> proved in practice.  At present we do not think it requisite to say more&#59; but a time<lb/> may come&#44; especially if a contingency should arise&#44; which now seems possible enough&#44;</p>
			<pb n="16"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">16</p>
				<p>when we may deem it requisite to appeal to the public judgment for our own justifi&#45;<lb/>cation&#44; when we shall have to lay some circumstances before the people which we<lb/> now mean to let pass in silence&#44; as it is probable that before many months some slight<lb/> changes may be made in an obnoxious law&#59; a consummation devoutly to be wished.<lb/>  Some may believe it imprudent in us to say even this little&#59; but since&#44; as said already&#44;<lb/> it may affect our personal standing in the community&#44; in case that something is not<lb/> done in the premises before the expiration of another year&#44; we hold it right to fore&#45;<lb/>warn our distant friends not to throw any blame on us if we do not submit to a usage<lb/> peculiar to our congregation&#44; although we were twice over&#45;persuaded to do so before<lb/> this.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">There could be no mistake as to the character of the article.<lb/>  <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> undertook to hold up the congregation to public cen&#45;<lb/>sure&#44; because they would not abolish free&#45;will offerings&#44; and pass<lb/> a very ridiculous by&#45;law which had been offered by a member&#44;<lb/> but was believed to have been framed by himself&#59; and it is not<lb/> difficult to understand his threat of appealing to the public in<lb/> case the congregation refused to elect him for life&#44; or dispense<lb/> with the Bond.  He himself&#44; a professed opponent of innova&#45;<lb/>tions and reforms&#44; could see no sincerity in his congregation<lb/> thinking on that subject as he did&#59; and his sneering expression&#44;<lb/> &#8220;that they seem to be afflicted with a sort of nervousness&#44;&#8221; was<lb/> in the very worst spirit.  His allusion to the iron&#45;clad Barons<lb/> was&#44; as was afterwards remarked by a member in debate&#44; &#8220;sin&#45;<lb/>gularly unfortunate&#44; as those old feudal Barons were&#44; in the early<lb/> days of <placeName>England</placeName>&#44; the conservators of the public liberty&#44; who<lb/> resisted <persName>King John</persName> at <placeName>Runymede</placeName>&#44; and wrung from the reluctant<lb/> tyrant MAGNA CHARTA.  Their memorable declaration&#8212;<lb/> THAT THEY WOULD NOT CHANGE THE LAWS OF THE REALM&#44; was a<lb/> bold defiance to the power of PRIESTCRAFT&#44; that endeavoured<lb/> to force on them a portion of the canon law tending to licenti&#45;<lb/>ousness and immorality.&#8221;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">It is not to be supposed that the constituted authorities of the<lb/> congregation would pass over in silence an article like this&#59; ab&#45;<lb/>solute impunity would have only emboldened him&#44; and the future<lb/> numbers of the Occident would have teemed with similar attacks<lb/> upon the congregation.  Accordingly&#44; a Board meeting was<lb/> held on <date>October 21&#44; 1849</date>&#44; when the whole Board were present&#44;<lb/> consisting of <persName>A. Hart&#44; Esq.</persName>&#44; <hi rend="italics">Parnas</hi>&#59; <persName>J. A. Phillips</persName>&#44; <persName>M. Ar&#45;<lb/>nold</persName>&#44; <persName>A. S. Wolf</persName>&#44; and <persName>I. J. Phillips</persName>&#44; Adjunta.  The following</p>
			<pb n="17"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">17</p>
				<p>preamble and resolutions&#44; offered by <persName>J. A. Phillips</persName>&#44; and seconded<lb/> by <persName>I. J. Phillips</persName>&#44; were unanimously adopted&#44; the whole five<lb/> members voting for them&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">WHEREAS&#44; There appeared in the last number of the Occident&#8212;a periodical pub&#45;<lb/>lished here by the Hazan of this congregation&#8212;an editorial article&#44; reviewing&#44; in<lb/> terms of censure&#44; the business proceedings of the congregation&#44; and containing a<lb/> threat to appeal to the public&#44; unless certain things were done which the editor wishes<lb/> done&#58; And whereas&#44; such misconduct on the part of an officer of the congregation&#44;<lb/> deserves the severest animadversion and reproof.  Therefore&#8212;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><hi rend="italics">Resolved</hi>&#44; That it is the opinion of this Board&#44; that the conduct of the <persName>Rev. Isaac<lb/> Leeser</persName> in the premises&#44; is highly censurable&#44; as tending to provoke irritation&#44; create<lb/> bad feeling&#44; and as interfering in matters with which he hath no rightful concern.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><hi rend="italics">Resolved</hi>&#44; That his threat to appeal to the public&#44; shews an absence of the good<lb/> feeling that should exist on the part of the Reader towards his congregation.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><hi rend="italics">Resolved</hi>&#44; That the Parnas transmit a copy of this preamble and these resolutions<lb/> to <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>&#44; and also report the same to the congregation at their next meeting.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">This preamble and these resolutions were officially communi&#45;<lb/>cated to <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>&#59; who never to the Board or congregation<lb/> offered any explanation&#44; palliation&#44; or apology.  They were laid<lb/> before the congregation on the <date>24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of March&#44; 1850</date>&#44; and would<lb/> have been read&#44; and filed away in silence&#44; and without further<lb/> action&#44; but for an onslaught on the Board&#44; made by one or two<lb/> of the Hazan&#39;s indiscreet friends.  This brought the members<lb/> to their feet&#44; and the following resolution was adopted&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><hi rend="italics">Resolved</hi>&#44; That the action of the Board be approved.&#8212;Yeas&#44; 20&#59; Nays&#44; 7&#59; Ex&#45;<lb/>cused&#44; 2.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">This brings to a close the unpleasant review we have felt it<lb/> our duty to make.  It is matter of painful notoriety&#44; that<lb/> during the long sojourn of <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> among us&#44; his personal<lb/> and official career has been signalized by repeated outbreaks<lb/> similar to those already sketched.  Our business&#44; however&#44; has<lb/> been with him as a Hazan&#44; and not as a man&#44; and it has been<lb/> no part of our purpose to dilate upon the numerous objections<lb/> to his personal deportment&#44; they will readily occur to all who<lb/> know him&#59; and his best friends are always obliged to admit&#44;<lb/> that he is an indiscreet&#44; imprudent man.  It is certain that he<lb/> never loved his congregation&#44; and in turn they could not love<lb/> him.  His office was a respectable one&#44; the salary liberal&#44; and</p>
			<pb n="18"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">18</p>
				<p>his position one that would have enabled him&#44; if rightly dis&#45;<lb/>posed&#44; to have done much for his flock&#44; and for the Jewish com&#45;<lb/>munity.  That the congregation has flourished&#44; in spite of their<lb/> past withering connexion with him&#44; is to be attributed to the<lb/> high respectability of the members&#44; and seat&#45;holders generally&#44;<lb/> the good dispositions of the elective officers&#44; and the influences<lb/> of education upon the rising generation.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">But the connexion between <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> and the congregation<lb/> is ended&#8212;severed by his own involuntary act.  His errors were<lb/> fatal&#44; but might have remained unnoticed but for the ceaseless<lb/> attacks of himself and his friends upon the congregation and<lb/> its officers&#44; rendering necessary this review of his official career&#44;<lb/> and shewing&#44; as it must&#44; to ever unprejudiced mind&#44; that the<lb/> minister&#44; and not the congregation&#44; has been invariably in the<lb/> wrong.  It is hoped that this exampled will be a salutary one&#44;<lb/> and that his successor will learn that he will best promote a LIFE<lb/> TENURE of office by a single&#45;minded and faithful discharge of<lb/> his duties&#8212;by obedience to the constituted authorities in the<lb/> exercise of their legitimate functions&#8212;by deferences to the will<lb/> of the majority&#8212;by non&#45;interference in the business proceed&#45;<lb/>ings of the congregation&#8212;and by cultivating kindly feelings<lb/> and agreeable intercourse with the members.  This line of<lb/> conduct will be appreciated&#44; and the connexion between the<lb/> Pastor and his flock will be happy and instructive&#44; bringing<lb/> back the agreeable reminiscences of the earlier days of the<lb/> congregation.</p>
