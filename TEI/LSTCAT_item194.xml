				<p rend="align(right)"><hi rend="underline">Tal. 2.</hi></p>
				<p><add>Hebrew</add></p>
				<p>God is the most perfect existence&#44; therefore <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> no <sic>altaretion</sic> can be thought in his divine Character for<lb/> every <sic>altaretion</sic> is a proof of imperfection.</p>
				<p>By that prim we learn&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">a Hymns and praises so the Living God shall be the chief<lb/> apart&#44; prayers of supplication and respontenie<add>&#63;</add> the second and<lb/> <sic>smaler</sic> part of our liturgy.  The Talmud itself is of this meaning</p>
				<p><add>Hebrew</add></p>
				<p>Purer words in that reference said the orthodox <add>Hebrew</add>.</p>
				<p>After reverend gentleman said the opinion of the Talmud&#44; he<lb/> expressed his view about it&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The chief precept of our Religion is&#58; to be holy&#44; that<lb/> is&#58; so love God&#44; for this is holiness.  Inferior so this<lb/> precept is&#58; to acknowledge God&#44; expressed in the first command<lb/>ment of the revelation.  If we acknowledge God&#44; we love him<lb/> and are holy.  Our Holy Thora is the guide to the summit<lb/> of this divine Dea<add>&#63;</add>.  Philanthropy&#44; kindness and mercy to every<lb/> creature both living and lifeless&#44; rectitude for the whole human<lb/> race&#44; a powerful dominion above ourselves as well as above nature are<lb/> the ways&#44; which our Thora teaches us&#44; to acknowledge the invisible<lb/> Deity by his divine attributes.  Be as kind and <sic>mercyful</sic> as our<lb/> Thora will it&#44; thus Gods benevolence is displayed unto you &#38;<lb/> but <del>who</del> total you will never acknowledge him <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> But yet a way shows no us our Thora to aim this holy end&#44; and this<lb/> way is the prayer&#44; and therefore is it the most perfect services</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>because it guides directly to acknowledging of God&#44; as our<lb/> Thora said&#58; <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> &#40;<add>Hebrew</add>&#41; If our prayers be Hymns and praises&#44; the<lb/> subjective effect is a direct display of God&#39;s divine character<lb/> but if our prayers are supplanting or reporting our own foo&#45;<lb/>lishness or <sic>weekness</sic> are the direct&#44; and God&#39;s omnipotence and<lb/> mercy the indirect display.  Therefore hymns are the former<lb/> and prayers the latter part of our service.</p>
				<p><hi rend="underline">b</hi> If the effect of prayer is subjective&#44; we want in them<lb/> no mediation between God and man&#44; neither of the angels nor<lb/> of other spiritual beings.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><add>Hebrew</add></p>
				<p>It is said in the Talmud <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> The <add>Hebrew</add> and the <add>Hebrew</add> are throughout against the mediation<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> This is the sublime character of our Religion&#44; displaying<lb/> us the purest and most perfect notion of God&#44; of the features<lb/> of his holy existence&#59; guiding us the way to his perfection&#44;<lb/> she also represents us the possible perfection of man by<lb/> the precepts of the revelation&#44; for only to his likeness can<lb/> God speak&#59; by the precepts.  In the Likeness of God in his own<lb/> image the man was created&#44; sons are you to the Living God&#44;<lb/> our holy doctrine taught us the perfection of the human <add>&#63;</add><lb/> that the man is the next intellectual being to God&#44; he is his<lb/> son&#44; that he can acknowledge God and serve him without one<lb/> mediation.  No religion in the whole world possesses those high<lb/> terms of truth&#44; trust and eternal hopes.  The Psalmist was<lb/> inspired by those Deas and sung so lovely <add>Hebrew</add>.<lb/>  But those high notions make us very easily proud or haughty&#44;<lb/> therefore we need to be <sic>remined</sic> of our foolishness&#44; meekness&#44;<lb/> transitoriness&#44; invalidity and nullity&#44; that shall be done<lb/> by our prayers of supplication and <sic>repentence</sic>&#44; and not<lb/> by the notion of the mediation &#40;that was the first reason of it&#41;<lb/> for this is an Sea guise strangely to our holy Religion.</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p><hi rend="underline">C</hi> If the effect of our prayers shall be subjective&#44; our<lb/> service ought to be in the <sic>hebrew</sic> language&#8212;for<lb/> this language is the tongue of our Prophets&#44; of our<lb/> solemn Psalmists&#44; the tongue of our holy scripture.<lb/>  yea&#44; the mere <sic>soun</sic> of those words awake our heart<lb/> to a holier feeling and higher inspiration&#44; to a<lb/> sublime admiration of the most High.  There exists no<lb/> language&#44; that possesses a character so sublime and ador<lb/>ing&#44; simple and short&#44; easy and living&#44; this is the<lb/> best vehicle of our thoughts before God.  And again&#44;<lb/> no poetry had so aft and manifold the Deity to her<lb/> object&#44; nor sung so solemnly the attributes and perfections<lb/> of God&#44; as the <sic>hebrew</sic> did&#59; there is no poetry possessing<lb/> those riches of natural picturesque and scenery&#44; which breath<lb/> love and admiration in the heart.  Those sentimental<lb/> <del>sentim</del> sentences of the prophets&#44; those <sic>conserated</sic> and deeply<lb/> felt words of the holy Scripture are the best vehicle <del>&#63;</del><lb/> to adore our God.  And again we ought to understand the<lb/> words of our heart&#44; and where is the son of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; who<lb/> understands not the language of his Thora&#63;  If some<lb/> should be so unhappy to be ignorant in the word of his<lb/> holy book&#44; they may weep and study&#44; as our ancestors did<lb/> in the time of <persName>Esra</persName>&#44; but for the benefit of some we<lb/> can&#39;nt offer the whole</p>
				<p><hi rend="underline">D</hi> All those prayers of reaangenie<add>&#63;</add> or curses need to be expelled<lb/> of our liturgy&#44; what subjective effect can we expect of them&#63;<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>.</p>
				<p><hi rend="underline">E</hi> The sabbatical morning&#45;service shall not be continued<lb/> above 2 &#189; or 3 hours including the sermon&#44; and that of the<lb/> festivals not above 3 or 3 &#189; hours &#40;Rabbi did not speak of<lb/> a service without sermon&#41;  It is said in the Talmud&#44; that <persName>Rabbi<lb/> Akiba</persName> and <persName>Rabbi Atarphon</persName> made their prayers<lb/> very short&#44; when they ministered in the Synagogue<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add></p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>&#40;I am afraid the multitude of <add>Hebrew</add> and the sing&#45;sing of <add>Hebrew</add> and<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> shall bad suffer by that&#41;</p>
				<p>Now&#44; my orthodox brother&#44; here are the principles<lb/> of <persName>Rabbi Wise</persName>&#44; according which the new<lb/> liturgy shall appear.  Here is a mount of<lb/> truths&#44; of Information and conviction&#44; there is<lb/> Tara and Philosophy going hand in hand.  What<lb/> can in right be said against those truths&#63; nothing&#44;<lb/> but so wish the whole liturgy may be to consequence<lb/> of those principles&#44; that all the congregations of<lb/> <placeName>Israel</placeName> may adore our God according to those principles&#44;<lb/> and the new liturgy may be successful to unite<lb/> <placeName>Israel</placeName> in <placeName>Amerika</placeName> into one great body</p>

				<p>a hundred times&#44; without ever to reason or to think on<lb/> any one subject&#59; therefore I bid a farewell to <sic>jewish</sic><lb/> literature&#44; to <sic>jewish</sic> quarrels&#44; to <sic>jewish</sic> struggles&#44; and<lb/> threw my whole force upon profane sciences&#44; and I<lb/> shall in a month or two try my fortune as a<lb/> philosophic author&#44; <hi rend="underline">an Essay on immortality</hi> with<lb/> physical evidences I have nearly finished&#44; and it<lb/> will be published right of&#59; if I am not more<lb/> fortunate as a philosophical author than I was<lb/> as a rabbi&#44; I shall compile spelling books for<lb/> little children or till the ground to earn a living and<lb/> let humbuggers be ministers&#44; teachers&#44; professors&#44;<lb/> authors or whatever they chose to be.  This may excuse<lb/> for not having done what I <sic>promissed</sic>.</p>
				<p>You remembered me or the school of <placeName>Padua</placeName>&#44; and<lb/> that is the most serious wound in my heart&#44; which<lb/> you could touch&#59; first all the proud hopes&#44; which<lb/> I there entertained&#44; which I see now fade away came<lb/> some more&#44; in my mind&#59; secondly it grieves me<lb/> very much&#44; that our <sic>american</sic> <sic>jews</sic> could not come<lb/> up to the great idea of establishing such a school&#59;<lb/> and third&#44; it grieves me seriously to know&#44; what<lb/> pure Judaism I studied there and what a corrupted<lb/> one we have here.</p>

			<p rend="indent(1)">Dear Sir</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">Your favor of the <date>12.</date> ins. was duly<lb/> received&#44; and I take pleasure in answering you instantly.<lb/>  You find the best account about the school of <placeName>Padua</placeName> in<lb/> <persName>Dr. I.

As to the statement of <persName>Hollam</persName> that<lb/> <date>1350</date> be the date of its foundation I have to observe&#44; that<lb/> this is by no means correct&#59; for if he refers to the<lb/> rabbinic&#45;cabalistic school&#44; which once was a <placeName>Padua</placeName> and<lb/> which was the foundation of the present one&#44; we could<lb/> show him in the different prefaces of rabbinical and<lb/> cabalistic treatises that this school existed already in<lb/> the <date>10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century</date>&#44; as you will find in <persName>Josts</persName>&#59; and the<lb/> present one was founded by exiles from <placeName>Spain</placeName>&#44; or<lb/> rather the old one was gradually converted into a<lb/> scientific institute by those intelligent <sic>spanish</sic> <sic>jews</sic>&#44;<lb/> which was at the commencement of the <date>15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century</date>.<lb/>  Were I not too much employed otherwise I would fur<lb/>nish you with a sketch&#59; but I think it is too interesting<lb/> as that you should allow one to do it for you.</p>
				<p>You will be kind enough to excuse me&#44; that I would not<lb/> write any thing about <sic>jewish</sic> <sic>juris prudence</sic>&#59; I retired<lb/> altogether from the field of <sic>jewish</sic> literature for various<lb/> reasons. I was beaten every way and with all sorts of<lb/> rods&#59; I was decried by all sorts of fanatics&#44; fools&#44; ignorants&#44;<lb/> <add>&#63;</add>&#59; I was rejected&#44; abused wherever I opened the door&#59;<lb/> I found that men as <persName>Mr. Isaac</persName>&#44; <persName>Mr. Lyon</persName>&#44; <persName>Mr. Rosen&#45;<lb/>feld</persName>&#44; and others&#44; who have knowledge enough to read<lb/> the prayers and humbug the world with an assumed<lb/> bigotry&#44; with some dozens of every day sentences&#44; which<lb/> they compile to a sort of speech&#44; and repeat them</p>
			<pb n="9"/>
				<p>I hope to give to the world a history of our nation&#44; which<lb/> will fully show the important position of <placeName>Israel</placeName> among the<lb/> nations.  You see&#44; my dear sir&#44; that I did not yet think how<lb/> to publish it&#44; as I was not sure of success&#59; but now I<lb/> have made my plan to this effect.  As soon as the number<lb/> of subscribers is important enough&#44; I shall publish the<lb/> first volume reaching to the destruction of the first<lb/> temple.  I shall first offer the business to <persName>Mr. Hart</persName> of<lb/> <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>&#59; because he&#44; being an Israelite&#44; feels more in<add>&#63;</add><lb/> in the matter than other publishers.  If we cannot agree<lb/> on the terms for I have about &#36;1500&#44;00 expenses for books<lb/> necessary to the purpose&#8212;then I thought of going to <persName>Harpen</persName><lb/> or another publisher.  If I can agree with none I publish<lb/> it myself for my subscribers only&#59; for them&#44; after the work<lb/> will be completed&#44; I am sure every publisher will buy the<lb/> copy right.  It will remain a standard work for the next<lb/> 25 years.  This is my intention&#44; and I see in your letter&#44;<lb/> it will meet with your approbation.</p>
				<p>I wish&#44; you would be kind enough&#44; to let me have your<lb/> corrections on the Jurisprudence of the Israelites.</p>
				<p>Please to accept of my assurance of my best respect.</p>
