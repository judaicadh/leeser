			<p rend="indent(1)">When men throw their private quarrels before the public&#44;<lb/> they cease to be private&#44; and that public to whom the appeal is<lb/> manifestly made&#44; has the right to approve or disapprove&#44; as facts<lb/> may demand.  It is this feeling which prompts me to examine<lb/> the controversy&#44; and through the Press&#44; to proclaim the opinion<lb/> of an humble&#44; but disinterested Israelite.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">There are but few occurrences in life which may not be pro&#45;<lb/>ductive of good&#44; and I can but trust that&#44; though a good man may<lb/> be sacrificed to the malice of his enemies&#44; yet that this controver<lb/>sy between <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>&#44; and the <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> congregation<lb/> Mickve Israel&#44; will be productive of the happiest results&#44; by im&#45;<lb/>pressing the minds of the Jews of <placeName>America</placeName> with the necessity<lb/> of elevating the Priesthood&#44; of making them Teachers of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44;<lb/> not the mere hirelings of a moment&#44; the pliant tools of a Parnas<lb/> and Adjunta&#44; who may&#44; or may not be fit to rule.  The paths of<lb/> duty of the two are entirely distinct.  The Parnas and Adjunta<lb/> should manage the temporal concerns of the congregation&#44; whilst<lb/> the Priest&#44; or Hazan should teach&#44; guide&#44; control&#44; and direct the<lb/> congregation.  How can he be a Teacher unless he have power<lb/> in <hi rend="italics">all things</hi> pertaining to his office&#63;  How can he rebuke sin in<lb/> high places&#44; perhaps the very sins of his petty tyrants&#44; when he<lb/> is powerless&#44; the mere servant of these very men&#63;  The idea&#44;<lb/> then of making a Hazan a bonded officer&#44; and of forcing him<lb/> to obtain leave of the Parnas before he may deliver a moral dis&#45;<lb/>course&#44; or perform the marriage or burial service&#44; is altogether<lb/> repugnant to a just conception of his proper position&#44; and whilst<lb/> such an idea obtains&#44; he is no Teacher&#44; no head of the flock&#44; but a</p>

				<p>mere tool and an underling.  Any rule therefore which requires<lb/> a Teacher in <placeName>Israel</placeName> to give a bond for the performance of his du&#45;<lb/>ties&#8212;a bond&#44; forsooth&#44; that he shall be &#8220;<hi rend="italics">devout&#8221;&#33;&#33;&#33;</hi>&#8212;is a dis&#45;<lb/>grace to the congregation&#44; and at war with the spirit of the age.<lb/>  Our Priests should &#8220;be clothed with righteousness&#44;&#8221; men of<lb/> character&#44; and able to teach and control their flock.  The Hazan<lb/> should be elected as <persName>Mr. Carvallo</persName> was elected in <date>1815</date>&#8212; &#8220;<hi rend="italics">noth&#45;</hi><lb/> <hi rend="italics">ing being said about the term of office.</hi>&#8221;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">These remarks bring me directly to the pamphlet under con&#45;<lb/>sideration.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">As regards &#8220;the regular <hi rend="italics">Hazanim</hi> who preceded <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>&#44;&#8221;<lb/> I have nothing to say&#8212;comparisons are odious&#8212;they may have<lb/> been intellectual &#8220;giants.&#8221;  I take it for granted&#44; that they were<lb/> undoubtedly men of worth&#8212;perhaps the superiors of <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>.<lb/>  I repeat I will institute no comparisons&#44; but this much I will say&#44;<lb/> that in our day and generation&#44; <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> stands in<lb/> the general good that he has done in <placeName>America</placeName>&#44; and those very<lb/> &#8220;English discourses&#8221; so <sic>delightingly</sic> spoken of in the pamphlet<lb/> under review&#44; have done more to exalt the Jewish name in<lb/> <placeName>America</placeName>&#44; to awaken a spirit of piety among our people&#44; to<lb/> breathe life&#44; and spiritually into our religion&#44; than the ritual could<lb/> do in a thousand years&#44; however dignified&#44; and impressively it<lb/> may have been said.  And here&#44; too&#44; I may remark&#44; it is strange<lb/> that if <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> has for years&#44; hurried through our beautiful<lb/> ritual in &#8220;an undignified&#44; and unimpressive manner&#44;&#8221; that he<lb/> should have been retained as Hazan for more than twenty years&#44;<lb/> have been <hi rend="italics">five</hi> times elected&#44; and &#8220;that a majority of the mem&#45;<lb/>bers would have been willing to have elected him for ten years<lb/> longer.&#8221;  Alas&#33;  I fear the writer spoke from his prejudices&#44;<lb/> rather than his judgment.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">At Page 6 of the pamphlet&#44; we are told that &#8220;the Committee<lb/> on the subject of certain complaints against the <hi rend="italics">Shochet</hi> made a<lb/> report in which they recommended that the tenure of his office&#44;<lb/> which before that time&#44; was during the pleasure of the congre&#45;<lb/>gation&#44; should be turned into an annual term&#8221;&#8212;and again&#8212;&#8220;it<lb/> has always been the policy of the congregation to elect the Ha&#45;<lb/>zan for a stipulated period&#44; and the principle is the same as to the</p>

				<p rend="align(center)">A REVIEW.</p>
				<p>Shochet.&#8221;  What&#33; are the Shochet and the Hazan to be compar&#45;<lb/>ed&#63;  Are there no distinctions in society&#63; no grades in the va&#45;<lb/>rious callings of life&#63;  Do the butcher and the Minister of God&#8212;<lb/> the baker&#44; and the lawyer&#8212;the blacksmith&#44; and the physician<lb/> stand on the same platform&#63;  Politically they are equal&#44; but no<lb/> farther.  My minister&#44; my spiritual guide and teacher&#44; must be<lb/> my equal socially and otherwise&#44; or he can not have a proper and<lb/> controlling influence over me.  My butcher&#44; or Shochet&#44; may be<lb/> an honest man&#8212;I may respect him as such&#44; but he can not be a<lb/> companion for me&#44; or my family.  And I am sure I hazard<lb/> nothing in saying that the Hazan&#44; and Shochet of the congrega&#45;<lb/>tion&#44; do&#44; and will ever&#44; occupy very different stations in the minds<lb/> of all right thinking people in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>&#44; and every where else.<lb/>  The comparison therefore&#44; does not hold good&#8212;there is no analogy<lb/> in the duties of Hazan and Shochet&#44; and the rules governing the<lb/> one&#44; would be inapplicable to the other.  The one is the highest<lb/> and holiest calling to which man can devote the energies of his<lb/> mind&#44; the other a mere physical duty&#44; which any one may per&#45;<lb/>form&#59; requiring neither mind nor morals&#44; beyond that morality<lb/> which impels my barber&#44; or tailor to do his work faithfully.&#8212;<lb/>  When therefore&#44; a candidate for the office of Hazan is a strang&#45;<lb/>er to a congregation&#44; it is perhaps well to take him for a limited<lb/> period on trial&#44; and afterwards he should be elected&#44; and have<lb/> nothing &#8220;<hi rend="italics">said about the term of service.</hi>&#8221;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The Judge&#39;s tenure&#44; <hi rend="italics">dum bene se gesserint</hi>&#44; may&#44; or may not<lb/> be proper&#8212;but again&#44; there is no analogy between these offices.<lb/>  The life tenure of the Judge was created as a protection to the<lb/> liberties of the people.  If he held his office at the will of a ty&#45;<lb/>rant&#44; he would pander to the tyrants pleasures&#8212;but again I see<lb/> no analogy between these offices.  If the writer really desired<lb/> an analogous case&#44; he should have referred to the Christian<lb/> Preacher&#44; or the Jewish Priests of former days.  Are&#44; or were&#44;<lb/> these elected from year to year&#63;  Do&#44; or did they give bonds&#44;<lb/> with money penalties for their good behaviour&#44; for their &#8220;devout<lb/> manner&#63;&#8221;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">This idea of annual&#44; or decennial elections&#44; and of making the<lb/> Hazan a bonded officer&#44; finds no sanction in the habits of the</p>

				<p>Jews in the palmy days of their nationality&#8212;none in the present<lb/> practice of the Christian world.  For our sins we are dispersed<lb/> over the whole world.  We have no temple&#8212;no regularly God&#45;<lb/>appointed Priesthood&#44; but if we desire our Hazanim&#44; teachers in<lb/> <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; men of worth&#44; and piety&#44; and really spiritual guides&#44; we<lb/> must elevate the Ministry&#59; we must draw a distinction between<lb/> things sacred and profane&#44; we must raise our Hazan above our<lb/> Shochet.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">But let us pass on to Page 8&#44; where we are told that <persName>Mr. Lee&#45;<lb/>ser</persName> &#8220;was willing to hold himself out to the world as elected for<lb/> life&#44; and yet take the office under a secret written engagement<lb/> with the congregation&#44; converting its tenure into a <sic>tenantcy</sic> at<lb/> will&#44; subject to be determined at any time by a bare majority<lb/> vote&#59; which was the more degrading position&#44; an open honorable<lb/> engagement for ten years&#44; or a false representation to the world&#44;<lb/> of an engagement for life&#44; with the reality of a secret under&#45;<lb/>standing that it was but a tenure at will&#63;  The congregation re&#45;<lb/>fused to become a party to such a hypocritical proceeding.&#8221;&#8212;<lb/>Now I appeal to any candid man&#44; and ask if such language is<lb/> proper&#44; if the writer &#40;as he states on his first page&#41; really de&#45;<lb/>sired to diffuse the light of truth&#44;&#8221; and &#8220;to give a brief review<lb/> of the late controversies between <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> and the congre&#45;<lb/>gation&#63;&#8221;  Is this language supported by the <hi rend="italics">facts</hi> of the case&#44;<lb/> or rather&#44; is it not&#44; manifestly&#44; the outpourings of bitterness&#44; and<lb/> prejudice&#63;  <hi rend="italics">Let the pamphlet itself&#44; answer these questions.</hi>  At<lb/> Page 6&#44; we find &#8220;that <persName>Abraham Hart&#44; Esq.</persName>&#44; Parnas&#44; announced<lb/> from the Chair&#44; that he was authorized by <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> to state to<lb/> the congregation&#44; that if they adopted any other tenure of office&#44;<lb/> than during good behavior&#44; he would not be a candidate for re&#45;<lb/>election&#44; but adding in substance&#44; that if he were elected during<lb/> good behavior&#44; he was willing to hand in a written resignation of<lb/> his office&#44; to take effect whenever called for by the congregation.&#8221;<lb/>  Was this any thing like &#8220;a secret written engagement&#63;&#8221;  Was<lb/> this a false representation to the world&#63;  Did not <persName>Mr. Hart</persName><lb/> proclaim it aloud&#44; before the assembly&#44; over which he presided&#63;<lb/>  Was it not known to the writer of the pamphlet&#44; who is mani&#45;<lb/>festly no friend of <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>&#59; and can any one justly call this</p>

				<p>A REVIEW.</p>
				<p>a &#8220;secret engagement&#44;&#8221; &#8220;a false representation&#44;&#8221; &#8220;a hypocriti&#45;<lb/>cal proceeding&#63;&#8221;  The truth is&#44; <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> assumed the true<lb/> ground.  The ground on which <persName>Mr. Carvalho&#39;s</persName> election was<lb/> placed.  The ground taken by <persName>Mr. Lazarus</persName> in <date>1824</date>&#44; and the<lb/> ground which I trust&#44; will hereafter be taken by every Hazan<lb/> in <placeName>America</placeName>.  The tenure of the office of Hazan should be at<lb/> will.  He should be bound to his congregation&#44; and they to him&#44;<lb/> by the bonds of love&#44; and not of money penalties&#59; and he should<lb/> serve no longer than was mutually agreeable&#44; for no longer could<lb/> he be useful.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Let us <hi rend="italics">test this idea</hi> of making the Hazan a bonded officer&#44;<lb/> for limited periods&#44; say five&#44; or ten years&#44; and to do this&#44; let us<lb/> examine the terms and character of the articles of agreement&#44;<lb/> which may be found at Page 10&#44; of the pamphlet.  The Hazan<lb/> agrees to serve and officiate for ten years&#44; during which time&#44; he<lb/> is to perform the duties of the station&#8212;these duties are subse&#45;<lb/>quently defined&#44; viz&#58; on <date>Sabbaths</date> and Holy days&#44; to read the<lb/> prayers in devout manner in the original Hebrew.  To attend<lb/> funerals &#38;c&#58; to support and abide by&#44; and obey the Charter<lb/> and Bye&#45;Laws&#44; and obey the legal orders of the Parnas.  In<lb/> consideration of said services&#44; the congregation agrees to pay<lb/> &#36;1200 per ann. during the ten years in quarterly payments.  And<lb/> for the due performance of the covenants&#44; each party &#40;Hazan<lb/> and congregation&#41; binds himself in the penal sum of one thou&#45;<lb/>sand dollars.  Now as the covenant has <hi rend="italics">expressed precisely</hi>&#44; what<lb/> each party is to do&#44; no more could be claimed in law&#44; or morals&#44;<lb/> than what is therein expressed.  It is therefore manifest that a<lb/> Hazan under that covenant would be entitled to recover his<lb/> salary&#44; if he read the prayers in Hebrew&#44; on <date>Sabbaths</date> and Holy<lb/> days&#44; attended funerals&#44; &#38;c. &#38;c.&#44; even though he lived in open vi&#45;<lb/>olation of the moral law&#44; and should ascend the <hi rend="italics">tebah</hi> dressed in<lb/> the most fantastic attire.  I do not press this point of my argu&#45;<lb/>ment too far.  When men enter into written contracts&#44; the con&#45;<lb/>tract becomes to them&#44; the law&#44; and they can not go beyond it.<lb/>  <hi rend="italics">Expressio unius&#44; est exclusio alterius</hi>.  Could the congregation<lb/> sue the bond&#44; and <sic>alledge</sic> as a breach the bad moral character of<lb/> the Hazan&#44; or if the Hazan were compelled to sue&#44; would his</p>

				<p>character be allowed in evidence&#63;  Certainly not.  All this re&#45;<lb/>minds me of an anecdote&#44; of which I was personally cognizant.<lb/>  A man presented himself as a candidate for Hazan&#8212;it was re&#45;<lb/>marked that he was flippant in his manners&#44; foppish in his<lb/> dress&#44; and above all&#44; of doubtful moral character.  But said one<lb/> of his advocates&#44; &#8220;have you heard him read&#8212;he has a magnifi&#45;<lb/>cent voice&#44;&#8221; and I suppose he might have added&#44; &#8220;he would<lb/> read our beautiful Hebrew ritual in a dignified and impressive<lb/> manner.&#8221;  Let me not be misunderstood&#8212;I am no reformer&#8212;I<lb/> love and venerate our beautiful Hebrew ritual.  It is a noble lan&#45;<lb/>guage&#8212;it is the mother of languages&#44; and above all&#44; it is sancti&#45;<lb/>fied&#44; by time&#44; and the glorious recollection that it was the lan&#45;<lb/>guage of our Prophets&#44; and our Poet King&#44; and that in it&#44; God<lb/> spoke to his people amid the thunders of <placeName>Sinai</placeName>.  Let it then be<lb/> read in a sonorous voice&#44; and in a dignified&#44; and impressive man&#45;<lb/>ner&#59; but let all this be secondary to the pure character&#44; and moral<lb/> teachings of the Hazan.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">But let us return to the pamphlet.  At page 17 we find that a<lb/> vote of censure by the Adjunta was passed upon the Hazan&#44;<lb/> &#40;<persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>&#41; for an article which he published in the <hi rend="italics">Occident</hi><lb/> of <date>October</date> last.  Now&#44; if anything were wanting to show the<lb/> bitter persecution&#44; and relentless hostility of <persName>Mr. Leeser&#39;s</persName> ene&#45;<lb/>mies&#44; it will be found in this whole affair.  It is marked by a ty&#45;<lb/>ranny and oppression&#44; that&#44; thank God&#44; finds no parallel in our<lb/> country&#44; blessed as it is by free institutions&#44; guaranteeing to every<lb/> one liberty of conscience&#44; and protecting <hi rend="italics">the Liberty of the Press.</hi><lb/>  But this <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> Adjunta&#44; riding above the spirit of the age&#44;<lb/> would trammel the press&#44; and entrenching themselves behind<lb/> the dignity of office&#44; would punish by votes of censure any one<lb/> who would differ from them&#44; or animadvert upon their conduct.<lb/>  <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>&#44; as Hazan&#44; had certain duties to perform&#44; specifical&#45;<lb/>ly set forth in the Bond&#44; and I cannot find among these duties any<lb/> that requires him to consult the Adjunta&#44; as to what articles he<lb/> might write&#44; or that inhibits him from scanning their votes on<lb/> any subject.  But the whole affair seems to me extra&#45;judicial&#8212;<lb/>an assumption of power&#44; and strongly savoring of all the ingre&#45;<lb/>dients of a libel.  The Bond does not make him amenable to the</p>

				<p>Adjunta&#44; except as to marriage and funeral rites&#44; and as he is<lb/> elected by the congregation&#44; it alone should have the power of<lb/> censure.  It is true that in political and national organizations&#44;<lb/> there are tribunals created to try and punish officers and others<lb/> for misdemeanors&#44; but surely a Hazan should be only responsi&#45;<lb/>ble to the congregation&#8212;as the creating power.  It will not avail<lb/> to reply that the congregation approved the action of the Board&#44;<lb/> for no subsequent act can legalize an usurpation&#44; the more espe&#45;<lb/>cially when the rights of a third party are affected.  And besides<lb/> this&#44; it is manifest that though the Adjunta had attempted to<lb/> control and direct public opinion&#44; still the congregation would<lb/> have allowed the resolutions to pass unnoticed&#44; thereby tacitly ap&#45;<lb/>proving the contemptuous silence of <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>&#44; who properly<lb/> disdained to offer &#8220;any explanation&#44; palliation or apology&#44;&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;but<lb/> for an onslaught on the Board made by one or two of the Ha&#45;<lb/>zan&#39;s indiscreet friends.&#8221;  It was the conduct of the &#8220;friends&#8221;<lb/> then&#44; that the congregation animadverted upon&#44; and not the con&#45;<lb/>duct of <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>.  Such being the true version of the affair&#44; the<lb/> congregation committed the injustice of punishing <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName><lb/> for the indiscretion of his friends.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">It is right and proper that we return again to this idea of mak&#45;<lb/>ing the Priest who ministers at the altar of God a bonded officer<lb/> for a specified period of time.

You are bound<lb/> hand and foot together by the harsh chains of a stern agreement&#44;<lb/> and not united by the silken cords of <sic>love.</sic> and the interchange<lb/> of mutual benefits and blessings.  Nor does your Bond with a<lb/> money penalty mend the matter&#8212;it circumscribes the power of<lb/> the Hazan and congregation&#44; and limits their rights to the terms<lb/> of the bond.  Let then our Hazanim &#40;except perhaps when<lb/> strangers to the congregation&#41; be elected without any thing being<lb/> &#8220;said about the term of service&#44;&#8221; and then the majority of the<lb/> congregation may dismiss&#44; or the Hazan retire at pleasure.

				<p>cannot be urged that this may leave a congregation without a<lb/> Hazan&#44; for it cannot&#44; in fairness&#44; be supposed that the connection<lb/> would be dissolved without timely notice.  But even supposing<lb/> the probability of this contingency&#44; or that the Hazan may be<lb/> thrown penniless on the world&#44; still it is far better for both par&#45;<lb/>ties to have the congregation thus arranged&#44; than to have Hazan<lb/> and congregation tied to each other&#44; even after love&#44; respect&#44; and<lb/> power of usefulness were all departed.  And again&#44; this tenure<lb/> at will is a guarantee&#44; worth all the bonds in the world&#44; for mu&#45;<lb/>tual forbearance&#44; respect&#44; and devotion to their respective duties.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">One word in conclusion&#44; and that in relation to the pamphlet it&#45;<lb/>self.  To the <hi rend="italics">casual</hi> and careless observers &#40;and these form a<lb/> large majority of readers&#41;&#44; it would seem that this was an official<lb/> expose&#44; a manifesto from the Adjunta.  This impression is fairly<lb/> <sic>inferrible</sic> from the three first paragraphs of the pamphlet&#44; and the<lb/> internal evidence that the books&#44; papers&#44; and minutes of the Ad&#45;<lb/>junta must have been under the free control of the writer.  And<lb/> yet I for <sic>oneam</sic> sure that it is not an <hi rend="italics">official production</hi>&#44; firstly&#44; be&#45;<lb/>cause it is not declared to be so&#59; and secondly&#44; because it is anon&#45;<lb/>ymous&#44; and even the very office from which it is issued is con&#45;<lb/>cealed.  The writer of the pamphlet is evidently a man of talent<lb/> and of education&#44; and his sense of justice should have induced<lb/> him to have declared <hi rend="italics">in express terms</hi>&#44; that he wrote on his own<lb/> individual responsibility&#44; and not to have left so important a fact<lb/> in doubt.  But there are other objections to the pamphlet&#44; of a<lb/> more serious character.  It charges a man&#44; who for the fifth part<lb/> of a century has been the Hazan of one of the most respectable<lb/> congregations in <placeName>America</placeName>&#44; with false representations&#44; hypocrisy&#44;<lb/> violation of duty&#44; and a childish vanity that induced him to sacri&#45;<lb/>fice his holy official duties to &#8220;one engrossing fancy.&#8221;  And does<lb/> the &#8220;light of truth&#8221; thus daguerreotype the character of <persName>Isaac<lb/> Leeser</persName>&#63;  No&#44; no&#44; no&#44; and such would be the echo and response<lb/> of ninety&#45;nine hundredths of the Jews of <placeName>England</placeName> and <placeName>America</placeName>.<lb/>  <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> is &#8220;neither more nor less than a man&#44;&#8221; he has the<lb/> faults and the frailties of humanity.  His quick sensibility&#44; his<lb/> ardent temperament&#44; may&#44; and perhaps do&#44; rob him of that suavi&#45;<lb/>ty of manner&#44; which&#44; like the tinsel glitter of false ornaments&#44; too</p>
