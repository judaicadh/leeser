			<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>Kingston&#44; Jamaica</placeName> <date>14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> November 5610</date>.</p>
			<p><addressee>Revd. Isaac Leeser</addressee>&#44;</p>
          <p rend="indent(2)">My dear Sir&#44;</p>
          <p rend="indent(4)">I avail myself of the present favorable<lb/> opportunity of replying to your welcome communication <persName>Dr Glamorgan</persName>&#44;<lb/> and also of acknowledging the receipt of a Parcel containing<lb/> Four sets of the present volume of the &#8220;Occident&#8221; to the <date>October</date> No&#44;<lb/> less one copy of No 4. I have duly delivered them to the Gentlemen&#44;<lb/> on whom&#44; thro a little delicacy&#44; I have not yet called for the<lb/> amount of subscription&#44; but I intend doing so next week&#44; and<lb/> handing over the same to <persName>Mr A C Peixotto</persName>&#44; your agent in this<lb/> <placeName>Island</placeName>.</p>
          <p rend="indent(4)">Permit me to reiterate the high<lb/> sense I entertain of your kindness and friendly feeling in furnishing<lb/> me with the information requested of vacancies in congregations<lb/> in the <placeName>United States</placeName>&#44; requiring Hazanim. On mature reflection&#44; it<lb/> is quite evident to me&#44; that great &#40;perhaps insurmountable&#41;<lb/> difficulties must necessarily arise&#44; in the endeavor to obtain a<lb/> situation in <placeName>America</placeName>&#44; unless the applicant be on the spot&#59; to<lb/> give satisfactory proofs of his capability &#38;c. Notwithstanding<lb/> the confidence I entertain&#44; that I would stand a <hi rend="underline">very fair</hi><lb/> chance of gaining the approval of any respectable <add>Hebrew</add> and that<lb/> the documentary recommendations which I could bring in testimony<lb/> of competency&#44; position&#44; and character&#44; would be such as any<lb/> individual would be proud of possessing&#44; still I must freely<lb/> admit&#44; that it would be nevertheless advisable&#44; if I could present<lb/> myself to the congregation amongst whom I desire to dwell&#44;<lb/> and then and there afford them the means of judging for themselves<lb/> <hi rend="underline">at present</hi> I cannot do this. My engagements in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> will<lb/> not be at an end till the <date>1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> May</date> next. When that period<lb/> arrives&#44; I will then be in a position to solicit your friendship<lb/> substantially&#44; as &#40;with God&#39;s Blessing&#41; the opportunity may be<lb/> afforded me of a personal acquaintance with yourself&#44; and other<lb/> Gentlemen interested in Jewish Affairs.</p>
		<pb n="2"/>
          <p rend="indent(1)">Thro the kind instruction of <persName>Hazan<lb/> Lopez</persName>&#44; I have made astonishing progress in the Portuguese minhag&#44; and I was thereby enabled to officiate during the Holidays in a<lb/> manner perfectly surprising to myself in having so successfully<lb/> overcome the accent &#38;c of the German form of Reading. I entreat<lb/> you not to think me egotistical&#44; or guilty of self adulation&#59;&#8212;<lb/> I speak as I feel&#44; and would&#44; as freely admit&#44; the faulty&#44; just<lb/> as much as the successful performance of my duties. In<lb/> testimony of the satisfaction which I have given to the members<lb/> of the congregation who are under my spiritual guidance&#44; the<lb/> enclosed letter was forwarded me&#44; which &#40;if you think it may be<lb/> serviceable to me&#41; I request you will publish in the &#8220;Occident.&#8221;<lb/> According to your desire&#44; I also transmit a short sermon&#44; as<lb/> well as the Inaugural Address I delivered on my assumption<lb/> of office. Should it be your wish&#44; I will feel much pleasure<lb/> to contribute now and then to the pages of your excellent periodical.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I will not lose sight of your<lb/> request&#44; in using my humble endeavors to obtain subscribers to the<lb/> Occident. Be assured&#44; that in <hi rend="underline">anything</hi> that can be of benefit<lb/> to you&#44; you may freely and readily command my zealous services.<lb/> If I fail of success&#44; it shall not be thro the want of the will of<lb/> serving you.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Rabbi Jechiel Cohen</persName> quitted this<lb/> <placeName>Island</placeName> last week for <placeName>St Thomas&#39;s</placeName>. He came here at a very<lb/> unfortunate period as regards the pecuniary position of the<lb/> community. He has collected about &#36;350 in <placeName>Kingston</placeName> and<lb/> <placeName>Spanish Town</placeName>&#44; of which nearly &#36;150 were <del>coll</del> received from<lb/> the small congregation of the latter town. He has however<lb/> been paid marked respect and attention by all classes&#59; and<lb/> &#40;I believe&#41; has lived here since his arrival without any expense<lb/> whatsoever. I introduced him to the chief members of the<lb/> congregation in <placeName>Spanish Town</placeName>&#44; and used some effort in forwarding<lb/> the objects of his mission. <persName>Rabbi Nissim ben Shelomo</persName> is still<lb/> here&#44; tho hitherto unsuccessful in his endeavors to collect money.<lb/> It may be uncharitable to form the opinion&#44; but I do not</p>
		<pb n="3"/>
			<p>think the solution of a messenger like him has been <add>&#63;</add>&#44;<lb/> as he is quite unacquainted with the English language&#44; manners&#44;<lb/> or customs. Some effort is about being made in by behalf.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">My father returns you his thanks for<lb/> your remembrance and desires me to present his kind regards to you.<lb/> With the renewed assurance of my good wishes&#44;</p>
          <p rend="indent(6)">Believe me</p>
          <p rend="indent(8)">My dear Sir</p>
          <p rend="indent(9)">Yours very truly</p>
