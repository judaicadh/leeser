            <p>After a prayer for the Welfare of the Government of<lb/> the <placeName>United
                    States</placeName>, this <del>city</del> city and all denomina-<lb/>tions
                professing a reverence for the Almighty, came<lb/> the Lecture.</p>
            <p>The speaker, though a little more than* a twelve month<lb/> in the country, spoke our
                language with considerable<lb/> distinctness, and by attention could be readily
                followed<lb/> His discourse was plain, making no pretensions to<lb/> eloquence. He
                spoke feelingly, however, of the ad-<lb/>vantages enjoyed by the Israelites in this
                land of free<lb/>dom, and glowingly of the period, when despotism<lb/> shall have
                ceased from the earth and the glorious<lb/> light of which the Prophets spake shall
                irradiate<lb/> all lands. He adverted to the growth of
                <placeName>Mobile</placeName>, and<lb/> to the prosperity that permitted his people
                to fill up<lb/> so handsome a temple in which to worship.</p>
            <p>* This is a misin<lb/>formation, he is<lb/> now three years<lb/> and three
                months<lb/> in the <placeName>US</placeName></p>

            <p>Our limited space this morning, confines us to this<lb/> general motive of the
                interesting ceremony of yesterday<lb/> They passed off, we believe, very much to the
                satisfaction<lb/> of the auditory—which completely filled the house—<lb/> and will
                not soon be forgotten. We heard the excellence<lb/> of the choir particularly
                commended. We congratulate<lb/> our Hebrew fellow-citizens upon their prosperous
                con-<lb/>dition, and upon the beautiful temple they have<lb/> consecrated to the
                Holy purposes of the Sanctuary,<lb/> (so far the daily advertiser.)</p>
            <p>I was requested to send to the Asmonean, not being acquaint-<lb/>ed with <persName>Mr
                    Lyon</persName>, I can not show him the interior of affairs<lb/> and so I will
                send the advertisements of the<lb/> Tribune and the Advertiser. You have then<lb/>
                more than sufficient matter of interest to bring<lb/> before the public. You may
                ever get the<lb/> Hebrew verses sung by the choir but I did<lb/> not know them
                    <add>?</add> being purely from<lb/> Psalm &amp; some few allusions to the
                prophet, and<lb/> so simple for instance. The nations are exhorted<lb/>
                <placeName>Israel</placeName> exhorted<lb/>
                <add>שבחוהו כל האמים</add><lb/> In <sic>allus</sic> to <add>הללו אל אחד

            <p>I shall want some books to form a little library<lb/> for the children here do not
                you Keep those books published<lb/> once by our society? They ought to be bound<lb/>
                and not as I have seen in <placeName>Charleston</placeName><lb/> Our school for
                religious instruction has about 30<lb/> scholars 1 above 13 years<lb/> about 10 from
                9 to 12<lb/> 10 fr 6-8<lb/> 10 fr 5-7<lb/> being quite new settlers we have few
                children, and those very<lb/> young ones.</p>
