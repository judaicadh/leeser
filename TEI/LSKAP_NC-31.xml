            <p rend="align(right)"><date>Thursday, 20th <add>?</add>, 1865</date>.</p>
            <p>Greetings to my friend, the friend of God,</p>
            <p>Dear friend:</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I still have so many worries to fight against that I can<lb/> barely
                gather enough courage to do any work, nor could I answer your<lb/> pleasant few
                lines. You annoyed me terribly by permitting <persName>Illoway</persName> to<lb/>
                speak, though he always shows himself to be an ignoramus. Unfortunate-<lb/>ly, you
                have confused the issues. The question here is not about<lb/> the misuse of
                    <add>?</add> in the matter of proselytization,- such as took place<lb/> here a
                short time ago, contrary to Jewish law, nor is it a question of<lb/> derivatives
                from it", because of which our sages have set it down as a<lb/> law and said that
                the head of the court must be thoroughly conversant<lb/> with Torah and
                wisdom,â€”which <persName>Illoway</persName> is certainly not worthy of being.<lb/>
                Here the point of the discussion is about the principle. Very unfor-<lb/>tunately, I
                must say, "In a town where no one is learned, it is per-<lb/>mitted to say, 'I am a
                pupil of the rabbis"'. This principle I myself<lb/> have developed best, and it was
                your duty as editor to point it out,<lb/> since both of them were shameless enough
                to ignore me. How can you<lb/> suggest to me that I should place myself opposite
                    <persName>Illoway</persName>, who wrote<lb/> like an ignoramus that
                proselytization is no more than voluntary (and<lb/> not an obligation). Thus, he
                forgot the sentence "Who sanctified us by<lb/> his commandments," not remembering
                what <persName>Maimonides</persName> said in the third<lb/> chapter of the <hi
                    rend="underline">Laws of Circumcision</hi>. How can you put me in the same<lb/>
                category with <persName>Morais</persName> who understands but speaks like a
                schoolboy, who<lb/> though he does not understand the plain explanation of a
                Midrashic<lb/> text,? his ignorance is excusable because of his youth?. It is
                an-<lb/>noying that I should be placed side by side with a brazen ignoramus<lb/> and
                with a pupil who has not yet attained the dignity of teaching,<lb/> though he may
                have meant well,â€”I have briefly and thoroughly dis-<lb/>posed of
                    <persName>Illoway</persName> in the â€”â€” story, as you may have read. I am
                very<lb/> sorry that I took care, because of fear for the desecration of God's
                    <sic>na</sic><lb/> name, not to dispose of him in the matter of
                    <date>Chanukah</date>, "Those that destroy</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p rend="align(center)">2</p>
            <p>thee and lay thee waste, come out <del>
                    <add>?</add>
                </del> from thee" (<persName>Isaiah</persName>).</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Isaacs</persName> does not want to accept anything more
                from <persName>Illoway</persName>. He sent<lb/> back to him an article about the
                Redemption of the First-Born. If you<lb/> should do likewise, you would be doing
                well. Such ungenuine scholarship<lb/> does no honor to your publication. It only
                serves to make us a laughing<lb/> stock in <placeName>Europe</placeName>.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I have indeed already spoken about such matters and with some<lb/>
                satisfaction. You know I was never a party man and have criticized<lb/>
                <persName>Raphall's</persName> speech as long as four years ago, because he,
                too,â€”The <persName>Bishop</persName><lb/> of <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>â€”spoke
                like an ignoramus. English translations are no<lb/> Torah with me, as you know. You
                are the only English speaking preacher,<lb/> in the true old sense of our word
                preacher (<persName>Maggid</persName>), who expounds Bib-<lb/>lical sentences. At
                this time, such preachers come out of "trees and stones"<lb/> (I Kings 5:13). Thus
                    <persName>Mayers</persName>, who was in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> and, with
                unheard of brazen-<lb/>ness, carried a title Morenu from some unknown hand, preached
                in English,<lb/> which is a scandal. He is a son of the <add>?</add> in the
                        <placeName><sic>Dukas</sic> Place</placeName> synagogue<lb/> in
                    <placeName>London</placeName>. Next <date>Sabbath</date>, your friend
                    <add>?</add> will let him preach in the<lb/> Portuguese synagogue. "Would that
                all God's people were prophets": pro-<lb/>phets of falsehood.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I want to have my sermon printed, then I shall let you have it<lb/>
                for the "Occident". I hear that we had an idea from "This is what God<lb/> said,
                'Through those near to me, will I be sanctified'". With the ex-<lb/>ception of the
                speeches held here, the scandalous ones of <persName>Adler's</persName>, let<lb/> me
                have the reports. In the Dutch synagogue, the tailor-chazan delivered<lb/> an
                address. This is the end. I tell you again the orthodox ignoramuses<lb/> are the
                ghouls and the reformers have an easy job to cover up the grave<lb/> and take honor

            <p>with you a literary undertaking, namely to expand the "Occident" by means<lb/> of a

                in <placeName>Germany</placeName>.. If you agree to this idea, I shall go there<lb/>
                in order to present my plan to you through which I hope to make my living<lb/> I
                myself will travel in order to extend the circulation of the newspaper.<lb/> You
                will see, it will, it must work. If you refuse me, I shall have to<lb/> realize my
                idea in other ways. "He who trusts in the Lord, loving kindness<lb/> surrounds him".
