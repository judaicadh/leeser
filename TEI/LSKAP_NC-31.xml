			<p rend="align(right)"><date>Thursday&#44; 20th <add>&#63;</add>&#44; 1865</date>.</p>
				<p>Greetings to my friend&#44; the friend of God&#44;</p>
				<p>Dear friend&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I still have so many worries to fight against that I can<lb/> barely gather enough courage to do any work&#44; nor could I answer your<lb/> pleasant few lines.  You annoyed me terribly by permitting <persName>Illoway</persName> to<lb/> speak&#44; though he always shows himself to be an ignoramus.  Unfortunate&#45;<lb/>ly&#44; you have confused the issues.  The question here is not about<lb/> the misuse of <add>&#63;</add> in the matter of proselytization&#44;&#45; such as took place<lb/> here a short time ago&#44; contrary to Jewish law&#44; nor is it a question of<lb/> derivatives from it&#34;&#44; because of which our sages have set it down as a<lb/> law and said that the head of the court must be thoroughly conversant<lb/> with Torah and wisdom&#44;&#8212;which <persName>Illoway</persName> is certainly not worthy of being.<lb/>  Here the point of the discussion is about the principle.  Very unfor&#45;<lb/>tunately&#44; I must say&#44; &#34;In a town where no one is learned&#44; it is per&#45;<lb/>mitted to say&#44; &#39;I am a pupil of the rabbis&#34;&#39;.  This principle I myself<lb/> have developed best&#44; and it was your duty as editor to point it out&#44;<lb/> since both of them were shameless enough to ignore me.  How can you<lb/> suggest to me that I should place myself opposite <persName>Illoway</persName>&#44; who wrote<lb/> like an ignoramus that proselytization is no more than voluntary &#40;and<lb/> not an obligation&#41;.  Thus&#44; he forgot the sentence &#34;Who sanctified us by<lb/> his commandments&#44;&#34; not remembering what <persName>Maimonides</persName> said in the third<lb/> chapter of the <hi rend="underline">Laws of Circumcision</hi>.  How can you put me in the same<lb/> category with <persName>Morais</persName> who understands but speaks like a schoolboy&#44; who<lb/> though he does not understand the plain explanation of a Midrashic<lb/> text&#44;&#63; his ignorance is excusable because of his youth&#63;.  It is an&#45;<lb/>noying that I should be placed side by side with a brazen ignoramus<lb/> and with a pupil who has not yet attained the dignity of teaching&#44;<lb/> though he may have meant well&#44;&#8212;I have briefly and thoroughly dis&#45;<lb/>posed of <persName>Illoway</persName> in the &#8212;&#8212; story&#44; as you may have read.  I am very<lb/> sorry that I took care&#44; because of fear for the desecration of God&#39;s <sic>na</sic><lb/> name&#44; not to dispose of him in the matter of <date>Chanukah</date>&#44; &#34;Those that destroy</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">2</p>
				<p>thee and lay thee waste&#44; come out <del> <add>&#63;</add> </del> from thee&#34; &#40;<persName>Isaiah</persName>&#41;.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Isaacs</persName> does not want to accept anything more from <persName>Illoway</persName>.  He sent<lb/> back to him an article about the Redemption of the First&#45;Born.  If you<lb/> should do likewise&#44; you would be doing well.  Such ungenuine scholarship<lb/> does no honor to your publication.  It only serves to make us a laughing<lb/> stock in <placeName>Europe</placeName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I have indeed already spoken about such matters and with some<lb/> satisfaction.  You know I was never a party man and have criticized<lb/> <persName>Raphall&#39;s</persName> speech as long as four years ago&#44; because he&#44; too&#44;&#8212;The <persName>Bishop</persName><lb/> of <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>&#8212;spoke like an ignoramus.  English translations are no<lb/> Torah with me&#44; as you know.  You are the only English speaking preacher&#44;<lb/> in the true old sense of our word preacher &#40;<persName>Maggid</persName>&#41;&#44; who expounds Bib&#45;<lb/>lical sentences.  At this time&#44; such preachers come out of &#34;trees and stones&#34;<lb/> &#40;I Kings 5&#58;13&#41;.  Thus <persName>Mayers</persName>&#44; who was in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> and&#44; with unheard of brazen&#45;<lb/>ness&#44; carried a title Morenu from some unknown hand&#44; preached in English&#44;<lb/> which is a scandal.  He is a son of the <add>&#63;</add> in the <placeName><sic>Dukas</sic> Place</placeName> synagogue<lb/> in <placeName>London</placeName>.  Next <date>Sabbath</date>&#44; your friend <add>&#63;</add> will let him preach in the<lb/> Portuguese synagogue.  &#34;Would that all God&#39;s people were prophets&#34;&#58; pro&#45;<lb/>phets of falsehood.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I want to have my sermon printed&#44; then I shall let you have it<lb/> for the &#34;Occident&#34;.  I hear that we had an idea from &#34;This is what God<lb/> said&#44; &#39;Through those near to me&#44; will I be sanctified&#39;&#34;.  With the ex&#45;<lb/>ception of the speeches held here&#44; the scandalous ones of <persName>Adler&#39;s</persName>&#44; let<lb/> me have the reports.  In the Dutch synagogue&#44; the tailor&#45;chazan delivered<lb/> an address.  This is the end.  I tell you again the orthodox ignoramuses<lb/> are the ghouls and the reformers have an easy job to cover up the grave<lb/> and take honor from the act.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I must have a circle of influence&#44; otherwise I am undone.<lb/>  What people are after here&#44; is to honor the Jews but not to feed them.<lb/>  If only I could bring my pet idea to fruition and could establish along</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">3</p>
				<p>with you a literary undertaking&#44; namely to expand the &#34;Occident&#34; by means<lb/> of a German supplement&#44; the land would thus be united.  It will&#44; it must<lb/> work.  The <add>&#63;</add> is well received.  It is the only newspaper which<lb/> is widespread in <placeName>Germany</placeName>..  If you agree to this idea&#44; I shall go there<lb/> in order to present my plan to you through which I hope to make my living<lb/> I myself will travel in order to extend the circulation of the newspaper.<lb/>  You will see&#44; it will&#44; it must work.  If you refuse me&#44; I shall have to<lb/> realize my idea in other ways.  &#34;He who trusts in the Lord&#44; loving kindness<lb/> surrounds him&#34;.  You will agree and excuse.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">How do matters stand with your congregation&#63;  I hear that Papa<lb/> wants to become professor.  These pigs are the destroyers of <placeName>America</placeName>&#44;<lb/> while chazanim and pests have peace&#44; I must go hungry and my spirit and<lb/> body suffer under the burden of work.  May God improve this.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">From my friend <persName>Weiler Einstein</persName>&#44; etc.&#44; I hear nothing.  Farewell<lb/> and remember&#44;<lb/> With love&#44; your friend&#44;</p>

				<p>The translation leaves much to be desired&#44; but it does make clear the<lb/> important elements in the letter.  <persName>S. G.</persName></p>
