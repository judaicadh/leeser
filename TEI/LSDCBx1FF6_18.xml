                              <p rend="indent(2)">In the article “The Union of Israelites”
                                        in=<lb/>=serted in the occident for
                                                  <date><sic>march</sic></date>, just reached me, I
                                        observe<lb/> a material change has taken place in
                                                  <persName>Dr. Wise's</persName> original plan<lb/>
                                        for heading a meeting <add>?</add> “That it shall consist of
                                        none but<lb/> delegates to be elected by any Jewish
                                        congregation in the United States”</p>
                              <p rend="indent(1)">I perceive likewise that unless 20 congregations
                                        respond to<lb/> the requisition the meeting will not take
                                        place—Permit me<lb/> a few remarks on both points. 1. I
                                        think it will be better to<lb/> afford Individuals, likewise
                                        not delegated by any congregation, the<lb/> opportunity to
                                        attend the meeting on signifying their intention to do
                                        so.</p>
                              <p rend="indent(1)">I will give my reasons for this. As every member
                                        of the Jewish<lb/> community is deeply interested in the
                                        question of a Union, all and<lb/> every one ought to have
                                        the faculty to attend such a meeting there<lb/> to consider
                                        and decide whether a union be necessary. It<lb/> may then be
                                        understood that 20 accessions to the requisition,<lb/>
                                        whether of delegates or private individuals, shall be
                                        deemed<lb/> the sufficient number, for holding the meeting,
                                        not however<lb/> limiting it to that number if more should
                                        have notified their<lb/> intention to attend it. 2. If the
                                        assembly is to be constituted<lb/> of delegates only from
                                        the congregations it may consist of many<lb/> if not of a
                                        majority of individuals knowing little of the matters to
                                        be<lb/> discussed, because appointed by congregations who at
                                        this stage<lb/> may be equally uninformed upon them. In
                                        fact, at the present</p>
                              <pb n="2"/>
                              <p>time when so little of the genuine spirit of our religion appears
                                        to<lb/> prevail, it is to be apprehended that intrigue,
                                        selfishness and<lb/> vanity may have more to do with the
                                        appointments of Delegates<lb/> than truly religious motives,
                                        unworthy means the sincerely<lb/> devoted man will scorn to
                                        employ, and unworthy motives will<lb/> not
                                                  activate<add>?</add> him on such an occasion. He
                                        would on the contrary<lb/> be apt to keep aloof that his
                                        motives might not misconstrued.</p>
                              <p rend="indent(1)">After this, Reverend Sir; and allow such men an
                                        opportunity<lb/> to come forward voluntarily and
                                        independently to serve their people<lb/> and the cause:—if
                                        you do not I predict the affair will prove<lb/> a failure at
                                        the very out set. I learned with concern that you<lb/> had
                                        been several days confined to your room by
                                        indisposition—<lb/> but was glad to find by my son's report
                                        that you were better.</p>
                              <p rend="indent(1)">To your indisposition and incessant labours I
                                        ascribe my not<lb/> having <add>?</add> favored with alive
                                        in acknowledgment of my<lb/> several late letters &amp;c. I
                                        pray that, if you can spare time for no<lb/> more, you will
                                        write me a few lines on the subject of the 50 copies<lb/> of
                                        my letters—I am employed on the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> with
                                        which I shall<lb/> conclude the exposition of the Divine
                                        Plan for the Government<lb/> of man, and may then return to
                                        the other points connected with<lb/> the Union of the
                                        Congregations as I situated my intention to touch<lb/> upon.
                                        My letters 3, 4, &amp; 5 will have conducted the
                                        exposition<lb/> to the period of the sentences passed on the
                                        first pair and then<lb/> deceiver, which will disclose fully
                                        the principles upon which<lb/> the divine economy is based.
