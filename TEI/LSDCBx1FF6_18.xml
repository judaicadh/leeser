			<p>Reverend Sir</p>
          <p rend="indent(2)">In the article &#8220;The Union of Israelites&#8221; in&#61;<lb/>&#61;serted in the occident for <date><sic>march</sic></date>&#44; just reached me&#44; I observe<lb/> a material change has taken place in <persName>Dr. Wise&#39;s</persName> original plan<lb/> for heading a meeting <add>&#63;</add> &#8220;That it shall consist of none but<lb/> delegates to be elected by any Jewish congregation in the United States&#8221;</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I perceive likewise that unless 20 congregations respond to<lb/> the requisition the meeting will not take place&#8212;Permit me<lb/> a few remarks on both points. 1. I think it will be better to<lb/> afford Individuals&#44; likewise not delegated by any congregation&#44; the<lb/> opportunity to attend the meeting on signifying their intention to do so.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I will give my reasons for this. As every member of the Jewish<lb/> community is deeply interested in the question of a Union&#44; all and<lb/> every one ought to have the faculty to attend such a meeting there<lb/> to consider and decide whether a union be necessary. It<lb/> may then be understood that 20 accessions to the requisition&#44;<lb/> whether of delegates or private individuals&#44; shall be deemed<lb/> the sufficient number&#44; for holding the meeting&#44; not however<lb/> limiting it to that number if more should have notified their<lb/> intention to attend it. 2. If the assembly is to be constituted<lb/> of delegates only from the congregations it may consist of many<lb/> if not of a majority of individuals knowing little of the matters to be<lb/> discussed&#44; because appointed by congregations who at this stage<lb/> may be equally uninformed upon them. In fact&#44; at the present</p>
		<pb n="2"/>
			<p>time when so little of the genuine spirit of our religion appears to<lb/> prevail&#44; it is to be apprehended that intrigue&#44; selfishness and<lb/> vanity may have more to do with the appointments of Delegates<lb/> than truly religious motives&#44; unworthy means the sincerely<lb/> devoted man will scorn to employ&#44; and unworthy motives will<lb/> not activate<add>&#63;</add> him on such an occasion. He would on the contrary<lb/> be apt to keep aloof that his motives might not misconstrued.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">After this&#44; Reverend Sir&#59; and allow such men an opportunity<lb/> to come forward voluntarily and independently to serve their people<lb/> and the cause&#58;&#8212;if you do not I predict the affair will prove<lb/> a failure at the very out set. I learned with concern that you<lb/> had been several days confined to your room by indisposition&#8212;<lb/> but was glad to find by my son&#39;s report that you were better.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">To your indisposition and incessant labours I ascribe my not<lb/> having <add>&#63;</add> favored with alive in acknowledgment of my<lb/> several late letters &#38;c. I pray that&#44; if you can spare time for no<lb/> more&#44; you will write me a few lines on the subject of the 50 copies<lb/> of my letters&#8212;I am employed on the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> with which I shall<lb/> conclude the exposition of the Divine Plan for the Government<lb/> of man&#44; and may then return to the other points connected with<lb/> the Union of the Congregations as I situated my intention to touch<lb/> upon. My letters 3&#44; 4&#44; &#38; 5 will have conducted the exposition<lb/> to the period of the sentences passed on the first pair and then<lb/> deceiver&#44; which will disclose fully the principles upon which<lb/> the divine economy is based. All that follow&#44; in the Bible&#44;</p>
		<pb n="3"/>
			<p>in the history of your nation&#44; and in the history of the world constitute a<lb/> series of events and circumstances connected with its operations&#8212;</p>
			<p>It was my intention to have brought the whole subject down to the<lb/> present period but found it would trail to a much greater<lb/> length than at first contemplated. I may however resume<lb/> the subject hereafter for the occident or its reverend editor&#39;s<lb/> signifying his wish to have it to his <add>&#63;</add> Adwriter&#8212;</p>
          <p rend="indent(10)"><persName role="author">A A. Lindo</persName></p>
			<p>In my letter 2 in the occident for <date>March</date> a very material omission<lb/> of the word &#8220;<hi rend="underline">but</hi>&#8221; has occurred. In the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> &#44;&#44; the principles to<lb/> constitute the bares<add>&#63;</add> of a Union&#44; advertising to &#8220;the effects of deviat<add>&#63;</add><lb/> from our received religious institutions &#38;c&#8221; The compositor says<lb/> &#8220;whilst it cannot be productive of prejudicial effects to themselves<lb/> &#38;c&#8221;&#8212;whereas I said&#44; and I think you will find it so in the<lb/> copy sent you. &#8220;Whilst it cannot <hi rend="underline">but</hi> be productive of<lb/> prejudicial effects to themselves&#8221; &#38;c. Have the goodness&#44; by an<lb/> arterial reference&#44; aside Letter 3 to a note at bottom of page<lb/> to correct this mistake&#8212;<persName role="author">AAL</persName></p>
