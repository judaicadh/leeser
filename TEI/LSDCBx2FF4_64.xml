				<p><addressee>Rev Isaac Leeser</addressee></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Dear Sir</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">I am much obliged to you for your<lb/> testimonial in favor of <persName>Mr Alber<add>&#63;</add></persName>.  He is unquestionably<lb/> a well educated&#44; talented man&#44; but very <hi rend="underline">bashful</hi>&#8212;a<lb/> quality not possessed by many of our Drs in the present day.<lb/>  I wrote <persName>Wellington Hart</persName> in his behalf for the office of Teacher<lb/> in <placeName>Milwaukee</placeName>&#44; and <persName>Mr A.</persName> has left <placeName>Montreal</placeName> for that place<lb/> having  been elected &#8220;in preference to others&#8221; as <persName>Mr Otterburg</persName> wrote<lb/> him.  He is nearer <placeName>Chicago</placeName> &#38; some other western places<lb/> and will have better opportunity to judge for himself.<lb/>  It would be a difficult thing to counteract <persName>U&#39;s</persName> prayer book<lb/> It will have its run&#44; until cut out by some other.  People<lb/> like abridgments nowhere better than in Prayer Books &#38; <persName>W&#39;s</persName> as I learned<lb/> is short enough in all conscience.  The synagogue in <placeName>America</placeName><lb/> is fast approaching the state of the Protestant church there&#8212;<lb/> Presently there will be a &#8220;no prayer book&#8221; no ritual at all&#8221; proposed<lb/> by some&#44; Extensive prayer being so superior&#44; as they will assert&#44;<lb/> Indeed I should not be at all surprised to find the doctrines of<lb/> Mormonism advocated by some Drs&#8212;at least polygamy<lb/> for I am told that one of our celebrated nothingarians<add>&#63;</add> lives with<lb/> his wife in as bellicose a state as any dog &#38; cat could desire<lb/>&#8212;and what a pleasant thing it would be after swilling lager<lb/> &#45;bier or schnapps to go home where if one wife was<lb/> in the blues another might be all smiles.  The truth is we<lb/> have too many &#8220;carnal minded Jews&#8221; in our midst.  It is the</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>peoples fault as much as the Doctors&#44; or could the latter play<lb/> the antics they do&#63;  Eating on a <add>Hebrew</add>&#8212;smoking on a <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> I have heard some curious accounts of the doings of some of these<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; but I have too much confidence in the divine<lb/> strength of our holy faith to suppose that such a set can<lb/> at all injure it permanently.  She may have to witness some<lb/> &#8220;sorry sights&#8221; but they will not remain to blast our vision<lb/> longer than <persName>Banquo&#39;s</persName> ghost.  I am not at all afraid&#44; nor do I<lb/> despond.  Good will yet come of all the evil we see or fancy&#8212;<lb/> and Judaism will remain intact though it has to withstand blows<lb/> ten thousand times fiercer than those now <sic>levelled</sic> at it by hyper<lb/>&#45;orthodox or ultra heterodoxy.  The middle <add>&#63;</add>&#8212;as <add>Hebrew</add> in his<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> so strongly recommends&#44; we must <add>&#63;</add>.  It is the safest<lb/> because it is the truest&#59; This is the cause I would like to<lb/> see our Editors follow.  We have fanatics on both sides and both<lb/> are destructives.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">You are mistaken or rather misinformed of the<lb/> engagement of young <persName>Archer<add>&#63;</add></persName> &#38; <persName>Louisa Joseph</persName>.  It is his cousin<lb/> young <persName>Altman</persName> whom people call the happy man&#8212;but we<lb/> have heard yet nothing official.  Your plan of making the<lb/> Occident weekly is something new again&#59; have you abandoned<lb/> the Advocate enterprise altogether&#63;  I have had inquiries made<lb/> about it&#44; and I told them it was delayed.  I send you by this<lb/> mail a pamphlet my father denied me to send you&#8212;the life<lb/> of <persName>Reggio</persName> written by my father <hi rend="underline">in Dutch</hi> for the Dutch Jewish<lb/> paper&#8212;but it is all Dutch to me&#44; and I would be very<lb/> glad to see an English version of it in the Occident by your<lb/> Dutch translator of <persName>Dr. Mulder</persName>.  The subject is very interesting<lb/> and I am satisfied ably &#38; learnedly handled.  My father writes<lb/> he had some little difficulty in writing Dutch after so many years.</p>

			<p rend="indent(1)">We are honored just now with the meetings of the American<lb/> Association for the promotion of Science&#59;&#8212;the most troublesome move<lb/> is of course in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>.  <persName>Professor Hare</persName>&#44; the inventor of great<lb/> things no doubt &#38; <hi rend="underline">questionless</hi> a clever man&#8212;very <sic>clayver</sic> as <persName>Lord<lb/> Verisopht</persName> says&#8212;but what makes me think him now a little <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> is that in opening a door with a couple of friends the other evening<lb/> at a Soiree given to the association by the Natural History Society&#44; we<lb/> found him <add>&#63;</add> at <hi rend="underline">table turning</hi> &#38;c.  Do you know him&#63;  I have<lb/> made the acquaintance of several of the <add>&#63;</add> among them <persName>Dr<lb/> Benedict</persName> of <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>&#8212;a friend of <persName>Gutheims</persName>.  <persName>Dr Thomson</persName> of<lb/> <placeName>New York</placeName> who knows <persName>Raphall</persName> &#38; others.  I am now employed &#40;or will<lb/> be when I done<add>&#63;</add> this&#41; in giving some information on Jewish Coinage<lb/> for <persName>Mr Gillbon</persName> <placeName>N. C. U. S.</placeName> mint.  The City is full&#8212;every hotel<lb/> boarding house crowded&#8212;I wish you had roped over when in<lb/> <placeName>Detroit</placeName> &#38; remained if only to be present at the opening of the Association&#59;<lb/> I give some time to it as I have become a member&#44; and hope to profit<lb/> by the <add>&#63;</add>thrological departure.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I trust this will meet you restored to perfect health<lb/> and strength&#44; and wishing you <add>Hebrew</add></p>
			<p rend="indent(10)">I am yours truly</p>
