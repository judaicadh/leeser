            <p rend="indent(1)">Dear Sir</p>
            <p rend="indent(2)">I am much obliged to you for your<lb/> testimonial in favor of
                    <persName>Mr Alber<add>?</add></persName>. He is unquestionably<lb/> a well
                educated, talented man, but very <hi rend="underline">bashful</hi>—a<lb/> quality
                not possessed by many of our Drs in the present day.<lb/> I wrote
                    <persName>Wellington Hart</persName> in his behalf for the office of
                Teacher<lb/> in <placeName>Milwaukee</placeName>, and <persName>Mr A.</persName> has
                left <placeName>Montreal</placeName> for that place<lb/> having been elected “in
                preference to others” as <persName>Mr Otterburg</persName> wrote<lb/> him. He is
                nearer <placeName>Chicago</placeName> &amp; some other western places<lb/> and will
                have better opportunity to judge for himself.<lb/> It would be a difficult thing to
                counteract <persName>U's</persName> prayer book<lb/> It will have its run, until cut
                out by some other. People<lb/> like abridgments nowhere better than in Prayer Books
                &amp; <persName>W's</persName> as I learned<lb/> is short enough in all conscience.
                The synagogue in <placeName>America</placeName><lb/> is fast approaching the state
                of the Protestant church there—<lb/> Presently there will be a “no prayer book” no
                ritual at all” proposed<lb/> by some, Extensive prayer being so superior, as they
                will assert,<lb/> Indeed I should not be at all surprised to find the doctrines
                of<lb/> Mormonism advocated by some Drs—at least polygamy<lb/> for I am told that
                one of our celebrated nothingarians<add>?</add> lives with<lb/> his wife in as
                bellicose a state as any dog &amp; cat could desire<lb/>—and what a pleasant thing
                it would be after swilling lager<lb/> -bier or schnapps to go home where if one wife
                was<lb/> in the blues another might be all smiles. The truth is we<lb/> have too
                many “carnal minded Jews” in our midst. It is the</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>peoples fault as much as the Doctors, or could the latter play<lb/> the antics they
                do? Eating on a <add>תענית כפור</add>—smoking on a <add>שבת</add><lb/> I have heard
                some curious accounts of the doings of some of these<lb/>
                <add>שבחי הדור</add>, but I have too much confidence in the divine<lb/> strength of
                our holy faith to suppose that such a set can<lb/> at all injure it permanently. She
                may have to witness some<lb/> “sorry sights” but they will not remain to blast our
                vision<lb/> longer than <persName>Banquo's</persName> ghost. I am not at all afraid,
                nor do I<lb/> despond. Good will yet come of all the evil we see or fancy—<lb/> and
                Judaism will remain intact though it has to withstand blows<lb/> ten thousand times
                fiercer than those now <sic>levelled</sic> at it by hyper<lb/>-orthodox or ultra
                heterodoxy. The middle <add>?</add>—as <add>ברחבה</add> in his<lb/>
                <add>ח' פרצים</add> so strongly recommends, we must <add>?</add>. It is the
                safest<lb/> because it is the truest; This is the cause I would like to<lb/> see our
                Editors follow. We have fanatics on both sides and both<lb/> are destructives.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">You are mistaken or rather misinformed of the<lb/> engagement of

                people call the happy man—but we<lb/> have heard yet nothing official. Your plan of
                making the<lb/> Occident weekly is something new again; have you abandoned<lb/> the
                Advocate enterprise altogether? I have had inquiries made<lb/> about it, and I told
                them it was delayed. I send you by this<lb/> mail a pamphlet my father denied me to
                send you—the life<lb/> of <persName>Reggio</persName> written by my father <hi
                    rend="underline">in Dutch</hi> for the Dutch Jewish<lb/> paper—but it is all
                Dutch to me, and I would be very<lb/> glad to see an English version of it in the
                Occident by your<lb/> Dutch translator of <persName>Dr. Mulder</persName>. The
                subject is very interesting<lb/> and I am satisfied ably &amp; learnedly handled. My
                father writes<lb/> he had some little difficulty in writing Dutch after so many
                years.</p>
