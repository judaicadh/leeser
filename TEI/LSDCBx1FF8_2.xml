			<p rend="indent(4)">Honored Sir!</p>
			<p>Your Occident for this month has come to hand (though I have not received my
				copy<lb/> yet). Your note is excellent. It is no use to repeat what has been told
				again<lb/> and again ( contra <persName>S.N.C.</persName> renders all publications
				useless. a) <persName>C</persName> knew that he had<lb/> compromised himself.
					<add>?</add> was proved to him by <persName>Mrs A Moise</persName> &amp;
					<persName>Mr Valentine</persName><lb/> yet he allowed it to appear.</p>
			<p>b) <persName>C</persName> walked <hi rend="underline">went</hi> that afternoon when
				the proof sheet arrived here a long time in the<lb/> street with <persName>Mr
					Posnansky</persName>, he could not but have told him or even<lb/> shown him the
				sheet (<persName>C's</persName>
				<sic>communic</sic> are from <persName>P's</persName> date there is much art<lb/> in
				the whole, which is but to mystify the public; and perhaps to have some<lb/>
				document to prove his honesty some future day or for his children<lb/> in a future
				generation, for this reason it would have been well not<lb/> to give him the
				opportunity. This my supposit<add>?</add> I will substantiate<lb/> below) now I say,
				as <persName>C A P</persName> had know that they again impose upon<lb/> the public
				and you knew it before you sent the Occident abroad<lb/> what has an Editor to do in
				such cases? We cannot refer to<lb/> positive Law, we must refer to moral
					<add>?</add>uling. It is true <persName>Mr S. N. C.</persName><lb/> has the
				opportunity given to reply and to substantiate his deposition<lb/> more than before,
				but this is a poor chance.</p>
			<p>c) My letter (of which I have no copy as I never take time to copy) may be
				un<lb/>altered, though I assure you that the word "<sic>airial</sic>„ does not
				appear<lb/> genuine, nor the sentence about the Messiah. You have the version<lb/> I
				thought I had written, I saw the original in the hand of the late<lb/>
				<persName>Mr Otterling</persName> to whom I immediately <add>?</add> that it is
				introduced to tell<lb/>
				<persName>Mr P</persName> what <del>to</del> is good to disturb the peace of
				believer or congreg with<lb/> what has no influence upon practical life. I miss "As„
				in the begin<lb/> The same was shown to me by <persName>Major L</persName> to whom I
				showed my<lb/> inaugural Sermon where the same idea is <add>?</add></p>
			<p rend="The following is written in the left column of this page"><persName>Mr.
					SN.C</persName> is desirous<lb/> to have from my letter<lb/> the remarks about
				"founders<lb/> rescinded, please<lb/> do so.<lb/> As also my few Hebrew<lb/> lines.
				I will not speak<lb/> against the body<lb/> at all. I will<lb/> cultivate peace<lb/>
				crush the serpent<lb/> and save the <add>?</add><lb/> you will oblige me<lb/> to
				strike off<lb/> 20 copies of<lb/> the next and<lb/> send them with<lb/> the
				soonest</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
			<p>it is founded on the address of <persName>Moses Mendelsson</persName> to
					poen<add>?</add> later "S<add>?</add>
				<del>of</del><lb/> auf <del>the</del> das Thim und Lassan der menschen und last uns
				den glauben etc<lb/> now I miss what gives the whole a different turn</p>
			<p>d) The abusive language of <persName>C.</persName> disgraces the Press</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">1) <persName>C</persName> does not know me. An introductory visit at
				my first arrival, once a few words<lb/> at meeting in the street; and an evening
				spent in a large very large circle at the house of <persName>Mr<lb/>
					Seixas</persName>, where he might have been present. I do not recollect. And
				surely we had no conversation<lb/> there. this man comes now, and abuses me</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">2) Neither <persName>Ac</persName> nor other 13 men out of
				opposition have heard me tell the state of affairs<lb/> nor do I at all count them
				to belong to us (except 1 or two of them) they are no farther<lb/> Jews then by
					<add>מילה</add> that is all of the whole only ten live by chance in
					<add>כשר</add> houses<lb/> 14 never come to <add>דבר שבקדושה</add>, except on
					<add>יכ</add> for a few hours. If charities are collected<lb/> they are never
				called on they are actually <add>זכרתו</add>, 3 or four I do not even know<lb/>
				These men combine and censure a Teacher in <placeName>Israel</placeName>, are they
				Jews or Republicans<lb/> if the former they ought to act accord to our laws if the
				latter, accord to Law of<lb/> their country</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">They are complainants (against me) defendants (of themselves &amp;
					<persName>Poz</persName>:) witness, party<lb/>
				<hi rend="underline">jury of judges, &amp; executors at all about things which they
					do not care</hi><lb/>
				<hi rend="underline">for which they do not understand and against a man whom they
					do</hi><lb/>
				<hi rend="underline">not know</hi>. And all this is done of defense of a man who
				less than prophama<lb/>tion<add>?</add>, hypocrisy &amp; fraud, he thus is proved he
				is not guilty=<lb/> A man of whom we never hear no good against a man from we never
				heard any<lb/> bad. A man who came here as hyper orthodox (they complain about
				inconsisten<lb/>cy, they ought to be reconciled to suit if I even were guilty) had
				broke the congreg<lb/> now 3 times <sic>seperating</sic> families &amp; the Living
				&amp; the dead. For separate they are now<lb/> I called last week on <persName>Mr C
					M Mordecai<add>?</add></persName> presenting to him as I am totally passive<lb/>
				(I did not expose <persName>P.</persName> he to ruin me told all his shown of which
				I reproached him) and under<lb/> continual persecution of unprivileged men, without
				anything like sufficient<lb/> support on those who side with me, I would withdraw,
				so that they should not<lb/> blame me of being in the way of a reconciliation.</p>
			<p>To this I was answered my withdrawal would be of no use at all as I have<lb/> made
				two distinct Congregation of them of different principle etc. and whoever<lb/> comes
				now, cannot suit both parties. The whole sphere of their neglig <del>notion</del>
				ideas<lb/> is a new one. <persName>C'</persName> complains my friend here been busy
				to raise my reputation<lb/> my friends in the <sic>congregat</sic> have taken no
				part before the public except the petition that they<lb/> sent me, and could they do
				less. It is <persName>Mr S N. C.</persName> yourself &amp; <persName>Mr.
					N</persName><lb/> that have been instrumental in getting me out of the mire</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
			<p>e) You give me in the last line page 321 an indirect invitation to reply.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">1) can I reply to so low a language 2) can I reply to a letter which
				I cannot Identify</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">3) can I reply with out reposing the whole party of betraying me,
				and of no more</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">belonging to a Jewish body and to be unworthy of being
				Republicans.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">4) A minister must avoid offense he dare not quarrel fight or
				wrestle the irreligious<lb/> world is delighted at such.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">5) Have not I told in a letter that I must keep silence so long as
				my relation<lb/> continues and shall I be roused by a man like
					<persName>C.</persName> He speaks of puliens<add>?</add> of<lb/> vice. But this
				is <persName>Po's</persName> crafty manner he sends <add>?</add> aspersion with
					<add>?</add> exquisite<lb/> finesse. To raise suspicion against my private
				character all this is done in<lb/> his usual manner, so that after all he is
				untangible you may take it as you<lb/> like like his "divine law delivered unto our
				fathers by <persName>Moses</persName>; what a Phras<lb/>ology. What is divine, why
				the regime indirect,,</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Now allow me to tell you a minister's character is, in such cases,
				like that of<lb/> a lady. You are the Editor your sister is maligned, her character
				vilified, you<lb/> in order to repose the malice of her <add>?</add> knowing the
				necessity of crushing<lb/> him give your sister the permission to appear before the
					<add>?</add>, to plead<lb/> her own cause before the public. What has she to do
				under such circumstances?</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">f) <persName>Mr P.</persName> knew that <persName>S N.C.</persName>
				will reply, but he has <add>?</add></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">1) He mystifies the public raising smoke and dust so that they do
				not distinguish the <add>?</add><lb/> valor and standing</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">2) He is very systematic, his Character is blasted, by his tenants
				he is called "the <persName>Shylock</persName>, his<lb/> own party know that they
				are deceived, now he gathers material a tort et a <persName>Trewers</persName><lb/>
				for his children in future in 20 or 30 years they will show with paper that his<lb/>
				paper was that <add>?</add> glory man, who was persecuted, who had such warm
				friend<lb/> to defend him, his <add>?</add> were man of no longer powers, the
				concentrated<lb/> "malice at misrepresentation together (p 315); they aspired forth
				"low rent„ it "<add>?</add>„<lb/> they were "Jesuits„ if, their father had "too much
				refinement &amp; good breeding" p 314<lb/> "purlien of vice„ is at the same time
				surely interspersed. "they" if they would harm him<lb/> settled their own shame
				would here covered their shame p 316 &amp;c</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">This number is carefully laid by to such documents as the
				following</p>
			<p>Last year after he had told his story how I had told him of his profanation hypocrisy
				&amp;<lb/> infidelity„ he like a modest bashful girl that had been grossly offended,
				send would<lb/> go crying or weeping to her mothers bosom, went to his beloved
				friends bitterly complaining<lb/> and he wanted some satisfaction from me I should
				send him a letter <add>?</add> that<lb/> I <add>?</add> refused doing so. He wants
				me to write about his "belief„</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
			<p>"I could write nothing against my convictions„ viz that he is what I know him<lb/> to
				be. How he can feel himself so well, as not to be able to rest on his own<lb/>
				reputation he then had been here 14 or 15 years I about 16 weeks If my paper<lb/> is
				valid my word contrary to that paper is also valid to do one would<lb/> invalidate
				my word at all. I gave the congregation by the Parnass the following advice<lb/> you
				pass a resolution that all the members of the Cong V. B. E. as well as their<lb/>
				ministers &amp; all the officers &amp; servant belonging to the establishment can
				only<lb/> be admitted after a deposition of the test oath "that they believe in
				the<lb/> Right <persName>Reverend Gustavis Poznanski</persName>„ else they have no
					<add>, 3 מעמם or four I do not even know</add><lb/> this oath or the Resolution
				you make the 14th art: of it<lb/>
				<persName>Po</persName> creed. I of course as the minister before I am again
				admitted must<lb/>
				<sic>must</sic> acknowledge my belief on mere 14 articles, but I do not and so I
				will<lb/> ask <persName>Mr P.</persName> do you belief in <add>?</add> even 13
				articles? He of course<lb/> would say no (for when first asked about them told me "I
				know that they are good<lb/> for nothing, but I was ask to give a creed at another
				convers: he said He had<lb/> hard work to graze by (<persName>Maimonid</persName>)
				and had he to do it now all would have<lb/> been different but ten years ago to omit
				that one word ("The <add>?</add> would<lb/> have made leave 6 members &amp; now as
					<persName>Mr P</persName> does not believe in his own 13<lb/> article, I do not
				believe in the fourteenth„</p>
			<p>Upon this his party made up a paper expressive that as slanderous<lb/> reports spread
				about <persName>Mr P'o</persName> not believing in, they have confidence<lb/> and
				take his word etc This paper was signed by 26 men Old <persName>Mr Otter</persName>
				signed<lb/> though he was then in the <placeName>north</placeName> several seat
				holders signed (now they complain about<lb/> seat holders signing." Seat holders
				have a right to petition the constitution<lb/> Art IV says All subscribers shall be
				entitled to all rights and privileges of a member, except<lb/> the right to vote, as
