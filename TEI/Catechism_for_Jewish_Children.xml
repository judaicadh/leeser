MISS REBECCA GRATZ&#44; iii

SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SUNDAY&#8211;SCHOOL FOR RELIGIOUS 
INSTRUCTION OF ISRAELITES IN PHILADELPHIA. 

Esteemed Friend &#58; &#8212; I have long wished for an 
opportunity to acknowledge my indebtedness to you 
for the approval you kindly bestowed on my youth&#8211; 
ful labours&#44; and the frequent marks of friendship I 
received from you since my lot has been cast in this 
place. As this little book has been undertaken to 
assist your efforts&#44; which have so far been crowned 
with signal success&#44; to form an institution whence 
the waters of life might flow alike to the rich and 
the poor &#58; permit me to inscribe it to you&#44; that your 
respected name may contribute to its introduction 
into the houses and schools of our people who dwell 
in this land. Let me hope that this institution 
which you have founded&#44; and all similar ones un&#8211; 
dertaken among the sons of Israel&#44; may be blessed 
of the Master of our labour&#44; and that the scholars 
educated therein may become faithful servants and 
willing followers of the Holy One of Jacob&#44; our 
Redeemer. To you&#44; however&#44; and those connected 
with you in your pious efforts&#44; may that great bless&#8211; 
ing be granted of &#34;a place and a name in the house 
and within the walls of our Father&#44; an everlasting 
name that shall not be cut off.&#34; 

Wishing you peace and prosperity during your 
pilgrimage on earth&#44; I subscribe myself&#44; with sincere 
esteem&#44; your friend and fellow&#8211;labourer.

PREFACE. v



The present is one of the series of books for the promo&#8211; 
tion of religious knowledge among the Israelites whose 
vernacular is the English language&#44; which I announced in 
my first publication about nine years ago. Although as yet 
the sale of my works has been scarcely adequate to defray 
the expenses&#44; I have never given up the pleasing idea of 
supplying at convenient intervals&#44; according to the best of 
my limited abilities&#44; the lamentable deficiency of devotional 
works which is on all sides admitted to exist among us. I 
would&#44; however&#44; do injustice to my feelings were I to let the 
present opportunity pass without acknowledging the kind&#8211; 
ness which has been extended to my various efforts&#44; even in 
distant parts&#44; by persons entirely unknown to me. Such 
indulgence to the many defects discoverable in my writings&#44; 
whilst it encourages me to persevere amidst many difficulties 
which need not be made public&#44; claims my sincere thanks&#44; 
and demands of me greater care and unremitting labour for 
the future&#44; to prove that I have not been altogether unworthy 
of the kindness extended to me. But to Him above&#44; who has 
not withheld from me his light and his manifold blessings&#44; 

my heartfelt gratitude is justly due in a high degree&#44; for 

                <pb n="vi"/>



vi PREFACE. 

having permitted me to accomplish what I have done&#44; without 
much human assistance. 

It is but justice to acknowledge that&#44; although this little 
book appears as an original&#44; it is&#44; nevertheless&#44; founded upon 
a German work&#44; by Dr. Eduard Kley&#44; of Hamburg&#44; which 
appeared at Berlin in 1814&#44; under the title of Catechismus 
der Mosaischen Religion. For several years past there 
have appeared in Germany a number of Catechisms&#44; all 
more or less valuable &#59; and&#44; in thinking over the best plan for 
the present undertaking&#44; it struck me that Dr. Kley&#39;s was 
the most suitable&#44; even in preference to the one I originany 
entertained of giving it the form of a conversation on religion&#44; 
which&#44; however&#44; I have occasionally introduced&#44; as will appear 
from inspection. I retained the division of subjects&#44; nearly 
all the questions&#44; and occasionally an answer&#44; of Dr. Kley. 
Still&#44; this book is no translation &#59; because&#44; in the first place&#44; 
it contains fully double the quantity of the doctor&#39;s book&#59; 
and&#44; secondly&#44; not to mention that several important points 
had been omitted or too obscurely given by him&#44; he had 
imparted a peculiar colouring to his ideas&#44; which unfortunately 
have become rather too famous&#44; since his connexion with a 
society of schismatics&#44; to whom he has borne the relation of 
pastor for many years past. Nevertheless&#44; I would not 
detract the least from the merits of this learned and eloquent 
man&#44; despite of his errors &#59; and I gladly admit that my labour 
was much abridged by having so excellent a guide as he has 
furnished&#44; which I preferred following&#44; than be too anxious 
for entire originality&#44; by which this Catechism could have 
gained nothing in value.

[t has been my endeavour to make myself understood by 
children of from eight to fourteen years old&#59; yet I fear that I 
may have failed&#44; oftener than I should do&#44; of rendering the 
subject&#8211;matter sufficiently clear. I trust&#44; however&#44; that 
teachers and parents will not put the book into the hands of 
their pupils and children&#44; without giving at least a cursory 
explanation&#44; which&#44; it is confidently hoped&#44; will be enough tc 
assist the learner. 

Occasionally a subject has been introduced more than 
once&#44; which originated in the idea that it is better to have all 
the points connected together exhibited at one view&#59; for 
children are but too apt to forget what they have learned 
some weeks back. So likewise were several Bible&#8211;texts 
quoted more than once&#44; when it was thought that the same 
text would be the best applicable to explain or elucidate dif&#8211; 
ferent subjects. This quoting twice may in a few instances 
have arisen from inadvertence&#44; which is very likely to occur 
in a work so difficult to compose&#44; on account of the youth of 
the persons for whose instruction it is intended&#59; but gene&#8211; 
rally it was done designedly&#44; for the reason given. I trust 
that some allowance will be made&#44; if I have not succeeded in 
imparting all the interest&#44; variety&#44; and polish such a work 
might have received by others better acquainted than I can 
pretend to be with the operations of the youthful mind &#59; but 
the reader may be assured of one thing&#44; that not a passage or 
a word even was allowed to pass without much care and 
anxious reflection&#58; it was my endeavour to teach the truth&#44; 
and the truth only. 

Believing that&#44; as the scholar advances in a work&#44; the

viii PREFACE. 

matter may with advantage be a little more elaborately given&#44; 
in order to require always a sufficient degree of application and 
study&#44; I have not hesitated to use language a little more 
complicated and rather longer paragraphs in the latter than in 
the first chapters. Still&#44; if thought too difficult&#44; the chapters 
on the Moral Law&#44; the Messiah&#44; and the Life after Death&#44; 
and other portions&#44; may be advantageously deferred till a 
second reading&#44; as they are not absolutely necessary to an 
understanding of the whole subject. 

With the confident hope that this unpretending work may 
have its useful effects&#44; to awaken in the young a spirit of 
devotion and piety&#44; I commit it to the care of the Great 
Teacher&#44; who bestowed on us his law as a guide to our souls 
unto the haven of that happiness which He has destined for 
those who fear his name and lay hold of his covenant&#44; to 
obey his will all the days that they live on the earth.

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION&#44; ix



The favourable reception which this manual met with on 
its first appearance induced me to issue&#44; in 5605&#44; a second 
edition&#44; differing scarcely from the first&#59; for&#44; though some 
thought at that time that the subject had been treated in too 
difficult a manner for young children&#44; wherefore it ought to 
have been simplified&#44; I declined doing this&#44; after mature re&#8211; 
flection&#44; since it was not my design to compose a book for 
mere beginners&#44; but to furnish a guide for those who had 
advanced already beyond the first elements. This course was 
deemed the more proper because there had appeared in the 
meanwhile several good school&#8211;books&#44; calculated to serve as 
stepping&#8211;stones to a treatise which requires some little thought 
and application on the part of the scholar. Besides this&#44; 
much depends on the teacher how the subject is presented to 
the learner &#59; and any one with little experience in training 
youth will readily be able to explain here and there a few 
passages which at first sight may appear difficult. 

About eleven years have now elapsed since this book was 
reissued&#59; and&#44; as it has by degrees found its way into many 
schools&#44; I now present it in a manner more permanent than 
before&#44; &#8212; the title slightly changed&#44; and with such verbal cor&#8211; 
rections here and there as a careful revision has pointed 
out to be needed. The second edition had indeed not been ex&#8211; 
hausted by the public demand&#58; but&#44; a calamitous conflagration 

                <pb n="x"/>

x PREFACE. 

having destroyed the remainder of tt&#47; same&#44; a new supply 
had to be provided&#44; to answer any demand which may be 
made for it &#59; and it is to be hoped that the Catechism in its new 
form may be the means of an extended usefulness for many 
years to come. And&#44; in this connection&#44; I cannot avoid 
stating that it is a gratifying phenomenon that&#44; notwithstanding 
the indifference which many express towards religion&#44; there is 
a deep&#8211;seated feeling that something ought and must be done 
to enlighten the youthful mind. Therefore&#44; if any event in my 
life can afford me some degree of satisfaction&#44; it is the con&#8211; 
sciousness of having added one contribution&#44; by this unpre&#8211; 
tending work&#44; to satisfy the demand for information in the 
ways of the law of God. And it will be to me a far greater gra&#8211; 
tification than any public applause&#44; could I be convinced that 
the thoughts offered in this guide to the young Isaelites have 
led a few as sincere worshippers to the house of our God&#44; and 
fortified them with those holy feelings of devotion which will 
induce them to serve their Maker in early youth and in maturer 
years&#44; so as to be faithful amidst temptations and obedient 
even in difficulties which try man&#39;s constancy. 

With these few words the Catechism is again offered to the 
indulgent kindness of the American and British Israelites&#44; in 
the full hope that it may be of service to those for whose edi&#8211; 
fication it was composed.

CATECHISM FOR JEWISH CHILDREN. 1

CHAPTER I. 

RELIGION IN GENERAL. 

1. What is religion &#63; 

Religion is the knowledge we have of God&#44; and 
the duties we owe in obedience to his will. 

2. What do you mean by saying&#44; &#34; I believe in God&#63;&#34; 

I believe&#44; that every thing I see around me&#44; the 
trees&#44; the flowers&#44; the earth&#44; the water&#44; also the sun 
and the moon&#44; and the thousands of bright stars 
that shine so beautifully in the sky&#44; were made by 
the great Creator&#44; whom we call &#34;The Almighty 
God.&#34; 

3. What object do you think God had in creating so many 
varied living creatures&#44; and especially man &#63; 

Their happiness &#58; that is to say&#44; God made them&#44; 
not for his own sake&#44; since He cannot be assisted by 
them&#44; but in order that they might have the means 
and capacities to rejoice in their existence&#44; and to 
become better and wiser by education and the know&#8211; 
ledge of his will. 

                <pb n="2"/>

2 RELIGION IN GENERAL. 

4. &#34;What should we then do to become happy &#63; 

&#34;We should endeavour to obtain a correct know&#8211; 
ledge of those actions which our Creator bids us 
do&#44; and to omit no opportunity to do that which we 
have learned to be the right&#44; and agreeable to his 
will. 

5. What will be the result of this conduct&#63; 

That we shall feel an inward joy&#44; or&#44; as it is called&#44; 
a consciousness of having done right&#44; a repose of 
mind&#44; and a tranquil conscience. 

6. What is meant by Conscience &#63; 

It is that sensation which tells us &#40;if we have 
been correctly instructed&#41; whether we have done 
right or wrong&#59; and if our conduct has been cor&#8211; 
rect&#44; it makes us feel satisfied &#59; but if we have done 
wrong&#44; it makes us ashamed and dissatisfied with 
ourselves. 

7. How would you term these two different states of feeling &#63; 
I would call the first a tranquil conscience&#44; the 

second a disturbed conscience. 

8. What should be your choice&#44; as a reasonable and good 
child &#63; 

I ought to endeavour to have an easy conscience&#44; 
and to do nothing which can in any way disturb it&#44; 
&#39; or make me ashamed of myself. 

9. Can you tell me what you are to do first&#44; in order to obtain 
this&#63; 

I must first of all learn to know what is right&#44; and 
to distinguish between this and what is wrong. 

10. Have you now any idea what is right &#63; 

Yes &#59; if I do what God has commanded us to do&#44; 
l certainly must act correctly &#59; since one so good aa 
Ee is&#44; could teach nothing which is hurtful. 

11. What is wrong&#63; 

To do that which God has forbidden us to do. 






                <pb n="3"/> 



RELIGION IN GENERAL. 3



12. How can you obtain a knowledge of this &#63; 

&#39;By a careful study of religion &#59; that is&#44; those doc&#8211; 
trines and directions which we have received as &#37; 
declaration of the will of God&#44; which we&#44; must learn 
and obey in order to obtain happiness. 

13. What would you call &#34; being religious V 

Not only to know these doctrines and directions&#44; 
and to believe them&#44; but also to obey them and live 
accordingly. 

14. AYhat is the foundation of religion or knowledge of God &#63; 
and from what source do we derive the doctrines of which you 
just now spoke &#63; 

The existence and power of God are taught to us 
by his greatness&#44; which He has manifested in the 
creation and arrangement of external nature &#59; and 
the doctrines of religion&#44; which regard our faith 
and conduct&#44; are derived from the revealed word of 
God. &#44; 

15. What do you understand by the term &#34; external nature&#63;&#34; 

The visible world&#44; which we perceive by our 
senses&#44; as also the whole system of creation. The 
greatness and extreme regularity of all things of 
which we have knowledge&#44; or of which we hear from 
others&#44; all unite in teaching us that there must be a 
God&#44; or Creator supremely great&#44; who has made all&#44; 
and fixed all as we find it. 

lb. How may you call this acknowledgment of God&#63; 

Natural Religion&#44; or religious knowledge and 
faith derived from a study of the Creator&#39;s works. 

17. What is meant by a belief in Revelation &#63; 

That the Lord God made his will known by com&#8211; 
municating to us&#44; in a manner perceptible to our&#44; 
senses&#44; those duties which He has thought proper tp 
give us as the direction for our conduct. 

18. Where do we find these duties described&#63; 

Thev are contained in Holy Writ. 

                <pb n="4"/>
                
4 RELIGION IN GENERAL. 

19. What is Holy Writ&#63; 

A collection of books written by divine inspi&#8211; 
ration. 

20. What do you call &#34; Inspiration &#63;&#34; 

Inspiration is the knowledge of the truth which 
God imparted to men of great piety&#44; who were par&#8211; 
ticularly sincere in serving Him. He gave them 
this knowledge in order that they might teach to 
other men the duties they ought to observe&#44; that 
they might thereby obtain happiness and felicity. 



21. How should we regard this Holy Writ &#63; 






As the word of God&#44; kindly sent us from heaven 
to teach us how to please God by our actious. 

22. How do we call the doctrines contained in Holy Writ 
collectively&#63; 

The Revealed Religion. 

23. Do Revealed and Natural Religion agree &#63; 

Yes &#59; because both are the gift of God &#58; both are 
addressed to our reason&#44; and can therefore not con&#8211; 
tradict each other. 

24. What would you call those ideas whicn are not taught 
either by Revealed or Natural Religion &#63; 

Irreligion&#44; superstition&#44; and false belief. 

25. Do all men belong to the same religion&#63; 

No &#59; there are different species of religion &#59; but 
they all agree in acknowledging a Supreme Being&#44; 
to whom mankind are bound to render adoration. 

26. In what do men differ &#63; 

Men are not of the same opinion concerning the 
word of God&#44; and serve not the Lord in the same 
manner. 

27. What is the cause of this difference &#63;&#42; 

At first all men had the same knowledge of God&#39;s 
will &#59; but by degrees superstition and false belief 

&#42; This question might be omitted in the first reading of the book. 

                <pb n="5"/>

RELIGION IN GENERAL. 5

were intermixed by wicked men with the pure truth 
which they had received&#44; and they taught their chil&#8211; 
dren not the correct knowledge of the Lord. In 
this manner different nations by degrees obtained 
different versions of the Holy Word of God&#59; and 
these differences are called different religious sys&#8211; 
tems &#59; whereas&#44; in point of fact&#44; there is but one 
true religion&#44; the one taught in the books of Holy 
Writ contained in the Bible. 

28. What do you understand by &#34;Irreligion&#63;&#34; 

Actions contrary to the doctrines contained in 
Holy Writ&#44; or a denial of the Divine power. 

29. What is &#34; Superstition V 

Superstition is when we look upon things not 
commanded in the Bible as of religious importance&#44; 
or when we imagine certain unimportant things to 
have consequences which they naturally do not 
possess. 

30. What is &#34; False Belief&#63;&#34; 

False belief is that awful error which men are 
guilty of When they imagine that any thing can be 
possessed of Divine power&#44; except the great Creator 
alone. Likewise&#44; to imagine that the Creator is 
divided into different persons&#44; or that He is liable 
to change or death. Such false belief we call 

IDOLATRY. 

31. You have mentioned the word Bible &#58; what is it&#63; 

The collection of books of Holy Writ. 

32. In how many parts do you divide the Bible&#63; 

Into three &#58;&#8212; The Law&#44; or Torah&#44; containing the 
directions and commandments of Keligion &#59; the Pro&#8211; 
phets&#44; or Nebeeim&#44; containing historical records 
and foretellings of future events &#59; and the Hagio&#8211; 
grapha&#44; Holy Writings&#44; or Ketoobim&#44; containing 
psalms&#44; moral reflections&#44; and historical records of a 
later period than the prophets. 

                <pb n="6"/>

6 THE MOSAIC RELIGION. 

33. What do you now understand by speaking of a particular 
Religion &#63; 

The belief which&#44; a nation or a people are attached 
to&#44; the system which they have received&#44; and by the 
doctrines of which they endeavour to act. 

34. Is it right to quarrel about difference in Religion &#63; 

No &#59; belief is a matter over which every person 
must be permitted to decide in his own conscience&#44; 
according to the knowledge which has been given 
him &#59; it is wrong to hate or despise any one because 
he has a different belief from ourselves. &#44; 

&#47; 



CHAPTER n. 

THE MOSAIC RELIGION IN PARTICULAR. 

1. What religion do you profess &#63; 

I believe in the Mosaic Religion&#44; which was re&#8211; 
vealed by the Lord &#59; and I esteem the same as the 
true&#44; pure&#44; and unmixed word of God. 

2. Are you firmly convinced of the truth of this belief&#63; 

I am firmly and completely convinced of the 
truth thereof&#44; for the following reason &#58; because the 
Mosaic Religion is based upon that celebrated reve&#8211; 
lation which God imparted in the immediate pre&#8211; 
sence of a whole people&#44; amidst extraordinary signs 
and wonders. 

3. What is the peculiar distinguishing feature of the Mosaic 
Religion &#63; 

It teaches that there is but one God&#44; aod that He 
is incorporeal and indivisible &#59; that is to say&#44; that 
there exists no other being who has power to create 
any thing&#44; or to destroy the least of these things 
which God has made. That this God 4oep no 1

THE MOSAIC KELIGION. 7

possess a material figure like all those things which 
we can perceive by our senses&#44; which are called 
corporeal or bodily substances &#59; and that lastly&#44; He 
cannot by any means be divided into different parts&#44; 
being always the same&#44; and not liable to change. 

4. Whence is the name &#34;Mosaic Religion&#34; derived&#63; 

From Moses&#44; the son of Amram&#44; of the tribe of 
Levi&#44; through whom God communicated his law to 
the people of Israel. So also teaches the Bible &#58; 

&#34; Remember ye the law of Moses my servant&#44; to whom I 
commanded on Horeb statutes and judgments for all Israel.&#34; 
Malachi iii. 22. 

5. Was not the Deity known and worshipped already before 
Moses &#63; 

Yes&#59; for the patriarchs&#44; and even before them 
Enoch and Noah&#44; acknowledged the Lord God&#44; and 
worshipped Him. 

&#34; Enoch walked with God&#44; and was no more here&#59; for God 
had taken him away.&#34; Genesis v. 24. 

&#34; Noah was a righteous&#44; upright man in his generation &#58; 
Noah walked with God.&#34; Ibid. vi. 9. 

6. Who were the Patriarchs &#63; 

The original fathers of the Israelitish people&#44; now 
called the Jews&#58; these were Abraham&#44; Isaac&#44; and 
Jacob or Israel. 

&#34;And He &#40;God&#41; spoke&#44; I am the God of thy fathers&#44; the 
God of Abraham&#44; the God of Isaac&#44; and the God of Jacob.&#34; 
Exodus iii. 6. 

7. Why is Abraham called the first Patriarch&#63; 

Because he was the first with whom God made a 
covenant on account of his piety and devotion to the 
service of the Lord. 

&#34;And Abraham fell on his face&#44; and God spoke with him 
as lblloweth&#44; As for me&#44; behold &#33; my covenant is with thee&#44; 
and thou shalt become the father of many nations.&#34; Genesis 
xvii. 3&#44; 4. 

2&#42; 

                <pb n="8"/>

8 THE MOSAIC RELIGION. 

8. In what consisted the covenant on the part of Abraham &#63; 

In the circumcision of all the males of his family &#59; 
for this was to be the sign of the consecration to 
Divine service&#44; which Abraham covenanted&#44; that is&#44; 
agreed&#44; to perform in himself and his descendants 
during all succeeding ages. 

&#34; And my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting 
covenant.&#34; Genesis xvii. 13. 

9. What was the covenant on the part of God &#63; 

That He would bestow his peculiar favour on 
Abraham and his descendants&#44; as a reward of their 
obedience to his will. As we read &#58; 

&#34;And I will establish my covenant between me and between 
thee&#44; and thy descendants after thee&#44; in all their generations&#44; 
for an everlasting covenant&#44; to be a God unto thee and to thy 
descendants after thee.&#34; Ibid. 7. 

10. To whom was the observance of this covenant commanded&#63; 

Only the family of the patriarchs and those be&#8211; 
longing to them were bound to its observance &#59; but 
it was not required of any others. 

11. Did God make himself known to the Patriarchs &#63; 

Yes&#59; for He appeared to them at times in nightly 
dreams and indistinct visions&#44; to make known unto 
them his will. 

&#34; After these events came the word of the Lord unto Abram 
in a vision&#44; saying&#44; Fear not&#44; Abram&#44; I am thy shield&#44; thy 
reward is very great.&#34; Ibid. xv. 1. 

&#34;And the Lord spoke to Israel in the dream of the night&#44; 
and said&#44; Jacob&#44; Jacob&#33; and he said&#44; Here am I.&#34; Ibid 
xlvi. 2. 

12. By what name did God make himself known to Abraham 
Isaac&#44; and Jacob &#63; 

He appeared to them as El Shadday&#44; the Al&#8211; 
mighty God&#44; whose power is not limited by that of 
any existing being&#44; and who is able to execute and 
do all that He desires. 

                <pb n="9"/>

THE MOSAIC RELIGION. 9

&#34; And the Lord appeared to Abram&#44; and said to him&#44; I 
am the God Shadday&#44; walk before me and be perfect.&#34; Genesis 

xvii. 1. &#95; 

&#34; And God spoke with Moses&#44; and said to him&#44; I am the 
Everlasting One &#58; I appeared unto Abraham&#44; unto Isaac&#44; and 
unto Jacob&#44; as God Shadday.&#34; Exodus vi. 2&#44; 3. 

13. In what manner did the Patriarchs worship the God 
Shadday &#63; 

They feared God&#44; and believed truly in his word 
and promises &#59; they built altars in honour of Him&#44; 
and confided in his power. 

&#34;And he &#40;Abraham&#41; believed in the Lord&#44; and He ac&#8211; 
counted to him as righteousness.&#34; Genesis xv. 6. 

&#34;And Jacob erected a pillar of stone in the place where 
He had spoken with him&#59; and he poured a drink&#8211;offering 
thereon&#44; and he poured oil thereon. And Jacob called the 
place where God had spoken with him&#44; Beth&#8211;el &#40;the house 
of God&#41;.&#34; Ibid. xxxv. 14&#44; 15. 

14. Do you know the name of the country in which the Patri&#8211; 
archs lived &#63; 

It was called the country of Canaan&#44; and is situ&#8211; 
ated on the eastern side of the Mediterranean Sea. 
This country God promised to Abraham as the 
peculiar property of his children &#59; and it is therefore 
called the Land of Promise&#44; also Palestine&#44; the Holy 
Land&#44; or the Land of Israel. 

&#34;And I will give unto thee&#44; and to thy descendants after 
thee&#44; the land wherein thou sojournest&#44; all the land of Ca&#8211; 
naan&#44; for an everlasting possession &#59; and I will be their God.&#34; 
Ibid. xvii. 8. 

15. Can you recite any passages from Scripture wherein is 
mentioned the peculiar protection which God promised to Abra&#8211; 
ham&#44; to Isaac&#44; and to Jacob &#63; 

To Abraham it was said&#58; 

&#34;And I will make thee a great nation&#44; and I will bless 
thee&#44; and make thy name great&#59; and thou shalt be a blessing&#59; 
and I will bless them that bless thee&#44; and curse him that 
curseth thee &#59; and in thee shall be blessed all the families of 
the earth.&#34; Ibid. xii. 2&#44; 3. 

                <pb n="10"/>

10 THE MOSAIC RELIGION. 

To Isaac was promised &#58; 

&#34;Sojourn in this land&#44; and I will be with thee&#44; and will 
bless thee j for unto thee and unto thy seed I will give all 
these countries&#44; and I will perform the oath which I have 
sworn unto Abraham thy father&#59; and I will multiply thy seed 
as the stars of heaven&#59; and I will give unto thy seed all these 
countries &#59; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth 
be blessed&#47;&#39; Genesis xxvi. 8&#44; 4. 

And lastly&#44; concerning Jacob we read &#58; 
&#34;And behold the Lord stood above it and said&#44; I am the 
Lord God of Abraham thy father&#44; and the God of Isaac&#59; the 
land&#44; whereon thou liest&#44; I will give to thee and thy descend&#8211; 
ants &#41; and thy descendants shall be as the dust of the earth&#44; 
and thou shalt spread abroad to the west&#44; and to the east&#44; 
and to the north&#44; and to the south &#58; and in thee and in thy 
seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.&#34; Ibid&#44; 
xxviii. 13&#44; 14. 

16. Had Abraham and Isaac any children who were not in&#8211; 
cluded in the great nation that was to descend from Abraham &#63; 

Yes &#59; for Abraham had Ishmael and other sons&#44; 

and Isaac had Esau&#44; who were not included in the 

great nation through whom all the world should be 

blessed &#59; for this promise was given only to the whole 

family of Jacob. 

17. Of how many persons did this family consist&#63; 

Of twelve sons&#44; who were the parents of the 
twelve tribes&#44; or families into which the people of 
Israel were formerly divided. 

18. You just now said that the Patriarchs lived in the land of 
Canaan&#58; did Jacob and his sons always continue to live there&#63; 

]STo &#59; Joseph&#44; one of these sons&#44; had been sold by 
his brothers as a slave to some Ishmaelitish mer&#8211; 
chants who traded to Egypt&#44; a country situated on 
the northeastern corner of Africa &#59; where&#44; by direc&#8211; 
tion of God&#44; he was at last made the chief officer of 
the king of Egypt &#59; and when his father heard&#44; after 
many years&#44; that he was yet alive&#44; he was induced 
to go there to see his son Joseph before he died.

19. Be good enough to give me some farther account of what 
took place in consequence &#63; 

When Jacob had arrived&#44; the king of Egypt&#44; called 
Pharaoh&#44; told Joseph to give his father and brothers 
as much land as they wanted in the country of Go&#8211; 
shen&#44; one of the divisions of Egypt &#59; Joseph did so&#44; 
and the family of Jacob settled there in peace and 
security. But when Jacob&#44; Joseph&#44; and all the 
people of that time&#44; had died&#44; and when the Egyp&#8211; 
tians found that the Israelites grew to be a numerous 
people&#44; they began to be afraid of them&#44; and resolved 
to injure them. 

20. By what means did they try to do this &#63; 

As the Egyptians were the strongest in number&#44; 
that is to say&#44; that there were more Egyptians than 
Israelites&#44; they compelled these to work for them as 
slaves&#44; and they treated them with great cruelty. 

&#34;And the Egyptians made the children of Israel labour 
with rigour &#58; and they made their lives bitter with hard bond&#8211; 
age&#44; in mortar&#44; and in brick&#44; and in all manner of service in 
the field.&#34; Exodus i. 13&#44; 14. 

21. Was hard labour the only consequence of the cruelty of 
the Egyptians &#63; 

By no means &#59; the faith which the patriarchs pro&#8211; 
fessed was in a great measure forgotten during a 
slavery which lasted nearly two hundred years&#44; and 
the Israelites by degrees learned the idolatry and 
false belief of the Egyptians. 

22. By what means was the true faith again restored&#63; 

When the sufferings of the Israelites had become 
very great&#44; God sent Iris servant&#44; the prophet Moses&#44; 
to ask of the king of Egypt to let Israel go free &#59; 
and when this was refused&#44; Moses wrought unheard&#8211; 
of wonders by Divine power&#44; and at length delivered 
the Israelites&#44; and led them out from the land of 
Egypt. 

&#34;And Israel saw the great work which the Lord had done 

                <pb n="12"/>

upon the Egyptians &#58; and the people feared the Lord&#44; and 
believed in the Lord&#44; and in Moses his servant.&#34; Exodus 
xiv. 31. 

23. &#34;Was this all that Moses was the instrument of doing for 
the people of Israel &#63; 

It was but the first act of the mission which God 

sent him to perform. 

24. Can you tell me the other purpose for which God used 
him &#63; 

He was chosen as the means to unite Israel in the 
second and permanent covenant with God. 

&#34;Face to face the Lord spoke with you on the mount&#44; 
from the midst of the fire&#59; I stood between the Lord and 
you at that time&#44; to tell unto you the word of the Lord &#59; for 
ye were afraid of the fire&#44; and ye ascended not the mount.&#34; 
Deuteronomy v. 4&#44; 5. 

25. In what consisted the second covenant &#63; 

The Israelites accepted for themselves and their 
latest descendants the laws of God&#39;s holy religion. 

&#34; The Lord our God made with us a covenant on Horeb. 
Not with our forefathers made the Lord this covenant&#44; but 
with ourselves&#44; who are here all alive this day.&#34; Ibid. 2&#44; 3. 

26. In what manner was this covenant made &#63; 

God&#44; the Lord&#44; descended in his glory on Mount 
Sinai&#44; also called Horeb&#44; and announced to all the 
people of Israel&#44; who were there assembled&#44; his 
holy law&#59; and all the people said&#58; &#34;We will do 
and obey.&#34; 

&#34;And the Lord descended upon Mount Sinai&#44; on the top 
of the mount&#44; and the Lord called Moses unto the top of tho 
mount&#44; and Moses went up.&#34; Exodus xix. 20. 

27. How is this covenant called in Scripture &#63; 

The covenant on Horeb&#44; or the revelation and 
Divine legislation on Sinai. This revelation also we 
consider as the holiest and greatest of all revela&#8211; 
tions known to us. 

                <pb n="13"/>

THE MOSAIC RELIGION. 13

28. Why do you call it the holiest&#63; 

First Because God revealed himself&#44; that is&#44; He 
made himself known to the whole people&#44; which 
never took place upon any other occasion&#59; as we 
read &#58; 

&#34;And all the people perceived the thunders and the 
names&#44; and the sound of the cornet&#44; and the smoking mount.&#34; 
Genesis xx. 15. 

Secondly. The ten commandments made known 
Oil that day were afterwards written upon two tables 
of stone by the finger of God. 

&#34;And when He had finished speaking to Moses upon 
Mount Sinai&#44; He gave him the two tables of the testimony 
tables of stone&#44; written with the finger of Grod.&#34;Exod.xxxi. 18. 

Thirdly. The tables of the testimony were kept as 
the most holy thing in the ark of the covenant. 

&#34;And he &#40;Moses&#41; took the testimony and placed it in the 
ark &#59; placed the staves on the ark&#44; and put the mercy&#8211;seat on 
the ark above the same.&#34; Ibid. xl. 20. 

&#34; There was nothing in the ark but the two tables of stone&#44; 
which Moses had put there at Horeb&#44; when the Lord made a 
covenant with the children of Israel&#44; when they went out of 
the land of Egypt.&#34; 1 Kings viii. 9. 

29. Where did the revelation of the other commandments tak« 
plaee &#63; 

Likewise at Sinai&#44; in the first instance &#59; but no 
more than the ten commandments were told to the 
whole people by God &#59; but He told them to Moses&#44; 
who had to tell them afterwards to the people of 
Israel. 

&#34;And the Lord said to Moses&#44; Ascend unto me upon the 
mount and remain there&#44; and I will give thee the tables of 
stone&#44; the law and the commandment which I have written&#44; to 
teach them. &#8212; And Moses went into the cloud and ascended 
the mount&#44; and Moses stayed upon the mount forty days and 
forty nights.&#34; Exodus xxiv. 12&#44; 18. 

30. Can you state to me something of the subsequent history 

                <pb n="14"/>

14 THE MOSAIC KELIGION. 

of the people&#44; after the revelation on Sinai&#44; which is closely con&#8211; 
nected with the revelation of the law &#63; 

After the Israelites had remained for nearly a 
whole year in the wilderness of Sinai&#44; they travelled 
farther in the direction of the land of Canaan&#44; in 
order to take possession of it&#44; &#8212; the land which God 
had &#40;as we said already&#41; promised to Abraham&#44; for 
an everlasting possession to his descendants. As 
they were now no longer near Horeb&#44; the few re&#8211; 
maining laws&#44; not already made known to them&#44; 
were told to Moses from the mercy&#8211;seat&#44; as the cover 
of the ark of the testimony was called. 

&#34;And when Moses went into the tabernacle of the congre&#8211; 
gation to speak with Him&#44; he heard the voice speaking nnto 
him from off the mercy&#8211;seat that was upon the ark of the 
testimony&#44; from between the two cherubim &#58; and thus did He 
speak with him.&#34; Numbers vii. 89. 

31. Is there any difference in the holiness of the command&#8211; 
ments first given to Abraham&#44; and afterwards to Moses in Egypt&#44; 
on Horeb&#44; and from the mercy&#8211;seat&#44; and the ten commandments&#44; 
spoken before the whole people &#63; 

&#34;No &#59; they are all alike the will of God&#44; and there&#8211; 
fore we are bound to obey the whole of them as the 
best source of our happiness. 

&#34;AH the commandments which I command you this day 
you must observe to do&#44; in order that you may live&#44; and 
multiply&#44; and go and possess the land&#44; which the Lord swore 
unto your fathers.&#34; Deut. viii. 1. 

32. You said above that God revealed himself to the Patriarchs 
in nightly dreams and in indistinct visions &#58; did He appear to 
Moses in a similar manner&#63; 

No &#59; God spoke to Moses&#44; as the Bible expresses it&#44; 
face to face&#44; as one man speaks to another&#59; meaning&#44; 
that Moses was awake&#44; conscious of what took place&#44; 
and heard with perfect distinctness the command&#8211; 
ments as they were spoken to him. 

&#34;And he said&#44; Hear now my words&#58; If there be a prophet 
like you&#44; I the Lord make myself known to him in a vision&#44; 
speak with him in a dream &#59; not so is my servant Moses&#44; who 

                <pb n="15"/>

THE MOSAIC RELIGION. 15

is faithful in all my house. Mouth to mouth I speak with 
him&#44; even apparently&#44; and not in dark speeches &#59; and he be&#8211; 
holdeth the similitude of the Lord.&#34; Numbers xii. 6&#8211;8. 

33. How is Moses&#44; therefore&#44; to be considered &#63; 

AVe must consider him as the greatest of prophets 
and lawgivers&#59; and as the benefactor of all mankind 
no less than of our people in particular. 

34. Why do you say that Moses was the greatest prophet&#63; 

Because the Bible testifies concerning him &#58; 

&#34; And there arose not a prophet in Israel like unto Moses&#44; 
whom the Lord knew face to face&#47;&#39; Deut. xxxiv. 10. 

35. How is this expression to be understood&#63; 

That Moses had more knowledge of the wisdom 
and goodness of God than any man who lived before 
him&#44; or any one that will come after him&#59; and that 
he was more than any other person the means of 
spreading a knowledge of the true and ever&#8211;living 
God&#44; the sole Creator and incorporeal Ruler&#44; among 
the people of Israel&#44; from whom it will at last be 
carried to all the children of man. 

36. Under what name did God announce himself to Moses &#63; 

He called himself the Everlasting and Unending 
One&#44; He who was&#44; who is&#44; and who will be. 

&#34;And He spoke to Moses&#44; I am He that ever will be &#58; and 
He said&#44; Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel&#44; I Will 
Be hath sent me to you.&#34; Exodus iii. 14. 

37. Why do you say that Moses was the greatest legislator&#63; 

Because the laws which he taught are. founded 
upon the wisdom of God&#44; and&#44; being given by Ilim&#44; 
they will stand for ever. 

38. Why is he the benefactor of the whole human family&#63; 

Because Moses was the first&#44; and the only one&#44; 
who received the law of God from heaven&#44; and 
taught mankind thereby how they can live in a 
manner pleasing to the Lord. All the later pro&#8211; 
phets and legislators&#44; as also all teachers of morals 

                <pb n="16"/>

16 THE MOSAIC RELIGION. 

and religion&#44; followed but in the way he pointed 
out&#44; since no new doctrine or any practicable virtue 
has been made known to men after the death of 
Moses. 

39. Why is he called the particular benefactor of our people &#63; 
Because the law was in the first instance taught 

to our forefathers&#44; they being the children of the 
patriarchs&#44; with whom&#44; as we said&#44; the Lord had 
made a covenant that He would be a God to them&#44; 
and to their children after them. By its possession&#44; 
also&#44; we have at all times since the revelation on 
Sinai been blessed with a knowledge of Divine 
truths&#44; and of the manner by which we could please 
our Heavenly King&#44; even whilst all the rest of man&#8211; 
kind were believers in false religions&#44; and did those 
things which are hateful in the sight of God. Thus 
we also read &#58; 

&#34; The law which Moses commanded us is an inheritance of 
the congregation of Jacob.&#34; Deut. xxxiii. 4. 

40. Can you tell me the chief articles of belief which the 
Mosaic Religion demands&#63; 

First The belief in one only God&#44; and in the 
superintending providence of this God. 

Second. The belief in the religion revealed by God 
through the means of Moses and the other prophets&#44; 
and in the permanence of this religion. 

Third. The belief in a reward of the good and a 
punishment of the evil we have done after our death&#44; 
even if in our present life we may escape the punish&#8211; 
ment or hot receive the reward due to our actions.

CHAPTER m 

GOD AND HIS ATTRIBUTES. 

1. What is the first article of the Jewish faith&#63; 

I believe firmly and truly that there is one God&#44; 
who has created the heavens&#44; the earth&#44; and all 
creatures which are therein &#59; I farther believe that 
the Lord God preserves his creatures by his con&#8211; 
tinual watchfulness&#44; and that He governs all by his 
all&#8211;seeing care &#59; and that&#44; lastly&#44; He ordains the fate 
of all his creatures &#59; that is to say&#44; that nothing ever 
happens to them which He has not ordained or sent 
to them. 

&#34; Therefore&#44; T will judge you&#44; house of Israel&#44; every one 
according to his ways&#44; saith the Lord God.&#34; Ezekiel xviii. 30. 

&#34; By the word of the Lord were the heavens made&#44; and all 
their host with the breath of his mouth. He gathereth to&#8211; 
gether as a heap the waters of the sea&#44; He layeth up the 
depths in storehouses.&#34; Psalms xxxiii. 6&#44; 7. 

&#34;All these wait upon thee&#44; to give them their food in due 
season&#59; they gather that which thou providest for them&#59; 
Thou openest thy hand&#44; and they are filled with good &#59; Thou 
hidest thy face&#44; they are troubled &#59; Thou takest away their 
breath&#44; they perish and return to their dust &#59; Thou sendest 
forth thy spirit&#44; they are created &#58; thus Thou renewest the 
face of the earth.&#34; Psalms civ. 27&#8211;30. 

&#34; He made heaven and earth&#44; the sea and all that is there&#8211; 
in&#59; He keepeth truth for ever&#59; He executeth judgment for 
the oppressed&#59; He giveth bread to the hungry. The Lord 
looseneth the prisoners&#59; the Lord openeth the eyes of the 
blind&#59; the Lord raiseth those who are bowed down&#59; the Lord 
loveth the righteous &#59; the Lord protecteth strangers &#59; He re&#8211; 
lieveth the fatherless and the widow&#59; but the way of the 
wicked He overthroweth.&#34; Ibid&#44; cxlvi. 6&#8211;9. 

2. Are you convinced of the existence of God &#63; 

Yes&#59; I am firmly convinced that there is a Crea&#8211; 

                <pb n="18"/>

18 GOD AND HIS ATTRIBUTES. 

tor. For every thing which I find in every direction 
around me must have been made by some one more 
powerful than every such thing itself is &#59; and this 
superior power&#44; as I have said before&#44; I call God the 
Creator&#44; He who first caused every being to have 
existence&#44; shape&#44; and form. 

&#34;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&#34; 
Genesis i. 1. 

&#34; Raise your eyes to heaven&#44; and see who hath created 
these&#44; that bringeth out their host by number&#44; calleth them 
all by name.&#34; Isaiah xl. 26. 

3. Could not Chance have produced the world &#59; that is to say&#44; 
could the world not have been made as we find it&#44; without design 
by an intelligent Creator &#63; 

&#59; chance cannot have any order or regularity &#59; 
but we find in every part of the universe that it 
is governed by fixed laws&#44; and that the greatest 
regularity prevails in every thing&#59; and this could 
only have been made by a wise and intelligent 
Maker. . 9 

i Thus saith the Lord who giveth the sun for a light by 
day&#44; and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a 
light by night&#44; who shaketh the sea that its waves roar&#44; the 
Lord of Hosts is his name.&#34; Jeremiah xxxi. 35. 

&#34; Praise Him&#44; ye sun and moon &#59; praise Him&#44; all ye stars 
of light&#59; praise Him&#44; ye heavens of heavens&#44; and ye waters 
that are above the heavens&#59; let them praise the name of the 
Lord&#44; for he commanded&#44; and they were created. He also 
established them for ever and ever &#58; He gave a decree which 
shall not pass away.&#34; Psalms cxlviii. 3&#8211;6. 

4. Can we see God &#63; 

~No &#59; God is a spirit and cannot be seen by human 
eyes. 

&#34; And he said to him &#40;Moses&#41;&#44; Thou canst not see my face&#44; 
for no man can see me and live.&#34; Exodus xxxiii. 20. 

&#34; Take ye&#44; therefore&#44; good heed unto yourselves&#44; for ye saw 
no manner of figure on the day that the Lord spoke with you 
on Horeb&#44; out of the midst of the fire.&#34; Deut. iv. 15. 

                <pb n="19"/>

GOD AND HIS ATTRIBUTES. 19

5. You said &#34;God is a Spirit&#59;&#34; what do you mean by 

&#34;Spirit&#63;&#34; 

A living&#44; invisible being&#44; which is nevertheless 
possessed of power&#44; reason&#44; and will. 

6. How can such a being be known &#63; 

Through the spirit dwelling in man &#59; that is to 
say&#44; we can recognise or discover a spirit through 
the working of our soul or mind&#44; which is likewise 
a spirit. 

7. Is man then a Spirit&#63; 

Not as far as his body is concerned&#44; which can be 
seen and felt&#59; but the power through which this 
body moves&#44; breathes&#44; thinks&#44; and lives&#44; is a spirit&#44; 
acting without being known&#44; and is not seen by the 
eyes&#59; or&#44; in other words&#44; we are composed of body 
and soul&#44; of matter and spirit. 

8. How do you now wish to be understood by saying that 
God is known to us &#63; 

&#39;We know Him through the knowledge which He 
has placed within our sduls. He has given us intel&#8211; 
lect and thought more than to any other animated 
thing with which we are acquainted&#59; and planted 
in us a spirit which is not like the outward world&#44; 
in order that we might understand his ways and 
acknowledge Him. as our Creator. I would call this 
briefly&#44; God has revealed himself to our spirit. 

&#34; I thank Thee that I am so fearfully&#44; wonderfully made &#59; 
incomprehensibly wonderful are thy works&#44; this my soul 
knoweth right well.&#34; Psalms exxxix. 14. 

9. In what manner did God reveal himself to our spirit&#63; 
First&#44; Through the Creation &#58; all nature proves 

that it had a Creator&#44; that his power is without end 
or limit &#59; and thus is God visible to our mind through 
his works. 

&#34; The heavens declare the glory of God&#44; and the expanse 
tells of the work of bis hands.&#34; Ibid. xix. 2. 

3&#42; 

                <pb n="20"/>

20 GOD AND HIS ATTRIBUTES. 

Secondly&#44; Through the Holy Scriptures &#58; God is 
known to us by his holy word. 

&#34; He made known his ways to Moses&#44; his wonderful deeds 
unto the children of Israel.&#34; Psalms ciii. 7. 

10. What do we farther learn from the works and the revela&#8211; 
tion of God &#63; 

That God is the most perfect spirit. 

11. What do you mean by &#34;the most perfect Spirit&#63;&#34; 
That in Him there exist power&#44; wisdom&#44; and will&#44; 

in the highest degree. God is perfect in all his 
qualities&#59; there is nothing defective in his power&#44; 
for He is able to do whatever he desires &#59; He is the 
Author of all wisdom&#44; and his happiness is without 
any mixture of sorrow or suffering. 

&#34;Who is like unto Thee&#44; Lord&#33; among the mighty&#63; 
who is like Thee&#44; glorious in holiness&#44; tremendous in praises&#44; 
working miracles &#63;&#34; Exodus xv. 11. 

&#34; There is none like Thee&#44; Lord &#33; Thou art great&#44; and 
great is thy name in might. Who should not fear Thee&#44; 
King of the nations&#63; for to Thee it doth appertain &#59; for among 
the wise men of the nations&#44; and in all their kingdoms&#44; there 
is none like Thee.&#34; Jer. x. 6&#44; 7. 

&#34; With Him is wisdom and might &#59; Hib are counsel and 
understandino&#59;. &#44;&#44; Job xii. 13. 



&#44;9 



12. How do we call these perfect qualities &#63; 
God&#39;s attributes and ways. 

&#34;The way of God is perfect&#59; the word of the Lord is 
tried &#59; He is a buckler to all those who trust in Hirn.&#34; 2 
Samuel xxii. 31. 

&#34; For my thoughts are not your thoughts&#44; nor are your 
ways my ways&#44; saith the Lord &#59; for as the heavens are higher 
than the earth&#44; so are my ways higher than your ways&#44; and 
my thoughts than your thoughts.&#34; Isaiah lv. 8&#44; 9. 

13. What does Holy Writ teach us concerning the nature of 
God&#63; 

First. That the Lord is one and the only God&#59; 

there is no deity beside Him. 

                <pb n="21"/>

GOD AND HIS ATTRIBUTES. 21

&#34; Hear&#44; Israel&#44; the Lord our God&#44; the Lord is one.&#34; 
Deut. vi. 4. 

&#34; Know&#44; therefore&#44; this day&#44; and reflect in thy heart&#44; that 
the Lord is God in heaven above&#44; and on the earth beneath&#44; 
there is none else.&#34; Ibid. iv. 39. 

&#34;I am the Lord&#44; and none else&#44; there is no god beside 
me. &#8212; I form the light and create darkness &#59; I make&#44; peace 
and create evil&#59; I the Lord do all these things.&#34; Isaiah 
xlv. 5&#8211;7. 

Secondly. That God is an everlasting being&#59; He 
has had no beginning&#44; and cannot have an end &#59; we 
cannot imagine a time when He was not&#44; nor think 
of a period when He will be no more &#59; He was&#44; He 
is&#44; and He ever will be. 

&#34; Thus speaketh the Lord&#44; Israel&#39;s King and Redeemer&#63; 
the Lord of the universe &#40;Zebaoth&#41;&#44; I am the first and I am 
the last&#44; and without me there is no god.&#34; Ibid. xliv. 6. 

&#34; Before the mountains were brought forth&#44; or ever Thou 
hadst formed the earth and the world &#59; even from everlasting 
to everlasting&#44; Thou art God.&#34; Psalms xc. 2. 

Thirdly. God is a self&#8211;existent&#44; unchangeable 
Being. He received not his existence and power 
from any other being&#44; and He suffers no change with 
increase of years and change of circumstances. He 
is and lives through his own power&#44; and is always 
the same. 

&#34;I&#44; the Lord&#44; change not&#59; and you&#44; sons of Jacob&#44; shall 
not cease to be.&#34; Malachi iii. 6. 

&#34;Of old hast Thou laid the foundation of the earth&#44; and 
the heavens are the work of thy hands. They will perish&#44; but 
Thou wilt subsist&#59; yea&#44; they will wax old as a garment&#44; as a 
vesture Thou wilt change them&#44; and they will be altered. 
But Thou art the same&#44; and thy years have no end.&#34; Psalms 
cii. 26&#8211;28. 

14. What would you derive from the latter doctrine&#44; that God 
is unchangeable &#63; 

That the promises of God are likewise unchange&#8211; 
able&#44; and that He promises nothing which will not 

                <pb n="22"/>

22 GOD AND HIS ATTRIBUTES. 

ultimately be strictly fulfilled. For&#44; as He is un&#8211; 
changeable himself&#44; He cannot say any thing which 
He would afterwards be unwilling or unable to exe&#8211; 
cute&#44; as this would prove an uncertainty of purpose&#44; 
which is in fact a change&#44; or an inability to do his 
will&#44; which is a want of power. 

&#34; God is not a man that He should lie&#44; nor a son of man 
that He should repent&#58; hath He said&#44; and shall He not do it&#63; 
or hath He spoken&#44; and not fulfil it &#63;&#34; Numbers xxiii. 19. 

&#34; And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent &#59; 
for He is not a man that He should repent.&#34; 1 Samuel xv. 29. 

15. What do the Scriptures teach concerning the attributes of 
God&#63; 

First. God is almighty&#59; He can at all times do 
whatever He wills. 

&#34;Let all the earth fear the Lord&#44; let all the inhabitants 
of the world stand in awe of Him. For He spoke&#44; and it 
was done &#59; He commanded&#44; and it was established&#47;&#39; Psalms 
xxxiii. 8&#44; 9. 

Secondly. God is the wisest of all beings&#44; or&#44; as it 
is called&#44; He is all&#8211;wise&#44; or the Supreme Wisdom. 
He&#44; therefore&#44; always uses the best means to attain 
the best results &#59; that is&#44; the means He employs to 
do any thing are the best possible for that purpose&#44; 
and nothing that He attempts is otherwise than wise 
and beneficial. 

&#34; Dost thou not know &#63; or hast thou not heard &#63; the God 
of everlasting is the Lord&#44; He created the ends of the earth&#59; 
He is not fatigued&#44; and He is not weary&#59; there is no searching 
of his understanding&#47;&#39; Isaiah xl. 28. 

&#34; But wisdom&#44; where is it found&#59; and where is the place 
of understanding&#63; Man knoweth not its value&#44; it is not 
found in the land of the living. It is hidden from the eyes 
of all living&#44; and concealed from the fowl of heaven. God 
alone understandeth its way&#44; and He knoweth its place.&#34; Job 
xxviii. 12&#44; 13&#44; 21&#44; 24. 

16. Where do you find the proofs of this Supreme Wisdom &#63; 

The whole mass of created things forms but one 

                <pb n="23"/>

GOD AND HIS ATTRIBUTES. 23

chain of beings &#59; that is to say&#44; as in a chain one 
link is connected with and supports those next to 
it&#44; so is one being depending upon and connected 
with the others&#44; and forms thus one link&#44; as it were&#44; 
of the great chain of creatures which were pro 
duced by the will of the Great Supreme. &#95; There it&#63; 
no break anywhere to be found&#44; all is in unison 
and harmony&#44; and nothing is which has not its use 
and its object. 

&#34; The Lord hath with wisdom founded the earth&#44; ordained 
the heavens with understanding.&#34; Prov. iii. 19. 

17. You say&#44; There is nothing which has not its use and 
object&#59; can Ave always discover them ourselves&#63; 

Not in every case &#59; but of so many things do we 
readily find out for what they are useful and why 
they were so made&#44; that we must reasonably con&#8211; 
clude that the others&#44; which we do not know so 
well&#44; are equally useful&#44; and the effects of wisdom 
and foresight. 

18. What else do the Scriptures teach concerning the attributes 
of God&#63; 

Thirdly. God is omnipresent &#59; that is to say&#44; He 
is present in every place in the whole universe&#59; 
there is&#44; consequently&#44; no spot in heaven or earth 
where God is not&#44; and where He does not live and 
act. 

&#34;Am I then but a God at hand&#44; saith the Lord&#44; and not 
also a God afar off &#63; Could a man so hide himself in a secret 
place that I could not see him&#63; saith the Lord&#59; do I not 
fill the heavens to the earth&#63; saith the Lord.&#34; Jeremiah 
win. s.o w4. 

&#34; Whither shall I go from thy spirit &#63; and whither shall I 
flee from thy face&#63; If I ascend to heaven&#44; Thou art there&#44; and 
if I should lie down in the deep&#44; I should find Thee. Should 
I fly on the wings of the morning&#8211;dawn&#44; to dwell at the 
farthest end of the sea&#44; even there thy hand would lead me&#44; 
and thy right hand would seize me.&#34; Psalms cxxxix. 7&#8211;10. 

Fourthly. God is omniscient&#59; that is to say&#44; He 

                <pb n="24"/>

24 GOD AND HIS ATTRIBUTES. 

knows every thing which any man does or thinks. 
Nothing is so secret&#44; concealed&#44; or mysterious&#44; but 
the Lord knows it&#44; and the cause thereof. 

&#34; I&#44; the Lord&#44; search the heart&#44; I try the reins&#44; to give to 
every man according to his ways&#44; and according to the fruit of 
his doings. &#34; Jer. xvii. 10. 

&#34; Lord&#44; Thou hast searched&#44; and knowest me. Do I sit&#44; 
do I rise&#44; it is known to Thee &#58; already afar Thou probest my 
thoughts. My walk and my couch Thou hast measured 
for me&#44; and prepared all my ways. Before yet a word was 
upon my tongue&#44; Thou&#44; Lord &#33; didst know all.&#34; Psalms 
cxxxix. 1&#8212;4. 

Fifthly. God is all&#8211;just&#59; that is to say&#44; that nothing 
which is unjust is ever done by Him. He pays no 
attention to the person of any one&#44; He only looks 
upon the deed &#59; He loves the good and hates the 
evil. If&#44; therefore&#44; a poor or foolish man does any 
good action&#44; God will look upon it with equal favour 
as though a rich and wise man had done the same. 
If a wrong act is done by the greatest man&#44; even 
though he be great as Moses and wise as Solomon&#44; 
God will send the punishment which the sin de&#8211; 
serves. And though we may not always be able to 
understand the reason for God&#39;s action upon earth&#44; 
we must reflect that our wisdom is not equal to his 
wisdom &#59; and that&#44; therefore&#44; the doings of the Lord 
are without fault&#44; though our mortal reason is not 
able to understand his motives and the causes of his 
actions. 

&#34; For the Lord&#44; your God&#44; is the God of gods&#44; and the Lord 
of lords &#59; the great&#44; mighty&#44; and terrible God&#44; who hath no 
regard for persons&#44; and receiveth no bribes&#59; who executeth 
justice for the fatherless and the widow&#44; and loveth the 
stranger to give him food and raiment.&#34; Deut. x. 17&#44; 18. 

&#34; He is the Rock&#44; his work is perfect&#59; for all his ways are 
just &#58; the God of truth&#44; without iniquity&#59; just and upright is 
He.&#34; Ibid&#44; xxxii. 4. 

&#34; For Thou art not a God delighting in wickedness&#59; no evil 
shall dwell with Thee.&#34; Psalms v. 4. 

                <pb n="25"/>

GOD AND HIS ATTRIBUTES. 25

Sixthly. God is all&#8211;good&#44; gracious and merciful &#59; 
He loves all his creatures&#44; and provides for all their 
wants. More than we deserve we obtain from hia 
bounty&#59; and when we even transgress his com&#8211; 
mandments He readily forgives us&#44; if we only re&#8211; 
pent of our errors. He repays us not the evil we 
do&#44; but in his mercy overlooks our thoughtless sins&#44; 
and visits with mild punishment our wilful trans&#8211; 
gressions. 

&#34; The Lord passed by before him &#40;Moses&#41; and proclaimed&#44; 
The Lord is the immutable&#44; eternal Being&#44; an omnipotent 
God&#44; merciful and gracious&#44; long&#8211;suffering&#44; and abundant in 
beneficence and truth &#59; keeping mercy even unto the thou&#8211; 
sandth generation&#44; forgiving iniquity&#44; transgression&#44; and sin.&#34; 
Exodus xxxiv. 6&#44; 7. 

&#34; The Lord is gracious&#44; and full of compassion&#44; long&#8211; 
suffering&#44; and of great mercy. The Lord is good to all&#44; and 
his mercies are over all his works. The eyes of all wait on 
Thee&#44; and Thou givest them their food in due season. Thou 
openest thy hand&#44; and satisfiest all beings with beneficence.&#34; 
Psalms cxlv. 8&#44; 9&#44; 15&#44; 16. 

19. Has God any other perfections &#63; 

Yes &#59; and no human thought can think them all&#44; 
no human tongue can repeat them all. God is 
elevated above all our reflections &#59; we see Him in hi3 
works&#44; we recognise him by his goodness &#59; but our 
understanding&#59; cannot reach a knowledge of all hi&#63; 
ways&#44; all his power&#44; all his wisdom&#44; all his goodness. 

&#34;Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord&#44; tell all his 
praise &#63;&#34; Ibid. cvi. 2. 

20. What attribute do you call this great perfection &#63; 
God&#39;s holiness&#58; He is the holiest being&#59; there is 

nothing imperfect in Him&#44; but all is truth&#44; goodness&#44; 
greatness. 

&#34; Holy&#44; holy&#44; holy&#44; is the Lord of Hosts&#44; the whole earth is 
full of his glory.&#34; Isaiah vi. 3. 

&#34; To whom would ye compare me&#44; that I should be like 
him&#63; saith the Holy One.&#34; Ibid. xl. 25.

26 THE RELATION OF MAN TO GOD. 



CHAPTER IV. 

THE RELATION OF MAN TO GOD. 

1. In what relation do we stand to God &#63; 

God is our Father&#44; and we are his children. 

&#34;You are children of the Lord your God.&#34; Deut. xiv. 1. 

&#34; For Thou art our Father &#59; for Abraham knoweth nothing 
of us j Israel recogniseth us not &#59; Thou&#44; Lord &#33; art our 
Father&#59; our Redeemer is from everlasting thy name.&#34; Isaiah 
lxiii. 16. 

&#34; But now&#44; Lord&#33; Thou art our Father&#59; we are the clay&#44; 
Thou art our Former&#44; and we all are the work of thy hand.&#34; 
Ibid. lxiv. 8. 

2. What is accordingly the conduct of God towards us &#63; 

God loves us as a father loves his child&#44; and He 
desires only our welfare. Every created thing on 
earth is for our benefit &#59; the ground is for our labour 
that it may produce bread for our support &#59; the light 
of the sun is to gladden our eyes&#44; and to bring to 
ripeness the labour of our hands &#59; so are also the 
various animals destined to aid man in his work 
and pursuits&#44; or to benefit him in various other 
ways&#44; &#40;if even the method is unknown to him.&#41; or 
they serve him as food&#58; in short&#44; all nature is so 
organized as to sustain&#44; assist&#44; or gladden the heart 
of&#44; the son of man. 

&#34; And God blessed them&#44; and God said unto them&#44; Be fruit&#8211; 
ful and multiply&#44; and fill the earth and subdue it&#59; and have 
dominion over the fish of the sea&#44; and over the fowl of the air&#44; 
and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. And 
God said&#44; Behold&#44; f have given you every herb bearing seed 
which is upon the face of all the earth&#44; and every tree on 
which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed &#59; to you it shall be 
for food.&#34; Genesis i. 28&#44; 29. 

                <pb n="27"/>

THE RELATION OF MAN TO GOD. 27

3. &#34;What is&#44; therefore&#44; required of us &#63; 

That we should repay the love of God with sin&#8211; 
cere love on our part&#44; and return Him our heartfelt 
thanks for his many benefits. For as the child 
ought to love the father from whom he receives his 
daily food&#44; the garments which cover him&#44; and the 
instruction which teaches him the righteous way&#58; 
so ought we to love our heavenly Father and Bene&#8211; 
factor for his innumerable acts of goodness&#44; and 
thank Him daily for the bounties which He so 
graciously bestows on us&#44; although we be unworthy 
of his favour. 

&#34;He giveth food to all flesh&#59; for his mercy endureth for 
ever. &#33; give thanks unto the God of heaven &#59; for his mercy 
endureth for ever.&#34; Psalms cxxxvi. 25&#44; 26. 

4. In what manner can we display our love to God&#63; 

By using the gifts which He has given us for the 
best purposes. To hold whatever we possess as 
liable to be at all times taken back&#44; when He in his 
wisdom may see fit to take it away from us. To 
devote our possessions to acts of benevolence towards 
other human beings&#44; who are&#44; like ourselves&#44; chil&#8211; 
dren of the same great Father. 

&#34; For all things come from Thee&#44; and of thy own have we 
given Thee.&#34; 1 Chronicles xxix. 14. 

5. How can we thank God&#63; 

By impressing on our mind the great goodness 
which we receive from the Supreme Being. 

&#34;Bless the Lord&#44; my soul &#33; and all that is within me bless 
his holy name. Bless the Lord&#44; O my soul &#33; and forget not 
any of his benefits.&#34; Psalms ciii. 1&#44; 2. 

6. How should we express by outward conduct this inward 
gratitude&#63; 

By prayer. 

&#34;A Psalm of Thanksgiving. &#8212; Shout unto the Lord&#44; all 
inhabitants of the earth. Serve the Lord with gladness&#44; 
&#59;onie into his presence with a song. Know yc that the Lord

is God alone j it is He who hath made us&#44; and His we are &#8212; 
1 is people and the sheep of his pasture. Enter ye his gates 
with thanksgiving&#44; and his courts with praise &#59; be thankful 
unto Him&#44; and bless his name. For good is the Lord&#59; his 
mercy is everlasting&#44; and his truth endureth to all genera&#8211; 
tions&#47;&#39; Ps. c. 

7. What is prayer &#63; 

The raisin £r of our thoughts to God&#44; and the 
expressing of the feelings of our hearts in words 
addressed to our Maker. That is to say&#44; when we 
see how many benefits we receive from the Lord&#44; 
and discover how great is his power&#44; we should re&#8211; 
flect and think that to Him&#44; therefore&#44; is our grati&#8211; 
tude due &#59; and we should say to Him&#44; by words of 
our mouth&#44; that we sincerely feel that we are so in&#8211; 
debted&#44; and that it is not through our own exertions&#44; 
bat through his blessing&#44; that we enjoy the good we 
have received. 

&#34; But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God &#59; for it is He 
who giveth thee power to get wealth.&#34; Deut. viii. 18. 

&#34; Lord &#33; open thou my lips&#44; and my mouth shall declare 
thy praise.&#34; Ps. li. 15. 

&#34; Trust in him at all times&#44; ye people &#33; pour out your 
heart before Him &#58; God is a refuge for us.&#34; Ibid. lxii. 9. 

8. But is prayer intended only for the purpose of returning 
thanks&#63; 

Xo &#59; we should also pray when we are in trouble&#63; 
and danger&#44; in which case we should express before 
God the things we stand in need of&#44; in the hope that 
He may grant us what we ask of Him&#59; also&#44; when 
we have sinned &#58; when&#44; feeling the unworthiness of 
our conduct&#44; and the ingratitude with which we have 
offended our great Benefactor&#44; we should express our 
regret to God&#44; and ask of Him to forgive us&#44; because 
He is merciful&#44; the sins Ave have committed. 

&#34; But if from there thou wilt seek the Lord thy God&#44; thou 
shalt find Him&#44; if thou seek Him with all thy heart and all 
thy soul.&#34; Deut. iv. 29. 

                <pb n="29"/>

THE RELATION OF MAN TO GOD. 29

&#34; Seek ye the Lord while He may be found&#44; call upon Him 
while He is near. Let the wicked forsake his way&#44; and the 
unrighteous man his thoughts&#59; and let him return unto the 
Lord and He will have mercy on him&#44; and to our God&#44; for He 
will pardon abundantly.&#34; Isa. lv. 6&#44; 7. 

&#34; But iu my distress I called upon the Lord&#44; and cried unto 
my God&#44; and he heard my voice from his temple&#44; and my cry 
came before Him&#44; into his ears.&#34; Ps. xviii. 6. 

&#34; With a loud voice I call unto the Lord&#44; with a loud voice 
I make supplication unto the Lord. I pour out my complaint 
before Him&#44; tell my trouble before Him. I cried unto Thee&#44; 
Lord &#33; I said&#44; Thou art my refuge&#44; my portion in the land 
of life.&#34; Ibid&#44; cxlii. 2&#44; 3&#44; 6. 

9. What effect has prayer upon ourselves &#63; 

It teaches us our dependence on God&#44; and im&#8211; 
presses on us that we are his servants&#44; with whom 
He may act at pleasure &#59; and that consequently He 
may take from us to&#8211;day what he bestowed on us 
yesterday. If we&#44; therefore&#44; pray when we are in 
joy&#44; we will not be too much carried away by our 
prosperity&#44; but be humble before our Maker&#44; who is 
the Author of our happiness. But if we are in 
affliction&#44; the pouring out of our heart will remove 
the load of sorrow and distress which otherwise 
might make our life bitter and unhappy. We say&#44; 
therefore&#44; that prayer is necessary to the nature of 
man. 

&#34;0 give thanks unto the Lord&#44; for He is good&#59; for his 
mercy endureth forever.&#34; Ibid. cvii. 1. 

&#34; In distress I called on the Lord&#44; and the Lord answered 
me with enlargement.&#39; &#39; Ibid&#44; cxviii. 5. 

10. Has prayer any other beneficial effect upon us &#63; 

Prayer makes us cheerful&#44; resigned to God&#44; and 
gives us hope and confidence in his protection and 
assistance. For if we are in sorrow and express our 
pain before God&#44; then it is absolutely necessary that 
we must feel that He has power to assist us &#59; and we 
must consequently be made more cheerful and re&#8211;

signed&#44; knowing that our case is in the hands of 
the Almighty&#44; who can save us if He deems us 
worthy. 

&#34;And Hannah answered and said&#44; No&#44; my Lord&#44; I am a 
woman of a sorrowful spirit&#59; I have drunk neither wine nor 
strong drink&#44; but have poured out my soul before the Lord. 
So the woman went her way&#44; and did eat&#44; and her countenance 
was no more sad.&#34; 1 Sam. i. 15&#8211;18. 

&#34;And I have trusted in thy mercy&#44; my heart shall rejoice 
in thy salvation &#58; I will sing unto the Lord&#44; because He hath 
dealt bountifully with me.&#34; Ps. xiii. 6. 

&#34; I know that Thou canst do every thing&#44; and that no thought 
can be withheld from Thee.&#34; Job xlii. 2. 

11. Does God grant the prayer of man&#44; or&#44; as it is commonly 
called&#44; answer his prayer &#63; 

Yes &#59; when the prayer is offered up in truth and 
sincerity&#44; and in true confidence upon Divine grace 
and assistance&#59; of which we have many examples 
in Scripture. Nevertheless&#44; if our petition be not 
granted&#44; we should not complain of the want of 
mercy&#44; but ascribe it to our own unworthiness&#44; or to 
the probable fact&#44; that what we asked might have 
been injurious to ourselves or others if it had been 
granted. 

&#34; The Lord is near unto all those who call upon Him&#44; to all 
who call upon Him in truth. He will fulfil the desire of 
those who fear Him &#59; He will also hear their cry and save 
them.&#34; Ps. cxlv. 18&#44; 19. 

12. What do you mean by saying&#44; &#34; To call upon God in 
truth&#63;&#34; 

It is our duty to be earnest and sincere in oui 
prayers &#59; to feel at heart what we utter with our lips&#44; 
and to do carefully whatever we promise during tht&#42; 
moments of devotion. 

&#34; That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and 
perform&#44; even a free&#8211;will offering&#44; according as thou hast vowed 
unto the Lord thy God&#44; which thou hast promised with thy 
mouth.&#34; Deut. xxiii. 23. 

                <pb n="31"/>

THE RELATION OF MAN TO GOD. 31

13. Do Scriptures speak against praying &#8211;without devotion&#44; or 
without repentance&#63; And what is said of sincerity&#63; 

Of deceitful prayer we read &#58; 

&#34; And when ye spread forth your hands&#44; I will hide my eyes 
from you &#58; yea&#44; when ye multiply prayer&#44; I will not hear&#44; your 
hands are full of blood.&#39; &#42; Isa. i. 15. 

&#34;And they remembered that God was their Rock&#44; and the 
most high God their Redeemer &#59; nevertheless&#44; they did natter 
Him with their mouth&#44; and with their tongue they lied unto 
Him. When God heard this He was wroth&#44; and greatly ab&#8211; 
horred Israel.&#34; Ps. lxxviii. 35&#44; 36&#44; 59. 

But of a sincere prayer it is said &#58; 

&#34; The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit &#59; a broken and 
contrite heart&#44; God &#33; Thou wilt not despise.&#34; Ibid. li. 19. 

14. What is the object of prayer&#63; 

It is chiefly intended&#44; since God needs not to be 
told of our wants&#44; that we may be sanctified by our 
approaching&#44; as it were&#44; nearer to God when we are 
praying&#44; than we are at those times when we are en&#8211; 
gaged in pursuits of pleasure or profit. 

&#34; Sanctify ye a fast&#44; call a solemn assembly&#44; gather the 
&#39; elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of 
the Lord your God&#44; and cry unto the Lord.&#34; Joel i. 14. 

&#34; Therefore&#44; thus will I do unto thee&#44; Israel j and because 
I will do this unto thee&#44; prepare to meet thy God&#44; Israel.&#39;&#39; 
Amos v. 12. 

15. What do you understand by &#34; That we may be sancti&#8211; 
fied&#63;&#34; 

By this I understand that we should endeavour to 
become like God&#44; who is the most perfect and holiest 
of beings &#59; that is to say&#44; we ought to be&#44; as near as 
possible for human nature&#44; like Him in his qualities 
of mercy and goodness. 

&#34;And you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a 

holy nation.&#34; Exod. xix. 6. 

&#34;And God spoke unto Moses&#44; saying&#44; Speak unto the 

congregation of the children of Israel and say unto them&#44;

32 THE RELATION OF MAN TO GOD. 

You shall be holy&#44; for I&#44; the Lord your God&#44; am holy.&#34; Lev. 
xix. 1&#44; 2. 

16. Is it possible for man to be like God&#63; 

Already&#44; from the nature of his soul&#44; man is like 
his Creator &#59; for&#44; to use the language of Scripture&#44; 
&#34;God created man after his own linage.&#34; 

&#34; And God created man after his own image &#59; in the image 
cf God created He him&#44; male and female created He them.&#34; 
Gen. i. 27. 

17. What do you mean by the &#34; image of God &#63;&#34; 

By these words I do not mean to say that the body 
of man has any similarity to God &#59; for the blessed 
One has no corporeal figure&#44; no outline of body&#44; to 
which we could liken any thing &#59; He being a pure 
spirit&#44; not subject to measure of space and time&#44; like 
ourselves. But God imparted to the body of man a 
living principle&#44; a part of his own spirit&#44; which 
living principle we call soul&#44; and this is the image 
of God. 

&#34;And the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground&#44; 
and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life&#44; and man be&#8211; 
came an animated being.&#34; Ibid. ii. 7. 

18. In what light then is man to be regarded &#63; 

By the possession of the soul man is endowed 
with power&#44; wisdom&#44; and goodness&#44; and these quali&#8211; 
ties make him the image of his Creator. 

&#34; And Thou madest him but little less than angels&#44; and 
didst crown him with honour and glory&#59; Thou gavest him 
dominion over the works of thy hands&#44; and didst place all be&#8211; 
neath his feet.&#34; Ps. viii. 6&#44; 7. 

19. In what consists the power of man &#63; 

The power of man consists chiefly in his having 
freedom of will to do good or evil&#44; and next&#44; in doing 
whatever is agreeable&#44; and to avoid what is disagree&#8211; 
able to his inclinations and feelings. 

&#34; Behold&#44; I lay before thee this day life and the good&#59; also&#44; 
death and the evil.&#34; Deut. xxx. 15.

THE RELATION OF MAN TO GOD. 33

20. In what consists the wisdom of man &#63; 

In the possession of reason&#44; by which he is enabled 
to distinguish the true from the false&#44; and the good 
from the evil. 

&#34; For God knoweth&#44; that on the day ye eat thereof&#44; your 
eyes will be opened&#44; and you will be as angels&#44; knowing good 
and evil.&#34; Gen. iii. 5. 

21. In what consists the goodness of man&#63; 

Man has a consciousness to understand and to 
value&#44; and a will to desire and to exercise the good&#44; 
and to dislike and avoid the evil. 

&#34; I call heaven and earth to witness this day against you &#58; 
I have set before you life and death&#44; blessing and the curse &#59; 
but do thou choose life&#44; that both thou and thy seed may 
live.&#34; Deut. xxx. 19. 

22. You understand then by the &#34;image of God&#34; a state of 
goodness and intelligence&#58; what do you call a man who acts in 
accordance with these qualities &#63; 

I call him innocent and perfect. Innocent&#44; be&#8211; 
cause he then must be free from guilt &#59; and perfect&#44; 
because he is just as his Creator intended he should 
be. 

&#34;And when Abram was ninety&#8211;nine years old&#44; the Lord 
appeared to Abram&#44; and said unto him&#44; I am the Almighty 
God &#58; walk before me and be perfect.&#34; Gen. xvii. 1. 

23. Did man always maintain his innocence&#44; or the image of 
God&#44; as you call it&#63; 

No &#59; he lost his state of purity and innocence by 
voluntary transgression and disobedience. 

24. What is the present state of man &#63; 

Man is in a state of sin &#59; and we may freely say 
that we all are sinners before the Lord. 

&#34; There is no man so righteous on earth&#44; who would do the 
good&#44; and never sin.&#34; Eccles. vii. 20. 

25. How did this state originate&#44; since man was created with 
the great endowments you have mentioned &#63; 

The sinful transgression of the parents of the hu&#8211; 

                <pb n="34"/>

34 THE RELATION OF MAN TO GOD. 

man race&#44; or the fall of Adam&#44; as it is called&#44; caused 
a state of sin to be the portion of all mankind&#44; the 
descendants of the first parents. 

&#34; Thy first father sinned&#44; and they that plead for thee have 
transgressed against me.&#34; Isa. xliii. 27. 

&#34; Is one clean among the unclean &#63; not one.&#34; Job xiv. 4. 

26. What is the present state of man in consequence of the fall 
of Adam &#63; 

He is from his earliest infancy inclined to do the 
evil&#44; and disinclined to do the good. 

&#34; For the desire of the heart of man is evil from his youth.&#34; 
Gen. viii. 21. 

&#34; Lo &#33; I was shapen in iniquity&#44; and in sin did my mother 
conceive me.&#34; Ps. li. 7. 

27. What is sin &#63; 

Every action and thought which are against the 
will of God&#44; and the commandments which He gave 
us in his law. 

&#34; After the doings of the land of Egypt&#44; wherein ye have 
dwelt&#44; shall ye not do &#59; and after the doings of the land of 
Canaan&#44; whither I bring you&#44; shall ye not do j neither shall 
ye walk in their ordinances. Ye shall do my judgments&#44; and 
keep my ordinances&#44; to walk therein &#58; I am the Lord your 
God.&#34; Lev. xviii. 3&#44; 4. 

&#34; And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart&#44; 
with all thy soul&#44; and with all thy might.&#34; Deut. vi. 5. 

&#34; Thou shalt not do so unto the Lord thy God j for every 
abomination of the Lord&#44; which He hateth&#44; have they done 
unto their gods.&#34; Ibid. xii. 31. 

28. What causes this inclination to sin &#63; 

Man is created of a twofold nature&#44; one intel&#8211; 
lectual&#44; or the soul &#59; the other sensual&#44; or the body. 
Now&#44; as far as the soul&#44; the intelligent spirit&#44; is con&#8211; 
cerned&#44; he feels pleasure and satisfaction in obeying 
the will of God&#44; which is&#44; in other words&#44; doing 
good &#59; but as regards the body&#44; which was&#44; like that 
of other animals&#44; formed out of the dust of the 
earth&#44; and is liable to decay and death&#44; he is subject 

                <pb n="35"/>

THE RELATION OF MAN TO GOD. 35

„o sensual desires&#44; defects&#44; and weakness &#59; or&#44; what 
is the same&#44; he is&#44; because of the formation of Lis 
body&#44; drawn to sin&#44; in disobedience to the will of 
God. 

&#34; For He knoweth our frame &#59; He remembereth that we are 
dust.&#34; Ps. ciii. 14. 

&#34; Remember&#44; I beseech Thee&#44; that Thou hast shaped me 
like clay&#44; and wilt cause me to return unto dust. Behold&#44; 
Thou didst pour me out like milk&#44; and curdle me like cheese&#59; 
clothe me with skin and flesh&#44; and cover me with bones and 
sinews.&#34; Job x. 9&#8211;11. 

29. Can we escape the power of sin &#63; 

&#34;We are constantly and at every point incited to 
sin &#59; but we have the power&#44; and are therefore bound&#44; 
as intelligent creatures of God&#44; to resist the inclina&#8211; 
tion which would mislead us to forsake the law of 
God. 

&#34; The sin will rest at the door &#58; to thee is its desire&#44; but 
thou shalt rule over it.&#34; Gen. iv. 7. 

&#34; For I have kept the ways of the Lord&#44; and have not 
wickedly departed from my God. For all his judgments were 
before me&#59; and from his statutes I did not depart. I was 
also upright before Him&#44; and guarded myself from my ini&#8211; 
quity.&#34; Ps. xviii. 22&#8211;24. 

30. But how can we control this inclination to sin &#63; 

By the fear of God. &#34;We should reflect&#44; as has 
been said in the verses from the 18th Psalm&#44; just 
quoted&#44; that we are accountable to God for whatever 
we do &#59; that He always sees us&#44; and watches our 
conduct&#59; that we cannot hide our doings from Him&#44; 
no matter how secretly we commit wickedness&#59; and 
that&#44; lastly&#44; we cannot escape his punishment&#44; which 
will surely overtake the sinner&#44; if even it be a long 
while delayed. 

&#34; I liave always set the Lord before me&#44; that being at my 
right hand&#44; I might not be moved.&#34; Ps. xvi. 8. 

&#34; Be not wise in thy own eyes&#59; fear the Lord and depart 
from evil.&#34; Prov. in. 7. 

                <pb n="36"/>

36 THE RELATION OF MAN TO GOD. 

31. How do we obtain the fear of God &#63; 

&#34;When we consider how great our Maker is &#59; when 
we seriously reflect how little we can accomplish 
without his assistance&#44; and that we are his creatures&#44; 
with whom He can act at pleasure&#58; we must be 
filled with reverence for his goodness&#44; and with fear 
at the great power He has over us &#59; these feelings 
will next teach us that it is necessary that we should 
endeavour to do nothing to displease Him. In this 
fear there is nothing mean or unworthy of the cha&#8211; 
racter of an intelligent creature &#59; for by it we merely 
acknowledge the supreme power of our Maker&#44; and 
that his wisdom is the origin of our wisdom &#59; we 
submit to One greater and wiser than we are&#44; who 
is only solicitous for our happiness. 

&#34; Out of heaven He caused thee to hear his voice&#44; that He 
might instruct thee j and upon earth He showed thee his great 
fire&#44; and his words thou didst hear out of the midst of the 
fire&#47;&#39; Deut. iv. 36. 

32. What is the fear of God as displayed in our conduct &#63; 
We should fear the Lord our God above all &#59; we 

should regard no danger or worldly inducements&#44; 
when these would mislead us from the laws of God &#59; 
but we should strictly obey his will&#44; and adhere unto 
Him under every difficulty. 

&#34; The Lord thy God thou shalt fear&#44; Him thou shalt serve&#44; 
to Him thou shalt cleave&#44; and by His name thou shalt swear&#47;&#39; 
Ibid. x. 20. 

33. What do you call the fear of God when actively displayed 
in our conduct &#63; 

Virtue&#44; pity&#44; or righteousness. 

&#34; And it will be righteousness unto us&#44; if we observe to do 
all these commandments before the Lord our God&#44; as He hath 
commanded us.&#34; Ibid. vi. 25. 

34. In what consists this feeling&#63; 

By letting our reason have the victory over the 
passions&#44; the spirit over the flesh&#44; and duty over 

                <pb n="37"/>

THE RELATION OF MAN TO GOD. 37

inclination &#59; that is to say&#44; we should not be anxious 
to do what we might resolve on at the impulse of 
passion and hasty resolution &#59; we should submit the 
body&#44; even if it causes pain and inconvenience&#44; to 
our calmer resolution and serious reflection&#44; and to 
place the will of God above every inducement which 
interest&#44; or pleasure&#44; or inconvenience&#44; might hold 
out to us. 

&#34;He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty&#59; and 
he that ruleth his spirit&#44; than he that taketh a city.&#34; Prov. 
xvi. 32. 

35. What is the will of God concerning us&#63; 

We should observe the commandments of God&#44; 
which He gave to us for our own happiness only. 

&#34;And now&#44; Israel&#44; what doth the Lord thy God ask of 
thee &#63; Only to fear the Lord thy God&#44; to walk in his ways&#44; 
and to love Him&#44; and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy 
heart and with all thy soul. To observe the commandments 
of the Lord thy God&#44; and his statutes which I command 
thee this day&#44; that it may be well with thee.&#34; Deut. x. 
12&#44; 13. 

36. You said&#44; The law was given for our happiness &#58; how do 
you understand this &#63; 

The fear of God as displayed in obedience to the 
law is the only thing which enables us to fulfil oui 
destiny&#44; that is to say&#44; to accomplish those duties for 
which we were created&#44; and it is only by fulfilling 
these duties that we can be truly happy. 

&#34;Fear God&#44; and keep his commandments&#44; for this is the 
whole duty of man.&#34; Eccles. xii. 13. 

37. What is this destiny&#63; 

Perfection and similarity to God. 

&#34;Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God.&#34; Deut. 
xviii. 13. 

&#34; When thou observest the commandments of the Lord thy 
God&#44; and walkest in his ways.&#34; Ibid&#44; xxviii. 9 

                <pb n="38"/>

38 THE RELATION OF MAN TO GOD. 

38. How do we obtain similarity to God &#63; 

We ought to acknowledge with the utmost sin&#8211; 
cerity his power and goodness&#44; search into his attri&#8211; 
butes and ways of mercy&#44; and endeavour to act 
according to the example which He hath set us. 

&#34; For the Lord your God is the God of gods&#44; and the Lord 
of lords&#44; the great&#44; mighty and terrible God&#44; who hath no re&#8211; 
gard to persons and receiveth no bribes&#59; who executeth justice 
for the fatherless and the widow&#44; and loveth the stranger to 
give him food and raiment. Love ye then the stranger.&#34; 
Deut. x. 17&#8211;19. 

&#34; In all thy ways acknowledge Him&#44; and He will direct thy 
paths.&#34; Prov. iii. 6. 

39. What do we now learn from the almighty power of God&#44; 
one of his attributes&#63; 

That we should not trust in&#44; nor boast of our own 
strength and power&#44; nor despond when we discover 
our own means to be insufficient for our intended 
actions &#59; nor dare we despair when we are beset with 
difficulties and dangers too great to be overcome by 
our feeble efforts &#59; it is also sinful to fear or to coll&#8211; 
ude in any other being more than the Almighty our 
God&#44; or to put any such being upon an equality 
with Him in our thoughts &#59; for all are like ourselves 
fz..r beneath Him&#44; and equally dependent on his 
power and benevolence. 

11 The Lord is for me&#44; I will not fear&#59; what can man do 
un&#42;o me V Ps. cxviii. 6. 

&#34; Put not your trust in princes&#44; in the son of man in whom 
there is no salvation. His spirit goeth away&#44; he returneth to 
his native earth&#44; in that very day all his thoughts perish. But 
happy is he who hath the God of Jacob for his help&#44; whose 
hope is in the Lord his God.&#34; Ibid&#44; cxlvi. 3&#8211;5. 

40. &#34;What do we learn from the justice of God&#63; 

We should endeavour to be like God&#44; just in our 
dealings and conduct&#59; we should without regard to 
persons love the good and abhor the evil. 

&#34; Thou shalt not pervert judgment &#59; thou shalt not respect 

                <pb n="39"/>

THE RELATION OF MAN TO GOD. 39

persons&#44; neither take a bribe&#59; for a bribe doth blind the eyes 
of the wise&#44; and pervert the words of the righteous. The just&#44; 
the just alone thou shalt pursue&#44; that thou mayest live.&#34; Deut. 
xvi. 19&#44; 20. 

&#34; Thou shalt not have in thy bag different weights&#44; a great 
and a small one. Thou shalt not have in thy house different 
incisures&#44; a great and a small one. But thou shalt have a 
perfect and just weight&#44; a perfect and just measure thou shalt 
have&#44; that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the 
Lord thy God giveth thee. For all who do such things are an 
abomination unto the Lord thy God&#44; all who do unrighteous&#8211; 
ness.&#34; Ibid. xxv. 13&#8211;16. 

41. What do we learn from the goodness of God&#63; 

We shall&#44; like God&#44; act and think with love&#44; affec&#8211; 
tion&#44; and goodness towards all mankind&#59; not hate 
any one who may even injure us&#44; and not think any 
man&#44; however mean and unknown&#44; unworthy of our 
regard and kindness. Does not God let his sun 
shine to all the world &#63; Are not the great and the 
small&#44; the good and the bad&#44; alike fed and sustained 
by his bounty&#63; We ought&#44; therefore&#44; like our great 
Teacher&#44; to act benevolently towards every one as 
far as our means go&#44; without regarding whether he 
be an Israelite or not&#44; whether he be a stranger to us 
or not &#59; nay&#44; even the wicked should be relieved and 
instructed by us &#59; perhaps they may repent and be 
again taught to love God&#44; whom their sins have dis&#8211; 
pleased. 

&#34; If a stranger sojourneth with thee&#44; in your land&#44; you shall 
not oppress him. Like a native born among you shall the 
stranger who sojourneth with you be unto you&#44; and thou shalt 
love him like thyself.&#34; Lev. xix. 33&#44; 34. 

&#34; It has been told thee&#44; man &#33; what is good&#44; and what tho 
Lord asketh of thee &#58; to exercise justice&#44; to love mercy&#44; and 
to walk humbly before thy God.&#34; Micah vi. 8. 

42. What farther do we learn from the gowdness of God&#63; 

Never to despair of God&#39;s mercy&#44; even if we have 
sinned against his commandments. Let no man 

                <pb n="40"/>

40 THE RELATION OF MAN TO GOD. 

say&#44; that he is cast off because he has transgressed &#59; 
or that his sins are too great for forgiveness. For to 
argue in this manner would be to set limits to the 
mercy of God&#44; and to doubt of his goodness&#44; wLieh 
is without end. But if we are conscious that we 
have sinned&#44; we should pray God to forgive us our 
sins &#59; and we should alter our conduct&#44; and endea&#8211; 
vour to merit in future the favour of the Lord by a 
careful observance of the precepts of the Bible. 

&#34; For thus saith the High and Holy One&#44; who inhabitelh 
eternity&#44; and whose name is Holy&#44; The high and holy place I 
inhabit&#44; yet also with the contrite and humble of spirit&#44; to 
revive the spirit of the humble&#44; and to give life to the heart 
of the contrite. For I will not always contend&#44; neither will I 
be wroth for ever &#58; when the spirit from before me is over&#8211; 
whelmed&#44; and the souls which I have made&#47;&#39; Isaiah lvii. 
15&#44; 16. 

&#34; Thou turn est men to contrition&#44; and sayest&#44; Return&#44; ye 
children of man.&#34; Ps. xc. 3. 

43. What do we learn from the grace and mercy of God&#63; 
As God the Lord has compassion over all his 

works&#44; so shall we exercise mercy and kindness 
toward all our fellow&#8211;creatures. 

&#34; He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth j but happy is he 
that hath mercy on the poor&#63;&#34; Prov. xiv. 21. 

&#34; He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord&#59; 
and He will pay him what he hath given.&#34; Ibid. xix. 17. 

44. What do we learn from the eternity and immutability of 
God&#63; 

That&#44; as God never changes his love and provi&#8211; 
dence towards us&#58; so should we persevere in obedi&#8211; 
ence and faith towards Him whilst we live. 

&#34;God is no man that He should deceive&#44; no son of man that 
He should repent&#59; should He say and not do it&#63; promise and 
not fulfil it&#63;&#34; Numb&#44; xxiii. 19. 

&#34; Now these are the commandments&#44; the statutes&#44; and the 
judgments&#44; which the Lord youi God commanded to teach 
you&#44; that you might do them in the land whither ye go to 

                <pb n="41"/>

possess it &#58; that thou mayest fear the Lord thy God&#44; to keep 
all his statutes&#44; and his commandments&#44; which I command 
thee&#44; thou&#44; and thy son&#44; and thy son&#39;s son&#44; all the days of thy 
life.&#34; Deut. vi. 1&#44; 2. 

45. &#34;What do wo learn from the universal knowledge&#44; or omni&#8211; 
icience&#44; as it is called&#44; of God&#63; 

We should do the good&#44; and avoid the evil&#44; and 
abstain from sinning&#44; even if no one be present to see 
us &#59; for the eye of the Lord sees whatever we do. 

&#34; If a man even conceal himself in a secret place&#44; should I 
not see him &#63; saith the Lord &#58; do I not fill the heaven and the 
earth&#63;&#34; Jer. xxiii. 24. 

&#34; The Lord looketh down from heaven&#59; He beholdeth all 
the sons of men. From the place of his residence He super&#8211; 
intcndeth all the inhabitants of the earth. He fashioneth all 
their hearts&#44; and understandeth all their works.&#34; Ps. xxxiii. 
13&#8211;15. 

&#34; For high is the Lord&#44; and regardeth the low&#44; and chas&#8211; 
tiseth afar the exalted.&#34; Ibid&#44; cxxxviii. 6. 

46. What do we learn from the omnipresence of God&#63; &#8212; that is 
to say&#44; what effect should the knowledge we have of the Lord&#39;s 
Deing present everywhere have upon us &#63; 

That God is everywhere present and ready to 
assist us&#44; whenever we call upon Him &#59; but so is the 
sinner likewise everywhere under the observance 
and cognizance of God&#59; and&#44; consequently&#44; he can 
do nothing which can escape the knowledge and the 
visitation of his Maker. 

&#34; In every place where I will permit my name to be men&#8211; 
tioned I will come to thee&#44; and I will bless thee.&#34; Exod. 
xx. 21. 

li There is no darkness&#44; no shadow of death&#44; where the 
workers of iniquity can hide themselves.&#34; Job xxxiv. 22. 

47. What else do we learn from the omnipresence of God&#63; 
Not to rely upon any mediator to pray for us&#44; or 

to make an atonement for our sins before God. 
But whenever we pray&#44; we should speak directly to 

                <pb n="42"/>

42 THE RELATION OF MAN TO GOD. 

Him&#44; who is always near to hear us&#44; and who exists 
to all eternity &#59; and if we have sinned there is no 
being but God alone&#44; who in his mercy can or will 
remove our transgression&#44; in case we repent and 
alter our conduct. 

&#34; For what nation is there so great&#44; that hath God so nigh 
unto them&#44; as the Lord our God is&#44; whenever we call on 
Him &#63;&#34; Deut. iv. 7. 

&#34; You are my witnesses&#44; saith the Lord&#44; and my servants 
whom I have chosen&#44; that ye may know and believe me&#44; and 
understand that I am He &#59; before me no god was formed&#44; and 
after me there shall be none. I&#44; I am the everlasting One&#59; 
and beside me there is no saviour.&#34; Isaiah xliii. 10&#44; 11. 

48. What do we learn from the supreme wisdom of God &#63; 

That we cannot search out nor fully understand 
the ways of God &#59; we should therefore confide in the 
Lord&#44; and unhesitatingly place our entire trust in 
Him&#44; that He will do every thing wisely and for a 
good end. 

&#34; Commit thy way unto the Lord&#44; trust also in Him&#44; and 
He will bring it to pass.&#34; Ps. xxxvii. 5. 

&#34; Trust in the Lord with all thy heart&#44; and depend not upon 
thy own wisdom. Be not wise in thy own eyes &#58; fear the 
Lord&#44; and depart from evil.&#34; Prov. iii. 5&#8211;7. 

49. What else do we learn from the wisdom of God &#63; 

That whatever the Lord has commanded is just and 
true&#44; even if we cannot discover the reason for its 
being so ordained &#59; and that the wisdom of man is 
of no value&#44; if it is not founded upon the fear and 
love of God. 

&#34;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom&#59; and 
good success attendeth all who keep his commandments &#59; his 
praise also endureth for ever.&#34; Ps. cxi. 10. 

&#34; Open Thou my eyes&#44; that I may behold the wonders of 
thy law.&#34; Ibid. cxix. 18. 

&#34; And He said to man&#44; Behold &#33; to fear the Lord is wisdom&#44; 
and to eschew evil is understanding.&#34; Job xxviii. &#63;8.

THE LAW REVEALED THROUGH MOSES. 43

50. What does Holy Writ teach with regard to the difference 
between the wisdom of God and that which He has given to 
man&#63; 

That man can only look to the outside of things&#44; 
but that the Giver of wisdom understands every 
thing which is said&#44; done&#44; or even thought of. 

&#34;The secret things belong unto the Lord our God&#59; but 
tl ose things which are revealed belong unto us&#44; and to our 
children for ever&#44; that we may do all the words of this law.&#34; 
Deut. xxix. 28. 

&#34; But the Lord said unto Samuel&#44; Look not on his counte&#8211; 
nance&#44; or the height of his stature&#44; because I have refused 
him&#59; for the Lord seeth not as man seeth j for the man looketh 
on the outward appearance&#44; but the Lord looketh at the 
heart.&#34; 1 Sam. xvi. 7. 

51. You said &#34;That we may do all the words of this law&#59;&#34; 
which law is here spoken of&#63; 

The law which God made known unto us through 
Moses and the prophets&#44; whom He selected to make 
his will known to the children of man. 



CHAPTER V. 

THE LAW REVEALED THROUGH MOSES. 

1. What is the second article of the Jewish Faith&#63; 

I believe firmly and truly that the Lord God did 
reveal himself to the whole people of Israel on 
Mount Sinai&#44; and there made known the Ten Com&#8211; 
mandments &#59; I believe also that the Lord God taught 
his servant Moses the whole law&#44; which was after&#8211; 
wards delivered to us just as he had been taught it&#59; 
and I farther believe that Moses&#44; and&#44; after him&#44; the 
other prophets&#44; were true and faithful messengers of

God&#44; and that they spoke the truth as it was an&#8211; 
nounced to them. 

&#34; And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you 
statutes and judgments&#44; that you might do them.&#34; Deut. 
iv. 14. 

&#34;A prophet from the midst of thee&#44; of thy brethren&#44; like 
unto me&#44; will the Lord thy God raise up unto thee &#58; unto him 
shall ye hearken.&#34; Ibid&#44; xviii. 15. 

&#34; Remember ye the law of Moses my servant&#44; to whom I 
commanded at Horeb statutes and judgments for all Israel.&#34; 
Mai. iii. 22. 

2. What do you understand by the words &#34; revealed law &#63;&#34; 
All the books of the Scriptures&#44; in number twenty&#8211; 
four&#44; which we call the covenant of the Lord with 
Israel&#44; through Moses and the prophets. These 
books are first&#44; Genesis&#44; Exodus&#44; Leviticus&#44; Num&#8211; 
bers&#44; and Deuteronomy&#44; called the five books of 
Moses&#44; or the law &#59; Joshua&#44; Judges&#44; first book of 
Samuel&#44; second book of Samuel&#44; first book of Kings&#44; 
and second book of Kings&#44; in all six&#44; called the 
older prophets&#59; Isaiah&#44; Jeremiah&#44; Ezekiel&#44; and the 
twelve minor prophets &#40;namely&#44; Hosea&#44; Joel&#44; Amos&#44; 
Obadiah&#44; Jonah&#44; Micah&#44; JSTahum&#44; Habakkuk&#44; Ze&#8211; 
phaniah&#44; Haggai&#44; Zechariah&#44; and Malachi&#41;&#44; in all 
four books&#44; called the later prophets &#59; and lastly&#44; 
the books of Psalms&#44; Proverbs&#44; Job&#44; the five Polls 
&#40;namely&#44; the Song of Solomon&#44; the books of Puth&#44; 
Lamentations&#44; Ecclesiastes&#44; and Esther&#41;&#44; Daniel&#44; 
Ezra&#44; Nehemiah&#44; the first book of Chronicles&#44; and 
the second book of Chronicles&#44; in all nine&#44; called the 
hagiographa&#44; or holy writings. We have&#44; therefore&#44; 
five books of Moses&#44; also called the Pentateuch&#44; six 
of older prophets&#44; four of later prophets&#44; and nine 
of the holy writings&#44; in all twenty&#8211;four. 

&#34; These are the words of the covenant&#44; which the Lord 
commanded to make with the children of Israel in the land 
of Moab&#44; beside the covenant which He made with them in 
Horeb.&#34; Deut. xxix. 69.

3 What would you understand by &#34; the whole law of Moses &#63;&#34; 

By the law of Moses I would be understood as 
meaning all the written ordinances and command&#8211; 
ments&#44; which were written down by Moses himself&#44; 
and the oral traditions wmich he left to the Israelites 
by word of mouth. 

&#34; And the Lord said unto Moses&#44; Come up to me into the 
mount&#44; and be there&#59; and I will give thee the tables of stone&#44; 
and the law and commandments which I have written to teach 
unto them.&#34; Exod. xxiv. 12. 

4. What is the written law&#63; 

The live books of Moses&#44; wmich Moses wrote by 
the command of God. 

&#34;And Moses wrote this law&#44; and delivered it unto the 
priests&#44; the sons of Levi&#44; who bore the ark of the covenant 
of the Lord&#44; and unto all the elders of Israel.&#34; Deut. 
xxxi. 9. 

5. What is the oral law &#63; 

The interpretations of the written laws&#44; which 
were delivered by Moses&#44; by word of mouth&#44; to the 
Israelites of his time&#44; and which were so continued 
from generation to generation&#44; till at length they 
were written down in the Mishnah and Gemarah. 
This oral law consists of the particular explanations 
of the written law&#44; and contains the directions of 
the manner in which the ordinances of Scripture are 
to be observed. It is chiefly by this tradition also 
that we are acquainted with the doctrines of the 
Bible&#44; and the extent of the things permitted and 
prohibited&#44; wmich are laid down in the Scriptures 
merely in a general manner. 

6. Do the Mishnah and Gemarah contain no other matter be&#8211; 
side the traditions &#63; 

Yes &#59; they contain the opinions of certain learned 
men&#44; together with arguments&#44; drawn from the 
Scriptures for their opinions&#44; on disputed matters 
which w T ere brought before them for their decision &#59; 

                <pb n="46"/>

46 THE LAW REVEALED THROUGH MOSES. 

and these decisions&#44; so supported by Bible&#8211;authority&#44; 
are binding upon Israelites&#44; since the doubtful mat&#8211; 
ters were left to the decision of the people to whom 
the law was given. For so we read&#58; 

&#34; If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment&#44; 
between blood and blood&#44; between plea and plea&#44; between 
stroke and stroke &#59; being matters of controversy within thy 
gates &#58; then shalt thou arise&#44; and go up to the place which 
the Lord thy God will choose&#59; and thou shalt come unto the 
priests the Levites&#44; and unto the judge who shall be in those 
days&#44; and inquire&#44; and they shall tell thee the sentence of 
judgment. According to the sentence of the law which they 
will teach thee&#44; and according to the judgment which they 
will say unto thee&#44; shalt thou do&#59; thou shalt not decline from 
the sentence which they will tell thee to the right or to the 
left.&#34; Deut. xvii. 8&#8211;11. 

7. What are the contents of the Mosaic law &#63; 

First&#44; The moral law. 
Secondly&#44; The ceremonial law. 
Thirdly&#44; The political law&#59; and 
Fourthly&#44; The church law. 

8. What is the moral law &#63; 

Commandments and prohibitions which our re&#8211; 
ligion lays upon us as members of the human family&#44; 
dependent&#44; as other men are&#44; upon the bounty of 
God &#59; and the observance of which is founded even 
upon human reason&#44; and is necessary towards pro&#8211; 
moting the peace and happiness of mankind at 
large. They are called in the Bible Mitzvote or com&#8211; 
mandments. 

&#34;And ye shall remember all the commandments of the 
Lord&#44; and do them&#59; and that ye seek not after the inclinations 
of your heart and the delight of your eyes&#44; in pursuit of which 
ye have been led astray. That ye may remember and do all 
my commandments&#44; and be holy unto your God&#47;&#39; Numb 
xv. 39&#44; 40. 

9. What is the foundation of the moral law &#63; 

It is founded upon the fact of its being necessary 

                <pb n="47"/>

THE LAW REVEALED THROUGH MOSES. 47

to the protection and preservation of the human 
family &#59; and it is by its exercise chiefly that man ap&#8211; 
pears truly as the creature made in the image of 
God. &#34;We may state&#44; therefore&#44; that the moral pre&#8211; 
cepts contained in the Mosaic Law are based upon 
the divine nature inherent in the soul of man. 

&#34;For this commandment which I command thee this day is 
not hidden from thee&#44; nor is it far oif. It is not in heaven&#44; 
that thou shouldst say&#44; Who shall go up for us to heaven&#44; 
and bring it to us&#44; and cause us to hear it&#44; that we may do it&#63; 
Nor is it beyond the sea&#44; that thou shouldst say&#44; Who shall 
go over the sea for us&#44; and bring it unto us&#44; and cause us to 
hear it&#44; that we may do it&#63; But the word is very nigh unto 
thee&#44; in thy mouth and in thy heart&#44; that thou mayest do it.&#34; 
Deut. xxx. 11&#8212;14. 

&#34; He that keepeth the commandment&#44; guardeth his own 
soul&#59; but he that despiseth his ways shall die.&#34; Prov. 
xix. 16. 

10. What is the ceremonial law&#63; 

Such laws and enactments which the Mosaic Re&#8211; 
ligion demands of us Israelites only &#59; we alone of all 
mankind being those who profess to follow and to 
be bound by this law. These enactments are called 
Chuckim or statutes. 

&#34; Behold I have taught you statutes and judgments&#44; as the 
Lord my God commanded me&#44; that you should do so in the 
land&#44; whither ye go to possess it. Keep them and do them &#59; 
for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight 
of the nations&#44; who shall hear all these statutes&#44; and they will 
say&#44; Surely this great nation is a wise and intelligent people.&#34; 
Deut. iv. 5&#44; 6. 

11. On what is the ceremonial law founded&#63; 

It is based upon the peculiar relation of our fore&#8211; 
fathers and of us&#44; the people of Israel&#44; their descend&#8211; 
ants&#44; towards God. 

&#34;And thou shalt remember that thou hast been a bondman 
in Egypt &#58; therefore&#44; shalt thou observe and do these statutes &#34; 
Deut. xvi. 12. 

                <pb n="48"/>

48 THE LAW REVEALED THROUGH MOSES. 

12. Please to explain more fully some of these peculiar rela&#8211; 
tions. 

&#34;When Abraham in his time acknowledged alone&#44; 
in the presence of idolaters&#44; the Lord who made 
heaven and earth&#44; God promised him&#44; as was said 
above&#44; that He would protect him and his descend&#8211; 
ants&#44; and be peculiarly their God. And as a sign of 
the existence of this covenant or promise&#44; the Lord 
demanded the covenant of circumcision from Abra&#8211; 
ham and his descendants. As we also read &#58; 

&#34; And my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting 
covenant.&#34; Gen. xvii. 13. 

13. Correctly stated&#58; so this covenant was to be the sign of 
the descendants of Abraham being in a peculiar relation to God&#44; 
to distinguish them&#44; one and all&#44; from the heathen multitude. 
But as this is not the only enactment&#44; be kind enough to give me 
a few more&#44; together with such reasons as you may discover. 

After the death of Abraham&#44; besides the children 
of Isaac&#44; other nations also adopted this sign of the 
covenant&#44; in memory of their descent from or con&#8211; 
nexion with the great patriarch &#59; thus do the children 
of Ishmael&#44; even to this day &#59; and&#44; as some aver&#44; the 
people of ancient Egypt were likewise so distin&#8211; 
guished. But it was the will of the Lord to erect 
those children of Abraham&#44; descended from him by 
Isaac and Jacob&#44; into a people devoted to his service &#58; 
He therefore gave them other laws to mark the new 
relation which this people should maintain before all 
the world. And so we read &#58; 

&#34; But you did the Lord take&#44; and he brought you forth out 
of the iron furnace&#44; out of Egypt&#44; to be unto Him a people of 
inheritance&#44; as ye are this day.&#34; Deut. iv. 20. 

&#34; For thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God&#59; of 
thee the Lord thy God made choice to be to Him a special 
people&#44; of all the nations that are upon the face of the earth. 
Not because you were the most in number of all nations did the 
Lord desire and choose you &#59; for you are the fewest of all nations. 
But because of the love of the Lord for you&#44; and because He 
would keep the oath which He swore to your forefathers&#44; hath 

                <pb n="49"/>

THE LAW REVEALED THROUGH MOSES. 49

the Lord brought you out with a strong hand&#44; and redeemed 
thee from the house of bondage&#44; from the power of Pharaoh&#44; 
the king of Egypt.&#34; Deut. vii. 6&#8211;8. 

14. This is the view I would take myself of the subject&#44; and 
the texts which you have quoted prove the view to be correct&#58; 
continue now to give me a few more particulars. 

In order to effect this separation&#44; or division of 
one people from the rest of the world&#44; it was neces&#8211; 
sary to divide them from other men by such laws as 
w r ould prevent the mixing up of the handful of Israel&#8211; 
ites with the multitudes of the other nations. God&#44; 
therefore&#44; instituted the ordinance of forbidden meats 
and drinks&#59; so that his chosen servants should not&#44; 
by too close and too intimate an intercourse with 
the heathens and other non&#8211;Israelites&#44; become like 
those who are strangers to his service&#44; forgetting that 
they are bound to regard Him as their Deliverer and 
Saviour. 

&#34; For I am the Lord your God&#44; ye shall therefore sanctify 
3&#39;ourselves&#44; and ye shall be holy&#44; for I am holy&#59; nor shall you 
defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that 
creepeth upon the earth. For I am the Lord your God that 
bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt to be your God &#58; ye 
shall therefore be holy&#44; for I am holy.&#34; Lev. xi. 44&#44; 45. 

&#34; They who eat swine&#39;s flesh&#44; and the abomination&#44; and the 
mouse&#44; shall be consumed together&#44; saith the Lord.&#39;&#39; Isaiah 
lxvi. 17. 

&#34; They joined themselves also unto Baal&#8211;Peor&#44; and ate of 
the sacrifices of the dead.&#34; Ps. cvi. 28. 

&#34; But Daniel purposed in his heart&#44; that he would not defile 
himself with the portion of the king&#39;s meat&#44; nor with the wine 
which he drank.&#34; Daniel i. 8. 

1&#34;&#41;. These quotations fully prove that certain meats were not 
forbidden without a good reason. How is it in regard to the 
festivals&#63; 

When the Israelites dwelt in Egypt&#44; they were 
compelled by the king and people of that country to 
do all sorts of hand&#8211;labour without receiving any 
pay for their work &#59; or&#44; as it is called&#44; they were re&#8211; 

                <pb n="50"/>

duced to a state of slavery or bondage. ISTow it hap&#8211; 
pened&#44; that God&#44; mindful of his promise to Abra&#8211; 
ham&#44; sent Moses to the king of Egypt&#44; called the 
Pharaoh&#44; to demand of him the freedom of the 
Israelites&#44; that they might go and worship God the 
Lord in the wilderness&#44; in the manner He might be 
pleased to direct. 

&#34; And thou shalt come&#44; thou and the elders of Israel&#44; unto 
the king of Egypt&#44; and ye shall say unto him&#44; The Lord the 
Grod of the Hebrews hath made himself known to us &#59; and now 
let us go&#44; we pray thee&#44; three days&#39; journey into the wilderness&#44; 
that we may sacrifice unto the Lord our God.&#34; Exod. iii. 18. 

16. Did Pharaoh obey the will of God &#63; 

No &#59; on the contrary&#44; he refused to acknowledge 
the power of God&#44; and scornfully disobeyed the com&#8211; 
mand conveyed to him by the great prophet. Where&#8211; 
upon&#44; the Almighty caused many wonderful things 
to happen in Egypt&#44; and sent such severe punish&#8211; 
ments upon the king and people of Egypt&#44; that they 
at length gladly consented to send the Israelites 
away. 

&#34; And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people&#44; in order 
to send them out of the land in haste j for they said&#44; We shall 
be all dead men&#47;&#39; Ibid. xii. 33. 

17. But what has this history to do with the festivals&#63; 

It is the foundation of all the festivals of the Lord&#44; 
which He gave unto us. For&#44; that w T e might re&#8211; 
member all the days of our life the wonderful man&#8211; 
ner in which we were relieved from this Egyptian 
slavery&#44; He commanded us to celebrate every year 
the feast of Passover&#44; at the season in which our 
forefathers went forth from Egypt. 

&#34;And this day shall be unto you for a memorial&#44; and you 
shall keep it as a feast unto the Lord&#44; throughout your genera&#8211; 
tions &#59; as an everlasting statute ye shall keep it.&#34; lb. xii. 14. 

&#34; Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread&#44; and on the 
seventh day shall be a feast unto the Lord. Unleavened bread 

                <pb n="51"/>

THE LAW REVEALED THROUGH MOSES. 51

shall be eaten these seven days&#44; and there shall no leavened 
bread be seen with thee&#44; neither shall there be any leaven seen 
with thee in all thy quarters. And thou shalt tell thy son on 
that day&#44; saying&#44; This is done because of that which the Lord 
did unto me&#44; when I came forth out of Egypt. And it shall 
be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand&#44; and fur a memorial be&#8211; 
tween thy eyes &#59; that the Lord&#39;s law may be in thy mouth&#59; for 
with a strong hand hath the Lord brought thee out of Egypt. 
Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season&#44; from 
year to year.&#34; Exod. xiii. 6&#8212;10. 

18. Can you state any thing with reference to the Pentecost&#63; 

After the Israelites had been redeemed from 
Egypt&#44; God resolved that they should he taught to 
serve Him&#44; whom they had found to be so power&#8211; 
ful and good. He therefore brought them to the 
wilderness of Sinai&#44; and there proclaimed before 
the whole people the Ten Commandments. This 
took place on the fiftieth day from their going out 
of Egypt &#59; and this was therefore fixed as a festival 
forever. 

&#34;And ye shall proclaim on the self&#8211;same day&#44; that it may 
be a holy convocation unto you &#59; ye shall do no servile work 
thereon &#59; it shall be a statute forever in all your dwellings&#44; 
throughout your generations.&#34; Lev. xxiii. 21. 

&#34;Only take heed to thyself and keep thy soul diligently&#44; 
that thou forget not the things which thy eyes have seen &#8212; the 
day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb.&#34; 
Deut. iv. 9&#44; 10. 

19. Give now briefly the reason for the feast of Tabernacles. 
When the Israelites had received the law in so 

wonderful a manner from the mouth of God himself&#44; 
it would have been reasonable to expect that they 
should have been sincere worshippers&#44; and fully con&#8211; 
vinced of the truth of God&#39;s ordinances. But it was 
not so&#59; they sinned often and grievously&#59; till at 
length it was decreed that all the males over twenty 
years old&#44; who had left Egypt&#44; should die in the 
wilderness of Arabia. To effect this&#44; and not to

leave the children unprotected&#44; and the youths with&#8211; 
out guides&#44; God would not destroy them all in one 
pestilence &#59; but He caused them to travel about from 
place to place&#44; for a space of thirty&#8211;eight years&#44; till 
all the persons&#44; doomed to death&#44; had died by 
degrees. 

&#34; And the space in which we came from Kadesh Barnea&#44; 
until we came over the brook Zared&#44; was thirty&#8211;eight years &#59; 
until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out 
from the midst of the camp&#44; as the Lord had sworn unto 
them.&#34; Deut. ii. 14. 

20. Continue your account&#44; and show its application to the 
festival. 

During all these travels in a land where there is 
no water even to drink&#44; the people wanted for no&#8211; 
thing &#59; bread was given them in the shape of manna&#44; 
which was found every day round their camp &#59; water 
flowed unto them out of the hard rock&#59; their gar&#8211; 
ments grew not old&#44; nor did their shoes w T ear off 
from their feet &#59; and&#44; more than all&#44; God&#39;s pillar of 
cloud was a shield over them by day&#44; and the pillar 
of fire lighted their camp and guided their tivvels 
by night. Throughout this time the whole people 
dwelt in tents or booths&#44; and entered not into a city 
of houses&#44; or in a land where there can be sow ng 
and reaping. In this manner&#44; though the punish&#8211; 
ment of God lay heavily on them&#44; still his pi otecti m 
and goodness were doubly displayed &#59; and tl us were 
the young men educated under the immcclisi &#44; guid&#8211; 
ance of God&#44; whilst their parents were left to watch 
over them&#44; although not permitted to enter ih em&#8211; 
selves into the land of Canaan for their nanifold 
sins. 

&#34;Ye shall dwell in booths seven days&#59; all that lto Israel&#8211; 
ites born shall dwell in booths. That your generai&#39;vns may 
know&#44; that I caused the Israelites to dwell in booths&#44; when I 
brought them out of the land of Egypt &#58; I am the Lord your 
God.&#34; Lev. xxiii. 42&#44; 43. 

                <pb n="53"/>

THE LAW REVEALED THROUGH MOSES. 53

21. So then&#44; I understand from your account&#44; that the three 
festivals had all a close reference to the history of the Israelites&#44; 
and their education as a people devoted to the service of God. 
Were there any other observances connected with them&#63; 

Yes &#59; on the Passover we were commanded to eat 
a lamb roasted in a particular manner on the first 
evening 1 of the feast&#44; together with bitter herbs and 
unleavened bread &#59; at the same time we were bound 
to speak of&#44; and tell to those younger and not know&#8211; 
ing&#44; the wonderful manner in which God delivered 
us from Egypt. Since at present we have no longer 
the sacrifice of the paschal lamb&#44; &#40;as sacrifices belong 
to the temple&#8211;service only&#44;&#41; we celebrate this event 
on the first two evenings of the Passover by eating 
the unleavened bread and bitter herbs&#44; and drinking 
the cup of grace amidst psalms&#44; and reading the 
account of the redemption from Egypt. This we 
call Heading the Ilaggadah. 

&#34;And it shall be&#44; when thy son asketh thee&#44; in time to 
come&#44; saying&#44; &#34;What is this &#63; that thou shalt say unto him&#44; 
By strength of hand the Lord brought us forth from Egypt. &#34; 
Exod. xiii. 14. 

22. Proceed. 

These ordinances&#44; which in themselves may per&#8211; 
hnps have no meaning to one not acquainted with 
our laws and history&#44; are nevertheless full of mean&#8211; 
ing&#44; and wisely adapted to the object for which they 
were instituted. They are peculiar ordinances&#44; such 
as no human wisdom would have invented &#59; they 
are enactments from God as a special gift to the 
people whom He had chosen. The other ceremonies 
relating to the Omer&#44; or a measure of barley to be 
brought to the temple as the commencement of the 
harvest&#44; as also the two wheaten loaves to be brought 
on the Pentecost&#44; cannot now be observed any 
more &#59; because we have no longer a temple or a 
priesthood&#44; as was the case formerly&#44; since our dis&#8211; 
persion and expulsion from Palestine have deprived 

                <pb n="54"/>

54 THE LAW REVEALED THROUGH MOSES. 

us of the same &#59; nevertheless&#44; when these ceremonies 
were observed&#44; they were to show that we devoted 
to God&#44; the Giver of all&#44; the first of all fruits which 
He was pleased to give to us. 

&#34; Speak unto the children of Israel&#44; and say unto them&#44; 
When ye have come into the land which I give unto you&#44; 
and shall reap the harvest thereof&#44; ye shall bring an omer&#8211;full 
of the first fruit of your harvest unto the priest.&#34; Leviticus 
xxiii. 10. 

&#34; You shall bring from your habitations two wave&#8211;loaves&#44; 
of two tenth parts&#59;&#42; they shall be of fine flour&#59; they shall be 
baked leaven&#59; they are the first fruits unto the Lord.&#34; lb. 17. 

23. Correctly stated. 

The feast of Tabernacles was also distinguished 
by the presentation of the fruits of the earth unto 
the Lord. As the Passover and Pentecost were the 
commencement of the barley and wheat&#8211;harvest in 
Palestine&#44; so was the Tabernacles feast the close of all 
field&#8211;labour. Then every thing must be taken home 
on account of the approach of winter. The fruits 
of the tree are then ripe &#59; the green leaves must soon 
turn yellow&#44; and fall off&#59; and plants as well as the 
soil must rest during the cold&#44; to get new strength 
for the coming spring. At this period&#44; therefore&#44; 
the citron&#44; the fairest of fruits&#44; the branch of that 
blessing of Palestine and Arabia&#44; the palm&#8211;tree&#44; 
the hardy evergreen myrtle&#44; the robust yet easily&#8211; 
withering willow&#44; were all united in one bunch&#44; to 
be waved in the presence of the Lord&#44; who made 
every thing so w r ell adapted for the service of man. 
In this offering are likewise joined the great and 
lowly&#44; the fragrant and the inodorous&#44; the useful and 
ornamental&#44; in one bond&#44; consecrated to the service 
of the Maker of all&#44; lie before whom all his crea&#8211; 
tures are alike. 

&#34; And ye shall take unto you&#44; on the first day&#44; the fruit of 

&#42; Two omer&#8211;fulls.

the tree hadar&#44; branches of palm&#8211;trees&#44; and the boughs of the 
myrtle&#8211;tree&#44; and willows of the brook&#59; and ye shall rejoice 
before the Lord your God seven days.&#34; Lev. xxiii. 40. 

24. How about the New Year &#63; 

The day when the Lord created his world should 
be made holy to his service &#59; then we should resolve 
to devote ourselves anew to worship Him in sin&#8211; 
cerity&#44; and proclaim the Holy One as King of all 
the earth. We therefore assemble in our places of 
worship and blow the cornet in memory of God&#39;s 
perpetual and universal kingdom over all that is. 

&#34; God ascendeth amidst the shout&#44; the Lord amidst the voice 
of the cornet. Sing praises to God&#44; sing praises&#59; sing praises 
to our King&#44; sing &#34;praises &#33; For God is King over all the 
earth &#59; sing the song of instruction. God is King over the 
heathen &#59; God sitteth on his holy throne.&#34; Ps. xlvii. 6&#8211;9. 

25. There is one more festival&#44; the Day of Atonement &#59; what 
does this mean &#63; 

Led away by the desires of the human heart&#44; we 
are constantly induced to forget the God who has 
made us&#59; we sin&#44; as it were&#44; by habit&#44; and one 
wrong causes another to be done. The Lord there&#8211; 
fore ordained&#44; that one day at least in the year 
should be entirely devoted to reflection and repent&#8211; 
ance &#59; that each man should then examine his heart&#44; 
and refrain thereon from all earthly enjoyments. 
Not that God has need of our fasting&#44; or that our 
suffering w T ould give Him pleasure&#59; but that we 
should fast and afflict ourselves&#44; in order that we 
may be healed of our transgressions&#44; and become 
worthy to be servants of the Most High&#44; and holy 
unto our God. 

&#34;Also on the tenth day of this seventh month&#44; there shall 
be a day of atonement&#59; it shall be a holy convocation unto 
you&#59; and ye shall fast&#44; and offer an offering made by fire 
unto the Lord. And ye shall do no work on that same day&#44; 
for it is a day of atonement&#44; to make an atonement for you 
before the Lord your God.&#8212; It shall be a statute for eve&#42;

56 THE LAW REVEALED THROUGH MOSES. 

throughout your generations&#44; in all your dwellings.&#34; Lev. 
xxiii. 27&#44; 28&#8211;31. 

26. &#34;We will not trouble you any more at present with giving 
explanations of the other ceremonies relating to the festivals&#44; 
as we wish to leave them for a future occasion &#59; but tell me in 
one word the foundation of all our ceremonies and particular 
prohibitions. 

The whole of our ceremonies were calculated and 
given for the purpose of separating Israel from all 
nations and preserving them as a distinct people. 
It was therefore made unlawful for an Israelite to 
marry a non&#8211;Israelite &#59; as by such connexions we 
might be induced to forsake the faith of God and 
join ourselves to the erroneous beliefs of others. 
So also were we prohibited marking our bodies&#44; or 
pulling out the hair for the dead&#44; as was the custom 
of heathens &#59; or&#44; ploughing the field&#44; or working in 
general with divers sorts of cattle &#59; or sowing differ&#8211; 
ent kinds of seed in the same field&#44; which&#44; as some 
supposed&#44; would increase the products of the earth. 
So also all systems of fortune&#8211;telling&#44; divinations&#44; 
omens&#44; belief in lucky or unlucky days&#59; in fore&#8211; 
bodings&#44; watching of clouds&#44; the flight or birds&#44; or 
similar acts of superstition or false belief&#44; practised 
by heathens or superstitious persons &#59; as all such 
acts would withdraw us from God&#44; and induce us to 
rely upon falsehood and vanity for support. In the 
same manner the ceremonial commandments for 
certain acts to be done were given as an exercise of 
devotion and attachment to God&#44; which Israelites 
should display&#44; they being the people consecrated to 
his service. 

&#34; Neither shalt thou make marriages with them &#58; thy daugh&#8211; 
ter thou shalt not give unto his son&#44; and his daughter thou 
shalt not take unto thy son.&#34; Deut. vii. 3. 

&#34; Ye are the children of the Lord your God &#59; ye shall not 
cut yourselves&#44; nor make any baldness between your eyes for 
the dead. For thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God. 
and the Lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto 

                <pb n="57"/>

THE LAW REVEALED THROUGH MOSES. 57

himself&#44; above all nations that are upon the face of the earth&#47;&#39; 
Deut. xiv. 1&#44; 2. 

&#34; There shall not be found among you any one that maketh 
his son or his daughter to pass through the fire&#44; or that 
useth divinations&#44; or is an observer of times&#44; or an enchanter&#44; 
or a wizard&#44; or a charmer&#44; or a consulter with a familiar 
spirit&#44; or a conjurer&#44; or one that asketh of the dead. For al&#41; 
that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord.&#34; Ibid&#44; 
xviii. 10&#8211;12. 

&#34; Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds &#59; lest&#44; 
the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown&#44; and the fruit of 
the vineyard&#44; be defiled. Thou shalt not plough with an ox 
and an ass together. Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers 
sorts&#44; of woollen and linen together&#47;&#39;&#39; Ibid. xxii. 9&#8211;11. 

27. What would you say with regard to such enactments for 
which no particular reason can be given&#44; such as the ceremonies 
belonging to the sacrifices&#63; 

That they are ordinances proceeding from the 
Supreme Wisdom&#44; therefore they must be wise and 
useful&#44; even if our reason be not able to discover the 
cause for their being given. They are obligatory on 
us as followers of the law&#44; and as exercises of a sin&#8211; 
cere faith towards the Author of our holy religion. 
The law brings life&#44; and in the faithful performance 
of its enactments&#44; and in a perfect conviction of 
their wisdom and usefulness alone&#44; can we be de&#8211; 
serving of the favour and mercy of God. Thus we 
read of the priestly garments&#44; about which so many 
particular directions are given &#58; 

&#34;And they shall be upon Aaron and upon his sons&#44; when 
they come in unto the tabernacle of the assembly&#44; or when 
they come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place&#44; 
that they bear not iniquity&#44; and die. It shall be a statute 
for ever unto him&#44; and for his seed after him&#47;&#39; Exod. xxviii. 43. 

So also of the ordinance of forbidden marriages &#58; 

&#34; Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments &#59; 
which&#44; if a man do&#44; he shall live in them &#58; I am the Lord&#47;&#39; 
Lev. xviii. 5. 

                <pb n="58"/>

58 THE LAW REVEALED THROUGH MOSES. 

28. Your views are quite satisfactory&#44; I should judge&#59; and 
consequently&#44; seeing how holy the reasons are upon which the 
ceremonial law is founded&#44; we should be extremely cautious to 
pay due respect to the commandments&#44; which&#44; if strictly observed&#44; 
will purify the heart&#44; and cause us to adhere to our God. But it 
is time that we proceed to other subjects.&#42; 

Can you tell me now what is the political law&#63; 

Those laws and ordinances which bound our fore&#8211; 
fathers as citizens and members of the Israelitish 
state &#58; they are called Miskpahtim or judgments. 

&#34; These are the statutes and judgments&#44; which ye shall ob&#8211; 
serve to do&#44; in the land which the Lord the God of thy fathers 
giveth thee to possess&#44; all the days that ye live upon the 
earth.&#34; Deut. xii. 1. 

29. Which are some of the political ordinances&#63; 

The law of the tax of a half shekel to be given 
for the temple&#8211;service &#40;Exod. xxx. 11&#8211;16&#41; &#58; the laws 
relative to domestic servants and slaves &#40;Exod. xxi. 
1 &#59; Lev. xxv. 10&#44; &#38;c.&#41; &#59; the laws of war &#40;Deut. xx.&#41;&#44; 
and many of like character. 

30. Upon what principle is the political law of God founded&#63; 

All the laws of God in this respect have for their 
object the maintenance of each person&#39;s rights and 
possessions&#44; and to enforce the great law of 

&#34;And thou shalt love thy neighbour like thyself.&#34; Lev. 
xix. 18. 

31. What is the church law&#63; 

Those enactments which had reference to the 
public service of the Lord in the tabernacle in the 
wilderness&#44; in the first instance&#44; and afterwards in 
the great temple at Jerusalem. They are called 
loroth or laws. 

&#34;And thou shalt say unto them&#44; Whatsoever man of the 
house of Israel&#44; or any of the strangers who sojourneth among 



&#42; If thought too difficult&#44; the explanation of the ceremonies &#40;from Par. 
10 to 28&#41; might with advantage be left out&#44; till a second reading of thia 
work. It is inserted as a guide&#44; more than a complete exposition. 

                <pb n="59"/>

them&#44; that offereth a burnt&#8211;offering or a sacrifice&#44; and bringeth 
it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation&#44; to 
offer it unto the Lord&#44; that man shall be cut off from among 
his people.&#34; Lev. xvii. 8&#44; 9. 

&#34; Take heed to thyself&#44; that thou offer not thy burnt&#8211;offerings 
in every place that thou seest. But in the place which the 
Lord will choose in one of thy tribes&#44; there shalt thou bring 
thy burnt&#8211;offerings&#44; and there shalt thou do all that I command 
thee.&#34; Deut. xn. 13&#44; 14. 

32. Name some of these church laws. 

The laws of sacrifices &#40;Lev. i.&#8211;vii.&#41;&#59; of priests and 
Levites and their services at the temple &#40;Lev. xvi. &#59; 
Num. i. 48&#8211;53&#44; &#38;c&#41;&#59; the tithes &#40;Num. xviii. 8&#8211;32&#44; 
&#38;c&#41;&#59; the three annual pilgrimages to Jerusalem 
&#40;Ex. xxxiv. 23&#41;&#44; and many others of the same kind. 

33. On what is the church law founded &#63; 

On the wisdom of God&#44; who himself chose to 
ordain the manner in which He delighted to be 
served. As followers of his law&#44; we are bound to 
possess a simplicity of faith&#44; and an entire reliance 
upon his unerring wisdom&#44; if we really desire to de&#8211; 
vote ourselves to his service &#59; and it is only for such 
faith and for service of this kind that He promises 
to bless and protect us. So too we read &#58; 

&#34;And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel&#44; 
and I will bless them.&#34; Numb. vi. 27. 

34. What is the reason that we observe not now the two kinds 
of enactments&#44; called judgments and laws&#63; 

Because we form no longer an independent state&#44; 
governed exclusively by the law of God&#44; and on 
account of the loss of the temple&#44; where all the chief 
commandments relative to the public divine service 
were to be executed. But all those not immediately 
referring to the temple&#44; such as the priestly blessing 
by the descendants of Aaron&#44; the service of the 
Levites as attendants on the Cohanim&#44; and a few 
others&#44; are to be observed even to this day upon all 
proper occasions. 

                <pb n="60"/>

60 THE LAW REVEALED THROUGH MOSES. 

35. But tell me&#44; are these laws abolished&#44; because they are not 
now obeyed &#63; 

By no means &#59; the law is in every respect un&#8211; 
changed and in full force&#44; and is consequently bind&#8211; 
ing on every Israelite&#44;&#8211; who should do whatever lies 
in his power. But the enforcement of the judicial 
and church laws is suspended&#44; only for want of the 
means on our part to execute them&#58; still we hope 
that the time will come&#44; when&#44; by a restoration of 
the Jewish state&#44; both these institutions will again 
be made the law of the land&#44; as heretofore in the 
times of David and Solomon. For so we are taught 
in Scripture &#58; 

&#34;And they shall teach my people to decide between the 
holy and profane&#44; and inform them to distinguish between the 
unclean and clean&#59; and in controversy they shall stand to 
judgment&#44; and they shall decide according to my judgments&#59; 
and my laws and my statutes for all my festivals they shall 
keep&#44; and they shall hallow my sabbaths. &#34; Ezek. xliv. 23&#44; 24. 

&#34; Then shall the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem be 
pleasant unto the Lord&#44; as in the days of old&#44; and as in former 
years.&#34; Mai. iii. 4. 

36. Which parts of the law are now practicable&#63; 

The moral and ceremonial parts &#59; and both are 
equally beneficial in their consequences &#59; for by the 
first we are taught to do justice and exercise kind&#8211; 
ness towards men&#44; thus imitating in a feeble manner 
our heavenly Father &#59; and by the other&#44; we are daily 
brought nearer to sanctity&#44; and the love of God&#44; and 
devotion to his will. 

37. What are the consequences of obedience &#63; What of dis&#8211; 
obedience&#63; 

Obedience will bring happiness to ourselves&#44; as 
well as to others &#59; but if we disobey the laws of God&#44; 
we expose ourselves to his displeasure&#44; and we will 
surely receive such punishment as our bad conduct 
deserves. In a word&#44; obedience will make us happy 
here and render us permanently blessed hereafter &#59; 

                <pb n="61"/>

THE MORAL LAW. 61 

but disobedience will deprive us of peace here&#44; and 
of the blessing of God when we are dead. 

&#34; Behold &#33; I set before you this day a blessing and a curse. 
A blessing&#44; if ye obey the commandments of the Lord your 
God&#44; which I command you this day&#59; and a curse&#44; if ye will 
not obey the commandments of the Lord your God&#44; but turn 
aside out of the way which I command you this day.&#34; Deut&#44; 

xi. 26&#8211;28. &#59;...&#44;. 

&#34; For the commandment is a lamp&#44; and the law is the light&#44; 
and the reproofs of instruction are the way of life.&#34; Prov 
vi. 23. 



CHAPTER VI. 

THE MORAL LAW. 



1. What does the moral law teach&#63; 
It teaches us our duty. 

2. What is this duty&#63; 

We must do whatever God demands of us. 

3. What obliges us to do this&#63; 

By the possession of the life given by God we are 
from motives of gratitude compelled to obey his 
wishes&#59; and by the benefits which He daily and 
hourly bestows on us&#44; we should be induced to show 
that we are not unworthy of his fatherly care &#59; and 
lastly&#44; as children of the covenant with the Lord&#44; it 
is reasonable that we should repay his especial kind&#8211; 
ness by a more ardent display of activity in the ful&#8211; 
filment of our duties. 

4. Towards whom have we duties to perform &#63; 

a. Towards God&#44; through whose favour we live. 

b. Towards our fellow&#8211;men&#44; who&#44; as well as our&#8211; 
selves&#44; have received life and being from God. 

c. Towards ourselves&#44; both as regards our body 
and our soul. 

                <pb n="62"/>

62 THE MORAL LAW. 

5. Can you as a religious person do one part of these duties 
whilst you neglect the others &#63; 

No &#59; because they are connected one with the 
other&#44; and are all founded upon the bond which 
unites us to the Lord our God. 

6. What is this bond &#63; 

The love to God. 

7. How do you explain this &#63; 

First. We shall love the Lord God above all&#44; even 
more than ourselves. 

Secondly. We shall love God in his creature&#44; our 
neighbour. 

Thirdly. We shall love God in ourselves&#44; since we 
also are the work of his hands. 

8. What are the words of the principal commandment which 
enjoins the love to God &#63; 

&#34; Hear&#44; Israel&#44; the Lord our God&#44; the Lord is one. And 
thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart&#44; with all 
thy soul&#44; and with all thy might.&#34; Heut. vi. 4&#44; 5. 

9. How are we to love God with all our heart&#63; 

We should prize his favour and bounty as our 
highest good&#44; and direct to Him alone all our 
washes &#59; never desire any thing which He has for&#8211; 
bidden to us&#44; and lastly&#44; fear Him in sincerity&#44; and 
devote our life to his service. 

&#34;The Lord thy God thou shalt fear&#44; Him thou shalt serve&#44; 
to Him thou shalt adhere&#44; and by his name thou shalt swear.&#34; 
Ibid. x. 20. 

10. How are we to love God with all our soul &#63; 

We should direct all our thoughts to the Lord&#44; 
and place always our God&#44; his holy w T ill&#44; his law&#44; 
his goodness and his providence before our eyes. 
Farthermore&#44; we should never transgress his will&#44; if 
even harm should come to us for obedience &#59; but we 
should reflect that He is our Creator&#44; and He is 
therefore justified in demanding of us an implicit 

                <pb n="63"/>

THE MORAL LAW. 63 



obedience&#44; even if the life which He has given 
should thereby be taken from us. 

&#34;And these words which I command thee this day shall bo 
upon thy heart. And thou shalt teach them diligently untc 
thy children&#44; and shalt speak of them&#44; when thou sittest in 
thy house&#44; when thou walkest by the way&#44; when thou liest 
down&#44; and when thou risest up.&#34; Deut. vi. 6&#44; 7. 

&#34; I have always set the Lord before me&#44; that being at my 
right hand&#44; I might not be moved.&#34; Ps. xvi. 8. 

&#34; Yea&#44; though I walk through the valley of the shadow of 
death&#44; I will not fear evil&#59; for Thou art with me&#59; thy rod and 
thy staff&#44; they comfort me.&#34; Ibid&#44; xxiii. 4. 

11. How are we to love God with all our might&#63; 

We should direct all our power and energy of mind 
to honour the Lord God with our conduct through&#8211; 
out life&#44; and to devote every thing which we have to 
serve Him &#59; since He is the Giver of all the good we 
enjoy&#44; as w r ell as the Author of our being. 

&#34; This day the Lord thy God commandeth thee to do these 
statutes and judgments&#59; and thou shalt keep and do them with 
all thy heart and with all thy soul.&#34; Deut. xxvi. 16. 

&#34; And the people answered and said &#58; &#8212; For the Lord our 
God it is that brought us and our fathers out of the land of 
Egypt from the house of bondage&#44; and who did these great 
signs in our sight&#44; and preserved us on all the way whereon we 
went&#44; and among all the people through whom we passed&#59; &#8212; 
therefore will we also serve the Lord&#44; for He is our God.&#34; 
Josh. xxiv. 16&#8211;18. 

12. Be kind enough to tell me in a few words what you under&#8211; 
stand by the words &#34; serving the Lord&#63;&#34; 

We serve the Lord when we stand in fear of of&#8211; 
fending Him&#44; and are engaged in pious works when&#8211; 
ever we have an opportunty of doing them. 

13. What is the chief commandment of those relating to our 
conduct towards our fellow&#8211;men &#63; 

&#34;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself&#34; &#40;Lev. 
xix. 18&#41;&#59; what. you. do. not. others should 
do to you&#44; do a unto&#47;others . &#39; If before acting&#44; 

                <pb n="64"/>

64 THE MORAL LAW. 

reflect that your conduct might give pain or offence 
to another&#44; you should on no account do as you in&#8211; 
tended &#59; for you would feel grieved if others were to 
treat you in a similar way. 

14. Is this all&#63; 

No &#59; we should not alone abstain from injuring 
others&#44; hut we ought also to endeavour to serve 
them. For instance&#44; if I see a poor man asking for 
bread&#44; or a garment to put on&#44; and I have the power 
to grant what he asks&#44; it is my duty to assist him &#59; 
for I should reflect that I may at one time stand 
also in need of the assistance of others &#59; and surely 
I would be sorely grieved were I then to be refused 
the favour which my distress might compel me to 
ask of others. 

15. Are there any more particulars in these duties &#63; 

Yes &#59; we should never show pride towards those 
who are not so rich as we are &#59; for we ourselves 
would not like to be treated with contempt by those 
richer than ourselves. It is sinful to be overbearing 
to our fellow&#8211;men because of our greater power and 
wisdom &#59; for we would ourselves be very unwilling 
to receive such treatment from others. Likewise&#44; it 
is ridiculous to look upon beauty of the body as a 
particular claim to distinction &#59; but most sinful it is 
to mock others for personal defects&#44; such as blind&#8211; 
ness&#44; lameness&#44; deafness&#44; stammering&#44; or similar 
misfortunes &#59; for w T e should consider that all the ad&#8211; 
vantages w r e have are gifts of God&#44; and the disad&#8211; 
vantages of others afflictions sent by Him. 

1G. What is the duty therefore of superiors towards these less 
than themselves &#63; 

Those entrusted with power over their fellow&#8211; 
beings&#44; such as rulers of states&#44; judges&#44; magistrates&#44; 
military commanders&#44; superintendents and teachers&#44; 
ought&#44; as servants of God&#44; to use their power with 
mildness &#59; nor&#58; should .they Jever stare&#58; to. make those 

                <pb n="65"/>

THE MORAL LAW. 65 



under their control feel the weight of the mastery 
which they have over them&#58; so that the governed 
may ohey their superiors from duty and affection 
more than from interest and fear. 

17. What should be our conduct towards persons in our do&#8211; 
mestic employ&#44; and servants in general &#63; 

It is our duty to behave mildly and affectionately 
to those who are engaged to work for us &#59; never to 
make their task heavier than occasion and absolute 
necessity require &#59; to speak to them in a polite and 
conciliatory manner&#44; but never in the insolent tone 
which the proud and presumptuous make use of. 
We should reflect&#44; that though they are subject to 
our control&#44; from the force of circumstances&#44; such as 
slaves&#44; or from their own free choice&#44; such as domes&#8211; 
tics who work for hire&#44; or because we can make bet&#8211; 
ter use of their labour than they themselves could 
do&#44; such as apprentices and journeymen mechanics 
and labourers&#58; still they&#44; as well as ourselves&#44; are 
creatures of the same God&#44; and&#44; as such&#44; objects of 
his care and bounty no less than ourselves. 

18. How should we act towards the poor&#63; 

When we see a poor person&#44; or are notified that 
a fellow&#8211;being is suffering for want of the necessaries 
and comforts of life&#44; and we have the means to help 
him &#58; we should not feel an indifference towards his 
sufferings&#44; but it is our duty to give freely according 
to the blessing of the Lord which He has given us 
to our brother in distress. We should consider&#44; that 
we only then deserve the blessing of God&#44; when we 
are willing to bless others. 

19. Is it enough merely to give &#63; 

No &#59; when we give&#44; we should give cheerfully&#44; but 
not do it as though we were parting with something 
great and of importance to us. We should not make 
the poor feel his poverty&#44; nor humble him&#44; because 
he is compelled to ask us for assistance. We should 

                <pb n="66"/>

66 THE MORAL LAW. 

consider&#44; that God&#39;s bounty to us is freely given &#59; 
He gives us food before we want it &#59; and He grants 
us bis favour&#44; though our conduct does never deserve 
his mercy. 

20. What should be the conduct of inferiors to their supe&#8211; 
riors &#63; 

Those who from their station in life are under the 
power of others&#44; should endeavour by all proper 
means to gain their favour &#59; they ougb fc to be re&#8211; 
spectful&#44; obedient&#44; and ready to do at all times the 
reasonable duties which are demanded of them &#59; not 
to give sharp answers&#44; even when harshly spoken to &#59; 
so that they may overcome the anger of their supe&#8211; 
riors more by humility and becoming i ubmission&#44; 
than by insisting upon their supposed rights&#44; and 
not irritate them more by hasty and impertinent re&#8211; 
plies&#44; and useless bandying of words &#59; and lastly&#44; to 
execute the trusts reposed in them with fidelity and 
strict honour&#44; as though the work and the advantage 
thereof&#44; w T ere entirely their own. 

21. How should scholars behave to their teachen T 

Scholars&#44; such as those who have the fear of God 
in their hearts&#44; ought to treat their teachers with the 
utmost possible respect &#59; they ought to get well the 
lessons that are given them to study &#59; they ought 
to be early at school&#44; and have their clothes always 
clean and tidy &#59; they ought to sit quietly and still 
during school hours&#44; and listen with the strictest at&#8211; 
tention to whatever is taught them &#59; if the teachers 
reprove them&#44; they should not look sullen or angry&#44; 
much less give an impertinent answer&#59; when the 
teachers have to use punishment&#44; the should sub&#8211; 
mit with becoming patience&#59; when the teachers in&#8211; 
quire about any transaction&#44; they should answer 
according to the strictest truth&#44; and never excuse 
themselves by falsehood or prevarication&#44; which is a 
concealment of the truth&#59; and lastly&#44; no scholar 

                <pb n="67"/>

THE MORAL LAW. 67 

should ever get angry or displeased&#44; if the teachers 
reward a deserving fellow&#8211;scholar &#59; for such reward 
should stimulate the others to excel likewise&#44; but 
should be no cause for envy and bitter feeling. 

22. What should our conduct be to equals&#63; 

We are bound to meet all persons with becoming 
politeness&#59; to greet them upon meeting&#44; and to 
return their salutation &#59; to be decorous in our de&#8211; 
portment when in society&#44; and to do nothing there 
which could offend any one present&#44; either by bois&#8211; 
terous mirth&#44; or by unpleasant allusions to the faults 
of our companions or their friends. Neither are we 
permitted to make ourselves ridiculous by boasting 
of our own merits&#44; or to give offence by a behaviour 
which would seem to indicate that we thought our&#8211; 
selves better than our neighbours. Thus also teach 
our wise men &#58; 

&#34; Whosoever has the good will of men&#44; has the good will 
of his Maker &#59; but whosoever fails to please his fellow&#8211;crea&#8211; 
tures&#44; cannot be pleasing to God.&#34; Abothe iii. 

23. Now tell me&#44; in a few words&#44; how we are to act towards 
others &#63; 

We should be kind and considerate towards infe&#8211; 
riors &#59; obedient and respectful to superiors&#44; parents&#44; 
and teachers&#44; and polite and decorous to our equals 
in society&#58; in short&#44; humility is the virtue which we 
ought to display in our intercourse with others. 

24. How are we then to love God in our neighbour &#63; 

We should honour in our neighbour the image of 
God&#44; and look upon him as our equal and brother&#44; 
though he maybe subject to our control for the pre&#8211; 
sent&#59; for the time will come&#44; when death will render 
us all equal again&#44; and when we all must appear in 
judgment before the Lord our God. It is therefore 
that we ought to practise brotherly love and kind&#8211; 
ness towards all the children of the Lord&#39;s creation. 

&#34; Have we not all one Father &#63; Hath not one God created

68 THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 

us&#63; Why do we deal treacherously every mau against his 
brother&#44; to profane the covenant of our fathers V Mai. ii. 10. 

25. What are our duties towards ourselves&#63; 

We are bound to value highly the life which God 
has given us &#59; we are not at liberty to expose our 
health&#44; or life uselessly&#44; so as to show a disregard of 
God&#39;s favour&#44; displayed in giving us existence &#59; and 
if we wish to be obedient to the will of the law&#44; we 
must make the best use of our time and the intellect 
we have received&#44; and endeavour to acquire all the 
knowledge which is accessible to us &#59; so that we may 
become intelligent and religious&#44; and better calcu&#8211; 
lated to promote the general interest of all mankind&#44; 
and to glorify God in our persons. 

26. How then can we love God in ourselves &#63; 

We should endeavour to honour the image and 
likeness of God in ourselves&#44; and to preserve it pure 
and unstained &#59; that is to say&#44; we should always try 
to keep our soul&#44; the true image of God&#44; unstained 
and free from the effects of sin&#44; and preserve it holy 
and worthy to enter again the presence of the Lord 
when our life on earth is ended. 

&#34;And you shall sanctify yourselves and be holy&#59; for I am 
the Lord your God.&#34; Lev. xx. 7. 



CHAPTER VII. 

THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 

1. What are the Ten Commandments&#63; 

Those celebrated commandments which God the 
Lord communicated himself to the people of Israel 
on Mount Sinai&#44; without the intervention of a pro&#8211; 
phet &#59; which means that the people heard them from 

                <pb n="69"/>

THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 69 

God himself&#44; and not from Moses&#44; who received the 
other laws first from the Lord&#44; and afterwards told 
them to the people. 

&#34; And the Lord spoke with you out of the midst of the fire &#59; 
you heard the voice of words&#44; but ye saw no similitude&#44; only 
ye heard a voice. And He declared unto you his covenant&#44; 
which He commanded you to perform&#44; the Ten Command&#8211; 
ments&#44; and He wrote them upon two tables of stone.&#34; Deut. 
iv. 12&#44; 13. 

2. In what light would you regard these Ten Commandments &#63; 
The Ten Commandments are the everlasting 

fundamental principles of the divine law&#44; and are to 
be observed during all times&#44; and throughout every 
generation. We may call them the Divine Constitu&#8211; 
tion&#44; according to which the other statutes have been 
enacted &#59; and every other commandment has refer&#8211; 
ence to one or the other of them&#44; whether it regards 
the worship of the Lord&#44; or our intercourse with 
other men. 

&#34; The Lord our God made with us a covenant on Horeb. 
Not with our forefathers made the Lord this covenant&#44; but 
with ourselves&#44; who are here all alive this day. Face to face 
the Lord spoke with you on the mount&#44; from the midst of the 
fire. I stood between the Lord and you at that time&#44; to tell 
unto you the word of the Lord&#44; for ye were afraid of the fire&#44; 
and ye ascended not the mount.&#34; Ibid. v. 2&#8211;5. 

3. Why do you believe this &#63; 

Because the Ten Commandments are the testi&#8211; 
mony of the Lord&#44; always true&#44; and just throughout 
all times. 

&#34; The law of the Lord is perfect&#44; quieting the soul &#59; the 
testimony of the Lord is sure&#44; making the simple wise. The 
statutes of the Lord are right&#44; rejoicing the heart &#59; the com&#8211; 
mandment of the Lord is clear&#44; enlightening the eyes. The 
fear of the Lord is pure&#44; enduring for ever &#59; the judgments of 
the Lord are true&#44; and uniformly just.&#34; Ps. xix. 8&#8211;10. 

4. What are therefore the characteristics of true religion&#63; 

Eeligion&#44; to be true&#44; must be in accordance with 

                <pb n="70"/>

70 THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 

the precepts of the Decalogue&#44; as the Ten Command&#8211; 
ments are usually called&#44; &#40;from two Greek words sig&#8211; 
nifying ten and precepts&#59;&#41; and we may therefore main&#8211; 
tain&#44; tiat any system of belief and action&#44; commonly 
termed religion&#44; which contradicts these precepts&#44; can&#8211; 
not be from God. 

5. Why&#63; 

Bee tuse&#44; inasmuch as God is ever the same&#44; and 
his wo rd being unchangeable&#44; it cannot be supposed 
that B e would give at one time a religion which He 
would destroy or repeal at a future period. It is 
therefore impossible that such a religion&#44; which con&#8211; 
tradi&#40; to the Decalogue in its doctrines&#44; can be from 
God &#59; and as no system of religion can be true&#44; 
unlest it be from the Supreme Source&#44; it follows far&#8211; 
ther&#44; tuat whatever contradicts the Decalogue is false 
or erroneous belief&#44; and consequently we are forbid&#8211; 
den to act in accordance with such a system. 

&#34; Ye shall observe to do therefore as the Lord your God 
hath commanded you &#58; you shall not turn aside to the right or 
to the left. You shall walk entirely in the way&#44; which the 
Lord your God hath commanded you&#44; that ye may live.&#34; 
Deut. v. 29&#44; 30. 

&#34; Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet&#44; 
or unto that dreamer of dreams &#59; for the Lord your God 
proveth you&#44; to know whether you love the Lord your God 
with all. your heart and with all your soul. After the Lord 
your God you shall walk&#44; and Him ye shall fear&#44; and his com&#8211; 
mandments ye shall observe&#44; and his voice ye shall obey&#44; and 
unto Him ye shall cleave.&#34; Ibid. xiii. 4&#44; 5. 

&#34; But the prophet who shall presume to speak a word in my 
name which I have not commanded him to speak&#44; or who shall 
speak in the name of foreign gods &#8212; even that prophet shall 
die.&#34; Ibid&#44; xviii. 20. 

6. What religion does answer to these requisites &#63; 

The Mosaic Religion&#44; as we ourselves profess it. 
It is therefore that system which we should obey&#44; if 
we wish to prove our love and adherence to God. 

                <pb n="71"/>

THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 71 

7. Please to recite the first commandment. 

&#34;I am the Lord thy God&#44; who have brought thee 
out of the land of Egypt&#44; out of the house of slavery.&#34; 

8. What are we commanded in this precept&#63; 

We are commanded to believe in the existence of 
God&#44; the only Creator and the Lord of all &#59; and in 
consequence to love&#44; fear&#44; and honour Him as the 
mightiest and holiest Being&#44; and as our greatest 
Benefactor. 

&#34; Unto thee it was shown&#44; that thou mightest know that 
the Lord He is God&#44; there is none else beside Him. Out of 
heaven He caused thee to hear his voice&#44; that He might in&#8211; 
struct thee&#59; and upon earth He showed thee his great fire&#44; 
and his words thou didst hear from the midst of the fire. And 
because He loved thy fathers&#44; therefore He chose their seed 
after them&#44; and brought thee out in his presence with his 
mighty power out of Egypt. &#8212; Know therefore this day&#44; and 
reflect in thy heart&#44; that the Lord He is God&#44; in heaven 
above and on the earth beneath &#58; there is none else.&#34; Deut 
iv. 35&#8211;39. 

9. Why does the Bible mention the redemption from Egypt as 
the reason fur our faith in God &#63; 

Because the Lord wanted to prove to the Israel&#8211; 
ites&#44; that&#44; since they had seen his power displayed in 
the punishments sent upon the Egyptians&#44; it was 
evident that He was in truth the Creator and Su&#8211; 
preme Ruler&#44; capable of doing whatever He wishes 
to do &#59; since He compelled the king of Egypt to let. 
the Israelites go free by the performance of wonders 
and miracles&#44; such as are beyond the power of man 
to accomplish. So also is it said in Exodus &#58; 

&#34;Therefore say unto the children of Israel&#44; I am the Lord&#44; 
and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the 
Egyptians&#44; and J will save you from their bondage&#44; and I will 
redeem you with an outstretched arm&#44; and with great judg&#8211; 
ments. And I will take you to me for a people&#44; and I will be 
to you a God &#59; and you shall know that I am the Lord your 
God&#44; who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the 
Egyptians&#39;&#39; Exod. vi. 6&#44; 7. 

                <pb n="72"/>

72 THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 

10. What duty did God likewise wish to enforce&#63; 

By reminding the people of the benefits they had 
received&#44; He wanted to teach them gratitude&#44; and to 
impress on their minds&#44; that the only thing which 
they could do to repay all this kindness would he to 
be faithful and obedient to his voice in doing what&#8211; 
ever He might demand of them. 

&#34;And it shall come to pass&#44; when your children shall say 
unto you&#44; What mean you by this service &#63; that ye shall say&#44; 
It is the sacrifice of the Lord&#39;s passover&#44; who passed over the 
houses of the children of Israel in Egypt&#44; when He smote the 
Egyptians&#44; and delivered our houses.&#34; Exod. xii. 26&#44; 27. 

11. What is the second commandment&#63; 

&#34; Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou 
shalt not make unto thyself any graven image&#44; or 
any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above&#44; or 
that is on the earth beneath&#44; or that is in the water 
under the earth. Thou shalt not bow down to them&#44; 
nor serve them.&#34; 

12. What are we commanded in this precept &#63; 

That&#44; since God alone is supreme above all&#44; we 
should honour and worship Him alone &#59; for&#44; though 
He cannot be seen by our eyes nor perceived by our 
other senses&#44; He is still the only one God&#44; who 
watches over us&#44; and directs all our ways. 

&#34; Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves&#44; &#40;for ye saw 
no manner of figure on the day when the Lord spoke unto you 
in Horeb out of the midst of the fire&#44;&#41; that you do not cor&#8211; 
rupt yourselves and make yourselves a graven image&#44; the simi&#8211; 
litude of any figure&#44; the likeness of a male or female.&#34; Deut. 
iv. 15&#44; 16. 

&#34; For Thou art great and performest wonders &#58; Thou art 
God alone. Teach me&#44; Lord &#33; thy ways&#44; let me walk in thy 
truth &#59; cause my heart to devote itself solely to fear thy name &#59; 
that 1 may thank Thee&#44; Lord&#44; my God &#33; with all my heart&#44; 
and honour thy name for evermore.&#34; Ps. lxxxvi. 10&#8211;12. 

13. What is forbidden by this precept&#63; 

We are prohibited to practise all manner of idolatry. 

                <pb n="73"/>

THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 73 

14. What is idolatry &#63; 

Idolatry is when a man believes in the existence 
of any other god besides the Creator&#44; or pays reli&#8211; 
gious adoration to any other being&#44; be this great or 
small&#44; save the Lord our God alone. 

&#34; You shall make yourselves no idols&#44; nor rear yourselves up 
a graven or standing image&#44; neither shall ye set up a carved 
stone in your land to bow down upon it&#59; for I am the Lord 
your God.&#34; Lev. xxvi. 1. 

&#34; And that thou lift not up thy eyes unto heaven&#44; and see 
the suu&#44; and the moon&#44; and the stars &#8212; all the host of heaven 
&#8212; and be misled&#44; and bow down to them&#44; and worship them.&#34; 
Deut. iv. 19. 

15. &#34;What do you understand by &#34;believing&#34; in idols&#63; 

By this I mean to entertain a belief that any being 
whatever has any power independently of God &#59; or 
that such a being could exist without Him&#44; or do any 
thing by which &#34;He could be injured&#44; or which He 
should not have the power to prevent&#44; if He wished 
to do so. For there is nothing&#44; of which we can 
form any idea&#44; which has not its existence given&#44; 
and its power for good or evil limited&#44; by the great 
Creator our God. 

&#34;I am the Lord&#44; and there is none else&#59; there is no God 
beside me &#59; that they may know from the rising of the sun 
and from the west that there is none without me &#59; I am the 
Lord and there is none else &#59; I form the light and create dark&#8211; 
ness &#59; I make peace and create evil &#59; I the Lord do all these 
things.&#34; Isaiah xlv. 5&#8211;7. 

And ao&#59;ain it is said &#58; 

&#34; I have made the earth&#44; and created man upon it &#59; I &#8212; my 

hands have stretched out the heavens&#44; and all their host I 
have commanded&#34; &#40;to exist&#41;. Ibid. xlv. 12. 

16. What is meant by &#34;worshipping&#34; idols&#63; 

To pray to any being save God alone&#44; to ask it 
for assistance in our need&#44; or to offer it presents or 
sacrifices&#44; as though we could by this means obtain 
any assistance from such a being&#44; whether this be 

                <pb n="74"/>

74 THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 

actually existing&#44; such as the sun or moon&#44; or be 
only a creature of our imagination. It is likewise 
wrong and idolatrous to worship the Lord even in 
the manner the heathens serve their idols&#44; or to intro&#8211; 
duce into the holy religion which we have received&#44; 
customs not consistent with its letter and spirit. 

&#34;And ye shall overthrow their altars&#44; and break their pil&#8211; 
lars&#44; and burn their groves with fire &#59; and ye shall hew down 
the graven images of their gods&#44; and destroy the name of 
them out of that place. Ye shall not do so unto the Lord 
your God.&#34; Deut. xii. 3&#44; 4. 

&#34; Take heed to thyself&#44; that thou be not ensnared to follow 
them after they have been destroyed from before thee&#44; and 
that thou inquire not after their gods&#44; saying&#44; How did these 
nations use to serve their gods &#63; even so will I do likewise. 
Thou shalt not do so unto the Lord thy God j for every abomi&#8211; 
nation to the Lord which He hateth have they done unto their 
gods.&#34; Ibid. 30&#44; 31. 

&#34; Because they have forsaken me&#44; &#8212; and have built the high&#8211; 
places of Baal&#44; to burn their sons in fire as burnt&#8211;offerings to 
Baal&#44; which I did not command&#44; nor spoke&#44; and which came 
not in my mind &#58; behold&#44; therefore&#44; days are coming&#44; that &#8212; I 
will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this 
place &#8212; and I will make this city desolate and a hissing &#58; every 
one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss&#44; because 
of all its plagues.&#34; Jer. xix. 4&#8211;8. 

17. What else is prohibited under this precept &#63; 

It is sinful&#44; and showing a want of faith in God&#44; 
to place confidence in things which have no influence 
upon our fortunes. By this I mean that we ought 
to regard signs&#44; omens&#44; fortune&#8211;telling&#44; or similar 
superstitious notions&#44; as withdrawing us from our 
God&#44; who alone is the Ruler of our life and fortune&#59; 
and if we are convinced that our intentions are law&#8211; 
ful and honourable&#44; we should fearlessly fulfil to do 
what we intended&#44; and not be frightened by what 
superstitious fears or foolish sign might threaten&#44; 
according to the opinion of the ignorant and those 
weak of faith. 

&#34; Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob&#44; nor divina&#8211; 

                <pb n="75"/>

THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 75 

tion against Israel at this time it shall be said to Jacob and 
to Israel&#44; what God hath wrought.&#34; Numb&#44; xxiii. 23. 

18. Does this commandment prohibit nothing else&#63; 

It likewise is sinful to imagine God as possessed 
of a material form&#44; or as having the faults of a mortal 
being. It is sinning against the dignity of the Su&#8211; 
preme&#44; to teach or to believe that lie ever divided 
himself into parts&#44; or that any change was made in 
the being of the Deity&#59; farther&#44; that the Lord is inca&#8211; 
pable of doing whatever is pleasing to Him&#44; or that 
He requires any mediator or assistant to grant salva&#8211; 
tion to the creatures which He alone has created. In 
short. w r e are forbidden to ascribe to God any other 
qualities than those which He has taught us himself. 

&#34; To whom then will ye liken God&#44; and what likeness will 
ye compare to Him V&#42; Isa. xl. 18. 

&#34; Fear not&#44; thou worm of Jacob&#44; men of Israel &#33; I help 
thee&#44; saith the Lord&#44; and I&#44; the holy One of Israel&#44; am thy 
Redeemer.&#34; Ibid. xli. 14. 

&#34;I&#44; I am the everlasting One&#44; and beside me there is no 
saviour. I have told&#44; and I have saved&#44; and I have pro&#8211; 
claimed&#44; and no strange god was among you&#44; and you are my 
witnesses&#44; saith the Lord&#44; and I am God. &#8212; I&#44; the Lord&#44; am 
your holy One&#44; the Creator of Israel your King.&#34; Ibid&#44; xliii. 
11&#8211;15. 

19. When are we guilty of a refined species of idolatry &#63; 

When we fear any existing thing more than God&#44; 
or when we place greater confidence in any earthly 
thing than in our heavenly Father. It is therefore 
rebellion against the Lord&#44; if we omit doing his will&#44; 
in order to gain money&#44; or to please another man&#44; or 
from fear of offending those who like ourselves are 
creatures&#44; bound to obey the Creator&#47; And we are 
not acting as honest servants of God&#44; if we value 
ourselves on account of our riches&#44; political power&#44; 
or great wisdom&#44;&#42;. thereby forgetting to serve Him&#59; 
or if we ascribe such possessions to our own skill and 
power&#44; and not to the goodness of God&#44; from whom 
all our happiness comes. 

                <pb n="76"/>

76 THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 

&#34; Beware&#44; that thou forget not the Lord thy God&#44; so as not 
to observe his commandments&#44; and judgments&#44; and statutes&#44; 
which I command thee this day. That&#44; &#34;when thou hast eaten 
and art satisfied&#44; and hast built good houses and dwe&#39;t therein&#59; 
and when thy herds and flocks multiply&#44; and thy silver and 
thy gold are multiplied&#44; and all that thou hast is multiplied&#44; 
thy heart be not lifted up&#44; and thou forget the Lord thy Grod&#44; 
who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt&#44; from the 
house of slavery &#58; &#8212; and thou say in thy heart&#44; My power and 
the might of my hand have obtained me all this wealth&#59; 
but thou shalt remembep the Lord thy God&#44; for it is He 
who giveth thee power to get wealth j that He may fulfil his 
covenant&#44; which He swore unto thy fathers&#44; as it is this day.&#34; 
Deut. viii. 11&#8211;18. 

20. How does the second commandment read in continuation &#63; 

 &#34;For I the Lord thy God am a watchful God&#44; 
visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children&#44; 
unto the third and fourth generation of them that 
hate me &#59; and showing kindness unto the thousandth 
generation of them that love me&#44; and keep my com&#8211; 
mandments.&#34; 

21. What are we to learn from this &#63; 

That God is just when He punishes&#44; and merciful 
in forgiving our sins. 

&#34; For his anger is momentary&#44; but his favour is everlasting.&#34; 
Ps. xxx. 6. 

22. Please to explain yourself a litttle more at length &#58; did you 
not say &#34; Visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children&#44; 
unto the third and fourth generation&#63;&#34; 

Yes&#44; so says the Scripture&#59; but it adds also &#34;of 
them that hate me &#59;&#34; when the children persevere in 
their fathers&#39; sinning&#44; then will they be punished for 
their own wrongs and bear the iniquity of their 
fathers&#44; since the consequences of the preceding 
punishment will and must be continued&#44; whilst there 
is no merit in us to deserve the return of God&#39;s 
favour. As we read &#58; 

&#34;And. they that are left of you shall pine away for their 
iniquity in the lands of your enemies&#44; and also for the 

                <pb n="77"/>

THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 77 

iniquity of their fathers with them&#44; shall they pine away&#47; 1 
Lev. xxvi. 39. 

Which is explained &#34;for the iniquity of their 
fathers with them&#44;&#34; when they persevere in the wrong 
done by their fathers&#44; and are not warned by the 
punishment sent upon these. 

23. I understand you therefore to mean that&#44; only when the 
misconduct of the children deserves punishment&#44; will they receive 
the consequences of their fathers&#39; sin &#59; how is it when a wicked 
father has a virtuous child&#63; 

When the child is virtuous and obedient to God&#39;s 
will&#44; when&#44; seeing how his father merited the visita&#8211; 
tion of the Lord&#44; he himself returns and seeks to 
serve h &#59; x Maker in faith&#44; and truth &#58; then will most 
assuredly no evil come to him for the sin of his 
parent &#59; on the contrary&#44; he will be blessed&#44; because&#44; 
seeing the evil done&#44; he preferred the service of 
Heaven to the vain doings of the world. 

&#34; But if from there thou wilt seek the Lord thy God&#44; thou 
shalt find Him &#58; if thou seek Him with all thy heart and 
with all thy soul.&#34; Deut. iv. 29. 

&#34; The word of the Lord came again unto me saying&#44; What 
mean ye&#44; that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel&#44; 
saying&#44; The fathers have eaten sour grapes&#44; and the children&#39;s 
teeth are set on edge&#63; As I live&#44; saith the Lord God&#44; ye 
shall not have any more to use this proverb in Israel. Behold&#44; 
all the souls are mine &#59; no less the soul of the father&#44; than the 
soul of the son&#44; is mine&#59; the soul that sinneth alone shall 
die.&#34; Ezek. xviii. 1&#8211;4. 

And in continuation we read &#58; 

&#34;As for his father&#44; because he cruelly oppressed&#44; spoiled 
his brother by violence&#44; and did that which is not good among 
his people&#44; surely he shall die for his iniquity. Yet say ye&#44; 
Why doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father&#63; &#8212; when 
the son hath done that which is lawful and right&#44; all my 
statutes he hath kept&#44; and hath done them &#58; he shall surely 
live. The soul that sinneth shall die. The son shall not 
bear the iniquity of the father&#44; nor shall the father bear the 
iniquity of the son &#59; the righteousness of the righteous shall

be upon him&#44; and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon 
hiin.&#34; Ezek. xviii. 18&#8211;20. 

24. How is it with the piety of the parents&#63; 

The piety of the parents will stand good to their 
children&#59; and we are promised in many parts of the 
Bible that God will remember the virtue of the good 
even to their undeserving children. 

&#34;And the Lord appeared to him the same night&#44; and said&#44; 
I am the Glod of Abraham thy father &#58; fear not&#44; for I am with 
thee&#44; and I will bless thee&#44; and multiply thy seed for the sake 
of Abraham my servant. &#34; Gen. xxvi. 24. 

&#34; Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it&#44; for David 
thy father&#39;s sake.&#34; 1 Kings xi. 12. 

&#34; Nevertheless I will not take the whole kingdom out of his 
hand&#44; &#8212; for the sake of David my servant&#44; whom I chose&#44; be&#8211; 
cause he kept my commandments and my statutes.&#34; Ibid. 34. 

25. What are the words of the third commandment&#63; 

&#34; Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy 
God in vain&#44; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless 
who taketh his name in vain.&#34; 

26. What does this precept command &#63; 

That we should love and fear the Lord our God to 
such an extent&#44; and regard Him holy to such a de&#8211; 
gree&#44; that we should never make use of his name 
except it be to promote sanctity in ourselves. 

&#34;And they shall lay my name upon the children of Israel&#44; 
and I will bless them.&#34; Numb. vi. 27. 

27. What is prohibited by this precept&#63; 

To swear uselessly by the name of God&#44; or to utter 
any curses &#59; but above all to swear falsely whilst in&#8211; 
voking the holy name &#59; or to lie or practise deceit 
under colour of religion &#59; lastly&#44; to pretend to the 
power of sorcery&#44; witchcraft or conjuration&#44; all which 
tend to dishonour the name of the Lord. 

&#34; You shall not swear by my name falsely&#44; and thereby pro&#8211; 
fane the name of thy God&#58; I am the Lord.&#34; Lev. xix. 12. 

&#34; Regard not those who have a familiar spirit&#44; nor the wiz&#8211; 
ards&#44; seek not to be defiled by them &#58; I am the Lord.&#34; lb. 31.

THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 79 

28. How and when are we permitted to use the name of the 
Lord&#63; 

In prayer and in studying or teaching the law. 

&#34;0 give thanks unto the Lord&#59; call on his holy name&#44; make 
kl own his deeds among the people. Sing&#44; and chaunt hymns 
unto Him &#41; proclaim ye all his wondrous works. Grlory in his 
holy name &#59; let the heart of them rejoice who seek the Lord.&#34; 
Ps. cv. 1&#8211;3. 

29. Upon what other occasion can the holy Name be used &#63; 

When we are called upon in a court of justice to 
take an oath as a confirmation of Avhat we say. 

30. What is an oath &#63; 

It is an assertion of a fact&#44; or an assumption of a 
duty&#44; at which we call God to witness that we say 
the exact truth as far as we know it&#44; or obligate our&#8211; 
selves to do as we speak&#44; and call upon Him to 
avenge the sin if there be falsehood&#44; untruth&#44; or de&#8211; 
ceit&#44; in what we declare to be true&#44; or intend doing. 

&#34; If any man trespass against his neighbour&#44; and an oath 
be laid upon him to swear&#44; and the oath come before thy altar 
in this house &#58; then hear Thou in heaven&#44; and do&#44; and judge 
thy servants&#44; to condemn the wicked&#44; in order to bring his way 
upon his head &#59; and to justify the righteous&#44; in order to give 
to him according to his righteousness.&#34; 1 Kings viii. 31&#44; 32. 

31. How does a man transgress this precept&#63; 

&#34;When he takes an oath&#44; that is&#44; swears&#44; against 
the truth&#44; and against his own inward conviction&#44; or 
conceals the whole or any part of the truth&#44; which 
is requisite to set any matter of controversy in its 
true light. 

&#34; If a person sin&#44; and hear the voice of swearing&#44; &#40;that is&#44; 
if he be called upon to testify&#44;&#41; and is a witness&#44; whether he 
hath seen or known any thing&#58; if he do not tell&#44; he shall bear 
nis iniquity.&#34; Lev. v. 1. 

&#34;Who shall ascend the mountain of the Lord &#63; and who 
shall stand in his holy place &#63; He who is clean of hands&#44; and 
pure of heart &#59; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity&#44; 
nor sworn deceitfully. He shall receive a blessing from the

80 THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 

Lord&#44; and righteousness from the God of his salvation.&#34; Ps. 
xxiv. 3&#8211;5. 

32. &#34;What is called &#34;swearing deceitfully&#63;&#34; 

If we affirm with an oath to do any thing which 
we afterwards omit doing&#44; we are guilty of rebellion 
against God &#59; because we have called upon Him to 
be witness to the honesty and truth of our intention&#44; 
and we now dare to show that we only meant to de&#8211; 
ceive Him who cannot be deceived&#44; and who knows 
all our thoughts &#58; it is therefore also that He will 
punish such rebellion with proper visitation. 

&#34;When thou shalt make a vow unto the Lord thy God&#44; 
thou shalt not delay to pay it&#59; for the Lord thy God will 
surely require it of thee&#44; and it would be sin in thee.&#34; Deut. 
xxiii. 21. 

&#34; Lest there be among you one &#8212; who when he heareth the 
words of this curse would bless himself in his heart&#44; saying&#44; I 
shall have peace&#44; though I walk in the imagination of my 
heart&#44; to add drunkenness to thirst&#58; him the Lord will not 
forgive&#44; but then the anger of the Lord and his indignation 
will smoke against that man&#44; and every curse written in this 
book will rest upon him&#44; and the Lord will blot out his name 
from under the heaven. And the Lord will single him out 
unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel&#44; according to all the 
curses of the covenant&#44; which are written in this book of the 
law.&#34; Ibid. xxix. 17&#8211;20. 

&#34; Who sweareth to his own hurt and changeth not &#8212; he that 
doth these things shall not be moved for ever.&#34; Ps. xv. 4&#44; 5. 

33. What are the words of the fourth commandment &#63; 

&#34;Remember the Sabbath&#8211;day to keep it holy&#59; sis 
days thou shalt labour&#44; and do all thy work &#59; but the 
seventh day is the Sabbath in honour of the Lord 
thy God &#58; on it thou shalt not do any work&#44; neither 
thou&#44; nor thy son&#44; nor thy daughter&#44; thy man&#8211;ser&#8211; 
vant&#44; nor thy maid&#8211;servant&#44; nor thy cattle&#44; nor thy 
stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days 
the Lord made heaven and earth&#44; the sea&#44; and all 
that is in them&#44; and rested on the seventh day &#59; 
therefore&#44; the Lord blessed the Sabbath&#8211;day and 
hallowed it.&#34; 

                <pb n="81"/>

THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 81 

34. &#34;What are we taught by this precept &#63; 

We should out of love and reverence to the Lord 
regard as holy that day which He has set apart as 
devoted to his service&#44; and do nothing to profane it. 
God is the Master of our labour&#44; the Possessor of our 
bodies&#44; and&#44; as such&#44; He demands of us that we&#44; his 
servants&#44; should cease from labour one day in seven&#44; 
and this on the last day of that period which He 
instituted as the week from the first creation of man 
upon the earth. 

&#34; Ye shall keep my Sabbaths&#44; and reverence my sanctuary &#58; 
I am the Lord.&#34; Lev. xxvi. 2. 

&#34;And say unto them&#44; Hear ye the word of the Lord&#44; ye 
kings of Judah&#44; and all Judah&#44; and all the inhabitants of 
Jerusalem&#44; that enter in by these gates &#58; Thus saith the Lord&#44; 
Take heed to yourselves and carry no burden on the Sabbath&#8211; 
day &#59; nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem &#59; neither carry 
forth a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath&#8211;day&#44; neither 
do ye any work&#44; but hallow ye the Sabbath&#8211;day&#44; as I com&#8211; 
manded your fathers.&#34; Jer. xvii. 20&#8211;22. 

35. What is the meaning and object of the Sabbath &#63; 

The Sabbath is a sign of the covenant between us 
and our Creator&#44; by which we are to be sanctified&#44; 
and acknowledge that we are sincerely convinced of 
our subjection to his will. 

&#34; And the Lord spoke unto Moses&#44; saying&#44; Speak thou also 
unto the children of Israel&#44; saying&#44; Verily my Sabbaths ye 
shall keep&#59; for it is a sign between me and you throughout 
your generations&#44; that ye may know that I am the Lord who 
sanctify you. &#8212; And the children of Israel shall keep the Sab&#8211; 
bath&#44; observing the Sabbath throughout their generations&#44; for 
a perpetual covenant. It is a sign between me and the chil&#8211; 
dren of Israel for ever&#59; for in six days the Lord made heaven 
and earth&#44; and on the seventh day He rested.&#34; Exod. xxxi. 
12&#8211;17. 

36. How shall we sanctify the Sabbath &#63; 

We shall sanctify the Sabbath by abstaining from 
labour and business&#44; and spend it in devotional 

                <pb n="82"/>

82 THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 

exercises and contemplating the word and works of 
God. 

&#34; Ye shall keep the Sabbath&#44; for it is holy unto you &#59; every 
one that defileth it shall surely be put to death j for whosoever 
doth any work thereon&#44; that soul shall be cut off from among 
his people.&#34; Exod. xxxi. 14. 

37. What sort of labour is prohibited&#63; 

Every sort of labour&#44; even the slightest&#44; were it 
even but for amusement. The Sabbath is intended 
as a day of perfect rest&#44; and we cannot therefore do 
any work&#44; for instance&#44; writing&#44; playing on instru&#8211; 
ments&#44; travelling&#44; superintending the work of others&#44; 
or similar things&#44; without infringing the command&#8211; 
ment&#44; though we ourselves might not call such 
things labour. 

&#34; If thou restrain thy foot on the Sabbath&#8211;day&#44; not doing 
thy pleasure on my holy day&#44; and call the Sabbath a delight&#44; 
and the holy feast of the Lord honourable &#59; and honour it by 
refraining from thy usual ways&#44; from pursuing thy pleasure&#44; 
and speaking vain words &#58; then shalt thou find delight in the 
Lord&#44; and I will cause thee to tread upon the high places of 
the earth&#44; and I will cause thee to enjoy the inheritance of 
Jacob thy father &#59; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.&#34; 
Isaiah lviii. 13&#44; 14. 

38. Is it permitted for us to work on the Sabbath from fear 
of losing money&#44; or of not gaining as much as otherwise we 
might do &#63; 

By no means &#59; all our work must stop before the 
Sabbath begins &#59; on Friday&#44; or sixth day afternoon&#44; 
before the sun goes down&#44; every true Israelite should 
be prepared to do honour to the Lord&#39;s day&#59; he 
should be clad in clean and decent clothes&#44; and go 
to the house of God to offer up his prayers in thank&#8211; 
fulness and freedom from care &#59; nor suffer the fear 
of loss&#44; or of not gaining enough&#44; to induce him to 
pursue his usual labours on the day of rest. 

39. Do I understand you to say that we are to rest on the 
Sabbath&#44; even if we lose money by so doing &#63; 

This is the law &#59; and no one who professes to have 

                <pb n="83"/>

THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 83 

faith in the Lord his Maker can transgress it with&#8211; 
out confessing that he is not sincere in his religious 
professions. For we read &#58; 

&#34; Six days thou shalt do work&#59; but on the seventh day 
thou shalt rest &#58; even in ploughing and in harvest thou shalt 
rest.&#34; Exod. xxxiv. 21&#44; 

This text teaches us that even the farmer&#44; who 
can only work in such weather as is suitable to his 
labours&#44; must leave his field&#8211;work undone&#44; whenever 
the Sabbath commences &#59; and from this we may 
draw a comparison to every other employment in 
which we may be engaged. 

40. You said &#34; That no one who professes to have faith in the 
Lord can transgress this precept&#44; without confessing that he is not 
sincere&#58;&#34; why not&#63; 

Because Grod promises us his blessing if we rest &#59; 
and the violator of the Sabbath proves by his acts 
that he does not have confidence or faith in the pro&#8211; 
mises of the unchanging One &#59; and surely there can 
be no greater act of rebellion&#44; than a disbelief of the 
truth of the Lord. 

41. Do you know of an instance in the Bible&#8211;history of a spe&#8211; 
cial manifestation of the holiness of the Sabbath &#63; 

When God had redeemed our forefathers from 
Egypt&#44; He led them into the land of Arabia&#44; in 
order to teach them more effectually how He wished 
them to serve Him. But the country&#44; in which it 
was his pleasure to cause them to sojourn for a pe&#8211; 
riod of forty years&#44; is one in which there is scarcely 
a single spot where any thing can grow&#44; &#8212; it is what 
we call a desert&#44; and is known by the name of the 
Arabian desert&#44; or at times Stony Arabia. When 
they now became dissatisfied because they had no 
bread to eat&#44; the Lord sent them every day a new 
species of food&#44; especially created for the people 
consisting of at least two millions of persons. This 
was called Manna. Now they obtained every day 
for each person one omer&#8211;full &#59; but on the sixth day 

                <pb n="84"/>

84 THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 

there were two for each&#44; because on the seventh day 
no manna fell &#58; tfcus proving&#44; that it was a day holy 
to the Lord&#44; and no one should even go out and 

father up what was on other days provided without 
uman labour. 

&#34; And it came to pass&#44; that on the sixth day they gathered 
twice as much bread&#44; two omers for each one&#59; and all the 
chiefs of the congregation came and told Moses. And he said 
unto them&#44; This is what the Lord hath said&#44; To&#8211;morrow is the 
rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord j what ye wish to bake&#44; 
bake now&#44; and what you wish to boil&#44; boil now &#59; and all the 
remainder lay up for you to be kept until the morning. And 
they laid it up until the morning as Moses had bidden &#59; and it 
did not stink&#44; nor was there any worm therein. And Moses 
said&#44; Eat it to&#8211;day&#44; for to&#8211;day is a Sabbath unto the Lord &#58; 
to&#8211;day ye shall not find it in the field. Six days ye shall 
gather it&#44; but on the seventh day is the Sabbath&#44; on it there 
shall be none.&#34; Exod. xvi. 22&#8211;26. 

42. But is it not matter of indifference which day of the seven 
is kept holy&#63; And is there any evidence that the seventh day 
was always looked upon as the Sabbath &#63; 

In reply to your first question I would say that&#44; 
as the Lord ordained the seventh day&#44; it must be 
requisite that this and no other day should be kept 
holy &#59; He sanctified the seventh and no other day &#59; 
we have therefore no right to choose any other as a 
day of rest and sanctincation. To your second ques&#8211; 
tion I have to answer&#44; that there is positive proof&#44; 
that at the time of Nehemiah&#44; which is at the close 
of the books of the Bible&#44; the Sabbath was again 
confirmed&#44; and declared to be holy. Now if it even 
were possible to suppose that God could change&#44; 
which we do not believe&#44; there is no evidence in 
Scripture that He has done so&#59; for after Neb emiah 
to this day&#44; there has arisen no prophet by whom the 
Lord has been pleased to make his will known &#59; and 
surety mere men have no right to alter what God has 
established. 

&#34;And it came to pass&#44; that when the gates of Jerusalem 

                <pb n="85"/>

THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 85 

were closed before the Sabbath&#44; I commanded that the doors 
should be locked&#44; and I charged that none should open them 
till after the Sabbath &#59; and some of my servants I placed by 
the gates&#44; that no burden should be brought in on the Sabbath&#8211; 
day.&#34; Neh. xiii. 19. 

43. Is there any occasion when work may be done&#63; 

Only in case of actual necessity to preserve the 
life&#44; or to prevent danger to the life of one or more 
of our fellow&#8211;men &#59; because the preservation of hu&#8211; 
man life is the first duty which is commanded to us. 

44. What are the words of the fifth commandment&#63; 

&#34; Honour thy father and thy mother &#59; that thy 
days may be prolonged in the land which the Lord 
thy God giveth thee.&#34; 

45. What are we commanded by this precept&#63; 

We should honour and fear God in the respect 
and honour we pay to our parents&#44; and to obey their 
commands equally as the word of God&#44; whenever the 
will of our parents does not demand a disregard of 
the divine law&#59; and to do nothing which could vex 
them or make them angry. 

&#34; He that smiteth his father or his mother shall surely be 
put to death. &#8212; And he that curseth his father or his mother 
shall surely be put to death.&#34; Exod. xxi. 15&#8211;17. 

&#34; Ye shall fear every man his mother and his father&#44; and 
keep my Sabbaths &#58; I am the Lord your God.&#34; Lev. xix. 3. 

&#34; My son&#44; keep the commandment of thy father&#44; and for&#8211; 
sake not the law of thy mother. Bind them continually upon 
thy heart&#44; and tie them about thy neck. When thou goest&#44; it 
shall lead thee &#59; when thou sleepest&#44; it shall guard thee &#59; and 
wheu thou awakest&#44; it shall talk with thee.&#34; Prov. vi. 2U&#8211;2&#8211;. 

46. In what light do you look upon this commandment&#63; 

As the noblest duty of man. AVe are to love our 
parents who watch over us in our helpless infancy&#59; 
who provide with anxious care&#44; under God&#44; for all 
our wants &#59; who attend us during the hours of sick&#8211; 
ness and affliction &#59; who labour for us that we may 
have ease and plenty. We are to esteem them&#44; be&#8211; 

                <pb n="86"/>

cause they point out to us the way of life&#44; in teach&#8211; 
ing us the law of God&#44; and directing us to observe 
the duties which&#44; if observed&#44; will render us happy 
and cheerful. How wicked&#44; therefore&#44; is the child 
that disregards the words of father or mother &#33; such 
a one cannot love his God &#59; one who loves not God 
cannot love his fellow&#8211;men &#59; and one who has no 
love for others is a useless member of society&#44; and is 
an evil&#44; a disgrace&#44; and not deserving of the life that 
has been given him&#44; nor of the favours he daily 
receives from his Maker. 

&#34; Cursed be he who lightly esteemeth his father or his 
mother.&#34; Deut. xxvii. 16. 

&#34; The eye that mocketh at his father&#44; and despiseth to obey 
his mother &#8212; the ravens of the valley shall pluck it out&#44; and 
the&#39; young eagles shall eat it.&#34; Prov. xxx. 17. 

47. In what manner should we honour our parents &#63; 

By love&#44; obedience&#44; and gratitude. Love&#44; because 
they are our best friends and kindest benefactors &#59; 
obedience&#44; because they are to us on earth what God 
is to us in heaven&#44; the authors of our being &#59; and gra&#8211; 
titude&#44; as a slight return for their care and kindness. 

&#34;A wise son maketh the father glad&#59; but a foolish son is 
the grief of his mother.&#34; Prov. x. 1. 

48. What else is commanded by this precept&#63; 

We shall out of reverence to the Lord honour and 
love our teachers and instructors &#59; pay deference to 
our superiors and masters &#59; and honour and respect 
aged people&#44; and endeavour to be at all times 
obedient&#44; in all lawful things&#44; to the will of all these 
persons. 

&#34; Before a hoary head thou shalt rise up&#44; and honour the 
face of an old man&#44; and fear thy God &#58; Ian the Lord.&#34; Lev. 
xix. 32. 

&#34; Hear me now&#44; therefore&#44; ye children&#44; and depart not 
from the words of my mouth. &#8212; That thou mourn not at last&#44;

and I have not obeyed the voice of my teachers&#44; nor inclined 
my ear to them that instructed me I&#34; Prov. v. 7&#8211;13. 

49. What duty is derived likewise from the fifth commandment&#63; 

The love for our country. 

50. What do you understand by &#34;our country&#63;&#34; 

Not only that country in which we were born&#44; but 
also&#44; and chiefly&#44; that in which we enjoy liberty of 
person&#44; security of property&#44; and the protection and 
benefit of the laws enacted for the common welfare. 

51. How is this love to be shown&#63; 

We ought to love our country to such an extent&#44; 
that we should do whatever might benefit it&#59; we 
should likewise pay due deference to the laws&#44; pro&#8211; 
vided always they do not contradict the Jaw of God &#59; 
pay the taxes and dues without any evasion or fraud&#44; 
and be obedient to the authorities&#44; without regard 
whether they be monarchical or republican&#59; and 
whenever our country should be in danger from 
foreign enemies or domestic commotions&#44; we&#44; as 
Israelites&#44; are bound to hurry to its defence&#44; and 
share the dangers and toil of our other fellow&#8211;citizens. 

&#34;Thus saithtfie Lord of hosts&#44; the God of Israel&#44; unto all 
that are captives&#44; whom I have caused to be carried away from 
Jerusalem unto Babylon&#44; Build ye houses&#44; and dwell in them&#59; 
and plant gardens&#44; and eat the fruit of them.&#8212; And seek the 
peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried 
away captives&#44; and pray unto the Lord for it&#59; for in the peace 
thereof shall ye have peace.&#34; Jer. xxix. 4&#8211;7. 

52. What is the sixth commandment&#63; 
&#34;Thou shalt not kill.&#34; 

53. How do you understand this&#63; 

We should love and reverence God in his image &#59; 
that is to say&#44; we should regard the life of our fellow&#8211; 
men as sacred&#44; and of equal value with our own &#59; 
and reflect&#44; that the Almighty&#44; who has given us 
being&#44; has created also all other human beings in 
his image&#44; and has given them life and being.

55. What does the Bible call &#34; murder V 

First. An actual slaying or taking away of life &#59; 
God lias given us life&#44; and we are not permitted to 
take away either our own or that of another. Be&#8211; 
cause&#44; since we have been sent on earth for a wise 
purpose&#44; we are not authorized to throw away our 
own life without being summoned by the actual 
agency of the Lord&#59; or to deprive another of his 
earthly being&#44; except by a judicial decision&#44; by which 
evil&#8211;doers can be punished with death according to 
the expressed will of the divine law &#58; 

&#34; He that smiteth a man that he die&#44; shall surely be puj&#8211; to 
death.&#34; Exod. xxi. 12. 

Secondly. The injuring of our neighbour even in 
a remote degree&#44; either in body or in soul. 

56. How in &#34;body&#63;&#34; 

We are forbidden to strike&#44; wound&#44; maim&#44; or cause 
bodily pain to any one&#44; or to let him suffer from 
cold&#44; hunger&#44; or thirst&#44; if we can by a possibility re&#8211; 
lieve him. 

&#34;And if a man cause a blemish on his neighbour&#58; as he 
hath done&#44; so shall it be done to him.&#34; Lev. xxiv. 19. 

&#34;Is it not&#44; to distribute thy bread to the hungry&#63; and to 
bring the miserably afflicted poor into thy house &#63; when thou 
seest the naked&#44; that thou clothe him&#44; and that thou hide not 
thyself from thy own flesh &#63;&#34; Isa. lviii. 7. 

57. How in &#34;soul&#63;&#34;

haviour&#59; in short&#44; in any manner which could 

                <pb n="89"/>

THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 89 

mortify him&#44; or tend to shorten his life. All men 
are equal before the Lord&#44; though one may be richer&#44; 
more powerful&#44; or wiser than the other &#59; and there&#8211; 
fore no one has a right&#44; and it is for this reason 
sinful&#44; to do any act to another which he would look 
upon as an injury if done to himself. 

&#34; Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart&#59; thou mayest 
in any wise rebuke thy neighbour&#44; and not suffer sin upon 
him. Thou shalt not avenge&#44; nor bear any grudge against the 
children of thy people&#59; but thou shalt love thy neighbour 
like thyself&#58; I am the Lord.&#34; Lev. xix. 17&#44; 18. 

&#34;Thou shalt not deliver up to his master the servant who 
hath escaped unto thee from his master.&#34; Deut. xxiii. 16. 

&#34; Say not unto thy neighbour&#44; Go and come again&#44; and to&#8211; 
morrow I will give&#44; when thou hast it by thee. Devise not 
evil against thy neighbour&#44; who dwelleth securely by thee 
Strivenot with a man without cause&#44; if he have done thee no 
harm.&#34; Prov. iii. 28&#8211;30. 

58. What is the seventh commandment&#63; 
&#34;Thou shalt not commit adultery.&#34; 

59. What is meant by this &#63; 

~We should reverence the covenant&#44; entered into 
by man and wife in the presence of the Lord&#44; and 
hold it so sacred as to do nothing to violate it. 

&#34; And the man that committeth adultery with another man&#39;s 
w jf e &#8212; the adulterer and adulteress shall surely be put tc 
death.&#34; Lev. xx. 10. 

60. What are we commanded by this precept&#63; 

Man and wife whom the Lord has joined in the 
holy bonds ol wedlock should love each other&#44; and 
live in faith&#44; union and harmony&#44; and not violate 
the covenant which they have entered into. God 
was witness to their vow&#44; and He will surely avenge 
the wrong&#44; if even human beings should not be 
able to discover the sin which has been committed 
secretly.

and cleave unto his wife&#59; and they become one flesh&#47;&#39; Gen. 
ii. 24. 

61. What else are we taught in this precept &#63; 

We should be particular in our conduct &#59; not to 
speak&#44; nor even think&#44; indecent things&#59; to be chaste 
and modest in our behaviour&#44; and not to acquire 
habits which might be indecorous&#44; or offensive to 
others &#59; and lastly&#44; not to dress so as to expose the 
body more than strict modesty will allow&#44; nor should 
men and women put on any other clothes than the 
customs of the country permit each sex to wear. Our 
body is the work of God&#44; and we should not defile 
it&#44; which immodest conduct would do &#59; we are to be 
holy&#44; because He is holy&#44; and this holiness consists 
in due propriety&#44; and decorum in our behaviour&#44; and 
in obedience to the precepts of the law. 

&#34; A woman shall not wear that which pertaineth nnto a 
man&#59; neither shall a man put on a woman&#39;s garment&#59; for 
every one that doth so is an abomination unto the Lord thy 
God&#47;&#39; Deut. xxii. 5. 

62. What is the eighth commandment &#63; 
&#34;Thou shalt not steal.&#34; 

63. What is meant by this precept&#63; 

We shall&#44; loving and fearing the Lord our God&#44; 
regard as sacred the property which He has given 
to our neighbour&#44; and do nothing to deprive him of 
the same&#44; either through our own agency or that of 
others. 

64. What do the Scriptures call &#34; stealing &#63;&#34; 

First. We shall not commit actual theft or rob&#8211; 
bery &#59; we shall not have false weights and measures &#59; 
not sell fraudulent wares or merchandise&#59; not cheat 
any one in any manner whatever&#44; nor withhold from 
him the wages he has earned&#44; or any part of his pro&#8211; 
perty which may be in our hands&#44; either accidentally 
or by having been entrusted to us. 

&#34; Ye shall not steal&#44; neither deal falsely&#44; nor lie one to 
another. And ye shall not swear by my name falsely&#44; and 

                <pb n="91"/>

THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 91 

not profane the name of thy God&#58; I am the Lord. Thou 
shalt not defraud thy neighbour&#44; nor rob him&#59; the wages of 
him that is hired shall not abide with thee until the morning.&#34; 
Lev. xix. 11&#8211;13. 

&#34; Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment&#44; in mete&#8211; 
yard &#40;cloth measure&#41;&#44; in weight&#44; or iu measure. Just balances&#44; 
just weights&#44; a just ephah&#44; and a just hin&#44; shall ye have &#58; I am 
the Lord your God&#44; who have brought you out of the land of 
Egypt.&#34; Ibid. 35&#44; 36. 

65. What else is prohibited under this commandment&#63; 

Secondly. We shall not commit secret theft &#59; we 
shall never try to obtain any thing through artful&#8211; 
ness&#44; lying&#44; or fraud&#44; nor through concealment of the 
quality of merchandise&#44; usury&#44; or selfish seeking of 
our own interest&#44; thereby disregarding the rights or 
property of others &#59; farther&#44; we are prohibited to re&#8211; 
ceive or conceal stolen property&#44; or to retain any 
thing which has been lost&#44; and has come in our pos&#8211; 
session&#44; by our finding it&#44; or .receiving it from others&#44; 
even though the loser be our eneni} r . 

&#34; If a person sin and commit a trespass against the Lord&#44; 
and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to 
keep&#44; or in fellowship&#44; or in a thing taken away by violence&#44; or 
hath defrauded his neighbour &#59; or hath found that which was 
lost&#44; and lieth concerning it&#44; and sweareth falsely&#59; in any of 
all these that a man doth&#44; sinning therein &#58; &#8212; then shall he 
bring his trespass&#8211;offering unto the Lord.&#34; Lev. v. 21&#8211;25. 

&#34;Thou shalt not see thy brother&#39;s ox or his sheep go astray&#44; 
and hide thyself from them &#58; thou shalt in any case bring 
them again unto thy brother. And if thy brother be not nigh 
unto thee&#44; and if thou know him not&#44; then shalt thou bring it 
unto thy own house&#44; and it shall be with thee until thy bro&#8211; 
ther seek after it&#44; and thou shalt restore it to him again. In 
like manner shalt thou do with his ass j and so shalt thou do 
with his raiment and so shalt thou do with every thing lost 
by thy brother&#44; which he hath lost&#44; and thou hast found &#58; thou 
mayest not hide thyself.&#34; Deut. xxii. 1&#8211;3. 

&#34; When thou dost lend unto thy neighbour any thing&#44; thou 
shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge. Thou shalt 
stand without&#44; and the man to whom thou dost lend shall 

                <pb n="92"/>

92 THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 

bring out the pledge abroad unto tbee. And if the man be 
poor&#44; thou shalt not sleep with his pledge &#59; in any case thou 
shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down&#44; 
that he may sleep in his own raiment and bless thee &#59; and it 
shall be righteousness unto thee before the Lord thy God.&#34; 
Dent. xxiv. 10&#8211;13. 

66. Is possession only confined to property&#63; by which I mean&#44; 
has a man nothing besides goods and actual visible possessions 
in which he can be injured&#63; 

Yes &#59; such as his honour&#44; his good name&#44; his peace 
of mind&#44; his words and his thoughts made known in 
his writings &#59; all these and similar things are likewise 
possessions&#44; and are to be sacred as much as goods 
and property which our neighbour has acquired. 

67. What is therefore prohibited with regard to them &#63; 

It is sinful to slander&#44; abuse or vilify any one&#44; by 
which means his honour or fair name might be in&#8211; 
jured in the least &#59; likewise to report the words he 
has spoken to another&#44; or to carry to him what others 
have said to his disadvantage&#44; by which his peace of 
mind might be disturbed&#44; unless the cause of truth 
or justice should absolutely demand it. We are also 
forbidden to divulge any secret entrusted to us &#59; to 
persuade another to do any thing which he ought 
not to do&#44; or to flatter him so as to gain his favour&#44; 
by saying that to him which we know he does not 
merit &#59; and&#44; lastly&#44; to appropriate designedly to our&#8211; 
selves the words and thoughts of others as our own&#44; 
for by this means we deprive them of their just and 
due praise&#44; or cause them actual injury. 

&#34; Thou shalt not go up and down as a tale&#8211;bearer among thy 
people.&#34; Lev. xix. 16. 

&#34; He that goeth about as a tale&#8211;bearer revealeth secrets &#59; 
and meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.&#34; Prov. 
xx. 19. 

&#34; Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself&#59; and dis&#8211; 
cover not the secret of another.&#34; Ibid. xxv. 9. 

68. What is the ninth commandment&#63; 

                <pb n="93"/>

THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 93 

&#34; Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy 
neighbour.&#34; 

69. What is meant by this &#63; 

&#34;We should always have the love and fear of God 
in our hearts&#44; so that we should never be induced to 
say any falsehood&#44; or give any untrue testimony 
against our neighbour &#59; but we should always say 
the truth&#44; and give publicity only to what is correct. 

&#34; If a false witness rise up against any man&#44; to testify 
against him that which is wrong &#58; then both the men&#44; between 
whom the controversy is&#44; shall stand before the Lord&#44; before 
the priests and the judges who shall be in those days. And 
the judges shall make diligent inquiry&#59; and&#44; behold&#33; if the 
witness be a false witness&#44; and has testified falsely against his 
brother &#58; then shall ye do unto him as he had thought to do 
unto his brother j so shalt thou put the evil away from the 
midst of thee.&#34; Deut. xix. 16&#8211;19. 

70. What is forbidden by this precept &#63; 

It is forbidden to give a false or unjust decision in 
judgment&#44; to calumniate any one&#44; to spread false 
reports&#44; or to give false evidence&#44; or to testify to any 
thing as absolutely true of which we have no direct 
and positive knowledge &#59; it is likewise sinful to be 
deceitful or double&#8211;dealing toward our neighbour&#44; or 
to be so anxious for reputation or overbearing as to 
induce us to act towards others in a proud and pre&#8211; 
sumptuous manner&#44; as though we were better than 
they. In short&#44; we should not do any thing or say 
any thing without having the strict truth on our 
side &#59; and whoever does otherwise&#44; either directly 
through injustice&#44; or indirectly through deceit&#44; false&#8211; 
hood&#44; or pride&#44; offends against the will of God. 

&#34; Thou shalt not raise a false report&#59; put not thy hand with 
the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.&#34; Exod. xxiii. 1. 

&#34; Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his 
cause.&#34; Ibid. 6. 

&#34; An ungodly person&#44; a wicked person&#44; walketh with a fro&#8211; 
ward mouth. He winketh with his eye&#44; pusheth with his 
feet&#44; pointeth with his fingers. Frowardness in his heart&#44; he 

                <pb n="94"/>

94 THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 

deviseth mischief continually &#59; he soweth discord.&#34; Prov. vi 
12&#8211;14. 

&#34; Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the 
Lord&#47;&#39; Ibid. xvi. 5. 

71. What is the tenth commandment&#63; 

&#34;Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour&#39;s house&#59; 
thou shalt not covet thy neighbour&#39;s wife&#44; nor his 
man&#8211;servant&#44; nor his maid&#8211;servant&#44; nor his ox&#44; nor 
his ass&#44; nor any thing that is thy neighbour&#39;s.&#34; 

72. What is meant by this precept&#63; 

The love and fear of the Lord should be deeply 
rooted in our heart &#59; we shall therefore purify our 
inclinations and feelings&#44; suppress all evil desires&#44; 
and remove every thought which could tend to in&#8211; 
duce us to injure our neighbour in any of his posses&#8211; 
sions which are lawfully his&#44; and which the Giver of 
all has assigned to him as his portion on earth. Such 
purity of thought will teach us benevolence for our 
fellow&#8211;men&#44; inasmuch as it must produce content 
with our own lot&#44; and render us thereby cheerful in 
the observance of the duties to others which the 
other precepts of the Decalogue demand of us. 

&#34; Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts&#44; saying&#44; Execute true 
judgment&#44; and show mercy and compassion every one to his 
brother&#59; and oppress not the widow and the fatherless&#44; the 
stranger and the poor&#59; and let none of you imagine evil 
against his brother in his heart.&#34; Zech. vii. 9&#44; 10. 

&#34; Stand in awe and sin not &#59; commune with your heart upon 
your bed&#44; and cease from murmuring.&#34; Ps. iv. 5. 

73. Can the mere thought be injurious&#63; 

Certainly &#59; inclination&#44; if not checked&#44; will become 
desire&#44; and unchecked desire will soon induce us to 
act &#59; and thus what was first but idle thought has be&#8211; 
come by gradual steps transgression and actual sin. 

&#34; Wo to them that devise iniquity&#44; and work evil upon their 
beds &#33; when the morning is light&#44; they practise it&#44; because it 
is in the power of their hand. And they covet fields&#44; and 
take them by violence&#59; and houses&#44; and take them away&#59; and 

                <pb n="95"/>

THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 95 

they oppress a man and his house&#44; and the master and his 
heritage.&#34; Micah ii. 1&#44; 2. 

74. What does the Bible call &#34; coveting&#63;&#34; 

We should never yield ourselves to any sensual 
desires&#44; that is to say&#44; we should never sutler our 
thoughts to desire those things which we cannot 
lawfully obtain &#59; nor are we justified to indulge in 
idle wishes &#58; but we should labour cheerfully&#44; relying 
upon God&#39;s blessing&#44; in order that we may avoid 
idleness and consequently escape sinning&#44; which is 
the usual consequence of a state of inactivity. 

&#34; And that ye seek not after the inclination of your heart&#44; 
and the delight of your eyes&#44; in pursuit of which ye have 
been led astray. That ye may remember&#44; and do all my com&#8211; 
mandments&#44; and be holy unto your God.&#34; Numb. xv. 39&#44; 40. 

&#34; I have treasured up thy words in my heart&#44; that I might 
not sin against Thee.&#34; Ps. cxix. 11. 

&#34; Blessed is every one who feareth the Lord&#44; who walketh 
in his ways. When thou eatest the labour of thy hands&#44; then 
shalt thou be happy&#44; and it shall be well with thee.&#34; Ibid&#44; 
cxxviii. 1&#44; 2. 

75. What else is prohibited by this precept&#63; 

It is forbidden to us to be envious of the wealth 
of others&#44; or to be jealous of their success. It should 
be enough for us to know that our neighbour&#39;s 
wealth and success proceed from the Lord&#59; and that&#44; 
therefore&#44; we would be in fact accusing Him&#44; who 
never wrongs&#44; of injustice&#44; were we to feel dissatis&#8211; 
faction&#44; because others are happy&#44; or more wealthy 
than we. 

&#34; Fret not thyself because of evil&#8211;doers&#44; nor be thou envious 
against the workers of iniquity. For they shall soon be cut 
down like the grass&#44; and wither as the green herb. Trust in 
the Lord&#44; and do good&#44; so shalt thou dwell in the land&#44; and be 
fed in faith. And thou shalt find delight in the Lord&#44; and 
He will give thee the desires of thy heart. Commit thy way 
unto the Lord j trust also in Him&#44; and He will bring it to 
pass. And He will bring forth thy righteousness as the light&#44; 
and thy judgment as the noon&#8211;day. Rest in the Lord&#44; and

hope patiently in Him &#59; fret not thyself because of him who 
prospereth in his way&#44; because of the man who bringeth 
wicked devices to pass.&#34; Ps. xxxvii. 1&#8211;7. 



CHAPTER VIII. 

THE KINGDOM OF THE MESSIAH. 

1. What do you call the Divine Kingdom on earth&#63; 

A time will come when all the people of the earth 
will be united under one paternal government&#44; and 
when all mankind will acknowledge the one and 
only true God&#44; and serve Him alone in truth and 
sincerity. 

&#34;And deliverers shall go up to Mount Zion&#44; to judge the 
mount of Esau&#59; and the kingdom shall be the Lord&#39;s.&#34; Obad. 
i. 21. 

&#34; And the Lord shall be King over all the earth &#58; on that 
day the Lord alone shall be acknowledged&#44; and his name shall 
also be one&#47;&#39; Zech. xiv. 9. 

2. In what is this description different from the present state 
of the world&#63; 

In this &#58; that at present parts of mankind are 
governed by unjust and tyrannical laws&#44; not founded 
upon the law of God&#44; but contradicting it in every 
respect &#59; and that the knowledge of true religion is 
confined to a very limited number of human beings &#59; 
whereas the greater part acknowledge not the one 
Supreme&#44; but invest Him with qualities foreign to 
his being&#44; or worship images and idols of their own 
invention. 

3. Do you think that this state will be altered&#63; and in what 
light do you look upon the Revelation at Sinai&#63; 

As I said&#44; I believe that nothing but the precepts 
of the Lord will be the rule of conduct for all men&#44; 
and that they will live under a government acknow&#8211; 
ledged to proceed from Him &#59; and I believe likewise&#44; 

                <pb n="97"/>

THE KINGDOM OP THE MESSIAH. 97 

that the revelation of the law on Sinai&#44; though at 
the time of its promulgation it was only given to the 
Israelites&#44; will at that period he the only law by the 
regulations of which all men will be governed. 

&#34; Also the sons of the stranger&#44; that join themselves to the 
Lord&#44; to serve Him&#44; and to love the name of the Lord to be 
his servants&#44; every one that keepeth the Sabbath from pol&#8211; 
luting it&#44; and taketh hold of my covenant &#58; even them will I 
bring unto my holy mountain&#44; and I will make them rejoice in 
my house of prayer&#59; their burnt&#8211;offerings and their sacrin&#58;es 
shall be accepted on my altar&#59; for my house shall be called a 
house of prayer for all nations.&#34; Isaiah lvi. 6&#44; 7. 

4. Upon what reasons do you ground this hope&#63; 

Upon the promises of the Lord made through the 
mouth of his servants the prophets. The other 
promises of the Lord have always seen their fulfil&#8211; 
ment&#44; and consequently no one who has faith in his 
Maker can doubt the fulfilment of this glorious hope 
for all mankind. 

5. Through whose agency will the Divine reign on earth be 
established &#63; » 

Through the Messiah&#44; or the anointed of God&#44; who 
is to descend from the family of David &#59; it is there&#8211; 
fore also called the reign or kingdom of the Messiah. 

&#34;And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse&#44; 
and a scion from his roots shall sprout forth. And the spirit 
of the Lord shall rest upon him&#59; the spirit of wisdom and 
understanding&#44; the spirit of counsel and might&#44; the spirit of 
knowledge and the fear of the Lord &#58; and it shall make him 
quick of understanding in the fear of the Lord&#59; and he shall 
not judge after the sight of his eyes&#44; nor decide according to 
the hearing of his ears. But with righteousness shall he iu.k>e 
the poor&#44; and decide with equity for the meek of the earth&#59; 
and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth&#44; and 
with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. And 
righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins&#44; and faithfulness 
the girdle of his hips. &#8212; And on that day it shall be the root 
out of Jesse&#44; who shall stand for an ensign to the nations &#59;

after him shall the gentiles inquire&#44; and his rest shall be 
glorious.&#34; Isaiah xi. 1&#8211;10. 

&#34; Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts&#44; saying&#44; Behold the man&#44; 
Branch shall be his name&#44; even from his descendants shall 
he grow up&#44; and he shall build the temple of the Lord &#58; yes&#44; 
ho shall build the temple of the Lord&#44; and he shall bear the 
glory&#44; and shall sit and rule upon his throne j and the priest 
also shall be upon his throne&#44; and the counsel of peace shall be 
between them both.&#34; Zech. vi. 12&#44; 13. 

6. What do you understand now by &#34; the king Messiah &#63;&#34; 
The Messiah is to be a person&#44; a human being&#44; 

sent by God to do those acts which He purposes 
should be done on earth at the time of the redemp&#8211; 
tion. He is to be endowed with wisdom more than 
any other man &#59; with superior intelligence&#44; and 
knowledge more penetrating than were ever given 
before &#59; and his government is to be terrible only to 
the wicked&#44; but peaceful and benevolent to the just&#44; 
no matter how poor or humble they may be. 

7. Is he to be independent of God&#39;s law&#63; or is he to do&#44; like 
other messengers of the Lord&#44; just what he is sent to do under the 
limitation and rule of the law &#63; 

The Messiah is to be entirely the servant of the 
Lord&#44; under the law&#44; just as every other Israelite &#59; 
he is to do nothing which the others are not per&#8211; 
mitted to do &#59; and his duties will be pointed out and 
strictly defined. As such therefore he is himself 
accountable&#44; and can accordingly have no power to 
be a mediator between God and man&#44; farther than 
Moses and the other prophets and pious men of our 
people were. In accordance with this view the pro&#8211; 
phet says &#58; 

&#34;And David my servant shall be king over them&#59; and they 
shall have all one shepherd &#58; the}&#39; shall also walk in my judg&#8211; 
ments&#44; and observe my statutes and do them.&#34; Ezek. xxxvii. 24. 

&#34; And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that 
gate without&#44; and shall stand by the door&#8211;post of the gate&#44; and 
the priests shall prepare his burnt&#8211;offering and peace&#8211;offerings&#44; 
and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate&#44; and then go 

                <pb n="99"/>

forth&#59; but the gate shall not be shut till the evening. Like&#8211; 
wise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this 
gate before the Lord on the Sabbaths and on the new moons.&#34; 
Ezek. xlvi. 2&#44; 3. 

8. What will take place when the reign of the Messiah is 
established &#63; 

The only pure faith&#44; the law promulgated by God&#44; 
will spread itself in its utmost purity&#44; free from all 
admixture which&#44; in process of time&#44; may have been 
mixed up with its precepts&#44; over all the earth&#44; and 
be the only governing principle of all hearts&#58; all 
men will then acknowledge the Only One&#44; the ever&#8211; 
lasting God&#44; as the sole object of their worship&#44; and 
love each other as friends and brothers. 

&#34; And it shall come to pass afterwards&#44; that I will pour out 
my spirit over all flesh &#59; and your sons and your daughters 
shall prophesy&#44; your old men shall dream dreams&#44; your young 
men shall see visions&#59; also upon the servants and upon the 
maid&#8211;servants even&#44; in those days&#44; will I pour out my spirit.&#34; 
Joel iii. 1&#44; 2. 

&#34; Then will I change unto the nations a pure language&#44; that 
they may all call on the name of the Lord&#44; and serve Him 
with one consent.&#34; Zeph. iii. 10. 

9. What will the Messiah especially effect for Israel&#63; 

He will be the means of the making of a new 
covenant between the Lord and Israel&#44; and through 
his agency the conversion of the whole people to 
righteousness will be effected&#44; in consequence of 
which change the Lord will forgive their sins&#44; and 
be no more angry with them for their former mis&#8211; 
conduct. 

&#34; For a short moment have I forsaken thee &#59; but with great 
mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face 
from thee for a moment &#59; but with everlasting kindness wih 
I have mercy on thee&#44; saith thy Redeemer the Lord&#47;&#39; Isaiah 

liv. 7&#44; 8. 

&#34; And the redeemer shall come to Zion&#44; and unto them that 
turn from transgression in Jacob&#44; saith the Lord. As for me&#44; 
this is my covenant with them&#44; saith the Lord &#58; My spirit

that is upon thee&#44; and my words which I have put in thy 
niouth&#44; shall not depart out of thy mouth&#44; nor out of the 
mouth of thy children&#44; nor out of the mouth of thy children&#39;s 
children&#44; saith the Lord&#44; from henceforth and for ever.&#34; Isa. 
lix. 20&#44; 21. 

&#34; Behold &#33; days are coming&#44; saith the Lord&#44; when I will 
make with the house of Israel&#44; and with the house of Judah&#44; 
a new covenant. Not like the covenant which I made with 
their fathers&#44; on the day when I took hold of their hand to 
bring them out of the land of Egypt&#44; which my covenant they 
violated&#44; and I felt disgust for them&#44; saith the Lord &#59; for this 
is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel 
after those days&#44; saith the Lord&#58; I have placed my law in 
their inmost part&#44; and upon their heart I will write it&#44; and I 
will be their God&#44; and they shall be my people. And they 
shall not teach any more one his neighbour and one his brother&#44; 
saying&#44; &#39;Know ye the Lord&#47; for they all shall know me&#44; from 
their small to their great ones&#44; saith the Lord&#44; for I will par&#8211; 
don their iniquity&#44; and their sin I will no more remember.&#34; 
Jer. xxxi. 31&#8212;34. 

10. Is there any other consequence to arise to Israel&#63; 

We are also promised that the people of Israel&#44; 
now scattered over all the earth&#44; are to be assembled 
again into one state in the land of Palestine&#44; &#8211;where 
they are to be governed by the king Messiah&#44; trader 
the rule of the divine law&#44; as were their forefathers 
in the time of the prophet Moses and at subsequent 
periods. The divisions and quarrels of the different 
sections of the country are to cease forever &#59; and 
the outcasts even of the nation&#44; they who have lost 
the name of Israel&#44; no matter where scattered&#44; shall 
be brought back from the most distant countries to 
the land of Canaan&#44; which shall then be free from 
the plague of ferocious beasts and noxious reptiles&#44; 
and be blessed with fruitfulness and plenty&#44; and no 
one shall make afraid or disturb the people&#44; who 
have so often before been the object of scorn and 
contempt to their enemies &#59; for these too will then 
acknowledge that the children of Israel are indeed 
the beloved of the Lord.

&#34;And it shall come to pass&#44; when all these things have 
come upon thee&#44; the blessing and the curse which I have set 
before thee&#44; and thou shalt call them to mind among all the 
nations whither the Lord thy God shall have driven thee&#44; and 
thou shalt return unto the Lord thy God&#44; and shalt obey his 
voice according to all that I command thee this day&#44; thou and 
thy children&#44; with all thy heart and with all thy soul &#58; that 
then the Lord thy God will restore thy captivity&#44; and have 
compassion upon thee&#44; and will return and gather thee from all 
the nations whither the Lord thy God shall have scattered 
thee If thy outcasts be at the utmost parts of heaven&#44; from 
there will the Lord thy God gather thee&#44; and from there 
will He fetch thee &#59; and the Lord thy God will bring thee into 
the land which thy fathers possessed&#44; and thou shalt possess 
it&#59; and He will do thee good&#44; and multiply thee above thy 
fathers.&#34; Deut. xxx. 1&#8211;5. 

&#34; And it shall come to pass on that day&#44; the Lord will put 
forth his hand again&#44; the second time&#44; to recover the remnant 
of his people&#44; which shall remain&#44; from Assyria&#44; and from 
Eoypt&#44; and from Pathros&#44; and from Cush&#44; and from Elam&#44; and 
from Shinar&#44; and from Hamath&#44; and. from the islands of the 
sea. And He will set up an ensign for the nations&#44; and will 
gather the outcasts of Israel&#44; and gather the dispersed of 
Judah from the four corners of the earth. The envy also of 
Ephraim shall depart&#44; and the adversaries of Judah shall be 
cut off&#59; Ephraim shall not envy Judah&#44; and Judah shall not 
vex Ephraim.&#34; Isaiah xi. 11&#8211;13. &#95; 

&#34;And speak to them&#44; Thus saith the Lord God&#44; Behold&#44; 1 
take the children of Israel from between the nations whither 
they have wandered&#44; and I will gather them from around&#44; and 
bring them unto their own land. And I will make them into 
one nation in the land&#44; on the mountains of Israel &#59; and one 
kino&#8211; shall be to them all as king&#44; and they shall be no more 
&#47;nations&#44; nor be any more divided into two kingdoms. And 
the}&#8211; shall not defile themselves any more with their idols&#44; and 
with their abominations&#44; and with all their transgressions &#59; and 
I will save them from all their places&#44; where they have sinned&#44; 
and I will purify them&#44; and they shall be my people&#44; and I will 
be their God. And my servant David shall be king over them&#44; 
and one shepherd shall be to them all&#44; and in my judgments 
they shall walk&#44; and my statutes they shall observe and do

them. And they shall dwell upon the land which I gave to 
my servant Jacob&#44; in which your fathers have dwelt&#44; they and 
their children and their children&#39;s children for ever&#44; and my 
servant David shall be prince to them for ever. And I will 
make with them a covenant of peace&#44; an everlasting covenant 
it shall be with them &#59; and I will place them&#44; and multiply 
them&#44; and fix my sanctuary among them for ever. And the 
nations shall know&#44; that I am the Lord who sanctify Israel.&#34;&#42; 
Ezek. xxxvii. 21&#8211;28. 

11. &#34;What will be the external situation of this kingdom&#63; 
Peace and good&#8211;will shall prevail over all the 

earth &#59; because the blessing of God and the know&#8211; 
ledge of his law shall be the universal portion of all 
mankind. 

&#34; They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain &#59; 
for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord&#44; as 
the waters cover the sea.&#34; Isaiah xi. 9. 

&#34;And it shall come to pass&#44; that before they call&#44; I will 
answer&#59; and while they are yet speaking&#44; I will hear. The 
wolf and the lamb shall feed together&#44; and the lion shall eat 
straw like the bullock&#44; and dust shall be the serpent&#39;s food. 
They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain&#44; saith 
the Lord.&#34; Ibid. lxv. 24&#44; 25. 

&#34;And he shall judge among many people&#44; and rebuke 
strong nations afar oif&#59; and they shall beat their swords into 
ploughshares&#44; and their spears into pruning&#8211;hooks &#59; nation 
shall not lift up the sword against nation&#44; nor shall they learn 
war any more. But they shall sit every man under his vine 
and under his fig&#8211;tree&#44; and none shall make them afraid &#59; for 
the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it.&#34; Micah iv. o&#44; 4. 

12. Give me some reasons and extracts from Scripture to prove 
that the religion of the Bible shall be the universal religion. 

To judge from probability alone&#44; we should say&#8211; 
that the law made known at Sinai would be the law 
of all the world at the time of the Divine rule on 
earth. For in the Lord there is no change of pur&#8211; 
pose&#44; no want of firmness&#59; and what He therefore 

&#42; This paragraph has been given at unusual length&#44; in order to give the 
whole doctrine at one view. If considered best it might be merely read to 
the class without getting it by heart.

declares to be right at one time must be so always. 
But Scripture actually declares that our religion&#44; at 
least a&#8211; part thereof&#44; shall be the sole law and reli&#8211; 
gion of all men &#59; and it is this chiefly which will 
make the time of the Messiah the period of universal 
blessing and peace. 

&#34;And it shall come to pass in tbe last days&#44; that the moun&#8211; 
tain of the house of the Lord shall be established at the top 
of the mountains&#44; and it shall be exalted above the hills&#44; aud 
all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and 
say&#44; Come ye&#44; and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord&#44; 
to the house of the God of Jacob&#59; and he shall teach us of 
his ways&#44; and we will walk in his paths &#59; for out of Zion shall 
go forth the law&#44; and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem&#47;&#39; 
Isaiah ii. 3&#44; 4. 

&#34;And the Lord alone shall be exalted on that day. And 
the idols He shall utterly abolish.&#34; Ibid. 17&#44; 18. 

&#34;And it shall come to pass&#44; that every one that is left of all 
the nations which came against Jerusalem shall go up from 
year to year to worship the King&#44; the Lord of hosts&#44; and to 
keep the feast of tabernacles.&#34; Zech. xiv. 16. 

13. &#34;When is the time of the Messiah&#63; 

The prophets speak of the time as surely coming&#44; 
but have not given us sufficient means to fix the pre&#8211; 
cise period &#59; the day is known to the Lord alone &#59; but 
it is in our power to hasten its coming&#44; through vir&#8211; 
tue and the fear of the Lord. But if even we should 
persevere in our wickedness and be undeserving&#58; 
still God will bring about the fulfilment of his word 
at the time beyond which the redemption of the 
world is not to be delayed. 

&#34;Thus saith the Lord&#44; Keep ye judgment&#44; and do justice&#59; 
for my salvation is near to come&#44; and my righteousness to be 
revealed. Blessed is the man that doth this&#44; and the son of 
man that layeth hold on it &#59; that keepeth the Sabbath from 
polluting it&#44; and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.&#34; 
Isaiah lvi. 1&#44; 2. 

&#34;I the Lord will hasten it in its time.&#34; Ibid. lx. 22. 

&#34; Therefore say unto the house oi&#39; Israel&#44; Thus saith the 
Lord God&#44; Not for your sake do I this&#44; house of Israel&#44; but

for the sake of my holy name which ye have profaned among 
the nations whither ye went.&#34; Ezek. xxxvi. 22. 

&#34; But it shall be one day&#44; which is known only to the Lord&#44; 
not day nor night&#59; but it shall come to pass&#44; that at evening&#8211; 
time it shall be light.&#34; Zech. xiv. 7. 

14. But tell me&#44; how are we to recognise the time when it does 
arrive&#63; how are we to guard against imposition by designing 
men&#44; who may assume falsely the dignity of Messiah&#63; 

Whenever all the signs given by the prophets take 
place&#44; and all the predictions are accomplished&#44; then&#44; 
and only then&#44; has the Messiah actually come &#59; and 
the person who is gifted with the spirit of God as 
laid down by Isaiah will be known as the true 
anointed &#59; for so it was with Moses&#44; whom all the 
people believed to be the prophet of the Lord&#44; be&#8211; 
cause he fulfilled the message with which he was 
sent. But the time of the Messiah will also be farther 
distinguished by the previous coming of Elijah the 
prophet&#44; who will prepare the way for the renovation 
of mankind. 

&#34; Behold&#44; I will send my messenger&#44; and he shall prepare 
the way before me &#59; and the Lord&#44; whom ye seek&#44; shall sud&#8211; 
denly come to his temple &#59; and the messenger of the covenant 
whom ye delight in&#44; behold&#44; he cometh&#44; saith the Lord of 
hosts.&#34; Malachi iii. 1. 

&#34; Behold&#44; I will send you Elijah the prophet&#44; before the 
coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord &#59; and he 
shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children&#44; and the 
heart of the children to their fathers.&#34; Ibid. 23&#44; 24.&#42; 

&#42; As the doctrine of the Messiah has been hut briefly given in the text&#44; 
the teacher would do well to read at least some of the Bible&#8211;passages quoted 
more at length from the Bible&#44; in order to give the scholar a more complete 
idea than the limits of a work like this permit.

THE LIFE AFTER DEATH. 105 



CHAPTER IX. 

THE LIFE AFTER DEATH. 

1. What is the third article of the Jewish Faith&#63; 

I believe firmly and truly&#44; that the Lord God has 
made the soul which He has placed within me a 
spirit like himself&#44; and it is therefore not mortal&#59; 
but that He will call me anew into life after the dis&#8211; 
solution of the body&#44; and restore me again&#44; after 
death shall have severed the connexion between the 
flesh and the spirit&#44; and the grave shall have received 
the part of me which is of the earth &#59; farther&#44; that 
He will judge me after my departure out of this 
life&#44; according to the good or evil which I may have 
done on earth &#59; reward me with inexpressible happi&#8211; 
ness and grant me everlasting life&#44; free from pain 
and sorrow&#44; if I have merited his favour &#59; but punish 
me according to his wisdom and justice&#44; if I have 
been forgetful of his law and followed the evil incli&#8211; 
nation of my heart. 

2. How do you classify what you have been saying&#63; 

Into the resurrection of the dead&#44; and reward 
and punishment after death. 

3. Why do you think that there does exist a reward and 
punishment after death &#63; 

Because&#44; in viewing with attention the present 
state of the world&#44; we often see that the virtuous are 
poor&#44; oppressed&#44; and suffering&#44; whilst the wicked are 
wealthy&#44; prosperous&#44; and powerful. Could therefore 
the good have no farther hope than here on earth&#44; 
there would evidently be injustice in the holy One 
above&#44; in whom there is no evil or perversion of jus&#8211; 
tice&#44; but all whose ways are just and true. I there&#8211; 
fore must believe that there will be a state after this&#44; 

                <pb n="106"/>

106 THE LIFE AFTER DEATH. 

where the just will meet their reward&#44; and where the 
wicked will receive their deserved punishment. 

&#34; There is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness&#44; 
and there is a wicked man that liveth long in his wickedness. &#34; 
Eccles. vii. 15. 

&#34; Because sentence is not executed speedily against deeds 
of evil&#44; therefore the heart of the sons of man becometh care&#8211; 
less in them to do evil. But let the sinner do evil a hundred&#8211; 
fold&#44; and God withhold long his anger from him &#58; yet am I 
convinced that it will be well with them that fear God&#44; whilst 
they fear Him. But it shall not be well with the wicked&#59; 
and like the shadow he shall not prolong his days&#44; because he 
feareth not before God&#47;&#39; Ibid. viii. 11&#8212;13. 

4. &#34;What do we derive from this article of our Faith&#63; 

We should persevere in doing good&#44; and be zeal&#8211; 
ous in the discharge of the duties which our Maker 
demands of us&#44; and endeavour to practise virtue&#44; 
even if no man will approve of our conduct. It 
should be satisfaction enough for us to know that 
God watches all our actions&#44; and that He will care&#8211; 
fully weigh them and give to us all the reward which 
we deserve&#44; and always show us mercy far above 
what our little merit can with justice lay claim to. 

&#34; And unto Thee&#44; Lord &#33; belongeth mercy&#59; for Thou wilt 
render unto every man according to his deeds&#47;&#39; Ps. lxii. 13. 

&#34; For every deed will God bring into judgment&#44; with every 
secret thing&#44; whether it be good or evil.&#34; Eccles. xii. 14. 

5. Bat suppose&#44; as you said just now&#44; that virtue be not re&#8211; 
warded at once &#58; where is then the foundation of your hope of 
ultimate justice &#63; 

If the life of the soul were limited to its existence 
on earth&#44; then indeed would we have cause to de&#8211; 
spair of happiness&#44; if we take riches&#44; honour and 
power as the chief objects of our being here. But 
there are joys&#44; even on earth&#44; beyond the things 
which men so much desire to possess &#59; and a man 
poor&#44; unhonoured&#44; and subject to the will of others&#44; 
can be happier than those who rule over him&#44; pro&#8211;

vided he be content with his lot&#44; and obedient to the 
will of God. 

&#34; Better is a little with righteousness&#44; than great revenues 
without right.&#34; Prov. xvi. 8. 

6. This idea is correctly expressed&#58; please to continue. 

It is thus that we can learn to be content with 
whatever we receive&#44; if we but consider that it is the 
will of God which gives us our portion on earth &#59; 
and He therefore must think that we are better as 
we actually are&#44; than we could be under different 
circumstances. But if we look farther into ourselves&#44; 
and reflect that our soul is immortal&#44; that it is the 
undying image of the holy One within ourselves&#58; 
then indeed have we cause for joyful hope &#59; because 
in the life after this the pleasures imparted by divine 
grace far outweigh all the joys which can be sent us 
here &#59; for they are like our future existence&#44; undying&#44; 
unchanging&#44; coming directly from God&#44; and all de&#8211; 
pending on his favour&#59; and the righteous will enjoy 
them without fear&#44; without being disturbed by the 
wicked&#44; who then cease from troubling&#44; whilst the 
weary pious ones are at rest. 

&#34;My heart therefore is glad&#44; and my glory rejoiceth&#59; my 
flesh also shall rest in safety. For Thou wilt not abandon my 
soul to hell&#44; neither wilt Thou suffer thy pious servant to see 
corruption.&#34; Ps. xvi. 9&#44; 10. 

&#34;There the wicked cease from troubling&#44; and there the 
weary are at rest. Together repose in peace chained prisoners&#44; 
they hear not the task&#8211;master&#39;s voice. The small and the 
great are there &#59; the servant too&#44; now free from his master&#47;&#39; 
Job hi. 17&#8211;19. 

7. Are you convinced of the truth of this belief&#63; 

Yes &#59; for both reason and religion unite to de&#8211; 
monstrate the immortality of the soul. 

8. How does Reason alone prove it&#63; 

God is the most beneficent of beings &#59; all his in&#8211; 
tentions are pure and never fail to effect a good end. 
We see&#44; however&#44; that this life is short&#44; and is con&#8211;

stantly exposed to be ended by death&#44; arising from 
accidents&#44; sickness&#44; or the violence of wicked men&#59; 
besides this&#44; whilst we live&#44; Ave have to submit to 
sorrow and suffering of every kind&#59; and no man&#44; 
if ever so great&#44; can escape these sorrows&#44; nor the 
death which awaits all. We therefore must judge 
that we were not created for this state of being 
alone &#59; but that another&#44; and a better&#44; and a happier&#44; 
and a more durable life awaits us&#44; when our present 
state of existence has passed away&#44; and our body 
has been laid to rest in the grave. 

&#34; The days of the years of our life therein are seventy years&#59; 
and if by extraordinary vigour we see eighty years &#58; yet is their 
essence labour and sorrow&#59; for our life is soon cut off&#44; and we 
flee away. &#8212; satisfy us early with thy mercy&#44; that we may 
rejoice and be glad all our days.&#34; Ps. xc. 10&#8211;14. 

9. How does Religion teach the same &#63; 

The holy Scriptures teach us that God has created 
man in his image &#59; the body of man we know to be 
mortal&#44; and&#44; unlike the being of God&#44; it is subject to 
decay&#44; sorrow&#44; and death &#59; but the true divine image 
is the soul&#44; which has reason&#44; and is spiritual&#44; and 
enables us like Him to judge between right and 
wrong&#44; though at an immeasurable distance and 
with the greatest difference between the creatures 
and the Creator&#59; and this spirit therefore must be 
like the great Spirit&#44; undying and incorruptible. 

&#34; For this God is our God for ever and ever. He will guide 
us even beyond death. &#34; Ps. xlviii. 15. 

10. What is death&#63; 

Death is the separation of the soul from the body&#44; 
of the spirit from matter &#59; by it the body is rendered 
no longer fit for service&#44; but is made immovable and 
corrupt &#59; and the spirit is set free to return to the 
presence of the Creator. 

&#34; In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread&#44; till thou 
return unto the ground&#59; for out of it wast thou taken&#59; for dust 
thou art&#44; and unto dust shalt thou return.&#34; Gen. iii. 19.

THE LIFE AFTER DEATH. 109 

&#34; Then shall the dust return to the earth&#44; as it was &#59; and 
trie spirit shall return unto God who gave it.&#34; Eccles. xii. 7 

11. How should we therefore look upon this state of bein&#44;L&#39;&#63; 

This life is but a preparation for the life everlast&#8211; 
ing&#59; this is the time for action and labour&#44; that&#44; the 
period of enjoyment and repose. Thus also teach 
our wise men in their Proverbs of the Fathers &#58; 
&#34;Prepare thyself in the outer hall&#44; that thou mayest 
be worthy to enter the palace.&#34; 

12. What actions and labours are they which will fit us te 
enter the palace of God &#63; 

Not the pursuit of wealth&#44; and fame&#44; and power&#44; 
for they&#44; like our life&#44; must soon pass away &#59; but the 
riches of the soul are the knowledge and the fear of 
God&#44; the sincere and humble pursuit of his law of 
truth&#59; for such conduct will always give peace to 
the mind&#44; and will leave fruits which will&#44; like the 
everlasting life of the righteous&#44; be always undying&#44; 
never ending. 

&#34; Thus saith the Lord&#44; Let not the wise man glory in his 
wisdom&#59; neither let the mighty man glory in his might&#59; let 
not the rich man glory in his riches &#59; but let him that glorieth 
o&#8211;lory in this&#44; that he understandeth and knoweth me&#44; that I 
am the Lord&#44; who exercise loving&#8211;kindness&#44; judgment&#44; and 
righteousness on the earth &#59; for in these things I delight&#44; saith 
the Lord.&#34; Jer. ix. 22&#44; 23. 

13. Is the other world preferable to this&#63; 

Yes &#59; because there are the everlasting life in God&#44; 
and the permanent happiness. For the righteous&#44; 
when their labour on earth is done&#44; return to the 
Lord where their souls are to dwell for ever&#44; enjoy&#8211; 
ing the delights and blessing which their obedience 
has obtained for them from their Maker. 

&#34;Thou wilt show me the path of life&#59; in thy presence is 
the fulness of joy&#59; at thy right hand are everlasting plea&#8211; 
sures.&#34; Ps. xvi. 11. 

14. Is it therefore right to grieve unbecomingly long for the 
death of a friend &#63; 

                <pb n="110"/>

110 THE LIFE AFTER DEATH. 

&#34;No &#59; whenever any of our friends are taken from 
us by death&#44; we should reflect that it is the Lord who 
thought proper to afflict us in this manner&#44; and that 
to his decree it is our duty to submit with fortitude 
and resignation. Farther&#44; that sooner or later we 
ourselves must follow them&#44; and that the grave will 
receive our bodies likewise &#58; the same lot awaits all 
men. Whilst&#44; therefore&#44; it is but proper to feel 
deeply our loss&#44; we should bear it as becomes the 
servants of the Most High&#44; who know that they are 
always in his power and care&#44; whether in life or in 
death. But rather than grieve inordinately it should 
be the means of making us reflect upon our conduct&#44; 
and of inducing us to look upon it as a warning 
sent from God&#44; that we may return to Him with 
sincere repentance&#44; and thus stay the anger which 
might be poured over us if we continue obstinate 
and sinning. 

&#34;What man is he that liveth&#44; and shall not see death&#63; 
shall deliver his soul from the power of the grave &#63;&#34; Ps. 
lxxxix. 49. 

15. What else do we learn from the nature of life and death &#63; 
Every thing earthly is vain and perishable &#59; riches 

will not assist us on the day of wrath&#44; but virtue 
alone will save us from condemnation. 

&#34;When thou goest&#44; it shall lead thee&#44; when thou sleepest&#44; it 
shall keep thee&#44; and when thou awakest&#44; it shall talk with 
thee.&#34; Prov. vi. 22. 

&#34; Vanity of vanities&#44; saith the preacher&#44; vanity of vanities&#44; 
all is vanity.&#34; Eccles. i. 2. 

16. What do you understand by &#34;the day of wrath&#63;&#34; 

The great day of the Lord&#44; or the day of the uni&#8211; 
versal resurrection of the dead. 

17. What is the Resurrection&#63; 

The reunion of the souls of the departed with 
their bodies. 

&#34; Thy dead men shall live&#44; together with my dead body 
shall they arise Awake&#44; and sing&#44; ye that dwell in the dust &#36;

THE LIFE AFTER DEATH. 111



for thy dew is as the dew of herbs&#59; and the earth shall cast 
forth the dead.&#34; Isa. xxvi. 19. 

« Then he said unto me&#44; Son of man&#44; these bones are .he 
whole house of Israel&#59; behold they say&#44; Our bones are dried&#44; 
and our hope is lost&#44; wo are entirely cut off. Therefore pro&#8211; 
phet and say unto them&#44; Thus saith the Lord God&#44; Behold&#44; 
my people&#44; I will open your graves&#44; and cause you to come 
up out of your graves&#44; and bring you into the land of Israel. 
And ve shall know that I am the Lord&#44; when I have opened 
your graves&#44; my people&#44; and brought you up out of your 
graves And I will put my spirit in you and ye shall live&#44; 
and I will place you in your own land &#58; then shall ye know 
that I the Lord have spoken it&#44; and performed it&#44; saitn the 
Lord.&#34; Ezek. xxxvii. 11&#8211;14. 

18 Why do you call this great period the &#34; day of wrath &#63;&#34; 

Because at the time of the resurrection the Lord 
God will hold judgment over all the children ot 
man&#44; and award to each eternal reward or punish&#8211; 
ment according to his good or evil deeds. 

&#34;For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one 
that is proud and lofty&#44; and upon every one that is lifted up 
and he shall be brought low.&#8211; And the loftiness of man shall 
be bowed down&#44; and the haughtiness of men shall be made 
low&#44; and the Lord alone shall be exalted on that day. Isa. 

U &#39; &#34;Therefore wait ye for me&#44; saith the Lord&#44; until the day 
that 1 rise up to the prey&#59; for my determination is to gather 
the nations&#44; that I may assemble the kingdoms&#44; to pour upon 
them my indignation&#44; all my fierce anger &#59; for with the fire of 
my jealousy all the earth shall be devoured Zeph. m. 8 

&#34;For&#44; behold&#44; the day cometh that shall burn as an oven&#44; 
and all the proud&#44; yea&#44; and all that do wickedly&#44; shall be 
stubble&#58; and the day that cometh shall burn them up&#44; saith 
the Lord of host&#44;&#44; that it shall not leave them root or branch. 
But unto you that fear my name shall the sun righteousness 
arise with healing in his wings&#47; Mai. in. 1 J&#44; &#8211;U. 

&#34;And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth 
shall awake&#44; some to everlasting life&#44; and some to shame and 
everlasting contempt. And they that are wise shall shine as 
lit brightness of the expanse&#59; and they that turn many to 
righteousness&#44; as the stars for ever and ever. Dan. xn. &#42; 6.

112 THE LIFE AFTER DEATH. 

19. Do you mean to say that any person will be punished 
everlastingly &#63; 

There are some who deserve everlasting condem&#8211; 
nation &#59; and they are those who&#44; knowing the law 
of God&#44; reject it scornfully&#44; and&#44; so to say&#44; rebel 
against the Lord&#44; and die without repentance. Such 
persons cannot hope to receive that pardon whh&#59;h 
we are taught will be extended to those who have 
sinned by being misled by worldly desires and en&#8211; 
ticements&#44; and who in this life return with sincere 
repentance to the Most High. For these last the 
prayers of the living&#44; we trust&#44; will be of avail &#59; but 
for the first there is no hope save the undeserved 
mercy of God. 

&#34; The Lord killeth and maketh alive&#44; He bringeth down to 
the grave&#44; and bringeth up.&#34; 1 8am. ii. 6. 

&#34; And they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the 
men that have transgressed &#40;wilfully&#41; against me &#59; for their 
worm shall not die&#44; neither shall their fire be quenched&#44; and 
they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.&#34; Isaiah lxvi. 24. 

&#34; Behold all souls are mine j as the soul of the father&#44; so 
also the soul of the son is mine&#44; the soul that sinneth&#44; that 
alone shall die.&#34; Ezek. xviii. 4. 

&#34;Again&#44; when the wicked man turneth away from his 
wickedness that he hath committed&#44; and doth that which is 
lawful and right&#44; he shall save his soul alive. Ibid. 27. 

20. When is the time of the Resurrection &#63; 

This has not been made known to us &#59; but we are 
given to understand that the resurrection of the dead 
is connected with the kingdom of the Messiah&#44; and 
will not take place till this has first been established. 

&#34;And he said&#44; Go thy way&#44; Daniel&#59; for the words are 
closed up and sealed till the time of the end. Many shall be 
purified&#44; and made white&#44; and tried j but the wicked will do 
wickedly &#59; and none of the wicked shall understand &#59; but the 
wise shall understand. &#8212; Blessed is he that waiteth&#44; and cometh 
to the thousand three hundred and thirty&#8211;five days. But go 
thou thy way till the end be j for thou shalt rest&#44; and stand 
in thy lot at the end of the days&#47;&#39; Dan. xii. 9&#8211;13. 

                <pb n="113"/>

THE LIFE AFTER DEATH. 113 

21. What changes will take place in those days &#63; 
Scripture teaches us that the present form of the 

earth and of the universe will pass away&#44; and that a 
better form&#44; and one better suited to the altered state 
of man&#44; will take its place. 

&#34; For as the new heavens and the new earth&#44; which I will 
make&#44; shall remain before me&#44; saith the Lord&#44; so shall your 
seed and your name remain.&#34; Isaiah Ixvi. 22. 

&#34; The great day of the Lord is near&#44; it is near&#44; and hasteth 
greatly&#44; even the voice of the day of the Lord j bitterly shall 
cry there the mighty man. That day is a day of wrath&#44; a day 
of trouble and distress&#44; a day of wasting and desolation&#44; a day 
of darkness and gloom&#44; a day of clouds and thick darkness. 
A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities&#44; 
and against the high towers. Neither their silver nor their 
gold shall be able to deliver them on the day of the Lord&#39;s 
wrath &#59; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his 
jealousy&#59; for He will make even a speedy riddance of all 
them that dwell on the earth.&#34; Zeph. i. 14&#8211;18. 

22. What will then be the condition of the good&#63; 

The pious ones&#44; they who feared God&#44; will receive 
an everlasting happy life in the Lord &#59; and they will 
enjoy heavenly delight and unceasing pleasures&#44; and 
dwell with Him in the utmost purity of the spirit&#44; 
and in entire love and faith. 

&#34; Yet in righteousness shall I behold thy face&#44; and be satis&#8211; 
fied at awakening from contemplating thy countenance.&#34; Ps. 
xvii. 15. 

23. What will be the state of the ungodly &#63; 

Those who have forsaken their Maker will be con&#8211; 
demned to utter darkness&#44; and will be excluded from 
the communion of the righteous&#44; who&#44; as said&#44; will 
be united to the Lord. 

&#34; Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in judgment&#44; nor 
sinners in the congregation of the righteous.&#34; Ps. i. 5. 

&#34; As wax melteth before the fire&#44; so may the wicked perish 
at the presence of Grod. But the righteous shall exult&#44; they 
shall rejoice before God&#59; yea&#44; they shall be exceedingly joy&#8211; 
ful.&#34; Ibid&#44; lxviii 3&#44; 4.

114 REPENTANCE AND ATONEMENT. 

24. Have we any distinct idea of the nature of the reward and 
punishment after death and at the resurrection &#63; 

No &#59; we can form no clear idea of the state of the 
spirit unconnected with the body &#59; but we have 
every reason to suppose that the reward as well as 
the punishment will be essentially spiritual&#44; unlike 
any bodily joy or sorrow&#58; still&#44; the extent and nature 
of both are known to God alone&#44; for no human eye 
has ever seen the reward which &#34;He treasures up 
for those who wait upon Him&#34; with hope and de&#8211; 
voted faith. 



CHAPTER X. 

REPENTANCE AND ATONEMENT. 

1. By what means can the sinner escape the punishment due 
to his sins &#63; 

By conversion&#44; a change of conduct&#44; and repent&#8211; 
ance. 

&#34; Gather yourselves together&#44; and search your ways&#44; 
unwilling nation &#33; before the decree go forth&#44; before your day 
pass away as the chaff&#44; before the fierce anger of the Lord 
come upon you&#44; before the day of the Lord&#39;s anger come upon 
you. Seek ye the Lord&#44; all ye meek of the earth&#44; who have 
wrought his judgment&#59; seek righteousness&#44; seek meekness&#59; 
that ye may perhaps be hidden on the day of the Lord&#39;s 
anger.&#34; Zeph. ii. 1&#8211;3. 

2. What do you call &#39;&#39;Conversion&#63;&#34; 

If the sinner separates himself from his sin and 
returns to the service of the Lord&#59; this he does 
when he heartily abhors his previous bad conduct&#44; 
and accuses himself sincerely of the wrong he has 
done&#44; and resolves to be pious and good for the 
future. If he does this&#44; he has well&#8211;founded hopes 

                <pb n="115"/>

REPENTANCE AND ATONEMENT. 115 

that the Lord will let him experience grace&#44; mercy 
and forgiveness. 

&#34; Go&#44; and proclaim these words towards the north&#44; and say&#44; 
Return&#44; thou backsliding Israel&#44; saith the Lord&#44; and I will 
not cause my anger to fall upon you &#59; for I am merciful&#44; saith 
the Lord&#44; and I will not keep anger for ever. Only acknow&#8211; 
ledge thy iniquity&#44; that thou hast transgressed against the 
Lord thy God&#47;&#39; Jer. iii. 12&#44; 13. 

&#34; Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die &#63; 
saith the Lord God &#59; but truly&#44; that he should return from his 
ways and live.&#34; Ezek. xviii. 23. 

3. How can we repent &#63; 

First. By sincere regret for past misconduct&#59; that 
is&#44; awakening the soul to the effects of sin. 

&#34; Seek ye the Lord while He may be found&#44; call ye upon 
Him while He is near. Let the wicked forsake his way&#44; and 
the unrighteous man his thoughts &#59; let him return unto the 
Lord and He will have mercy upon him&#59; and to our God&#44; for 
He will abundantly pardon.&#34; Isaiah lv. 6&#44; 7. 

Secondly. By prayer &#59; that is&#44; humbling the heart to 
our Maker. 

&#34;If they sin against Thee &#40;for there is no man that sinneth 
not&#41;&#44; and Thou be angry with them&#44; and deliver them to the 
enemy&#44; so that they carry them away captives unto the land 
of the enemy&#44; far or near&#59; yet if they shall bethink them&#8211; 
selves in the land whither they were carried captives&#44; and re&#8211; 
pent&#44; and make supplication unto Thee in the land of them 
that carried them captive&#44; saying&#44; We have sinned&#44; and have 
done perversely&#44; we have committed wickedness&#59; and so return 
unto Thee with all their heart&#44; and with all their soul&#44; in the 
land of their enemies that led them away captive&#44; and pray 
unto Thee towards their land which Thou gavest unto their 
fathers&#44; the city which Thou hast chosen&#44; and the house which 
I have built for thy name &#58; then hear Thou their prayer and 
their supplication in heaven thy dwelling&#8211;place&#44; and maintain 
their cause&#44; and forgive thy people that have sinned against 
Thee&#44; and all their transgressions wherein they have trans&#8211; 
gressed against Thee&#44; and give them compassion before them 
that carried them captive&#44; that they may have compassion on 



them.&#34; 1 Kings viii. 46&#8211;50 



11&#42; 

                <pb n="116"/>

116 REPENTANCE AND ATONEMENT. 

Thirdly. Through pious deeds &#59; that is&#44; obedience 
to the will of God. 

&#34; But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath 
committed&#44; and keep all my statutes&#44; and do that which is law&#8211; 
ful and right&#44; he shall surely live&#44; he shall not die. All his 
transgressions that he hath committed shall not be remembered 
unto him &#58; in his righteousness that he hath done shall he 
live.&#34; Ezek. xviii. 21&#44; 22. 

4. In what way is regret a part of penitence &#63; 

Because regret for misconduct is the sorrow and 
affliction of the soul which recognises and acknow&#8211; 
ledges her past sins&#44; and feels anxious to enter again 
into the peace of God&#44; which her former wrongs 
have deprived her of. Besides this&#44; without peni&#8211; 
tential regret for the wrong&#44; and detestation of our 
sins&#44; no amendment of the heart can take place&#44; and 
this it is which is demanded of us if we wish to be 
forgiven. 

&#34; Be gracious unto me&#44; God &#33; according to thy loving&#8211; 
kindness &#41; according to the abundance of thy tender mercies 
blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my 
iniquity&#44; and cleanse me from my sin. For I am sensible of 
my transgressions&#44; and my sin is ever before me. Against 
Thee&#44; who art God alone &#33; have I sinned&#44; and done the evil in 
thy sight.&#34; Ps. li. 3&#8211;6. 

5. How is such regret to be shown&#63; 

E&#34;ot so much by outward tokens of sorrow&#44; as by 
a contrition of the soul that feels her errors and 
humbles herself sincerely before the Lord. Never&#8211; 
theless&#44; external humbling&#44; such as leaving off orna&#8211; 
ments and outward exhibitions of wealth&#44; fasting 
and acts of charity&#44; are also very useful &#59; as by this 
means we tear ourselves away from the allurements 
and pleasures of a perishable life&#44; and seek protec&#8211; 
tion from Him who is alone able to forgive&#44; and 
whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. 

&#34; Therefore also now&#44; saith the Lord&#44; return ye to me with 
all your heart&#44; and with fasting&#44; and with weeping&#44; and with 

                <pb n="117"/>

REPENTANCE AND ATONEMENT. 117 

mourning&#59; and rend your heart and not your garments&#44; and 
return unto the Lord your God &#59; for He is gracious and mer&#8211; 
ciful&#44; slow to anger&#44; and of great kindness&#44; and repenteth of 
the evil.&#34; Joel ii. 12&#44; 13. 

&#34; The sacrifices of the Lord are a broken spirit&#58; a broken 
and contrite heart&#44; God &#33; Thou wilt not despise.&#34; Ps. Ii. 19. 

6. How does prayer form a part of repentance&#63; 

Because by prayer we are to make with our own 
lips an acknowledgment of the wrong we have done&#44; 
and to promise a better course of life for the future. 
It is therefore the expression of what the heart feels&#44; 
when we sincerely repent. It brings accordingly 
the evil of our conduct nearer to our soul &#59; and by 
speaking as it were in the presence of the Lord of 
our wrong&#44; and asking his forgiveness&#44; relying at the 
same time upon his mercy to atone for our sins&#44; we 
must become more impressed&#44; and feel more strongly&#44; 
that it is necessary for us to be more obedient for the 
future&#44; if we would in the least degree deserve the 
favour of God. 

&#34; When I was silent concerning my sins&#44; my bones wasted 
away&#44; from my cries all the day. &#8212; Therefore did I confess my 
sin to Thee&#44; and would not hide my iniquity&#59; I said&#44; I will 
confess my transgression to the Lord&#44; and Thou didst forgive 
the iniquity of my sins.&#34; Ps. xxxii. 3&#8211;5. 

&#34;I beseech Thee&#44; Lord God of heaven&#44; the great and 
terrible God&#44; that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that 
love Him&#44; and observe his commandments &#58; let thy ear be now 
attentive&#44; and thy eyes open&#44; that Thou mayest hear the prayer 
of thy servant&#44; which I pray before Thee now&#44; day and night&#44; 
for the children of Israel thy servants&#44; and confess the sins of 
the children of Israel&#44; which we have sinned against Thee &#59; 
for both I and my father&#39;s house have sinned. We have dealt 
very corruptly against Thee&#44; and have not kept the command&#8211; 
ments&#44; nor the statutes&#44; nor the judgments&#44; which thou com&#8211; 
mandedst thy servant Moses. &#8212; Lord&#44; I beseech Thee&#44; let 
now thy ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant&#44; and to 
the prayer of thy servants&#44; who desire to fear thy name &#59; and 
prosper&#44; I pray thee&#44; thy servant this day&#44; aud anjiin 
aiercy in the sight of this man.&#34; Neh. i. 5&#8211;11. ^ 4fc>

7. Which is the last means of repentance&#63; 

Pious and godly acts are the last means of per 
fecting the reformation and repentance commenced 
by sincere regret&#44; assisted by prayer and penance. 
For prayer and fasting&#44; although otherwise essential&#44; 
avai&#34; nothing&#44; if they do not induce us to lead a 
better and truly reformed life. 

&#34;Your new&#8211;moons and your appointed feasts my soul 
hateth &#59; they are a trouble unto me &#59; I am weary to bear 
them. And when ye spread forth your hands&#44; I will hide my 
eyes from you &#59; yea&#44; when ye make many prayers I will not 
hear &#58; your hands are full of blood. Wash yourselves&#44; make 
yourselves clean &#59; put away the evil of your doings from before 
my eyes&#59; cease to do evil.&#34; Isaiah i. 14&#8211;16. 

8. What is to be the effect of repentance upon man &#63; 

First. Repentance shall effect a reformation and 
amendment of our course of life. 

&#34; Learn to do well &#59; seek judgment&#44; relieve the oppressed&#44; 
judge the fatherless&#44; plead for the widow. Come now and let 
us reason together&#44; saith the Lord &#58; Though your sins be as 
scarlet&#44; they shall be as white as snow &#59; though they be red 
like crimson&#44; they shall be as wool.&#34; Ibid. 17&#44; 18. 

Secondly. Repentance shall purify our heart from 
sin&#44; and restore our soul to the purity she possessed 
before transgression&#44; in order to make us fit again 
for the kingdom of the Lord&#44; who is pure and holy. 

&#34; Cast away from you all your transgressions&#44; whereby ye 
have transgressed&#44; and make yourselves a new heart and a new 
spirit&#59; for why will ye die&#44; house of Israel&#63; For I have 
no pleasure in the death of him that deserveth to die&#44; saith 
the Lord God&#58; therefore return and live.&#34; Ezek. xviii. 31&#44; 32. 

Thirdly. Repentance shall gain for us anew the 
grace and mercy of our heavenly Father&#44; which we 
have lost by our sins. 

&#34;Hide thy face from my sins&#44; and blot out all my iniqui&#8211; 
ties Create me a pure heart&#44; God&#44; and renew the spirit of 
rectitude within me. Cast me not out from thy presence &#59; nor 
take from me thy holy spirit. Restore me the joy of thy sal&#8211; 
vation j and support me with thy liberal spirit.&#34; Ps. li. 11&#8211;14

REPENTANCE AND ATONEMENT. 119 

9. Is there not one day in the year devoted to universal repent&#8211; 
ance in Israel &#63; 

Yes &#59; the tenth day of the seventh month&#44; Tishiy&#44; 
has been appointed by the Lord as the day of gene&#8211; 
ral atonement for our sins. Therefore it is called 
Yome Kippwim&#44; Day of Atonement. 

&#34;And the Lord spoke unto Moses&#44; Baying&#44; Also on the tenth 
day of this seventh month&#44; there shall be a day of atonement&#44; 
it shall be a holy convocation unto you&#44; and ye shall fast. &#8212; ■ 
And ye shall do no work on that same day&#59; for it is a day of 
atonement&#44; to make an atonement for you before the Lord your 
God.&#34; Lev. xxiii. 26&#8211;28. 

10. What is the object of this day&#63; 

We shall abstain on this day from all carnal en&#8211; 
joyments&#44; to live in spiritual communion with the 
Lord &#59; that is to say&#44; we are not to eat&#44; drink&#44; or do 
any thing by which the body can be pleased &#59; it is to 
be a day of entire abstinence devoted alone to the 
service of the Lord &#59; and we shall sanctify ourselves 
then by a sincere repentance&#44; and resolve to sin no 
more as we have sinned. 

&#34; Ye shall do no manner of work &#59; it shall be a statute for 
ever&#44; throughout your generations in all your dwellings. It 
shall be unto you a Sabbath of rest&#44; and ye shall fast j on the 
ninth day of the month at even shall ye begin &#59; from even 
unto even shall you celebrate your Sabbath.&#34; Ibid. 31&#44; 32. 

11. Are all sins pardoned on that day&#63; 

ISTo&#59; those sins alone which we have committed 
against God will be forgiven on that day&#44; if we sin&#8211; 
cerely repent. 

&#34; For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for 
you&#44; to cleanse you&#44; that ye may be clean from all your sins 
before the Lord.&#34; Ibid. xvi. 30. 

12. Which are the sins for which this day is no atonement &#63; 

Those sins which have been committed against 
our fellow&#8211;men &#59; as these cannot be forgiven unless 
we have satisfied those whom we have offended or 
injured. 

                <pb n="120"/>

120 REPENTANCE AND ATONEMENT. 

&#34; For sins between man and G&#8211;od only will the Day of 
Atonement avail &#59; but for sins between a man and his neigh&#8211; 
bour the Day of Atonement will not atone&#44; unless he have 
satisfied his neighbour.&#34; Yoma viii. § 9. 

13. But suppose that the person we have injured be dead&#44; or 
beyond our reach&#44; or unforgiving&#44; and too much addicted to re&#8211; 
vengeful feelings to forgive us &#58; how shall we then do in order to 
obtain forgiveness for our trespasses &#63; 

In all such cases we should be doubly diligent to 
do acts of mercy to those who suffer&#44; and be very 
careful to do nothing against the law of God. If we 
do so&#44; we have well&#8211;founded hopes that the Lord&#44; 
seeing the sincerity of our repentance&#44; will in his 
mercy forgive us&#44; although our injured fellow&#8211;man 
is either unable or unwilling to grant us his pardon 
for the wrong we have done him. 

&#34; Is such then the fast which I choose&#44; a day that a man 
should afflict his soul &#63; when he should bow down his head 
like a bulrush&#44; and spread sackcloth and ashes for his couch &#63; 
shall this be called a fast&#44; and a day acceptable to the Lord &#63; 
Is not this rather the fast which I choose &#63; to dissolve the 
bands of wickedness&#59; to loosen the oppressive burdens&#58; and 
to let the oppressed go free &#59; and that ye should break asunder 
every yoke &#63; Is it not to distribute thy bread to the hungry&#63; 
and to bring the miserably afflicted poor into thy house &#63; when 
thou seest the naked&#44; that thou clothe him&#44; and that thou hide 
not thyself from thy own flesh &#63; Then shall thy light break 
forth like the morning&#8211;dawn j and thy health shall spring forth 
speedily&#59; and thy righteousness shall go before thee&#44; and the 
glory of the Lord shall receive thee. Then shalt thou call&#44; 
and the Lord will answer &#59; thou shalt cry&#44; and He will say&#44; Lo&#44; 
I am here.&#34; Isaiah lviii. 5&#8211;9. 

14. What doctrines can you derive from all we have endea&#8211; 
voured to lay before you &#63; 

First. God has connected the welfare of man with 
virtue&#44; and there can be no real or lasting happiness 
unless our conduct be based upon the knowledge of 
God&#39;s law&#44; and we always act as beings accountable 
to Him and subject to his rule. 

&#34; Who is the man that desireth life&#44; and loveth many days&#44; 

                <pb n="121"/>

REPENTANCE AND ATONEMENT. 121 

that he may see happiness &#63; Keep thy tongue from evil&#44; anC 
thy lips from speaking guile. Depart from evil and do good 
seek peace and pursue it.&#34; Ps. xxxiv. 13&#8211;15. 

Secondly. It depends upon ourselves whether
obtain happiness in this life and in the future state. 
God has given us the choice&#44; and the power of choos&#8211; 
ing likewise &#59; and we are therefore enabled to be 
come happy&#44; and consequently justly deserving sor&#8211; 
row&#44; if we neglect wilfully the good which has been 
placed within our reach. 

&#34; I call heaven and earth to witness this day against you &#58; I 
have set before you life and death&#44; blessing and the curse &#59; but 
do thou choose life&#44; that both thou and thy seed may live.&#34; 
Deut. xxx. 19. 

Thirdly. True fear of God and religious feelings 
are not to be shown through words and professions 
only&#44; but should be displayed by our actions also&#44; &#8212; 
God demands devotion of heart&#44; but likewise deeds 
and active exertions in his service. 

&#34;And I gave them my statutes and made known to them 
my judgments&#44; which if a man do&#44; he shall live in theni.&#34; 
Ezek. xx. 11. 

15. How does David speak concerning this doctrine&#63; 

&#34;Lord&#33; who shall abide in thy tabernacle &#63; who 
shall dwell in thy holy mountain &#63; He that walketh 
uprightly&#44; and worketh righteousness&#44; and speaketh 
the truth in his heart. He that backbiteth not with 
his tongue&#44; doth no evil to his neighbour&#44; nor taketh 
up a reproach against his neighbour. In whose eyes 
the vile is contemned&#44; and who honoureth them that 
fear the Lord &#59; who sweareth to his own hurt and 
ehangeth not&#59; who putteth not out his money to 
usury&#44; and protecteth the innocent without bribe&#58; 
he that doth these things shall not be moved for 
ever.&#34; Amen.

APPENDIX I. 

THE CEREMONIAL LAW. 

1. What is the Ceremonial Law&#63; 

The duties which the law of God as revealed 
through Moses demands of us&#44; the Israelites&#44; in par&#8211;

3. What is the object of the ceremonies&#63; 

The constant observance&#39; of the ceremonies is in&#8211; 
tended to remind us perpetually of the events upon 
which they are founded&#44; and to cause their being 
handed over to our children after us&#44; to the latest 
generations. 

&#34; Remember his miracles that He hath done&#44; his wonders 
and the judgments of his mouth. ye seed of Israel&#44; his 
servants &#59; the children of Jacob&#44; his chosen people. He is 
the Lord our God &#59; his judgments are in all the earth. Re&#8211; 
member ye his covenant for ever &#59; the word which He com&#8211; 
manded to a thousand generations. Which He covenanted 
with Abraham&#44; and likewise his oath unto Isaac. And he 
confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute&#44; to Israel for an 
everlasting covenant.&#34; Ps. cv. 5&#8211;10. 

4. Which are the principal events of which the Ceremonial 
Law is to remind us &#63; 

The following three &#58; 

First The Exodus&#44; or removal&#44; of our forefathers 
from Egypt. 

Second. The Divine Revelation&#44; and the promulga&#8211; 
tion of the Law on Sinai.

and of the kingdom of Israel. 

5. What observances are to remind us of the Exodus&#63; 

First The Sabbath clay&#44; regarded as the sign of 
the covenant of the manifestation of God&#39;s power in 

Egypt. 

&#34;And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of 
Egypt&#44; and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence&#44; 
through a mighty hand&#44; and by an outstretched arm &#58; there&#8211; 
fore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath&#8211; 
day&#47;&#39; Deut. v. 15. 

Second. Several others of the festivals. 

6. Which are these festivals &#63; 

First The Passover&#44; or the Feast of Unleavened 
Bread. 

Secondly. The Feast of Tabernacles. 

7. What is the Passover&#63; 

Seven days every year we are commanded to eat 
unleavened bread&#44; to the exclusion of all ordinary 
bread&#44; or things made of or mixed with corn&#44; in 
memory of the mighty wonders wrought in our 
favour&#44; when we were redeemed from Egypt. 

&#34;Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread&#59; even before 
the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses. &#8212; 
And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread&#59; for on 
this self&#8211;same day have I brought your armies out of the land 
of Egypt &#59; therefore shall ye observe this day&#44; throughout your 
generations&#44; as an ordinance for ever.&#34; Exod. xii. 15&#44; 17. 

8. Which of the seven days are&#44; properly speaking&#44; strict fes&#8211; 
tivals&#44; when no work can be done&#63; 

The first and the seventh &#59; but also the second is 
kept as a clay of abstinence from labour&#44; likewise an 
additional&#44; or eighth day&#59; the same is the case with 
other festivals&#44; at which the Israelites out of Pah 
tine have&#44; for many hundred years&#44; kept an addi&#8211; 
tional day&#44; beyond the period absolutely commanded 
in the law. 

&#34; And on the first day there shall be a holy convocation&#44; 

12 

                <pb n="124"/>

124 APPENDIX I. 

and on the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to 
you &#59; no manner of work shall be done on them&#44; save that 
which every man must eat&#44; that only may be done by you.&#34; 
Exod. xii. 16. 

9. At what time is the Passover to be kept &#63; 

In the first month&#44; or Xissan&#44;&#42; from the fourteenth 
to the twenty&#8211;first day of the month. 

&#34; In the first month&#44; on the fourteenth day of the month at 
even&#44; ye shall eat unleavened bread&#44; until the one and twen&#8211; 
tieth day of the month at even.&#34; Ibid. 18. 

10. What is the Feast of Tabernacles&#63; 

We shall dwell seven days every year in booths&#44; 
tents&#44; or tabernacles&#44; in memory of the going out of 
our forefathers from Egypt&#44; when they sojourned for 
forty } 7 ears in the wilderness of Arabia&#44; and lived in 
temporary dwellings&#44; and not in cities or regularly&#8211; 
built houses. 

&#34; Ye shall dwell in booths seven days &#59; all that are Israelites 
born shall dwell in booths. In order that your generations 
may know&#44; that I made the children of Israel to dwell in 
booths&#44; when I brought them out of the land of Egypt &#58; I am 
the Lord your God.&#34; Lev. xxiii. 42&#44; 43. 

11. At what time is this Feast kept&#63; 

From the fourteenth day of the seventh month&#44; 
Tishry&#44; until the twenty&#8211;second day. The fifteenth 
of the month is the commencement&#44; and the twenty&#8211; 
second the conclusion&#44; of the feast&#44; and both are to 
be devoted to abstinence from labour&#44; and dedicated 
to divine worship and rejoicing at the holy season 
of the Lord. 

&#34;And the Lord spoke unto Moses&#44; as follows&#44; Speak unto 
the children of Israel&#44; saying&#44; The fifteenth day of this seventh 

&#42; The names of the Hebrew months&#44; as now in use&#44; are. the 1st&#44; Nissan&#59;

the usual or civil year&#41; Tishry &#59; 8th&#44; Marheshvan&#44; or Heshvan &#59; 9th&#44; Kislev&#59; 
10th&#44; Tebeth &#59; 11th&#44; Shebat&#59; 12th&#44; Adar&#59; in the leap year&#44; the last&#8211;named 
is called Adar Jteeshon&#44; first Adar&#44; and the 13th month Veadar&#44; Adar 
Sheny&#44; or Second Adar. [See&#44; for farther particulars&#44; Appendix to Instruc&#8211; 
tion in the Mosaic Religion.]

month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto 
the Lord. On the first day shall be a holy convocation &#58; ye 
shall do no servile work thereon. Seven days ye shall offer an 
offering made by fire unto the Lord&#59; on the eighth day shall 
be a holy convocation unto you&#44; and ye shall make an offering 
made by fire unto the Lord &#59; it is a solemn assembly&#44; and ye 
shall do no servile work thereon.&#34; Lev. xxiii. 33&#8211;30. 

12. What other laws are founded upon the going out of Egypt&#63; 

The prohibitions concerning the use of many ani&#8211; 
mals used as food by other men. For by the redemp&#8211; 
tion from Egypt God intended to raise up our nation 
as a people holy to his service&#44; and that we should 
receive the laws which He wished to declare as his 
will&#59; and the prohibitions of certain meats should 
prevent the Israelites from mixing too intimately 
with other nations&#44; and becoming gradually like 
them&#44; forgetful of the law of Heaven. 

&#34; For I am the Lord your God &#58; ye shall therefore sanctify 
yourselves&#44; and be holy&#44; for I am holy&#59; neither shall ye defile 
yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth 
upon the earth. For I am the Lord that bridge th you up out 
of the land of Egypt&#44; to be your God &#59; ye shall therefore be 
holy&#44; for I am holy.&#34; Lev. xi. 44&#44; 45. 

&#34; Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and 
unclean&#59; &#8212; and ye shall be holy unto me&#59; for I the Lord am 
holy&#44; and have separated you from other nations&#44; that you 
should be mine.&#34; Ibid. xx. 25&#44; 26. 

13. What ordinances are founded upon tb&#8211;s Revelation and 
Announcement of the Law on Sinai &#63; 

a. The Pentecost&#44; or Feast of Weeks. 

b. The blowing of the Shophar&#44; and the New Year 

Festival. 

c. The Day of Atonement. 

d. The reading of the Shemang. 

e. The Tephillin. 

&#47;. The Mezoozah &#59; and 
g. The Tzitzith. 

14. What is the Pentecost &#63; 

Seven weeks after the first day of Passover we 

                <pb n="126"/>

126 APPENDIX I. 

shall celebrate a feast in memory of the descent of 
the divine glory&#44; and the public announcement of 
the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai. 

&#34; Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee &#59; from the time 
thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn&#44; begin to number 
the seven weeks. Then shalt thou keep the feast of weeks 
unto the Lord thy God.&#34; Deut. xvi. 9&#44; 10. 

15. When should we celebrate this Feast of Weeks&#63; 

On the sixth day of the third month&#44; or Sivan&#44; 
which day is to be kept holy unto the Lord&#44; by ab&#8211; 
stinence from labour&#44; and consecration to divine 
worship. 

&#34; In the third month after the children of Israel had gone 
forth out of the land of Egypt&#44; the same day they came unto 
the wilderness of Sinai.&#34; Exod. xix. 1. 

16. What is the blowing of the Shophar&#63; 

On the first clay of the seventh month&#44; which is 
the first day of the common or civil year&#44; we shall 
assemble in the houses sacred to the service of the 
Lord&#44; and blow the Shophar &#40;which is a sounding 
instrument made of a ram&#39;s horn&#41;&#44; to commemorate 
the intended sacrifice of Isaac on Mount Moriah&#44; by 
his father Abraham&#44; and resolve on this first day of 
the year to offer up every earthly possession in the 
service of the Lord&#44; if it be required of us&#44; as Abra&#8211; 
ham was willing to sacrifice his only son&#44; because he 
thought it would be pleasing to God. 

&#34;And Abraham lifted up his eyes&#44; and looked&#44; and&#44; behold&#44; 
there was a ram afterward caught in a thicket by his horns&#59; 
and Abraham went&#44; and took the ram&#44; and offered him up for 
a burnt&#8211;offering&#44; in the stead of his son.&#34; Gen. xxii. 13. 

&#34;And in the seventh month&#44; on the first day of the month&#44; 
ye shall have a holy convocation&#44; ye shall do no servile work &#58; 
it is a day of sounding of the cornet unto you.&#34; Numb. xxix. 1. 

17. What other reasons are given for blowing the Shophar&#44; on 
the day you mentioned&#63; 

This day being the first of the year&#44; we are to ac&#8211; 
knowledge anew the Lord our Creator as our Kmg 

                <pb n="127"/>

THE CEREMONIAL LAW. 127 

and God. We therefore blow the cornet at the ap&#8211; 
pointed time&#44; as a testimony of our renewed alle&#8211; 
giance &#59; for thus in the land whence our forefathers 
came was it customary to do&#44; when appointing a 
chief&#44; &#8212; they blew the cornet&#44; and shouted kt Long 
live the King.&#34; &#40;1 Kings i. 39.&#41; 

&#34;Blow the cornet on the day of the new&#8211;moon&#44; at the ap&#8211; 
pointed time&#44; on the day of our solemn feast. For this is a 
statute for Israel&#44; and a law of the God of Jacob.&#34; Ps. 
lxxxi. 4&#44; 5. 

Besides all this&#44; it is the season of atonement&#44; On 
the tenth of this month&#44; as was said already&#44; is the 
great fast&#44; when we are to appear before the Lord to 
be forgiven if we repent. It was customary among 
the ancient Israelites to station men upon high places 
and towers to watch the approach of an enemy. If 
these guards saw any danger&#44; they blew the cornet 
to give warning to the townsmen to arm themselves 
and to be ready for defence. In the same manner 
are we called on to prepare for the day of trial of 
iniquity&#44; to purify our hearts by repentance and a 
solemn resolution to sin no more&#44; in order that we 
may be forgiven. 

&#34; Shall the cornet be blown in a city&#44; and the people not be 
afraid &#63; shall there be evil in a city&#44; and the Lord hath not 
done it V Amos iii. 6. 

18. How is the Day of Atonement to be observed &#63; 

On the tenth day of the seventh month is the 
great day of humiliation and prayer before the Lord. 
During the whole of its continuance&#44; from sunset of 
the ninth till after the stars have appeared on the 
tenth&#44; we shall abstain from food and drink&#44; and all 
earthly enjoyments&#59; and perform no manner of 
labour&#44; just as on the weekly Sabbath. We shall 
seriously think over our past conduct&#44; and offer up 
to God a contrite spirit for our manifold transgres&#8211; 
sions &#59; if we have offended our neighbour we should 
satisfy him&#44; before we ask forgiveness ot the Lord &#59; 

J 12&#42; 

                <pb n="128"/>

128 APPENDIX I. 

and it is for such repentance that we are promised a 
remission of sin&#44; and an atonement for our iniquities. 

&#34;And this shall be a statute for ever unto you&#44; that in the 
seventh month&#44; on the tenth day of the month&#44; ye shall fast&#44; 
and do no work at all. &#8212; And this shall be an everlasting 
statute unto you&#44; to make an atonement for the children of 
Israel&#44; for all their sins&#44; once a year.&#34; Lev. xvi. 29&#8211;34. 

19. What is the reading of the Shemang&#63; 

We are commanded to read daily in our morning 
and evening prayers the chief commandment of the 
Mosaic religion&#44; which commences with the words 
Shemang Yisrahel &#40;Hear&#44; Israel&#41; &#59; in order that we 
may be reminded of our duty to God&#44; aud of the 
religion which He revealed to us. 

&#34; Hear&#44; Israel &#33; the Lord our God&#44; the Lord is one. 
And thou shalt love the Lord thy God&#44; with all thy heart&#44; and 
with all thy soul&#44; and with all thy might. And these words 
which I command thee this day shall be in thy heart. And 
thou shalt teach diligently unto thy children&#44; and shalt speak 
of them&#44; when thou sittest in thy house&#44; aud when thou walk&#8211; 
est by the way&#59; when thou liest down&#44; and when thou risest 
up.&#34; Deut. vi. 4&#8211;7. 

20. What are the Tephillin &#63; 

We are commanded to bind the chief command&#8211; 
ment of the Mosaic religion as a testimonial of the 
covenant at Horeb on our arm and forehead &#59; in 
order that bearing on our bodies the words of the 
Lord we may remember and do them.&#42; 

&#34; And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand&#44; and 
they shall be as frontlets between thy eyes.&#34; Deut. vi. 8. 

21. What is the Mezoozah&#63; 

We shall write down this same chief command&#8211; 
ment of our religion&#44; and fix it on the door&#8211;posts of 
our houses and gates&#59; in order that we may be re&#8211; 
minded upon our going out and our coming in of the

presence of the Almighty and of his universal pro&#8211; 
tection. 

&#34;And thou shalt write them upon the door&#8211;posts of thy 
house&#44; and upon thy gates.&#34; Deut. vi. 9. 

22. What is meant by Tzitzith&#63; 

We shall affix fringes on the borders of one oi 
our garments &#59; in order that we may be always re&#8211; 
minded&#44; by looking at the same&#44; of the holy faith 
which has been revealed to us&#44; and be prevented 
from falling into the power of sin. &#8212; In short&#44; this 
and the other ceremonial observances were given 
that being always surrounded by evidences of God&#39;p 
law&#44; and our subjection thereto&#44; we should daily 
hourly&#44; and even every moment&#44; be reminded of our 
duties&#44; and of the Holy One who demands them of us. 

&#34; And it shall be unto you for a fringe&#44; that ye may look 
upon it&#44; and remember all the commandments of the Lord&#44; 
and do them &#59; and that ye seek not after the inclinations of 
your heart&#44; and the delight of your eyes&#44; in pursuit of which 
ye have been led astray. In order that ye may remember&#44; 
and do all my commandments&#44; and be holy unto your God.&#34; 
Numb. xv. 39&#44; 40. 

23. What ceremonies are founded upon the destruction of the 
temple&#63; 

The fast days&#44; or days of penance. 

24. What constitutes the observance of fast days&#63; 

We shall&#44; on certain days every year&#44; remind our&#8211; 
selves by abstinence from food and other enjoyments 
of the evils which came over us because of the sins 
of our ancestors &#59; and endeavour to reflect upon our 
own conduct&#44; and consecrate our lives to the service 
of God. 

&#34;And even now&#44; also&#44; saith the Lord&#44; return unto me with 
all your heart&#44; with fasting&#44; weeping&#44; and mourning&#59; and rend 
your heart and not your garments&#44; and return unto the Lord 
your God &#59; for He is gracious and merciful&#44; withholding lono&#8211; 
his anger&#44; of great kinduess&#44; and repeuteth of the evil.&#34; Joel 
ii. 12&#44; 13.

130 APPENDIX I. 

25. What is the object of fasting&#63; 

It shall be the outward mark of repentance&#44; but it 
can avail nothing without true inward regret&#44; and 
sincere amendment of our course of life. 

26. Which are the fast days &#63; 

a. The seventeenth of the fourth month&#44; Tamuz&#44; 

b. The ninth of the fifth month&#44; Ah&#44; 

c. The third of the seventh month&#44; Tishry&#44; and&#44; 

d. The tenth of the tenth month&#44; Tebeth. 
&#34;Thus saith the Lord of hosts&#44; The fast of the fourth 

month&#44; and the fast of the fifth&#44; the fast of the seventh&#44; and 
the fast of the tenth&#44; shall be to the house of Judah joy&#44; and 
gladness&#44; and happy seasons&#59; therefore love ye truth and 
peace.&#34; Zech. viii. 19. 

27. What is the meaning of these fasts &#63; 

The}&#39; are days of mourning&#44; which our forefathers&#44; 
with consent of the prophets&#44; set apart in memory 
of the loss of their temple and the independence of 
their state. 

28. Are there any other ceremonies which are to remind us of 
important events in our national history&#63; 

Yes &#59; the following two &#58; 

a. The lighting of the lamps on the festival of 
Hanuckah &#59; and&#44; 

b. The reading of the book of Esther on Punm. 

29. What is the lighting of the Hanuckah&#8211;lamps&#63; 

In the time of the second temple there was a pe&#8211; 
riod&#44; when a heathen king&#44; by the name of Antiochus 
of Syria&#44; had nearly abolished the observance of our 
religion&#44; by the great cruelties he committed in Pa&#8211; 
lestine&#44; over which he had dominion. At length the 
•Jews&#44; led on by the valiant Judas Maccabeus&#44; drove 
the Syrian army out of the land &#59; and when the peo&#8211; 
ple again consecrated the temple they instituted a 
festival&#44; called Hanuckah&#44; or the Consecration&#44; and 
ordered that for all future periods lamps should be 
lighted in our Synagogues and dwellings&#44; commenc&#8211;

THE CEREMONIAL LAW. 131 

1112&#58; from the evening of the twenty&#8211;fourth &#40;lav of the 
ninth month&#44; orKislev&#44; as an everlasting memorial of 
the mercy of the Lord&#44; displayed in delivering his peo&#8211; 
ple and his religion from the power of the oppressor. 

30. What is the festival of Purim &#63; 

We shall celebrate a festival on the fourteenth and 
iifteenth of the twelfth month&#44; Aclar&#44; in memory of 
the great deliverance which God gave us from the 
evil designs of Haman&#44; who&#44; with concurrence of the 
king of Persia&#44; had resolved to destroy all the Jews 
residing in that kingdom&#44; which in fact included 
nearly&#44; if not all&#44; the descendants of Israel. We 
therefore keep a fast on the thirteenth&#44; and a festival 
on the next two days&#59; and to commemorate the 
event&#44; we read the Book of Esther which contains 
the history thereof&#59; in order that we may be always 
reminded how good our heavenly Father has ever 
been to us&#59; and that thereby we maybe animated 
with a sincere desire to deserve in future his love 
and mercy&#44; by a devotion to his will and a strict 
adherence to his law. 

&#34; The Jews ordained&#44; and took upon themselves&#44; and upon 
their seed&#44; and upon all such as joined themselves unto them&#44; 
so that it should not fail&#44; that they would keep these two d&#59;iys 
according to their writing&#44; and according to their appointed 
time every year. And that these days should be remembered 
and kept throughout every generation&#44; every family&#44; every 
province&#44; and every city&#59; and that these days of Purim should 
not fail from among the Jews&#44; nor the memorial of them perish 
from their seed.&#34; Esther ix. 27&#44; 28. 

31. By what is this festival distinguished&#63; 

&#34;We should give liberal presents to the poor and 
needy&#44; so that they also might rejoice &#34;on the days 
when the Jews rested from their enemies&#44; and the 
month which was turned unto them from sorrow to 
joy&#44; and from mourning into a good day&#59; that they 
should make them days of feasting and joy&#44; and of 
sending&#58; portions one to another&#44; and gifts to tho 
poor. &#34;Ibid. 22.

APPEOT&#41;IX n. 

THE JEWISH CREED. 

1. What do you call a creed&#63; 

Those doctrines which are the foundation of any 
system of religion &#58; in other words&#44; those ideas of 
belief which one admits as the follower of a particu&#8211; 
lar faith. 

2. Have we any ideas peculiar to us&#44; as followers of the Mosaic 
Law&#63; 

We have &#59; and upon the admission thereof rests 
the distinction which divides us from other nations. 

3. Is the belief in this creed alone sufficient to insure sal&#8211; 
vation &#63; 

By no means &#59; we should believe and confide in 
the truth of religious doctrines&#59; but without acts to 
demonstrate the existence of such faith&#44; our life is 
not pleasing to God&#44; who demands of us active ex&#8211; 
ertions in his holy service. 

4. What is then the use of a creed&#63; 

The firm faith in and admission of acknowledged 
truths will best promote a correct course of life &#58; for 
by being impressed with holy feelings we will be best 
able to withstand temptations and the inclination to 
sin inherent in man. 

5. Which are the chief doctrines already given&#63; 
I. The belief in God. 

TI. The belief in the revelation of the Law.&#44; 
III. The belief in reward and punishment after 
death. 

                <pb n="133"/>

THE JEWISH CREED. 133 

6. Are there not some modifications&#44; or more extensive ideas&#44; 
connected with these chief doctrines of Faith &#63; 

There are several&#44; which have been already partly 
mentioned. 

7. Into how many divisions is then the whole Jewish Creed 
divided&#44; as generally accepted among us&#63; 

Into thirteen&#44; which are generally called the Thir&#8211; 
teen Fundamental Principles of the Jewish Faith&#44; 
because upon the admission of them we found the 
truth and the justness of our lives as Israelites faith&#8211; 
ful to the law of God. 

8. Please to recite them in the order in which they are found 
in our books. 

I. I believe with a firm faith that there exists a 
Creator&#44; who&#44; blessed be his name&#44; has created and 
governs all his creatures &#59; and that He alone has 
made&#44; does make&#44; and will make&#44; all things that can 
by any possibility have existence. 

II. I believe with a firm faith that the Creator is 
one&#44; and there is no unity like Him in any manner&#44; 
and that He alone is our God&#44; who was&#44; who is&#44; and 
who will be. 

III. I believe with a firm faith that the blessed 
Creator is incorporeal &#59; that no bodily infirmities or 
accidents can reach Him&#44; and that He can be com&#8211; 
pared to nothing corporeal of which we can form 
any idea. 

IV. I believe with a firm faith that the blessed 
Creator is the first and the last. 

V. I believe with a firm faith that the blessed 
Creator is the only one to whom we should pray&#44; 
and there is besides Him no being to whom we 
ought to address our prayers. 

XL I believe with a firm faith that all the words 
of the prophets are true. 

VH. I believe with a firm faith that the prophecy 
of our teacher Moses &#40;upon whom be peace&#41; is true&#44; 

                <pb n="134"/>

134 APPENDIX II. 

and that he was the chief of all the wise men that 
lived before him or will come after him. 

VIII. I believe with a firm faith that the whole 
law&#44; which we have now in our possession&#44; is the 
same which was given to our teacher Moses &#40;uj on 
whom be peace&#41;. 

IX. I believe with a firm faith that this law will 
not be changed&#44; and that there will not be another 
law from the Creator&#44; blessed be his name. 

X. I believe with a firm faith that the blessed 
Creator knows all the deeds of the sons of man&#44; and 
all their thoughts &#59; as it is written &#58; &#34; He fashioneth 
all their hearts&#44; and understandeth all their works.&#34; 

XI. I believe with a firm faith that the blessed 
Creator will reward those who keep his command&#8211; 
ments&#44; and punish those who transgress them. 

XII. I believe with a firm faith in the coming of 
the Messiah &#59; and though he tarry&#44; still will I daily 
wait for his coming. 

XIII. I believe with a firm faith that the dead will 
be called to life at the time it may be the will of the 
blessed Creator&#44; whose memorial be glorified for 
everlasting&#44; and to all eternity. 

9. Why do you believe these doctrines &#63; 

Because they are all founded upon the revealed 
word of God&#44; as we have shown by the various texts 
from the Bible which we have quoted before. In 
short&#44; our creed is based upon the truth of God&#44; and 
in confidence upon his wisdom and &#39;goodness&#44; and in 
reliance upon his mercy and justice&#44; which&#44; like His 
existence&#44; are everlasting. 



THE END.
