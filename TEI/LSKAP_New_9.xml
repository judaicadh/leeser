			<p rend="indent(1)">The annexed letter from <persName role="author">Rev. Dr. Cox</persName>&#44; of the <placeName>United<lb/> States</placeName>&#44; to <persName>Sir Culling Eardley</persName>&#44; of <placeName>England</placeName>&#44; expresses<lb/> the unanimous sentiment of the people of this country<lb/> on the topic under consideration.  Here we <emph rend="italics">have tried</emph><lb/> the experiment of granting political equality to Jews<lb/> in common with other denominations of religionists&#44;<lb/> and have found it to work kindly and well.  No evils<lb/> have resulted from it&#44; but the contrary.</p>
				<p rend="align(center)">Communicated for the Journal of Commerce.</p>
				<p>TO <addressee>SIR CULLING E. EARDLEY</addressee>&#44; <placeName>BART.&#44; LONDON</placeName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">From your late kind letter&#44; the receipt of which I<lb/> gratefully acknowledge&#44; my dear <persName>Sir Culling</persName>&#44; you will<lb/> probably be leaving <placeName>London</placeName>&#44; as I judge&#44; for <placeName>Berlin</placeName>&#44;<lb/> by the time this reaches you&#59; to attend that meeting<lb/> of our Evangelical Alliance&#44; which His Majesty&#44; the<lb/> <persName>King</persName> of <placeName>Prussia</placeName>&#44; has invited to his own capital&#44; and<lb/> which&#44; according to your kind urgency and that of<lb/> several others&#44; I should be happy to attend&#44; were this<lb/> compatible with relative duties here.  As it is&#44; you<lb/> will have some worthy representatives from <placeName>America</placeName>&#44;<lb/> beside <persName>Rev. Dr. Baird</persName>&#44; <persName>Rev. Dr. Kirk</persName>&#44; <persName>Rev. Dr. Alex<lb/>ander</persName>&#44; and a number of others&#44; extensively and favor&#45;<lb/>ably known in both hemispheres.  As the grand<lb/> crowner of all&#44; may the Great Head of the Church&#44;<lb/> the King of <placeName>Sion</placeName>&#44; our Lord and Saviour <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>&#44; be<lb/> with you&#58; illumining your way&#59; prospering your de&#45;<lb/>liberations and measures&#44; to such results&#44; as HIMSELF<lb/> may consistently perpetuate and bless&#44; to the good of<lb/> nations&#44; and ultimately to the conversion of the world<lb/> to the knowledge of the only living and true God.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">On another occasion&#44; <persName>Sir Culling</persName>&#44; I hope to enjoy<lb/> the luxury of your correspondence in a more extended<lb/> and private form&#59; and also never to have it totally in&#45;<lb/>termitted or relinquished&#44; while we are both&#44; by the<lb/> sovereign pleasure of God&#44; continued in the present<lb/> world.  But I seem to have a special reason for this<lb/> public letter&#59; in reference to a topic of common and<lb/> ecumenical interest to Christian States and Christian<lb/> men&#59; especially to the English world&#44; both Anglican<lb/> and Anglo&#45;American&#59; as well as related to the legiti&#45;<lb/>mate objects of the Evangelical Alliance&#44; and the pro&#45;<lb/>gress of Christianity&#44; with its ascendant ju&#45;<lb/>risdiction in the whole world.  That topic<lb/> may vindicate the propriety&#44; as well as il&#45;<lb/>lustrate the design of this public commu&#45;<lb/><sic>munication</sic>.  I allude distinctly to the recent action of<lb/> the House of Lords&#44; in their rejection of the bill for<lb/> the removal of Jewish disabilities&#44; in respect to the<lb/> oath required to be taken by the members of Parlia&#45;<lb/>ment.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">It is not my plan to review the proceedings or the<lb/> speeches of their Lordships&#44; though that of the <persName>Earl</persName> of<lb/> <placeName>Derby</placeName> especially&#44; Lord Chancellor as he is&#44; <persName>Sir Cul&#45;<lb/>ling</persName>&#44; or your own venerated <emph rend="italics">Alma Mater</emph>&#44; the Univer&#45;<lb/>sity of <placeName>Oxford</placeName>&#44; I view as rather invitingly vulnerable&#59;<lb/> especially in contrast with the nobler&#44; and I must say&#44;<lb/> the wiser views of the new <persName>Lord Bishop</persName> of <placeName>London</placeName>.  I<lb/> only design to take general regards of the matter&#44; es&#45;<lb/>pecially its results and its tendencies&#44; as connected<lb/> with the duty of Christian men and the enlightened<lb/> policy of Christian nations&#59; and these as seen by my<lb/> own countrymen&#44; the most evangelical and intelligent<lb/> of them&#44; and indeed by our whole country of the<lb/> <placeName>United States</placeName>&#59; lamenting the position of their<lb/> Lordships&#44; and censuring them for conduct&#44; at<lb/> once&#44; in their view&#44; improper&#44; unreasonable&#44; inutile&#44;<lb/> unprotestant&#44; and derogatory to the just progress and<lb/> prospect of our age and their own great nation&#44; as well<lb/> as savoring of the spirit of persecution toward so large&#44;<lb/> and so opulent&#44; and so respectable a portion of their<lb/> fellow&#45;subjects.  There is an animus in the action&#44;<lb/> whose influence is easily detected&#44; and must be dis&#45;<lb/>approved by all the more elevated Christianity of<lb/> Christendom.  Is ours the doctrine of the masters of<lb/> the Inquisitorial Commission&#63;  Is it our duty to <emph rend="italics">per&#45;</emph><lb/> <emph rend="italics">secute</emph> any who may differ from us in religious views&#63;<lb/>  Is it the best way to benefit them&#44; the way of wisdom<lb/> to convince them&#44; or the proper way to conciliate to<lb/> our success the necessary benediction of our God&#63;<lb/>  Has he authorized it&#63;  What damage could accrue to<lb/> the State by honoring&#44; in favor of the Israelite&#44; at once&#44;<lb/> his consistency and his scruples in the matter&#63;<lb/>  We are surprised&#44; are grieved&#44; at the conduct of<lb/> their Lordships.  Its echoes are not excellent<lb/> or musical on this side of the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName>.<lb/>  We all think that they will not bear to be<lb/> reviewed in the strong light&#44; either of honorable and<lb/> wise statesmanship&#44; or of evangelical truth&#59; and the<lb/> peers of <placeName>England</placeName>&#44; if they wish not to degrade their no&#45;<lb/>bility in the eyes of all the world&#44; as well as through&#45;<lb/>out the immense majority of the Christian sentiment<lb/> of the British nation&#44; ought to <emph rend="italics">go and sin no more</emph>&#44;<lb/> against the people who gave us the Holy Scriptures&#44;<lb/> the nation from whom and of whom was our blessed<lb/> Saviour&#33; and whom to persecute has been the shame&#44;<lb/> the history&#44; and the sin&#44; of almost universal Christen&#45;<lb/>dom.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">It is my definite object&#44; my dear <persName>Sir Culling</persName>&#44; to<lb/> commend THIS TOPIC to the solemn consideration of<lb/> the Evangelical Alliance&#44; and also to their lucid and<lb/> deliberate action.  It were well for them to act on it.<lb/>  The learning and the piety and the dignity that are<lb/> there to convene&#44; will make the metropolis of His<lb/> Majesty&#44; <persName>Frederick William</persName>&#44; for the time&#44; the lumi&#45;<lb/>nous focal centre of Christendom.  It seems to<lb/> court or claim the attention of mankind.<lb/>  I am persuaded that in an assemblage so<lb/> august and so eminent&#44; so truly philanthropic&#44; so<lb/> sincerely Christian&#44; and so signally <sic>patronised</sic> by one<lb/> of the noblest and most excellent sovereigns in the<lb/> world&#44; their collective wisdom can be neither a discord<lb/> nor an ambiguity.  Nor can it be unheeded.  May we<lb/> not&#44; then&#44; hope for a worthy&#44; out&#45;spoken&#44; and loud&#45;<lb/>sounding deliverance&#44; from their assembled and deli&#45;<lb/>berative multitude&#63;  Shall such an occasion be lost to<lb/> the cause of universal liberty of conscience&#63;  We need<lb/> not remind them that the only legitimate monarch of<lb/> the conscience is the King of Kings and the Lord of<lb/> Lords.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">It has struck me&#44; too&#44; my honored friend&#44; that my<lb/> own dear country&#8212;with all its faults&#44; I love it still&#8212;<lb/> may&#44; with singular propriety&#44; be the <emph rend="italics">censor morum</emph><lb/> of <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>&#44; on such a topic as this.  If<lb/> you are the parent nation&#44; the older and the<lb/> wiser&#44; ought you not to set us&#44; and the rest of<lb/> mankind&#44; a wise and good example&#8212;and none other&#63;<lb/>  Whatever may be our delinquencies and sins&#44; I must<lb/> urge that here the comparison is to us eminently hon&#45;<lb/>orable&#33;  We have set you and the world in this&#44; if not<lb/> in some other particulars&#44; a noble and a good exam&#45;<lb/>ple.  We are the only great Christian nation known<lb/> to me&#44; that has&#44; either in popular sentiment or in our<lb/> civil enactments&#44; NEVER AUTHORISED THE PRESECU&#45;<lb/>TION OF THE JEWS.  On the contrary&#44; we have cher&#45;<lb/>ished&#44; respected and protected them.  For this&#44; pleased<lb/> and almost proud of it&#44; I rejoice and bless the God of<lb/> <persName>Abraham</persName>.  In our country&#44; no law is framed for the<lb/> disfranchisement of one of them.  The controversy<lb/> between the synagogue and the church is properly and<lb/> well maintained&#44; on the basis of moral&#44; historical&#44; pro&#45;<lb/>phetical and scriptural argumentation&#44; and that alone.<lb/>  Socially&#44; commercially and vicinally&#44; as well<lb/> as in all the general relations of life&#44; our<lb/> intercourse is polite and kind&#44; and our Christian<lb/> piety makes us respect them with sincere considera&#45;<lb/>tion and benignity.  Our first <persName>President&#44; WASHINGTON</persName>&#44;<lb/> when first inaugurated in <date>1789</date>&#44; was approached and<lb/> addressed by their Rabbis and their Chiefs&#44; from dif&#45;<lb/>ferent cities&#44; in terms of lauded propriety&#44; and of law&#45;<lb/>abiding fidelity to the established Government&#59; and<lb/> that incomparable PATER PATRIAE&#44; <emph rend="italics">patiens vocari</emph>&#44; re&#45;<lb/>plied to them in a style worthy of his official station&#44;<lb/> worthy of his exalted character&#44; worthy of the senti&#45;<lb/>ments of a great though then comparatively youthful<lb/> nation.  We have fully tried the unique experiment<lb/> ever since&#44; and now report in their favor.  They are<lb/> in the main characteristically good citizens&#59; and we<lb/> should have no comparable hope that God would ever<lb/> use and honor us to make them good Christians&#44; if&#44;<lb/> misrepresenting the goodness of the Author of Chris&#45;<lb/>tianity&#44; we were to scorn&#44; insult&#44; abuse&#44; or injure them<lb/>&#8212;as <persName>WASHINGTON</persName>&#44; to say nothing of any higher sanc&#45;<lb/>tion&#44; could never patronize&#44; or willingly for one mo&#45;<lb/>ment endure&#33;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The reasons of their Lordships for retiring the bill<lb/> are immensely unsatisfactory.  With all proper rever&#45;<lb/>ence for their exalted position&#44; as hereditary senators<lb/> of <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>&#44; let it be something to them&#44; that our<lb/> superior Christian civilization&#44; as constructively<lb/> viewed in the contrast&#44; redounds&#44; in <placeName>America</placeName> and in<lb/> all the world&#44; only to our praise and to their own<lb/> manifold and manifest disparagement.  The sins of<lb/> the Jews&#44; their unbelief and alleged indocility&#44; the<lb/> prophecies of retribution that regard them&#44; however<lb/> clearly identified in their just interpretation and scope<lb/> as affecting them&#44; afford no apology&#44; or mitigation of<lb/> blame&#44; to Christian nations&#44; if any are found volun&#45;<lb/>teering to punish them for it.  It is that which<lb/> God has forbidden&#44; not required at our hand.  Be&#45;<lb/>side&#44; what harm can possibly accrue to church or<lb/> State&#44; by conceding to them&#44; as well as to Romanists<lb/> and Quakers&#44; all their civil and political rights&#63;  Is<lb/> not a man fully qualified&#44; so far as an oath goes or<lb/> ought to go&#44; in civil relations&#44; either Christian or Mo&#45;<lb/>hommedan&#44; or Jew or Heretic&#44; when&#44; on his responsi&#45;<lb/>bility to God and man&#44; he promises&#44; in any court of<lb/> record or before competent witnesses&#44; to do his duty<lb/> according to law&#63;  The proper jurisdiction of magis&#45;<lb/>trates ought there to pause and be satisfied&#59;&#8212;<emph rend="italics">to God</emph><lb/> <emph rend="italics">the things that are God&#39;s</emph>&#33;  It is not theirs to interpose<lb/> between a man&#39;s conscience or creed&#44; and that most<lb/> holy Judge eternal&#44; to whom his and our account is so<lb/> soon to be rendered&#44; with infallible equity and truth.<lb/>  This is the doctrine of my country&#59; and not on that ac&#45;<lb/>count&#44; but for higher reasons&#44; it ought to be&#44; in all con&#45;<lb/>sistency and policy&#44; the doctrine of every Christian<lb/> country on the globe.

			<p rend="indent(1)">Among the signs of the times&#44; <persName>Sir Culling</persName>&#44; it has not<lb/> escaped your own meditative sagacity as a christian&#44;<lb/> that god is bringing that wonderful people to a<lb/> wonderful crisis in their destiny. They are<lb/> not relatively the people they were&#44; to Christen&#45;<lb/>dom&#44; in the periods of mediaeval history.  They have<lb/> risen&#44; improved in social position&#44; more intelligent&#44;<lb/> eminently more potential&#44; and now much more con&#45;<lb/>siderable&#44; even in the politics of <placeName>Europe</placeName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">They hold the purse&#45;strings of nations.  They com&#45;<lb/>mand the sinews of war&#44; in the hostile moves of princes.<lb/>  How much on bond and mortgage&#44; with <placeName>England</placeName><lb/> and <placeName>France</placeName> to guarantee the payment&#44; own they&#44; of the<lb/> territories of the Sultan in <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>&#44; of the Pope in<lb/> <placeName>Italy</placeName>&#44; and of many mighty monarchs in other places&#33;<lb/>  How prodigiously has their wealth accumulated&#33;  In<lb/> the <placeName>United States</placeName>&#44; within my own memory&#44; their num&#45;<lb/>bers&#44; their synagogues&#44; their intelligence&#44; their opu&#45;<lb/>lence&#44; their respectability and influence&#44; have steadily<lb/> altered&#44; in one direction only.  They love this country&#44;<lb/> with reason.  It is their occidental <placeName>Palestine</placeName>.  They<lb/> have never done us harm&#8212;nor we them.  I love to<lb/> think that God&#44; who is said to govern nations in this<lb/> world&#44; in which alone as nations they exist&#44; according<lb/> to their secular and collective conduct in it&#44; has mani&#45;<lb/>festly blest us&#44; for so hospitably&#44; and so equally&#44; and<lb/> so singularly entertaining them&#59; and I feel no desire<lb/> that <placeName>America</placeName> should have the blessing in monopoly&#59;<lb/> and not in communion with other Christian na&#45;<lb/>tions&#44; especially&#8212;I say it with liberal and gen&#45;<lb/>uine filial piety&#8212;especially with <placeName>GREAT BRIT&#45;<lb/>AIN</placeName>&#33;  yes&#33; there is an allied reason which I may not<lb/> omit to urge&#8212;the injuries they have suffered at the<lb/> hands of our fathers&#59; in contrast with the benefits we<lb/> have derived&#44; so vast and so incomparable&#44; from that long<lb/> dismembered nation.  Let us rather try to compensate<lb/> them for what they have had to feel and to bear&#8212;pri&#45;<lb/>vations&#44; ignominies&#44; ostracisms&#44; malignities&#44; cruelties&#44;<lb/> amercements&#44; civil deaths&#44; imprisonments&#44; exiles&#44; pro&#45;<lb/>scriptions&#44; and all manner of abuse&#33;  Are not justice<lb/> and generosity here to be co&#45;operative in their favor&#59;<lb/> practically one in all wise measures of reconciliation<lb/> and benevolence&#63;  How will the repeated and now too<lb/> systematic action of their Lordships look&#44; when the<lb/> pen of truth shall portray it in full&#44; on the page of his&#45;<lb/>tory&#8212;especially if soon hereafter some Christian Israel&#45;<lb/>ite&#44; learned as <persName>Neander</persName>&#44; shall move that pen&#63;  I blush<lb/> for the renowned posterity of the <persName>Earl</persName> of <placeName>Derby</placeName>&#44; if they<lb/> shall ever read&#44; in the <date>twentieth century</date> of the Chris&#45;<lb/>tian era&#44; the speeches in parliament of their august<lb/> ancestor&#59; who seems now rather unconscious of such<lb/> an amphitheatre of interested yet impartial specta&#45;<lb/>tors.</p>
