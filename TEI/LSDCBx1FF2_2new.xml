				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>Richmond</placeName>&#44; <date>Monday&#44; 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Kislev &#40;Nov.&#41; 1825</date>.</p>
				<p>Peace and all good forever to our master and teacher&#44; the crown of our<lb/> head&#44; chief of the court&#44; rabbi and guide of the holy flock&#44; <persName>Rabbi<lb/> Abraham Sutro</persName>&#44; etc.&#44; and peace and all that is good to his wife&#44; <persName>Rebecca</persName>&#44;<lb/> and to all the members of his household.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I have been very much pained to find out that you have not received<lb/> my letters.  I was the more sad about this because I must have seemed un&#45;<lb/>grateful&#44; since you might have supposed that my silence was due to the fact<lb/> that I had already forgotten everything that I received from you and my<lb/> other friends.  But&#44; believe me&#44; that after having been here four days&#44; I<lb/> began to write&#44; and wrote fourteen<lb/> <del>a a a</del> on the 10th day&#44; and dispatched<lb/> them at once.  How it happened that you did not receive them&#44; I cannot<lb/> understand&#44; for I wrote&#44; and waited from <date>Rosh Hodesh Ellul</date> for a letter<lb/> daily.  Until finally I was fortunate enough to receive four letters<lb/> from <persName>Dulmen</persName> <sic>Two</sic> hours after we left the synagogue on <date>Sh&#39;mini Atzereth</date>.<lb/>  It is now about 2 weeks since I sent a bundle of letters addressed <del>&#63;</del><lb/> in care of <persName>Mr. A. Leffman</persName>&#44; by way of <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>&#44; but I cannot tell when<lb/> these letters will arrive in <placeName>Germany</placeName>.  Since now an opportunity presents<lb/> itself by way of <placeName>Rotterdam</placeName>&#44; since the <persName>brig Somers&#44; E. P. Lord</persName>&#44; company&#44; is<lb/> about to leave for that point&#44; I decided to send as many letters as pos&#45;<lb/>sible to such people to whom I have not yet written.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I had to overcome several dangers before arriving in <placeName>America</placeName>.<lb/>  Sometimes it seemed as if &#34;The cords of death encompassed me and the<lb/> straits of the grave had come upon me&#34;&#42;.  The storms which we had during our long journey sometimes threatened destruction&#44; a precipitate death&#44;<lb/> a cold&#44; sad&#44; terrible end&#44; but&#44; &#34;I found trouble and sorrow and called upon<lb/> the name of the lord&#34;&#42;&#42;.  Frequently&#44; dear Rabbi&#44; your blessing&#44; your wishes<lb/> at my departure&#44; gave me new strength&#44; new courage.  For&#44; was not this<lb/> your blessing&#44; &#34;If you go in water&#44; I am with you&#44; and streams will not<lb/> overwhelm you&#34;&#42;&#42;&#42; Although I was unprepared to die&#44; nevertheless I gave<lb/> myself silently over to the will of the Almighty.  and since I had no<lb/> prayer book in which there was a prayer for travelers on the sea&#44; I made</p>
				<p>&#42;Psalm 116&#58;3  &#42;&#42;Psalm 116&#58;3  &#42;&#42;&#42;Isaiah 43&#58;2 &#40;somewhat misprinted[&#63;]&#41;</p>

				<p>up my own&#44; which occasionally brought me some comfort.  I had to overcome<lb/> certain unpleasantnesses&#44; but&#44; thank God&#44; without their c<add>a</add>using me the<lb/> slightest loss.  I learned from it how little one needs to live&#44; how<lb/> much to live well.  <sic>So&#63;</sic> Much about my journey&#44; I have related <sic>agreat</sic> deal<lb/> in my letters to <persName>Rabbi Benjamin K. Z.</persName>&#44; which went by way of <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>.<lb/>  And since you are the chief of our communities in <placeName>Westphalia</placeName>&#44; the follow&#45;<lb/>ing report&#44; the translation of which I want to give to you&#44; will probab&#45;<lb/>ly interest you.  <persName>George Bethune English</persName> was a teacher of philology in<lb/> one of the universities of the <placeName>northern states</placeName>.  Through research he dis&#45;<lb/>covered that the religion of the Nazarene was false and that our reli&#45;<lb/>gion is first in truth and probability.  Nevertheless&#44; he did not want<lb/> to accept it completely.  <persName>Mordecai M. Noah</persName> is a Jewish lawyer in the city<lb/> of <placeName>New York</placeName>.  He was once consul of the <placeName>United States</placeName> to the <placeName>Barbary<lb/> States</placeName>.  I believe <placeName>Algiers</placeName> or <placeName>Tripoli</placeName>.  He wrote a book about his travels<lb/> which I have not yet seen.  This man <persName>Noah</persName> is the editor of a newspaper&#44;<lb/> bearing the name &#34;National Advocate&#34; which appears twice weekly.  In the<lb/> issue of <date>Tuesday&#44; the 4th of May</date>&#44; <persName>Mr. Noah</persName> says&#44;&#34;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#34;At the departure of <persName>Mr. English</persName> for <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>&#44; in the sum&#45;<lb/>mer of <date>1823</date>&#44; we asked him to 	send to us some news regarding the<lb/> number and condition of the Jews in the <placeName>Ottoman Empire</placeName>.  	When he<lb/> arrived there&#44; the following letter from him which was contained<lb/> <sic>ina</sic> newspaper 	from <placeName>Smyrna</placeName>&#44; shows some important facts&#44; which in&#45;<lb/>dicate that the Jews have never&#44; since they 	became scattered&#44; been<lb/> quite without a certain internal government.  The opinions of <persName>Mr.<lb/> English</persName> about the Greeks may have caused certain changes in his report.  We&#44; in this land&#44; have 	a different opinion from him.</p>
				<p><placeName>Constantinople</placeName>&#44; <date>January 13&#44; 1824</date>.</p>
				<p>Dear Sir&#58; I have the honor to let you know that after a good many un&#45;<lb/>fortunate delays&#44; I finally arrived in the capital of the <placeName>Ottoman Em&#45;<lb/>pire</placeName> during the first days of <date>November</date>.......</p>
				<p>&#40;Unfortunately&#44; the letter breaks <sic>offhere</sic>&#41;</p>
