				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>Montreal</placeName> <date>22 June 5616</date>.</p>
				<p><addressee>Rev. I. Leeser</addressee></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><placeName>Philadelphia</placeName></p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">Dear sir</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">You will think I have quite forgotten your favor<lb/> of <date>5<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> inst. which I received the day after <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; but however<lb/> improbable it may appear to you&#44; I have not had a minute<lb/> for letter writing since the holy days.  You know I teach<lb/> the children Hebrew&#44; and the number has greatly increased&#45;<lb/>&#45;but you do not wish to know how I have been employed</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">You need not thank me for the almost nothing<lb/> I have done&#44; &#38; would do for any one under the same circumstances.<lb/>  The two Daily Prayers sent will I presume soon go&#44; but<lb/> not the Catechisms.  If I am to collect the amounts<lb/> due you for Bibles &#38;c you had better enclose me a slip<lb/> which you can send with the next Occidents&#44; something<lb/> in this form.  I hereby request &#38; <sic>authorise</sic> <persName>NDS</persName> to<lb/> collect <add>&#63;</add>  It is useless to refer in this again to what<lb/> has so long passed&#44; but I am not the only one who<lb/> thinks I had cause to be disappointed in your<lb/> course towards me.  You stated in the Occident I had done you<lb/> wrong.  I deny this as emphatically now as ever<lb/> My conduct towards you was honest fair and above<lb/> board&#44; although I know you conveyed a different</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>impression to mutual friends&#44; upon whom however<lb/> it had no effect.  I yet think were you to review all<lb/> you would find I had some good grounds for my opinion.<lb/>  Had matters so turned out with any other than yourself<lb/> I should long since have ceased to think of that with<lb/> derision and contempt&#59; but it was a hard thing to be<lb/> branded as something mean and vile by one whose good<lb/> opinion had ever been so prized by me&#44; and which had<lb/> ever been so flattering.  I always am prepared to admit<lb/> that misrepresentation&#44; antagonism &#38; jealousy of you<lb/> were rife&#44; but I deny before my maker that these<lb/> feelings ever actuated me&#59; that I did or said anything<lb/> that after the best reflection I thought calculated to<lb/> injure you or your chances of re&#45;election on your<lb/> own terms&#44; or that I ever had any feelings towards<lb/> you but of respect &#38; esteem.  You will never<lb/> know how&#44; even since the appointment of your<lb/> succession to office&#44; I have been invited from <hi rend="underline">other</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">quarters than <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName></hi> &#40;let me add this&#44; for I<lb/> would not wish you even to suppose for a minute<lb/> that your successor was one&#41; to engage&#44; humble as<lb/> my position is&#44; in various things which could only<lb/> be injurious to you.  I do not desire to embitter<lb/> your intercourse with those men in office with<lb/> whom you must even if occasionally only come<lb/> in contact&#44; but I have convincing proof of</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>my having been <del>charged</del> deemed guilty of insincerity by you<lb/> without cause.  I at one moment was on the point of<lb/> showing you this&#44; but second &#38; better thoughts came.<lb/>  <hi rend="underline">You had already publicly pronounced your opinion</hi>&#44; though<lb/> as a sincere friend you had no right to condemn me<lb/> so quickly &#38; unheard&#44; <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; and <add>Hebrew</add> you<lb/> had forgotten.  When a line from <placeName>New Orleans</placeName> would have<lb/> settled all&#44; your dignity would not permit you to realize<lb/> that if there is <add>Hebrew</add> there is also <add>Hebrew</add>.  I had<lb/> never thought to have written&#44; at least not to day<lb/> on this subject&#44; one so fruitless of result&#44; as it necessarily<lb/> must be&#44; but as it is written it must go. Perhaps<lb/> were we living in the same city&#44; some good result<lb/> might be arrived at.  At present I think of <add>Hebrew</add></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Had I had time I would have written you before<lb/> to tell you of my fathers having informed me a few weeks<lb/> since of your <add>&#63;</add> to him about the Prayer Books.<lb/>  He writes me he would address you by the same packet<lb/> so you will learn from himself the reasons for declining<lb/>  I would have told you myself of his going on as far as<lb/> his third vol.  The first has been for some time<lb/> in <placeName>Montreal</placeName>&#44; &#38; last <date>August</date> I saw it in <placeName>New York</placeName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Apropos des <hi rend="underline">bottes</hi>&#44; what else but an obstructive<lb/> policy did you expect there&#44; unless a little or small policy<lb/> I hope the <add>Hebrew</add> may find not duly <del>find</del> a field of<lb/> usefulness sans obstructions but also a bed of roses<lb/>&#45;not <add>Hebrew</add>&#45;though I feel disposed sagely<lb/> to shake my head &#38; say I have my doubts.</p>
			<p rend="indent(3)">I remain yours truly</p>
