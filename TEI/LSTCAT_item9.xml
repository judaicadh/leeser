                <date>13 October 1850</date>
            </p>
            <p>My dear Sir,</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I received a few days ago your kind<lb/> letter,
                    <sic>coverring</sic> the proof of an article, which<lb/> you propose to publish
                in the next Occident;<lb/> and although you do not <hi rend="underline">exactly</hi>
                ask my<lb/> advice, I am led to infer that you desire it,<lb/> by the fact that you
                sent me the “proof.”<lb/> I would publish no article on the subject, nor<lb/> would
                I <hi rend="underline">allude</hi> to it in any manner <hi rend="underline"
                    >what</hi>=<lb/><hi rend="underline">soever</hi>, either in print, or in <hi
                    rend="underline">conversation</hi>.<lb/> You have been badly treated, but
                neither writing<lb/> nor talking will mend the mend<add>?</add> the matter, or
                place<lb/> you in <hi rend="underline">status quo</hi>. Why then write? It will
                give<lb/> pain to your real friends, who will think it indig=<lb/>nified and
                pleasure to your enemies, who will<lb/> thereby see, &amp; know that you are
                mortified. <hi rend="underline">Silence</hi><lb/> will, <hi rend="underline">I
                    think</hi>, produce a reaction. <hi rend="underline">I am sure</hi> it<lb/> will
                make you friends, and that it will be more<lb/> dignified. Men should never act
                without an<lb/> object, and what do you propose to effect by your<lb/> proposed
                article. If however you think otherwise<lb/> I pray you strike out those words I
                have passed<lb/> my pen through. I think you wrong to have any</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>feeling against <persName>Mr. DeSola</persName>, or <persName>Dr. Raphall</persName>.
                It was no<lb/> breach of friendship in the former becoming a<lb/> candidate, when
                applications were invited by pub=<lb/>=lic advertisement; and you must admit that
                his<lb/> offering neither injured, nor <sic>benefitted</sic> you. Your<lb/> enemies
                were determined to put you down the<lb/> same crew had been striving for that object
                for<lb/> twenty five years, and the wonder is that you<lb/> held your ground so
                long. Now as to <persName>Dr. Rs.</persName> Giving<lb/> a <hi rend="underline"
                    >certificate</hi> of <hi rend="underline">qualification</hi>, I have no
                hesi=<lb/>=tancy in saying that <hi rend="underline">he</hi>, and <hi
                    rend="underline">every other man</hi><lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">is bound</hi> by every principle of honor, and duty<lb/> to
                give such a certificate whenever called on to<lb/> do so, if the party is capable. I
                have given cer=<lb/>=tificates of qualification, when at the same<lb/> time I
                desired an other equally capable to<lb/> receive the appointment. Try, my friend,
                to<lb/> think differently of mankind—do not, I pray you,<lb/> suppose that every
                body is against you. There<lb/> is good and evil in this world—and all of us
                have<lb/> our respective shares. You may remember<lb/> an anecdote of <persName>Dr.
                    Franklin</persName>. When about leaving<lb/>
                <placeName>Boston</placeName> for his voyage of life, he went to see an old<lb/>
                friend, who at his departure took him through<lb/> a dark passage by which he struck
                his head against<lb/> a beam. The old man said, let this teach you<lb/> that you
                must often stoop if you want to<lb/> pass through life without difficulty.
                    <persName>Franklin</persName><lb/> took the hint, &amp; you know his
                history.</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>Now I, by no means, intend to advise, a mean, time<lb/> serving policy: being all
                things unto all men<lb/> we should have fixed <hi rend="underline">principles</hi>,
                and should adhere to<lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">them</hi> at every <sic>hazzard</sic>. But there are many
                things<lb/> in which <hi rend="underline">principle</hi> is not involved, and then
                it is<lb/> not only our right but it is our duty (if we desire<lb/> success) to use
                the <hi rend="underline">suaviter<add>?</add> in modo</hi> to flatter<lb/> (not at
                the expense of principle) the petty vanities of<lb/> those among whom we live and to
                bend these very<lb/> follies to our own use. If a man wants to be servic-<lb/>able
                in his calling—be it what it may—he<lb/> must command the love and respect of
                those<lb/> among whom his lot is cast; and to do this<lb/> he must be firm—honest
                &amp; honorable—and he<lb/> must also yield to their wishes in <hi rend="underline"
                    >minor</hi> things.<lb/> But excuse me. I may perhaps tire you, but at<lb/> any
                rate be assured that all that I do say<lb/> is prompted by a sincere friendship and
                a<lb/> desire for your welfare &amp; happiness.</p>
            <p>I would beg you to be <hi rend="underline">sure</hi> of success before<lb/> you
                undertake any of the new works you now<lb/> propose. Continue if possible the
                Occident.<lb/> Send it hereafter to <persName>Mr. D. L. Cohen</persName>,
                    <placeName>Savannah Geo.</placeName><lb/> who you may put down as a permanent,
                paying<lb/> subscriber. My family join in kindest regards.</p>
