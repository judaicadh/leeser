            <p>Reverend Sir!</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Since you have been kind<lb/> enough to insert my letters in your
                magazine<lb/> I continue to write on my subject without any<lb/> farther
                    <del>introduction</del> preface or <del>excuse</del> apology; you may only<lb/>
                please to recollect, that <del>we</del> I have stated in my<lb/> last, that Judaism
                rests upon four strong and<lb/> immovable pillars, 1. God is God, 2. man is<lb/> His
                    <sic>immage</sic>, 3. man is accountable here and hereË¶<lb/>after to his Maker,
                and 4. <placeName>Israel</placeName> is His own<lb/> people. All the duties of a man
                and an Israelite in<lb/> all <del>positions</del> estimations of life are deducible
                from those<lb/> four <del>theses</del> positions, &amp; all the hopes in life and
                death, the<lb/> confidence, the fortitude, the moral strength, the joy<lb/>
                <del>happiness</del> of heart of an Israel<add>ite</add>
                <del>and his individuals</del><lb/> are based upon those doctrines. It would
                surprise<lb/> me if any one should <del>detect a human duty</del> be able to point
                out as high duty obligatory on man or any<lb/> moral excellency, <del>for</del>
                which one can not be accounted for<lb/>
                <del>by</del> upon one either or all of those <del>theses</del> principles. We have
                no difference of opinion<lb/>
                <del>dispute</del>, I believe, about the first <del>thesis</del> axiom; but
                with<lb/> the second and third <del>are</del> the differences commence;<lb/>
                <del>the</del> our opponents tell us, that <del>the body of</del> man, in his
                body,<lb/> will arise at some distant day, being then inhabited<lb/> by the same
                soul; &amp; that he will live nearly in the<lb/> same manner as we do now; In
                    <sic>connexion</sic> with<lb/> this resurrection of the body is the last
                judgment<lb/> and the everlasting <sic>demnation</sic> of those who deserve<lb/>
                such a deplorable lot; <del>and yet</del> besides other things of the<lb/> same
                kind. We suppose, that our opponents<lb/> take for granted, that if the soul of man
                be<lb/> perishable and die away, a resurrection of the body would<lb/> be
                impossible, wherefore they must <del>say</del> give with us in maintaining that<lb/>
                "The soul of man is immortal &amp; can exist and<lb/> exists without body; but that
                the body of man is</p>
            <pb n="1V"/>
            <p>a subject to mortality &amp; cannot exist in <del>his</del><lb/> its proper functions
                without the soul;" thus we <del>are</del> have<lb/>
                <del>satisfied about</del> established the main point, the very basis of
                    <del>things</del> our discussion.<lb/> This dogma of ours is <del>a biblical
                    one</del> derived from the Bible, where man is<lb/> called an <sic>immage</sic>
                of God; but the dogma of an<lb/> immortal body appears to us to be of no biblical
                origin<lb/> as every impartial student of the Bible will admit, and<lb/> you,
                reverend sir, have <del>yet</del> not yet come out with your<lb/> biblical
                evidences. I shall first consider the matter<lb/> in a natural point of view; for it
                appears to me, that<lb/> the Rabbis expressed the most correct opinion on the<lb/>
                matter, when they said <add>×× ×× ××××× ×× × ×ª× ××× ××× ×××××ª</add><lb/>

                swamps, large<lb/> districts covered with perpetual snow and ice<lb/> and other
                uninhabitable portions. The present<lb/> population of our globe is

                give a population of 72 to<lb/> a square mile, if the resurrection take place<lb/>
                in our age; none of our friends has ever<lb/> lost himself so far in mystical
                conjectures,<lb/> as to think it natural, that such a popu-<lb/>lation should exist
