				<p rend="align(center)"><hi rend="underline">No 111</hi></p>
				<p rend="align(center)">To the Editor of the Occident</p>
				<p>Reverend Sir&#33;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Since you have been kind<lb/> enough to insert my letters in your magazine<lb/> I continue to write on my subject without any<lb/> farther <del>introduction</del> preface or <del>excuse</del> apology&#59; you may only<lb/> please to recollect&#44; that <del>we</del> I have stated in my<lb/> last&#44; that Judaism rests upon four strong and<lb/> immovable pillars&#44; 1. God is God&#44; 2. man is<lb/> His <sic>immage</sic>&#44; 3. man is accountable here and here&#758;<lb/>after to his Maker&#44; and 4. <placeName>Israel</placeName> is His own<lb/> people.  All the duties of a man and an Israelite in<lb/> all <del>positions</del> estimations of life are deducible from those<lb/> four <del>theses</del> positions&#44; &#38; all the hopes in life and death&#44; the<lb/> confidence&#44; the fortitude&#44; the moral strength&#44; the joy<lb/> <del>happiness</del> of heart of an Israel<add>ite</add> <del>and his individuals</del><lb/> are based upon those doctrines.  It would surprise<lb/> me if any one should <del>detect a human duty</del> be able to point out as high duty obligatory on man or any<lb/> moral excellency&#44; <del>for</del> which one can not be accounted for<lb/> <del>by</del> upon one either or all of those <del>theses</del> principles.  We have no difference of opinion<lb/> <del>dispute</del>&#44; I believe&#44; about the first <del>thesis</del> axiom&#59; but with<lb/> the second and third <del>are</del> the differences commence&#59;<lb/> <del>the</del> our opponents tell us&#44; that <del>the body of</del> man&#44; in his body&#44;<lb/> will arise at some distant day&#44; being then inhabited<lb/> by the same soul&#59; &#38; that he will live nearly in the<lb/> same manner as we do now&#59;  In <sic>connexion</sic> with<lb/> this resurrection of the body is the last judgment<lb/> and the everlasting <sic>demnation</sic> of those who deserve<lb/> such a deplorable lot&#59; <del>and yet</del> besides other things of the<lb/> same kind.  We suppose&#44; that our opponents<lb/> take for granted&#44; that if the soul of man be<lb/> perishable and die away&#44; a resurrection of the body would<lb/> be impossible&#44; wherefore they must <del>say</del> give with us in maintaining that<lb/> &#34;The soul of man is immortal &#38; can exist and<lb/> exists without body&#59; but that the body of man is</p>
			<pb n="1V"/>
				<p>a subject to mortality &#38; cannot exist in <del>his</del><lb/> its proper functions without the soul&#59;&#34; thus we <del>are</del> have<lb/> <del>satisfied about</del> established the main point&#44; the very basis of <del>things</del> our discussion.<lb/>  This dogma of ours is <del>a biblical one</del> derived from the Bible&#44; where man is<lb/> called an <sic>immage</sic> of God&#59; but the dogma of an<lb/> immortal body appears to us to be of no biblical origin<lb/> as every impartial student of the Bible will admit&#44; and<lb/> you&#44; reverend sir&#44; have <del>yet</del> not yet come out with your<lb/> biblical evidences.  I shall first consider the matter<lb/> in a natural point of view&#59; for it appears to me&#44; that<lb/> the Rabbis expressed the most correct opinion on the<lb/> matter&#44; when they said <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> &#34;All <sic>The</sic> prophets prophesied only for the times of the<lb/> Messiah&#44; but the future world no eye has ever seen<lb/> it but saw shine alone  &#758;O Lord<add>&#63;</add>&#34; &#40;Berachoth 34&#41; Hence<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> &#34;It was taught &#40;by the earlier Rabbis&#41; that during the<lb/> months &#40;after death&#41; the body remains uncorrup&#45;<lb/>ted&#59; and <del>his</del> the soul ascends and descends &#40;visiting the<lb/> spot where <del>his</del> its former <del>vehicle</del> tenement is <del>interred</del> buried&#41;&#59; but after<lb/> two<add>&#63;</add> months the body is dissolved and <del>his</del> the<lb/> soul ascends to return never again.&#34; Sabbath 151&#41;<lb/> Hence we read in Moreh Nebuchim of <persName>maimonides</persName><lb/> Part I. ch. 40 <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> &#34;The noun <hi rend="underline">Rusach</hi> is also the name of that<lb/> substance which <del>is</del> remains of man after death<lb/> and which is not <del>exposed</del> liable to dissolution&#44;&#34; and<lb/> &#40;<hi rend="underline">ibid</hi> 41 chapter xli&#41; we read the same definition<lb/> of the term <add>Hebrew</add>.  I shall say nothing about<lb/> the <add>Hebrew</add> that the bodies of the dead<lb/> must roll themselves through <del>caves</del> subterranean channels to <placeName>Palestine</placeName><lb/> where they will be revived&#44; nor about the</p>
			<pb n="2R"/>
				<p>opinion <add>Hebrew</add> that the pious who have arisen<lb/> from death will be assembled in a tent made<lb/> of the skin of the Leviathan&#44; and that they will<lb/> eat at a great feast the flesh of that <del>very</del><lb/> fabulous fish&#44; which was killed and salted<lb/> by God for this purpose soon after the<lb/> creation&#59; though these are substantial<lb/> portions of the resurrection&#45;creed of those&#44; which<lb/> you please to call orthodox&#44; because they try<lb/> to explain those singular assertions to be of a<lb/> parabolic nature&#59; but we have the same right to<lb/> say all statements about the revival of the body<lb/> are of the same nature.  I shall confine myself<lb/> exclusively to the question of the resurrection of the<lb/> body.  The surface of the earth contains one hundred and fifty six million&#44; two hundred fifty thousand<lb/> <del>156 250 000</del> square miles of land including<lb/> <del>the</del> the vast regions of sandy deserts&#44; stony<lb/> mountains&#44; marshes and swamps&#44; large<lb/> districts covered with perpetual snow and ice<lb/> and other uninhabitable portions.  The present<lb/> population of our globe is <sic>estemated</sic> <del>1200000000</del> twelve hundred millions&#59;<lb/> if we suppose <del>that</del> one generation <del>take</del> to be<lb/> 30 years&#44; and that since the creation of<lb/> man be <date>5611</date> years&#44; there must have been then<lb/> our earth 187 generations&#44; which would give<del>s</del> the sum<lb/> of individuals <hi rend="underline">1200&#44;000&#44;000x187</hi><lb/>2&#42;&#61;112200000000&#44;<lb/> which would give a population of 72 to<lb/> a square mile&#44; if the resurrection take place<lb/> in our age&#59; none of our friends has ever<lb/> lost himself so far in mystical conjectures&#44;<lb/> as to think it natural&#44; that such a popu&#45;<lb/>lation should exist on earth.  Our old<lb/> brethren have two different methods to help<lb/> themselves out of this difficulty&#59; they say <hi rend="underline">first</hi><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add></p>
				<p rend="The following is a note in the right margin&#44; near the bottom of the page.">&#42; There is <add>&#63;</add><lb/>ly an error in <persName>D W&#39;s</persName><lb/> formula here&#44; we see<lb/> no reason for dividing<lb/> the product by two&#59;<lb/> our calculation<lb/> <del>would</del> the population<lb/> after these dates<lb/> 1436 to a square<lb/> mile.</p>
			<pb n="2V"/>
				<p>&#34;<del>It be</del> know<del>n</del> that the world to come is<lb/> made for none but the righteous and the<lb/> Isralites&#34; &#40;Jebanoth 46.&#41;.  But this is not in<lb/> <sic>accordence</sic> with the passage in <persName>Daniel</persName>&#44; which<lb/> they suppose to be the expressive of the doctrine<lb/> of the <sic>resurection</sic> of the body.  &#34;And many of<lb/> those who sleep in the dust of the ground<lb/> he shall awake&#44; some to an everlasting<lb/> life and some to shame and everlasting<lb/> reproach&#34; &#40;<persName>Daniel</persName> IIX 2&#41; If our friends will<lb/> insist <del>admit</del>&#44; that <persName>Daniel</persName> speaks in this chapter only<lb/> of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; then they cannot help saying but that<lb/> only many of <placeName>Israel</placeName> will arise&#59; some of these<lb/> who arise<del>n</del> <del>individuals</del> will be a shame and an<lb/> everlasting reproach&#44; consequently they must ad&#45;<lb/>mit&#44; that among those what will arise will be<lb/> wicked people also&#59; to <del>say</del> assert the wicked shall<lb/> arise and die again is incompatible with the<lb/> text&#44; in which the <add>Hebrew</add> &#34;everlasting&#34; prohibits such<lb/> a construction.  And if this contradiction<lb/> <del>should</del> is not to exist&#44; our old friends cannot remove<lb/> the difficulty by the above quoted conjecture&#59;<lb/> for it is <del>sure enough</del> unquestionable&#44; that five children die to<lb/> one grown person&#44; and what wrong can a<lb/> child have done&#63; and among the rest of<lb/> <del>people</del> mankind they must reckon <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> &#34;one half innocent and one other half guilty&#34;&#44; which<lb/> is a strict talmudical principle&#59; consequently<lb/> the immense <sic>numbre</sic> of 720 to a square<lb/> mile would be immaterially reduced.  They<lb/> cannot remove this difficulty by conjecturing&#44;<lb/> that them who has <del>a</del>risen <del>people</del> will be of such a<lb/> spiritual nature&#44; that they have no wants<lb/> whatever&#59; for this would be no resurrection<lb/> of the same body&#44; but a new creation&#59;</p>
