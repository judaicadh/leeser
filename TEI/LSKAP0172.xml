			<p rend="indent(1)">dear uncle</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">What is the reason that I hear so seldom from you lately&#63;  People ask<lb/> me how is your uncle&#63;  I tell them I hope he is well but in truth I cannot tell<lb/> since I hear so little from you&#44; and then you write such short letters that I<lb/> really do not learn many particulars.  Do let us know how you feel and all the folks<lb/> at home.  The short winter days are pretty much spent by <sic>e</sic> in constant  occupation<lb/> as I rise about half past seven&#44; read the paper&#44; say my prayers&#44; eat my breakfast<lb/> go up to my boys at 9&#44; stay with them till half past 12&#44; go about my little<lb/> business&#44; <add>&#63;</add> &#189; before three&#44; again at my lessons till<lb/> dark&#44; and now as the clock is striking fore<add>&#63;</add> my boys have been gone about fifteen<lb/> minutes.  My school now consists of two sons of <persName>Mr. Allen</persName>&#44; paying 10&#45;20&#59; and<lb/> one of <persName>Mr. Heickenbury</persName> 10&#59; of <persName>Mr. D. Tobisson</persName> 10&#59; one of the late Hazan <persName>Keys</persName> 10&#59;<lb/> two of <persName>Mr. Spier</persName> at 6&#45;12&#59; one of <persName>Mr. Zachariah</persName> 6&#59; one of <persName>Mr. Mansheim</persName> &#40;came<lb/> yesterday&#41; at 5&#59; one of <persName>Mr. Sweetzer</persName> at 7&#44; one of <persName>Mr. Isaacs</persName> at 7&#44; of <persName>Mr. Asch</persName><lb/> &#40;under 5 years&#41; at 6 &#188; equal to 93 &#188; Dollars per quarter&#59; <persName>Mr. Goldsmits</persName> sons has<lb/> been sick for some days&#44; and his father found fault with the price&#44; but would<lb/> not ask for an abatement&#44; on account of inability to pay&#44; &#40;being able if<lb/> willing&#41; I do not <sic>kno w</sic> whether he will return or not&#59; if he should return<lb/> and also <persName>Henry Spyers</persName> the gratis scholar I shall have 14 in all paying about<lb/> 103 Dollars&#59; I have lst 2 sons of <persName>Mr. Stork</persName>&#59; one of <persName>Mr. Weil</persName> and one of<lb/> <persName>Mr. Van Allen</persName>&#44; the three first because parents took offence at nothing&#44; and the<lb/> last because he would not come to school&#44; and being past thirteen his father<lb/> thinks of putting him to a severe master who will teach him a trade and make<lb/> him behave.  If even the whole were now here it would be but 18&#44; and so you<lb/> can see what uphill work my school is in this place.  <persName>Mr. Peixotto&#39;s</persName> newphs<add>&#63;</add> has<lb/> not yet come&#59; I presume he has not yet heard from <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>.  <persName>Mr. Allen&#39;s</persName><lb/> younger son also has been sent to a girl&#39;s school my charges being too high&#44;<lb/> and other people have not yet made up their mind whether to encourage my<lb/> undertaking or not.  However having once begun&#44; I mean to continue for the<lb/> present&#44; as I have nothing to do and I may as well do that as n<add>&#63;</add>ing&#44; even if<lb/> I cannot succeed in doing any good.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I see by the <placeName>New York</placeName> <sic>Courrier</sic> yesterday morning that <persName>Prentiss<lb/> Chubb</persName> died there&#44; I believe on <date>Saturday</date>&#59; his age stated at 30 but this<lb/> must be a mistake&#44; I should rather judge 36 or 8.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Among our congregation nothing of importance has occurred&#44; we have<lb/> had 6 funerals since <date>Rosh Hashannah</date>&#44; and 6 Berits and 6 girls were born.  I<lb/> married 3 couples <persName>Mr. Mordecai</persName> one and the German congregation married 4&#59;<lb/> how many funerals and namings they had I do not know&#44; as those honorable <sic>gentlemn</sic><lb/> with few exceptions seldom do me the honour of an invitation.  You can see from<lb/> this short view that there must be a considerable number of Jews in this place.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Mrs Cozens</persName> sends her best regards to you and wishes to know when you<lb/> intend paying us a visit.  <persName>Mrs Joseph</persName> told me when last seen by me to give her<lb/> love to you whenever I write&#59; charming woman that&#44; quite a lady &#38; so on.  She is<lb/> much like her brother and looks a great deal like him.  <persName>Mrs. Carvalho&#39;s</persName> little boy<lb/> &#40;about 9 months old&#41; died on <date>Friday</date> week of dropsy in the head.  At the same time<lb/> that the above child was <sic>burried</sic> another of <persName>Mr. Isaac</persName> <add>&#63;</add>. <persName>Phillips</persName> &#40;who<lb/> formerly lived in <placeName>Richmond</placeName>&#41; was also interred.  The second one out of three<lb/> children that died since last <date>September</date>.  Only one of his three sons is now<lb/> living&#44; and he was sick at the time the other died but I believe he is now<lb/> better.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I have not made nay further stir about my discourses&#44; but I think<lb/> that in a few days I shall <sic>bee</sic> more about it.  You may be sure that I shall<lb/> endeavor to see my way clear before I have a touched or a ream of<lb/> paper bought&#44; and I shall send prospectuses to others besides our Rev. friend</p>

				<p>I.B.S.  I last <date>Sabbatt</date> the 3 rd <del> <add>&#63;</add> </del> sermon of the series on the Messiah&#59;<lb/> finding I do not see the first ones as I go on&#44; I shall endeavor to send you those<lb/> finished as soon as I can&#44; in about three weeks when I hope to have a<lb/> safe opportunity.  My ladies class for learning Hebrew had not yet been formed<lb/> as <hi rend="underline">six</hi> the number wished cannot wait to learn what they all profess to be so<lb/> anxious to know.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">How is <persName>Aunt R</persName>&#63;  Has she quite recovered&#63;  Please to give my love<lb/> to her and to all the family.  Are all well there&#63;</p>
