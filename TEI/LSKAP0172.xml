            <p rend="indent(1)">dear uncle</p>
            <p rend="indent(2)">What is the reason that I hear so seldom from you lately? People
                ask<lb/> me how is your uncle? I tell them I hope he is well but in truth I cannot
                tell<lb/> since I hear so little from you, and then you write such short letters
                that I<lb/> really do not learn many particulars. Do let us know how you feel and
                all the folks<lb/> at home. The short winter days are pretty much spent by
                    <sic>e</sic> in constant occupation<lb/> as I rise about half past seven, read
                the paper, say my prayers, eat my breakfast<lb/> go up to my boys at 9, stay with
                them till half past 12, go about my little<lb/> business, <add>?</add> ½ before
                three, again at my lessons till<lb/> dark, and now as the clock is striking
                    fore<add>?</add> my boys have been gone about fifteen<lb/> minutes. My school
                now consists of two sons of <persName>Mr. Allen</persName>, paying 10-20; and<lb/>
                one of <persName>Mr. Heickenbury</persName> 10; of <persName>Mr. D.
                    Tobisson</persName> 10; one of the late Hazan <persName>Keys</persName> 10;<lb/>
                two of <persName>Mr. Spier</persName> at 6-12; one of <persName>Mr.
                    Zachariah</persName> 6; one of <persName>Mr. Mansheim</persName> (came<lb/>
                yesterday) at 5; one of <persName>Mr. Sweetzer</persName> at 7, one of <persName>Mr.
                    Isaacs</persName> at 7, of <persName>Mr. Asch</persName><lb/> (under 5 years) at
                6 ¼ equal to 93 ¼ Dollars per quarter; <persName>Mr. Goldsmits</persName> sons
                has<lb/> been sick for some days, and his father found fault with the price, but
                would<lb/> not ask for an abatement, on account of inability to pay, (being able
                if<lb/> willing) I do not <sic>kno w</sic> whether he will return or not; if he
                should return<lb/> and also <persName>Henry Spyers</persName> the gratis scholar I
                shall have 14 in all paying about<lb/> 103 Dollars; I have lst 2 sons of
                    <persName>Mr. Stork</persName>; one of <persName>Mr. Weil</persName> and one of<lb/>
                <persName>Mr. Van Allen</persName>, the three first because parents took offence at
                nothing, and the<lb/> last because he would not come to school, and being past
                thirteen his father<lb/> thinks of putting him to a severe master who will teach him
                a trade and make<lb/> him behave. If even the whole were now here it would be but
                18, and so you<lb/> can see what uphill work my school is in this place.
                    <persName>Mr. Peixotto's</persName> newphs<add>?</add> has<lb/> not yet come; I
                presume he has not yet heard from <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>. <persName>Mr.
                    Allen's</persName><lb/> younger son also has been sent to a girl's school my
                charges being too high,<lb/> and other people have not yet made up their mind
                whether to encourage my<lb/> undertaking or not. However having once begun, I mean
                to continue for the<lb/> present, as I have nothing to do and I may as well do that
                as n<add>?</add>ing, even if<lb/> I cannot succeed in doing any good.</p>

                <sic>Courrier</sic> yesterday morning that <persName>Prentiss<lb/> Chubb</persName>
                died there, I believe on <date>Saturday</date>; his age stated at 30 but this<lb/>
                must be a mistake, I should rather judge 36 or 8.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Among our congregation nothing of importance has occurred, we
                have<lb/> had 6 funerals since <date>Rosh Hashannah</date>, and 6 Berits and 6 girls
                were born. I<lb/> married 3 couples <persName>Mr. Mordecai</persName> one and the
                German congregation married 4;<lb/> how many funerals and namings they had I do not
                know, as those honorable <sic>gentlemn</sic><lb/> with few exceptions seldom do me
                the honour of an invitation. You can see from<lb/> this short view that there must
                be a considerable number of Jews in this place.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Mrs Cozens</persName> sends her best regards to you and
                wishes to know when you<lb/> intend paying us a visit. <persName>Mrs
                    Joseph</persName> told me when last seen by me to give her<lb/> love to you
                whenever I write; charming woman that, quite a lady &amp; so on. She is<lb/> much
                like her brother and looks a great deal like him. <persName>Mrs.
                    Carvalho's</persName> little boy<lb/> (about 9 months old) died on
                    <date>Friday</date> week of dropsy in the head. At the same time<lb/> that the
                above child was <sic>burried</sic> another of <persName>Mr. Isaac</persName>

                three<lb/> children that died since last <date>September</date>. Only one of his
                three sons is now<lb/> living, and he was sick at the time the other died but I
                believe he is now<lb/> better.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I have not made nay further stir about my discourses, but I
                think<lb/> that in a few days I shall <sic>bee</sic> more about it. You may be sure
                that I shall<lb/> endeavor to see my way clear before I have a touched or a ream
                of<lb/> paper bought, and I shall send prospectuses to others besides our Rev.
