				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>Cincinnati</placeName> <date>October 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1861</date>.</p>
				<p>Reverend Sir&#44;</p>
				<p>As I see by the last number of the Occident you received<lb/> the copy of the Israelite&#44; sent to you by me and contain&#45;<lb/>ing my refutation of <persName>Mr de Solla&#39;s</persName> pamphlet For you<lb/> devoted the full space of 9 words or the most of a Line<lb/> and a half to the <sic>critick</sic> of my article.</p>
				<p>If I apply the rule of our Sages&#58; <add>Hebrew</add> to your article<lb/> headed &#8222;Incestuous Marriages&#8221;&#44; and I cannot see any reason<lb/> why I should not apply it&#44; my refutation has not found<lb/> grace before your editorial eyes.</p>
				<p>You say&#58; &#8222;But this far the more complete and therefore<lb/> the more desirable response has appeared in the pub<lb/>lication&#8221; I have not seen <persName>Mr Nathan&#39;s</persName> or any one&#39;s else<lb/> reply beside mine and am therefore of course not able to<lb/> judge&#44; how complete <persName>Mr N&#39;s</persName> reply is.  Your critic on <persName>Mr<lb/> N&#39;s</persName> pamphlet&#44; although covering full 2 pages of your<lb/> journal can guide me by no means&#44; since your critic can<lb/> not claim any higher merit but to be a friend&#39;s eulogy on<lb/> the work of his friend and it is only fit to show that<lb/> you are on very good terms with and an admirer or intimate<lb/> friend of <persName>Mr N.</persName> Anything like an evidence of an impar<lb/>tial&#44; <hi rend="underline">objective</hi> <sic>critick</sic> by quotations from the criticized<lb/> work the reader seeks in vain in your article.</p>
				<p>I have therefore to wait till I shall receive <persName>Mr N&#39;s</persName> pam<lb/>phlet&#44; in order to find out myself&#44; if your opinion on the completeness</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>if the said pamphlet is correct or not.</p>
				<p>But I think myself justified in not only <hi rend="underline">inviting you very</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">politely</hi>&#44; but in <hi rend="underline">requesting you most urgently and positively</hi>&#44;<lb/> <hi rend="underline">to point out to me the incompleteness of my refutation</hi>&#44; viz<lb/> <hi rend="underline">to show</hi> that <hi rend="underline">I have either not refuted all arguments of</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline"><persName>Mr de Solla</persName> or that I have done so in an unsatisfactory way</hi>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">If you are not <sic>abe</sic> to do so&#44; you must acknowledge<lb/> the error or wrong of your indirect assertion.</p>
				<p>I hardly think it necessary to remind you that if all<lb/> pretended proofs of <persName>de Solla</persName> are satisfactorily refuted by<lb/> my article&#44; this my article has the same claim on complete<lb/>ness as a refutation filing a whole volume.</p>
				<p>If it were not for so many people who have no<lb/> <sic>judgement</sic> of their own&#44; who always inquire in a refutation&#44;<lb/> if every passage of the refuted work is mentioned and opposed<lb/> to and with whom no article filling only one column has<lb/> any weight at all&#44; since they measure the weight of an<lb/> article by the inch of the foot&#44;&#8212;I say&#44; if it were not for<lb/> those&#44; a single column of the Israelite&#44; containing only<lb/> the 2 proofs of <add>Hebrew</add> and <add>Hebrew</add> would have been<lb/> fully sufficient to cause the 2 pillars of <persName>de Sollas</persName> struc<lb/>ture to fall to the ground.  Every competent judge would<lb/> still have declared my refutation satisfactory and complete.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Yea&#44; I dare say&#44; truly qualified judges would prefer<lb/> such a refutation&#44; since it would be more in correspon<lb/>dence with the words of our Sages <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add></p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>As you assuredly acknowledge the validity of this rule&#44; you<lb/> must have found other defects in my article&#44; than its brevity and<lb/> I therefore repeat my <hi rend="underline">urgent request&#44; to name those defects to me</hi>.</p>
				<p>I have not the pleasure of knowing <persName>Mr Nathan</persName> nor have<lb/> I ever seen his newly published work or any other work of his.<lb/>  I can therefore not <del>judge</del> yet able to judge how &#8222;fully&#8221; he is &#8222;armed for the<lb/> contest in behalf of Jewish purity.&#8221;</p>
				<p>But if you have an <sic>infavorable</sic> opinion of my armature&#44; as<lb/> this can be easily inferred from you article&#44; this your opinion can<lb/> only have been produced by weak points&#44; found out in my recently<lb/> published article.  For you never had any other chance to judge<lb/> of my knowledge of our theology.  We met each other only twice in our life once in <placeName>Boston</placeName> and the second time here.  <del>But</del><lb/> But neither time we discussed one topic or even one Iota of any <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> or <add>Hebrew</add></p>
				<p>I therefore feel myself induced to <hi rend="underline">ask you again&#44; to point me</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">out the errors of my refutation</hi>.</p>
				<p>The great merit of <persName>Mr N&#39;s</persName> pamphlet in coming out in the<lb/> country&#59; where his antagonist resides I fully acknowledge.<lb/>  But I could not help well my refutation lacking this ex<lb/>cellent quality&#44; since&#44; of course&#44; I cannot be expected to<lb/> go especially from here to <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> in order to publish my<lb/> refutation there.</p>
				<p>And&#44; after all&#44; allow me&#44; Rev. Sir&#44; to remark you in all sub<lb/>missive reverence that you are here again in contradiction with<lb/> the words of our Sages&#44; a fact which is&#44; of course&#44; most surprising<lb/> in the champion and defender of our Orthodox cause.</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>In corroboration of this my remark I refer you to the Mishna <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> and the annotation of the Gemara to this Mishna&#58;<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>.</p>
				<p>As I have now mentioned often enough&#44; I cannot judge of the val<lb/>idity of your indirect reproofs of my refutation&#44; until you please to<lb/> <hi rend="underline">enumerate me all its faults in plain language</hi>.</p>
				<p>But I come lastly to another indirect reproof which I am fully justi<lb/>fied to contradict <hi rend="underline">flatly</hi> and <hi rend="underline">emphatically</hi> already now.</p>
				<p>You are pleased to say&#58; In doing this&#44; moreover&#44; we discover nothing<lb/> like personality and bitterness against the aggressor&#44; as the whole<lb/> &#8222;force of proofs is directed against the matter not the man.&#8221;<lb/>  Now&#44; do tell me&#44; Mr Editor&#44; where have you found one word of per<lb/>sonalities or bitterness in my article&#63;  Have I not treated the author<lb/> in the most polite manner and have only cared for the subject<lb/> not for the man who brought it forward&#63;  Have I not also pointed<lb/> this out in my refutation itself&#63;</p>
				<p>Perhaps you feel inclined to deny all intentional slight treatment<lb/> of my refutation&#44; by referring me to the final passage of your ar<lb/>ticle from&#58; &#8222;Our limited space&#8221; to the end.  But I hardly think it<lb/> possible that you believe me green enough&#44; as not to know that<lb/> the whole alluded conclusion of your article consists in mere words with<lb/>out having any serious meaning at all.  Or should you&#44; after having<lb/> waited on your readers with such a critic and such arguments as yours<lb/> are&#44; still have such a favorable opinion of your readers&#44; as to think them<lb/> capable to judge of the various publications for themselves&#63;  They would<lb/> then make a splendid exception of the majority of American and Eu<lb/>ropean Jews.  While in our days <add>Hebrew</add> are very scarce every where&#44; the<lb/> majority of your readers&#44; if not all&#44; would be <add>Hebrew</add>.<lb/>  You say&#44; your <hi rend="underline">limited space compelled you to treat the subject</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">briefly</hi>&#44; and every one who casts only a glance at the last number<lb/> of the Occident must acknowledge the correctness of your statement&#44;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">For&#44; had you not to benefit the Jewish community of <placeName>America</placeName><lb/> and abroad by devoting almost 5 pages to a minute description of the<lb/> &#8222;Presentation of a Sepher in <placeName>San Francisco</placeName>&#8221; and by devoting another<lb/> page and 1&#47;3 to a report on the <sic>extremly</sic> <del>scarce</del> rare and therefore highly<lb/> surprising occurrence of a <add>Hebrew</add> in <placeName>Norfolk Str.</placeName> Synagogue</p>
			<pb n="5"/>
				<p>just think what our Orthodox cause would have lost&#44; if those 2<lb/> matters had not become known&#33;  Of course have they the preference<lb/> to a full treatment of the Mamzer<add>&#63;</add> question and a proper critic on the<lb/> different articles&#44; speaking on this subject&#33;&#33;&#33;</p>
				<p>In order to show you that in writing all&#44; I have written in this letter<lb/> I am not guided by partiality for my own slight work&#44; I shall ex<lb/>tract some passages of a letter&#44; I have received from a truly Orthodox<lb/> scholar.</p>
				<p>I am not at liberty to mention you the name of the writer&#44; since<lb/> perhaps he does not want me to do so.  Suffice it&#44; to say&#44; that the alluded<lb/> Gentleman ranks high in our Orthodox camp and I doubt not that you<lb/> and I wish many others consider him an authority.</p>
				<p>He wrote to me&#58;</p>
				<p>The papers you have sent me have come to hand&#44; I congratulate<lb/> you on the <hi rend="underline">tone</hi> of your article.  The <persName>Rev. Mr Nathan&#39;s</persName> preface&#8212;his<lb/> work itself I have not seen&#8212;is too personal&#44; whereas you are free<lb/> of sarcasm and bitterness.&#8221;</p>
				<p>At the end of the letter he wrote to me&#58;</p>
				<p>I again repeat&#44; of the replies I have hitherto seen yours is by<lb/> far the best so that <persName>Mr de Solla</persName> will have to acknowledge&#44; that of<lb/> his opponents you are the most gentlemanly.&#8221;</p>
				<p>In fine I ask you politely&#44; to <hi rend="underline">send me a copy of <persName>Mr Nathan&#39;s</persName></hi></p>
			<pb n="6"/>
				<p><hi rend="underline">pamphlet</hi> and to let me know the price thereof and in what<lb/> way I can remit the money to you.  If you have an agent<lb/> here&#44; please mention me his name and I shall pay him the<lb/> amount or send me the pamphlet through his agency.</p>
				<p>Asking you again to <hi rend="underline">point me out the defects of my re</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">futation</hi> either in a private letter or publicly in your<lb/> Journal.</p>
				<p>I am&#44; Rev. Sir&#44; your obedient</p>
