			<p>own means its own purposes. For I would ask<lb/> where it is that those who use this
				argument would<lb/> draw the line&#63; I have told you that in
					<placeName>France</placeName> they<lb/> hold all offices to which Frenchmen are
				admitted&#44;<lb/> and that more than one member of the Chambers<lb/> has been of
				the Jewish persuasion. Even in this<lb/> country we have much relaxed the rigor of
				our en&#45;<lb/>actments respecting them. A Jew has been a ma&#45;<lb/>gistrate&#44;
				a Jew has been a sheriff. By a late statute&#44;<lb/> which was introduced by the
				right hon. member for<lb/>
				<placeName>Tamworth</placeName>&#44; Jews may hold offices in corporations&#44;<lb/>
				and it was but the other day that a Jew was admit&#45;<lb/>ted to the office of
				alderman in the corporation of the<lb/> city of <placeName>London</placeName>.
				&#40;Hear&#44; hear.&#41; I ask you what<lb/> right or business have you to
				interpret a prophecy so<lb/> as to draw the line between an alderman and a
				com&#45;<lb/>missioner of customs&#8212;between a justice of the peace<lb/> and a
				person having a right to sit in Parliament&#63;<lb/> &#40;Hear&#44; hear.&#41; What
				enabled you or authorized you<lb/> to say where the line intended by the
				prophecies<lb/> should be drawn&#44; and how can you take upon your&#45;<lb/>selves
				to draw the limits of the line the Almighty<lb/> intended to mark out&#63;
				&#40;Cheers.&#41; It would be&#44; in<lb/> respect to the Almighty being&#44; to</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><quote>&#34;Strike from his hand the balance and the rod&#44;</quote></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><quote>&#34;Rejudge his justice&#8212;be the God of God.&#34;</quote></p>
			<p>I trust that no such presumption will fail to our lot&#8212;<lb/> that we shall do
				that which we think our duty to our<lb/> fellow countrymen&#44; and the best for the
				country ac&#45;<lb/>cording to our imperfect reason&#44; and rest in pious<lb/> but
				humble confidence that the Almighty will accom&#45;<lb/>plish his purpose by means
				best known to his wis&#45;<lb/>dom. &#40;Cheers.&#41; But&#44; Sir&#44; there is
				that which I can<lb/> hardly call an argument&#44; but which operates more<lb/>
				against those whose cause I have undertaken perhaps<lb/> than any other thing. There
				is a popular prejudice<lb/> against the name of the Jew founded upon various<lb/>
				circumstances to which I need not allude&#8212;founded<lb/> upon what I think a
				mistaken view of Sacred Writ&#44;<lb/> and the dislike and distrust there is on the
				part of<lb/> men of a different religion. But that popular preju&#45;<lb/>dice which
				induced the Administration of <date>1753</date>&#44; after<lb/> passing an act for
				the naturalization of the Jews&#44; to<lb/> come down in a hurry&#44; in the next
				year&#44; for the pur&#45;<lb/>pose of repealing it&#44; has&#44; I believe&#44;
				very greatly died<lb/> away &#40;hear&#44; hear&#44;&#41;&#8212;that it has subsided
				in this me&#45;<lb/>tropolis I have with my own eyes a proof&#44; because a<lb/>
				gentleman in the city of <placeName>London</placeName>&#44; well known in that<lb/>
				city by his extensive transactions&#44; by his wealth&#44; his<lb/> charity and
				liberality&#44; was elected for that city by<lb/> nearly 7&#44;000 votes at the last
				general election.<lb/> &#40;Hear&#44; hear.&#41; I quote that as a proof that
				this<lb/> house would not be safe in saying&#8212;&#34;Such is our<lb/> opinion&#59;
				we are liberal&#59; we intend well to our Jew&#45;<lb/>ish fellow&#45;subjects&#44;
				but there is such a prejudice<lb/> amongst the people against them that it would
				not<lb/> be safe to legislate in their favor&#34; &#40;Hear&#44;
				hear.&#41;&#8212;<lb/> I warn hon. gentlemen not to rely upon that feeling&#44;<lb/>
				I believe that the people are to the full as enlight&#45;<lb/>ened as the members of
				this house. &#40;Hear.&#41; I be&#45;<lb/>lieve that the general opinion&#44; and
				the right and true<lb/> opinion&#44; as I conceive it to be&#44; is that religious
				opin&#45;<lb/>ions ought not to bring with them any penalty or<lb/> punishment.
				&#40;Hear&#44; hear.&#41; I believe that that is<lb/> the right and true
				opinion&#44; overbearing any preju&#45;<lb/>dice that may have existed against the
				Jews. &#40;Hear&#44;<lb/> hear.&#41; I have now&#44; sir&#44; stated to you the
				reasons<lb/> why I think that the objections which have been<lb/> made against the
				admission of the Jews are futile<lb/> and unfounded. If I am asked what are the
				prevail&#45;<lb/>ing reasons for the motion that I propose&#44; I appeal in<lb/> the
				first place to the constitution of these realms&#59; I<lb/> appeal to that
				constitution which is intended to give<lb/> to every man those rewards&#44; that
				honor&#44; that estima&#45;<lb/>tion to which his character and talents may
				entitle<lb/> him. &#40;Hear&#44; hear.&#41; I appeal to that constitution<lb/> which
				is the enemy of restriction or disqualification<lb/> &#40;hear&#41;&#59; to that
				constitution which by the abrogation<lb/> of the laws existing a few years ago has
				put an end<lb/> even to those cases of exception which our ancestors<lb/>
				thought&#44; upon the ground of imminent danger to the<lb/> state and church&#44;
				they were justified in imposing. I<lb/> ask you in the name of that constitution to
				take<lb/> away this last remnant of religious persecution&#44;<lb/> to show that you
				are not influenced by the num&#45;<lb/>bers or terrors that might make that which
				was an<lb/> act of political justice an act of political necessity.<lb/>
				&#40;Cheers.&#41; I ask you in the name of that constitution<lb/> to admit the Jews
				to all the privileges&#44; to all the rights&#44;<lb/> of which those who are not
				excluded from them are<lb/> so justly proud &#40;cheers&#41;&#59; and&#44; let me
				tell you&#44;<lb/> that you cannot judge of the feelings of those who<lb/> are
				excluded by the number of those who might wish<lb/> for seats in Parliament&#44; or
				who might aspire to hold<lb/> office under the Crown. Many a man who would<lb/> not
				seek for either&#44; would be content to pass his days<lb/> in obscurity&#44; and
				would wish for no other advanta&#45;<lb/>ges than those of private life&#59; but he
				feels the galling<lb/> degradation&#44; the brand that is imposed upon him&#44;
				when<lb/> he is told that men of all other classes&#44; men of the
				es&#45;<lb/>tablished church&#44; Protestant Dissenters and Roman<lb/>
				Catholics&#44; may all enter within these walls&#44; may all<lb/> enjoy those
				advantages&#44; but that he belongs to a sect<lb/> which by the law and constitution
				is proscribed and<lb/> degraded. &#40;Cheers.&#41; But I would make a still<lb/>
				higher appeal. I would make an appeal to the prin&#45;<lb/>ciples of that
				Christianity which has so long been<lb/> the law of the land. &#40;Cheers.&#41; I
				appeal to you&#44;<lb/> then&#44; in the name of that religion which is a
				religion<lb/> of charity and love&#44; &#34;to do unto others as you would<lb/> they
				should do unto you.&#34; &#40;Cheers.&#41; I ask you<lb/> why it is&#44; that when
				we are taught by examples and<lb/> parables that we ought to love our neighbors&#44;
				it is<lb/> not priests or Levites who are singled out as instan&#45;<lb/>ces for our
				approbation and admiration&#59; but it is one<lb/> of a proscribed sect&#8212;one
				who belonged to what was<lb/> then the refuge of all nations&#63; I ask why it is
				that we<lb/> are taught that all men are brothers&#8212;that there is no<lb/> part
				of the human race&#44; however divided from us by<lb/> feelings or color&#44; that
				ought to be separated from us&#63;<lb/> but that all belong to the family of
				man&#44; and ought<lb/> to be loved as brothers. &#40;Cheers.&#41; I ask
				you&#44;<lb/> therefore&#44; in the name of that constitution which is<lb/> the
				constitution of freedom&#44; of liberty&#44; and of justice<lb/>&#8212;I ask you in
				the name of that religion which is<lb/> the religion of peace and good will towards
				men&#8212;to<lb/> agree to the motion which I have the honor to make.<lb/> The noble
				lord then moved &#34;that the house should<lb/> resolve itself into a committee on
				the removal of the<lb/> civil and political disabilities affecting Her
				Majesty&#39;s<lb/> Jewish subjects&#44;&#34; and resumed his seat amidst loud<lb/>
				and continued cheers.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">A debate ensued in which several members took<lb/> part&#44; and it was adjourned
				over to the following day.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><persName>SIR ROBERT INGLIS</persName>&#44; in reply to <persName>Lord John<lb/>
					Russell</persName> said that the question was not one between<lb/> Christians
				and Jews&#44; but between Christians and<lb/> non&#45;Christians. Now&#44;
					<placeName>England</placeName> for years past had<lb/> not only had a
				constitution&#44; but also a Christian con&#45;<lb/>stitution&#44; and he defied
					<persName>Lord J. Russell</persName> to produce a<lb/> single instance in which
				the oath of office had not<lb/> always been taken upon some Christian symbol.
				It<lb/> might be true that <persName>David Hume</persName> and <persName>Edward
					Gibbon</persName><lb/> as infidels would not have scrupled to take at the<lb/>
				table the declaration now required by law&#59; but was<lb/> that a sufficient
				argument for blotting out of our stat&#45;<lb/>ute book a solemn declaration that
				our first duty as<lb/> legislators was to discharge our duties as Christian<lb/>
				men&#63; A Jew could not listen to our form of pray&#45;<lb/>er&#44; in which we
				called upon <persName>Christ</persName> to have mercy<lb/> upon us&#44; without
				either committing an awful blas&#45;<lb/>phemy&#44; or going through a deliberate
				mockery of<lb/> religion.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">He would not withhold these concessions from the<lb/> Jews on account of the
				smallness of their numbers<lb/> if he could believe them just&#59; but as he did
				not<lb/> think them so&#44; he thought he had a right to ask<lb/> whether it was
				either right or expedient to make<lb/> them to 20&#44;000 or 30&#44;000 or
				40&#44;000 persons at the<lb/> risk of exasperating 3&#44;000&#44;000 or
				4&#44;000&#44;000. He<lb/> had called the last bill introduced on this subject
				a<lb/> bill to enable <persName>Mr. Solamons</persName> to become an alderman<lb/>
				of <placeName>London</placeName>&#44; and he called this bill a bill to enable the<lb/>
				<persName>Baron L. de Rothschild</persName> to become a member of
				Par&#45;<lb/>liament. He then proceeded to show that the Jews<lb/> were a separate
				nation&#44; with a separate creed&#44; and<lb/> for that purpose read a letter from
				a Jewish rabbi&#44;</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
			<p>and an extract from the speech of <persName>John Duke</persName> of<lb/>
				<placeName>Bedford</placeName> against the Jew Bill of <date>1753</date>. He
				called<lb/> upon the House by every consideration of interest<lb/> and duty to pause
				before it changed the Christian<lb/> constitution of the Legislature&#44; and before
				it haz&#45;<lb/>arded the confidence of the people in the Christian<lb/>
				institutions of the empire.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Lord ASHLEY</persName> also opposed the motion. He con&#45;<lb/>tended that
				religion had a great deal to do with poli&#45;<lb/>tics&#8212;that the House knew
				that fact&#8212;and that it<lb/> proved it by every one of its daily actions.
					<persName>Mr.<lb/> Macaulay</persName> in an elaborate essay had declared
				that<lb/> Government by its <sic>essantial</sic> character was interdict&#45;<lb/>ed
				from contemplating and accomplishing Christian<lb/> ends&#59; but he well
				recollected that that distinguished<lb/> writer had in another speech declared that
				&#34;every&#45;<lb/>thing which lowered Christianity in <sic>pablic</sic>
				estima&#45;<lb/>tion was high treason against the civilization of
				man&#45;<lb/>kind.&#34; He then controverted <persName>Mr. Macaulay&#39;s</persName>
				doc&#45;<lb/>trine&#44; that to talk of Christian government was as<lb/> absurd as
				to talk of Christian cookery or of Christian<lb/> cobblery&#44; and passed a heavy
				censure upon him for<lb/> having confounded for the sake of witticism the<lb/>
				lowest operations of the mind with the operation of<lb/> the highest influences of
				the soul. It was true that<lb/>
				<persName>Gibbon</persName> and <persName>Hume</persName> might as infidels have sat
				in that<lb/> House&#59; but they could only have done so by pro&#45;<lb/>fessing
				that in their opinion Christianity was part<lb/> and parcel of the law of the
				land.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The House was now called upon to break down<lb/> all the barriers which prevented the
				Jews from sit&#45;<lb/>ting in Parliament. No advantage would be gained<lb/> by such
				an enactment&#8212;no compensation would be af&#45;<lb/>forded for the great shock
				which it would occasion to<lb/> thousands of honest and conscientious Christians.<lb/>
				<persName>Lord John Russell</persName> rested his case upon justice.<lb/>
				<persName>Dr. Arnold</persName>&#8212;whose words he quoted&#8212;denied that<lb/>
				the Jews had any claim to emancipation on that<lb/> ground&#44; and his Lordship had
				not ventured to say a<lb/> word in refutation of that denial. The present was<lb/>
				altogether a question of principle&#8212;it was a legisla&#45;<lb/>tive declaration
				that for all the purposes of public<lb/> government&#44; of making laws&#44; and of
				administering<lb/> public affairs&#44; Christianity was altogether needless.<lb/> To
				such a doctrine he could not assent even for a<lb/> single hour. If the Jews had
				been already in Parli&#45;<lb/>ament&#44; he would not have proposed to turn them
				out&#44;<lb/> but it was a widely different question to propose to<lb/> bring them
				in and to repeal for their introduction an<lb/> oath which was a declaration of
				Christianity on the<lb/> part of the Legislature. In saying this&#44; he
				disclaimed<lb/> any antipathy to the Jews&#44; and gave a glowing
				des&#45;<lb/>cription of the knowledge&#44; intelligence&#44; literature&#44;<lb/>
				and perseverance of the Jews of the present age&#44;<lb/> both in this country and
				other countries of <placeName>Europe</placeName>.</p>
