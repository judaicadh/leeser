				<p rend="align(center)">AN ADDRESS&#44; DELIVERED AT THE SCHOOLHOUSE OF THE HEBREW EDUCATION SOCIETY<lb/> OF <placeName>PHILADELPHIA</placeName>&#44; AT THE FIRST OPENING OF THEIR SCHOOL&#44; ON <date>SUNDAY&#44; THE<lb/> 4TH OF NISSAN&#44; 5611&#44; &#40;APRIL 6TH&#44; 1851&#44;&#41;</date></p>
				<p rend="align(center)">BY <persName role="author">ISAAC LEESER</persName>.</p>
				<p>MY FRIENDS&#44;&#8212;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Although we are not assembled this day in a house consecrated<lb/> to God&#44; still we have met for the purpose of doing honour to our<lb/> Everlasting King&#44; and to labour in His name.  It has always<lb/> been the custom of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; on all occasions of public assembly&#44;<lb/> not to let the words of prayer be wanting&#59; it is <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> &#8220;The voice which is the voice of <persName>Jacob</persName>&#44;&#8221; which is ever accep&#45;<lb/>table on High&#59; in this is our strength&#44; in this our victory&#59; herein<lb/> angels of mercy join us to do honour to the Creator&#59; and of<lb/> this&#44; in our deepest affliction&#44; tyrants in all their power&#44; nations<lb/> in all their tumultuous wrath&#44; could not rob us.  Let us&#44; then&#44;<lb/> not be unmindful of this our potent weapon&#44; the two&#45;edged sword<lb/> of God&#39;s praise&#44; which is in our mouth&#44; and let us reverentially<lb/> and with deep humility invoke the aid of our Father in heaven<lb/> on the work which we are about to begin&#44; in order that He may<lb/> be with us at our first starting&#44; and not withdraw from us His<lb/> grace and aid till our task be accomplished.</p>
				<p rend="align(center)">1</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">2</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">O Lord Eternal&#33;  Thou has commanded us in thy law&#44; that we<lb/> should propagate the doctrines Thou has bestowed on us&#59; since Thou<lb/> has ordained&#44; &#8220;And ye shall teach them to your children&#44; to speak of<lb/> them when thou sittest in thy house&#44; when thou walkest by the way&#44;<lb/> when thou liest down and when thou risest up.&#8221;  It is in obedience to<lb/> this behest that we&#44; thy servants&#44; have striven to establish a seminary<lb/> where the children born unto <placeName>Israel</placeName> might be taught of thy laws&#44; and<lb/> acquire a knowledge of the sacred language of thy people&#44; without<lb/> being exposed to the danger of contamination&#44; by instruction which is<lb/> hostile to the faith which we derive from Thee.  Long has our striving<lb/> been in vain&#44; our words fell on ears deaf to admonition&#59; but at length&#44;<lb/> for which we bless thy Name&#44; we are at the eve of commencing the<lb/> work which is so necessary to the well&#45;being of all descendants of<lb/> <persName>Jacob</persName>.  But&#44; O&#33; how feeble is this beginning&#8212;how small the number<lb/> of those who have inscribed their names unto Thee&#59; but we entreat<lb/> Thee&#44; do not despise the offering which we bring unworthy&#44; though it<lb/> be&#44; of thy acceptance&#59; and cause it to prosper and flourish&#44; since Thine<lb/> is the power to bless and perfect what man begins in doubt and sorrow.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Long has thy Name been profaned among the gentiles&#44; when they<lb/> saw that they who were called thy people were untrue to their calling&#44;<lb/> and faithless to the mission Thou has assigned them&#44; to be a guide to<lb/> the nations.  The knowledge of thy word and thy ways has fearfully<lb/> diminished&#44; and many have fallen off&#44; because they know not the prin&#45;<lb/>ciples of thy faith&#44; and the duties incident to its followers.  Grant<lb/> then&#44; O most merciful Father&#33; that this school may become a shining<lb/> ledge the minds of many who otherwise would grope their way in dark&#45;<lb/>ness&#59; that its scholars may become quick in the spirit of salvation&#44; and<lb/> stand forth as Israelites in whom Thou art well pleased&#59; and that<lb/> through them many others may be drawn into the sacred influence&#44; to<lb/> devote to Thee their life&#44; their best exertions&#44; and their whole soul.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Upon the teachers who are to engage in the holy work send&#44; we<lb/> beseech Thee&#44; thy gracious beneficence&#59; inspire them with meekness&#44;<lb/> to labour in the arduous task which they have assumed&#44; and with per&#45;<lb/>severance not to flag amidst discouraging trials to which they will be<lb/> exposed.  Lend eloquence to their tongues&#44; and deep persuasion to<lb/> their words&#44; that they may be able to enchain the youthful hearts&#44; and<lb/> bind them indissolubly to thy service&#44; so that in after years they may<lb/> rejoice over the multitudes they have brought under the overshadowing<lb/> wings of thy Providence.</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">3</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">And upon us&#44; and all the well&#45;wishers of this institution&#44; pour out<lb/> the spirit of liberality and devotedness&#44; that we may not be weary in<lb/> our struggle&#44; nor become faint&#45;hearted&#44; if immediate success crown not<lb/> our enterprise.  Yea&#44; teach us to wait for thy aid&#44; in meekness and<lb/> submission&#44; and not to expect too much from our own strength and<lb/> our own endeavours&#59; so that&#44; persisting to work in the cause of thy<lb/> religion&#44; we may be strengthened with the hope that Thou wilt guide<lb/> us aright&#44; and make everything eventuate for the best&#44; to the extension<lb/> of thy kingdom&#44; and the spread of thy glory&#44; and the joy of the holy<lb/> ones on earth&#44; in whom Thou feelest delight.  Be it thus thy will to<lb/> establish the work of our hands&#44; and to let thy beauty be revealed<lb/> over us.  Amen.</p>
				<p>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN&#44;&#8212;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">When <persName>Joshua</persName>&#44; the successor of <persName>Moses</persName>&#44; was nigh the end of<lb/> his mortal career&#44; he assembled the whole tribes of <placeName>Israel</placeName> at<lb/> <placeName>Shechem</placeName>&#44; and addressed the elders&#44; captains&#44; judges&#44; and officers<lb/> of justice&#44; in a heart&#45;stirring appeal&#44; relative to their duties to<lb/> their God&#44; in reminding them how mercifully He had brought<lb/> them and their fathers to be his servants.  He left them&#44; how&#45;<lb/>ever&#44; the choice of remaining faithful to the Lord&#44; or to select<lb/> some of the various idolatries which were then in vogue&#44; either<lb/> that of the Mesopotamians&#44; or of the Emorites&#44; near whom they<lb/> then dwelt&#59; but whatever the people might resolve on&#44; he de&#45;<lb/>clared his firm determination that he and his household would<lb/> serve the Lord.  The Israelites&#44; however&#44; who had been the<lb/> witnesses of the mercy and might which had been displayed<lb/> before them&#44; had no doubt of the truth of their religion in their<lb/> heart&#59; they therefore chose the same worship which their leader<lb/> had chosen&#44; and they declared&#44; &#8220;We also will serve the Lord&#44;<lb/> for he is our God.&#8221;  After again receiving an affirmation of this<lb/> pious and prudent resolution&#44; <persName>Joshua</persName> wrote all that had trans&#45;<lb/>pired in a book containing the law of God&#44; and took a large<lb/> stone and erected it there&#44; under  the beech tree&#44; which was near<lb/> the sanctuary of the Lord&#59; and then we read</p>
				<p><add>Hebrew</add></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#8220;And <persName>Joshua</persName> said&#44; Behold this stone shall be as a testimony against us&#44;<lb/> for it hath heard all the sayings of the Lord which he hath spoken with us&#59;&#8221;</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">4</p>
				<p>and therefore shall it be as a testimony against you&#44; that ye may not prove<lb/> false to your God.&#8221;&#8212;<persName>JOSHUA</persName> xxiv. 27.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">These last words of the son of <persName>Nun</persName> may appear strange to<lb/> you&#44; inasmuch as he ascribes hearing to an inanimate block of<lb/> stone&#44; and says that it shall be a testimony against those with<lb/> whom he spoke.  But it is not to be expected that <persName>Joshua</persName> meant<lb/> to convey&#44; or that the people understood him as implying&#44; any<lb/> such absurdity.  It is only in a metaphorical sense that he<lb/> spoke.  The people had been assembled near where the stone<lb/> lay on the ground&#44; consequently all the words and promises<lb/> which they uttered could have been heard by the stone had it<lb/> been a living being&#59; wherefore it might well be erected in that<lb/> place&#44; and remind all future comers&#44; on seeing it&#44; that on that<lb/> very spot&#44; and around it&#44; their forefathers stood&#44; when they<lb/> solemnly declared that they would remain Israelites&#44; and obe&#45;<lb/>dient to the words of God&#44; though they had been offered the<lb/> free choice of rejecting Him if they preferred doing so&#59; conse&#45;<lb/>quently the stone&#44; by its silent presence&#44; would be a testimony<lb/> against the people&#44; should they ever become untrue to their<lb/> Liege&#45;Lord&#44; who had done for them so many wondrous and mer&#45;<lb/>ciful deeds.  It is well known to you how powerfully mementos<lb/> of the departed affect us&#59; how we can be made sad by recalling<lb/> to mind some simple lay which we in infancy heard our mother<lb/> sing&#59; how we are constantly wrought upon by even trifling<lb/> matters&#44; which bring back before our memory events that we<lb/> long since had deemed as faded and forgotten.  It need not&#44; there&#45;<lb/>fore&#44; surprise us that mankind&#44; in all ages&#44; have deemed monu&#45;<lb/>mental columns of high importance&#44; as fixing historical events in<lb/> the most energetic manner on the minds of the beholders&#59; and<lb/> it is only in obedience to a positive injunction&#44; that the ancient<lb/> Israelites did not invoke the aid of sculpture or the other cog&#45;<lb/>nate branches of the plastic art&#44; to commemorate their heroes<lb/> and their beneficent exertions.  The more reason was there for<lb/> erecting simple&#44; and if you will&#44; rough stones&#44; durable as they<lb/> are&#44; and almost bidding defiance to the all&#45;devouring tooth of<lb/> time&#44; in order that they might serve to point out the spots con&#45;<lb/>secrated by the occurrence of important events&#44; which would</p>
			<pb n="5"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">5</p>
				<p>then also call their attention to the fact that&#44; because they were<lb/> servants of the Incorporeal One&#44; who cannot be represented by<lb/> any outward figure&#44; they had been interdicted to make any hewn<lb/> image&#44; the simplest of which had&#44; in the corrupt taste of those<lb/> times&#44; been converted into objects of worship&#59; wherefore the<lb/> mere product of nature&#44; unadorned and undefiled by the artist&#39;s<lb/> chisel&#44; must serve them&#44; instead of the laboured monuments of<lb/> <placeName>Greece</placeName>&#44; <placeName>Assyria</placeName>&#44; <placeName>Babylon</placeName>&#44; and <placeName>Egypt</placeName>.  Some would&#45;be&#45;wise men<lb/> will&#44; perhaps&#44; esteem this prohibition of sculpture and carving as<lb/> narrow and illiberal&#59; but if we view the depravity and hero<lb/> worship consequent on representing the human figure in relief&#44;<lb/> as it was <sic>practised</sic> by the ancients&#8212;the necessary tendency of<lb/> rising in imagination from the mortal to the Immortal&#44; and to<lb/> portray Him too with daring and impious hands&#8212;the means it<lb/> gives to represent criminal acts and indecencies of all sorts&#44; as<lb/> we see but too often done among moderns&#58;&#8212;we need not feel any<lb/> surprise that in our religion no opportunity was allowed to a<lb/> prurient fancy so to degrade the highest moral good as to make<lb/> it subservient to vice&#44; or to elevate to an undue height frail mor&#45;<lb/>tality&#44; and to invest it with attributes to which it has no claims.<lb/>  Besides all this&#44; the emblematic pictures and sculptures of the<lb/> ancients have long since lost their significance&#59; and however<lb/> some one highly endowed may yet be permitted to decipher their<lb/> secrets&#44; and the history and lessons they convey&#44; it is not to be<lb/> denied that&#44; as guides to mankind&#44; the stupendous works of anti&#45;<lb/>quity are practically of no more use than the simple stone erected<lb/> by <persName>Joshua</persName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">You may say&#44; that so far as permanence is concerned&#44; the<lb/> monument erected near the Sanctuary at <placeName>Shechem</placeName> is no longer<lb/> in existence&#59; consequently to us&#44; at this late day&#44; it is of no more<lb/> use than the hieroglyphic&#45;covered columns of <placeName>Luxor</placeName> and <placeName>Karnac</placeName>.<lb/>  True&#44; most true&#59; but it is precisely this perishableness of all<lb/> structures&#44; whether the rude or ornamental&#44; which proves the<lb/> utter fatuity of man when he vaunts that he is building for<lb/> futurity.  He may&#44; indeed&#44; pile up stone upon stone&#44; wall on<lb/> wall&#44; but he has not secured his edifice from decay&#59; nay&#44; the<lb/> very materials he employs&#44; the hardest basalt and granite will</p>
				<p rend="align(center)">1&#42;</p>
			<pb n="6"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">6</p>
				<p>suffer from abrasion the moment after they are placed in rest.<lb/>  So then let us no more know the site on which <persName>Joshua</persName> raised his<lb/> monument&#8212;it matters not&#59; it spoke its instruction as long as it<lb/> was required&#44; whilst the mind of the people needed to be re&#45;<lb/>kindled whenever forgetfulness of God&#39;s word was threatened in<lb/> the corruption of the times&#59; but&#44; brethren&#44; though the stone<lb/> itself has perished&#44; and they have passed away&#44; who&#44; violating<lb/> their pledge&#44; suffered for the covenant broken&#44; and the law<lb/> violated&#58; the object for which it was erected has not passed<lb/> away&#44; and the religion of which it was a testimony is as potent<lb/> now as it was on that very day&#59; and yet more&#44; it is firmer esta&#45;<lb/>blished in the hearts of all Israelites than at that early date of<lb/> our history&#44; when so many wavered and went often astray after<lb/> strange gods who have no breath in their nostrils.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">And let me ask you&#44; What brings us here together this day&#63;<lb/>  It is the very same idea which caused <persName>Joshua</persName> to set up his me&#45;<lb/>morial stone&#44;&#8212;it is to testify that we wish to erect an institution<lb/> in honour of the name of God.  The sanctuary is indeed no<lb/> longer ours&#59; we have only small places for meeting to pray and<lb/> to exhort&#59; but we lack the glorious manifestation of the Divine<lb/> Presence which formerly animated and comforted us.  But the<lb/> law itself which was to be glorified through means of the public<lb/> ministration of the priesthood is not yet extinct&#44; and claims of<lb/> us&#44; no less than in days of old&#44; that we should spread it among all<lb/> classes&#44; as we read&#58; &#8220;Assemble together the people&#44; the men and<lb/> the women and the children&#44; and thy stranger who is within thy<lb/> gates&#44; in order that they may hear&#44; and in order that they may<lb/> learn&#44; and fear the Lord your God&#44; and observe to do all the<lb/> words of this law.&#8221; &#40;Deut. xxxi. 12.&#41;  It was not only given for<lb/> the rich&#44; the learned&#44; the wise&#44; the aged&#44; the native born&#44; the<lb/> noble&#44; and the priest&#44; but for all who bear God&#39;s soul in their<lb/> bosom&#44; it was bestowed as the inheritance of all mankind&#44; where&#45;<lb/>fore all who were within reach of instruction were to be assembled<lb/> to take part in the septennial ceremony of its public proclamation<lb/> by the political chief of the people&#44; in order that all might be<lb/> animated by one desire to learn how to obey the will of the<lb/> universal God&#44; to whom all on earth bear the relation of children</p>
			<pb n="7"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">7</p>
				<p>to their Father&#44; of scholars to their Teacher.  And we have<lb/> come hither to&#45;day to commence a school of instruction&#44; open<lb/> alike to the poor and the rich&#44; the Israelite and the stranger&#44;<lb/> where it shall be the principal business of the teachers to imbue<lb/> the mind early with true conceptions of the Godhead&#44; and to<lb/> repeat the lesson so frequently&#44; by a daily putting line upon line<lb/> and precept upon precept&#44; that Judaism may become a part of<lb/> the very nature of our pupils&#44; without which they could not exist&#44;<lb/> even if they should at a future day be tempted to cast it off for<lb/> the glare and allurement of the hostile world beyond.  It is not<lb/> an easy thing&#44; through some of you&#44; my hearers&#44; may think other&#45;<lb/>wise&#44; to acquire this staunch love for religion&#59; or else why do<lb/> we see so many violations of its precepts daily and hourly <sic>prac&#45;<lb/>tised</sic> before our eyes&#63;  Had Israelites that devotion which they<lb/> ought to have&#44; they could not so disregard their duties.  It is<lb/> education only which can effect this&#44; and a constant exhorting at<lb/> home and at school which can result in a God&#45;fearing conduct<lb/> through life.  You may ask me&#44; &#8220;Are there not many highly<lb/> educated who are unfaithful&#63; not many ignorant who are pious&#63;&#8221;<lb/>  I readily answer &#8220;Yes&#44;&#8221; to both these questions.  But though<lb/> you do find the ignorant pious after their fashion&#44; as <hi rend="italics">far as they</hi><lb/> <hi rend="italics">know how</hi>&#44; and the learned often desperately wicked&#44; this does<lb/> not gainsay that true piety and an enlightened zeal are only<lb/> found in those who have been inly tinctured with divine wisdom.<lb/>  For who were the great leaders of our race at all times&#63; were<lb/> they the unlettered&#63; who were the prophets&#63; were they the un&#45;<lb/>instructed&#63; who were the most glorious martyrs&#63; were they the<lb/> ignorant&#63;  No&#44; fellow&#45;Israelites&#44; they were all&#44; whether men or<lb/> women&#44; those in whom the spirit of knowledge dwelt&#44; and it was<lb/> in their footsteps that the multitudes followed&#44; whether they<lb/> made their pilgrimage to the temple at <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>&#44; whether they<lb/> ranged themselves under their country&#39;s banner on the day of<lb/> strife&#44; although they knew that all efforts would be in vain&#44; since<lb/> the enemy had penetrated within their walls&#44; or whether they<lb/> hastened to a yet more glorious death when tyrants demanded<lb/> their blood as the price of maintaining their religion.</p>

				<p>hold in order that we may maintain the proper influence over its<lb/> members.  All <placeName>Israel</placeName> may in truth be viewed as one large family&#44;<lb/> in which each one has assigned a part which he must achieve or<lb/> be recreant to his trust.  But&#44; alas&#33; how many have proved so&#33;<lb/> look at the records of the congregations in this country&#44; and you<lb/> will seek in vain for the representatives of many families among<lb/> the professing Jews.  Some have died out by the want of male<lb/> descendants to bear their names&#59; but many others have left the<lb/> Synagogue&#44; either by <sic>apostacy</sic> or the quiet intermingling with<lb/> the gentiles&#59; and in addition to several families thus extinct<lb/> already&#44; others are fast hastening to the same deplorable state.<lb/>  Have you ever reflected on this fact&#63;  I have&#44; many&#44; many<lb/> times&#44; with a heaviness of heart which I cannot describe to you.<lb/>  To see the names once honourable among <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; borne by those<lb/> who are in feeling the bitterest opponents of our race&#44; and the<lb/> more so because they know themselves that they are ours by the<lb/> father&#39;s or mother&#39;s side&#44; is indeed a cause of the deepest grief<lb/> to a sincere follower of the God of <persName>Jacob</persName>.  And I ask you again&#44;<lb/> have you never reflected on this fact&#63;  If you have&#44; you must<lb/> have discovered that nearly all such connexions have resulted<lb/> from one cause&#44; that is&#44; that the offending parties did not con&#45;<lb/>sider Jewish families good enough for them to associate with&#59;<lb/> they regarded themselves a degree higher than all the Hebrews<lb/> they knew&#59; and hence they sought for alliances where they<lb/> fancied their noble blood would suffer no contamination.  You<lb/> may think that I speak harshly&#59; but does the fact bear me out&#63;<lb/> does your own experience confirm what I say&#63;  I appeal to<lb/> yourselves&#44; and let me be condemned if in your innermost souls<lb/> you find not a response only too affirmative of my words.  It is<lb/> nothing to the matter that persons of all grades of society have<lb/> so offended&#59; for&#44; alas&#33; it requires neither wealth&#44; nor intellect&#44;<lb/> nor station&#44; to puff up the human heart with pride&#44; and no one<lb/> is so mean but he is in his own conceit higher than all the people<lb/> in self&#45;importance.  There have been others lost to us&#44; because<lb/> they felt themselves neglected by other Israelites&#44; they were not<lb/> appreciated as they deserved&#44; so they thought&#44; and they threw<lb/> themselves into the arms of those who are always anxious to</p>

				<p rend="align(center)">9</p>
				<p>receive the straying Jewish flock.  But whence arose this self&#45;<lb/>assumed superiority on the one side and the degradation on the<lb/> other&#63;  Do you know this&#63;  Only reflect a moment&#44; and the<lb/> matter will become clear to you.  Answer me&#44; Where were our<lb/> religious schools in former times&#63; where are they now&#63;  It has<lb/> always been to me a subject of profound astonishment and deep<lb/> regret&#44; that there was not a single school all over the country&#44;<lb/> until very lately&#44; where a Jewish child could obtain any informa&#45;<lb/>tion on his religion.  The Synagogue was no place for instruc&#45;<lb/>tion&#44; because public lectures formed no part of the exercises.<lb/>  Family worship&#44; except in rare instances&#44; was unknown&#44; and<lb/> family religious reading was not though of&#44; beyond a perusal of<lb/> the Bible in the common translation&#44; which was first ordered to<lb/> be read in churches by authority of <persName>King James the First</persName>&#44; of<lb/> <placeName>England</placeName>.  The religious books accessible were limited to the<lb/> works of the late <persName>David Levi</persName>&#44; who in his lifetime was but ill&#45;<lb/>rewarded for the strenuous exertions he made in the cause of<lb/> Judaism.  Our Jewish predecessors in this country had only one<lb/> place of meeting&#44; and this was the Synagogue&#44; where the worship<lb/> was uniformly the same every <date>Sabbath</date> in the year&#44; the tunes<lb/> only varying to suit the various occasions for which they are<lb/> very happily adapted.  Could such a system tend to make men<lb/> and women familiar with their faith&#63; could it produce a fusion<lb/> of wills and a harmony of souls&#44; not to speak among natives and<lb/> foreigners&#44; but among the natives themselves&#63;  It is idle to ex&#45;<lb/>pect it&#44; for many knew not a word of Hebrew&#59; the language of<lb/> their worship was an unknown tongue to them&#59; consequently the<lb/> sounds&#44; beyond the sweetness of the melody&#44; fell like an unmean&#45;<lb/>ing noise to their ears&#44; and no improvement&#44; no lifting up of the<lb/> heart&#44; could be expected.  And where a little Hebrew was acquired<lb/> from some casual <sic>travelling</sic> teacher&#44; it served more to deepen the<lb/> shadow of the absence of information&#44; than to remove it&#44; just as<lb/> the taper reveals to us more grimly the desolation and darkness<lb/> of a subterranean prison&#44; the outlines of which are not to be dis&#45;<lb/>cerned by the flickering flame we carry in our hands.</p>

				<p>worship in the Synagogue on a better footing.  But though the<lb/> evil was so apparent&#44; it was allowed to continue unchecked&#44; until<lb/> the eyes of many were painfully opened to the want of love and<lb/> harmony existing among us.  People who had not in youth any<lb/> familiar intercourse&#44; who had been exclusively reared among<lb/> gentiles&#44; who had no friends among their own nation&#44; could not<lb/> <sic>sympathise</sic> with the other Israelites&#44; who moved in a different<lb/> or inferior station to themselves.  The sequel was estrangement<lb/> from religion&#44; and a constantly decreasing observance of the pre&#45;<lb/>cepts of the Bible.  I was told by an aged gentleman&#44; now no<lb/> more&#44; that about seventy years ago a Jewish woman&#44; who kept a<lb/> boarding&#45;house in <placeName>New York</placeName>&#44; was remiss in some small observance<lb/> which I have forgotten.  The trustees of the Synagogue&#44; on learn&#45;<lb/>ing this&#44; at once proclaimed her house forbidden&#44; and enjoined on<lb/> all to abstain from eating with her at her table&#59; and only upon repa&#45;<lb/>ration of the wrong was the interdict removed.  You may say that<lb/> this was tyranny&#44; an unwarranted interference in private family<lb/> matters&#59; I cannot agree with you in such an opinion&#44; as it was<lb/> a public affair in which the pious Synagogue elders thought<lb/> themselves authorized by custom and prescriptive right to inter&#45;<lb/>fere.  But be this as it may&#44; it shows the high degree of con&#45;<lb/>formity then prevailing in the oldest congregation in the country.<lb/>  Now look at the contrast with the present state of affairs&#33;  See<lb/> how many violate the <date>Sabbath</date>&#59; how many are married out of<lb/> the pale of Judaism&#59; how many eat forbidden food&#59; how many<lb/> disregard the <date>Passover</date>&#59; how many neglect the precept of cir&#45;<lb/>cumcision&#44; and then say&#44; that we have not changed for the worse.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I said the evil had become so apparent&#44; and that something<lb/> was necessary to be done&#44; that a friend of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; a friend of<lb/> mankind&#44; thirteen years ago undertook&#44; unsolicited and of her<lb/> own accord&#44; to open a place of instruction for one day in the<lb/> week to all who might choose to avail themselves of its advan&#45;<lb/>tages.  The school was begun with hardly any books suitable<lb/> for the purpose&#59; and now behold&#33; we have a good though a<lb/> small series every way calculated to serve the end in view&#44; as<lb/> the works embracing it convey a rational account of our religion&#44;<lb/> both its theory and practice&#44; and tend powerfully to make a</p>
			<pb n="11"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">11</p>
				<p>lasting impression on the youthful mind.  I cannot doubt that<lb/> much good has already resulted from it.  Friendships have been<lb/> cemented which probably will last during life&#59; children have<lb/> learned to know each other as Jews&#44; and to admire each other&#39;s<lb/> character&#44; who under other circumstances would never have come<lb/> in contact&#59; and I have every reason for believing that evil and<lb/> anti&#45;Jewish influences have been eradicated from the minds of<lb/> some who otherwise might have forsaken our communion.  I do not<lb/> stand&#44; however&#44; here to flatter or to blame unduly&#59; I have been<lb/> asked by my colleagues to urge the importance of our enterprise.<lb/>  Therefore permit that I point out the defects of a mere Sunday<lb/> School&#44; unaided by any other seminary.  I will again acknow&#45;<lb/>ledge&#44; before I proceed further&#44; that the example of the benevo&#45;<lb/>lent lady whom we all esteem&#44; and whom I am proud to be per&#45;<lb/>mitted to call my friend&#44; and that of her disinterested assistants&#44;<lb/> has been imitated in various other parts of the country&#44; until the<lb/> just charge of actual ignorance is no longer applicable to all places<lb/> where this has been done.  But no one can say&#44; that much has<lb/> been accomplished towards diffusing a knowledge of the language<lb/> of the Scriptures&#44; without which no education of an Israelite can<lb/> be complete.  The little that can be acquired in extra hours&#44;<lb/> when the children have not to recite their usual lessons or to<lb/> study them&#44; is not enough&#44; and must necessarily be very ineffi&#45;<lb/>cient.  The child is wearied with conning over matters which are<lb/> in themselves of but questionable use&#44; even when thoroughly ac&#45;<lb/>quired&#59; and when you demand of him now to repair to his<lb/> Hebrew teacher&#44; he will find out a thousand reasons for desiring<lb/> to escape from this unwelcome additional task.  And I tell you&#44;<lb/> without in the least qualifying my assertion&#44; that without an<lb/> adequate knowledge of the Hebrew&#44; sufficient at least to <sic>under&#45;<lb/>derstand</sic> the Scriptures and the ordinary prayers&#44; no Jew can<lb/> allege that he has acquired that knowledge which is all in all to<lb/> him.  A Hebrew not to be a Hebrew in language when this is<lb/> within his reach&#44; is an absurd proposition&#44; which requires no<lb/> argument to illustrate.  And pray&#44; why should we not teach to<lb/> all our children the holy tongue&#44; that they may be able to speak<lb/> understandingly of God&#39;s word when they sit at home&#44; and when</p>
			<pb n="12"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">12</p>
				<p>they walk together by the way&#63;  Few are acquainted with the<lb/> rich treasures of our literature&#59; and now when modern investi&#45;<lb/>gation is throwing so much light on this&#44; no less than other sub&#45;<lb/>jects&#44; it sounds strangely that to English and American Jews the<lb/> whole is perfectly inaccessible.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Well may I ask you again&#44; Shall this be always so&#63; will you<lb/> always be satisfied with things as they are&#44; when you see the<lb/> evil that has already resulted to our communities from this want<lb/> of education&#63;  Our Society&#44; however&#44; has made it its object to<lb/> become&#44; if permitted by you&#44; and if duly encouraged&#44; under the<lb/> blessing of Heaven&#44; to whose safe keeping we commit it&#44; an<lb/> earnest agent to remove the reproach so far as our sphere of<lb/> action can extend.  We purpose to combine elementary and<lb/> afterwards scientific education with a gradual and progressive<lb/> acquirement of Hebrew&#44; Hebrew literature&#44; and religion.  It is<lb/> not to be as in other schools&#44; a secondary matter whether the<lb/> children learn Hebrew and religion or not&#44; but they are to acquire<lb/> these if nothing else even can be imparted.  Still imagine not<lb/> that we are not fully alive to the importance of classical and<lb/> elegant literature&#59; we know how to appreciate both&#44; and we<lb/> trust that in a year hence our teachers will prove to you that<lb/> Jewish children can advance in all the necessary branches of<lb/> education under the superintendence of <sic>instructers</sic> of their own<lb/> people no less than of others.  We mean&#44; however&#44; to let the<lb/> objects and  concerns of eternal life not be merely the work of<lb/> spare time and a leisure day&#44; but to see that daily&#44; and in the<lb/> usual school hours&#44; the language and religion of our fathers are<lb/> properly and full illustrated.  Permit me to call your attention<lb/> to one fact&#58; the members of the committee of school directors&#44;<lb/> with a single exception&#44; have no offspring of their own old enough<lb/> to be participants in the benefit which the school is to confer&#44; it<lb/> is merely a sense of duty which impels them to be active in the<lb/> cause&#44; and to incur&#44; if need be&#44; a considerable amount of labour<lb/> to carry out their views.  But as this is the case&#44; the greater<lb/> necessity rests upon those who have children&#44; and who wish to<lb/> rear them in a religious and hopeful manner&#44; to send them to us&#44;<lb/> that we may <sic>fulfil</sic> in them the obligation which in obedience to<lb/> our religion we have assumed.</p>

			<p rend="indent(1)">But&#44; I hear some one say&#44; What guarantee can you give us<lb/> that&#44; when we remove our children from other schools&#44; they will<lb/> be properly taught the branches of a good general education&#63;<lb/>  And it is&#44; I apprehend&#44; precisely this fear which has hitherto<lb/> <sic>withholden</sic> many of you from entering your children as scholars<lb/> on our books.  But let me tell you that this is not wise&#44; though<lb/> it may be prudent.  Our efforts must fail&#44; if we meet with no<lb/> encouragement&#59; this I am willing to acknowledge&#59; but on the<lb/> other hand I maintain that we shall do more than redeem our<lb/> promise&#44; if the children are entrusted to our care.  What is to<lb/> prevent us giving as good an education as is furnished in public<lb/> or private schools&#63; do you believe that we cannot teach reading&#44;<lb/> writing&#44; arithmetic&#44; history&#44; geography and the higher branches&#44;<lb/> if these be required&#63;  The very idea is absurd&#59; whatever the<lb/> scholars show an aptness for can be taught as well&#44; to say the<lb/> least&#44; under Jewish supervision as any other.  Only try us&#44; if it<lb/> be only for one year&#59; and if at its expiration you are dissatisfied<lb/> with the progress of your children&#44; taking as the standard of<lb/> comparison what they have acquired before elsewhere&#44; we shall<lb/> be willing to acknowledge that we have failed.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">You must&#44; however&#44; reflect again&#44; that we not merely charge<lb/> ourselves with simple education&#59; we wish to return your children<lb/> to you at the end of each season improved in manners and morals.<lb/>  We wish to subject their minds to a wholesome restraint&#44; where<lb/> love shall govern and not force&#44; where intellect is to lead&#44; not<lb/> vain ambition.  Look at the effects of the Sunday School&#44; how<lb/> they have ennobled natures some thought incapable of improve&#45;<lb/>ment&#44; and then say that the effect will not be much greater if<lb/> the discipline be carried out through the whole period children<lb/> are at school.  It will most assuredly take some time to get<lb/> everything in is proper train&#59; perhaps several weeks must elapse<lb/> before we can fairly assert that we have made a proper begin&#45;<lb/>ning&#59; the thing is yet new&#44; and circumstances&#44; the surest indica&#45;<lb/>tions of Providence&#44; must show us how we are to proceed&#59; only<lb/> have a little patience&#59; the same you would demand if you all<lb/> were in our place&#44; and we promise that we will faithfully strive<lb/> to do our whole duty.

				<p>some mistakes at the very outset and during the subsequent ex&#45;<lb/>istence of our enterprise&#59; but shall this deprive us of your con&#45;<lb/>fidence&#63; we trust not&#59; we are all working in one cause&#59; parents<lb/> teachers&#44; managers&#44; children&#44; have all one object&#44; that is&#44; the<lb/> diffusion of a knowledge of our religion&#59; and hence we trust that<lb/> any error which may be discovered shall be pointed out to us with<lb/> candour and mildness&#44; and we will endeavour to amend&#44; so far<lb/> as this may be practicable with the means and materials at our<lb/> disposal.  Only let me beg you&#44; not to doubt hastily of a good<lb/> result&#59; it has been well said that &#8220;our doubts are traitors&#59;&#8221; and<lb/> it is certain that no great enterprise ever succeeded where the<lb/> actors themselves doubted of their final success.  To insure a<lb/> happy issue we must have but one thing in view&#44; namely&#44; the <hi rend="italics">end</hi><lb/> we are aiming at&#59; we must not regard great or small obstacles<lb/> as things worth minding&#44; but move straight onward&#44; and let each<lb/> step taken in advance be the forerunner and guarantee of the<lb/> next succeeding one.  Believe me&#44; that the greatest results are<lb/> obtained by slow and contiguous minor advances&#59; and they suc&#45;<lb/>ceed the best who persevere the longest without despairing of<lb/> their chances of carrying out what they at first dimly conceived<lb/> to be within the range of their possibility.  As little as wealth or<lb/> renown is suddenly acquired&#44; except in rare instances&#44; can any<lb/> enterprise&#44; whatever it be&#44; expect to prove itself at once among<lb/> the events which are established in the full tide of success.<lb/>  Therefore I tell you&#44; demand not of us that we shall accomplish<lb/> impossibilities all at once&#59; that we are to gather in this institu&#45;<lb/>tion children of various stages of intellect and progress in do&#45;<lb/>mestic education&#44; and <sic>mould</sic> them without delay into scholars of<lb/> a uniform conduct and progress.  Without a miracle&#44; this will be<lb/> impossible&#44; and we are not vain nor foolish enough to claim the<lb/> ability to accomplish the impracticable.  But let me beg of you<lb/> all&#44; not to undervalue our and your capacity for succeeding with<lb/> this school because we are Jews.  The remark is often made&#44; that<lb/> we Israelites cannot do things like other people&#44; and that we are<lb/> altogether too self&#45;willed to succeed where others find no bar to<lb/> carry out their views.  For my part I will never believe that we<lb/> are inferior to the best of mankind in whatever we devote our</p>

				<p rend="align(center)">15</p>
				<p>attention to.  Look at the great progress we have made in com&#45;<lb/>merce and the mechanic arts wherever we had a fair field of<lb/> action&#58; and I see no reason why the same result is not equally<lb/> certain in every pursuit to which we may seriously devote our<lb/> energies.  It is and has been our misfortune for many centuries&#44;<lb/> that small trading&#44; and at best large commerce&#44; has been our<lb/> main pursuit&#59; still&#44; with all the disadvantages of our position&#44; we<lb/> have maintained a high character as an educated and intellectual<lb/> people&#44; though at times our education systems have been highly<lb/> defective.  But I ask you&#44; What is to prevent us in this free<lb/> country&#44; where all legal disqualifications are unknown&#44; from ad&#45;<lb/>vancing with the same or greater rapidity in intellectual pursuits<lb/> with our fellow&#45;citizens of other persuasions&#63;  What a humi&#45;<lb/>liating confession would it be were we to acknowledge that we<lb/> did not establish religious schools&#44; because we lacked the capacity<lb/> and energy to undertake them&#44; though we had ample means<lb/> and a fair opportunity to do so.  Away with such croaking&#59; let<lb/> us not hear the ominous sounds &#8220;We cannot&#59;&#8221; we can&#44; we must&#44;<lb/> we will&#33; say this all of you&#44; induce others to say the same&#44; and<lb/> then you will soon see whether Jews can succeed in disseminating<lb/> education and religious knowledge as successfully as the best and<lb/> most enlightened denomination&#44; whatever this may be.</p>

				<p>be a Nazarene&#44; and for all we know fully as good as in his sect&#44;<lb/> though he turn Baptist or Quaker.  But a Jew is no Jew if he<lb/> has not a firm hold on his peculiar opinions and distinguishing<lb/> practice.  A theoretical Jew can exist&#59; we have&#44; unfortunately&#44;<lb/> many such&#59; but they are not the Israelites of the Scriptures&#44;<lb/> because the material element of this character&#44; <hi rend="italics">religious confor&#45;</hi><lb/><hi rend="italics">mity</hi>&#44; is absent.  We know&#44; moreover&#44; no exemption from duty&#59;<lb/> we have no standard of indulgences or restrictions&#59; no noble<lb/> classes who may transgress&#44; no lower orders who may yield them&#45;<lb/>selves to degrading vices in order to gratify the sensualities of<lb/> the lordlings&#44; who look upon them with contempt even whilst they<lb/> minister to their pleasures.  The Jew is a Jew&#44; whether he is the<lb/> pedlar that bends double under the burden which his laborious<lb/> shoulders carry&#44; or the baron of the <placeName>Austrian Empire</placeName> who idles<lb/> away his hours on the luxurious sofa.  The hopes of the last are<lb/> not a whit higher and nobler than those of the first&#44; and this one<lb/> has the same claims to immortality and a glorious hereafter&#44; as<lb/> the most favoured child of luxury.

				<p>of the advantages which we hope to offer to you.  &#8220;Ho&#33; let all<lb/> you who are thirsty&#44;&#8221; says the prophet&#44; &#8220;come to the waters&#44;<lb/> and he too who hath no money&#59; come ye&#44; buy and eat&#59; yea&#44;<lb/> come&#44; buy wine and milk&#44; without money and without price.&#8221;<lb/>  The word of God is free to all&#44; it is the water&#44; the bread&#44; the<lb/> wine and milk of life&#59; it refreshes&#44; it satisfies&#44; it rejoices&#44; it<lb/> nourishes.  It is given to all&#44; offered to all&#59; and we summon all<lb/> within our reach&#44; as did the ancient prophet&#44; to partake of the<lb/> repast which we hope to spread for you in the name and by the<lb/> aid of God.  We demand of those able to pay a small fee towards<lb/> defraying the expenses which we have to incur&#44; and we trust that<lb/> this will be cheerfully given&#59; but they who are not blessed with a<lb/> superabundance of means are invited&#44; nevertheless&#44; to entrust to<lb/> us their children&#44; and we promise them that they shall not suffer<lb/> the least reproof for the inability of their parents.  All we ask<lb/> of them is to send their children tidily dressed&#44; and cleanly in<lb/> their persons&#44; so that no stain will attach to them for their humble<lb/> state.  And let me here remark at once&#44; that nothing so promotes<lb/> good conduct and proficiency in study as scrupulous cleanliness&#59;<lb/> in a dirty body a dirty soul too often dwells&#44; and the exterior is<lb/> mostly a fair index of the inward man.  Cleanliness&#44; say our<lb/> wise men&#44; is the first step to the acquisition of holiness&#44; and it is<lb/> a necessary element of Jewish life&#44; as our holy law amply proves.<lb/>  It is not to be questioned&#44; that if the children of the poor come<lb/> hither so that all can freely associate with them&#44; it will be an<lb/> incentive for the rich to apply to us also to take theirs under<lb/> our charge&#59; and only the non&#45;observance of this rule can operate<lb/> as an excuse to withhold any one from taking advantage of the<lb/> institution we now commence.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Let no one thing that any injury can result to better trained<lb/> children&#44; by associating with those not so fortunate as them&#45;<lb/>selves&#59; in after&#45;life they will have to meet with persons of all<lb/> classes&#44; and it is no detriment that they become early acquainted<lb/> with the fact that all are not prosperous alike.  It will produce<lb/> in them kindliness of feeling&#44; at finding that the same virtues<lb/> can dwell in a heart covered by a frieze coat&#44; as that which<lb/> beats under a velvet mantle&#44; and that the sorrows of the poor</p>

				<p>are the same as those of the rich.  This is <hi rend="italics"><sic>levelling</sic></hi> <hi rend="italics">upward</hi>&#59;<lb/> you elevate the character of the humble&#44; by bringing them in<lb/> contact with those of better manners and greater refinement&#59;<lb/> and with children of good religious character&#44; you need not fear<lb/> that they will corrupt yours&#44; whilst they acquire from them<lb/> politeness and good breeding.  This is well understood in the<lb/> country where I was born.  Universal education has long since<lb/> been established there&#59; and at  the same colleges where the sons<lb/> of the nobles acquire their collegiate education&#44; the children of<lb/> the day&#45;labourers are freely admitted.  The former have to pay<lb/> the annual stipend which the rules require&#44; whilst the others<lb/> enjoy precisely the same advantages and privileges without any<lb/> charge whatever&#59; and it is not rare that the poorest excel the<lb/> others in every requisite of intellect&#44; industry&#44; and aptness for<lb/> study.  But what need is there to go over the ocean to seek for<lb/> examples of the kind&#63;  Look at your own great statesmen&#44; your<lb/> <persName>Clay</persName>&#44; your <persName>Webster</persName>&#44; your <persName>Fillmore</persName>&#44; and thousands of others&#44; and<lb/> they were the children of poverty&#44; of the unknown.  And who<lb/> dares not to remind them of their origin&#63;  They have their<lb/> title of nobility from nature&#39;s God&#44; and show me the worldling<lb/> who would dispute this claim&#44; valid as it is above all others.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">But much as I have yet to say&#44; I find that it is time to close.<lb/>  It has been my endeavour to exhibit to you&#44; in as condensed a<lb/> manner as possible&#44; the necessity of our school&#44; its practicability&#44;<lb/> and the happy effects it may produce&#44; if it is rightly encouraged.<lb/>  Its friends and projectors have laboured long to bring it so far<lb/> as to make a commencement&#59; doubts and difficulties have sur&#45;<lb/>rounded every step in advance we have taken&#44; and much labour<lb/> and kindness will be required to keep it in operation.  It is our<lb/> intention&#44; should the demand make it necessary&#44; and our funds<lb/> suffice&#44; to open district schools at convenient distances&#44; so as to<lb/> afford all children an opportunity to avail themselves of our<lb/> Hebrew education.  For the present we have selected this place<lb/> as the most central&#44; and we hope that no captious fault&#45;finding<lb/> will prevent all our space to be soon claimed by attentive<lb/> scholars.  The committee of school directors pledge themselves<lb/> to do all in their power to afford the utmost satisfaction&#44; and to<lb/> act in all cases with strict impartiality.</p>

			<p rend="indent(1)">In conclusion&#44; permit me&#44; like <persName>Joshua</persName> of old&#44; to call your<lb/> attention to this stone&#44; as it were in the great building of right&#45;<lb/>eousness&#44; on which all <placeName>Israel</placeName> should labour&#44; which we have just<lb/> set up.  It is a testimony against you&#44; O Israelites of <placeName>Phila&#45;<lb/>delphia</placeName>&#44; whether or not you are true to the Lord your God.<lb/>  Cherish it&#44; cause it to expand&#44; labour that it may become a chief<lb/> corner stone in an extended system of education&#44; whence future<lb/> teachers and ministers of <placeName>Israel</placeName> may go forth&#44; to propagate the<lb/> word of God&#58; and you will have performed your duty&#44; a duty<lb/> which is incumbent on you and all our brothers wherever they<lb/> are.  Neglect it&#44; and you will have perhaps to deplore <sic>apostacy</sic><lb/> in your own family&#44; and a public desecration of the name of<lb/> God by some of your offspring&#44; whom you would sooner follow<lb/> to the grave&#44; than see them thus dishonour you and your faith.<lb/>  It is for your own sakes that we call on you to aid us in our<lb/> effort&#59; you will rejoice when you see those dear to you intelligent<lb/> servants of god&#44; and familiar with his word&#44; being thus faithful<lb/> from knowledge and not mere conformity by descent.  You<lb/> never&#44; we trust&#44; will regret the exertions and outlay you have<lb/> made in this cause&#59; and they who have laboured to bring the<lb/> Education Society into existence&#44; under the blessing of Provi&#45;<lb/>dence&#44; will deem themselves amply compensated&#44; when they see<lb/> that their striving has in part brought &#8220;peace in <placeName>Israel</placeName>.&#8221;</p>
