			<p rend="indent(7)"><placeName>Mobile</placeName> <date>April 21. 1848</date></p>
				<p><addressee>Revd. Isaac. Leeser</addressee></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><placeName>Philaa.</placeName> Dear Sir</p>
			<p rend="indent(3)">I wrote you a few days<lb/> since&#44; &#40;or rather to <persName>Mrs Cozens</persName>&#41; mentioning the<lb/> supposed suicide of <persName>Mr E. L. Andrews.</persName> of this city.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Thinking you might wish to know more<lb/> on the subject&#44; I will give you all the particulars<lb/> I know of it.&#8212;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The house of <persName>E L Andrews &#38; Co.</persName> &#40;<placeName>Mobile</placeName>&#41; bought<lb/> largely of Cotton last year and in consequence must<lb/> have met with very heavy losses.  This year again<lb/> they bought largely&#44; and with every prospect of<lb/> realizing a splendid fortune&#8212;So sanguine were<lb/> they of success&#44; that <persName>E. L. A.</persName> said publicly on one occasion<lb/> that he would not ship another Bale&#44; as he had<lb/> shipped enough to satisfy his utmost wishes of<lb/> fortune&#8212;This was on the receipt of news from<lb/> <placeName>Europe</placeName> announcing a rise of half penny&#44; and occurred<lb/> about two months back&#8212;All these hopes were destroyed<lb/> by the monied presence in <placeName>Europe</placeName> &#38; the consequent decline<lb/> of cotton and the Farm<add>&#63;</add> became involved seriously<lb/> but had not met with a protest.&#95;&#95;&#95;On <date>Friday</date><lb/> last&#44; <persName>Mr A.</persName> expected to receive a large sum of money<lb/> by an up river boat&#44; to meet the payments of<lb/> <date>Saturday</date>&#8212;the money did not come&#8212;he left the<lb/> office at dinner time and went home&#44; gave his wife<lb/> One thousand Dolls. &#40;so report says&#41; returned to his office<lb/> and told his partner that there was no hope for things</p>
			<pb n="1V"/>
				<p>His partner said they could meet the next days<lb/> demand by borrowing&#8212;<persName>Mr. A.</persName> remarked that they<lb/> could not as honorable men borrow when they were<lb/> not certain of replacing the money.&#8212;Neither his<lb/> partner nor family suspected his intention at this time<lb/> He did not go home in the evening&#44; but was seen<lb/> <sic>an</sic> spoken to by several persons&#8212;The next morning<lb/> his Hat &#38; Umbrella was found on the wharf&#8212;<lb/> A letter written to his partner on <date>Thursday</date> gave<lb/> full instructions about the conduct of the business<lb/> a postscript of <date>Friday</date> night told where his hat<lb/> and umbrella would be found&#44; indicating the manner<lb/> and place of his death.  Two other letters written<lb/> on <date>Friday</date> evening&#8212;one to his wife and one to<lb/> a friend requesting his attention to his wifes welfare<lb/> and stating that he was determined not to live<lb/> to see his name dishonored&#61; This was all<lb/> that was known at the time I wrote on <date>Sunday</date><lb/> search for his body proved of no avail&#44; and<lb/> Telegraphic dispatches brought the news that<lb/> <persName>Mr. Z. Andrews</persName> of <placeName>N. Orleans</placeName> was also missing and<lb/> supposed to have committed Suicide&#95;&#95;&#95;The knowledge<lb/> that the English Steamer left <placeName>Mobile</placeName> Point late<lb/> <date>saturday</date> morning&#44; threw a suspicious air over<lb/> the whole combine with the absence of the two<lb/> brothers and the fruitless search for the dead<lb/> body&#95;&#95;This morning&#44; <persName>Mr E L. A.s</persName> body was found<lb/> on the same spot he had indicated in his letter.<lb/>  He had taken the leaden paper holders from</p>
			<pb n="2R"/>
				<p>his office and placed them in his pantaloons<lb/> pockets&#44; also some pieces of Iron and then jumped<lb/> overboard&#95;&#95;His watch&#44; purse &#38;c. were found<lb/> in his office&#95;&#95;This is all&#44; and now many<lb/> that were saying that the d&#95;d Jew had run away<lb/> are shuddering at the cool desperation of his death.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Coupled with the absence of <persName>Mr. A</persName> of <placeName>N. Orleans</placeName><lb/> it <hi rend="underline">is</hi> singular.  They were in the habit of corresponding<lb/> daily&#61;<persName>E L. A.</persName> wrote to <persName>Z</persName> on <date>saturday</date>&#8212;that night <hi rend="underline">he</hi><lb/> committed suicide&#8212;<persName>Z. A.</persName> recd the letter at 10 am. <date>Sunday</date><lb/> and has not been heard of since &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; Some years<lb/> ago&#44; when <persName>Sol. Andrews</persName> failed it was well known that<lb/> his two brothers visited him in prison at <placeName>N. O.</placeName> and<lb/> brought him poison and end<add>&#63;</add> to persuade<lb/> him to make use of it.  The repeatedly said<lb/> they would never Survive a Protest.  <persName>E L. A.</persName><lb/> succeeded <persName>Sol.</persName> in business here.  I believe eleven<lb/> years ago&#44; and despite the dishonor and opprob<add>&#63;</add><lb/> on the name made his house one of the <hi rend="underline">first</hi> here<lb/> and maintained it so.  He was noted for his<lb/> <hi rend="underline">high toned</hi> business character&#44; and I am glad to<lb/> say that those who knew the man&#44; rejected all<lb/> thought of his running away.&#95;&#95;He has proved<lb/> the truth of their opinion and though I cannot<lb/> approve the act I thanked heaven when I saw<lb/> the body drawn from the water this morning<lb/> that it was so&#44; and that the Jew&#44; acknowledged<lb/> a higher sense of honor&#44; though false&#44; than many<lb/> of the cringing&#44; fashionable scoundrels&#44; who</p>
			<pb n="2V"/>
				<p>are breaking daily around me without other<lb/> thought then to save all they can for themselves.<lb/>  I have written you a long letter on what I<lb/> fear is a disagreeable matter to you as I know<lb/> you love not such subjects&#44; and I can urge<lb/> no other excuse save that I felt deeply interested<lb/> from his being a jew and prejudices being strong<lb/> against the race in this place&#95;&#95;I have been<lb/> nervous &#38; excited ever since hearing of his absence<lb/> and it is the reaction of this state that has<lb/> led me I suppose to write you what I have.<lb/>  <persName>Mr. A.</persName> has through life taught the people here<lb/> that a jew <hi rend="underline">may</hi> retain a rank among the first<lb/> in social life &#38; business standing&#8212;his death has<lb/> thrown a gloom over all who associated with<lb/> him and over the whole community&#61;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I have spun this letter out long enough<lb/> and must bring it to a close&#44;  I would be<lb/> glad if you would drop me a line or two<lb/> occasionally&#8212;Perhaps you might give me<lb/> some idea of what prospect I have of getting<lb/> business from our people when I return&#95;&#95;<lb/> By the Bye.

It will be in <placeName>Philaa.</placeName> nearly<lb/> as soon as I get there&#44; I shall want it then.&#8212;</p>
