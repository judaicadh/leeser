            <p rend="indent(3)">I wrote you a few days<lb/> since, (or rather to <persName>Mrs
                    Cozens</persName>) mentioning the<lb/> supposed suicide of <persName>Mr E. L.
                    Andrews.</persName> of this city.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Thinking you might wish to know more<lb/> on the subject, I will
                give you all the particulars<lb/> I know of it.—</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The house of <persName>E L Andrews &amp; Co.</persName>
                    (<placeName>Mobile</placeName>) bought<lb/> largely of Cotton last year and in
                consequence must<lb/> have met with very heavy losses. This year again<lb/> they
                bought largely, and with every prospect of<lb/> realizing a splendid fortune—So
                sanguine were<lb/> they of success, that <persName>E. L. A.</persName> said publicly
                on one occasion<lb/> that he would not ship another Bale, as he had<lb/> shipped
                enough to satisfy his utmost wishes of<lb/> fortune—This was on the receipt of news from<lb/>
                <placeName>Europe</placeName> announcing a rise of half penny, and occurred<lb/>
                about two months back—All these hopes were destroyed<lb/> by the monied presence in
                    <placeName>Europe</placeName> &amp; the consequent decline<lb/> of cotton and
                the Farm<add>?</add> became involved seriously<lb/> but had not met with a
                protest.___On <date>Friday</date><lb/> last, <persName>Mr A.</persName> expected to
                receive a large sum of money<lb/> by an up river boat, to meet the payments of<lb/>
                <date>Saturday</date>—the money did not come—he left the<lb/> office at dinner time
                and went home, gave his wife<lb/> One thousand Dolls. (so report says) returned to
                his office<lb/> and told his partner that there was no hope for things</p>
            <pb n="1V"/>
            <p>His partner said they could meet the next days<lb/> demand by borrowing—<persName>Mr.
                    A.</persName> remarked that they<lb/> could not as honorable men borrow when
                they were<lb/> not certain of replacing the money.—Neither his<lb/> partner nor
                family suspected his intention at this time<lb/> He did not go home in the evening,
                but was seen<lb/>
                <sic>an</sic> spoken to by several persons—The next morning<lb/> his Hat &amp;
                Umbrella was found on the wharf—<lb/> A letter written to his partner on
                    <date>Thursday</date> gave<lb/> full instructions about the conduct of the
                business<lb/> a postscript of <date>Friday</date> night told where his hat<lb/> and
                umbrella would be found, indicating the manner<lb/> and place of his death. Two
                other letters written<lb/> on <date>Friday</date> evening—one to his wife and one
                to<lb/> a friend requesting his attention to his wifes welfare<lb/> and stating that
                he was determined not to live<lb/> to see his name dishonored= This was all<lb/>
                that was known at the time I wrote on <date>Sunday</date><lb/> search for his body
                proved of no avail, and<lb/> Telegraphic dispatches brought the news that<lb/>
                <persName>Mr. Z. Andrews</persName> of <placeName>N. Orleans</placeName> was also
                missing and<lb/> supposed to have committed Suicide___The knowledge<lb/> that the
