            <p rend="indent(3)">It was with deep re-<lb/>gret that I heard through our friend
                    <persName>Rebecca</persName> that<lb/> you had been sick &amp; that you were
                still feeble<lb/> although recovered. I ardently hope you may<lb/> be perfectly well
                ere this <sic>receit</sic> of this. I fear<lb/> you exert your physical strength
                that it may<lb/> keep pace with the vigor of your mental power<lb/> now that I must
                ask you not to do for the<lb/> activity of your mind tends to weaken a
                constitu<lb/>tion not naturally robust. If you would keep<lb/> your mind in repose I
                am satisfied your<lb/> health would improve I must beg you to be<lb/> more watchful
                of it &amp; remember you belong<lb/> to your people who cannot afford that you<lb/>
                exercise your strength to its inquiry. You are too<lb/> important to our spiritual
                health for us to allow<lb/> you without a caution to neglect yourself.<lb/> My son
                begs to be kindly remembered I know not<lb/> whether my commendation or your own
                kind attentions<lb/> have impressed him so favorably but certain it is<lb/> that he
                awards you all the merit you do readily<lb/> deserve. <persName>S A</persName> has
                just come home from a long<lb/> visit to <placeName>Johns island</placeName>. She is
                much improved in health<lb/> &amp; looks from the change; pure country air &amp; the
                repose</p>

            <p>which roaming in the woods &amp; communing with nature in<lb/> her unsophisticated
                state is well calculated to improve<lb/> the health &amp; the heart. The young
                people have had it quite<lb/> gay this winter there have been several private balls
                &amp;<lb/> sociables &amp; the arrival of strangers in the winter season<lb/> keeps
                those who desire society constantly in it. I have<lb/> been in such close mourning
                for the 2 past years<lb/> that I have been nowhere but where misfortune &amp; ill
                health<lb/> preside. I however am determined if God protects us from any<lb/> ill I
                will for my Childrens sake visit &amp; have company at home<lb/> &amp; then I dare
                say catch a portion of their gaiety Even though<lb/> you were industrious in your
                efforts that my son should<lb/> captivate some of the fair assembly at the
                    <add>?</add> Malgré<lb/> toute cela he has returned unscathed not but that
                I<lb/> should be delighted for him to marry for there only is true<lb/> happiness to
                be enjoyed <add>?</add> the marriage is of<lb/> two of congenial feelings &amp;
                habits. The new minister<lb/> is expected in <date>May</date> I do not anticipate so
                beneficial a<lb/> change as many. I am of a strange turn when content<lb/> with
                present state of things I prefer no change even<lb/> though it may be a beneficial
                one I always fear to<lb/> require too much both from Creator &amp; fellow<lb/>
                Mortals it is more a superstitious fear than an<lb/> amiable trait For I have found
                that to rest our<lb/> hopes too <add>?</add> on any one desire often ends in<lb/>
                disappointment And the trials I have had to encounter<lb/> have checked all aspiring
                desires. I am on the <add>?</add><lb/><add>?</add> to receive my daguerres I presume
                you know<lb/>
                <persName>Rebecca</persName> is going to send me her &amp; her dear pets it is</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>so very kind of her to gratify me by such an attention.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">What a delightful discovery is that of
                    <persName>Daguerres</persName><lb/> lot certainly should be much better than
                the<lb/> ancients for see the advantages we possess
                <persName>Daguerres</persName><lb/> that give us the positive though inanimate
                presence<lb/> of those we love. Rail roads that swift as Eagles<lb/> wings bring
                them to us &amp; most extraordinarily the Telegra<lb/>phic wires, which with a
                velocity incredible bring us in<lb/>formation (of those separated from us) of sorrow
                or hap-<lb/>piness! Yet man is no better his passions still<lb/> unchecked his
                propensities still leading him to evil<lb/> temptation lives with her smiles in
                spite of all the<lb/> advantages which this age of improvement &amp; discovery<lb/>
                affords us. <persName>Mrs. Henry</persName> is better, Rumor with her poisoned<lb/>
                tongue has said that a change had come over here relig<lb/>ious feelings &amp; that
                she did not find that consolation in her<lb/> own faith that she required. This I
                could not bring my<lb/> heart to believe &amp; contradicted the report although
                it<lb/> came from authority hard to doubt. I could believe<lb/> that with the body
                in torture &amp; the mind enfeebled<lb/> that she might be vacillating (because my
                friend wants<lb/> division of character) &amp; beg the prayers of any good<lb/> man
                But as I had acted with her had seen how com<lb/>pletely she was satisfied with her
                own faith, I rejected<lb/> the idea and believed that as she regained her
                health<lb/> she would regain confidence in her own faith!<lb/>
                <persName>C'ol. Myers</persName> has written to beg that all reports<lb/> injurious
                to him should be refuted for there was<lb/> no truth in it. <persName>Mrs.
                    Bryan</persName> is with her &amp; it<lb/> is said that <persName>Mrs.

                &amp; all who<lb/> remember me. I am now writing without being<lb/> able to see, but
                I have had so many interruptions<lb/> that I am determined to finish in the
