            <p><addressee>Rev. Mr. Isaac Leeser</addressee>!</p>
            <p rend="indent(2)"><placeName>Albany</placeName>, <date>September 20 5611</date>.</p>
            <p>Dear Sir!</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Thanking you for your treating the<lb/> subject in which I am the
                foremost actor or<lb/> rather sufferer with your usual boldness; I<lb/> hasten to
                give you the outlines of the continua„<lb/>tion of the <persName>Spanier</persName>
                comedy.</p>
            <p>When <persName>L. Spanier</persName> saw, that his very pious<lb/> question in the
                papers brought no satisfactory<lb/> answer before the people; he tried the force
                of<lb/> money. He paid the dues for those, that could not<lb/> pay themselves; he
                gave money and promised the<lb/> more to every body, who came to him and so he<lb/>
                bought so many votes, that his party increased to<lb/> 45 or 49. He then called a
                meeting at a time<lb/> when never a meeting was, when many members<lb/> were absent,
                and others had not time to attend; He<lb/> did not as usually say what business will
                be<lb/> transacted at that meeting, so that were altogether<lb/> indifferent to the
                whole concern. But when the<lb/> meeting was organized he brought the very
                charges<lb/> against me before that meeting with which he<lb/> failed at the meeting
                of the Board. My friends<lb/> protested against the reading of such charges; but
                in<lb/> vain. They proposed to adjourn the meeting; but<lb/> in vain; he put no
                motion before the meeting.<lb/> Finally the majority of the Board declared the
                meeting<lb/> adjourned and withdrew together with all my<lb/> friends. But
                    <persName>Spanier</persName> with his party continued<lb/> the meeting, and
                resolved that the contract<lb/> between me and them is dissolved and<lb/> that I am
                discharged from my office from<lb/> that very day, <date>September 5</date>.</p>
            <p>The majority of the Board declared that meeting</p>
            <pb n="1V"/>
            <p>illegal and ordered me to discharge my duties as<lb/> ever before, my
                    <sic>counsellor</sic> advised me the same.<lb/> The first day of <add>ר"ה</add>
                when I went up to <add>הוצאת התורה</add><lb/>
                <add>ארון הקודש</add>
                <persName>L. Spanier</persName> went to the <add>סכות</add> and<lb/> not merely
                pushed me, but in a rage of madness<lb/> stroke me several times.
                    Hundred<del>s</del> commenced<lb/> at once to <sic>hollar</sic>: Throw him out
                the<lb/> bankrupt, the run of from <placeName>Germany</placeName>, all young<lb/>
                men in the Synagogue run against him, and<lb/> would have paid him, when suddenly the<lb/>
                <sic>Sherif</sic> came and dissolved the meeting and<lb/> locked up the Synagogue.
                Legal investigation<lb/> will be held in the matter. My friends 75 to<lb/> 80 have
                    <sic>seperated</sic> from the congregation, since<lb/> I have declared to enter
                no more this Synagogue<lb/> A new Congregation will be constituted and a<lb/> new
                Synagogue built. We rented a hall for<lb/> the purpose to worship in it, which
                was<lb/> always thus overfilled, that many could not<lb/> come in. The members of
                the Congregation<lb/> subscribed in one evening $1500.00 for a new<lb/> Synagogue;
                so if we helped a little we will have<lb/> soon a new building. The choir went
                with<lb/> us, and so we have our divine service just<lb/> exactly as before. The
                first day of <add>ישפט ה'</add> the<lb/> old Synagogue was reopened, when
                    <persName>L. Spanier</persName> came with<lb/> his 45 (others having not made up
                their mind went to<lb/> no Synagogue) and held divine service. A<lb/> mournful
                sadness prevails here as I never<lb/> saw before. A congregation was destroyed<lb/>
                by the ill-will, pride, egotism and folly<lb/> of <persName>L. Spanier</persName>,
