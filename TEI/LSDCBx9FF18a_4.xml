            <p rend="indent(2)">My dear friend</p>
            <p rend="indent(4)">Perhaps I ought to have<lb/> replied ere this to your form received
                the day before<lb/> I left <placeName>New York</placeName>, but I have deferred
                until now<lb/> answering your letter in hopes of having something<lb/> to say that
                might interest you.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The Box sent by Express to me in <placeName>N York</placeName><lb/>
                gave me a great deal of bother &amp; trouble, indeed<lb/> if it had not so happened
                that my brother <persName>Alexr</persName><lb/> intended to see me off, it would not
                have come<lb/> to or with me. I must say I felt somewhat put out<lb/> at receiving
                your letter stating that you would<lb/> send it, after my particular &amp; respected
                requests to<lb/> you to ship it with other things direct from<lb/> your city. The
                bother of this box received as it was<lb/> on the day of my departure caused me to
                miss<lb/> the company of my dear Parents, during the last<lb/> half hour of my stay
                in their city, after their<lb/> taking the trouble &amp; undergoing the fatigue of
                coming<lb/> down to the vessel.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">It was recd too late to bring as freight &amp; therefore<lb/> I had
                to watch it with my baggage all the way to <placeName>NO</placeName>,
                particularly<lb/> when the <placeName>California</placeName> boys were hauling &amp;
                dragging their baggage</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>from ship to ship at <placeName>Havana</placeName>. And then<lb/> on my arrival here
                I had fresh difficulties<lb/> to encounter before I could get possession<lb/> of it.
                I say nothing about some three or four<lb/> dollars very unnecessary expenses
                incurred and<lb/> which I had to pay out of my pocket. I had<lb/> quite enough to
                see to in leaving <placeName>N York</placeName> without<lb/> at the very least
                moment being worried about<lb/> a box of silver which if received here now
                would<lb/> be in plenty of time.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I speak as I do about this affair for<lb/> your sake &amp; to show
                you how seriously you<lb/> may inconvenience a friend by not properly<lb/>
                considering his entire situation. <persName>Alexander</persName> will<lb/> tell you
                how unhandsomely <persName>Adams &amp; Co</persName> behaved.<lb/> They performed
                but a very small part of their contract<lb/> with you. By the by—Did you pay them
                for taking the<lb/> box to <placeName>NY</placeName>. They said you had not &amp;
                made me pay 14/—&amp;<lb/> then they would not send it on board.
                    <persName>Alexander</persName> attended<lb/> to getting it &amp; had to bring it
                to the vessel on the back of a carriage<lb/> about ½ hour before we left, &amp; the
                job we had to set it<lb/> on board only was enough to set one crazy.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Your shipment to <persName>Mr Touro</persName> is all right<lb/> we
                have all the Bill Loding<add>?</add> calls for &amp; the keys also from<lb/> the
                captain. <persName>Mr Touro</persName> told me a day or two ago that<lb/> he would
                soon reply to your letter, which I read. I presume<lb/> he has done so. I forget the
                date of it. We have not<lb/> opened any of the boxes as yet, but will very soon—</p>

                by the <date>1st</date> proximo or else<lb/> he will decline. If he comes he will
                only remain<lb/> till <date>20th Jany</date>, then return to
                    <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> &amp; be<lb/> here again before

                arrival here. The<lb/> congregation do not want the consecration to take<lb/> place
                until we have a resident minister. I would<lb/> prefer otherwise particularly if it
                could be say middle<lb/> of <date>Jany</date> when you could be here; but I can
                not<lb/> say what they will do. From the <sic>tener</sic> of your last letter<lb/>
                to <persName>Mr Touro</persName> I hope he will ask you to come, or that he<lb/>
                will say to me that he will pay your expenses. If he does<lb/> I will do the rest
                between my congr &amp; yours to secure your<lb/> presence here. I have done you the
                fullest justice in the<lb/> sight of <persName>Mr. T</persName> &amp; also in that
                of the congregation <add>?</add><lb/> they say “I swear by your name”. So you see if
                I have any<lb/> complaints to make against you (as in the first part of this<lb/>
                letter) I make them to <hi rend="underline">you only</hi>. That is my system.—</p>

                will have the man that ought to<lb/> have been here now performing the services for
                us. I shall<lb/> not be in the least surprised if <persName>Mr. Nathan</persName>
                does not<lb/> come after all &amp; then “we will be in a boat”. Alas.</p>
