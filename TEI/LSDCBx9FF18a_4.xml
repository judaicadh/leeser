				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>New Orleans</placeName> <date>Decr. 4&#44; 5610</date>.</p>
				<p><addressee>Revd. Isaac Leeser</addressee></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><placeName>Philadelphia</placeName></p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">My dear friend</p>
			<p rend="indent(4)">Perhaps I ought to have<lb/> replied ere this to your form received the day before<lb/> I left <placeName>New York</placeName>&#44; but I have deferred until now<lb/> answering your letter in hopes of having something<lb/> to say that might interest you.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The Box sent by Express to me in <placeName>N York</placeName><lb/> gave me a great deal of bother &#38; trouble&#44; indeed<lb/> if it had not so happened that my brother <persName>Alexr</persName><lb/> intended to see me off&#44; it would not have come<lb/> to or with me.  I must say I felt somewhat put out<lb/> at receiving your letter stating that you would<lb/> send it&#44; after my particular &#38; respected requests to<lb/> you to ship it with other things direct from<lb/> your city.  The bother of this box received as it was<lb/> on the day of my departure caused me to miss<lb/> the company of my dear Parents&#44; during the last<lb/> half hour of my stay in their city&#44; after their<lb/> taking the trouble &#38; undergoing the fatigue of coming<lb/> down to the vessel.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">It was recd too late to bring as freight &#38; therefore<lb/> I had to watch it with my baggage all the way to <placeName>NO</placeName>&#44; particularly<lb/> when the <placeName>California</placeName> boys were hauling &#38; dragging their baggage</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>from ship to ship at <placeName>Havana</placeName>.  And then<lb/> on my arrival here I had fresh difficulties<lb/> to encounter before I could get possession<lb/> of it.  I say nothing about some three or four<lb/> dollars very unnecessary expenses incurred and<lb/> which I had to pay out of my pocket.  I had<lb/> quite enough to see to in leaving <placeName>N York</placeName> without<lb/> at the very least moment being worried about<lb/> a box of silver which if received here now would<lb/> be in plenty of time.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I speak as I do about this affair for<lb/> your sake &#38; to show you how seriously you<lb/> may inconvenience a friend by not properly<lb/> considering his entire situation.  <persName>Alexander</persName> will<lb/> tell you how unhandsomely <persName>Adams &#38; Co</persName> behaved.<lb/>  They performed but a very small part of their contract<lb/> with you.  By the by&#8212;Did you pay them for taking the<lb/> box to <placeName>NY</placeName>.  They said you had not &#38; made me pay 14&#47;&#8212;&#38;<lb/> then they would not send it on board.  <persName>Alexander</persName> attended<lb/> to getting it &#38; had to bring it to the vessel on the back of a carriage<lb/> about &#189; hour before we left&#44; &#38; the job we had to set it<lb/> on board only was enough to set one crazy.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Your shipment to <persName>Mr Touro</persName> is all right<lb/> we have all the Bill Loding<add>&#63;</add> calls for &#38; the keys also from<lb/> the captain.  <persName>Mr Touro</persName> told me a day or two ago that<lb/> he would soon reply to your letter&#44; which I read.  I presume<lb/> he has done so.  I forget the date of it.  We have not<lb/> opened any of the boxes as yet&#44; but will very soon&#8212;</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
			<p rend="indent(1)">With regard to a Minister the Consecration &#38;c&#8212;<lb/> We have written to <persName>Mr Nathan</persName> offering him<lb/> &#36;25.00.  He must be here by the <date>1st</date> proximo or else<lb/> he will decline.  If he comes he will only remain<lb/> till <date>20th Jany</date>&#44; then return to <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> &#38; be<lb/> here again before &#8220;<date>Sehbuot</date>&#8221; so he said in his letter<lb/> to me recd shortly after my arrival here.  The<lb/> congregation do not want the consecration to take<lb/> place until we have a resident minister.  I would<lb/> prefer otherwise particularly if it could be say middle<lb/> of <date>Jany</date> when you could be here&#59; but I can not<lb/> say what they will do.  From the <sic>tener</sic> of your last letter<lb/> to <persName>Mr Touro</persName> I hope he will ask you to come&#44; or that he<lb/> will say to me that he will pay your expenses.  If he does<lb/> I will do the rest between my congr &#38; yours to secure your<lb/> presence here.  I have done you the fullest justice in the<lb/> sight of <persName>Mr. T</persName> &#38; also in that of the congregation <add>&#63;</add><lb/> they say &#8220;I swear by your name&#8221;.  So you see if I have any<lb/> complaints to make against you &#40;as in the first part of this<lb/> letter&#41; I make them to <hi rend="underline">you only</hi>.  That is my system.&#8212;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The German congr have sent a proposal<lb/> of &#36;1500 to <persName>Mr Gutheim</persName> &#38; I have little doubt that<lb/> he will accept &#38; they will have the man that ought to<lb/> have been here now performing the services for us.  I shall<lb/> not be in the least surprised if <persName>Mr. Nathan</persName> does not<lb/> come after all &#38; then &#8220;we will be in a boat&#8221;.  Alas.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I hope you are getting along better with your flock.<lb/>  I fear they &#40;or some of them&#41; will not appreciate you<lb/> until they lose you or come very near it.  Such is pure human nature.</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The <persName>revd Mr Raphael</persName> seems to be making quite<lb/> a stir in your part of the country&#44; and indeed<lb/> many of us here are very anxious to hear &#38; see<lb/> him.  I think he will not regret his visit to<lb/> the <placeName>US</placeName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I am still kept pretty busy with finishing<lb/> the Synagogue &#38; attending to the duties of my office<lb/> as President Heb. Benevolent Association &#38; shall be happy<lb/> when some aspiring gentleman will take charge of<lb/> these matters &#38; relieve me.  In good earth I have<lb/> served long enough &#38; now only see the glimmerings<lb/> of some little satisfaction.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">It pains me to think that <persName>Mr Wm F&#39;s</persName> health<lb/> will not permit his leaving home.  What do you candidly<lb/> think of his situation entre&#45;vous.  My dear little Aunt<lb/> is quite better &#40;stronger&#41; I hear&#59; will you give my love<lb/> to them both.  I presume you see them as often as<lb/> when we used so pleasantly to meet beneath their<lb/> hospitable roof.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Knowing that you feel interested in my<lb/> welfare I name having gone into my old business as a h<add>&#63;</add><lb/> I am happy to say that I am doing very fairly indeed.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Let me hear from you my dear friend when<lb/> convenience &#38; the humor may permit.  How is your<lb/> health I trust better than heretofore.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">This ought to reach you in &#8220;<date>Hanuca</date>&#8221; may<lb/> you enjoy the festival in health &#38; contentment</p>
			<p rend="indent(3)">prays yours always the same</p>
