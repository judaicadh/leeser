                              <p>My dear friend</p>
                              <p rend="indent(2)">In making my bow to you through the<lb/> medium of
                                                  <persName>Miss DeCordova</persName>, the Bearer of
                                        this letter, I beg you<lb/> not to bear hand upon me for not
                                        visiting since my residence<lb/> here, having had enough to
                                        occupy both my time and attention<lb/> in establishing a
                                        school as a means of support, in which I<lb/> have been (I
                                        E) tolerably successful. No doubt you expected<lb/> to hear
                                        from me via <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>, but setting
                                        aside my dislike of<lb/> the climate of that place, and the
                                        repugnance of my wife to being<lb/> again separated from her
                                        family, there are other reasons which<lb/> I may confide to
                                        you, as a fellow labourer in the vineyard of<lb/> the Lord,
                                        though to an <add>Hebrew</add> I would not reveal them.
                                        They<lb/> are simply these. Having failed, despite my utmost
                                        efforts, in<lb/> giving satisfaction to two congregations,
                                                  <placeName>Kingston</placeName> &amp;
                                                  <placeName>St. Thomas</placeName>,<lb/> and,
                                        instead of kind treatment, having been exposed to
                                        insult<lb/> by both, I dread the idea of incurring it a
                                        third time; and<lb/> therefore prefer the toilsome and
                                        humble situation of a teacher<lb/> to the dignified one of a
                                        Jewish minister. Perhaps my own<lb/> temper and disposition
                                        are to blame; but, if so, is it not preferable<lb/> to
                                        retire into private life and live in peace, than have them
                                        again<lb/> excited by the <sic>disagreeabilities</sic> of a
                                        Jewish Congregation?<lb/> In <placeName>St.
                                                  Thomas</placeName>, I even offered to serve them
                                        gratuitously, as<lb/> salary was the bone of contention
                                        among the members, provided<lb/> they would be at peace with
                                        each other. This, the party in power<lb/> would not suffer;
                                        and subsequently I accepted a very trifling</p>
                              <pb n="2"/>
                              <p>salary, which was generally 3 quarters in amount, and was
                                        content<lb/> to receive it in any manner, taking whatever
                                        was offered me, which was<lb/> not unfrequently 20 dollars
                                        at a time! But it was useless. An<lb/> angel from Heaven
                                        would not satisfy them, and I, who possess<lb/> no angelic
                                        quality of course found it beyond my capability. To<lb/>
                                        enumerate the indignities I suffered would fill a volume;
                                        and<lb/> I endured them patiently till threatened with
                                        personal violence.<lb/> It was time to resign; and as
                                                  <placeName>St. Thomas</placeName> presented less
                                        advantages<lb/> than <placeName>Kingston</placeName>, behold
                                        me here again, welcomed with an intensity<lb/> of feeling I
                                        was unprepared for, and what is more, with expressions<lb/>
                                        of profound regret that I ever left. My impression always
                                        was,<lb/> that neither by preparatory study nor habits,
                                        inclination, or temper<lb/> was I ever intended or
                                                  <sic>capacitated</sic> to minister before the<lb/>
                                        Lord; circumstances forced the situation on me; and
                                        now,<lb/> having, without the needful qualifications, gained
                                        a reputation<lb/> I am unwilling to damage it by continuing
                                        in a profession<lb/> where there are so many candidates
                                        better adapted to supply<lb/> vacancies than myself. I am
                                        not ignorant that the Congregation<lb/> in <placeName>N.
                                                  O.</placeName> give me the preference to any
                                        other; this is flattering to my<lb/> feelings, an unction to
                                        my vanity if you like, but for my own<lb/> part, the course
                                        I have pursued in declining the appointment,<lb/> must,
                                        after this candid avowal, be deemed satisfactory by
                                        you.<lb/> I have now unbosomed myself, and shall be glad to
                                        hear<lb/> your opinion, as I always set the highest value,
