			<p>My dear friend</p>
          <p rend="indent(2)">In making my bow to you through the<lb/> medium of <persName>Miss DeCordova</persName>&#44; the Bearer of this letter&#44; I beg you<lb/> not to bear hand upon me for not visiting since my residence<lb/> here&#44; having had enough to occupy both my time and attention<lb/> in establishing a school as a means of support&#44; in which I<lb/> have been &#40;I E&#41; tolerably successful. No doubt you expected<lb/> to hear from me via <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>&#44; but setting aside my dislike of<lb/> the climate of that place&#44; and the repugnance of my wife to being<lb/> again separated from her family&#44; there are other reasons which<lb/> I may confide to you&#44; as a fellow labourer in the vineyard of<lb/> the Lord&#44; though to an <add>Hebrew</add> I would not reveal them. They<lb/> are simply these. Having failed&#44; despite my utmost efforts&#44; in<lb/> giving satisfaction to two congregations&#44; <placeName>Kingston</placeName> &#38; <placeName>St. Thomas</placeName>&#44;<lb/> and&#44; instead of kind treatment&#44; having been exposed to insult<lb/> by both&#44; I dread the idea of incurring it a third time&#59; and<lb/> therefore prefer the toilsome and humble situation of a teacher<lb/> to the dignified one of a Jewish minister. Perhaps my own<lb/> temper and disposition are to blame&#59; but&#44; if so&#44; is it not preferable<lb/> to retire into private life and live in peace&#44; than have them again<lb/> excited by the <sic>disagreeabilities</sic> of a Jewish Congregation&#63;<lb/> In <placeName>St. Thomas</placeName>&#44; I even offered to serve them gratuitously&#44; as<lb/> salary was the bone of contention among the members&#44; provided<lb/> they would be at peace with each other. This&#44; the party in power<lb/> would not suffer&#59; and subsequently I accepted a very trifling</p>
		<pb n="2"/>
			<p>salary&#44; which was generally 3 quarters in amount&#44; and was content<lb/> to receive it in any manner&#44; taking whatever was offered me&#44; which was<lb/> not unfrequently 20 dollars at a time&#33; But it was useless. An<lb/> angel from Heaven would not satisfy them&#44; and I&#44; who possess<lb/> no angelic quality of course found it beyond my capability. To<lb/> enumerate the indignities I suffered would fill a volume&#59; and<lb/> I endured them patiently till threatened with personal violence.<lb/> It was time to resign&#59; and as <placeName>St. Thomas</placeName> presented less advantages<lb/> than <placeName>Kingston</placeName>&#44; behold me here again&#44; welcomed with an intensity<lb/> of feeling I was unprepared for&#44; and what is more&#44; with expressions<lb/> of profound regret that I ever left. My impression always was&#44;<lb/> that neither by preparatory study nor habits&#44; inclination&#44; or temper<lb/> was I ever intended or <sic>capacitated</sic> to minister before the<lb/> Lord&#59; circumstances forced the situation on me&#59; and now&#44;<lb/> having&#44; without the needful qualifications&#44; gained a reputation<lb/> I am unwilling to damage it by continuing in a profession<lb/> where there are so many candidates better adapted to supply<lb/> vacancies than myself. I am not ignorant that the Congregation<lb/> in <placeName>N. O.</placeName> give me the preference to any other&#59; this is flattering to my<lb/> feelings&#44; an unction to my vanity if you like&#44; but for my own<lb/> part&#44; the course I have pursued in declining the appointment&#44;<lb/> must&#44; after this candid avowal&#44; be deemed satisfactory by you.<lb/> I have now unbosomed myself&#44; and shall be glad to hear<lb/> your opinion&#44; as I always set the highest value&#44; on whatever<lb/> emanated from you.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I need not say how delighted I shall<lb/> be to hear from <persName>Miss DeCordova</persName> her estimate of my obt friend</p>
		<pb n="3"/>
			<p><persName>Leeser</persName>. You will find her a young person of fine mind&#44;<lb/> great strength of character&#44; intelligent and feeling. I beg you<lb/> will&#44; in concert with all my good friends in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>&#44;<lb/> endeavour to render her stay&#44; which is likely to be of some<lb/> continuance&#44; as agreeable as possible. She is exceedingly<lb/> dear to every member of our family&#44; and the attention shown<lb/> her will be valued as if it were paid to ourselves. I<lb/> have prepared her to be pleased with you and your conversation<lb/> and being persuaded that you have lost none of your<lb/> powers of amusing and instructing&#44; she expects to glean much<lb/> information&#44; and derive great pleasure from your society.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">There are some small pecuniary matters to<lb/> be settled between us&#44; which would have been arranged<lb/> ere I quitted <placeName>St. Thomas</placeName>&#44; had your agent there <persName>Mr. M B<lb/> Simmonds</persName> furnished me with the accot. in time. I will<lb/> see to it and shortly forward you the amot.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">Enough for this time&#44; so with prayers<lb/> to the searcher of Hearts that your entreaties on behalf<lb/> of yourself and Congregation may be heard and favourably<lb/> received&#44; and that you may all be inscribed in His eternal<lb/> registers for long life&#44; salvation&#44; and pardon&#59; and with the<lb/> best wishes of <persName>Mrs. N.</persName> and myself to you and all friends</p>
          <p rend="indent(4)">I am</p>
          <p rend="indent(5)">your friend &#38; well wisher</p>
