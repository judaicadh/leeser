                what is the<lb/> cost? The heavy postage will not permit the circulation of<lb/>

                me<lb/> to correct you by stating that all the public works, with the<lb/> exception
                of the <placeName>Rideau Canal</placeName>, are constructed at the sole<lb/> expense
                of <placeName>Canada</placeName>—tho the money is loaned in
                    <placeName>England</placeName><lb/> the interest is regularly paid &amp; the

            <p rend="indent(1)">You are aware that our legislature is now in session—they<lb/> met
                on <date>28 Nov</date>. All is quiet here, prosperous as ever &amp; prospects<lb/>
                good as well in the country as in the city where the<lb/> improvements are not less
                than have been art<add>?</add> during<lb/> the last two years. Rents high, property
                daily increasing in value<lb/> preparation for building on a large scale—all denote
                the<lb/> happy effects of a stable government I wish we could be<lb/> tempted
                    <add>?</add>—but I assure you the <add>?</add> of the<lb/> trader</p>

            <p>winter is no bar to the enjoyment thereof. What attraction<lb/> you can find in the
                unsettled weather of your middle states<lb/> at one time burning under a
                    <add>?</add>—at another all the<lb/> communications with the surrounding world
                cut off by an awful<lb/> snow storm followed as usual by rain &amp; the
                    <sic>concequent</sic><lb/> inundation of your streets. I say its strange state
                to exist<lb/> under so varied a climate as your “temperate regions.” We have had
                no<lb/> lack of snow &amp; sleighing of course. Snow shoeing has become a very<lb/>
                fashionable exercise much indulged in by ladies. I am<lb/> endeavoring to have your
                work subscribed for by the library<lb/> of our legislature—if so acted I shall call
                upon <persName>Mr Ramsay</persName> for his<lb/> copy. <persName>Mr David &amp;
                    Doctor</persName> desire to be remembered<lb/> to you, as also <persName>Myer
                    Solomon</persName> &amp; all the members of our<lb/> family. <persName>Adolphia
                    M</persName> &amp; his lady are on <add>?</add> to<lb/>
                <placeName>three Rivers</placeName>. The advocates for reform have resolved
                upon<lb/> not urging us to a division of the congregation—being <add>?</add>
                probably<lb/> with the injury already committed by their peaks. It take little
                interest<lb/> in the state of <sic>shool</sic> matters, having tired of all the
                bickerings &amp; broils<lb/> that so lamentably exist between the members of
                all<lb/> is <hi rend="underline">inculcated</hi>—they follow in the train. Such is
                the religion of our<lb/> people—goodwill &amp; clarity are not characteristics—no
                    <hi rend="underline">Christian</hi><lb/> feeling. I hope the new Rabbi will
                prove a Benefactor<lb/> to this race—much time must elapse before he can act
                decisively<lb/> but I trust he will settle all differences. Sincerely yours</p>
