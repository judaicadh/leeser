			<p>Revd and Dear Sir&#44;</p>
          <p rend="indent(3)">In compliance with your request and indeed<lb/> I consider it no more than a duty on my part towards you to acquaint<lb/> you that on <date>Monday</date> afternoon last I received yr. Packet a letter from <persName>Mr. H.</persName><lb/> <date>Feby 5th</date>&#58; I have very little time left on my hands now&#44; I must most fervently pray<lb/> and entreat you to excuse haste and writing&#44; as I have been so very<lb/> busy this day&#59; in other duties and replying to <persName>Mr. H.</persName> that it is approaching to <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> but I will give you some little extracts of his letter for <hi rend="underline">your guidance</hi> Trusting<lb/> to your honor and integrity that you will not make use of my name neither<lb/> in this case&#44; or in the other of <persName>M.</persName> for heaven be my witness that there is no harm<add>&#63;</add><lb/> but <sic>dont</sic> wish my name in question since we have all <hi rend="underline">some good friends</hi> always<lb/> on the <hi rend="underline">look out</hi>. therefore my Dr. friend let it be <add>Hebrew</add> the information is for<lb/> your guidance at the same time I assure you from the 1st syllable to the last<lb/> there is not one disrespectful to you&#44; on the contrary he speaks high&#8212;where<lb/> I said to him in my letter <del>he replies</del> <hi rend="underline">that none should be revered unless for</hi><lb/> high moral &#38; religious diligency&#34; &#34;<hi rend="underline">a man in holy office should be raised &#38;</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">not lowered</hi>&#8212;he replies&#44; &#34;no removal has taken place&#8212;that nothing has been<lb/> done to lower our former Hazan in the estimation of the world indeed&#8212;and<lb/> so <persName>Mr. H</persName> goes on replying on my remarks&#8212;<sic>than</sic> he goes on informing me<lb/> I may say&#44; almost the same as you did in your first letter. I will go on now with fewer traits<lb/> &#34;In the first place not a person in the whole congregation says or can<lb/> say aught against <persName>Mr. Leeser&#39;s</persName> reputation.&#34;&#8212;I flattered myself<lb/> that I was and that <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> also considered me his friend&#8212;</p>
			<p>I feel satisfied that the congregation will not again find a person<lb/> combining all the qualities of a Hazan and lecturer and possessing<lb/> the talents of <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> and no one desires or can detract from his<lb/> merits he has done more for the Jews in <placeName>America</placeName> than any other</p>
		<pb n="2"/>
			<p>Hazan in these <placeName>United States</placeName> and a testimonial &#38;c &#38;c<lb/> &#34;but I fear he has gone too far to heal the asperity of feeling with<lb/> which he has spoken of so many of the members since he has<lb/> <hi rend="underline">ceased to be our Hazan</hi>.&#34; so far for the extracts I replied to<lb/> his obliging letter on every point that I would not arrogate on<lb/> me the office of a Judge&#44; and indeed was I asked to form a just<lb/> intimate of the subject I should hear both sides <add>Hebrew</add> I was<lb/> an advocate for moderation &#38; a reconciliation that I considered you an<lb/> honor to the house of <placeName>Israel</placeName> at large not only in <placeName>America</placeName> and you<lb/> have been <add>Hebrew</add> and that after 20 years in office that the<lb/> misunderstanding between you and the congregation should be within a<lb/> nut shell &#40;as he expresses it&#41; I could not but regard not only with<lb/> regret but as a calamity I entertained the hope that he would continue his<lb/> kind regards towards you and so on. I must shorten my letter but I<lb/> think you have enough of it&#44; it appears that they are exasperated<lb/> at your exposing them in the Occident&#44; I hope it will all be peace<lb/> yet. Let me once more as a brother&#44; friend&#44; <sic>reccomend</sic> you give in a little<lb/> and hope you will be restored which will be the happiest news you<lb/> will give me. Again let me request your secrecy <hi rend="underline">particularly</hi> what<lb/> I might have wrote of <persName>M.</persName> as it is only true&#44; but still as he is a friend and<lb/> a good young man I <sic>dont</sic> wish him to know that nay thing about him was<lb/> utterd by me <add>Hebrew</add> I also must acquaint you that <persName>Mr. H.</persName> knows nothing of<lb/> your having informed me all in your first letter so let it stand as it is&#44;<lb/> please to favor me with your reply and that matters have taken a favorable<lb/> change. <persName>M.</persName> sets off on <date>Saturday</date> next from <placeName>Liverpool</placeName> you will please to let</p>
		<pb n="3"/>
			<p>know if you have seen <persName>Mr. H.</persName> I must confess that his letter is of a <add>&#63;</add><lb/> and that his feelings are respectful towards you. Wishing you every success</p>
          <p rend="indent(7)">I remain</p>
          <p rend="indent(7)">yours most truly</p>
          <p rend="indent(8)"><persName role="author">D Meldola</persName></p>
			<p>I must add that I wrote to <persName>Mr. H.</persName> that as<lb/> &#34;<hi rend="underline">since my first reading your works I entertaind</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">the highest respect for your name&#34; the greatest esteem&#34;.</hi> I believe I did my duty towards<lb/> you as much as a father&#44; now you must do the same towards me as a son take<lb/> my advice <sic>dont</sic> be too hard get <persName>Mr. H.</persName> your friend again&#44; give in a little&#44; and <sic>dont</sic><lb/> allow your opponents to have their way&#44; I wish I was there to impress all this on your<lb/> mind for it is only <add>Hebrew</add> abandon this for a while <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add></p>
