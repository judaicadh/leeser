PREFACE. 



The kind reception which has been extended to my first series of 
Discourses&#44; published four years ago&#44; and the frequent inquiries for 
a continuation of the same&#44; have emboldened me to appear again 
before the public with this new claimant of their favour.&#8212; The pres&#8211; 
ent collection is rather less than a half of the former &#59; since various 
interruptions&#44; which I need not enumerate&#44; independently of the 
shorter period during which they were delivered&#44; prevented me 
from speaking as often as I might have wished. It is truly to be 
regretted that so far public addresses on religious topics have con&#8211; 
stituted but a small portion of our devotional exercises in all the 
countries where the English is spoken &#59; and I believe that it may 
be said without any vanity on my part&#44; that in our Synagogue was 
the first attempt made for about ten years past to give religious in&#8211; 
struction in lectures. It can easily be imagined that there are 
many difficulties in the way of a successful pursuit of the calling of 
a public teacher among our people in this country&#44; owing chiefly to 
the fact&#44; that we are composed of persons from every European 
nation&#44; and that therefore to many the English language is partly 
unintelligible&#44; especially as in an oration the ideas cannot be always 
conveyed in very simple language&#44; without divesting the subject of 
all dignity. Still much might be done in furtherance of the intro&#8211; 
duction and support of teaching by lectures&#44; if those sufficiently 
well acquainted with the vernacular tongue of England and 
America would lend their countenance&#44; and elect either ministers 
capable of speaking no less than reading after the accepted mode&#44; 
or appoint public lecturers in addition to the usual officers of the 
Synagogue. No doubt the latter method would be more in accord&#8211; 
ance with the public wants &#59; because the Reader proper has to per&#8211; 
form duties sufficiently laborious without having to preach when 
the usual service is finished&#44; or during the same. Besides this&#44; it is

VI PREFACE. 

not likely that&#44; generally speaking&#44; there will be found many capa&#8211; 
ble of officiating with equal ability in both capacities&#44; of Preachers 
and Headers&#59; especially as the requisite qualities for both stations 
have little in common beyond an acquaintance with the Hebrew 
language &#59; since our worship is altogether in this tongue&#44; and no 
one can be competent to expound the Text correctly without being&#44; 
to say the least&#44; moderately well versed in the original dialect of 
the Bible. &#8212; But there are two difficulties in the way&#58; I mean that 
the smallness of our congregations and their limited means are great 
obstacles to carrying out this plan&#44; even if competent preachers could 
be found&#44; which is not the case now&#44; except in very small numbers&#44; 
owing to there being no schools of our own on a liberal scale&#44; either 
in England or America. Hence the whole number of preachers as 
far as known to me among the Jews speaking English is but four &#59; 
to wit &#58; Mr. David Isaacs&#44; of Liverpool and Manchester&#44; England &#59; 
Mr. Samuel M. Isaacs&#44; of the Congregation Benai Yeshurun&#44; New 
Yoi&#8211;k &#59; Mr. Moses N. Nathan&#44; of the German Congregation&#44; King&#8211; 
ston&#44; Jamaica&#44; and myself. It is true that occasionally lectures were 
delivered before the above commenced the calling of public teachers 
and since&#44; by the late Kev. Gershom M. Soixas&#44; of New York&#44; the 
late Rev. Emanuel N. Carvalho&#44; of Philadelphia&#44; Rev. A. H. Co&#8211; 
hen&#44; of Eichmond&#44; Dr. Jacob De La Motta&#44; of Charleston&#44; and 
several other ministers&#44; besides occasional volunteer lectures from 
laymen &#40;if such a word can be with propriety used among Israel&#8211; 
ites&#41; &#59; but no appointment was ever made with a view to sermons 
except in the case of the Messrs. Isaacs&#44; since Mr. Nathan and my&#8211; 
self were only elected as Readers&#44; and our speaking has therefore 
been a voluntary mPter. The general wish&#44; however&#44; which has 
been expressed by many congregations to have sermons delivered 
in their Synagogues&#44; chiefly at Charleston and St. Thomas&#44; and the 
Portuguese Congregations of London and Jamaica&#44; will no doubt 
lead ultimately to capable persons being appointed as teachers of the 
&#34;Word&#44; and may induce several intelligent young men to qualify 
themselves for the ministry by careful preparation. The great evil 
hitherto prevailing has been that literary attainments have not been 
expected of our Readers&#59; but it is to be hoped&#44; that either addi&#8211; 
tional officers will be appointed&#44; or that those only will be selected 
who&#44; in addition to a good voice and an acquaintance with the 
liturgy&#44; have sufficient capacity to speak to their brethren if occa&#8211; 
sion requires. There is however in the usual management of the 
Synagogue something inconsistent with the appointment of men of

endowment to the station of minister&#44; inasmuch as the temporal 
rulers have too much direct interference with the Hazan in every 
public act in which he can engage. Now it is all well and proper 
to leave the management of every temporal concern in the hands 
of the President and his assistants &#59; but the minister should not bo 
in the discharge of his proper duties altogether subservient to the 
temporal managers&#44; who ought to confine themselves strictly to 
their branch of duty&#44; and leave the public worship in the proper 
hands of those elevated to conduct it. It is in the nature of man to 
desire freedom of action &#59; and the same feeling therefore which ren&#8211; 
ders us restive under political subjection&#44; will also create an uneasi&#8211; 
ness&#44; far from promoting harmony&#44; in the minds of ministers of 
religion if they are rendered subservient to persons who evidently 
cannot be more religious and better informed than they are them&#8211; 
selves. &#8212; No doubt this evil originated in former years in the large 
congregations of Europe&#44; which were always provided with Eabbins 
and teachers in sufBcient numbers to require of the Reader nothing 
more than certain duties in the Synagogue&#44; for which the chief 
requisites were&#44; besides a correct moral and religious conduct&#44; a 
thorough knowledge of the accepted tunes and the manner of pei&#39;&#8211; 
forming the service&#44; and these qualities very often constituted the 
whole of the qualifications demanded or desired. But the times 
have changed &#59; and in America and England up to this moment 
there is not more than one Rabbi who can preach in English&#44; the 
otiiers being Germans&#44; and those who are in this country came 
among us but recently &#59; consequently it seems but reasonable to ex&#8211; 
tend to the Readers some more consideration than they now enjoy&#44; 
if the public expect duties from them&#44; which their predecessors did 
not or could not accomplish. For as it is now&#44; few indeed will be 
found&#44; who have minds of sufficient capacity to acquire a knowledge 
of sciences and languages&#44; to qualify themselves for the station of 
Reader and Lecturer&#44; when they see that the pursuit of the legal 
and medical professions give them so much more ease&#44; influence&#44; 
and importance in society. It may be said&#44; that persons should 
bring into the ministry a devotion to this noble calling&#44; which will 
rise above the annoyances and deprivations of life &#58; yet this is all 
veil enough when the mind has once reached this elevation of piety 
by a long train of reflection and a long course of virtuous actions &#59; 
but it cannot be expected that young men will qualify themselves 
for a station which is fraught with annoyance and deprivation&#44; 
when the same labour otherwise directed will have very different

results. And surely it is the interest of all those feeling sincerel&#59;y 
the holiness of our faith&#44; to make it by their acts better understood 
and more loved&#44; or&#44; in other words&#44; to be the means of inducing 
those endowed with high intellect to stop forward to assume with 
pleasure and an animated ardour the responsible office of teacher 
of that blessed religion&#44; which is our own inheritance&#44; and our 
heavenly patrinjony from ages which reach to the verge of civil&#8211; 
ization. 

In Germany&#44; principally I believe in the larger cities&#44; for in&#8211; 
stance Hamburg&#44; Berlin&#44; Glogau&#44; Prague&#44; Frankford&#44; Munich&#44; and 
no doubt other places&#44; Eabbins and lecturers have been appointed 
chiefly with the view of delivering weekly or occasional sermons &#59; 
and of these&#44; the fame of Bernays&#44; Salomon&#44; Kley&#44; Plessner&#44; Sachs&#44; 
and others&#44; has reached us even at this distance &#59; and lately Miss 
Goldsmith&#44; of London&#44; has rendered a service to our literature by 
translating twelve sermons of Dr. Salomon into English&#44; although it 
must be remarked that occasionally this learned preacher endeavours 
to force his own peculiar views rather too glaringly upon our atten&#8211; 
tion. But it is to be expected that&#44; as with every thing else&#44; there 
will be a difference of opinion among the honestly thinking in mat&#8211; 
ters of religion likewise&#44; the more so since of late certain persons 
calling themselves reformers have endeavoured to introduce changes 
in our mode of worship. Now Dr. S. is the principal organ of this 
portion&#44; a small one indeed thus far&#44; and hence we cannot be sur&#8211; 
prised that we cannot always approve altogether of his ideas or of 
the manner in which they are presented to us &#59; though to do him 
justice his style is very beautiful and fascinating&#44; and his advice 
generally wholesome and pious. It is to be regretted that as yet 
the works of our other preachers have not obtained currency among 
the English&#8211;speaking Jews &#58; still we may indulge the hope that by 
degrees such a taste may be awakened among them&#44; that they will 
desire to possess these books&#44; when the demand will no doubt bo 
answered by some one capable of executing the task. 

Whether preaching has been extensively introduced into the other 
European countries&#44; I am not able to tell&#44; not having any means at 
hand to answer the inquiry satisfactorily. But there is no doubt 
that a general desire for information has been awakened&#44; and that 
in many places persons adequate for the labour have been summoned 
to extend a knowledge of religion among us. It is therefore also 
gratifying to announce&#44; that latterly the Congregation at Baltimore 
and the German Congregation of this city have appointed public 

<pb n="ix"/>

PREFACE. IX 

teachers solely for the purpose of diffusing instruction. But as both 
congregations are mostly composed of Germans&#44; and as the gentle&#8211; 
men elected are not yet acquainted with the English&#44; the speaking 
is necessarily done in German&#44; and hence it becomes in the first in&#8211; 
sUxnce useful to a section only of our people residing in this country. 
Nevertheless it is a source of congratulation to see the increased de&#8211; 
mand for religious knowledge&#44; and it is to be hoped that this good 
spirit may not alone be permanent&#44; but become extended to other 
places which are as yet unsupplied with proper teachers. &#8212; Thus 
much may be said&#44; that&#44; although some may not at present perceive 
the use and importance of an addition to our service&#44; which is at 
times somewhat long &#58; the usefulness of sermons will nevertheless 
at length be generally acknowledged&#44; so soon as a perseverance 
therein shall have demonstrated that thereby much information has 
been diffused&#44; which must necessarily be the case&#44; if the preachers 
or ministers are properly acquainted with their duties and alive to 
the wants of the people. 

Upon the whole&#44; however&#44; the English and American Jews owe 
it to themselves to do something for the spread of religion&#44; by es&#8211; 
tablishing schools for general and religious education&#44; whence ul&#8211; 
timately they may derive proper persons to become ministers and 
readers. For no matter how much learning may be diffused in 
German and elsewhere&#44; experience has proved that learned men 
even coming from there are but little qualified&#44; except by a long 
and painful course of study&#44; and then only in a defective manner 
after all&#44; to become good pulpit orators. It is one thing to learn to 
read and write a foreign language&#44; but something very different to 
acquire a facility for expressing one&#39;s ideas with propriety and ease&#44; 
which is so highly necessary in the composition of sermons. &#8212; And 
if the ministry should then be sought by those whom the people 
know and esteem&#44; and who are of their own friends and kindred&#58; 
the standard of respectability of a Jewish Reader would be raised&#44; 
and his station carry also with it more weight&#44; than it now does&#44; 
when the congregations are compelled to elect entire strangers to 
the highest honour m their gift as Jews&#44; as they but rarely find 
native citizens qualified for the station in any manner whatever. 

Not many years back such an advice would have been useless&#44; 
owing to the then small number of Israelites in this country. But 
they are daily increasing&#44; by immigration from the crowded dis&#8211; 
tricts of Europe &#59; and although the new&#8211;comers are themselves un&#8211; 
acquainted with the English&#44; still their children will understand in

nil likelihood no other language &#59; hence the necessity of providing 
for the wants of the rising and coming generations. &#8212; All that is 
wanted is&#44; union&#44; concert&#44; and harmony&#59; and though our beginning 
may be small&#44; our end will still be very great. 

As regards the present publication I have to remark&#44; that it is&#44; 
like its predecessor&#44; the sincere effusion of my heart and conviction &#59; 
there is but little of artificial structure or a careful choice of words&#44; 
although I have always endeavoured to keep close to the standard of 
Scripture as understood by us. Whoever expects to find evidences 
of deep learning in these discourses will surely be disappointed &#59; 
since I can advance no claim to any extensive knowledge&#44; and if I 
could&#44; I would think a sermon not the vehicle for conveying it to 
the public&#44; believing&#44; as I do&#44; that a religious lecture should be so 
simply constructed as to he intelligible&#44; for the greater part at least&#44; 
to the humblest capacity. The preacher ought to seek to enlist the 
feeling and judgment of his audience&#44; but not to astonish them by 
the display of his own depth of information&#44; by which he would 
clearly strive to glorify himself&#44; without doing the least towards 
extending the kingdom of the Lord over the hearts of the flock in&#8211; 
trusted to his care. 

I cannot conclude these remarks without returning my sincere 
thanks to my friends at home and abroad who have so kindly&#44; and 
in nii.ny cases without any solicitation&#44; recommended and circulated 
my works&#44; especially the first series of Discourses. This was an act 
of kindness I had no right to expect&#44; and could only proceed from 
a belief that some little good might be derived from my labours. It 
would indeed be a source of high enjoyment to one whose days have 
not been free from sorrow and trial to bo able to believe&#44; that his 
striving has been of some use&#44; if even it be only to arouse his 
brothers in faith to stop forward unto the holy work&#44; and to labour 
with more success and prosperity&#44; though hardly with more honest 
Koal than their friend&#44;

Brethren &#33; 

The recurrence of the season of repentance has 
called us again to the house of our Father&#44; to offer 
up in his presence the sacrifice of a contrite heart. 
For disguise it as we may&#44; it must be acknowledged 
that the names of Bosh Ilashanah and Yom Kippur 
awaken in the mind of an Israelite ideas of devotion 
and a renewal of a resolution to become reconciled 
to Him above whom by our misdeeds we have haply 
offended. Be it admitted that this is owinsj&#59; to our 

<pb n="3"/>

system of education&#44; nurtured by early instruction&#44; 
encouraged by example&#44; and peradventure fostered 
by the fear of punislimont. Admit it to be so&#59; yet 
we say&#44; Blessed be that system&#44; honoured be that 
early instruction&#44; welcome be that example&#44; ay&#44; thrice 
blessed be that fear which tend to draw closer the 
bonds which unite man to his Maker&#44; which&#44; so to 
say&#44; remove the barriers which stand between him 
and his true happiness. &#8212; For&#44; what is it that is to be 
effected by this exhibition of devotional feelings&#63; is 
the greatness of any one man or sect of men to be 
promoted thereby &#63; or is the wealth of a class of 
priests to be augmented&#63; will it bring power to 
the teachers even of religion &#63; None of these can 
surely be the result&#44; as in our present state the influ&#8211; 
ence of religious superiors is but little heeded&#44; and 
can&#44; from a combination of circumstances&#44; not be 
very extensively exercised &#59; on the contrary&#44; what&#8211; 
ever is done for the extension of relicrious feelinofs is 
solely beneficial to the community at large&#44; because 
every participant is thus rendered a more worthy&#44; 
more intelligent&#44; and more happy member of the 
community&#44; than he couKl otherwise be. For name 
not the delusive dictates of a worldly philosophy&#44; that 
would inculcate honesty from mere prudential mo&#8211; 
tives &#58; such motives will not stand the test of tempta&#8211; 
tion &#59; they will yield to the influence of interest when&#8211; 
ever this loudly calls. Name not love of honour&#33; 
Ambitious men seek elevation whenever the oppor&#8211; 
tunity offers&#44; regardless of the means which load to 
their desired end. Wisdom also and learnino&#58; in 
worldly things are not safeguards against temptation&#59; 
for the worldly wise are not always wise&#44; nor are the

learned always prudent. No&#59; neither prudential phi&#8211; 
losophy&#44; nor ambition&#44; nor wisdom&#44; nor worldly learn&#8211; 
ing&#44; will save you from doing the wrong&#44; but only 
the knowledge of the ways of our heavenly King&#59; for 
this will guide you ever aright&#44; and in acting accord&#8211; 
ingly you need never fear of injuring yourselves or 
others. &#34;When then I see a multitude enter these 
walls&#44; when I hear&#44; as I have heard&#44; a unanimous 
shout of praise ascend from the mouths of hundreds 
of believers to the great Eternal&#39;s throne&#44; I feel a wish 
that thus might ever be their desire to serve Him 
whom their words declare their God &#59; for then would 
it be well with them and their children for ever. 
But alas &#33; we leave the house of God&#44; the Day of 
Atonement is past&#44; and yet rings in our ear the shout 
&#34;The Lord he is God&#33;&#34; the voice of the cornet yet 
vibrates within us&#58; when we forget that we have been 
actors in a holy scene&#44; witnesses of a sacred work&#44; 
listeners to the word of truth&#59; we enter anew into 
the deceitful press of worldly engagements&#44; forget 
the Rock who has formed us&#44; mindful only of aug&#8211; 
menting our wealth and increasing our importance 
in the eyes of men. It is sickening to reflect that so 
much devotion as is at times suddenly seen to flash 
up&#44; as does the light of some dim lamp when a sudden 
change of wind causes the flame to shoot upward&#44; 
should sink down again into dimness when the ex&#8211; 
citing cause is past. Happy indeed it is&#44; that the 
wind of the passions cannot extinguish the sacred 
flame&#44; or else we should be left in total mental dark&#8211; 
ness&#44; like the traveller in a swampy desert whose 
taper expires beneath the gust of air which he tain 
welcomed as cooling his fevered forehead&#44; burning

under the agony of weary exertions. Yes&#44; it is mel&#8211; 
ancholy in the extreme to be conscious that so many 
Days of Pardoning of Iniquity have recurred&#44; and 
yet the worshippers then assembled did not remain 
permanently united to their God&#44; whose forgiveness 
they invoked with apparent sincerity &#33; Does any one 
think it enough to worship once a year&#63; Have we 
not the ordinance of the seventh day as a perpetual 
covenant between God and the children of Israel &#63; 
why is this not also observed&#63; Ha&#33; is it interest&#44; 
the desire for Avealth that counsels us&#63; But wo&#33; wo&#33; 
that gold should tempt us to forego the pleasure of a 
tranquil mind and a peaceful soul rejoicing in her 
attachment to God&#33; Wealth&#33; how fleetina&#58; its 
blessings&#33; how deceptive its hope&#33; Religion&#33; O how 
everlasting in its blessings&#44; how sure the hopes it in&#8211; 
spires. 

Yet&#44; this land was blessed&#44; is blessed. Fruitful are 
its fields&#44; extensive are its forests&#59; through untrodden 
regions extend its thousand majestic rivers&#59; its sea&#8211; 
shore is crowded with the commerce of the world&#59; 
its sails whiten every ocean&#59; through its numerous 
towns resound the shouts of merriment&#59; the people 
are secured against oppression&#44; if they but j&#41;reserve 
the spirit of their laws&#59; peace may be said to dwell 
in the boundaries thereof&#44; and each man may sit under 
the shade of his fruit&#8211;tree with none to make him 
afraid. If ever prosperity seemed to have taken up 
her abode in any land&#44; this might have been pointed 
out to the inquiring sage&#59; since all the elements of 
contentment were so profusely scattered abroad. But 
lo&#33; the avarice of man has destroyed much of the

good we once saw&#44; and the hammer of tlie artisan 
has been arrested in the midst of plenty and peace&#59; 
the weaver&#39;s loom stands idle&#44; and even the press&#44; the 
supplier of intellectual repasts&#44; is almost paralyzed 
in an age boasting of knowledge and refinement. It 
is not for us to enter deeply in the causes of this spec&#8211; 
tacle&#59; enough it is so&#59; and does it not teach us&#44; in a 
language not to be misunderstood&#44; that worldly pur&#8211; 
suits will not always secure the object desired&#63; and 
that immoderate possessions fail to promote content&#8211; 
ment&#63; 

Yet there is a turn in the tide of prosperity&#44; as well 
as of wo&#44; and when greatness is at its height&#44; it sud&#8211; 
denly changes to degradation&#44; shame&#44; and ruin. Need 
we cite examples&#63; History teaches us of great con&#8211; 
querors&#44; overthrown on the day of triumph&#59; and ex&#8211; 
perience has informed us&#44; that wealth&#44; when seemingly 
the stronijest&#44; secured almost bevond the reach of 
casualties&#44; is then nearest utter prostration&#44; and we 
may almost say its possessor is near penury. The 
occurrences of the last few months have amply con&#8211; 
firmed this&#44; and also that success or failure in our 
enterprises are from a &#40;Source higher&#44; greater&#44; holier 
than human power or human wisdom&#59; and that per&#8211; 
son indeed must he blind to the events of the moral 
world&#44; who would suppose that what our own eyes 
have seen has not been the work of God. Yes&#44; we 
may freely assert&#44; that in order to prove how vain&#44; 
how deceitful&#44; how impotent are human endeavours&#44; 
has the Almighty permitted the blight of reverses 
and sudden changes to fall on many lands&#59; thus show&#8211;

skilfully soever they be arranged&#44; can we look forward 
to success&#44; if He&#44; to whom all is subject&#44; denies bis 
blessing. Call it not superstition&#44; imagine not it is 
blind bigotry&#44; to assert that in our own daily&#34; experi&#8211; 
ence we see the finger of God made manifest&#44; No&#44; 
friends&#44; no&#44; believing brethren&#44; it is indeed in these 
daily occurrences that we are reminded&#44; that there is 
a judging God superintending the affairs of man&#44; 
ready to exalt the humble to a high eminence&#44; and to 
cast the presumptuous into the depth of degradation. 
If we take such a view of life&#44; we will be comforted 
in our stations&#44; and be content with the sphere of 
action pointed out to us by circumstances&#44; the un&#8211; 
erring indicators of our call&#44; &#8212; Understand me not as 
saying&#44; that there is an inspiration vouchsafed to us 
by which we are taught to know the precise calling 
we are to follow&#44; but only as maintaining that to every 
man light is given&#44; and a road pointed out which&#44; if 
followed&#44; will teach him how to be useful to himself 
and others. There are&#44; accordingly&#44; many in private 
life who&#44; as fathers&#44; as friends&#44; or advisers do more 
to promote the service of Heaven&#44; than those who 
profess to be teachers of religion. To such it may 
be freely said&#44; &#34;Persevere&#44; pious ones&#44; your reward 
wall be great&#59;&#34; and of them it may be maintained&#44; 
that they are happy&#44; useful&#44; and content&#44; although 
wealth and importance in the sight of the world are 
not their portion. How few&#34;&#44; however&#44; are found 
willing to abide content with their lot&#33; alas&#33; how 
small is the number of the meek in spirit&#44; who seek

He sees no necessity for him to be distanced&#44; outdone

end. No day of rest is now known to his active 
spirit&#59; no festival&#44; no Sabbath&#44; restrains his step from 
busy pursuits &#59; may not sleep know his eyelids in the 
noon of night. For awhile his prosperity is seem&#8211; 
ingly boundless&#44; and wealth&#44; gold&#44; jewels crowd upon 
him in masses uncounted&#44; &#8212; he only sees before him 
an unending career of greater and farther aggran&#8211; 
dizement&#59; he therefore perceives no evil in his course. 
But suddenly the airy fabric breaks up like a spectral 
illusion of a nightly vision&#44; and the deceived dreamer 
at length discovers to his horror that he has grasped 
a shadow and pursued an atom&#44; an almost nothing. &#8212;

consolation can such as these find in their downfall &#63; 
where are they to seek for comfort&#44; seeing that their 
desired happiness has taken wing and left them to 
despair&#63; &#8212; And&#44; nevertheless&#44; for ends like these will 
men turn their hacks&#44; as it were&#44; npon the law of 
God&#44; and lend a deaf ear to the admonition of the 
Most High &#33; They lightly regard his favour&#44; provided 
they can be esteemed wealthy and powerful &#59; and if 
but riches and glory are theirs&#44; they heed not how 
many unwary have been deceived&#44; through how many 
rivers of blood they have to wade. And why &#63; be&#8211; 
cause they know not the pleasure of humble content&#59; 
because they heed not&#44; believe not&#44; know not the 
word of God. I speak advisedly&#44; they believe not&#44; 
they know not&#33; Think not&#44; brethren&#44; that a mere 
knowledge of the words of Scripture is such a knowl&#8211; 
edge as is required of us&#44; or that a mere acquiescence 
in the dogmas of the Bible is the belief demanded. 
Something more is necessary&#59; for you should know 
religion practically &#59; you should be agents&#44; foremost 
among the energetic who love God with all their 
heart&#44;with all their soul&#44; and with all their might&#59; 
and your belief should be displayed by an ever&#8211;resist&#8211; 
ing of all temptation which might make the pursuit 
of wealth and power the primary&#44; that of piety the 
secondary object of your life. The want of such 
knowledge and faith it is now which causes so many 
to err&#59; they have never learned to feel how happy&#44; 
how content they can be with small means&#44; while 
they are active in the service of their Maker &#59; they 
know not&#44; they believe not&#44; that the righteous do not 
envy their powerful neighbours&#44; and wish not&#44; though 
humble&#44; to exchange places with the proud and pre&#8211;

sumptuous. Besides&#44; though acknowledging con&#8211; 
stantly in words their being mortal and accountable&#44; 
they act as though their mortality were doubtful&#44; and 
their accountability as if it never would be exacted. 
Hence&#44; as we said above&#44; they halt at nothing in their 
chosen course&#44; and year after year elapses&#44; and they 
pursue the same path of destruction&#44; and excuses ri&#8211; 
diculous in the extreme are offered to lull their own 
conscience&#44; and to impose upon others the idea that 
they are sincere in thinking themselves acting rightly. 
Shallow devices&#33; whom do they deceive&#63; can they 
hide their enormity from themselves&#44; though others 
are deceived&#63; or even if they do impose on themselves&#44; 
does the Almighty not know &#63; does He not search 
their inward thoughts&#63; does lie not understand the 
desire of every heart&#63; &#8212; Yes&#44; truly does this One 
know&#44; truly does He understand the vanity of our 
striving&#59; the impotency of our knowledge&#59; the weak&#8211; 
ness of our strength. He has therefore ordained two 
rem.o.dies for our sinful nature. The one&#44; the law 
He imparted to our ancestors&#59; the second&#44; repentance. 
The law contains the living precepts&#44; which if a man 
obey he will live through them. In their execution 
there is no strife&#44; no oppression&#44; no hatred of our 
equals&#44; no envy of our superiors&#59; but all is peace 
within and love without. For the man that truly 
endeavours to shape his course by the law of Moses 
has the cynosure of the bright starry heaven&#44; which 
never sets&#44; which never is obscured by clouds and 
darkness&#44; but ever guides him onward &#8212; onward &#8212; to 
his port of destination &#8212; the embrace of his Maker &#8212;

the dictates of sinful ambition&#44; we go astray from this 
holy path &#59; if the temptations of a sinful hfe have in&#8211; 
duced us to forego our inward peace &#8212; our love of 
God &#8212; our affection for our fellow&#8211;men &#58; then is the 
remedy of penitence provided for us by which we can 
become reconciled to the Lord of our destinies. We 
are not utterly rejected&#44; because of our wrongs&#59; we 
are not abhorred&#44; because we have erred. No &#33; for 
&#34;He being merciful forgiveth iniquity&#44; and destroy&#8211; 
eth not&#44; nor awakeneth all his wrath&#59;&#34; this is the 
language of Scripture&#44; and presents us the consoling 
hope&#44; that the God of love&#44; &#34;all whose ways are jus&#8211; 
tice&#44;&#34; and Avho himself is Truth&#44; will receive us again 
in favour when we return to Him in confidence of 
pardon&#44; in consciousness of sin. We must not how&#8211; 
ever exculpate our misdeeds by vain excuses&#44; by false&#44; 
specious&#44; self&#8211;complacency &#59; for this would be cling&#8211; 
ing with lingering affection to our deformity&#44; whilst 
we profess to regret its existence. Neither must fear 
of loss prevent our leaving off the evil of our ways &#59; 
for such a course would be telling in effect that&#44; 
though we acknowledge our sinfulness&#44; we cannot 
renounce the cause of our sinning&#44; and that we love 
thus the creature more than the blessed Creator&#44; &#8212; 
the means of subsistence better than everlasting bliss&#44; 
in short&#44; the world with its allurements better than 
God&#33; 

Kor must the opinion of the world deter us. For 
there are many who sin from a love of companionship&#44; 
so to say&#59; they have associates who pursue an un&#8211; 
godly course of life&#44; while they at first have but light 
foibles&#44; or transgressions in miniature&#59; by degrees

ate habits have degenerated yet fartlier into vices&#44; 
but still the companionship of others causes them to 
look upon them as excusable&#44; ay&#44; as matters perhaps 
to boast of. Need I prove to you by examples innu&#8211; 
merable&#44; that men have been drunkards together&#63; 
robbers together&#63; blasphemers together&#63; debauchees 
together &#63; when each by himself would not have dared 
so to brave public opinion &#63; Say not it was the mean 
low&#8211;minded villain that sunk thus &#8212; would to Heaven 
that this were so &#33; but in all ages the wise too have 
sinned&#44; and a Korah&#44; a chief in his tribe&#44; rebelled 
against the chosen of God&#44; the confided in of men &#59; 
princes of their families maligned the land of promise&#59; 
a son of David drove his father from his home &#59; a 
Jeroboam erected golden calves to mislead the peo&#8211; 
ple&#44; and innumerable others&#44; renowned for intellect&#44; 
have ever sunk in the slough of iniquity. Were it 
that no man could hope to find others willing to join 
him&#44; he would hardly be so eccentric &#8212; that is the 
precise idea which rules many &#8212; as to act wickedly 
for himself&#59; but as unfortunately the sinners are so 
innumerable&#44; the lover of fellowship cannot see why 
be should be so unfashionable&#44; so odd&#44; so eccentric&#44; 
so singular&#44; as to adhere to the homely ideas and cus&#8211; 
toms of the Jewish nation&#44; &#34;For who nowadays&#44;&#34; he 
may say and think&#44; &#34; heeds such antiquated notions&#63;&#34; 
But let us argue the point with him. What is there 
of the weakness of garrulous old age in the precept&#44; 
&#34;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God witJi all thy 
heart &#63;&#34; AVhat of dotage is to be discovered in the

made the observance of the Sabbath less useful &#63; We 
will admit&#44; that the wealthy idler&#44; to Avhom time is a 
burden the endurance of which is intolerable&#44; may 
not find any necessity for allowing his horse to rest 
on the seventh day&#59; he may not be able to appreciate 
wdiy he should abstain from following his pursuits 
of pleasure on the day of rest&#59; but how is it with 
the labourer&#44; the artisan&#44; the husbandman &#8212; have they 
not also a claim to enjoyment and relaxation &#63; is their 
toil never to end&#63; is their life to be one continual&#44; 
unbroken&#44; perpetual servitude&#63; &#8212; Or again&#58; &#34;And 
thou shalt make the Passover.&#34; Can the man of the 
world gainsay the debt of gratitude that is due to the 
Deity for the many benefits which Israel has received 
from his bounty &#63; &#8212; We could multiply these instances&#44; 
but for the present enough has been shown to prove 
the utter absurdity of such excuses. Yet the sociable 
sinner will allege&#44; that it is unreasonable to forego 
the advantage of sinning as others do. lie imagines 
that others will outstrip him in the race of wealth 
and preferment&#44; unless he strives to emulate them. 
If one works on the Sabbath&#44; he will earn more than 
he who rests. This is the excuse constantly offered. 
Yet does it not appear to you&#44; without any argument&#44; 
that Sabbath&#8211;breaking cannot be defended on such 
grounds&#63; for&#44; if ever so much is gained thereby&#44; it is 
wrong to offend against acknowledged obligations. 
Besides all this&#44; it is not clear that offending the Deity 
is productive of wealth &#8212; or piety the companion of 
poverty. This&#44; however&#44; no one will maintain&#44; for 
not all the wicked are rich&#44; nor are the servants of 
God all languishing in want. Still&#44; and despite of all 
this evident refutation of the excuses of backsliding&#44;

we are deterred from amending&#44; because we would 
thereby appear inconsistent. We would be laughed 
at&#44; if we went to Synagogue&#44; where before we were 
seldom seen. We would be ridiculed&#44; if we were to 
cease our labour on the Sabbath&#44; which before we re&#8211; 
garded not. We would be called weak&#8211;minded&#44; if 
we refused joining a sinful repast&#44; participating in a 
drunken carousal&#44; because our conscience had only 
been newly awakened to the sinfulness of such doing. 
But why should we hesitate to separate ourselves 
from the throng of the thoughtless&#44; when we feel a 
call within to seek the approach to God &#63; Why should 
we fear to incur loss&#44; when we strive to make our 
peace with our Maker&#63; why should we wish to frame 
excuses unto ourselves&#44; when we come to appear be&#8211; 
fore the Searcher of hearts with the humble offering&#58; 
of prayer &#63;

accusation&#44; an entire rising above the thought of pal&#8211; 
try gain&#44; a complete severance from associates whose 
manners are corrupted and corrupting. &#8212; If this is 
our new conduct&#44; we will soon lose the pride of self&#8211;

resist temptation&#44; no matter how seductive it may 
appear. This is the heart of flesh of which the Scrip&#8211;

Brethren &#33; 

The festival&#44; on which we annually celebrate our 
redemption from the slavery we had to endure by 
divine decree in the land of Egypt&#44; is close at hand&#44; 
and it is meet&#44; according to the custom sanctified by 
usage&#44; law&#44; and feelings of gratitude&#44; that we should 
reflect Don this event with emotions of thankfulness 
to that infinite Being who watches over us in our af&#8211; 
flictions and is the Arbiter of all events which occur 
among the children of his creation. To the unthink&#8211; 
ing the recurrence of a festival is viewed either as a 
time of physical rejoicing&#44; or they neglect it as a sea&#8211; 
sou which merits not their regard. But not so with 
Israelites fortified by faith and instruction&#59; to them 
the festivals bring rejoicing and gratitude&#44; they hon&#8211; 
our them as seasons devoted to the service of the Al&#8211; 
mighty&#44; and they improve them as fit occasions to 
awaken a love for the divine law in their hearts. 
Let us view the going out of Egypt in the proper 
light&#44; not with the levity which unbelievers are apt 
to indulge in&#44; and we will discover in it&#44; what it was 
intended to be&#44; a beginning for the dawn of liberty&#44; 
not for Israel alone&#44; but for all nations&#44; and a libera&#8211;

for Jacob&#39;s sons alone&#44; but also for all tlie descend&#8211; 
ants of Koab. Without going too far into the de&#8211; 
tails of history&#44; we will briefly advert to the state of 
society in the days of Abraham and subsequently 
thereto. The only book which can correctly guide 
us is the book of Genesis&#44; as there exists no account 
having the least claim to authenticity equal to this&#44; 
and surely fabulous histories cannot much assist the 
inquirer after truth&#44; farther than to teach him how 
far the minds of reasoning men may be misled if in&#8211; 
correctly informed. To proceed&#58; When Abraham 
first began to diffuse the worship he professed&#44; we 
find that the country in which he lived&#44; then and 
now called Palestine and the land of Canaan&#44; was di&#8211; 
vided into innumerable little principalities and king&#8211; 
doms&#44; and every city almost appears to have been 
independent of its neighbour&#44; yet each subject to a 
king&#44; the arbiter of life and property&#44; as will appear 
from the address of the king of Sodom to Abram &#58; 
&#34; Give me the persons and the property taken unto 
thyself&#34; &#40;Genesis xiv. 21.&#41; War and bloodshed&#44; 
even to the extermination of entire tribes&#44; seem to 
have been the occupation of these petty tyrants&#59; 
whilst the morals and worship of the people seem to 
have been totally neglected. Tlie warnings of the 
flood and the miraculous confusion of tongues ap&#8211; 
pear to have left no trace behind&#44; so regardless was 
every one of the divine decrees given to Noah. A 
man was assaulted for harbouring strangers&#59; and 
even in Egypt&#44; a country so boasted for its learning 
and a knowledge of true religion&#44; as some aver&#44; a 
wayfarer justly dreaded the loss of life&#44; because his 
wife was blessed with a comely person. The coun&#8211;

tries surrounding Palestine were no better off&#59; since 
we tincl that princes of various tribes confederated to 
make a murderous inroad from the distant Euphrates 
unto the confines of Egypt. Also in a later period&#44; 
when Jacob left the country of Aram between the 
rivers&#44; he was pursued by his relative Laban&#44; who 
carried with him an armed band of his own followers 
ready to do his bidding even to the slaughtering of 
women and children. What the condition of the 
more distant regions from the centre of civilization 
was we have no means of ascertaining&#59; still we may 
reasonably conclude&#44; that only the strong hand of 
every individual could secure to him the possession 
of life&#44; liberty&#44; and his laboriously acquired wealth. 
Peaceful pursuits&#44; uninfluenced by fear of predatory 
warfare&#44; could not be thought of&#59; the sword alone 
gave security&#44; and the strong of hand ruled heavily 
over the weak and timid. Whatever of truth was 
known on earth became the exclusive property of&#44; 
and Avas communicated&#44; as mysteries&#44; to an exclu&#8211; 
sive class of priests&#44; &#8211;who had peculiar privileges&#44; pe&#8211; 
culiar dress&#44; manners and knowledge from the rest 
of the community&#44; even if we admit that a knowl&#8211; 
edge of the true God was in their possession. This&#44; 
however&#44; is by no means certain. It is no doubt 
true that&#44; when the apostacy of mankind first began&#44; 
it was a wilful going astray&#44; &#8212; man refused to sub&#8211; 
mit to divine rule&#44; and followed ordinances of his 
own inventing &#59; and that&#44; whilst so transgressing&#44; the 
knowledge that there exists an almighty Creator&#44; 
who communicated his will to the progenitor of the 
human race&#44; was not taken from him &#58; yet it is not 
probable that he would teach his children the duties 

<pb n="20"/>

20 THE REDEMPTION OF ISRAEL.&#34; 

which lie refused to execute&#44; aud the kuowlcdore 
which did not withhold him from adopting errone&#8211; 
ous opinions. If even&#44; however&#44; to go a step farther&#44; 
the first ages communicated the truth to a chosen 
few&#44; and held up a symbolic worship to the multitude 
which they in their own hearts deemed to be false&#58; 
yet we may maintain that this did not continue for 
many centuries&#44; and that within five generations from 
the confusion of languages one chaotic state of irre&#8211; 
ligion pervaded all mankind with the exception of 
the few&#44; who practised the precepts handed down to 
them by &#34; the father of a multitude of people.&#34; In 
his day we yet find that a Malchi&#8211;Zedek was a priest 
of the Most High God&#44; residing in Salem&#44; afterwards 
the renowned city of Jerusalem. But when the laud 
of Canaan was conquered we do not find a vestige of 
the true worship among the Jebusites&#44; who then in&#8211; 
habited this part of Palestine&#44; and doubtless did so 
in the days of Abraham. It is due&#44; however&#44; to truth 
to state to you in this place&#44; that there is one passage 
in the book of Genesis which gives some colour to 
the hypothesis that it was customary to communicate 
the knowledge of the truth to a few&#44; to the exclusion 
of the many. It is in the following words &#40;Gen. xviii. 
18&#44; 19&#41; &#58; &#34; Seeing that Abraham shall surely become 
a great and mighty nation&#44; and all the nations of the 
earth shall be blessed in him. For I know him&#44; that 
he will command his children and his household after 
him&#44; and they shall keep the way of the Lord&#44; to do 
righteousness and justice&#44; in order that the Lord may 
bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken con&#8211; 
cerning him.&#34; In this extract&#44; we find that Abraham 
is praised for the knowledge God had of him&#44; &#34; that 

<pb n="21"/>

THE REDEMPTION OF ISRAEL. 21 

he would command his children and his honscbold 
after him&#44; to keep the way of the Lord&#59;&#34; from which 
phraseology it might be inferred that others possess&#8211; 
ed of the same knowledge would not so communicate 
it universally&#44; but only to a few&#44; or a class especially 
privileged for its acquisition. This however is the 
only passage which now occurs to me&#44; in the least 
calculated to favour the theory that heathenism is 
based upon truth. But admit the whole as proved &#59; 
say that the Creator was worshipped by the priests&#44; 
while the multitude fell prostrate before images&#44; gods 
made by their own hands&#59; grant that in the myste&#8211; 
rious writings which the sacerdotal order may have 
possessed they treasured up knowledge of high and 
holy things unknown to the unworthy unlettered&#44; 
superstitious nations whose spiritual guides they 
were &#40;I use the word spiritual guides in the sense it 
is used among us&#44; though they were seducers rather 
than guides&#41; &#58; still we may reasonably desy the uUlity 
of any system&#44; which will leave the many in igno&#8211; 
rance&#44; and establish an aristocracy of information&#44; a 
tyraiuiy worse even than the fetters with which the 
tusk&#8211;master binds the slave after iinisliing his daily 
toil. For&#44; what is the object of religion&#63; It is to 
bind the creature to his Maker by the ties of affec&#8211; 
tionate devotion and reverential fear&#59; it is to teach 
man to feel that he is dependent upon the great Om&#8211; 
nipotent whose servant he is&#59; it is to teach the son 
of the earth to look to the inhnite Judofe to riy&#8211;ht 
him in his cause&#44; and to save him when in aflliction. 
In short&#44; religion should promote the love and fear 
of God&#44; and plant hope&#44; humility&#44; faith and confi&#8211; 
dence in the human breast&#44; of the lowly no less than

deception&#44; ho&#92;v is he to obtain the requisites of re&#8211; 
ligion to render his life happy and his death peace&#8211; 
ful&#63; He bows to the image of the sun&#58; is this to 
teach him devotion &#63; lie worships the abstraction of 
the planets &#58; is this to inspire him with faith &#63; In a 
word&#44; can error produce the effects of truth &#63; Even 
assume a man sincere and ardently devoted to the 
symbolic worship&#44; if you please to call it so&#58; still the 
pure adoration of the One Supreme&#44; the holy flame 
of devotion kindled in the pious mind by a contem&#8211; 
plation of his mighty deeds&#44; cannot grow up amidst 
the rank weeds of error. And if the priests or the 
privileged class&#44; we alluded to&#44; alone are possessed 
of a better knowledge&#44; and allow not the commu&#8211; 
nity to participate therein&#44; is it not&#44; as was stated&#44; 
forging galling chains of intolerable servitude of the 
mind&#44; injurious far more than the thraldom of the 
body&#63; But this latter calamity was also the legiti&#8211; 
mate consequence of the general degeneracy&#59; and 
tyranny and oppression followed in its train&#44; till all 
mankind groaned under the yoke of misrule&#44; and no 
nation was free&#44; while designing men&#44; under the garb 
of priests&#44; soothsayers&#44; oracles and diviners&#44; ruled by 
their advice or secret machinations the public mind. 
It is often boasted that universal toleration of all 
beliefs was the general custom of heathen people&#44; but 
that with the rise of revelation persecution for opin&#8211; 
ion&#39;s sake became more and more prevalent. But&#44; 
again&#44; we may reasonably question the general truth 
of the assertion. For although in certain lands there 
may have been no prohibition against worshipping

THE REDEMPTION OF ISRAEL. 23 

any of the many idealities which besotted men set 
up as gods&#58; still we find from authentic records&#44; and 
confirmed by traditions&#44; that it was dangerous to wor&#8211; 
ship the Lord of heaven and earth. &#8212; Of positive his&#8211; 
tory we have the account of Daniel&#44; which relates how 
his three friends were cast into a burning furnace&#44; 
because they woukl not worship the golden image of 
Nebuchadnezzar&#59; in Darius&#39;s reign a prohibition was 
promulgated against any one praying for a period of 
thirty days&#44; under pains of being cast into the lion&#39;s 
den. Ahab and Jezebel slew all the prophets of the 
Lord&#44; and only Elijah escaped. Antiochus and his 
generals endeavoured to banish totally from the He&#8211; 
brews the knowledge of their religion&#59; and a persecu&#8211; 
tion as bitter as ever was waged against us by any sect&#44; 
or which any people inflicted on another for the sake 
of a diflerence of opinion&#44; was waged for many years&#44; 
till the land was freed&#44; by bloody wars and unpar&#8211; 
alleled deeds of heroism&#44; from its ruthless oppres&#8211; 
sors. &#8212; Traditions and writings&#44; current only among 
ourselves&#44; do not lack instances of a similar nature&#59; 
and it is said that Abram&#44; before he left Ur in Chal&#8211; 
dea&#44; was tried by fire because of his belief in the 
One Supreme&#44; and for the destruction of his father&#39;s 
idols. An interesting narrative on this subject miglat 
easily be compiled&#44; but it would lead us too far from 
our present purpose. Enough has been shown that 
idolaters were not always tolerant&#59; and even if they 
had been&#44; what does it amount to&#63; simply that in 
the mode of worshipping common among them&#44; the 
things to be adored were unlimited&#44; and each person 
made unto himself such an emblem as his fancy 
chose&#44; and sought to attract attention&#44; as men now

do to articles of merchandise&#44; by exhibiting some 
proof of its superior excellence. AVitness the oracle 
erected by Micuh&#44; the Ephrairaite&#44; which by the man&#8211; 
agement of the pseudo&#8211;priest obtained a great ce&#8211; 
lebrity among the tribe of Dan&#44; at the time when 
idolatry nourished among Israelites. Witness also 
the oracle of Delphi&#44; and other divinations of ancient 
pagans&#44; where a certain degree of cunning and art&#8211; 
ful double&#8211;dealing benighted the minds of inquirers&#44; 
whilst they believed themselves in possession of divine 
replies. Of course&#44; under such a system it was dan&#8211; 
gerous for the worshippers of one falsity to attack 
that of the other too much&#44; and the policy of the 
priests&#44; who knew at least themselves that their art 
was mere deception&#44; must have been not to interfere 
with each other unless their interest suffered thereby. 
But if even we concede them a thorough and sincere 
conviction&#44; for the mind may labour under strange 
hallucinations&#58; still the great alleged toleration may 
have proceeded from the knowledge that there must 
be something yet beyond the things then adored&#44; more 
powerful&#44; more energetic&#44; and more hply. Never&#8211; 
theless a Socrates was accused of blasphemy for ap&#8211; 
proaching the truth&#59; and Moses feared to sacriiice 
unto God among Egyptians out of dread of persecu&#8211; 
tion. It will&#44; therefore&#44; appear that toleration was 
not inherent in paganism&#44; nor universal among pagan 
nations&#44; and it is not supported by any historic evi&#8211; 
dence to fasten intolerance upon the early possessors 
of revelation&#44; nor upon the receivers of the law from 
Sinai. Abraham was charitable to all &#59; his house re&#8211; 
ceived the traveller of the desert&#44; and believers and 
idolaters were fed of his bounty. With the Canaan&#8211;

ites he lived at peace&#44; and lie swore fealty and truth 
to people whom he once feared as enemies of his life. 
Isaac and Jacob were no less distinguished for their 
benevolence to the people among whom they dwelt&#59; 
and we may safely aver that the history of the patri&#8211; 
archs furnishes no instances where a single trace of 
intolerance or bigotry is discoverable. Certainly the 
fragment of the life of Joseph which has come dowii 
to us does not afford any evidence of intolerance &#59; for 
we find nowhere a picture of greater truth and fidelity 
than is given in that simple and short narrative. 
Equally futile is it to look in the law of Moses for 
evidences of intolerance. In not a single passage is 
persecution for opinion&#39;s sake allowed&#59; and if you 
take away the commandment enjoining the removal 
of idols from the land&#44; we have even no prohibition 
against the worship of idols in Palestine by strangers &#58; 
in truth&#44; it would appear that no one had any right 
to see after their conduct in their own houses &#59; and 
provided they offended not publicly the laws of the 
land&#44; no one could molest them according to our in&#8211; 
stitutions. The public prohibition of idolatry cannot&#44; 
however&#44; be called an act of intolerance. For em&#8211; 
phatically speaking the law of Moses was the political 
as well as the moral code of our people&#59; their thoughts&#44; 
their actions&#44; their worship&#44; and their hope and pros&#8211; 
perity&#44; were all to be regulated according to its ordi&#8211; 
nances &#59; idols were accordingly considered as a politi&#8211; 
cal nuisance&#44; militating by their presence against the 
sovereignty of the Eternal Lord&#44; the invisible King of 
the people He had chosen. According to this view&#44; 
idolatry was naturally an ofience against the state&#44; its 
prohibition therefore no persecution&#44; but merely the 

<pb n="26"/>

26 THE REDEMPTION OF ISRAEL. 

enforcement of the acknowledgment of the Lord as 
the sole Sovereign of Palestnic. At a future clay we 
may enlarge on this subject&#44; and place it in a stronger 
liu&#58;ht before vou &#58; but at present we must hasten to 
resume the subject from which we started. We may 
therefore maintain that&#44; since no persecution is au&#8211; 
thorized or even allowed by the Scriptures&#44; and since 
the single prohibition of the possession of the idols 
was afterwards much neglected&#44; greatly to the de&#8211; 
struction of the peace and prosperity of Israel&#44; it is 
not consonant with truth to charge the Israelites with 
the crime and folly of originating religious persecu&#8211; 
tion. 

&#34;We have thus seen that ignorance and tyranny had 
been made the lot of mankind&#44; disfiguring&#44; by their 
rapid strides&#44; the creation of the Omnipotent. The 
warnings&#44; as was said in the early part of this ad&#8211; 
dress&#44; of the flood and the confusion of tongues had 
failed to instruct the world that the Ruler of the uni&#8211; 
verse would not allow transgressions against his will 
to remain unpunished. It will therefore appear that 
retribution&#44; nay the extermination of the entire mass 
of men&#44; had failed of effecting the divine economy&#44; 
the spread of a universal religion over the face of the 
earth. Two thousand years had rolled over the world 
since its first creation&#44; and yet but few would acknowl&#8211; 
edge the great Creator who had displayed unto them 
so often his mighty power. Should He again deso&#8211; 
late all&#63; sweep off again the mass of mankind&#63; If 
again they multiplied&#44; the same consequence would 
have ensued&#44; unless He&#44; to whom all is possible&#44; had 
vouchsafed to remove the tendency to evil inherent 
in human nature. But this suited not the plans of 

<pb n="27"/>

THE REDEMPTION OF ISRAEL. 27 

the Lord&#44; who&#44; in forming man&#44; had imparted to him 
the knowledge&#44; and consequent choice&#44; of good and 
evil. He preferred schooling the world to his service&#44; 
and to educate his creatures&#44; so to say&#44; to a knowledge 
of himself&#44; and to a correct perception of the truth. 
The time&#44; indeed&#44; may seem long to us&#44; whose years 
are but brief&#44; and whose thoughts are bounded by 
corporeal limits&#59; but to Ilim&#44; whose years are unend&#8211; 
ing&#44; and whose wisdom is infinite&#44; what are three 
thousand years&#63; is his existence aifected by this to us 
Ions&#58; duration&#63; Certainly not&#59; and we therefore need 
not&#44; should not&#44; wonder that the world has been left 
gradually to come unto the service of the Lord&#44; and 
that not any sudden change has been eflected since 
the mission of Abraham. Your attention has before 
this been directed to the kind of education the world 
has undergone since the days of this great apostle&#59; 
how God took him from his erring father&#39;s home&#44; 
and&#44; leading him through lands untrodden by him 
before his old age&#44; caused him to teach the truth 
wherever he&#44; the Patriarch&#44; pitched his tent. You 
also know that after his death Isaac became the 
prophet and blessed one of the Lord&#44; transmitting 
the truth to Jacob&#44; whom his God surnanied Israel. 
You know also how the aged father went down to 
Egypt to behold his long&#8211;lost Joseph before his death. 
It was then in Egypt that the promise made to Abra&#8211; 
ham&#44; &#34;that his seed should be made as numerous as 
the stars of heaven and the sand upon the shore of 
the sea&#34; began to see its fulfilment. &#34;The children 
of Israel increased and multiplied&#44; and the land was 
full of them&#44;&#34; so that the suspicions of the ruler of 
the land were aroused against them&#44; and he devised a 

<pb n="28"/>

28 THE llEDEMPTION OF ISRAEL. 

plan for lessening the number of the strange people&#44; 
whom his predecessor had invited to sojourn in the 
land of Goshen. A long servitude was this cunningly 
devised plan&#44; and to it was at last added the slaughter 
of all the Hebrew male children. Imagine to your&#8211; 
selves a state more hopeless than this&#44; if you can. 
To all the sickening horrors of perpetual thraldom&#44; 
where the great leveller alone of all humanity can 
bring release from the galling bonds&#44; was superadded 
the approaching annihilation of their entire race. 
The whip of the task&#8211;master&#44; the cry of the driver&#44; 
banished all thoughts of self&#8211;liberation from a people 
scattered all over the land of Egypt as slaves&#44; com&#8211; 
pelled to build the towns of the king&#39;s treasure&#44; to 
dig his immense canals&#44; to construct his stupendous 
aqueducts&#44; and to till the soil of their individual op&#8211; 
pressors. We have no account of any attempted ris&#8211; 
ing of the Hebrews&#59; but where was the hope of its 
being of any use&#63; Without arms&#44; or at all events 
unused to wield them&#59; without concert in their ranks &#59; 
fatigued too much by day to brood in secret conclave 
over daring deeds by night&#59; watched by troops that 
had overrun every land then known to civilization&#59; 
perhaps mistrusting each other for fear of having by 
one evil report reaching the Pharaoh&#39;s ears their 
daily toil&#44; as actually did happen&#44; doubled in intens&#8211; 
ity&#58; they were compelled to submit to a state of deg&#8211; 
radation&#44; which perhiipslong custom had made habit&#8211; 
ual to them. The father toiled whilst his strength 
endured&#59; the son and grandson had to submit to a 
like yoke&#59; and there was accordingly engendered 
such a feeling of inferiority to their free neighbours&#44; 
as almost to place these in their own estimation in a

scale of excellence far above tliemselves. Similar 
circumstances produce similar eliects in our own day&#44; 
nay&#44; in this very land&#44; and this will give us some in&#8211; 
sight into the fact that deep&#8211;rooted hatred never 
prompted a violent outbreak during a period of full 
two hundred years. &#8212; The tradition that their forefa&#8211; 
thers had been the favourites of the All&#8211;Father was 
still current among them &#59; they were yet distinguished 
in comeliness of feature and colour of the skin from 
the people among whom they lived&#59; for even in ser&#8211; 
vitude was Israel the peculiar people&#44; and thus wisely 
had the Lord preserved this nation&#44; which He had 
chosen for his service. &#8212; Living in luxury and at ease&#44; 
a residence of so long a period might perhaps have 
caused them to amalgamate by degrees with the 
Egyptians&#59; incipient repugnance would in progress 
of time have been dissipated&#44; and consequently no 
distinct nation of Jacob&#39;s sons could ever have trav&#8211; 
elled out of the land of their sojournment. Observe 
now the divine economy. Immediately after the 
death of the sons of Jacob&#44; by which the first link 
with our earliest fathers was broken&#44; and when&#44; con&#8211; 
sequently&#44; the receivers of revelation had ceased to 
be on earth&#44; the Lord suffered that the aversion of 
the EgyDtians to the shepherd&#8211;people should take its 
natural course&#44; that is to say&#44; to produce a reciprocal 
aversion&#44; strongest of course on the part of those who 
beheld the beasts they worshipped made the food or 
otherwise the merchandise of the strangers&#44; whom 
they regarded first as sojourners and guests&#44; and af&#8211; 
terwards doubtless as intruders. It was also the will 
of God&#44; that the children of Abraham should be ser&#8211; 
vants during a part of the period appointed for their

being strangers in a land not theirs. But the sinful 
cruelty afterwards exercised we may reasonably be&#8211; 
lieve was in contravention to the purposes of God&#44; as 
much as the sinning of any one of us&#59; the bondage&#44; 
in short&#44; was decreed&#44; to preserve our people till they 
had grown up into a mighty nation&#44; for imposing 
which the Egyptians would hardly have been account&#8211; 
able &#59; but the cruel oppression of the individuals&#44; the 
slaughter of children&#44; the haughty contempt for the 
God of Israel&#44; these were sins which merited and re&#8211; 
ceived condign visitation. &#8212; But whilst we had been 
thus preserved&#44; we had&#44; as already remarked&#44; lost 
much&#44; if not all&#44; of our national self&#8211;respect&#44; we were 
Israelites by compulsion more than any thing else&#44; as 
the Egyptians were too proud to receive us among 
them as equals&#59; and although it is undoubted that 
many yet retained a due knowledge of and reverence 
for the simple worship of the patriarchs&#44; still it is 
equally certain that the masses were tainted&#44; if not 
wholly corrupted&#44; by the system of idolatry among 
which they had so long dwelt. Yet during this period 
of suffering it was made manifest to them that there 
is a Power wdio forsakes not the humble&#44; and who 
permits not the proud and lofty to bear down with too 
heavy a hand upon the lowly&#59; for every device to di&#8211; 
minish them had signally failed. Consequently all 
hope of better days had not perished within them&#59; and 
when therefore the time of trial was ended&#44; there were 
many&#44; perhaps all&#44; wdio at once readily believed the 
joyful message with which the prophet was charged&#44; 

Witness the pride of Spanish nobles&#44; that they are from an un&#8211; 
mixed family&#44; and not in anywise connected with persons outwardly 
Christians&#44; descended from Jewish or Moorish families.

to announce unto them a speedy deliverance through 
the fresh display of the might of the Eternal One. 
Soon thereupon were wrought signs and wonders&#44; 
deeds unheard of before and never since seen again 
were of daily occurrence&#44; in order to prove &#34; that 
there is none like the Everlasting Lord our God.&#34; 
The oppressor was made to feel that the Creator&#39;s 
power was yet capable of doing all as at the creation&#44; 
and the Israelites were convincd that his promises 
never fail of a fultilment&#44; if even the period of suf&#8211; 
fering should have been continued beyond the time 
they imagined as the termination of patient endur&#8211; 
ance. All the world&#44; too&#44; was instructed that no one 
can withstand the outstretched arm that wields the 
everlasting sceptre&#59; and the contemner of the heav&#8211; 
enly mandate succumbed and said&#44; &#34; The Lord is 
righteous&#44; and I and my people are wicked&#59;&#34; and 
again&#44; &#34; Rise and go out from the midst of my peo&#8211; 
ple&#44; you as well as the children of Israel&#59; but bless 
me too.&#34; Joyfully the ransomed went forth&#44; and 
thus was completed the redemption which had been 
promised&#59; and thus had the people been educated 
who&#44; whilst receiving the law&#44; were to become there&#8211; 
by the blessing of all the families of the earth&#44; like 
the anxiously lookcd&#8211;for torch&#44; suddenly sent down 
to the hopeless miner&#44; who vainly gropes his way to 
the lost entrance&#44; amidst the appalling gloom which 
reigns in the bowels of the earth. Ay&#44; this glorious 
light was kindled on yon Sinai&#44; and this light of the 
unchanging God is to be the guide unto the heavenly 
portals of eternal bliss to the now benighted sons of 
men. And thus speaks the prophet &#40;Malachi iii. 6&#41; &#58; 

<pb n="32"/>

32 THE REDEMPTION OF ISRAEL&#58; 

&#34; For I am the Lord&#44; I change not&#44; therefore ye sons of Jacob 
are not consumed.&#34; 

In truth&#44; the same Providence which watched over 
us when in slavery under Pharaoh&#39;s tyranny has ever 
since guarded us&#59; and whenever troubles have en&#8211; 
compassed us we were always saved by the same 
mighty Hand that piled up the waters of the Red 
Sea&#59; and whenever enemies strove to make us for&#8211; 
get the law&#44; the same potent Voice that spoke at 
Sinai preserved its influence over our mind&#44; so that 
the holy legacy has not been forgotten. If therefore 
our children and the sons of the stranger ask&#44; &#34; What 
is this service unto you &#63;&#34; we may answer&#44; &#34; It is be&#8211; 
cause the Supreme Ruler fulfilled his word&#44; and took 
unto himself a people from the midst of another&#44; to 
difluse through their agency&#44; life&#44; libertj&#39;&#44; salvation 
and truth to the utmost ends of the earth on which 
our lot is cast.&#34; 

Father of Israel &#33; preserve us farther in thy grace&#44; 
and look not unto our follies and transgressions&#44; 
though they be many&#44; but have regard unto the 
covenant Thou sworest unto our fathers&#44; that Thou 
wouldst be God to them&#44; and unto their children for 
ever. Amen.

water&#44; when on Sinai the law was given &#59; and at the 
footstool of Divine Majesty was prostrate an adoring 
people&#44; lay worshipping an awe&#8211;struck nation&#44; when 
their King came to cause them to hear his words. It 
was then that every one of the redeemed multitude

beheld the evident tokens of divine revelation&#44; and 
heard the words of truth proceeding immediately 
from the mouth of the Holy One&#59; and they felt that 
it was indeed the Almighty&#44; their Creator and Re&#8211; 
deemer&#44; that had delivered them from the tyrant&#39;s 
power&#44; wlio now spoke to them&#44; and that to be his 
chosen people meant that they should purchase his 
especial fixvour and vigilance by obedience to the 
laws that were promulgated to them on that day. &#8212; 
In my last address&#44; your attention was called to the 
extraordinary circumstance&#44; &#40;at least remarkable to 
Israelites&#44; though so very common among gentiles&#44;&#41; 
that the heathen priesthood had a knowledge and re&#8211; 
ligion&#44; differing widely from that of the community. 
The former had access to the temples&#44; festivals&#44; and 
the so&#8211;called mysteries of their innumerable divini&#8211; 
ties&#59; whilst the latter were excluded from all partici&#8211; 
pation&#44; except distantly&#44; in these matters. A religious 
address is not well calculated to enter deeply into an 
investigation of this subject&#59; but a mere cursory read&#8211; 
ing&#44; even of the history of the Romans&#44; Greeks&#44; Baby&#8211; 
lonians&#44; and Egyptians&#44; will satisfy any one of the cor&#8211; 
rectness of this assertion. I will merely extract from 
a late popular work&#44; by no means favourable to reve&#8211; 
lation&#44; a short description of the Eleusinian mysteries&#44; 
to illustrate more clearly&#8211; what I mean when using 
this word in reference to heathen rites. &#34;These&#34; 
&#40;that is&#44; the lesser mysteries&#41; &#34; were afterwards pre&#8211; 
paratory to the greater &#59; for which tlie candidate was 
obliged to fit himself by religious ceremonies&#44; sym&#8211; 
bolical rites&#44; and various acts of devotion&#44; the design 
of which was to withdraw his attention&#44; at least for 
a time&#44; from business and pleasure&#44; to keep him pure&#44; 

<pb n="35"/>

chaste&#44; and unpolluted&#44; and to excite his curiosity in 
relation to the expected revelations. The period of 
purification continued a year&#59; and no one could he 
admitted to the mysteries without purification&#44; on 
pain of death. The ceremony of admission was per&#8211; 
formed by night &#58; the candidates&#44; crowned with myr&#8211; 
tle&#44; were ohliged to wash their hands at the sacred 
threshold with holy water&#59; public proclamation was 
also made&#44; that the mysteries should be approached 
only with pure hands and pure hearts. Pure Greek 
only was to be spoken. The celebration of these 
mysteries commenced on the fifteenth day of the 
month Boedromion&#44; and continued nine days. It 
consisted principally of representations of the history 
of Ceres and Proserpine&#44; the tortures of Tartarus&#44; 
and the joys of Elysium&#44; which were exhibited in 
the most striking manner. The chief design was&#44; 
by sensible means&#44; to spread among the people a con&#8211; 
viction of the immortality of the soul&#44; and of a future 
state of rewards and punishments. The initiated 
were under the peculiar protection of the gods&#44; and 
they alone were certain of the joys of immortality. 
Very different from these lesser were the greater mj&#39;s&#8211; 
teries&#44; which contained the secret doctrines that were 
the chief object of the institution&#44; and were commu&#8211; 
nicated only to a few &#40;the Epoptse&#41;&#44; in the recesses of 
the sanctuary. Secrecy was enjoined under the most 
dreadful penalties. Divine vengeance and death were 
the punishment of those who disclosed them. These 
doctrines probably aimed at the explanation of the 
popular superstition and mythology&#44; and the inter&#8211; 
pretation of their true meaning. The mysteries in&#8211; 
culcated the doctrine of one God&#44; and the dignity

and destiny of the soul of man&#58; tliey instructed the 
people in the knowledge of nature and of the uni&#8211; 
verse&#44; and pointed out the traces of the Deity in the 
beauty and majesty&#44; the splendour and regularity of 
the visible world.&#34; 

It will be observed that whatever of superstition 
and pagan worship belonged to these mysteries in 
this account are matters of history&#59; but the explana&#8211; 
tions attempted&#44; so as to attribute to them a higher 
object&#44; such as unfolding the knowledge of one God 
and of the immortality of the soul&#44; are evidently 
matters of conjecture only&#44; and may be assumed to 
have been an illustration attempted in modern times. 
But it is not my present purpose to enter into a com&#8211; 
parative value of paganism farther than to exhibit 
the nature of prophecy as it existed among the an&#8211; 
cient Israelites&#44; the predecessors of us the modern 
Jews. &#8212; You will have observed how carefully the 
higher knowledge was hedged round and kept con&#8211; 
cealed from the multitude of the heathen &#59; so that&#44; 
if even the elect had imparted to them a pure moral&#8211; 
ity&#44; the people had to be satisfied with gross super&#8211; 
stition&#59; no ray of purer light w&#92;as to them vouchsafed. 
It need scarcely bo mentioned that all this necessarily 
precluded the revelation to them of the existence of 
the Holy One&#44; admitting even that the few elect knew 
of his sole existence&#59; for the multitude worshipped 
in those days of darkness invented absurdities Avhich 
were a personiiication of all the follies and vices of 
man in a barbarous state&#44; and war and petty intrigue 
were boldly represented as the pastime of the Roman 
and other deities. Whatever of prophecy was at&#8211; 
tempted&#44; in order to fasten yet tighter the chain of

servitude upon the necks of suflering millions&#44; was 
delivered by cunning madmen in double&#8211;meaning 
words&#44; interpreted by priests to answer their own&#44; 
often sinister views. To attempt reaching the truth 
was held a crime deservins&#58; of the most condign vis&#8211; 
itation&#44; and wo to him who dared to lift the veil of 
the Egyptian idol &#59; death&#44; or tortures even worse than 
death&#44; would surely have fallen to his lot. While 
thus every communication of the Everlasting God 
was scrupulously denied&#44; or kept a profound mystery 
to the mass of mankind &#58; it pleased the Lord&#44; whom 
Abraham and his descendants had worshipped&#44; to 
announce through his chosen messenger that it was 
his intention tQ descend in visible gloiy&#44; yet with no 
visible form&#44; upon Mount Sinai&#44; there to make known 
to all the people those laws which He had ordained 
for their government. It was&#44; therefore&#44; that the ex&#8211; 
traordinary display of the Divine Majesty took place 
which was mentioned in the commencement of this 
address&#44; and from the midst of the fire&#44; out of the 
bosom of the thunder that shook the lotty Iloreb to 
its base&#44; were proclaimed doctrines true as is the 
Creator himself&#59; laws unchangeable as is his wisdom&#59; 
and a code imperishable as is the spirit which He has 
created. Ay&#44; &#34;And all the people saw&#59;&#34; there is the 
great point on which we must reflect &#58; it was not 
in some unheard of spot of a distant district&#44; not in 
a corner of a remote&#44; unknown&#44; lonely desert&#44; not 
before a few ignorant&#44; perhaps interested men&#59; but 
all the people stood by&#44; in a position where every 
thing that was transacted was done in the sight and 
hearing of assembled millions&#44; where the grandeur&#44; 
sublimity&#44; and transcendent awfulness precluded the

idea of human illusion and deception. Still the Is&#8211; 
raelites stood by nnscathed&#44; nnharnied&#44; alive&#44; listen&#8211; 
ing to the word of the Omnipotent. Truth was in&#8211; 
culcated to the millions&#44; superstition was overthrown&#44; 
not to the chosen few in the recesses of a time&#8211;worn 
temple&#44; but to a now&#8211;born people of sixty myriads 
besides women and children&#44; and the strangers that 
were in the midst of them&#44; on the green oasis&#44; near 
the fertilizing rivulet&#44; on the wide extent of the plains 
around the well&#8211;known Horeb. All tliis took place 
contrary to whatever had been thought of or at all 
events promulgated unto that day&#39; within the memory 
of men&#59; and therefore did the Israelites say to Moses 
&#40;Dent. V. 21&#41; &#58; &#34; Behold the Lord our God hath shown 
us his glory and his greatness&#44; and his voice we have 
heard from the midst of the tire &#59; this day we have 
seen that God can speak with man&#44; who yet may 
live.&#34; Conviction was therefore wrought&#44; a convic&#8211; 
tion which&#44; despite of sinning&#44; despite of apostacies 
innumerable&#44; despite of persecutions bitter and ago&#8211; 
nizing&#44; despite of allurements tempting and destruc&#8211; 
tive&#44; yet survives&#44; that to God alone belongs the gov&#8211; 
ernment&#44; that He is the sole Creator&#44; that He alone is 
Saviour&#44; and that His commands are true&#44; permanent 
and unchangeable. 

The Unity then speaking was the same Saviour who 
had by a display of his creative power redeemed the 
children of his early adorer from galling servitude &#59; 
and this Saviour who had redeemed their bodies from 
bondage was also the same Father who promised to 
redeem their souls from earthly pollution by their 
obeying his will. For what says the text of Exodus 
&#40;xix. 5&#44; 6&#41;&#63; &#34;And now if you will hearken carefully

unto my voice&#44; and observe my covenant&#44; you shall 
be to me a treasure above all nations&#44; for all the earth 
is mine. And you shall be unto me a kingdom of 
priests and a holy nation.&#34; These words can bear 
but one interpretation&#44; and this is evidently that God 
announced Himself as One&#44; the Creator and Gov&#8211; 
ernor&#59; and farthermore&#44; that holiness&#44; or the saving 
of the spirit from pollution and its consequent con&#8211; 
demnation and unhappiness&#44; could be acquired by a 
hearkening to his voice&#44; and an observance of his 
covenant&#59; no other terms&#44; no other foith&#44; no other 
conditions were stipulated&#58; where then&#44; why then&#44; 
should we look for conditions which the words of the 
holy message do not require &#63; &#8212; But what is meant by 
covenant &#63; The covenant of circumcision had already 
been given to Abraham&#44; in consequence of which ob&#8211; 
servance the Israelites had been chosen as the people 
to whom God would fulfil the promise made to that 
Patriarch&#44; that He would be their God &#59; and now to 
add to this covenant already existing&#44; they were told 
the duties which they should observe in order to lay 
a claim to the appellation of&#34; God&#39;s people&#59;&#34; that is 
to say&#44; they should observe the covenant of the Ten 
Commandments&#44; or those laws which the Almighty 
had ordained as the everlasting statutes which should 
govern the people whom lie had chosen. The only 
article of belief&#44; from which our creed so called is 
merely a fair deduction&#44; which was asked of them&#44; is 
a belief in the existence of God&#44; the Omnipotent One&#44; 
the Everlasting One who had delivered them from 
Egyptian thraldom&#59; but in no way was it taught that 
they should repose their hope of salvation upon tiie 
intervention of any assistant&#44; human or divine. For

human beings must like themselves be fallible&#44; mortal&#44; 
sinful&#59; and no divinity can exist cither dependent or 
independent of Ilini who is our God. Thus instructed&#44; 
thus convinced&#44; the people felt that the living God&#44; 
let me repeat&#44; the living God their Tiedcemer&#44; had 
indeed spoken to them from the midst of the tire&#44; and 
that naught but his terrors had been seen from the 
midst of the darkness. And yet they had been per&#8211; 
mitted to survive &#33; How were the delusions of pagan&#8211; 
ism thus swept away&#33; how were the bonds of priest&#8211; 
craft rent in twain by the Giver of light and reason I 
The object of the descent of Sinai was thus attained&#44; 
and thus was accomplished the intention of the Lord 
to reveal to an adoring people the basis of his ever&#8211; 
lasting covenant. 

Although the people had in this manner been taught 
that a man might hear the livii&#59;ig God speak&#44; and yet 
be preserved alive &#58; still weak human nature dreaded 
to approach again the great fire in which the glory 
shoue resplendent. They were fully alive to the 
truth and faithfulness of Moses&#44; through whose in&#8211; 
strumentality they had been redeemed&#44; upheld&#44; and&#44; 
so to say&#44; been brought to adore at the footstool of 
the great Father. They therefore continued&#58; &#34;And 
now why shall we die &#63; for this great fire may con&#8211; 
sume us&#59; if we continue to hear any more the voice 
of the Lord our God&#44; we must die. For Avhere is 
there any flesh who hath heard the voice of the living 
God speaking out of the midst of the fire&#44; as we have 
done&#44; and hath remained alive &#63; Do thou now ap&#8211; 
proach&#44; and hear all that the Lord our God may say&#59; 
and thou shalt speak unto us all that the Lord our 
God may speak unto thee&#44; and we will hear and do

it.&#34; &#40;Deut. V. 22&#8211;24.&#41; This request was not iinpleas&#8211; 
ing to God &#59; He&#44; on the contrary&#44; deputed Moses on 
his part likewise to be the messenger to the people&#44; 
and thus was the son of Amram made&#44; as it were&#44; 
the representative of the people before the Lord of 
all&#44; and unto them he was the mediator for the com&#8211; 
munication of the commandments with which he was 
charged &#59; and in this manner was the law of Moses 
handed down to us&#44; a law which is the sequel and 
more particular definition of the basis of the covenant&#44; 
the Ten Commandments&#44; which all Israel heard on 
Horeb. 

When Moses now was told that his end was ap&#8211; 
proaching&#44; that soon his body too must be yielded to 
the earth&#44; that though in his full vigour at the age of 
sixscore years&#44; with his eyesight undimmed&#44; and his 
intellect unclouded&#44; his hours were numbered&#44; and 
that notwithstanding his earnest entreaty to see the 
goodly land which was on the west side of Jordan&#44; 
he should die in the land of Moab&#44; because he had 
not sanctified the Lord at the waters of Meribah&#58; he 
prayed to God to appoint a man over the congrega&#8211; 
tion who should supply the place which he under 
heavenly favour had filled for the long period of forty 
years. His wish was gratified&#44; and Joshua his disci&#8211; 
ple was endowed with the divine spirit&#44; and guided 
by holy wisdom he led on the Israelites to the con&#8211; 
quest and the possession of the land of Canaan. But 
in addition to this the people were promised&#44; that 
with the death of this one even the gift of prophecy 
should not be withdrawn&#59; but that from time to time 
teachers should be sent who should speak in the name

of the livino&#59; God and the everlasting King&#58;. This we 
are taught in Deut. xviii. 15&#58; 

&#34; A prophet from the midst of thee&#44; from thy brethren&#44; like unto 
mj&#39;self&#44; tlie Lord thy God will raise up unto thee &#58; unto him you 
shall hearken.&#34; 

Let ns understand well what was promised&#44; for 
upon this depends much&#44; and it is necessary that we 
should be able to show that this announcement refers 
to no other character than a human prophet. In the 
first place&#44; a prophet is a term inappropriate to the 
Divinity&#59; for who can depute Ilim &#63; in whose name 
is He to speak&#63; who is the superior to whom He shall 
be accountable&#63; Farther&#44; &#34;from the midst of thee&#34; 
refers evidently to a human being&#44; one like the peo&#8211; 
ple&#44; fallible&#44; mortal&#44; sinful &#59; more upright&#44; more de&#8211; 
voted to the service of God&#44; if you will&#44; but never&#8211; 
theless&#44; fallible&#44; mortal&#44; sinful. Again&#44; &#34; from thy 
brethren&#59;&#34; who can be the personage meant&#44; if it be 
not one from the seed of Jacob &#63; who else can be the 
.brother of Israelites&#44; if it be not one of the same or&#8211; 
igin &#63; But the next characteristic&#44; &#34; like unto my&#8211; 
self&#44;&#34; must banish every doubt&#44; if any can rest on the 
mind of correctly informed and correctly thinking 
Israelites. Who was Moses&#63; was he an integral part 
of the Divinity &#63; was he a person removed from the 
rest of the world&#44; in an exemption from sorrow&#44; from 
error&#44; from death &#63; did he act of his own accord&#44; in 
working the mighty deeds of which he was the in&#8211; 
strument&#44; from an inherent power&#44; or as the delegate

for the time being from the One Supreme &#63; Kext&#44; 
for what object were the miracles performed &#63; to ag&#8211; 
grandize one&#63; to depress another&#63; no&#59; only to con&#8211; 
firm again and again the minds of the wavering mul&#8211; 
titade in the observance of the promulgated covenant&#44; 
in short&#44; to establish on a permanent basis the service 
of the Lord of all. We may maintain farther that 
not to atone&#44; not to save&#44; not to reconcile a sinning 
world to an oifended God was Moses deputed &#59; only 
to be the mouth&#8211;piece of the Lord&#44; and to distribute&#44; 
to use a simile from outward nature&#44; as a canal en&#8211; 
riches&#44; from the supply of the parent river&#44; with re&#8211; 
freshing waters the thirsty soil&#44; the benefits with 
which he was charged to the people to whom he had 
been sent&#44; and ultimately through these to all the 
sons of Adam. This then was Moses&#44; this his ofiice&#44; 
this his prophecy. When&#44; therefore&#44; God promises 
one like him&#44; a prophet descended from Jacob&#44; He 
means not a saviour&#44; descended maternally from Is&#8211; 
rael&#44; whilst his father was more than man&#44; sent to 
atone for the transgressions of Adam&#39;s sinful race &#59; 
not one through whose blood shed for mankind they 
could alone be rendered worthy of paradise&#59; but a 
messenger of tidings of good or evil&#44; one deputed 
like Moses was to speak in the name of his Sender&#44; 
to demonstrate the truth of the unalterable law&#44; the 
unchangeable decree of our Lord&#44; &#8212; in short&#44; to in&#8211; 
struct&#44; to lead&#44; to admonish&#44; to labour in the holy 
calling with the zeal becoming one so eminently fa&#8211; 
voured&#44; in order that his brethren might turn&#44; repent&#44; 
and regain the favour of their oftended God&#44; and to 
obtain again through obedience the happiness which 
their sins have taken from them. And continues the

text&#58; &#34;All as tlioii didst ask from the Lord thy God 
in Horeb on the day of the assembly&#44; saying&#44; I do 
not wish any more to hear the voice of the Lord my 
God&#44; nor see again this great fire&#44; lest I die.&#34; &#40;Dent&#44; 
xviii. 16.&#41; The people had asked that Moses should 
communicate to them the decrees which might be 
revealed to him&#44; to instruct them in the way they 
ought to go&#59; but they did not ask&#44; they did not think 
it requisite to ask that he should become their surety 
to obtain for them salvation &#59; inasmuch as the very 
law itself was the instrument to effect this&#59; because 
this was the sole object of its promulgation&#44; as we 
are told in the words of Scripture&#58; &#34; That it may be 
well with them and their children for ever.&#34; &#40;Ibid. 
v. 26.&#41; Indeed&#44; for what other purpose was or could 
the great display have been&#44; were it not to bestow a 
law&#44; the observance of which should confer life and 
peace &#63; When therefore God promises a prophet on 
their petition and that of the father of prophets&#44; He 
evidently could mean no other than had been asked 
for&#44; a deputy to certify them of the will of the Lord&#44; 
not a son of god&#44; to use a phrase foreign to revealed 
religion&#44; to atone with his death&#44; inflicted by the peo&#8211; 
ple of his mother&#44; for the sin of Adam&#44; and to render 
man asain fitted for admission to a share of everlast&#8211; 
ing happiness. 

I have deemed it necessary to be more diffuse than 
customary upon the explanation of a text in the Pen&#8211; 
tateuch and to illustrate it at greater length&#44; even by 
an introduction of extraneous matter&#44; than is perhaps 
agreeable to you or than I have been in the habit of 
doing hitherto. But observe&#44; brethren&#44; our religion 
is always assailed&#44; by infidels on the one side&#44; who 

<pb n="45"/>

would gladly destroy all belief&#44; and by zealots of an&#8211; 
other people on the other&#44; who wish&#44; and endeavour 
to impose a creed upon us&#44; foreign to our faith&#44; and 
not consonant with the Bible. I therefore consider 
it my duty to show you as briefly as one lecture can 
do it&#44; the infinite inferiority of the pagan knowledge 
of God&#44; even assuming for it the highest tone which 
unbelievers ascribe to it &#59; and then to prove on the 
other hand&#44; that the opinions of the people among 
whom we live are inconsistent with&#44; and therefore re&#8211; 
pugnant to the wisdom and goodness of God. Not 
however to controvert the belief of others or to make 
converts to our mode of thinking has this been at&#8211; 
tempted&#44; but only to afford those who may hear me&#44; 
and whose hearts I trust the Lord will fill with wisdom 
to understand and to instruct&#44; some arguments which 
on their face appear unanswerable&#44; to contend with 
those who may wish to invite them to rebel against 
the Most High. Yes&#44; rebellion is the word to denote 
the act which we are called upon to accomplish &#59; we 
are told to forsake the Rock of ages for a deity which 
our forefathers knew not&#44; of whom the Bible does 
not speak&#44; to whom the law and commandments do 
not even allude. Shall we yield&#44; brethren&#63; are we 
to be wheedled out of our hope&#63; shall it be said&#44; that 
we have surrendered up in times of repose&#44; and liber&#8211; 
ty&#44; and enlightenment&#44; and equality&#44; that to which we 
clung&#44; ay&#44; clung unto death&#44; when persecution&#44; when 
hatred&#44; when oppression&#44; when chains&#44; the rack&#44; the 
scaffold were the certain doom of the people held 
forsaken of God and afflicted &#63; Or are perhaps the

the fire and sword&#63; By no means&#59; the law of God 
as delivered to Moses&#44; free from human admixture&#44; 
stands as erect at this moment as on the day of the 
assembly at Iloreb. You&#44; Israelites &#33; arc its guard&#8211; 
ians&#59; you&#44; sons of Jacob&#33; are its sentinels&#59; it is your 
inheritance&#59; guard it&#44; watch it&#44; save it&#59; hold fast to 
its blessings&#44; and never throw idly by the gift which 
to bestow God&#44; your Creator&#44; came down in his glory 
followed by multitudes of his holy angels&#44; to bless 
therewith the jieople whom He had chosen. Holy 
are its statutes&#44; purify yourselves through them &#59; life&#8211; 
bringing are its precepts&#44; live then by obeying them&#59; 
instructive are its ordinances&#44; become wise therefore 
by studying them. Yes&#44; live in and for your taith&#44; 
and everlasting life will be your reward&#59; be erect in 
your captivity&#44; unflinching as the defenders of Heav&#8211; 
en&#39;s best gift&#44; and the glory of Israel which is dimmed 
will shine again&#59; and when misfortunes befall you 
then&#44; as misfortunes are the trials which God wields 
ibr the purification of nations as well as individuals&#44; 
Israelites will truly appear the people of God&#44; who in 
Palestine and in foreign lands remained firm and true 
and devoted servants of Him who chose them because 
of the love He bore to their fathers. Thus also will 
be fulfilled the prophecy which was spoken by Isaiah 
&#40;lii. 10&#41; &#58; &#34; The Lord hath bared his holy arm before 
the eyes of all nations&#44; and all the ends of the earth 
shall see the salvation of our God.&#34; 

Father above &#33; give us thy blessing&#44; grant us the light 
of thy countenance&#44; and give us peace and security in 
the lands of our captivity. Raise up also again unto 
us prophets who shall teach us in thy name&#44; and pour

donest the sinners and forgivest transgressors against

Wash them clean from their iniquity&#44; cleanse them

to div6 into the recesses of futurity &#58; liow often would 
we hesitate before we acted&#44; and would leave many 
an intended action undone. For we frequently do 
that which in its consequences is pernicious not only 
to others whom we sought to injure&#44; but also to our&#8211; 
selves&#44; when we only thought of being benefitted by 
our conduct. Appearances are so well calculated to 
mislead&#44; excitement is so apt to blind&#44; interest will so 
generally deceive&#44; that guided by these only our whole 
life would be nothing but one continued scene of rash&#8211; 
ness&#44; its consequent misconduct&#44; and subsequent re&#8211; 
gret and sorrow. &#8212; The wisest of men like the most 
foolish is liable to the same infirmities&#44; and if he is 
left to judge for himself&#44; he must&#44; acting in ignorance 
of the consequences&#44; very often&#44; nay&#44; almost uniformly&#44; 
choose the evil&#44; deceived by the semblance it may 
bear to the useful. For great&#44; wonderful&#44; and far&#8211; 
reaching as is the mind with which God has blessed 
his creature&#44; man&#44; still it is but the field in which the 
seed may be sown &#59; and good or evil fruits will be the 
product according to the cultivation which the fruit&#8211; 
ful soil has received. But how does the agriculturist 
cultivate his soil&#63; He first eudeavours to enrich it 
by mixing it with substances which bountiful nature 
every where supplies to restore its lost vigour&#59; he 
next ploughs in order that the loose furrows may be 
ready to receive the seed which he intrusts to the 
bosom of the earth&#59; and when the germ first appears 
he watches with care lest the chill frost and the gust 
of the storm nip the tender shoot&#59; and even when it 
is growing up to maturity he must carefully remove 
all weeds and noxious undergrowth which&#44; when suf&#8211; 
fered to multiply&#44; would injure the development of

the plant by their hurtful presence. All this done&#44; 
he must leave the ripening to the careful vigilance of 
Him above&#44; who sendeth down the rain to refresh the 
earth and the warming rays of the sun to bring all to 
maturity. Even so&#44; brethren&#44; should we strive to cul&#8211; 
tivate our minds&#44; and endeavour to reap a rich and 
blissful harvest from the field of mental cultivation 
surrendered to our charge. You must understand 
that in our natural state the mind is liable to receive 
impressions of every kind&#44; and it may often be said 
that a wicked man might have been a good one&#44; had 
he only trained himself or been trained by his pa&#8211; 
rents and guardians in a different manner. It evi&#8211; 
dently becomes therefore the duty of the superin&#8211; 
tendents of children to go before them with a holy 
example&#44; in order that they may early behold the 
beautiful effects of piety and uprightness&#59; children 
will soon see how happy this renders their parents&#44; 
and naturally enough they will seek to reach the 
same state by emulating those they love&#44; and from 
wdiose kind care so many of their enjoyments spring&#44; 
and who generously provide for all their wants. 
When the child is thus prepared&#44; how easy is it to 
awaken in him feelings of gratitude &#40;so to say plough 
in him the field for religious seed&#41; towards the great 
Giver&#44; who has enabled his bodily parents to be kind 
and beneficent to him &#33; Yes&#44; he should be told how 
it is that all the beauty of nature is beautiful through 
Him alone&#59; how lie makes the bright sun to shine&#59; 
how lie clothes with verdure&#44; how He adorns with 
flowers&#44; how He blesses with fruit the field&#44; the 
meadow&#44; and the garden. That every bird that sings 
amidst the new&#8211;clad branches of spring&#44; sings by Him

inspired&#59; how the cattle that low&#44; the sheep that skip 
in exuberant joy on the widespread meadows&#44; are 
there by His ordaining. Tell him when the dew&#8211;drop 
glows in the eiirly rays of the rising snn&#44; that this re&#8211; 
splendent diamond and this matchless brightness are 
scattered from the hollow of his hand in one night 
over all the earth &#59; yes&#44; till his heart with the vastness 
of the Creator&#39;s might&#59; tell him that the bright lumi&#8211; 
nary which lights us by day never halts in his course&#44; 
that scarce have his beams sunk to rest apparently 
behind the lofty mountain&#44; when from the summit 
you see them illumining the land beyond. Tell bira 
&#8212; but what needs it for an humble mortal to recount 
the greatness and awful working of his Maker&#63; can 
we reach the extent of his power&#63; Still it is by 
words only that the sensations of our hearts can be 
conveyed to others&#59; and when therefore the great&#8211; 
ness of the Everlasting One is the theme&#44; how does 
the heart swell&#44; how do words come involuntarily&#44; 
how does our soul heave forth the psalm&#44; and strive 
feebly to confess its inability to chant his praise&#33; Let 
therefore the child see that you are indeed alive to 
the wonders of the Creator&#39;s deeds&#44; and you will 
awaken in his 3&#39;outhful heart an ardent wish to love 
this great and bountiful Benefactor&#44; and he will al&#8211; 
most involuntarily ask&#44; how he should act to deserve 
the love of the great Adored. When the child has 
reached this point&#44; that he requests either to be taught&#44; 
or appears ready to receive higher instruction&#44; you 
should inform him that the Creator is too elevated&#44; 
too supremely blessed to require the services of his 
creatures for his own benefit&#59; but that whatever they 
do will be for their own advantage soleW&#44; if their

conduct meets with His approbation. Be explicit in 
this&#44; let the child be at once impressed that his piety 
will be pleasing but not serviceable to God &#59; that the 
performance of duty was therefore given&#44; that every 
human being might at once know those actions which 
must be beneficial in their consequences&#44; be this 
sooner or later&#44; to him and others&#44; and learn to avoid 
those that are hurtful&#44; if even their first appearance 
be harmless or at times agreeable. Thus also says 
the prophet &#40;Ezekiel xx. 11&#44; 12&#41; &#58; &#34;And I gave them 
my statutes&#44; and my judgments I made known to 
them&#44; which a man is to do and live through them&#59; 
and also my Sabbaths I gave unto them&#44; that they 
might be a sign between me and between them &#59; that 
they might know that I am the Lord who sanctifieth 
them.&#34; Let him understand well what is meant by 
&#39; which a man is to do and live through them&#59;&#34; that 
it is nothing else but that a strict obedience to the 
divine behests will give us inward comfort&#44; outward 
peace&#44; and permanent satisfaction &#59; and that&#44; if we 
have to conquer our inclination in order to render 
obedience to the judgments of God&#59; if we have to 
undergo hardships&#59; if we have to be subject to loss&#59; 
if we should be exposed to the contempt and hatred 
of the ungodly in order to follow the way pointed out 
by the statutes of the Lord&#44; we should not falter in 
our duty&#44; but remain firm and unshaken &#59; resist the 
inclination&#44; for to follow it would be sinful and death&#8211; 
bringing&#59; and think lightly of hardships&#44; for they 
may be readily overcome by perseveiance. Show 
him that the loss of worldly things should not be es&#8211; 
timated in comparison with the bliss we obtain by 
obedience&#59; the contempt of mortals should not be

valued when compared with the favour of our great 
Father&#59; and the hatred of the ungodly may well be 
held in light esteem&#44; when we reflect that we are pro&#8211; 
tected by One who is powerful above those who lord 
it over their fellows. Tell him farther&#44; that this 
course of steady obedience will bring us life&#44; and 
that the opposite will cause death and sufferings. 

Unfold to the child also the beautiful institution 
of the Sabbath &#59; how the Lord himself made all that 
exists in specific time&#44; and that&#44; when all was finished 
as He had willed it&#44; He sanctified that period and 
called it the day of rest&#59; that He could have made 
all in a moment of time&#44; but preferred creating&#44; as 
the Bible teaches&#44; each part of the organization on a 
diflx3rent day&#44; but that He absolutely finished&#44; and 
consequently added no more&#44; when He had organized 
nature as we now see it around us. &#8212; He had implanted 
in every thing a power of continuing itself&#44; if not dis&#8211; 
turbed by greater causes &#59; to the earth he gave power 
to change its masses by heat and various other inher&#8211; 
ent agents&#59; to the water&#44; to rise up in vapour into the 
atmosphere and thence to descend and make fruitful 
the soil&#59; to plants He gave growth&#44; and to animals 
the power of motion&#44; and to man alone the iaculty 
of speech. &#8212; All this organization finished&#44; He viewed 
it and found it very good&#44; and He then abstained 
from adding any more agents and impulses&#59; and from 
that time until now every thing has been proceeding 
and progressing as He had commanded&#59; and that 
period too&#44; when all had been finished&#44; called the 
seventh day of creation. He blessed and declared holy&#44; 
and gave it to his noblest Avork&#44; man&#44; as a day of ab&#8211; 
stinence from labour&#44; and a day of recreation from

toil&#44; and devoted to the worship of the Founder of 
the universe &#59; for thereon the sun rose upon the new&#8211; 
made earth&#44; when quietly the fishes played in the 
sparkling brook&#44; unterrified by the angler&#39;s rod&#59; 
whilst securely the birds carolled forth their Sabbath 
hymn in undisturbed joy&#59; whilst peacefully grazed 
the cattle upon the fresh grass of the wide&#8211;extended 
pasture&#44; and whilst man&#44; innocent as he had sprung 
from God&#39;s creative hand&#44; chanted forth his ecstatic 
praise to the Author of his life. Angels might stand 
by and be thankful at so great a display of goodness&#59; 
for there were rest&#44; and harmony&#44; and good&#8211;will upon 
the whole sphere which had just been thrown out as 
one of the many stars that glow in the expanse of 
the infinite space&#44; the handiwork of the exalted Olie. 
Therefore was the Sabbath given as an institution to 
prove that God the Creator sanctifieth his children 
by making known unto them a portion of his great&#8211; 
ness&#44; and imparting to them a knowledge of those 
things which will make them worthy to be called his 
servants&#44; and men hallowed by his worship. 

You yourselves&#44; parents and guardians &#33; worship 
the Lord in your hearts&#59; if you practise in your own 
persons the duties you recommend &#59; if you honour 
the Sabbath from violating it&#59; if&#44; in short&#44; your chil&#8211; 
dren see in your conduct the reflection of the divine 
law&#44; whose precepts you impress on them &#58; is it not 
then highly probable that they wnll listen with cheer&#8211; 
ful attention to your instruction&#44; and give ready obe&#8211; 
dience to the laws you impart &#63; Most assuredly&#44; and 
children thus educated&#44; thus led by precept and ex&#8211; 
ample&#44; will be full of the spirit of religion&#44; ready to 
execute from a pure love to Heaven his all&#8211;wise de&#8211;

crees. For in youthful piety there is not mixed up a 
desire for display&#44; no love of renown&#44; no fondness for 
worldly gains&#44; wliicli may in a greater or less degree 
sway the actions of maturer years&#59; hut the infantile 
prayer spoken hy intelligent lips that know no guile 
is indeed a worthy sacrifice to the One who is purest 
of the pure. And well have our wise men included 
in our prayers the petition&#44; &#34; Grant our request for 
the sake of children under tuition&#59;&#34; for with them is 
found sincere piety coupled Avith understanding&#44; and 
from them alone can grow up undeviating defenders 
of the holy law &#59; since they early practise the religion 
which has been early taught them&#44; and conviction of 
its truth implanted in the pure soil of uncontaminated 
rea&#39;son will remain unshaken in after years&#44; when the 
turmoil of life&#44; and passion&#44; and sorrow&#44; and disap&#8211; 
pointment sour perhaps the disposition&#44; and almost 
lead man to despair of better days. What&#44; I ask you&#44; 
will then uphold the stranger in the stranger&#39;s land &#63; 
who alone battles against adverse interests &#63; mis&#8211; 
trusted by his opponents and feebly supported by his 
friends &#63; whence can he derive his consolation &#63; Can 
it be from evanescent triumphs&#44; from foes vanquished&#44; 
from dijficulties overcome&#44; from a character left un&#8211; 
tarnished though assailed by the ungodly &#63; Surely 
to the humble in mind such things can afford but 
small satisfaction&#59; he values little the malice of men&#44; 
and lightly he esteems the tcmporarj&#39; triumph ob&#8211; 
tained &#59; and were indeed such his only support&#44; how 
soon would he sink into melancholy and listlessness. 
And suppose his enemies were to triumph &#40;for often 
we find that virtue for a time succumbs to malice and 
cunning&#41;&#44; what then is to cheer him but the holy

hope which has been early implanted in him&#44; by an 
honoured mother&#44; by a beloved father&#44; by a revered 
teacher&#63; And often the shadow of an early&#8211;lost 
mother will rise np to console the son in the hour of 
sorrow and bid him to direct his eye to his God who 
never sleeps &#58; the admonition of the father&#44; who was 
perchance early taken&#44; will recur to the aching mem&#8211; 
ory and counsel him to steadfastness in the righteous 
path &#59; and the instruction of the teacher&#44; who has 
sunk in the grave ripe of years and fnll of honours&#44; 
will be ever present to incite him to persevere in the 
service of the Most High&#44; uninfluenced by fear of the 
world&#44; unswayed by the hope of their favour. &#8212; If you&#44; 
brethren&#44; are of those who have been blessed with such 
guides as I have mentioned&#44; you will be able to esti&#8211; 
mate the valuable gifts that have descended unto you 
through them &#59; and you will surely not hesitate to en&#8211; 
deavour that 3&#39;our own children shall receive a simi&#8211; 
lar blessing through your means. &#8212; In this manner 
you accomplish the high obligation which the Lord 
demands of you with regard to the precious souls 
which His wisdom has intrusted to your care&#44; for in 
this light you should regard your children&#44; as a trust 
which you should strive to deliver back pure and un&#8211; 
sullied into the hands of Ilira who bestowed them on 
you. &#8212; It is accordingly farther demanded of you to 
watch the growth of the weeds among the useful pro&#8211; 
ducts&#44; and to eradicate the former that the latter may 
grow more freely and luxuriantly. In other words&#44; 
you should keep a watchful eye to discover with every 
day of advance in life the faults and foibles Avhich 
your children may display&#59; do not compare your well&#8211; 
informed and well&#8211;behaved ones with those of others

who are rude and bad&#44; and thereby extenuate the little 
evils which jou may daily witness in your own fami&#8211; 
lies. Do not act in this suicidal manner &#59; but check 
every evil propensity as soon as it presents itself&#59; 
punish gently every departure from right and pro&#8211; 
priety&#44; and admonish with earnestness&#44; and repeat 
your holy lessons constantly in mild and persuasive 
language&#44; till you reach that happy moment when the 
conduct and thoughts of your offspring and charges 
flow in the same devotional channel with your own. 

If all this has been religiously&#44; scrupulously&#39;&#44; and 
honestly done&#44; till they have reached manhood&#59; if 
virtue has always been encouraged and vice ever 
checked &#59; if the fear of God has been made a house&#8211; 
hold duty&#44; and his adoration the daUy conduct of the 
seniors&#59; in short&#44; if the parental fireside has been the 
school of religion &#58; then alone have you fulfilled your 
trust&#44; and then alone can you with truth assert that 
you have discharged your duty to your children&#44; and 
then alone can you aver that you are not answerable 
for their misconduct. If then they disgrace them&#8211; 
selves by deeds unworthy of the example and in&#8211; 
struction they have received&#44; you will not be punish&#8211; 
ed&#44; nor will the displeasure of God fall upon you &#59; as 
says the prophet &#40;Ezekiel xviii. 20&#41; &#58; &#34; The soul that 
sinneth alone shall die &#59; the son shall not suffer for 
the iniquity of the father&#44; nor shall the father suffer 
for the iniquity of the son&#59; the righteousness of the 
righteous shall be upon him&#44; and the wickedness of 
the wicked shall be upon him.&#34; It will appear from 
this that&#44; when the sou acts contrary to the virtuous 
example of the father&#44; the latter shall not be respon&#8211;

be claimod&#44; when the comraandment of &#34; And thou 
Shalt teach tlicm diligently unto thy children&#34; has 
been carcfnlly fultillcd. But wo to that parent who 
values his children more than the glory of God &#33; who 
reproves them not when they sin &#59; for then lie is ac&#8211; 
countable for all their transgressions&#44; since he could 
have guided them aright&#44; and yet neglected his trust. 
For thus we read in 1 Samuel iii. 11&#8211;14&#58; &#34;And the 
Lord said to Samuel&#44; Behold I will do a thing in 
Israel&#44; so that both the ears of every one that heareth 
it shall tingle. On that day I will fulfil unto Eli all 
that I have spoken concerning his house&#44; when I be&#8211; 
gin&#44; and also make an end. I now tell him&#44; that I 
will judge his house for ever&#44; because of the iniquity 
of his knowing that his sons behaved vilely and he 
chid them not.&#34; We are told in the same book how 
lamentable was the end of Eli&#39;s sons and of himself&#44; 
and how just was the retribution inflicted upon the 
priests who dishonoured by their misconduct the 
temple and sacrifices of the Lord&#44; and of the father 
who from love to them winked at their misdeeds. 

We have thus exhibited both the duty and manner 
of mental culture&#59; and minds trained in this manner 
can alone be said to be in a proper state for adopting 
a good and useful conduct. For a person who has 
been early taught to look towards the law of God for 
advice and countenance&#59; who has been firmly im&#8211; 
pressed that all its commandments are wise and of 
beneficial tendency&#59; who firmly believes that the 
Maker does all for our ultimate good&#44; even in those 
things which we mourn over at times as afflictions 
and sorrows&#58; such a one&#44; I say&#44; can seldom be in&#8211; 
duced to do aught hurtful to himself or his neigh&#8211;

bours&#44; that is to say&#44; he will practise virtue&#44; and thus 
do nothing which can in reality be termed injurious. 
For if he deprives himself of superfluities in order 
to assist those who need his services&#44; what docs he 
lose thereby&#63; If he voluntarily submits to suspend 
his labour on the days sacred to the Lord&#44; will he at 
the period of his death miss the unnecessary gain 
which he lost by his abstinence&#44; even admitting that 
his wealth should have been diminished in conse&#8211; 
quence of his piety &#63; Say&#44; what can he suffer if he 
watches by the friend who languishes on the bed of 
sickness&#44; compared to the blissful satisfaction lie there&#8211; 
by earns of having assisted one who so much needed 
it&#44; even omitting altogether its bearing as a religious 
duty &#63; In short&#44; we cannot mention a single depriva&#8211; 
tion&#44; Avhich the strict obedience to the law requires&#44; 
which can in any degree of fairness be termed hurt&#8211; 
ful&#44; and the more we reflect&#44; the more sincerely must 
we join with the words of the prophet adduced al&#8211; 
ready&#44; &#34;And my judgments I made known to them&#44; 
which a man is to do and live through them&#59;&#34; for all 
the losses and sufl&#58;&#34;erings such obedience brinirs are 
only temporary&#44; and the mind&#44; though at first un&#8211; 
willing&#44; will soon rejoice over the sacrifice made&#44; 
over inclinations conquered&#44; and over evil intentions 
checked in consonance with the will of God&#44; and feel 
a happiness which no worldly gain can bestow&#44; that 
it has been l&#41;lessed to avoid a long course of regret&#44; 
and to earn the satisfaction of a conscience unsullied 
by crime&#44; and to be confident that the Creator will 
look with favour upon the deeds of the work of his 
hands.

of no weight in the regulation of our condnct &#33; if we 
trust to the deceptions which the outward world im&#8211; 
poses upon the senses &#59; if we prefer riches to happi&#8211; 
ness&#59; inclinations before the law of God&#44; the creature 
before the Creator. For then the road which leads 
onward to destruction is opened to us &#59; every act will 
then withdraw us to a greater distance from the fa&#8211; 
vour of the Lord &#59; every step will bring us nearer to 
the brink of ruin &#59; since the accumulation of wealth 
by means not permitted by the law&#44; the acquisition 
of fame by trampling upon the rights of others&#44; can&#8211; 
not shield the heart from the consciousness of beins&#8211; 
unworthy of such possessions&#44; nor can we rest free 
from the apprehension of divine vengeance&#44; if even 
human power can be laughed to scorn. Or say that 
empires too should bend beneath a sceptre unjustly 
swayed&#44; that kings should bow before a usurper&#39;s 
throne&#44; that nations glorying once in their freedom 
should willingly bear the chains of fortune&#39;s favourite 
&#8212; will this bring ease to the soul torn with remorse 
for friendship betrayed&#44; for the innocent slaughtered&#44; 
for the widowed mother rendered childless&#44; and for 
altars of God overthrown &#63; Yes &#33; dignify crime as 
you will&#44; let its career be ever so splendid&#58; still you 
may confidently assert&#44; that had the criminal but 
known the end of his doings&#44; had he been permitted 
to look into the dark recess of futurity&#44; surely his 
misdeeds would never have been done. &#34; There is 
no peace&#44; saith my God&#44; to the wicked&#44;&#34; speaks Isaiah

and all will experience to the end of time&#44; that virtue 
outraged will be avenged&#44; and that the broken cove&#8211; 
nant of the Lord will cry out for visitation against 
the doers of evil. 

Still&#44; even the sinner&#44; though he has wilfully re&#8211; 
jected the light so graciously given&#44; will not be for 
ever rejected&#44; if he but turn again and seek the Lord&#44; 
&#8212; by which is meant that the sinner&#44; who in his mis&#8211; 
conduct may be said to have distanced himself from 
his God&#44; may alter his course&#44; and by following the 
divine ordinances regain the favour which is now de&#8211; 
nied him. He should rekindle in himself the knowl&#8211; 
edge of better things wdiich was impressed on him 
in his happier years of iafancy and youth &#59; he should 
strictly investigate whether his own deeds can bear a 
comparison with that standard &#59; and if he find that 
they cannot&#44; as find he must&#44; when he feels that he 
must stand abashed if at that moment he were called 
on to account before the omniscient Judge &#58; let him 
pour out his heart in prayer before Ilim who searches 
the heart&#44; and humiliate himself in abhorrence of the 
wickedness he has done. Then indeed may he look 
for forgiveness&#44; if he sincerely resolves and firmly 
perseveres to lay aside the faults&#44; and vices&#44; and sins 
which rob him of his peace&#44; which but too much evi&#8211; 
dence that he is not entire with God. Only let him 
not despair of mercy&#59; let him not think that the re&#8211; 
ligion of Israel revealed in the law of Moses has no 
consolation for the transgressor&#59; for reasoning like 
this may sink the straying one yet farther into the 
whirlpool of sin&#44; and extinguish perhaps the last spark 
of religion&#44; and induce him to become an apostate to 
his faith and the belief of his fathers&#44; and to seek for

repose in systems which promise salvation through 
mediators&#44; or in other words an atonement through 
acts that are not his own. On the contrary we thus 
read in Deuteronomy &#40;iv. 29&#41;&#58; 

&#34; And you will seek from there the Lord thy God&#44; and thou 
shalt find him&#44; when thou wilt seek him with all thy heart and 
with nil thy soul.&#34; 

In this verse is plainly taught that a seeking of the 
Lord will obtain his forgiveness&#44; provided the pen&#8211; 
itence be with all the heart and with all the soul&#44; that 
is to say&#44; with entire sincerity on the part of the sin&#8211; 
ner. It is true that Moses in addressing Israel evi&#8211; 
dently speaks of the entire people&#59; but we are fairly 
permitted to apply the same promises of pardon to 
individuals likewise. Many passages of the prophets 
teach us emphatically the use and efficacy of repent&#8211; 
ance&#59; but we must at present pass them over&#44; and 
merely select a few striking passages from the Psalms 
of David which clearly teach the doctrine we have 
advanced. Psalm xxxvi. 5&#44; he says&#58; &#34; Therefore did 
I confess my sins to Thee&#44; and would not hide my 
iniquity &#59; I said&#44; I will confess my transgressions unto 
the Lord&#44; and Thou didst forgive the iniquity of my 
sin.&#34; Psalm li&#44; 6&#58; &#34;To Thee&#44; only Thee&#44; have I 
sinned&#44; and have done the evil in Thy sight.&#34; And 
V. 19&#44; he continues in positive assurance of pardon &#58; 
&#34;The sacritice of God is a broken spirit&#59; a heart 
broken and contrite&#44; O God &#33; Thou wilt not despise.&#34;

&#8212; This is the doctrine wliieh is preached throughout 
the Bible&#44; and in every instance we are told that sin&#8211; 
cerity will not find the gates of mercy closed to its 
earnest prayer. Indeed it is the whole scope of re&#8211; 
ligion to awaken such a state of mind in our people&#59; 
all the ceremonies were ordained to arrest the atten&#8211; 
tion and to lead hack the unthinking&#44; and even the 
unlearned who have not been blessed with an educa&#8211; 
tion as we have attempted to describe&#44; unto the ser&#8211; 
vice of the Most High&#44; Hence&#44; the institution of the 
festivals&#44; and especially of the Day of Atonement&#44; 
and the days of penitence. Every year the cornet is 
blown in Israel&#39;s dwellings&#44; to proclaim that the ever&#8211; 
lasting King yet reigueth&#44; and to call back to his 
fold those who have gone astray on devious paths. 
Loudly arises the prayer&#44; sincerely ascends the hymn&#44; 
and in every congregation is heard with one accord&#44; 
&#34; The Lord He is God&#44; the Lord He is God &#33;&#34; Willing 
and unwilling&#44; pious and sinner&#44; all join in the loud 
acclaim&#44; and all attest that the love of God is not yet 
extinct in Jacob&#39;s descendants in the lands of their 
captivity. But brethren&#44; let the worship not be merely 
for the day&#44; for the moment of enthusiasm&#59; on the 
contrary&#44; let its workings operate for every hour of 
your future life &#59; be animated by a renewed desire to 
be good and faithful servants&#44; and resolve to show 
your sincerity by a vigilant and honest exercise of all 
the precepts which were ordained for your happiness&#59; 
then indeed will you be accepted&#44; your sins will be 
forgiven&#44; and you will not die&#44; O house of Israel&#33; 

Forgiver of sins &#33; gracious Father &#33; send us the 
comforter&#44; even thy spirit&#44; and pour out over us the 
spirit of truth and righteousness&#44; and open for us the

Father of Israel&#33; unto Thee alone we offer adora&#8211; 
tion&#44; Thou who hast been from the beginning&#44; and 
who wilt endure to everlasting. Thine are power 
and wisdom&#59; thine are might and understanding&#59; 
and from Thee alone are the powerful strong&#44; and 
the wise endowed with wisdom. Give us therefore 
the protection of thy power that we may be safe and 
sheltered from the attacks and snares of the ungodly&#59; 
and grant us the light of thy wisdom so that we may 
be wise in knowing Thee&#44; and bow with meek sub&#8211; 
mission to thy just decrees&#44; and the upright judgments 
which Thou sendest over thy world. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

In examining the law of God we find different words 
used to denote the commandments which it contains. 
So one class is called commandments&#44; another judo&#8211;&#8211; 
ments&#44; another laws&#44; and another again has the name 

<pb n="64"/>

64 OBEDIENCE TO THE LAW. 

of statutes. These various terms are not unadvisedly 
used&#44; nor without proper limitations. So we would 
understand under commandments those enactments 
which are apparent to our reason&#44; including the 
greater part of those technically called the moral 
laws&#59; necessity and convenience both demand our 
acting accordingly&#44; and liuman reason&#44; when once 
certified of their being the will of God&#44; will&#44; if not 
too much misguided by passion&#44; gladly acquiesce in 
gaining the favour of the Lord by following their be&#8211; 
hests strictly&#44; seeing that in obeying God in these 
things we at the same time promote our own interest. 
The same&#44; with but slight variation&#44; may be said of 
the judgments so called&#44; or the judicial law of Israel&#44; 
as practised when the nation of united Hebrews was 
governed by the equitable code of the divine rule. 
To our own reason a close inspection will make mani&#8211; 
fest that they are based upon the golden rule&#44; &#34;Do 
to others as you would have them act towards you&#59; &#34; 
and but few indeed among these enactments can be 
found&#44; the reasonableness of which is not apparent&#44; 
if the circumstances of the times and of our people 
are taken into consideration&#44; and which are not even 
to this day the best adapted for the happy government 
of a free and enlightened people. For the more the 
enactments of the Mosaic code are studied and car&#8211; 
ried out in practice&#44; the more it will be discovered&#44; 
that no legislation&#44; properly so called&#44; of equal sound&#8211; 
ness and practical usefulness&#44; was ever devised by any 
one man&#44; or any set of men&#44; be they the wisest that 
ever lived. 

In the execution therefore of the commandments and 
judgments no particular exercise of faith can be dis&#8211;

OBEDIENCE TO THE LAW. 65 

played&#44; by which I mean that in performing either 
the moral or judicial laws we do not manifest a sub&#8211; 
mission of our own will to the wisdom of God. But 
still&#44; whilst practising what our reason demands&#44; we 
are nevertheless doing our duty&#44; we obey the dictates 
of our supreme Legislator who is anxious to promote 
by his benign law the welfare of his creatures. lie 
is desirous to establish peace and good&#8211;will on earth&#59; 
and whatever therefore we do with a holy purpose 
will be acceptable to Him as a manifestation of piety. 
But religion has a higher scope than a mere utilita&#8211; 
rian principle&#59; it is the schooling of the heart&#44; it is the 
training of the spirit&#44; it is the government of our de&#8211; 
sires which it purposes &#59; in short&#44; it does teach us to 
yield ourselves entirely to God&#39;s guidance &#59; and it is 
a saving faith and a confiding trust that are necessary 
in order to constitute ourselves servants of the Most 
High. What then is a saving faith &#63; is it a belief in 
doctrines not understood &#63; in imperfectly conveyed 
dogmas&#63; No&#44; it is a conviction that whatever God 
asks of us is correct and true&#59; that his laws are neces&#8211; 
sary to our salvation and happiness&#44; both here and 
hereafter. It was therefore to test our faith&#44; to plant 
the love of God stronger in our hearts&#44; that He gave 
us statutes and laws which human reason would not 
have arrived at by the most profound study&#44; that we 
might be tested whether we &#34;loved the Lord our God 
with all our heart and with all our soul.&#34; It is ac&#8211; 
cordingly not to be denied&#44; that many of the statutes 
of the Mosaic code are not founded upon human rea&#8211; 
son&#59; nor will we for a moment maintain that it is ex&#8211; 
pedient even to attempt measuring the infinite Wis&#8211; 
dom by the feeble light vouchsafed to mortals such 

6&#42;

as we are&#59; but wc maintain that in tins consists the 
chief excellence of the Mosaic rnle over any other 
which is the invention of men and based solely npon 
human reason and human will. 

Let us examine&#58; the statutes and laws are those or&#8211; 
dinances wliich God instituted as the distinficnishino&#8211; 
mark of his people above all other nations of the 
earth. He ordained that we should erect a sanctuary&#44; 
holy unto his service&#44; where He would come and dwell 
among us. The regulations belonging thereto&#44; the 
order of the service&#44; the institution of the sacrilices&#44; 
the consecration of the priests and Levites&#44; were all 
such as He chose to appoint them. When therefore 
He says&#44; that such service would be a delight&#44; that 
such sacrifices would be a sweet savour&#44; where is the 
human reason that can gainsay it &#63; Say we&#44; that we 
would not so have organized the holy service&#59; admit&#44; 
that more pictorial&#44; more statuary efiect&#44; more elegant&#44; 
ravishing music salute the eye and ear in other wor&#8211; 
ships&#59; that in other temples sweeter incense pleases 
the senses &#58; yet all this and even greater refinements 
superadded would convince the believer yet more 
that a holy purpose was the foundation of the simi&#41;le 
unostentatious service of the Lord. He preferred to 
dwell in a tabernacle&#44; elegantly indeed constructed &#8212; 
beautifully wrought by those in whose hearts God had 
placed wisdom &#59; nevertheless it was a movable&#44; so to 
say itinerant sanctuary&#44; and during a space of four 
hundred and eighty years our people had no other 
resting&#8211;place for the glory of the Sovereign of the 
universe&#44; whose visible ti&#39;&#39;e dwelt in the midst of 
them. Would human wisdom have ordained this&#63; 
can any one be hardy enough to assert&#44; that a cun&#8211;

ning deceiver would not have dreaded to trust his 
sy&#39;stem to so contemptible a depository in a country 
replete with refinement and elegance&#63; By no means&#44; 
especially when Egypt teemed with temples of yet 
enduring splendour&#44; when there at every step the 
modern traveller is arrested by magnificence and 
wonderful art which no one can even dare to attempt 
to imitate&#44; much less to rival. &#34;We therefore main&#8211; 
tain that in obeying the laws of which we have been 
speaking&#44; we submit ourselves to the wisdom and 
guidance of God&#44; who chose to maintain his creed 
and faith among our nation in a state of simplicity 
almost inconceivable&#44; while heathenism fell&#44; though 
supported by unequalled splendour. 

Again with regard to statutes. &#8212; &#34;Remember the 
Sabbath to keep it holy&#34; is the command of the law&#59; 
here we behold God as the Author of our life&#44; as the 
Rewarder of our toil&#44; demanding a cessation of labour 
on the day which He claims as devoted to his service. 
He tells us&#44; blessing&#44; yes&#44; temporary blessing&#44; the in&#8211; 
crease of riches and worldly goods&#44; also&#44; shall be the 
consequence of our labouring less days than the gen&#8211; 
tiles do. Would human reason have invented this&#63; 
or did it ever do so in any other system &#63; True&#44; the 
Romans had the feast of the Saturnalia&#44; when the 
slaves were free from labour&#44; and when a universal 
merry&#8211;making prevailed throughout the land &#59; but it 
was not the quiet Sabbath of the Jews&#44; not the silent 
hilarity&#44; the finding pleasure in the Lord prevailing 
among Israel. With us labour ceased before the sun 
sunk to rest on the sixth day of every week. See on 
the western horizon the light of day is fast winging 
its course to the depth of ocean&#39;s wastes &#59; from the

pastures the lowing herds wend their way to the wel&#8211; 
come inclosnre &#59; the sheep bleating and joyous seek 
the fold &#59; and the ploughman arrests the busy plough&#59; 
the harvester&#39;s sickle is swung no more&#44; and stops 
the hand of the active vinedresser. All is at rest&#44; 
whilst yet the feathered songsters have not ceased 
their song&#44; whilst yet they have not sought their 
downy nest. Say&#44; what causes this repose&#63; is the 
labourer&#39;s hand palsied&#63; falters the husbandman in 
his toil &#63; is it sloth that pervades the land &#63; jSTo &#33; hear 
the psalm arising&#44; from towns&#44; from villages&#44; from 
hamlets&#44; from the desert plain&#59; all join in melodious 
hymns&#44; all hearts are overflowing&#44; every tongue utters 
praise&#44; shouting forth &#34;a psalm and song for the Sab&#8211; 
bath day.&#34; The household too is newly arranged&#44; 
the table decked with the bright linen&#44; the work of 
the industrious housewife&#44; who awaits the return of 
the father&#44; husband&#44; and son&#59; and over the festive 
board the Lord&#39;s name is blessed who has given rest 
to his people Israel. At length all is gloom&#59; the sun 
has set&#44; the night has spread its dusky mantle over 
wearied creation &#59; but no sound of revelry&#44; no clang&#8211; 
ing of instruments&#44; no noisy shouts disturb the peace&#8211; 
ful ear&#59; for the bondman&#44; though now free&#44; rejoices 
too with the household in quiet retirement over the 
r&#39;tnrn of the weekly rest. &#8212; The day has now dawned &#59; 
and over hill&#8211; and valley slowly the light is stealing&#59; 
but it meets not the ox at the plough&#44; nor the ass toil&#8211;

them&#44; and thev learn each to value himself&#44; not in 
being richer&#44; wiser&#44; or more powerful than liis neigh&#8211; 
bour&#44; but in obtaining a greater share of the fear and 
knowledge of the Lord&#44; the Father and King of hia 
people. So it is in all the land &#59; quiet&#44; and order&#44; and 
peace&#44; and tranquillity reign all around&#59; but even in 
the temple the service is simpler than in other days 
of the week &#59; not to&#8211;day do you behold crowds of 
people bringing their burnt&#8211;oiferings&#44; their peace&#44; 
their sin&#44; and their trespass&#8211;oifering to the house of 
God &#59; for only the daily sacriiices and the additional 
ofFerins&#58; of two lambs for the Sabbath are led to the 
altar&#44; and over the sanctuary as over all tlie land 
hangs the shield of the holy rest &#8212; a rest in which no 
heathens rejoice&#44; a Sabbath in which the uncircum&#8211; 
cised have no share&#44; nor portion. Is this an institution 
of human invention V or did priestly cunning devise 
the day of rest &#63; Ko &#33; it is the wisdom of God that 
has ordained it&#44; it is the all&#8211;wise Ruler who wishes so 
to refresh by bodily rest and mental culture his ser&#8211; 
vants&#44; to fit them to pursue their allotted toil&#44; re&#8211; 
signed to his will&#44; content with their poi&#39;tion. For 
see&#44; in our Sabbath the prince and slave&#44; the philoso&#8211; 
pher and labourer&#44; the man and the beast of burden 
all alike participate &#59; and when we resort to the house 
of God to serve Him&#44; the pomp&#44; the pride&#44; the retinue 
of vehicles and of anxious servants must be left be&#8211; 
hind&#59; for the horse is not to carry the owner&#44; nor is 
the servant to do servile work for his master on that 
day. The king&#44; therefore&#44; should he come hither&#44; 
must walk amid the crowd of worshippers who ap&#8211; 
pear before the great King&#44; and in nothing can he 
claim any distinction above them except he be a truer

ing his Master&#44; the Lord of all. 

If now we are compelled to admit that human rea&#8211; 
son would not have set apart one entire day for rest 
and a total abstinence from labour &#58; it will neverthe&#8211; 
less be apparent&#44; that this institution is eminently cal&#8211; 
culated to promote a strong reliance upon the Lord &#59; 
inasmuch as it will present itself as a day of lei&#8211; 
sure to the whole community &#59; and their welflire as 
a mass will be greatly increased if they&#44; with one 
accord&#44; pretermitting their daily toil&#44; resort to the 
houses of worship to acknowledge that they are all 
servants&#44; receivers of bcnelits&#44; children in their great 
Father&#39;s world&#44; scholars in their Teacher&#39;s school&#59; 
if they devote this day to rest&#44; because the Lord of 
their labour bids them rest &#59; if they listen to instruc&#8211; 
tion because their Master teaches&#44; and rely on Ilim 
for blessing during their cessation of labour&#44; because 
the Father who never deceives&#44; promises them eter&#8211; 
nal delight&#44; if they restrain their foot on the Sabbath 
day&#44; and execute not their desires on the holy day of 
the Lord. &#8212; It need not be told you that the Sabbath 
was ordained to commemorate the creation and our 
going forth out of Egypt&#59; because 3&#39;our reading of 
the Bible has informed you thereof full often&#44; nay&#44; 
the Ten Commandments&#44; familiar to you from early 
childhood&#44; lay it down as a reason&#44; &#34; And remember 
that thou hast been a servant in Egypt.&#34; Besides 
this&#44; the subject has before this been presented to 
your consideration. I intend to&#8211;day merely to call 
your attention to the fact&#44; that the laws not founded 
upon human reason were given as trials of faith&#44; as 
a means of binding the people to God. So then.

when we are told that any act is the will of the Lord 
to be done&#44; that another one is to be left undone bj 
order of the same&#44; we should not hesitate in yieldino&#8211; 
obedience&#44; nor falter in our duty&#59; but we should sur&#8211; 
render our own judgment&#44; necessarily circumscribed 
by worldly views and limits&#44; to the all&#8211;searching wis&#8211; 
dom of God&#44; whose eyes range over all nature&#44; in 
the elevated heights&#44; and in the unsearchable depths. 
He is the sole Arbiter of what is reasonable&#44; of what 
is useful&#44; and what is hurt&#8211;bringing. He knows the 
connexion of things&#44; and asks nothing which is really 
injurious to the peace and welfare of the world.&#8212; But&#44; 
besides all this&#44; the creature as such owes somethino&#8211; 
to the Creator&#44; otherwise there could be no divine 
rule on earth. Great acts of charity&#44; of towering 
benevolence&#44; of wide&#8211;spreading philanthropy are not 
within the range of every man&#44; nor always within 
the daily scope of even the wise and highly endowed. 
But acts of devotion&#44; abstaining from things prohibit&#8211; 
ed&#44; the surrendering of the heart to divine instruction&#44; 
the acquiescence in divine mandates&#44; are daily and 
hourly within the power of every&#44; even the humblest 
individual&#59; and the little prayer breathed before we 
enjoy the Creator&#39;s gift&#59; the revenge we suppress be&#8211; 
cause of the Creator&#39;s will &#59; the food we leave un&#8211;

word&#59; the priestly blessing we receive&#44; because it is 
the Creator&#39;s benediction &#58;&#8212; in short&#44; all acts of devo&#8211;

tinual scene of piety displayed &#59; and even the ordi&#8211; 
nary acts of life then become&#44; as also the pursuit of 
our daily avocations&#44; a part and an integral portion 
of the service of the Most High&#44; and the domestic

who dwelleth in the heart of those that are faithful 
and true. &#34; It is the heart the merciful One re&#8211; 
quires&#44;&#34; say our wise men&#44; that is to say&#44; in order to 
be religious we should feel the devotion which we out&#8211; 
wardly profess &#59; our lives should be consistent&#44; and 
by no act&#44; word or thought ever should we dare to 
profane the name of God. But on the contrary we 
should receive all the commandments&#44; being&#44; as they 
actually are&#44; the emanations of the same Wisdom&#44; as 
equally obligatory&#44; nor should we ever presume to 
oftend against either of them&#44; or question their wis&#8211; 
dom or usefulness. For if we do the latter&#44; are we 
not in fact setting up our judgment above the wis&#8211;

not intermarry with them&#44;&#34; and still with profes&#8211; 
sions of religion on their lips&#44; they seek the embrace 
of those not in covenant with the Lord. It is the 
deplorable effect of over&#8211;refinement&#44; of the wisdom 
in our own eyes&#44; that induces us to debase our&#8211; 
selves thus before Him who searches the heart&#59; He 
asks obedience&#44; but we will be obedient if we think 
it reasonable. Wo &#33; wo &#33; that such should be our 
folly &#33; To&#8211;day we know not&#44; in our self&#8211;conceit&#44;

in the willingness to serve alone lies the merit&#44; or as 
we have expressed it&#44; in the yielding of our own de&#8211; 
sires and wisdom to the supreme power and wisdom 
of God. This also we are taught in the Bible &#58;

&#34; And Samuel said&#44; Hath the Lord as groat delight in burnt&#8211;of&#8211; 
fering and sacrifices&#44; as in obej&#39;ing the voice of the Lord &#63; Behold 
to obey is better than sacrifice&#44; to hearken&#44; than the fat of rams&#44; 
yor rebellion is the sin of witchcraft&#44; and stubbornness&#44; iniquity 
and idolatry.&#34; 1 Samuel xv. 22&#44; 23. 

This memorable passage occurs in the history of 
Saiil. When Israel went forth from Egjpt&#44; Amalek 
lay in wait for them on the road and attacked them&#44; 
when they were faint and fatigued. When Saiil had 
now obtained dominion over Israel&#44; he was sent to 
slay man&#44; and woman&#44; and every thing belonging to 
Amalek. The decree was a severe one &#59; hut it was 
the will of God&#44; and as such should have been obeyed. 
But Saiil hesitated &#59; he spared the king&#44; and the best 
of the flock and cattle in order to sacrifice them to 
the Lord. When Samuel arrived at the camp he was 
aware of the delinquency of the king&#59; but in order 
to bring the sin home to him&#44; he engaged him in con&#8211; 
versation&#44; till Saiil avowed his purpose&#44; and also be&#8211; 
cause he averred that the people seemed unwilling to 
execute the command&#44; and that deferring to them he 
had spared the flock to make sacrifices. It was then

the prophet exhibited to him the right way of pleas&#8211; 
ing God&#44; that implicit obedience alone could satisfy 
Him who stands in no need of our services&#44; and to 
whom all the princes of the earth are as nothing and 
their doings as vanity. Willingness is the sacrifice 
He demands &#59; obeying is his incense &#59; but the pre&#8211; 
sumption of judging for ourselves is a want of faith&#44; 
a rebellion against the Most High. &#8212; Here we will 
rest at present&#59; and let us well ponder on the awful 
responsibility we are hourly incurring by the rebel&#8211; 
liousness of our spirit and the stubbornness of our 
heart&#59; and O&#44; let us never &#8212; never &#8212; deserve the de&#8211; 
nunciation&#44; that we are rejected&#44; because we have de&#8211; 
spised the word of the Lord &#59; but on the contrary let 
us give up our heart and soul to an absorbing obe&#8211; 
dience&#44; to a filial devotion&#44; to an entire saving faith&#44; 
in order that by obeying we may receive the appro&#8211; 
bation of the Lord&#44; which is the greatest good&#44; the 
highest blessing&#44; which frail humanity can hope to 
earn. 

Father &#33; teach us obedience&#44; assist us to subdue our 
evil desires to thy will&#44; and lead us through this life 
of trial shielded by thy wisdom&#44; that we may awaken&#44; 
when we have passed the portals of death&#44; surrounded 
by the light and that happiness which Thou wilt give 
unto those that fear Thee &#33; Amen.

NOTE. &#8212; It will be perceived tln&#92;t there is an interval o&#39;&#39; full thir&#8211; 
teen months between this and the next discourse. The reason for 
this long suspending of my functions was as follows&#44; and it Avill in&#8211; 
dicate the then precarious tenure of the office of preacher. The 
evening preceding Sabbath Zachor&#44; when I delivered the above ad&#8211;

76 OBEDIENCE TO THE LAW. 

dress&#44; I happened to be at the l&#41;ouso of the Parnass&#44; but omitted to 
state my intention of speaking on the morrow &#59; because it was al&#8211; 
ways repugnant to me to publish my purpose of giving a lecture&#44; 
not wishing to draw people especially to listen to a discourse&#44; and 
thus make preaching of more consequence than the reading of the 
service&#44; the sermons being&#44; as will appear from an inspection of these 
volumes&#44; merely occasional exercises&#44; and not a stated part of the 
worship&#44; and delivered at longer or shorter intervals&#44; just as occasion 
seemed to demand&#44; and health permitted their preparation. The 
female portion of the Parnass&#39;s family were not at Synagogue on 
Sabbath morning. At the conclusion of the service the just&#8211;named 
functionary asked me&#44; in a somewhat angry tone&#44; why he had not 
been informed of my intention to speak that day&#44; as his family 
would then have had the option of attending. The answer&#44; substan&#8211; 
tially as given above&#44; failed to satisfy him&#44; and he told me at once 
that he should be heard from on the subject. A day or two after&#44; a 
written order from him arrived&#44; directing me to notify him at least 
one day before I intended to speak thereafter&#44; of course making my 
doing so the condition on which I could act as preacher. Deeming 
this procedure a degradation of the ministry&#44; as it would be in ef&#8211; 
fect to render public teaching dependent on the preacher&#39;s subser&#8211; 
viency to the temporal authorities&#44; and not willing to act without 
their consent&#44; I refrained from addressing the people until the presi&#8211; 
dent revoked his order&#44; when I resumed my lectures at once. It 
must be observed that I was engaged as Ilazan only during my en&#8211; 
tire connexion of twenty&#8211;one years&#39; duration with the Mikve Israel 
Synagogue &#59; consequently the president could at any time&#44; if ho 
chose&#44; stop me in my voluntary preachership. The congregation&#44; 
moreover&#44; did not interfere&#44; as far as known to myself&#44; to induce a 
revocation of the obnoxious order&#44; though several members desired 
me indeed to resume speaking &#59; but while the onerous condition 
lasted&#44; my mouth was sealed&#44; and it was only at a later period that&#44; 
by public resolution&#44; authority was conferred on me to speak&#44; and I 
continued then to do so till a few months before my office expired&#44; 
but no by&#8211;law had after all been passed&#44; instituting the office of 
preacher&#44; leaving therefore the whole matter subject to the control 
of the Parnass&#44; even to the extent of interdicting it if it had pleased 
him to do so. There has been a great change with regard to reli&#8211; 
gious discourses since that time&#44; and preachers are now sought and 
well endowed&#44; instead of their almost forcing the public to listen to 
them gratuitously.&#8212; The change is truly gratifying.

DISCOURSE VI. 

THE RESIGNATION OF AARON. 

Shepherd of Israel&#44; hear &#33; God of Jacob&#44; listen to 
our prayer &#33; hearken to our voice from the lands of 
our banishment&#44; from amidst the nations where we 
dwell cast out from our inheritance for the sake of 
the transgressions which we have transgressed in thy 
presence. How long&#44; Lord &#33; shall we sigh amidst 
the gentiles &#63; how long shall the handful of Israel be 
given up to the rule&#44; the oppression&#44; of their enemies&#44; 
who would fain devour them&#44; because they cling to 
thy holy Name&#44; amidst all their wanderings and their 
sorrows &#63; Arise&#44; O God &#33; and display thy holy arm 
before the eyes of all nations&#44; and &#34; sprinkle us with 
the waters of purification&#44;&#34; as Thou hast spoken&#44; 
&#34; that we may be clean&#44; and be cleansed from all our 
filthiness&#44; and from all our idols &#59; and put thy spirit 
within us&#44; in order that we may walk in thy statutes&#44; 
and that Thou alone shalt be our God.&#34; Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

We read in Leviticus x. 3. 

&#34; Then Moses said unto Aaron&#44; This is what the Lord hath spoken&#44; 
saying&#44; In those that come nigh unto me will I be sanctified&#44; and 
before all the people will I be glorified. And Aaron held his peace&#44;&#34; 
i. e.&#44; he remained silent.

78 THE RESIGNATION OF AARON. 

It is pleasant to us&#44; when we see a man&#44; raised high 
above the level of his fellows&#44; guided by the same 
principles which govern the less favoured&#59; it is re&#8211; 
freshing&#44; when we see the sage drinking from the same 
fountain of knowledge which invigorates the minds 
of the humble&#59; but it is more sweet and refreshing 
than both these instances combined&#44; when we see the 
holy influence of religion exerting its power over the 
bereaved heart&#44; when it has consigned back some 
spirit&#44; held dear for the ties of kindred and friend&#8211; 
ship&#44; into the hands of its Giver&#44; and when&#44; without 
repining&#44; it yields iiself a resigned sufferer unto the 
Judge who measures all our steps. It is truly then&#44; 
that the servant of God rises above the level of the 
common mass&#59; for it is he alone who&#44; feeling deeply 
the infliction of God&#44; can yield himself submissively 
to the decree that has gone forth without murmur or 
complaint&#59; because he bears that within which teaches 
him that it is not fittino&#59; for the creature to dive doubt&#8211; 
ingly and complainingly into the ways of his Maker&#44; 
although the chastisement have fallen on himself. &#8212; 
A notable instance of this kind we have furnished to 
us in that part of the history of Aaron which we have 
just quoted. Seven days had elapsed since this noble 
Levite had&#44; together with his four sons&#44; received daily 
the consecration to the service of the Most High from 
the hands of his prophet brother &#59; and on the eighth 
day&#44; which had then arrived&#44; he had been first in&#8211; 
stalled to ofiiciate with the aid of his sons in the Lord&#39;s 
sanctuary. The people were all assembled &#59; from the 
altar arose the smoke of the sacrifices which had been 
instituted as the perpetual oflering of a grateful peo&#8211; 
ple to their benevolent Father &#59; and the chosen min&#8211;

isters were the chief&#44; who had gone hand in hand 
with the renowned prophet before the tyrant of Egypt&#44; 
and spoken the message which had been sent to de&#8211; 
mand the liberation of Israel&#44; and the offspring of his 
Joins whom the Lord had given him. Aaron had 
thus indeed received a great reward&#44; and he&#44; who had 
been the herald of the redemption of his fellow&#8211;Is&#8211; 
raelites&#44; was fit to become the instrument for the ex&#8211; 
piation of their sins at the altar. Besides this&#44; the 
glory of the Lord was displayed before the people &#59; 
for when Aaron with his sons had come down from 
the altar after offering the sin&#44; the burnt and peace&#8211; 
offering&#44; and he and Moses had blessed the people&#44; 
the visible presence of the Most High was made 
manifest before the eyes of the adoring multitude&#44; 
and all then felt that now indeed they were reconciled 
to their Father in heaven&#44; who deigned to dwell in 
the humble tabernacle which their own hands had 
erected. Can you imagine a moment of greater tri&#8211; 
umph than Aaron must have then enjoyed&#63; The 
everlasting priesthood&#44; to endure unto the end of 
time&#44; was his &#59; the representatives that were to possess 
it after his temporal death were before him&#44; around 
him &#59; the people for whom he had risked his life&#44; for 
whom he had toiled&#44; for whom he had almost incurred 
the doing of a great sin&#44; had been purified of their 
transgression&#59; that law which at one time had well&#8211; 
nigh been cast aside for the idol of Egypt was again 
triumphant&#44; and the tables of its holy covenant were 
deposited in the ark under the shadow of the wings 
of the Cherubim&#44; nnder the custody of himself and 
descendants. All around him were joy&#44; exultation&#44; 
and gladness &#59; the people shouted when the fire came

down upon the altar and consumed the sacrifices and 
the fat&#44; and all fell upon their faces and worshipped. 
Here then was the consummation of all his hopes&#44; of 
all his desires&#59; and onward seemed the march of the 
nation to the Holy Land&#44; there to erect unto everlast&#8211; 
ing the sanctuary and the worship of the God of truth. 
Did he dream of sorrow&#63; was his heart awake to the 
terrible bereavement that was impending&#63; &#8212; O no&#44; he 
was secure in his confidence&#44; he felt free from all care 
and apprehension &#59; still at that very moment two of 
his sons&#44; the first&#8211;born and his brother&#44; presumed to 
enter the tabernacle with a strange fire&#44; which God 
had not ordained&#59; they added to the commandment&#44; 
which was not to be augmented or diminished under 
pain of death &#59; they wished to ofl&#39;er more incense than 
the mere handful which the decree of the Lord de&#8211; 
manded&#59; perhaps&#44; in imitation of the heathens&#44; they 
desired to fill the house of the Creator with the sAveet 
incense&#44; the cloud of aromatic herbs&#44; the products per&#8211; 
haps of the happy Araby and the distant Lulia. But 
this strange sacrifice was not pleasing&#44; because it had 
not been ordained&#44; and a fire went out and destroyed 
their life&#44; even whilst they were in the sanctuary. 
Here then lay the hopes of Aaron blighted &#59; the sons&#44; 
in whom he had confided and who were to assist and 
to succeed him&#44; had in the moment of wanton forget&#8211; 
fulness of the law&#44; the chosen ministers of wliich they 
had been appointed&#44; forfeited their lives &#59; they had 
died the death of transgressors against the majesty 
of the Lord. He had himself sunk from the height 
of exultation&#44; from the pinnacle of happiness&#44; into the 
depth of sorrow and anguish &#59; and the shout of the 
people&#39;s joy was changed into the sound of wailing 

<pb n="81"/>

THE RESIGNATION OF AARON. 81 

and regret&#44; because of the burning whicli the Lord 
had burned. 

It was at this moment that Moses approached his 
mourning brother&#44; and said to him&#58; &#34;This is it that 
the Lord hath spoken&#44; saying&#44; In those that come nigh 
unto me will I be sanctitied&#44; and betore ah the people 
will I be gloriiied&#44;&#34; meaning&#44; that from those who 
have received the greater light the greater responsi&#8211; 
bility will be required&#59; the nearer man approaches 
to his Maker the more energetically will his faults be 
punished&#44; God is no Respecter of persons&#59; He knows 
no distinction between his creatures&#59; He observes 
the ways of all &#59; He cares for all &#59; He provides lor 
all. But as order is Heaven&#39;s first law&#44; it is necessary 
that there should be degrees among mankind&#44; that 
there be some exalted above their fellows by the 
greater gift of riches&#44; of power&#44; and of wisdom&#44; in 
order that they all might be made instrumental in the 
proper government of the world. It was therefore so 
ordained that&#44; in proportion to the endowment&#44; should 
be the accountability&#44; that it may be proved to the 
comprehension of every son of man that the Supreme 
Judge is good alike&#44; and just alike to all&#44; and that the 
gifts He bestows are not to be regarded as the exclu&#8211; 
sive property of the actual possessor&#44; but as the means 
to distribute the benefits which may be derived from 
them&#44; as the almoner of his Creator&#44; among those of 
his fellow&#8211;creatures who come within the sphere of 
his action. It is true that God could have created all 
men alike&#44; both physically and mentally&#59; but then&#44; 
there would have been no order or subordination&#44; be&#8211; 
cause all being alike &#40;something different from equal&#41; 
no one would have been willing to obey&#44; and every 

<pb n="82"/>

82 THE RESIGNATION OF AARON. 

one would have been anxious to command. As things 
now are&#44; we find enough of contention&#59; how much 
more had the gifts of the Supreme been alike be&#8211; 
stowed&#44; unless man should cease to be man&#44; a mix&#8211; 
ture of good and evil &#33; If therefore the man in au&#8211; 
thority transgresses&#44; he transgresses not only for 
himself&#44; that is&#44; he does not only sm as an individual&#44; 
but he transgresses also for the people&#44; his sin be&#8211; 
comes an example&#44; a stone of hinderance to the sub&#8211; 
ordinate and the less learned. Although therefore&#44; it 
may be said&#44; that all mankind are alike bound by the 
same religion&#44; there is still an additional obligation 
of more particular care imposed upon those promi&#8211; 
nent either by station or intellect&#59; they are to guide 
unto good&#44; and give no cause for offence to the gen&#8211; 
eral multitude. They&#44; theretbre&#44; who like jSTadab 
and Abihu&#44; the sons of Aaron&#44; arc selected from 
among the people to stand in behalf of them before 
the Lord&#44; shoukl expect to receive instant and con&#8211; 
dign punishment for every great fault they are guilty 
of&#44; for the reason that the Lord may be sanctified by 
the visitation which they&#44; as those nearer to the Cre&#8211; 
ator&#44; receive&#44; and that all the people may glorify the 
even&#8211;handed justice which is meted out both to the 
lowly and the exalted. 

It was this point which Moses meant to impress 
upon his brother&#59; he oftered him no commonplace 
consolation&#44; he did not tell him not to grieve for the 
loss of his sons&#59; but he called his attention to the 
fact&#44; that it was a just visitation of their God whose 
law the slain ones had transgressed&#44; and that it was 
for the glorification of Ins justice that they were taken 
at the moment of their sinning&#59; because their having 

<pb n="83"/>

THE RESIGNATION OF AARON. 83 

been called to come nigh nnto the Lord should have 
taught them that it was their duty to be very careful&#44; 
how they fullillcd their ministry&#44; not by regarding it 
as having been given for their own gratification&#44; not 
by exhibiting themselves as raised above the law&#44; but 
by displaying a cheerfal obedience&#44; a ready acquies&#8211; 
cence in all that had been commanded&#44; in order that 
their service might cause the Lord to be sanctified&#44; 
and his glory to be felt by all the people. Their life 
had failed to efi&#39;ect this &#59; they transgressed&#44; they made 
a law of their own&#44; they offered a strange fire &#59; their 
death was therefore required to effect the object of 
their priesthood&#8212; and they died before the Lord. 

Aaron felt the force of the prophet&#39;s rebuke&#44; and 
he held his peace &#59; he looked upon the corpses of his 
sons&#44; and he felt they had sinned &#59; he uttered no cry 
of anguish&#44; he expressed no repining after God&#39;s jus&#8211; 
tice&#44; he spoke not of his loss&#44; of his bereavement &#59; but 
his soul rose triumphant in its confidence in the Lord&#44; 
and he held his peace&#44; he remained silent&#44; ackuowl&#8211; 
edo&#8211;ins&#58; that it is better for him to be bereft of his 
children&#44; than that the equal justice of his Creator 
should be impugned&#59; he acknowledged&#44; that the blow 
which had been struck at his peace was for the good 
of his people&#44; who also had a right and portion in 
their ministers who had been selected from among 
them. And when he was bidden not to exhibit out&#8211; 
ward signs of mourning&#44; neither he nor his remaining 
sons&#44; but that all the congregation might mourn for 
the loss of those who perished for their instruction 
and improvement&#58; he again submitted to the man&#8211; 
date&#44; not forgetting that it became him to prove to 
the people that he could conform to the behests of 

<pb n="84"/>

84 THE RESIGNATION OF AARON. 

the Lord&#44; althongli liis heart was torn with grief. 
But think jou that Aaron did not feel keenly his 
bereavement&#63; Then read the sequel of the chapter 
from which our text was chosen&#59; Moses searched for 
the sin&#8211;ofiering&#44; and finding it burnt&#44; he expressed 
his indignation to his brother&#39;s sons for their not 
having eaten the sacrifice as ordained &#59; but hear 
Aaron&#39;s answer &#58; &#34; Behold this day have they oiFered 
their sin and their burnt&#8211;offering before the Lord&#59; 
and such things have befallen me&#59; and if I bad eaten 
the sin&#8211;offering to&#8211;day&#44; would it have been acceptable 
in the eyes of the Lord&#63;&#34; This unpretending reply 
proves more strongly than any pathetic picture could 
have done&#44; that&#44; though the anointed priest yielded 
obedience&#44; yet the father felt his loss &#59; he could not 
partake of the sacrifice&#44; his soul was with his departed 
sons&#44; and rather than desecrate the offering of his 
Master by partaking of it without a proper regard to 
its sanctity and the object of its institution&#44; he pre&#8211; 
ferred having it burnt&#44; which was the remedy if aught 
of the sacrifice should have been left till the following 
morning. Moses acknowledged the force of Aaron&#39;s 
reply and he felt satisfied&#59; in other words&#44; the holy 
spirit which spoke through the prophet assented to 
the piety of the father &#59; it permitted him to feel&#44; whilst 
it demanded resignation and an unrepining submis&#8211; 
sion to the decree of the dread Judge of all. 

A resignation like this of Aaron is one of the high&#8211; 
est efforts which man can show in the service of his 
Maker&#59; it is the noblest sacrifice of self which he can 
offer up on the altar of heaven&#8211;born religion. It is 
when we are afiiicted&#44; when the tide of our prosperity 
is turned&#44; that we should hiive within us that exalted 

<pb n="85"/>

THE RESIGNATION OF AARON. 85 

confidence in the Lord&#39;s goodness&#44; wliicli should move 
us to hold our peace&#44; ay&#44; while the eyes are sufi&#39;used 
with the warm gush of nature&#39;s overflow&#44; the scald&#8211; 
ing tear&#44; while the heart heaves with convulsive 
throes&#44; while the mouth fails in uttering forth the 
cry which is wrung from the keenness of the wound 
which the soul inwardly feels. Yes&#44; it is then that 
religion exhibits her empire&#44; when she binds the 
stricken more closely to his God&#44; unites more firmly 
to the great Father the confiding child. But&#44; breth&#8211; 
ren &#33; it is not only at the moment when sorrow has 
invaded your dwelling&#44; that you should reach forth 
your hand to snatch the balm which religion imparts&#59; 
you are not to wait to invigorate yourselves with the 
dictates of our holy law until the time you are afflict&#8211; 
ed&#59; for this would be merely using Heaven&#39;s best 
gift as&#8211; a species of medicine&#44; which the patient is 
willing enough to take only while writhing under 
pain&#44; but which he refuses to touch when health is 
returning. Besides this&#44; it is &#92;ery questionable&#44; if 
religion can act as a temporary sedative&#44; any more 
than the remedies of the earthly physician&#44; if by ex&#8211; 
cesses we have destroyed our constitution&#44; or counter&#8211; 
act the effects of a skilful cure by imprudence after 
our recovery&#44; &#8212; Think you that Aaron&#39;s acquiescence 
was the eflect of the admonition of Moses&#44; produced 
only at the moment&#44; and not before existing&#44; latent&#44; 
in his soul &#63; If you think so you greatly err&#44; for 
Aaron had long been schooled in the ways of God &#59; 
he had felt his goodness&#44; had seen his mighty power&#44; 
and witnessed his justice. He had confided long since 
in the Justice with which the world is governed&#44; and 
when the shaft struck him too&#44; he could submit pa&#8211;

tiently&#44; meekly&#44; devoutly&#59; he bowed to the chastening 
Hand&#44; he adored&#44; though he suflered. Let it be the 
same with us all. Ko one lives who can save his soul 
from death. The dark portal at the entrance of eter&#8211; 
nity all have to pass&#59; the grave has been appointed 
the common receptacle for all the living on our sphere&#59; 
the silent earth&#44; or the stormy deep&#44; or the scathing 
fire&#44; or the fowls of heaven will&#44; at a time not far re&#8211; 
mote&#44; receive our mortal remains &#59; all the elements 
have been appointed our destroyers&#44; all nature seems 
leagued against our remaining long on earth. What 
right then have we to look upon ourselves and our 
nearest friends as more exempt than others from the 
common fate of humanity &#63; where is the warrant 
which assures us that our fortune&#44; our hopes&#44; our 
joys&#44; are to stand more firmly than the fortune&#44; the 
hopes&#44; the joys of others &#63; Vain delusion&#44; if we de&#8211; 
ceive ourselves &#33; fatal error&#44; if we cleave so closely to 
earth &#33; A breath of wind may overturn our fortune&#59; 
a stroke of lightning may mar our fondest hopes &#59; an 
unforeseen accident may banish our joys &#59; things we 
fondly cling to are snatched from our grasp whilst 
our eyes are gloating on them&#59; the food not yet de&#8211; 
voured is perhaps the destroyer of our life&#59; the hand 
that smooths the pillow of our couch of sickness may 
in a moment be palsied by death. And shall we then 
not be prepared by a holy life&#44; a faithful reliance 
upon Providence&#44; for the coming of the storm which 
must shipwreck our hopes&#63; are we to go on from day 
to day&#44; from hour to hour&#44; to rivet yet faster the chains 
which bind us to the mundane globe&#44; and loosen the 
bonds that unite us to our heavenly Father &#63; Shall 
wives&#44; shall children&#44; shall fathers and mothers&#44; shall

brothers and sisters&#44; shall friends and kindred&#44; shall 
wealth and renown&#44; shall wisdom and honour be for 
ever holding our spirit in thraldom&#44; and keep us 
chained to the chariot of worldly ambition&#44; forgetful 
of the end that is sure impending &#63; Ay&#44; could we 
ourselves do aught to secure our possessions from loss&#44; 
and our friends from death&#44; then indeed might our ex&#8211; 
cessive love for them be pardonable &#59; but since they 
are merely lent to us for a period&#44; to be taken away 
again whenever the Giver finds it for good to with&#8211; 
draw them &#58; how can we regard them as absolutely 
our own&#44; and their withdrawal as a personal injury 
done to ourselves &#63; Why should we not&#44; since ail on 
earth is fleeting&#44; transitory&#44; perishable&#44; decaying&#44; seek 
to accumulate treasures which are undying&#63; why 
should we not in moments of prosperity and joy en&#8211; 
deavour to calm our exultation&#44; and to look towards 
the period when a change will come&#63; why not fortify 
ourselves&#44; whilst we are at peace&#44; with faith and con&#8211; 
iidence&#44; and reliance&#44; and fortitude&#44; and learn to lean 
for support upon the Rock of ages&#44; that we may be 
able to stand erect when at length the storm of adver&#8211; 
sity assails us &#63;&#8212; And yet there are those who go on 
sinning&#44; glorying in their wickedness&#44; prosperous in 
their misdeeds&#44; as though for them there is no evil &#59; 
they live&#44; forgetful that there is an accountability for 
them because of all the wrong they have done. But 
the wheel of mourning that rolls round in the Avorld 
at length reaches them too&#59; the neglected Sabbaths&#44; 
the profaned holy days&#44; the forsaken covenant&#44; the 
unprayed orisons&#44; the hope in God not felt by them&#44; 
have not been able to ward oft&#34; the evil &#59; it has come

rity&#63; where now is their hope&#63; where now is their 
stay&#63; They mourn because of tlie wound which 
death has struck&#44; as though they had suft&#39;ered a wrong 
from the Creator&#59; they compUiin and repine&#44; as though 
they had no longer any hope or joy in aught that is 
theirs&#59; they murmur&#44; as though it was not an all&#8211; 
wise Providence that has thought fit to afflict them&#44; 
to recall as it were their thoughts from the vanities 
of this life&#44; and to fix them the more firmly on yon 
brio&#8211;ht future in the realms of bliss&#44; which is to be 
gained only through obedience and a filial reliance 
upon the promises of benignant religion. Yet if they 
would but consider that their former striving had 
been after vanities&#59; their former security but a flat&#8211; 
tering self&#8211;delusion &#59; their want of faith a rebellion 
against God&#59; the neglect of the Sabbath and the other 
precepts an actual treason against the great King&#58; 
how readily would they acquiesce in the justice of the 
decree that has been pronounced against the visitation 
that has been meted out to them. And if they could 
not like Aaron hold their peace out of full confidence 
in the goodness of the Lord&#44; if their sinful life per&#8211; 
mitted them not to see mercy in the storm as well as 
in the sunshine&#58; they would at least be willing to 
submit to their punishment with meekness becoming 
unto repentant sinners&#44; and learn henceforward to 
seek mercy and forgiveness from the Fountain of 
mercy. 

For we mav maintain as a well&#8211;established princi&#8211; 
ple that every visitation is intended for our improve&#8211; 
ment&#59; nothing is fortuitous or the eftect of chance&#44; 
all&#44; all is the effect of design&#44; the working of Provi&#8211; 
dence &#59; not an insect perishes in the flame of a lamp

around which it has been buzzing&#44; &#8212; not a bird is 
snared by the fowler&#44; &#8212; not a plant springs from the 
ground and withers&#44; &#8212; not a flower blossoms and per&#8211; 
ishes&#44; unless it be by the decree of the Omnipotent&#44; 
who is good alike to all&#59; the apparent evil&#44; death it&#8211; 
self&#44; is but a stepping&#8211;stone to happiness&#44; and the road 
to felicity leads through trials and tribulation. Is 
it then right to regard lightly the chastisements we 
may encounter&#63; or perhaps are they to harden yet 
more our hearts&#44; that we may still more obstinately 
reject the counsels of wisdom which the Bible so 
bountifully offers to our acceptance &#63; Should any one 
say in the indifference of his callous lieart&#44; in the 
scornfulness of his unbelief&#58; &#34; My son died in the 
course of nature&#44; he was cut off in his bloom&#44; as other 
children die.&#34; Or&#44; again &#58; &#34; I have not deserved such 
punishment&#59; Providence deals unjustly and cruelly 
with me &#63;&#34; To the one we would reply that&#44; although 
death is in the course of nature&#44; still every time it oc&#8211; 
curs it is in consequence of a special edict from the 
Guardian and Ruler of the world &#59; and that so far 
from the bereavement being merely accidental&#44; it 
could not have been otherwise than designedly sent 
as a warning to arouse the attention &#59; for there is no 
chance &#59; we cannot suppose that such uncertainty 
could at all enter into the sj&#39;stem of nature as de&#8211; 
signed by an all&#8211;wise Architect. To the second we 
would say&#58; No man is punished without a just cause&#44; 
and granting that you are not conscious of wrong&#44; 
still rest assured that you have been weighed and 
found wanting&#44; and that you have committed sins in 
the very acts which your interests&#44; inclinations&#44; or 
passions have taught you to regard&#34; as innocent. Thus

if 3&#39;oii profane liabitnally tlie Sabbath&#44; if 3&#39;ou refuse 
to enter yonr cliildron in the Lord&#39;s covenant&#44; if you 
obstinately persist in not teaching tlieni the words of 
the law&#44; if in short you are regardless of the Mosijic 
code &#8212; transgressing the precepts &#8212; and arc an indo&#8211; 
lent follower of forbidden pleasures &#8212; are you not a 
sinner in the eyes of the Lord&#44; although in your own 
estimation you are innocent and pure &#63; 

If&#44; therefore&#44; any evil befalls us&#44; we should at once 
set about investigating our conduct&#44; and reform the 
sinfulness of our ways&#59; perhaps the Lord may see our 
altered course&#44; and remove from us farther his anger. 
And&#44; are not the punishments the tempests which 
purify the moral life&#44; just as the winds and lightnings 
those wdiich clear the physical atmosphere&#63; Do we 
blame the Almighty for causing the wind to blow 
which lashes into foam the before placid ocean &#63; Do 
we arraign the justice of Providence for the vivid 
lightning which plays around our dwelling and ter&#8211; 
rifies our appalled vision&#63; Does not every one recog&#8211; 
nize them as harbingers of good&#44; as the agents sent to 
refresh the earth&#44; to restore vegetation&#44; to destroy nox&#8211; 
ious vapours which else might settle down upon the 
surface of the globe&#44; and corrupt the air&#44; the water&#44; 
and the soil whence we derive our sustenance&#63; But 
precisely similar are the visitations which ever and 
anon come over us &#59; the placidity of our uniform life&#39;s 
current may be lashed into billows&#44; but the Lord is in 
the storm &#59; lie calls our attention to the noxious&#44; to 
the putrefied state of our conduct&#44; He bids us to re&#8211; 
move the evil which we discover&#44; in order that&#44; when 
the storm has spent its rage&#44; we may stand before 
Ilim renovated in the strength of divine love and live

unto eternity. Let the lightning rend our peace&#44; let 
its desolation be visible in our dwelling&#44; let us be 
shaken by the roll of the thunder &#58; be assured God is 
in the fire&#44; it is His voice we hear. He calls us to 
llini&#44; He rouses us from our slumoer&#44; He appeals to 
our better feeling&#44; He wills that we should awaken 
iVom the torpor of deadly sin&#44; and live in His pres&#8211; 
ence&#44; scathed&#44; yet purified &#8212; smitten&#44; yet cleansed &#8212; 
wounded&#44; yet healed again. If thus we look upon 
sufterings&#44; who can say that they are not fit instru&#8211; 
ments for the purposes of a beneficent Providence 
to instruct and improve mankind&#63; Prosperity but 
blunts the feelings &#59; constant success but binds man 
closer to life&#59; uninterrupted well&#8211;being but induces 
him to toil more energetically to gain a larger share 
of the world&#39;s goods&#59; and very often it is atfliction 
only which teaches him better things. Happy indeed 
would it be&#44; if the empire of religion were so far ex&#8211; 
tended&#44; that in the hours of joy man would take it to 
heart to become a truer servant of the Most High &#59; 
that&#44; when success augments his stores&#44; he would 
consecrate his life to God&#44; and repose on the days 
when labour is forbidden &#59; to walk humbly amidst 
the shouts of admiration &#59; to feel himself mortal even 
in the very hour of conquest and triumph. But&#44; alas&#33; 
many then have an ear only for flattery&#59; a heart only 
for pride&#59; a leisure only for enjoyment&#59; a mind only 
for worldly things&#59; no time for religion&#44; no mind for 
prayer&#44; no hour for worship&#44; no day for rest. All&#44; all 
is one whirl of excitement&#44; one rush after gain and 
renown &#58; religion lies neglected&#44; God is forgotten. It 
is therefore that admonitions come opportunely to the 
aid of our better nature&#44; to move us to cast ofi&#39; the

fatal tnoral indolence&#44; to induce ns to review our way&#44; 
and to apply the remedy where we discover defects. 
For it is at the time when our pride has been rebuked 
by adversity&#44; when our medical skill has shown itself 
incompetent to save the life of a beloved olfspring&#44; 
M&#39;hen the accumulated wealth of ages has been una&#8211; 
ble to purchase one hour of a life of sufferings&#44; when 
man utterly feels his helplessness without Divine as&#8211; 
sistance&#44; when we experience a disgust at worldly 
o&#8211;reatness&#44; and worldly wealth&#44; and worldly wisdom 
which failed to afford us relief&#44;&#8212; that we are drawn 
towards the Creator and his mercy&#44; to the God who 
can give life and health&#44; and whose are the wisdom 
and understanding. If we now profit by this devo&#8211; 
tional feeling called up at the moment of sorrow&#44; if 
we let our afflictions make a lasting impression on 
our future life and conduct&#58; then may it be truly 
said&#44; that God has been sanctified by our bereave&#8211; 
ment&#44; and been glorified by our humiliation&#44; and the 
death of a friend by which he was released from 
bodily ailment may have opened to us the gates of 
heaven. It is not only by the death of the sons of 
Aaron by whom the glory of the Lord was to be ex&#8211; 
tended&#44; but likewise by the departure hence of every 
son of Adam to the latest generation. There is a 
lesson to be drawn from every death&#8211;bed scene&#44; from 
the sinner&#39;s as well as of the righteous&#59; and the one 
dying in his impenitence teaches with no less force 
than the calm resignation of the other. Everything&#44; 
in short&#44; that occurs to us is full of import&#44; and will 
guide us on to a happier lot&#44; if we will but heed the 
instruction hourly aftbrded unto us. 

If we now do take the Divine dispensations to heart

as faithful servants&#44; do tliaiik our Creator amidst onr 
afflictions as well as onr joys&#58; Low sweet will the in&#8211; 
cense be which we thus dffer to Ilini&#59; our subdued 
pride&#44; our renewed hope&#44; our regenerated life&#44; our love 
of law rekindled to burn with a bright flame unto our 
dying day will appeal for us to our everlasting Father&#44; 
and He will send his grace unto our afflicted soul and 
refresh it with his comforting spirit. Sorrow will be 
changed into joy&#44; anguish into exultation&#59; and instead 
of repining and complaint&#44; there will be meek resig&#8211; 
nation and humble submission. ISTo rebellious feel&#8211; 
ing will be called up&#44; no murmur because of the dis&#8211; 
pensation will be heard&#59; but in entire faith&#44; in the 
full hope of a better hereafter we will exclaim &#58; &#34; lie 
is the Lord&#44; let Ilim do what seemeth good to Him&#33;&#34; 
When one endowed with such holy resignation does 
stand weeping over the grave of his beloved wife&#44; or 
his only oftspring cut off in the early vigour of man&#8211; 
hood and renown&#44; it needs but to remind him that it 
is God who has afflicted him &#59; it were vain to ofler 
any other consolation&#44; he will at once recognize the 
force of the appeal&#44; he will recall his wavering confi&#8211; 
dence and rest of the soul&#44; and bear with meekness 
the loss he has sustained&#44; and endeavour in renewed 
activity&#44; in benevolence and devotion&#44; to regain his 
lost composure. 

Religion bids us not&#44; not to mourn &#59; it tells us not&#44; 
that we should not regret thQ death of our friends&#59; 
on the contrary&#44; it prescribes observances which are 
eminently calculated to arouse the feelings. We rend 
the garment&#44; we eat the bread of mourning&#44; we sit 
on the ground&#44; we adorn not the person&#44; we are to 
abstain from pleasure&#44; we are not to mix in general

society&#59; and all this has been ordained that we might 
dwell with serious reflection upon the evil that has 
come upon us. But when the thirty days for all hut 
our father and mother&#44; for whom we are to seclude 
ourselves for an entire year&#44; have elapsed&#44; it is the 
duty of the mourner to resume his walk amidst liis 
lello&#92;v&#8211;men &#59; his regret need not to cease with this 
period&#44; but the outward exhibition of grief surely 
should &#59; and I know not whether the custom of wearing 
particular garments&#44; by those who have lost friends&#44; 
beyond the prescribed time&#44; may not be safely regard&#8211; 
ed as opposed to the spirit of religion. There is no 
question&#44; however&#44; that it is sinful to carry regret to 
too great an extent&#44; to let months elapse before com&#8211; 
posure is restored&#44; to have the house darkened&#44; or to 
wear sombre&#8211;coloured garments&#44; or to refuse min&#8211; 
gling again in society&#44; for too long a period &#59; for such 
behaviour tells but too plainly&#59; that the sufferer re&#8211; 
fuses to yield himself to the decrees of Heaven&#44; that 
he perhaps thinks that he has been afflicted with an 
unmerited injury from his God. A fault like this is 
but too apt to be committed by the more wealthy and 
respectable portions of the community &#59; they are not 
actively enough employed and have too much leisure 
for profitless reflection&#44; especially if their faith and 
religious conviction should not be sufficiently firm 
and confiding. It is well&#44; however&#44; to remind them 
that&#44; with the past sorrows&#44; the hand of the Lord is 
n&#40;>t straitened&#44; and that Ilis arm is yet outstretched 
to smite them with renewed plagues. And who 
knows but that their stubbornness may merit a new 
punishment&#44; and that in addition to the one already 
taken another may also be soon required&#44; or that

some other calaraitj yet tuay be sent&#44; a calamity which 
they now but little dream of&#63; For what sin can be 
greater than a rebellious heart&#63; what conduct more 
deserving of visitation than niurniuring against the 
dispensation of Providence&#63; And yet we constantly 
see such unbecoming grief exhibited&#44; and men will 
brave the vengeance of Heaven by their unyielding&#44; 
disconsolate behaviour. Why should we be discon&#8211; 
solate &#63; Say you&#44; because one dear to us has fallen &#33; 
Truly a friend has fallen&#44; but he fell as all must fall 
when their appointed hour has come&#59; he was sum&#8211; 
moned hence by the will of his Maker&#44; the Lord of 
his body and his soul&#44; who deemed it best now to 
close the earthly career of him we deplore&#44; because 
his task was ended&#44; or because his death was neces&#8211; 
sary for the edification of the world or ourselves&#44; and 
for the glory of his God. 

We will now define resignation&#44; as a close to the 
subject which we have been considering to&#8211;day. 
Resignation consists not in indifl&#58;erence&#44; in a brutal 
disregard of life&#44; but in the filial deference to the 
will of God&#44; because it was his pleasure to afflict us. 
It proceeds from a well&#8211;grounded belief in the con&#8211; 
stant supervision of Providence and in his overruling 
goodness&#44; in the unwavering faith that every thing 
which is sent by Ilim is for the ultimate happiness of 
mankind. It farther teaches us that all sublunary 
things&#44; wealth&#44; wisdom&#44; power&#44; renown&#44; nay even 
life itself are fleeting&#44; and of uncertain duration&#44; lia&#8211; 
ble to bo resumed at any moment by Him who gave 
them. Therefore it impresses upon the pious man 
the necessity of a cheerful submission whenever the 
evil reaches him in his turn&#44; and admonishes him to

look for support from the Author of liis being to sus&#8211; 
tain him amidst his affliction. It will light up joy 
within him amidst the gloom of despair&#44; and instruct 
him how to extract the grace of life from the poison 
of distress and sorrow. Yes&#44; it will incite liim to 
robe himself wdth piety and meekness&#44; to stretch forth 
his hand to the fruit of the tree of life&#44; to the words 
of the law&#44; to the precepts of the everlasting King&#44; in 
whose presence there is the fulness of joy&#44; and in 
whose temple all speaks glory. 

You&#44; therefore&#44; beloved brethren &#33; who have in&#8211; 
trusted to the cold earth the bodies of your beloved 
ones&#44; rejoice in the Lord &#33; glorify His name&#44; despite 
of your affliction &#33; bow your heads to the rod that 
chasteneth you &#33; and learn to enter life everlasting 
through the gate of tribulation. In the heavenly 
Gilead there is a balm&#44; a Physician too is there&#59; and 
if you say in the sincerity of your heart&#58; &#34;Blessed 
art Thou&#44; Lord&#33; our God&#44; King of the universe&#44; 
who art a righteous Judge&#59;&#34; if you thank Him in 
the hour of anguish as well as the moments of joy &#58; 
be assured that the balm will be poured into your 
wounds&#44; and that the great Physician will heal your 
bruises by his everlasting grace &#59; and you will be like 
Aaron of old endowed with strength to submit with 
resignation and calm fortitude to the decree&#44; which 
has sealed the portion of your beloved ones unto un&#8211; 
ending life &#33;

To Him who sits enthroned in the assembly of his 
holy servants&#44; in whose presence all speaks of his 
glory&#44; who is almighty to save&#44; who is faithful to his 
covenant&#44; and to whose days there is no end&#44; be glory

Moses&#44; the man of God&#44; was one of those favoured 
mortals who have at times been permitted to arrive 
at a nearer approach to the Deity&#44; than falls to the 
share of other men&#44; In other words&#44; he was a prophet&#44; 
a messenger deputed to work out by extraordinary 
displays of power the mission of his Sender. He 
came back into Egypt to a people debased by slavery 
and a broken spirit&#44; subdued by the fear of their 
powerful task&#8211;masters&#44; and corrupted by the evil ex&#8211; 
amples&#44; the idolatry&#44; and the moral depravity of their 
highly&#8211;refined tyrants&#44; as a messenger merely of good 
tidings&#44; not armed with worldly greatness&#44; not fol&#8211;

lowed by a numerous retinue to enforce his demands&#44; 
but as an individual full of a high resolve&#44; laden with 
a potent spell&#44; to essay the fulfilment of his message 
without a resort to human co&#8211;operation&#44; without the 
employment of earthly means. He became the chosen 
instrument of Israel&#39;s redemption &#59; and the Passover 
which we now celebrate was instituted to keep the 
memory of this event ever alive and unforgotten 
among our latest descendants. He&#44; the outcast&#44; the 
shepherd of his kinsman&#39;s flocks in the desert of 
Horeb&#44; the man diffident of his own powers&#44; unable 
to articulate correctly&#44; because he was heavy of speech&#44; 
he who had sought refuge among roving hordes of 
an inhospitable land&#44; became enabled to humble unto 
submission the proudest and most magnificent mon&#8211; 
arch of that age&#44; and by divine assistance was per&#8211; 
mitted to raise those&#44; who like him were descended 
from the noble stock of Abraham&#44; to the enviable 
distinction of being made the depositary of God&#39;s 
covenant. In this manner the oppressors and the 
oppressed changed positions&#59; they who had formerly 
wisdom to bestow could now well become learners 
from those they formerly ruled over&#59; and thus were 
shown&#44; to the conviction of every one who thinks&#44; 
the nothingness of human power when contending 
against the will of the Supreme&#44; and the emptiness 
of a mortal&#39;s knowledge when compared with the 
wisdom flowing directly from the Source of truth 
and light. 

It must have been under the influence of feelings 
of this kind that Moses composed the beautiful prayer 
which is the ninetieth in our collection of Psalms. He 
opens with an acknowledgment of the divine protec&#8211;

tion which had ever been extended to Israel from the 
beginning of the world. He then alkides to the 
eternity of God&#44; and his goodness in snatching man 
from the ways of sin by timely admonition and the 
acceptance of repentance. He next compares the 
infinity of the Creator with the perishableness of the 
creatnre&#44; which nevertheless dares to provoke the 
wrath of the Omnipotent by its reckless disregard of 
his precepts. Pie expatiates on the brief space allotted 
to man during his sojourn on earth&#44; and the sorrows 
to which his sinful nature exposes him. Again he 
pictures the effects of God&#39;s indignation towards the 
wayward child&#44; and the terrible power which the All&#8211; 
wise has over all nature&#44; lie endeavours to contrast 
the Lord&#39;s greatness with man&#39;s insignificance&#44; not 
by entering into details&#44; but by exhibiting so to say 
the brief outline which his devotional feelings have 
called up in his mind &#58; he is lost in the immensity of 
the Almighty&#39;s goodness and might&#44; and only sees 
refnge for mortals in a devout fear of the Creator&#44; 
and in a reverential obedience to his precepts. He 
feels that there is safety in virtue alone&#44; and then con&#8211; 
tinues&#58;

wealth&#44; the meek in spirit&#44; the old in 3&#39;years&#44; the de&#8211; 
crepit by disease&#63; lie is their superior&#59; he is of 
lofty station&#44; of g&#8211;reat wealth&#44; high in mind&#44; and con&#8211; 
fident in his power&#59; he is in the springtime of life&#44; 
and disease and its corroding pangs are to him un&#8211; 
known. He therefore steps abroad lightly and full 
of confidence&#44; he is assured that evil will not reach 
him&#44; and that he is born to command&#44; or it may be 
even that death will not have dominion over his body. 
To one so completely enamoured of self &#40;and there 
are many such&#41; life appears made solely for the indi&#8211; 
vidual alone&#44; all must yield submissively to him&#44; and 
he can learn but little from others &#59; for in wisdom 
and in learning lie fancies himself superior to almost 
all who are his companions&#44; and he therefore spurns 
advice and instruction as derogatory to his assumed 
dignity. It need not be that this fancied great being 
should be actually of high importance &#59; for alas &#33; the 
number of those is great who claim a rank which 
neither talent nor station does confer on them&#44; and 
equally with the actually wise and elevated in society 
they rely on their own wisdom and their own strength 
of arm. But be the presumption of mortals based 
upon worldly greatness or not&#44; it is ecpially destructive 
to the peace of its victim&#44; equally injurious to the hap&#8211; 
piness of the hapless one who surrenders his mind 
captive to its fascination. It warps the understand&#8211; 
ing&#44; it closes the heart&#44; and lies with a deadening 
weight upon the spirit in its reach after immortal 
glory. For no sooner does man endeavour to con&#8211; 
quer his self&#8211;love with a view of acquiring knowledge&#44; 
than this incii&#39;biit&#8211;&#39; drowiis&#63; the resolution scarcely

Should he listen to the disquieting voice of admoni&#8211; 
tion which the Holy One has planted in him &#63; can he 
be diverted from his high aim of worldly ambition 
and carnal enjoyment by the dread of an end that to 
him perchance may never come &#63; Assuredly not &#59; 
and he continues the slave of presumption&#44; the will&#8211;

mortal&#39;s foresight cannot save him from destruction &#59; 
human wisdom is constantly turned to naught&#59; and 
though we do bloom like the opening flower in the 
morning&#44; before the sun goes down we may be cut 
oft&#39; and left to wither. &#8212; Often has this melancholy 
fact been presented to our consideration&#44; dailj&#8211; is our 
attention arrested&#59; but we hide our face from the 
unwelcome sight&#44; we wish not to be disturbed by 
those harrowing intruders&#44; painful reflections upon the 
ills which befall others and may reach us &#59; we banish

such tlionglits from our minds&#44; simply because they 
teach us bur own insignilicance&#44; and point out but 
too surely what our end will be. Were it that ban&#8211; 
ishing thought could turn aside the evil&#59; could want 
of reflection render our body immortal and of ever&#8211; 
returning youthfulness &#58; then indeed might we be 
justified in Hving forgetful of our end. But not 
thinking&#44; not caring&#44; not heeding&#44; render us not ex&#8211; 
empt from change and grief&#44; and the evil not appre&#8211; 
hended will nevertheless come and fulfil its errand. 
There is no stability in life&#44; no certainty in worldly 
possessions&#58; whilst we rejoice we are hastening unto 
death&#44; and the delights we fondly crave pass away 
like the vision of the night. A thousand instances 
crowd on the mind as examples which could verify 
these remarks&#44; and a man must have lived without 
any reflection and to but little purpose wdiose recol&#8211; 
lection is not stored with several instances of this na&#8211; 
ture. But one pre&#8211;eminently awful as a warning oc&#8211; 
curred not many years since&#44; and it may perhaps be 
well to call it up from the mass of human suft&#39;erings&#44; 
which history has treasured up as lessons and guides 
to our better nature. 

In a port renowned for its extensive commerce and 
wealth lay moored a bark of beautiful exterior and 
extensive dimensions. Iler leviathan&#8211;like length&#44; her 
well&#8211;appointed machinery&#44; her endearing name&#44; a 
name which the exile loves to dwell on&#44; which re&#8211; 
minds the absent son of the roof of his father&#44; all 
pointed her out as a desirable means to enable the 
returning wanderer to reach his &#34;home&#34; speedily 
and safely. It was in the beginning of autumn&#44; the 
time appointed for our atonement&#44; the Sabbath pre&#8211;

ceding the great day of the forgiveness of sin &#59; and 
sea&#44; and earth&#44; and sky alike appeared rejoicing in 
the brilliant light which a glorious sun was shedding 
on all around. Multitudes assembled upon the deck 
of the vessel that was so soon to be their only protec&#8211; 
tion&#44; under God&#44; between life and death&#44; and gay 
faces and happy hearts looked forward to be ere long 
reunited in restored health to friends they had left 
several months beibre. Who thought of impending 
destruction &#63; of a speedy death &#63; Their path seemed 
even before them&#44; and the mother spoke cheerfully 
to the daughter&#44; the brother looked with confident 
anticipation on the brother&#44; and the taithful wife re&#8211; 
minded the husband gaily that soon they would again 
behold their happy dwelling and their beloved chil&#8211; 
dren. &#8212; The bark bears her power within herself&#44; she 
needs not to wait for the fickle wind or the change&#8211; 
ful tide&#59; her powerful oars lash the water as though 
eager for the start&#44; like the neighing steed paws the 
ground when the martial trumpet calls him to the 
fight&#44; or the tap of the drum summons him to the 
race &#59; the hissing steam escapes from the opened 
valve&#44; and the whole fabric trembles at every joint 
as if impatient for the word of command which is to 
release it from its ties to the earth. The word at 
length is given&#44; and away flies the ship with almost 
unapproachable speed &#59; and from the shore saluting 
friends greet the travellers with a final &#34; God be with 
you&#44;&#34; and when the increasing distance quickly con&#8211; 
ceals them entirely from their aching view&#44; some 
commend their bjloved ones to the keeping of their 
Father in heaven&#44; Avhilst others have full reliance 
upon the skill of the builder and the excellency of

the ship&#39;s crew&#44; and in their vanity and confidence 
of human means they resort not to prayer. 

Soon the ocean is reached &#59; and its surface is 
smooth like a polislied mirror&#44; and the widespread 
waters are sraiUng all around&#44; and almost invite the 
traveller to venture abroad on their level plain. 
Barely a ripple ruffles the sea&#44; as it spangles and 
glitters against the reflected light of day&#39;s bright 
luminary&#44; and onward hies the bark towards her 
destined haven with almost unobstructed velocity. 
But lo &#33; the treacherous element assumes a different 
aspect &#59; the winds are loosened from their treasures &#59; 
and the curling waves soon proclaim that the deceit&#8211; 
ful calm is broken. l&#33;Tow the mariner exerts his skill &#59; 
he fears a rocky shore&#44; he looks with dread alarm 
to the gloom which marks but too plainly where de&#8211; 
struction would await him. Onward yet staggers the 
doomed craft&#44; as if conscious that upon her depend 
the lives and fortunes of many a throbbing heart&#59; 
she ploughs gallantly through the angry billows&#59; the 
sinking hopes of the crew are almost reanimated iu 
the fond expectation that the fury of the storm will 
soon abate &#59; but hark &#33; the crash of timbers tells that 
the fabric whicli human hands have so skilfully joined 
is yielding itself to the blast&#44; to the strength of God&#39;s 
aerial messenger. Still the progress is onward &#59; the 
element of fire with which the vessel is armed yet 
battles with the floods without&#44; and though crippled 
she nevertheless keeps on her way &#59; but this last re&#8211; 
fuge also is soon taken&#44; and the living fire is quench&#8211; 
ed by the rising waters which steal into the wreck&#59; 
and the last hopes of its precious freight are extin&#8211; 
guished too. It is night &#59; &#8212; the day is the third from

their departure &#59; the hour the close of the Day of 
Atonement&#59; and many who belong not to the seed 
of Abraham have unwillingly spent a day of fasting 
and humiliation in anxious dread because of their 
peril. And some children of the house of Israel are 
also there&#44; and see the working of their God in the 
storm and the billows&#44; their hearts subdued by the 
display of his might. 

The vessel now drifts shoreward&#44; bereft of control 
over her motion&#44; at the mercy of the storm and waves. 
The timid maiden claims the protection of the manlj 
youth who stands mute beside her&#59; the wife clings 
in despair to her husband&#44; as though he could save 
her&#59; the daughter appeals to the helpless mother&#44; 
and man asks vainly the aid of a fellow&#8211;mortal. But 
hark again &#33; what betokens this crash &#63; The vessel 
has struck&#44; she remains immovable&#44; her onward 
course is checked by the reef on which she lies. 
Billow after billow strikes the wreck&#44; piece by piece 
is every joint dissevered&#44; and one long shout of wail&#8211; 
ing tells that the work of death is done. A hundred 
human beings are engulfed in one instant of time&#59; 
and by the friend the maiden sinks&#59; wife and hus&#8211; 
band linked together go down into the deep&#44; and mo&#8211; 
ther and daughter&#44; who were loving in life&#44; are not 
separated in death. Few only are left to battle with 
the sea upon detached planks and broken timbers&#44; 
fewer yet reach the shore in the gloom of the night&#44; 
exhausted and benumbed&#44; and are left living wit&#8211; 
iiessess of the goodness of that Providence which 
rescued them from impending danger&#44; which spared 
their lives when so many others were taken. &#8212; Many 
families look anxiously forward for the return of a

father&#44; a husband&#44; a mother&#44; a son&#44; a daughter&#44; a 
sister&#44; and a brother&#59; but these come not&#44; and no 
more in this world will they meet the beloved&#44; not 
even will their eyes be permitted to look upon the 
face of the dead&#44; which the ocean will not yield up 
till the graves are opened unto everlasting resurrec&#8211; 
tion &#59; and long will many a bereaved household dwell 
with grief upon the recollection of the wreck of the 
Home. 

It was not&#44; brethren&#44; for the purpose of telling you 
a tale of wo&#44; that I have called your attention to this 
sorrowful recital&#59; but only to ask you to let it awaken 
in you reflections upon the uncertainty of your earthly 
existence. Would the many that perished on that 
melancholy occasion have ventured upon the deck of 
the frail vessel which became their grave&#44; had they 
known their danger&#63; and yet they ventured thither 
full of confidence&#44; calculating with certainty to meet 
their friends in the course of three or four days. If 
any one had called upon them before their embarka&#8211; 
tion and admonished them to repent of their wicked&#8211; 
ness&#44; because in less than a week they would be sum&#8211; 
moned before the great Judge of all &#58; would they have 
heeded&#63; would they not have called the preacher an 
alarmist&#63; a false prophet of evil&#63; Still their security 
would have been imaginary&#44; and their deferred re&#8211; 
pentance been no safeguard against the evil whicli 
had been decreed. &#8212; Our end does approach&#44; our death 
will come&#44; whether our life has been well or ill&#8211;spent&#59; 
the dissolution of the connexion between body and 
soul is the common fate of the good and the wicked&#44; 
of him who feared God&#44; and of him who did not 
serve his Maker. But how difl&#58;erent is the condition

of the one from that of the other&#33; The servant of 
God sees liis end draw near&#44; and his stay is in the 
Lord&#59; with his hist expiring breath he sanctifies liis 
Creator&#59; he rejoices in tlie coming reunion&#44; and lie 
breathes forth liis spirit with &#34;The Lord is One&#34; 
upon his tongue in a perfect reliance of a better 
world&#44; where there is no pain&#44; no sorrow&#33; The sin&#8211; 
ner&#44; however&#44; stands upon the threshold of eternity 
in doubt&#44; and trembling&#59; he fears to quit this life&#44; be&#8211; 
cause he has no hope of joys hereafter&#59; his unwilling 
spirit trembles as it is summoned&#44; and the feeble 
prayer&#44; haply too late essayed&#44; dies away unuttered 
amidst the agonies of a violent death or the pain of 
helpless maladies. Do we&#44; however&#44; attend well to 
this consideration&#63; is our conduct such as reason 
would ask&#63; do we choose wisely&#63; are we servants in 
the house of the Lord&#44; or are we unwilling and but 
occasional attendants&#63; how does the account of our 
sins stand with which our soul is loaded&#63; &#8212; Alas&#33; we 
regard but rarely our perishable state&#44; and we act as 
though we were immortal&#44; or&#44; if mortal&#44; unaccount&#8211; 
able. We venture heedlessly upon the bark of life&#44; 
we are impatient to commence a brilliant course&#44; we 
Avince under restraint&#44; and trusting to the apparent 
strength and security of our position we hasten upon 
the broad expanse which the world opens to our 
charmed view. How gay and bright every thing ap&#8211; 
pears in the heyday of youth&#33; how unruffled&#44; how 
calm does the ocean of life seem to our sight&#33; we 
dream not there is danger&#44; we heed not the quick&#8211; 
sands and rocks which beset our career. Speak to

we deem ourselves wise above the ancients&#44; more in&#8211; 
telligent than were our fathers before us&#59; we wish 
not to know the law of God&#44; our own reason we think 
sufficient to guide us rightly &#59; we care not to bow at 
the altar where our brothers worship &#59; for we ask not 
heavenlj&#39;aid to bless our undertakings. &#8212; It is well&#59; &#8212; 
God is long&#8211;suffering. He punishes not instantly the 
sinner in his transgressing&#44; and years roll on&#44; and we 
imagine that we have fairly proved&#44; &#34;that we can 
tempt God and yet escape.&#34; But our calm is deceit&#8211; 
ful&#44; the apparent beauty and elegant proportions of 
the bark in which we have trusted are delasive&#44; and 
the storm of adversity will assail us ere we heed its 
approach. We may struggle awhile against the con&#8211; 
tending billows&#59; we may essay&#44; in our confidence upon 
our own strength&#44; to avoid the destruction which we 
see impending&#59; but in vain&#33; we contend against One 
far too mighty for our feebleness&#59; we strive against 
the decree of unerring Wisdom&#44; and lo&#33; the fire of 
our resistance is quenched by the accumulating ills 
that beset us&#44; and our bark lies broken upon an in&#8211; 
hospitable shore&#44; and we are driven from our security&#44; 
floating&#44; so to say&#44; upon some portion of a wreck at 
the mercy of the waves&#44; which are curling and wreath&#8211; 
ina&#58; over our devoted heads. 

Happy indeed would we be&#44; if amidst adversity we 
would return and seek the Lord and his strength &#59; if 
we would learn to break the stubbornness of our hearts 
when chastisement has awakened our attention. But 
unfortunately our memory of things once endured is 
very short&#59; the effect of calamity as an improver of 
the heart is soon blotted out&#59; and as the shipwrecked

mariner&#44; who alone survives of an entire crew&#44; will 
immediately&#44; on his wound being healed&#44; again brave 
the treacherous main &#58; so do we throw oft&#39; the recol&#8211; 
lection of sufterings when healing has been vouchsafed 
to our sorrows &#59; we sin anew&#44; unmindful of the Power 
that fain would teach us wisdom&#44; &#8212; as Pharaoh of old&#44; 
who transgressed again when he was no longer terri&#8211; 
fied by the unusual voice of the thunder&#44; the flashes 
of lightning&#44; the murderous hailstones&#44; and the sweep&#8211; 
in o&#8211; rain. Yes&#44; the flood of adversity is past&#44; and the 
good resolution we had formed is also vanished &#59; we 
go on as we were wont to do&#44; and we stand with a 
bold front&#44; daring sinners&#44; in the presence of the mer&#8211; 
ciful Creator&#59; we brave afresh his terrors&#44; forgetful 
that though of unending kindness He is an upright 
Judge&#44; who suflers no evil to go unpunished. Whilst 
suft&#39;ering&#44; we perceived as it were dimly that we are 
mortal f whilst calamities assailed us&#44; we yielded that 
our power is not all&#8211;sufiicient&#59; whilst the weight of 
sorrow pressed heavily on our spirit&#44; we discovered 
that our reason can become clouded and uncertain. 
But now we presume again to tread ambition&#39;s path 
heedless of our end&#59; we dive into business specula&#8211; 
tion&#44; as though we could command success &#59; we are 
again confideni in our wisdom&#59; we again press on&#8211; 
ward&#44; contemning the wisdom of God&#44; relying on our 
own judgment as infallible. What else remains for 
a merciful Providence but to afilict us again&#44; and to 
renew the admonition which we once neglected&#63; 

You will thus see&#44; beloved brethren&#44; that the ca&#8211;

confident of our own prowess&#44; more relying on our 
own wisdom &#59; but adversities prove to us the nothing&#8211; 
ness of all we cling to &#58; the ills of life strip it of its 
delusive colours&#44; and point out to us where our safety 
lies&#44; where the haven is prepared to offer us refuge 
against the fury of the storm. Therefore&#44; says Moses 
in liis prayer&#58; &#34;Thou turnest men to contrition&#44; and 
sayest. Return&#44; ye children of men&#59;&#34; meaning&#44; that 
the dispensation of woes will lead us to ofter the sac&#8211; 
rifice of a contrite heart to our Maker&#44; who then will 
be graciously ready to receive back into his paternal 
embrace the returning children of men&#44; though they 
have grievously sinned. It is in his dispensations 
that God speaketh to us&#44; and well it is for us if we 
have arrived at such a state of holiness and humility 
that&#44; like the bee wdiich extracts honey from every 
flower&#44; we are able to learn wisdom and a lesson of 
piety from every punishment which is sent to try our 
constancy. &#8212; Therefore also continues the prophet &#58; 
&#34;Teach us to number our days&#44;&#34; meaning&#44; he prays 
that God may make us sensible of our perishable na&#8211; 
ture&#44; that He may instil in our mind the conviction 
that our days are numbered &#8212; numbered and limited 
by the indisputable will of our Creator&#44; and that all 
our striving&#44; all our working&#44; all our reaching after 
greatness&#44; all our hastening after wealth&#44; all our lust 
for renown&#44; will be cut short by the enemy that lies 
in wait for us unperceived upon every step we take&#44; 
ready at all moments to bear us hence whenever we 
are summoned. Yes&#44; he earnestly entreats for grace 
to assist us to humble ourselves as becomes mortals 
before the undying One&#59; and he adds&#44; therefore&#44; &#34; that 
we may apply our hearts to wisdom.&#34; Does he mean

that worldly wisdom which consists only in an accu&#8211; 
mulation of ideas derived from others&#44; a great and 
general knowledge of the structure of various lan&#8211; 
guages&#44; a comprehensive understanding of scientific 
things&#44; or that peculiar perception of merely tangible 
results which enables the merchant to dispose of his 
wares to the best advantage&#44; and stimulates man to 
try various schemes for the acquisition of wealth &#63; 
By no means&#59; for such wisdom&#44; useful though it be 
in its own peculiar province&#44; is not that which will 
assist us to number our days&#59; it is not that wisdom 
which can teach us how to make our peace with our 
Maker. The wisdom for which Moses prayed is the 
knowledge of our own relation to God&#44; is the clear 
perception of the duties which it behoves the creature 
to assume as the child of the great Parent. As we 
read elsewhere &#40;Job xxviii. 27&#41; &#58; &#34; And He said to 
man. Behold&#33; to fear the Lord is wisdom&#44; and to es&#8211; 
chew evil is understanding.&#34; If we are endowed 
&#92;vith this wisdom&#44; if our understanding has reached 
this point of perfection&#44; we can then look upon our 
life with correct views&#59; all our acts will then be for 
the glorification of the Lord&#44; and even our daily toil&#44; 
which we pursue for the support of our bodily func&#8211; 
tions&#44; will then have a holy object&#44; that is&#44; we will 
labour in our calling cheerfully&#44; willinglj&#8211;&#44; relying 
upon the mercy of God to prosper our undertaking 
as lie may deem best&#44; and we will then not repine if 
our well&#8211;matured schemes fail to answer our expecta&#8211; 
tions. &#8212; This wisdom will teach us to moderate our 
desires&#44; it will enable ns to restrain our passions&#44; and 
to confine all our actions within the limits of the law 
of God. It will assist us so to number our days that&#44;

virtuous deed which is to speak for us upon the book 
of memorial before the Lord of those that fear Ilim 
and think upon his name &#59; in order that&#44; when our 
race is run&#44; there may not be a single day which 
could accuse ns of having neglected to offer on it an 
acceptable deed to the Deity. 

But&#44; brethren&#44; is this our conduct&#63; does not many 
a day pass in utter forgetfulness of God&#39;s holy law &#63; 
do we not oflend daily in our body&#44; in our posses&#8211; 
sions&#44; in our spirit&#63; How many of us are there who 
regard not the Sabbath and the festivals&#44; who continue 
their labours on the days when labour is sinful&#44; not 
minding the commandment which bids them rest&#44; 
because the wisdom of God has so ordained it &#63; They 
imagine that their wealth will be increased by con&#8211; 
stant toil&#44; by unceasing attention to business&#59; the 
Sabbath therefore comes&#44; ushering in rest and joy to 
the servants of the Lord&#44; but it brings no rest&#44; no joy 
to them &#59; the house of prayer receives the devout 
worshippers&#44; but they are away&#59; they bear publicly 
burdens from their houses on the Sabbath&#59; their 
places of business are open &#59; the usual enticements to 
the passers by are exposed &#59; their workshops are not 
closed&#44; their tools and implements of trade are not 
unemployed&#44; and they restrain not their&#44; feet on the 
day of rest&#44; but they pursue journeys&#44; attend to their 
avocations&#44; and will not put faith in the words of their 
God&#44; who promises to bless their repose from bodily 
labour on the day devoted to his service. How many

employed&#59; and if our substance is great&#44; and our en&#8211; 
gagements extensive&#44; then we cannot spare the time&#44; 
we would be too great losers by an obedience to one 
of the Ten Commandments. So fruitful in inven&#8211; 
tions is our sinful propensity &#33; They therefore among 
us&#44; who place so high a value upon the world and its 
allurements&#44; will iind excuses enough to satisfy them&#8211; 
selves for their wrong&#8211;doing. But let them beware &#33; 
They deceive not by such miserable pretences the 
Searcher of hearts&#59; He will judge of their doings 
according to their merit&#59; and their neglecting his 
precepts&#44; their pretended unbelief of their necessity 
and usefulness will not screen them from responsi&#8211; 
bility. Yet men say&#44; that they see no evil in their 
conduct&#44; while they offend by omitting their duties 
at the recurrence of the appointed time&#59; while but 
rarely does some special occasion summon them to 
acts of worship&#44; to a presence in the house of pra3&#39;er&#59; 
while they are strangei&#8211;s so to say in the mansion of 
their Father&#44; and they will not receive&#44; they will not 
taste the food of life&#44; which He so abundantly&#44; so 
bountifully supplies. Religious wisdom is preached 
to them&#44; truth appeals to their understanding&#59; but 
they turn a deaf ear&#44; they will not listen. Is this 
the course of wisdom&#63; do you call that numbering 
your days &#63; The rather it seems to say&#44; that you 
think yourselves enduring&#44; immovable to eternity&#44; 
forgetful that you are but of yesterday&#44; and will 
speedily return to your native dust.

use of forbidden food&#44; in the revelling in benumbing

get that you live only through God&#39;s bounty&#59; but 
consider that what his law declares good and inno&#8211; 
cent is alone good and allowable&#59; there is nothing 
right which this law declares wrong&#44; there is nothing 
allowed which its precepts prohibit. 

In our possessions too we often offend. We are 
commanded to love our neighbour like ourselves &#59; 
and still we fail in obedience to this primary injunc&#8211; 
tion. We expect justice&#44; honesty&#44; and fair&#8211;dealing 
from others&#59; we blame them if they injure us&#59; we 
are wroth if our honest demands are not attended 
to&#44; if our just dues are withheld. But we do not re&#8211; 
gard others&#39; right in the same point of view &#59; we are 
overreaching&#44; cunning in our commerce with our fel&#8211; 
lows&#44; and apt to trample on their rights&#44; and to re&#8211; 
main deaf to their remonstrance. Self is uppermost&#44; 
neighbourly love and fellowship are disregarded. 
The demon of gain&#44; the unclean spirit of injustice 
reign triumphant in our souls&#59; and we will not heark&#8211; 
en to the poor when he suppliantly appeals to our 
bounty &#59; we will not do justice to the orphan&#44; the 
widow&#44; and the stranger&#44; because there is no one to 
plead in their behalf. And is this wisdom &#63; shall 
we number our days with deeds of avarice&#44; of cruelty 
of oppression&#44; of fraud&#44; of iniquity&#44; of injustice &#63; shall 
such be the works which are to open to us the gates 
of paradise&#63; 

In our spirit too. &#8212; How often does devotion yield

to a rebellious thonglit&#63; Do we not many a time 
arraign the justice of the Lord&#63; If any misfortune 
comes to our lot&#44; we imagine ourselves &#33;ll&#8211;used &#59; does 
not success attend all our plans&#44; we regard ourselves 
as overlooked by Providence. Then too are the sins 
of pride&#44; arrogance&#44; overbearing conduct to equals 
and inferiors&#44; disobedience to our parents and teach&#8211; 
ers&#44; avarice&#44; covetousness&#44; and the contempt of lawful 
authority &#58; all these prove that our soul is not un&#8211; 
tainted with the leaven of rebellion against the di&#8211; 
vine rule &#59; that we imagine ourselves raised above 
the level of mankind&#44; and that we claim a preroga&#8211; 
tive which is not justly ours&#44; and which has never 
been conceded to us by the Lord&#44; who alone can con&#8211; 
fer power on man. It is &#34;thus we transgress in our 
spirit &#59; because feelings like the above are prohibited 
in the law&#44; and are consequently sinfal&#44; and will bar 
for us the portals of salvation &#59; since sentiments of 
this nature are not only wrong in themselves&#44; but 
they prompt us likewise to actions which are in di&#8211; 
rect opposition to the precepts of Scripture. 

Bark indeed is the picture which the moralist must&#44; 
in deference to truth&#44; draw of the world before him. 
God has made every thing beautiful &#59; all things work 
for a wise end &#59; everywhere reigns order &#59; in all we 
discover the effect of design. But it is man alone 
who mars the harmony of nature &#59; it is he alone who 
rises in disobedience above the divine ordinances of 
the Bible&#44; who sets up his own conceits&#44; his own false 
notions above the truth that has endured for ages&#44; and 
will outlast this globe we live on. Our puerile con&#8211; 
ception of what we understand&#44; of what we pretend 
to call right and just&#44; we set above the divine wisdom

manifested in the Revelation on Sinai&#44; and we harden 
our heart&#44; we avert our eyes&#44; that we may not per&#8211; 
chance unknowingly&#39;&#8211; imbibe true knowledge. But&#44; 
brethren&#44; it is not well that this is so&#59; each of us&#44; 
every one here assembled&#44; has the means in his own 
power&#44; has the weapon in his own hands&#44; to combat 
the enemy to his everlasting peace. Let us but turn 
aside our presumption &#59; let us but turn a willing ear 
to the guidance of God &#59; let us but regard all men 
as equal&#44; ourselves as fallible and mortal&#59; search for 
wisdom in the law made known through Moses and 
the prophets&#59; be humble in spirit&#44; just in our deal&#8211; 
ings&#44; eager in the pursuit of truth&#44; firm in faith&#44; and 
righteous in our religious actions &#58; and we stand re&#8211; 
generated&#44; disenthralled&#44; we also will then form a 
beautiful link in the divine creation&#44; our body and 
our spirit will be holy to God&#44; our deeds and our 
thoughts witnessess of his goodness and glory. 

How grieved would you all be&#44; brethren and 
friends &#33; were you to be certain that you would be 
cut oif in the midst of your sins&#44; unprepared&#44; un&#8211;

say they &#58; &#34; We do not rebel&#44; we know God is merci&#8211;

Note. &#8212; In explanation of the account of the distressing catastro&#8211; 
phe introduced into the above Discourse&#44; I will briefly state that the 
steam&#8211;packet Home&#44; Captain White&#44; departed from New York for 
Charleston on&#44; I believe&#44; her second voyage&#44; on Sabbath afternoon 
the 7th of October&#44; 1837&#44; and after encountering the furious gale I

have attempted to describe&#44; went ashore near one of the capes in 
North Carolina some time in the evening of Monday the 9th&#44; being 
as I stated about the close of the Day of Atonement. Out of nineiy 
passengers twenty onlj&#8211; reached the shore&#59; among those lost were at 
least three Jewish females and one man belonging to our people&#44; 
and among those saved was but one Jewish gentleman&#44; who saw 
his brother swept off from the wreck without being able to render 
him the least assistance &#59; he yet survives &#40;5601&#41;&#44; and I obtained from 
him several of the particulars as I have related them. The crew 
consisted oi forty &#8211;five persons&#44; of whom but twenty were saved&#44; in&#8211; 
cluding the captain. &#8212; As this heart&#8211;rending occurrence was one of 
those great exhibitions of human weakness when contending against 
the agents of the Creator which we sometimes witness &#58; I thought 
myself justified in oflering it to the consideration of the brethren 
as an incentive to reflection upon the uncertainty of human life and 
the instability of our fancied security &#59; although I fear that it mav 
recall painful recollections in the minds of several who have cause 

to remember the friends that perished in the wreck of the Home. 

During the same storm another steam&#8211;ship was on its way from 
Philadelphia to Charleston. It too bore among its passengers a 
number of Israelites&#44; who beheld in their rescue from impendino&#8211; 
danger&#44; when the water had already penetrated at the cabin&#44; and 
was washing furiously over the deck&#44; the wonder of the Lord in 
the mighty deep. Altogether&#44; it was a fearful close of the great 
fast&#44; near Cape Hatteras&#44; one which few have ever experienced and 
escaped.

How then can the son of earth dare to ask&#44; &#34; What

Thou&#63;&#34; Yet despite our lowliness and thy awful

there unto them the commandments and statutes 
which Thou hadst ordained for our salvation. It was

Brethren &#33; 

On a day like this&#44; when we are assembled to thank 

<pb n="121"/>

THE REVELATION ON SINAI. 121 

the Lord at the time of our festivity for his mercy in 
giving us his laws and statutes&#44; it is well becoming 
in every son of Israel to dwell for a space upon the 
benefits resulting from the event which we celebrate. 
Were it&#44; that the Pentecost had been instituted to 
commemorate the slaughter of myriads of enemies&#44; 
the conquest of a thousand cities&#44; the subduing of nu&#8211; 
merous nations to our rule &#58; then indeed might there 
be many who would feel that they could not rejoice 
at our rejoicing&#44; who could experience grief onlj&#8211; at 
our success. But the Pentecost&#44; and in truth all our 
festivals&#44; stand alone in that from all other festivals &#59; 
we celebrate not the disruption of political communi&#8211; 
ties&#59; the origin of a sect &#59; the birth of an individual&#59; 
the conquest of our party and the downfall of our an&#8211; 
tagonists &#58; &#8212; no &#33; we celebrate the goodness of God&#44; 
we rejoice because of his salvation&#59; we return thanks 
for a people redeemed&#44; for a world regenerated &#33; Yes&#44; 
our fathers had been taken from the midst of an&#8211; 
other people&#44; their tyrants and oppressors&#59; they were 
tainted with many vices&#44; corrupted by the leaven of 
idolatry&#44; subdued by the superstition of priestcraft. 
Their bodies&#44; it is true&#44; had been withdrawn from the 
bondage of Egyptian taskmasters&#44; but their spirits 
were not yet disenthralled&#59; the flesh was free&#44; but 
the soul yet lingered under the most cruel slavery. 
In what were we then distinguished from other na&#8211; 
tions &#63; only in the merit of our patriarchal ancestors 
and the submission with which we had followed our 
God into the desert and through the waves of the 
Arabian Sea. We had proved that we could confide 
in the Lord &#59; we had shown that we were ready to 
receive the heavenly yoke&#44; the law&#44; which should

henceforward render us the servants only of Heaven&#44; 
controlled by and enslaved to no human power. And 
this alone had been the object of Providence in his 
sending Moses to ask of Pharaoh the liberation of 
the Israelites&#44; and this had been the reason why so 
many astounding miracles were performed to effect 
the demand made by the prophet&#44; in order to demon&#8211; 
strate to the satisfaction of all the overruling power 
and wisdom of the Lord. 

It is known to you that&#44; true to human nature&#44; 
Pharaoh would not listen to foreo&#58;o what he thousfht 
his rights to the services of the Israelites&#59; he hurled 
contempt at Moses and Aaron when they addressed 
him in the name of an unknown God &#59; he refused to 
regard the threats of the Everlasting One of whom 
his false priests had never spoken&#44; believing himself 
secure in the recesses of his palaces&#44; in the multitude 
of his retinue&#44; from the vengeance of a Deity of whose 
existence he professed to know nothing. He had 
been taught to regard his own will as supreme&#59; his 
priests spoke of a multitude of gods&#44; of antagonizing 
principles&#44; who shared the rule of the world &#59; creature 
and Creator were mixed up in his philosophy&#44; and 
the truth&#44; if any there was in his system&#44; was choked 
by the rank weeds of fable and human invention. In 
all his land the gigantic images of monstrous malfor&#8211; 
mations and of animals&#44; be they man&#44; quadruped&#44; 
bird&#44; amphibious or insect&#44; were adored&#44; as emblems&#44; 
if you will&#44; but still adored as images of deified things. 
A caste of priests&#44; selected and set apart from all the 
rest of the people&#44; had the custody of all the avenues 
of information and knowledge&#59; devices&#44; many and 
varied&#44; had been introduced&#44; fraud and trick resorted 

<pb n="123"/>

to&#44; to give stability to the opinions which they profess&#8211; 
ed&#44; and even from the burdens of the state had they 
been freed&#42; from time immemorial. Systems&#44; some&#8211; 
what different&#44; but nowise better&#44; had taken root in 
all other lands&#59; one nation worshipped stocks and 
stones&#59; another incarnations of their deities&#59; another 
the starry firmament&#44; the works of the Author of all&#59; 
another a spirit of good and a spirit of evil &#59; another 
yet&#44; the monstrous product of some mischievous brain&#44; 
on whose extended heated arms innocent children 
were by their parents roasted alive as acceptable sac&#8211; 
rifices&#44; yowhere then was a nation who called on 
the God who had appeared unto Abraham &#59; nowhere 
was there a people who adored the Creator and Ruler 
of all things. Do you therefore wonder that Pharaoh 
resisted the divine command &#63; It would have been 
incredible&#44; if the Scriptures had recorded that he had 
obeyed&#59; we might then have alleged that it is impos&#8211; 
sible to believe that the king of Egypt could have 
paid any regard to the injunctions of a Deity to whom 
neither he nor the surrounding nations paid any al&#8211; 
legiance. Yet&#44; it was necessary that in accordance 
with the promises made to Aln&#8211;aham the Israelites 
should not only be let go free&#44; but that all the other 
nations likewise should through them be blessed. 
It therefore did happen&#44; that God the Lord&#44; who had 
announced his being and his command&#44; did not suffer 
Pharaoh to remain long in ignorance of his power. 
He could&#44; if so lie had chosen&#44; have taken the Israel&#8211; 
ites out of Egypt without punishing the Egyptians 
and without any delay&#59; for&#44; to suppose otherwise 

&#42; See Genesis xlvii. 22.

would be limiting llie power of Ilim who is the Su 
preme. But if this procedure had been adopted&#44; 
there would necessarily have been but little instruc&#8211; 
tion afforded both to Israelites and Egyptians&#59; for 
the first would only have seen in their liberation an 
act of extraordinary goodness of some unknown in&#8211; 
visible Power&#44; who though kind and powerful might 
be indifferent about obedience and submission to his 
will&#59; and the latter would have regarded it doubt&#8211; 
less as a display of a great superiority over the civil 
authority of their land&#44; but still might have been left 
in doubt whether the new Deity had any absolute su&#8211; 
periority in a long contest over their acknowledged 
divinities. But the Lord wished to instruct&#44; to chas&#8211; 
tise&#44; to correct&#44; to enlighten&#59; lie wanted not merely 
to redeem the Israelites according to his promise&#44; but 
to prove also to them and their masters&#44; that there 
exists One of unending goodness&#44; of infinite power&#44; 
to whom all must yield obedience&#59; that lie is not 
only good&#44; but also watchful over the affairs of man&#59; 
not alone beneficent&#44; but likewise heeding of justice&#44; 
even&#8211;handed justice&#44; and that retribution is a part of 
his economy no less than it accords with his upright&#8211; 
ness to reward and to favour the good &#59; and lastly&#44; 
that his might is Jiot merely the display of a momen&#8211; 
tary superiority over civil rulers&#44; but that it extends 
over all that exists&#44; over all that can have being&#59; that 
there is no material thing&#44; no spiritual being&#44; that is 
not subject to his control&#44; destructible at his bidding. 
Heathens&#44; the most enlightened even&#44; imagined 
that there existed local deities&#44; tutelary powers&#44; over 
certain places and countries&#44; independent of each 
other&#44; and not seldom engaged&#44; mortal&#8211;like&#44; in a con&#8211; 

<pb n="125"/>

flict for the superiority. Were it necessary it won Id 
be easy enough to produce innumerable instances 
from profane history as well as Scripture to prove 
this fact&#59; but independentlj&#39; of its leading us too far 
into historical researches&#44; the house of God is not the 
place to open such a discussion&#59; for the subject is con&#8211; 
nected with too many immoralities&#44; and exhibits too 
glaringly the degraded state of human reason when 
unassisted by divine wisdom&#44; not to give&#44; when viewed 
at large&#44; more disgust than instruction. Enough&#44; 
that heathens regarded the earth&#44; the sky&#44; the sea&#44; the 
infernal regions&#44; the sun&#44; every separate planet&#44; as be&#8211; 
ings capable of working their pleasure under the sole 
limitation of some chief among them&#44; and subject to 
the decrees of an inevitable fate&#44; whatever this might 
BE. If therefore any event occurred&#44; it was easy 
enough for the priests of falsehood to ascribe the 
cause to the temporary prevalence of some one or 
more of their numerous tutelary objects of worship. 
Moreover the idolaters of the olden days never ob&#8211; 
jected to accept a new deity among and in addition 
to their long catalogue&#44; provided&#44; they could be made 
to believe that the new claimant of adoration possessed 
some power for good or evil. They did not perhaps 
change their former gods&#44; but they certainly admitted 
the power and dignity of the new claimants that were 
offered to them. A remarkable instance of this fal&#8211; 
lacy &#40;where a special and local power was admitted&#41; 
is found in the twentieth chapter of the first book of 
Kings. Ben&#8211;hadad&#44; king of Syria&#44; had made an at&#8211; 
tack upon Samaria&#44; the capital of Ahab&#44; the sinful 
king of Israel. Unexpectedly both to Ahab and Ben&#8211; 
hadad the latter was signally defeated in a sortie made 

11&#42;

by a small number of devoted young men&#44; by direc&#8211; 
tion of a prophet&#44; in order to convince the unworthy 
chief of God&#39;s people&#44; that it is only by the assistance 
of the Lord that the affairs of man are directed. 
Ben&#8211;hadad&#39;s servants were likewise convinced that&#44; 
in agreement with facts recorded in history&#44; it had 
pleased the Lord to grant victory to the arms of Israel&#44; 
though they were at that time deeply sunk into idola&#8211; 
try. But whilst they admitted the power of Israel&#39;s 
God&#44; they fancied that it was not universal&#59; and they 
therefore spoke to their master&#58; &#34; Their gods are gods 
of the hills&#44; therefore they were stronger than we&#59; 
but let us fight against them in the plains&#44; and surely 
we shall be stronger than they.&#34; They accordingly 
persuaded the king of Syria to renew his attack&#44; but 
to select a plain for his battle&#8211;ground&#44; hoping thereby 
to prevail through the power of their gods of the plain 
over the mountain&#8211;gods of Israel. We now read in 
continuation &#58; &#34; And there came a man of God&#44; and 
spoke unto the king of Israel&#44; and said&#44; Thus saith 
the Lord&#44; Because the Syrians have said. The Lord 
is God of the hills&#44; but lie is not God of the valleys&#44; 
therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into 
thy hands&#44; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.&#34; 
Of course the prediction was fulfilled&#44; and the slaugh&#8211; 
tered thousands testified that the power of our God 
is not limited by&#44; nor confined&#44; to any place or sta&#8211; 
tion. &#8212; It would be easy to extend these observations&#44; 
and furnish you innumerable specimens from profane 
books&#59; but it is needless for our purpose&#59; for the sub&#8211; 
ject is not new to you&#44; and all that was intended to 
be proved is&#44; that lieathcnism in its greatest perfec&#8211; 
tion&#44; in ancient times as well as in the more modern

had always about the same idea of the ability of God 
to effect his purposes&#44; &#8212; that is to say&#44; the idolaters 
divided the authoi&#39;ity&#44; which the Scriptures teach us 
to ascribe to the Omnipoteut alone&#44; among the various 
and independent individuals which figure in their so&#8211; 
called mythology. 

As it was now the intention of God to erect the de 
scendauts of Israel into a people holy to his services&#44; 
it was but proper to imbue their minds at the out&#8211; 
set with convincing proofs of his omnipotence. He 
therefore did not merely effect their liberation by a 
solitary exhibition of superior power&#44; which as we 
have said it was possible for Him to do&#59; but He per&#8211; 
mitted the stubbornness of Pharaoh to yield by de&#8211; 
grees only to the conviction which was wrought 
gradually through the exhibition of deeds&#44; which 
showed beyond iLe possibility of doubt the utter in&#8211; 
significance of all the gods of Egypt to do the least 
in warding off&#44; or staying&#44; or diminishing any of the 
inflictions which it pleased God to send. The river 
rolled seaward in one bloody stream&#44; the fishes it 
harboured were thrown dead upon the pestilential 
shore&#59; but the healthy flood only returned upon the 
bidding of the Lord. Frogs in disgusting swarms 
insinuated themselves everywhere&#59; but they quitted 
the afilicted land only when the prophet praved to 
God to spare his treacherous enemies. Noxious in&#8211; 
sects and savage beasts desolated the plains of the 
sons of Ham &#59; a pestilence swept off the cattle of the 
Egyptians&#44; whilst of Israel&#39;s not one died&#59; terrible 
blains infected the bodies of the priests even&#59; hail in 
destructive masses desolated the fields&#44; locusts de&#8211; 
voured what the hail had spared&#59; and still it was only

the prophet&#39;s supplication that afforded enlargement. 
At bright daylight too the sun was darkened&#59; for 
three days impenetrable gloom rested on the dwell&#8211; 
ings of the Egyptians&#59; and still no power save the 
Lord&#39;s granted relief. And lastly the terrible slaugh&#8211; 
ter of the iirst&#8211;born and the demolition by invisible 
hands of the statues of idols told in language not to 
be misunderstood&#44; that to our God alone belongeth 
the kingdom&#44; and that his rule extendeth over all. 
The whole display of these miraculous events must 
therefore have impressed upon the minds of Israelites 
as well as of Egyptians&#44; that the Power which set 
Israel free is a universal Power&#44; a Deity not only of 
mountains&#44; bat also of valleys&#59; not a God merely of 
liglit&#44; but also the God of darkness&#59; not alone the 
Dispenser of life&#44; but also the Dispenser of death&#59; in 
short the universal God&#44; the sole Creator&#44; the only 
Ruler&#33; &#8212; And so we read &#40;Exodus ix. 15&#44; 16&#41;&#58; &#34;For 
if I had desired I could have stretched out my hand&#44; 
and smitten thee and thy people with the pestilence&#44; 
and thou wouldst have been cut ofl&#34; from the earth. 
But for this cause did I suffer thee to remain&#44; in order 
to show thee my power&#44; and in order to declare my 
name throughout all the earth&#44;&#34; We therefore see&#44; 
that the lessons in obedience to the divine command 
conveyed to him by Moses which Pharaoh received 
Avere the only natural way&#44; though the means em&#8211; 
ployed were miraculous&#44; to force conviction upon his 
obdurate heart&#59; and these means produced at length 
the effect which the Lord had in view&#44; and the Israel&#8211; 
ites were driven forth from Egypt to meet their des&#8211; 
tinies in the desert of Arabia. 

Let us consider&#58; If Pharaoh had in this manner 

<pb n="129"/>

THE REVELATION ON SINAI. 129 

been instructed and tangbt how great&#44;Jiow irresisti&#8211; 
ble God is&#44; the same lesson must naturally have been 
impressed upon bis own people and the Israelites 
also&#59; for the former had shared the punishment of 
their king&#44; and the latter bad been those in whose 
behalf all these great and fearful things had been 
done. &#8212; With this knowledge the Israelites arrived at 
the shore of the Red Sea. But still their confidence 
was not completely established &#59; they were terrified 
because of the horsemen and chariots of their pur&#8211; 
suers&#44; and they deplored that they had not remained 
the willing slaves of the Egyptians. These too had 
speedily forgotten their sufferings no less than the 
others their deliverance. Again therefore a mighty 
deed was done &#59; the waters divided&#44; being piled up 
like walls by the storm&#8211;wind of the Lord &#58; Jacob&#39;s 
sons passed through on dry land&#44; and they who threat&#8211; 
ened to enslave them again to hopeless servitude were 
overturned amid the returning billows. Fainthearted&#8211; 
ness then fled&#44; when the shore was strewn with the 
bodies of the horse and his rider&#44; &#34; and the people 
feared the Lord&#44; and they trusted in the Lord and in 
his servant Moses.&#34; 

All this mighty work of God had well prepared 
the Israelites to acknowledge Him the Lord as their 
Sovereign &#59; for to Him alone were they indebted&#44; al&#8211; 
most despite of themselves&#44; for their freedom&#44; for 
their glorious liberty&#44; which now cheered them on. 
They might now speak how for their sakes great 
deeds had been done&#44; how their trusty leader had 
exhibited a power which humbled a great king&#44; and 
brought a whole people to repentance. An insidious 
enemy too&#44; who had surprised them with his armed 

<pb n="130"/>

bands&#44; had been signally overcome by the blessed 
prowess of the young disciple of Moses. Farther&#44; 
when they asked for bread&#44; it was bounteously show&#8211; 
ered down to them without requiring of them plough&#8211; 
ing or reaping&#59; and when water was needed&#44; in a 
land sterile and dry&#44; the flinty rock yielded the re&#8211; 
freshing element. After all these things had been ac&#8211; 
complished&#44; when every day almost had given them 
new inducements for thankfulness and admiration &#58; 
our ancestors were brought to the foot of Horeb&#44; 
where&#44; as had been foretold&#44; they should be taught 
how to serve their God. And now continues the text 
&#40;Exodus xix.&#41; as follows &#58; &#34; And Aloses went up unto 
God&#44; and the Lord called unto him from the moun&#8211; 
tain&#44; saying. Thus shalt thou say to the house of Ja&#8211; 
cob&#44; and tell the children of Israel&#44; Ye have seen what 
I have done unto the Egyptians&#44; and how I bore you 
on eagles&#39; wings&#44; and brought you unto myself&#44; Now&#44; 
therefore&#44; if ye will obey my voice&#44; and keep my cov&#8211; 
enant&#44; then shall ye be unto me a peculiar treasure 
above all nations &#59; for all the earth is mine &#59; and ye 
shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy na&#8211; 
tion. These are the words which thou shalt speak 
unto the children of Israel.&#34; Here are clearly stated 
the reasons of the redemption and the terms of the 
covenant. Says the text&#44; &#34; Ye have seen what I have 
done unto the Egyptians.&#34; You yourselves were wit&#8211; 
nesses of my power&#59; it is not upon hearsay you are 
to acknowledge my omnipotence &#8212; it is not a doubt&#8211; 
ful authority which you are to regard&#59; for you&#44; in 
your own persons&#44; were the recipients of the bounty&#44; 
witnesses of the glory of your God&#44; that you might 

<pb n="131"/>

know that I&#44; even I alone&#44; am the Being who cast 
down and exalt&#44; the sole Almighty&#44; to whom all must 
submit. You also experienced my protection after 
you had quitted the land of your servitude. You were 
surrounded by dangers&#44; before you the sea&#44; behind 
you the vengeful host of the pursuing tyrant&#59; again 
Amalek attacked you&#44; when you thought only of pur&#8211; 
suing in quiet your way &#59; but you were borne aloft&#44; 
clear of all obstruction&#44; by your God and Saviour&#59; 
like the eagle&#44; who soaring in his flight above the 
whole feathered tribe&#44; bears away her young to a place 
of safety&#44; interposing her own body to the dart of the 
fowler&#58; thus were you shielded&#44; protected&#44; and saved. 
But if you ask&#44; &#34;Why was this done&#63;&#34; then know&#44; 
that to your ancestors I had sworn that I would re&#8211; 
deem you when the time of your wandering had 
expired&#44; to raise you up to be my people. It is for 
the fulfllment of this promise that I bared my arm 
against your oppressors&#59; that I smote them with many 
plagues &#59; that I humbled the pride of idolaters &#59; that 
I proved the helplessness of the idols they worship&#44; 
in order to teach you to regard me alone as your 
God&#44; who alone am holy&#44; who alone am able to save. 
It is now at your own option to merit my blessing&#44; 
by this&#44; that you rigidly obey the commandments 
which I am about to offer to your acceptance&#44; and to do 
on your part all that your God can ask of you as the 
people who have entered into a covenant with Ilim&#44; 
to do his behests for the protection which will be 
vouchsafed to you. It is not any benefit for myself 
which I ask &#59; for all the earth is mine &#59; you cannot 
benefit me&#59; your virtue&#44; your righteousness cannot

render my happiness and my perfection more com&#8211; 
plete than they now are&#59; but all the good which is to 
result is to revert to yourselves&#59; you shall be a treas&#8211; 
ure more than all the nations of the earth&#59; more fa&#8211; 
voured&#44; more instructed&#44; more holy&#44; more beloved&#44; 
but also more watched&#44; more accountable for all your 
doings&#44; because having more light and being nearer 
to me&#44; you must expect to receive retribution when&#8211; 
ever you merit it. Says the verse&#44; &#34; For all the earth 
is mine.&#34; I have reared you under trouble and trib&#8211; 
ulation to know that I am the Lord&#44; capable to do all 
that my will desires&#59; you have learnt this lesson more 
than any other people &#59; therefore in my wisdom do I 
now appoint j&#39;ou&#44; if you are willing&#44; to receive my 
law&#44; my covenant&#44; which you are to keep sacred and 
untouched&#44; as your birthright&#44; your inheritance&#44; as 
men of the house of Israel&#44; and which will at length 
be THE blessing to all the earth&#44; which I announced 
to 3&#39;our fathers. 

Thus spoke the Lord of Hosts. Moses descended 
from the mount and announced the word with which 
he had been charged. It is possible&#44; nay probable&#44; 
that the people had all along believed that they were 
merely to offer sacrifices&#44; after the manner of their 
ancestors&#44; to the Lord after their deliverance&#59; but 
they could hardly have known that a new dispensa&#8211; 
tion was to be intrusted to their safekeeping. How 
great&#44; therefore&#44; must have been their joy when their 
high destiny was announced to them&#44; and with bow 
much willingness must they have answered&#58; &#34;All 
that the Lord hath spoken we will do.&#34; The Father 
of all received in favour the reply with which the 
prophet was charged&#44; and He spoke as follows&#58; 

<pb n="133"/>

THE REVELATION ON SINAI. 133 

&#34;Behold I will come unto thee in a thick cloud&#44; for the sake 
that the people may hear when I speak with thee&#44; and that also in 
thee they shall believe for ever.&#34; Exodus xix. 9. 

The people having signified their readiness to be&#8211; 
come the servants of the Lord&#44; He informed Moses&#44; 
that the legislation should be public&#44; that the whole 
entire nation should be the witnesses of their spir&#8211; 
itual as they had been of their bodily disenthralment&#59; 
so that not one should have occasion to tell the other 
what are the doctrines of salvation. Another reason 
for this procedure should be the attestation of the 
truth of Moses&#44; who had been the instrument of their 
redemption. God intended to crown him publicly 
with the attribute of faithfulness&#44; to impress upon all 
that he was a righteous servant&#44; and to insure that 
whatever he might hereafter be deputed to teach 
should be received by his brothers as the truth re&#8211; 
ceived from God. 

The third day after this annunciation the people 
were aroused by the loud voice of thunder&#59; fires 
flashed from amidst the deepest gloom&#44; the earth 
shook&#44; the mountain trembled&#44; the Israelites were 
awestruck&#44; and he alone who was called &#34; faithful in 
all God&#39;s house&#44;&#34; was calm and intent on the issue 
of his mission. He led forth the people to meet their 
God&#44; and in silent expectation they stood at the foot 
of Sinai. Soon a voice resounded&#44; a voice unlike that 
of a mortal &#59; it penetrated to every ear&#44; it struck to 
every heart&#44; it moved every spirit. All the people

heard&#44; remember this&#44; that more than two millions 
of human beings heard at the same moment in an 
audible manner the selfsame voice&#59; there was con&#8211; 
sequently no room for doubt or uncertainty&#44; for all 
was made manifest&#44; perceptible&#44; and clear&#59; and the 
voice which then spoke still reechoes again and again 
to this very day. Truths&#44; never before so comprehen&#8211; 
sively given&#44; were surrendered&#44; so to say&#44; from the 
treasury of Heaven to the custody of the Israelites&#44; 
and well was the custodian chosen. What revolutions 
have passed over our heads &#33; how much misery has 
fallen to our lot &#33; what persecutions had we to endure &#33; 
but still the covenant is ours&#44; its words are dear to 
our hearts&#44; its precepts find a response in our bosoms. 
Do I exaggerate &#63; where is the Israelite&#44; who deserves 
the name&#44; but is willing to suffer for the glorious in&#8211; 
heritance which is his &#63; where is the son of Jacob&#44; 
who is so in truth&#44; but calls the law of God his great&#8211; 
est treasure &#63; Men may call us enthusiasts for saying 
this&#59; but who can be otherwise than an enthusiast 
when the contemplation of the great blessing of our 
religion is presented to his mind &#63; It is more than 
our native land&#59; it is more than our earthly parents&#59; 
it is the bond of union which unites us to our ever&#8211; 
lasting home&#44; which binds the humble creature to the 
infinite Creator&#33; to the everliving Father&#33; 

&#39;Now mark&#44; brothers and sisters of the house of 
Israel&#44; who are here to&#8211;day to celebrate this great 
event&#44; how well the prediction has been fulfilled. It 
is to&#8211;day more than thirty&#8211;two hundred years ago 
since the promulgation of the law. A hundred gen&#8211; 
erations and more have been gathered to their fathers 
since the fire of glory blazed on Mount Sinai. There

credible tliat any son of Jacob can be so forgetful of 
what is the source of his salvation. But be the apos&#8211; 
tates ever so many&#44; be their motives fear&#44; interest&#44; 
ambition&#44; or unbelief&#58; of this we are assured&#44; that 
the law nnll never be forgotten&#44; that that time will 
never be&#44; when the ma.ss of our people will cease to 
regard Moses as the prophet of God&#44; and to believe 
in the truth of his mission &#59; for the word wliich has 
endured unscathed so many vicissitudes is yet en&#8211; 
dowed with life&#44; and exists this day in its original 
vigour and beauty. 

But shall it be said that&#44; as we advance in civiliza&#8211; 
tion and are more favoured with liberty&#44; we are be&#8211; 
coming inditierent to this blessing&#63; shall the reproach 
be cast on us&#44; that we cannot be intrusted with civil 
freedom without losing our character as Jews &#63; The 
foul charge has been made &#59; and they who wish to an&#8211; 
nihilate our people&#44; have at times counselled to place 
us on a political equality&#44; in order to consume us 
by a gradual admixture with foreign nations. They 
aver&#44; that the enjo3auent of the same rights which all 
other inhabitants of the various countries have would 
render us careless of our distinctive character&#44; and 
that we would then be willing to yield to flattery what 
no force could ever tear from us. Let me appeal to 
you&#44; friends and brothers &#33; to contradict such an as&#8211; 
persion by your conduct. In this land you enjoy the 
largest personal liberty&#59; you are equal with other 
citizens&#59; no one can lay any hinderance in your way 
on account of your religion&#44; no one can molest you 
for your belief in one God. It is therefore lamenta&#8211; 
ble that one is compelled to confess&#44; that we do l&#41;ut 
little to merit the continuance of so much happiness.

Alas&#33; that religion should be so iniicli neglected&#33; &#8212; 
When troubles thickened around us&#44; we did call on 
our God for enlargement&#59; and now&#44; when we need 
no longer fear the adversary&#39;s sword&#44; we have become 
careless. This is not well&#44; brethren &#33; it is time that 
this stain should be wiped from our name. There 
are signs already visible&#44; that in this country too 
there is increasing a thirst after the word of the Lord &#59; 
that persons daily become more alive to the necessity 
of drinking the waters which lead unto salvation. Let 
us hope that the signs may not be fallacious&#44; and that 
daily some one may abjure the sinfulness of his ways&#44; 
and become a sincere follower of&#44; no less than a be&#8211; 
liever in the truth of the Decalogue. It is the prov&#8211; 
ince of each of you to contribute to this result by 
acting rightly yourselves&#44; and inducing others to do 
the same. Every son of Lsrael is called upon to be 
a teacher of the truth&#59; every daughter of Jacob 
should spread the word. But above all it is the 
bounden duty of parents to see that wholesome re&#8211; 
ligious instruction be liberally and daily bestowed on 
their oii&#39;spring&#59; for knowledge like this outweighs 
far the acquisition of mere worldly sciences. &#8212; Let 
also your visits to the house of God be constant&#44; lay 
aside your avocations to attend divine worship&#44; bring 
your children with you&#44; let them see that you are in 
earnest&#44; and teach them by precept and example &#58; 
and you will prove to the world that we Jews can 
hold fast to our law&#44; whilst we join our brothers of 
other opinions in the discharge of duties as citizens 
of one common country. If thus you act&#44; then will 
every returning Pentecost enjoyed in this land of 
liberty be indeed a day of thankfulness unto the Lord

O Lord of all flesh &#33; who art of infinite power and 
wisdom&#44; hear our prayer this day&#44; and plant in our 
hearts brotherly love and union &#59; remove from our 
midst causeless hatred and dissension&#44; and grant that 
all this congregation and all Israel thy people may 
be a band of brothers&#44; united in taith&#44; united in love&#44; 
made one by charity. Strengthen the superintend&#8211; 
ents of this house&#44; let their doings be guided by the 
spirit of wisdom and conciliation &#59; multiply the wor&#8211; 
shippers within these walls dedicated to thy service&#44; 
and frustrate the devices of those who may now or 
hereafter endeavour to sow dissension where there 
should reign love&#44; union&#44; and harmony. Do grant&#44; 
O our Father &#33; that thy holy name may be glorified 
through our teaching and our humble striving&#59; and 
pour out thy liberal spirit over us all&#44; that we may

truly know how to worship&#44; how to reverence&#44; how 
to follow Thee in thy deeds of mercy. May this be 
thy will. Amen. 

Brethren. 

In all human labours&#44; be they works of a spiritual 
or temporal nature&#44; we will speedily discover&#44; that by 
our own unassisted striving&#44; we are able to accom&#8211; 
plish very little indeed. In the smallest effort we 
make&#44; in the smallest implement we handle we are&#44; 
although unconscious perhaps&#44; indebted to the united 
labours of many sentient beings like ourselves acting 
to accomplish a given purpose&#44; &#8212; The bread we eat&#44; 
is this the product of one individual&#63; No &#33; there was 
the ploughman to open the soil by the labour of his 
hardy hands&#44; amidst the sweat of his brow &#59; there 
was the seedman&#44; who scattered the seed into the 
furrows which had been drawn over the yielding soil&#59; 
there was next the reaper&#44; who under the glowing 
rays of a midday sun cut down the rich blessings of 
the Lord &#59; next the thrasher&#44; then the winnower&#44; then 
the miller&#44; and lastly the baker&#44; who all had to unite 
their efforts to produce this simple bread&#44; our daily 
food. Now take a view of the tools which these 
various labourers use &#33; They are the products of the 
mine&#44; the forest&#44; and the forge. Into the dark bowels 
of the earth&#44; guided by science and skill&#44; the laborious 
miner digs his way &#59; unerring tests tell him where is 
the home of the iron &#59; the ore is brought up to the 
light of day&#44; whilst yet the future metal is encumbered 
with uncongenial substances. Another equally skil&#8211; 
ful&#44; and even more daring&#44; perchance ventures under 
the bed of the sea and extracts the fossil coal with

which they smelt tlie iron. Xext the swarthy forge&#8211; 
men pile up in the intensely heated furnace the ore 
and the fuel&#44; and speedily urged by the blast of the 
mighty bellows the liquefied metal flows in a fiery 
stream. Now behold the rolling&#8211;mill smoothing a 
bar of one of the hardest products in nature&#44; as if it 
were flexible as the dough under the hands of the in&#8211; 
dustrious housewife. Again see the smith at his forge&#44; 
his brawny arm wields high in air the ponderous 
hammer&#44; and soon the ploughshare is presented to 
view. The forester also lends his aid&#59; the hundred&#8211; 
armed oak totJters&#44; falls&#59; the artisan shapes the plough&#59; 
and the farmer harnesses to it the laborious ox or the 
sinewy plough&#8211;horse&#44; and rejoicingly he commences 
his task of tilling the earth. The builder also is 
needed &#33; By the margin of some rapid brook with 
busy skill the foundation is laid &#59; stone after stone is

resting&#8211;place&#59; the masons ply their trowels&#44; and the 
carpenters their tools&#44; and the mill stands finished be&#8211; 
fore 3&#39;ou. The millwright&#39;s services are now needed &#59; 
the machinery is duly disposed&#44; the race is properly 
arranged&#44; and the wheel is fixed in the outer wall &#59; 
and soon the wagons laden with the produce of the 
farmer&#39;s industry feed the voracity of the mighty en&#8211; 
gine which so many skilful&#44; busy hands have erected&#44; 
and the stunning din tells not of danger&#44; of the battle&#8211; 
alarm&#44; of the destruction of human life&#44; but of the 
production of the most nutritious food provided by 
Providence for our sustenance. These briefly are 
some of the labours which many have to undergo&#44; in 
order to supply the household with a common daily 
necessary of life &#59; and the smallest morsel even which

enters iu your consumption is watered by the sweat 
of hundreds&#44; labouring to accomplish one particular 
end. 

This one illustration serves for all other employ&#8211; 
ments&#59; and we may say in truth that man&#44; when 
alone&#44; is absolutely helpless&#44; and more unprovided for 
than any other animal&#44; from the largest to the small&#8211; 
est&#44; since each of these can obtain its food without the 
multiplicity of labours which falls to the lot of man. 
But were the farmer to sit down in despair and say&#58; 
&#34; How shall I be able to procure iron ore&#44; smelt it&#44; 
forge it into a ploughshare&#63; how can I cut down the 
tree alone and make myself a plough &#63; what shall I 
do&#63; I shall never be able to till my field&#58;&#34; what 
would any rational man tell him &#63; surely&#44; that he 
should avail himself of the labour of others&#44; procure 
the plough which he can find ready made to his hands&#44; 
although so many preparatory labours were necessary&#44; 
and just do nothing more than that part of the work 
which is allotted to him&#44; that is&#44; the mere act of open&#8211; 
ing the soil&#44; which he is amply able to do by the as&#8211; 
sistance of the beasts of burden which the Creator 
has assigned for the service of man. Any one would 
therefore be reckoned unwise&#44; who would refuse do&#8211; 
ing any thing&#44; because he could not accomplish every 
thing&#59; for it is only by every man&#39;s doing his share 
for the general good&#44; that the welfare of every indi&#8211; 
vidual is best promoted. 

But&#44; brethren&#44; the same holds good not only in the 
physical&#44; but also in the moral world. Many are the 
wants of the mind &#59; multifarious are the duties which 
are demanded of us &#58; and yet they must all be satis&#8211; 
fied&#44; if we wish to be happy. Look at the infant

when it first essays its gift of speech &#59; watch its pain&#8211; 
ful efforts at utterance&#44; and behold over it bending 
the fond mother seconding the trials which her off&#8211; 
spring makes to produce articulate sounds&#58; behold 
her joy when it succeeds in imitating the words &#34;My 
father&#33; my mother&#33;&#34; and think you not that a great 
labour has been accomplished&#63; that a trial steadily re&#8211; 
peated for weeks&#44; for days&#44; for hours together has at 
length been crowned by signal success&#63; Assuredly&#44; 
and you can convince yourselves of this at the return 
of the father from his toil to his now happier home&#44; 
when his wife makes the child again repeat the lesson 
which she has been teaching&#44; and the fond kiss im&#8211; 
pressed upon the cheek yet unclouded by sin or sor&#8211; 
row tells that he too thinks one task has been happily 
accomplished &#33; 

Months roll on&#44; and the little prattler has received 
from his mother all the instruction she can give him &#58; 
she has watched with unremitting care&#44; and instilled 
in him the seeds of the fear of the Lord&#59; she has 
taught him to reverence the Holy One&#44; who alone 
is Israel&#39;s God &#59; she has&#44; so to say&#44; opened the men&#8211; 
tal soil for more extended fruitfuluess &#59; and the boy 
is dismissed from the parental roof to the halls of 
learning&#44; to receive farther instruction in knowledge 
and wisdom. Daily new light dawns upon him&#44; 
hourly some new fact charms his mental vision&#44; and 
every instant he adds to his stock of knowledge. 
Does he weigh the toil of the teachers&#44; the care of 
his instructors &#63; Hardly&#59; he drinks from the foun&#8211; 
tain which to him seems ever&#8211;flowing&#44; and he barely 
is conscious that it flows wholesomely only through 
the care of those who are appointed its guardians&#44;

and who instruct him how he is to distiiignish be&#8211; 
tween the springs of life and happiness&#44; and those 
which are charged with death and wo. 

The school&#8211;years at length are ended&#44; and the 
youth enters upon the broad road of life&#44; mingling 
with the crowd&#44; jostled by the competitors who with 
him run to reach to the same goal. He now gathers 
knowledge from experience &#59; he has to unlearn much 
of self&#8211;love&#44; much of what inexperienced vanity had 
taught him to think of himself&#59; he sees things with 
a dilferent eye&#44; he feels wHth a different feeling&#44; he 
hears with a ditierent ear&#44; and the sweets and the 
bitters of manhood&#39;s years force upon him convic&#8211; 
tions which&#44; if properly viewed and piously dwelt 
upon&#44; will make his declining years happy&#44; peaceful&#44; 
and contented. 

Were now the mother to give up her endeavours 
at teaching her child to speak&#44; because she did not 
succeed at the first trial &#59; were a teacher to dismiss 
the scholar because he found it difficult to make him 
comprehend his lesson when he made his first at&#8211; 
tempt&#59; were the man to become alarmed at the great 
field of knowledge before him&#44; at the immense amount 
of learning which he must leave unexplored though 
he should live ever so long &#58; how could the most emi&#8211; 
nent of men ever have obtained the smallest part of 
knowledge&#63; since it is only the constant and perse&#8211; 
vering labour of the individual&#44; aided by the advice&#44; 
the tuition&#44; and the care of others&#44; in fact&#44; by a united 
efibrt of many persons&#44; scattered over a long space 
of time&#44; directed to accomplish one common purpose&#44; 
that the eminence on which he stands has been 
reached &#59; and it is only by perseverance&#44; union&#44; care

and labour that he can hope to mauitain the position 
he has once attained. 

This being so&#44; it may be well to inquire&#44; how we 
are to do in moral pursuits&#63; what share of excellence 
can we and others justly demand of ourselves&#63; To 
enable us to give a satisfactory answer we will con&#8211; 
sider the following advice&#44; contained in the last para&#8211; 
graph of the second chapter of the Proverbs of the 
Fathers&#44; a collection of moral aphorisms from those 
wise men who were the chief teachers of our religion 
during the latter portion of the second temple and 
the Urst century after its destruction&#44; a class of men&#44; 
who though often reviled by the ignorant and the 
enemies of our faith&#44; were worthy pillars on which 
the structure of Israel&#39;s religion could rest with safety&#44; 
trusty shepherds who guarded well the flock commit&#8211; 
ted to their care. &#8212; Among other matters Rabbi Tar&#8211; 
fone says &#58; 

&#34; It is not incumbent on thee to finish the work&#44; nor art thou at 
liberty to divest thyself entirely of its performance.&#34; 

When a man surveys the wide field of the duties 
pointed out to him by the law&#44; when he is made con&#8211; 
scious that all the precepts of the Bible are alike the 
word and will of God &#58; he is but too apt to become 
fainthearted and inquire&#44; &#34; How can I do all that 
I am told is good &#63; I am poor&#44; and I cannot give 
charity &#59; I am ignorant&#44; I cannot teach &#59; I am feeble&#44; 
I cannot attend the house of God&#44; afn not able to

fear there is no salvation for me&#44; since it is said in 
the Scriptures &#58; &#39; Cursed be he that fulfiUeth not the 
words of this law to do them.&#39;&#42; Will the Lord have 
mercy on one who is compelled to be so remiss of pos&#8211; 
itive duties&#63;&#34; To one so conscientious the mora&#8211; 
list says&#58; &#34;It is not incumbent on thee to finish the 
work&#59;&#34; the field of labour is in truth extended&#44; it 
spreads over all the actions and pursuits of life &#59; but 
thou art not the only labourer in the service of thy 
Maker. If it pleased Him not to endow thee with 
wealth&#44; He will most assuredly not be angry with 
thee&#44; if thou canst not gratify the wishes of thy heart 
by bestowing liberal gifts upon the poor that are 
with thee &#59; if thou are not versed in his holy ways&#44; 
if from want of opportunity thou hast unfortunately 
not received an extensive knowledge in the law of 
thy God&#44; He will not expect of thee to go abroad as 
a teacher of the word&#59; if thou art enfeebled by age 
or sickness&#44; and thy feet will not carry thee to the 
house of prayer&#44; thou wilt not be punished if thou 
stayest at home and ofl&#39;erest up the breathings of thy 
heart at thy own fireside&#44; if thou within thy own walls 
thinkest over the wonders which thy eyes behold&#44; 
which thy every sense makes thee conscious of&#59; if 
thou in truth art disabled to administer to those who 
need thy aid&#44; it is not consonant with Mercy to pun&#8211; 
ish the omission which proceeds not from a wilful 
neglect. In short&#44; no more than thy powers suffice 
for will be expected&#44; and no want of means will be 
regarded as a rebellion in the service of Heaven &#33; 
His servants are everywhere &#59; from the rising of the

sun to his setting&#44; His name is great among the na&#8211; 
tions &#59; and each and every man has received some 
capacity&#39; by which he can demonstrate his faithful&#8211; 
ness. The law contains many minute duties as well 
as great actions&#59; it enjoins the saving of a human 
life&#44;&#42; and the dismissal of the dam when the nest 
of a bird is found &#59;&#8224; it commands the restoration of 
freedom to the bondman in the seventh year&#8225; and 
the Jubilee&#44; &#167; and the fixing of a scroll on our door&#8211; 
posts&#124;&#124; and the wearing of fringes on the borders of 
our garments&#44;&#182; matters&#44; as we see&#44; of difficult execu&#8211; 
tion and rare occurrence&#44; and others wdiich any child 
can easily and daily observe. This proves that the 
law was intended to be the means of salvation &#59; since 
every one can at all times&#44; whether exalted or low &#8212; 
whether at sea or on land &#8212; whether at large or in 
pi&#8211;igon &#8212; whether rich or poor&#44; find some precept 
which he can obey&#44; and consequently do something 
to gain the favour of his Maker. 

But now some one may say&#58; &#34;Since there are so 
many labourers&#44; for what purpose are my services 
needed&#63; I am too unimportant&#44; too mean in the 
scale of Society&#44; that my labours should be missed&#58; 
I will sit contented in slothful idleness&#59; I will not 
oflend&#44; but I will merely let others&#44; greater than my&#8211; 
self&#44; do their great acts&#44; whilst I look on and profit 
by their examples.&#34; To this excuse answers Rabbi 
Tarfone&#58; &#39;Thou art not at liberty to divest thyself 
entirely of its performance&#44;&#34; meaning&#44; that we were

We are endowed with hearing&#44; with sight&#44; with taste&#44; 
with smell&#44; with feeling&#44; that we might enjoy the gifts 
which bountiful nature presents at every point&#59; but 
we too have a thinkino&#59; soul&#44; a reasonino&#59; mind&#44; which 
should set our powers in motion to a higher aim than 
mere personal enjoyment and slothful indolence. Let 
us step abroad&#44; cast our eyes over the wants of our 
fellow&#8211;men&#44; and is there no one that can be benefitted 
by our labours&#63; If we have riches&#44; is there no one 
who needs our bounty&#63; if we have health&#44; is there 
no one who lies stretched helpless on a bed of sick&#8211; 
ness&#63; if we have joy&#44; is there no one who needs con&#8211; 
solation&#63; if we have learning&#44; is there no one whom 
we could enlighten&#63; if we have religious hope&#44; if we 
are firm in faith&#44; is there no one whom our appeals 
could reach&#44; who might be warmed by the zeal which 
burns within us&#63; Say you&#44; &#34;We are humble&#44; un&#8211;

ed with liis art. How long and often would it with&#8211; 
draw the mason and the carpenter from their work&#44; 
were they to go out each time to fetch the things 
they need&#63; The attendance of the mere labourers 
abridges their toil and brings the undertaking to a 
much speedier conclusion than it could otherwise be. 
Just so is it with our religious structure. Our Mas&#8211; 
ter is the omnipotent universal Architect&#59; the build&#8211; 
ing is the improvement of mankind&#44; for this is the 
aim of all religion&#44; whether we ourselves or others 
are the objects of its operation&#59; the labourers are we 
all&#44; the sons of man&#59; and only by a concerted eftbrt 
can the building be constructed&#44; so that it may show 
a beautiful front and a high elevation in the presence 
of the Creator. There must be none weary&#44; none 
slothful&#44; none an idle spectator&#59; but whilst the master&#8211; 
minds are busy in executing the great designs for 
which they were fitted&#44; let the humbler in capacity 
encourage them during their toil&#44; and endeavour by 
a&#33;l moans to make their task pleasant&#44; their labours 
more easy. But O&#44; let no one say&#44; &#34; I cannot work &#59;&#34;

be done&#59; and many are endowed with a strength of

ways the true garb of distinguished merit&#44; as we read 
in our section of to&#8211;day&#58; &#34;And the man Moses was 
very meek above all the men who were upon the face 
of the earth.&#34;&#42; But&#44; humiUty nevertheless is no ex&#8211; 
cuse for idleness. When Gideon had been awakened 
to his own strength&#44; he overcame the enemy who 
sorely afflicted his people. Just so it is with the 
mind&#58; when the spirit is once aroused it may achieve 
wonders &#33; Abraham lived in his father&#39;s house&#44; wor&#8211; 
shipping in humility&#58; he was called forward&#44; and be&#8211; 
came the light of the world&#33; Moses and David were 
shepherds &#58; one became the great prophet whom all 
future ages will ever bless&#44; the other was afterwards 
the mightiest king of Israel&#44; and what is more&#44; the 
outpourings of his soul excite now and will excite for 
ever the sweetest thoughts of devotion&#44; the noblest 
conceptions in the great Creator&#39;s praise. Do you 
wish for more examples &#63; Go and search in the pages 
of history&#44; and see who were the true benefactors of 
their species&#59; they were rarely indeed those born in 
the purple&#44; very seldom those Avho inherited immense 
wealth&#44; but mostly the children of humble parents&#44; 
they who slowly and laboriously had to climb the 
ladder which leads upwards. Every thing requires 
a beo&#8211;inning&#59; the wizard&#39;s lamp which calls up houses 
at the moment they are wanted is no more a liction&#44; 
than the idea that great results can ever be looked 
for if action is not attempted. Only let every one 
throw into the common s&#39;lock whatever he is capable 
of&#44; and as there is a Rewarder of virtue&#44; an over&#8211; 
ru&#39;lino&#8211; Providence&#44; much good will result.&#8212; But let

no one be presumptuous enough to suppose that his 
assistance is so greatly needed&#44; that the work must 
stop&#44; if he is taken&#44; or if he does not lend his assist&#8211; 
ance. &#8212; For the time never yet was&#44; witnessed in Israel&#44; 
when the vineyard of the Lord was so destitute of 
labourers&#44; that for the absence of one the work had to 
cease. If one is removed&#44; a hundred will spring up&#59; 
if one withdraws&#44; many will press forward to snatch 
up the tools which the sluggard has thrown down. &#8212; 
Moreover&#44; it is not those who are overweening or 
who are ostentatious&#44; who either can teach&#44; or whose 
charity will be acceptable&#59; but it is at the last those&#44; 
whose wisdom wears the garb of modesty and whose 
charity is hidden by the love for the welfare of and a 
regard for the feelings of their fellow&#8211;men&#44; who can 
be truly acceptable. And thus speaks an Israelite&#42; 
of our own days of his own labours&#44; which have won 
him a name among the children of his people &#58; &#34; I 
am still far removed from the thought&#44; as though 
these attempts &#40;the name he gives his book relative to 
the duties of Israelites&#41;&#44; as though any work from 
my hand would fill up the gap&#59; for I know too well 
the entire magnitude of the subject&#44; too well my own 
limited powers. Upon the whole he must be a fool 
who believes&#44; that it is given to him&#44; alone&#44; to stand 
in the breach&#44; the healing of which is in the hands 
of God. But he too is a fool&#44; nay&#44; more than fool&#44; 
who&#44; because he cannot accomplish all&#44; attempts noth&#8211; 
ing whatever&#44; and because he is not rich in every 
thing&#44; endeavours not to lay the smallest&#44; poorest gift

upon the altar of Lis people. &#8212; Only attempts I ven&#8211; 
ture to offer&#44; nothing that is complete&#59; &#8212; happy&#44; if 
here and there one thought does not seem unworthy 
to one more richly endowed&#44; to follow it up&#44; and there 
lay his hand on the work where my strength failed 
me&#59; &#8212; happy&#44; if my book should become the induce&#8211; 
ment to one of the noble sons and daughters of my 
people to seek refuge from the floods of the times

God and his word&#59; &#8212; happy&#44; if that which is erroneous 
and false in my attempts may be recognized as such&#44; 
that it may not be the means to add to the sum of 
error and falsehood &#59; but also happy&#44; if they contain 
any part of truth and purity which He&#44; in whose 
hands rest the holiest destinies of Israel&#44; may not 
despise to let it become ever so small a contribution 
to a brighter building of life of the most holy thing 
in Israel&#59; &#8212; to have carried but one stone to the great 
structure&#44; to have poured but one drop of oil into the 
lamp of the sanctuary&#59; &#8212; for who would not find too 
rich a reward in this&#63;&#34; 

Thus speaks one who has received a high endow&#8211; 
ment&#44; who has been raised to preside over the con&#8211; 
gregations of the Lord in an extensive district in 
Germany &#59; and it is the right feeling with which we 
should do our duties whatever they may be&#44; whether 
the contribution be a book&#44; a deed of charity&#44; or an 
act of personal piety. It matters not which&#44; every 
act adds to the common stock of righteousness&#44; to 
the empire of holiness in Israel. Virtue is a plant 
which grows best when many watch and labour for 
its progress. Let all therefore who now hear me re&#8211;

Let the son follow the father&#44; and if need be let the 
father even learn from the son &#59; let the wife lead her 
husband&#44; if he should become neglectful of his duty&#59; 
let the brother exhort the sister to persevere in the 
road to grace and piety &#59; in short&#44; let every Israelite 
be a teacher&#44; an active labourer in the harvest of the

O Lord&#33; Thou who judgest in righteousness and 
mercy&#44; do not visit our iniquities in wrath and indig&#8211; 
nation &#59; but according to thy loving&#8211;kindness deal 
tenderly and forgivingly with our sins&#44; because we 
are flesh&#44; frail&#44; and prone to sin. Do regard us with 
compassion&#44; when thou reviewest our deeds&#59; and 
shed over the remnant of Jacob the spirit of grace 
and supplication &#59; and wlienever the sword of perse&#8211; 
cution is raised above our helpless heads&#44; stay Thou 
in thy mercy the descending blow&#44; and disarm the 
uplifted hand of our vengeful opponents. Let not 
the adversary prevail over the weak remainder that 
has escaped&#44; lest they&#44; who honour not thy name as 
do thy people Israel&#44; say in their presumption and the 
pride superinduced by the smiles of success and im&#8211; 
punity&#44; that we are forsaken of thy protection&#44; and 
cast out from thy bounty. O &#33; do speedily open the 
prisons of the captives&#44; and let those go free&#44; who

have no protector save Thee alone&#44; our Father&#44; who 
art the Guardian of Israel &#33; and fill with compassion 
the hearts of those who now oppress thy people&#44; that 
they may deal beneficently towards all our brethren 
of the house of Jacob thy servants. Amen.

Erst on Moriah&#39;s mount the temple stood&#44; when on 
Zion and in the streets of Jerusalem rolled the mighty 
masses who had thronged the highways to the sacred 
city&#44; where dwelt the glory of God. Thousands press&#8211; 
ed on thousands to prostrate themselves at the sacred 
threshold&#44; to behold as it were the more immediate 
presence of their God. Glad was the shout which 
responded to the priest&#39;s blessing&#44; sweet was the ac&#8211; 
claim which told that the Only One was the acknowl&#8211; 
edged Head of the people that dwelt within thy gates&#44; 
O Zion &#33; &#8212; But hushed is now the tumult&#44; the temple&#39;s 
splendid halls are levelled to the dust&#59; in Jerusalem&#44; 
on Zion&#44; on Moriah&#44; their rightful possessors are 
strangers&#44; aliens&#44; oppressed&#44; outcasts&#44; slaves&#33; and a 
foolish people&#44; a nation that has no wisdom&#44; revels in 
its invented rites on the spot where once was the glory 
of Israel. Yes&#44; the very spot&#44; where the temple form&#8211; 
erly burst upon the astonished&#44; delighted gaze of the 
pilgrim&#44; no Israelite can now approach unless at the 
peril of his life&#59; and in place of the reverence and 
adoratiou of the Lord according to the laws of Moses&#44; 
the muezzin of a newly&#8211;invented religion call to pray&#8211; 
er&#44; in the name&#44; it is true of the One God&#44; but asso&#8211; 
ciated with the belief in a prophet whom He did not 
send&#44; and out of whose mouth He has not spoken. &#8212;

formerly the land of wheat and barley&#8211;&#44; the lig&#44; the 
vine&#44; the pomegranate&#44; the olive and date&#8211;pa&#33; m&#59; 
wljere from every eminence refreshing springs bub&#8211; 
bled forth&#59; where on every side were fertile valleys&#44; 
vine&#8211;clad snmmits&#44; populous towns &#59; where on every 
meadow the cattle grazed in undisturbed security&#59; 
where at eventide in all its boundaries the shepherd 
might be seen leading back his thriving flock&#44; in 
desert&#44; on plain&#44; and mountain&#44; by running brook&#44; or 
purling spring&#59; &#8212; go there wdiere once the beloved na&#8211; 
tion dwelt under the guidance of their Legislator&#39;s 
code&#44; under the shadow of his rule &#58; and you will 
wonder over the desolation that meets your view 
everywhere. &#8212; The towns&#63; they are swept from the 
face of the earth&#44; and of many famous for deeds of 
bravery&#44; for schools&#44; for nurseries of piety&#44; not a stone 
is left to mark the spot where once they stood &#59; and 
the others yet existing have lost their splendour&#44; and 
squalid wn&#8211;etchedness&#44; and indolent&#44; unlabouring beg&#8211; 
gary are the lot of their sparse inhabitants. The olive 
groves in many places are cut down&#44; and though in 
several parts the fertility and extraordinary products 
of the land are not entirely gone&#58; still in many others 
the earth itself seems to have changed its nature&#44; the 
water&#8211;springs are drying up&#44; and the means of fertil&#8211; 
izing the soil&#44; which formerly existed&#44; are falling into 
decay and disuse under the iron sway of the present 
inheritors of our once blessed patrimony. AVhere 
formerly the shepherd fed his flock&#44; and the herds&#8211; 
man stood listlessly near the lowing&#58; ox or the srrazinir 
cow&#44; the robber now lies in wait behind the bare 
crag of some overhanging rock&#44; to despoil the un&#8211; 
armed traveller of his envied possessions. And

wherever tlie few scanty remains of Israel dwell&#44; they 
are subject to the arbitrary rule&#44; the outrageous exac&#8211; 
tions&#44; the cruel treatment of some covetous Arab&#44;&#44; or 
a bloodthirsty satrap of the Turkish emperor. There 
is no festive throng in Palestine&#59; there is no joy at 
the return of the holy seasons&#59; there is no security 
for life or limb&#59; but under the dear&#8211;bought protection 
of the stranger the sons of Jacob revisit their own 
long&#8211;loved land&#59; and amidst trembling and fear they 
worship where their forefathers worshipped&#59; and in 
the home of the free&#44; the land of the brave&#44; they dwell 
subject at every hour to be plundered without resist&#8211; 
ance&#44; to be incarcerated without appeal&#44; to be tor&#8211; 
tured and slain with scarcely any one willing or able 
to stay the executioner&#39;s hand. 

For centuries this has been the fate of our people 
and of our inheritance&#59; and widespread sorrow has 
been the lot of one&#44; and almost utter desolation that 
of the other. How many times did the wheel of 
sorrow pass over us &#33; how often has been unsheathed 
the sword to wound and to slay &#33; how many precious 
ones were sent to an untimely grave&#44; only because 
they were sons of a hated race&#33; And it mattered 
little who it was that bore rule&#44; whether the cunning 
Grecian&#44; the proud Roman polytheist&#44; the fire&#8211;wor&#8211; 
shipping Persian&#44; the light&#8211;armed Arab&#44; the warlike 
Seljuk&#44; or knightly Englishman&#44; or the pilgrim Gaul&#44; 
&#8212; all alike have hated&#44; spurned&#44; and slaughtered my&#8211; 
riads of our unoffending brothers&#33; hated them with&#8211; 
out cause&#59; spurned them because of their belief &#59; and 
slaughtered them for the sake of crimes of which 
they were not guilty&#44; and for the shedding of blood 
which their soul abhorred &#33; It would be a heartrcnd&#8211;

ing task to recount one thousandth part of all the 
evils which we had to bear in Palestine&#44; no less than 
elsewhere&#44; since our captivity commenced &#59; but so full 
is the history of nearly every nation with the&#44; cruel&#8211; 
ties inflicted on us&#44; so stained with innocent blood are 
the hands of many communities&#58; that they who note 
down passing events have scarcely thought it worth 
while to mention the particulars&#44; or to tell us the 
number of the victims slain to glut the demon of 
persecution. In short&#44; many have always literally 
consumed us&#59; and treachery and art&#44; persuasion and 
force&#44; bribes and the sword have all been employed 
to diminish the number of those who follow the law 
of the God of Abraham. 

And do you believe that these persecutions are 
events of long bygone years&#44; to be sought for in musty 
records of history &#63; Alas &#33; no &#59; there has not been a 
single age&#44; perhaps not a single year since our dis&#8211; 
persion&#44; which has not witnessed atrocities of this na&#8211; 
ture&#44; which has not told of Israel&#39;s degradation and 
sorrow. Even at this very day&#44; in an age which calls 
itself enlightened&#44; when learning is achieving won&#8211; 
derful triumphs&#44; when science is laying daily open 
the hidden things of nature and organization&#44; when 
one might have hoped that the mind of man would 
have become less savage and more active to the calls 
of humanity &#58; we have an exemplification of the same 
dark deeds which well befitted the iron age&#44; when men 
incased in steel&#44; and covered with armour of proof&#44; 
fought for sport with sharpened spears and uplifted 
swords till one of the combatants lay dead in the lists &#59; 
and when&#44; fired by the spirit of fanaticism and the 
love of adventure&#44; tens of thousands forsook their

NorthGrii sliores to contend with the dusky sons of 
the East for the possession of a fancied treasure which 
they imagined to exist in Palestine. Then indeed&#44; 
when the priests alone could read and wiite&#44; Avhen 
the man of war&#44; with a sword and steed&#44; was more 
valued than the peaceful farmer or the skilful artisan&#44; 
it was to be expected that those engaged in perilous 
warfare&#44; incited by blind zeal&#44; could&#44; horrible though 
it may be&#44; so far forget the law of love as to chant 
praises in the midst of streams of blood which detiled 
the streets of Jerusalem&#44; &#8212; whilst thousands of vic&#8211; 
tims of a murderous assault and an indiscriminate 
slaughter lay yet unburied within the precincts of the 
city of David. But this state of things has passed 
away &#59; the lust for and practice of war have in a 
measure had to yield to the arts of peace &#59; and it was 
to be hoped that&#44; after the sword had in a few late 
years drunk the gore of millions&#44; a spirit of calm in&#8211; 
quiry would have stopped up the entrance of unreason 
and falsehood. Unfortunately&#44; however&#44; this has not 
been the case&#44; and to this very day zealots and fana&#8211; 
tics do not pretermit their efibrts at extinguishing the 
lamp of Israel &#59; and not content with attempts at per&#8211; 
verting our opinions&#44; they have again within late 
commenced the system of false accusation&#44; in order 
to surrender our heads once more to the executioner&#44; 
that the earth might again drink the life&#8211;blood of the 
best of Jacob&#39;s sons. The same fables&#44; the falsity of 
which has been often proved&#44; the absurdity of which 
is too apparent to deserve a serious refutation&#44; have 
been again revived&#44; and it has been said that we need 
the blood of gentile victims to celebrate our sacred 
festivals. The Mussulman and the Papist have joined

hands to fasten this foul charge tipon our hrothers of 
the East&#59; and many have been dragged to prison&#44; sub&#8211; 
jected to torture and every species of cruelty&#44; nay&#44; some 
are said to have expired under the inflictions of their 
fiendish persecutors. Ay&#44; these victims have cried for 
help&#44; but none stood forth to aid them &#33; they appealed 
to their religion which forbids murder&#44; but they spoke 
to men who feel not pity for the outcasts of Israel&#59; 
the voice of Europe and of this land&#44; which is lifted 
up loud enough when other cases of suffering and 
outrage are presented&#44; has barely been raised&#59; nay&#44; 
the presumed author of this great wrong is not 
called on to answer for the evil he has done. O God&#33; 
has it come to this &#8212; is it thy Avill that we are never 
to know rest &#63; that we are always to be the mark for 
malice and wrong &#63; But thy will be done &#59; even as 
Thou decreest&#44; our Father &#33; be it our aim to learn 
submission &#59; only keep alive thy spirit&#44; the love of thy 
law within us&#59; that thy judgments may tend to purify 
our souls&#44; to exalt our hearts to Thee&#44; our Kino&#8211; and 
Saviour &#33; 

Indeed&#44; brethren&#44; it does seem that the curse de&#8211; 
nounced against us for our manifold misdeeds is yet 
active as ever it was&#44; that the infraction of the cove&#8211; 
nant of God with our forefathers demands to this day 
the punishment of the rebellious race. For what 
does Moses say in Leviticus &#40;xxvi. 88&#41;&#63; &#34;And ye 
shall perish among the nations&#44; and tlie land of your 
enemies shall eat you up.&#34; Yes&#44; this has been ful&#8211; 
filled literally&#44; with the sole limitation&#44; that the perish&#8211; 
ing and the eating up have not been entire&#44; for punish&#8211; 
ment was threatened&#44; not extermination. The inspired 
seer stood on the top of Horeb&#44; that cradle of oar ua&#8211;

tional existence &#59; he was permitted to survey virtue 
and its rewiird&#44; sin and its direful visitation. To his 
prophetic view the future lay opened&#44; and he saw 
how the evil niiti&#58;ht he averted by a steady adherence 
to the law of God &#59; but he also beheld the empire of 
truth invaded by the armies which the inclination to 
evil is capable of raising against the spread of right&#8211; 
eousness on earth. Moses therefore beij2&#58;ed and en&#8211; 
treated his brother Israelites never to lose sight of 
their Lord and Redeemer&#44; never to forget that He is 
ready to reward and able to punish. He warned them 
that by the observance of the covenant alone could 
they have peace&#59; but that war and the pestilence&#44; ac&#8211; 
companied by their handmaids&#44; famine and sickness&#44; 
should desolate their heritage for their refusal to 
obey. And he said in continuation&#44; that our resi&#8211; 
dence among the gentiles should constantly diminish 
our numbers&#44; and that&#44; so to say&#44; our increase should 
be eaten up by the land of our enemies. Has the 
force of this curse ever struck you&#63; if not&#44; reflect for 
one moment how truly it has been accomplished. 
Compare our present number with what it might 
have become&#44; had we been left undisturbed since 
our second expulsion from Palestine&#59; and had not 
so many hundreds of thousands been doomed to the 
sword&#44; had not so many more been mingled up ei&#8211; 
ther by force or voluntary apostacy with the nations 
of the earth&#58; how large would at this day have been 
the remnant of Israel &#59; every land would have been 
full of us&#44; every part of the earth would have felt our 
power&#33; This would have been&#44; had we reflected on 
our conduct&#44; and returned to the Lord in the lands of 
our enemies with all our heart&#44; when He would have

opened our bonds and given us enlargement. But 
wc always sougbt our interest more than the salva&#8211; 
tion of our God &#59; even in times of danger the spirit of 
gain swayed our souls&#44; and we endeavoured to fortify 
ourselves against the attacks of an unfriendly world 
by the possession of wealth. It appeared as though 
we wanted to make riches the bulwark against preju&#8211; 
dice&#44; and to rely upon the efl&#39;ects to be derived from 
the gifts of God more than upon God himself. Such 
folly therefore met its due visitation&#59; our wealth was 
made the means of our destruction&#59; the cupidity of 
our enemies became excited&#44; and the apparent wretch&#8211; 
edness of the Jews did not conceal from their keen&#8211; 
sighted persecutors the immense hoards of worldly 
goods they had heaped up &#59; and the destruction of so 
many homesteads&#44; the expulsion of our people from 
so many lauds only too well evidenced&#44; that our hopes 
had been built upon a shallow foundation. &#8212; And 
wdien in other places and other times we mixed too 
carelessly Avith the gentiles&#44; when we began perhaps 
to forget that we were sojourners far from our own 
land&#44; and the blessed hills of Judsea&#58; again the decree 
of sorrow went forth&#44; and catholic Spain and her sis&#8211; 
ter Portugal dipped their arms deep&#44; deep into rivers 
of blood shed by the merciless judges of Judah&#39;s 
fallen daughter. It was long indeed since peace had 
shed her smile on our path &#59; we were driven from one 
country to the other&#44; and scarcely any one land was 
Avilling to receive into its bosom the loathed descend&#8211; 
ants of the friends of the Lord&#59; and where we were 
permitted to rest awhile&#44; the badge of degradation 
was fixed on our garments&#44; we were penned up in 
particular streets&#44; denied the privilege of following

the jjalhs of industry best suited to onr capacities and 
tastes&#44; and condemned to resort to traffic alone and 
menial employments to supply bread for our wives 
and little ones. Even the right to marry was in many 
places refused except under cruel restrictions and 
onerous exactions&#44; and this is still continued in sev&#8211; 
eral parts of Europe to this very day. &#8212; For those only&#44; 
who outwardly forswore their hopes in Israel&#39;s salva&#8211; 
tion&#44; there was opened the race to preferment and 
distinction&#59; and thus&#44; what with the dread of death 
by the executioner&#39;s hands&#44; and honours and ease on 
the other side&#44; many were lost among the gentiles&#44; 
though we may also boast of a greater number who 
embraced death as their deliverer sooner than forego 
the favour of their God&#44; their portion as adherents to 
his law&#44; and of others who&#44; though conscious of tal&#8211; 
ents to raise them to renown in higher employments&#44; 
and not unfrequently invited to forsake their people&#44; 
still continued to live as Jews in conscious integrity 
and an obscurity more honourable than the blood&#8211; 
staiufid triumph of a monarch. 

With all this the hand of God was visibly stretched 
out for our protection&#44; and despite of all the dangers 
that encompassed us we were not utterly destroyed. 
At length the bigotry of an iron age began gradually 
to wear away before the re&#8211;discovered saving power 
of the holy Bible. The world began to inquire&#44; and 
to doubt the authority that bound every thing to the 
mandate of a priestly autocrat. By degrees too the 
bonds of persecution towards our people were more 
and more loosened &#59; and though yet oppressed&#44; and 
not permitted to be put on an equality with other

men&#44; we needed no longer to tremble for our per#8211; 
sonal safety and the security of the honest fruits of 
our industry. We already thought ourselves beyond 
the reach of the recurrence of ancient barbarities&#59; 
we fancied the world too enlightened for men to 
persecute each other&#44; because they could not agree 
on speculative matters. Especially were many of us 
lulled into security when not long since the spirit of 
innovation swept like a mighty whirlwind over the 
civilized world&#44; overturning in its violence long&#8211;cher&#8211; 
ished opinions&#44; prostrating deep&#8211;rooted custom&#44; scat&#8211; 
tering to the winds institutions which formerly no 
man dared to question. We then saw those who had 
hated us bending in their turn to the blast&#59; we be&#8211; 
lield our persecutors flying themselves from the fury 
of a populace formerly obedient to their wink in the 
slaughter of unoffending Israelites. We heard liberty 
and equality proclaimed as the birthright of every 
son of man &#59; and we saw the people everywhere&#44; 
roused by this cheering cry&#44; bursting asunder the fet&#8211; 
ters of slavery&#44; and ranging themselves under the 
banner which promised to lead them to victory over 
the prostrate ruins of the mighty fabric&#44; which ages 
of superstition had endeavoured to rear&#44; like another 
tower of Babel&#44; the top of which should reach unto 
heaven. We saw and heard all this&#59; and&#44; swept away 
too by the popular torrent&#44; we hailed this period as 
one of Israel&#39;s salvation&#44; we felt that we too could 
share in the triumph of the people&#39;s cause &#8212; we re&#8211; 
joiced that we were free. And truly the change was 
great and grateful &#59; the contempt attached to the name 
of Jew nearly vanished&#44; when so many bearing it were 
invested with power equally with other men&#44; when

bursting forth from the shackles of prejudice&#44; from 
tlie limits which tlie hatred of our name had cast 
around us&#44; we vindicated our rights as men by a dis&#8211; 
&#92;&#41;&#92;ay of excellence in all branches of honourable par&#8211; 
suit and knowledge which before had been interdicted 
to us. &#8212; But wo&#33; as our prosperity increased&#44; so in&#8211; 
creased our indifference to religion and its observance&#59; 
as the great mass cast off antiquated opinions&#44; so too 
did we hasten to prove that the revolution had touched 
our spirit also. Would to God &#33; that truth did not 
compel us to acknowledge the apostacy of Israel &#33; 
would &#33; that a lover of his faith might say&#44; that we 
did bear becomingly the change in our circumstances. 
But as ever&#44; &#34; Jeshurun grew tat and kicked&#59;&#34; and 
as everywhere we mingled upon equal terms with the 
nations&#44; we became forgetful of our obligations to the 
God of our deliverance&#59; we ate the food which his 
law prohibits&#59; we violated the Sabbath of his ordain&#8211; 
ing&#59; we intermarried with the gentile women&#44; and 
our daughters wedded those who are not of the stock 
of Jacob &#59; we refused to circumcise our male chil&#8211; 
dren &#59; we reformed&#44; as we called it&#44; our simple wor&#8211; 
ship &#59; we neglected the study of the Scriptures&#44; and 
in short became lamentably deficient in the fulfilment 
of our duties. &#8212; Yes&#44; we imagined that our freedom 
was the gift of men&#44; not the bestowal of the Supreme&#44; 
for which He deserves more energetic exertions to 
serve and obeyllim&#59; we imagined that the age of 
persecution was over&#44; and that the price of divine 
protection&#44; the constant vigilance over our conduct&#44; 
was no longer needed. We fell as we always bad 
fallen&#59; and prosperity&#44; as in former ages&#44; rendered 
us careless of that which adversity had rendered dear

to US as the light of onr eyes. Hence it was that we 
so eagerly sought to become like other nations&#44; and 
hence it is that the melancholy spectacle was witnessed 
of entire families falling off from onr religion&#44; not by 
open apostacy&#44; by an avowed joining of the standard 
of onr opponents&#44; &#8212; but by a gradual laying aside of 
all the distinguishing characteristics of Jewish con&#8211; 
duct&#44; till at length of some of these families there is 
not one remaining to claim affinity with the sons of 
Israel. Such persons moreover are more injurious 
than avowed apostates&#44; for these last are shunned as 
deserters from the fold of the Lord&#59; but the others 
are like the festering cancer&#44; they are a part of our&#8211; 
selves and destroy the vitality of the body on which 
they feed. And truly these lukewarm followers of 
our faith&#44; these Jews by name&#44; where there is no sub&#8211; 
stantial religious conviction or outward conformity&#44; 
have by their example&#44; and associations&#44; and family 
connexions drawn in thousands of others&#44; who other&#8211; 
wise might have stood steadfast &#58; until at length we 
view with complaisance&#44; without the least horror&#44; the 
public violation of the Sabbath&#44; the eating of the gen&#8211; 
tile&#39;s food&#44; and the intermarriage with strangers to 
our blood&#44; to such a degree even&#44; that scarcely any 
regret is expressed if&#44; by such an act as the last men&#8211; 
tioned&#44; an entire household be driven from the com&#8211; 
munity of our people&#44; and thrown into the fatal em&#8211; 
brace of strangers to our religion. &#8212; iSTay more&#44; peo&#8211; 
ple violate every commandment &#59; some will not seal 
their offspring with the sign of the covenant&#44; and still 
claim the risrht of Israelites as though no wronsrwere 
chargeable on their conscience&#59; and they thus ac&#8211;

law&#44; they believe in its sanctity and divine origin. &#8212; 
And these deeds we imaiyine will remain unavencjed&#63; 
we defy God&#44; and fancy that his thunders slumber &#63; 
But &#34;lo He slumbereth not. He slcepcth not&#44; the 
Guardian of Israel &#59;&#34;&#39; He who ever stretched out his 
hand to draw us safely out of the fowler&#39;s snare&#44; or 
from the floods of mighty waters&#44; will save us&#44; despite 
of ourselves&#44; from the consequences of our own in&#8211; 
iquity&#44; from the foxes among us who wound our 
vineyards&#44; the vineyards of the Lord&#44; that have ten&#8211; 
der grapes.&#42; The Lord in his own good time will 
purity his fold. He will cast out thence those who 
will not follow the lead of their Shepherd. Yea &#33; 
though they flourish awhile&#44; their hour of retribution 
is nigh&#44; nearer than any one may perhaps imagine. &#8212; 
For&#44; believe me&#44; brethren &#33; this is not the first time 
that indiflerence and neglect were the besetting sins 
of our people &#59; already during our existence as an in&#8211; 
dependent nation were there men like those I have 
endeavoured to sketch to you. An Elijah had to fly 
for his life&#44; because he had fulfilled the command of 
the law on those who had misled the people to sin &#59; 
and when after the times of this devoted prophet the 
judgment of the Most High had cast the ten tribes 
from their boundaries &#58; the remaining families of Is&#8211; 
rael persisted in sin&#44; imagining that the evil would 
not reach them. They&#44; like the men in our day&#44; 
were lulled in fatal security&#44; they would not believe 
that their stronghold&#44; Jerusalem&#44; could become a 
prey to the devouring flame. &#8212; It was then that Jere&#8211; 
miah was called to step forward as the prophet of wo&#44; 

&#42; Song of Solomon&#44; ii. 15.

and to denounce upon the sinful generation and their 
guilty city tlie evil which was hastening with rapid 
strides to overwhelm in one common ruin king and 
people&#44; priest and prophet&#44; city and country&#44; the holy 
and the profane. And thus we read &#58; 

&#34; Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me&#44; saying&#44; What 
dost thou see&#44; Jeremiah&#63; And I said&#44; I see a rod of an almond 
tree. Then said the Lord to me&#44; Thou hast well seen &#59; for I am 
hastening with my word to fulfil it.&#34; Jer. i. 11&#44; 12. 

I will merely remark incidentally that the same root 
in Hebrew signifying almond also makes the verb 
hasten&#44; thus Shahkade and Shahkahd &#59; hence the vision 
representing to the prophet&#39;s view the speedj&#39; accom&#8211; 
plishment of the .evil was a rod of an almond tree&#59; 
and let me farther state that many passages in the 
prophets must be explained in a similar manner by 
a reference to a similarity of words in the Hebrew 
original text which no translation can convey. &#8212; 
Enough&#44; the propliet saw&#44; long before the people 
thought themselves in danger&#44; the certain approach 
of the fulfilment of God&#39;s word&#44; conveyed to them 
by former messengers&#44; unless they themselves would 
avert the evil by a speedy and thorough repentance. 
The servant of the Lord went forth&#44; reasoned with 
his brethren&#44; and for many years exhorted them to 
reflect and to return to the safe haven of the divine 
protection &#58; yet they refused to listen&#44; their ears were

closed&#44; their eyes averted. But the evil they did not 
suppose possible did come at length&#44; and famine&#44; and 
pestilence&#44; and tire&#44; and sword completed the work 
of desolation&#44; and never was the crown of our head 
restored since it was hurled to the ground in the days 
of Zedekiah. This briefly was our fate in former 
years&#44; when we sinned&#44; reckless of the impending 
judgment&#59; coming events were actually sketched out 
fully before the people&#39;s eyes &#59; but they would not 
believe themselves guilty&#44; nor would they imagine 
the prophecies would become fulfilment. &#8212; May it not 
be&#44; beloved brethren&#44; that evil is now impending over 
us for our manifold transgressions&#44; for our repeated 
disregard of the duties demanded by our holy law&#63; 
Even now persecution has again lighted her consum&#8211; 
ing torch&#44; its lurid glare has already terrified many 
of our distant communities&#44; nay some have bled under 
its visitation &#58; and we fear not&#59; we think the evil too 
far removed for us to dread its approach. But may 
not the reports we hear be the mujttering of the dis&#8211; 
tant thunder&#44; which ere long may burst over our own 
heads&#44; in all the fierceness of a destroying storm &#63; 
may not the distant sorrow be like the heavy atmos&#8211; 
phere&#44; which prededes the earthquake that overthrows 
cities and desolates fertile lands&#63; may not our pres&#8211; 
ent safety be like the slumbering of a volcano&#44; whose 
fires are not quenched though its eruptions have 
ceased&#63; I fear&#44; I fear&#44; that our security is of a like 
uncertain tenure &#59; for if even there should be no hu&#8211; 
man persecution possible in lands where the rule of 
the laws is firmly established&#44; God&#39;s power is not 
shortened&#44; and He has in store exquisite pains of a 
new and unheard&#8211;of nature&#44; perhaps&#44; which may

unawares strike deep into the heart of the obdurate 
sinner. 

Our fathers have sinned&#44; and they are no more &#59; 
yet we bear the burden of our captivity for the sins 
they committed. They were unwise&#44; inasmuch as 
they would not take warning when they were admon&#8211; 
ished. Shall we imitate their follies&#63; shall we hear 
the voice that admonishes us without heeding its 
call &#63; O no&#44; brethren &#33; remove this sturabhng&#8211;block 
of unbelief on which so many have been wrecked 
already&#59; draw nearer to the Rock of salvation&#44; to the 
Lord your God&#44; whose precepts are in your hands. 
Seize hold of the hand that is pointing out the road 
ye should walk&#44; and fear not to suffer for the sake of 
your Maker&#44; if his service should be surrounded by 
bodily dangers. &#8212; He is the Author of your life&#44; the 
Arbiter of your fortune &#58; and why then should you 
refuse to yield the one or relinquish the other&#44; if even 
these were demanded &#63; But no such sacrifice is de&#8211; 
sired of you now &#58; you are merely asked to devote a 
small part of your days&#44; a little bodily suffering&#44; only 
a small portion of your wealth&#44; because the law so 
makes it your duty. &#8212; Let us&#44; therefore&#44; hope that we 
will take better counsel&#44; and that we will become 
more and more allied to the Creator by deeds which 
well befit Israel&#44; which are consonant with the service 
of the Most High. If then notwithstanding this obe&#8211; 
dience misfortune should be our lot&#44; we will have the 
consolation that we have the favour of our God to as&#8211; 
sist us in our sorrow&#59; and that&#44; though men frown. 
He will smile approvingly when we are summoned 
into his presence to render an account of the deeds

Tamuz 23d. &#124; 5600 
July 24th.



Note. &#8212; Tho above Discourse was written with reference to the 
persecution of the Jews which commenced in the winter of &#39;40&#44; both 
at Khodes and Damascus&#44; under the false pretext&#44; the parent never&#8211; 
theless of many similar atrocities in the middle ages&#44; of the Jews 
employing human blood at their festival of the Passover. That 
such an absurdity should ever have been advanced&#44; not to mention 
its finding credence with so many whose opportunities of knowing 
the truth must have been ample&#44; is truly a phenomenon in the his&#8211; 
tory of the follies to which the human mind has at times been 
known to cling&#44; with a pertinacitj&#39; and avidity which would have 
been honouring the cause of virtue and benevolence. And it ap&#8211; 
pears to me that the serious refutation bestowed upon this calumni&#8211; 
ous charge by so many distinguished men of our people is almost 
superfluous &#58; were it not that&#44; despite of its absurdity&#44; it has worked 
immense mischief and caused incalculable suliering to thousands of 
Israelites at different times. Yet as the world has advanced so far 
&#92;n civilization&#44; and as a knowledge of our laws and ceremonies is 
now so extensive&#44; it is to be hoped that its late revival&#44; and the con&#8211; 
sequent persecution&#44; may be the last we shall have to witness. &#8212; In 
another address I had occasion to dwell more at length upon this 
melancholy occurrence stripped of the above application to re&#8211; 
ligious improvement&#44; and to exhibit some more of the especial fea&#8211; 
tures which presented themselves in coQuexion lyith it&#44; althougl&#41;

it amounts by no means to any thing like a history of the event&#59; 
which however T could hardly give in the course of two or three 
lectures&#44; and which I have no doubt will at some future day be 
furnished by some one of the gifted sons of our people. 

One gratifying circumstance has attended this affliction. Men 
of all persuasions and of all countries have felt&#44; and so expressed 
themselves&#44; that a great wrong has been committed against an un&#8211; 
offending body of men &#59; and individuals in all stations have emu&#8211; 
lated to show their sympathy and to offer relief. Pre&#8211;eminent 
among these stands Mr. Van Buren&#44; the chief magistrate of this 
republic&#44; who unsolicited by any one instructed the ambassador of 
the United States at Constantinople and their consul at A.lexandria 
to use their influence in behalf of the prisoners&#44; and to urge the 
abolition of torture injudicial proceedings in the Ottoman empire. 
&#8212; I know not whether these recommendations have had any effect&#59; 
but this is of no importance in the present case&#44; as I only refer to 
the honourable feeling without regard to the consequences. I will 
merely state that&#44; when writing the above Discourse&#44; these orders 
had not been given &#59; in fact no public movement whatever had taken 
place in this country in the matter &#59; though since then the case has 
been very different. 

As these sheets are going through the press the gratifying in&#8211; 
telligence has been received&#44; that through the agencj&#39; of Sir Moses 
Montefiore and Mr. Cremieux&#44; the Pacha of Egypt has ordered the 
liberation of all the prisoners confined in Damascus&#44; and given per&#8211; 
mission to those who had fled to return to their homes. Still the 
favour of a public trial&#44; which would have demonstrated their in&#8211; 
nocence&#44; has been refused&#44; and the torture has not yet been abolish&#8211; 
ed&#44; although it was urged by the &#34; representatives of the Jews of 
all the globe.&#34; &#8212; In Rhodes aL&#8211;o the falsity of the charge has been 
made apparent&#44; and the authors of the wrong have been punished 
for their daring violation of the rights of humanity. &#8212; Thus have 
they&#44; who had at first no one to aid them&#44; been snatched from de&#8211; 
struction&#44; and thus has divine Goodness raised up friends and advo&#8211; 
cates to plead the cause of the oppressed. &#8212; Laus Deo&#33;

THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW. 

Glory unto the Father who is everlasting&#44; praise 
and hoHness to the Creator of the universe&#44; even in 
the midst of his servants the house of Israel whom 
He has chosen to be his people&#44; the messengers of his

Brethren &#33; 

Like the works of the Lord&#44; so are his word and 
promises&#44; enduring for ever. Whatever is&#44; exists&#44; 
just as you see it&#44; for a wise and useful object&#44; al&#8211; 
though your information&#44; your knowledge of the 
ways of God&#44; will not permit you to discover the 
why &#63; and wherefore &#63; Even so is the word revealed 
from the Supreme Ruler &#58; its essence is wisdom&#44; its 
purpose the beatitude and salvation of the creatures 
of his hands. Nothing in all nature is fortuitous&#44; 
that is to say&#44; nothing is&#44; as we iind it&#44; put here by 
chance&#44; at random&#44; without an ulterior view&#44; without 
design &#59; for the Wisdom that created&#44; surveyed after 
creating every thing which exists&#44; and pronounced 
it &#34; very good &#58;&#34; the design is apparent at every step &#59;

admirable adaptation of every thing for the object of

smith wields to fashion into shape the articles which 
he elaborates is no less suited to its end&#44; by its tex&#8211; 
ture&#44; hardness&#44; and power of endurance&#44; than is the 
human body&#44; wonderful as are its form and structure&#44; 
to the end of its formation. The more knowlede&#58;e 
you obtain&#44; the deeper you penetrate by study and 
reflection into the mysteries and connexion of out&#8211; 
ward nature&#44; the stronger&#44; the more convincing will 
these facts force themselves upon your conviction&#59; 
and at every step in advance you take in the wide 
book of scientific discovery&#44; you will be standing 
self&#8211;abashed for ever having dared to doubt the wis&#8211; 
dom and power of the Creator. And if in the com&#8211; 
mencement of your inquiry you started with the 
dreadful idea of disproving the existence of one 
Ruler and Maker&#44; the first dawn of light wdiich the 
harmony of all things sends into your soul will make 
you exclaim with the Psalmist &#40;Psalm Ixxvii. 15&#41; &#58; 
&#34; Thou art the God that doest wonders. Thou hast 
made known thy strength among the nations.&#34; The 
dark clouds of unbelief will vanish&#59; your eyes will 
be opened to the glorious truth that beams from 
every star&#44; that shines forth from the bright light of

from the flowing brook&#44; from the arid plain&#59; and 
your ears will greedily drink in the sound that 
speaks from every hill&#44; from every valley&#44; which is 
repeated from the sage whose words are wisdom&#44; 
from the yet speechless babe&#44; from the howling 
beasts of the desert&#44; and from the feathered min&#8211;

a Creator&#59; it is folly alone which in its presumption 
can deny the overruling of an all&#8211;wise&#44; &#59;vll&#8211;po&#92;veiiiil&#44; 
all&#8211;merciful Providence. Devotion however i.s the 
child of knowledge&#44; and the progress of instruction 
will fill the spirit with prayerful thoughts&#44; with ex&#8211; 
ulting thanksgiving for the innumerable blessings&#44; 
for the countless means of enjoyment&#44; which are so 
liberally scattered over the whole surface of nature 
by its wise and benignant Author&#44; 

But no less than outward nature&#44; is the inspiration 
of God manifested in the books of Holy Writ an ob&#8211; 
ject of admiration &#59; and the whole scheme of divine 
truths presents to thinking minds causes for study 
and humble submission &#59; and the more our circle of 
knowledge is enlarged&#44; the greater will become our 
attachment to the precepts and doctrines which our 
Maker has been pleased to bestow on a benighted 
world. Just as with the Creator himself&#44; nothing but 
ignorance can have doubts of the existence of the 
holy Word&#44; or of the wisdom of the institutions which 
are founded on it. Many there have indeed been 
who have affected to disbelieve&#44; to find fault&#44; to deny 
the excellence of the treasure which they either did 
not understand&#44; or&#44; if understanding&#44; wickedly reject&#8211; 
ed. But look at their doings &#8212; and have these been 
of the kind to win admiration from their fellow&#8211; 
beings&#63; at their teaching &#8212; and can you discover in it 
aught of that universal applicability which the Bible 
presents at every page &#63; It were enough to make a 
philanthropist weep over the folly of man to behold 
the imbecile presumption&#44; with which he endeavours 
to estimate the code of our Lord by the small meas&#8211;

on him &#59; especially if he at the same time surveys all 
the systems which have ever been based upon human 
invention&#44; from the beginning of the world unto our 
own days. On all sides jarring inconsistencies will 
be apparent&#59; and the attempts to file away the rough&#8211; 
ness of the scriptural scheme in the modern so&#8211;called 
improvements&#44; will exhibit themselves as things to 
be deprecated by those who humbly wish to serve 
their Maker and to promote the best interests of their 
neighbour. 

Let the doubter speak of the terrors of a bloody 
code&#44; such as the Mosaic dispensation&#59; let him declare 
that he understands not how a law&#44; claiming to be 
of divine origin&#44; can demand the immolation of crim&#8211; 
inals for a violation of its details&#58; still let the believer 
not be deterred from pursuing his humble inquiries 
into the beauties of the heavenly gift in our posses&#8211; 
sion &#59; but let him look upon the denunciations of 
punishment in their true light&#44; as evidence of the 
great weight which the Lord attaches to the observ&#8211; 
ance of his precepts&#44; and that He deemed the trans&#8211; 
gression of the most vital of them so dangerous to the 
general welfare&#44; as to ordain that he&#44; who purposely 
so offends&#44; and scandalizes his neighbour by his open 
misconduct&#44; should receive condign punishment as a 
sinner against the public peace and happiness. He 
ought farther to take into consideration&#44; that it by no 
means follows&#44; that a punishment is inflicted because 
it is threatened&#59; but that the law merely declares that 
a punishment should follow a violation&#44; and the only 
object of the threat thus made is to deter those&#44; who 
otherwise might be induced from wilfulness or interest&#8211; 
ed views to become guilty in the eyes of the law&#44; from

fulfilling their sinful intentions. I will merely men&#8211; 
tion here incidentally&#44; that the punishment of death&#44; 
according to the best authorities&#44; was rarely witnessed 
in Palestine&#44; perhaps a centenarian might never have 
seen one execution from one end of the country to 
the other&#59; so mild was the sway of the Mosaic pre&#8211; 
cepts&#44; so careful of life&#44; of the sinner&#39;s even&#44; was the 
code which of old governed the Israelitish nation. &#8212; 
To continue &#58; who would blame a father&#44; if he were 
to announce to his son that he should have no share 
in his patrimony&#44; were he to bring disgrace upon his 
family by a criminal course of life &#63; Yet precisely 
similar is the case with the law &#58; it is the gift of our 
universal Parent&#44; the Bestower of life and happiness&#59; 
it is intended as the best safeguard for our temporal 
and permanent welfare&#59; it is our inheritance&#44; and 
mankind have been appointed its guardians. Now 
one of the community&#44; disregarding his obligation to 
his God and to his fellow&#8211;beings&#44; wilfully transgresses&#44; 
and bids open defiance to the kindly warning which 
would gladly teach him better things&#58; he becomes in 
consequence an outcast from the community of the 
law&#44; and a fester upon the body politic&#59; he is&#44; so to 
say&#44; disinherited by his own act from his father&#39;s 
household&#44; and his life becomes a forfeit&#44; to deter 
others from following the evil which has been daring&#8211; 
ly perpetrated among them &#33; Not&#44; therefore&#44; to re&#8211; 
venge&#44; but to infuse wholesome terror into the general 
mass&#44; for the promotion of the greatest good of the 
greatest number&#44; or rather for the universal good of 
all&#44; was the sword handed over to those who are&#44; un&#8211;

the benefit of every individual&#44; be be high or low&#44; ex&#8211; 
alted or humble. For were it not for the terror of 
the laws&#44; the state of society would be deplorable in 
the extreme &#58; each man would endeavour to right 
himself by his own strength of arm &#59; he would in a 
measure be compelled to redress his owni wrongs&#59; 
and it requires but a small share of comprehension to 
be convinced that such proceedings would produce 
anarchy among the powerful&#44; and suffering and 
sorrow among the weak and unprotected. If now 
the Mosaic law is inexorable in its punishment of 
murder&#44; what is effected thereby&#63; nothing less than 
the restraining of the man of violence or him of hasty 
and ungovernable anger from violating the life of his 
fellows&#59; for if his passion would arm his hand against 
his brother&#44; he will be perhaps induced to reflect that 
if he should be convicted of shedding a brother&#39;s&#44; 
blood&#44; he would have no mercy to expect from the 
community who are appointed to decide upon the de&#8211; 
gree of his criminality. 

If the profanation of the Sabbath&#44; committed pub&#8211;

where there is no case of necessity proved&#44; consigns

destroyer of the social compact&#44; who&#44; if bis example 
were followed&#44; would lead many to sin&#44; by producing 
a neglect of an institution which is wholesome at the 
same time to the body&#44; and binding the soul more 
closely to the Ruler of the universe&#63; Therefore&#44; 
says the law &#40;Exodus xxxi. 14&#41; &#58; &#34; Therefore you shall 
keep the Sabbath&#44; for it is holy unto you &#59; every one 
that profaneth it shall surely be put to death&#59; for 
whosoever doth any work thereon&#44; that soul shall be 
cut off from among his people.&#34; Not&#44; as we said be&#8211; 
fore&#44; not in vengeance&#44; because the law thirsts for the 
transgressor&#39;s blood&#44; but to remove the evil example 
of the wicked sinner who&#44; knowing the responsibility 
be incurs&#44; will still bid detiance to his God&#44; who is the 
invisible King of his people&#44; and neglect the institu&#8211; 
tion which his brothers in faith justly esteem as too 
sacred to be disregarded with impunity. 

Let us take another example. The foundation of 
our law is the acknowledgment of the Supreme Be&#8211; 
ing&#44; who manifested himself to our forefathers in 
Egypt&#44; as we read &#40;Exodus xx. 2&#41;&#58; &#34;I am the Lord

since his life has exhibited a bad example&#44; his death 
maj atone for the guilt and be the means of deter&#8211; 
ring others from following the path of sin which leads 
to destruction. &#8212; But observe&#44; it was not speculative 
idolatry which was punishable by the sword of jus&#8211; 
tice&#59; for&#44; whilst man sinned only to his Maker&#44; the 
vengeance was in the hands of the Lord alone &#59; not 
to man was to be given the judging over another&#39;s 
thoughts and opinions&#59; but it was only when the 
daring had proceeded to the length of an outward 
adoration&#44; or of some act which proved to the satis&#8211; 
faction of men that the transgressor had thrown ofi&#34; 
the allegiance which the whole community owed to 
their heavenly King&#44; that the civil authorities could 
step forward to arrest&#44; try&#44; condemn and punish an 
act which had placed the criminal beyond the pale 
of the laws&#44; and rendered him unworthy of life. &#8212; It 
were easy to go farther into this inquiry&#44; and to ex&#8211; 
hibit at greater length the correctness of the punish&#8211; 
ments in the Mosaic rule of other wrongs besides 
those enumerated &#59; but for once we have shown enough 
that the objections of the doubter are by no means 
formidable before the light of reason&#59; and at some 
future day it is probable that the inquiry may be 
pursued in its more minute ramilications. &#8212; It is suf&#8211; 
ficient for our purpose that the punishments were 
commensurate with the crimes&#44; and that their aim 
was the purification of the body politic&#44; when it was 
evident that the sinner himself had been placed be&#8211; 
yond the reach of amendment. In addition to this 
we find a gradation of punishment&#44; and nowhere do

we discover a minor wrong visited hy the greater re&#8211; 
taliation. Happy&#44; therefore&#44; had it been&#44; if all man&#8211; 
kind had submitted theaiselves to the operation of 
this code&#59; happy indeed had our nation been&#44; had we 
always consulted its enactments&#44; and been sincere in 
obeying them&#33; Then would we have prospered be&#8211; 
yond measure&#44; and we should have been an enviable 
people&#44; with God for our only King&#44; and universal 
brotherly love the ruling passion of our lives. And 
it is this alone which is the object of the revelation 
we have received&#44; &#8212; not so much the exaltation of the 
Creator&#44; who stands in no need of our service&#44; as the 
welfare of the creature&#44; who needs both the assistance 
of his fellow&#8211;mortal in his search for happiness and 
the grace of his God to prosper his undertaking. 

These views will enable us to understand one of 
the most sublime passages in Holy Writ&#44; sublime 
even there where everj&#8211; word almost is fraught with 
doctrines of life and salvation &#59; which was delivered 
at the time when the end of our teacher&#39;s days was 
fast approaching&#44; when his priestly brother and pro&#8211; 
phetic sister had already preceded him unto the laud 
of everlasting life&#59; when he was almost on the point 
of surrendering his guiding&#8211;staff to his trusty succes&#8211; 
sor&#59; when a ministration of forty years&#44; during which 
he had endeavoured to make known to the people 
the ways and laws of God&#44; was drawing to a speedy 
termination. He had been the means of the Lord in 
efiecting wonderful events in behalf of Israel&#44; and by 
rewards and punishments&#44; both actual and denounced&#44; 
he had taught his brothers&#44; that the revelation from 
Sinai could not be transgressed without brino&#8211;ius&#58; 
punishment upon the offender. And now&#44; at the close

almost of his labours&#44; and after ho liad called to the 
mind of the people those terrible effects of disobedi&#8211; 
ence of which all liis hearers had been witnesses&#44; he 
spoke as follows&#58; 

&#34;And now&#44; Israel&#44; what dotli the Lord thy God require of thee&#44; 
but to fear the Lord thy God&#44; to walk in all his ways&#44; and to love 
Him&#44; and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with 
all thy soul &#59; to keep the commandments of the Lord&#44; and his 
statutes which I command thee this day&#44; that it may be well with 
thee&#63;&#34; Deut. x. 12&#44; 13. 

As we have said&#44; for forty years had Moses been 
actively employed in teaching the people of Israel&#44; 
and he was now engaged in summing up&#44; to use a 
common phrase&#44; all his instruction in a few compre&#8211; 
hensive sentences&#59; and our text is the chief part in 
which he included all that had been said already&#44; and 
which he had yet to tell. He therefore commences&#58; 
&#34; And now&#44; Israel&#44; what doth the Lord thy God re&#8211; 
quire of thee&#63;&#34; is it something too difficult for hu&#8211;

strength has been given &#63; By no means &#58; the labour 
is easy of fultilment&#44; if man regards correctly his re&#8211; 
lation to the Creator. In the first place&#44; the thing 
required is &#34;to fear the Lord thy God&#59;&#34; and who 
will not fear Him in whose hand is all the power&#44; 
and who can do whatever seems to Him best&#44; without

we sin&#59; but which latter alternative we can avoid&#44; if 
we &#34;walk in his ways.&#34; IIow is this to be done&#63; 
Ay&#44; by imitating Him in his ways of mercy&#59; to be

sorrow&#44; and who relinquishes us not even then when 
the spirit has been severed from the body&#44; but bestows 
on us a life&#44; which is holier&#44; sweeter&#44; happier than 
the existence in this mortal state&#44; where pain and 
pleasure constantly chase each other over the varied 
surface of our being. Yes&#44; we are to love Ilim&#44; who

pause a moment &#58; were a man to utter sncli a thought&#44; 
we might justly fear that he presuniptiiDusIy ap&#8211; 
proached too near to the Deity&#59; but here Holy Writ 
itself expressly teaches us that we can love our God&#44; 
that we can make ourselves worthy of his love&#59; that&#44; 
in short&#44; obedience will unite the creature to the 
Creator&#44; and that virtuous resolves and virtuous ac&#8211; 
tions will render us children of salvation&#44; humble 
thougli our actions be. &#8212; And thus continues the text&#44; 
&#34; and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart 
and with all thy soul &#58;&#34; all that is necessary to eflect 
this is to surrender our judgment to the instruction 
we have received&#44; not to hesitate at every point&#44; be&#8211; 
cause we see not the reasons which governed infinite 
Wisdom in his enactments&#59; but they who fear the 
Lord&#44; who wish to walk in his ways&#44; and who strive 
to love Ilim&#44; shoukl follow the road He has marked 
out for them with a singleness of heart which knows 
no rebellion&#44; and with a devotedness of soul which 
gladlj&#39; yields itself to divine guidance&#44; to the truth as 
manifested in the records of revelation. If thus we 
think it will be easy for us to obey the next condition&#44; 
which is&#44; &#34;to keep the commands of the Lord and his 
statutes&#59;&#34; for to the humble believer there is nothing 
unreasonable&#44; nothing superfluous in the law &#59; he will 
apply the best light given him to elucidate for himself 
and others the reasons&#44; and scope&#44; and uses of the pre&#8211; 
cepts&#44; and where his reason fails to carry him farther&#44; 
he will prostrate himself before his God&#44; and obey

juclgmeiit against Ilim by whose sufterance he liven&#44; 
and thinks. &#8212; But if we ask&#44; &#34;What is the aim of all 
this fear&#44; love&#44; and obedience&#63;&#34; the Scriptures answer&#44; 
&#34;that it may be well with thee&#58;&#34; the Creator needs 
not our service to complete his happiness&#44; nothing 
that we can accomplish will augment or diminish his 
holiness&#44; purity&#44; wisdom&#44; or power&#59; but the acts we 
do will revert to ourselves&#44; that w&#44;e may become&#44; 
though at an infinite degree less than God&#44; holy&#44; 
pure&#44; and wise&#44; and be armed with faith and a con&#8211; 
fiding trust in Providence&#44; which attainments will 
open for us the portals of that happiness which our 
appointment on earth is capable of enjoying&#44; and 
make us shine like the stars unto everlasting when 
our task is ended. 

&#34;That it may be well with thee &#58;&#34; yes&#44; the punish&#8211; 
ments for the infraction of the law also are for the 
promotion of happiness no less than the rewards and 
blessings. If God is glorified by the grace which 
attends the life of the righteous&#44; by the peace which 
illumines the souls of his servants&#58; He is likewise 
honoured by the equal measure of justice which 
reaches the transgressor&#44; by the darkness and cloud 
which rest upon the spirit of the sinner. So also 
says David in Psalm xxxvi. 10&#44; where he styles him&#8211; 
self the servant of the Lord &#58; &#34; For with Thee is the 
fountain of life&#44; in thy light shall we see light.&#34; It 
is only when we love&#44; fear&#44; and imitate God&#44; that the 
fountain of life can be opened to us&#44; and only when 
we diligently obey the commandments&#44; that we can 
see the heaveidy light which is the light unto ever&#8211; 
lasting salvation. But on the other hand&#44; as Solo&#8211;

with tlio righteous the city rejoiceth&#59; and when the 
wicked perish there is shouting.&#34; This means that 
the joy which the multitude feel when the true friends 
of mankind flourish&#44; can be exceeded only by the ex&#8211; 
ulting conviction of an overruling Providence&#44; when 
the daring sinners at last meet with the judgment 
they have so long braved&#44; as though the power of 
Heaven were too limited&#44; or his watchfulness too 
slothful to reach them&#44; and to put a period to their

ence&#44; &#8212; continued obedience if we are on the road of 
righteousness&#44; and renewed obedience&#44; if we have de&#8211; 
viated into the mazes of sin. The light may be ob&#8211; 
scured&#44; a veil may hide the face of the sanctuary &#59;

God&#44; and to trust in the righteousness of his com&#8211;

chastisements&#44; be they an immediate infliction from 
Heaven&#44; or through the decision of an earthly tri&#8211; 
bunal&#44; even if this be an ignominious death for the 
wrongs with which we have boded our conscience. 
And if we do so&#44; then will the light shine upon us 
also&#44; though the moment be the moment of our death&#59; 
and the veil will be rent which has exchided from 
our eyes the face of the holiness of God&#44; into whose 
presence an entire surrendering of the spirit will lead 
us&#44; to everlasting joy&#44; to unending happiness. 

This is the scheme of the Mosaic Dispensation&#44; this 
is the doctrine which Heaven himself has taught us 
of his ways and his goodness&#59; and by following its 
dictates in the spirit of humility and devotion we all 
may have the satisfaction to know&#44; that under the 
guidance of divine grace we may live to work out 
our own salvation&#44; each one for himself&#44; but not 
through the means of a mediator&#44; an idea which our 
religion rejects. No&#44; brethren&#33; the law was given 
unto us&#44; the people of Israel&#44; to be ours&#44; to be our 
birthright&#44; all the days of our existence&#59; it is the road 
to happiness&#44; by following which we are pursuing life&#44; 
a life of tranquillity of conscience when mortal&#44; a life 
of unclouded joy when we have entered the mansion 
of our Father&#44; purified by the pangs of death. No&#8211; 
where is it said that any other method exists&#44; nowhere 
is any other condition required&#59; obedience to God&#39;s 
will is the only demand&#59; but this requirement must 
be implicitly followed&#59; no deviating to the right or 
the left&#44; no swerving into by&#8211;paths either from fear 
of loss&#44; or a desire to gain the pleasures of a transient 
life&#44; or to aggrandize ourselves at the expense of the

Glorify the Lord your God&#44; ye of the seed of Is&#8211;

you amidst all the trials to which you have been sub&#8211; 
jected. From the infancy of your nation up to the

ceive protection in every afflicting event which befel 
you&#44; and never can it be said that divine assistance 
was withheld to shield the remnant of the descendants 
of the Patriarchs. And you have been taught&#44; that

of mankind&#44; and out of every evil He may&#44; and does 
cause good to spring up&#44; even if the eyes of those 
who witness the event do not live to sec the ultimate 
benefit which is destined thence to arise. Who&#44; 
therefore&#44; can doubt of the mercy of bis God&#44; because 
he is sorrowing&#63; who will dare to impugn the justice 
of the Creator&#44; because he beholds those&#44; whom he 
deems evil and wicked&#44; flourishing for a while like 
the grass of the field&#63; Says the doubter&#58; &#34;I am 
told God is just&#44; merciful&#44; and beneficent&#59; and I who 
am pious&#44; upright&#44; loving God and man&#44; am suffering 
the pangs of sickness&#44; the pressure of poverty&#44; the 
loss of friends dear to my heart&#59; there is no justice 
in this.&#34; But is not this in itself sinning&#44; rebelling 
against the majesty of God&#63; who art thou&#44; worm of 
the earth&#44; that darest to criticise thy Maker&#39;s good&#8211; 
ness&#44; to doubt of his justice&#44; to accuse his mercj&#8211;&#63; 
Thou sayest that thou art suffering the pangs of sick&#8211; 
ness&#44; and that thy exertions in the service of God&#44; 
thy devotion to the good of mankind should insure 
thee a continuous state of health and capacity to la&#8211; 
bour. In other words&#44; thou deemest thyself entitled 
by a prescriptive right to a high reward because of 
thy virtue &#59; thou renderest thyself acceptable to God 
and deserving of his blessing&#59; and thou imaginest 
that thou art injured if any interruption be given to 
thy labour. &#8212; But say&#44; son of the earth&#44; is all thy striv&#8211;

tion of self&#8211;aggrandizement mingle itself in thy labours 
of love &#63; Hast thou never boasted inwardly of thy

demanded of thee &#63; has not contempt for thy fellow&#8211; 
heings often obtruded itself at the very time thou 
wast engaged in serving them V In otlier words&#44; was 
not thy virtue often sinful in part&#44; though the out&#8211; 
ward appearance betokened naught but righteous&#8211; 
ness&#63; Yet even the most righteous man that ever 
lived has sinned in this way&#44; and therefore no one 
can say that he has not incurred the just censure of 
his Creator&#59; and the afflictions of the body will thus 
tell thee&#44; O mortal man &#33; that thou art far from per&#8211; 
fection&#44; just as thy mortal frame is not exempt from 
disease and pain&#59; and that&#44; if thou wishest to be ac&#8211; 
cepted from on high&#44; thou must needs purify thy 
heart&#44; and remove thence all vain desires and pre&#8211; 
sumptuous boasting&#44; and learn that no act will ren&#8211; 
der thee worthy of divine favour&#44; unless it proceed 
entirely from a pure devotional spirit&#44; from an entire 
surrendering of thy will to the guidance of God. &#8212; 
And if the want of strength interrupt thee in thy un&#8211; 
dertaking&#44; reflect&#44; that in this visitation too the flnger 
of Goodness is seen&#44; to recall thee to thyself&#44; and to 
check the vain&#8211;gloriousness of human pride&#44; which 
supposes itself necessary almost to carry out the be&#8211; 
nevolent purposes of the Creator&#44; who surely is able 
to raise up other agents besides thee to effect his will&#59; 
for His are all the earth and its fulness&#44; and every 
being that exists has received from Him a task which 
it becomes him to execute&#44; and it was never intended 
that a few greatly gifted should monopolize all the 
deeds of mercy to which all mankind should contrib&#8211; 
ute. If therefore thou lindest that thy strength fails 
thee&#44; search deeply into thy own conduct&#59; accuse 
thyself of wrong where thou disco verest that thou

hast erred&#44; and amend thy ways that thou may est de&#8211; 
serve mercy&#59; who knows&#63; but the Lord may remove 
the evil from tlicc&#44; and send healing unto thy diseased 
limbs&#44; and restore thy strength as aforetimes. Nay&#44; 
if even thou canst not discover any thing sinful in 
thy doings &#40;which in itself is almost impossible to 
suppose&#41; &#58; then submit in this case also to the chas&#8211; 
tisement in meekness&#44; and strive to glorify thy Maker 
from the midst of pain and anguish&#44; and prove that 
it is not the mere love of reward which stimulated 
thy exertions&#44; that not merely the desire to appear 
great before man nerved thy arm&#44; and roused thy 
soul &#59; but that it was the love and fear of God which 
prompted thee to serve II im and to imitate Him in 
his deeds of mercy. And know that it is hy sorrows 
alone that the truly righteous can be probed&#44; and be 
exalted above those whose service is not sincere&#44; whose 
worship is not seated deep in the soul&#59; and that he 
who is convinced of the righteousness of God will say 
with David &#40;Psalm cxxxviii. 7&#41; &#58; &#34;Though I walk in 
the midst of trouble Thou wilt revive me&#59; Thou wilt 
stretch forth thy hand agiiinst the wrath of my ene&#8211; 
mies&#44; and thy right hand v>&#8211;iU save me.&#34; 

Or thou sayest&#44; &#34; I suffer the pressure of poverty&#33;&#34; 
Yes&#44; thou seest worldly j&#41;rosperity scattered with a 
liberal hand among thy neighbours &#59; thou art envious 
of their possessions&#44; thou iniaginest thyself entitled&#44; 
because of thy piety&#44; to an equal&#44; if not to a greater 
share of success&#44; and thou regardest thyself forgot&#8211; 
ten by God&#44; because He assigns to thee a daily task 
to obtain thy bread by the labour of thy hands. &#8212; Let 
us plead with thee. Thou art envious because others 
are rich &#33; Is this becoming one who calls himself a

iserviint of God &#63; wilt thou dictate to Ilim whom He 
shall bless&#44; to whom He shall be gracious &#33; Thou 
sayest&#44; &#34; They are wicked&#44; whereas I am righteous.&#34; 
But knowest thou correctly how far their wicked&#8211; 
ness extends &#63; hast thou the gift to search into the 
recesses of conscience&#44; and lay open to the light of 
day what passes in that dark mine of thought&#44; the 
human soul &#63; Knowest thou the private deeds of 
charity which the apparently wicked exercise &#63; or 
admit that they do no deed of mercy &#40;which again is 
almost impossible&#44; for no man is altogether lost to 
virtue&#41; &#58; still canst thou tell that the hoard of wealth&#44; 
which thou believest unworthily bestowed&#44; may not 
be destined to fall into hands which will scatter 
bounties&#44; and efl&#39;ect charities which thou dreamest 
not of&#63; Or perhaps mightest thou not become for&#8211; 
getful of thy duties&#44; were wealth to smile upon thee&#44; 
were thy coffers to be filled with gold &#63; For alas &#33; 
the example is not rare&#44; where those&#44; who once were 
ai&#41;parently pious&#44; whilst the world was unfriendly to 
them&#44; became suddenly animated by a new spirit 
when they had obtained riches&#44; and when prosperity 
flowed in upon them. &#8212; Just as was the case and is to 
this day with Israel as a nation. What a glorious spec&#8211; 
tacle did we exhibit during the ages of oppression &#33; for 
when all mankind collcagued together&#44; as it were&#44; by 
common consent to compel us to forswear our hopes 
of salvation through the blessed Only One who lives 
for eternity&#44; when nearly in every place upon the 
whole face of the eartli we were trodden upon&#44; tram&#8211; 
pled under foot&#44; because we would not bow down to 
the idols or acknowledge the false worship of the gen&#8211; 
tiles &#58; when the root of the tree of our faith was

iibumlantlj bathed in blood and its branches cease&#8211; 
lessly watered with our tears &#58; how nobly did we en&#8211; 
dure all&#44; in love&#44; humility&#44; and submission&#44; because 
we trusted in the Lord our Saviour&#44; and confided in 
his power. The louder the storm roared&#44; the more 
upraised became our prayer&#59; the darker gathered 
the clouds&#44; the more gloomy sunk the darkness &#8212; 
the brighter shone the light of our faith&#44; the holier 
beamed the faithfulness with which we clung to our 
God &#33; &#8212; But the times changed. The gentile world 
had learned to admire Israel&#39;s constancy&#44; to under&#8211; 
stand better the beauty of the system which is the 
rule of our life. The weight of oppression was lifted 
in many a land&#44; in others we were declared equal to 
the other inhabitants&#59; and we regarded the time as 
a season of the jubilee&#44; we believed that now the 
bondmen should go free&#44; and no more be heard the 
task&#8211;master&#39;s voice. And how did we repay the act 
of grace which our God had vouchsafed to us&#63; I 
say&#44; &#34; our God&#44;&#34; because is it not He who inspires 
with mercy the heart of him who feels no pity&#44; and 
softens the wrath of the tyrant&#44; as Solomon says 
&#40;Prov. xxi. 1&#41; &#58; &#34; The king&#39;s heart is in the hands of 
the Lord as the rivers of water. He turneth it whith&#8211; 
ersoever He will &#63;&#34; &#8212; Say&#44; how did we act when we 
found that enlargement had been extended to us&#63; 
Alas&#33; that truth should compel us to answer&#44; Wq 
acted ungratefully&#44; unworthily&#44; unwisely &#33; Ungrate&#8211; 
fully&#44; because instead of obeying more ardently the 
will of God&#44; we went astray upon the paths of perdi&#8211; 
tion &#59; we neglected the commandments&#44; we forsook 
the road of life &#59; and we hewed out unto ourselves 
new cisterns&#44; and filled them not with waters drawn

from the fountain whence flows the stream that re&#8211; 
freshes unto salvation&#44; but with the deceitful waters 
of bitterness which&#44; though sweet to the taste of the 
thoughtless&#44; are yet in their end death and destruc&#8211; 
tion. And how many are there wlio have rebelled 
against the Lord &#33; Do not our eyes behold the mel&#8211; 
ancholy fact that religion lies neglected&#44; that its 
teachers are unhonoured&#44; and worldly wisdom is more 
prized than its doctrines&#44; worldly greatness more 
sought than the riches of the soul to be obtained by 
the observance of the duties it enjoins&#63; &#8212; Unwor&#8211; 
thily&#44; I said &#59; for what can be more unworthy than 
disobedience and ingratitude &#63; Were a man to pre&#8211; 
sent me with a thing I ardently desire&#44; what would 
he&#44; what would you all expect from me &#63; but that I 
should not return evil for good&#44; and that&#44; on the con&#8211; 
trary&#44; I should demonstrate my gratefulness by doing 
every thing to please him. But we&#44; unworthy sons 
of Israel&#44; did not so regard our obligation to God &#33; 
our shameful ingratitude caused us to ascribe our 
safety to the change of the times&#44; to the prevalence 
of a more enlightened spirit &#59; and consequently we 
proved that we had not been deserving of the mercy 
we had received. For in place of duty there is diso&#8211; 
bedience&#59; in place of religion there is apostacy&#59; in 
place of union there is dissension &#59; in place of the 
fear of God there is dread of worldly loss&#59; in place 
of the love of our Maker there is such a love of pub&#8211; 
lic preferment and the amassing of wealth&#44; as well&#8211; 
nigh threatens to drown every feeling of religion 
which has yet escaped in the confusion and bustle of 
modern times. But does it not strike you&#44; that this 
procedure is not consonant with reason&#44; that we are

acting unwisely &#63; Let us again ask&#44; Who gave us 
enlargement&#63; and is lie who gave it not able to dis&#8211; 
pense also unto us new trials and afflictions&#63; In for&#8211; 
mer ages we have seen how the wicked&#44; who deemed 
themselves secure against the visitations denounced 
by the prophets&#44; were overwhelmed when the time 
of wrath came&#44; and how the destruction of the tem&#8211; 
ple&#44; the slaughter of millions&#44; the dismemberment 
of Israel&#39;s kingdom but too clearly evidenced that 
the Lord had felt disgust toward the sinning race&#44; 
and had determined to cast them oft&#39; because of their 
transgressions. And now we deem that his arrows 
are all expended&#63; that age has weakened his power&#63; 
that no farther will lie watch over and recompense 
our conduct&#63; He&#44; who bestows power on all that 
has being&#59; in whose hands are the destinies of all 
liis creatures&#59; whom no labour fatigues&#44; whom no 
length of years weakens &#33; And lo &#33; in the distance 
the thunder mutters &#33; rumours of afflictions have 
reached our ears from afar &#33; Israel is again threat&#8211; 
ened with danger &#59; again the persecutor has dared to 
accuse us of crimes we thought not of&#58; all&#44; all&#44; be&#8211; 
cause we have sinned. It is possible that they who 
are the objects of the persecution may not be as guilty 
themselves as we are&#44; who are here assembled &#59; but 
nevertheless we may freely say&#44; as was said in the 
days of Joshua&#44; that &#34; Israel hath sinned&#44; and they 
have also transgressed the covenant which God com&#8211; 
manded them&#44; that they have taken of the accursed 
thing&#44; have also stolen&#44; and dissembled also&#44; and 
therefore the children of Israel could not stand be&#8211; 
fore their enemies.&#34; We may accordingly aver that

awaken our attention&#44; has the enemy been permitted 
to prevail for a while against our brothers in a far&#8211; 
otf land&#44;&#42; in order to admonish us to beware of the 
wrath that is impending&#44; and to flee from the danger 
which may reach us too&#44; secure though we may be&#8211; 
lieve ourselves&#44; because protected by the arm of laws 
which regard all men as equafe. Yet&#44; are there no 
other terrors than civil persecutions &#63; is there not dis&#8211; 
ease with its gnawing pain &#63; is there not poverty which 
falls like a blight upon the labours of our hands &#63; is 
there not the spirit of melancholy which deadens the 
faculties of the brightest mind &#63; &#8212; But amidst all the 
evil we have cause to rejoice in this&#44; that one of the 
eft&#39;ects we have mentioned&#44; that of awakening our 
attention&#44; has already been happily accomplished. 
From one end of the civilized world to the other a 
simultaneous burst of sympathy has arisen from all 
the sons of Jacob in behalf of their persecuted breth&#8211; 
ren &#59; all have been taught to feel that every blow 
struck at the victims of tyranny was a blow struck 
against the happiness of the entire Jewish people&#44; 
that every cry uttered by those under torture was a 
cry which called forth a shudder over every ome 
known by the name of Israel &#33; We have been made 
conscious that we are brothers&#44; though separated by 
distance&#44; by climates&#44; and difference of government&#59; 
that we arc one people&#44; although scattered over every 
laud&#33; 0&#33; that the other object we have alluded to 
might also be accomplished&#44; that we all might&#44; being

to return unto the fold of the Lord&#44; to again submit 
ourselves to his guidance&#44; and that &#34; Ilis i&#34;od and 
his staif might comfort us&#59;&#34; that corrected by his 
jDaternal chastisement we might forsake the evil of 
our ways&#44; and receive consolation in the outpouring 
of good over all Israel&#44; and again lean on his staff 
of righteousness for support and assistance &#33; For 
then we should again be sons of Israel in truth and 
sincerity&#44; and be children of salvation &#59; inasmuch as 
then we would not have despised the chastisement 
of the Lord&#44; but been made whole through his in&#8211; 
struction and warning. 

It was always thus with our people as a nation&#44; and 
ourselves as individuals. Prosperity spoiled us&#44; but 
adversity uniformly taught us better things. It was 
said by the wise men of old&#58; &#34;An humble state is 
well&#8211;becoming unto Israel&#59;&#34; and is it not so with 
most individual members of mankind&#63; does not the 
hurry of&#44; and application to&#44; business withdraw us 
from the service of the God of all &#63; Are we not apt 
to attend to the details of our worldly concerns&#44; and 
forget that our soul too has claims upon our time and 
attention&#63; &#8212; Why then&#44; sinful man&#33; wilt thou accuse 
thy Creator of injustice because wealth is not granted 
to thee&#63; why wilt thou look with envious eye upon 
thy neighbour&#39;s flocks because they are many&#44; and 
upon his fields because they are extensive&#63; Behold&#44; 
thou in thy humble state art not without blessings. 
Thy daily toil provides thee with food&#59; the industry 
of thy hands suffices to clothe thee in decent raiment&#59;

time that to the indolent child of wealth seems never 
ending&#59; and when the holy Sabbath comes in its 
rounds to again bless the earth&#44; how heartfelt will be 
thy thankfulness that a day has been assigned thee to 
enjoy religions repose in the bosom of thy own house&#8211; 
hold&#59; and that&#44; if thou art able to teach&#44; thou canst 
toll thy brothers of the glory of the Lord&#44; and of his 
great goodness to his people Israel&#44; and of the wonders 
He has wrought in their behalf&#59; and if thou art one 
of the many to whom no such power has been given&#44; 
that thou canst go and seek instruction in the ways 
of thy Maker&#44; and learn to do his will even as com&#8211; 
manded in the law&#44; which He gave as an inheritance 
to the congregation of Jacob. &#8212; Know also that with 
the possession of wealth not every pleasure has been 
obtained&#44; and that a wise Providence has assigned to 
the poor enjoyments for which the rich often sigh in 
vain &#58; and thou wilt be ashamed&#44; that thou daredst to 
question an all&#8211;seeing Goodness&#44; for having appointed 
unto thee a lot of labour&#44; whilst to thy neighbour his 
wealth is perhaps a burden&#44; and imposes upon him 
an involuntary state of ease and indolence.

withdrawn from thee those whom thou lovest. Short&#8211;

strongly placed upon a darling child &#8212; perhaps thou

to drink deep out of the phials of afflication which others 
have to drain&#63; &#8212; Mourn then&#44; stricken one&#44; feel the 
weight of the judgement that befel thee&#58; but turn with 
repentance unto God&#44; and seek at his footstool the 
mercy thou needest&#44; and search in his holy Word for 
the consolation which is to revive thy spirit&#59; and 
learn to acknowledge that God is just in all his ways&#44; 
and that his punishments are merciful&#44; as his bounty 
is undeserved by any acts which thou canst perform. 
It were well&#44; beloved brethren&#44; if at the occurrence 
of any calamity every man were to address to him&#8211; 
self considerations like those just presented&#44; in order 
to hush within himself the tumult of rebellious 
thoughts which will often arise within us if nottimelj&#8211; 
checked. He who now speaks to you has to acknowl&#8211; 
edge&#44; that his heart has not always been free from 
the sin of searching into his Maker&#39;s views when 
sorrow visited his bosom &#59; and he at times thought 
himself almost forgotten because severe trials were 
not withheld from him&#44; because the common lot of 
man reached him too. &#8212; But let us reflect&#44; have we 
not also our blessings&#44; each of us&#44; as well as our 
griefs&#63; Go and look about yon even in the wretched 
hovels of poverty&#44; and you will be convinced that 
more good might have been enjoyed by the unfor&#8211; 
tunate inmates&#44; had they but properly used the bless&#8211; 
ings placed within their reach. We arraign&#44; there&#8211; 
fore&#44; not unfrequently the goodness of Providence&#44; 
whilst we ourselves are the enemies of our peace&#59; and 
as was done by Elijah who&#44; when called by Ahab

that ye have forsaken the coriimanclnieiits of the 
Lord&#34; &#40;1 Kings xviii. 18&#41;&#58; the sinner shoukl always 
be rebuked&#44; because he it is who converts the good 
he has received or might receive into curses and afflic&#8211; 
tions. &#8212; And then&#44; why should we compare our lot 
with those more blessed than ourselves in order to 
excite discontent&#44; when we might think ourselves 
happy in comparison with millions whose fate is by 
far more deplorable than ours &#63; &#8212; Besides this we are 
all apt to believe that&#44; because others have what we 
need&#44; they ought to be more content than we&#59; but 
they perhaps envy us some quality of mind or body 
for which they would gladly sacrifice the half of that 
wealth for which we envy them. Believe me one 
thing&#44; none is altogether happy&#44; none on the other 
hand entirely forsaken. The Creator regards alike 
all his works&#59; to his all&#8211;seeing eye nothing is con&#8211; 
cealed &#59; the exalted are within his ken and power&#44;

the day of trouble. Were it now&#44; that the Blessed 
One had to act with human means&#59; were it that his ca&#8211; 
pacities were stinted&#44; because He had bestowed many 
gifts upon a few&#59; were it that his memory could be&#8211; 
come weakened by the length of time which has 
elapsed since the deeds of wickedness which we con&#8211; 
demn in the successful sinner were perpetrated&#59; or&#44; 
since we did those acts which religion demands of us &#58; 
then indeed might we excuse our littleness of faith&#44; 
our presumption in accusing Him of a want of mercy&#44; 
of neglect of justice. But see we not with our own 
eyes his unending power&#63; do we not beliold daily his 
bounty scattered far and wide&#44; over earth and ocean&#44; 
over mountain and plain&#44; over city and field&#63; Do we

And have delight in the Lord&#44; and lie will give thee

accomplish it.&#34; xxxvii. 5.

had to flee from the country like one stained with 
crime&#44; and no shelter could he find in the land which 
he Vas destined to rule. He was denounced to his 
revengeful enemy&#44; and his steps were watched wher&#8211; 
ever he went. It must have been under these cir&#8211; 
cumstances which tested his sincerity&#44; his conlidence 
in God&#44; that he composed many of his songs of praise&#44; 
it was under such a state of trial that his soul was 
filled with the holy spirit&#44; and reproving in himself 
the weakness of faith&#44; he says&#44; &#34; Commit unto the

world stands&#44; David&#39;s songs and David&#39;s hopes will

God&#33; &#8212; Read&#44; I pray you&#44; the whole of the Psalm 
from which our text was quoted&#44; and you will rise 
refreshed in faith and resignation&#44; yon will feel some 
of the inspiration which dictated it&#44; even when you 
are suftering&#39;&#44; and you see those exalted whom you 
call wicked &#58; and you will become sincerely convinced 
that it ill becomes you&#44; the creatures of God&#44; to sit in 
judgment upon his government of the world. &#8212; You 
will be impressed&#44; if you judge calmly and reflect with 
humility&#44; that you have suffered no injustice&#44; that 
your case has not been forgotten by your Creator&#44; 
and that the evil you have to endure is a just visita&#8211; 
tion for your manifold sins&#44; and that your Redeemer 
lives to send you enlargement whenever in his judg&#8211; 
ment you deserve a return of his mercy. Be it there&#8211; 
fore your constant study to be content with 3&#39;our lot&#59; 
cfo your best by labour and industry to improve your 
condition &#59; and if success does not then follow&#44; be 
sure that an humble station is best for 3&#39;ou&#44; and the 
sphere assigned to you by Providence to contribute 
therein your portion to the improvement of the world. 
But above all&#44; do not grow careless of God&#39;s com&#8211; 
mands&#44; imagine not that the way of evil can become by 
any excuse the road to preferment. No&#44; let each one 
be mindful of the injunction &#34;Commit thy way unto 
the Lord &#59;&#34; do your part as becomes his servants&#44; live 
under and according to the law&#44; obey strictly its pre&#8211; 
cepts&#59; &#34; trust in Ilim&#59;&#34; be satisfied with the judgment 
that is dispensed unto you&#44; be convinced that all 
THAT IS IS RIGHT&#44; although you do not readilj&#39; discover 
HOW this is. And if you in all your ways know the 
Lord&#44; remain steadfast amidst trials&#44; faithful in the 
midst of sickness and pains&#44; upright in poverty&#44; and

humble when fortune smiles &#58; be then sure that God 
will do according to his promise&#44; send his blessing on 
the work of your hands&#44; become your Physician in 
diseases&#44; your Support in poverty&#44; your Stay in the 
hour of success&#44; and your Comforter in sorrow. Such 
thoughts&#44; such hopes&#44; such a faith will render your 
life tranquil&#44; and make you as nearly sinless as mor&#8211; 
tals can be&#44; and make easy for you the hour of death&#44; 
when your soul must return to the God who gave it&#59; 
and thus purified by virtue and faith you will become 
sons of everlasting life&#44; inheritors of bliss without 
measure. 

O God of Israel &#33; be with us during our pilgrimage 
in this life of sorrow and trial&#59; let thy countenance 
shine to us when evil is sent&#44; and subdue our stub&#8211; 
born heart to thy service&#44; so that we may glorify Thee&#44; 
and proclaim thy goodness to all mankiud&#44; unto whom 
and unto us we pray Thee to send peace and salva&#8211;

and condemn us not altliough we have sinned. For 
well we know our disobedience and hardness of heart&#44; 
and that knowing the good we have preferred the 
evil&#44; and chosen the path of death&#44; altliongh the way 
of life lay open before us. Yet Thou art ever ready 
to receive the repentant child &#33; Spare us then&#44; O our 
Father&#33; and lead us by mild visitation to recognize 
the sinfulness of our ways&#44; and teach us to deserve 
thy mercy by a sincere return unto thy service&#44; even 
as Thou hast commanded us through Moses thy ser&#8211; 
vant. Amen. 

Brethren&#33; 

We find in the portion of the law we have read 
this day the following&#58; 

&#34; Behold&#44; I lay before thee this day the life and the good&#44; and the 
death and the evil.&#34; Deut. xxx. 15. 

Moses&#44; as we all know&#44; had been employed in teach&#8211; 
ing the people the will of the Lord&#44; and informed them 
how and when they were to engage in what is called 
divine service&#44; and how and when they were to ab&#8211; 
stain from certain acts which are called disobedience 
to the commands of God. Every opportunity had 
been seized during a period of forty years to again 
and again urge upon the children of Israel the neces&#8211; 
sity of a compliance with whatever had been taught 
them&#44; and the danger which attended a disregard of 
the divine behests. They had also been informed&#44; 

<pb n="211"/>

THE WAY OF LIFE. 211 

that the Lord purposed their happiness&#44; and not his 
own aggrandizement&#44; and that&#44; by choosing them as 
his people&#44; He merely intended to set them up as 
living monuments of his power and goodness to the 
other nations of the earth. And now&#44; when but a 
few hours of earthly life were left to our great 
teacher&#44; when but few more words of instruction 
were to flow from his lips &#58; he addressed the Isra&#8211; 
elites who knew him to be standing on the threshold 
of eternity&#44; &#40;since the forty years from the Exodus 
were just then drawing to a close&#44;&#41; in the above 
memorable words. Behold &#33; our blessed lawgiver 
at the head of the people &#8212; sinking into the grave 
with strength undiminished and eye unclouded&#44; not 
dying because of the weakness of age&#44; or the debility 
of sickness&#44; but simply because by a just decree he 
had been doomed for a want of obedience on 07ie oc&#8211; 
casion only not to enter the promised land&#44; &#8212; exhort&#8211; 
in 2&#58; his hearers to follow the road of the law he had 
marked out for them&#44; and to hand down this law to 
their descendants for ever as the code which it be&#8211; 
hoved them to obey. And if any one of all these 
were now to have asked&#44; &#34;&#34;Why should he obey the 
precepts of the law&#63;&#34; the prophet says&#58; &#34;Behold I 
lay before thee this day the life and the good.&#34; If 
you wish to obtain the life&#44; adopt the good &#59; that is 
to say&#44; by obedience only can life everlasting be ob&#8211; 
tained&#59; by obedience only can life on earth be ren&#8211; 
dered happy. Look upon the ways of men&#44; upon 
the passions which agitate&#44; upon the desires which 
impel them&#44; and you will not iind that they lead unto 
life. Go&#44; brethren &#33; and mix among the crowds that 
throng the streets&#44; with the inmates of lordly palaces

and the tenants of the abodes of wretchedness&#44; and 
see whether tlieir nnhappiness proceeds from obedi&#8211; 
ence to our law or from a neglect thereof. Look upon 
the drunkard&#44; he transgresses the law by converting 
the blessings of God into means of degrading himself 
to the level of the beast &#58; has he life &#63; Alas no &#33; they 
even&#44; who love him and are depending in a measure 
upon the labour of his hands for their support&#44; are 
themselves among the number of those who must re&#8211; 
gard his death as a blessing more than an affliction &#59; 
for he is a burden to himself&#44; a disgrace to his family&#44; 
and an outcast from the society of the good. And 
when his end draws near&#44; when his substance is wast&#8211; 
ed&#44; when his steps are tottering though he is young 
in years&#44; when his wife and children are dressed in 
the habiliments of wretchedness&#44; and he looks with 
dread upon their helpless state &#58; how glad would he 
be&#44; could he recall the past years of sin&#44; and how 
willingly would he now&#44; if he were permitted to live 
his life over again&#44; fulfil the injunction&#44; &#34;Ye shall 
therefore be holy&#44; for I am holy.&#34; &#40;Leviticus xi. 44.&#41; 
&#8212; Yet in the days of his strength and joyousness he 
did not regard with horror the intoxicating bowl &#59; he 
poured out the wine&#44; say at the festive board&#44; and 
watched its beautiful purling with the eye of fond&#8211; 
ness&#59; he admired its fine colour&#44; praised its age and 
vintage&#44; and dwelt with rapture upon its delightful 
flavour. Little did he then dream that the delicious 
cup would deprive him of wealth&#44; of friends&#44; of repu&#8211; 
tation&#44; and bring him in poverty and sorrow to an 
early grave. Say&#44; how came this to pass&#63; Simply 
because he used that which has been bestowed on 
man as an occasional indulgence or a strengthening

stimulant&#44; as an cvery&#8211;day drink&#44; and when it was 
not required to assist the process of nature&#44; regarding 
only its agreeable qualities&#44; without heeding the dan&#8211; 
gers that follow its immoderate use. lie drank at 
first perhaps only when in society of friends to any 
extent&#59; he next craved an equal share when alone in 
his house&#59; until by degrees his vitiated taste could 
be satisfied by nothing but habitual drinking&#44; which 
naturally disqualified him for any rational occupation&#44; 
and rendered him a spectacle of horror and a by&#8211; 
word&#44; as one who chose death&#44; when life was within 
his reach. 

Or watch the man of deceit&#44; who by a fair outward 
appearance endeavours to impose upon the credulity 
of his neighbour&#58; has he life&#63; Certainly not. He 
imagines perhaps that his superior cunning entitles 
him to prey upon the ignorant and confiding. He 
accordingly lays his schemes with a far&#8211;reaching view 
of self&#8211;aggrandizement&#44; with a single eye to his own 
supposed interests. He watches with anxious care&#44; 
with sleepless nights&#44; every avenue which might lead 
to detection&#59; now apparently his prosperity stands 
unmoved&#59; he reaps a golden harvest&#59; he speaks with 
evident charity of the suftcrings of the needy&#59; he is 
foremost in acts of benevolence &#59; talks with compas&#8211; 
sion of the foibles and sins of others&#44; as though he 
were indeed a man of truth and righteousness. Yet 
he is at heart full of anxiety &#59; he suspects every one 
that approaches as likely to become the instrument 
of detection&#59; but all his acts are unavailing&#59; justice&#44; 
though slow&#44; points at him at last as a traitor to the 
social compact &#58; and when he stands exposed to the 
world as a deceitful sinner&#44; when&#44; deprived of his ill&#8211;

gotten wealth&#44; he roams over the earth a fugitive and 
alone&#44; his steps pursued by tliousands panting for his 
punishment&#44; he will bitterly lament the moment that 
he lost sight of the divine command which says&#44; &#34; Ye 
shall not steal&#44; neither deal falsely&#44; nor lie to one 
andthor.&#39;&#39; &#40;Lev. xix. 11.&#41; &#8212; And yet this man was 
born innocent as we all were &#59; and many years after 
his entrance into life he must have remained unstained 
by the crimes which banish him now from society &#59; 
and only because he confided more in his own inge&#8211; 
nuity&#44; because he had not sufficient faith in the word 
of God&#44; he was induced to seek prosperity by injuring 
his brother &#59; and his punishment will therefore teach 
us&#44; that avarice and fraud&#44; though cloaked by the 
mantle of outward sanctity&#44; are not conducive to that 
happiness and contentment which to obtain should 
be the chief aim of our thoughts and labours&#44; and 
which can be reached only in the pursuit of righteous&#8211; 
ness&#44; which is found in the precepts of the religion 
bestowed by the Lord upon Lsrael. 

Or look upon the man who stands on the pinnacle 
of glory&#44; the conqueror before wliose bloody sword 
thousands of slain have fallen&#44; the tyrant whose frown 
strikes terror into all who surround him&#58; has he life&#63; 
If earthly greatness could confer this boon&#59; if im&#8211; 
mense wealth could furnish happiness&#59; if flattery of 
abject slaves&#44; the homage of conquered kingdoms 
could insure content &#58; then indeed might we say that 
he had found the treasure we are commanded to seek. 
But does power render us immortal&#63; does wealth con&#8211; 
fer satisfaction &#63; do flattery and homage prevent the 
assault of revenge or stay the hand of the prowling 
assassin &#63; Where then is the life of the mightiest

potentate who rises by murder and violence &#63; O no &#33; 
he has not life&#44; nor content&#44; nor satisfaction. For 
how can he expect the first&#44; when he has spilt wan&#8211; 
tonly much innocent blood&#44; and rendered desolate 
many a happy&#44; peaceful home&#63; Pie only regarded 
himself in his search for renown &#59; he forgot his mor&#8211; 
tality&#44; and that he too must appear&#44; to render an ac&#8211; 
count of his deeds done whilst in the flesh&#44; before the 
supreme King of kings&#44; the Holy One who alone reigns 
over all&#59; and therefore the unerring and infallible de&#8211; 
cree of the Judge of all flesh will consign him to that 
doom which his misdeeds merit. &#8212; But even before 
his final condemnation&#44; he enjoys not content nor 
satisfaction. &#8212; In the people whom he oppresses he 
can place no confidence&#44; and he is constantly in dread 
of their rising to expel him from the throne which he 
disgraces&#59; &#8212; the kingdoms which he has conquered 
will continually strive to throw ofi&#42; the galling yoke 
which he has imposed on them&#59; and he can only 
hope to keep both in subjection by an unceasing vigi&#8211; 
lance and often by increased exactions&#59; for&#44; the course 
of violence once beo&#8211;un&#44; it is difficult to know where 
to stop &#59; and thus he is continually a prey to anxious 
care and terrors &#59; and gladly would he choose a brief 
space of contentment&#44; no matter what the price might 
be. Therefore although he is raised high&#44; and de&#8211; 
spite the extent of his power&#44; he will yet have cause 
to feel that disobedience to the law is not the way of 
life&#44; and that the king even cannot disobey with im&#8211; 
punity the commandment implied in the words of 
Holy Writ which says&#44; &#34; That his heart be not lifted 
up above his brethren&#44; and that he turn not aside from 
the commandment&#44; to the right or to the left.&#34; &#40;Deut.

xvii. 20.&#41; Yet he too &#8212; how happy might he have 
been&#44; had he not lent his ear to advice of the wicked 
who crouch at the footstool of power &#33; had he not 
been misled by the glitter of outward splendour which 
necessarily accompanies his station &#33; Peaceful neigh&#8211; 
bours would have served him better than the enraged 
conquered can do&#59; a grateful country would have 
blessed a wise and virtuous ruler&#59; and an approving 
conscience and a well&#8211;founded faith in the Sovereign 
of the universe would have rendered bis sleep as un&#8211; 
disturbed and tranquil as that of the labourer when 
he has finished bis daily toil. &#8212; And of one thing 
be sure&#44; brethren&#33; that human greatness never has 
blessed with peace any one who bad not the heavenly 
light within him&#59; and it matters not whether it be a 
Pharaoh standing abashed before the august prophet 
when confessing his guilt&#59; an Ahab when he met 
Elijah after saying for no cause Naboth the Jezreelite&#59; 
a Nebuchadnezzar when be was compelled to herd 
with the beasts of the field that he might be taught 
humility&#59; a Caesar when he fell at the foot of Pompey&#39;s

attempted his own life &#59; or a Napoleon dying an exile 
upon a lonely isle &#58; &#8212; all have felt that the chase after 
glory&#44; unawed by the standard which God has given&#44; 
is sure sooner or later to produce the fruits of bitter&#8211; 
ness&#44; and lead to death and destruction. 

Nor are riches&#44; and wisdom&#44; and the pursuit of 
pleasure&#44; and the indulgence in carnal desires&#44; the 
sources of life. The possession of the first leaves to 
those&#44; who view them as essentials to happiness&#44; ji

half of their desire accomplished. &#8212; Or speak of world&#8211; 
ly wisdom&#58; and can you point out one among the 
whole crowd of philosophers&#44; from the most remote 
antiquity to our own days&#44; who either was happy 
through its possession only&#44; or heloved by the unwise 
for no other cause than his learning&#63;&#8212; Or tell me of 
pleasures &#58; who did ever exist that had tasted enough 
of the varied joys which this Hfe affords&#44; or who could 
say with truth&#44; that the most exquisite pleasure did 
not always leave a melancholy impression upon the 
soul&#63; We will not enlarge at present by an investi&#8211; 
gation of the subject&#44; but will merely demand&#44; whether 
the happiest of mortals ever found what may with 
truth be called life in the pursuit of pleasure&#44; from 
his infancy to the moment of his death&#44; even if no 
cloud should ever have darkened his horizon&#44; or pain 
marred his enjoyment &#63;&#8212; And with regard to indul&#8211; 
gence in carnal desires and the following of the dic&#8211; 
tates of the passions&#44; it is almost superfluous to assign 
any reason why they cannot offer life. Pot let a man 
but commence a course predicated upon such rules&#44; 
if rules they may be called&#44; and what will be his end&#63; 
premature decay&#44; and early death on the one&#44; and 
an ignominious punishment for laws transgressed and 
rights trampled on&#44; on the other hand. 

In following up these investigations it will become 
manifest to you that&#44; if we commit ourselves to the 
allurements of the external world&#44; and have no regard 
to any guidynce save that presented by our own rea&#8211; 
son&#44; interest&#44; appetite&#44; or passion&#44; our life must pass 
away very unsatisfactorily to ourselves and profitless 
to others. The destructive operation of these false 
guides upon ourselves we have already traced &#59; and

can you name any benefit or service which the vain 
egotist who isprond of his learning&#44; the sordid seeker 
alter wealth&#44; the glutton and drunkard&#44; and the self&#8211; 
sufficient oppressor&#44; can confer on others by the mere 
pursuit of their selfish ends&#63; On the contrary&#44; every 
act of theirs&#44; if it have any eflect at all&#44; must be more 
or less injurious to society&#44; and the annals of the 
world and the records of crime furnish us with thou&#8211; 
sands of instances to prove the truth of this assertion. 
&#8212; But turn we now to the man who seeks to shape 
his course by the law of God&#44; and we shall see an en&#8211; 
tirely different result springing from his labours. Let 
us regard him as the father of a family. He is there 
temperate in the use of things&#44; even those not prohib&#8211; 
ited by the law&#59; he never exhibits himself before his 
children in a manner that they must despise their pa&#8211; 
rent&#59; he is the friend not the tyrant of his wife&#59; he is 
a kind master over his servants&#44; and imposes no un&#8211; 
necessary burdens upon his subordinates&#44; knowing 
that they are like him servants and children of Om&#8211; 
nipotence&#44; who merit&#44; and therefore should receive&#44; 
kind and generous treatment from those who employ 
their labour. He instructs his family in the path they 
should go &#59; he watches their conduct &#59; and because 
he spends all the time not necessary for his out&#8211;door 
occupations in his own home&#44; at his own peaceful fire&#8211; 
side&#44; he has ample opportunity to correct whatever of 
he may discover&#59; and thus he is not only the pa&#8211; 
rent of his offspring&#44; but is likewise&#44; con&#8211; 
with the mother&#44; the spiritual guide of the 
God has given him. &#8212; Who sees not in

fairly with all men &#59; he uses no subterfuges or artful 
tricks to enhance unduly the price of his wares in the 
eyes of others&#59; lie makes no false representation of 
any kind so as to deceive with regard to the extent of 
his means&#59; in competing with his neighbours he will 
never undervalue their merchandise or throw a slight

when any unforeseen misfortune should occur&#44; he will 
treat all alike who have claims upon him&#44; and prefer 
honourable poverty &#39;to dishonourable wealth gotten 
by fraud&#44; deception&#44; or concealment. In his pursuit 
of gain&#44; which in itself is both lawful and praise&#8211; 
worthy&#44; he will place unlimited confidence in the 
blessing of God&#44; and transact his business so that&#44; in 
giving to each m&#58;in what is his due&#44; he will also direct 
his views to the commands contained in Scripture&#44; 
and give to the poor according to his means &#59; support&#44; 
as becomes him&#44; the service of his Maker and the 
schools of instruction whence virtue&#44; knowledge&#44; and 
piety are scattered abroad &#59; and when the time of rest 
arrives he will cease speaking of his worldly aff&#39;airs 
and refrain from pursuing his usual avocations&#44; but

resort with those who are of his household to the 
places where the sons of Israel meet to pray&#44; and 
where the holy law is proclaimed freely and openly 
to all who may come. &#8212; Such a course is surely one 
of much peace and enjoyment&#44; and the certain re&#8211; 
ward will be the obtainraent of life&#44; &#8212; the life of the 
soul&#44; and the possession of tranquillity and content&#59; 
for thus says the text &#58; &#34; A perfect and just weight 
shalt thou have&#44; a perfect and just measure shalt thou 
have&#44; that thy days may be lengthened in the land 
which the Lord thy God giveth thee.&#34; &#40;Deut. xxv. 15.&#41; 
Again&#44; place a servant of God in an exalted sta&#8211; 
tion&#59; and what will his conduct be&#63; lie will look 
upon himself as a dependent upon a superior Author&#8211; 
ity&#44; as a representative of a higher Power&#44; to dispense&#44; 
in a limited degree&#44; because of human weakness&#44; jus&#8211; 
tice and mercy to all who may come under his super&#8211; 
vision. He will not rule harshly over those placed 
under his control&#44; and not impose unnecessary bur&#8211; 
dens upon the people&#59; but knowing his accountabil&#8211; 
ity he will govern with moderation&#44; endeavour to 
instil true piety and submission to divine rule&#44; and 
promote peace and good&#8211;will among the cljildron of 
men. Shall I name you instances &#63; Then look upon 
Abraham &#59; he called himself dust and ashes&#44; and yet 
he was first that proclaimed aloud the greatness of 
God&#59; and what was his reward&#63; not alone that the 
Lord made with him a covenant to be a Protector to 
him and his seed after him&#44; but the gentiles too ac&#8211; 
knowledged their indebtedness to the peaceful shep&#8211; 
herd&#44; and called him &#34; a prince of God among them&#44;&#39;&#42; 
and sought his friendship for themselves and their 
descendants after them. &#8212; Then we had a Joseph who&#44;

raised to the throne from a prison&#44; forgot not the fear 
of God&#44; when they who had deeply injured him were 
in his power. &#8212; Not to speak of JNIoses&#44; who was the 
meekest of men&#44; and to whom no other man ever yet 
was equal&#58; we may claim David&#44; who&#44; though he oc&#8211; 
casionally sinned&#44; and thus proved by his example 
the efficacy of repentance&#44; was nevertheless a devoted 
adherent to the Lord&#44; and called down upon himself 
and his house the punishment of sin&#44; rather than that 
the people over whom he had been called to rule 
should sutler. And who does not remember David&#63; 
who that is of Israel&#39;s stock but proudly claims a 
share in the son of Jesse &#63; &#8212; And not to extend our 
inquiries too far&#44; let us call to mind one more Israel&#8211; 
ite&#44; the virtuous Josiah&#44; who purified the land of idol&#8211; 
atry&#44; repented because he was certified of the will of 
God&#44; and was the means of a renewed spirit of devo&#8211; 
tion in Palestine. Much was he loved&#44; and his early 
death was deplored by the poet and seer&#44; the prophet 
Jeremiah. &#8212; And of those who are aliens to our race 
vjQ may also number many who have done honour to 
the image of God which they bore. We instance a 
Grecian Aristides&#44; a Roman Cincinnatus&#44; an Alfred 
of England&#44; and the good Washington&#44; a man evi&#8211; 
dently the instrument of Providence to effect a great 
change in the opinions and customs of men&#44; and who 
with but a small sacrifice of human life was the means 
of establishing a powerful state&#44; where freedom and 
civilization might find a home&#44; and Israelites dwell 
safely with none to be a hinderance to them or their 
faith. &#8212; It is thus that at the height of human power 
a regard to the law will insure the happiness of the 
individual as well as of those connected with him&#59;

and as says the psalm &#58; &#34; Lord I the king will be glad 
in thy strength&#44; and in thy salvation how greatly will 
he rejoice &#33; &#8212; He asked life of Thee&#44; and Thou gavest 
it to him &#8212; length of days for ever and ever. &#8212; For the

And say&#44; who would not sooner be an Abraham&#44; the 
shepherd&#8211;chief and the founder of our now scattered 
nation&#44; than a Nimrod&#44; the builder of mighty cities&#44; 
the renowned ruler of remote antiquity &#63; &#8212; a Moses 
rather&#44; whose grave is not known&#44; than a tyrant Pha&#8211; 
raoh&#44; for whose corpse a pyramid was raised as a suit&#8211; 
able burial&#8211;place&#63; or prefer being a Josiah&#44; the re&#8211; 
storer of the worship&#44; than a Nebuchadnezzar who 
overthrew cities and kingdoms &#63; And lastly&#44; to bring 
the matter closer to our own days&#44; let us ask&#44; who of 
proper feeling does not believe the fame of Washing&#8211; 
ton&#44; who retired from power when his services were 
no longer needed&#44; more enviable than the renown of 
Napoleon&#44; who could not rest till he had usurped the 
dominion over a people he pretended to honour&#44; and 
become the terror of many nations&#44; who at length 
combined and hurled him from a throne erected upon 
the bodies of shiin millions&#63; &#8212; Is it not evident&#44; that 
a ruler governing in humility is a blessing&#63; and that 
he earns life for himself when his race is run&#44; and 
can enjoy content and peace whilst yet on earth&#44; be&#8211; 
cause he has obtained the satisfaction of his God&#44; 
and is secure in the love of those over whom he is 
placed&#63; 

Upon the whole it will be apparent to you&#44; beloved 
brethren&#44; that the way pointed out by our blessed re&#8211; 
ligion is the road of life and happiness &#59; that the acts

it prohibits are tlie paths of death and evil &#33;&#8212; If now 
we want to know&#44; &#34;How are we to obtain hfe&#63;&#34; it 
necessarily becomes our duty to investigate the holy 
Scriptures to enable us to obtain the requisite infor&#8211; 
mation. And what does Moses say in continuation 
of our text &#63; &#34; In that I command thee this day to love 
the Lord thy God&#44; to walk in his ways&#44; and to keep 
his commands&#44; and his statutes and his judgments&#59; 
tliat thou mayest live and multiply&#44; and that the Lord 
thy God will bless thee in the land whither thou goest 
to possess it.&#34; Whoever therefore Avishes to obtain 
the boon of life&#44; must correct at every stage of his 
being&#44; every evil propensity he may discover within 
himself&#59; he must watch his passions&#44; subdue his in&#8211; 
clinations&#44; and restrain the advice which interest and 
self&#8211;aggrandizement might whisper into his soul. At 
every occurrence of life he should ask himself whether 
the contemplated action is in consonance with the 
ways of God&#44; whether the deed intended be one of 
mercy&#44; of righteousness&#44; of benevolence and justice. 
If called upon by any circumstance whatever to do 
any thing&#44; be it great or small&#44; he should first con&#8211; 
sult the Bible&#44; to discover whether or not it is agree&#8211; 
able to the commandments&#44; statutes and judgments 
of the Lord &#59; or rather&#44; as we are continually and un&#8211; 
expectedly compelled to be active&#44; it is evidently and 
unavoidably necessary that we be prepared before&#8211; 
hand&#44; and make ourselves constantly more familiar 
with our duties&#44; both by inquiring from others and a 
constant study of the word of God for ourselves&#44; so 
that we may be able to act rightly whenever the time 
of action may come. If then our peace is threatened 
by the allurements of the world&#44; we shall in this man&#8211;

ner be prepured to stand tirrnly&#44; unmoved and obe&#8211; 
dient&#44; amidst the tumult of passion&#44; interest&#44; and am&#8211; 
bition. The dazzling glitter of folly nniy then strive 
to entice us onward to death&#59; but the steady light 
of God&#39;s truth will point out the way whicli leads unto 
salvation. So also says the prophet&#58; &#34;I call heaven 
and earth as witnesses against you this day&#59; the life 
and the death&#44; the blessing and the curse I have set 
before thee &#59; but do thou choose the life&#44; that thou 
mayest live&#44; thou and thy seed&#44;&#34; 

Let no nuiu therefore plead in extenuation of his 
sinning&#44; that he is much tempted&#44; that he is engaged 
in active business pursuits&#44; that the commands of the 
law are not suited to his taste&#44; that his high station 
exempts him from obedience&#44; &#8212; nothing of this nature 
will plead his excuse for disobeying the will of the 
supreme King. For if we are much tempted&#44; we 
should place before us in lively colours&#44; that momeut&#8211; 
are gratification will be followed by long years of re&#8211; 
pentance&#44; sorrow&#44; and perhaps sickness&#44; death&#44; and 
condemnation of the guilty soul &#59; that habits of evil 
are gradually acquired from trilling and small begin&#8211; 
nings&#59; and that at last every sin will not only make 
us amenable to the vengeance of Heaven&#44; but will 
likewise render more difficult for us the ascent to the 
mountain of the Lord&#44; where is the holy mansion of 
the righteous who have done his will. &#8212; If we are en&#8211; 
gaged in active business&#44; the greater is our need of 
divine consolation. So many are the vicissitudes to 
which we are hourly exposed&#44; so many dangers con&#8211; 
tinually surround us &#58; that we ought to have peace 
and life within&#44; to resist the blast which at some time 
to come must assail us from without &#59; and where can 

<pb n="225"/>

THE WAY OF LIFE. 225 

this peace be found except in obedience&#44; and piety&#44; 
and a reliance on divine assistance&#44; as we have shown&#63; 
If the words of Scripture are not palatable to us&#44; can 
this be an excuse for our transgressing&#63; O wo&#44; on 
the sinful folly&#44; that seeks to place itself above the 
balm of life &#33; If we have any doubts&#44; if our faith is 
feeble&#44; let us apply ourselves with double diligence 
to investigate the precepts of the law &#59; let us prostrate 
ourselves before the foot of Mercy&#44; and ask for light 
to dispel our darkness&#44; for grace to combat our un&#8211; 
belief. For when proper devotion has taken posses&#8211; 
sion of our hearts&#44; we will readily embrace the scheme 
which God has laid before us&#59; we will choose it as 
the way of life&#44; in which alone we can move onward 
to happiness. &#8212; And if our exalted station would in&#8211; 
stil pride into our spirit&#44; and mislead us to forget our 
accountability &#58; then let us call to mind how soon 
over the mightiest in genius and power the rod of 
confusion may be stretched out&#44; and how speedily 
our highest power and brightest wisdom must yield 
to the conqueror of the most renowned conquerors&#44; 
and the destroyer of the wisest philosopher&#44; the ter&#8211; 
rible but sure&#8211;coming angel of death. 

If thus now we survey the evils attending on sin 
and the happiness consequent upon obedience&#44; and 
call to mind that earthly gifts will soon fade and vanish 
from our grasp&#44; or we be taken from them&#59; and that 
at last we are in the hands of Him who gave us the 
law of life&#58; we must be penetrated with devotion and 
a willing spirit to yield ourselves as subjects to the 
yoke of the law. To us the choice is given&#44; &#8212; we have 
before us life and the good&#44; death and the evil &#58; there 
is no power on earth to prevent our choosing wisely.

In thy law&#44; our God&#33; Thou hast written&#44; that 
even in the lands of our enemies Thou wouldst not 
cast us away&#44; nor abhor us&#44; to destroy us utterly and 
to break thy covenant with us. We beseech Thee

now to fnltil thy word&#44; aiul to keep alive in our hearts 
the sense of our duty and the remembrance of our 
covenant with Thee&#44; so that we may be awakened to 
a knowledge of the sinfulness of our backsliding from 
thy righteous commands. And do Thou&#44; O omnipo&#8211; 
tent King &#33; not withhold from us thy protection and 
goodness&#59; but guard us when enemies assail us in 
their wrath and pride&#44; and shield the worm of Jacob 
from the merciless persecutor&#44; wbo lies in wait for 
thy heritage. And in thy mercy do Thou forgive 
our sins unwittingly committed&#44; our wilful transgres&#8211; 
sions&#44; and our presumptuous iniquity&#44; and wash us 
clean by thy grace from the pollution of rebellious 
disobedience. Yes&#44; do Thou purify us&#44; that we may 
be pure&#44; and stand before Thee renovated with a new 
heart and a new spirit to serve thee alone&#44; O our 
God&#33; who art our Father&#44; our Creator&#44; our Shepherd&#44; 
our Guardian for ever. Amen &#33; 

Brethren &#33; 

In my last address I attempted briefly to exhibit 
the beauties of a holy life&#44; the happiness attending 
on obedience&#44; and the evils consequent upon a dere&#8211; 
liction from the path of duty pointed out by the law. 
It was there shown to you that piety has so many 
attractions to the rightly thinking&#44; that it is but rea&#8211; 
sonable to expect that every well&#8211;informed person 
should as a matter of choice become pious. &#8212; Yet the 
fact cannot be denied&#44; that piety is not loved by all&#44; 
and that religion is more praised than practised&#59; or 
in other words&#44; that mankind fail to reach happiness&#44; 
and reap misery&#44; temporary and lasting&#44; as the reward 
for their actions. It would appear almost&#44; that&#44; were 

<pb n="228"/>

228 SALVATION THROUGH REPENTANCE. 

WO to take an accoiuit merely of the outward pursuits 
of mankiud&#44; they liad no idea whatever of the im&#8211; 
portance of a religious life&#44; so much are they engaged 
in pursuits foreign to piety&#44; and in occupations which 
seem to absorb all the faculties and energies&#44; with 
which they have been endowed by the God of nature. 
&#8212; If God now were to judge as men judge&#44; if He were 
to condemn as mortals condemn&#44; who of all the living 
could hope for mercy&#63; For do we not daily see how 
sin is heaped upon sin&#44; iniquity upon iniquity&#44; rebel&#8211; 
lion upon rebellion&#63; We crave the evil that is pro&#8211; 
hibited&#44; even if we do not practise it&#59; and whenever 
the least excuse can be discovered for transgressing&#44; 
we yield to our craving&#44; and openly contemn the 
divine commandments. This is the course of folly&#44; 
of forgetfulness of our duties&#44; which so many of us 
pursue&#44; in which nearly all incur the guilt of sin. Is 
there one now who has never sinned&#44; in thought&#44; in 
word&#44; or action&#63; &#34;Wlio can say&#44; that his heart is pure 
from deceit&#44; his moutli from wicked words&#44; his hands 
from sinful deeds&#63; Truly&#44; we see the good&#44; but clioose 
the evil&#59; the road of life is clearly pointed out to us 
in the law&#44; but we walk in the path of death. We 
surrender ourselves slaves to our unholy desires&#44; and 
close our ears against the admonition which the words 
of Scripture constantly address to us. We say&#44; there&#8211; 
fore&#44; that if God were to judge us as mortals judge&#44; &#39; 
no one would be justified&#44; no one could hope to see 
the life everlasting. But He is mindful of our frame&#44; 
He remembers that we are dust&#44; and will not cut off 
the sinner utterly&#44; although his deeds merit visita&#8211; 
tion. On the contrary He gives him opportunities to 
again merit favour&#44; and to retrieve the errors he has 

<pb n="229"/>

SALVATION THROUGH REPENTANCE. 229 

committed. In other words&#44; the sinner lias received 
a remedy by which he can again obtain divine mercy&#58; 
this remedy is &#34;repentance.&#34; Let us explain&#58; Every 
act which we do&#44; be it good or bad&#44; deserves a return&#59; 
and for every deed of our life we shall accordingly be 
judged by our God and Creator&#44; and receive such a 
doom as our conduct will have merited. If our good 
actions&#44; therefore&#44; exceed our sins&#44; we shall receive 
blessing and happiness as the reward for our past life&#59; 
but if our sins are more numerous than our virtues&#44; 
it is evident that we ourselves can expect nothing else 
than condemnation&#59; for we have voluntarily assumed 
the responsibility of choosing sin and its natural con&#8211; 
comitant&#44; retribution&#44; inasmuch as nothing compelled 
us to transgress but our own evil inclination&#44; and be&#8211; 
cause we might have lived virtuously&#44; if sin had not 
led us willing captives into the snares of unbelief and 
iniquity&#59; and consequently we cannot complain if we 
have to taste the bitter fruits of our unwise choice. 

If now there were no atonement provided for the 
sons of man&#44; there could evidently be no happiness&#59; 
since all have more or less sinned&#44; and sinned volun&#8211; 
tarily&#44; disregarding wilfully the law of life &#59; and be&#8211; 
cause but few of us&#44; if any&#44; can lay claim to a great 
amount of virtuous deeds&#44; wdiich would outweigh 
the load of sin with which their consciences are bur&#8211; 
dened. It was therefore consonant with divine wis&#8211; 
dom to appoint restraints and checks upon our ac&#8211; 
tions&#44; and to ordain seasons which would&#44; from asso&#8211; 
ciation&#44; make it the duty of every one to institute 
annually an inquiry into his past conduct&#44; to see if 
something does not require alteration and improve&#8211; 
ment&#59; if there is not some trait or quality in his

character wlii&#40;&#59;li is not in accordance with tlie re&#8211; 
ligion of tlie Lonl. In this we have tlius another 
cause oF tliankl&#39;uhiess&#44; in that tlie law was not only 
given to point out the way of life&#44; but that it also 
contains constant reviving springs&#44; which are to fill 
up the waste of the precious element caused by the 
avocations&#44; the distractions&#44; the bustle&#44; and the con&#8211; 
fusion incident to our peregrination through the 
mazes of our terrestrial existence. &#8212; We all know 
how exciting are the passions and the desires which 
the Creator has implanted in us for wise purposes&#44; in 
order to insure the continuance of the human race&#44; 
and to give us incentives to labour and exertion. 
But how would it stand with many&#44; if not all of us&#44; 
were there no inducciiient or opportunity given to 
watch the operation of these desires&#44; and to see that 
they do not lead to vice and immorality&#44; or to arrest 
their course if we discover that they have led ns 
astray&#63; Would we not hurry on to destruction&#44; 
slowly perhaps at first&#44; but with an accelerated down&#8211; 
ward speed&#44; if once we had yielded to the impulse of 
their sway &#63; How wise therefore is the provision of 
our law in giving us remedies for both these dangers&#44; 
by assigning us a season for repentance every year&#44; 
and by teaching us at the same time that repentance 
is efficacious and capable of restoring peace between 
the sinful creature and the justly offended Creator. 
Ceremonies therefore were instituted&#44; and days of 
abstinence from labour&#44; one of which is the great 
solemn day for general humiliation&#44; appointed to 
awaken the attention of all Israel&#44; and to admonish 
them&#44; each and collectively&#44; to search into their past 
conduct&#44; to sift their actions&#44; to accuse themselves of 

<pb n="231"/>

SALVATION THROUGH REPENTANCE. 231 

every wrong they may discover&#44; and to resolve on an 
amended conrse of life for the future. The only ob&#8211; 
stacles to such a procedure are ignorance and stub&#8211; 
bornness&#44; and neither is of suflicient weight to ex&#8211; 
cuse a continuance in the path of sin&#44; &#8212; Let us ex&#8211; 
amine the iirst difficulty&#44; ignorance. Says the sin&#8211; 
ner&#44; &#34; There is nothing wrong in what I do&#59; I follow 
the bent of what I consider right&#44; and surely my con&#8211; 
science would approve of nothing that is wrong&#44; and 
I feel no compunctious visiting of the inward moni&#8211; 
tor&#59; my sleep is sound&#44; my reflections by day are not 
disturbed by a consciousness of sin &#58; consequently the 
course I am pursuing cannot be displeasing in the 
sight of Heaven.&#34; It is&#44; brethren &#33; presumption like 
this which keeps the greater number of those who 
transgress the law in the road to perdition which 
they are pursuing&#44; and this simply because they will 
not see the truth&#44; which is to them accessible no less 
than to the righteous. But what man&#44; who under&#8211; 
stands properly the operations of the human mind&#44; 
will say that a tranquillity of conscience in religious 
matters is a test of innocence&#63; If we do not inform 
ourselves of our duties&#44; how can the conscience be 
awakened to rebuke us if we neglect them &#63; For in&#8211; 
stance&#44; if a youth at the age of twenty were for the 
iirst time to see his father&#44; and not to be informed 
of the relationship subsisting between him and the 
person before him &#58; is it possible that he would show 
him the obedience due to a parent&#63; or would 3&#39;ou 
suppose that there exists a mysterious connexion in

mit the obedience&#44; till he is certified that it is indeed&#44; 
his father who claims the same. &#8212; Or suppose a young 
man who has from his infancy been trained among a 
band of thieves to steal or commit other violations 
against the social peace &#58; what do you think are his 
sensations when he abstracts another&#39;s property &#63; 
Certainly not those of a consciousness of sin&#44; al&#8211; 
though he may have the fear of detection before him&#44; 
knowing as he must that no one likes to lose any 
thing once in his possession&#59; and if such a person is 
apprehended&#44; he exhibits not unfrequcntly&#44; what we 
commonly call&#44; a hardened disposition&#44; because we 
cannot imagine how it is probable that one can help 
expressing contrition&#44; when he has violated his neigh&#8211; 
bour&#39;s rights. But the truth is&#44; the moral perception 
of wrong has never been awakened in the delinquent&#59; 
it is ignorance which hardens him&#44; and mere punish&#8211; 
ment&#44; arbitrarily inflicted&#44; will most assuredly fail of 
producing reformation. &#8212; If it were necessary we could 
adduce a hundred examples&#44; and vary them at pleas&#8211; 
ure&#44; to prove that the human conscience must be 
awakened&#44; trained and instructed to make it a tit ar&#8211; 
biter of our actions&#59; it is in short a capacity in our 
soul which&#44; like all other capacities&#44; would lie dor&#8211; 
mant and useless&#44; if not called into life by proper edu&#8211; 
cation. &#8212; If therefore we are ignorant of the Bible&#44; if 
our education has been of that nature which takes 
no cognizance of our accountability to a higher tri&#8211; 
bunal than human authority&#58; how is it possible that 
we should be correct judges of our own conduct&#63; 
Our conscience&#44; it is true&#44; does not accuse us&#59; but is 
it not&#44; because it is uninformed&#44; torpid&#44; asleep &#63; Our 
repose at night is calm and undisturbed &#59; not because

we have done no wrong&#44; but simply because we are 
not alive to its existence. Our relleotions by day are 
not disturbed by a consciousness of sin&#44; only because 
we are not informed of the acts that are sinful. If 
now a man&#44; who proclaims the word of salvation to 
his brother&#44; were to admonish him to beware of the 
wrath that is impending&#44; would he be properly an&#8211; 
swered that the sinner&#39;s conscience does not accuse 
him of wrong&#63; Assuredly not&#59; for he would be 
compelled to advance that the sinner&#39;s ignorance 
produces this self&#8211;satisfaction&#44; even if this be real 
and not assumed&#44; in order to excuse unto men fallia&#8211; 
ble like himself his misdeeds. He would tell the 
sinner that he ought to search the word of God&#44; 
compare every action by that universal standard of 
righteousness&#44; and look w&#39;th humility into his past 
conduct to see&#44; whether his conscience has not been 
burdened with many a deed&#44; for which he has ren&#8211; 
dered himself accountable. If one were farther to 
say&#44; that his parents before him had done as he does 
now&#44; that he has never been taught to look upon the 
like things as sinful&#58; what can such excuse avail&#63; 
We will admit&#44; for argument&#39;s sake&#44; that his igno&#8211; 
rance hitherto might perhaps plead an extenuation 
for him&#59; but he is no longer ignorant as soon as his 
attention has been called to his sinfulness. He be&#8211; 
fore knew not that he oftended&#44; and his sin was there&#8211; 
fore unconscious&#44; without a thought of wilful disobe&#8211; 
dience &#59; he was not accused by the inward monitor&#44; 
because the monitor himself was ignorant&#59; but now 
conscientiousness has been awakened&#44; a new lisrht 
has been kindled in his breast&#44; and guilt hencefor&#8211;

marked ont by tlio Bible. For so we read in Eze&#8211; 
kiel &#40;iii. 19&#41; &#58; &#34; Yet if thou warn the wicked&#44; and he 
turn not from his wickedness&#44; nor from his wicked 
way&#44; he shall die in his iniquity &#59; but thou hast de&#8211; 
livered thy soul.&#34; It thus will appear that persever&#8211; 
ance in any wickedness after instruction has been 
given is not&#44; cannot be availing to save the soul from 
death. &#8212; But let the transgressor open his ears to in&#8211; 
struction&#44; let him alarm his conscience when he listens 
to the admonition that divine grace permits to be ad&#8211; 
dressed to him &#58; and surely he will accuse himself of 
the wrong he has done&#44; though before then he was 
not aware of sin&#44; not alive to iniquity&#59; and abhorring 
the filthiness of his ways he will hasten to the waters 
of cleanliness&#44; even the word of God and his holy 
spirit&#44; and endeavour to wash away all the pollution 
which adheres to him&#44; and make himself a new heart&#44; 
and become a member of the brotherhood of those 
who fear the Lord&#44; and have a regard to his name. 
This chano&#59;e of conduct will have also the farther 
effect of producing a thirst for more extended in&#8211; 
struction in the ways of the Lord and his law&#59; it 
wnll incite the regenerated son of man to lay up a 
treasure&#44; Avhcnce he may at all times draw suste&#8211; 
nance to invigorate himself&#44; when temptation and op&#8211; 
portunity to transgress again present themselves. 
And as formerly his ignorance made him torpid and 
unconscious&#44; his new zeal and increased knowledge 
will render him quick in perceiving any and every 
remissness in the fuUilment of his duties&#59; and he 
will no longer boast of fliat hardy indifference which 
is nothing else than a living moral death&#44; but will 
acknowledge that he now fears to offend&#44; that he

DOW dreads incurring divine wrath&#59; yet that withal 
he experiences more real tranquillity&#44; more real joy 
whenever an act of virtue is accomplished. For he 
now bears within liini the conviction that he is with&#8211; 
in the operation of the moral life which is alone found 
in the words&#44; and in the obedience to the commands&#44; 
of the law of our God &#33; 

On former occasions we have examined the causes 
of sin&#44; in so far as they produce the actions which are 
contrary to the commandments. It is not requisite 
at present to go again over the whole ground&#44; and we 
will confine ourselves merely to the obstacle which 
&#34; stubbornness&#34; lays in the way of a thorough ref&#8211; 
ormation. &#8212; It is a notorious fact that habit makes us 
forget either the good or bad qualities&#44; either physical 
or moral&#44; of any thing which is placed within our 
sphere of action or enjoyment. The sensation be&#8211; 
comes blunted by constant repetition&#44; till at length 
we lose sight of the very nature of the thing before 
us. The delicate ear of the musician will detect er&#8211; 
rors and jarring discords in the sounds which delight 
the uninitiated. The latter has enjoyed his false 
melody so long&#44; that he wishes no better&#59; the former 
however is at once aware of its blemishes&#44; and he 
therefore justly condemns it&#44; and wonders how such 
a mass of inconsistencies can please any human ear. 
&#8212; With regard to taste&#44; even with entire nations&#44; the 
difference is equally great. The food which shocks 
many as absolutely disgusting&#44; has been converted by 
habit into a delicacy to many others. &#8212; The same is 
the case with dress and ornament. Some forms&#44; sub&#8211; 
ject themselves to. pressure which constant practice 
alone can render tolerable&#59; and some again require a 

<pb n="236"/>

236 SALVATION THROUGH REPENTANCE. 

large superfluity of garments&#44; &#8211;which others would&#44; aa 
they think justly&#44; consider a useless hurden and in&#8211; 
jurious to the free and active use of the limbs. &#8212; But 
in the moral world habit has no less an eft&#39;ect on the 
mind. &#34;Whatever we have practised from our in&#8211; 
fancy will become natural to us&#44; and we will often 
wonder how it is&#44; that any one can think even of differing from the views we have taken. &#8212; Any act&#44; when 
first we do it&#44; may appear either ridiculous&#44; or super&#8211; 
fluous &#59; but if we repeat it&#44; we shall constantly feel 
less of strangeness in it&#44; and we shall lose at last all 
sense of its either being a matter of merriment or 
extravagance. The first transgression accordingly&#44; 
which we permit ourselves&#44; causes doubtless a severe 
struggle and self&#8211;accusation &#59; but if we do it again 
and repeat it often&#44; we by degrees will cease feeling 
the like unpleasant sensations to mar our unnatural 
enjoyments. AVhen a man has therefore for a length 
of time been transgressing&#44; he has no longer any 
pleasure in the pursuit of virtue&#59; because this course 
Avould deprive him necessarily of the things which 
habit has rendered requisite to his perverted taste&#59; 
or because it will impose on him duties the exercise 
of which is foreign&#44; and&#44; therefore&#44; unpalatable to 
him. lie for this reason perseveres&#59; not because he 
is ignorant that the Bible condemns his conduct&#44; but 
because he is used to sinning. &#8212; Now it so happens 
that most men are either too indolent to institute a 
rigid self&#8211;examination&#44; or are too proud to confess 
that such a search has resulted in convicting them of 
guilt. They at all events profess outwardly that they 
liave perceived nothing in their conduct deserving of 
blame&#44; or which should be altered. They therefore 

<pb n="237"/>

SALVATION THROUGH REPENTANCE. 237 

continue to do as they were wont&#44; and pass their 
days in life&#8211;destroying follies. &#8212; But could this pride&#44; 
or this pride and indolence coinhined&#44; he once hum&#8211; 
bled&#44; could the creature but once acknowledge in se&#8211; 
cret before God and in public before men&#44; that the 
past acts were habits of sin and iniquity&#59; and could 
the sinner&#44; thus confessed&#44; but once be brought to 
break off from unlawful pleasures and seek to find 
delight in the exercise of religious duties&#44; and coukl 
all Israel&#44; could all mankind be induced to embrace 
the happiness resulting from piety and devotion &#58; how 
readily would a thorough reformation be elfected in 
every individual&#44; and how rapidly would the empire 
of sin be banished from the face of the earth &#33; 

So many appeals are addressed to us to act after 
this manner&#59; so much love is expressed by Scripture 
towards sinful man &#59; so much regret is recorded 
about the death of the unrighteous &#58; that one would 
think that every Israelite would gladly be pious&#44; or&#44; 
if he has offended&#44; endeavour to merit a return of 
divine favour. But alas &#33; the human heart is too 
proud&#44; habit is too inveterate&#44; passions are too dom&#8211; 
inant&#44; for us to humble ourselves and to cast off the 
evil of our ways&#59; we cling with a bold front to in&#8211; 
iquity&#44; and will not listen to the voice of admonition 
that is addressed to us. But why should we remain 
stubborn &#63; what is there so lovely in sin &#63; what so 
absurd in piety&#44; that we should choose the first and 
reject the other &#63; why should not the dust of the earth 
stand humbled before the Creator&#63; why should the 
child not fly for protection to the everlasting Father&#63; 
&#8212; Brethren &#33; there is nothing disgraceful in our pub&#8211; 
licly confessing that we have acted unlawfully&#44; if we 

<pb n="238"/>

238 SALVATION THROUGH REPENTANCE. 

are sincere in our regret&#59; there is nothing humiliat&#8211; 
ing to acknowledge that we condemn our past con&#8211; 
duct&#44; when we feel a conviction of sin. Let us reflect&#44; 
that the disgrace is not in the change hut in the per&#8211; 
severance in doing wrong&#59; that the liuniiliation now 
endured before those equally mortal and fallible with 
ourselves is infinitely less than if our guilty spirit 
should stand abashed before the unending One&#44; with 
all its sins unatoned&#44; with all its transgressions un&#8211; 
confessed. But even the mortification of confessing&#44; 
by a change of conduct&#44; that we thought ourselves 
hitherto in the wrong&#44; will soon lose all its disagree&#8211; 
able effects&#44; if we but resolutely determine to disre&#8211; 
gard the sneers and malicious remarks of our associ&#8211; 
ates. Let them say&#44; that we are grown wonderfully 
pious&#44; that we are becoming saints&#44; that we are no 
longer pleasant companions &#58; what do we suffer by 
this&#63; Certainly not any injury which is worth mind&#8211; 
ing&#59; it is merely a little ridicule&#44; perhaps a little 
pleasant raillery&#44; which we can easily silence&#44; if we 
candidly state that such jests are unpleasant to us&#44; 
since we are sincere and serious in the new mode of 
life we have adopted. And grant&#44; that we should all 
the remainder of our days be exposed to the jeers of 
the ungodly&#44; or to the taunts of our friends who may 
perhaps he inclined to censure our strict observance&#44; 
and to wonder at the great change that has taken 
place within us &#59; admit that such taunts may have 
a disagreeable efiect upon a sensitive and irascible 
mind&#44; in seeing its best acts so misinterpreted and its 
motive so falsely explained&#58; still is even this more 
readily borne than the constant self&#8211;accusation of the 
sinner&#44; when his attention has been awakened &#59; and 

<pb n="239"/>

may not the uncharitable remarks of a selfish world 
be the requisite temptation which our new&#8211;born zeal 
has to encounter&#63;&#8212; Moreover&#44; is not virtue always 
exposed to the same trials&#63; do not those who never 
grievously sin meet with similar provocations in their 
attempts at leading a godly life &#63; What reason then 
has the sinner to dread these annoyances more than 
they who have never sinned&#44; if such can be found&#63; 
&#8212; He will say&#44; perhaps&#44; that the latter are so used to 
obedience that it costs them no efforts to persevere 
in righteousness&#44; and that they are easily able to dis&#8211; 
regard the jibes of their friends. But this is not al&#8211; 
toirether true. No one is so righteous that he is in 
no danger of falling&#59; no one is so perfect but he feels 
unpleasantly if he is exposed to detraction and ridi&#8211; 
cule&#59; it is easily said that one has a hearty contempt 
for malice and slander&#59; but I fear that but few indeed 
actually are so far removed above human frailty as to 
feel in truth the contempt they express. &#8212; In short&#44; it 
is as much the duty of the sinner to look towards the 
law of God for instruction undeterred by the shame 
of appearing self&#8211;accused before the world&#44; as of the 
always righteous to be mindful&#44; and to persevere in 
the exercise of the duties enjoined in the same law. 
&#8212; And if therefore we wish truly to escape condem&#8211; 
nation for the sins we have done &#58; we must remove 
the hardness of disobedience from our soul&#44; expose 
our shame&#44; if need be&#44; before all the world&#44; and pur&#8211; 
sue the way of righteousness&#44; just as we are taught in 
tlie words of salvation. &#8212; Let us consider moreover at 
whose request&#44; yes request is the word&#44; we are thus 
to bid deliance to the world&#33; It is not a man who 
calls us to him&#44; not a mortal whose power is limited&#44;

whose days are brief&#44; but our God&#44; the Everlasting&#44; 
the Omnipotent&#44; the Omnipresent. It is He who ap&#8211; 
peals to our better judgment&#44; to our love for bis fa&#8211; 
vour&#44; to our feaj&#8211; of his power. He tells us to make 
ourselves familiar with his precepts&#44; and to throw off 
our stubbornness&#59; He appeals to us to change our 
actions if there is evil in them&#44; and to return unto 
the good which we have forsaken. And we are 
promised&#44; that such an open profession will meet its 
reward&#44; in the return of the grace of the Lord which 
we have lost by our transgression. For thus says the 
prophet&#58; 

&#34;Seek ye the Lord&#44; while He may be found&#44; call ye upon Him&#44; 
while He is near. Let the wicked forsake his way&#44; and the un&#8211; 
righteous man his thoughts&#44; and let him return unto the Lord and 
He will have mercy upon him&#44; and to our God&#44; for He will abun&#8211; 
dantly pjardon. &#34; Isa. Iv. 6&#44; 7. 

In these few expressive words the whole scope of 
repentance is clearly laid before us. &#34; Let the wicked 
forsake his way&#59;&#34; suppose a traveller has strayed 
from the proper road into a barren trackless desert&#44; 
where death threatens him at every step he takes &#58; 
would he be wise to stop where he is&#44; or to continue 
his perilous journey despite of all dangers which sur&#8211; 
round him&#44; if a benevolent sage were to appear and 
oft&#39;er to lead him to the secure liighway in a fertile 
district&#44; whence he might reach the haven of his des&#8211; 
tiny in peace and safety &#63; We would assuredly say

that his blood be on his own head&#44; if he disregards 
the admonition and refuses to be led by his kind con&#8211; 
ductor. Just the same is the scriptural appeal to the 
sinner. He has strayed from the road of the law&#44; 
which is the way to salvation &#59; he has deviated into 
the howling desert of transgression&#44; which is unpro&#8211; 
ductive of contentment and charged with death and 
destruction&#44; and every act which he perpetrates when 
under the dominion of sin is plunging him deeper 
into the abyss of hopeless degradation. But he is 
met in this miserable condition by the grace of the 
Ancient of days&#44; who addresses him in endearing 
terms of love through the words of Scripture and 
the advice of the friends of man&#44; the teachers of the 
word&#44; and the pious associates whom no one is alto&#8211; 
gether without&#44; to return to the highway of salvation 
in the law&#44; which&#44; as we have said&#44; is the course of 
life &#58; what should he do&#44; but seize the favourable op&#8211; 
portunity which is offered him&#44; and unite himself to 
the God from whose service he has strayed &#63; &#34;And&#44;&#34; 
says the prophet&#44; &#34; &#40;let&#41; the unrighteous man &#40;forsake&#41; 
his thoughts&#58;&#34; yes&#44; if we are anxious to be secure in 
our renewed pursuit of righteousness&#44; we must not 
resort to half&#8211;measures&#44; to say &#34;we have repented for 
one day&#44; we are now again in favour with the Lord.&#34; 
This course is but a mockery of Providence &#59; lie can&#8211; 
not be satisfied with an attempt to defraud Him by a 
pretended conversion&#44; by an outward exhibition of 
an ephemeral penance which is forgotten when the 
day has closed. But how are we to repent&#63; Even 
as the prophet says&#44; by first pretermitting our sinful 
deeds&#44; and then purifying our iniquitous thoughts. 
&#34;VVe must abhor sin altogether&#44; we must feel that we

are unworthy through transgression in the sight of 
God&#44; and that througli ol&#41;edicnce alone&#44; continued 
during tlie remainder of our life&#44; can we be accepted. 
&#34;VVe must cast no longing&#44; lingering look behind&#44; as 
we are retracing our steps &#59; but speed onward&#44; on&#8211; 
ward in righteousness&#44; farther&#44; farther from trans&#8211; 
gression. And as when sinning we hastened by ac&#8211; 
celerated steps after we had once yielded ourselves 
to our desires &#58; so will we be strengthened&#44; as we 
proceed&#44; to advance faster and faster in the pursuit 
of righteousness&#59; for the forsaking of our wicked 
thoughts&#44; or in other words the pleasure we at one 
time felt in transgressing&#44; will impel us to be active 
in righteousness&#44; and to grow stronger in grace and 
holiness. &#8212; And what will be the result&#63; &#34;Let him 
return unto the Lord&#44; and He will have mercy on 
him.&#34; The sinner&#44; when he is aroused to self&#8211;con&#8211; 
demnation&#44; must not despair of mercy &#59; he must not 
appeal to the magnitude or number of his misdeeds 
as a proof that he cannot return&#44; since to him no 
atonement can be given. &#39;No&#44; this is not the doctrine 
which the Bible teaches &#59; all may be received into 
favour&#44; all should therefore return. Who is there 
that has stood in the council of the Lord&#44; and will 
set a measure to his bounty &#63; who dares to deny to 
man the hope which God himself has inspired &#63; No &#33; 
the mercy of God is extended to all who come&#44; his 
forgiveness is not exhausted&#44; and never will be ex&#8211; 
hausted. He has created mankind for happiness&#44; 
not destruction&#59; but it is their business to earn sal&#8211; 
vation for themselves&#44; at first&#44; by obedience and&#44; if 
they have sinped&#44; by repentance. Still let no man 
flatter himself that he will escape condemnation if

he does not repent&#59; for we are told that impenitence 
will receive the displeasure of our God&#44; who is ever&#8211; 
living and cognizant of all our deeds. We cannot 
escape&#44; except by embracing the call&#44; tbe invitation 
to mercy addressed to us. Let us all therefore seek 
the Lord while He may be found&#44; before our life 
draws to a close&#59; let all wait on Ilim while lie is 
nigh&#44; which is all the days of our existence&#44; but 
chiefly at the season of forgiveness which He has 
instituted as a time of atonement for Israel to their 
latest generation. Let us be convinced&#44; that it is in 
our power to be numbered among the righteous and 
the accepted&#44; the elect of God&#44; because they have done 
his will&#44; and purified their thoughts from evil. Let 
there be no holding back&#44; no timidity&#59; for what have 
we to fear&#44; if we act rightly&#63; and what have we not to 
dread&#44; if we are stubborn and persevering in sin &#63; 

O &#33; that all Israel therefore would hasten forward to 
embrace the tree of life which the Lord has planted 
for them &#59; how happy a season of atonement would 
this be&#44; if all were to return in truth to the fold of 
the great Shepherd &#33; There are those whose hands 
are defiled by fraud and unjust gain &#58; let them ask 
for forgiveness of their injured neighbour&#44; make res&#8211; 
titution for the wrong they have done&#44; abhor their

their sin&#44; according to hi&#58; mercy. &#8212; There are they 
who have caused dissension and strife among broth&#8211;

let them too join the crowd of worshippers&#44; and ap&#8211;

There are those who have neglected the covenant of 
Abraham &#59; their sons bear not the impression of the

they wish not to be of Israel&#44; desire for no portion in 
the law&#44; the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob&#59;

see vengeance executed upon the transgressors. Let

ing into the midst of the congregation of the Lord&#44;

know that they are of Israel&#44; and their hopes are

that they have sinned long enough&#44; that no satisfac&#8211; 
tion attends a constant toiling&#44; a labour uninterrupted 
by a spiritual refreshing at the house of God &#63; What

will their unlawful gains avail when the day of trial 
at length arrives &#63; what will their souls say when they 
must answer the dread Judge when demanding an 
account of their doings whilst in this state of proba&#8211; 
tion&#63; Let these also return from their evil&#59; God is 
near to their prayers&#44; if they will sincerely repent 
and sin no more &#59; they too will be accepted&#44; if they 
forsake their sinful way and no longer cling to their 
thoughts&#44; which only counsel evil&#44; and will debar them 
from an entrance into the gates of everlasting life. 

Brethren &#33; by the fixvour of God we have been pre&#8211; 
served to celebrate the commencement of another 
year &#59; his mercy has not been withheld from the la&#8211; 
bour of our hands. As j&#39;&#8211;et it is time to seek right&#8211; 
eousness &#33; the portals of mercy are not yet closed &#33; 
But who will warrant us that another year will be al&#8211; 
lotted to any one here present &#63; how are we to know 
who of us will be soon carried to the grave. Should 
we not&#44; therefore&#44; feel alarmed at the state of uncer&#8211; 
tainty which is ever extended over human happiness&#44; 
over human life &#63; were it not time therefore that we 
0&#44;11 should look to our deeds&#44; pluck thence the evil 
which threatens ou&#42;&#42; peace&#44; and seek for pardon for 
our past misconduct&#63; Let no one say&#44; that we have 
not sinned&#44; individually and collectively&#59; there is sin 
in the houses&#44; in private recesses&#44; in public assemblies&#44; 
in the dark of night&#44; in the noon of day &#33; It is there&#8211; 
fore the business of all to assist in clearing from 
briers and thorns the highway of salvation&#44; to purify 
themselves and to help in cleansing others. Perhaps 
we may be received in favour &#59; perhaps the evil which 
we have merited may be converted into blessing&#44; if 
the Lord sees that we are entire with Him&#44; and sin&#8211;

cere in his service. Perhaps in his mercy He may 
visit the outcast daughter of Zion&#44; and build up her 
desolate places&#44; and heal up the breaches in her sanc&#8211; 
tuary whic&#59;h the heathen have trampled down in their 
triumph&#44; because we had sinned. And how happy 
would we tlien dwell &#33; protected l&#41;y the law of God&#44; 
governed by his own anointed &#33; Xo longer would our 
brothers linger in captivity&#44; and writhe under the lash 
of the persecutor&#59; and righteousness and truth would 
guide us all onward to the realms of bliss&#44; to the fa&#8211; 
vour of God. &#8212; O &#33; let this holy aim be our desire &#33; let 
us return to our Father&#44; who speaks to us through his 
word&#44; who appeals to us through&#44; our love of life&#44; 
through our hope of salvation &#33; Let us&#44; beloved breth&#8211; 
ren &#33; devote ourselves to his service&#44; proclaim aloud 
that to Him alone we will cling&#44; that we will hence&#8211; 
forward seek in his law alone for instruction&#44; and en&#8211; 
deavour to ofiend no more. Then will we be received 
as was David received&#44; our sin will be wiped off&#44; and 
we will not die&#44; but live&#44; and stand regenerated be&#8211; 
fore our Father who is in heaven&#44; in the midst of the 
assembly of the saints who have done his will. 

Bless us&#44; O our God&#33; as Thou. didst bless our fa&#8211; 
thers&#59; and look not to our iniquity&#44; but forgive us&#44; 
even as Thou hast forgiven the sinning seed of Adam 
from the beginning until now. Accept our prayer&#44; 
and cause thy word to be sweet unto us&#44; so that we 
may all be induced to return from our evil ways&#44; and 
seek for life in thy presence&#44; by a submission to thy 
holy will&#44; which Thou hast made known to us through 
thy servants the prophets. Amen&#44;

DISCOURSE XV. 

THE COVENANT OF ABRAHAM. 

Blessed God&#44; the ominpotent I Am &#33; whose are all 
existing things&#44; whose happiness is immeasurable&#44; 
whose goodness is without ending&#44; bless us as ever 
Thou didst bless the seed of Abraham thy beloved&#59; 
be with us in the moments of joj&#44; be our stay in the 
hours of sorrow &#59; watch over us when we are obedi&#8211; 
ent&#44; and reject us not when we forsake thy covenant. 
Have regard to our sinful nature&#44; remember that we 
are flesh&#44; and be mindful that we are children of those 
holy ones of former years&#44; whose devotion and piety 
Thou promisedst to preserve unto a thousand genera&#8211; 
tions. Give us then thy blessing&#44; grant us thy salva&#8211; 
tion&#44; and cause that from us too may yet spring gen&#8211; 
eration after generation of true sons of Israel&#44; who 
will sanctify thy name&#44; even as it is sanctified by thy 
holy messengers&#44; who declare Thee their God and 
Creator&#44; and proclaim &#58; &#39;&#39; Holy&#44; holy&#44; holy is the Lord 
of hosts&#44; the whole earth is full of his glory.&#34; Be 
this thy will. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

Were life never beset with dangers&#44; were there no 
critical situations during the course of our existence&#58; 
then would we require no prudence to guide us cor&#8211; 
rectly&#44; no instruction to tell us how to proceed in our 
plans. So likewise&#44; were religion nothing but an ad&#8211; 

<pb n="248"/>

248 THE COVENANT OF ABRAHAM. 

mission of certain truths&#44; or an exerciso of nothing but 
pleasant duties&#58; no admonition&#44; no warnings&#44; no re&#8211; 
wards&#44; no punishments would be requisite to render 
us all religious. If this were so&#44; then life on the one 
hand would pass away in one uniform state of inaction&#44; 
and religion would fail of improving the soul&#44; or of 
tending to eradicate the evil propensities inherent in 
our nature. &#8212; But life is one constant succession of 
dangers and trials&#59; all our energies are perpetually 
called into action to ward oft&#34; some unpleasant event 
or to combat with some pressing difficulty&#59; the mind 
thus becomes quickened&#44; the inventive faculties are 
excited &#59; and mankind in consequence are always has&#8211; 
tening forward to a state of change and improvement&#44; 
no matter whether the latter be either fancied or real. 
If occasionally the result of such exertion must be 
admitted to be injurious to the great mass&#58; still it is 
more frequently highly useful and even necessary&#44; as 
experience has amply proved&#44; to infuse life into the 
stagnant state of inaction or torpid submission to mis&#8211; 
rule. &#8212; The same is the case with religion&#59; our souls 
are susceptible of improvement&#44; and our disposition 
though inclined to sinfulness can be counteracted&#44; if 
we have a constant watch over ourselves&#44; and endeav&#8211; 
our to shape our conduct in accordance with the law 
of God. 

Now let us inquire. What is it which we naturally 
seek&#63; and what is it which we are naturally inclined 
to avoid &#63; On the one hand&#44; we seek pleasure&#44; ease&#44; 
and enjoyment&#59; on the other&#44; we have an aversion to 
sorrow&#44; labour&#44; and pain. But let us ask&#44; Is it not a 
moral labour to overcome anger&#63; the desire for any 
thing unlawful &#63; Only be placed in a situation where 

<pb n="249"/>

THE COVENANT OF ABRAHAM. 249 

your self&#8211;love and iiiitliority have been deeply Avound&#8211; 
ed&#44; where the otFender is within your reach foi&#8211; reproof 
or punishment&#58; and the natural impulse would be 
to give way to resentment&#44; and to let anger take its 
course of violence and destruction. But religion steps 
in and tells you to labour hard against your impulse&#44; to 
put a bridle on your temper&#44; and obtain a conquest over 
yourselves&#44; even at the expense of your love of self. &#8212; 
Or be placed in a situation where your passions for 
unlawful enjoyment are strongly incited&#44; wdiere the 
chances of detection are small&#44; the pleasure great and 
immediate&#44; the opportunity actually before you&#44; though 
generally of rare occurrence &#58; your nature is drawn 
to sin &#59; but the law of God appeals to you to beware&#44; 
to hesitate&#44; to reflect and to renounce your wishes&#44; in 
obedience to a higher Will&#44; to a superior Authority. 
It is doubtless true that the resistance of human na&#8211; 
ture in both instances mentioned will be very great&#44; 
the love of ease and enjoyment will strongly appeal 
for gratification&#59; but the wisely thinking will never&#8211; 
theless readily distinguish that the labour of self&#8211;con&#8211; 
quest and the pain of suppressing the passions are the 
only means to prevent them from feeling hereafter 
the fruits of indulgence &#8212; self&#8211;abasement&#44; shame&#44; and 
degradation. 

If now any one will not obey the law of God&#44; be&#8211; 
cause it contains precepts the execution of which is 
painful&#44; laborious&#44; and unpleasant&#59; if one avers that 
the God of love could not have demanded bodily af&#8211; 
flictions as a part of his service &#58; we Avill tell him&#44; that 
he does not understand the why of these institutions&#59; 
they are intended to teach us to subdue our natures&#44; 
to overcome our love of ease and pleasure&#44; to inure 

<pb n="250"/>

250 THE COVENANT OF ABRAHAM. 

ourselves to the sorrows and cares with which our 
life is beset from its very comriieuccment&#44; in order 
that we may become wiser and better&#44; and more fitted 
for the kingdom of heaven&#44; which is to be our liome 
unto everlasting&#44; our residence unto the utmost length 
of days. &#8212; All that is wanting to insure a proper un&#8211; 
derstanding of these ordinances is a deep&#8211;seated faith&#44; 
or a conviction of the goodness and truth of the Lord 
in all He does&#44; in all He says&#59; that He will ordain 
nothing which is not wise&#59; that He will demand noth&#8211; 
ing at our hands which is not for our own improve&#8211; 
ment. Were it now&#44; brethren &#33; that our own wisdom 
could be so extended as to understand the operation 
of outward nature and the workings of our own mind&#59; 
could we precisely know what is beneficial&#44; what is 
hurtful&#44; how far one thing may be safely used&#44; and 
how far we could without danger proceed in our in&#8211; 
tended plans&#58; then indeed might we be permitted to 
dive into the recesses of religious truths&#44; and ask&#44; for 
every precept in the law&#44; &#34; Why is this so&#63;&#34;&#39; But 
how does the case stand &#63; The knowledge we have 
of our own selves is very limited&#59; the surface only of 
things is laid open to our view &#59; we taste&#44; we eat&#44; we 
drink&#44; we revel&#44; without knowing wdiether there is 
life or death lurking amidst our joy&#59; we move on&#8211; 
ward unconscious whether the next step will bring us 
to our end. And v&#41;e will ask of God&#44; why He so or&#8211; 
dained it ill his law &#63; we&#44; the short of days&#44; the lim&#8211; 
ited in knowledge&#44; will know the reason for every 
precept before we act&#63; How presumptuous&#44; how fool&#8211; 
ish is such a thought&#33; It may rather be demanded 
of us&#44; that we have confidence&#44; the assurance I ought 
to say&#44; that every precept is given for a wise purpose&#44; 

<pb n="251"/>

THE COVENANT OF ABRAHAM. 251 

for a beneficent end &#59; and we should obey it with feel&#8211; 
ings or thankfulness that the Omnipotent was pleased 
to point out to us the way we should go&#44; in order to 
obtain his approval. If now the execution of any 
one commandment should involve the sacrifice of per&#8211; 
sonal ease&#44; and the endurance of some little bodily 
pain &#58; it will be nothing more in effect than that we 
have an opportunity to prove&#44; that our love of God 
is something more than a love of ease and self&#8211;indul&#8211; 
gence&#59; that our religious hope is something holier 
than a mere mercenary feeling&#59; and that we can love 
the Lord and worship Him&#44; even if our natural sen&#8211; 
sations have to be first subdued before we can display 
this love and this worship. 

Besides all this we may maintain&#44; that though the 
Bible asks of us the performance of duties which in&#8211; 
volve bodily afflictions&#44; these are in no case whatever 
of any lasting or oppressive duration. For the Lord 
in giving us Lis law wisely apportioned our duties to 
our capacities&#59; and it is therefore in our power to 
obey whenever the opportunity offers&#44; unless we are 
restrained by circumstances over which we have no 
control&#44; which present then a case of necessity&#44; or&#44; 
what is the same&#44; an excusable neglect of our pos&#8211; 
itive duties. But in every other instance the unpleas&#8211; 
antness of an obligation is no reason why it should 
not be acted on &#59; for we should consider that it is a 
trial of our faith&#44; a proving of our nature&#44; to show 
whether our confidence in God is sufficiently firm 
and well established to enable us to sacrifice our ease 
and inclination in obedience to his will. &#8212; If now we 
obey&#44; we have slain sin which is inherent in us &#59; we 
have conquered ourselves &#59; and we have proved that 

<pb n="252"/>

252 THE COVENANT OF ABRAHAM. 

we are indeed servants of the Most Iligli. But if we 
fail&#44; we have yielded ourselves slaves to sin&#59; we have 
been remiss in tbe battle lor righteousness&#44; and have 
proved that we are recreants in the service of Heaven. 
On the one hand the spirit has prevailed in the con&#8211; 
test with the flesh&#44; and we have become children of 
light&#44; inheritors of salvation &#59; for we have withstood&#44; 
even as is the will of our Master who is in heaven. 
On the other hand&#44; however&#44; the flesh has prevailed&#44; 
the spirit is slain&#44; the world is triumphant&#59; and we 
have earned for our ourselves immortal disgrace&#44; and 
the lasting displeasure of the upright Arbiter who 
will judge every one according to his deeds. 

What is now to be expected from us &#63; How should 
Israelites act&#63; &#8212; Even as Abraham did&#44; in faith&#44; in 
singleness of heart&#44; in submission to the divine will. 
Before to&#8211;day the character of this Patriarch has 
been presented to you as the propagator of religious 
knowledge&#44; as the harbinger of glorious truths to a 
benighted world. Let us look upon him now in the 
light of the obedient servant&#44; the uncomplaining&#44; cou&#8211; 
fidinjr follower of the Lord of hosts. &#8212; We read in 
our lesson of this day as follows &#58; 


&#34;And when Abram was ninety and nine years old&#44; the Lord ap&#8211; 
peared to Abram&#44; and said unto hina&#44; I am the God Almighty&#44; 
walk before mc&#44; and be thou perfect. And I will give my cove&#8211; 
nant between mc and thee&#44; and I will multiply thee exceedingly.&#34; 
Genesis xvii. 1&#44; 2. 

<pb n="263"/>

THE COVENANT OF ABRAHAM. 263 

How greatly had Abram been blessed in all worldly 
things except children&#59; and in later years this bless&#8211; 
ing also had in a measure been added to his almost 
overflowing cup of happiness. &#8212; Did he covet wealth&#63; 
he was possessed of every thing which constituted 
riches in those days. &#8212; Did he sigh for power&#63; this 
too he had&#44; for he was foremost among the chiefs of 
his time. Did he desire a good name&#63; this also he 
enjoyed in an eminent degree. Moreover he was 
pious&#44; and had been permitted to make the truth that 
was his known to others&#44; that they also might seek 
shelter under the wings of Omnipotence&#44; and forsake 
the worship of false deities. &#8212; He was at this time 
ninety&#8211;nine years old&#59; more than half of his life had 
already passed away &#58; when he was told&#44; that as yet 
his piety had not been perfect&#44; and that with all his 
devotion&#44; with all his public teaching&#44; with all the 
trials he had to encounter&#44; there was yet something 
more to be done&#44; some farther requisite to holiness 
was yet expected from him. Hitherto the trials had 
been outward&#59; that is to say&#44; whatever had happened 
to our ancestor was the work of others&#44; which he had 
to encounter&#44; humanly speaking&#44; whether he would 
or not&#59; he was placed in circumstances which per&#8211; 
mitted him no other course of conduct. But now 
the trial was to be with himself&#59; he was voluntarily 
to assume the terms of the covenant which the Lord 
was about to make with him. Abram fell prostrate 
before the awful Appearance&#44; and the word was 
vouchsafed to him&#44; and he was told how he should 
walk before God and be perfect. &#34; This is my cove&#8211; 
nant&#44; which you shall observe between me and be&#8211; 
tween you&#44; and between thy seed after thee&#44; circumcise

unto yourselves every male.&#34; &#40;Ibid. 10.&#41; Underst.ind 
well&#44; brethren &#33; Abruhani was on the verge of a liun&#8211; 
dred years&#44; he had all along thought that his course 
was pleasing to God&#44; and up to this moment he had 
never yet been informed that circumcision was either 
a duty or praiseworthy. If Abraham now had been 
of those whose faith is weak&#44; he might have argued&#58; 
&#34;Why am I at this late period commanded to do an 
act which&#44; if it be a duty&#44; ought to have been revealed 
to me years ago &#63; Why should God single out a 
matter which is painful and unpleasant&#44; and make 
that a sign of his covenant&#63; Could He not have told 
me of my duty much earlier &#63; or could lie not give 
me a sign which is of easier attainment and more 
consonant with my feelings&#63;&#34; But he&#44; the first of 
the children of the East&#44; did not so argue&#44; did not so 
set up his judgment above the wisdom of the Lord. 
He was informed that he was not yet entire with God&#44; 
that it was demanded of him that he should walk be&#8211; 
fore the Lord&#44; and that he should assume the sign of 
the covenant&#44; even the circumcision of the flesh&#58; and 
he obeyed&#59; he was elated with the thought that he at 
length had an opportunity to prove that bodily incon&#8211; 
venience did not stand as a barrier to his devotion&#44; 
that he could mortify the flesh&#44; if religion so required 
it. How holy must have been that faith&#44; how entire 
that lieart which animated the Patriarch&#33; He volun&#8211; 
tarily shed his blood&#44; of his own free will he assumed 
the covenant&#44; and handed it down to his posterity. 
And additional blessings were poured out upon him&#59; 
the Lord promised that unto all the future descend&#8211; 
ants of Abraham He would be God&#44; that is to say&#44; that 
inever&#44; never&#44; should the knowledge of the pure One

depart from Abraham&#39;s seed&#44; and that in all ages tlie 
God of all would dwell in the midst of the descendants 
of his devoted servant&#44; if they keep the covenant. &#8212; 
And thou&#44; blessed covenant&#44; hast never yet departed 
from the midst of us &#33; In every age&#44; in every land&#44; our 
brothers have brought their children as an acceptable 
oliering to the Most High&#44; not by immolating them 
upon the altar of unbelief&#44; but by rendering them per&#8211; 
fect in the manner the law demands. And fathers 
have hastened to impress thee on their sons&#44; and 
mothers have rejoiced that their portion was so happy&#59; 
and the people with one accord have professed aloud&#44; 
that in thee they acknowledge&#44; that through thee they 
are convinced that the Lord is God alone&#44; that his 
word will ever endure&#44; and that Israel is the people 
selected to be his servants&#44; chosen to be the messen&#8211; 
gers of his glor3&#92; 

Hitherto Sarah had been childless &#58; j&#8211;et the effects 
of Abraham&#39;s faith were not alone confined to spirit&#8211; 
ual grace&#44; but were extended likewise to increase 
his temporal satisfaction. A year had just elapsed 
from the time of the announcement&#44; when Sarah&#44; 
to complete her happiness&#44; saw the fulfilment of all 
her hopes. Iler long&#8211;tried confidence&#44; the anxious 
waiting for the verification of the Lord&#39;s promises&#44; 
had now witnessed an entire accomplishment&#59; and 
she could no longer doubt that the fulfilment of 
the other promises would not fail&#44; but that from her 
seed all the world should derive blessing&#44; and that 
her descendants should always be a people sacred 
to the service of the One Eternal. &#8212; Therefore at the 
age of eight days was the child of promise circum&#8211; 
cised&#44; as the Lord had commanded&#59; and thus was the

parent of Israel the lirst of Abraluinrs sons who re&#8211; 
ceived the impress of the covenant at liis entrance 
into life. 

We&#44; his descendants&#44; stand now on earth&#44; the in&#8211; 
lieritors of the covenant&#44; the children of salvation 
under the law. Centuries have rolled on&#44; ages have 
followed on ages&#44; and yet this covenant and this law 
have stood our protecting angels from amalgamation 
and perishing among the gentiles. And this covenant 
is a constant test&#44; a trial of faith&#44; whether we are 
willing to walk before the Lord&#44; whether as parents 
we are sufficiently imbued with the spirit of religion 
to submit ourselves to divine guidance&#44; and to inilict 
upon our sons a few brief hours of pain in obedience 
to the huv&#44; for &#92;vhich temporary suifering they are 
to be admitted into the community of those wdio wor&#8211; 
ship no God save the Creator&#44; and who obey no law 
save the emanation of Supreme Wisdom. &#8212; Parents&#33; 
do you fear your God&#63; do you dread to appear be&#8211; 
ibre Ilim with the sin of neglect&#44; of apostacy&#44; upon 
your conscience&#63; Then hasten to initiate your chil&#8211; 
dren into the covenant&#44; and let them not have occa&#8211; 
sion in after&#8211;life to accuse you of being the cause that 
they are not members of the Jewish community. It 
is true&#44; that it is the duty of every Israelite to assume 
the covenant himself&#44; if his parents have been neglect&#8211; 
ful of the commandment&#59; but what reason have you 
to expect&#44; that your children will be sufficiently strong 
in faith t&#40;5 submit to the law&#44; wdien you thought it un&#8211; 
reasonable and cruel&#44; or unnecessary&#44; in their infancj&#39; &#63; 
&#8212; Let me impress it solemnly on your mind&#44; that it 
is no small crime to cut off an entire household&#44; or 
an entire family&#44; from communion wath Israel. We 

<pb n="257"/>

THE COVENANT OF ABRAHAM. 257 

know well enough that but few temporal advantages 
are to be gained by this communion&#59; perhaps the 
knowledge of our being Israelites may be an injury 
to our advancement&#59; for as yet the prejudice against 
our name and our religion have not vanished from 
the face of the earth. If now you value the fleeting 
advantages of life so much as to deny your children 
their rights as Jews&#59; or if you are so weak in faith as 
to neglect as unwise and unimportant what we deem 
of the first necessity&#58; you will have incurred a re&#8211; 
sponsibility which will weigh heavily against you on 
the day of trial. Besides this&#44; what avails all your 
seeming religious conduct in other respects&#44; what use 
can be in 3&#39;our coming to the house of God and claim&#8211; 
ing atfinity with and the rights of Israelites&#58; if you 
are determined&#44; that with your death your family are 
to be cast out from the community of the Lord&#63; &#8212; Or 
do you believe&#44; that in the progress of time the old 
covenant will fall into disuse&#44; and that symbolical or 
imaginary rites will take its place&#44; and that among 
such Jews your children will be welcome members&#63; 
You greatly err&#44; if so you think&#59; for trust in the word 
of God&#44; trust in Ilim whose promises have never de&#8211; 
ceived&#44; the covenant of Abraham will never cease to 
be revered and observed by his latest descendants. 
For what does the text say&#58; 
&#34;And my covenant shall be in your flesh as an ever&#8211; 
lastinsr covenant&#63;&#34; &#39;Now this is both a conmiandment 
and a prophecy. As a commandment it is certain 
and undeniable that for thousands of years the cove&#8211; 
nant has not alone been observed&#44; but has been highly 
prized as a glorious gift by the children of Israel. 
And as a prophecy&#44; I will merely say&#44; that as great

dangers have passed over us as are likely ever to 
occur again&#59; and that amidst all the persecutions we 
had to endure and all our own apostacies this ordi&#8211; 
nance never was forgotten or unobserved. Ay&#44; when 
the heathen oppressors prohibited the holy ordinance 
under pain of death&#44; the mothers in Israel risked 
even life itself to obey the will of God &#59; and in every 
age and every land the state of uncircumcision was 
considered a disgrace upon the sons of Jacob. &#8212; If 
therefore you wish that your children shall not be 
cast out&#44; now and for ever&#44; from the community of 
the Lord&#58; neglect not to fit them by your own act to 
be worthy members of Israel&#39;s household&#59; reflect that 
their apostacy&#44; if they should be driven to worship 
strange gods&#44; will rest upon your own souls&#59; and that 
we&#44; the sons of Jacob&#44; will never hold them as bro&#8211; 
thers who like us bear not the seal of the covenant. 
And do you not tremble at the thought&#44; that your 
descendants shall be mixed up with the nations of 
the earth&#63; prize you not the holy privilege&#44; the sacred 
birthright of being the followers of one God&#44; the in&#8211; 
heritors of the merits of Abraham&#44; the followers of 
the law of Moses&#63; &#8212; You yourselves are elated at the 
thought that you are adorers of God&#44; the believers in 
the one&#44; undivided&#44; unchanging Unity &#58; and j&#8211;et you 
care not to hand down this prerogative to your chil&#8211; 
dren&#63; You feel that a high destiny is yours&#59; you 
are convinced that the doctrines your parents taught 
you&#44; that the creed you imbibed with your mother&#39;s 
milk&#44; that the confession you early breathed&#44; &#34; The 
Lord our God the Lord is one&#44;&#34; are thoughts worthy 
of the unending God &#58; and yet you idly cast your off&#8211; 
spring into the arms of unbelief&#44; of false worship&#44; of

ideas uncongenial to Scripture&#44; unworthy of the holy 
everblessed Creator&#63; You would be shocked&#44; were 
any one to invite you to join another religion&#44; to for&#8211; 
swear directly your allegiance to Jacob&#39;s God &#58; yet 
do you feel the same regard for your children&#39;s future 
happiness&#44; when you exclude them by your own sin&#8211; 
ning from the congregation of the faithful&#33; &#8212; Perhaps 
you feel indifi&#39;erent about religious duties&#59; perhaps 
you are tinctured with infidelity&#58; and you neglect 
therefore the commandment&#44; because you do not be&#8211; 
lieve in its necessity &#33; Even then your conduct is un&#8211; 
wise. &#8212; For understand&#44; the time may come when 
your convictions may become stronger&#44; when unbelief 
may yield to a firm faith in the truth of Scripture and 
the necessity of obedience to the commandments &#58; 
how will you then do&#44; when you find yourselves sur&#8211; 
rounded by children not of the covenant&#44; by sons who 
have NO right&#44; no part in Israel&#63; &#8212; Or why will you 
not leave to your chikb&#8211;en the choice of being Israel&#8211; 
ites or not &#63; The cov&#40; lant can do them no bodily or 
mental injury&#59; it is only an acknowledgment that in 
the flesh they belong to the house of Israel &#59; and surely 
it is their right&#44; as well as it was yours at your birth&#44; 
that nothing should be done by their parents which 
of necessity must make their entrance into the great 
body of Jews more painful and more diflicult&#44; and 
consequently more uncertain&#44; than it ought to be. 
You were children of the covenant&#44; and yet you re&#8211; 
belled&#59; let your own children have the same choice&#59; 
let them if they think proper become Israelites&#44; If 
their conviction be stronger than yours&#44; if they are 
more disposed to obedience than you&#59; but let them 
never have cause to say&#44; as many no doubt have said

&#34;It 18 my father&#39;s and mother&#39;s fault that I am not 
an Israelite.&#34; 

If littleness of faith will then stand in the way of 
obedience&#44; fathers and mothers in our ancient people&#33; 
if a useless and causeless timidity will instil in you 
doubt and hesitation &#58; reflect from what stock you 
have sprung. You are believing children of believ&#8211; 
ing ancestors &#59; I will never credit that there is one 
Israelite&#44; no matter hew irreligious&#44; who is without 
religious belief. Yes&#44; you are of that people to whom 
a trust in God is natural in all their backsliding&#59; your 
forefathers were they who in their owu persons and 
that of their children ever sanctified the name of the 
Lord &#59; and therefore arouse yourselves and resolve to 
be worthy of such an enviable ancestry. Abraham 
was faithful&#44; so was Isaac&#44; so was Sarah&#44; so was Zip&#8211; 
porah&#44; so was Joshua&#44; so were the millions who have 
80 long borne the name of the congregation of Jacob&#59; 
and at this late day&#44; when&#44; after the clouds of oppres&#8211; 
sion have been almost totally chased away&#44; the sun of 
freedom begins to shed his benignant light also upon 
our long&#8211;oppressed race&#44; it were surely ungrateful to 
the Deitj&#39; to refuse to observe any longer on our part 
the terms of the covenant&#44; when He&#44; true and faith&#8211; 
ful to His word&#44; has been our God as He was the God 
of Abraham&#44; and never has withdrawn from us his 
light&#44; his law&#44; his knowledge&#44; his protection&#44; and his 
goodness&#44; as we see clearly proved this day. Arise 
then in your might&#44; beloved brothers&#33; and in the 
words of the prophet &#40;Isaiah li. 2&#41;&#58; &#34;Look unto 
Abraham your father&#44; and unto Sarah that bore you&#59; 
for one he was when I called him&#44; and I blessed and 
increased him.&#34; &#8212; Yes&#44; it was through faith that he

was blessed &#59; alone he wandered forth&#44; childless at 
the age of seventy&#8211;five&#44; from his father&#39;s house&#44; to 
follow the guidance of the Lord&#59; childless as regards 
Sarah he was at the age of ninety&#8211;nine years &#58; then 
he became perfect through obedience&#44; through faith&#44; 
and the covenant&#44; and since that period he became 
through Isaac the father of a multitude of people&#44; of 
a people that has maintained the glory of the Su&#8211; 
preme in all parts of God&#39;s earth &#59; of a people trod&#8211; 
den down and pillaged&#44; yet upheld by faith&#44; living in 
the belief of the truth of the Lord&#44; confiding in the 
justice of his decrees. &#8212; It was Sarah&#39;s happiness to 
shelter in her bosom the first of those circumcised on 
the eighth day&#59; and like her companion through 
many a weary pilgrimage&#44; through many a sore trial&#44; 
she thus had a share in sacrificing in faith her own 
feelings&#44; her own repugnance&#44; in obedience to the 
will of her God. May her daughters feel the same 
call to sanctify&#33; and may they hasten&#44; in order to 
ward off danger from their husbands&#44; and condemna&#8211; 
tion from their children&#44; to cause these to enter into 
the covenant of Abraham. And may the fathers 
glory that none of their pledges of conjugal love are 
excluded from the household of our Lord &#59; but that 
sons alike and daughters are children of salvation&#44; 
heirs to the glory and hope promised unto Israel &#33; 

And thou&#44; angel of the covenant&#44; the messenger ot 
happy tidings&#33; be present in spirit&#44; whenever this 
sacrifice is brought&#58; bless&#44; in the name of the ever&#8211; 
lasting God&#44; each child and every parent&#59; and pro&#8211; 
claim before the mercy&#8211;seat of Glory&#44; that we are true 
to the law&#44; unforgetful of the ancient statutes&#44; and 
submissive to the divine command. And join thy

Brethren&#33; 

In reading the Bible&#44; the record of the will of God 
and of the doings of the forefathers of our peopl &#59; 
and of those who came in contact with them&#44; it is 
requisite that we should not mistake history for ex&#8211; 
ample&#44; and look upon all the transactions we read of 
as acts which we may freely imitate. For the Scrip&#8211; 
tures nowhere say&#44; that we should strive to copy any 
one of all those whose lives are recorded&#59; and if we 
arc even informed that one or the other of the Bible 
characters was a man after God&#39;s own heart&#44; it by no 
means follows that every act of his life was praise&#8211; 
worthy. On the contrary&#44; we are presented with the 
law and in it with the duties which we should fulfil&#44; 
and the deeds which we should avoid&#59; and by its 
standard therefore we are to measure our lives&#44; to do 
nothing which is in opposition to the same&#44; regardless 
what others may have done&#44; and to judge likewise of 
the transactions which are related to us&#44; whether 
they be examples to be followed&#44; or instances of de&#8211; 
ficiency in virtue or faith which it is our duty to 
avoid. &#8212; The Bible is a veritable record of all matters 
which it concerns us to know &#59; and as the great and 
good characters of which it speaks were like ourselves 
fallible and sinning &#58; it gives us a faithful statement 
of their bad no less than their good deeds &#59; since the 

<pb n="264"/>

264 RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. 

prophets and inspired writers&#44; whilst recording the 
backslidings of God&#39;s favourites&#44; knew that no one 
could be misled by the bad examples occasionally ex&#8211; 
hibited by these&#44; because the rule was also transmitted 
according to which every action of theirs&#44; or of other 
men&#44; must either be justified or condemned. If then 
we find not a single perfect man in the Bible&#44; if every 
one whose life is recorded was at times guilty of faults 
and want of faith &#58; it is no more than saying&#44; that the 
great men of ancient days were&#44; like those of our 
own times&#44; compounds of good and evil. And herein 
we must admire the perfect artlessness discoverable 
in the inspired writings. Nothing is told for eflfect &#59; 
no elaborate defences of&#8211; characters are any where to 
be found&#44; and no extenuation is offered to make us 
think kindly of the acts which our own judgment 
must lead us to condemn&#44; but which our feelings 
might extenuate if our sympathies were appealed to. 
It is therefore very questionable&#44; whether the cause 
of religion can gain any thing by our oflering&#44; at this 
late day&#44; excuses for acts which the Bible merely re&#8211; 
cords&#59; for if such a course had been deemed neces&#8211; 
sary&#44; no doubt the Lord&#39;s spirit would have impelled 
the prophets to adopt the same. Their silence should 
accordingly teach us caution&#44; how we attempt to clear 
the fame of those we justly prize of the charge of 
occasional disobedience and crime&#44; which the holy 
Text has laid against them. &#34;We may safely maintain 
moreover&#44; that infidelity gains nothing by the frailty 
of the servants of the Lord &#59; nor can religion lose by 
our candidly admitting that human nature was the 
same in all ages &#59; and that&#44; though some have had 
greater light&#44; no one was so perfect that he did not 

<pb n="265"/>

at some period or other of his earthly existence call 
for and need the forgiveness of God. 

I deemed this much necessary before introducing 
to you the text to which I wish to draw your atten&#8211; 
tion to&#8211;day &#59; inasmuch as it is an expression of cen&#8211; 
snre on the life of David&#44; just thrown out by the sa&#8211; 
cred historian in the account he presents to us of 
the last days of this renowned king of Israel. You 
are all well aware how highly David is valued as a 
man devoted to the Lord&#44; still we find him occasion&#8211; 
ally in the light of a grievous offender&#59; he retained 
the humility of a shepherd on the throne of Israel&#44; 
still he suffered his inclinations to prompt him to the 
commission of incest and an act akin to murder. 
With all this he was a character of great excellence&#44; 
and had a mind but rarely found among men. And 
in his repentance and his prayers we have an illustri&#8211; 
ous example of humiliation of the mortal before the 
Everlasting&#44; and an incentive not to despair of mercy 
even when we have grievously sinned. &#8212; David had 
all his life been the mark for malice and persecution&#59; 
and if you calculate what he suffered from external 
enemies&#44; intestine confusion&#44; and the miscond&#58;&#58;&#58;ct of 
his own children&#44; you will say that his days were by 
no means of an even and happy current. Even his 
last moments were embittered by the arrogance of 
one of his sons&#44; who aimed to usurp the government 
before his futher&#39;s lamp of life had expired. Now 
the Scriptures do not enter into long details to ac&#8211; 
count for the heinous crime of Adonijah&#44; but state 
simply &#58;

&#34; And his father had never aggrieved him&#44; saying&#44; Why hast 
thou done thus&#63;&#34; 1 Kings i. 6. 



Parents&#33; look well to the fate of the son of Da&#8211; 
vid&#44; who had never betn checked by his father. lie 
was a man described as exceedingly handsome&#44; as a 
favourite of many of his father&#39;s friends&#44; and the oldest 
in point of birth of the yet remaining sons of the 
dying king. He must have known that it was his 
father&#39;s wish&#44; by the express command of God&#44; that 
the younger Solomon &#40;1 Chronicles xxviii. 5&#41;&#44; on ac&#8211; 
count no doubt of his greater wisdom&#44; should suc&#8211; 
ceed to the government &#59; and yet he would not fore&#8211; 
go his imaginary rights in deference to his father&#39;s 
will&#44; but r&#8211;ebelled and proclaimed himself king by 
means of a faction in the state&#44; who doubtless were 
in fear of losing their influence if the people were to 
elevate Solomon to the vacant throne. &#8212; Adonijah we 
are told had never been reproved by his father&#44; and 
this indulgence&#44; unwisely extended&#44; caused him in 
this weighty point also to regard his own will mere&#8211; 
ly &#58; and the sequel was&#44; that David during his life&#8211; 
time appointed Solomon his successor&#59; and tlie folly 
of the disappointed aspirant was at length the cause 
that he was slain by order of his brother as an enemy 
to the internal repose of the realm &#59; since with his 
first failure he had not yet learned to rest content 
with a private station&#44; for which he was better fitted 
than the rule over a people like Israel. 

Parents &#33; regard well the evil effects of indulgence 
to your children&#44; and learn early to avoid a similar 
fault in your own fomilies. The responsibility rest&#8211; 
ing upon you is of the first magnitude &#59; you are the 

<pb n="267"/>

RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. 267 

progenitors of beings who have an intelligent soul&#44; 
and a mixed disposition which both prompts to good 
and to evil. The Lord&#44; we may freely say without 
employing the words figuratively&#44; has placed in your 
hands intelligent souls for your safe&#8211;keeping&#59; as we 
read in Psalm cxxvii. 3 &#58; &#34; Lo &#33; children are a herit&#8211; 
age of the Lord&#59;&#34; and it is your business&#44; the em&#8211; 
ployment of your whole life&#44; to see that no neglect 
of yours should jeopard or injure their earthly or 
heavenly happiness. Understand&#44; though you have 
a claim upon them as their bodily parents&#44; there is 
yet One who is your and their Author&#44; and who has 
consequently a claim upon your own selves&#44; and a 
superior right in your children&#44; and He has a just 
title to demand of you a due care and watchfulness 
over the charges He has intrusted to your temporary 
custody. You must therefore begin at the very out&#8211; 
set to educate them with correct principles&#44; and to 
train them early in the way they should go. &#8212; Let us 
endeavour to sketch a plan of domestic education. 
The infant of a few months old has some penetr&#59;ition&#44; 
and it speedily contrives ways and means to satisfy 
its cravings. If any object strikes its fancy and its 
weak powers prevent it tVom seizing the same&#44; it 
will probably cry and weep till it be satisfied&#44; or till 
it find its striving ineffectual. If the child succeeds 
but once in thus gaining its point&#44; it will to a cer&#8211; 
tainty repeat the experiment to gain its end by a 
few tears opportunely applied. Here now begins the 
duty of the mother&#44; and it is her province to discover 
whether the infant&#39;s petulance proceed from pain or 
a perverse disposition If from pain she should of 
course apply soothing remedies&#44; whether internal or 

<pb n="268"/>

268 RELIGIOUS EDUCATION&#44; 

otherwise&#44; to remove the cause of sufiering&#59; but if she 
is convinced it is mere wilfuhiess&#44; it would be highly 
injudicious to bribe it into qniet. Although a noisy 
child is very troublesome and unpleasant&#44; it is much 
better both for its own sake and that of the parents 
that it should weep and fret&#44; till exhaustion at length 
produce quiet and submission. It is of course out of 
the question to reason with a small child &#59; a passive 
overcoming of a perverse disposition is therefore per&#8211; 
haps the only remedy&#44; and it is requisite that it should 
be employed despite of its apparent unpleasantness. 

Another duty springs from this consideration as a 
necessary consequence of what we have advanced. 
It is&#44; that it is unwise for the mother to surrender 
her child into the care of servants&#44; even at the ten&#8211; 
derest age. It is natural that a servant&#44; the best 
even of her class&#44; should endeavour to make her task 
as easy as possible&#44; and to gain the favour of the mis&#8211; 
tress by quieting her charge at all hazards. I will 
not now mention the danger of bodily injury&#44; aris&#8211; 
ing from giving it sedative or stupefying medicines&#44; 
though this too has been done&#59; but confine myself 
merely to the moral evil of spoiling the disposition 
by early indulgence. The mother&#44; as a professor of 
our faith&#44; is not at liberty to divest herself of the 
duty incumbent on her&#44; both by nature and religion&#44; 
of watching over the moral progress of her offspring. 
If the child were sick&#44; even slightly&#44; the world would 
call her unfeeling&#44; if she were to leave it in the hands 
of a nurse and go about seeking her pleasures abroad &#58; 
how nmch more has the moralist a right to tax her 
with neglect&#44; if she is so callous to its moral happi&#8211; 
uess&#44; as to leave the development of its dawning mind 

<pb n="269"/>

RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. 269 

in hands who can naturally feel no inducement&#44; ex&#8211; 
cept in rare instances&#44; to do what is asked of them 
with the least more labour than it is absolutely re&#8211; 
quisite. There are among those who undertake the 
charge of infants females of excellent endowments&#44; 
whom poverty or adverse circumstances compel to 
enter the service of their fellow&#8211;beings&#59; there are 
such who in a menial station are anxious to discharge 
the duties they have assumed with honour and fidel&#8211; 
ity &#59; but they are not so general as to render it a safe 
thing for parents to transfer their prerogative&#44; or their 
duty rather&#44; to strange hands&#59; and besides&#44; how can 
the mother expect that her child shall be well cared 
for by others for the sake of the small pittance of 
weekly wages&#44; if the ties of nature cannot secure for 
it the mother&#39;s superintendence &#63; &#8212; I do not mean to 
say that the mother is bound to be perpetually with 
the child&#44; that she is to take no recreation&#44; and is 
not permitted to leave it for a moment with others &#59; 
no&#33; but that she is not at liberty to rest satisfied if 
the child does not trouble her&#44; and to be content to 
leave it in the hands of servants three&#8211;fourths of the 
day&#44; provided it does not happen to be sick. &#8212; In 
short&#44; education should begin from the cradle&#59; the 
child must be thwarted if it is petulant and unruly&#59; 
its temper and inclination must be curbed as soon as 
it displays any undue anger or makes unreasonable 
demands&#59; and it must not be forgotten&#44; that indul&#8211; 
gence once commenced&#44; it may be very difficult&#44; if 
not altogether impossible&#44; to remedy the fault in 
after&#8211;life. 

As soon as the child begins to speak and his reasoa 
becomes in a degree more developed&#44; the difficulty&#44; 

23&#42; 

<pb n="270"/>

270 RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. 

which hitherto existed in discovering the source of 
infantile sorrow&#44; will of course be in great degree re&#8211; 
moved&#44; and consequently the remedies to be applied 
will be more apparent. But as at tliis period children 
arc perhaj&#41;s more interesting than at any other&#44; espe&#8211; 
cially to their parents&#44; greater care should be used to 
guard against indulgence. Moreover&#44; us speech is now 
in his possession&#44; the child can demand more intelli&#8211; 
gibly what he wants than formerly Ijy mere dumb 
signs and motions. And if you value the peace of 
your house and the welfare of youi&#8211; oll&#39;spring&#44; be res&#8211; 
olute to peiHcvere in your refusals&#44; and to jjromise 
notliing which you might tliink injurious to the child. 
It is no use whatever in first saying no&#44; and then to 
be persuaded or coaxed into yielding&#59; for&#44; depend 
u&#44;pon it&#44; children are very quick&#8211;sighted&#44; and soon dis&#8211; 
cover&#44; if yielded to&#44; that they can gain the mastery 
over their parents by petulance and perseverance. 
They will at first try the experiment in small mat&#8211; 
ters&#59; but they will soon rise in their demands&#44; and 
increase with an increase of years and opportunity in 
exacting compliance from the over&#8211;good nature of 
their elders. Make it then a rule&#44; not to refuse any 
thing that is necessary or reasonable to the child&#39;s 
comfort&#44; or occasionally even to his pleasure&#59; for it is 
well at times to encourage him&#44; though not by offer&#8211; 
ing a direct bribe for obedience. But if you have 
relused&#44; let no tears or entreaty move you irom your 
purpose. It may seem hard to be so persevering in 
refusing a trifle which is perhaps of no importance 
whatever&#59; but it becomes of importance as soon as it 
may tend directly or indirectly to relax wholesome 
domestic discipline&#59; and the only way to avoid this 

<pb n="271"/>

disagreeable alternative is not to refuse in haste and 
without due consideration. If you are then resolute 
in your determination&#44; and exhibit withal no uune&#8211; 
cessarv petulance or testiness in your expression of 
dissent &#58; the child will speedily learn that he has noth&#8211; 
ing to gain by a teasing perseverance&#44; and the father&#39;s 
refusal or the mother&#39;s no will then be a sufficient 
answer to all his silly demands &#44; especially if he finds
that every things reasonable is readily conceded. Let 
me sum up this part in a few words&#58; Obedience 
should be made one of the first things which the child 
should be able to recollect&#59; it ought to be the earliest 
principle instilled in the mind&#59; and the necessary 
consequenoe will be&#44; that obedience in maturer years 
will become more easy on the part of the son or 
daughter&#44; and he more easily exacted by the father or 
mother. 

Another observation I have to make in respect to 
children from one to three years old &#58; it is&#44; to be very 
guarded against nourishing the prinoiples of envy and 
revenge at this early age. It may be necessary&#44; as a 
punishment for disobedience&#44; to deny to one child 
the indulgenee granted to another&#59; but great care 
must be taken not to excite the feeling of envy in the 
delinquent &#59; tell him&#44; that it is a consequence of obe&#8211; 
dience in the brother that he is more favoured&#44; and 
that you hope that he will to&#8211;morrow merit the same 
by doing what is right. It were perhaps better at 
times not to bestow the distinctive mark of favour 
before the other child&#44; if you know from observation 
that he is of a sensitive disposition. Be judicious in 
this point especially&#44; as it is not unfrequently the case 
that quarrels between members of a family have been

the consequence of early favouritism &#59; and it is unfor&#8211; 
tunately too true&#44; that parents themselves are by de&#8211; 
grees led to look upon one or the other of their children 
with more kindness than the others. This is radically 
wronG&#34;&#58; it not only fails in correction as a punish&#8211; 
ment&#44; but it becomes a downright incentive to stub&#8211; 
bornness and a carelessness in doing the duties de&#8211; 
manded&#58; if the child should be induced to think that 
he is ill&#8211;treated&#44; especially if he discovers tliat an&#8211; 
other&#39;s faults are either overlooked altogether&#44; or not 
so severely visited as his own. &#8212; With regard to the 
feelins&#58; of reveucce&#44; it will no doubt be self&#8211;evidetit to 
you&#44; that there are a thousand incentives to excite 
this unholy passion in the mind of the young. If any 
thing unpleasant occurs to them&#44; they will naturally 
appeal to their parents for protection and redress&#59; 
and if you have to interfere in their behalf&#44; be it 
against a servant&#44; a stranger&#44; or one of their own rel&#8211; 
atives&#44; do it in a mild&#44; decorous manner&#59; do not let 
your children see&#44; that you think they have suft&#39;ered 
a great wrong&#59; do not go about executing justice in 
a boisterous&#44; excited manner&#58; do not speak loudly 
to the delinquent in the presence of the oftended 
party &#59; for all sucli exhibitions only encourage the chil&#8211; 
dren in tale&#8211;bearing and seeking of revenge for every&#44; 
the slightest injury. Nor&#44; is it correct to pacify even 
the child&#44; if he should accidentally get iujured&#44; by 
striking a chair or any other inanimate object&#44; as 
though it had offended&#59; for this too encourages in a 
very reprehensible manner the feeling of revenge&#44; 
which should be repressed in a good system of edu&#8211; 
cation&#44; as unfortunately it is but too apt to be called 
into play in later years by associates and circum&#8211; 

<pb n="273"/>

RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. 273 

stances. Moreover&#44; such a procedure is irrational&#44; 
since tlie imaginary punishment of the imaginary de&#8211; 
linquent is merely calculated to pacify a child without 
any thought or feeling except hlind vengeance &#59; and 
it is evidently requisite to exhibit in your own con&#8211; 
duct towards your children&#44; even in early youth&#44; noth&#8211; 
ing that hereafter 3&#39;ou should have to tell them was 
the effect of folly. You lower thereby your authority&#44; 
and derogate from your dignity as moral guides&#44; and 
it is of the utmost importance that this should not 
take place. For if you really wish to ba not only be&#8211; 
loved but also respected by your children&#44; you must 
endeavour that in their eyes at least you should stand 
as high&#44; if not higher as moral preceptors&#44; than any 
body else &#59; because by this means the task of govern&#8211; 
ing your household will be much lightened&#44; and ren&#8211; 
dered more pleasant to yourselves&#44; and more profita&#8211; 
ble to your offspring. 

If you discover that your child has any evil propen&#8211; 
sity&#44; no matter how young he is&#44; do not withhold pun&#8211; 
ishment. For if the fault is curable&#44; it is more easily 
so in the beginning&#44; and when it first shows itself&#44; than 
when it has become confirmed and grown into an in&#8211; 
veterate habit. Little children are men in miniature&#44; 
and all the germs of a good or bad character are ex&#8211; 
istinsr in them no less than in adults&#58; hence the ne&#8211; 
cessity of treating their foibles as the sources of crime 
in later years. For instance&#44; should you see one of 
your children snatch at any little thing you give to 
another&#44; or demand a larger portion for his share&#58; you 
may safely say&#44; that this fs a display of covetousness&#44; 
and you should lose no time in counteracting it. &#8212; If 
you see that your little sou is fond of teasing domes&#8211;

tic animals&#44; and taking a delight in inflicting pain 
upon them&#44; or if you detect him in pinching or beat&#8211; 
ing his brothers and sisters &#58; you have cause to trem&#8211; 
ble for this early exhibition of ferocity&#44; and you must 
lose no time and pretermit no diligence to remove so 
hateful a characteristic. &#8212; If you see him indulge in 
violent outbursts of rage&#44; it is not well to buy him 
him off or to bribe him into good humour&#59; for this 
would be paying him a premium for a display of an 
odious feature&#59; but the evident duty of a religious 
parent is to endeavour to subdue this failing&#44; both by 
mildness&#44; as far as prudent&#44; and a well&#8211;timed severity 
where this may advantageously come into play. &#8212; It 
is no doubt true&#44; that a father or mother&#44; particularly 
towards an only child&#44; may think it hard to be so se&#8211; 
vere&#59; but let us ask&#44; what benefit can result from a 
winking at faults which will become daily more ap&#8211; 
parent and fixed&#63; You would be truly ashamed&#44; 
were your son at the age of twelve to show a covet&#8211; 
ous&#44; cruel&#44; or quarrelsome temperament&#59; you would 
be grieved to hear any one say&#44; &#34; &#34;Wliat an unman&#8211; 
nered&#44; rude boy this is &#63;&#34; &#8212; Why then will you not 
begin at once&#44; before his character is formed&#44; to give 
his mind a proper bent&#63; Or think you that you will 
be able to remedy the defect of early indulgence by 
greater rigour and severity at a later period &#63; You 
should however consider that&#44; if your son could mas&#8211; 
ter you when an infant&#44; he is not likely to submit to 
control as he advances in years&#59; and even if you are 
determined to curb him then&#44; and grant even that 
you should succeed&#44; does it not strike you&#44; that 3&#39;ou 
will have to undertake the unpleasant task of thwart&#8211; 
ing him at last&#44; and to cause him thereby grief and

vexation fully as much as tliough you had always re&#8211; 
strained him&#63; If therefore you mean to govern&#44; 
govern at once &#59; and you are more likely to succeed 
in the discharge of your duty&#44; by the eai&#39;ly exercise 
of a little authoi&#39;ity and the exhibition of a little se&#8211; 
verity&#44; than you could hope for at a later date by a 
positive insisting and an undue portion of rigour&#44; 
which&#44; whether you will or not&#44; will then be requis&#8211; 
ite&#44; if you wish to have any control over your family&#44; 
in even a small degree. 

Another point must be looked after in early child&#8211; 
hood &#58; it is&#44; that you insist upon strict truth from your 
child. I know not&#44; whether it may not be a natural 
impulse to deny any thing we have done wrong in&#59; 
at all events the smallest child will say &#34;no&#34; if de&#8211; 
tected in any fault &#59; though even this may&#44; like many 
other defects&#44; be the consequence of bad example&#44; of 
which too much is always presented to us in every 
stage of life. Be this however as it may&#44; insist &#40;I need 
not say with mildness&#44; for this is a matter understood 
of itself&#41; upon the strictest truth from the youngest 
child&#59; reason with him if need be&#44; and explain in 
simple words the odiousness of falsehood&#59; tell him 
how despicable it is to be caught in an untruth&#44; and 
that generally&#44; if not always&#44; every equivocation will 
be detected&#44; and bring additional disgrace for every 
offence&#44; no matter how small&#44; which might have been 
perhaps forgiven&#44; if the truth had at once been con&#8211; 
fessed. But whilst 3&#39;ou demand unvarying truth&#44; be 
cautious that you do not deviate from it yourselves&#59; 
never threaten a punishment&#44; if you mean to be 
begged off&#59; let not the child see that you are waver&#8211; 
ing and mean not to do what you say &#59; so also if you

promise any reward&#44; be sure to fulfil your words&#59; it 
will have a very happj&#39; effect upon the young mind&#44; 
and teach it imperceptibly to love truth and to abhor 
a falsehood&#44; &#8212; In the same manner you must repress 
the pernicious habitof tale&#8211;bearing among the family&#59; 
endeavour to instil daily into every one under your 
charge to practise forbearance and good nature &#59; tell 
him&#44; that the offence was perhaps not committed on 
purpose&#44; and seek to discover whether the offended 
party might not have committed the first aggression. 
It is certainly mortifying to a high&#8211;spirited child to 
find his complaints dismissed in such a manner&#44; and 
to have the wrong laid to his charge &#59; but what mat&#8211; 
ters it that he suffers pain in this way &#63; can it do him 
any injury&#63; is his temper not improved thereby&#63; is 
not turbulence repressed &#63; malevolence rebuked &#63; and 
contention stifled&#63; Now reverse the case&#44; &#8212; suppose 
in your paternal fondness you would listen to the ac&#8211; 
cusation brought by your son against a neighbour&#39;s 
child&#44; and were without investigation to insist upon 
your friend&#39;s punishing the delinquent for the injury 
which has&#44; for all you may know&#44; been accidentally 
done&#44; or perhaps in self&#8211;defence &#59; let your son know 
that you got the offender well whipped for the out&#8211; 
rage&#44; and show your evident satisfaction at the result&#44; 
and recount the minute circumstances to your wife 
in the presence of the accuser&#58; do you not thus tell 
him to persevere in his course&#63; to do whatever mis&#8211; 
chief he pleases to others&#63; that you only will believe 
him &#8212; your darling &#8212; your child&#63; Or perhaps you 
will tell him in so many words&#44; that you will see him 
righted after this foolish fashion&#58; and as sure as you 
live&#44; you lay the foundation for a tricky&#44; quarrelsome&#44;

and highly unamiable character. &#8212; Understand dis&#8211; 
tinctly&#44; education should tend to correct the wicked 
propensities of the human heart&#44; to counteract the 
evils of bad examples&#58; and surely your system would 
be worse than no education at all&#44; if you encourage 
and by that means foster one of the worst traits to 
which we are naturally addicted. 

A domineering propensity is also occasionally 
shown by young children&#59; they will at times insist 
upon having this thing or the other&#44; and will not un&#8211; 
frequently aim a blow at a servant or an older brother 
or sister if they are not immediately gratified. If 
you discover this feeling&#44; you must oppose it at all 
hazards &#59; for if persevered in and not early eradicated&#44; 
it will grow with every day&#44; and cause them much 
unhappiness as they advance in life&#44; and render them 
truly odious in the eyes of others. The more wealth 
you have&#44; the more you are likely to leave to your 
children&#58; the stricter you must insist on an humble 
and kind bearing from them to all around them&#44; es&#8211; 
pecially to servants&#44; who naturally must feel some 
reluctance in informing you of such a fault&#44;&#8211; unless 
your sense of religion demands of you&#44; to ask for a 
correct statement of your children&#39;s conduct in your 
absence. &#8212; Observation has taught us&#44; that children 
are not unacquainted with their parents&#39; superior 
power which wealth gives them&#44; and that they are 
suflaciently apt to avail themselves of all the advan&#8211; 
tages arising therefrom&#59; especially as rich men&#39;s 
children are only too often the objects of regard to 
visitors and others who may in some way or another 
wish to propitiate their parents&#39; favour. If you are 
therefore judicious&#44; and can yourselves set a proper

value upon the glittering dross which we are all striv&#8211; 
ing for&#59; if you yourselves are impressed with the 
unsubstantial tenure you have on worldly goods and 
on your mortal life &#58; 3&#39;ou will pretermit no effort to 
enforce humility and patience&#44; and to insist by all 
means upon an amiable and decorous behaviour even 
to subordinates. Your children in this case also as 
in others should have your example to teach them 
the duty practically&#44; which your words call for in 
theory&#59; you yourselves should be kind to servants&#44; 
mild in your reproofs of them&#44; and never show any 
arrogance or pride to these and all others under your 
control and direction&#44; &#8212; You may think&#44; perhaps&#44; that 
your children will always be provided for&#44; and that 
they&#44; who work for money&#44; are not of sufficient im&#8211; 
portance to deserve protection against the favourite 
offspring of wealth and affluence&#59; but you err if you 
judge so. It is not so much the protection of the 
subordinates&#44; though this also is of vital moment&#44; as 
the improvement of the children themselves&#44; the ren&#8211; 
dering them amiable&#44; which can be attained only by 
the means we have indicated &#58; it is your duty to im&#8211; 
prove their minds&#44; and clear away thence all those 
evil qualities which may become prejudicial to their 
peace and future happiness &#59; and as we said&#44; and as 
the good sense of evei&#8211;y man will tell him&#44; no quality 
is more hateful even in the great and exalted than 
arrogance and overbearingness. &#8212; Besides this&#44; you 
oudit to reflect that&#44; in the constant mutations which 
are going on in the world&#44; no one can determine&#44; 
whether the servants now at your beck and call may 
not at some future day become exalted above your 
children&#44; and whether these may not be compelled to

ask of those&#44; who once served you and them for pay&#44; 
for aid to assist them in their necessities. Now grant 
that tljis should never be&#44; still a man may become 
useful to another in a thousand great and little ways&#59; 
and the love of a menial secured may stand in good 
stead to you and them in situations where the assist&#8211; 
ance of the great is of no avail. &#8212; In addition to all 
this the servant is a child of God&#44; and as such claims 
your protection&#44; the more so because he is subject to 
your power. This therefore is an additional reason&#44; 
why you should insist upon a conciliatory conduct 
from your children&#44; the younger as well as the older&#44; 
to your domestics&#44; and show to them that you like&#8211; 
wise are not backward in this important duty&#44; which 
you as servants of God must exact of them. 

If by the visitation of the Lord you have been de&#8211; 
prived of one or more children&#44; let this be no excuse 
for undue indulgence extended to those that remain. 
It were indeed making a bad use of the achnouition 
of Heaven&#44; to convert it into a curse &#40;for so indulgence 
is&#41; to intelligent&#44; accountable beings. The mother 
may perhaps fancy&#44; that in the cry of the child before 
her she is impelled to kindness by the memory of 
those who were taken&#59; but it is ii mere weakness 
which may readily be overcome by a little fortitude&#44; 
bj&#39; considering that to indulge the living cannot re&#8211; 
store the dead. It is surely a singular infatuation&#44; 
which can only be explained by supposing that the 
parents attach a strangely greater value to a child&#44; 
because they were deprived of others&#44; to overlook 
faults in the survivor which otherwise would have 
been checked &#59; and it requires no profound thinking 
to show that it is unwise for many reasons. First&#44; it

looks like dissatisfaction with the will of God&#44; and a 
stuhboniness in submitting to his irrcvoeable decree&#59; 
and secondly&#44; the child so educated will not have any 
cause to thank his parents for spoiling him&#44; not to 
mention other considerations which readily present 
themselves. 

We will now sum up this part of our subject biiefly. 
It is the duty of the parents conjointly&#44; to watch over 
the dispositions of their children from the earliest 
age&#59; to check every fault&#44; and to counteract every 
evil propensity&#59; not to be moved by tears&#44; by petu&#8211; 
lance or perseverance&#44; but to act with their respon&#8211; 
sibility to the Lord before them. This supervision 
must not be intrusted to others&#44; no matter who they 
are&#59; but father and mother themselves must fnltil the 
trust which they have received&#44; and to execute which 
they are mutually pledged to one another. &#8212; They 
should reflect that David&#44; who is styled &#34;a man after 
God&#39;s heart&#44;&#34; is censured in the holy Scriptures for 
a neglect of his authority in the case of one of his 
sons&#44; who in consequence met with an untimely and 
violent death. It is not to be supposed that early in&#8211; 
dulgence will have this unhappy effect in all instances&#59; 
but the resulting&#8211;evils are sufficiently great and ap&#8211; 
palling without supposing extreme cases. Still if we 
could examine carefully the lives of great malefactors 
and sinners&#44; we would no doubt lind&#44; that the early 
folly of their parents laid the foundation for their tem&#8211; 
poral or permanent unhappiness. &#8212; Let me apjieal to 
you then&#44; brothers and sisters of the house of Jacob I 
to fulfil your trust in the spirit and letter of the law&#44; 
and cause thereby that your children nuiy live long 
and happy in tlie fear of the Lord&#44; and bless their

earthly parents who early restrained their sinful pro&#8211; 
pensities&#44; and pointed out to them thus the road which 
leads to the mansions of everlastina&#59; felicitv &#33; 

May the Lord our God enlighten our spirit with 
his wisdom&#44; and bless us with his grace&#44; even as lie 
was with our fathers&#33; Amen.

Brethren &#33; 

In my preceding address I endeavoured to sketch 
out a simple and comprehensive plan of a domestic 
education of young children in accordance with the 
principles of our Ileaven&#8211;born religion&#59; and I trust 
that the rules wdiich I considered it my duty to lay 
before you will be found both practicable aud con&#8211; 
sonant with reason. And I candidly believe that the 
duty of early government of the household is&#44; like 
all other duties demanded by our law&#44; the best pro&#8211; 
moter of domestic happiness and a useful life in after&#8211; 
3&#39;ears. &#8212; Let us to&#8211;day pursue the subject in its more 
distinct branches and later applicability. &#8212; We arc 
taught in the Proverbs of Solomon &#58; 

&#34;Train up the boy in the way he should go &#58; and even when he 
is old he will not depart from it.&#34; Prov. xxii. 6. 

Another version of this verse is&#44; &#34;Train the boy ac&#8211; 
cording to his capacity&#44;&#34; which&#44; although slightly 
dificring from the common translation&#44; does by no 
means change its meaning. The wise king of Is&#8211; 
rael wished to impress upon the parents the duty of 
watching over the conduct and progress of the child&#44; 
and to aftbrd him such instruction&#44; suited to his ca&#8211; 

<pb n="283"/>

pacitj and 3&#39;ears&#44; as will engrave itself deeply upon 
bis mind&#44; and will not be eradicated or forgotten&#44; 
even wben the frosty years of old age have long 
since banished the days of youth&#44; and the early in&#8211; 
structors are laid low in the silent grave. To insure 
this happy result it is necessary that you should begin 
correctly&#44; and start in such a manner that you need 
not retrace any step you have once taken. Begin 
therefore with correct principles&#44; and inform the child 
early&#44; in a manner suited to his years&#44; of the duties 
which he owes to God as the creature of the Supreme&#44; 
and to man as a member of the human family at large. 
And as soon as he is able to .&#39;earn teach him&#44; after 
the good custom of our people&#44; to glorify the Lord 
by the words of his mouth&#59; make him early familiar 
with the truth that He our God&#44; is One&#44; that He is 
the sole Euler and Governor of the universe&#44; and 
that from Him alone proceeds all the good we enjoy. 
Let his first thoughts be fixed upon the profession of 
our faith&#59; lot liim know by heart&#44; as the first of his 
acquisition in knowledge&#44; the Shemang&#44; &#34;Hear&#44; O Is&#8211; 
rael&#44; the Lord our God&#44; the Lord is One&#59;&#34; let him 
learn it too in the sacred tongue&#44; which&#44; together with 
the law&#44; is a blessed inheritance from our fathers. 
Instruct him in simple and to him intelligible words 
how to address the throne of Grace&#59; so that he may 
at once be made to feel that he is a dependent on the 
bounty of the Supreme&#44; and a servant of a spiritual 
Being who watches over all his acts&#44; and rewards the 
good and punishes the evil. 

In doing this&#44; however&#44; you should speak to him as 
a rational being&#44; and not make use of superstitious 
terrors to frighten him into an unwilling obedience&#44; 

<pb n="284"/>

nor attribute to the Deity feelings and qualities which 
are foreign to the Bible doctrines. Our God is so ex&#8211; 
alted&#44; so pure&#44; so unspeakably&#44; that every attempt 
to invest Him with human frailties is blasphemous in 
the extreme &#59; and in serving Him we cannot go far&#8211; 
ther astray from true piety&#44; by any misconduct what&#8211; 
ever&#44; than by an indulgence in superstition. It is 
thus your duty&#44; as guardians of an accountable spirit&#44; 
to make your child a devoted worshipper&#44; not an ig&#8211; 
norant bigot&#44; not a terrified believer in nonentities. 
Religion in its most extended sense is the diametri&#8211; 
cally opposite to such folly &#59; and it is therefore your 
first duty to&#39; teach the true worship without admixing 
imaginary fears and ideal terrors. Hence you must 
not permit on any account to let your child be enter&#8211; 
tained by ghost&#8211;stories or the exploded notions of 
witchcraft&#44; lest his reason become obscured by such 
revolting inconsistencies. And there is danger of 
this being the case even now &#59; for it is true&#44; though 
an apparent paradox&#44; that the mind of most human 
beings has a fondness for the marvellous and for har&#8211;

ing&#44; in ever so small a measure&#44; you may cane him 
in maturer years to run the danger of embracing in&#8211; 
lidelity and unbelief&#44; when he&#34; discovers that&#39;the 
terrors of his youth are idle&#44; and when a defective 
education has blended these intimately with the ever&#8211; 
lasting truths of religion. For in the presumption 
of boyish arrogance&#44; many are induced to judge from 
uncertain premises and hastily drawn conclusions&#59; 
they think they have a thorough knowledge of every 
abstruse subject presented to tliem&#44; because they have 
acquired a little information in popular sciences&#44; or a 
superficial acquaintance with one or the other of the 
learned professions. If they now have any cause to 
connect religion with acknowledged falsities&#44; they are 
too apt to reject both&#59; because they do not weigh the 
evidences and the overwhelming authority by which 
the former is supported&#44; though the latter rest on no 
foundation wiiatever. K&#39;ow it is against this unhappy 
result that you must guard the child from the begin&#8211; 
ning&#59; let therefore acknowledged truths alone&#39; be 
brought to his view&#44; that he may not have any occa&#8211; 
sion to unlearn or reject as false and unreasonable 
any thing he has once imbibed under your instruction 
or by your sufferance.&#8212; The second is&#44; that by mak&#8211; 
ing the child early familiar with false conceptions&#44; you 
may leave an impression which cannot be effaced &#59; 
and there is&#44; therefore&#44; besides the just mentioned 
danger of infidelity&#44; which may possibly be the conse&#8211; 
quence of an acquaintance with superstition&#44; another 
but little less injurious. If the mind has become once 
saturated with horrors&#44; it is with some temperaments 
likely enough that the impression wnll never wear 
away&#44; but give a colouring to thoughts&#44; feelings and

It may perhaps be said&#44; that the age of superstition 
has passed away&#44; that general enlightenment will 
cause a greater tendency to an entire unbelief in all 
spiritual beings&#44; than an adoption of acknowledged 
nonentities. There may be truth in this remark&#44; 
with regard to the majority of men in civilized coun&#8211; 
tries &#59; but experience has also shown&#44; that there are 
many exceptions&#44; and that the mind can be warped 
by false inculcations to adopt any absurdity which 
can enter the imagination of the veriest madman that 
ever lived. Superstition and Jnysticism the most 
horrible have existed side by side with the most 
reckless infidelity&#59;&#42; and daily experience proves that 
at this very hour there are men&#44;&#8224; nay among the 
most enlightened&#44; who put faith in ridiculous preten&#8211; 
sions to revelation which would have disgraced the 
age of the crusaders. &#8212; Now a superstitious mind is 
constantly alive to unfounded apprehensions&#44; and in&#8211; 
vests with power things which are either powerless&#44; 
or are at all events innocuous&#59; and such fancies will 
at length destroy a healthy religious sentiment&#44; and 
banish perhaps a reliance on the protection of the 
Supreme. Moreover&#44; superstition&#44; by substituting a

&#8212; &#40;Since this was written the new superstition of spiritual manifes&#8211; 
tations has taken its rise&#44; and it has probably not yet seen its cul&#8211; 
minating point&#44; while in many persons the belief in true religion 
has become completely extinguished by it to all appearance. June

heap maledictions upon the nnfortunate&#44; and eagerly

God &#58; such as the ideas of a total rejection from 
grace&#44; an impossibility of repentance&#44; an implaca&#8211; 
bility of the Merciful One&#44; a supposition of atone&#8211; 
ment through a mediator only&#44; and similar unscrip&#8211; 
tural errors. Happily these errors are not properly 
belonging to our people&#59; we are&#44; perhaps&#44; freer than 
any other class of men from gross superstition and 
false belief&#59; we may freely say that Israelites have 
for the greater portion a general and correct knowl&#8211; 
edge of the unchangeable truths of the Bible &#58; it is 
nevertheless not to be denied that minor superstition 
has not been always foreign to us&#44; and that we have 
often borrowed the erroneous notions of the difierent 
countries in which we happened to live. I need not 
entertain you with the details of the confident belief 
in the existence of witches and ghosts&#44; in the efficacy 
of charms and conjuration&#44; of good and evil omens&#44; 
of signs and portents&#44; which belief is even now not 
altogether extinct&#44; to convince you of the correctness 
of the assertion &#58; your own knowledge of the subject 
is amply sufficient without extraneous proof. JSTor 
is it necessary to investigate how such absurdities 
were ever engrafted upon the doctrines of Holy Writ&#44; 
which energetically teach the opposite views. Enough 
for our purpose that we in the process of time did not 
escape the contaminating influence of error which ig&#8211; 
nora&#44;nce liad caused to prevail among gentiles &#59; and 
hence we are bound to warn those who are to watch 
pver the education of f&#41;ur children&#44; be they parents&#44; 
guardians&#44; or teachers&#44; to use every effort to guard 
against the growth of superstition&#44; and not to permit 
their charges to become acquainted with such absur&#8211; 
dities&#44; if it can be avoided. So likewise they should

be very careful that children hear nothing of the er&#8211; 
roneous ideas concerning the Deity entertained by 
our gentile neighbours which are contrary to our 
religion &#59; since these errors will more or less check 
the growth of true piety&#44; and prevent them from ac&#8211; 
quiring an early or correct comprehension of the at&#8211; 
tributes of the Lord which are contained in the law. 
The subject of correct ideas of religion and the 
errors of superstition is of so great importance&#44; and 
occupies necessarily so ample a iield&#44; that a moralist 
might well be excusec&#39;&#44; if he were to spend many 
hours in depicting it in its various ramifications. But 
as our present object is merely to regard it in con&#8211; 
nexion with a general system of education&#44; we must 
leave it in the unfinished state it has been presented 
to you&#59; since it is intended more to give you means 
for reflection than a complete illustration of the bene&#8211; 
fits of truth and the injury resulting from falsehood&#8211; 
You will however readily distinguish&#44; that the duty 
demanded of you to inculcate pure&#44; unadulterated&#44; 
religious doctrines&#44; in early youth&#44; is of the highest 
importance &#59; and that consequently you&#44; as parents&#44; 
are also bound to watch yourselves in this part of 
education over the development of the intellect of 
your child&#44; and to see that through the agency of 
others no errors are instilled which might prevent 
the spread of truth and piety. Hence it is requisite&#44; 
that the child be not left in the society of those who 
would either from ignorance or design counteract 
this part of domestic education &#59; and if you have to 
intrust him occasionally to domestics&#44; forbid them en&#8211; 
ergetically to indulge him with superstitious stories&#44; 
or to instruct him in any manner in doctrines foreign

to our religion&#44; &#8212; So also&#44; you should newr use ter&#8211; 
rors of a mental nature to frighten him&#44; or to make 
strange noises&#44; as though an extraordinary being were 
coming to inflict some indefinite vengeance for any 
act of disobedience. All this is totally wrong. You&#44; 
the parents&#44; should make your words respected by 
every one in your house &#59; in all worldly matters your 
orders should be law&#44; obedience to which you should 
by all means enforce &#59; but more than all your child 
should be told that he is bound to obey you&#44; because 
you are his parents&#44; who provide for his wants and 
watch over him with fondness and care&#44; that&#44; as far 
as lies in your power&#44; no evil shall happen to him&#59; 
be in earnest in your determination&#44; and command 
nothing about which you may afterwards be indiffer&#8211; 
ent &#59; and you will have no occasion to call in the aid 
of frightful figures to insure obedience. &#8212; In the same 
niann&#34;r&#44; when you think proper to reward your child&#44; 
do not employ the agency of a supernatural being&#42; to 
bring the gift to him &#59; a few times he may acquiesce 
in the truth of what you tell him&#59; but he soon will 
see through the shallow device&#44; and detect the pious 
fraud of his progenitors. It weakens your authority&#44; 
when you are convicted in the mind of your child of 
deception &#59; but reward directly&#44; tell him you give him 
this or that trifle fit is no use to give valuable things&#41;&#44; 
because he has done his duty in a manner to elicit 

&#42; As an Israelite I must condemn the system of making presents 
on gentile festivals&#44; and to use the common phrases that such or 
such an imaginary being has brought them. Israelites have noth&#8211; 
ing to do with those seasons and ideas&#44; and they had better omit 
giving presents then&#44; and reserve them for Purim or Pessach&#44; and 
tell the young folks the reason for this procedure.

your approbation&#44; and tliat you hope he will often 
give you cause to show him your satisfaction. Al&#8211; 
though now I would rocornniend a rare resort to re&#8211; 
wards&#44; as children should early learn to love virtue 
for its own sake and not on account of pay &#58; still if 
rewards are used&#44; let the child liave an opportunity 
to connect them with the approbation of his parents 
and his own good conduct &#59; he will thus be taught to 
love his duty&#44; and perform it to please his kind father 
and his affectionate mother&#44; who are so anxious to 
make him happy. 

To encourage the child in obedience it is a good 
plan to render the gradual execution of religious 
duties the means to be employed. There are hap&#8211; 
pily in our religion certain offices by which youths 
can become gradually initiated into the way they 
should go &#59; and tell your child therefore that he shall 
be a participant in the others as soon as he shows 
himself worthy by a previous observance of the duties 
already open for him. Among these initiatory acts 
we may reckon the offices in the Synagogue&#44; wliich 
can happily be held up as objects of emulation to 
young children even&#44; and which should be attainable 
only by obedience and good conduct. 80 also the 
reading of the weekly section of the prophets&#44; attain&#8211; 
able only through diligence at studies and worthy 
behaviour&#59; it will give a degree of zest to youths&#44; 
and make them look upon themselves as having a 
portion in the service of the Loid&#44; and stimulate 
them to become yet more familiar with the cere&#8211; 
monies and observances&#44; and to induce them to be 
careful in supporting the degree in religious stand&#8211; 
ing they have already attained. There are so many 

<pb n="293"/>

RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. 293 

other acts by which a gradual initiation may be 
brought about by judicious and rchgious parents&#44; 
that it is not necessary to dwell any longer upon 
details which must at last be left to their good judg&#8211; 
ment. One thing&#44; however&#44; I must mention&#44; that&#44; 
as there are no mysteries in our law&#44; you should en&#8211; 
deavour to explain every observance as well as you 
can&#44; exhibit the scope and extent thereof&#44; and give 
the reason for its institution wherever the Scriptures 
give us such a reason &#59; and where no cause is assign&#8211; 
ed&#44; for instance in those laws called statutes or ordi&#8211; 
nances&#44; you may&#44; or rather should&#44; tell your child at 
once that such commandments were instituted by 
the wisdom of God&#44; in order to preserve Israel a dis&#8211; 
tinct people among all other nations of the earth&#44; to 
be consecrated to his service. You gain greatly by 
this exposition&#59; for by expounding to him the rea&#8211; 
son&#44; where this is discoverable&#44; say for&#44; instance&#44; the 
observance of the Passover&#44; in commemoration of 
our redemption from Egypt &#59; the institution of the 
unleavened bread&#44; to celebrate the unpreparedness 
of our forefathers when they were released from 
bondage&#59; the annual Pentecost&#44; to call to mind the 
promulgation of our heavenly code of Sinai&#44; &#8212; you at 
once raise in 3&#39;our child a patriotic sentiment of at&#8211; 
tachment to Israel at large&#44; and a desire to do some&#8211; 
thing to become worthy of participating by his acts 
in the goodness and protection which the Lord has 
jjromised to his people. &#8212; You can in no manner 
whatever excite a greater love for religion&#59; and by 
degrees he will endeavour to copy your actions with&#8211; 
out your being obliged to demand it from him &#59; on 
the contrary&#44; he will think himself favoured if you

take him with you to the house of God&#44; if you per&#8211; 
mit him to go with you to the chambers of the sick&#44; 
to be near you at the interring of the dead&#44; and to 
have by your bounty the means to drop his trifle 
into the collection made for the poor. And if he 
sees you earnest in your conduct&#44; the thought of 
doubting will not arise within his mind &#59; and he will 
gradually become a willing&#44; understanding&#44; but not 
a blind&#44; follower of the Mosaic code. 

It evidently is therefore your duty not alone to 
show your child a holy example in your own persons&#44; 
but to keep those from an intimate footing in your 
house&#44; who speak slightingly of&#44; or in opposition to 
religion. If you Avish him to grow up entire with his 
God&#44; you should withdraw him from evil communi&#8211; 
cation &#59; for&#44; as we illustrated with superstition&#44; the 
mind gradually becomes tainted with the corruption 
of unbelief and lukcwarnmess&#44; if it is constantly or 
even occasionally exposed to the deleterious poison 
which flows from the mouth of the ungodly. Their 
agreeable manners and pleasant conversation are no 
excuse for j&#8211;our tolerating their intercourse&#59; and if 
such persons are from necessity admitted to your lire&#8211; 
side&#44; you must insist upon their keeping silent on 
disputed matters of religion&#44; &#8212; You may think it your 
duty to efl&#58;ect if possible their conversion &#59; but do not 
dispute before your child&#44; till he is old enough not to 
be aifected by the doubts of your antagonist&#59; for you 
cannot tell how an argument badly conducted by the 
defender of religion may operate injuriously upon the 
happiness of one&#44; who may appear an uninterested 
listener. We will leave out of the question that ar&#8211; 
guing with an unbeliever seldom carries conviction

with it &#59; since the haughty pride of the human heart 
not nnfrequently refuses to yield&#44; even if the argu&#8211; 
ments brought forward to sustain its positions are 
weak and untenable&#44; and it often resorts to abuse and 
ridicule if nothing more tangible is at hand. I say&#44; 
we will not take tliis danger into view&#44; where the 
child may see sacred truths treated with contempt or 
levity&#59; for even if this should not be&#44; and you should 
succeed in silencing the arguments of your opponent&#44; 
and he confess himself vanquished &#58; still the bane of 
inlidelity has been infused in your child&#39;s ear&#44; and the 
danger has been incurred of having thereby shaken 
the before tranquil acquiescence in religious truths. 
It is not that religion is weak&#44; or that its tenets are 
not defensible by the most cogent arguments&#59; but 
still it is unwise to do any thing to chill the ardour 
of youth by exhibiting in its presence exemplifica&#8211; 
tions of those wicked men&#44; whom it is much better 
to know in theory only. It is deplorable enough 
that in riper years our constancy should be exposed 
to the temptations of the world&#44; and to have our 
hopes attacked by the shallow arguments of a sen&#8211; 
sual philosophy&#44; which attracts us because it prom&#8211; 
ises a gratification of the passions undisturbed by the 
admonition of Scriptures&#59; and surely it is best to let 
the days of early youth pass in tranquillity&#44; and an 
entire acquiescence in paternal admonition&#44; and the 
pious instruction of our first teachers. There is no 
question&#44; but that much of irreligion is owing to an 
early unsettling of convictions by wicked associates&#44; 
and by hearing the commandments spoken of lightly&#59; 
for the Scriptures inveigh against evil companions 
for adults who possibly may be fortified by a long

course of reflection&#44; how much more then should such 
be deprecated when they may tend to corrupt the 
mind of children. And these are the words of the 
first Psalm&#58; &#34;Blessed is the man that walketh not 
in the counsel of the ungodly&#44; nor standeth in the 
way of sinners&#44; nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful &#59; 
but whose delight is in the law of the Lord&#44; and who 
doth meditate in his law day and night.&#34; Let it be 
therefore your endeavour to surround yourselves only 
with those who honour religion with words and ac&#8211; 
tions&#44; let those only be the inmates of your house 
from whom no bad examples are likely to operate on 
the mind of your child. &#8212; Li this exclusion of irrelig&#8211; 
ious persons there is no bigotry nor persecution &#59; for 
as the guardians of the peace of your household you 
are as much bound to ward off dangers to the mental 
welfare&#44; as j&#39;ou are sedulous to exclude the incendiary 
from destroying your domicil&#44; &#92;vhilst you are wrapt 
in unconscious sleep. And in this instance also&#44; no 
less than in every other&#44; prevention is far preferable 
to a cure&#59; and it is almost reduced to a certainty&#44; 
that the child&#44; if not vitiated by a corrupting influence&#44; 
will grow up gradually a true follower of religion. 

Such a selection of associates around your table 
becomes the more necessary from our present state 
of dispersion in small numbers all over the world. 
We live in the midst of communities whose S3&#8211;stem 
of belief is not only different&#44; but who reject totally&#44; 
I may say the whole of&#44; our ceremonial and religious 
observances&#44; if we except a substitute for the Sabbath. 
The consequence is that this corrupting influence&#44; I 
mean to say the different conduct of the majority&#44; is 
active beyond all calculation&#44; and it onlj&#39; requires the 

<pb n="297"/>

RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. 297 

addition of iufidel or careless Jews to sap completely 
the foniidatioii of faith in the individual&#44; unless he is 
strongly fortilied by a knowledge of our holy law and 
a uniform observance of its precepts. These require&#8211; 
ments cannot be looked for in children &#59; and hence it 
is evident&#44; that they should hear and see nothing said 
or done in their immediate presence which is counter 
to the doctrines of our religion. By this means it is 
to be hoped that the spirit of true piety may be kept 
alive in the minds of your offspring&#44; and they may 
live to transmit the same to succeedina&#58; ajjes&#44; in its 
untarnished excellence and undiminished lustre. 

As your child advances in years&#44; you should adapt 
the government to his increasing intellectual capacity&#59; 
and as soon as he is old enough for comprehending 
it&#44; you should enforce obedience by persuasion which 
should never degenerate into entreaty&#59; for the parents 
should never be petitioners&#44; if they mean to preserve 
the authority which nature has given them. Mild&#8211; 
ness coupled with earnest firmness should always be 
exhibited&#44; and no relaxation of discipline should be 
accorded upon any pretence whatever. It is also 
your duty to keep cool&#44; no matter what the offence 
of the child may be&#44; and to judge with calmness of 
the degree of guilt which he has incurred. Where 
moral remedies fail of producing reformation or en&#8211; 
forcing obedience&#44; physical means should be resorted 
to&#44; even to the use of the rod. Scriptures here give 
us a rule&#44; which we should not set aside for all the 
fancies of modern theorists. For so says Solomon 
&#40;Proverbs xiii. 24&#41; &#58; &#34; He that spareth the rod hateth 
his child &#59; but he that loveth him chasteneth him be&#8211; 
times.&#34; And herein too the blessed Creator sets us

an example&#59; for when admonitions fail of working a 
reformation in man&#44; punishment is sent to snatch the 
soul from the jaws of perdition. If therefore you 
truly love your child&#44; if your views reach farther than 
the day&#44; if you can bear to look upon his tears more 
than tolerate evil conduct &#58; chastise him for every 
great dereliction&#44; when you are convinced that mere 
words will fail of the desired effect. Crueltj&#8211;&#44; how&#8211; 
ever&#44; should not be indulged in&#44; nor should punish&#8211; 
ment be inflicted whilst you are angry&#44; nor before 
you have judged carefully of the degree of the wrong 
which you deem deserving of the rod. Reason with 
him&#44; tell him wherein he has failed&#44; prove to him 
why he deserves and obtains punishment&#58; and it is 
highly probable&#44; that one infliction of the rod will 
have a much happier effect in correcting error&#44; than 
a thousand barbarous beatings in the moments of 
anger&#44; where the child is but too apt to think himself 
ill&#8211;used&#44; and which proceeding may produce a moodi&#8211; 
ness and a sullen yielding to a command&#44; without the 
most remote thought of reformation. Consider that 
indulgence and undue severity are both calculated to 
produce a relaxation of discipline&#59; for if both the 
parents are tyrannical&#44; or if the father alone punishes 
with undue rigour&#44; the oflenccs committed in their 
absence will not be reported to them even by those 
who have cause to complain&#44; as they will prefer not 
noticing the injury to having the child cruelly beaten 
or otherwise cruelly punished&#59; and impunity thus 
obtained is eminently calculated to invite a repetition 
of the offence which a mild punishment might have 
guarded against. &#8212; Let it be a rule with you&#44; that 3&#8211;ou 
expect good conduct and obedience&#44; and insist upon

the members of your lioiisehold reporting to you any 
flagrant wrong done in your absence&#59; but let your 
own deportment be so&#44; tbat tliey see tbat you govern 
with moderate firmness&#44; and they will then have no 
cause for liiding the delinquency of your child from 
your knowledge. You will in this manner have a 
chance of having a constant watch over your child&#39;s 
conduct&#44; which is a great point gained&#59; and he will 
be afraid to ofi&#39;end&#44; for he can &#39;find no means of es&#8211; 
caping detection&#44; and knows that he will be punished 
if he transgresses. It is with children as with grown 
men &#58; it is not so much the degree as the certainty 
of punishment which deters them from transgressing&#59; 
and a judicious parent will let no opportunity pass to 
prove&#44; by a firmness that will not yield where punish&#8211; 
ment should be inflicted&#44; that he means to be obeyed. 
If a child now is kept under constant control&#44; with&#8211; 
out feeling often the means that make him so&#44; he 
will become habituated to obedience&#44; and a moral&#44; 
religious course of conduct&#59; he will learn to love vir&#8211; 
tue and holiness&#59; and as he grows up he wdll have 
these sentiments engrafted in his spirit&#44; and it is 
highly probable that&#44; strengthened by heavenly grace&#44; 
which is never denied to the pure in mind&#44; he will 
be kept upright in the way he should go. 

Another requisite to a proper training is&#44; that both 
parents should coincide in the government of the 
household. If the one deems it necessary to punish&#44; 
let the other not interfere&#44; especially in the presence 
of the child. It is a positive encouragement for mis&#8211; 
conduct&#44; if he sees that he is screened&#44; when he has 
transgressed&#59; he will learn to despise the authority of 
the one that indulges him&#44; and to hate the one that

punishes&#59; both thereby lose their authority&#59; and if in 
later years the father&#44; for instance&#44; should be gathered 
to his native earth&#44; the indulgent mother will have 
ample cause to repent that she was the means of teach&#8211; 
ing by her weakness lessons of insubordination and 
disobedience to a child&#44; who now laughs at her com&#8211; 
mands&#44; and treats with scorn the entreaties of his re&#8211; 
maining parent in her declining years. &#39;No&#44; parents&#33; 
be united&#44; support each other in doing your duty by 
your cbild &#59; if the father frowns&#44; let not the mother 
fondle &#59; if the mother punishes&#44; let not the father ex&#8211; 
tend protection. But be it your study to act in the 
fear of God&#44; and teach your child by your mutual at&#8211; 
tachment&#44; from which he sees no deviation&#44; to love 
you equally&#44; to fear you equally&#59; that he may be&#39; 
stimulated to honour you both alike as the law re&#8211; 
quires&#59; and that&#44; growing up in obedience to the re&#8211; 
ligion of our fathers&#44; he may indeed merit the bless&#8211; 
ing of a long life on he earth&#44; to your satisfaction and 
the well&#8211;being of all nis associates&#44; and become a child 
of immortal glory through a love of God and the fear 
of his word&#44; &#92; hich are the beginning of all wisdom. 
May the &#39; ame of the Lord be blessed from now 
and unto ah eternity. Amen.

O God of everlasting&#33; we approach Thee to crave 
thy blessing and the grant of thy protection from the 
many evils to which we are exposed. Give us forti&#8211; 
tude to submit to thy visitation&#44; and strengthen us 
with thy undeserved grace&#44; that we may remain firm 
in obedience&#44; when the allurements of sin would 
withdraw us from the path of life. And as Thou 
ever hearest the prayer of the humble and penitent &#58; 
permit our words to come before Thee&#44; and despise 
not the outpourings of the heart of the outcasts of Is&#8211; 
rael in the regions distant from their heritage where 
Thou dost cause tbem to dwell. But do Thou ac&#8211; 
cording to their request&#44; and give them an under&#8211; 
standing mind to comprehend the words of thy law&#44; 
and remove all obstacles which may oppose their 
obeying in truth the precepts which Thou hast or&#8211; 
dained. And &#33; give firmness to those of thy children 
who are assailed by flattery&#44; and the corrupting influ&#8211; 
ence of their enemies&#44; to resist the direful temptations&#44; 
and to remain steadfast in the pursuance of thy holy 
will &#58; so that the machinations of those who wish to 
blot out Israel&#39;s name from among the nations may 
be turned to naught&#44; and they be covered with shame 
and confusion&#44; even as was Senacherib&#44; who dared 
to blaspheme thy holy name&#44; and as were the Philis&#8211;

tines&#44; who relied upon the strength of their champion 
against the armies of the living God. &#8212; May this be 
thy will. Amen &#33; 

Brethren &#33; 

It is a solemn duty enjoined on you in the Scrip&#8211; 
tures to use every eftbrt within your reach to render 
your children fit servants of the Lord of heaven and 
earth&#44; and to imbue their minds with such sentiments 
as will make them love their duties&#44; and enable them 
to have a proper firmness to resist doing wrong when&#8211; 
ever temptation and opportunity may present them&#8211; 
selves. For as your children advance in life&#44; and are 
gradually withdrawn from your care and observation&#44; 
they will be exposed to influences which will greatly 
tend to remove entirely all your early lessons&#44; unless 
you have implanted in them the root of all the princi&#8211; 
ples according to which you act yourselves&#44; and de&#8211; 
sire them to act. Your duty therefore is not com&#8211; 
pleted&#44; if you merely tell your children once what you 
expect of them to do&#44; and you ought not to be satis&#8211; 
fied&#44; if they are well&#8211;behaved and decorous in your 
presence&#59; but you should furnish them with such 
sentiments as will stand by them instead of parental 
superintendence and care&#44; which should act as a check 
upon them&#44; when they are alone or far removed from 
those wliom they have to fear or whom they love. 
Mere morality will not eflect this&#44; by which I mean&#44; 
that lessons of virtue stripped of the consideration of 
duty to a higher Being&#44; and merely based upon ideas 
of expediency and prudential considerations&#44; may en&#8211; 
gender a cautious&#44; kind&#44; and apparently benevolent 
character&#44; but will not confer that degree of firmness&#44;

wliicli could induce us to resist the impulse for wrong 
of which we have been speaking. For what is 3&#39;our 
system of morality&#44; so called&#44; based on &#63; We answer&#44; 
Expediency only&#33; Now it is all well whilst correct 
conduct and this selfish principle point out the same 
road&#44; for then the mere moralist will without doubt 
do what all must acknowledge to be right&#44; but let 
the case be different&#59; let us imagine a situation where 
we are drawn to an attractive transgression by a 
strong appeal to our senses&#44; where those we fear are 
far away&#44; where those whom we would on no account 
grieve by our actions are not likely to become cog&#8211; 
nizant of our sinning&#58; and then tell me&#44; where our 
constancy&#44; our resistance would be&#63; Where is the 
sentiment to restrain us&#63; Tell me not of the dignity 
of human nature&#44; of the sublime attributes of the hu&#8211; 
man soul&#59; for the man of the world who has no other 
check than morality&#44; will have ample means&#44; because 
he has a wide range of permitted actions&#44; to hide from 
others any thing which they might call unworthy and 
undignified&#44; at least he will endeavour to preserve the 
gilded exterior&#44; till his real sentiments and character 
are at lengtli accidentally laid bare. Moreover the 
sublime attributes of our scrul&#44; such as social love&#44; the 
feeling of honour and of benevolence&#44; are only too 
well calculated to lull the spirit into security when&#8211; 
ever self is brought into competition with the rights 
of others&#59; for then we are apt to disregard the love 
for our fellow&#44; because we may thereby be exposed 
to injury or inconvenience&#59; feelings of honour may 
prompt us to revenge&#44; because we may think our 
honour wounded or our dignity outraged. And 
lastly&#44; the so&#8211;called sentiment of benevolence may by

some strange fatuity&#44; for instance&#44; that true charity 
begins at home&#44; move us to protect ourselves before 
we take a view of the wants of others&#44; aUhougli if we 
were to reflect with candour Ave would lind that we 
have enough for others as well as for ourselves. We 
therefore say&#44; that morality&#44; in itself&#44; is not the guide 
which we ought to place before and recommend to 
our children in their commencement of life&#44; and point 
it out as the check which is to assist them in the re&#8211; 
straining of the desires and passions. 

&#34; What guide&#44; then&#44; would you recommend&#63;&#34; iSTeed 
I tell you&#44; beloved brethren&#44; the name of this blessed 
principle&#63; know you it not without the words of a 
public teacher&#63; Surely the lieart of Israelites recog&#8211; 
nizes full well the heavenly gift which has sustained 
them when their spirit Avas drooping&#44; when their foot 
was weary amid the many pilgrimages which they 
had to encounter&#44; since the iirst hour they heard the 
voice of the Everlasting Father speaking to them 
from the midst of the fire&#44; on that day when the unity 
of the Lord and his will were made known from the 
thick clouds of glory that enveloped the summit of 
the chosen mountain of Sinai &#33; &#8212; The terrific fire of 
the promulgation of the Decalogue did not blaze 
long&#59; the Avonderful sounds soon died away in the 
deep stillness which followed &#59; the pageant of millions 
assembled in attentive silence was speedily dissolved&#58; 
and yet the words then announced have stood as the 
bulwark of our people against foreign tyranny and 
domestic disunion&#44; against outward opyression and 
the defection of the faithless in our own household&#59; 
and we have remained as a body faithful to our trust&#44; 
though our Father&#39;s warnings are no longer audibly

announced as in days of yore through the month of 
his servants. This then&#44; brethren&#44; is the principle 
which you should recommend to your children &#59; this 
is the guide you should set before them.&#8212; If now you 
have the happiness to succeed in rearing them up 
faithful followers of this law&#59; if you witness in them 
an adoption of the duties it enjoins&#44; and of the doc&#8211; 
trines on which it is founded&#58; you need not tremble 
for their future welfare&#44; for it is then founded upon 
a basis which will probably remain unshaken during 
their whole lives. For where the law of God purifies 
the thoughts&#44; where its statutes direct the hand in 
man&#39;s work&#44; can we entertain a doubt that a common 
benefit will result from a mind so trained&#44; from ac&#8211; 
tions so prompted&#63; We say &#34;a common benefit&#59;&#34; 
for it is not here as with the expediency of the mere 
moralist&#44; where the agent looks to his own interest&#44; 
provided it comes not in direct conflict with that of 
others&#59; since the Israelite&#44; who deserves the name&#44; 
will forego his own interest in every point where the 
law asks it of him &#59; he will assist his enemy&#44;&#42; though 
he have no hope of conciliating him &#59; he will restrain 
revenge&#44;&#8224; though the ofi&#58;ender be in his power&#59; and 
he will assist&#8225; with his wealth and his services the 
needy and indigent&#44; though the release&#8211;year be near 
at hand&#44; and he can thus have no farther claim upon 
their repaying him the amount of their indebtedness. 
But it is not the effect of the law upon others we wish 
now to discuss&#44; although it is a fruitful theme which 
might well inspire the most eloquent with noble 
thoughts&#44; and afford him a fine field to descant upon 

&#42; Exodus xxiii. 4&#44; 5.  	&#8224; Leviticus xix. 18. &#8225; Deut. xv. 9.

the mercy of the Most High in so watching over tlie 
welfare of his creatures as to bestow it on them for 
their social guidance&#59; we will to&#8211;day regard it only 
in its workings upon the individuals themselves sub&#8211; 
ject to its rule&#44; and trace the progress by which it 
renders them the children of salvation under the law. 
For our text we will take the following passage &#58; 

&#34; Therefore&#44; shall ye lay up these my words in your heart&#44; and 
in your soul &#59; and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand&#44; 
and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. And ye shall 
teach them to your children&#44; to speak of them when thou sittest in 
thy house&#44; and when thou walkest by the way&#44; when thou liest 
down&#44; and when thou risest up. And thou shalt write them upon 
the door&#8211;posts of thy house&#44; and upon thy gates.&#34; Deut. xi. 18&#8211;20. 

The Scriptures&#44; you will observe&#44; connect personal 
piety with the education of children &#59; or in other 
words&#44; they demand of the parents example no less 
than precept. In the verses preceding our text is con&#8211; 
tained a denunciation of punishment for disobedience 
and defection &#59; and as the reverse&#44; or the means to 
avoid punishment&#44; you are told&#44; &#34; Therefore shall ye 
lay up these my words in your heart&#44; and in your 
soul.&#34; To avoid sinning and its necessary visitation 
you should be perfectly alive to i&#8211;eligious obligation&#44; 
your body &#40;the heart&#41; and your spirit &#40;the soul&#41; should

equally be devoted to the service of the Most High &#59; 
and every feeling which prompts you to satisfy the 
cravings of nature&#44; every thought which dwells upon 
the vastness of the Creator&#39;s works&#44; which reflects 
upon your own being and your destiny in the light of 
Israelites and of men&#44; should all be alike in conso&#8211; 
nance with his wishes and his behests as contained in 
his revealed word Avhicli He made known to our 
lathers. The heads of the household should exhibit 
no levity in speaking of the commandments&#44; no dis&#8211; 
regard to the observance of the divine ordinances&#44; no 
doubting of the truths and doctrines of the Bible&#59; 
and in doing any act&#44; they should be careful&#44; that it 
be entirely in accordance with the letter and spirit of 
the law. The house should be surrounded with evi&#8211; 
dences of the inmates being Israelites&#59; every thing 
should be regulated according to the principles of 
your ancestors&#59; the food&#44; the drink&#44; the manner of 
speaking should all be diflerent from gentile custom&#44; 
and no hesitation should be shown&#44; because such con&#8211; 
duct would render you objects of curiosity and in&#8211; 
quiry to those who are strangers to our people. &#34; Lay 
these my words upon your heart&#44;&#34; you are told&#59; it is 
no matter what others think of you&#44; you must not be 
afraid of the surprise which might be expressed in 
discovering you in your own peculiar Israelitish rites. 
But&#44; &#34;Ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand&#44;&#34; 
&#8212; bind the memorial of the law literally on your 
hand&#59; place it there at least during your morning 
worship&#44; to remind you of your obligation to the 
Lord for his manifold blessings&#44; in calling your early 
fathers to his service&#44; in redeeming you from Egyp&#8211; 
tian bondage&#44; in giving you his laws&#44; and in preserv&#8211;

ing you to stand before Ilim despite of the thousands 
of calamities which have befallen you. Place it on 
your forehead&#44; ornament yourselves with the crown 
of the law&#44; to confess that you subject your feelings 
and your thoughts to divine rule&#44; and to acknowledge 
that the Lord&#39;s are the power and the government 
to do in all the worlds according to his almighty 
will &#59; and by this means you will obtain firmness and 
strength to be bold and unflinching when temptation 
would lure you away to follow other gods and bow 
down to them. And not only for the days of Moses 
was this said&#44; when gross idolatry was the prevailing 
sin of all the world&#44; but also for the present hour &#59; 
for if we do not actually worship stocks and stones&#44; 
and bow down to a god who cannot save&#44; we never&#8211; 
theless have within us unhallowed passions and un&#8211; 
clean desires&#44; and we worship the love for gold&#44; the 
inclination for unlawful pleasures&#44; the demon of am&#8211; 
bition&#44; and the lust for places incompatible with reli&#8211; 
gion&#44; which are all equally unable to raise the soul 
above the mortality of this life into the presence of 
our Maker&#44; and are all alike false idols to which our 
everlasting happiness is so often sacrificed. The in&#8211; 
stitutions therefore which were wise in the days of 
Moses&#44; which were then calculated to rivet closer the 
bonds of the law and the love of God&#44; are so yet at 
this very day&#59; practise them therefore before your 
children&#44; and show them how they arc to obey the 
the commands which you lay before them. If you 
do this in all truth and in entire simpleness of faith&#44; 
you can then proceed to the next duty&#44; &#34; And you 
shall teach them to your children.&#34; It is not enough 
that you tell them where they may find the word of 

<pb n="309"/>

RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. 309 

God&#44; and it is not doing your duty&#44; to let them put 
upon it their own interpretation &#59; but you yourselves&#44; 
fathers and mothers&#44; should instruct them in tlie words 
of life and interpret the text for them in the manner 
it is accepted among Israel. Two duties proceed out 
of this consideration &#58; First&#44; it is the business of pa&#8211; 
rents to make themselves thoroughly acquainted with 
at least the five books of Moses&#44; the law proper&#44; and 
omit no occasion to teach the duties thereof to their 
children &#59; not that their studies should be confined to 
this part of the Bible only&#44; but that the poorest per&#8211; 
sons&#44; or those who have to toil daily for their bread&#44; 
should endeavour to become at all events familiar 
with this&#44; that they might have it in their power to 
become proper instructors of their offspring&#59; although 
we can hardly imagine a family so constantly occu&#8211; 
pied&#44; that they could not read with care the whole rec&#8211; 
ord of revelation&#44; and occasionally those good works 
which have been written by pious Israelites&#44; in order 
to become themselves more firm in faith&#44; and to ren&#8211; 
der the instruction more agreeable and varied to their 
juniors&#44; &#8212; secondly&#44; they are bound to search for pious 
and intelligent teachers&#44; to whom alone they should 
intrust the education of their children. For it is not 
to be denied&#44; that it is a bad system to send sons and 
daughters of Israel at an early age to schools where 
either no religion at all&#44; or one of an opposite charac&#8211; 
ter to our own&#44; is taught. In the first case the love 
of revelation is not encouraged &#59; in the other&#44; feelings 
are called into action and a species of conviction of 
non&#8211;admitted and inadmissible doctrines is produced&#44; 
which will materially affect the due observance of our 
religious rites. It were indeed advisable&#44; that chil&#8211; 

<pb n="310"/>

310 RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. 

di&#8211;en shouM know very little&#44; at all events not more 
than is unavoidable&#44; of the existence of a difference 
of religion&#59; since by this method a dccpseated adher&#8211; 
ence to the early lessons of piety is impressed on the 
mind&#44; before the doubts which are consequent upon a 
view of the multifarious shades of belief are elicited&#58; 
and parents thus give such a strength to the princi&#8211; 
ples which they practise in their tamilies&#44; that the 
ready imitation of the same by the children is more 
easily attained. &#8212; It will not do to assert&#44; thai in gen&#8211; 
eral schools children are taught nothing bad&#59; for&#44; 
brethren &#33; you are not to be content with a mere neg&#8211; 
ative education&#59; there is nothing negative in virtue&#44; 
all at length depends upon the performance of certain 
acts&#44; whether they be ceremonial or social duties&#44; 
without which civil security itself cannot be obtained &#59; 
for this too requires action for its firm establishment. 
We say therefore that religious tuition should be a 
part of the daily exercises in school &#59; Bible reading 
and Bible explanations are a necessary branch of a 
Jewish education &#58; and hence&#44; where practicable&#44; Jew&#8211; 
ish teachers&#44; if not alone&#44; at all events jointly&#44; ought to 
have the superintendence of our youths. 

Some may perhaps suppose that much time must be 
lost to the acquisition of sciences and general knowl&#8211; 
ecVicvby so much care being bestowed upon religion&#44; 
which they justly say rests but upon a few easily un&#8211; 
derstood principles. But there is a great error in 
both these assertions. First&#44; it is not true&#44; that the 
time bestowed on the Bible and its elucidation is lost 
or misspent. AVe will admit for argument&#39;s sake&#44; 
that by this study the hours to be devoted to gram&#8211; 
mar&#44; history and other sciences should have to be di&#8211; 

<pb n="311"/>

RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. 311 

minisbed &#58; still can this not be called a loss. For let 
us ask&#44; What do you want to teacb by sciences &#63; cer&#8211; 
tainly nothing more&#44; than to give to tlie young cor&#8211; 
rect views of life&#44; and enable them to judge with pro&#8211; 
priety of things to be bereafter presented to them. 
So is grammar&#44; to enable them to speak and write 
witb propriety &#59; history&#44; to intbrm thera of tbe acts 
of past ages&#44; and to give them examples of good men 
to be imitated&#44; and wicked ones whose deeds sbould 
be abhorred&#59; and so with other tilings. Now we de&#8211; 
mand. Is religious knowledge not something wbieh is 
to become useful to cbildren hereafter &#63; is it not cal&#8211; 
culated to enable tbem to judge witb propriety of 
many subjects of the highest importance&#63; If you 
then call sciences the ornament of life&#44; religion sarclj&#39;&#8211; 
is far more&#44; it is the essential element of our exist&#8211; 
ence &#59; and hence it is a science above all to be ac&#8211; 
quired with diligent study. But it is not true&#44; that 
the time devoted to such information is lost to the 
elegant branches. So many collateral matters become 
necessarily mixed up with a study of Scripture&#44; that 
an intelligent teacher will lind it an excellent vehicle 
.to communicate all the necessary information whilst 
engaged in this alone &#59; especially if we go according 
to the good old custom&#44; and teach the Hebrew at once&#44; 
and read the Bible from the original only&#44; and em&#8211; 
ploy all the aids which modern learning has brought 
to bear upon the sacred volume. This will at once 
require and employ tbe study of grammar&#44; both of 
the language of Israel and the vernacular of the coun&#8211; 
ti&#8211;y &#59; a geographical survey of the difterent regions 
mentioned in the Bible &#59; comparative history of the 
tribes and nations occurring in the narrative&#59; besides

such other matters &#40;for instance&#44; the natural liistory of 
the animals&#44; plants&#44; and niinei&#8211;als&#44; whose names occur 
in the law and prophets&#44; and a survey of the manu&#8211; 
factures and manners of the ancients&#41; which will sug&#8211; 
gest themselves to an enlightened inquirer in religion. 
In truth&#44; the Bible is a magnificent study for itself&#59; 
which is evidenced by the many learned and excel&#8211; 
lent works written to illustrate&#44; and the many great 
minds who have devoted themselves solely to explain 
its text&#44; and to clear up the obscurities which have 
at times presented themselves&#44; because we are not 
sufiiciently familiar with the imagery it exhibits and 
the customs and characters it portrays. We may as&#8211; 
sert without fear of contradiction&#44; that there are not 
many men&#44; if there be indeed one&#44; with sufiicient in&#8211; 
formation to explain correctly the books of Scripture&#44; 
so rich&#44; and magnificent&#44; and inexhaustible are their 
stores. &#8212; Besides this&#44; no study need be neglected on 
account of religious instruction &#59; there is ample time&#44; 
if properly economized&#44; for children to become ac&#8211; 
quainted with every thing for which they have capac&#8211; 
ity&#44; and which can be useful to them. It is a great 
folly to suppose that it is advantageous for a child to 
be an early genius&#44; and to display rare excellence 
above others of the same age&#59; for in this way indo&#8211; 
lence and a degree of self&#8211;sufficiency are very apt to be 
produced&#44; wdiich are injurious alike to an advancement 
in knowledge and an amiable deportment. If there&#8211; 
fore religious education should retard the progress in 
other matters a year or two &#40;if we take dift&#39;erent chil&#8211; 
dren of ecpial capacity educated in diti&#39;erent systems&#44; 
that is to say&#44; one with the other without religion as a 
criterion&#41;&#58; still nothing would be lost thereby in the

end &#59; for what the one would gain by a greater leisure 
for profane subjects&#44; the other would far more than 
equal by a greater degree of solidity and an enlarged 
capacity for deeper studies. But even this danger of a 
delay in advancement is in all probability overrated&#59; 
for different branches&#44; provided they are not too nu&#8211; 
merous and difficult&#44; rather assist each other&#44; and are 
a sort of relief for the student&#59; and I can see no 
reason why religion viewed as a study should differ 
from any other&#44; since it is no doubt true&#44; tliat to the 
young the subject presents itself by no means in the 
unattractive light it often does to adults&#44; because it 
demands of these to restrain passions and desires 
which the former have never yet felt. 

With regard to the objection we supposed as made 
against the necessity of teaching religion&#44; because it 
rests upon a few easily understood principles&#58; we will 
state&#44; that the Jewish faith is in truth founded upon 
the great self&#8211;evident principle of the existence of 
God&#44; secondly upon the existence of a revelation 
from God&#44; and thirdly upon the existence of rewards 
and punishments&#44; inasmuch as the other doctrines 
which we profess are derived from one or the other 
of these cardinal points. Nevertheless&#44; we maintain 
that it is of the highest importance that children 
should learn these principles from believing persons&#44; 
and that great care should be taken that no false or 
inaccurate doctrines should be added to or substituted 
for them. We all know&#44; or ought to know&#44; that our 
mind is so constituted that it will imbibe every thing 
presented to it&#44; especially in youth&#59; and the grossest 
errors&#44; as now viewed&#44; have been at one time or an&#8211; 
other the prevailing sentiments of mankind. Even

in onr own day&#44; are we not constantly startled by the 
profession of creeds which we Israelites cannot in 
any way acknowledge&#63; And their existence&#44; as gen&#8211; 
erally admitted truths&#44; can only be accounted for on 
the ground that early education has rendered them 
acceptable to those holding them &#59; for we have no 
right to doubt upon vague surmises the sincerity of 
any of our fellow&#8211;beings&#44; and we must therefore sup&#8211; 
pose that persons holding doctrines&#44; say the opposite 
of ours&#44; may be perfectly sincere in believing them&#44; 
no less than we ourselves are in maintaining our own 
pure faith. It is&#44; as we have said&#44; the constant hear&#8211; 
ing of such matters in youth&#44; and having nothing of&#8211; 
fered that runs contrary to them&#44; which render them 
80 convincing to their professors&#44; that they acquiesce 
in them as though tliey were well&#8211;ascertained truths. 
If now Jewish children are exposed to the same in&#8211; 
fluence with those of our gentile neighbours&#44; I ask&#44; 
What can you expect&#44; but that they too should be&#8211; 
come tainted Avith the leaven of erroneous belief&#44; 
and be made converts to one or more doctrines which 
we cannot admit as true&#63; Say you&#44; that it matters 
not what young children think of controverted the&#8211; 
ology&#44; and that&#44; when they grow up&#44; it is time enough 
to teach them our doctrines &#63; But this is again a 
fatal error. We know from experience how dillicult 
it is to convince a gentile of the erroneousness of his 
belief&#44; whilst we cannot comprehend how it is possi&#8211; 
ble for him to hesitate yielding himself to the convic&#8211; 
tion which the Scriptures oft&#39;er. Hence arises our 
hesitation in admitting persons not born Israelites to 
our communion &#59; because we must have strong suspi&#8211; 
cion of their having that conviction which is necessary 

<pb n="315"/>

for the adoption of our religion&#44; till we have no longer 
any motive to doubt their professed sincerity. &#8212; If now 
you leave a Jewish cljild to the same influence which 
warps the gentile&#39;s mind&#44; you in fact teach him gen&#8211; 
tile doctrines&#59; and you will be&#44; and deserve to be&#44; 
sorely grieved if with advancing years you find it dif&#8211; 
ficult to make him adopt the doctrines which you 
yourselves profess. His mind has been rendered un&#8211; 
jewish&#59; he has to unlearn what he may have con&#8211; 
sidered true hitherto&#59; and one of two things can oc&#8211; 
cur&#44; he either may adhere to his early&#8211;imbibed no&#8211; 
tions&#44; or become an infidel&#44; rejecting what he once 
learnt&#44; and what you now wish to teach him. If you 
can even succeed in convincing him of our holy law&#44; 
and induce him to adopt it as true&#58; still there may 
remain lurking some ideas which are not orthodox&#44; 
and which nuiy impart a shadow and colouring to his 
religious conduct&#44; which cannot be defended upon 
pure biblical grounds. &#8212; Believe me one thing&#44; simple 
as is our religion in its foundation&#44; it must be early 
infused&#44; that is the precise word&#44; into the mind to 
become united with&#44; and inseparable from the soul. 
There should be no necessity for converting our own children &#44;
they ought to be Jews in every stage of their being. 
As soon therefore as they begin to learn&#44; the unity of 
God should be held up to their adoption&#44; not so much 
by argument to prove its being so&#44; as by simple in&#8211; 
formation. The proofs of the existence of the Deity 
are so universal&#44; that you can easily lead the youngest 
even to comprehend that every thing was made by a 
superior Power&#59; and the uniformity of dcbign in 
every creature will elucidate the universality of this 
Power&#59; and the harmony in the whole chain of ex&#8211;

istence&#44; the regularity of the movements of all the 
beings which we can observe&#44; and the use one thing 
is to another prove that this superior&#44; universal Power 
is also ONE and uniform. Yet even this simple doc&#8211; 
trine will require a length of time to become per&#8211; 
fectly familiar&#44; readily as it impresses itself with im&#8211; 
movable conviction upon the minds of educated Is&#8211; 
raelites. &#8212; Let us next view the second cardinal article 
of our creed&#58; &#34;There is a revelation from this supe&#8211; 
lior&#44; universal&#44; one and uniform Power.&#34; Again let 
this be taught without much argument&#44; which&#44; let me 
remark&#44; will naturally have but little weight with 
children &#59; for they will sooner take your simple asser&#8211; 
tion&#44; when they once have conlidence in you&#44; than 
listen to reasoning which is perhaps beyond their 
comprehension. So then tell them&#44; that the Lord 
God&#44; or the One as we called Him&#44; made himself 
audibly manifest to our ancestors and other great 
men of former times&#44; and communicated to them the 
duties they should observe&#44; and those acts which they 
should carefully avoid. And as therefore we thus 
know what is right&#44; which is also our duty to do&#44; and 
what is wrong&#44; which is what we should avoid &#58; we 
will be held responsible for our actions&#44; which we do 
when we are not under restraint or impelled by una&#8211; 
voidable necessity. This at once will open up for 
you an opportunity to descant on reward and punish&#8211; 
ment&#59; and you can tell your charges&#44; how the Lord 
made man a compound of soul and body&#44; and that&#44; 
though the latter is destroyed by death&#44; the former 
will yet survive&#44; and receive then such reward for 
past conduct&#44; as He&#44; the Lord&#44; may deem just and 
proper. &#8212; We concede that these principles follow so

clearly from each other &#44; a reasoning person will 
readily admit them as true &#59; but again we say&#44; &#44;it 
takes time to impress them sufficiently upon the un&#8211; 
derstanding of the young&#59; and once telling them&#44; 
will not suffice to prevent the growth of error from 
other causes. Besides this&#44; as soon as you teach the 
child that there is a revelation&#44; it is natural that he 
should ask to be informed&#44; what this revelation is&#58; 
will you then dismiss him with a mere reference to 
the Bible&#44; and tell him to &#34; Go and read &#63;&#34; Suppose 
you were to pursue such a system with the study of 
grammar&#44; do you really think that any progress would 
be made in it&#63; And yet you assert&#44; that religion of 
all sciences requires no teaching&#44; and that it is time 
misspent to inculcate it&#33; &#8212; ISTo&#44; brethren I our holy 
faith is simple and pure&#59; but it demands actions as 
well as belief&#44; and these actions are a proper study 
for youths&#44; and the Bible is a book which merits and 
should receive a thorouirh readino&#59; and a sound inter&#8211; 
pretation in all our schools. It is the word of salva&#8211; 
tion&#44; it is the word of truth&#44; it is the will of the God 
of truth&#44; who desires thereby to render us fit for ever&#8211; 
lasting happiness. And&#44; therefore&#44; we demand&#44; that it 
be the first study both as to time and duration&#44; which 
you should present to your children&#44; that they maj&#39; 
become early familiar with its principles and their 
duties&#44; and have a long season to apply these to life&#44; 
and regulate it by the doctrines which you offer for 
their acceptance. In the same manner you are bound 
to prevent their becoming familiar with the doctrines 
which we call erroneous&#44; and against which the Scrip&#8211; 
tures warn us as injurious and calculated to make us 
forget our religious duties. Hence it arises&#44; that it is 

27&#42;

exeeodlngly sinful to send children entirely among 
gentiles&#44; to eat and drink with them&#44; and to become 
thoroughly imbued with their doctrines&#59; since this 
course is certainly the most injurious to forming a 
Jewish character. And as parents have not always 
the leisure or information to become their spiritual 
guides&#44; it evidently becomes the duty of all true Is&#8211; 
raelites to send their children to Jewish teachers&#44; who 
have the fear of God before their eyes&#44; and who exe&#8211; 
cute the sacred trust of rearing the young in the way 
they should go&#44; in a manner best calculated to efiect 
this most desirable object. These should be aided by 
the parents in maintaining a wholesome&#44; though mild 
discipline over the childi&#8211;en&#44; and they should omit 
no opportunity to make religion better understood&#44; 
more loved&#44; and more sincerely followed&#44; than unfor&#8211; 
tunately it has been in many places in our own days. 
Believe me one thing&#44; brethren &#33; that the falling 
oft&#39;&#44; which we all have to deplore in religious observ&#8211; 
ances&#44; is the offspring of ignorance and want of edu&#8211; 
cation. In former years there prevailed an error of 
teaching abstruse points of legal knowledge&#44; to the 
exclusion&#44; to a great extent&#44; of pure scriptural knowl&#8211; 
edge. Sciences were then inaccessible to our op&#8211; 
pressed people&#44; and lience many wasted their power&#8211; 
ful intellect&#44; which being repressed was nevertheless 
not extinguished&#44; in detecting points of diftereuce and 
matters of disputation in the law&#44; which now have 
but little value in the changed aspect of things which 
of late years has taken place. Nevertheless there was 
then a great devotion to religion&#44; and the strictest 
observance of even the minutest things was the 
crowning glory of those days. But when the access 

<pb n="319"/>

RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. 319 

to sciences was opened to us&#44; a new spirit was sud&#8211; 
denly called into action. Scripture was more sought 
after&#44; and the ancient disputations and comments 
Avere greatly neglected&#44; much more so indeed than 
they should have been &#59; for with all their faults they 
contain matters of profound wisdom and deep reflec&#8211; 
tion. &#8212; Yet even this modified study of our religion 
has not in many places maintained its ground&#44; and 
has there&#44; alas &#33; receded to a point of perfect inatten&#8211; 
tion to so holy a pursuit. In several towns there is 
not even a single school where the Scriptures are ex&#8211; 
pounded and the holy language of our ancestors is 
taught&#59; so that some&#44; judging from appearance and 
a fancied necessity&#44; have thought it expedient to ad&#8211; 
vise to banish the latter as useless from our form of 
worship. And now we see the eflfects of this dete&#8211; 
rioration&#44; in the ignorance&#44; unpardonable ignorance&#44; 
of many in the essential points of their religion &#59; in 
their unacqviaintance with the Hebrew tongue&#59; in 
their omission of the observance demanded of them&#44; 
and in the neglect&#44; I almost might say exclusion from 
their society&#44; of the teachers of our blessed faith. It 
is true that there are but few places where there is 
not a minister appointed to do the necessary offices 
of religion&#44; and what is more&#44; public worship is gen&#8211; 
erally well supported&#44; if even the number of attendants 
is not very large &#59; but I speak of a class of teachers 
of religion&#44; not merely public servants&#44; who should 
have the formation of the mind of our children spe&#8211; 
cially delegated to them&#44; and give instruction in the 
doctrines and principles of the law which has descend&#8211; 
ed to us from our alicestors. And it is such as these 
who are not cared for&#44; nor wanted &#33; whilst parents

themselves are too busy to be themselves the teachers 
of their children &#33; It is a crying evil&#44; a sin of no 
small ma2&#58;nitLKle. &#8212; A man would be stigmatized as 
illiberal and uncnligiitened who would refuse sending 
his child to any school&#44; and merely give him an occa&#8211; 
sional lesson at home in the rudiments of reading and 
writing&#59; and in truth he would be guilty of a great 
wrong&#44; by leaving him behind in the march of improve&#8211; 
ment. And so well is this subject generally admitted&#44; 
that but few indeed can be found who give not some 
schooling to their children&#44; and many spend large 
and liberal sums to teach them whatever is ornamen&#8211; 
tal and useful&#44; and not unfrequently give extravagant 
prices for mere useless accomplishments&#44; that they 
may not be a whit behind the spirit of the age. And 
3&#39;et these very parents find it impossible to pay for 
the religious education of their children&#44; as though 
every thing should be taught but the word of the 
Lord &#33; Is it then surprising that we are retrograding 
in religious knowledge&#63; that the gentiles who former&#8211; 
ly could only learn from us are generally better ac&#8211; 
quainted with Scriptures than we are&#63; They&#44; we 
will state it to their credit&#44; are respectful to their 
public teachers&#44; they endeavour to seek for informa&#8211; 
tion in various ways from them&#44; and listen to their 
reproof with becoming deference. Tliis was formerly 
the case with us&#44; when the schools of our teachers 
were filled with listeners&#44; when they might reprove 
and admonish&#44; and the community would obey their 
instruction. Perhaps you may say&#44; that in those times 
there was too much power in the hands of these men &#58; 
admitted&#59; but what can you say in defence of a state 
of tilings where the opposite fault is so prevalent&#44; as

not to admit of any concealment from the eyes of our 
opponents&#63; Let us be candid &#58; the evil lias reached 
an alarming height&#44; and it is high time that a remedy 
were applied. As it is however now among us&#44; the 
difficulties in the way of a thorough change are truly 
great and appalling&#59; for whilst there are not more 
union and harmony to effect a general good&#44; and 
whilst the uninformed obtrude their ideas of reforma&#8211; 
tion&#44; or whilst the unworthy and irreligious assume 
the place of teachers&#44; nothing can be done. But the 
change must commence with the individual members 
of Israel themselves. They must learn&#44; in the Jirst 
place&#44; to disregard the opinions of those who differ 
from us in their rule of faith &#59; secondly&#44; they should 
admit no one to teach who is not qualified by educa&#8211; 
tion and a thorough raoral and religious conduct for 
the task he assumes &#59; &#40;hml&#39;i&#47;&#44; whenever a teacher is 
appointed he should receive the countenance of all 
the community where he lives&#44; and whilst he is in 
the discharge of the duties for which he has been ap&#8211; 
pointed&#44; let him not be unduly interfered with or 
checked by the temporal rulers of the Synagogue &#59; 
fourthly&#44; let no one attempt to imitate the example of 
the vain&#8211;glorious who speak of reforming our worship&#44; 
or&#44; in other words&#44; of forcing their own crude notions 
upon us instead of those opinions we have always 
cherished&#59; and lastly&#44; if no competent teachers can 
be obtained at the present moment&#44; let such induce&#8211; 
ments be held out that youths&#44; whom the Lord has 
endowed with wisdom&#44; will seek to qualify themselves 
for teachers in our academies&#44; and to become lectu&#8211; 
rers and preachers of the Word in our Synagogues. 
But it need not be expected that success can attend

the production of sound capable teachers&#44; whilst we 
are ruled&#44; as in many countries&#44; by the direct interfer&#8211; 
ence of the gentiles&#44; or&#44; as in others&#44; by our yielding 
constantly to what is termed public opinion in witii&#8211; 
liolding our children from proper Jewish schools&#59; 
wliilst incompetent or unworthy persons are elevated 
to the same responsible rank of instructors&#59; whilst 
our teachers&#44; when appointed&#44; receive not the counte&#8211; 
nance&#44; respect&#44; and support of the community&#44; and 
whilst their energies are cramped by the interference 
of the ignorant and ungodly&#44; who decry their honest 
efforts&#44; and strive to bring confusion in our midst by 
the introduction of pretended reforms. &#8212; The plan 
just hinted at may not be attainable in a few years&#59; 
there are doubtless some difficulties in the way&#59; but 
still impracticable it is not. We have gone astray 
from our former devotion to the law&#59; why should it 
be impossible to bring us back &#63; &#8212; You may perhaps 
say&#44; that there are no such persons among us who are 
lit to follow out the details&#33; This is only true in part. 
The whole plan can only be carried out into practice 
by slow degrees&#44; particularly that of freeing ourselves 
from gentile influence&#59; but still there are many&#44; 
wherever Israelites dwell&#44; who can do a great deal to 
forward the blessed work. Let the attempt be made 
by a united effort&#44; and some success will at once attend 
it. And have we >iot seen in this very place an ini&#8211;

this period carried on a day school for two years and a lialf&#44; and gave 
it up finally when he found that the public did not then sympathize 
with the project. Still it culminated about twelve years afterward 
in the Uebrew Education Society&#39;s School.

years past with a success which many at one time 
despaired of&#63; And why shouhl not a general Jewish 
education succeed just as well&#44; if the same spirit were 
displayed which forwarded the pious plan just men&#8211; 
tiyned &#63; And of one thing be assured&#44; that as soon 
as there is a demand for teachers&#44; they will be forth&#8211; 
coming &#59; for the time never yet was that the law of 
our God had not its devoted followers&#44; who meditated 
therein day and night&#44; and from whose lips flowed 
wisdom and instruction. 

My advice is&#44; therefore&#44; brethren &#33; that schools 
for general education under Jewish superintendence 
should be established forthwith in every place where 
they are not&#44; and be reformed and put upon a per&#8211; 
manent footing where they are already in existence. 
The sciences can well be blended with the study of 
religion &#59; and do not imagine that the teaching of 
the former will be hurtful to the latter&#44; or that the 
careful study of the Bible and commentators will 
retard the progress in science. They&#44; who tell you 
the opposite&#44; are either not acquainted with general 
knowledge or ignorant of the language and tendency 
of Scripture&#59; or they confound what is unessential 
or merely an abuse with the fundamental doctrines 
and duties which have been handed down to us. &#8212; It 
is not enough to let your children have an occasional 
and hurried glimpse at God&#39;s word&#44; and then to leave 
them to draw their own conclusion &#59; it is not enough 
that tliey have once in a while a lesson in Hebrew or 
religious books &#59; but they should be constantly under 
such guidance that they may daily learn more famil&#8211; 
iarly our own national speech&#44; and drink in&#44; literally&#44; 
the proper understanding of the words of the living

Gocl. For then will piety entwine itself with their 
soul&#44; and will become a part of their very nature. It 
will then not be necessary for j&#39;ou io threaten punish&#8211; 
ment for disobedience to their duties&#59; for they will 
practise cheerfully what their intelligent teacher im&#8211; 
presses on their mind&#44; provided you do not counter&#8211; 
act at home&#44; by injudicious levity on sacred subjects&#44; 
a direct contradiction of what is taught at school&#44; or 
an exhibition of irreligious conduct&#44; the impression 
which is produced b&#41;&#42; him whom you have chosen as 
their moral guide. &#8212; If you have capacity&#44; introduce 
frequently religious conversation &#59; explain a portion 
of the history of the Scriptures&#44; expatiate on the 
beauty of a commandment&#59; have the Bible read&#44; and 
whenever the Hebrew is taught&#44; let the children fre&#8211; 
quently render for you some passage into the vernac&#8211; 
ular language. For there is nothing so eflcctual in 
iillino&#58; the mind with willinc&#59; obedience&#44; as a thorouo&#59;h 
understanding of our duties&#59; and whence could we 
obtain this in greater perfection than from the words 
of the Bible themselves&#63; And thus also says our 
text&#58; &#34; And ye shall teach them to your children&#44; to 
speak of them&#44; when thou sittest in thy house&#44; and 
when thou walkest by the way&#44; when thou liest down&#44; 
and when thou risest up.&#34; In the first place permit 
the children to obtain correct information by such 
agents and means as have been pointed out to you. 
Then let your conversation revert to the same when 
you are at home in the bosom of your tamily&#59; let 
prayers and devotional exercises be a portion of your

see that yon are willing to acknowledge your depend&#8211; 
ence on the Lord&#44; and anxious to derive information 
from his word&#44; and they will be stimulated to ac&#8211; 
quire likewise a holy feeling&#44; and to grow in grace 
and piety. When you are abroad with them&#44; draw 
their attention to the beauty of the objects which 
everywhere present themselves&#44; and tell them that 
the whole is the work of the One great universal 
Power whom you worship. Tell them also of the 
goodness He manifested in changing for a time the 
course of nature to effect the redemption of Israel 
from bondage&#44; and in the announcement of the law 
from Sinai. When the time for repose draws near&#44; 
let them pray and repeat the confession of our faith&#44; 
and do yourselves participate in their devotion. Let 
the same be the case in the morning&#44; when you and

there is a time for all things. Do this&#44; brethren and

vote all your leisure to amusement&#44; but spend occa&#8211; 
sionally an hour for the moral progress of your off&#8211;

for you &#59; but practice will render you more ready&#44; 
and in a little while you will become excellent in&#8211; 
structors&#44; and you will be rewarded by the greater do&#8211; 
cility and more prompt obedience of your children &#59; 
and know that by no means whatever can you fit 
them better to become favourites of God and beloved 
of man&#44; than by rendering them faithful Israelites 
and strict adherents of the law of Moses. &#8212; If thus 
you constitute your fireside a school of piety&#44; and 
your home the sanctuary of religion &#58; well may then 
the name of the Almighty inscribed on the Mezuzah 
appear on the door&#8211;posts of your house and of your

hold the ancestral law&#44; and look forward to a return 
unto the now waste hills of the once lovely land&#44;

Lord will send to spread over the whole earth peace&#44; 
freedom&#44; piety&#44; and devotion to the Almighty&#39;s will&#44;

Friends and Israelites&#33; 

The benevolent daughters of our people composing 
the Female Hebrew Benevolent Society of Philadel&#8211; 
phia have deputed me again to lay before you a brief 
account of their stewardship of the funds intrusted 
to their care. And well it was that your liberality

tide of eternity with the years that have heen and 
are passed away for ever. For&#44; sorrow&#44; poverty and 
anguish have not been absent&#44; and every day almost 
some hapless stranger&#44; some lone woman&#44; has pre&#8211; 
sented claims which could not be overlooked&#44; and 
which have been supplied as far as the funds of our 
sisters have allowed and as actual necessity required. 
Yes&#44; persons to whom the tongue of this land is un&#8211; 
known have resorted hither in search of a happier 
home than their own native land afforded&#44; and when 
they had arrived found themselves overwhelmed by 
dire and oppressive want. What now would have 
been their situation if not some kind helping hand&#44; 
under Providence&#44; had stepped forward to supply the 
couch for sickness&#44; the fireside for refreshing heat&#44; 
the bread for the infants&#44; and the shelter of the friend&#8211; 
ly roof for the aged and infirm &#63; Acts of this nature 
have been accomplished in the last year&#44; by the judi&#8211; 
cious application of the small means&#44; small for so ex&#8211; 
tensive a use&#44; placed at the disposal of the society &#59; 
and thus blessings have been scattered&#44; joys diftused&#44; 
and sorrows lightened&#59; and the friendless stranger&#44; 
friendless as she thought herself far from her native 
soil&#44; has found friends and protectors in the kind 
daughters of Israel who&#44; true to the characteristics 
of their race&#44; are rctiringly unostentatious&#44; merciful 
in their sympathies to the sufferings of their fellow&#8211; 
mortals&#44; and kindly intent upon bestowing the fruits 
of beneficence to all who need. It is not as the eulo&#8211; 
gist of the society and their doings that I say this&#44; 
but merely because last year I was called upon to ap&#8211; 
peal to your generosity in support of their treasury&#44; 
which appeal was so liberally answered&#44; that it ap&#8211;

pears to be obligatory upon me to state briefly that 
the funds collected have been so applied as the donors 
had a right to expect&#44; and thereby to foster the virtu&#8211; 
ous resolution of again enabling our sisters to keep 
up to its full measure the system of charity upon 
which they have been hitherto acting. And truly 
there is need of this bounty &#33; For the transactions 
of this and other charitable institutions&#44; here as well 
as in neighbouring cities&#44; amply prove&#44; that with in&#8211; 
creased means the annual suiplus has not increased 
in equal proportions&#59; for the poor of other countries&#44; 
chiefly from the over&#8211;populated districts of Europe&#44; 
annually crowd hither in increased numbers to ob&#8211; 
tain under the protection of equal laws and the un&#8211; 
trammelled exercise of their industry a more extended 
reward for their labours&#44; than can be procured in their 
native lands. Naturally enough&#44; among the many of 
small means&#44; persons in the pinching state of indi&#8211; 
gence may be induced to sacritice their little&#44; their 
all&#44; in order to reach this land&#44; perhaps this very city&#59; 
and no sooner are they here&#44; than they feel that even 
in this land a person must have&#44; to use the language 
of the people&#44; a start in life&#59; or perhaps sickness or 
other afiiictions may at once arrest their labouring 
hand upon their first coming hither. Shall people 
like these be compelled to hold out their hands to 
ask for alms from strangers to their faith&#63; shall they 
be compelled to resort to the poor&#8211;house&#44; that refuge 
for the viciotis and improvident no less than the hon&#8211; 
est poor&#63; or shall they be left in want of every thing 
at times perhaps when the female has to bear the 
pangs of maternity&#44; or when the aged sire is unable 
to raise his drooping head&#44; sinking fast into the grave

of his forefathers&#44; from his bed of sickness &#63; Or shall 
they be told to toil away&#44; like the cruel Pharaoh said 
to our oppressed ancestors&#58; &#34;Go ye now and toil&#44; 
and straw shall not be given you &#63;&#34; Shall they be 
left in such distress that the fear of starvation must 
compel them to transgress the law of our Maker and 
ivcdeemer&#63; Surely this cannot be&#44; this is not the 
wish of one of you&#44; my honoured hearers &#33; and I am 
not far wrong in maintaining that many&#44; if not all&#44; 
would divide their last loaf in order to obviate such 
extreme cases of hardship. But such a demand is 
not made. God has helped us&#59; we have means&#44; we 
have more than we absolutely need for ourselves&#59; 
and even if the last year has deprived us of a part 
of our wealth&#44; still enough has been left to compel 
us to confess in honest truth that&#44; though less weal&#8211; 
thy&#44; we have yet means sufficient to assist&#44; even if it 
be with a mere trifle&#44; those less favoured than our&#8211; 
selves. Let us give this trifle&#44; let us bestow it this 
day on the ladies&#39; society&#44; the members of which are 
our security that the amount collected will be dis&#8211; 
tributed so as to be made subservient to promote the 
greatest amount of good consistent with their rules&#44; 
and we may be assured that&#44; no matter to whom 
given&#44; great beneflt wall be the result&#59; for experi&#8211; 
ence has taught us&#44; that the recipients of relief from 
our various benevolent associations have often&#44; I may 
almost say&#44; generally&#44; been enabled ultimately to 
obtain a livelihood by their own industry&#44; perhaps 
through the very charity originally bestowed by 
these blessed treasuries&#44; yes&#44; thrice blessed treasuries 
of the Lord &#33; and when they had obtained a moderate 
competency many have reimbursed the amount re&#8211;

ceived&#44; and joined themselves in turn to ns in order 
to propagate the good work themselves&#44; and to be 
bestowers in place of receivers of benevolence. And 
herein lies the chief characteristic dillercnce between 
the cliarity of an individnal and a society. If an in&#8211; 
dividual gives&#44; it is almost universally an absolute 
gift&#44; and the receiver is placed under obligation to 
the donor for as much as is given&#44; and even if he 
should prosper in life&#44; he can hardly insult his bene&#8211; 
factor by offering him back the small amount re&#8211; 
ceived &#59; and consequently a species of superiority on 
the one&#44; and dependence on the other hand is thus 
maintained&#44; extremely injurious at times to the ex&#8211; 
istence of friendship between persons who miglit 
otherwise have been friends. But if a society is the 
almoner&#44; no feeling of dependence on individuals is 
engendered&#59; the idea of an irredeemable obligation 
can find no place in the mind of the poor&#44; and if he 
is afterwards blessed&#44; and sees that he can now return 
what was given him in the hour of his need&#44; there is 
a ready opportunity of his doing so&#44; for the treasury 
of the association will jilways gladly receive back 
what it dispensed&#59; and therefore&#44; although the debt 
of gratitude is not cancelled&#44; still it presses not down 
the individual independence&#44; which&#44; if properly fos&#8211; 
tered&#44; is the basis of every honourable character. I 
need not cite instances where charity thus given was 
returned &#59; nor if even this did not take place&#44; where 
the bounty once bestowed produced a permanent re&#8211; 
lief&#59; for your experience will supply such instances. 
And surely the idea that with a small gift you may 
be the moons of raising a fellow&#8211;being from absolute 
want to comparative ease and afiiuence &#59; the idea of 

<pb n="334"/>

saving by timely assistance a despairing brother from 
the depth of temptation&#44; crime&#44; and misery&#44; must be 
enough to induce all of you to give &#34; each according 
to the blessing of tlie Lord which He hath given 
you.&#34; 

Another advantage resulting from hibours of a so&#8211; 
ciety is&#44; that charity can be and is given with more 
discrimination &#59; since the managers of a public insti&#8211; 
tution are bound by every consideration to guard 
against imposition by persons feigning necessity 
where none exists &#59; whereas individuals&#44; however 
anxious to distinguish&#44; can seldom spare the time to 
make the necessary investigation. It may perhaps 
be urged&#44; that the certainty almost of obtaining re&#8211; 
lief may embolden many to lay their situation open 
and demand relief&#44; who perhaps by their own appli&#8211; 
cation and perseverance might have been able to help 
themselves. This is certainly often the case&#44; and 
p&#41;ersons have been known who thus in a measure 
fraudulently obtained assistance&#59; but the number so 
transgressing against the commandment implied in 
the annunciation&#44; &#34;By the sweat of thy face shalt 
thou eat bread&#44;&#34; bears not any proportion to those 
who have honestly a claim upon our sympathy&#44; and 
truly it is better that now and then our managers 
should bestow largesses where none arc properly re&#8211; 
quired&#44; than that the really deserving should suffer 
from a too cautious distribution. It nmst at the same 
time be observed&#44; that a hesitancy in replying to ques&#8211; 
tions when an applicant is examined&#44; does not always 
demonstrate unworthinoss&#44; or a consciousness that 
direct replies would debar liiiu from relief&#59; on the 
contrary&#44; it may proceed from a sense of shame&#44; that

is unwilling to let strangers know the full extent of 
evil which the Lord has in his judgment decreed

disclosing the tithe of what they have to endure.

the means to relieve the wo they see&#44; should not wait

This is the extensive field of universal henevoleuce

the blessed dawn that shows him the friendly haven &#58;

minate the path of those acting righteously. And as 
the same mariner&#39;s health and strength are reinvigor&#8211; 
ated when he finds that safety is within his reach &#58; so 
will virtuous deeds constantly make us progress on&#8211;

he casts his anchor in the harbour of security&#44; when 
all perils are overcome &#58; so shall we rejoice when we

ourselves everlasting joys&#44; &#8212; eternal bliss by temporal 
sacrifices. Let me then again call on you&#44; brothers

day think that ere three years had passed away&#44; I

which his mortal remains are laid. I almost shrink 
from the task&#44; and gladly would I have been absent 
this day&#44; and not taxed my feelings by officiating on 
this mournful occasion. Eut it comports not with 
the duty of a servant of the holy One to withhold his

with bis bereaved family over tbe fatber&#44; the husband&#44; 
and friend&#59; since&#44; independently of tbe family con&#8211; 
nexion subsisting between us&#44; my first associations in 
tbis country are connected with our deceased brother. 
When I had crossed the broad Atbmtic Ocean&#44; and 
bad escaped by tbe almost miraculous interposition 
of Providence from the fury of tlie equinoctial storm 
and tbe raging of tbe mountain billows&#44; and when I 
bad recovered from a paijiful illness alter my arrival 
on these shores&#44; and when I repaired to tbe bouse of 
God &#58; it was Mr&#44; Seixas&#39; voice that I first beard lifted 
up in prayer to the throne of Grace&#44; and in his pres&#8211; 
ence it was that I returned thanks for tbe undeserved 
mercy that had been shown unto me. Several j&#8211;ears 
after this elapsed that I lived under his ministrj&#8211;&#44; and 
I will mention it to bis credit&#44; and it is a fact with 
which few of you are acquainted&#44; that be was the first 
who proposed what has since been carried into suc&#8211; 
cessful operation&#44; I mean the gratuitous instruction 
in religious matters on certain days in tbe week. It 
was in the Synagogue at Richmond &#8211;where he&#44; feebly&#8211; 
assisted by me&#44; commenced teaching on tbe Sabbath 
and the first day of the week&#44; such children and 
youths as desired religious instruction. If tbe suc&#8211; 
cess was not so great as we at one time hoped&#44; it was 
owing to the great difliculties Ave had to encounter. 
But I may freely say&#44; that tbe seed was thus sown&#44; 
and one at least has ever since bad hopes of a revival 
of religion among our brethren in tbis land&#44; and he 
trusts to be spared to see tbe devoutly wished&#8211;for con&#8211;

summation happily accomplished. A hlessed time in&#8211; 
deed will that hour be&#44; when our3&#39;Ouths and maidens&#44; 
natives of this soil&#44; will be joyful servants of the Most 
High&#44; devoted followers of the law of the God of Ja&#8211; 
cob &#33; And when we see the spread of piety when 
we see many disenthralled from the bonds of selfish 
gain &#58; let us pronounce a blessing on the name of him 
who was the first to commence the rigliteous work&#44; 
which has since been undertaken with promise of 
better success by the pious daughters of Israel in dif&#8211; 
ferent places&#44; as is known to you all this day. 

But this is not the only cause why I should mourn 
with the nearest friends and relatives of the deceased. 
It was under him that I first learned the accepted 
mode of our worship&#44; and was thus fitted to be sum&#8211; 
moned to ofiiciate in the sanctuary where I have these 
ten years endeavoured&#44; though I fear unworthily&#44; to 
proclaim the word of life&#44; which has been graciously 
bestowed on a sinning world by its merciful Creator. 
Many times&#44; since that period&#44; have the hand of afilic&#8211; 
tion&#44; and the suft&#39;ering of severe bodily illness been 
laid on me &#59; death in various forms has threatened 
me&#44; once especially&#44; when the beloved&#44; the only other 
son of my parents was removed from me &#58; I could not 
then imagine that I should be snficred to survive to 
officiate on this occasion&#44; and to perform the last sol&#8211; 
enni rites of our faith over him whom I may freely 
call my teacher&#44; without a great stretch of the imagi&#8211; 
nation. But so are the inscrutable decrees of Provi&#8211; 
dence &#59; &#34; He woundeth&#44; and his hands also heal&#44;&#34; 
&#34; He bringcth down to the grave&#44; and raiscth up 
again&#59;&#34; and we see his onniipotent power displayed 
no less in bis visitations than in his mercies. Let

US therefore improve the occasioji&#44; mournful and af&#8211; 
flictive thongh it he&#44; so that the death of this ser&#8211; 
vant in the house of God may redound to our ad&#8211; 
vantage. It was hut&#44; so to say&#44; j&#8211;esterday&#44; that he 
walked among us &#59; not two weeks have elapsed since 
he accompanied me on my return to the city where I 
have been chosen as the messenger of the congrega&#8211; 
tion &#59; we parted in the principal street of this exten&#8211; 
sive city&#59; he appeared in health&#44; and surely no thought 
of so speedy a dissolution could have entered into his 
imagination. Yet scarcely had a week rolled on in 
the ceaseless course of time&#44; wdien I heard tidings of 
his illness&#44; and next of his unexpected and lamented 
death. &#8212; Often and often has this truth been forced 
upon our view&#44; that the tenure of life is uncertain&#44; 
that we are not assured whether to&#8211;morrow&#39;s sun will 
shine for us&#44; or whether the rising moon&#44; which finds 
us in high expectation of a length of years&#44; may not 
send her setting rays upon our couch of death. Yes&#44; 
so uncertain is life&#59; and still our plans reach as it 
were into the space of centuries &#59; we grasp the exist&#8211; 
ence of many generations&#44; when scarcely one hour 
may yet be ours. But does it not strike you that this 
grasping and this striving do not become man des&#8211; 
tined to die&#63; should one whose life is so limited&#44; ex&#8211; 
tend his view so far&#44; and seek for things wdiich he 
cannot attain &#63; Better indeed would it be for each 
and all&#44; were every man early to reflect on the fleet&#8211; 
ing state of his existence here&#44; and to fix his hopes 
on yonder haven beyond the grave &#8212; the grave&#44; the 
embrace of which no one can escape&#44; were he to live 
a thousand years&#44; instead of the threescore and ten 
allotted to us. These hopes would teach him&#44; that he

has the power given him of earning felicity by an obe&#8211; 
dience to the will of his Maker&#44; who&#44; in giving him 
life and being&#44; also bestowed on him a law wliich&#44; if 
obeyed&#44; will lead to happiness. But there is no time 
for delay &#8212; next year &#8212; next month &#8212; to&#8211;morrow &#8212; nay&#44; 
this day&#44; this hour&#44; may be our last&#44; and the opportu&#8211; 
nity may thus be lost of acquiring felicity&#44; if we do 
not act immediately. It becomes therefore our duty 
to act always so&#44; as though every day were the last 
of our life&#44; and to endeavour to repair through re&#8211; 
pentance any evil which we may have committed&#44; &#8212; 
in order that we may deserve the favour of our Maker 
at any moment when it may please Him to summon 
us in his presence. Obedience to the will of God is 
truly the balm of life&#44; the real object of our existence&#59; 
for its riches no tyrant can ever take from us&#44; its 
wealth no misfortune can snatch away&#44; and no can&#8211; 
ker&#8211;worm can deface the beauty of the garment which 
it throws around our spirit. For thus teaches the 
Bible &#58; 

&#34;The end of the matter&#44; even all that hath boon heard is&#44; fear 
God and keep his commandments &#59; for this is the whole duty of 
man.&#34; Ecc. xii. 13. 

If we are then snatched away after a brief notice 
from earthly life and its enjoyments &#58; we shall have 
the consolation in our last moments&#44; a consolation 
outweighing far all the pearls of Persia&#44; and the dia&#8211; 
monds from the sands of India&#44; more sweet by far

than the senseless shout of admiring thousands&#44; of 
having accomplished our task on earth&#44; and of being 
able to restore our soul in its purity into the hands 
of Him who gave it. 

Let us hope that he&#44; for whom we now mourn&#44; has 
been received into the abode of the righteous&#44; among 
those who have fulfilled well their mission on earth&#59; 
and that his sins have been forgiven &#40;for there is no 
man so righteous that he sin not&#41;&#59; and that his bodily 
sufferings and the pangs of death have purified his 
spirit from the dross of iniquity. &#8212; But for those who 
survive him&#44; for his bereaved widow&#44; his fatherless 
children&#44; let us invoke the mercy of Heaven&#58; may 
He bestow on them his consolation&#44; even his blessed 
spirit&#44; which abideth with the lowly and contrite&#44; and 
may He shield them by his beneficent protection 
from all evil&#44; and guide them unto happiness both on 
earth and when their spirit is freed from the trammels 
of the body. May He be the Protector of the widow&#44; 
and the Father of the fatherless&#44; and teach them to 
regard Him&#44; the holy and righteous One&#44; as their sole 
Refuge&#44; as He is the Refuge and Solace of all the 
children of man&#44; and especially of his people Israel&#44; 
whom He chose to be his servants&#44; and the promulga&#8211; 
tors of his law on earth. Amen.

ON THE 

PERSECUTION OF THE JflWS IN THE EAST. 



DELIVERED AT 



THE SYNAGOGUE MIKVEH ISRAEL&#44; 

ON THDRSDAY EVENING&#44; THE 28th OF AB&#44; 5600&#8212; 27th OF AUGUST&#44; 1840. 



A MEETING to express sympathy and to devise means of relief for 
the Israelites persecuted in the East&#44; especially in Damascus&#44; Syria&#44; 
on account of false accusations&#44; as though they had been guilty of 
the death of a Catholic priest&#44; was held in the Synagogue as men&#8211; 
tioned above &#58; when Mr. A. Hart gave a succinct history of the 
cruelties practised against our brethren&#44; and concluded with an ap&#8211; 
peal to the feelings and sympathy of the audience. I then spoke 
as follows &#58; 

Mr. Chairman and Brethren &#33; 

The gentleman who has preceded me has stated to 
you the reason of our asssembling at this unusual 
time&#42; at the house of God. We&#44; the inhabitants of a 
land where a benevolent Providence causes to prevail 
an equality of rights and an entire freedom in relig&#8211; 
ious pursuits&#44; have met for the purpose of publicly 
expressing our sympathy for those of our brothers 

&#42; Alluding to the lateness of the hour&#44; which was past the usual 
period of the evening service.

348 PERSECUTION OF THE JEWS. 

who&#44; living where the &#34;bond of slavery twineth&#44;&#34; 
have lately been subjected to persecutions at which 
the blood runs cold&#44; and this for the sake of false ac&#8211; 
cusations brought against them&#44; not as men&#44; but as 
members of the Jewish community. Were it that 
they only suftered unjustly&#44; even if the charge did not 
touch our ancient system of faith&#44; still&#44; as sons of Is&#8211; 
rael&#44; we ourselves would fed the wrong that they 
have unjustly to bear. But now we have an addi&#8211; 
tional incentive to rouse our every feeling of commis&#8211; 
eration and regret&#59; since the religion&#44; which we pro&#8211; 
fess in common with them&#44; has been stigmatized as 
though it authorized the shedding of human blood at 
the recurrence of the annual Passover. You may 
perhaps smile that such an absurd accusation should 
at all be made &#33; you may feel contempt at the ignor&#8211; 
ance which could give credence to such superannuated 
folly&#33; but our smile of derision&#44; our hearty contempt&#44; 
do not affect the mass who regard not with kindness 
the remnant of Israel&#44; and will not disarm the malice 
of those who are only glad of ever&#92; opportunity to 
send new sorrows to our bosoms. &#8212; It is not the first 
time that it has been said and believed that the Jews 
are commanded to slay their Christian neighbours&#59; 
and at a time when the pestilence raged over almost 
the whole known world&#44; our people were accused of 
causing the great destruction of human life by poison&#8211; 
ing the wells&#44; simply because in proportion to num&#8211; 
bers less Jews died than Christians. The consequence 
was that multitudes of the accused were butchered 
without pity&#44; and those whom the Black Death had 
spared fell a prey to the fury of an excited populace&#44; 
rendered lawless by the prevalence of a fatal disorder&#44; 

<pb n="349"/>

which daily hurried thousands to the tomb. And 
whenever superstition and rapacity wished to glut 
themselves in the destruction of our defenceless race&#44; 
the charge of murder for our religious rites was raised&#44; 
and&#44; as was the case lately&#44; it was made the pretext 
for unsheathing the sword and dooming countless 
numbers of innocent victims to merciless slaughter. 
O &#33; then were times of sorrow and affliction&#59; we wept&#44; 
but no one pitied&#44; our gore rendered turbid the 
streams&#44; but all passed carelessly by &#59; they heeded 
not our cries&#44; they regarded us as aliens to the rights 
of man&#44; outcasts from Divine favour. Those &#34;were 
indeed times when our harps were hung upon the 
willows&#59; when the voice of wailing was heard in every 
home&#59; when the houses of prayer were filled&#44; not 
with living worshippers&#44; but with the bodies of those 
slain by the unpitying persecutor. Whither then 
could we fly &#63; We were shunned as murderers&#44; as 
those unclean with leprosy&#44; as banished from the pale 
of the laws &#59; and every land almost forbade us its 
boundaries&#44; nearly every city shut its .gates against 
our fugitives &#59; and where we were permitted to rest 
awhile we had to purchase at a high price the pro&#8211; 
tection of some powerful chieftain&#44; whether civil or 
ecclesiastical &#59; and then we had to suffer ourselves to 
be confined to narrow and unwholesome quarters&#44; 
and to be marked in our garments as sons of Jacob. 
Well might a noble poet&#44;&#42; who&#44; had he always acted 
as he at times felt&#44; would have been the glory of hu&#8211; 
man nature&#44; thus speak of the sorrowing nation de&#8211; 
scended from Abraham &#58;

1. 

&#34; Oh &#33; weep for those that wept by Babel&#39;s stream&#44; 
Whose shrines are desolate&#44; whose land a dream&#59; 
Weep for the harp of Judali&#39;s broken shell&#59; 
Mourn &#8212; where their God hath dwelt the godless dwell &#33; 

2. 
And where shall Israel lave her bleeding feet &#63; 
And when shall Zion&#39;s songs again seem sweet&#63; 
And Judah&#39;s melody once more rejoice 
The hearts that leaped before its heavenly voice &#63; 

3. 
Tribes of the wandering foot and weary breast&#44; 
How shall ye flee away and be at rest &#63; 
The wild dove hath her nest&#44; the fox his cave. 
Mankind their country &#8212; Israel but the grave&#33;&#34; 

This was literally true for centuries&#44; our homes 
were not safe from invasion&#44; our sanctuaries ever 
open to the spoiler&#44; and our sons and daughters con&#8211; 
stantly the object of derision&#44; or food for the sword. 
Mankind had conspired against us&#44; and death alone 
was viewed as an unassailable refuge against the ills 
that accumulated over our heads. And even where 
permission to dwell was granted us&#44; we were 3&#39;et ex&#8211; 
eluded from a share in equal rights&#44; and tolerated 
merely as excrescences on the body&#34;&#42; politic&#44; con&#8211; 
demned to low pursuits&#44; &#8212; prohibited the exercise of 
mechanic arts and the study of ennobling professions&#44; 
&#8212; and continually subjected to exactions and rapine. 

In those days of atiiiction&#44; contempt and scorn 
were our universal portion &#59; and Turk&#44; and Pagan&#44; 
and Christian&#44; alike contributed to pour the bitter&#8211; 
ness of gall into our cup of life. Yet through us 
bad the world been greatly blessed since the latter 
days of the first temple. Our views of the Deity&#44; of 

<pb n="351"/>

PERSECUTION OF THE JEWS. 351 

the exalted attributes of the Creator&#44; had bj degrees 
been infused into the philosophy of the heathen&#44; and 
they had learned a new source of joy by looking unto 
a state of pure enjoyment after the life of the body 
had become extinct&#44; and to regard the idols which 
they worshipped in their true light of creatures of 
the imagination. &#8212; At a later period there arose one 
of our own community&#44; who&#44; be the accounts related 
of him false or true&#44; was nevertheless the means of 
the spread of a system analogous to our own over a 
large portion of the pagan world &#59; he became&#44; though 
doubtless without himself dreaming of such a result&#44; 
the messenger of better things to many who knew 
not God. Still was he a son of Abraham&#44; a professor 
of the same religion we profess at this very hour&#59; 
and he enjoined&#44; if there be any truth in the books 
said to contain an account of his life&#44; an adherence 
to the law as it existed at his day &#59; at the same time 
all the injunctions of brotherly love which he is said 
to have promulgated&#44; are clearly referable to the Law 
of Moses and the sayings of our blessed Rabbins. &#8212; 
After his death&#44; and centuries after his religion had 
begun&#44; to spread&#44; there appeared another claiming af&#8211; 
finity with our race&#44; and pronounced himself inspired 
to teach better things to mankind&#59; and he too founded 
his doctrines upon the Law of Moses&#44; even so far as to 
recognize&#44; in addition to tlie unity of God&#44; a weekly 
day of rest and the prohibition of certain articles of 
food&#44; beside the fundamental covenant of Abraham. 
Speedily persuasion and the sword banished&#44; under 
his guidance and that of his immediate successors&#44; 
the worship of idols from Arabia&#44; Iran&#44; Tartary&#44; and 
the far India&#59; even Ethiopia&#44; the coasts of Africa&#44;

and Spain&#44; nay&#44; the very distant islands of tlie East&#8211; 
ern Archipelago&#44; and the countries beyond the great 
desert&#44; inaccessible almost now to the European&#39;s 
foot&#44; acknowledged the sway of the Koran&#44; and the 
Islam became the law of as large a portion of man&#8211; 
kind as then acknowledged the Christian Gospels&#44; 
&#8212; Yet&#44; take it as we will&#44; these two mighty revolu&#8211; 
tions in opinion were the eft&#39;ect of the religion of the 
Jews&#44; an adoption of an essential part&#44; with the re&#8211; 
jection of the ceremonial laws&#44; by many and power&#8211; 
ful nations. In this manner then were civilization 
and an enliglitened philosophy indebted to the Jews&#44; 
or rather the code they then obeyed&#44; and to this day 
obey&#44; for much&#44; if not all their progress&#59; and what&#8211; 
ever of equality of rights&#44; of mercy&#44; and benevolence&#44; 
is now prevalent&#44; we may freely say&#44; has its founda&#8211; 
tion in the Pentateuch&#44; the law of the Jews. Does 
now the Christian religion recommend human sacri&#8211; 
fice &#63; does the Koran command a victim to be slain 
at the gneat festival of the Moslems &#63; We know the 
answer must be in the negative &#59; nothing but igno&#8211; 
rance&#44; wilful ignorance&#44; could charge the AEonotheists 
who are not Jews with the commission of a crime so 
foreign to their belief. But docs the Jewish law&#44; 
less than that of Christians or Mahonicdans&#44; demand 
the exercise of mercy&#44; forbid the commission of mur&#8211; 
der &#63; We have yet to learn that it does&#59; for he who 
has no mercy is no son of Israel&#44; and he who pollutes 
his hands with human blood becomes a prey to the 
sword of the avenger. We know of no ditfercnee 
between the Israelite and the stranger&#59; we are bound 
to assist every one in distress&#44; and our neighbour is

And yet&#44; how much have we had to suffer&#44; because 
of the accusation that we employed human blood&#44; 
the blood of our Christian fellow&#8211;men&#44; in the celebra&#8211; 
tion of the birth of our people &#33; We ask. Where is 
the historical evidence that such a thing ever took 
place &#63; We demand&#44; Where is the permission to be 
discovered&#44; I will not say in the Pentateuch&#44; but in 
any of our writings &#63; To eat of the blood&#44; nay&#44; in 
the smallest quantity&#44; of a brute animal&#44; is most en&#8211; 
ergetically interdicted&#58; and can reason be so blinded 
as to suppose&#44; that we would mix human blood in 
the unleavened bread&#44; over which we call down the 
blessings of the Lord&#44; and return thanks for his 
manifold mercies to his people Israel&#63; We will ad&#8211; 
mit&#44; that at a period when the rights of the subject 
were but imperfectly understood&#44; when a pontiff&#34; 
could dispose of crowns as of ecclesiastical benefices&#44; 
when a mighty effort was made to enforce a uni&#8211; 
formity of opinions&#44; when the iron&#8211;clad barons were 
not able to sign their names&#44; when might made right&#44; 
and the dictum of one man could not be disputed&#44;

the persuasion of those whose lead they followed&#44; to 
believe any absurdity with regard to the Jews who 
lived among them as outcasts from human rights&#44; 
and whose supposed wealth was always an object to 
be coveted by the lords no less than by the rabble. 
But it surpasses belief that&#44; with the progress of en&#8211;

Spain&#44; once the slave at the feet of an Inquisition&#44; 
demands a free constitution&#44; and when the new Sul&#8211; 
tan of the Osmalins gives a new charter to his people&#44; 
who will doubtless in future ages revere the name of 
Abdul Medjid&#44; whatever his fate now may be in those 
mutations&#44; from which thrones are not exempt. &#8212; We 
cannot be too much astonished at the folly or eft&#39;ron&#8211; 
tery which&#44; at the present day&#44; pretends to lend cre&#8211; 
dence to a foul calumny which the better disposed&#44; 
during even the dark ages&#44; refused to entertain. But 
so it is&#44; the mass is ever ready to put faith in the 
marvellous and the extraordinary no matter if their 
absurdity should be apparent on the very surface&#59; 
and all we can say is that&#44; with the progress of civil&#8211; 
ization&#44; many have fallen behind the march of intellect 
in others&#44; and that human nature is prone to err&#44; and 
this in an aggravated degree&#44; at all ages of the world. 
Were any proof of this wanting&#44; the recent tragic 
scenes in Damascus and Rhodes would give ample 
confirmation. You must know&#44; Mr. Chairman&#44; that 
not everywhere have our rights been acknowledged 
as in this happy land&#44; happy for the Israelite&#44; be&#8211; 
cause here no one can demand of him a test&#8211;oath to 
testify to that which he inwardly disbelieves&#44; before 
he is permitted to fill a station for which his talents 
qualily him. Yet&#44; in many lands we are tolerated 
merely&#44; and constitute not a part of the state&#44; as we 
do here and in some other enlightened countries. So&#44;

not hold sacred&#44; but is over at the mercy of the des&#8211; 
pot&#44; and the possession of wealth is often the passport 
to destruction. 

Now it so happened&#44; as 3&#8211;ou ah&#8211;eady know&#44; that an 
old man disappeared &#59; whether murdered or not&#44; no 
one has clearly shown &#59; and if murdered&#44; it has not 
yet been proved&#44; as far as our knowledge extends&#44; 
who his murderers are. But our brothers in Damas&#8211; 
cus are wealthy&#44; they are subject&#44; at the best of times&#44; 
to great cruelties and grinding exactions &#58; and do you 
think that so favourable an opportunity for pillage 
would be suftered to pass &#63; Little would you know 
the spirit of despotism if you were to think so&#59; for 
though ever ready to oppress&#44; it greedily seizes every 
opportunity to give some colouring of justice to its 
exactions. The result has been what might naturally 
have been expected. One humble individual&#44; at iirst 
arrested upon the vaguest suspicion&#44; was beaten till 
his tormentors could not do otherwise than cease in 
the infliction&#59; he was taken back to prison&#44; and 
there tampered with to induce him to accuse&#44; not 
those of a low degree like himself&#44; but the first in 
wealth and learning which the city could furnish. 
They were seized and tortured &#59; some died under 
the excruciating pain they had to endure &#59; others 
accused themselves guilty of the crime of murder&#8211; 
ing the missing individual &#59; one adopted the Mussul&#8211; 
man religion&#59; whilst others&#44; patiently enduring the 
most intense suffering&#44; still clung to the truth&#44; and 
refused making any confession of guilt in themselves 
or others&#44; of which they were guiltless. The name 
of one of these noble martyrs has reached me&#44; it is

broken down. Such a man doserves to be held in 
honourable remembrance for future ages&#44; as an ex&#8211; 
ample of a true Israelite&#44; who exhibited a filial con&#8211; 
fidence in his God under the greatest trials to which 
poor mortality can be subjected. &#8212; But with the seiz&#8211; 
ure of the first accused the persecution did not stop&#59; 
others of the best and noblest were barbarously mal&#8211; 
treated&#44; and many children were thrown into prison&#44; 
and kept upon miserable food&#44; to induce their pa&#8211; 
rents to come forward and accuse persons acceptable 
to the monster Sherifi&#39; Pacha&#44; who&#44; if report speaks 
true&#44; must have known from the recantation of one 
who had embraced Moslemism&#44; that the charge of 
murder against our brothers was no less false than

You may ask&#44; Why did not the Jews rise against 
their oppressors &#63; But&#44; Mr. Chairman&#44; ages of suf&#8211; 
fering deaden the spirit &#59; and they render powerless 
the hands of those who otherwise hiight strike for 
their own liberation &#59; faint&#8211;heartedness has long&#44; 
therefore&#44; been the lot of our brothers who languish 
under oppression&#44; and many have become passive 
even under every cruelty. We who&#44; under differ&#8211; 
ent circumstances&#44; feel so very differently&#44; must not&#44; 
in the knowledge of our security&#44; despise those whom 
adverse fortunes have bowed down so deeply &#59; on the 
contrary&#44; let us admire their patient endurance&#44; for 
having remained true to our faith under every trial 
they had to undergo. 

Let us from the midst of our thankfulness to God 
for having blessed us so much more than wc deserve&#44; 
express our sj&#39;rapathy for those who suffer elsewhere &#59;

those who&#44; Avith us&#44; are descended from the stock of 
the Patriarchs. But what need is there for this ap&#8211; 
peal &#63; Around me are those who have assemhled 
for no other purpose than to express&#44; in language 
not to be misunderstood&#44; that they feel for their 
brothers who languish under the cruel bondage of 
oppression&#59; that every cry of anguish&#44; uttered by 
their fellow&#8211;believers elsewhere&#44; touches a sympa&#8211; 
thetic chord in their own hearts. &#8212; 0&#44; this is a soothing 
reflection &#33; we have no country of our own &#59; we have 
no longer a united government&#44; under the shadow 
of which we can live securely &#59; but we have a tie yet 
holier than a fatherland&#44; a patriotism stronger than 
the community of one government &#58; our tie is a sin&#8211; 
cere brotherly love&#44; our patriotism is the atFection 
which unites the Israelite of one land to that of an&#8211; 
other. As citizens we belong to the country we live 
in&#59; but as believers in one God&#44; as the faithful ador&#8211; 
ers of the Creator&#44; as the inheritors of the law&#44; the 
Jews of England&#44; and Russia&#44; and Sweden are no 
aliens among us&#44; and we hail the Israelite as a broth&#8211; 
er&#44; no matter if his home be the torrid zone&#44; or where 
the poles encircle the earth with the impenetrable fet&#8211; 
ters of icy coldness. &#34;VVe have therefore met for the 
purpose of expressing our abhorrence of the calumny&#8211; 
cast on our religion in another part of the world&#44; and 
to oft&#39;er our aid&#44; in conjunction with our brothers in 
other towns&#44; both of this country and elsewhere&#44; to 
those who have been subjected to such unmerited 
barbarities. Perhaps the united voice of all the pro&#8211; 
fessors of our blessed religion may reach the ears of 
the potentates of the earth &#59; perhaps public attention 
may be roused to the wrongs we have so long sut&#8211;

fered&#44; and all acknowledge that our system is one of 
love and peace&#44; and that it is an essential point with 
us to do our duty to the state no loss than lo ohserve 
the divine commands. If this should he the case&#44; if 
those diftbring from us would grant us everywhere 
an equality of rights&#44; not as apostates from&#44; hut as 
adherents to&#44; our ancient religion &#58; then indeed will 
the martyrs at Damascus not have sufiered in vain&#44; 
for their sorrows would then bring peace to Israel. 
&#8212; Xow&#44; Mr. Chairman&#44; is this hoping for too much &#63; 
I hardly think so. Already the transaction which 
we deplore has raised up advocates for us among our 
Christian friends &#59; and if the name of Ratti&#8211;Menton 
will live in the disgrace which he so well merits&#44; the 
generous Mr. Merlato at Damascus&#44; and Mr. Laurin 
at Alexandria&#44; who there represent the Emperor of 
Austria&#44; will he remembered with gratitude for their 
unsolicited exertions in our behalf. &#8212; In England&#44; too&#44; 
the subject has awakened attention&#44; and one of its 
great minds&#44; who formerly opposed our admission to 
equal rights&#44; the renowned iSir Robert Peel&#44; has al&#8211; 
ready thought proper to mention the case of the suf&#8211; 
ferers in Parliament&#44; with every demonstration that 
he too feels that a great wrong has been done to an 
innocent people. There too has been an O&#39;Connell&#44; 
a Noel&#44; a Thompson&#44; and many others to speak in 
our behalf&#59; and doubtless in this land too&#44; perhaps 
in this city&#44; men will step forward to vindicate the 
rights of man outraged in the persons of the Jews at 
Damascus. Perhaps a voice too loud to remain un&#8211; 
heeded may be raised against the use of torture in 
trials&#44; so that the Pacha of Egypt&#44; in whose domin&#8211; 
ions are Damascus and Jerusalem&#44; may be induced

to abolish it altogether&#59; and so not we alone&#44; but all 
the inhabitants of the earth&#44; may have cause to re&#8211; 
joice in the present movement in which we are en&#8211; 
gaged&#44; though sorrow was its first promoter. And 
why should the case of the Jews be less attended to 
than that of the Greeks &#63; When the sons of ancient 
Hellas broke the chains of the Ottoman power&#44; all 
Europe and America were awakened in their be&#8211; 
half&#59; but have they any greater claim upon the sym&#8211; 
pathy of the world than we have &#63; We admit that 
the Greeks may have been the fathers of architec&#8211; 
ture&#44; of painting&#44; of sculpture&#44; and of tragic poetry&#59; 
but the world is indebted to us far more&#44; for a gift 
far nobler&#44; for the possession of the Decalogue&#44; for 
the word of God&#44; the holy and precious Bible&#44; the 
book more venerable than all books&#44; the parent of 
a pure belief&#44; the foundation of true happiness&#44; of re&#8211; 
ligion without bigotry&#44; of liberty without licentious&#8211; 
ness. 

Another happy effect has already resulted from the 
same cause &#58; it has awakened anew the spirit of broth&#8211; 
erly love among us&#44; and we have had an opportunity 
of experiencing that oceans may intervene between 
our dispersed remnants&#44; that mountains may divide 
us&#44; but that yet the Israelite is ever alive to the wel&#8211; 
fare of his distant brother&#44; and sorrows with his sor&#8211; 
row&#44; and rejoices in his joy. The times also have 
produced spirits adequate to the emergency and a 
Cremieux of Paris&#44; and a Montefiore of London&#44; will 
be long remembered as the generous&#44; active friends 
of their people&#44; who nobly volunteered to plead the 
cause of their brothers in distant lands. Let us trust 
that the Lord may prosper their way&#44; and bring them

back to their flimilies after the happy termination of 
their mission of love. 

It is now&#44; Mr. Chairman&#44; as ever it was &#58; although 
banished and scattered over every land for our mani&#8211; 
fold transgressions&#44; wc are not cast off nor utterly 
forsaken by our God. He has been our shield&#44; as 
He was the shield of our forefathers &#59; and as out of 
every evil He always caused good to spring unto Is&#8211; 
rael&#44; so let us hope that this present occasion may 
not pass away without a proportionate benefit accru&#8211; 
ing unto us and the world at large&#44; under the dispen&#8211; 
sation of his Providence. I say &#34;unto us and the 
world at large&#59;&#34; since our cause is not the cause of 
faction&#44; and when we prosper it is not for the oppres&#8211; 
sion of any human being &#59; for never yet were our 
people persecutors for opinion&#39;s sake&#44; because the 
law of God was always a code of toleration and be&#8211; 
nevolence &#59; and then&#44; the more the knowledge of the 
truth is spread&#44; the more it is understood&#44; the stronger 
will be the feeling of attachment which will unite all 
the inhabitants of the earth as a nation of brothers. 

In conclusion&#44; Mr. Chairman&#44; I will repeat the 
words of the wise Solomon&#44; invoking the blessing of 
our heavenly Father upon us and our undertaking&#58; 
&#34;The Lord our God be with us&#44; as He was with 
our fathers&#59; O may He not leave&#44; nor forsake us&#59; 
may He incline our hearts towards Him&#44; to walk in 
all his ways&#44; and to keep his commandments&#44; his 
statutes and judgments which He commanded our 
fathers.&#34; 

With your permission&#44; I will now offer a preamble 
and a series of resolutions for the approval of this 
meeting &#58;

PERSECUTION OF THE JEWS. 361 

The Israelites residing in Philadelphia&#44; in common 
with those of other places&#44; have heard with the deep&#8211; 
est sorrow&#44; that in this enlightened age the absurd 
charge of their requiring human blood&#44; at the cele&#8211; 
bration of their Passover&#44; has been revived&#44; and that 
an accusation of this nature having been brought 
against their brethren at Damascus and the Island of 
Rhodes has been the cause of a most cruel persecu&#8211; 
tion being waged against them&#44; by order of the Mus&#8211; 
sulman authorities&#44; instigated&#44; as it is feared&#44; by one 
or more of the European residents. 

They have learned also&#44; with unfeigned horror&#44; 
that several prominent men at Damascus have been 
seized by their ruthless persecutors&#44; and tortured till 
some confessed themselves guilty of a crime which 
they never committed&#59; and others died under the 
most exquisite barbarities&#44; which ignorant bigotry&#44; 
urged by the love of plunder and hatred of the Jew&#8211; 
ish name&#44; could invent. 

Although the Israelites of Philadelphia&#44; living in a 
land where&#44; under the blessing of Providence&#44; equality 
of civil and religious rights so eminently prevails&#44; 
are not in any danger of persecution for opinion&#39;s 
sake&#58; still they cannot rest while so foul a blot is 
cast upon their ancient and sacred faith&#44; a faith on 
which both the Christian and Mahomedan religions 
are founded&#44; and which is essentially a law of justice&#44; 
of mercy&#44; and benevolence &#59; and they would deem 
themselves traitors to brotherly love and the rights 
of outraged humanity&#44; were they to withhold their 
expression of sympathy for their suffering brethren&#44; 
who writhe under unmerited tortures&#44; and languish 
in loathsome dungeons&#44; and to offer their aid&#44; if prac&#8211;

ticable&#44; to have impartial justice administered to them 
upon the present and any future occasion. The Is&#8211; 
raelites of Philadelphia have therefore met in public 
meeting&#44; and 

Resolved&#44; That they experience the deepest emotions 
of sympathy for the sufferings endured by their fel&#8211; 
lows in faith at Damascus and Rhodes&#44; under the tor&#8211; 
tures and injuries inflicted upon them by merciless 
and savage persecutors &#59; and that&#44; while they moura 
for those upon whom such cruel enormities have been 
heaped&#44; they cannot but admire the fortitude evinced 
by many of the sufferers&#44; who preferred enduring 
every torture rather than subscribing to the falsehoods 
dictated by their vindictive enemies. 

Hesolvcd&#44; That the crime charged upon the Israel&#8211; 
ites of Damascus&#44; of using Christian blood for their 
festival of redemption from Egypt&#44; is utterly at vari&#8211; 
ance with the express injunction of the Decalogue 
and other parts of the Pentateuch&#44; and incompptible 
with the principles inculcated by the religion they 
profess&#44; which enjoins fhem to &#34;love their neighbour 
as themselves&#44;&#34; and &#34;to do justice&#44; love mercy&#44; and 
walk humbly before God.&#34; 

Resolved&#44; That they will co&#8211;operate with their breth&#8211; 
ren elsewhere in affording pecuniary aid&#44; if required&#44; 
to relieve the victims of this unholy persecution&#44; and 
to unite in such other measures as may be devised to 
mitigate their sufferings. 

Resolved&#44; That the thanks of this meeting be ac&#8211; 
corded to the consuls of those European powers&#44; who 
made efforts to stay the arm of persecution&#44; and who 
by this deed deserve well of the cause of suffering 
humanity. 

<pb n="363"/>

PERSECUTION OF THE JEWS. 363 

Resolved^ That this meeting highly appreciates the 
prompt and energetic measures adopted by our breth&#8211; 
ren in Europe&#44; and elsewhere&#44; for the promotion of 
theobject of this meeting&#44; and the noble undertaking 
of Monsieur Cremieux and Sir ISIoses Montefiore&#44; in 
coming forward not only as the champions of the op&#8211; 
pressed&#44; but also as the defenders of the Jewish na&#8211; 
tion &#59; and this meeting expresses the hope that the 
God of Israel will shield and protect them&#44; and restore 
them to their families in the enjoyment of unimpaired 
health. 

Resolved&#44; That&#44; in conjunction with our brethren 
in other cities&#44; a letter be addressed to the President 
of the United States&#44; respectfully requesting him to 
instruct the representative of the United States at 
Constantinople&#44; and the United States&#39; Consul in the 
dominions of the Pacha of Egypt&#44; to co&#8211;operate with 
the Ambassadors and Consuls of other powers to pro&#8211; 
cure for our accused brethren at Damascus and else&#8211; 
where an impartial trial &#59; and to urge upon the Em&#8211; 
peror of Turkey and the Paclta of Egypt to prohibit 
the use of torture in their judicial proceedings&#59; and 
farther&#44; that he be requested to instruct the represen&#8211; 
tatives of this country to urge the governments to 
which they are accredited&#44; to exert their influence 
for the same purpose.&#42; 



&#42; The Resolutions were the joint production of different persons&#44; 
and so appear in the pamplilct containing the transactions of the 
meeting. Several other resolutions adopted are omitted here as 
containing nothing of a permanent character. 

It is to be remarked&#44; that the first report of the woalth of the 
Israelites at Damascus is said to have been much exaggerated&#44; and 
they are&#44; as we have been informed since the meeting&#44; poor in every

respect&#44; with few exceptions only &#59; but it would also seem that these 
very persons were selected as the objects of persecution&#44; together 
with a few who held a high station for learning and influence. It 
is also reported that actually expired under the tortures which 
they had to suffer. 

&#91;At the above meeting&#44; several Christian clergjinen also spoke&#44; 
and expressed their admiration for Israel&#44; and their sympathy for 
the sufferers. &#34;We would specify Rev. Dr. H. W. Ducachet&#44; of the 
Episcopal&#44; and Rev. William Eamsey&#44; of the Presbyterian church&#44; 
both of whom have departed this life&#44; since this was first printed. 
A change has since taken place in Palestine&#44; and&#8211;it is to be hoped 
that such scenes as above described&#44; may never occur again in the 
land of Israel&#44; or the countries bordering on it&#44; which were promised 
to us as our proper dominion. &#8212; June&#44; &#39;37.&#93;

And O our Father &#33; teach us to feel our nothingness&#44;

grace to look upon this life as a pilgrimage to thy 
blissful dwelling&#59; in order that when blessed with 
worldly goods we may look upon them as means for 
our happiness&#44; not as our destined happiness&#59; means 
given by thy favour only&#44; to be taken back when in 
thy wisdom Thou deemest us no longer worthy of 
enjoying them. Teach us to regard such wealth as 
belonging entirely to Thee&#44; so that we may conquer 
our unholy desire for worldly possessions and devote 
a part of our substance to thy service&#44; &#34;inasmuch as 
from Thee is all&#44; and we give only unto Thee what 
thy bounty hath bestowed on us.&#34; &#8212; But also if Thou 
hast decreed that we should labour in vain&#44; if Thou 
hast withholden thy blessing from the work of our 
hands &#58; inspire us with fortitude to be resigned to thy 
will&#44; and guard us from a rebellious spirit which 
would fain mislead us from the path marked out for 
us by thy wisdom. And also if bodily suifering is 
apportioned to us&#44; let thy goodness be our shield&#59; 
that even whilst the body is tortured by pain&#44; and our

ger&#44; and thy custom is to have compassion upon thy 
creatures who return unto Thee with a repentant 
spirit. Have mercy then on Israel thy people and on 
Jerusalem thy city on which thy name is called &#59; and 
send salvation into the world through him whom 
Thou wilt send as the harbinger of peace&#44; even the 
anointed&#44; the son of David&#44; and Elijah the angel of 
the covenant. &#34;And may the beauty of the Lord 
our God be upon us&#59; and establish Thou the work of 
our hands upon us &#59; yea&#44; the work of our hands es&#8211; 
tablish Thou it.&#34; May this be thy will&#44; O our Father 
and King &#33; from now unto everlasting. Amen.

SECOND ANNUAL EXAMINATION 

OF THE 

SUNDAY SCHOOL&#44;

HELD VEADAR 24&#44; 0600&#8212; MARCH 29&#44; 1840&#44; 
AT THE SYNAGOGUE MIKVE ISRAEL. 



May thy name&#44; O Lord our God &#33; be praised unto 
everlasting&#44; even from eternity to eternity&#59; for Thine 
is the glory and the power&#44; and thy providence 
watches over all the beings whom thy word has 
created. Wherever we turn&#44; we behold the works 
of thy goodness&#44; the doings of thy beneficence&#59; and 
life&#44; and health&#44; and wisdom&#44; and light are all gifts 
which proceed from Thee solely. For who is with 
Thee in heaven &#63; and who is near Thee on earth &#63; 
Above&#44; Thou reignest alone&#44; there is no second to 
share the rule with Thee&#44; omnipotent Fiither &#33; and 
on earth all are thy creatures&#44; all the works of thy 
own hands. There is no saviour without Thee &#59; for 
when Thou woundest&#44; who shall heal &#63; if Thou sniit&#8211; 
est&#44; who can save from thy power &#63; and if thy wrath 
is enkindled&#44; who shall appease Thee&#44; save it be that 
thy mercy forgives the repentant sinner&#63; It is to

PRAYER. 371 

Thee&#44; therefore&#44; that we call in our distress &#59; to Thee&#44; 
therefore&#44; we pray &#59; to Thee&#44; therefore&#44; we bend the 
knee. O&#44; that all flesh might like us be taught to 
revere Thee alone &#33; 0&#44; that all Israel might be made 
of one heart&#44; and one spirit&#44; to serve Thee in truth 
and sincerity &#33; 

The heavens and the heavens of heavens cannot 
contain Thee&#44; for all have sprung from Thee&#59; all is 
sustained by thy might&#59; all lives only with and 
through Thee. Yet Thou hast ever deigned to fix 
thy dwelling in the midst of thy servants&#44; and from 
the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou hast founded 
thy mighty works &#59; the deeds done by the innocent&#44; 
the words of purity flowing from their mouth are to 
Thee agreeable savour&#59; and Thou delightest in the 
offering of prayer which the humble sacrifice unto 
Thee&#44; O our Saviour &#33; Behold us then this day as&#8211; 
sembled in this house which has been built for thy 
worship&#44; with our children&#44; our sons and daughters&#44; 
whom thy servants endeavour to rear up to know and 
to fear Thee all the days they may live on earth&#44; and 
to instruct them in the law of thy will which Thou 
gavest unto our forefathers in the days of yore&#44; when 
they beheld thy glory&#44; saw thy consuming fire&#44; and 
heard thy potent voice. How shall we thank Thee&#63; 
how shall we praise Thee&#44; for this boon which Thou 
didst so graciously bestow on us&#44; by which Thou 
hast separated us from the heathen&#44; and brought us 
near unto thy service to fear thy name&#44; and to be the 
witnesses of thy glory &#63; In all our wanderings it has 
been our stay&#44; amidst all our sorrows it has been our 
support&#59; and unto this day we are sustained through 
it as a people distinct and separate from the other

nations of the earth. We humbly confess&#44; that it is 
not our wisdom and our knowledge that have done 
this&#44; but the wisdom and the knowledge which Thou 
didst impart unto us through the hands of thy servant 
Moses&#44; the chosen messenger of thy goodness. We 
therefore implore Thee&#44; Lord our God&#44; and God 
of our fathers&#33; to strengthen us in our striving to 
I&#41;romulgate the knowledge of thy word&#59; to instil 
into us&#44; and all those engaged in teaching the pre&#8211; 
cepts of thy code&#44; persuasive wisdom&#44; and eloquence 
of speech&#44; that our words may sink deep into the 
hearts of all those who come to learn&#44; that the seed 
which is planted mid labour and sorrow may produce 
fruits of holiness and devotion&#44; promoting adoration 
of Thee&#44; the only God&#44; and love to our fellow&#8211;men&#44; 
who&#44; like us&#44; have received a living soul and a feeliug 
heart. 

May it also be thy will&#44; to receive in favour this 
endeavour of the daughters of Israel in this and other 
cities&#44; to found institutions for the spread of godli&#8211; 
ness&#59; prosper their work&#44; forward their enterprise&#44; 
and grant that whilst blessing they may be blest&#59; 
that whilst teaching they may learn &#59; that whilst puri&#8211; 
fying they may be purilied&#44; and brought to a knowl&#8211; 
edge of the good&#44; and be led to follow that path of 
righteousness and truth which leads to everlasting 
happiness. May many be induced to imitate their 
example &#59; may their reward be a multitude of disci&#8211; 
ples&#44; freed from the bonds of unbelief&#44; armed with 
the knowledge of truth&#44; that they may be able to 
withstand the attacks of those who love not Israel&#44; 
and who would gladly wean them from the observ&#8211; 
ance of thy precepts.

PRAYER. 373 

Eut what are we&#44; that we have been brought hither&#63; 
what is our life &#63; what is our righteousness &#63; A day 
passes&#44; and we are cut off&#59; Thou hidest thy face&#44; and 
we perish&#59; in the midst of our devotion our thoughts 
often wander&#59; and whilst worshipping&#44; our mind is 
turned towards gain and vanities of this life. All 
the benefits we receive from Thee are undeserved by 
us&#59; thy bounty is extended to thy children&#44; but they 
merit it not. Miracles have been wrought in our 
support&#59; unheard&#8211;of deeds have been displayed that 
we might be preserved&#44; but not because of our right&#8211; 
eousness&#44; but only because of thy mercy&#44; which is 
unending. Ere we prayed&#44; Thou ever didst answer&#59; 
before our thoughts were uttered&#44; Thou didst hear&#59; 
and when affliction&#39;s waves threatened to overwhelm 
us&#44; thy power stayed the destructive current&#44; and we 
received enlargement. We therefore throw ourselves 
humbly upon the continuance of thy mercy&#59; guard 
us&#44; as Thou wert wont to guard&#59; shield us as Thou 
ever didst shield&#59; preserve unto us the knowledge of 
thy law&#44; and cause its precepts to speak a language 
which may find a response in the heart of every son 
of man&#44; and especially of all these young charges&#44; 
whom thy servants have assembled together in thy 
house&#44; and endeavour to lead unto the footstool of 
thy greatness. Multiply the teachers&#44; strengthen 
them in their effort&#44; and let their reward be&#44; that the 
good they now do may produce a plentiful harvest of 
righteousness and truth. 
And upon thy servant&#44;&#42; Avho&#44; by Thee permitted&#44;

has Bpokcu of thy goodness and thy law in the dis&#8211; 
tant isle of the sea&#44; where they&#44; who&#44; like us&#44; call on 
thy unity&#44; have reared houses for thy service&#44; do 
Thou shed thy grace and truth&#44; and cause us to be 
instructed and to profit by the words he will address 
to us. Arm his tongue with persuasiveness&#44; that we 
all may leave this house to&#8211;day improved and better

of Jacob his companion&#44; in restored health&#44; in re&#8211; 
newed vigour&#44; and increased usefulness. 

Father of all &#33; we farther pray Thee&#44; to let thy 
countenance shine unto us&#44; and unto all Israel&#59; and 
shield us by the shadow of thy wings from the many 
calamities we are subject to&#44; because that we are flesh. 
Strengthen us&#44; that when in health&#44; we may overcome 
the evil of our inclinations&#44; and that&#44; when our body 
is racked by pain&#44; we may be prepared to resign 
cheerfully our spirit into thy hands&#44; O our King &#33; 
Let thy grace and thy holy spirit be ever with us &#59; 
remember the captivity of Jacob&#44; and forsake not 
the outcasts of Israel&#44; and sufler not the gentiles to 
devour them&#44; lest they say&#44; Where is their God&#63; 
Preserve unto us also the blessing of freedom which 
we enjoy in this land&#44; and grant that a spirit of pure 
benevolence may become universal toward thy peo&#8211; 
ple in every country of their dispersion. But above 
all&#44; fulfil unto us the promise made to us through 

sentod to address the congregation and children upon the above
