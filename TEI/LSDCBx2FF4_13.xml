				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>Montreal</placeName> <date>19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Feb. 5617</date>.</p>
				<p><addressee>Rev Isaac Leeser</addressee></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><placeName>Philadelphia</placeName></p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">Dear Sir&#44;</p>
			<p rend="indent(3)">I have had no time to notice yours<lb/> of <date>1<hi rend="sup">st</hi></date> ult till now.  There are one or two remarks I think it<lb/> right to make.  You seem to be under the impression that I<lb/> required a public apology from you in the matter of the <placeName>Phila</placeName><lb/> election and the article you wrote about my testimonials.<lb/>  But this is wrong.  As you write so do I.  I was and am willing<lb/> to drop it.  If you have my last letter&#44; refer to it&#44; you will find<lb/> I say &#8220;let this pass&#8221;  I merely required that did I write for the<lb/> Advocate or any other publication edited by you you should<lb/> make the amende honorable for your <hi rend="underline">short</hi> &#40;as you <add>&#63;</add><lb/> criticize of <persName>Pennoch</persName> by indirectly &#40;I believe this was the term<lb/> employed&#41; recalling your charge&#8212;expressed or implied&#8212;no matter<lb/> which&#8212;in said critique&#8212;that I was not <add>&#63;</add> safe &#38; etc.  This<lb/> was all &#38; it surely was not asking much for your industrious<lb/> and unsparing dissection of the Catechism.  About remuneration<lb/> there will be no difficulty&#8212;you revert again to the election at <placeName>Phila</placeName><lb/> and say &#40;I make a few comments en parenthese&#41; you have it<lb/> in your power to prove that your interference with me &#91;I<lb/> never interfered with you&#93; was owing to letters recd from <placeName>Phil</placeName><lb/> &#91;I <hi rend="underline">have</hi> letters to prove that ll<add>&#63;</add> your friends justified my <add>&#63;</add><lb/> ministers included&#8212;though same were with you <add>Hebrew</add>&#93;<lb/> &#8220;Why not do so&#63;  You continue&#44; send on the letters you owe the<lb/> scamps that deceived you no favor &#91;Cui bono&#63;  I was near showing<lb/> you the letters when you were here but I took the second and</p>

				<p>better thought why should not my word be sufficient&#63;  Why embitter<lb/> <persName>Mr L.</persName> <del>still</del> more against them&#44; they against him by raking up old<lb/> grievances.  No&#33;  <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> will one day be <add>&#63;</add> and find that<lb/> <persName role="author">A.D.S.</persName> Is not so black as he paints him&#93; &#8220;and no principle of<lb/> honor can bind you in respect to them.  Here again I take a<lb/> leaf out of your own book and say I cannot allow any one<lb/> to dictate to me the code of honor.  It is as accessible to me as<lb/> to others&#44; and having equal right to put my own interpretation<lb/> on its requirements&#44; I always have done so and intend please<lb/> God always yet to do so.  What you write about my editing<lb/> a periodical connecting myself with <persName>Dr. R.L</persName> <persName>Dr L L.</persName> &#40;By the<lb/> way <add>&#63;</add> made the latter a Dr I thought he was only Mr&#41;<lb/> in publishing&#8212;a thing I never contemplated yet&#8212;your cautious<lb/> about looking out carefully&#8212;uncertainty <add>&#63;</add> profit&#8212;estimate<lb/> of popularity&#8212;inconvenience of losing money&#8212;to all these <add>&#63;</add><lb/> I do not deem it necessary to reply.  If I desired to publish a<lb/> magazine tomorrow I do not see why I should stop to ask <persName>Messrs<lb/> Lyons</persName> <persName>Wise</persName> &#38; <persName>Isaacs</persName> their consent more than any good Christian<lb/> would ask leave of any brother respected in the flesh.  You would<lb/> not require me to ask you&#44; for you say so.  I notice your advice<lb/> not to <hi rend="underline">attack</hi> you should I edit or assist in editing this<lb/> imaginary paper.  Why should I do this even in the land of dreams<lb/> without <add>&#63;</add> I may say that when I <add>&#63;</add> provocation<lb/> enough&#44; I feel courage enough to attack any one and defend<lb/> myself from any one&#44; though they be the giants&#44; &#38; I the <sic>pigmy</sic>.<lb/>  But seriously&#44; what is the use our exchanging letters all<lb/> about visionary nothings&#44; and old old topics.  Let them<lb/> go to the tomb of all the 6 amulets  In future I promise I shall<lb/> be more business like when I shall have occasion to write<lb/> you.  In writing upon other topics you forgot<lb/> to say the list for the Advocate came to hand.  This list</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>however small&#44; would not show I had any idea of <hi rend="underline">warring</hi><lb/> with you.  If I mistake you&#44; you also mistake me.  I<lb/> patiently assure you I am no covert enemy of yours&#59; but I<lb/> do not write on the orthodox side to please you&#8212;God forbid<lb/> and if I wished to enter into a disagreeable topic I would call<lb/> offensive that part of your letter wherein you <sic>advise</sic> me not to<lb/> write for the Israelite or Asmonean.  &#8220;I would not have your<lb/> enemies&#8221; hear of such advice&#44; and i must again say that I<lb/> am convicted enough to use my own judgment in this matter.<lb/>  My father never advised me thus much&#44; simply because he<lb/> has a better opinion of me than you seem to have or perhaps<lb/> than your letters imply.  But you cannot put me out of<lb/> conceit with you.  I do not easily throw aside old acquaintances<lb/> Your last was written in a very bitter spirit and in any one<lb/> else I should have treated it as a piece of very great impertinence<lb/> but I have never lost for you feelings of true respect and regard<lb/> even in our most inimical moments&#8212;even when you have<lb/> been most surly and ill&#45;humored&#44; and I the model of<lb/> patience and consideration thought you had treated me<lb/> harshly and ungenerously&#44; for I have always accepted as<lb/> true your assurance that if in your labors you have had<lb/> successes you have had more disappointments &#38; unpleasantness<lb/>&#8212;I was truly sorry to notice your announcement of a fire again in<lb/> the bindery&#8212;I trust you are no loser.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In conclusion please notice what it was I<lb/> really required of you in my last and how very easily my<lb/> injured honor would be satisfied and sullied reputation<lb/> restored to its pristine purity &#38; brilliancy by you&#44; should<lb/> it be deemed desirable by either of us to write in any</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>enterprise.  Trusting that from this day forward<lb/> somos buenos amigos <add>Hebrew</add> sine el <add>Hebrew</add> les otras dias</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">I remain as ever yours truly</p>
			<p rend="indent(3)"><persName role="author">Abraham de Sola</persName></p>
				<p>Oblige me by handing the<lb/> enclosed to <persName>Miss Gratz.</persName>  If not<lb/> troubling you too much I would<lb/> prefer your giving it yourself<lb/> rather than sending.</p>
