				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>New Orleans</placeName> <date>October 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi>&#47;63</date>.</p>
				<p>To <addressee>Revd. Isaac Lesser</addressee></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Editor &#8220;Occident&#8221;</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)"><placeName>Philadelphia</placeName></p>
				<p>Revd. Sir&#33;</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">Excuse my giving vent to painful feeling<lb/> which I can not restrain any longer.  Can a son be silent<lb/> when he sees his father slighted by one whose respect and<lb/> admiration he deserves&#63;  Remember Revd Sir&#44; how often<lb/> my venerable father appeared before the bar of public<lb/> opinion to advocate and defend you against the rude at&#61;<lb/>tacks of <persName>Dr. Wise</persName> &#38; Co.&#33;  Remember how often<lb/> my father proclaimed you in all the Jewish periodicals<lb/> as the only faithful advocate of true Judaism&#44; as the<lb/> restorer of our Religion and Gonfalonier<add>&#63;</add> of truth in this<lb/> country&#33;  But you have not a single word to say in<lb/> his favor&#44; when his enemies try to slander him by false<lb/> and unfounded reports.  You asked some time ago&#44; for the<lb/> reasons of his leaving <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>&#44; and I gave you<lb/> pure wine&#44; the pure truth&#44; without the least admixture<lb/> of untruth&#58; what did you however write about it&#63;  You only<lb/> heaped slander upon slander&#59; you wrote&#44; &#8220;you received a<lb/> communication in favor of <persName>Dr. Illowy</persName>&#44; but you have no<lb/> trust in it&#8221;&#44; this is the essence&#44; if not the words of your<lb/> report.  You have no trust in my father&#39;s good character&#44; &#40;may<lb/> I presume Revd Sir to inquire&#44; what is the cause of this doubt&#41;<lb/> though you had already been informed by the Secretary of<lb/> the Cong in <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName>&#44; that in spite of the malicious report</p>
			<pb n="1V"/>
				<p>published in the Deborah&#44; my father was unanimously&#44; not one<lb/> voice dissenting&#44; elected&#44; and not by vote but by acclamation.<lb/>  Why not one voice against him&#63;  Why so most honorably elected&#44;<lb/> Because the people in <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName> heard from most trustworthy<lb/> men from <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>&#44; that my father resigned his situa&#61;<lb/>tion for the only reason&#44; that he would not sell his conscience<lb/> for money.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">You read the remarks of <persName>Revd. Isaacs</persName>&#59; still you<lb/> doubted.  It was not unknown to you that the friends of my<lb/> father in <placeName>New Orleans</placeName> had presented him when leaving this<lb/> City with a most costly silver pitcher and waiter&#59; still you<lb/> doubted&#44; ignoring all these evidences.  You know my father<lb/> since fifteen years&#44; you know him firm as a rock&#59; he never<lb/> changed or altered his principles from fear of losing or for the<lb/> sake of making money as your friends in <placeName>Hartford</placeName>&#44;<lb/> <placeName>Rochester</placeName> and other places have done.  No&#33;  My father<lb/> fears nothing&#44; he has his trust in God&#44; and when he trust&#61;<lb/>fully gave up his situation and my Dear mother lamented what<lb/> will we do now&#44; he said with <persName>King David</persName> <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Your remarks in the last number of the Occident did<lb/> not hurt neither me &#40;though I felt bad&#41; nor my honored fa&#61;<lb/>ther&#59; thank God&#44; he stands above the level of all his enemies<lb/> neither did they give you any credit for them<lb/> your best friends<lb/> blamed you and laughed at you saying&#58; &#8220;<persName>Mr <sic>Lesser</sic></persName> is afraid<lb/> of spoiling his game with either party&#44; especially with <persName>Gutheim</persName><lb/> though he is an <add>Hebrew</add>&#59; would <persName><sic>Lesser</sic></persName> be with twenty<lb/> years younger he would yet become the advocate of reform.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Let me ask you <persName>Mr<sic> Lesser</sic></persName>&#44; you congratulated <placeName>Hartford</placeName></p>
			<pb n="2R"/>
				<p>to the successful election of mayor&#44; <placeName>Rochester</placeName> of <persName>Grinsburg<add>&#63;</add></persName><lb/> <placeName>St Louis</placeName> of <persName>Vidaver</persName>&#44; though you know all these formen<lb/> well&#44; that they are men <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>&#59; still you flattered these men&#44; promised the world a<lb/> great future which <sic>judaism</sic> had to expect from them&#44; and<lb/> how much good the respective congregations will derive from<lb/> the activity of these Rabbis.  You knew <persName>Vidaver</persName> better<lb/> than any man in <placeName>St. Louis</placeName>&#44; still you recommended him<lb/> as an <add>Hebrew</add>.  He is a strict <hi rend="underline">orthodox</hi><lb/> You had to advocate him.  Send your ears to <placeName>St. Louis</placeName> and<lb/> you will hear what he is&#59; a religion maker and a <add>Hebrew</add> he was<lb/> long ago for he fulfilled the word <add>Hebrew</add>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">How much had you to say and how much good did you promise<lb/> that the Cong. of <placeName>San Francisco</placeName> had to expect&#44; when they elected<lb/> <persName>Cohen</persName>&#44; who was well known as a <add>Hebrew</add>&#59; but you<lb/> had nothing&#44; not a single word to say when <persName>Dr. Illowy</persName> was elected<lb/> by the Cong. in <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName>&#44; and not alone that&#44; but in the secretary&#39;s<lb/> report published in your paper&#44; you malignantly left out the word<lb/> <hi rend="underline">&#8220;unanimously&#8221;</hi>.  You will find it in the &#8220;Messenger and Israelite&#44;&#8221;<lb/> and your remark on an other page was more slander than praise&#44;<lb/> it was such a praise as slanders bestow&#44; <add>Hebrew</add></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Thank God my father is too well known in the old and<lb/> new word as to stand in need of the praise of <hi rend="underline">any</hi> american<lb/> journalist.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Yes my dear Sir&#44; if you had something to say against my<lb/> father&#44; you would be immediately at hand to condemn him or to<lb/> kindle the flame of discord against him.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">When my father had the courage to declare a rich <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> you forgot yourself and dared set up your <sic>judgement</sic> against him.</p>
			<pb n="2V"/>
				<p>Still my father did not use the expression which <persName>Wise</persName><lb/> used several times against you and <persName>Isaacs</persName>&#59; my father is too<lb/> pious&#44; too honorable and too much of a gentleman.  It was<lb/> satisfaction enough for him if five <hi rend="underline">learned</hi> <sic>Rabbies</sic>&#44; the<lb/> greatest men in&#44; and the lights of&#44; <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; <persName>Seligman Bamberger</persName><lb/> of <placeName>W&#252;rzburg</placeName>&#44; <persName>Dr Hinsch</persName>&#44; <placeName><sic>Franfort</sic></placeName>&#44; <persName>Dr Lehman</persName> <placeName>Mainz</placeName><lb/> <persName>Dr Tilchenfeld</persName> <placeName>D&#252;sseldorf</placeName>&#44; and <persName>Dr Hildesheimer</persName> <placeName>Eisenstadt</placeName><lb/> all of them&#44; like one voice&#44; came out spontaneously&#44; without being<lb/> called upon&#44; and approved the action of my father in the most<lb/> laudable terms.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">When my father wrote against the manufactory of <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; who<lb/> dared come out against him&#44; with argument founded not upon<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; but upon &#8220;COMMON SENSE&#8221;&#8212;<persName>Isaac Lesser</persName>&#8221;.  Just as<lb/> if my father would be a thorn in your eye because he can say<lb/> with <persName>Elijah</persName> <add>Hebrew</add>&#59; because he is the only Ortho&#61;<lb/>dox <sic>Rabby</sic> in this country you would like to see him pushed<lb/> aside.  Oh&#33; great righteousness&#33;&#8212;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Believe me Sir&#44; that I am convinced that my worthy<lb/> father whom I expect home every day would not approve of<lb/> my letter&#44; for when he sent you just before leaving <placeName>N. O.</placeName><lb/> your &#36;20.00&#44; I told him to write you the cause of his<lb/> leaving <placeName>N. O.</placeName> since you once remarked that you would like<lb/> to know it&#44; he answered&#44; I do not wish to be heralded as <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> let the world think every one just as he pleases.  I however<lb/> can not see the man&#44; who pretends to be <add>the</add> advocate&#44; the champion<lb/> of Orthodoxy&#44; play a false game&#44; recommend <add>Hebrew</add> to orthodox<lb/> Congs. As if you would not know them better.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">How great was your joy and hope when <persName>Cohen</persName> went to<lb/> <placeName>San Francisco</placeName>&#44; but you are stricken with blindness and deafness</p>
			<pb n="3R"/>
				<p>when you should come out with the truth.  I confess it&#44; that when<lb/> my father wrote us last week from <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName>&#59; that <persName>Dr. Wise</persName>&#44;<lb/> when seeing that the people in <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName> rush from all the Synagogues<lb/> to hear him and that the crowd in his synagogue is so great every<lb/> <date>Sabbath</date> that many must remain in the vestibule for want of room<lb/> within<del>g</del> and that his &#40;<persName>Wise&#39;s</persName>&#41; reports were declared&#44; by the most respectable<lb/> men of this city who passed through there&#44; as contrary to the truth<lb/> he began to make friendship with him and invited him to assist him<lb/> &#40;<persName>Dr. Wise</persName>&#41; in performing the marriage ceremonies at the wedding of his<lb/> daughter which will take place on the <date>1st.</date> inst. and which invitation<lb/> was accepted by my father should he be present in <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName>&#44; that<lb/> I thought at first of bringing this letter to your notice through<lb/> the columns of the Israelite&#44; but knowing that my father would<lb/> disapprove it&#44; for he never likes to come out publicly against any one&#44;<lb/> if it is only <add>Hebrew</add> and not for the sake of religion&#44; therefore<lb/> I took this method and speak to you like man to man.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Hoping that you may be able to answer satisfactorily<lb/> all these questions</p>
			<p rend="indent(9)">I remain Revd Sir</p>
			<p rend="indent(9)">your most obedient Servt.</p>
