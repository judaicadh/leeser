DISCOUESE XXIX. 

THE DUTY OF INSTRUCTION. 

O Thou&#44; who appointest to each man a destiny of 
good or evil as his ways may deserve&#44; and who art 
ever ready to annul the evil decree&#44; when the sinner 
returneth unto Thee with prayer and sincerity&#44; re&#8211; 
ceive now&#44; at this season of forgiveness of sin&#44; the 
supplications which we&#44; thy people Israel&#44; address to 
Thee in the countries of our captivity&#59; and may our 
prayer be acceptable before Thee&#44; as was the sac&#8211; 
rifice without blemish which was formerly brought to 
thy temple as an atonement for the transgressions of 
thy congregation. save us from evil &#33; protect 
us from the contumely of the ungodly and the perse&#8211; 
cutions of the strangers to thy holy creed &#59; and let thy 
grace be displayed over us&#44; so that all inhabitants of 
the earth may see&#44; that in truth we are called by thy 
name. May this be thy will. Amen.

2 THE DUTY OF INSTRUCTION. 

Brethren &#33; 

Again by the favour of God we are permitted to as&#8211; 
semble in this house of prayer&#44; and to anticipate the 
approach of another Day of Atonement. To many 
of us new joys may have been dispensed in the year 
which has elapsed &#59; but many have had to drink the 
cup of sorrow. Weal and wo have&#44; as usual&#44; chased 
each other in their circuit round our globe &#59; and&#44; per&#8211; 
haps&#44; the distressed one has been gladdened by an 
unexpected enlargement&#44; and the proud and he who 
conceived himself secure and firmly seated have been 
moved&#44; and their grandeur rendered to naught&#44; and 
their security been turned into tribulation. The pic&#8211; 
ture here presented is an occurrence of every day of 
our life &#59; but its instructiveness is not in the least dimin&#8211; 
ished by its frequency. To him who does not take 
heed of what passes&#44; the subversion of a world would 
hardly be more than a natural phenomenon &#59; but to 
the mind alive to religious impression every event 
speaks of the unerring wisdom of God&#44; which orders 
every thing for the wisest of purposes. To a mind so 
constituted nothing can pass unheeded &#59; and from the 
evil no less than the good&#44; instruction and improve&#8211; 
ment will flow unto him&#44; since he always considers&#44; 
that the hand of the Lord has done it. Even should 
he himself be the object&#44; against whom the divine 
judgment is directed&#44; it will cause him to reflect and 
ponder&#44; and consequently to correct the defectiveness 
of his course&#44; and thus it may truly be said&#44; that to 
the wise and riHiteous lisrht will beam out of dark&#8211; 
ness &#33; But the thoughtless will receive the greatest 
blessings as a matter of course&#44; and whatever of pun&#8211; 
ishment he may meet with&#44; he will either regard as a

it by without bestowing a thought upon it. &#8212; And be&#8211; 
hold the difference &#33; The righteous is meek in pros&#8211; 
perity and&#44; however exalted&#44; he sees a brother in the 
humblest of beings &#59; and in adversity he meekly bends 
to the rod which is sent to chastise him&#59; but the 
thoughtless transgressor is insolent in prosperity&#44; and 
when he suffers he vents his wrath in imprecations 
and ill&#8211;humor&#44; as though the Judge of all flesh could 
be driven to remove merited punishment by the way&#8211; 
wardness of the obdurate child. &#8212; It requires but little 
penetration to distinguish between the better and the 
worse of these two principles of action&#44; since our life 
is so constantly diversified by good and evil&#44; by re&#8211; 
ward and punishment. But&#44; alas &#33; the thinking ones 
are the smaller portion of mankind&#44; heedlessness and 
obstinacy are too often characterized as cheerfulness 
and firmness&#44; and hence we see so little reformation 
produced by causes&#44; which any disinterested witness 
would consider sufiB.ciently powerful to call forth se&#8211; 
rious reflection. Thus it happens&#44; that the chastise&#8211; 
ments which God sends&#44; as our holy writings teach 
us&#44; to warn us of our errors&#44; but too often fail to have 
the good effect for which they are intended. &#8212; The All&#8211; 
mighty&#44; therefore&#44; knowing the weakness of human 
nature&#44; and also aware how much one man is apt to 
be influenced by the words and deeds of the other&#44; 
and how much the cares of life tend to claim almost 
the whole attention&#44; to the exclusion of every thing 
else&#44; of each mortal&#44; has set apart a portion of every 
year as a peculiar time for reflection and repentance&#44; 
to fix&#44; as it were&#44; more emphatically the wavering 
fancy &#59; to assemble all believers to unite by words and

acts in devotion and repentance&#44; and to make this shoii&#59; 
period dedicated to the pursuit of penitence and of 
righteousness as our principal occupation. And well 
is this time chosen. For when we were the Israelites 
of Palestine&#44; not given as now to trading and money&#8211; 
hunting as our chief pursuit&#44; hut to manual labor and 
jjgriculture&#44; the beginning of the civil year was just 
the period of all the most congenial to piety. Behold &#33; 
every man had finished his work in the field&#44; his crop 
of grain and fruit had been housed&#44; and liis efforts 
blessed by the bounteous hand of God. If ever man 
can feel grateful&#44; it is surely the time when he has 
ample cause to be so &#59; and if ever he should feel re&#8211; 
pentance&#44; it is when he has felt the evil effects of 
transgression. And as our land was always fruitful 
when we were righteous&#44; and as punishment univer&#8211; 
sally followed transgression &#58; every one could easily 
feel&#44; often even by the result of his harvest&#44; if his and 
his neighbors&#39; conduct had been in the spirit of god&#8211; 
liness or not &#8212;; Then again&#44; it is the beginning of our 
year &#59; and&#44; therefore&#44; it was proper then&#44; and is no less 
so now&#44; to begin a new period with extraordinary acts 
of devotion&#44; and to repent&#44; even if we should not be 
conscious of any aggravated sin in ourselves&#44; of 
wrongs committed unwittingly&#44; and of faults into 
which we may have misled others by unkindness of 
manner&#44; or by indiscreet advice. It is&#44; therefore&#44; in&#8211; 
cumbent on us&#44; so our wise and blessed teachers tell 
us&#44; to pacify our offended neighbour before the Day 
of Atonement comes&#44; so that he may not stand with 
aggrieved feelings of bitterness towards us&#44; when he 
comes to ask forgiveness for his own sins&#59; and to those 
who have the capacity&#44; it is commanded to exhort the

bretliren on this Sabbath of Repentance to a contrition 
of hearts&#44; and a firm purpose to amend whatever of 
fault&#44; stubbornness&#44; and waywardness they may dis&#8211; 
cover in themselves. And on this subject&#44; we read 
the following in the book of Ezekiel &#40;chap&#44; xxxiii.&#41; &#58; 
&#34;And the word of the Lord came unto me as fol&#8211; 
loweth &#58; Son of man&#44; say unto the children of thy peo&#8211; 
ple and speak unto them&#44; A land&#44; when I bring over it 
the sword &#59; and the people of the land take one man 
from amongst them&#44; and appoint him as their sentinel &#59; 
and when he seeth the sword coming over the land&#44; 
and he bloweth the cornet&#44; and warneth the people &#59; 
and if the hearer heareth the voice of the cornet and 
is not warned&#44; and the sword cometh and taketh him 
off&#58; his blood shall be on his own head &#8212; the voice 
of the cornet he hath heard and he hath not taken 
warning&#59; his blood shall be upon liimself&#59; for he was 
warned and could have saved his life. But if the sen&#8211; 
tinel see the sword coming&#44; and he blow not the cor&#8211; 
net&#44; and the people be not warned&#44; and the sword 
cometh and taketh one of them &#58; he hath been taken 
away for his iniquity&#44; and his blood I will require of 
the sentinel.&#34; &#8212; And thus continues the prophecy&#58; 


&#34;And thou son of man&#33; I have appointed thee a sentinel for the 
house of Israel&#44; and when thou hearest a word out of my mouth&#44; 

1&#42; 

<pb n="6"/>

thou shalt warn them from me. When I say of the wicked&#44; &#34;Wicked 
one&#44; thou shalt die&#59; and thou speakest not to warn the wicked from 
his way&#44; this wielded one shall die for his iniquity&#44; and his blood 
from thy hand I will require. But thou&#44; when thou hast fore&#8211; 
warned the wicked from his way&#44; to return therefrom&#44; and he do 
not return from his way &#58; he for his iniquity shall die&#44; but thou 
hast saved thy soul.&#34; xxxiii. 7&#8211;9. 

In the extract here presented to your consideration&#44; 
brethren &#33; you will see&#44; that the duty to admonish 
others is one solemnly enjoined by God in his com&#8211; 
mands to his prophet. It is true&#44; that the holy spirit 
is no longer displayed over the messengers of the Al&#8211; 
mighty&#44; as palpably as it was in olden times&#59; but the 
effects of the spirit&#44; which was formerly poured out&#44; 
are yet in existence&#44; for the promulgated word is still 
in our hands&#44; in our mouths&#44; and in our hearts&#59; and 
thus the command issued to Ezekiel to forewarn the 
sinner is yet operative even at this very day. In 
pursuance of this duty&#44; I address you now&#44; since un&#8211; 
worthy as I am&#44; I occupy for the moment the place 
of teacher in the community &#44; noone is more con&#8211; 
scious than myself&#44; that my own course is not faultless&#59; 
no one need tell me to take the beam from between 
my eyes &#59; since I never would arrogate to myself the 
idea of perfection &#59; but only as one brother exhorts 
the other to reflection do I wish to be viewed&#44; as one 
of the people&#44; guilty of the same derelictions&#44; and 
actuated by the same sinful propensities&#44; who himself 
derives instruction and correction through those la&#8211; 
bours by which he endeavors to benefit others. To 
adopt the simile of the prophet &#58; the sentinel is not 
the less threatened by the sword&#44; nor the less menaced 
by dangers&#44; because he stands upon a tower to dis&#8211;

cover the danger at a distance&#44; and because he has 
the cornet by his side to forewarn the townsmen of 
the approaching destruction. &#8212; Brethren &#33; we all have 
sinned &#59; and but rarely are we able to say with truth&#44; 
that one entire day has passed over our heads&#44; which 
we have employed in doing all the good we could&#44; and 
avoiding all the evil which was avoidable. We have&#44; 
perhaps&#44; neglected to make ourselves acquainted with 
our duties&#59; and our ignorance&#44; through which we sin&#44; 
has been a voluntary one&#59; and we cannot claim an 
exemption from punishment by the plea of good in&#8211; 
tentions&#44; and the not knowing of the hurtfulness of 
our doings. &#8212; Or perhaps we have haply discovered 
our faults&#44; and have resolved to amend &#59; but this de&#8211; 
termination has been deferred from day to day&#44; and 
we are as bad as we were last year and the year be&#8211; 
fore the last. &#8212; Seeing our misconduct&#44; we may have 
thrown the cloak of hypocrisy&#44; or the veil of extenu&#8211; 
ation over it&#59; we may have considered our aberra&#8211; 
tions as unimportant&#44; and which the Almighty would 
not notice &#59; in short&#44; we may have done every thing 
in our power to fancy ourselves good and virtuous 
without our being so&#44; and consequently have perse&#8211; 
vered in a course which ouij&#8211;ht to have been aban&#8211; 
doned&#59; andiiave even wondered&#44; to use the language 
of Isaiah &#58; &#34;Why have we fasted and God hath not 
seen&#44; why have we afflicted our souls and He knoweth 
it not&#61;&#34; But it is entire blindness which causes us to&#39; 
argue in this manner&#44; ay&#44; a voluntary one even&#44; for 
we might have reasoned better if we had taken proper 
means to form a better judgment. We speak of our 
righteousness &#8212; of our resignation &#8212; of our humility &#8212; 
of our charities&#59; but we imagine vainly&#44; that by prac&#8211;

tising a few virtues&#44; we have exhausted the whole 
series of good deeds &#33; Fatal self&#8211;delusion &#33; Even 
granted that we have ourselves done every thing re&#8211; 
lating to our persons &#58; have we&#44; I ask&#44; done all in re&#8211; 
lation to others &#61; Have we made virtue estimable &#61; 
have we espoused the cause of righteousness when 
we heard it assailed &#61; have we placed ourselves for&#8211; 
ward to check corruption &#61; have we listened with be&#8211; 
coming humility to the advice and remonstrance of 
others&#61; have not our slothfulness and our timidity 
prevented us from resisting the wrong &#61; And even 
if we can answer all these queries in a manner to 
satisfy our consciences&#44; we have yet the startling 
question to meet&#58; &#34;How have. we educated our chil&#8211; 
dren &#61;&#34; We boast about the beauty of our religion &#59; 
we deplore its downfall in the misconduct of many 
around us &#59; we withdraw even from popular meetings&#44; 
because we cannot stem the tide of wrong measures 
enforced against the precepts of the law&#58; but our 
children we neglect&#44; they are to obtain a knowledge 
of religion by intuition or inspiration &#59; we do not 
trouble ourselves to teach them the Avay they should 
walk in&#44; we do not show them the path of righteous&#8211; 
ness &#59; all we do is to tell them that they are born of 
Jewish parentage&#44; and leave them then to find their 
way to the knowledge and practice of the precepts 
revealed to Moses&#44; as well as they can &#59; we have dis&#8211; 
charged our duty by being their corporeal parents&#44; 
and we either have not the abilities or the inclination 
to become their spiritual ones also. And even if we 
tell them a few of the commandments&#44; we are too en&#8211; 
lightened forsooth to enforce them &#59; we allege to live 
in a free country&#44; and say&#44; every one has a right to do

what he pleases. Abstractedly speaking&#44; we have a 
power of doing whatever we will&#44; even the most un&#8211; 
natural crimes &#59; but the right to do wrong is an ab&#8211; 
surdity&#44; which none but weak minds can ever enter&#8211; 
tain. This being the case&#44; it is evidently absurd to 
let our children go unpunished&#44; or at all events unre&#8211; 
proved&#44; if they fail to attend to the religious duties 
which we ourselves teach them&#44; or which an instructor 
to whose care we have intrusted their education has 
imparted. But this&#44; alas &#33; is not our mode of proceed&#8211; 
ing &#59; for no matter how little regardful the child is of 
religious observance&#44; we close our eyes against it&#44; and 
foolishly imagine&#44; that riper years will teach him 
more correctly&#44; than our persuasion can do in child&#8211; 
hood. But we deceive ourselves&#59; for religion is a 
check upon the inclinations and passions&#44; as has been 
said already very often &#59; if&#44; therefore&#44; the curbing of 
these passions and these inclinations has not been 
strictly enforced at an age&#44; Avhen the physical organi&#8211; 
zation of the body is not sufficiently developed to per&#8211; 
mit the child to act as his sensual feelings demand &#58; 
how can it be expected that he will be moderate in 
the enjoyment of unhallowed pleasures&#44; when he feels 
himself drawn towards them by the example of others 
and his own inward impulse&#44; when he at the same 
time imagines&#44; that his powers of mind and body are 
now fully equal to their being taken in large and im&#8211; 
moderate quantities &#61; &#8212; Or we attend carefully to the 
education of our children in childhood&#59; we early teach 
them to repeat&#44; when they first begin to lisp with their 
infant stammer&#44; the unity of our God&#59; yes&#44; they are 
taught to say&#58; &#34; Hear&#44; O Israel&#44; the Lord our God is 
the only Eternal Being. &#34; As they advance farther

in years&#44; we instil in tlieni&#44;a part of the duties they 
owe to this only God&#44; ay&#44; make them acquainted by 
degrees with the wdiole duty of man. But no sooner 
have they reached the age of boyhood&#44; than all re&#8211; 
straint is at once withdrawn&#44; and they are taught to 
unlearn all the lessons of their childhood &#59; fDr it is not 
to be supposed that the young gentleman need to be 
an attendant at the place of worship &#59; it can hardly be 
expected of him&#44; that he should abstain from forbid&#8211; 
den food &#59; and as for Sabbaths and the festivals &#8212; he 
is placed in a situation where their observance is next 
to impossible &#59; he is told&#44; that it is the chief business 
of his life to amass money either as a merchant&#44; a 
mechanic&#44; a physician&#44; or a lawyer&#44; and that he will 
have done enough to satisfy his parents&#39; scruples&#44; if 
he comes once a year or once in two years&#44; on a Kip&#8211; 
pur or Rosh&#8211;Hashanah&#44; to appear before the altar of 
God&#44; provided he does all in 4ns power during the rest 
of the time to advance the interest of his parents or 
his own&#44; and their mutual high&#8211;standing in society. 
And even if we teach our children actually and truly 
how to fear God&#44; we very often destroy all good effects 
by our own irreligious conduct. We teach them &#58; 
&#34;Remember the Sabbath to keep it holy&#44;&#34; and we 
follow our pursuits&#39; on this day &#59; what then can they 
learn &#61; is not our good instruction more than coun&#8211; 
terbalanced by our own transgression&#61; Again we 
complain&#44; that our children will not attend at the 
Synagogue&#44; despite of our commands to that eifect &#59; 
but we corrupt them by example&#44; in staying at home 
for every trilling excuse we can make to lull our in&#8211; 
ward accuser. &#8212; We tell them to abstain from for&#8211; 
bidden food&#59; while we ourselves cease to be strict

Jews&#44; as soon as we leave a congregation. &#8212; AVe tell 
our children not to tell lies&#44; and not to calumniate or 
speak evil of others &#59; but they see daily&#44; how we pre&#8211; 
varicate&#44; slander the innocent&#44; and misconstrue the 
words and deeds of others. &#8212; We tell our children 
to believe in the word of God&#44; to adhere to the faith 
of their ancestors &#59; and they nevertheless hear every 
now and then how we dispute in their presence about 
the fundamental parts of the law even&#44; not to men&#8211; 
tion the minor observances. &#8212; We tell our children&#44; 
how glorious a boon the Almighty has given us in 
bestowing his holy Torah on our ancestors&#59; but it is&#42; 
useless to hide from them&#44; that we are ashamed of 
being at times known as Jews&#44; as though it would be 
a disgrace to be descended from that glorious people&#44; 
who were enlightened in a pure knowledge of the 
Creator&#44; and in possession of his wise and saving laws&#44; 
while the Egyptians worshipped beasts&#44; the Chaldeans 
the host of heaven&#44; the Phoenicians the Moloch&#44; and 
the Persians the fire &#59; while the Grecians were roving 
sea&#8211;robbers &#59; the Romans not in existence &#59; the Gauls 
and Germans savages roaming through their track&#8211; 
less&#44; swampy forests &#59; and while the Britons&#44; the pre&#8211; 
decessors of the proud English nation&#44; stalked about 
naked with &#39;their bodies painted blue&#44; like modern 
savages of some southern isle. And our children&#44; I 
assert&#44; must discover constantly by our manner&#44; that 
we are wellnigh ashamed of being known as the pos&#8211; 
terity of the noble Israelitish people&#44; who were en&#8211; 
lightened and religious&#44; while the rest of the world 
was either sunk in barbarism or gross idolatry. And

much pains constantly to surround themselves with 
those not helonging to the covenant&#44; while the Jew 
is excluded&#44; even from the Jew&#39;s house&#44; as though he 
were not fit to associate with the distinguished men 
and women of other sects&#61; Is it now to he won&#8211; 
dered at&#44; that our children are daily growing more 
indifferent to our sacred religion&#61; that they ultimately 
throw off its yoke altogether &#61; and that we are com&#8211; 
pelled to call the Romanist&#44; the Protestant&#44; and the 
infidel&#44; by the endearing names of uncle&#44; aunt&#44; bro&#8211; 
ther&#44; sister&#44; and cousin&#61; How can we be astonished&#44; 
that the followers of our faith are daily becoming 
fewer amongst our younger members&#44; when their ed&#8211; 
ucation is so wretchedly defective&#44; as has been just 
exhibited to you &#61; And truly&#44; brethren&#44; if our religion 
were any thing but divine&#44; it must long since have 
died out in many countries&#44; and in this country in 
particular. But there is a germ of life in the institu&#8211; 
tions handed down from Sinai&#44; which no misconduct 
of men can extinguish &#59; ay&#44; let every roll of the law 
&#40;but which God forfend&#41; be ordered to the flames by 
some new persecutor yet unborn&#44; and let the teachers 
of our religion be all led out to execution &#58; there would 
still arise teachers and books of the law from amid 
the slain adherents&#44; and from amid the ashes of the 
rolls&#44; and anew would the word be dispensed to the 
thirsting world &#59; for it is written&#44; that the law shall 
never depart from our mouth&#44; nor from the mouth of 
our remotest descendants. &#8212; But I digress&#59; the con&#8211; 
templation of the glorious permanence of the treasure 
preserved in yonder ark before us would lead me from 
my subject&#44; should I suffer my feelings to lead me on.

To revert to our subject &#58; if we wish to do any thing 
to advance the cause of our religion&#44; we must begin 
to attend more carefully&#44; than we have been in the 
habit of doing&#44; to the education of our children&#44; so 
that each parent may have well&#8211;founded hopes&#44; to see 
arising in his offspring a new generation of adherents 
to the law of God&#44; and have the satisfaction to know&#44; 
that&#44; when he is departing to a better world&#44; his de&#8211; 
scendants have been so educated&#44; that he may look for&#8211; 
ward to meeting with them again before the throne of 
God in bliss and happiness. &#8212; Indeed&#44; no other repent&#8211; 
ance can be of any real good &#59; for while each man re&#8211; 
forms only himself&#44; he has done but very little of what 
his God can with justice demand of him. Suppose a 
spirit should appear before the judgment of the Most 
High&#44; and be questioned what he had done with the 
charges intrusted to his care&#44; and be compelled to 
answer&#44; that one had forsaken the Synagogue for the 
church of Rome&#59; another had joined the Moslems&#44; 
and a third had become an atheist&#44; because he the 
father had neglected to teach them carefully the way 
they should go &#58; can it be supposed that happiness 
would be awarded to him &#61; &#34;No&#44; the voice of thunder 
would reverberate in his ears with the dreadful doom &#58; 
&#34; Be thou consigned to punishment&#44; till thy children 
have expiated their guilt&#44; for thou&#44; their parent&#44; and 
their sentinel&#44; hast neglected to obey the precept 
which says&#44; And thou shalt teach them carefully 
unto thy children&#44; and thou shalt speak of them&#44; when 
thou sittest in thy house&#44; when thou walkest by the

been careless about warning tbem of tbe danger they 
were running by entering the way of sin.&#34; &#8212; Would 
this not be a doom deserved by a parent so acting&#61; 
and how many expose themselves daily to it by their 
entire or partial forgetfulness of the sacred trust re&#8211; 
posed in them &#61; For&#44; brethren&#44; you must know&#44; that 
tbe children with which we may be blest are not to 
be looked upon as our sole property&#44; and whose re&#8211; 
ligious education we are permitted to neglect or pro&#8211; 
mote as may suit our fancy&#59; on the contrary&#44; they 
are like something left by one person in the safe&#8211;keep&#8211; 
ing of another&#44; who receives pay for the trouble he 
may be at for watching over the property intrusted 
to him&#44; but which may be demanded back at any 
moment&#44; unhurt and entire. The parents must&#44; there&#8211; 
fore&#44; take all the pains they are capable of&#44; to instruct 
their children in infancy in their duties&#44; and to show 
them in their own persons such an example of right&#8211; 
eousness&#44; that they may never be induced either to 
despise their parents for their impiety&#44; or to neglect 
the instruction they have received &#59; and when the 
age of infancy is passed&#44; care should be taken that 
the lessons of childhood be not effaced by the license 
or temptation held out&#44; or by downright compulsion 
to forsake the path of religion. If&#44; after all&#44; our off&#8211; 
spring should not be according to our expectations&#44; 
we have done our duty&#44; we have warned them&#44; and 
their blood will be on their own heads. 

Brethren&#44; long since have I wished to address you 
upon this very important subject&#58; and I must ask 
your indulgence for having detained you so much 
longer than it is my custom to do. But I need not 
tell you&#44; that what has been said this day is not half

sufficient to discuss the subject in any way commen&#8211; 
surate with its importance&#59; my object was merely to 
draw your attention seriously to this matter&#44; little 
doubting&#44; but that your own reflections will fill up 
whatever is defective in this slight sketch. &#8212; To you&#44; 
therefore&#44; fathers in Israel&#33; do I address myself&#59; de&#8211; 
vote some&#44; more time to the personal superintendence 
over the education of your children&#44; and do not leave 
their future happiness entirely to pensioned strangers&#44; 
who but too often think themselves absolved from all 
responsibility&#44; when their scholars are perfect in their 
lessons&#59; as they say&#44; and perhaps with justice&#44; that 
they are not chosen to teach religion and morality&#44; 
but only the usual routine of sciences and accomplish&#8211; 
ments&#44; some of which are&#44; at best&#44; of doubtful useful&#8211; 
ness&#33; &#8212; And you&#44; who are mothers in the house of 
Jacob&#44; listen I pray you&#44; to the advice of a brother&#44; 
though he be young and not as experienced or as vir&#8211; 
tuous as many of you. In your power it is to pro&#8211; 
duce a great reformation in the state of our youths. 
It is said by our wise men&#58; &#34;That for the merit 
of pious women our ancestors were redeemed from 
Egypt&#59;&#34; and I am confident&#44; that even to this day 
true devotion and true piety dwell in many a bosom 
of the virgins and matrons of our people. Try&#44; then&#44; 
your gentle power of persuasion&#44; which you can so 
powerfully exert &#59; lead your children and your wards 
in the way they should go&#58; point out to them the 
deceits of transgression &#59; tell them how many a noble 
mind has been wrecked upon the devious way of sin&#44; 
and how many an humble orphan has been raised to 
eminence&#44; solely by the pursuit of virtue&#44; based upon 
the revelation from Sinai. &#8212; If even some hours usually

sufficiently rewarded&#44; when you see your sons grow 
up round your table like the sprouts of the olive in

at being told&#44; that professing Jews partook of the

Father of Mercy&#33; who art so highly elevated

of those of thy children who are of devout heart and 
contrite spirit. So that all mankind may be con&#8211;

vinced&#44; that to Thee alone&#44; everlasting One &#33; appertain 
the glory&#44; the majesty&#44; and the dominion over all&#44; 
and be led to worship Thee only&#44; in truth and sin&#8211; 
cerity. Amen. 

Brethren&#33; 

Many of you may have heard ridicule cast upon 
what some term the arrogance of the Hebrews in 
styling themselves the chosen people. For our oppo&#8211; 
nents say&#44; that all earth belongs to God&#44; and it is un&#8211; 
worthy of his greatness to select the fewest of people 
as his peculiar treasure. Besides they aver&#44; that we. 
do not show such a superiority above other classes of 
men as would justly entitle us to a distinction so 
proud&#44; even granting that God had chosen us. &#8212; Otliers 
again say&#44; that in truth wo have once been actually 
the chosen people&#44; but that now we are rejected for 
our rebellious conduct. &#8212; We will briefly examine all 
these objections&#44; and see whether it is beneath the 
dignity of God to have one people&#44; to whom He&#44; the 
All&#8211;wise&#44; attaches more importance than to any other&#59; 
whether we possess any superiority &#59; and&#44; lastly&#44; if it 
be consonant with Revelation&#44; that we should have 
been rejected after having been once chosen. 

We know from the whole tenor of the history of 
mankind&#44; that the children of man in the early ages&#44; 
as well as in later times&#44; did transgress those bounds 
of righteousness which the Almighty had marked 
out for their guidance. Misled by pride&#44; blinded by 
passion&#44; and heedless of consequences&#44; they followed 
the counsels of their wicked hearts&#44; and said to God &#58; 
&#34;Depart Thou from us&#44;&#34; till their crimes had reached 
a height no longer tolerable to the just and wise Crea&#8211;

tor&#59; when He opened the wmdows of heaven&#44; split 
the fountains of the mighty deep&#44; and the rushing&#44; 
surging waters of the flood swept off the sinful race 
from the face of the earth. But in punishing the 
sinners&#44; the Merciful was not unconscious of the work 
of his hands&#44; and He saved from amidst the destruc&#8211; 
tion the man who had been righteous and upright in 
his generation &#59; and Noah was thus spared to repeople 
the earth&#44; and he became in consequence the second 
father to the intelligent inhabitants of the globe. 

To him also were given statutes and command&#8211; 
ments&#44; by which a man might walk in the way of 
righteousness &#59; but his descendants also forgot very 
soon&#44; like the nations before the flood had done&#44; their 
duties towards God&#44; and they instituted worships 
which they had invented through tlieir fancy&#44; and 
they obeyed laws which were counter to the revela&#8211; 
tion given to Ioali. &#8212; You will thus see&#44; that twice 
the world had an example of a universal and uniform 
revelation&#44; and twice also an example of the forget&#8211; 
fulness by the world of a revelation given to all. The 
parallel holds good even farther. For&#44; as before the 
flood there was one man righteous more than his gen&#8211; 
eration &#58; there also was found in the second general 
corruption of manners one pre&#8211;eminent for his signal 
piety&#59; this man&#44; as you all know&#44; and as we have no&#8211; 
ticed on prior occasions&#44; was Abraham. We need 
not recapitulate his history&#44; any farther than to men&#8211; 
tion that God made with him a covenant&#44; as the Bible 
calls it&#44; to constitute his descendants a people pecu&#8211; 
liarly chosen to the service of God&#44; and that they 
should observe the precepts which the Lord had given 
or should ordain. &#8212; You will observe&#44; brethren&#44; that 

<pb n="20"/>

20 THE SELECTION OF ISRAEL. 

what lias just been said will answer the first objec&#8211; 
tion started above. The Almighty had found&#44; that 
as human nature was constituted&#44; and observing the 
situation of mankind at that period&#44; it wonld not 
answer any good purpose to give a general revelation 
for a third time &#59; for we have every reason to think 
that a law so given would have been disregarded 
again and again&#44; and every succeeding generation 
would have departed farther from the truth&#44; if it had 
been the common legacy of all&#44; and consequently not 
valued because of its universality. It was therefore 
that God called Abraham to his service&#44; after he had 
displayed his devotion amidst idolaters&#44; that is to 
say&#44; that the laws given to Noah had found in him a 
faithful adherent&#44; despite the general aberration with 
which he was on all sides surrounded. Abraham 
was therefore told&#44; that he should be blessed&#44; and 
that at length all nations should be blessed through 
him. What now was the consequence of the promise 
to Abraham &#61; what in fact could it be &#61; It was&#44; that 
to his descendants there should be given a law&#44; a 
code&#44; of universal applicability and of everlasting du&#8211; 
ration &#59; this was a blessing to Abraham himself&#44; and 
one which alone could bless ultimately all nations of 
the earth&#59; for in the spread of the tenets of truth 
every human being can lay a claim to a portion of 
the blessing fiowing from such an event&#59; but let con&#8211; 
quest be extended ever so far&#44; the conquered must 
sufier&#44; for there can be no conquest without inflicting 
cruel misery on the subdued &#59; and riches distributed 
in unbounded plenty will not satisfy the cravings of 
cupidity and the discontents of envy&#44; even if every 
human being were to be placed above want. But 

<pb n="21"/>

THE SELECTION OF ISRAEL. 21 

truth spread&#44; as we have said&#44; universally abroad&#44; 
distributed to all human beings alike&#44; is&#8211; indeed that 
species of treasure through which none are made to 
suffer&#44; and which leaves no room to excite the discon&#8211; 
tent of the envious. 

But&#44; brethren&#44; whilst feeling within ourselves&#44; how 
great the blessing is we possess in the revealed law 
of our God&#44; we must not overlook the astonishing 
evidence of the most unsearchable wisdom which is 
display&#8211;ed in the whole arrangement of its promulga&#8211; 
tion. Observe&#44; &#8212; if God had descended in the utmost 
state of majesty&#44; and revealed himself to Abraham&#44; 
to Isaac&#44; or to Jacob&#44; assume the magnificence to 
have been even exceeding the descent on Sinai&#58; still 
it would have been a revelation to individuals&#44; and 
succeeding generations would have doubted the evi&#8211; 
dence of one man&#44; who&#44; though ever so goqd&#44; might 
have been misled&#44; or might be presumed to relate a 
falsehood in order to magnify his own importance. 
Therefore a limited number of statutes only was 
given to the patriarchs&#44; which they were ordered to 
observe&#44; and to teach their descendants after them. 
This state of dawning light lasted for about four cen&#8211; 
turies&#59; ray after ray of light had been gradually dis&#8211; 
pensed&#44; &#8212; Adam &#8212; Hanoch &#8212; Noah &#8212; Abraham &#8212; Isaac 
&#8212; Jacob &#8212; Joseph &#8212; and perhaps others&#44; of whom no 
account has come down to our days&#44; because it has 
no material bearing on the subject of revealed re&#8211; 
lio&#8211;ion&#44; had the Word of God made known to them&#59; 
thousands upon thousands of the children of the cove&#8211; 
nant had been added to the original stock of one

had wellnigh been extinguished in the bosoms of 
Pharaoh&#39;s bondmen&#58; when suddenly a light&#44; not a 
ray merely&#44; but a bright luminary&#44; burst forth&#59; &#8212; it 
was a Moses&#44; aided by a benevolent Aaron&#44; both true 
shepherds&#44; chosen from among the million&#44; that ap&#8211; 
peared to fulfil the aim of God&#39;s intention. And it 
therefore came to pass in those days&#44; that the glory 
of our Father was manifestly displayed&#44; and guided 
by his care Israel went out with rejoicing and glad&#8211; 
ness to meet their Supreme Ruler at the foot of the 
holy Sinai. &#8212; Here the consummation of the calling 
of Abraham was brought about by the legation of 
Moses&#44; and the revelation of God was made visible 
and audible to all the people. And thus not to one 
great man&#44; but to at least three millions of intelligent 
beings was confided a light&#44; a treasure&#44; a fruitful 
source of blessing&#44; which will in the course of time 
enlighten&#44; enrich&#44; bless&#44; and nourish all nations of 
the earth. &#8212; If then a caviller should ask us&#44; &#34;Why 
do you believe in the divine legation of Moses &#61;&#34; we 
may boldly answer&#58; Because there were present the 
individuals of an entire people&#44; who all were wit&#8211; 
nesses of the truth of the revelation from Horeb&#44; 
since all ultimately acquiesced in the rule thus di&#8211; 
vinely made known&#44; and because these very persons 
rose up in an incredibly short time into a nation wiser 
than their former task&#8211;masters&#44; different from them 
in language&#44; manners&#44; and associations of ideas&#44; and 
proved themselves in possession of a rule of life&#44; and 
of notions concerning the Deity&#44; far above in purity 
and truth to aught that had ever been attained by the 
Egyptians themselves&#44; their predecessors&#44; or their 
followers&#44; nay&#44; even to this very day. &#8212; Shall we say&#44; 

<pb n="23"/>

that a nation of abject&#44; timid&#44; leprous slaves &#40;for this 
is the character given of the Israelites&#41; could rise in 
forty years to a height so unparalleled by the instruc&#8211; 
tion of one man&#44; who had passed the age of eighty&#44; 
and who must be supposed to have partaken al&#8211; 
ready largely of the usual infirmities of age at this 
period &#61; You&#44; my brethren&#44; would no doubt think&#44; 
that the opinion I have just now stated is too ridicu&#8211; 
lous to be entertained by an intelligent mind &#59; yet it 
has been entertained by the unbelievers&#44; and forms 
their chief point in explaining upon merely natural 
grounds the rise of our people during their wander&#8211; 
ings in the wilderness. Yet even grant the objection 
a thousand times more importance than it deserves&#44; 
say even it is true&#58; we then should have a miracle 
still greater than we claim to have been performed. 
&#8212; For our slavery in Egypt is undoubted and unde&#8211; 
nied even by the heathen. Secondly&#44; our wander&#8211; 
ino&#8211;s in the wilderness are also considered authentic. 
Thirdly&#44; our having a ivriiten law different from the 
written law of any other nation is undeniable. 
Fourthly&#44; it must be inferred&#44; that if the Egyptian 
priests had had a private or secret law taught in their 
mysteries not before then promulged to the people&#44; 
they would &#40;Certainly have been able&#44; and no doubt 
would have attempted&#44; to counteract Moses&#44; by mak&#8211; 
ing known the same powerful instrument which he 
had just imparted to the Israelites. Fifthly&#44; it does 
not bear contradiction that the Israelites after hover&#8211; 
ing for forty years about the confines of civilized 
countries&#44; which they were not permitted to enter&#44; 
conquered Palestine and drove out the inhabitants. 
Kow the simple question is&#44; how were the Egyptians

induced to forego the labour of six hundred thousand 
slaves &#61; Did their humanity prompt them to this 
act of benevolence &#61; &#8212; Farther&#44; &#8212; why did those slaves 
enter a frightful wilderness&#61; why did they not at 
once attack a fertile settlement&#61; &#8212; Again&#44; whence did 
they obtain their peculiar statutes&#61; &#8212; And granted 
they were derived from Egyptian sources&#44; what is tljc 
reason that the worship of the Egyptians was in most 
respects so different &#61; And lastly&#44; how did so im&#8211; 
mense a number of men find subsistence in a wilder&#8211; 
ness where there is not even water to drink &#61; If&#44; 
therefore&#44; we even grant to Moses a mind unlike 
that which any other man has ever possessed&#44; and a 
vigour of body but little less than angelic &#58; it must 
still be self&#8211;evident that the workings which took 
place under his administration are too extraordinary 
to have been the result of ordinary human labour. 
We have therefore the strongest evidence of the con&#8211; 
current testimony of our entire people and of a mass 
of unbroken chains of events to establish the reasona&#8211; 
bleness of a belief in the selection of Israel as a peo&#8211; 
ple chosen by God to hold&#44; as a depositary&#44; a law 
which was in the first instance to guide them&#44; and at 
lensfth all other families of the earth. &#8212; And in the 
manner of the selection of Israel&#44; I allude to the man&#8211; 
ner of their preparatory education by a long series of 
calamities&#44; we must also discover the marks of pro&#8211; 
found wisdom. If the law had been given to an opu&#8211; 
lent people&#44; living in a fruitful country&#44; it might have 
happened that&#44; being too much devoted to affairs of 
life&#44; the study of the law would have become a sec&#8211; 
ondary consideration with them&#44; especially if they 
would have had to subject themselves to many incon&#8211;

veniences under the new law. But what did God do 
to implant the law in the hearts of the Israelites&#61; &#8212; 
He caused Jacob to go down to Egypt&#44; impelled 
through his love for Joseph&#59; there his descendants 
multiplied and became a numerous nation&#44; as had 
been predicted. And when the jealousy of the rulers 
of the land became excited&#44; the All&#8211; wise One did not 
interfere to prevent the contemplated oppression&#44; 
foreseeing that it&#44; though protracted from age to age&#44; 
would in the best manner subserve to his wise views. 
But when the Egyptians&#44; emboldened by the impu&#8211; 
nity they had so long enjoyed&#44; began to threaten the 
extermination of their servants&#44; as soon as they de&#8211; 
clared their will of going counter to the permission 
hitherto tacitly extended &#58; the arm of our God was 
interposed&#44; and the oppressed were freed from bond&#8211; 
age&#44; and led&#44; as you all know&#44; through the desert&#44; 
after having passed the Red Sea&#44; to the foot of Sinai. 
Miracle after miracle&#44; some natural&#44; some preter&#8211; 
natural&#44; had been wrought&#44; to prove to them how 
powerful&#44; how kind&#44; how wise&#44; how infinite was the 
God whom their ancestors had worshipped&#44; and to 
illustrate&#44; in the most striking manner&#44; that the 
promises made to the good wdll always be kept&#44; and 
the reward of&#8211; their virtuous deeds will surely come&#44; 
though delayed for a period&#44; for reasons unknown to 
short&#8211;sighted man. Thus delivered and thus protect&#8211; 
ed&#44; our ancestors were notified that their Deliverer 
would manifest unto them his glory&#44; and make known 
to them his laws. They declared their willingness&#44; 
with hearts glowing with gratitude&#44; and minds filled 
with adoration. The law was then given to the peo&#8211; 
ple thus chosen&#59; and though they occasionally re&#8211;

belled&#44; yet their situation was so that the law of God 
constantly became renewed as often as his power was 
displayed&#59; and this state of their national infancy 
was consumed by wandering for forty years in the 
desert&#44; where at length the heavenly code was so 
firmly cemented among them&#44; that even now it is 
inextinguishable in the heart of every Israelite. &#8212; 
Understand me well&#44; I do not wish to advance the 
absurd proposition&#44; that it would have been out of 
the power of God to eifect an instantaneous change 
of heart among the Hebrews&#44; or to communicate his 
will at the same moment to all men&#59; but merely as 
proving that God pursued a course&#44; eminently calcu&#8211; 
lated&#44; more so indeed than any other which our im&#8211; 
agination can conceive&#44; to make his law acceptable to 
the Israelites and permanent among their descend&#8211; 
ants&#44; short of changing human nature&#44; which last 
procedure would evidently have been in opposition 
to the divine economy&#59; and that having once given 
to his code of pure laws and morality a lasting and 
imperishable abode on earth. He at the same time had 
already provided for it a way to the hearts of all man&#8211; 
kind&#44; who&#44; as we have every reason to believe&#44; will all 
ultimately forsake each his idols of silver&#44; and each 
his idols of gold&#44; to serve Him&#44; the Lord&#44; in sincerity 
and righteousness. And says Isaiah&#44; in the spirit of 
inspiration &#58; &#34;And I will show a sign on them&#44; and I 
will send from them refugees to the nations Tharshish&#44; 
Pul and Lud&#44; those that draw the bow&#44; Thubal and 
Yavan&#44; the far islands&#44; that have not heard my fame&#44; 
and have not seen my glory and they shall tell of 
my glory among the nations.&#34; &#40;Ixvi.l9.&#41; &#8212; What then

bis choosing our nation &#61; Had not our ancestors re&#8211; 
mained ever true to his statutes &#61; Had we not suffered 
in Egypt the necessary schooling to fit us for this 
great object&#61; And what is more&#44; have we not thus 
far answered the purpose of our selection &#61; Ask of 
the civilized world&#44; who were the heralds of civiliza&#8211; 
tion &#61; &#8212; Ask of the philanthropist&#44; who first taught 
mercy to mankind &#61; &#8212; Ask the philosopher&#44; who first 
proclaimed the unity of God &#61; &#8212; Ask the preacher&#44; 
whence he derives his system of beneficent morality 
and religion which he upholds&#61; &#8212; and all must an&#8211; 
swer&#44; if they speak the truth&#44; it is from the Israelites 
that all these blessings have flowed unto mankind&#59; 
no other nation has had a hand in laying the founda&#8211; 
tion of these great benefits &#59; and they again have de&#8211; 
rived all from the Supreme Teacher&#44; for not the most 
profound wisdom and experience of men could ever 
devise any thing half so good and beautiful. &#8212; And 
therefore says the Bible &#58; 

&#34; But you the Lord hatli taken and brought you out from the 
iron furnace from Egypt&#44; to be to Him a nation of inheritance&#44; as 
it is this day.&#34; &#44; Deuteronomy iv. 20. 

The perfect reasonableness of all we have just ad&#8211; 
vanced&#44; supported as it is by revelation&#44; experience&#44; 
and common sense&#44; will be sufficient to answer the 
first objection&#44; although much&#39; more can be said&#44; the 
subject being far from exhausted&#44; by the few illustra&#8211; 
tions which I have laid before you. But the space 
which an address ought to occupy prevents me from

going into the matter more in detail at present&#44; al&#8211; 
thongh it is liighly probable&#44; that I may recur to it 
at another time. &#8212; We will&#44; therefore&#44; now proceed 
to the second objection &#58; &#34; What have&#39; the Israelites 
gained by their selection V&#39; We are asked&#44; where are 
our palaces &#61; &#8212; where our splendid temples &#61; &#8212; where 
our kings &#61; &#8212; where our national government &#61; &#8212; and 
what gain has a Jew by maintaining his identity&#44; 
living as he does among the multitude who difier 
from him in laws&#44; in habits&#44; and in feelings &#61; &#8212; To 
these questions&#44; we answer. If national grandeur is 
to be the sole criterion of the importance of a peo&#8211; 
ple we have no importance to boast of&#59; and what is 
more&#44; it is extremely doubtful if ever we had mauy 
splendid buildings in the height of our glory&#44; as but 
one temple was permitted &#59; and in vain does any one 
inquire in Palestine for the existence of stupendous 
works of art which properly belong to us alone. Our 
kings have in truth long ceased to reign&#44; and our na&#8211; 
tional government has been dissolved&#44; and our jjeople 
scattered to all climes of heaven. Of power on earth&#44; 
of importance among nations we have no share&#44; not 
even the smallest if properly viewed&#44; any farther than 
the wealth of a few individuals has ever been able to 
afford us. &#8212; But if we come to the benefits of the mind 
&#8212; to the elevation of the soul &#8212; to purity of worship 
&#8211;to hopes of a glorious futurity &#8212; there&#44; indeed&#44; we 
are blessed above all tongues and nations&#33; What 
care we for palaces as marks of glory &#61; while we

all earthly glory &#59; what care we for kings &#8212; for gov&#8211; 
ernments &#61; when we daily see the power parsing 
away frona the mighty&#44; and the sceptre hourly 
wrenched out of the hands of princes. But we have 
in our scattered state even a bond of union which 
binds our hearts to our God&#44; and holds us in an un&#8211; 
seen embrace as one people &#59; which makes us ob&#8211; 
served and watched by all mankind&#59; which opens for 
us the way to the favour of God &#59; which unlocks for 
us the gates of salvation &#59; which admits us daily and 
hourly into the portals of wisdom and the fear of 
the Lord &#8212; which&#44; in short&#44; confers all that can make 
an existence happy and useful&#59; and this is the advan&#8211; 
tage&#44; brethren&#44; which is conferred by the law &#8212; the 
law given from Sinai &#59; the law which has withstood 
the tempests of oppression and the ravages of time &#8212; 
and yet stands with vigour unseared&#44; with its lustre 
undiminished &#33; And this law it is which makes us 
a great nation&#44; a people assisted of the Lord&#44; who is 
the shield of our salvation. Ay &#33; truly now we look 
unsightly&#44; our countenance is marred&#44; our bodies are 
bruised by the blows of those that hate us&#44; and we 
are regarded as struck by God and afflicted. But we 
need not fear&#44; our countenance will be healed&#44; our 
wounds will be bound up&#59; and though the blows 
fall again and again upon our devoted heads&#44; though 
ever so often despised&#44; and called a people stricken 
for transgressions which we have not committed&#44; and 
persecuted for sins not our own &#58; yet the day will 
come when it will be acknowledged that our suffer&#8211; 
ings have been cause of happiness to the nations&#44; 
who then will see the effects arising from a disobedi&#8211;

law which&#44; infringed&#44; made&#8211; ns unhappy&#44; and which 
obey I once did&#44; and will again&#44; make us the light 
and the glory of the world. In the meantime let 
storms assail us &#8212; let us be derided for our littleness 
&#8212; let kings and nations attempt to stamp upon and 
extinguish the small remnant&#58; the end of us will be 
far happier than theirs&#44; and we will be great when 
the names of our adversaries will only be remem&#8211; 
bered as curses and as warnings. Like the mighty 
river whose source is so small that the foolish may 
deem he can obstruct the fountain by placing his foot 
upon the insignificant orifice&#44; or over whose slender 
rill&#44; at its outset&#44; the thoughtless schoolboy jumps to 
show that he can bestride the mighty water &#59; but 
which&#44; at length&#44; mingles its rushing waves with the 
flood of the ocean&#44; and bears on its bosom the largest 
fleet&#44; heedless of the attempted obstruction or of the 
childish ridicule &#58; thus do we pursue&#44; though alas &#33; 
as unconsciously often as the lifeless river&#44; our course 
towards better times&#44; but which we retard by neglect&#8211; 
ing the duties which would cause us to live and pros&#8211; 
per&#44; if we would be mindful of them. &#8212; Yet even in 
this way do we instruct the world&#44; and like the stream 
which makes fruitful its banks and blesses thus the 
country through which it flows&#44; we bestow the waters 
of life everlasting upon the nations of the earth&#44; in 
whose lands we now live. If we are then asked&#44; what 
advantages we have for opposing ourselves to the 
opinions of the majority&#61; we answer. We only fulfil 
our destiny&#44; the object of the call of our father Abra&#8211; 
ham&#44; to whom God said&#44; &#34; All nations of the earth 
shall be blessed through thee.&#34; This certainty is 
too sweet to be exchanged for worldly goods or for

offices on earth &#33; Let the nations then be ever so 
great&#59; let them lord it over our people&#44; and be it 
ever our lot to be the humble&#44; the poor&#44; the despised 
Jews &#58; yet are we ever the greatest&#44; and most won&#8211; 
derful and beneficent community&#44; as from us and 
from our holy Bible light&#44; and civilization&#44; and mo&#8211; 
rality&#44; and love of God&#44; have spread for ages&#44; and 
will continue so to extend these blessings&#44; till it be ac&#8211; 
complished what was the original intention of God. 

TJius it has come to pass&#44; that we have stood the 
storms which have at all times assailed us&#59; for it was 
our God wdio ahvays watched over us&#44; and no empire 
ever so mighty and wise can prevail against Him. 
This was strikingly exemplified when the Syrian king&#44; 
Antiochus&#44; swept like a whirlwind over Judea&#59; the 
righteous mourned&#44; for the brave were slain &#59; and the 
priests Avept in private&#44; for the altar was desolate. A 
heathen worship was proclaimed&#44; and it was death to 
call upon the Lord of heaven. If ever our religion 
was seemingly nigh its downfall&#44; it was surely at that 
dark period&#44; wdien the foreign enemy and the infidels 
at home conspired to destroy the sanctuary and to 
uproot the seeds of righteousness. &#8212; But He who sits 
enthroned in heaven smiled&#44; the Lord looked upon the 
noise of tha heathens whh. contempt&#44; and He smote 
them&#44; as it were&#44; w&#8211;ith an iron staff&#44; and shivered 
them like potter&#39;s ware. And He raised unto the 
remnant of Jacob&#39;s house a helper from among them&#44; 
and Judah Maccabeus avenged the house of God de&#8211; 
filed&#44; the altar broken&#44; and the worshippers slaugh&#8211; 
tered&#59; and in grateful remembrance of the mighty 
deliverance from annihilation&#44; the eight days of Ha&#8211; 
nuckah were instituted as a memorial for everlasting.

Since that period&#44; our enemies have not pretermitted 
their exertions &#59; they took constantly counsel against 
the Lord and his chosen people&#59; but all their eflbrts 
have resulted in utter discomfiture&#59; and though they 
have sucx3eeded in gaining the interested and timid&#44; 
the great multitude of us have either met their death 
in defence of our law&#44; or have lived while steadfastly 
maintaining it. And a Titus and a Hadrian&#44; though 
one burnt the temple&#44; and the other passed the plough 
over Jerusalem&#44; a host of persecutors armed with 
physical and spiritual terrors&#44; the horrid Inquisition&#44; 
and lastly&#44; the subtle associations which&#44; with the 
power of worldly wealth&#44; or the allurements of offices 
and distinctions&#44; attempted to call off our brethren 
from their allegiance to God &#8212; have all shared an 
equal disappointment&#44; and they have all had to ac&#8211; 
knowledge that it is useless to attempt a war with 
Heaven. And thus said David&#58; 

&#34;And where is a single people on earth like thy people Israel&#44; 
for whose sake a deity has gone to redeem them to him as a people&#44; 
and to make himself a name&#61;&#34; 2 Samuel vii. 23. 

It will thus be seen&#44; that our selection was made 
for the purpose of rendering the name of God glorious 
amons&#58; the nations&#44; and to brins&#59; all mankind ulti&#8211; 
mately to the knowledge of the righteous way&#59; as 
the prophet says&#58; &#34;And the nations shall go by thy 
light and kings by the brightness of thy shining&#59;&#34; 
and the period when this will be accomplished will 
be a time of universal peace&#44; and of the reign of a

knowledge of the Lord. Is this object of sufficient 
importance to have warranted the Supreme Wisdom 
to select unto himself a people peculiarly beloved 
above all others&#61; and is a destiny thus glorious not 
sufficiently great to make every Israelite feel gratified 
at the knowledge of belonging to the descendants of 
Abraham&#61; Surely&#44; brethren&#44; if we are not totally 
immersed in the whirlpool of selfishness and pursuits 
of vain aorsrrandizement &#58; we must be satisfied&#44; even 
when we are without worldly splendour&#44; with the 
consciousness that our beautiful system will survive 
all existing institutions&#44; and that the remotest pos&#8211; 
terity of our tyrants and oppressors shall at length 
be brought to bow before the same altar with the 
children of Israel. It behoves&#44; therefore&#44; that every 
Hebrew to his share towards sanctifying God&#39;s name&#44; 
and endeavour to fulfil the prediction of the prophet&#44; 
&#34;And I will show myself great&#44; and be sanctified&#44; and 
be known before the eyes of many nations&#44; and they 
shall know that I am the Lord &#33;&#34; And do you&#44; my 
brethren&#44; who listen now to me&#44; impress it deeply on 
your minds&#44; and tell it to your friends and to your 
children&#44; that not yet has it become of no moment to 
belong to the chosen people&#59; but that neither is it 
enough to be&#8211; only a Jew by name&#44; No &#33; we should 
rise from our supineness&#44; avow boldly our sentiments&#44; 
not fear to be ridiculed because we thank God in our 
prayers&#44; that He has chosen us from all nations&#44; and 
act just so as this proud eminence demands of us. 
Let us support the cause of religion&#44; teach its pre&#8211; 
cepts&#44; and never omit any opportunity to display our 
confidence in our heavenly Father&#44; and our subjection 
to his will.

Note &#8212; The continuation of this address will be found under 
Discourse XXXII. &#8212; Soon after the above was written&#44; I was seized 
with a fearful malady&#44; which prevented me from continuing my 
labours till after a long and painful interruption. I do not wish to 
drag myself personally before the public &#59; but I cannot refrain 
from mentioning&#44; that being supposed on the point of death&#44; my 
only brother hastened from a distance to my bedside. It pleased 
our heavenly Father to afflict him with the same disease. Although 
robust&#44; and to all appearance of that physical construction&#44; as to 
render his long surviving me almost a matter of certainty&#44; he yet 
sunk under his sufferings&#44; and tranquil and resigned he breathed 
out his pure spirit in the hands of Him who gave it&#44; in the twenty&#8211; 
fifth year of his age&#44; on the 14th of March&#44; &#39;94&#44; beloved by many&#44; 
and hated by none. The recollection of his death is doubly agoniz&#8211; 
ing&#44; because he had to receive from friendly strangers the kindness 
and attention that ought to havo been rendered by his brother&#44; 
who was kept from his couch of sickness by sufferings of unspeaka&#8211; 
ble intensity and horror. I ask the indulgence of the reader for 
this digression &#59; but I could not let this opportunity pass&#44; without 
passing a slight tribute to one so worthy and innocent as was my 
deceased my only brother&#44; Jacob Leeser.

DISCOUESE XXXI. 

THE DUTY OF ACTIVE BENEVOLENCE. 

MOST merciful One &#33; who sendest succour to the 
afflicted&#44; and protectest the helpless&#44; grant us thy pro&#8211; 
tection and deliver us from evil&#44; and judge us not 
according to our unworthy deeds&#44; but according to 
thy goodness&#44; which is everlasting. Amen. 

Brethken&#33; 

We are taught in the books of Holy &#34;Writ not to 
look upon this life as the chief period of our exist&#8211; 
ence&#59; nor upon the goods of the earth&#44; the material 
possessions&#44; as the greatest acquirement&#59; nor&#44; lastly&#44; 
npon sensual pleasures as the highest enjoyment. &#8212; 
And seeing that every thing here below is transitory&#44; 
even the most careless observer is very apt to acquiesce 
in the idea&#44; that life is short and its pleasures uncer&#8211; 
tain&#59; yet there are few&#44; indeed&#44; who are led on to a 
virtuous andvgodly life through a contemplation of 
the vicissitudes to which they are subject. Indeed&#44; 
if one looks at the haste with which we all run after 
gain&#59; the efibrts we make to lay up treasures&#44; and 
the perseverance with which we pursue to our dying 
day the phantom pleasure &#58; he might be led to sup&#8211; 
pose&#44; that we believed ourselves thus engaged in ful&#8211; 
filling the true object of our existence. And to con&#8211; 
fess the truth&#44; many&#44; if not all of us&#44; think they have

done every thing that can be demanded of them&#44; if 
their wealth has increased a hundred&#8211;fold&#59; if their 
houses are splendid&#59; if their appointments are grand&#44; 
and if the voice of mirth is never ceasing in their 
habitation&#33; They say&#58; &#34;Life is short&#44; let us&#44; there&#8211; 
fore&#44; enjoy its sweets&#59;&#34; and this heartless philosophy 
is often the cause of many a life being fooled away 
in vain pursuits and in endeavours which leave the 
soul wofully deficient in those riches which are to gain 
her an entrance into everlasting happiness. And yet 
what are riches&#61; Who has ever found his thirst for 
gold entirely gratified by immense possessions&#61; And 
say&#44; what is power &#61; Who was ever so powerful&#44; but 
he sighed for more worlds to conquer&#61; And speak&#44; 
what is pleasure &#61; When pain lurks among enjoy&#8211; 
ment&#44; and death rears his visage where all are gay&#61; 
It is in this spirit that David said &#40;Psalm xxxix. 13&#41; &#58; 
&#34;Hear my prayer&#44; O Lord&#33; list to my cry&#59; be not 
silent to my tears &#59; for a stranger I am with Thee&#44; 
a sojourner like all my forefathers.&#34; Here the in&#8211; 
spired Psalmist expresses his ideas of his existence on 
earth. &#34; For a stranger Tam with Thee &#59;&#34; we are like 
strangers&#44; that enter an unknown land&#44; driven there 
by circumstances beyond their control&#44; and who may 
be compelled to leave again as suddenly as they ar&#8211; 
rived&#44; or at best after a short warning. And let us 
understand the words &#34;with Thee&#59;&#34; we are&#44; whilst 
thus staying on God&#39;s earth under the supervision of 
Him who sent us&#44; we are in his presence&#59; for al&#8211; 
though unseen. He is felt every where &#59; for though 
unperceived by the human senses&#44; the whole world 
is full of his glory. &#8212; And&#44; continues David&#58; &#34;A so&#8211; 
journer like all my forefathers&#44;&#34; As our forefathers

were here permitted to act their part and then were 
hidden from view&#44; removed from amidst the living&#58; 
so are we tolerated strangers&#44; suffered to take our. 
abode for a time&#44; a very brief space of time like those 
who went before us&#44; till our day of removal also ar&#8211; 
rives&#44; when we are hurried away&#44; no matter how many 
engagements of business are incompleted&#44; how many 
houses left unfinished&#59; no matter if the festive meal 
be not half devoured&#44; whilst yet&#44; perhaps&#44; the mandate 
of the potent ruler has scarcely been uttered to do 
some mighty work&#59; whilst yet the orator&#39;s words are 
on his lips&#44; and whilst the foot of beauty enchants the 
eye&#44; even of envy&#44; by its evolutions in the mazes of 
the dance. Why then should the spirit of mortal be 
proud &#61; Or rather&#44; why should he not endeavour to 
live according to the will of Him&#44; with whom he is a 
stranger&#61; in whose world he is a sojourner&#61; through 
whose goodness he lives &#61; &#8212; This consideration brings 
before us the whole subject of active religious duties&#44; 
which consist not merely in abstaining from doing 
harm&#44; nor even in bestowing the superfluous and ex&#8211; 
ecuting that which is easy of accomplishment&#44; but in 
a constant labouring in the path of goodness&#44; in sac&#8211; 
rificing interest&#44; and in doing things unpleasant and 
even contrary to our inclinations&#44; if they should chance 
to present themselves as a part of the work to be 
performed. &#8212; But some one may ask &#58; &#34; Can religion 
then consist for the greatest part of self&#8211;denials and 
sacrifices of our interest&#61;&#34; Certainly&#59; and this is 
the reason &#34;why a religion was revealed&#44; to enable us 
to know when we ought to act counter to our inclina&#8211; 
tion&#44; and when to sacrifice our possessions in the ser&#8211; 
vice of God. Of our own accord we could not know&#44;

that we are bound to give charity&#44; to assist the sick&#44; 
to feed the hungry&#44; to clothe the naked&#44; and to bury 
the dead. For although it is very consonant with the 
finer feelings of our nature&#44; to be engaged in these 
holy offices of kindness &#58; still we find that there are 
some who not only abstain from fulfilling these duties&#44; 
but who do just the opposite&#59; they refuse charity to 
the poor&#44; and even rob the orphan and the widow&#44; 
so as to render them dependent upon a merciless 
world&#59; some are so callous as to plunder the wounded 
soldier on the field of deadly combat&#44; and answer his 
cry for water to quench his thirst&#44; made intolerable 
by burning fever&#44; by a thrust with the dagger &#59; the 
miser will turn the shivering son of misery unheeded 
from his door&#59; and many will refuse the last rights 
of humanity to the departed&#44; because he is indebted 
to them for a little silver. All this proves&#44; that human 
nature required a guide to show it what is right and 
pleasing in the eyes of God. And even if we reject 
the above examples&#44; by saying&#44; that of extreme cases 
of depravity it is unfair to draw general rules as to 
the necessity of a revelation &#58; still we may freely say&#44; 
that the religious duties&#44; properly so called&#44; as the 
observance of the Sabbath&#44; the restitution of pur&#8211; 
chased lands in the fiftieth year&#44; the release of all 
bondmen&#44; and many other ordinances&#44; although in 
themselves strictly political &#40;not to mention the purely 
ceremonial&#41; laws&#44; are not the natural ofispring of 
unassisted reason. But we wander from our subject&#58; 
all I meant to demonstrate is&#44; that religion in every 
instance is a guide to the feelings by which they are 
to be regulated &#59; and to attain perfection &#40;in as far as 
this quality is compatible with our nature&#41; we should 

<pb n="39"/>

THE DUTY OF ACTIVE BENEVOLENCE. 39 

fill our minds with those ideas which are best calcu&#8211; 
lated to induce an acquiescence in the divine will. 
Now&#44; where the duties demanded of us are mere pleas&#8211; 
ant exercises of humanity&#44; it will require but little 
effort to be religious &#59; for instance&#44; the welcoming of 
strangers&#59; the joyous reception of a bride&#59; the restor&#8211; 
ing of peace between offended brothers&#58; still these 
acts are in obedience to the dictates of the law&#44; and 
we must&#44; therefore&#44; believe that reward will follow 
our execution of them. But there are other deeds of 
humanity to which many may&#44; perhaps&#44; be indisposed 
from mere affection&#59; and&#44; consequently&#44; to act in 
obedience to the will of Heaven in this respect&#44; re&#8211; 
quires more or less an effort to subdue unhallowed 
feelings&#44; and to yield ourselves to superior guidance. 
Among duties of this kind&#44; we may enumerate the 
redemption of prisoners&#44; the buying in of a relative&#39;s 
field&#59; the remission of debts in the sabbathic year&#59; 
restitution of property unlawfully obtained &#59; the re&#8211; 
storing of pledges to the debtor before sundown&#44; and 
many other duties enumerated in the law. Still&#44; 
though repugnance may be felt to the exercise of 
these precepts&#44; they are&#44; strictly speaking&#44; moral laws 
in contradistinction to the religious ordinances &#59; and 
since they may be unpalatable to many&#44; we find the 
law of God reminding us of the obligation we are 
under to fulfil them&#44; and giving us also reasons why 
we should be careful of their observance. It will 
easily strike you&#44; brethren&#44; what sinful feeling stands 
in the way&#44; when we are told to redeem from bondage 
a fellow&#8211;being. It is avarice&#44; however refined&#59; we 
speak not of where an actual inability exists&#44; but 
where one has the means in his possession and hesi&#8211;

tates&#44; because he may allege that he need not spend 
his money for a friend&#44; who may never be able to re&#8211; 
pay him&#44; or if able&#44; may be ungrateful enough to 
suffer him to lose by his humanity &#59; and he&#44; perhaps&#44; 
will also fancy to himself&#44; that his means are no 
more than he wants for his own use&#44; and that he can&#8211; 
not spare the least of them for the service of his 
Maker and the benefit of his fellow&#8211;man. Observe&#44; 
a personal unwillingness to do a duty of humanity 
never enters into the consideration&#59; this is always 
kept out of view&#44; to satisfy an uneasy conscience&#44; and 
to excuse a duty pretermitted&#59; and provided we can 
colour our selfishness with a sufiicient show of argu&#8211; 
ment&#44; we are perfectly easy&#44; as though we had done 
all that could reasonably be demanded of us. But&#44; 
though we may thus succeed in imposing upon the 
credulity of others and even upon ourselves&#44; for by a 
series of false reasoning every man may lay a flatter&#8211; 
ing unction to his soul &#58; we shall&#44; nevertheless&#44; not be 
altogether successful&#44; for there is One that searches 
the heart&#44; and knows the thoughts of man&#44; though 
they be vain. And thus&#44; even if we blind ourselves 
by talking of an inability to comply&#44; of ingratitude in 
those to be served&#44; or the like&#44; we shall never be able 
to hide the deformity of an indulged avarice from our 
heavenly Judge. But if we weigh his omniscience 
against our desire to retain what is once ours&#44; we no 
doubt will be willing to satisfy his demands&#44; since we 
are not able to escape his superintendence. Farther&#44; 
we should consider&#44; that it is by no means certain&#44; 
that we are not to lose the very amount we withhold&#44; 
even if we should not be deprived of all that we value 
so highly. I need not tell you&#44; that of hundreds born

happen that industry and means employ&#8211;ed by one 
man do not yield the return which they yielded to 
another&#58; we shall he answered&#44; the means of the one 
were blessed by God&#59; from those of the others the 
blessing was withheld. &#8212; Now&#44; how can a man sup&#8211; 
pose that it will be in his power to keep what he once 
possesses&#44; even by the greatest exertion of avarice&#44; 
when the power of the Bestower of wealth stands 
opposed to him &#61; And assume that he may succeed&#44; 
that all his plans yield the expected return&#44; as the 
fruit of his good calculation &#58; what has he at last ob&#8211; 
tained &#61; The favour of God &#61; lN&#34;o&#44; for he cared not to 
spend his wealth in his service&#33; But he has acquired 
masses of shining metal &#59; fine houses in many a noble 
city&#59; lands rich in fruitfulness&#59; ships which cover the 
ocean&#44; and many obedient servants and fawning sjco&#8211; 
phants eager for the refuse of his talje. Can his ex&#8211; 
pectations go farther&#61; and if they do&#44; can they be 
farther gratified&#61; He has worshipped an idol&#44; and 
it was given him &#59; what more can he ask &#61; but he can&#8211; 
not remain with this idol for ever&#44; and his wealth is 
left behind him to be dissipated by a careless spend&#8211; 
thrift&#44; or to be the bone of contention between dis&#8211; 
appointed heirs&#59; or even if he leaves it for charitable 
purposes&#44; it is extremely probable that his mind has 
become so contracted by pursuits of gain&#44; that he is 
unjust to the living after his death&#44; and he leaves 
those unprovided for who have a natural claim on his 
bounty. But go yet farther and say&#44; that his wealth

what merit can he have for his charity&#44; since it was

within his iron grasp &#61; Can this be pleasing to God &#61; &#8212; 
But observe&#44; that&#44; hitherto&#44; we have assumed a uni&#8211; 
form good luck &#40;as it is termed&#41; attending the efforts 
of him who refuses to give of his bread to the poor&#44; 
and of his money to the needy &#59; but we all know that 
success is not a necessary consequence of this line of 
conduct&#44; any more than that poverty is the concomi&#8211; 
tant of liberality. &#8212; The question then arises &#58; Since 
success is not always attending upon saving&#44; but upon 
the blessing of God&#44; shall we expose ourselves to the 
punishment of being deprived of what we value so 
much by a refusal to comply with the conditions upon 
which we were appointed&#44; so to say&#44; trustees under 
the gift of God&#44; to administer for the portion of our 
existence on earth a share of such worldly riches as 
may come into our hands &#61; And says the prophet 
&#40;Malachi iii. 10&#44; 11&#41;&#58; &#34;Bring ye all the tenth part into 
the treasury&#8211;house&#44; that it may serve as provision in 
my house&#59; and prove me&#44; I pray you&#44; in this&#44; if I will 
not open for you the windows of heaven&#44; and pour 
out for you blessing without measure. And I will 
keep off for you the devouring insect&#44; that it may 
not destroy for you the fruit of the earth &#59; and not un&#8211; 
fruitful shall be unto you the vine in the field&#44; saith 
the Lord of hosts.&#34; We thus see that we are prom&#8211; 
ised worldly success&#44; if we comply with the demands 
of the law &#59; and&#44; if we give the tenth part of the pro&#8211; 
duce of the earth to the Levite&#44; share our money with 
the poor&#44; and be as it were angels and ministers of 
comfort on earth&#44; we are told that the windows of 
heaven shall be opened to shower blessings down for

US without measure. The earth then shall not be 
devastated by blight and locust&#44; and richly shall the 
vineyard repay the vintner&#39;s toil. Is the condition 
not such that even avarice would ask no more &#61; And 
can we doubt the fulfilment of the promise&#44; when we 
truly see that the seed of the righteous are blessed&#44; 
and that his children never want for bread&#61; &#8212; But 
discard altogether worldly success&#44; admit that the 
bounty bestowed upon the poor&#44; the time spent in 
personal deeds of humanity are actually lost to worldly 
gain&#59; that you are so much the poorer by having on 
sixty Siibbath&#8211;days in the year abstained from labour 
and pursuits of gain &#58; what&#44; I ask you&#44; can you allege 
as a valid reason against obedience to the law&#44; when 
you reflect that by so doing you gain the favour of 
God&#44; the good&#8211;will of men&#44; and a tranquil mind &#61; 
The favour of God &#33; iiuagine only that you are laying 
up for yourselves treasures imperishable&#59; beatitude 
unending&#59; bliss without measure&#33; And by what 
means&#61; by gratifying the nobler feelings of your 
nature&#44; feelings&#44; which at last are the chief distin&#8211; 
guishing characteristics between man and beast. And 
what feelings do you mortity&#61; avarice&#44; cruelty&#44; and 
envy. And what do you sacrifice&#61; money&#44; earthly 
treasures&#44; thihgs in themselves nothing&#44; and only val&#8211; 
uable in as far as they may be the means of doing 
good. 7&#8212; And whom do you serve&#61; yourselves&#59; for all 
the benefit of virtuous actions will be yours&#59; God&#39;s 
happiness cannot be increased by any thing you can 
bestow&#44; nor can you injure Him by any misdeeds 
of yours. &#8212; And who is it that begs of you to try 
his truth &#61; it is the Giver of all&#44; to whom all are in&#8211; 
debted for their daily food&#59; as the Psalmist says &#40;cxlv.

15&#8211;16&#41;&#58; &#34;The eyes of all look with hope towards 
Thee&#44; and Thou givest them their food in its time. 
Thou openest thy hand&#44; and satisfied all that liveth 
with beneficence.&#34; And even were a man ever so 
wealthy were his means so ample that his riches 
could not be consumed in his lifetime&#44; nor in the life&#8211; 
time of his children &#58; still it is God who sends the 
rain to refresh the earth&#44; who blesses the seasons&#44; and 
crowns the summer with fruitfulness. &#8212; And who at 
last requires it of you to neglect feelings of selfish&#8211; 
ness in obedience to his laws&#61; it is the Author of all&#44; 
He in whom the world exists &#59; the Sovereign of the 
universe&#44; the Omnipotent Proprietor of the land&#44; 
the King&#44; in whose dominions you are strangers and 
tolerated sojourners. And thus we read in the por&#8211; 
tion of the law read this day&#58; 

&#34; And if you say&#44; What shall we eat in the seventh year &#61; behold 
we may not sow nor gather in our harvest. But I will command 
my blessing to you in the sixth year&#44; and it shall produce the nec&#8211; 
essary harvest for the three years. And when you sow in the 
eighth year&#44; you shall eat of the old harvest &#59; till the ninth year&#44; 
till its harvest is housed&#44; shall you eat of the old. And the land 
shall not be sold away as property&#44; for mine is the land&#44; for stran&#8211; 
gers and sojourners you are with me.&#34; Leviticus xxv. 20&#8211;23.

In this text are answered all the objections which 
the timid&#44; the avaricious&#44; and the obstinate can raise 
against the compliance with the law. &#8212; To the timid 
and avaricious&#44; God says &#58; &#34; I will command my 
blessing to you&#34; for a strict obedience. He who 
fears to starve&#44; because he neither sows nor reaps&#44; 
is thus assured that famine and deprivation will not 
happen&#44; because the land lies idle &#59; and the covetous 
one is notified that he will best consult his interest 
by doing as commanded &#59; for thus alone will his la&#8211; 
bour be blest with immense increase. &#8212; And to the 
obstinate one&#44; God says &#58; &#34; The land shall not be 
sold away as property&#44; for mine is the land&#44;&#34; in 
reply to an objection he might raise against the 
provision of the law which says&#44; that at the Jubilee 
every piece of land shall revert to the original owner. 
The latter might say &#58; &#34; The land is my own&#44; why 
shall I be prevented from exchanging it for money&#44; 
if I please &#61;&#34; to this he is answered that the land is 
not his&#44; but merely a trust&#44; permitted to remain&#44; with 
him by the real Owner of the soil&#44; the Sovereign 
Lord of all&#44; and the Legislator of Israel. &#8212; To explain 
at present the happy political effect this provision 
must have upon a people such as the Israelites were 
in Palestine by preventing the growth of a few im&#8211; 
mense estates to the detriment of the many&#44; would 
detain us too long&#59; but enough for our purpose is to 
mention&#44; that it evidently proceeded from a view to 
render the nation as nearly as possible equal&#44; that 
all might be equally free &#59; and nothing therefore is 
more true&#44; than what was said in another place&#44; that 
the Mosaic legislation was intended and well calcu&#8211; 
lated to secure the greatest happiness of the greatest

number&#44; or rather of all people. A law so wise&#44; so 
entirely based upon the purest principles of philan&#8211; 
thropy ought to be clear to us &#59; and let us therefore 
endeavour to do all that is yet left to us to do. The 
sabbathic year is&#44; alas &#33; abolished by our dispersion &#59; 
the trumpet of the Jubilee no longer proclaims lib&#8211; 
erty and freedom to the land and to all the inhabi&#8211; 
tants thereof&#59; the festive pilgrims no longer crowd thy 
highways&#44; land of Israel &#33; but still we are left fully 
able to exercise charity to the poor&#44; to comfort the 
afflicted&#44; to love our fellow&#8211;men like ourselves&#44; and 
to keep the festivals of the Lord&#44; and to celebrate 
weekly with devotion and an abstinence from labour 
the Sabbath of rest&#44; in honour of our God &#8212; undis&#8211; 
mayed by the paltry loss of gain &#8212; mindful that it is 
an institution of the Creator of all&#44; an emblem of 
everlasting rest in heaven&#44; and a memorial that Ave 
were servants in Egypt&#44; and that we were redeemed 
thence by Him&#44; who has bought us as his servants. 

O Father &#33; guide us in the way of holiness&#44; en&#8211; 
lighten our souls with thy wisdom&#44; and shield us 
from evil during our appointment on earth. And 
when our pilgrimage is ended&#44; when our task is 
done &#58; then receive us&#44; Thou Holy One &#33; in thy 
paternal embrace&#44; there to rest in happiness to eter&#8211;

THE SELECTION OF ISRAEL. 47 



DISCOURSE 

THE SELECTION OF ISRAEL. 

Sovereign of the universe &#33; we adore Thee&#44; be&#8211; 
cause of thy great goodness and glory which Thou 
hast full often displayed over us thy people. From 
Egypt Thou didst redeem us&#44; and hear our cries 
amid Â©ur afflictions&#44; because Thou wert mindful of 
the covenant Thou hadst made with our ancestors&#44; 
who walked before Thee in humility and devotion&#44; 
when darkness surrounded the earth and all its in&#8211; 
habitants. After Thou hadst rendered us free from 
earthly tyranny. Thou farther didst manifest thyself 
to us&#44; and deliver to us thy law resplendent with 
purity and holiness&#44; and thus Thou madest our minds 
also free&#44; and ourselves the subjects to thy holy will&#59; 
and in this manner Thou didst surround us with a 
shield of power&#44; defending us from the contaminat&#8211; 
ing influence of surrounding nations. Our tongues 
are too feeble to express our thanks&#44; our words are 
insufficient tÂ© declare thy goodness&#44; and our minds 
are lost in the contemplation of thy infinite wisdom. 
O then may it be thy will&#44; Everlasting One &#33; to ac&#8211; 
cept with favour the insufficient words of our mouths&#44; 
the humble thoughts of our hearts&#44; as the only ofier&#8211; 
ing we can bring upon the altar of a contrite heart&#44; 
which Thou hast promised through the mouth of thy 
prophets&#44; Thou wouldst never despise. And protect 
farther thy people&#44; and defend them from the attacks

of tlieir adversaries&#44; and fortify their hearts&#44; so that 
they may live&#44; and serve Thee&#44; till Thou sendest thy 
anointed one to promulge thy law to all the ends of 
the earth&#44; when all will serve Thee in purity and 
holiness &#33; Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

On a former occasion we proposed three questions 
for examination &#59; the first was &#58; &#34; Is it reasonable to 
suppose that God should select Israel as his peculiar 
people&#61;&#34; the second embraced the inquiry&#58; &#34; Grant&#8211; 
ed that the selection was reasonable&#44; what advantage 
did the Israelites gain thereby &#61;&#34; and the third was &#58; 
&#34; Whether the Israelites had been rejected after hav&#8211; 
ing been once chosen&#61;&#34; &#8212; The two first questions 
were amply discussed&#44; objections stated and refuted &#59; 
and we came to the conclusion&#44; that it is perfectly 
reasonable and consonant with the wisdom of God 
to believe&#44; that He educated our ancestors to be 
worthy to become his servants by a long period of 
servitude in the land of the children of Ham&#44; teach&#8211; 
ing them by a mighty display of his omnipotence&#44; 
that he is the God to whom alone adoration is due 
from all mankind. This education was&#44; as we have 
seen&#44; intended to form a people on Avhom a perma&#8211; 
nent impression could be made&#44; and who would be 
willing&#44; at all times and under all circumstances&#44; to 
serve the Lord who had redeemed them&#44; and thus to 
be for all ages the depositary of the law of God&#44; and 
a shining light to the nations of the earth. &#8212; In an&#8211; 
swer to the second question&#44; we clearly demonstrated&#44; 
that a selection by Supreme Wisdom for a purpose 
so grand is advantage enough&#44; nay&#44; more than any 

<pb n="49"/>

THE SELECTION OF ISRAEL. 49 

otlier advantage whicli we can enjoy as individuals 
or as a nation. Only think&#44; that the exertions each 
of ns makes in the service of God redounds not only 
to his own advantage&#44; but also to the civilization and 
redemption of the universe from the misrule of super&#8211; 
stition and false worships. Surely&#44; an end so great&#44; 
so universally beneficial&#44; is an object for the promo&#8211; 
tion of which the Almighty might well be supposed 
to exert his wisdom and his care&#44; and a boon suf&#8211; 
ficiently great to be desired by the most exalted 
people. This is a brief outline of the arguments 
employed to answer the first questions consonantly 
with the assumption of the Israelites&#44; that they were 
chosen as the depositary ot the divine will&#44; and that 
they have just cause to be thankful for his benefit 
thus bestowed&#44; despite of its having exposed them 
at all times to the envy and persecution of the na&#8211; 
tions among whom they dwell. &#8212; Let us now proceed 
to examine by the light of Holy Writ and common 
reason the assertion of our opponents &#58; &#34; That&#44; though 
we were once the chosen people&#44; we have ceased to 
be so since a definite period of time &#59; or&#44; as they say&#44; 
Israel the descendant of Jacob is no longer the spir&#8211; 
itual Israel.&#34; The consideration of this question in&#8211; 
volves&#44; as yo1i will easily observe&#44; something of a 
controversial nature&#44; and therefore you might sup&#8211; 
pose that it is not properly a subject with which we 
should engage in a public religious discourse&#59; but 
still it is one vitally important to us as Jews&#44; and in 
my examination therectf&#44; which I propose laying be&#8211; 
fore you&#44; I shall confine myself to the abstract ques&#8211; 
tion&#44; and if what may be said controverts the doctrines 
of other sects&#44; it shall be done without either attack&#8211;

ing them or noticing the books from which they are 
drawn and upon which they are founded. I may as 
well remark in this place&#44; that in treating upon any 
topic of our religion&#44; and in answering objections 
raised against it&#44; it is quite sufficient to answer 
merely such objections&#44; without reverting t&#8211;o the doc&#8211; 
trines of any system diiFerent from ours &#59; for our re&#8211; 
ligion is not alone excellent above any other&#44; but it 
dates also prior to any other &#59; and consequently&#44; we 
may argue the subject as though no other rule of 
faith existed. &#8212; But in some cases it may be neces&#8211; 
sary to advert to systems differing from or adverse to 
ours&#44; when it may tend to confirm ourselves the more 
strongly in our belief&#59; and then it is perfectly fair to 
discuss the subject controversially&#59; for this is the 
only way by which truth can be sifted from error. 
I do not&#44; however&#44; think it at all necessary to ofier 
an apology for the mode of discussion which I have 
adopted &#58; only to point out to you the reasons which 
usually have swayed&#44; and shall in future sway me in 
the elucidations of our holy law which I may have 
offered&#44; or may yet continue to offer to your serious 
reflection. 

Let us proceed with our examination of the ques&#8211; 
tion proposed&#58; &#34;Are the Israelites descended from 
Jacob the true spiritual Israelites&#44; or have they been 
rejected after their having been once chosen&#61;&#34; To 
come to a clear understanding on this very important 
subject&#44; it is first necessary to know what is meant by 
selection&#44; and next by the tej&#59;m rejection. &#8212; &#34;When we 
say that we were selected as the people of God&#44; we 
mean to say&#44; that we were selected&#44; chosen&#44; elected&#44; 
or withdrawn from among the multitude of nations&#44; 

<pb n="51"/>

separated from an affinity with them in their adora&#8211; 
tion of airy nothings&#44; and set apart to be servants to 
the Most High and subject to his law. It makes no 
difference by what word we designate this action of 
God&#44; whether we call it a selection&#44; choice&#44; election&#44; 
or withdrawal &#59; it was either or rather all combined. 
We say we were selected&#44; because God in his supreme 
knowledge knew the disposition of our people to be 
best adapted for his purposes&#44; as we read in Deuter&#8211; 
onomy&#44; xxxi. 21&#58; &#34;And it shall come to pass when 
the many evils and afflictions find him &#40;Israel&#41;&#44; then 
shall this song answer against him as a witness&#44; for 
it &#40;the song&#44; and consequently the law in which it is 
contained&#41;&#44; shall not be forgotten from the mouth of 
his descendants&#59; for I know his inclination&#44; as he 
doth this day&#44; before yet I have brought him into the 
land which I have sworn.&#34; &#8212; This knowledge caused 
Him to choose us then from among the nations. He 
elected us to be his people by withdrawing us from the 
wickedness which had overspread the earth. &#33;N&#39;ow&#44; 
from what has been said&#44; it must be self&#8211;evident that 
this choosing was for no other purpose than a moral 
good&#44; and not to make us worldly great &#59; and conse&#8211; 
quently&#44; Israel can be the chosen servant&#44; although 
he be poor&#44; although he be a captive in a strange 
land. It is not to be denied that we were promised 
prosperity and peace&#44; if we would be obedient to the 
commandments &#59; but all of us know&#44; how much ease 
and freedom from the cares of poverty enable the 
mind to be more devoted to the refined cares for the 
welfare of the soul&#44; since it has not then to wear it&#8211; 
self out with a constant chafing against the ills of life. 
So that worldly blessings were promised as the means 

<pb n="52"/>

52 THE SELECTION OF ISRAEL. 

for the furtherance of the grand ulterior object&#44; that 
is&#44; to raise up a holy people&#44; obedient in thought&#44; 
word&#44; and deed to the will of God. As we read 
&#40;Deut. xxvi. 18&#44; 19&#41;&#58; &#34;And the Lord hath avouched 
thee this day to be his peculiar people&#44; as He hath 
promised thee&#44; and that thou shouldst keep all his 
commandments &#59; and to make thee high above all the 
nations which He hath made&#44; in praise&#44; and in name&#44; 
and in honour&#44; and that thou mayest be a holy peo&#8211; 
ple to the Lord thy God&#44; as He hath spoken.&#34; We 
thus see&#44; that the reason of the selection was two&#8211; 
fold &#58; first&#44; we were to become through obedience 
holy to God&#44; and&#44; secondly&#44; to deserve happiness and 
to reach felicity through holiness. &#8212; The question now 
arises&#58; &#34;Was this holiness to be permanent or tem&#8211; 
porary&#61;&#34; By holiness is meant&#44; nothing else than an 
obedience to the divine will so often and so uniformly 
exercised&#44; as to invest the doers thereof with a pecu&#8211; 
liar capacity to merit&#44; and to receive&#44; the favour of 
God &#59; and to resist more easily&#44; than others not doing 
so or not so far advanced&#44; the pressure of tempta&#8211; 
tions&#59; and to subject ourselves with more readiness 
and cheerfulness to whatever good or evil the Al&#8211; 
mighty may bestow &#59; not to rise above ourselves when 
successful&#44; nor to sink into gloom and despair when 
reverses come over us. It is&#44; moreover&#44; evident&#44; that 
if any course of life&#44; being in conformity to the once 
declared will of God&#44; confers this state of holy feel&#8211; 
ings at one period of the world&#44; it must continue to 
exert the same influence to the end of time. Or&#44; in 
other words&#44; since it was declared to be leading a 
holy life in the time of Moses&#44; if a man acted conform&#8211; 
ably to the law revealed from Sinai &#58; it follows&#44; that 

<pb n="53"/>

THE SELECTION OF ISRAEL. 53 

to act according to tlie same law at this moment is 
also leading a holy life&#44; unless it can be demonstrated&#44; 
that at any one time since the promulgation of the 
Decalogue&#44; the Almighty descended in his glory and 
solemnly abrogated the law He then so solemnly 
enacted&#44; when our forefathers stood at the foot of 
Sinai and saw the lightning flash&#44; heard the thunder 
roll&#44; and felt the mountain move. But where do we 
find any evidence of such an occurrence &#61; At what 
period was there such a display of universal&#44; public&#44; 
and intelligible legislation of a new code&#61; Truth 
will say&#58; &#34; At no time&#44; in no place.&#34; And as the 
law was enacted for the purpose of being obeyed&#44; or 
else its enactment would have been useless&#44; and as at 
no time it has been abolished &#58; to observe its precepts 
is leading a holy life &#59; and consequently&#44; Israel will 
be a holy people&#44; if they continue to live according 
to the dictates of divine holiness. To sum up all that 
has been said above&#44; in a few words&#44; we may state &#58; 
that the giving of the law was the virtual selection 
of Israel&#44; and an obedience to this law confers upon 
Israel the just appellation of God&#39;s peculiar people &#59; 
since at no time has any other people acted according 
to the law given to them&#44; and never could it show any 
reason&#44; why any other law should be considered as 
the true divine legislation. 

We must now examine what can be meant by &#34;Is&#8211; 
rael is rejected&#44;&#61;&#34; From the preceding it must be 
evident that Israel&#39;s rejection can only be imagined 
as at all possible by a promulgation of a new code of 
laws&#44; by refusing which they place themselves out of 
the pale of divine favour. Farther&#44; the evidence of 
such a promulgation must be so clear&#44; as to leave no 

5&#42; 

<pb n="54"/>

54 THE SELECTION OP ISRAEL. 

doubt upon our minds as to its correctness. But to 
imagine even that a new code would or could be 
given&#44; is to admit a caprice in the divine will&#44; a vacil&#8211; 
lation in the judgment of God&#44; which&#44; far be such 
thought from us&#44; would invest the Divine Essence 
with all the imperfections of humanity&#59; whereas we 
are clearly told&#44; that &#34; God is no man that He could 
lie&#44; and not a son of man that He could repent.&#34; 
Our assumption&#44; therefore&#44; based as it is upon reason 
and revelation&#44; would in itself alone be sufficient to 
do away with the necessity for any farther argument. 
Yet where there are objections raised&#44; it is proper to 
give them their utmost weight&#44; the more radically to 
remove them. So then&#44; admit that a new legislation 
were possible&#44; still it must be confessed&#44; upon an im&#8211; 
partial investigation&#44; that the fundamental principles 
of the moral and even of the ceremonial laws of our 
religion admit of no change. Let us take&#44; for exam&#8211; 
ple&#44; the first commandment proclaimed from Sinai &#58; 
&#34;I am the Lord thy God&#44;&#34; which as you know is an 
announcement of our obligation to believe in a Di&#8211; 
vinity&#44; everlasting&#44; unchanging&#44; and indivisible. Is 
it possible that any new code &#40;even let it also ema&#8211; 
nate from God&#44; which we however think&#8211; impossible&#41; 
could contain any thing at variance with this princi&#8211; 
ple&#61; Can God himself be at one time inx &#39;n&#44; Adonai 
Echad&#44; the only everlasting Being&#44; and cease to be so 
at another time &#61; Ay&#44; and this is the essence of the 
law&#44; to know that there is an only God&#44; everlasting 
and unchangeable. Creator of all. Ruler of all&#44; Good 
above all&#44; and Just above all &#59; who&#44; though incom&#8211; 
prehensible&#44; exists through all eternity&#44; and to whom 
our conceptions of time&#44; age&#44; and change&#44; are inappli&#8211;

cable. &#8212; Let us proceed to the second commandment 
and its specifications&#58; &#34;Thou shalt have no other 
gods before me&#59; thou shalt not make thyself any 
image&#59; thou shalt not bow down to them&#44; and shalt 
not worship them.&#34; This too is unchangeable in its 
nature. For as God is ever the same&#44; so it must al&#8211; 
ways be wrong&#44; under any circumstance&#44; to associate 
with Him&#44; be his name praised for ever more&#44; any 
other existing or imaginary being in worship&#44; as by 
no contingency whatever can aught but the Creator 
and Father of all be God. &#8212; Again &#58; &#34;Eemember the 
Sabbath to keep it holy.&#34; This precept too is im&#8211; 
mutable &#59; from the words of the holy text it appears 
that its institution was based upon the history of the 
creation&#44; and to remind us for ever&#44; that after all had 
been created as now ordered around us in six days&#44; 
the seventh was no day of creation&#44; or&#44; to use the 
words of Scripture&#58; &#34;After God had finished on the 
seventh day the work He had done. He rested on the 
seventh day from all the work He had done.&#34; Now 
it is evident that the reasons assigned for the observ&#8211; 
ance of the seventh day apply to no other day of the 
week&#59; for all six were days of creation&#44; and only the 
seventh alone was a day of abstinence from work. In 
fact&#44; the etynlological meaning of the word Sabbath&#44; 
from the Hebrew verb &#40;shabote&#41;&#44; to cease&#44; is ces&#8211; 
sation&#44; and only by inference rest&#44; for rest is the con&#8211; 
sequence of a cessation from labour. Another reason 
given for the observance of the seventh day is found 
in the repetition of the Decalogue &#40;Deut. v. 15&#41; &#58; 
&#34;And thou shalt remember that thou hast been a 
slave in the land of Egypt&#44; and that the Lord thy God 
brought thee out from there&#44; with a mighty hand and

a stretched out arm&#44; therefore the Lord thy God hath 
commanded thee to make the Sabbath&#8211;day.&#34; The 
connection of this reason with the other&#44; referring to 
the creation&#44; has been explained by me in another 
place&#44; and need therefore not be repeated here. But 
from the whole it will appear&#44; that the institution of 
the seventh day of rest was to be permanent and un&#8211; 
changed&#44; as the reasons given are also unchangeable&#44; 
to wit&#44; the creation in six days and the redemption 
from Egypt&#44; since things past are from their nature 
not liable to be changed&#44; because what is once done 
cannot be undone&#59; for even if the effect be removed 
the event itself has occurred. We therefore find in 
our prayers the following formula for the Idddush of 
the Sabbath&#58; &#34;Blessed art Thou&#44; Lord our God&#44; 
Sovereign of the universe&#44; who hast sanctified us 
with thy commandments&#44; and hast found delight in 
us&#44; and hast caused us to inherit with love and favour 
thy holy Sabbath&#44; as a memorial of the work of the 
creation &#59; for it is the first of the days of holy convo&#8211; 
cation&#44; in memory of our redemption from Egypt.&#34; &#8212; 
The precept &#34;Honour thy father and mother&#34; must 
find a place in any divine legislation. &#34;Thou shalt 
not commit murder &#59; thou shalt not commit adultery &#59; 
thou shalt not steal&#59;&#34; &#34;you shall not defile yourselves 
by any creeping thing&#59;&#34; &#34;you shall not lie&#59;&#34; &#34;not 
follow the actions of the people of Egypt&#44;&#34; and in fact 
all the prohibitions&#44; and nearly all the positive com&#8211; 
mandments&#44; will be found upon examination to be of 
that kind&#44; that no law whatever&#44; if of divine origin&#44; 
could by any possibility gainsay them. The proof is 
easy&#44; but would require more time than can be de&#8211; 
voted to it now &#59; and each of vou can no doubt follow

out the argument by his own reflection&#44; Now it fol&#8211; 
lows&#44; that any law to be divine must be just such a 
one as we possess &#59; and any law differing therefrom 
in any material point&#44; must be&#44; of necessity&#44; not of di&#8211; 
vine origin. For it is impossible to conceive how 
both propositions can be true&#44; that God is One&#44; Eter&#8211; 
nal&#44; Unchangeable&#44; and Indivisible&#44; &#8212; and that He is 
divided&#44; subject to change&#44; and consisting of a plu&#8211; 
rality. &#8212; It cannot be said&#44; that we must keep Sabbath 
on the seventh day&#44; to celebrate weekly the wonder 
of the creation&#44; and to change it to the sixth&#44; first&#44; or 
any other day&#44; to celebrate any thing else. &#8212; It is in&#8211; 
compatible with reason to admit that God instituted 
the prohibition of certain species of animals&#44; because 
they would contaminate us&#44; a&#44;nd that He should&#44; for 
no reason that we can discover&#44; abolish the prohibi&#8211; 
tion. &#8212; It is not creditable to divine wisdom to institute 
the order of priesthood in the family of Aaron&#44; and 
then to admit every one to the privilege&#44; again with&#8211; 
out any reason&#44; &#8212; to proclaim statutes and judgments 
as his will&#44; and to revoke them at his caprice without 
any ground for such a change existing&#44; at least such 
a ground as could satisfy our reason. &#8212; But as God&#39;s 
ways are just&#44; as in Him there is no fault nor evil&#44; we 
must come to the conclusion&#44; that such inconsisten&#8211; 
cies are not of his sanctioning&#44; and that whatever of 
error does exist&#44; is of human invention &#59; whatever of 
discrepancy to his law may be found has been intro&#8211; 
duced by men&#44; and not by the All&#8211;wise&#44; Unchange&#8211; 
able One. &#8212; But even yield all which our opponents 
can possibly demand &#59; admit for a moment that things 
can be changed&#58; we would ask&#44; Where is the evi&#8211; 
dence of such change&#61; where is the warrant that 

<pb n="58"/>

we may depart from the ways of our ancestors &#61; We 
may safely say&#44; that there is no book warranting a 
belief in a plurality of the deity&#44; which claims to be 
of divine revelation &#59; there is no such code authoriz&#8211; 
ing the transmutation of the Sabbath &#59; there is no 
law permitting things prohibited in the Pentateuch. 
And if we admit the authority of this book&#44; then it 
follows that unless there be a superior authority&#44; no 
other law can claim our submission&#59; and as there is 
no other law&#44; consequently the law of the Torah is 
yet&#44; and will be&#44; binding on us and all who may join 
us. If now it is meant by &#34;Israel is rejected&#44;&#34; that 
the law of Israel has ceased to be the law of God &#58; 
then has it been already established beyond contra&#8211; 
diction&#44; that this position is false and erroneous. But 
if it is meant to be understood that we have ceased 
to be the favourite people of God&#44; and that others 
acting differently from us have now become the elect&#58; 
then we are also prepared with proof to rebut the as&#8211; 
sertion. Yet even say&#44; that we no longer enjoy any 
peculiar favour&#44; ay&#44; take all that is claimed&#44; that the 
nations of the earth have been chosen &#58; still we will 
reject all overtures to join ourselves to others&#44; we 
will resist amalgamation with all our heart&#44; with all 
our soul&#44; and with all our might. No &#33; never be it 
said that we serve our God from interest&#44; or that we 
are envious that others too are chosen&#44; even if we be 
rejected. &#34;Would to God that all the inhabitants of 
the earth were living in his service&#44; walking before 
Him in fear&#44; truth&#44; and sincerity&#33; would that our 
eyes might see&#44; our minds be convinced that the world 
were filled with true adorers&#44; even if we were&#44; as we 
are now&#44; poor&#44; humble&#44; trodden under foot&#44; and de&#8211;

spised&#33; Ay&#44; if the annihilation of our national ex&#8211; 
istence were to be the forfeit&#44; let the partial evil be 
compensated by the universal good. Come then 
weal or wo&#44; prosperity or affliction&#44; life or death&#44; be 
it ours to uphold the true law &#59; let us be sunken but 
not degraded &#59; let us even from amidst the depth of 
affliction cry to our God&#44; and proclaim aloud his 
wonders which He has done for our ancestors&#44; in re&#8211; 
deeming them from the bonds of slavery&#44; and giving 
them a law to free their souls from the trammels of 
sin and the thraldom of superstition. But no &#33; Is&#8211; 
rael is not rejected &#33; Israel is not cast off&#33; Israel is 
yet the chosen people &#59; and the Israelites descended 
from Jacob are still the bodily as also the spiritual 
Israel. &#8212; For know that even at the time when through 
our great crimes we had doomed ourselves to punish&#8211; 
ment&#44; at the very time when prophets&#44; inspired by 
the Supreme Judge&#44; denounced dispersion and cap&#8211; 
tivity over us&#44; Jeremiah spoke thus by divine inspi&#8211; 
ration &#58; 

V 

&#34;Thus saith the Lord&#44; If the heavens can be measured above&#44; 
and the fastness of the earth be searched out beneath&#58; then also 
will I reject the whole seed of Israel&#44; for all which they have done&#44; 
saith the Lord.&#34;&#8211; xxxi. 37. 

It were futile&#44; and insulting to your understanding&#44; 
to prove to you by demonstration that the Israel here 
spoken of is the seed of Jacob&#44; whom the Lord called 
Israel &#59; since the whole context evidently alludes to

uo other. It is therefore perfectly plain&#44; that we are 
promised that&#44; despite of our transgressions&#44; we shall 
not be cast off utterly&#44; nor ever be suffered to be lost 
among the nations &#59; as we also read in Lev. xxvi. 
44&#58; &#34;And for all that&#44; when they be in the land of 
their enemies&#44; I will not reject them&#44; nor despise them 
to destroy them utterly&#44; to break my covenant with 
them&#59; for I am the Lord their God.&#34; Here as&#8211;ain 
is a promise to the bodily Israel&#44; who though in the 
land of their enemies shall not be totally rejected. 

Having thus shown what is meant by the terms 
selection and rejection&#44; it must strike you all&#44; that it is 
perfectly reasonable and consistent with revelation 
to admit the first&#44; but utterly repugnant both to rea&#8211; 
son and revelation to admit the other. It is&#44; never&#8211; 
theless&#44; very evident why it is constantly repeated 
that we are rejected&#58; it is to induce us to forsake 
the Grod whom we adore&#44; the law that we love&#44; and 
to mingle with the nations&#44; to become an integral 
part of the great mass of the human family&#44; and no 
longer to exhibit the spectacle of a people&#44; dispersed 
all over the earth&#44; still one and united by a belief in 
the ancient faith&#44; upholdeu by a hope of better days. 
But it is our duty to reject such calls&#44; whatever ad&#8211; 
vantages may be offered to us thereby &#59; for we must 
be convinced from the whole tenor of our history&#44; 
that we never can gain the favour of God by apos&#8211; 
tacy&#44; that is&#44; by forsaking that law which He has 
established as the standard of right. Our opponents&#44; 
however&#44; say&#44; that if it were true&#44; that we yet con&#8211; 
tinue to be the chosen people&#44; that if our law yet 
continued to be the law of God&#44; we would not be 
suffered to be in captivity and dispersed in every

corner of the globe&#59; and they maintain that we are 
suffering&#44; because we have rejected a better law&#44; and 
have done certain wrongs which they lay as sins 
against us. Now&#44; these assertions might hold good&#44; 
if a better law actually existed&#44; or if it were true that 
our dispersion had not been foretold by our own 
prophets&#44; denounced as an inevitable consequence 
of the non&#8211;observance of that very law&#44; which it is 
alleged has been abrogated. &#8212; The first assertion we 
have already proved as unfounded&#44; for no new law 
whatever has been promulgated&#44; much less a better 
one &#59; and to the second&#44; we answer&#44; that from Moses 
down to Malachi punishment has been denounced 
against transgression&#44; both punishment in this life 
and after death&#59; and by most of the prophets our 
very captivity and dispersion all over the earth have 
been especially predicted in the manner we see it be&#8211; 
fore us this day. Whatever other crimes then we 
may have committed&#44; it is sufficient to account for 
our situation by referring to the constant infraction 
of the Mosaic law&#44; which we and our ancestors have 
been guilty of&#59; and consequently we must infer&#44; that a 
farther dereliction will be still more signally avenged&#59; 
for God is just and true&#44; and no untruth and injustice 
can stand befbre Him. And let &#8211;not the wicked flatter 
himself with the idea that he will escape the punish&#8211; 
ment under which Israel is suffering&#44; by leaving the 
holy church for a junction with the multitude&#59; he 
will be&#44; it is true&#44; no longer a captive&#44; at least in its 
own estimation &#59; but there are other pains far more to 
be dreaded than even death itself inflicted by the per&#8211; 
secutor for an adherence to the law. &#8212; No&#44; brethren&#44; 
the law of God is not abolished&#59; Israel is not rejected&#59;

but only the light of the one is dimmed&#44; because the 
other has sinned. But the day will come&#44; when the 
lustre of both will be resplendent beyond compare&#44; 
when God will be glorified&#44; his law revered&#44; and it be 
acknowledged by all&#44; that we are God&#39;s people&#44; a peo&#8211; 
ple faithful to the last&#44; faithful in having so truly pre&#8211; 
served the law intrusted to us as a deposit&#44; amid so 
many difficulties&#59; and faithful and true in having 
resisted for centuries of persecution&#44; darkness&#44; and 
worldly allurement&#44; mingling with other nations&#44; 
whose heart is not entire with the Lord our God. 
Then&#44; indeed&#44; will all the earth be an altar to the 
Lord &#59; then&#44; indeed&#44; will lie be declared&#44; as in truth 
He is&#44; the great King&#44; whose glory fills the universe&#33; 
It is in our power to do much towards this great 
end by an observance of the law&#59; and wherever there 
is in our captivity a temple of the Most High&#44; there 
let us assemble&#44; and proclaim that we will be per&#8211; 
severing in the service of God till the end of time. 
Whenever then a new house of prayer is erected&#44; let 
us regard it as an approach to the great end&#44; as a step 
nearer to the glorious consummation&#44; and let us upon 
every such occasion pray for the welfare of the com&#8211;

vice of the Lord. &#8212; The present holy day is&#44; as you

and it has been chosen by a neighbouring congrega&#8211;

tude &#33; If we look upon ourselves as members of the 
human family at large&#44; we will&#44; and must&#44; feel our&#8211; 
selves impelled by gratitude towards the Giver of 
light and life&#44; who&#44; in making man after his image&#44; 
rendered him fit for the habitation of a spirit of wis&#8211; 
dom and intellect &#59; and not only gave to his outward 
frame a beauty of form superior to that of any other 
animal&#44; but also infused therein a soul&#44; a living prin&#8211; 
ciple&#44; an intelligent mind&#44; a spark divine&#44; towering 
above all in majesty and strength. But if we go a 
step farther and view ourselves not only as men in 
general&#44; but as Israelites&#44; we shall have yet more 
cause for an indulgence of our gratitude towards the 
Supreme Disposer of all. For though the human 
mind reaches wonderfully far by its own researches&#44; 
and embraces much by its natural organization &#58; still 
without farther assistance&#44; emanating immediately 
from the Divine Essence&#44; it is but too apt to be misled 
by the semblance of good&#44; and is often induced to 
mistake the &#39;wrong for what is right&#44; because its means 
of information are insufiicient or inaccurate. Thus&#44; 
the most wonderful and comprehensive intellect&#44; when 
unassisted by instruction&#44; is apt to be in error&#59; since 
it is next to impossible&#44; during our short stay on 
earth&#44; to obtain sufficient data to form a correct judg&#8211; 
ment upon every occasion. And this was wisely so 
ordained&#59; for since men are unequal in their capacity&#44; 
the wise few would under other circumstances have 
obtained unlimited sway over their fellows&#59; and as 
the wise too can be wicked&#44; they might have dictated 
laws to the rest of mankind&#44; whose utility&#44; to say the 
least&#44; would have been questionable. But now&#44; as it 
is the fixed law of humanity&#44; that we are liable to err&#44; 

<pb n="65"/>

THE BLESSINGS OF REVELATION. 65 

the assertions of every man&#44; no matter how superior 
maybe his endowments&#44; will always be received with 
caution&#59; and&#44; therefore&#44; if the good fail often of doing 
all the good they propose&#44; the wicked are full as often 
thwarted in their evil endeavours. So we have in 
this case another exemplification of the fact&#44; that there 
exists no evil which is not counterbalanced by an 
equal or even larger share of good. All this&#44; how&#8211; 
ever&#44; goes to show&#44; that human reason is fallible and 
of itself insufficient to perceive the light which it is 
able to acquire &#59; and we find&#44; therefore&#44; that men&#44; who 
have even made great progress in inventions and ac&#8211; 
quirement of sciences and knowledge&#44; have very often 
been swayed in their moral conduct by unbelief&#44; su&#8211; 
perstition&#44; or bigotry. That is to say&#44; some men wise 
in worldly matters have had no adequate perception 
of the nature of the Deity&#44; as we find it declared in 
Scriptures&#44; nor could their morality be compared to 
the standard laid down in the law of God. Take&#44; 
for instance&#44; the greatest and best of heathen philos&#8211; 
ophers&#44; Socrates&#44; and admit that he proclaimed noth&#8211; 
ing but what his inventive genius taught him&#44; and 
assume that there is no exaggeration in the accounts 
we have of his virtues and resignation&#44; of which lat&#8211; 
ter&#44; however there must always be some doubt&#58; still 
his notions of God were far from the ideas as we 
have them handed down to us through Moses. Soc&#8211; 
rates&#44; as we are told&#44; believed in a God&#44; the Creator 
of the world&#44; and the Judge of mankind&#59; still he 
regarded the heathen gods as powers&#44; though subor&#8211; 
dinate to the Supreme Being. jN&#39;ow&#44; as I have said&#44; 
Socrates&#44; of all the heathens&#44; approximated truth 
nearer than any other&#59; and yet we find that he did

not reach all the truth. He was endowed by God 
with great discernment&#44; with acute perception&#44; with 
reasoning powers of no common kind&#59; still he hicktd 
the direct revelation&#44; and thus he remained imper&#8211; 
fect&#44; when he had arrived so far already&#44; that the 
next step would have been truth itself. lie might 
have argued&#44; since God created all and judges all&#44; lie 
needs not the assistance of subordinate powers &#59; and 
since He alone is perfect and supremely wise&#44; He can 
have no associates in his dominion &#59; as our beautiful 
hymn so elegantly says&#58; &#34; And He is One&#44; and there 
is no second to be associated with Him in the govern&#8211; 
ment&#59;&#34; and consequently&#44; no other being&#44; save God 
alone&#44; deserves the worship of man. E&#39;evertheless&#44; 
with all his powers of reasoning&#44; Socrates missed the 
great end&#59; he imagined&#44; as said&#44; a Creator&#44; associated 
with beings of an inferior&#44; yet of a substantial and 
active power&#44; and he worshipped the idols of the 
Grecians&#44; and respected their tenets. If now&#44; the 
wisest of heathens erred so far&#44; how miserable must 
have been the mental state of those not so greatly 
favoured&#61; if a Socrates&#39;s reasoning was insufficient to 
teach true wisdom&#44; where can we look for it among 
the great multitude &#61; It is&#44; therefore&#44; that we Israel&#8211; 
ites should reflect upon the great benefit conferred 
upon us by the divine revelation in our possession&#44; 
wdiere we are taught truth without disguise&#44; morality 
without alloy&#44; and religion without superstition &#33; The 
Bible teaches us to acknowledge the existence of a 
Being&#44; infinite in time&#44; and greatness&#44; and wisdom&#44; 
existing before any thing else existed &#59; the Creator of 
matter&#44; the Organizer of nature&#44; the Preserver of all 
things created&#44; and the Governor of nature as or&#8211;

ganized&#59; farther&#44; that nature&#44; organization&#44; and in 
short&#44; all existing things&#44; and all the universe&#44; are 
necessarily dependent upon Him&#44; and npon Him alone&#44; 
but that neither they&#44; nor any thing else which can 
be conceived&#44; are necessary to his existence or his 
happiness. So that we can very easily imagine God 
as existing without organization of any thing material&#44; 
but that it is utterly impossible to imagine a world 
without a Creator. This Creator so great is also wise 
beyond compare. He is the Author of wisdom&#44; con&#8211; 
sequently He is the wisest of all. He exists in every 
thing&#44; and every thing exists in Him&#59; consequently 
the actions of all&#44; and the thoughts of all are known 
to Him. And as his knowledge and greatness per&#8211; 
vade all&#44; it can cost Him no effort to effect any thing 
which may please his will&#44; and it requires no applica&#8211; 
tion of industry to make himself acquainted with the 
thoughts and actions of his creatures. &#8212; This is the 
God of Abraham&#44; of Isaac&#44; and of Jacob&#59; He is the 
adored and adorable One&#44; who displayed to us his 
power and his goodness&#59; and He is the Legislator 
who dictated to the people that He had chosen the 
law which He desired them to observe&#44; that through 
it they might obtain the enviable distinction of be&#8211; 
ing the wisest of nations&#44; and the people most nearly 
connected through actions of piety&#44; and holiness with 
their almighty Father. &#8212; We ought&#44; therefore&#44; to dis&#8211; 
play&#44; by all means in our power&#44; our gratitude for 
these signal benefits&#44; and we are ungrateful&#44; if we 
omit any opportunity by which we can show&#44; that 
we are not undeserving of the law which was given 
us&#44; that we might&#44; by observing it&#44; become a light 
to the nations of the earth. To prove that our re&#8211;

devotion &#8212; piety &#8212; the love of God &#8212; peace and con&#8211; 
tentment are to be preferred to mental darkness &#8212; 
superstition &#8212; immoral ity &#8212; idolatry &#8212; strife and war&#8211; 
fare&#33; And the effects of our law are the good things 
we have enumerated&#44; tlie want of it has ever pro&#8211; 
duced the opposite effects&#59; and though among hea&#8211; 
thens we meet with examples of virtue&#44; disinterested&#8211; 
ness&#44; and humanity&#44; still we find them so blended 
with grosser desires and superstitious practices&#44; that 
we can by no means view the virtues as at all per&#8211; 
taining to heathenism&#59; on the contrary&#44; we must re&#8211; 
gard them as exceptions sometimes met with&#44; of evil 
even being occasionally the producer of good&#44; or 
rather of evil not being altogether able to destroy 
totally the inclination to virtue and goodness. Be&#8211; 
sides&#44; it must be borne in mind&#44; that the Grecian and 
Romans&#44; those nations of antiquity of whom we have 
the most authentic accounts&#44; were in all likelihood 
greatly indebted for much of their knowledge of 
morality to the Bible&#44; although it may not have 
reached them directly. It is well known&#44; that for 
centuries anteceding the birth of Socrates there was 
a constant intercourse carried on between the coun&#8211; 
tries of Asia Minor and Greece and its colonies. 
Many of the Grecians doubtless often appeared at the 
courts of the Persian kings and their satraps&#59; these 
were all&#44; more or less&#44; acquainted with the Jews&#44; and&#44;

therefore&#44; the Jewish law also must have become 
known&#44; and when known it must of necessity have 
attracted attention&#44; if not admiration. ISTow&#44; if even 
the Grecians never associated with the Jews directly&#44; 
wliich is&#44; however&#44; too improbable to be believed&#44; 
still they doubtless became familiar with the law&#44; as 
said&#44; at least secondhandedly. Farther&#44; it is likely&#44; 
that a learned man catching a glimpse&#44; as it were&#44; 
of those sublime truths to which the mass of his 
countrymen were strangers&#44; may have promulgated 
them&#44; to increase his own importance&#44; as an emana&#8211; 
tion of his own fertile invention&#44; or as the special 
revelation of a deity or a demon&#44; made known to him 
alone. However&#44; we will not insist upon this hypoth&#8211; 
esis as a solution of the doctrines arrived at by the 
Greek philosophers&#44; but merely to show to the un&#8211; 
believer&#44; that the existence of doctrines of a nobler 
cast than the vulgar superstition generally acquiesced 
in can be accounted for&#44; on rational grounds&#44; as be&#8211; 
ing derived mediately or immediately from the great 
source of wisdom which now illumines the world&#59; 
and let me add&#44; that this point has been too much 
overlooked by those great admirers of heathen phi&#8211; 
losophy who&#44; one would judge from their mode of 
speaking&#44; had discovered in the remains of Socrates&#44; 
Plato&#44; Aristotle&#44; and Cicero&#44; perfect substitutes for 
the sublime truths of revelation. It belongs not to 
our discussion in this place to review this subject in 
all its bearings&#44; although a great deal more could be 
urired in favour of our views in connexion with this 
very topic. But even if we allow the intuitive knowl&#8211; 
ectge of the learned men of antiquity and of the pres&#8211; 
ent time&#44; they merely prove the exceptions to the

general rule&#44; which we have so often laid down and 
maintained&#44; that the Bible is the only source of true 
civilization and piety&#44; and that every system&#44; how&#8211; 
ever great and ingenious&#44; is far behind it in beneficial 
effects upon the general welfare and salvation of man&#8211; 
kind. 

Thus also it is not to be denied&#44; that under the do&#8211; 
minion of the Bible&#44; or in other words in the theo&#8211; 
cratic commonwealth of the Israelites&#44; crimes were 
committed&#44; a state of warfare indulged in&#44; violence 
perpetrated&#44; and idolatry introduced&#59; but this was 
not in consequence of the divine legislation&#44; but in 
palpable and open violation of it&#59; and how signally 
was this aberration avenged &#33; Our sacred temple was 
levelled to the ground&#44; our cities were burnt&#44; our 
youths were led to the scaifold&#44; our wise men stabbed 
and slaughtered&#44; and our priests made the victims 
upon the very altar where they administered the sac&#8211; 
rifices of the Lord&#44; and the remaining few were led 
into captivity. The light of the law has&#44; through our 
sins&#44; become dimmed&#59; the name of Israel has been 
rendered a reproach and a byword&#59; aiid the worship 
of the Most High has&#44; alas &#33; to our shame&#44; be it 
spoken&#44; been more and more looked upon with in&#8211; 
difference &#33; We have been punished for our sins&#59; but 
instead of our repenting and acting difierently from 
the conduct of our ancestors&#44; who perished in their 
transgressions&#44; we have added wilful wickedness to 
their trespasses&#44; and thus perpetuated the wrath which 
had been poured out as a warning to others&#44; as the 
admonishing voifte of Heaven&#58; &#34;Go ye and repent&#44; 
and why will ye die&#44; house of Israel &#33;&#34; It will 
therefore be evident&#44; that not by fault of revelation

have crimes been multiplied&#44; but in despite of its 
beneficent precepts&#59; and therefore the assertion made 
in the beginning of this address holds true&#44; that we 
are bound by the strongest bonds of gratitude to tes&#8211; 
tify our thanks to our almighty Redeemer for the 
great benefit of a revealed religion so bountifully be&#8211; 
stowed&#44; and to demonstrate ourselves not unworthy 
of a gift so great&#44; which is to lead us in this life&#44; which 
is to watch over us when we lay ourselves in the sleep 
of death&#44; and which is to delight us when we awake 
to everlasting life&#44; to unending blessedness&#33; Now&#44; 
from the very nature of man&#44; that is to say from his 
utter incapacity to render God any benefit&#44; the na&#8211; 
ture of the gratitude can easily be inferred&#44; that is&#44; 
xnan to show that he is deserving of the gift we have 
just mentioned&#44; should actually prize it&#44; look upon 
it as the best gift Heaven could bestow to bless man&#8211; 
kind&#44; and prove this regard by a due observance of 
the divine precepts. In short&#44; Israel&#44; to be truly 
grateful&#44; should be truly a faithful&#44; obedient&#44; and 
pious people&#59; no other means exist to prove that 
God&#39;s gift was not unworthily bestowed. But un&#8211; 
fortunately a change has come over the face of the 
earth&#44; and the dark ages of superstition&#44; of intoler&#8211; 
ance and persecution have been succeeded by the 
more direful&#39; one of unbelief&#44; of irreligion&#44; and licen&#8211;. 
tiousness &#59; and a rational belief and a filial devotion 
to our God and Father are looked on with contempt&#44; 
and the servants of God are held in little repute&#44; their 
doctrines find but unwilling listeners&#44; and religion is&#44; 
to use the emphatic words of Scripture&#44; thrown be&#8211; 
hind the back of each of us as something too insig&#8211; 
nificant to deserve the attention of a race so far ad&#8211;

vanced in science and knowledge as to be beyond 
instruction&#44; as too elevated to need to be taught of 
Heaven. This is a mournfal picture&#44; but to our 
shame be it said&#44; a true one nevertheless of the spirit 
of our age&#44; and of that which has immediately pre&#8211; 
ceded us. Doctrines have been promulgated&#44; and 
promulgated too with a zeal which would have graced 
a holy cause&#44; which&#44; if followed up in general prac&#8211; 
tice&#44; would totally subvert religion&#44; would sever as it 
were the bond which unites man to God&#44; and would 
cast loose the ties of civilized society&#44; and would give 
free vent to the unbridled action of the basest passions. 
Ay&#44; and we Israelites especially have felt the sting of 
the serpent of unbelief which has been so dreadfully 
active &#59; we&#44; who of all men should have been the best 
prepared to resist&#44; have yielded ourselves basely&#44; have 
been overcome without a struggle almost. It is use&#8211; 
less to flatter ourselves&#44; that we are not open to the 
reproach of shameful dereliction from the good ways 
of our ancestors&#59; for we have retrograded&#44; and fallen 
off with dreadful rapidity from the path of righte&#8211; 
ousness. &#8212; Apostacy also has become so common&#44; as 
scarcely to excite any longer the least degree of sur&#8211; 
prise&#59; we have quite contentedly mixed ourselves 
with the nations &#59; we have studiously concealed our 
being Israelites &#59; we have carefully copied the follies 
and vices of others&#44; even whilst we have neglected to 
imitate their virtues &#59; and&#44; to be brief&#44; we must be 
silent&#44; we cannot gainsay&#44; when we are told that infi&#8211; 
delity has made fearful progress among us. &#8212; We are 
ignorant&#44; and wish not to be informed &#59; we are spoken 
to&#44; and will not listen &#59; we are admonished to beware 
of the wrath to come&#44; but too much of the world is

In our hearts&#59; too many occupations are to be at&#8211; 
tended to &#59; too much wealth must be amassed &#59; too 
much pleasure must be tasted&#59; too many passions 
must be gratified&#59; too much ambition must be nur&#8211; 
tured&#59; too much greatness must be acquired&#59; and at 
last too much pride has taken its abode within our 
souls&#44; and has raised such a tumult of passions&#44; of 
grovelling low desires&#44; of exalted ambitious views&#44; 
of self&#8211;importance&#44; that nothing can be heeded but 
what relates to ourselves&#44; as though each individual 
were all in all&#44; and all beyond him as nothing in the 
balance. &#34;We talk of the light of science as incom&#8211; 
patible with revelation &#59; and when asked&#44; why &#61; we 
begin to hold forth about the absurdity of one part of 
belief&#44; about the blind devotion to dogmas&#44; acquies&#8211; 
cence in things not understood &#59; and&#44; strange incon&#8211; 
sistency &#33; those very ones that speak so much of the 
incompatibility of religion with the light of science 
never did examine the doctrines of faith for them&#8211; 
selves&#59; they are ignorant of the Bible&#44; and&#44; more 
strange to say&#44; of the very sciences which they pro&#8211; 
fess to venerate so much &#59; and all their haranguing 
about the absurdity of belief is founded upon hear&#8211; 
say&#44; or upon the assumption that it is unwise to sup&#8211; 
pose that laws enacted three thousand years ago 
should be Useful still. It .is marvellous how little 
reason there is for infidelity&#44; how weak the grounds 
are upon which unbelief rests for support&#44; and how 
the contrary of the foregoing assertions is true &#59; for 
all science tends to confirm the truth of the law of 
God&#44; if properly examined&#44; without the jaundiced 
view&#44; without the hoodwinking of infidelity. But 
nothing checks us when we are determined to follow

the bent of our inclinations&#59; every tiling is then 
made subservient to our preconceived opinions &#59; and 
it is almost useless to endeavour to argue unbelief 
out of its erroneous notions. Conviction is spurned 
as something contaminating&#44; and sound argument is 
met by abuse &#59; and if even the last is encountered by 
mildness and meekness&#44; still a deaf ear is turned&#44; so 
long as the volcano of passions has not exhausted its 
desolating fire. Is it now wonderful that the teachers 
of the law are silent&#61; that their spirit becomes faint&#61; 
that they almost determine to retire from the contest 
and to mourn in secret over the depravity of the age&#44; 
over the vineyard of the Lord because it is desolate &#61; 
Truly&#44; brethren&#44; this is a time of great evil&#59; daily&#44; 
matters are assuming a more dreary aspect&#59; those 
who formerly yet adhered a little are now also falling

children the way of godliness&#44; or even permit them&#44; 
nay&#44; compel them&#44; to neglect the&#8211; holy law for which 
they themselves profess a mock veneration &#59; the sa&#8211; 
cred language&#44; in which God spoke&#44; in which the law 
was given&#44; is not regarded &#59; men speak of abolishing 
it&#44; and why&#61; because they are ignorant&#44; and are too 
indolent to make themselves acquainted with it&#59; 
teachers enough there would be if they were desired 
&#8212; but they are not desire&#39;d&#44; and the knowledge of the 
Hebrew tongue&#44; and the knowledge of the law of God 
are dimiiiishing&#44; waning&#44; but not perishing &#33; For this 
state of things will not last&#59; the age of superstition&#44; 
of a belief in demons&#44; in witchcraft&#44; in phantoms of

dreadful time&#44; when every thing sacred by age&#44; hal&#8211; 
lowed through antiquity&#44; is approached with rude 
and unholy hands&#44; will also take its flight &#58; when the 
lover of his God&#44; the real benefactor of mankind&#44; the 
sincere Israelite&#44; will again raise his head&#44; when his 
words will be listened to with pleasure&#44; and his in&#8211; 
structions received with avidity and satisfaction. K 
we will not by our own reflection&#44; if we will not by 
our own impulse seek the Lord &#58; then will He visit 
us with punishment&#44; the race of the wicked will be 
swept from the face of the earth&#44; and He will probe 
the remainder like the fanning&#8211;mill separates the 
chaff from the wheat &#59; and if the remainder be but 
small&#44; they will still constitute&#44; although diminished&#44; 
the people of God&#44; the light of the nations. Often 
and often has Israel sinned&#44; often and often have the 
wicked been plucked out and removed out of the 
vineyard of the Lord&#44; the house of Israel &#59; still has 
Israel never ceased to be a people&#44; still has religion 
never been wanting of defenders. But why will we 
tempt the anger of God&#61; why will we wait till the 
fire is kindled which will consume us&#61; We have 
every inducement to be a religious&#44; a good&#44; a holy

is prohibited&#61; the excess of every thing&#59; and is it 
too much to ask of man to abstain from inquiring 
after the essence of the Deity&#44; from inveighing against

ful gain&#44; to such limits and checks of honesty and 
neighbourly love as He has prescribed in his book of 
the law &#61; &#8212; And&#44; lastly&#44; has not Heaven a right to tell 
man &#58; Thus far pleasures are lawful&#44; the rest are inju&#8211; 
rious and unholy&#61; Common reason will dictate the 
answers to our questions&#44; and humanity ought to 
bow with profound reverence to the decision thus 
given by the all&#8211;wise One&#44; and to submit to his rule 
with meekness and patience. And let us but pursue 
the lives of the godly and of the sinner&#59; and&#44; if noth&#8211; 
ing else will satisfy us&#44; this inquiry must&#44; and dictate 
to us the lesson which is hourly preached by the whole 
universe &#58; &#34; That in the way of piety alone there is 
life.&#34; The presumptuous sinner says in his heart&#58; 
&#34; There is no Providence.&#34; He pursues the career 
of voluptuousness&#44; of aggrandizement&#44; of ambition&#44; 
and hesitates at nothing &#59; every thing to him is law&#8211; 
ful &#59; he defies the Deity &#59; he throws out taunts against 
the Cause of causes&#59; but suddenly his end comes&#59; 
and scarcely is his blasphemy uttered&#44; when off he is 
hurried&#44; unconscious even of the moment which ter&#8211; 
minates his worthless existence&#44; and he leaves behind 
him a name&#44; loaded with horrible notoriety&#44; and men 
say of him &#58; &#34; So perished one who forgot his God.&#34;

let him be conscious of the approach of death &#58; what 
agony&#44; what horror fill his mind &#33; I speak not of the 
ignorant&#44; the brutelike infidels&#44; for they are never 
cited as examples by their admirers&#44; but of those who 
employed their talents in misleading the world&#44; or 
who concealed a course of infamy under the outward 
cloak of conformity with religion &#59; for no sooner do 
they feel that their end is coming&#44; than they dread its 
approach&#44; they curse themselves&#44; beg of men to grant 
them life &#33; life &#33; they hope when too late to make 
amends for past misconduct&#44; and at length pass away 
with the horror of dissolution before their eyes&#44; and 
filled with dread at meeting their awful Judge&#44; who 
will not&#44; cannot&#44; pass over talents shamefully wasted&#44; 
a life misspent in wickedness&#44; hypocrisy&#44; or unbelief. 
&#8212; Thus perished a Korah&#44; a Dathan&#44; and an Abiram&#59; 
thus perished a Voltaire&#44; and many an infidel of mod&#8211; 
ern and ancient times. But let us look at the reverse 
of the picture. There walks the righteous &#59; his heart 
is true with his Maker &#59; his mind is filled with love 
towards mankind&#59; in short&#44; he is the child of God&#44; 
the brother of his fellow&#8211;man &#59; and when his task is 
ended&#44; he can look with composure upon his reunion 
with God&#44; for he is conscious he has nothing to dread 
in the judgment to come. And thus departed Jacob&#44; 
Moses&#44; Elisha&#44; and many other good men of Israel&#44; 
as well as of other nations&#44; and no doubt thus will 
pass away many now living&#44; and many yet to be born.

&#34;May my soul die the death of the righteous&#44; and may my end 
be like him. &#34; 

Bileam had been sent for by the king of Moab to 
pronounce a malediction upon Israel&#44; as Balak vainly 
imagined that this would enable him to exterminate 
the dreaded and hated race. For reasons known to 
Him&#44; God at first refused to let Bileam depart upon 
this errand&#44; but ultimately told him that if he pleased 
he might go&#44; but should not dare to say any thing 
after his arrival contrary to the word of God which 
might be revealed. The gentile prophet felt himself 
elated with this concession&#44; and at once resolved to 
go&#44; and the very next morning he commenced his 
journey &#59; upon the way a messenger of the Lord op&#8211; 
posed his progress&#44; for the reason given &#58; &#34;Because 
the hated journey had been too suddenly resolved 
upon&#59;&#34; but still he was alloAved after a slight deten&#8211; 
tion to proceed&#59; and when arrived at the court of the 
king of Moab&#44; he accompanied the latter fo the hill 
of the national idol&#44; Baal&#44; whence he could see a part 
of the Israelitish camp. Here he prepared several 
sacrifices and awaited in a lonely spot the revelation 
of God. The revelation came &#59; but in place of a curse&#44; 
he was tilled by inspiration with amazement and re&#8211; 
spect for the glory and great destiny of our people&#44; 
when we had not yet existed quite forty years. And 
thus he spoke &#58; 

&#34;From Aram did Balak lead me&#44; Moab&#39;s king from 
the mountains of the East&#44; Come curse for me Jacob&#44; 
and come denounce Israel. What shall I curse&#44; whom 
God not curseth&#44; and what shall I denounce&#44; whom 
God not denounceth &#61; For from the top of rocks I 
see him&#44; and from hills I behold him&#59; behold the

numbered. Who counteth the dust of Jacob&#44; and 
numbereth the fourth part of Israel &#61; May my soul 
die the death of the righteous&#44; and may my end be 
like him&#33; &#34; 

Filled with the knowledge of the future greatness 
of the then wandering people&#44; a nation then without 
a home&#44; a nation then without a country&#44; save a small 
strip of land along the Jordan&#39;s banks&#44; Bileam assured 
his friend Balak&#44; the king of Moab&#44; that it is useless 
to curse those whom God wishes to bless &#59; and in an&#8211; 
other place he predicted the farther rise and progress 
of the star which shall rise from Jacob&#44; and the rod 
which shall uprise from Israel&#44; and alluded thus to 
the kingdom of the blessed anointed of the Lord&#44; 
whom Jacob foretold when his end was approaching&#44; 
whom Moses saw in his prophecy&#44; and of whom Isaiah 
so beautifully sung&#44; when predicting&#58; &#34; And a rod shall 
come from Jesse&#39;s stem&#44; and a branch shall flourish 
from his roots. &#34; And then placing before his eyes 
the whole glory of the people&#44; as a nation and as in&#8211; 
dividuals&#44; he wished that his death might be the tran&#8211; 
quil&#44; the peaceful death of Jacob&#44; whom God called 
Israel&#44; and that he might partake of the happiness 
which was ajtlength to befal the nation springing from 
him. Let our desire be the same&#44; friends and breth&#8211; 
ren &#33; but whilst desiring&#44; let us also endeavour to de&#8211; 
serve it&#59; let us teach our children the way they 
should go&#44; let us love our fellow&#8211;men truly and sin&#8211; 
cerely&#44; let us dispense good wherever we may be&#44; and 
let us also observe the precepts of the law&#44; and rever&#8211;

in whatsoever place whither thy providence may lead 
us. Amen. 

Brethren&#33; 

In a former address to you I attempted to exhibit 
some few reasons&#44; why we should prefer the light of 
revelation to the best doctrines elicited throuoch re&#8211; 
flection by the most eminent of heathen philosophers&#44; 
even conceding that these doctrines should have orig&#8211; 
inated with the heathens themselves. It was then 
shown how far from truth were the noblest concep&#8211; 
tions of the human mind&#44; and how simple&#44; yet how 
beautiful were the institutions which Moses delivered 
unto Israel&#44; no less in practice than in precept. But 
still some doubter may say &#58; &#39; That it is one thing to 
admit the beauty and usefulness of these institutions &#59; 
yet something very different to believe them as es&#8211; 
sential to salvation&#44; or to concede their unwavering 
truth and permanency.&#34; &#8212; E&#34;ow if it were&#44; that doubts 
occur only to the minds of the vicious or the non&#8211;Is&#8211; 
raelites&#44; it were perhaps useless to trouble you&#44; my 
brethren&#44; with a refutation of such doubts &#59; but un&#8211; 
fortunately&#44; Israelites also do doubt&#44; and even to the 
most pure in n>ind the intercourse with the world 
will occasion perplexing inquiries&#44; which it may not 
be in his power so soon to solve&#44; as may be conducive 
to establish is peace of mind. &#8212; We see around us 
men of various persuasions&#44; and some also of no fixed 
moral principles &#58; still every one claims of being in 
the right way&#44; as though the right way&#44; which from 
its simplicity and truth can be but one&#44; were manifold

and diversified. We may go a step farther and main&#8211; 
tain that&#44; strictly speaking&#44; there are but certain fixed 
actions&#44; to do which is to do right &#59; but where shall 
we find two persons exactly doing the same things&#44; 
even assuming that they should maintain the same 
opinions&#61; But this consideration&#44; of the uncertainty 
whether we act at all times right or not&#44; needs not to 
disturb us too much &#59; since our almighty Father&#44; 
knowing our imperfect organization&#44; expects not per&#8211; 
fection from us&#59; as the Psalmist says&#58; &#34;And their 
heart was not true with Him&#44; and they trusted not 
in his covenant. But He&#44; the merciful One&#44; pardoned 
their sin&#44; and would not destroy&#59; and often kept back 
his anger&#44; and awakened not all his wrath. And He 
remembered that they were flesh.&#34; &#40;Psalm Ixxviii.&#41; 
Still in point of fact&#44; there is but one right way&#44; and 
this way is the one pointed out by the revelation of 
God. For&#44; the man of no principle&#44; except his own 
vague ideas of right and wrong&#44; can have no guide 
save interest and expediency&#59; and as these guides 
are different with diflerent persons&#44; and constantly 
changing their position with the same persons even&#44; 
it follows&#44; that to measure the right by this standard 
would be to admit a constant change in its quality 
and application &#59; and that which is wrong in one 
would be right in another&#59; and what was condemned 
to&#8211;day might meet our approbation to&#8211;morrow. Such 
a rule of life would&#44; in place of tranquillizing the 
mind and establishing peace in society&#39;&#8211;&#44; tend to dis&#8211; 
turb both the mind of the individual&#44; and the welfare 
of the world at large&#44; to such a degree&#44; that the con&#8211; 
templation of it presents nothing but horror to the 
lovers of their species. &#8212; Where next shall we look

for the desired standard&#61; From men in general&#44; let 
us ascend to the favoured few&#44; who are endowed with 
powers of intellect beyond their fellows &#59; but are they 
capable of deciding so unerringly as to become our 
guides&#61; do their bodies not sicken&#61; do their thoughts 
never become clouded&#61; remains their judgment al&#8211; 
ways unimpaired &#61; and has interest nothing to do in 
making their opinions turn to the right and left &#61; and&#44; 
lastly&#44; are they infallible in their decisions &#61; To all 
these questions&#44; we must return an answer unfavour&#8211; 
able to the idea of the expediency of adopting the 
promulgation of any one wise man as the standard 
of right&#59; for even a Solomon may be obnoxious to 
the want of perfection&#44; in goodness&#44; in wisdom&#44; and 
in consistency. &#8212; Let us next go into the assemblies 
of the honoured and great ones of the land &#59; but there 
we shall find confusion even worse confounded. In&#8211; 
terest there rules with a potent hand&#59; popular favour 
is to be courted &#59; popular applause is to be won &#59; the 
million is to be propitiated &#59; and each individual bows 
at the altar of fear and self&#8211;aggrandizement&#44; and sac&#8211; 
rifices to them often the dearest interest of his coun&#8211; 
try&#44; and tramples upon the rights and liberties of his 
fellow&#8211;men&#44; to gratify his own vaunting ambition. 
Even if there arises occasionally a fearless man&#44; who 
dares to hold up the mirror to the corruption which 
overspreads the state&#44; who is bold enough to tell his 
compeers that they are ruining the commonwealth 
by the reckless course they are pursuing&#59; where does 
he find listeners&#61; where are those that follow his 
standard &#61; And even let us suppose the patriot tri&#8211; 
umphant &#8212; does he not become in his turn the tyrant&#61; 
Does he not practise the same revolting acts of op&#8211;

pressioii wliicli caused the downfall of those against 
whom he strove so valiantly&#61; And let us not forget 
the awful lesson which the history of a civilized coun&#8211; 
try taught us not many years back&#44; and whose crimes 
in the way of moral and political reform&#44; or revolu&#8211; 
tion I should have said&#44; were so great as to cause one 
of the greatest defenders and promoters of its ex&#8211; 
cesses to exclaim on the scaffold&#44; as she yielded up her 
head to the axe of her executioner &#58; &#34; liberty&#44; liberty&#44; 
how many crimes are committed in thy name &#33;&#34; As&#8211; 
semblies of the wise therefore cannot teach us what 
is right. &#8212; Let us next go among the religious sects&#44; 
amonofst whom the earth is divided. But there too 
the weakness of human nature will astound and baf&#8211; 
fle us. One will claim its doctrines to be derived 
from a god who walked on earth &#59; and look into its 
rules&#44; and you will see them claiming human sacrifices 
as a pleasant offering to its gods&#44; and its temples you 
will find defiled by the blood of innocents. Another 
sect will teach you that all but its own adherents are 
children of perdition&#44; and that its doctrines must be 
preached unto all men by fire and the sword. An&#8211; 
other&#44; and a numerous people it is&#44; and its power is 
widely extended over the earth&#44; its armies and its 
fleets are the terror of all nations&#44; and its wisdom and 
its learning may well excite our astonishment&#44; teaches 
that for the sake of savin sf mankind from everlasting&#58; 
damnation a portion of the deity became inclosed in 
a body of flesh&#44; dwelt for a space of time among men&#44; 
and then suffered death by the hands of those whom 
to save he was sent. Farther&#44; that salvation is to be 
obtained only through a belief&#44; or faith&#44; as it is termed&#44; 
in these supposed facts&#44; and that he&#44; who was thus

deputed&#44; abrogated the covenant wbicli the Lord of 
bosts bad made witb Israel&#44; and tbat farther by our 
unvvnllingness to accept of the new covenant&#44; as it is 
called&#44; we forfeited our right and former claim as the 
elect people&#44; and more still&#44; that those nations which 
have adopted the new creed have been chosen in our 
stead&#44; and that the new dispensation has been substi&#8211; 
tuted as a better one and to the exclusion of the first 
covenant of God. Here you have briefly laid before 
you a view of the various rules of life which have ob&#8211; 
tained currency among mankind&#44; and&#44; with the excep&#8211; 
tion of the small number of Israelites&#44; all other men&#44; 
under various modifications&#44; are members of these 
several creeds&#44; that is to say&#44; they are either heathens&#44; 
Mahomedans&#44; or Xazarenes. To sift the evidences by 
which each of these various systems is supported&#44; and 
to prove its insufficiency as the universal rule of right 
is easily practicable. For as to heathenism and the 
law of Mahomed&#44; they can scarcely be presumed by 
their very followers to be based upon historical truth&#44; 
even setting out of sight their doctrines of doubtful 
morality&#44; although it may freely be conceded that the 
followers of these systems may nevertheless and in 
spite of the defectiveness of their codes be good and 
moral men. &#8212; An extended examination need not be 
gone into&#44; as we live not among followers of Brahma&#42; 
and Mahomed&#44; and since we are never in this coun&#8211; 
try invited to join those sects. But in reference to 
the third clan&#44; the Nazarenes&#44; we can briefly answer 
them &#58; You say the ancient law was abrogated&#59; admit 
it for argument&#39;s sake &#59; but the question recurs&#44; where 
are the new duties laid down in the new code which 
are to be followed in lieu of the precepts admitted 

VOL. II. 8

86 THE PERMANENCE OF THE LAW. 

by you also as of diviue origin&#61; in what passage of 
your books have you any special legislation&#44; unless it 
be a reference to the law and the prophets &#61; And if 
the law and the prophets are sufficient to refer to&#44; 
without enacting new laws&#44; how can it be possible 
then that the law has been abrogated&#61; &#8212; Farther&#44; to 
establish the truth of any system based upon&#44; as it is 
alleged&#44; and confirmed by&#44; and confirming the books 
of our canon&#44; it must first be established that the new 
does not contradict and overthrow the old&#59; but I 
need not tell you&#44; brethren&#44; that the doctrine of the 
sacrifice of a portion of the deity to satisfy the other 
portion is nowhere&#44; as far as we Jews understand the 
Scriptures&#44; as much as alhided to &#59; for God and man 
to be one is repugnant to our ideas of the purity&#44; in&#8211; 
divisibility&#44; and holiness of God &#59; that the claim for 
a new code being established upon the ruins of the 
old is plainly contradictory of two various prophecies&#44; 
one of which says&#58; &#34;And in thee also &#40;meaning 
Moses&#41; they shall believe forever&#34; &#40;Exodus xix. 9&#41;&#59; 
and the other enjoins&#58; &#34;Remember ye the law of 
Moses my servant&#44; which I have commanded him 
Horeb for all Israel&#44; statutes and judgments&#34; &#40;Mala&#8211; 
chi iii. 22&#41;. So then it will appear that the first 
prophet under the Mosaic dispensation&#44; as well as the 
&#42; last of the series of those illustrious men who taught 
the world wisdom and piety&#44; testified as emphatically 
as words can make it&#44; that the law and statutes pro&#8211; 
claimed at Horeb were to be permanent&#44; fixed&#44; and 
unchangeable. And we come at length to the propo&#8211; 
sition which clearly follows from what has just been 
said&#44; that the books called the Old Testament by the 
Nazarenes are either false or true alone&#44; to the exclu&#8211; 

<pb n="87"/>

THE PERMANENCE OF THE LAW. 87 

sion of any other book or system&#44; and that&#44; admitting 
their truth and the necessity of obeying them to in&#8211; 
sure salvation&#44; they in no way concede the truth of 
any other additional book or code&#44; or the obligation 
of believing a single word or idea in addition to what 
they contain. &#8212; We are fully aware&#44; that each class 
of men and also every individual supporting certain 
ideas concerning the rule of right can&#44; by some show 
of reason&#44; maintain their own side of the question&#44; 
and to the superficial observer they may appear to 
refute triumphantly all objections&#59; but let me assure 
you&#44; that in no one instance yet have our opponents 
been able to gainsay our assertions&#44; and only by im&#8211; 
posing silence on us through the terror of persecution 
have they answered our arguments. Let it not be 
imagined&#44; however&#44; that it is arrogance in us to as&#8211; 
sume that we alone are &#39;right &#59; for even repudiating 
all belief in revelation&#44; it must still be confessed&#44; that 
at a very early period we alone rejected the follies of 
superstition&#44; and adopted a system of moral philoso&#8211; 
phy in the highest degree sublime and beautiful&#44; as 
has been shown on a former occasion&#44; so that in place 
of a disbelief in a direct revelation removino&#58; our as&#8211; 
tonishment&#44; it increases it the more. We have now 
arrived at the following conclusions&#44; that a belief in 
a revelation is the only consistent belief&#44; since&#44; be&#8211; 
sides its reasonableness&#44; all the world&#44; with but few 
exceptions at most&#44; acquiesce in it under some shape 
or other &#59; and that it is equally reasonable to look for 
the rule of right in the Mosaic revelation alone&#44; 
though we do maintain&#44; that it is futile to look for it 
elsewhere. Understand the question well &#58; it is not 
said that no person other than a Jew can be good&#44; but 

<pb n="88"/>

88 THE PERMANENCE OF THE LAW. 

merely that no one can be upon the right way&#44; unle 6 
he obeys the statutes of the Mosaic code&#44; and that 
moreover it is not being a believer merely of the doc&#8211; 
trines of this law which constitutes the Israelites&#44; but 
the obeying them. Having premised thus much&#44; and 
shown where we can find an unvarying guide to 
righteousness and justice&#44; we will dispense for the 
present with all arguments to prove the tenets of our 
religion to be good and beneficial&#44; and merely confine 
ourselves to the subject we proposed for our considera&#8211; 
tion&#44; to exhibit the necessity of believing in the truth 
of the law&#44; its permanency&#44; and its necessity to insure 
our salvation. It needs not much penetration to dis&#8211; 
cover&#44; that the God who created all&#44; and who governs 
all&#44; is able to punish and rcAvard every man accord&#8211; 
ing to his merits. Farther&#44; that if we see certain acts 
of God upon earth coming in consequence of certain 
acts of men&#44; we must say&#44; that because of these acts 
of men God acted so on his part. And lastly&#44; if cer&#8211; 
tain events have been foretold as sure to happen in 
consequence of certain deeds&#44; we must acknowledge&#44; 
if the prediction is verified&#44; that because of the con&#8211; 
ditions accomplished&#44; the predicted events came to 
pass&#44; and consequently that the person who made the 
prediction was accurately informed of the future&#44; that 
is to say&#44; he spoke the truth &#59; and as no man can of 
his own accord know what the fatare will bring forth&#44; 
he must have been informed by the omniscient One&#44; 
or in other words&#44; that the person thus speaking was 
a prophet of God&#44; and by Ilim inspired to speak a 
message to mankind for their guidance and to warn 
them of the consequences of their doings. If now we 
apply these conditions to our law&#44; we shall find that 

<pb n="89"/>

it can stand the test of these principles of sound rea&#8211; 
son. For as to its doctrines in the first place&#44; we are 
taught to believe that only from the Creator alone 
proceed all events&#44; that through his blessing countries 
are at peace and happy &#59; the fields are clad with ver&#8211; 
dure&#59; the trees loaded with fruit&#44; and beasts and men 
sated with bounty. In the next place we must dis&#8211; 
cover that in consequence of our people disobeying 
the will of God&#44; as laid down in the Bible&#44; they were 
visited with signal punishment&#44; and as reasoning be&#8211; 
ings we must conclude that the punishment was sent 
by the all&#8211;wise Judge to avenge the infraction of the 
law. Lastly&#44; upon inspecting the Bible&#44; we shall find 
a number of predictions made at various times from 
Noah&#44; the second father of mankind&#44; to the termina&#8211; 
tion of the prophecies&#44; some of which have been ful&#8211; 
filled&#44; others which are now in process of being ful&#8211; 
filled&#44; and others&#44; to judge from analogy&#44; which will 
eventually be accomplished. All this proves&#44; that 
those persons who pronounced these predictions were 
inspired by the Disposer of events&#44; and consequently&#44; 
that as children of this Disposer of all we are bound 
to believe and confide in his annunciations&#59; for to 
disbelieve would be in effect to deny the truth&#44; which&#44; 
even if there were no punishment consequent upon 
disbelief&#44; would be to confide in our own fallible rea&#8211; 
son&#44; or what we might be pleased to call reason&#44; in 
preference to yielding our judgment to Him who is 
infinitely wise and infallible. To demand therefore 
to rest our hopes of salvation on a belief in the holy 
law and obeying its precepts&#44; is only to ask of us mor&#8211; 
tals to confide and acquiesce in the judgment of the 
Source of all wisdom&#44; and to follow such rules &#40;which&#44;

coming from One who never changes&#44; must naturally 
be unchangeable&#44;&#41; as have been laid before us as the 
everlasting rule of life. It will therefore strike you&#44; 
brethren&#44; that the denunciation of punishment was 
not a mere idle threat&#44; and that the punishment itself 
was not sent merely to gratify a feeling of revenge&#44; 
for revenge is a passion&#44; and passions are incompatible 
with the nature of the Deity&#59; but the punishment 
was announced as impending to warn mankind of the 
dangers they were incurring for disobedience &#58; and 
when they turned a deaf ear to the admonitions so 
kindly vouchsafed&#44; punishment&#44; the natural conse&#8211; 
quence of sin&#44; soon followed to prove the truth and 
justice of God. It is thus&#44; therefore&#44; that the accom&#8211; 
plishment of the words of the law proves its truth&#44; 
and its truth being proved&#44; it remains for us to adopt 
its precepts and to follow the path pointed out by it 
as the road to everlasting life&#44; as a measure of pru&#8211; 
dence and safety. 

Permit me now to draw your attention to the ter&#8211; 
rible admonition which Moses pronounced a few 
days before his removal to the land of everlasting 
life&#44; when he was about to resign the shepherd&#39;s 
staff&#44; he had wielded so long and so faithfully over 
the flock of the Lord&#44; into the trusty hands of his 
servant and follower&#44; Joshua&#44; the son of ISTun. Many 
miracles had been wrought by his means &#59; many a 
time had doctrines of peace&#44; laws of life&#44; and statutes 
of salvation been promulgated through him &#59; many 
battles had been fought under his guidance&#59; often 
also had sinners been rebuked through the spirit 
that spoke within him&#59; and just before his depar&#8211; 
ture he only needed yet to leave behind him a meas&#8211;

ure&#44; by comparing which with future events all suc&#8211; 
ceeding ages might have an unerring means to verity 
the revelation given to the Israelites at the time they 
went out of Egypt. Blessings were promised for obe&#8211; 
dience&#44; &#8212; temporal prosperity on the one hand&#44; and a 
spiritual holiness on the other&#59; a peaceful people and 
a holy nation should Israel become&#44; if they would con&#8211; 
sent to be in truth the adorers of the God of their 
fathers. But the wrath of Heaven was to be kindled 
against them&#44; if they transgressed the covenant which 
had been made with them&#44; to prove to them in their 
latest generation&#44; that only through obedience to the 
divine will could Israel be happy. O dreadful in&#8211; 
deed were the words which fell upon the ears of our 
ancestors&#44; when they were told that&#44; &#34; They should 
grope about at midday like the blind gropeth about 
in the dark&#44;&#34; ay&#44; that their afflictions should be so 
great&#44; that they should be so tar removed from 
friendly assistance&#44; as the blind who gropes his way in 
darkness with no kind hand to save him from stum&#8211; 
bling &#59; and how truly has this been fulfilled &#33; Ages of 
suffering have passed over us&#44; and even now our afflic&#8211; 
tions are not ended &#33; How many thousands were 
slaughtered&#44; how many innocents were plundered for 
no evil theyhad done&#44; but solely because they bore 
the hated name of Jew. And who heeded their suf&#8211; 
ferings &#61; Who cared for the blood that flowed &#61; Who 
minded how many stakes were kindled&#61; It was but 
the Hebrew that lay in the dungeon &#59; it was but the 
Israelite that groaned under the blow &#59; it was but the 
Jew that shrieked as the flames slowly devoured him&#33; 
And were it not that we had been dispersed&#44; were it 
not that persecution could not overtake us simultane&#8211;

ously in all countries&#44; the name of the seed of Jacob 
had long since perished. But thanks he to Him who 
woundeth and also healeth&#44; and who prepareth the bal&#8211; 
sam&#44; even before the blow is struck &#33; He caused us&#44; 
when wanderino&#58; from our land&#44; to be scattered wher&#8211; 
ever mankind dwelt&#44; and always moved some to com&#8211; 
passionate us&#44; when others laid snares for our feet. So 
that we were preserved&#44; in diminished numbers in&#8211; 
deed&#44; but still preserved&#44; a nation one and undivided&#44; 
to glorify the E&#34;ame&#44; the honoured and fearful&#44; the 
everlasting Lord our God. In this also we discover 
the quality of goodness of the most extended kind 
and of that mysterious nature to which the prophet 
alluded when saying &#58; &#34; In anger thou rememberest 
to be mercifid.&#39;&#39; &#40;Habakkuk iii. 2.&#41; It were easy and 
at the same time highly instructive to compare every 
one of the curses with its accomplishment&#59; but this 
would lead us farther than necessary&#44; and I believe 
that every one of you no doubt can iind a multitude 
of illustrations from his own reading and observa&#8211; 
tion. But one of the most striking I will merely re&#8211; 
fer to before closing the subject for the present&#44; and 
elucidate a little more largely its literal accomplish&#8211; 
ment. 


&#34; And thou shalt become an astonibhment&#44; a proverb and a by&#8211; 
word among all the nations whither the Lord will lead thee.&#34; 
Deut. xxviii. 37. 

If ever any prophecy was triumphantly vindicated 
by its accomplishment&#44; it is surely this dreadful one

spoken by the father of the prophets. Understand 
its full import&#44; and yon will need no farther illustra&#8211; 
tion of the truth of Moses. The Israelites were at 
that time a wandering people&#44; scarcely known to 
those nations even that were leading their usual pred&#8211; 
atory and erratic life in the great deserts of Arabia&#44; 
where the Israelites had been tarrying for forty years. 
It was but a few months previous to this time&#44; that 
the first dawning of the accomplishment of the pre&#8211; 
diction relative to the inheritance of the land of Ca&#8211; 
naan had taken place&#44; and Moses himself announced 
that he would have to leave the actual fulfilment of 
the promises made through him to be brought 
about by another. Yet it was under such circum&#8211; 
stances&#44; where no human wisdom could foresee 
what actually has occurred&#44; that the gifted above all 
men laid open the coming&#44; dark&#44; frowning&#44; future&#44; 
before the people whom he had guided&#44; and .warned 
them of the dismemberment of that splendid&#44; happy 
government which had been just established&#44; and 
told them that the national name should become a 
proverb and a byword among all the nations of the 
earth. And&#44; alas &#33; how has our people been Imrled 
about &#33; How has our mighty state fallen &#33; And how 
has the enemy&#44; that ne&#39;er before durst even to ap&#8211; 
proach the walls of Jerusalem&#44; the chosen city of the 
Lord&#44; and where He had promised to let his glory 
dwell&#44; broken down its walls&#44; battered its gates&#44; de&#8211; 
vastated its houses&#44; profaned the temple&#44; and burnt 
down the sanctuary with the fire of desolation &#33; And 
the remnants of Israel &#8212; how have they&#39; been scorned&#44; 
derided&#44; hated&#44; and spurned&#33; How insultingly have 
our foes borne their triumph &#59; and although the age

of active persecution may be said to have passed 
away from many countries&#44; still how little fellow&#8211; 
feeling is manifested for the Jew &#33; Ay&#44; we are said 
to dwell in darkness&#44; when the law of God is our 
light. The Almighty is invoked to change our 
heart&#59; yet it is not to bring us back to his service&#44; 
but to cause us to adopt systems which we loathe&#44; 
against which our spirit revolts&#44; and which we h&#39;ave 
rejected amidst persecutions innumerable&#44; which we 
scorned&#44; though contumely and death were our only 
other alternative &#33; Besides&#44; how many means are 
tried to wipe away the hated name of the Hebrew 
from amongst men &#33; How many bribes are offered 
for apostacy &#8212; how many snares laid to lead us astray&#59; 
&#8212; to the Jew as such the gates of preferment are 
closed&#59; but let him only pretend to change&#44; and 
riches&#44; honours&#44; pleasures&#44; and offices are offered to 
him as the reward meet for his baseness&#33; And if 
we come to claim equal rights from the land where 
we are born&#44; whose burdens we bear equally with 
the other inhabitants&#44; whose homes and whose liber&#8211; 
ties we are willing to defend with our treasures&#44; with 
our blood&#44; and with our lives &#58; we are told&#44; that it is 
impossible to put us on a level with other men&#44;&#42; that 
it would be blasphemy to think of emancipating the 
Jew&#44; as they call it &#33; But have we no claims upon 
our fellow&#8211;men of all creeds &#61; Is not civilization in&#8211;

been so well secured were it not for our law&#44; the 
promulgation of which broke the bonds of slavery&#44; 
and rent asunder the chains of superstition under 
which all Europe groaned during the middle ages &#61; 
But what avails it to hold up our claims to the 
equality of rights&#44; which&#44; if even conceded in words&#44; 
would in all likelihood be denied to us in effect&#44; as 
long as the prejudice against our name does last&#44; and 
whilst other sects look upon us as their inferiors&#44; or 
as heretics to be pitied for their blindness even if 
tolerated from mere compassion. Virtue&#44; wisdom&#44; 
and learning&#44; nay the comeliness of the outward per&#8211; 
son are considered as qualities of rare occurrence 
amongst Jews&#59; and low cunning&#44; grovelling mean&#8211; 
ness&#44; a desire for overreaching the unwary&#44; and base 
ingratitude&#44; are looked upon as the proper character&#8211; 
istics of the Hebrews. And when our excellences 
are too marked&#44; when our virtue is too self&#8211;evident&#44; 
when our disinterestedness challenges the judgment 
of doubt even&#44; it is then said &#58; &#34; It is a pity they are 
Jews &#33;&#34; Let no one say&#44; that this is a picture of vul&#8211; 
gar prejudice merely&#59; would that it were so &#33; It is 
our portion from the world&#44; whether learned or un&#8211; 
learned&#59; it is the contumely attached to us for our 
manifold transgressions &#59; it is the indelible stain which 
God has fixed upon our race for their stiffnecked 
disobedience. 

&#34; Thou shalt be an astonishment&#44; a proverb&#44; and a 
byword. &#34; If a man reverts to our history and fol&#8211; 
lows our onward course from a nomadic tribe to a 
powerful kingdom under the wise Solomon&#44; with so 
many bounties scattered over a fertile soil&#44; with in&#8211; 
stitutions so greatly tending to spread peace and con&#8211;

tentment&#44; with a Providence watching as it were pe&#8211; 
culiarly over our welfare &#58; astonishment will be excited 
at our blindness in throwing away such blessings by 
the sheer folly of obeying our own impulses in pref&#8211; 
erence to the dictates of Heaven &#33; &#8212; If admonitions are 
addressed to a people and they are warned by their 
preachers&#44; they will be told&#44; that their punishment 
will be equal to that of Israel unless they repent &#33; &#8212; If 
an outcast from divine favour is to be painted&#44; the 
picture of the dispersed Jewish nation recurs to the 
mind of the thinking&#59; and be the sect heathen&#44; Ma&#8211; 
homedan&#44; or Nazarene&#44; nay&#44; even the blind infidels&#44; 
they value themselves especially that they are exempt 
from the curse of being numbered amongst us &#33; &#8212; Thus&#44; 
O great God &#33; has thy anger reached us &#59; thus&#44; mer&#8211; 
ciful One&#33; have thy arrows pierced our hearts&#33; But 
just are thy ways &#33; We were tired of serving Thee&#44; 
we loathed thy covenant&#44; we sought to imitate the 
ways of those who knew not thy service&#59; and we now 
must serve those whose friendship we courted&#44; and 
bear the shame of our iniquities &#33; 

Yes&#44; brethren&#44; we were warned that the outraged 
covenant cried aloud for vengeance&#59; but what did 
we care &#61; we vainly thought the evil would not come&#44; 
perhaps we fancied the Almighty unconscious and 
heedless of our course&#59; but the evil at length did come&#44; 
and we were thus taught that the law given through 
Moses was true&#44; unchangeable and necessary to our 
welfare. Even the persecutions we have had to en&#8211; 
dure since our dispersion have tended to confirm the 
truth of prophecy&#44; and to keep us unmingled and un&#8211; 
polluted by an intercourse which the hollow friend&#8211; 
ship of the gentiles would perhaps have produced.

Israel has been shaken by the storms of adversity&#44; 
but not overwhelmed&#44; as the&#42; prophet of Shiloh&#44; the 
aged and blind Achijah&#44; spoke to the wife of Jero&#8211; 
boam &#58; &#34;And the Lord will smite Israel&#44; as the reed 
is shaken in the water&#44; and drive Israel from off this 
good land&#44; which He hath given to their fathers&#34; 
&#40;1 Kings&#44; xiv. 15&#41;&#44; because they had incensed the 
Lord. The punishment&#44; as we have seen&#44; has not 
been withheld&#44; but neither has the blessing been de&#8211; 
nied&#59; for as the reed can be shaken by the flood and 
wind&#44; but through its natural elasticity it resists them 
both&#44; so that it is not broken by what would have 
felled the mighty oak or rooted up the cedars on 
Lebanon &#58; so have we also constantly risen after every 
persecution&#44; and have remained unbroken despite of 
the thousands of ills which have assailed us &#59; and re&#8211; 
gardless of the contempt of the world&#44; and heedless 
of the calumnies of the gentiles&#44; we are still the most 
beloved&#44; the protected people of the Lord. Can there 
be a stronger argument of the truth of the law&#44; which 
has preserved a handful of people entire&#44; when the 
mightiest empires have been swept away and have 
left not a wreck even behind &#61; Let this therefore be 
our consolation&#44; that we are in possession of the rule 
of right &#59; a Yule handed down to us from heaven &#59; a 
rule under which in God&#39;s own good time all nations 
will be made happy&#44; when it will be fulfilled what 
Isaiah foretold&#58; &#34;Rise and shine&#44; for thy light hath 
come&#44; and the glory of the Lord hath shone out upon

Again sustained by thy grace&#44; O our Father &#33; we 
have been permitted to begin another year &#59; again we 
have been suffered to commence a new period&#44; in 
which we may gain thy favour by an obedience to 
thy law&#44; or seek thy forgiveness by repentance and a 
return to the ways of piety. Behold us now&#44; O our 
God&#44; and God of our fathers &#33; assembled in thy house&#44; 
asking thy indulgence to our sinful acts&#44; and to for&#8211; 
give us according to thy unending mercies. Not 
through our own merits pardon us&#44; but because Thou 
art kind and gracious&#59; and if our sins are manifold&#44; 
if our deviations have been too numerous&#44; then let 
thy chastening hand fall lightly on us&#44; so that&#44; shown 
the right path by thy all&#8211;wise instruction&#44; we may be 
revived and live before Thee&#44; to serve Thee&#44; to adore 
Thee&#44; to fear Thee&#44; and to acknowledge Thee alone 
our God&#44; our Father&#44; and our Protector. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

Human Hfe has been aptly compared to a journey&#44; 

<pb n="99"/>

PRAYER&#44; FASTING&#44; AND CHARITY. 99 

which every one has to travel to its close. On this 
journey all are met by clangers which they must over&#8211; 
come&#44; and by adventures which they must encounter&#44; 
and no rest can be expected till the journey is finished&#44; 
as the dangers thereof are constantly renewed&#44; and 
continually varying their position&#44; so that the utmost 
vigilance is requisite to remain unharmed amidst the 
difficulties&#44; and to avoid getting into devious by&#8211;ways&#44; 
which encircle the road of life on all sides. But sup&#8211; 
pose a traveller should lose his way&#44; and find himself 
at a distance from the path he is to travel&#44; would it 
not become necessary for him to endeavour to regain 
the highway&#44; if he is at all desirous of reaching his 
original destination&#61; and if he is unable to correct 
himself&#44; would it not be well to ask of those whom 
he meets for directions how to proceed &#61; And if he 
is unmindful of his progress&#44; if heedlessly he takes 
no care whether he be right or wrong&#44; whom but 
himself can he blame&#44; if at last he finds his onward 
progress debarred by insurmountable obstacles &#61; Just 
so is it with those who travel the path of life&#59; for 
whether we are willing or unwilling to make any ex&#8211; 
ertions&#44; we are once here&#44; and even must exist our 
allotted space below&#44; till our Father calls us back to 
Him. And &#8211;whilst here&#44; we must be agents&#44; must be 
active accoi&#39;ding to the capacities with which we have 
been endowed&#44; and just in proportion as we endeavour 
to fulfil the will of our Maker&#44; we are either good or 
bad. During our entire course&#44; however&#44; we are con&#8211; 
stantly allured by the world without us&#44; either to 
good or to evil&#59; some circumstances&#44; some persons&#44; 
call us to the house of God to worship and to adore&#59; 
but there are .not wananc&#58; &#8211;opportunities n.oi&#39; men that

call US away unto vice and sin. The dangers which 
thus threaten us&#44; and which&#44; let me add&#44; threaten us 
from the moment we begin to think&#44; are twofold&#58; 
first&#44; those produced by circumstances which&#44; as it 
were&#44; address our senses silently&#44; yet with a language 
not to be misunderstood &#59; the others may be termed 
the results of evil communication&#44; which allure the 
unwary by false pretences&#44; and by colouring the 
wrong with all the appearances of right. The means 
of ascertaining what is right are given by the pre&#8211; 
cepts laid down for us in the law&#44; and if ever an op&#8211; 
portunity presents itself for disobeying them&#44; if this 
opportunity be ever so tempting&#44; we must remain 
firm&#44; because we are certified&#44; that to disobey would 
be to sin against the declared will of Heaven. So 
the antidote to sin&#44; in the first instance&#44; is the knowl&#8211; 
edge of the law&#44; for without this knowledge our very 
ignorance must misguide us. When evil associates as&#8211; 
sail us to go along with them on the road to destruc&#8211; 
tion&#44; if they endeavour to counteract the knowledge 
of the right which we possess by trying to impress 
upon us its futility&#44; and that there is no necessity 
to abide by precepts which are confessedly a restraint 
upon our natural inclinations&#58; we should tell our&#8211; 
selves that the law is not futile&#44; when we discover at 
every step that obedience to it brings comfort to the 
doer thereof&#44; and promotes peace and good&#8211; will among 
mankind&#59; and that&#44; if there were no other punish&#8211; 
ment even save the diseases of the body and the in&#8211; 
firmities of the mind&#44; consequent upon the indulgence 
of the carnal desires&#44; this alone would already be 
enough to account for the restraints laid upon us by 
the dictates of the divine law. But&#44; alas &#33; how great 

<pb n="101"/>

PRAYER&#44; FASTING&#44; AND CHARITY. 101 

is the number of those who become sinnei&#39;s by oppor&#8211; 
tunity &#33; how great the number of those who listen to 
evil advice&#44; and who leave the right &#8212; pursue the evil 
&#8212; and die before the knowledge of their own wrong 
has impressed itself upon their minds &#33; It is strange 
indeed that&#44; seeing so many evils consequent on sin&#44; 
man could yet be seduced to prefer it to piety &#59; but 
still the fact is&#44; that sinning is the lot of mankind&#44; 
and punishment their consequent doom. And be&#8211; 
cause our Father in heaven knows our natures&#44; He 
does not inflict punishment immediately after the sin 
has been committed&#44; but withholds&#44; to use the Bible 
language&#44; &#34;his anger&#44;&#34; and waits to see whether the 
sinner will not repent and return to the practice of 
the right. E&#39;ow the question is&#58; &#34;How is a man to 
do&#44; when he finds that he has been sinning&#61; what 
should his conduct be to regain the favour of God&#44; 
which he has lost&#61; how shall he ward off the punish&#8211; 
ment which so justly threatens him&#61;&#34; A man con&#8211; 
scious of having been guilty of pursuing the wrong 
should&#44; in the first place&#44; cease at once and altogether 
sinning in the manner he has been accustomed to do. 
He is not doing what is demanded of him as the first 
step to repentance&#44; by deferring his reformation from 
day to day&#44; dr by breaking oiF by degrees. For in&#8211; 
stance&#44; if he has been in the habit of eating forbidden 
food three times a day &#59; of violating the Sabbath four 
times a month&#59; of wronging his fellow&#8211;men once a 
week&#44; it will not be enough for him to begin with 
reducing the amount of his sinning to once a day&#44; 
twice a month&#44; or once in two months&#59; no&#44; this is not 
repenting&#44; this is only to trifle with the Deity&#44; as 
though we were telling Him&#44; in effect &#58; &#34; Wait&#44; my

Lord God&#44; I cannot now reform all at once&#44; my habits 
are too much confirmed&#44; I will mend by degrees &#59; I 
shall indeed be good as soon as my convenience will 
let me.&#34; Indeed&#61; is this repentance&#61; can we thns 
hope to blind the all&#8211;knowing One &#61; Will He believe 
that our heart actually regrets our conduct&#44; when we 
still cling to it with an affection which betokens not 
a sorrow for past conduct &#61; And yet we hear per&#8211; 
sons speaking&#44; that they now do wrong&#44; because they 
cannot help themselves&#44; that is to say&#44; their conveni&#8211; 
ence or their worldly interest is served by their mis&#8211; 
conduct &#59; but at some future time&#44; in a year or two&#44; 
when they are rich enough&#44; when their health has 
been too much injured to permit them to participate 
in farther excesses&#44; O&#44; then they will repent entirely&#44; 
but in the meantime some slight reformation must 
suffice. But no&#44; brethren&#44; slight reformation is not 
the way of repentance&#59; a ruined house may be sus&#8211; 
tained by a large number of props strongly wedged 
against the firm ground&#59; but still the ruin is not there&#8211; 
by repaired&#59; just so is it with the sinner&#59; if he does 
not build up for himself a new building of righteous&#8211; 
ness in place of the defective one he has been inhabit&#8211; 
ing in his folly&#44; it is but a ruin he inhabits&#44; and sooner 
or later&#44; the feeble supporters of the tottering fabric 
give way&#44; and he&#44; the deluded inhabitant&#44; is crushed 
by the falling mass when he vainly dreamt himself 
secure. If therefore a man wishes to repent&#44; he must 
cease his unrighteousness at the very instant&#59; delays 
are dangerous&#59; who knows&#44; but before another day is 
elapsed&#44; his life on earth may be suddenly cut short&#44; 
and he be thus called hence with all his un forgiven 
sins on his head &#33; A man may have been deluded&#44;

he may have framed excuses for his wrongs&#44; whilst 
he committed them &#59; but this should not be any rea&#8211; 
son for his continuing to act contrary to law&#44; when 
he discovers the error of his ways. If now he has 
ceased to do wrong&#44; he should carefully endeavour to 
repair in some measure&#44; and to the extent of his 
ability&#44; the wrong he has been doing&#59; he must be par&#8211; 
ticular in his religious conduct&#44; and leave no oppor&#8211; 
tunity unimproved to do just the opposite of his 
former sinful conduct. And in this active reforma&#8211; 
tion he must disregard any personal inconvenience 
he may have to encounter&#59; no pecuniary loss must 
deter him &#59; no fear of ridicule of his former associates 
must influence him&#59; for if he does not yield his heart 
entirely to his God&#44; if he esteems the fleeting benefits 
of riches and of pleasure more than he loves the 
favour of his Maker&#59; if he fears more the sneers of 
the ungodly than the frowns of his omnipotent Judge &#58; 
no reformation has taken place&#44; and his sin is not re&#8211; 
moved&#44; his recovery has at least not been complete. 
But after a man has even actually left ofl&#39;the evil of 
his ways and returned to the practice of the precepts 
of the law&#44; he should still endeavour to satisfy his 
conscience by acts of penance. Our wise men have 
recommend&#39;ed&#44; in consonance with the annunciations 
of the prophets&#44; the exercise of the following virtues &#58; 
prayer&#44; fasting&#44; and charity. Prayer we all know to 
mean an outpouring of the heart to our Maker. But 
this prayer should be sincere&#44; the outpouring should 
go the whole length of the sin&#44; and the returning 
sinner should&#44; in offering up his heart&#44; go over the 
whole course of his misconduct&#44; paint to himself his 
wickedness in its proper deformity&#44; and not endeavour 

<pb n="104"/>

104 PRAYER&#44; FASTING&#44; AND CHARITY. 

to frame excuses to himself to ease his troubled con&#8211; 
science&#59; but he should state explicitly&#44; without ex&#8211; 
tenuation&#44; the whole of his deeds&#44; and if his mind is 
troubled&#44; if his feelings are pained by the humiliation 
he submits to&#44; he may rest assured that he will ulti&#8211; 
mately be benefitted by the sincerity of his devotion &#59; 
his feelings will become purified&#44; his mind will be&#8211; 
come elevated&#44; his beating heart will become calmed&#44; 
and ever after he will bless the hour in which he re&#8211; 
vealed himself to himself&#44; and look upon his con&#8211; 
fessed sins as warnings which will for ever deter him 
from recurring to his course of vice. 

In the same manner as prayer is the expression of 
feeling in words&#44; so is fasting the expression of con&#8211; 
trition in acts. Bv fastins&#58; the sinner reminds him&#8211; 
self&#44; and makes an impression on his mind&#44; of the 
wrongs he has been doing &#59; and if the fasting follows 
upon a sincere change of heart&#44; the having once done 
actual penance will always prevent him from falling 
into the same error&#44; should it ever present itself again 
to him. It is not that God Welshes us to punish our&#8211; 
selves&#44; that our deprivation may be a pleasure to 
Him &#59; only that our repentance may be done in such 
a manner as to remain unforgotten by us. Mere 
sorrow&#44; even anguished feelings may&#44; after a while&#44; 
fade from the memory &#59; but active repentance&#44; bodily 
afiiiction&#44; fasting with a knowledge of our sins&#44; can 
hardly ever be obliterated from the mind&#59; and be&#8211; 
sides&#44; while fasting the sinner will revert constantly 
to the reason of the penance&#44; and in this manner 
perfect the change of heart&#44; which thought and 
prayer have begun. 

As a third means of propitiating the favour of

Heaven&#44; we are taught to do charity&#44; not merely to 
dole out alms to beggars&#44; but to bestow our aid on 
the afflicted&#44; to right the oppressed&#44; succour the poor&#44; 
and save the tottering brother from falling. If a per&#8211; 
son having sinned&#44; especially against his fellpw&#8211;mau&#44; 
and being conscious of his transgression&#44; wishes to 
show his love of God&#44; revived now in him through 
repentance &#58; he should prove that he is now wilUng 
and anxious to follow his Maker in deeds of benevo&#8211; 
lence and charity&#59; and in place of his having been 
hard of heart and unmerciful&#44; he should&#44; being re&#8211; 
generated&#44; be the friend of the poor&#44; the father of 
the orphan&#44; the protector of the widow&#44; and merciful 
to those whom the world uses despitefully. &#8212; Even if 
a man should not be blessed with riches&#44; and be thus 
unable to give away much in charity&#44; then let him 
give according to his means &#59; and if it be altogether 
out of his power to give&#44; then let him do personal 
acts of kindness to all who may stand in need of 
them &#59; and there are surely always enough that 
mourn&#44; and over the face of sinful earth sorrow is 
at all times widely spread. Ay&#44; let him who repents 
enter the abode of sorrow&#44; let him speak comfort to 
the prisoner&#44; let him dry the tear of the weeping or&#8211; 
phan&#44; let him endeavour to calm the tumultuous 
heaving of the widow&#39;s grief&#44; let him stand by the 
couch of sickness and wipe away the damps of death 
from the brow of the departing&#59; let him proclaim 
the gopdness of God to him who is despairing &#58; and 
he may rest assured that his return to good will be 
the most acceptable offering&#44; which the sinner can 
bring to his offended Judge. &#8212; As a farther step in a 
permanent repentance it were well&#44; that a man should 

<pb n="106"/>

106 PRAYER&#44; FASTING&#44; AND CHARITY. 

associate with those who fear the Lord&#44; eschew the 
society of the evil&#8211;disposed&#44; avoid temptation &#59; and if 
his fall is at all owing to ignorance&#44; let him go to the 
houses where the law of God is taught&#44; even let him&#44; 
confessing his ignorance&#44; ask advice of those who are 
better informed than himself&#44; just as a traveller&#44; who 
has gone astray&#44; asks of those whom he meets&#44; which 
is the road he ought to go.&#39; And even one&#44; to whom 
the statutes of the Lord are familiar&#44; should again 
and again revert to them&#44; frequently read and study 
the life&#8211;dispensing word&#44; and upon every act consult 
what God wills he should do&#44; as a wayfarer looks up 
to the post which at the crossings cTf the road marks 
out the path which leads him to the haven of his des&#8211; 
tination. &#8212; Thus fortified by prayer&#44; by penance&#44; by 
charity&#44; and by a study of the holy Word&#44; may the 
repentant sinner freely look upon himself as having 
regained the way of righteousness&#44; and as being again 
likely to become deserving of the divine mercy. &#8212; 
And although our transgressions may be manifold&#44; 
the mercy of God is still greater&#59; if even our sins 
are countless&#44; the kindness of God is still more be&#8211; 
yond measure. So&#44; let no one who has sinned de&#8211; 
spair of mercy&#59; let him not look upon himself as an 
outcast from divine favour &#59; but no matter how heavi&#8211; 
ly thy conscience be laden&#44; erring brother &#33; come and 
call upon thy Father and Creator&#44; and throw thyself 
for protection and forgiveness before &#8211;his footstool. 
Lay open before Him thy heart&#44; and receive the re&#8211; 
ward meet for thy confidence &#59; for know that we are 
promised&#44; that even if our sins be as red as scarlet&#44; 
they shall be made as white as snow through repent&#8211; 
ance. &#8212; God has promised us forgiveness if we seek

it &#59; and it is therefore adding unbelief to our other 
sins&#44; if we despair of the fulfilment of the promises 
of mercy. And thus speaks the prophet Hosea in 
his address to Israel&#58; 

&#34;Keturn&#44; O Israel&#44; unto the Lord thy God&#44; although degraded 
through thy iniquity. Take but prayers with you&#44; and return to 
the Lord I Speak to Him&#44; O Thou&#44; who forgivest all iniquities&#44; 
receive graciously our doing good&#44; and with our lips we will repay 
the steers of sacrifice.&#34; xiv. 2&#8211;3. 

Here we are told the consoling truths&#44; that repent&#8211; 
ance will be availing though the iniquities he has 
been committing have brought man to stumbling&#59; 
and that no sacrifices are absolutely necessary but an 
amendment of the heart&#44; a return to good&#44; and an 
outpouring of a contrite spirit. If sacrifices were 
alone capable of afiTording atonement&#44; there could at 
this moment no atonement be made for captive Is&#8211; 
rael &#59; for we have no temple&#44; no priest&#44; no sacrifices. 
But our Father&#44; when He cast us out from our land&#44; 
did not by punishing us cast us off from his grace &#59; 
and He is yet our God&#44; although we no longer can 
lead the steer of sacrifice to his holy courts to atone 
for the transgressions of our people on the Day of 
Atonement. But when we assemble in the minor 
temples in all places of our habitation&#44; and institute 
there a rigid inquiry into our conduct&#44; condemn sin&#8211; 
cerely whatever wrong we find&#44; lay our case before 
God&#44; and come away amended in deeds&#44; and resolved

in mind to be obedient henceforward &#58; we are prom&#8211; 
ised&#44; that God will heal the wounds of our apostacy&#44; 
love us again in his favour&#44; and take away his anger 
from us. Like the blessed dew He will be to us&#44; we 
shall bloom like the rose&#44; and take root like the for&#8211; 
ests on Lebanon. These are the promises of the Lord&#44; 
and we may&#44; therefore&#44; freely give up ourselves to 
the guidance of our better feelings&#44; which constantly 
draw us to the righteous way. And what hinders 
us &#61; Literest&#44; in the first place &#59; because we might 
lose worldly gain&#44; if we are religious. Next&#44; pride &#59; 
we cannot confess to the world that we have been in 
the wrong in our former doings. Lastly&#44; false shame&#59; 
we cannot bear to lose the name of an independent 
spirit&#44; of a deep philosophical thinker&#44; which had 
been given to us for our former contempt of all re&#8211; 
ligious duties. Superadd to these chief causes in 
some the ruling moral supineness in others&#44; that in&#8211; 
activity which rather yields to the evil passions than 
grapples with them&#44; and you have the whole amount 
of obstacles to a thorough reformation. And are 
these so very formidable &#61; Let us view worldly in&#8211; 
terest in its strongest points&#44; admit that a violation 
of the law can produce a rich harvest of wealth and 
renown &#58; and still a man must be very shortsighted if 
he cannot see that these ends never can satisfy all the 
cravings of the mind. And let a person&#39;s riches be 
ever so great&#44; either he is compelled to leave them&#44; 
or he is not permitted to enjoy them even during his 
whole life &#59; and the man of power does not repose on 
a bed of roses &#59; envy assails him &#59; hatred pursues all 
his steps&#44; and deadly revenge lays schemes against 
his life. Add to which&#44; that no man dies with half 

<pb n="109"/>

PRAYER&#44; FASTING&#44; AND CHARITY. 109 

of his desires gratified&#44; and tlien answer for your&#8211; 
selves&#44; whether there is aught in riches or in power 
so very tempting&#44; as to sacrifice the everlasting inter&#8211; 
est of the immortal soul to their acquisition or reten&#8211; 
tion. 

Pride&#44; I said&#44; will not suffer us to confess ourselves 
to have been in the wrong &#59; but though we can carry 
a bold fronc before the world all the days of our life&#44; 
it is impossible to escape the notice of God&#59; and con&#8211; 
sequently it were better at once to mortify our pride 
by an acknowledgment of our error&#44; than to incur 
the inevitable tendency of an unreformed life of sin. 
Farther&#44; we should reflect&#44; that but the first beginning 
will be painful &#59; and if we have once conquered our 
pride&#44; have once acknowledged our wrong&#44; the sub&#8211; 
sequent religious conduct of our reformed life will 
never pain our self&#8211;love anymore&#59; on the contrary 
we will look back with satisfaction upon the hour 
when we humbled our pride&#44; when we yielded our 
spirit to the divine inspiration of repentance. 

False shame also is an obstacle&#44; as has been said &#59; 
a man has had a name of an independent philosopher&#44; 
and if he should yield submission to religion&#44; he of 
course loses this envied distinction. But wdiat does 
he lose thereby &#61; he is praised for the possession of a 
positively injurious quality&#44; a blind overweening con&#8211; 
fidence in his own wisdom&#44; and by repentance he 
yields his judgment to God&#39;s guidance&#59; and thus 
though he humbles himself&#44; and confesses that his 
own knowledge has not been a just guide&#44; he thereby 
acquires a safer conductor&#44; for the profession of the 
holy law will enable him the better to lead a life of 
piety&#44; humility&#44; and benevolence&#59; and he will earn in

place of the admiration of the idle&#44; the worthless and 
the ignorant&#44; the satisfaction of the Searcher of hearts&#44; 
the Knower of all secrets&#44; the Judge of all flesh&#44; of 
Him who punisheth iniquities and rewardeth obedi&#8211; 
ence &#33; 

And as to moral supineness preventing reformation&#44; 
the sinner should be reminded that&#44; as with pride&#44; 
the first effort alone is really painful&#44; and by degrees&#44; 
even the most cherished debaucheries and extrava&#8211; 
gancies will become absolutely nauseous &#59; and when 
once a person has confirmed himself in the practice 
of morality&#44; moderation&#44; and religious observances&#44; 
no one more than himself will be surprised at his 
blindness and folly in having been so long the slave 
of vice and infidelity. Let us&#44; therefore&#44; join heart 
and hand&#44; and resolve firmly to return to the Lord&#44; 
and let each leave off the wrong that is in his hand&#44; 
and endeavour to repair&#44; as much as possible&#44; the evil 
he has committed. &#34; Let&#44;&#34; as Isaiah says&#44; &#34; the sinner 
leave his way&#44; and the man of wrong his thoughts&#44; 
and let him return unto the Lord&#44; and He will have 
mercy on him&#44; and to our God&#44; for He is great in 
pardoning. &#34; Thus has the Lord promised &#59; and we 
the children of the first believers&#59; we the descendants 
of Abraham&#44; who left his father&#39;s house by command 
of God &#8212; of Isaac&#44; who was willing to die a sacrifice 
on the altar of the Lord &#8212; of Jacob&#44; who even among 
idolaters and in servitude never gave up his inno&#8211; 
cence &#59; we the inheritors of the everlasting covenant&#44; 
&#8212; surely we ought not to disbelieve&#44; to hesitate&#44; to 
despair of mercy &#59; and although stumbling through 
our sins&#44; let each recurrence of the season of repent&#8211; 
ance impress us with the necessity of repenting and

returning to the way of righteousness. And &#33; may 
our eyes live to see the day&#44; when all Israel&#44; returning 
to the God of their fathers in truth and righteousness&#44; 
will exclaim again as in days of old&#58; &#42;&#39;The Lord is 
the God&#33; the Lord is the God&#33;&#34; Such a Day of 
Atonement will indeed be an acceptable day to our 
almighty Father&#44; and a day of glory and happiness to 
Israel&#59; and well may he who confides in the Lord say 
at its close &#58; &#34; I am now willing to die&#44; since over the 
regenerated earth again walks peace&#44; and in the hab&#8211; 
itations of men again dwell piety and the grace of the 
Lord.&#34; 

Father of mercy&#33; grant our portion in life and 
happiness&#44; and shield us from famine&#44; from war&#44; and 
from pestilence&#59; and let the year which has just begun 
be to us and all Israel a year of joy&#44; of peace&#44; of light 
iu the law&#44; of health&#44; of contentment&#59; a year in which 
thy people may not need the assistance of each other 
or of a foreign people&#59; a year in which Thou mayest 
restrain mortality&#44; pestilence&#44; and destruction from 
us&#59; and upon the people&#44; amongst whom we live&#44; 
bestow peace&#44; and plenty&#44; and let their hearts be in&#8211; 
clined to mercy towards us and all Israel our brethren. 
And O&#44; Protector of Jacob &#33; arrest the arm of perse&#8211; 
cution&#44; stay the evil advice which our enemies give&#44; 
baffle their&#42; thoughts&#44; and render as naught their in&#8211; 
tentions&#44; and show to all nations of the earth&#44; that 
Thou art our Father and Redeemer&#59; and let it be thy 
will&#44; God of our fathers &#33; to let thy glory again dwell 
among us&#44; and send thy anointed to gather us from 
all portions of the earth. Amen.

DISCOUESE XXXVI. 

THE JEWISH FAITH. 

To the God&#44; who is alone everlasting and unchang&#8211; 
ing&#44; and who keeps his promises unto the latest gen&#8211; 
erations&#44; he praise&#44; and glory&#44; and adoration from all 
the creatures that He has created in his mercy and 
kindness. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

The religion&#44; hy the bestowal of which&#44; God has 
favoured us&#44; demands of us two things &#58; namely&#44; be&#8211; 
lieving or taith&#44; and deeds&#44; or in other words active 
religion. Without a motive for action we do not act&#44; 
and consequently without a motive for religious con&#8211; 
duct we would certainly not be religious&#59; and there&#8211; 
fore if we wish to be religious&#44; or to speak more prop&#8211; 
erly&#44; if we are really anxious to secure that great share 
of happiness which flows from an obedience to the 
divine law&#44; we must fortify ourselves previously by 
an acquisition of such feelings as best conduce to such 
a desirable consummation &#59; or what is the same&#44; we 
must endeavour to grow in faith&#44; and strengthen 
thereby the growth of good deeds&#59; for faith alone can 
be the producer of outward actions&#44; if these actions 
are to have the least claim to sincerity. It is true&#44; any 
one can practise the same line of conduct pursued by 
another&#44; without being in the least imbued with the 
feelings of the latter&#59; he may accommodate himself 

<pb n="113"/>

THE JEWISH FAITH. 113 

to an outward conformity from interest&#44; from fear&#44; or 
even because he would as leave do one thing as the 
other. But it must be evident to even the most char&#8211; 
itable judge of human infirmities&#44; or the most indul&#8211; 
gent palliator of human faults&#44; that the conduct of 
such a hypocrite&#44; coward&#44; or indiflerent one&#44; cannot in 
any degree be considered as deserving of the small&#8211; 
est degree of approbation &#59; because there is wanting 
that inward impress of hallowed thought which can 
evidently alone stamp it as possessing value and real 
usefulness. For&#44; let the hypocrite be removed from 
observation&#44; will his conduct not change&#61; Let the 
fearful coward be beyond the fear which spellbound 
him&#44; where will his conformity. have flown to&#61; Let 
him&#44; who amongst faithful Israelites is an Israelite in 
his outward practice&#44; be placed among those acting 
otherwise&#44; will his indifierence not induce him to agree 
wdth his present associates &#61; These questions answer 
themselves&#44; and unfortunately examples are not want&#8211; 
ing to prove that they are not based upon mere sup&#8211; 
position. It remains therefore for us to find out pre&#8211; 
cisely those principles which&#44; when cherished&#44; will pro&#8211; 
duce amongst all men a uniform course of action&#44; as 
far as uniformity can be reached by so many thinking 
beings&#44; who are all placed in difierent circumstances&#44; 
and all labouring under the disadvantage of a want of 
uniformity of instruction and intellectual endowments. 
&#8212; To premise &#58; we all&#44; every human being&#44; even the 
suicide&#44; constantly strive by every act&#44; unless we are 
at the moment under absolute constraint&#44; to improve 
our happiness&#44; or to avoid an intolerable evil&#44; which 
two motives&#44; if properly considered&#44; will be found to 
be identically the same&#59; for a removal of any evil&#44; let

it be ever so small&#44; is an absolute increase of happiness 
to an equal amount. Since now the pursuit of hap&#8211; 
piness is our ruling motive&#44; and since every one thinks 
himself properly in pursuit thereof&#58; it is evident&#44; since 
we see men differing so widely in their conduct&#44; and 
since the two extremes of a thing cannot be the same&#44; 
that it is owing to the want of proper information or 
correct training&#44; which training is in most instances&#44; 
if not in all&#44; the parent of information. And although 
each one thinks himself acting correctly and in a 
manner which will best secure happiness to himself 
and those dependent upon him &#58; still it is evident that 
misery is the result of many a one&#39;s conduct&#44; misery 
to himself and misery to others. Now it is not to be 
denied&#44; that there is hardly any line of conduct&#44; or 
we may at once admit for argument&#39;s sake&#44; that there 
is none&#44; which will exempt us from evil&#59; but it is 
equally true&#44; that many ways there are which will be 
more useful than others&#59; and as believers in an over&#8211; 
ruling Providence we must say&#44; that upon the way of 
righteousness there is&#44; when properly viewed&#44; no evil 
whatever&#59; as even the apparent ills are always leading 
to some beneficial ending. It is therefore at once in&#8211; 
cumbent on us to seek this way which will lead to so 
glorious a result&#44; and not alone this&#44; but to acquire 
such feelings&#44; to the exclusion of all others&#44; as will 
prevent us from ever leaving this good way&#44; when 
once we have entered upon it. And let it be observed&#44; 
that it is mainly for our own sakes that we should do 
so&#59; for by the accruing happiness no one will be more 
benefitted than ourselves. 

As following from what has been said we will now 
maintain&#44; that a belief and an acquiescence in re&#8211; 

<pb n="115"/>

THE JEWISH FAITH. 115 

ligious doctrines&#44; clearly defined and well understood&#44; 
will hold the mind devoted to religious conduct&#44; and&#44; 
what is the same&#44; will insure happiness. &#8212; Some per&#8211; 
sons may object to creeds&#44; as demanding an acquies&#8211; 
cence in things not understood&#44; in doctrines not con&#8211; 
sonant with reason &#59; but such an opinion is entirely 
erroneous&#44; and shows an ignorance of those doc&#8211; 
trines which are attempted to be undervalued. &#8212; We 
will proceed now to the consideration of the doctrines 
of faith&#44; which are the foundation of the religion 
which we profess. In the first place we have&#44; as the 
foundation of all religion&#44; the belief in the existence 
of a God &#59; secondly we are to acknowledge that 
this God made known to mankind his will for their 
guidance &#59; and thirdly&#44; that we are accountable to 
this God for a dereliction from&#44; or to be rewarded 
by Him for an obedience to&#44; his will as declared 
to us. I have said that the foundation of our re&#8211; 
ligion is entirely consonant with reason&#44; and that be&#8211; 
sides its doctrines can be clearly defined and readily 
understood&#59; it will therefore be now necessary to 
elucidate this assertion entirely to your satisfaction&#44; 
although this may by some be considered as hardly 
necessary&#44; where the proof is so obvious. &#8212; The first 
fundamental&#39;principle says &#58; &#39; There is a God.&#34; Yes&#44; 
there is a God &#33; all nature cries &#59; there is a God &#33; who 
made all that our eyes behold and that our thoughts 
can conceive &#59; there is a God &#33; the angels exclaim&#44; 
who is far removed beyond the ken of the purest&#44; 
and greatest&#44; and wisest of all existing beings &#59; there 
is a God &#33; the saints respond&#44; who is blessed beyond 
all conception&#44; who is good beyond the reach of the 
imagination. If we but cast our eye upward to the

starry firmament&#44; and behold the myriads of suns 
sending down their beaming light upon us&#59; when 
we see the quiet moon winging its circuit round our 
planet&#44; when we regard the bright light of the glori&#8211; 
ous sun&#44; which refreshes and quickens all here be&#8211; 
low &#58; we must acknowledge that one&#44; great&#44; and 
mighty Architect made them all&#44; and appointed to 
each and all the courses they are to pursue&#44; till their 
task is finished&#44; till their end has come &#59; when they&#44; 
the great monuments of God&#39;s wisdom&#44; too&#44; may 
pass away&#44; and thus show&#44; that He alone endures for 
ever. &#8212; Go abroad from your dwellings&#44; and gaze on 
the fields clad in the spring&#8211;time with the mantle of 
green&#59; see the trees putting on their leafy garment&#59; 
and see in summer the golden fruit ripen in the wide&#8211; 
spread plain &#59; and in autumn the clustering grapes 
suspended from the vine &#59; and in winter the dazzling 
snow shrouding the face of the land to render again 
fruitful the exhausted soil &#58; and then say&#44; whether 
or not there is one wise Creator that organized all 
so beautifully and for so benign a purpose. And 
look upon the streamlets&#44; how they bubble forth 
from the flinty rock or the marshy fen&#44; how they 
swell and unite into a mighty stream&#44; till the heav&#8211; 
ing ocean receives the lengthened and majestic river&#59; 
and that highway of nations itself&#44; the salty and un&#8211; 
fathomable deep which surrounds the earth &#8212; and 
gainsay&#44; if you can&#44; that our Father above breaks 
the rock with his potent might and bids the waters 
flow&#44; and gathers the streams&#44; bears onward the 
waves&#44; and piles as it were in the hollow of his hand 
the restless&#44; swelling ocean&#39;s flood&#44; and sets to it a 
limit&#44; saying&#58; &#34;Thus far only shalt thou come&#33;&#34; &#8212;

And who is it&#44; O proud mortal &#33; who causes the in&#8211; 
visible wind to blow&#59; who is it that does bring up 
clouds from the ends of the earth &#59; at whose bidding 
does the thunder roll&#44; and at whose command does 
the lightning flash &#59; at whose nod does the earth&#8211; 
globe tremble&#61; unless it be our almighty God&#61; &#8212; 
And say&#44; who provides food for thee &#59; who is so boun&#8211;

sea &#59; or if we&#44; leaving all outward nature&#44; revert to

of a Creator&#44; the Cause of causes&#44; the Power of

considers the origin of things to be &#58; and he must 
say&#44; to solve the mystery of existence&#44; that there ex&#8211; 
isted matter&#44; and that through an arrangement which 
he cannot explain &#40;mind brethren&#44; the atheist is not 
in the least nearer to knowledge because of his reck&#8211; 
less denial&#41; things were so ordered&#44; fortuitously of 
course&#44; as we find them. Still is it not evident to 
every one&#44; except to the wilfully blind&#44; that this for&#8211; 
tuitous Arranger&#44; but which in effect must be an in&#8211; 
telligent mind&#44; is actually a God&#44; a Creator&#44; and&#44; 
what follows of itself&#44; a Preserver&#61; The truth is&#44; 
there is nothing more absurd than the denial of a 
Creator &#59; for there is no conceivable theory of ex&#8211; 
plaining the existence of any organization without 
Him. And as said&#44; though we confess&#44; that we 
know not what God is&#44; how He exists&#44; when his ex&#8211; 
istence began &#58; still we have a starting&#8211;point upon 
which to rest our system&#59; we adore Him&#44; who is 
inconceivable&#44; we submit to Him&#44; who is removed 
from our research&#44; and in our affliction we call upon 
Him&#44; who&#44; having made all according to his will&#44; 
can order things&#44; can arrange his creation as may be 
pleasing to Him&#44; at all times&#44; at all seasons&#44; and un&#8211; 
der all circumstances. And he who denies this&#44; is 
he any wiser than we &#61; Are his ideas of his own 
origin any more satisfactory&#61; Is his system&#44; to 
use the cant phrase&#44; a phrase much abused by the 
ignorant or would&#8211;be&#8211;wise&#44; is his system&#44; I meant to 
say&#44; more philosophical&#44; or does it not lead&#44; as briefly 
exhibited already&#44; to the most monstrous absurdities 
and contradictions&#61; &#8212; &#39;No brethren&#44; atheism is un&#8211; 
reasonable&#59; and there is no reason whatever for a

ities which it must produce. I will not now enter 
upon the practical evils of social disorganization 
which must follow in its train &#59; since my present ob&#8211; 
ject is merely to show its folly and unsoundness&#44; and 
to exhibit briefly the beauty and consistency of the 
first tenet of our holy law&#44; which demands &#58; &#34; There 
is a God.&#34; 

This God&#44; who is so infinite&#44; so immeasurably great&#44; 
has thought fit at different times to reveal himself to 
certain persons of both sexes&#44; and of various nations&#44; 
to make known through them the doctrines and laws&#44; 
by which He wished mankind should be governed&#44; 
without however depriving any one of the free will 
to adopt or reject these precepts&#59; or&#44; to express my&#8211; 
self more distinctly&#44; laws were given&#44; by obeying 
which we should be acting according to the will of 
our Maker&#44; and by doing so deserve his favour&#44; but 
while the way was pointed out to us&#44; no actual com&#8211; 
pulsion was laid upon our inclinations&#59; for though 
instructed&#44; we can&#44; if our wayward fancy should in&#8211; 
cline us&#44; act in such a manner as though no law had 
been given&#44; and conduct ourselves contrary to&#44; and 
in defiance of&#44; the will of God. &#8212; It is not necessary 
at this moment to prove the reasonableness of this 
principle&#44; since I have so often before to&#8211;day called 
your attention to the subject&#44; and I trust the little 
I have advanced has been more than enough to re&#8211; 
move doubts&#44; at least so far as to answer objections. 
To me indeed it appears superfluous to argue the 
subject &#59; for X3rod&#39;s ability to communicate his will&#44; 
if He is so disposed&#44; cannot be doubted&#59; and He who 
provides for the wants of the animalcules&#44; a million 
of which wdll barely cover the end of this finger&#44;

could&#44; and must have given to man&#44; the crown of his 
creation&#44; a guide to his mind&#44; a prop to his soul which 
should be a shield against evil&#44; and a guardian that 
should point out and lead on to everlasting happi&#8211; 
ness. &#8212; A few words at this time only will I add with 
reference to the record of the divine revelation which 
we now possess&#44; and which&#44; as you well know&#44; it is 
our duty to obey. In the first place a great injury 
is done to religion by the ignorant looking upon it 
as the work of Moses. But how often must it be re&#8211; 
peated&#44; that Moses was not the author of a single 
precept&#44; but that he acted merely as the messenger 
whom the Israelites themselves had selected to com&#8211; 
municate to them whatever God might reveal to him 
for their guidance&#61; If it were indeed that the Mo&#8211; 
saic law had no better foundation than human inge&#8211; 
nuity&#44; then for a certainty would it be unreasonable 
to demand implicit obedience to its tenets&#44; any more 
than to the works of Solon&#44; of Confucius&#44; of Mat&#8211; 
thew&#44; or of Paul. But if we look upon it according 
to its real merits&#44; if we behold in it the workings and 
the immediate inspiration of the Deity &#58; then indeed 
the case is entirely altered&#44; and the enactments it 
contains in this case demand&#44; not alone our attention&#44; 
but an entire and confiding obedience. And do not 
the various statutes&#44; independently of every other 
consideration&#44; deserve&#44; from their extreme utility&#44; all 
that the advocates of their sanctity ask for them&#61; 
What law does so well secure the liberty of the citi&#8211; 
zen&#44; the administration of justice&#44; the righting of the 
oppressed&#44; or watches with so much solicitude over 
the security of the helpless female&#44; the bereaved or&#8211; 
phan&#44; the unprotected stranger &#8212; even the slave who&#44;

to escape from his tyrant&#39;s oppression&#44; comes to seek 
the protection and security of the divine code &#61; Come&#44; 
and let us take a few of the laws &#59; for instance &#58; &#34; Re&#8211; 
member the Sabbath to keep it holy&#59;&#34; doubtless&#44; he 
who luxuriously&#44; in the arms of riches&#44; in the posses&#8211; 
sion of plenty&#44; idles away his whole life&#44; may not feÂ§l 
the force&#44; the benignity&#44; the extreme wisdom&#44; let me 
add&#44; of the commandment &#59; but go amongst the mul&#8211; 
titude&#44; who&#44; true to the curse pronounced against the 
sinning progenitor of our race&#44; &#34; earn their bread by 
the sweat of their face&#44;&#34; go and see how gladly they 
celebrate the weekly Sabbath&#59; how joyfully they wel&#8211; 
come the heavenly bride&#59; go and see them at their 
holy day repast&#44; with how much religious zest the 
viands of the body even are enjoyed&#44; because it is 
the Lord&#39;s holy and blessed day &#58; and then say&#44; if you 
can&#44; whether such a spread of hilarity among so many 
intelligent creatures&#44; who&#44; though poor&#44; are as much 
entitled to repose and enjoyment as the irresponsible 
autocrat of a mighty kingdom&#44; is not a work for the 
ordination of which the loving Father of his creatures 
might not employ himself&#44; consonantly with his dig&#8211; 
nity and wisdom &#61; In short&#44; all who labour&#44; be they 
farmers&#44; mechanics&#44; teachers&#44; servants&#44; judges&#44; or 
scholars&#44; all must equally be rejoiced when weekly 
their toils ar6 suspended&#44; when they are left to acquire 
new strength for renewed exertion. &#8212; &#34; Honour thy 
father and mother&#34; is another precept&#59; this too may 
not be palatable to the idle and vicious offspring who&#44; 
when their father grows old&#44; when their mother be&#8211; 
comes helpless&#44; may think that the aged ones have 
lived long enough&#44; and may even deem it a mercy to 
terminate by one blow the sufferings of decrepit old

age. But were the parents to think so&#44; and cast off 
the puling&#44; helpless&#44; almost unconscious&#44; tender nurs&#8211; 
ling&#44; where would these same vain&#44; arrogant ones 
be &#61; what but a mother&#39;s care watched over the infant&#44; 
called forth its nascent intelligence by maternal en&#8211; 
dearment&#44; hung with hope and fear over the couch 
of early suffering &#61; who but a father Avould toil from 
early dawn till the hour of eve&#44; under the rays of the 
scorching sun&#44; amidst the war of elements&#44; in the 
piercing blast of a winter&#39;s storm&#44; to provide bread 
for the infants whom it is his joy to call his own off 
spring&#44; the children of his beloved wife &#61; And these 
are the beings whom unbelief would forsake&#44; when 
they in turn become helpless&#44; when they are helpless 
perhaps through fatigue endured&#44; through expenses 
incurred for those ingrates who now anxiously hope 
for their dissolution &#61; &#8212; Again says the law &#58; &#34; Thou 
shalt not commit adultery&#59;&#34; &#34;there shall be no incest 
among you.&#34; And how eloquently do these precepts 
appeal to our feelings. Among heathen nations&#44; and 
even among the enlightened people of the present 
day&#44; the female was or is yet looked upon as an in&#8211; 
strument of pleasure &#59; and when once contaminated 
by the touch of vice&#44; she is cast abroad as something 
too unclean to come near us&#44; as one abandoned to mer&#8211; 
ited opprobrium&#44; nay&#44; as one placed beyond the pale 
of compassion. And it is to protect the thoughtless 
and perhaps too confiding woman that these statutes 
were enacted&#59; to banish from the heart of society 
that portion which&#44; as an eloquent female writer ob&#8211; 
serves&#44; is at once the victim and parent of vice &#59; and 
therefore we have so many details in the Pentateuch 
which are to regulate the judges of Israel in their

decision in all cases of incest and immorality. This 
is the law in which we are to have faith&#44; and against 
which the voice of unbelief ought not to be raised &#59; 
and it is especially horrible to hear females uttering 
aught of disrespect against the holy tenets &#59; and to 
me it seems&#44; that although in man infidelity is un&#8211; 
pardonable&#44; it appears doubly offensive and unnatural 
in woman&#44; whose very estimation&#44; and rank&#44; and wel&#8211; 
fare in society are chiefly based upon the benign code 
which we profess. Were I to follow my own inclina&#8211; 
tion&#44; were I as eloquent as the subject deserves&#44; I 
would for hours descant upon the theme&#44; and not 
leave it till all had acknowledged themselves con&#8211; 
vinced &#59; but my tongue is feeble&#44; my mind insuflUcient 
to reach the end &#59; and you&#44; sons and daughters of Is&#8211; 
rael who hear me&#44; surely need not for my admonition 
to exhort you to uphold that which your own hearts&#44; 
your own convictions&#44; must tell you&#44; is beyond price 
invaluable. 

&#34;We now come at length to the last fundamental 
principle of our religion&#44; which teaches &#58; &#34; God wdll 
reward the righteous according to his righteousness&#44; 
and give to the wicked according to his wickedness.&#34; 
A very few words will suffice in explanation. God&#44; 
the Creator of all&#44; has made his will known to man&#8211; 
kind for their government &#59; but&#44; as said already. He 
gave them a free will to obey or not to obey. At the 
same time He declared&#44; that by obedience life would 
be obtained&#44; but the consequence of disobedience 
should be death. Now&#44; as the conditions are known&#44; 
and as God is all&#8211;powerful&#44; it follows that obedience 
or righteousness will meet with reward or life &#59; dis&#8211; 
obedience or wickedness with punishment or death. 

<pb n="124"/>

124 THE JEWISH FAITH. 

And as the Creator&#39;s power is not limited by time or 
space&#44; reward or punishment will be the certain con&#8211; 
sequence of our conduct&#44; either in this life&#44; or after 
death when we shall have entered a new state of ex&#8211; 
istence. And thus says David &#58; &#39; Whither shall I go 
from thy spirit&#44; and whither from thy face shall I fly &#61; 
If I ascend to heaven. Thou art there&#44; and if I should 
lie down in the abyss&#44; I should find Thee.&#34; &#8212; These 
now are the feelings which we should cultivate to be 
sincerely religious &#59; we must believe in the existence 
of God&#44; in the promulgation of his law&#44; and in the 
certainty of reward and punishment. A faith like 
this&#44; in principles perfectly reasonable and clearly 
understood&#44; must step by step promote a holiness of 
heart&#44; a readiness to acquiesce in&#44; and to exercise the 
duties of religion. A faith like this may be properly 
termed a justifying faith&#44; because it preserves the 
mind pure and undefiled from the access of sin and 
corruption &#59; and if even sin should have already been 
committed&#44; it will tend to clear away the impurities&#44; 
the dross of wickedness&#44; and produce a cleansing of 
the spirit and a regeneration of the inward man&#44; and 
render him a just and worthy servant of the Lord. &#8212; 
As a consequence of being in possession of faith&#44; a 
man will be imbued with resignation to God&#39;s de&#8211; 
crees and a sincere belief&#44; that all that happens is 
from a good and wise purpose&#59; farther&#44; it will cause 
a filial reliance upon God&#39;s promises&#44; and prevent 
the righteous from ever despairing&#44; although he see 
not the fruits he might hope for from his well&#8211;directed 
conscientious exertions. &#8212; Such a faith it was which 
animated our glorious ancestor Abraham. He stood 
forth amidst the heathens&#44; a shining light amidst the 

<pb n="125"/>

THE JEWISH FAITH. 125 

darkness&#44; and proclaimed the unity and eternity of 
the Creator of all. Abraham had been promised 
that in him all families of the earth should be bless&#8211; 
ed&#44; and that he should be the progenitor of a numer&#8211; 
ous nation. Time had passed on&#44; and the Patriarch 
had reached perhaps his eighty&#8211;fifth year&#44; and still 
he was childless. But now he was assured&#44; that 
despite of unfavourable appearances the promise of 
a numerous progeny should eventually be fulfilled. 
And says the text &#58; &#34; And He led him out abroad&#44; 
and said. Look up&#44;&#39; I pray thee&#44; heavenward&#44; and 
count the stars&#44; if thou canst count them&#59; and He 
said to him. Thus shall be thy descendants.&#39; And 
continues the sacred writer&#58; 

&#34; And he believed in the Lord&#44; and He reckoned it to him as 
righteousness.&#34; Gen. xv. 6. 

Abraham thus&#44; as we see&#44; believed firmly&#44; confid&#8211; 
ingly in God and his promises&#44; undismayed by the 
improbability of the fulfilment&#44; and we have it here 
recorded that this faith was reckoned as an exertion 
of ri2&#58;hteousness &#59; and this shows us that tliouo&#58;hts 
as well as actions are meritorious in the sight of the 
Searcher of &#34;hearts. &#8212; And the promise so solemnly 
given and so truly believed has been fulfilled&#44; and we 
are here this day the witnesses of the truth of proph&#8211; 
ecy and of the unwavering righteousness of God&#59; for 
we are the children of Abraham&#44; the fulfilment of 
a long&#8211;cherished promise. And should we waver&#61; 
should we hesitate&#61; should we doubt&#61; &#39;No&#44; let it be 
our constant endeavour to fortify ourselves in faith&#44;

O MYSTERIOUS and omnipotent Being &#33; who art so 
far exalted and removed beyond our mortal research&#44; 
fill our hearts with meekness and devotion&#44; that we 
may implicitly resign ourselves to thy guidance&#44; and 
submit with patience to thy all&#8211;wise dispensations. 
And O our Father&#33; if Thou sendest sufferings to our 
hearts&#44; if Thou leadest us through the valley of the 
shadow of death&#44; because of our transgressions&#58; O 
do Thou lead us&#44; do Thou support us with the right 
hand of thy salvation&#44; and guide us safe and un&#8211; 
scathed&#44; and cause our faith in thy goodness to re&#8211;

Brethren &#33; 

Often indeed it happens that we humble&#44; unin&#8211; 
structed&#44; and shortsighted mortals presume to call in 
question the decrees of the Deity&#44; and as it were the 
creature arraigns&#44; and sits in judgment over&#44; the all&#8211; 
wise and blessed Creator. Vain presumption &#33; sinful 
audacity &#33; how can we&#44; the worms of the earth&#44; whose 
being is limited to the shortest span&#44; whose mind is 
incarcerated within a mortal habiliment&#44; whose ideas 
are weakened&#44; whose perception is blunted by sor&#8211; 
row&#44; by sickness&#44; by pains&#44; by passions &#8212; how can we 
&#8212; how dare we &#8212; mistrust the wisdom&#44; the goodness&#44; 
the infallibility of Him&#44; who is &#34;old of days&#44;&#34; whose 
mind is unsearchable&#44; to whom every thing is known&#44; 
to whom all existing things are as naught&#44; who is 
never disturbed&#44; never influenced by sorrow or suf&#8211; 
fering&#44; by passion&#44; or by ignorance &#61; who&#44; when He 
judges&#44; judges with mercy&#61; who&#44; when He punishes&#44; 
sendeth the balm before the wound is struck&#61; &#8212; And 
what are to Him the earth and all that fills it&#44; the sea 
and the mighty monsters of the deep&#44; the birds that 
seek the expanse of firmament&#44; &#8212; when all that is in 
being is derived from Him alone&#44; &#8212; when all that 
breatheth is to Him accountable&#61; &#8212; And still&#44; despite 
of the immeasurable difference which divides us from 
Him&#44; our God&#44; we are yet weak enough&#44; vain enough&#44; 
presumptuous enough to judge Him by the weak&#44; im&#8211; 
perfect standard of our intellect And in reading the 

<pb n="128"/>

records of revelation we are very often led away by 
our ignorance to impugn the justice of God in his 
actions towards men&#44; as though He could view things 
with human feeUngs &#33; It must strike you as self&#8211;evi&#8211; 
dent from the very nature of things&#44; that such a mode 
of reasoning&#44; which would apply to God&#39;s actions the 
standard of humanity&#44; must he erroneous&#44; and lead 
to pernicious conclusions&#44; in as far as it would weaken 
our attachment to the doctrines of the Bible&#44; and 
render us lukewarm in the execution of its precepts. 
It is&#44; therefore&#44; necessary&#44; that our studies and our 
researches&#44; as well as our conduct&#44; should be charac&#8211; 
terized by a deep humility and by a sincere single&#8211; 
heartedness&#44; which should induce us to approach the 
word of God with fearfulness and with a weak reli&#8211; 
ance upon our own wisdom&#44; and with a perfect con&#8211; 
sciousness&#44; that the divine Author of our legislation 
could not err in his decrees any more&#44; than in the 
line of conduct He chose to pursue to our ancestors 
and to the nations whose history is interwoven with 
our own. If we approach the investigation of the 
Scriptures in this spirit&#44; we shall hesitate in our 
judgment upon points which at first sight may ap&#8211; 
pear unreasonable&#59; and we will&#44; as a necessary con&#8211; 
sequence of our perfect reliance upon the truth of 
what is written down in the holy Text&#44; shape our 
conduct in strict conformity to its behests&#44; as by so 
doing we follow the persuasions of unwavering&#44; un&#8211; 
corrupted&#44; and unchanging truth. But should we 
on the other hand approach the investigation of the 
Bible&#8211;text with a determination to use our own wis&#8211; 
dom as a sure and safe guide&#44; and set to work to ac&#8211; 
commodate the events of history to our views of right

and wrong&#44; add to which&#44; that our understanding of 
the Text may at the same time be in some degree de&#8211; 
fective and our acquaintance with history and the 
operations of the human heart deficient&#58; it is abso&#8211; 
lutely necessary&#44; that we will end by cavilling at the 
justice of God&#44; and as a natural consequence&#44; our 
veneration for the words and precepts of Scripture 
will become weakened&#59; and this again will lead to 
unbelief&#44; and unbelief to irreligion and immorality&#44; 
and these again to loss of happiness which is so 
abundantly to be found in the practice of the com&#8211; 
mands of the holy law. &#8212; Humility&#44; however&#44; in an 
investigation so important&#44; not alone to ourselves&#44; as 
individuals&#44; but to all in any degree connected with 
us&#44; will teach us&#44; even if the subject&#8211;matter is capable 
of no explanation whatever&#44; that we must submit&#44; 
where there is no means of arriving at knowledge&#44; 
and that the Almighty is as incapable of injustice&#44; as 
his wisdom is incapable of error. Besides&#44; it must 
be considered that if to&#8211;day&#44; with the information in 
our power&#44; any thing or event is inexplicable to us&#44; 
the case may be altogether dififerent to&#8211;morrow&#44; if 
our sphere of knowledge be then more extended. So 
far&#44; therefore&#44; is an acquiescence in religious truths 
no evidencevof credulity and ignorance&#44; that it may 
be viewed is proof of a purer than worldly wisdom&#59; 
since it may be based upon a knowledge of our capac&#8211; 
ity of arriving daily and hourly at more information&#44; 
and the assurance that after a long life spent in the 
pursuit of knowledge&#44; there is an immense field yet 
unexplored. And thus it happened with one of the 
most remarkable men in a preceding age&#44; whose dis&#8211; 
coveries in philosophy have opened a new career to

subsequent discoverers&#44; and whose virtue was equal 
to his learning. At the close of a long life&#44; when he 
might be supposed to have done as much as lay in 
human power&#44; he is said to have spoken of his own 
attainments &#58; &#39;&#39; I am but like one who has been picking 
up shells on the borders of the great ocean of truth.&#34; 
This good man&#44; whose candid confession thus feel&#8211; 
ingly spoken may well tend to strike with shame the 
presumptuous scoffer and the vain&#8211;glorious egotist&#44; 
was not one of our brethren&#59; yet we must respect 
virtue wherever we find it&#59; and wherever we see the 
stamp of the similitude to our heavenly Father im&#8211; 
pressed on a man&#44; thither too should our esteem and 
our love be directed. 

But I am leaving the suoject I intended presenting 
to your reflection to&#8211;day&#59; and not to exhaust your pa&#8211; 
tience&#44; I find it necessary to curb the indignant feel&#8211; 
ings which ever rise within me when I hear&#44; or fancy 
I hear&#44; the wisdom&#44; the righteousness&#44; or the goodness 
of God called into question&#44; be this proceeding from 
ignorance&#44; from unbelief&#44; or from wickedness&#59; since 
I conceive either motive extremely prejudicial to&#44; if 
not altogether subversive of&#44; true piety. &#8212; Of all ob&#8211; 
jections raised against the authenticity of the Mosaic 
records&#44; none have aftbrded more fruitful themes of 
declamation to infidels or those who blindly follow 
their silly outpourings&#44; than the conduct of the Deity 
with regard to the tyrannical king of Egypt&#44; who 
oppressed so cruelly our ancestors for many years&#44; 
keeping them under the yoke of the most horrid slav&#8211; 
ery&#44; and dooming the name of Jacob to extermination 
by slaying every male child as soon as it entered the 
world. Let us&#44; therefore&#44; calmly investigate the text&#44; 

<pb n="131"/>

THE PUNISHMENT OF PHARAOH. 131 

and see whether it contains aught clisconsonant with 
the rule of everlasting justice. We read in Exodus 
X. 1&#8211;2 &#58; 

&#34; And the Lord said unto Moses&#44; Go unto Pharaoh &#59; for I have 
caused to be heavy his heart and the heart of his servants&#44; for the 
sake that I might do these my signs in the midst of them. And 
for the sake that thou mightest tell in the ears of thy son and of 
thy son&#39;s son that which I have wrought in Egypt&#44; and my signs 
which I have displayed among them &#59; and you shall know that I 
am the Lord.&#34; 

As I have just said&#44; against this passage it is al&#8211; 
leged&#44; that it is unbecoming in God to harden Pha&#8211; 
raoh&#39;s heart&#44; and then pvinish him for disobedience. 
This I believe is the substance of the charge as far 
as I have ever understood it&#44; and stating it in this 
form&#44; I have given it&#44; I may safely aver&#44; its strongest 
bearing. I will not in refuting it overwhelm you 
with an appeal to the inscrutable wisdom of God&#44; to 
his unwaverhig justice&#44; although this would at once 
convince us that radically there can be nothing wrong 
in the passage&#59; for we may freely say&#44; that God knew 
better than we can know&#44; how far He was justifiable 
to proceed towards Pharaoh without our even daring 
to presume to impugn his justice. This indeed would 
be enough to the humble believer&#44; who always places 
the Lord before his eyes&#44; and whose heart is entire 
with his God. But there are many whose faith is not

well founded&#44; who are vain&#8211;glorious&#44; wise in their own 
eyes&#44; who call perhaps&#44; in their ignorance&#44; the light 
darkness&#44; and the darkness light &#59; and who still&#44; whilst 
always cavilling and fault&#8211;finding&#44; consider themselves 
as Israelites in deeds and in mind &#59; and for the sake 
of such&#44; if any there be among my hearers&#44; and for 
the sake of those who have no confidence in revela&#8211; 
tion&#44; we will endeavour briefly to give convincing 
answers to their doubts and objections. &#8212; It is a fact 
well authenticated&#44; perhaps by the experience of every 
human being&#44; that the habit of doing any thing less&#8211; 
ens its importance in the eyes of him who does it. 
Be this habit one of virtue or of vice&#44; it matters not &#59; 
for by habit vice becomes as necessary to man as the 
exercise of virtue. Ask the drunkard&#44; why he does 
not leave off resorting to the intoxicating draught&#59; 
the gambler&#44; why he does not shun the gaming table &#59; 
the debauchee&#44; why he forsakes not the haunts of the 
ungodly &#59; the man of quarrel and of violence&#44; why he 
constitutes himself the bane and curse of his friends&#58; 
and they will&#44; one and all&#44; tell you that habit has made 
sin so necessary to them&#44; that it is in vain they strive 
against it. This&#44; it is true&#44; is not the case&#44; because 
any habit can be corrected&#59; still it elucidates the 
difficulty under which sin places her votary&#44; and it

not&#44; believe me&#44; Belshazzar alone that revels till the 
clutch of death is on his throat&#59; would to God it were 
so&#33; but alas&#44; millions there are who sport in sin&#44; 
weening the evil day will never come&#44; and they fancy 
themselves placed beyond the reach of retribution. 
Their power is great&#44; their riches are extensive&#44; their 
fair fame stands unimpeached in the eyes of the world&#44; 
they are beloved by their kindred&#44; their health is ro&#8211; 
bust&#44; and their age is yet of the spring of life&#44; what 
have they to fear&#61; let others tremble who are less 
favoured &#59; let those worship who are needy &#59; let those 
practise abstinence who cannot help themselves&#59; let 
those court popularity by benevolence and good deeds 
who are not popular already &#58; what indeed have they&#44; 
the great and favoured&#44; to look for or to fear &#61; Let&#8211; 
now&#44; as said&#44; a small warning be sent to them &#59; let 
them&#44; for instance&#44; be thrown on the couch of sick&#8211; 
ness &#58; do you believe that they will repent of their 
errors&#61; or rather will they not regard disease as in&#8211; 
herent to man&#44; as a thing not worth noticing&#61; Or 
let the Almighty send his angel of death in the midst 
of their dwelling&#44; let him strike down the stem from 
which they have sprung&#59; let him pluck away the 
tender shoot which is to transmit their name to after&#8211; 
ages &#59; let him&#34; take away the partners of their earthly 
journey&#44; whom God has assigned to them as their as&#8211; 
sociates on life&#39;s weary pilgrimage&#58; will they repent&#61; 
no&#59; death&#44; they will say&#44; is humanity&#39;s lot&#44; and the 
warning of God is forgotten. &#8212; Let iw apply these 
facts to the case of Pharaoh. The Egyptians in a 
former age had received with becoming hospitality 
the father and brothers of their great benefactor Jo&#8211; 
seph&#44; who had saved the country from a desolating

famine through his Heaven&#8211;inspired wisdom. An&#8211; 
other generation succeeding had overlooked what 
Joseph had done&#59; and as the Israelites had in the 
meantime grown numerous and powerful&#44; so that the 
land had become full of tliem&#44; they inspired with un&#8211; 
founded fear the nation among which they dwelt. 
The Israelites had a worship differing from the 
Egyptians&#44; and the worshippers of Adonai Shaddai&#44; 
the Lord Almighty&#44; found no sympathy with the fol&#8211; 
lowers of the personified sun and moon&#44; the idols 
Osiris and Isis. Fear begat jealousy&#44; and by degrees 
slavery was decreed the doom of the hated race&#44; and 
the Israelites were compelled to &#39; build treasury&#8211; 
towns for Pharaoh&#44; even Peetom and Rangmesses. 
And they embittered their lives with hard labour&#44; in 
clay and in bricks and in all manner of work in the 
field&#44; and all their work&#44; in which they made them 
work slavishly.&#34; And as if to add insult to injury&#44; 
the people who were oppressed&#44; were soon viewed as 
inferiors&#44; and Jacob&#39;s blood was looked upon as con&#8211; 
taminating to the children of Ham. Yet the increase 
of the enslaved people was not checked&#44; and &#34; the 
more they were oppressed&#44; the more they multiplied&#44; 
and the more they spread out.&#34; And now murder was 
to be added &#59; first Hebrew women were ordered to 
be the executioners of a tyrant&#39;s will &#59; but the noble 
courage of female heroism disdained to purchase 
kingly favour at the expense of the wrath of God. 
And when he found himself foiled&#44; and his mandates 
laughed to scorn&#44; he commanded truer executioners 
to do his work&#44; and &#8211; every Egyptian was empowered 
to throw every Hebrew boy&#44; as soon as born&#44; into 
the Nile. Does not such conduct deserve punish&#8211;

ment&#61; Should the people go unrewarded with con&#8211; 
dign visitation who so faithfully seconded an ungodly 
and murderous mandate &#61; &#8212; And when even our Mo&#8211; 
ses was saved only through an overruling Providence&#44; 
when the child of the chief of his tribe was not safe 
within the mother&#39;s fond embrace&#58; where&#44; I ask you&#44; 
could there be safety &#61; And even after the death of 
this oppressor&#44; the burden of the Israelites was not 
much if any diminished &#59; and when at length Closes 
had readied his eightieth year&#44; the merciful One de&#8211; 
termined that now the cup of misery of his people 
was full&#59; and that the moment had arrived when 
they should be led forth from bondage &#59; and that the 
probation by which they should be educated in the 
fear and the knowledge of the Lord had been com&#8211; 
pletely endured. Moses was therefore despatched to 
Egypt&#39;s king in the name of the eternal Lord&#44; the 
God of Israel&#44; to demand the release of the captives. 
The idolater knew not the Deity in whose name the 
prophet spoke&#44; his priests&#44; his conjurors&#44; his deceiv&#8211; 
ers had not taught him to fear the unseen&#44; the incom&#8211; 
prehensible&#44; the not&#8211;to&#8211;be&#8211;figured God&#59; and is it likely 
that he should obey a mandate of so monstrous a na&#8211; 
ture without some striking&#44; some convincing&#44; proof&#61; 
A proof of Moses&#39;s truth he required. Aaron&#44; by his 
brother&#39;s command&#44; threw down his staff&#44; and it be&#8211; 
came a serpent&#59; but then the magicians pretended 
to do the like by their mysterious arts&#44; &#34; and Pha&#8211; 
raoh&#39;s heart was hard &#40;or strong&#41;&#44;&#34; iQ use the Bible 
phrase&#44; &#34; and he did not listen to them&#44; as the Lord 
had spoken&#44;&#34; when He said &#58; &#34;And I know that the 
king of Egypt will not let you go&#44; and not even with 
a strong hand &#59; and I will stretch out my hand&#44; and 

<pb n="136"/>

136 THE PUNISHMENT OF PHARAOH. 

I will smite Egvpt witli all ray wonders which I will 
do iu the midst thereof&#44; and after that he will dismiss 
you.&#34; Here then we have the plan of God at once 
displayed. Moses was to he sent with the requisition 
for the liheration of the captives &#59; hut God&#44; knowing 
the heart of man&#44; told Moses for his guidance&#44; and 
to inspire him with confidence&#44; that upon his lirst 
demand&#44; upon the lirst punishments even&#44; nothing 
but contumely was to be looked for &#59; and thus speaks 
the verse &#58; &#34;And I know that the king of Egypt will 
not let vou 2&#58;0&#44; and not even with a stronor hand.&#34; 
This assurance was trulv necessarv to be sriven &#58; for 
even the messenger himself&#44; true to human weakness&#44; 
despaired of success&#44; when his first attempt to benefit 
his brethren brought down upon them increased op&#8211; 
pression and hardship. &#8212; And when Moses spoke of 
retribution he said &#58; &#39;&#42; That the first&#8211;born should be 
shiin as a consequence of non&#8211;compliance by Pha&#8211; 
raoh.&#34; While therefore the death of these had not 
taken place&#44; the prophet would have been looked 
upon as a deceiver&#59; it was therefore so ordained&#44; if 
we take the words &#34;hardening of heart&#42;&#42; as they are 
commonly understood&#44; that Pharaoh should not fin&#8211; 
ally relent till the prediction had been fulfilled. &#8212; An&#8211; 
other motive for this conduct of God is given in the 
text I have taken&#58; &#34; That I might do these my signs 
in the midst of them&#58; and for the sake that thou &#40;the 
Israelites&#41; mightest tell what I have done in Egypt 
&#8212; and vou shaU know that I am the Lord&#44;&#34; &#8212; that is 
to say. that Ho the Lord is all&#8211;powerful and irresist&#8211; 
ible&#44; and that his will must be obeyed&#44; no matter if 
a man were ten times to oppose himself to the warn&#8211; 
ings given him&#44; if ten times he were to resist the evi&#8211; 

<pb n="137"/>

THE PUNISHMENT OF PHARAOH. 137 

dence of punishment&#44; that his conduct is hateful in 
the sight of Heaven. And can any one say&#44; that 
Pharaoh and his people did not deserve the punish&#8211; 
ments&#44; the more so&#44; as they did last but a short time&#61; 
But despite of the brevity of their duration&#44; they were 
eminently calculated to strike terror from the severity 
of their effects&#44; and to fill the heart with admiration 
of God&#39;s power from the suddenness and awfulness&#44; 
and wonderfulness with which they were sent. There 
is every reason to believe that the Israelites also had&#44; 
in the lapse of time&#44; become greatly like their mas&#8211; 
ters&#44; addicted to idolatry&#44; and that the pure worship&#44; 
which Abraham had proclaimed&#44; had by degrees 
faded also from their memory. What better method 
could God now employ to reinstruct them of his great&#8211; 
ness and power&#44; than by punishing signally and in 
different manners&#44; those that ruled over them with 
oppressive sway &#61; What could better confirm in their 
minds that it was the Creator of all who had come to 
redeem them&#44; when they with their own eyes beheld 
the order of nature subverted&#61; and must not in this 
way ignorance itself have been taught to acknowl&#8211; 
edge that no one&#44; but He who made all&#44; could work 
those miracles which Moses was the agent to per&#8211; 
form&#61; That the lesson was effectually and indelibly 
inculcated&#44; no one can deny&#59; for even to this day 
we tell to our children of the signs which the Lord 
has done in Egypt&#59; and we ourselves know&#44; and 
other nations will be brought to know&#44; that He is 
the Lord&#44; whose being is without end&#44; and whose 
power is without limit. And all this was effected 
by punishing those meriting punishment&#44; and by de&#8211; 
laying for a few days only the redemption which no

earthly power was able to retard beyond a brief space&#59; 
for Pharaoli himself at last said&#58; &#34; Go you out from 
the midst of my people.&#34; 

The foregoing explanation is founded upon the 
assumption that the words &#42;&#39; I will harden Pharaoh&#39;s 
heart&#34; mean to express an active interference of the 
Deity to prevent him from doing what was asked of 
him. And we have seen that even then there is no 
cause whatever for any reasoning man to complain 
of the justice of God. In acquiescing in the usual 
version of the words I did so merely&#44; because I did not wish to be 
looked upon as though I were anxious to strike out 
a path of my own in commenting on the Bible. 
Nevertheless it appears to me that the phrases I 
have quoted &#58; &#39; I will strengthen his heart&#44;&#34; and &#34; I 
will make hard the heart of Pharaoli&#44;&#34; mean nothing 
more than that the Almighty would allow Pharaoh 
to act according to his natural inclination&#44; conson&#8211; 
antly with his ignorance of the eternal Lord&#39;s power&#44; 
and in conformity with his long course of .sinning 
and tyranny. And let it be observed&#44; that it would 
have sounded incredible&#44; were the Mosaic record to 
tell us that the king of Egypt had dismissed full half 
a million and more of able&#8211;bodied workmen&#44; who 
built his cities&#44; his palaces&#44; and his canals&#44; by the 
command of an outcast and a refugee from justice&#44; 
as Moses confessedly was&#44; or after an unusual oc&#42; 
currence or two&#44; even if there had been a flow of 
blood in the river&#44; or a swarm of frogs&#44; of noxious 
insects&#44; of wild beasts&#44; and of locusts&#44; &#8212; may we may 
add the plagues of a pestilence among cattle&#44; and 
blains upon the bodies of men. We will not refer 

<pb n="139"/>

THE PUNISHMENT OF PHARAOH. 139 

to tlie other plagues&#44; because they were decidedly 
too terrific to be lost sight of&#44; or. to be regarded as of 
trilling import &#58; still&#44; when the hail had ceased&#44; and 
the three days&#39; gloom had been dispelled&#44; it may 
again be said that they were not of that stamp to 
make a proud despot waver&#44; who was considered 
among his people but little less than a god. We 
may therefore assume&#44; that the words &#34; I will har&#8211; 
den Pharaoh&#39;s heart&#34; are only intended to convey&#59; 
that God would not use any direct influence to bring 
about a change of heart or purpose in the king&#44; which 
we must assume would have been in his power&#44; as 
the Proverbs say &#58; &#34; The heart of kings is like water 
in the hand of the Lord&#44; to whithersoever He willeth 
He turneth it&#59;&#34; so also say the prophets&#58; &#34;Assyria 
is the rod of my wrath &#59;&#34; &#34; Cyrus my servant.&#34; And 
God merely announced to Moses&#44; that nothing but 
intense conviction&#44; brought about by the force of 
circumstances&#44; should induce Pharaoh to relent&#44; just 
as is the case with an ordinary sinner&#44; who perse&#8211; 
veres in his misconduct till destruction threatens 
him openly. Thus also answered Moses&#44; when Pha&#8211; 
raoh&#44; during the plague of hail&#44; while thunder and 
lightning and icy stones terrified by their unusual 
violence a lalid in which storms are unknown&#44; said&#44; 
&#34; The Lord is the righteous One&#44; and I and my peo&#8211; 
ple are wicked&#59;&#34; &#39;&#39;And thou and thy people&#44; I know&#44; 
that not 3&#39;et are you afraid of the Lord God&#59;&#34; and 
immediately thereupon we read &#58; &#39;&#39; And when Pha&#8211; 
raoh saw that had ceased the rain&#44; and the hail&#44; and 
the thunder&#44; he repeated to sin&#44; and made heavy his 
heart&#44; himself and his servants.&#34; Let it at the same 
time be observed&#44; that in no one place is it said at 

<pb n="140"/>

140 THE PUNISHMENT OF PHARAOH. 

the announcement of a plague that the Lord would 
prevent Pharaoh from complying&#44; if he were so 
minded. It follows&#44; in consequence&#44; that Pharaoh 
could have averted the punishment&#44; just as at a later 
period the people of Nineveh did&#44; who&#44; hj command 
of their king&#44; returned in sincere repentance&#44; think&#8211; 
ing &#58; &#34; Who that knoweth himself guilty&#44; let him 
return &#59; then the Almighty will change his inten&#8211; 
tion&#44; and leave off from his burning anger&#44; and we 
may not perish.&#34; Indeed no other reason can be 
assigned for the repeated missions of Moses&#44; again 
and again&#44; to the oppressor&#59; but he would not re&#8211; 
lent&#59; he would not let Israel go and sacrifice to the 
Lord &#58; till&#44; and only when&#44; the storm burst over his 
own heart&#44; and when his own son&#44; his first born&#44; who 
was to have sat on his throne&#44; perished before his 
father&#39;s eyes&#44; when every house was one of mourn&#8211; 
ing&#44; when in every home there was a corpse&#44; when 
the land was filled with unheard&#8211;of lamentation. 
Then was no longer any resisting the evident power 
so strongly displayed&#44; and through the force of his 
intense sufierings the order for the dismissal of the 
Israelites was given&#44; and they were fairly driven out 
of the land. If this view of the subject be the cor&#8211; 
rect one&#44; which I conscientiously believe it to be&#44; it 
leaves no other difficulty to encounter&#44; than the pre&#8211; 
diction cited &#58; &#34; And I know that the king of Egypt 
will not let you go.&#34; For some one might say &#58; 
&#34; How could Pharaoh relent&#44; if God knew before&#8211; 
hand how he would act&#61;&#34; But this same question 
would be conclusive argument against our possess&#8211; 
ing a free will in any thing&#44; for our not doing what 
God knows beforehand would be counteracting his 

<pb n="141"/>

omniscience. But here&#44; brethren&#44; our inquiry must 
stop&#59; we are free agents&#44; and so was Pharaoh&#44; as 
well as all other sinners&#59; and how far to reconcile 
this fact with the knowledge of God&#44; is not for us to 
inquire &#59; for this would be arrogating to ourselves 
wisdom and knowledge equal to the ever&#8211;blessed and 
exalted One. But at this point we should submit&#44; 
and never disturb ourselves with the perplexing re&#8211; 
flection &#59; for no human research will ever be able to 
understand a question which there are no means of 
solving&#44; unless God himself should vouchsafe an 
especial revelation&#44; and tender us a greater share of 
knowledge of his ways than is yet in our possession. 
In the foregoing&#44; I have briefly endeavoured to an&#8211; 
swer an objection on which infidels rely so much. 
I approached it&#44; as I have done on other questions&#44; 
with no view of showing my skill as a disputant&#44; but 
solely as an humble vindicator of the pure word of 
God. &#8212; I trust&#44; that his spirit has guided me sufiici&#8211; 
ently to confirm jour minds&#44; if not altogether to re&#8211; 
move every doubt. One more worthy&#44; more learned&#44; 
and more able&#44; might doubtless have done the sub&#8211; 
ject more justice &#59; but such as I am&#44; I sincerely hope&#44; 
that the arguments adduced and the illustrations 
given have proved to you &#40;at least they have done 
so to my self j that &#34; the law of God is perfect&#44; it re&#8211; 
fresheth the soul &#59; the judgments of the Lord are 
upright&#44; they are righteous together&#44;&#34; and that ob&#8211; 
jections raised only tend to confirm the believer the 
stronger in his well&#8211;founded faith. All believing in 
the Lord&#39;s truth&#44; and confiding in his law&#44; are the 
balm of life&#44; the source of peace of mind on earth&#44; 
and of unending delight hereafter &#59; but to doubt of 

<pb n="142"/>

his rectitude&#44; to waver in our faith&#44; will lead to in&#8211; 
evitable destruction. It is not blind faith&#44; a confi&#8211; 
dence in things or dogmas not understood&#44; that is 
demanded &#59; but a conviction that in God there is no 
fault&#44; and that whatever is inexplicable to us of his 
workings towards ourselves and others is ascribable&#44; 
not to Him&#44; but to our imperfect vision and to our 
circumscribed knowledge&#44; which cannot be removed 
till we have cast off the mortal coil&#44; which now en&#8211; 
cumbers our souls in this state Of probation. And 
thus we read in the last verse of Hosea &#58; &#34; Who is 
wise and marketh it&#44; intelligent and knoweth it&#44; that 
faultless are the ways of the Lord&#44; and the righteous 
walk therein&#44; but the wicked stumble upon them.&#34; 
Let us then be the righteous&#44; whose meekness sees 
nothing but justice in the ways of God&#59; and let us 
shun the thoughts of the wicked&#44; who would dare to 
rise in judgment against Him who is Almighty in 
strength and All&#8211;powerful&#44; and whose wisdom is with&#8211; 
out measure &#33; 

Father &#33; Thou spokest through thy prophet that 
Thou wouldst be a small sanctuary to us in our cap&#8211;

from the stranger to thy name and worship may 
reach us. And if in our obduracy we should go 
astray&#44; if we will join in our wickedness the nations 
of the earth&#44; and be like them &#58; then let the outpoured 
anger&#44; which Thou hast threatened through thy pro&#8211; 
phet Ezekiel&#44; fall on us in mercy&#44; and guide us&#44; 
through it&#44; back to thy service &#59; for we know that in 
punishing even Thou only wiliest our own happiness. 
May it be also thy will&#44; O our Father and God of our 
ancestors&#33; that this congregation&#44; the children of the 
house of the Hope of Israel&#44; may ever be acceptable 
to Thee&#44; and may thy protection be held out over this 
house&#44; that it may never want for those wdio will flock 
to it to worship Thee after the ordinances of thy law. 
And do Thou&#44; in thy infinite mercy&#44; grant us peace 
and prosperity&#44; and remove from among us causeless 
hatred and envy&#44; and plant thy love and thy fear in 
our hearts that we may not sin &#59; so that walking in 
thy presence we may be worthy of thy favour&#44; together

Institutions&#44; human and divine&#44; have been devised 
to prevent the doing of evil&#44; commands upon com&#8211; 
mands have been promulgated to admonish the world 
against the commission of wrong&#59; and jet we see the 
ri&#33;a&#58;ht&#44; the universally acknowledged right &#44; disregard&#8211; 
ed&#44; and the universally admitted wrong daily prac&#8211; 
tised. This fact is by no means flattering&#58; to our self&#8211; 
love&#44; nor is it without its baneful eff&#39;ects upon the 
spectators of the wrong that is done. The evil com&#8211; 
mitted by the parent is an excuse for the child and 
the grandchild to go and do likewise&#44; and the way of 
death&#44; if trodden by the mother&#44; appears a path lead&#8211; 
ing to endless pleasures to the thoughtless daughter. 
The pretext is that the child need not be better than

the father&#44; as though the wrong committed by one 
could be beautified by its being farther propagated in 
a succeeding generation. And what can be more 
absurd than such reasoning&#44; if reasoning it can be 
called&#61; is one man to stammer because his father was 
heavy of speech&#61; is one to limp because his mother 
was lame&#61; is one brother to endeavour to become 
cross&#8211;eyed&#44; because the eldest of the family has un&#8211; 
fortunately an obliquity of vision &#61; True&#44; the moralist 
has to acknowledge&#44; that the mania called fashion has 
at times made lisping seem a beauty in speaking&#44; and 
has imposed upon the multitude modes of dress and 
habits of life extremely pernicious to health or even 
to personal beauty&#44; which is endeavoured to be pro&#8211; 
moted by them. But is it reasonable that religion 
and morality should accommodate themselves to de&#8211; 
formity&#44; because deformity has become fashionable&#44;

as a matter not so much to be abhorred&#59; and looking 
only at the surface of things&#44; if an action is not very 
abhorrent&#44; it may be attempted&#44; and if it be once at&#8211; 
tempted&#44; the commission of it&#44; and the satisfaction 
its contemplation in thought affords&#44; render it at 
length as something more desirable even than the 
opposite virtue. But the impunity with which sin is 
practised is more apparent than real&#59; for though the 
lightning of Heaven does not immediately consume 
the blasphemer&#59; for though the sudden pestilence 
does not annihilate instantly the Sabbath&#8211;breaker&#59; 
for though the earth does not open and swallow up&#44; 
like in times of old the rebellious Korah&#44; those who 
violate the covenant of Abraham&#44; to whom God spoke 
&#34;Walk before me and be perfect&#58;&#34; still the sinners 
may rest assured that their sin is not forgotten&#44; and 
that not one action of theirs will go ultimately with&#8211; 
out its condign visitation. And then God&#44; our Fa&#8211; 
ther&#44; is a merciful Being&#44; who waits with long pati&#8211; 
ence and paternal kindness to see whether the strayed 
one will not return to his embrace&#44; and&#44; throwing off 
his load of guilt&#44; exclaim in the sincerity of a reno&#8211;

sinner will never repent&#44; that year after year&#44; month 
after month&#44; week after week&#44; day after day&#44; nay&#44; 
hour after hour&#44; he increases the amount of debt he 
incurs to God&#58; yet we may rest assured&#44; that no

if even no cloud whatever should darken the pros&#8211; 
perity of the wicked one&#44; if no gnawing&#44; no compunc&#8211; 
tion&#44; of a disturbed overcharged conscience should 
ever disturb his waking thoughts or his sleeping 
hours &#58; still a life of earthly bliss may be followed by 
those awful torments&#44; pains and punishments to which 
the holy Scriptures allude&#44; but of which no particular 
description has been vouchsafed to us. And of this 
speaks Isaiah in the end of his prophecy&#58; &#34;And they 
will go out and look at the corpses of the men&#44; who 
have acted wickedly towards me &#59; for their worm shall 
not die&#44; nor their fire be quenched &#59; and theyshall be 
an abomination to all flesh.&#34; It is true that many 
persons ridicule the idea of punishment after death &#59; 
but their ridicule does in nowise remove the fact of 
its being so. And grant&#44; that the belief we entertain 
were not founded upon fact&#58; at all events there can&#8211; 
not be any doubt of the possibility of a continuance 
to exist after this mortal body has been dissolved 
again into dust and ashes&#44; and of the likelihood that&#44; 
as there is an existence separate and distinct from 
earthly existence&#44; there may also be reward and pun&#8211; 
ishment separate and distinct from earthly reward and 
punishment. &#8212; We must admit&#44; that the existence of a 
soul entirely Severed from the body&#44; the existence of 
a spirit without the slightest attributes of matter&#44; is 
something very difficult of comprehension to us&#59; but 
on the other hand&#44; such a state of things is not by 
any means impossible&#44; even according to the views 
of a worldly philosophy &#59; and no one dares to deny at 
least this possibility&#44; till he has&#44; more than has been 
done hitherto&#44; found out the hidden properties of

provements in the arts and sciences&#44; the progress in 
civilization&#44; which late years have witnessed&#44; to prove 
the existence of a peculiar essence&#44; which we for want 
of a better term call the human soul&#44; which is differ&#8211;

the body. &#8212; And can it be possible&#44; even if there were 
no light from revelation to inform us&#44; that a system 
so noble&#44; so incomprehensibly great&#44; could have been 
created for no other purpose than to enable a hand&#8211; 
somer mould of clay than that of the dog to live only

earth in search of adventure&#44; and direct his searching 
gaze into the starry heaven &#58; would God have given 
him such vast&#44; extensive powers&#44; I ask&#44; merely that he 
might be liable to more distress&#44; subject to more mis&#8211; 
fortunes&#44; exposed to more diseases than the dog&#44; but 
like him to die away into non&#8211;existence &#61; &#8212; The idea 
is too monstrous to be assumed&#44; even for argument&#39;s 
sake&#44; as reasonable&#59; and we may freely assert&#44; that 
the doctrine of the immortality of the soul will only 
be disputed by the wricked transgressor of God&#39;s law&#44; 
who thereby vainly hopes to steel his heart against 
the self&#8211;accusations of his own conscience&#44; that he 
may be enabled to follow the path of sin without any 
compunctious visiting of his inward monitor. 

For the sake therefore of following the bent of a 
sinful inclination&#44; for the purpose of chiming in with 
a pernicious fashion which leads to ungodliness&#44; does 
the reckless sinner deny the most consolatory hope 
which religion and revelation impart&#44; and thereby he 
incurs the more deservedly the very punishment 
which he vainly strives to reason away&#44; as though 
reasoning&#44; even the most plausible&#44; were in the least 
able to remove what is true. &#8212; But brightly beams the 
light of hope for those who are watchful over their 
deeds&#44; for the humble and the pious&#44; who&#44; when suf&#8211;

to escape&#44; look upon the world beyond the grave as

of his unending and unchanging favour. And thus 
said Solomon in his Ecclesiastes&#44; eighth chapter&#44; 11th 
and 12th verses&#58; &#34;Because punishment doth not fol&#8211; 
low evil deeds quickly&#44; therefore becometh the heart 
of the children of men careless and practiseth the

and experience indulgence &#58; yet am I convinced&#44; that 
true happiness will be the sure recompense of those 
that fear God&#44; while they fear Him.&#34; &#8212; And yet people 
doubt&#44; and become faint&#8211;hearted under every tribula&#8211; 
tion&#44; and when sorrow and trouble enter their doors 
in the round Avhich the evil destiny takes in the world&#44; 
they imagine their own misfortune the most grievous&#44; 
and they accuse the Deity of injustice in heaping so 
much distress upon them who are so very innocent&#44; 
so very charitable&#44; so much devoted to the practice 
of religious duties &#33; And as they see their neighbours&#39; 
faces drest up with smiles&#44; as they behold their friends 
in apparent happiness&#44; as they do not discover that 
their enemies have any cause to complain &#58; they come 
to the conclusion that they themselves alone are un&#8211; 
happy&#59; and they ask&#44; what advantage it can be to 
them that they practise so much self&#8211;denial in the 
cause of religion and the exe.rcise of humanity&#44; since

cause they have found out&#44; that they in the exercise 
of both suffered misfortunes which&#44; as said&#44; they be&#8211; 
lieve others did not encounter. &#8212; But such arguing is 
altogether false. Those&#44; whose faces bear the ever&#8211; 
lasting smile are not necessarily happy &#59; those whom 
the world terms fortunate are not always to be envied&#59; 
and but lift the veil which hides their inmost heart&#44; 
and you might weep over the distresses of the smiling 
sufferer &#59; could you but dive into the soul of the en&#8211; 
vied happy one&#44; you would be startled at the accu&#8211; 
mulation of wo you would there discover. And as 
for the idea that those who are irreligious and dishon&#8211; 
est have the advantage over you who are suffering 
the accumulated ills of life &#58; it is all again but out&#8211; 
ward show &#59; impiety&#44; although it scoff&#39;s&#44; is still but a 
wretched defence against the canker&#8211;worm of con&#8211; 
science &#58; and he who luxuriates in the spoils abstracted 
from the deceived friend&#44; from the confiding stranger&#44; 
the beguiled widow&#44; and the helpless orphan&#44; though 
a credulous world flatter and fawn upon him&#44; he too 
is at heart a wretch&#44; tormented beyond endurance&#44; 
fearing exposure&#44; dreading the loss of a reputation 
which he has endeavoured to establish&#44; and trembling 
at the thought of being deprived of that ill&#8211;gotten 
wealth&#44; to obtain which he has sold his immortal soul 
to perdition. &#8212; This much may be said in answer to 
the complaint&#44; that we alone are suffering. And in 
reply to the accusation of God&#39;s justice&#44; as though He 
punished us when not deserving it&#44; we should consider 
that not one of us is free from fault&#44; that not one of 
us can boast of having never infringed the laws which 
God has ordained. If then we do suffer&#44; let us not 
forget that we are sinning mortals&#44; and that the inflic&#8211;

tion is sent to admonish us that we have erred&#44; or to 
warn us that the path we were intending to pursue 
was one of perdition. For God&#44; who knows the 
thoughts of men even before they are accomphshed&#44; 
sends us tokens of displeasure at our intended con&#8211; 
duct&#44; if we have in other cases followed his will &#59; as 
the prophetess says&#44; &#34;He guardeth the feet of his 
righteous ones&#59;&#34; and as Ezekiel says in another place&#44; 
&#34;And what riseth on your heart shall not be done.&#34; 
Now&#44; therefore&#44; if such a warning is sent we should&#44; 
in place of repining&#44; investigate and see in Avhat we 
have been sinning&#44; and amend our lives while there 
is yet time&#44; before the sands in the hourglass of life 
have entirely run to waste&#59; and if we committed any 
wrong&#44; if our uniform prosperity caused our hearts 
to wax proud and our soul to become presumptuous &#58; 
we should bow with thankfulness to the chastisement&#44; 
and bless the all&#8211;wise One for having stretched out as 
it were his potent hand&#44; and snatched us as a firebrand 
from amidst the consuming fire. 

But if we grumble at the dispensation instead of 
repenting &#59; if we will not heed the warning when it 
is kindly given&#59; if we resist the whisperings of the 
holy spirit which tells us to beware &#59; if we&#44; in short&#44;&#8211; 
hurry down the road which leads to the pit of de&#8211;

which was beyond their endurance&#44;&#42; and those who 
have stood firm amidst their trials&#44; how purely have 
they come out of the furnace in which their integrity 
had been probed. &#8212; Besides the cause of sin just ex&#8211; 
posed there is another which assumes the air of a 
philanthropic and even a pious cast of reasoning&#44; and 
thus militates against the dictates of revealed religion. 
Persons wishing to free themselves from religious 
observances assert constantly&#44; that the law could not 
possibly have been intended to act with such burden&#8211; 
some severity upon us. They say&#44; the benignant 
Being whom we adore could not have any pleasure 
in our punishing our bodies with fasting&#59; He who 
loves all his creatures alike could never think to lay 
Israel under so many and disadvantageous restrictions 
as regards the observance of the Sabbaths and the 
holy days &#59; the abstaining from forbidden food &#59; the 
restriction with regard to forming family connexions 
with persons of other nations&#44; and laws of similar im&#8211; 
port&#59; and some even inveigh with apparent bitterness 
and sincerity against the sealing of our children with 

&#42; This brings to my mind the affecting history of an Israelitish 
female&#44; who in the midst of the sack of the town in which she lived 
saw a brutal soldier entering her apartment. He endeavoured to 
seize her &#59; &#34; Stop&#44;&#34; she said&#44; &#34; I can give you a charm which if you 
wear it will prevent your being wounded.&#34; The soldier incredu&#8211; 
lous asked her if she was in earnest&#59; &#34;I am perfectly in earnest&#44; 
and to prove my sincerity you may fire at me as I hold this paper 
to my heart.&#34; She stood firm &#59; held a paper upon which the pre&#8211; 
tended charm was written to her heart&#44; the soldier fired&#44; and to his 
amazement the Jewish maiden lay a bleeding corpse at his feet &#59; she 
died&#44; but her&#39;spirit came undefiled before her 3Iaker. Thus we see 
that&#44; as this example partly illustrates&#44; there is no situation in which 
the righteous are altogether without that heavenly assistance which 
always comes to their aid.

the covenant of Abraham&#44; as cruel and barbarous. &#8212; 
And such reasoning as this it is by which people mis&#8211; 
lead themselves and others. &#34; God&#44;&#34; they say&#44; &#34; could 
not command such things&#59;&#34; but we say and maintain 
He did command them&#44; and moj&#39;eover threatens pun&#8211; 
ishment for non&#8211;obedience. Now even waive this&#59; 
and what does the objection amount to&#61; to no more 
than this &#58; that whereas persons find the Jewish law 
demanding certain trials of their faith&#44; which cannot 
under ordinary contingencies cause the most remote 
actual harm&#44; and being unwilling to make any sac&#8211; 
rifices whatever except such as tally precisely with 
their notions of justice and conscience&#44; they reject 
them at once as unreasonable. Is this not true &#61; But 
let us take a few of the objections and review them 
in brief detail&#44; &#8212; &#34;God cannot &#8211;wish that we should 
fast&#44;&#34; the lukewarm assert. But we say He does 
wish it&#44; provided the punishing of the body is accom&#8211; 
panied by a sincere repentance and by a knowledge 
why and wherefore we fast&#44; that is to say&#44; that in 
doing penance we direct our thoughts and our prayers 
to the almighty One from whom all forgiveness must 
come. &#8212; Even without this absolute preparation for 
repentance there is one day of penance ordained&#44; on 
which every Israelite is to abstain from food and 
drink &#59; by which it was intended to effect&#44; that at the 
annual recurrence of so solemn a day&#44; many&#44; if not 
all&#44; should be led to look into their deeds and to amend 
whatever they might find defective&#44; and to endeavour 
to heal up breaches of social friendship and brotherly 
love&#44; which clashing interests may have interrupted 
in other periods of the year. &#8212; Is such an institution

From amidst the mass of idolaters&#44; worshippers of 
graven and hewn images&#44; God wanted to select a 
people to be his own peculiar treasure for ever&#59; and 
He appeared to them when they groaned under 
heavy afflictions&#44; and redeemed them from servitude 
to freedom on the day the anniversary whereof we 
are soon to celebrate. &#8212; His people they were to be&#44; 
to receive his holy laws as a trust&#44; although it should 
ultimately be made the rule of life for all mankind&#44; 
when they had become fit for the pure ideal worship 
of his holiness and greatness. To prevent their be&#8211; 
ing mixed up with other nations He cast their lot in 
the most lovely portion&#44; and He surrounded the sons 
of Jacob with a wall of defence as it were&#44; by impart&#8211; 
ing to them peculiar statutes and ordinances&#44; and He 
gave them in love and kindness his Sabbaths of rest 
and his holy days for rejoicing&#44; and He interdicted 
them from mingling in the indulgencies of the animal 
frame with the nations of the earth &#59; and He there&#8211; 
fore forbade things to these permitted&#59; and also&#44; as 
the Israelites were but the fewest of nations. He or&#8211; 
dained that no Jew should take as the wife of his 
bosom the daughter of the stranger&#44; lest by so doing 
the name of Jacob might become lost from amongst 
the nations bf the earth. &#8212; And from our birth we 
were bouglit as God&#39;s servants&#44; and therefore when 
one week has passed over the infant&#39;s head the seal

sinning &#59; but let no one dare to tell us that we are 
sinning&#59; we must needs hate him who reveals us to 
ourselves&#59; and thus we go on calUng our teachers 
bigots and fanatics&#44; and flatter ourselves that this is

selves to our view&#59; the task however has been but 
very imperfectly accomplished&#44; since so little has been

said of what suggests itself upon even a cursory view 
of the subject. But as it is one so fruitful in con&#8211; 
templation&#44; I may call your attention to it again per&#8211; 
haps in a short time. &#8212; Having now in a measure ex&#8211; 
posed by the light of reason and sound common sense&#44; 
alone&#44; the folly of the motives of sin&#44; let us turn our 
attention to the concurrent announcements of proph&#8211; 
ecy&#44; which treat upon the subject. Malachi says&#44; 
chapter iii.&#44; verse 5&#58; 

&#34;And I will come near unto you for judgment&#44; and I will be a 
swift witness against wizards&#44; and adulterers&#44; and those that swear 
falsely&#44; and that withhold the pay of the hireling&#44; and that injure 
the widow&#44; the orphan&#44; and pervert the cause of the stranger&#44; and 
did not fear me&#44; saith the Lord of Zebaoth. For I the Lord change 
not&#44; and you&#44; children of Jacob do not perish.&#34; 

Here the prophet announces the punishment which 
is to befal the transgressors against the law of God&#44; 
and confirms the certainty thereof&#44; by stating that He&#44; 
the Lord&#44; changes not&#44; and consequently&#44; if the pun&#8211; 
ishment be even deferred&#44; the day of judgment will 
come at length&#44; when the unchangeable One will be 
sure to mete out even&#8211;handed justice. And continues 
the prophet &#58; &#34; And you shall go out and see the dif&#8211; 
ference between the righteous and the wicked&#44; be&#8211; 
tween him that served God and him that hath not

served Him. For behold the day will come burning 
like a furnace&#44; and all the transgressors and evil&#8211;doers 
shall be like straw&#44; and it shall burn them up the day 
that Cometh&#44; saith the Lord of Zebaoth&#44; who will not 
leave them root nor branch. &#8212; But to you who fear 
my name&#44; the sun of righteousness shall shine&#44; and 
healing shall be in his wings.&#34; In the same strain 
speaks Isaiah&#44; chapter Ixv. &#58; &#34; I have spread out my 
hands all the day to a rebellious people&#44; that .go the 
way which is not good after their own thoughts&#44; a 

people that sit upon graves&#44; and lodge among the 

monuments&#44; that eat the flesh of the swine&#44; and broth 
of abominable things is in their vessels&#44; that say&#44; 
&#42; Stand by thyself&#44; come not near me &#59; I am holier than 
thou&#59;&#39; these are smoke in my nostrils&#44; a fire that burn&#8211; 
eth all the day.&#34; &#8212; And says Isaiah&#58; &#34;Thus saith the 
Lord&#44; As the new wine is found in the grape&#59; and 
one saith&#44; Destroy it not&#44; for a blessing is in it&#58; so 
will I do for my servant&#39;s sake&#44; not to destroy the 
whole &#59; and I will bring out from Jacob a seed&#44; and 
from Judah an inheritor of my mountains &#59; and my 
elect shall inherit it&#44; and my servants shall dwell there. 
&#8212; But you that forsake the Lord &#8212; behold my servants 
shall eat and you shall be hungry&#59; behold my servants 
shall drink&#44; .and you shall be thirsty &#59; behold my ser&#8211; 
vants shall be glad&#44; and you shall be ashamed &#59; be&#8211; 
hold my servants shall shout from a joyous heart&#44; and 
you shall cry from a heart of pain&#44; and howl from a 
broken spirit.&#34; &#8212; And in conclusion he says of the 
righteous &#58; &#34;And it shall come to pass&#44; that &#39;ere they 
yet call&#44; I will answer&#44; while yet they are speaking&#44; 
I will hear.&#34; &#8212; Ezekiel also confirms the foregoing 
promises&#44; when saying&#44; chapter xx. &#58; &#34; As sure as I live&#44;

saitli the Lord God&#44; if not Avitli a strong hand and an 
outstretched arm&#44; and with wrath poured forth I will 
rule over you.&#34; &#8212; And farther&#58; &#34;And I will cause you 
to pass under the rod&#44; and bring you then in the cov&#8211; 
enant which has been handed down. And I will se&#8211; 
lect from among you those that have rebelled and 
transgressed against me&#44; from the land of their so&#8211; 
journing I will bring them out&#44; but to the land of Is&#8211; 
rael they shall not come&#44; and you shall know that I 
am the Lord.&#34; &#8212; I have in the above endeavoured to 
give you a few passages&#44; selected from a very large 
number&#44; to prove that the judgment of God must 
sooner or later overtake the transgressors&#44; and if his 
mercy should delay the punishment&#44; it is nevertheless 
only deferred&#44; not relinquished. &#8212; What has thus been 
proved by common sense and Holy Writ&#44; and what 
your own experience so amply confirms&#44; requires no 
admonition to recommend to your serious attention. 
Let it then sink deeply into your hearts&#44; you who are 
from the house of Israel&#44; you who have in your an&#8211; 
cestors partaken of the miraculous deliverance from 
Egypt&#59; let it be a lesson never to be forgotten&#44; that 
upon the way of religion there is ultimate life&#44; al&#8211; 
though the&#42; path be beset by dangers and pain &#59; and 
that the road of sin leads to destruction&#44; although its 
first appearance may be ever so inciting&#44; and seem&#8211; 
ingly invite you to a multitude of pleasures. &#8212; You 
who are fathers &#33; you who are mothers 1 impress on 
your children&#39;s minds&#44; that those alone who love God 
can have peace&#44; but that to the wicked there is no 
peace&#33; and you youth and maidens who wish to&#8211; reach 
a happy old age&#44; and who desire a tranquil and peace&#8211; 
ful end&#44; remember that long life and happiness&#44; and

peace of mind&#44; and the favour of God are only to be 
found upon the way of righteousness. 

Father above &#33; Thine be the glory and the kingdom&#44; 
as already Thine are the power&#44; the greatness&#44; and 
goodness. Let thy countenance sliine unto all the 
world&#44; and&#34; call and guide all children of men to thy 
holy service. And grant to us&#44; thy people&#44; whom Thou 
didst redeem from Egypt by thy power which Thou 
didst display&#44; thy fatherly protection&#44; and preserve us 
from annihilation in our captivity. And &#33; cause thy 
kingdom to take root in our hearts&#44; and incline our 
souls to return to Thee in sincerity. And when Thou 
comest to chastise us for our transgressions&#44; re&#8211; 
member then that we are flesh&#44; sinners like our 
fathers. And may it be thy will to remember again 
the seed of Jacob in favour&#44; and send us thy anointed 
servant&#44; the Messiah&#44; son of David&#44; and again show 
us wonders&#44; as Thou didst when we wxnt forth from 
Egypt. Amen.

To the man whose eyes are opened by a knowledge 
of the way of righteousness &#59; to the soul that adores 
her God and Creator &#59; to the mind filled with love 
for mankind&#44; it must be a matter of surprise and 
grief to observe&#44; among the multifarious and varied 
classes that constitute the mass of mankind&#44; so little 
perception of the utility and necessity of a religious 
education for their children&#44; or of the duty every one 
is under to make himself familiar with the behests of 
revelation. What pains are not taken to teach our 
children the tongues of various nations &#59; how much

labour is not spent in the pursuit of worldly sciences&#59; 
what stress is not laid upon the acquisition of mere ac&#8211; 
complishment even &#59; &#8212; but only touch the subject of 
religion and branches therewith connected&#44; and you 
are at once told&#44; that it is quite useless to learn He&#8211; 
brew&#44; a language no more spoken&#44; consequently of 
no&#8211; practical use &#59; and as for religious knowledge &#8212; 
that can be obtained by reading the sacred writings&#59; 
and morality can be gotten very easily by going to 
churches of the various sects amono&#58;stwhom we live&#58; 
practical knowledge of political sciences are promul&#8211; 
gated in worldly schools&#59; and consequently there 
can be no necessity for spending years&#44; and months&#44; 
and days in the obtainment of religious information&#44; 
properly so termed. That such reasoning prevails&#44; 
cannot be denied&#44; and that it is very fallacious and 
very pernicious&#44; must be evident from the first view 
a candid man takes of the subject. Still so many 
are misled&#44; and so many have become irreligious&#44; im&#8211; 
moral&#44; and I fear infidel&#44; that I beg you&#44; my brethren&#44; 
to bear with me whilst I endeavour to show the ne&#8211; 
cessity of a particular religious education for our 
children&#44; and the obligation which rests upon parents 
to qualify themselves for the holy task incumbent on 
them&#44; as lathers and mothers&#44; of bringing up the 
pledges of conjugal love&#44; the trust confided to them 
by God&#44; in the way which best comports with the 
love and duty which the creature owes to the Crea&#8211; 
tor&#44; and which secures in the best possible manner 
individual and general happiness. I have alluded to 
a knowledge of the Hebrew as in some manner con&#8211; 
nected with religion &#59; and since all our forms of wor&#8211; 
ship and our sacred records are in that language &#58; it

may not be out of place to offer a few observations to 
prove tbe necessity of retaining it in our worship&#44; 
and to deprecate a substitution of any other in its 
stead. A national tongue binds together the people 
speaking it in one bond&#44; and cements a union hardly 
otherwise attainable. Such a thing may be&#44; as na&#8211; 
tions or tribes speaking different languages being 
governed by the same law &#59; but where is that fellow&#8211; 
feeling&#44; that brotherly attachment which people of 
the same speech feel&#61; Not to go farther than a 
neighbouring country&#44;&#42; which was conquered now 
about eighty years ago&#44; where the people have never 
been molested&#44; as far as I know&#44; in their laws&#44; privi&#8211; 
leges&#44; and even mere prejudices&#59; add to which that 
the benefits of an extension of wholesome laws&#44; of 
freedom from public burdens&#44; of a wide&#8211;spreading 
commerce have been conferred&#58; and still the differ&#8211; 
ence of language between the rulers and the ruled 
has been the constant cause of heart&#8211;burning and 
contention&#44; and a united effort for the public good 
is hardly thought of. Let us apply this single fact&#44; 
which can be strengthened by a thousand others&#44; 
from ancient and modern story&#44; to our own case. 
In the land of the East&#44; where first were cradled 
the germs of civilization and knowledge&#44; our nation 
sprung up like a tender sprout&#44; like a feeble shoot&#44; 
from amidst the multitudes of nations. Abraham 
wandered out of his father&#39;s idolatrous home and 
went forth over the fair regions of the South&#44; the 
harbinger of peace wherever he came. He spoke 

&#42; Canada&#44; where the French is the vernacular in the eastern por&#8211; 
ion.

the language of Sliem his ancestor&#44; a language forci&#8211; 
ble and clear&#44; full of elegant imagery and true to na&#8211; 
ture in its figures and sublime conceptions. With the 
growth of the people the language also grew into a 
national dialect&#44; and even in the midst of the power&#8211; 
ful and polished state of Egypt the Israelites still re&#8211; 
tained the language of Heber. Think you&#44; it was a 
close bond during their dreadful sufferings&#61; Most 
undoubtedly &#59; and what better could have been found 
to make their hearts glow with rapturous hope&#44; when 
the father bondman told to the child&#44; whose prospect 
too was slavety and bondage&#44; of the wonders which 
God had displayed unto their simple shepherd&#8211;ances&#8211; 
tors&#44; and how He had promised &#40;using the sacred 
words of the holy Jacob&#41; &#34; And God will be with you&#44; and bring 
you back to the land of your fathers &#34; Think you 
that hope could have fled at words like these &#61; Think 
you that the language too did not fall on the ear like 
sweet music which bids the mourning soul rejoice &#61; &#8212; 
Anon the law was given&#44; and in words clear and dis&#8211; 
tinct the Most High announced his will. &#8212; The words 
spoken we bave read this day and the language again 
was the language of Abraham. Israel conquered the 
land of pronlise&#44; and dwelt in their inheritance in se&#8211; 
curity. And nobly too did the language do its work&#44; 
and there arose a Deborah to sing the song&#59; there 
Avas a David&#44; who attuned his harp to inimitable and 
undying praise &#59; there was a Solomon&#44; whose wisdom 
yet teaches the world&#59; an Isaiah&#44; whose eloquence yet 
rouses the heart &#59; a Jeremiah&#44; who yet bids the tears 
to flow at the dow ifall of the populous city&#44; &#8212; and a 
host of others&#44; whose genius and whose piety must

in all ages command admiration. And when Israel 
fell&#44; because they had become sinful&#44; and when the 
language was supplanted by the speech of various 
nations &#58; it found restorers in Ezra&#44; Nehemiah&#44; Zech&#8211; 
ariah&#44; and Malachi&#44; besides many naore who as&#8211; 
sisted them in the holy task. And although the 
Hebrew has been banished by our dispersion from 
being our every&#8211;day language &#58; it yet holds&#44; I may 
freely say&#44; a higher place&#44; it embraces all that re&#8211; 
mains of the wisdom of our ancestors &#59; nay more&#44; it 
contains all the commands which God revealed to 
mankind for their guidance &#33; This ife the Hebrew&#44; 
and this is briefly its history. Despite now of our dis&#8211; 
persion &#8212; despite of our being&#44; alas&#33; known as Ameri&#8211; 
cans&#44; Englishmen&#44; Frenchmen&#44; Germans&#44; Poles&#44; Gre&#8211; 
cians&#44; Tartars&#44; and by numerous other names &#58; still the 
Hebrew has always maintained its position in the love 
and the heart of all true Israelites&#44; and has also con&#8211; 
stituted the bond which has kept united the captivity 
of Jacob in all parts of the world &#33; And here comes 
one from the burning plains of Africa&#59; there another 
from the icy iields of the Arctic regions &#59; yonder pil&#8211; 
grim calls the highlands of Middle Asia his home &#59; 
and this one is an exile from Spain&#39;s blood&#8211;stained 
sierras. And listen &#33; as the messeyiger addresses the 
throne of Grace&#44; how a simultaneous Amen bursts 
from all their lips &#33; the language they hear is not to 
them the language of the stranger&#44; the sounds&#44; though 
ancient sounds&#44; are to their ears familiar as the first 
breathing of childhood&#39;s years&#44; and in the land of 
their exile&#44; where they all meet but as strangers&#44; the 
holy tongue is their bond&#44; and by it they do meet as 
a band of brothers&#44; and all thus unite to call with one

voice upon their God&#44; who is truly the Preserver of 
Israel. &#8212; Does it then comport with reason to retain 
the knowledge of so great a gift&#61; or shall we idly 
throw it off as a thing whose value is lost&#59; forsake it 
as a spring whose waters are dried up &#61; Never may 
this be &#33; The blessing which this inheritance has al&#8211; 
ways bestowed is of yet daily recurrence&#44; and who 
would madly neglect what is of vital importance to 
him &#61; Thus you have presented to you&#44; brethren&#44; an 
illustration&#44; an argument would require more time&#44; 
of the object and advantage of the Hebrew to us&#44; as 
Jews. It is&#44; namely&#44; our national&#44; our vernacular 
tongue&#59; it is one of the links in that great chain 
which has ever firmly bound Israel together as one 
people. I take it for granted&#44; that there are but few 
who wish its knowledge altogether extirpated&#59; but 
still there are also an immense number&#44; especially in 
this country&#44; and I grieve to say in this city&#44; perhaps 
among those who now hear me&#44; that think but lightly 
of the importance of its acquisition by a careful study. 
But as the acquaintance with an instrument so valu&#8211; 
able must be in the same proportion useful&#44; it is cer&#8211; 
tainly a matter of surprise that no more is done to 
further the means of its attainment. As a mere mat&#8211; 
ter of curiositjr much is studied &#59; more things again 
receive attention solely because they are elegant&#59; 
and therefore it is inconceivable&#44; how a Jew can rest 
satisfied with an entire ignorance of his sacred lan&#8211; 
guage&#44; when the opportunity for the removal of such 
unpardonable ignorance is within his reach. Even 
if means were not readily at hand&#44; I should still think 
it the daty of every Israelite&#44; no matter of what sex&#44; 
station&#44; or capacity&#44; to endeavoar to remedy the de&#8211;

feet witli regard to teaching&#44; or in other words&#44; schools 
should be established wherehi the instruction of the 
Hebrew should be one of the principal objects of edu&#8211; 
cation. If this were done&#44; if the acknowledged de&#8211; 
fect were to be encountered by a united effort&#44; it is 
impossible but that the blessing of God would attend 
the undertaking &#59; and even in this western world&#44; 
almost at the opposite extreme whence civilization 
commenced her course&#44; even here I say&#44; men honour&#8211; 
ing their brethren by their splendid acquirements in 
the learning of our ancients&#44; and in a correct knowl&#8211; 
edge of biblical criticism&#44; would crown the eifort so 
piously undertaken and so happily accomplished. &#8212; 
But I speak of anticipations&#44; of things I fear hardly 
to be realized &#33; &#8212; too much of self&#8211;aggrandizement is 
the order of the day&#59; &#8212; disinterested exertions for 
public good are occurrences but rarely witnessed &#59; &#8212; 
and an enterprise which instead of bringing gain 
might occasion pecuniary loss&#44; is not of the nature 
to claim the attention of capitalists&#44; of men who&#44; hav&#8211; 
ing already as much or more than they can consume 
in all human probability&#44; must still go on increasing 
their stock of uncounted wealth&#44; till all at once deat.li 
arrests their extended grasp ere the perhaps intended 
good was even commenced. Some may think that 
I am too unjust towards those whom the world calls 
rich&#44; it may appear to savour of disappointment to 
charge upon a class the transgressions of a few. But 
in reply to this I have merely to remark&#44; that the 
fact of nothing or next to nothing having been done 
in so many places&#44; and among others in this very 
town&#44; warrants me in saying that persons having the 
power to lend a helping hand cannot be very sincere

in their professions towards furthering an education&#44; 
the necessity of which has been amply shown&#44; while 
they rest satisfied with merely giving vent to expres&#8211; 
sions of good wishes&#44; and leave actions to others than 
themselves.&#42; Our people suffer much in the estima&#8211; 
tion of the gentile world by such inexcusable negli&#8211; 
gence &#59; and those&#44; who value such a position and fame 
among the non&#8211;Israelites so highly&#44; maj&#39; rest assured 
that their indifference towards their own brethren 
and their own religious interests does by no means 
raise their standing&#59; on the contrary&#44; if we exert our&#8211; 
selves for our religion a little more energetically than 
we do&#44; we may certainly succeed in obtaining the 
admiration of the gentiles&#44; although their love may 
be denied to us&#44; which I must sincerely declare is 
hardly attainable by an opposite course even. Yet 
let ns hope&#44; at least let hope not die away altogether&#44; 
that the ancient spirit of devotion may one day be re&#8211; 
kindled&#44; and that the lukewarmness for the holy cause 
may be succeeded by an earnestness and zeal charac&#8211; 
teristic of a renovated love for righteous exertions. 
If this should happen&#44; willingly would I be charged&#39; 
with having falsely accused and unjustly judged per&#8211; 
sons whose real value&#44; and the depth of whose piety 
I had und&#39;ferrated. Yet&#44; till this is made manifest&#44; 
let the humble individual who now addresses you not 
be blamed for giving utterance to what he honestly 
believes to be the truth&#44; especially as the words em&#8211; 
ployed cannot wound the feeling&#44; pride&#44; or self&#8211;love&#44; 

&#42; Since this was spoken&#44; schools of the kind mentioned have been 
established in Philadelphia and elsewhere &#59; but yet much remains 
to be done. May&#44; &#39;27.

or whatever else you may term it&#44; of any one. &#8212; The 
consideration of the foregoing has ahuost insensibly 
drawn me from my purpose &#59; I certainly had but in&#8211; 
tended merely to touch the importance of the He&#8211; 
brew language&#59; but if I should have succeeded in 
arresting your attention upon this interesting sub&#8211; 
ject&#44; I shall consider it as having done a service in 
the promotion of religious education. 

Let us now revert to the general necessity there is 
for persons to become familiar with religious duties&#44; 
and of the obligation they are under to impart the 
knowledge so obtained to the rising generation. 
Some one may now object&#58; &#34;That religion is so 
plainly taught in the Bible&#44; that it requires no other 
study or investigation than reading the Scriptures.&#34; 
No one will deny that the sacred writings contain 
alone the whole system of revelation&#44; and that their 
study and perusal must greatly improve the under&#8211; 
standing. Nevertheless it is not to be lost sight of&#44; 
that a great share of knowledge and of pious feelings 
are a pre&#8211;requisite towards entering upon this im&#8211; 
portant study. &#8212; Take for example&#44; that one should 
not be able to read&#44; what use should he make of the 
book placed in his hand&#61; &#8212; Suppose again one were 
blind&#44; how is he to read&#61; &#8212; Again&#44; let us take a worldly 
man&#44; constantly engaged in business&#44; what time will 
he find to read&#61; These are obvious cases&#59; but there 
are an immense number of others equally powerful 
though less apparent in preventing persons from read&#8211; 
ing the Bible with profit. A person reading may not 
understand the phraseology employed&#59; he may be 
ignorant of every collateral information which could 
enable him to comprehend the subject he peruses.

Another again may have seen wickedness daily prac&#8211; 
tised&#59; another in his youth may have heard the Bible&#8211; 
tenets abused and ridiculed&#44; perhaps by his very pa&#8211; 
rents &#58; in all such cases&#44; I would ask. What effect can 
mere reading have&#44; without admitting a direct mira&#8211; 
cle almost&#44; but to leave the reader either ignorant as 
he was before&#44; or wicked as he was when he began&#61; 
It is not necessary to argue a thing so very plain any 
farther&#44; especially when we daily see&#44; that without 
previous instruction very little is learned by intelligent 
and great minds even. There are so many avocations 
in the world&#44; so much there is always to distract our 
attention&#44; that we hardly can fix our minds to any 
particular pursuit or to any one especial study. If 
we are therefore to profit by any thing&#44; or to become 
eminent in any calling&#44; we must begin to learn early&#44; 
and to apply at a later period the knowledge obtained 
by such slow degrees and at the expense of so much 
2&#58;&#41;ains and labour. &#8212; Ask the musician when he began 
his brilliant career&#61; generally the answer will be&#58; 
&#34;When I was a child.&#34; &#8212; The accomplished dancer&#58; 
&#34;I began at seven years old.&#34; To go to higher ac&#8211; 
complishments&#58; a painter evinced talents as a boy 
which had to be cultivated by a life of application&#59; 
the advocate commences his studies when he begins 
to speak&#44; and at his death at an advanced age he has 
yet much to learn &#59; the physician on the day of his 
departure&#44; perhaps discovers his whole theory of medi&#8211; 
cine to have been fallacious&#59; in short&#44; every pursuit&#44; 
from the smallest to the highest&#44; requires its appren&#8211; 
ticeship&#44; without which nothing can be gained &#59; and 
yet to hear persons speak we should suppose that re&#8211; 
ligious knowledge&#44; the perception of our duties and

appointment on earth&#44; the study of the word of God 
were matters&#44; which can be picked up&#44; so to say&#44; by 
the child as he goes along in the world&#44; or that per&#8211; 
haps such high knowledge is intuitive&#44; and therefore 
to be obtained without any labour whatever. But 
who will maintain in sober earnestness that we do 
learn our duties from our own invention &#61; or rather&#44; 
is it not reduced to an uncontrovertible certainty that 
all knowledge&#44; even that of morals and religion&#44; so 
called by way of distinction&#44; must be acquired by slow 
degrees&#61; How then is the child to become religious&#61; 
how is he to read the Bible understandingly&#44; if in&#8211; 
struction upon the most essential subject of life is to 
be withheld from him&#61; &#8212; Some however may say&#58; 
&#34;That they will admit&#44; that male children should be 
carefully instructed&#44; that it is perfectly reasonable 
that those who are to become&#44; as it is called&#44; &#39;the 
lords of creation &#39; should be qualified for their stations 
by practical training&#44; that their morals should be care&#8211; 
fully attended to and their mental culture strictly 
watched over. But females&#44; they aver&#44; need not that 
knowledge &#59; theirs being a more dependent lot&#44; it is 
immaterial whether they are high&#8211;learned in sacred 
literature or versed in the holy tongue &#59; in short for 
them superficial reading is enough&#44; for them it will be 
sufficient if the lighter branches of elegant learning 
are cultivated by them.&#34; As usual&#44; this reasoning 
contains with some sprinkling of soundness a great 
share of fallacy&#44; which Avill be apparent upon a slight 
review of the question. It is not to be denied&#44; that 
it is almost entirely useless for the female to become 
learned in the strictest sense of the word&#59; it would 
indeed unsex her&#44; if she were to study the legal pro&#8211;

fession &#59; if she were to step abroad as a physician &#59; if 
she&#44; forgetful of feminine decorum&#44; would lay on the 
harness of war&#44; and wage a mortal combat with the 
enemy. Well has it been commanded&#58; &#34;There shall 
not be man&#39;s apparel upon a woman&#59;&#34; for the female&#39;s 
sphere is not the highway&#44; not the public streets&#44; not 
the embattled field&#44; not the public halls. But her 
home should be the place of her actions&#44; there her 
influence should be felt&#44; to soothe&#44; to calm&#44; to sanctify&#44; 
to render happy the rugged career of a father&#44; a bro&#8211; 
ther&#44; a husband&#44; or a child. Yet&#44; how is she to be&#8211; 
come qualified for this holy&#44; for this noble task&#44; if 
you leave her mind a blank a barren waste &#8212; open 
to the evil seed which the world&#39;s corruption is but 
too apt to scatter&#61; Behold this woman&#44; watch her 
well&#44; and then decide upon her claims to your regard 
and aiFections. She is proud&#44; vain&#44; frivolous&#44; igno&#8211; 
rant&#44; vicious&#44; and you despise her&#44; she is no doubt 
undeserving of your regard&#59; but the fault is hardly 
hers&#44; it is her parents and teachers that are to blame. 
God has given her beauty&#44; a mind alive to the charms 
of nature&#59; a soul delighting in the romantic and the 
afifectionate &#59; wealth also has not been denied her&#44; 
since her &#44;Cather has all which a covetous world might 
desire. Now mark how this girl is educated. Be&#8211; 
fore she can lisp she hears her charms praised&#59; her 
will is almost law to the dependents of the family&#59; 
the rod of correction she never is made to feel&#44; no 
matter what her faults may be &#59; the word of reproof 
even is but sparingly administered&#59; her schooling&#44; 
next&#44; is not of the highly morally elevated&#44; but again 
the frivolous&#44; the showy &#8212; grant it be elegant&#59; but 
her soul is all the time uncultivated&#44; because that is

never regarded as of the least importance to her&#59; her 
beauty is to win admiration &#59; her accomplishments are 
to captivate&#44; and her wit is to dazzle. And lo&#33; the 
bashful girl grows into the lovely woman &#59; flatterers 
crowd round her in greater number&#59; menials in larger 
swarms now await her commands&#59; she has perhaps 
rivals to encounter upon the path of conquest which 
she has chalked out for herself&#44; or which fond&#44; fool&#8211; 
ish parents have bidden her to tread&#59; and what can 
you expect should be the result&#44; but that she should 
be proud &#8212; vain &#8212; frivolous &#8212; ignorant &#8212; vicious &#8212; re&#8211; 
vengeful&#44; and perhaps at last morally depraved&#61; &#8212; 
This indeed is but a fancy picture of a spoiled beau&#8211; 
tiful heiress&#59; but does it not apply almost to every 
female in a greater or less degree&#44; who has the ad&#8211; 
vantage&#44; or rather the curse of an elegant education 
and a fashionable parentage &#61; At the same time the 
daughters of the commonly so&#8211;called lower classes are 
in many respects but little better circumstanced&#59; since 
moral culture is with them also much neglected at 
the expense of worldly and vain acquirements. &#8212; I do 
not wish to say&#44; that my observations hold universally 
true&#44; but their general correctness cannot be gain&#8211; 
sayed. All this must tend to prove that between the 
two extremes&#44; between unfeminine learning and use&#8211; 
less acquirements&#44; the true course should be sought 
for. Our daughters then should learn early&#44; even 
whilst yet infants&#44; that they&#44; as well as the other sex&#44; 
are creatures and dependents of God&#59; they too should 
be early told of the greatness&#44; the mercy and the un&#8211; 
ending goodness of the Almighty&#59; they should be 
taught to direct their hopes in affliction&#44; and their 
confidence in prosperity to the Giver of all good&#59;

they should be informed&#44; that beauty is perishable&#44; 
wealth is fleeting&#44; joy evanescent&#44; and wisdom falla&#8211; 
cious&#59; they should be impressed with the conviction 
that flattery is a pernicious gift&#44; dangerous to the re&#8211; 
ceiver&#59; that the world will crouch and cringe to the 
prosperous&#44; and turn away with disgust and loathing 
the conflding one whom they themselves have cor&#8211; 
rupted &#59; above all the father should betimes com&#8211; 
mence to teach his daughter the way she should go&#59; 
he should&#44; so to say&#44; be her guide on the road to 
eternal life&#59; he should bid her look into the sacred 
page to gather wisdom and hope from the undying 
words of Holy Writ&#58; and he should admonish her to 
cull the antidote to afiliction from those records where 
it is tauffht to us that the virtuous are never forsaken&#58; 
especially however he should inform her&#44; how becom&#8211; 
ing is meekness&#44; and how lovely is modesty in the 
beautiful woman&#44; how much more commanding her 
loveliness must be&#44; if she bears it as a gift of Heaven&#44; 
not as some gaudy jewel of which the wearer may be 
proud. &#8212; Think you that an education based upon 
such principles can be otherwise than beneficial &#61; 
Even if the time consumed in this training should 
preclude the acquisition of accomplishment&#58; still far 
better will it be that our daughters grow up religious 
women and excellent housewives&#44; than that they be 
elegant musicians&#44; skilful painters&#44; graceful dancers 
or pretenders to sciences&#44; which to the great majority 
of females must be quite useless. &#8212; If time is left&#44; if 
the parent&#39;s means will permit it&#44; then some of the 
more showy branches might with advantage be added&#59; 
but care should always be taken&#44; that they be viewed 
as secondary&#44; and that religious instruction and use&#8211;

fill solid information should be the first&#44; the most im&#8211; 
portant pursuit. &#8212; Whilst on the subject I cannot dis&#8211; 
miss it without adding a few words as to the books 
whichare generally considered fit for female reading&#59; 
I allude to the whole class of fictitious writings&#44; by 
which I mean romances&#44; novels&#44; and dramas. That 
some are good&#44; others harmless&#44; is not to be denied&#59; 
but the majority of them contain false views of mor&#8211; 
ality&#59; a perverted philosophy&#44; and a mawkish sensi&#8211; 
bility are generally their chief pervading characteris&#8211; 
tics&#59; and&#44; when&#44; as it is often the case&#44; the young mind 
has not been stored with sound religious knowledge&#44; 
this kind of literature destroys almost entirely all 
sound principles&#44; and it may well&#8211;nigh reduce one to 
the awful state on which the prophet pronounced the 
curse&#58; &#34;Wo to those wdio say to the good evil&#44; and 
to the evil good.&#34; It were therefore far better&#44; if 
the wdiole of such works were banished or set out of 
the reach of the young&#59; but if this cannot be done&#44; 
at least do teach the females&#44; at least prepare them 
with that kind of information&#44; which may act as the 
antidote to the poison they so plentifully imbibe. &#8212; 
In this manner then let us proceed in the education 
of our children&#58; let religion form the basis both for 
males and females&#44; on which the superstructure of 
useful and ornamental knowledge can afterwards be 
profitably built&#59; for without the former&#44; as has been 
shown&#44; the latter can never produce good and whole&#8211; 
some fruits. 

In reply to the other assertion&#44; &#34; That Israelites 
need not give an especial religious instruction to their 
children&#44; since morality is taught in the churches of 
other sects&#44; and political rectitude can be acquired in

the schools&#44;&#34; we have simplj to answer &#58; That much 
good as may be taught in these places&#44; &#40;we would not 
be illiberal enough to deny this&#44;&#41; still much is left 
untaught which to us at least is highly important. 
The gentile preacher will admonish you to be obedient 
to God&#39;s will and to be pious&#44; meek&#44; and patient. 
But what are the duties he includes in obedience &#61; 
They are few indeed compared to our wants &#59; he will 
not tell you to observe holy the seventh day &#8212; he will 
not tell you to remember the going out of Egypt &#8212; 
not speak of the glorious announcement of the law 
on this holy festival &#8212; not he will inform you how to 
be holy&#44; as Israel should be holy&#44; to the Lord &#8212; not 
he can teach you to abstain from unlawful food &#8212; not 
he may direct your hopes to a future happy restora&#8211; 
tion &#8212; not he may instruct you&#44; to sum up all in one 
single idea &#8212; not he can instruct you to look up to 
yon heaven and to behold there the workings of one&#44; 
holy everlasting&#44; unchangeable Being&#59; for to him 
the Deity is divided&#44; to him the Creator is changeable. 
Even let him feel the beauty and the force of the idea 
of ONE God&#44; does he not then inculcate that the holy 
law is abolished&#44; thart the law of Moses&#44; the promul&#8211; 
gation of which we celebrate this day &#8212; that this law 
has bee&#59;a annulled &#61; to make place for what &#61; for an 
offspring&#44; a changeling rather&#44; whose beauty by no 
means equals the parent&#39;s lustre&#33; &#8212; But his eloquence 
attracts you&#44; the powers of his capacious well&#8211;regula&#8211; 
ted mind make you willing listeners &#59; you go&#44; because 
his&#44; as you say&#44; is the purer morality&#44; divested of doc&#8211; 
trinal jargon&#44; free from religious prejudice&#44; open aUke 
to all mankind. &#8212; But go ye as believers in revelation&#44; 
or as listeners of an exhibition of splendid eloquence &#61; 

<pb n="178"/>

178 RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. 

If the latter&#44; it is well indeed&#59; admire then for ever 
the eloquent fervour&#44; listen to well&#8211;turned phrases&#44; 
shout approbation to morality without religious re&#8211; 
straint&#44; without doctrines of faith&#44; if such a thing be 
not an utter fallacy. Yet&#44; if you are believers&#44; if you 
are Israelites&#44; not in words but in your inmost hearts&#44; 
then you cannot be much benefitted by such advice &#59; 
true&#44; it may raise your admiration of God&#39;s power &#59; 
the orator may tell you in the words of the holy Book&#44; 
to adore and to love the Lord&#44; and excite in your 
mind relio&#58;ious adoration. Still where are the in&#8211; 
structions which are to be based upon such fervour &#61; 
Do the preacher&#39;s words teach you aught thereof&#61; or 
rather does he not raise a craving within you which 
he fails&#44; utterly fails&#44; to satisfy &#61; To the house of 
our God then bend your steps&#44; perchance there is one 
who is empowered to scatter the seeds of life&#44; un&#8211; 
known to fame he may indeed be&#44; not burning elo&#8211; 
quence may flow from his lips&#44; not the goods of the 
world may be his portion&#44; perhaps not even beloved 
may he be&#44; because he is too uncompromising&#44; too 
unyielding to the follies of the age &#58; nevertheless he 
teaches what our ancients taught&#44; he promulgates the 
holy Word which was announced in times of yore 
from the blessed Sinai &#59; and will you turn to him a 
deaf ear&#44; which was willingly lent to eloquence &#61; will 
you not bear with him&#44; whilst he points out the way 
you should travel to insure your salvation &#61; I hope 
your hearts&#44; my brethren &#33; may be with him who is 
one of you&#44; one from the same line&#44; from the seed of 
the house of Jacob &#59; and that&#44; feeling the necessity 
of religious instruction&#44; it will be your endeavour to 
have always such a teacher&#44; who will fearlessly speak

to yon of the deeds you have to do and the way you 
have to walk&#44; instead of resorting to places where 
with the wholesome water inefficient&#44; or noxious 
drugs even&#44; may perchance be mixed. 

In reference at last to the assertion &#58; &#34; That politi&#8211; 
cal knowledge can be obtained at schools where 
worldly sciences are taught&#44;&#39;&#39; it would be needless&#44; 
after what has been said already&#44; to do more than 
merely call your attention to the absurdity of the po&#8211; 
sition&#44; that political knowledge should effect the least 
good in reforming individual wickedness&#44; since the 
whole system is based&#44; from its very nature&#44; upon ex&#8211; 
pediency and utility. 

E&#39;othing is left&#44; therefore&#44; to us as Israelites&#44; but to 
apply ourselves&#44; as in olden days&#44; to the study of the 
law &#59; to engage in this pursuit with all the light which 
modern discoveries in science so abundantly furnish&#44; 
and to do according to the knowledge we may ac&#8211; 
quire. &#8212; If it is thus our duty to learn&#44; it is no less 
necessary to teach others what is so beneficial to our&#8211; 
selves &#59; and if a parent should unfortunately not be 
well instructed himself&#44; he is bound to seek a teacher 
who shall supply the place which he should have oc&#8211; 
cupied. That this is ordained in the law&#44; as much as 
any other &#39;religious duty&#44; appears from the last com&#8211; 
mandment which Moses gave before his death &#58;

&#34;And he said to them&#44; Turn your heart to all the words which 
I testify towards you this day&#44; that you may command them your 
children&#44; to observe to do all the words of this law. For it is not 
an empty thing for you&#44; but it is your life&#44; and through this very 
thing you will have length of days upon the land&#44; which to inherit 
you are to pass over the Jordan.&#34; Deut. xxxii. 46&#8211;47. 

Here we have clearly pointed out to us the obliga&#8211; 
tion under which every Israelite lies to acquire a suf&#8211; 
ficient knowledge&#44; be it much or be it Httle&#44; of the 
laws of our God. Farther&#44; it is also made a duty to 
teach the same to our children&#44; that they also may 
learn to observe to do accordingly&#44; &#8212; for the reason 
given&#44; that it is not a matter of indifference&#44; one to 
which we might attend or not&#44; as our fancy or incli&#8211; 
nation might dictate &#59; but to which we should resort&#44; 
as the patient snatches with eagerness after the medi&#8211; 
cinal draught which&#44; he believes&#44; has the power to 
stay the outstretched arm of death. Ay&#44; and does 
the sufferer eagerly follow the advice of the falhble 
earthly physician&#44; whose well&#8211;intended medicaments 
may after all slay in place of reviving&#58; how much 
more should we. hasten to receive with eagerness the 
fruit of life&#44; the certain remedy for our fainting soul&#44; 
which the infallible Physician so graciously offers 
and so beneficently bestows &#33; &#8212; This is the herb of life&#44; 
this is the healing balsam which must restore life into 
decay&#44; which must&#44; to use simple language&#44; bring 
back peace into the mind where even sin and excesses 
may for a time have caused peace and contentment 
to fiy. &#8212; Let it then be our study to learn our du&#8211; 
ties&#44; and let us also bestow upon our children what 
we have found to be so beneficial in prosperity&#44; and 
so healing amidst tribulations. Then&#44; indeed&#44; may

parents rejoice in the number of their offspring&#44; when 
they behold them all the children of righteousness&#44; 
true and faithful servants of the Most High. Then&#44; 
indeed&#44; may the female rejoice in her beauty and 
loveliness&#44; when she is armed against the snares and 
temptations of life. Then can we haii our mothers 
as our benefactresses&#44; our fathers as spiritual progeni&#8211; 
tors&#44; our sisters as our best friends&#44; our wives as faith&#8211; 
ful companions&#44; and our daughters as springs of hope 
for the future. &#8212; The brother too may not then mis&#8211; 
trust the brother&#44; nor will the son rebel against the 
father&#44; and the husband will be the protector of his 
wife&#44; and the guardian of her innocence and honour. 
Is this the legitimate effect of a religious education&#61; 
It is &#33; May it then be the will of Heaven to make it 
prosper among us&#44; that all may be true to our Maker&#44; 
and faithful to our God &#33;

will&#44; and mayest Thou ever spare us according to thy

Brethren&#33; 

Not only in this age in which our lot is cast&#44; but also 
in days gone by&#44; men have ever been prone to follow 
the path of evil&#44; and have foolishly forsaken the law 
of righteousness to gratify their sinful inclinations. 
And although it must be acknowledged that at some 
periods wickedness does more extensively prevail than 
at others&#58; still it may be maintained&#44; that mankind 
are ever the same with but trifling differences. We 
therefore occasionally witness an entire generation 
almost leading a life displeasing to Heaven &#59; and then 
again&#44; when punishment is sent&#44; they turn and seek 
the Lord&#44; and forsake the evil of their ways. The 
philanthropist and the adorer of his God need there&#8211; 
fore never despair of a regeneration of their fellow 
beings&#59; for even though all appear to be sinning&#44; 
there always will be those who will never swerve 
from the service of the Creator&#44; and through whom 
the others will again be led to a knowledge of the 
way of truth. But also universal virtue has at no 
time prevailed&#59; and after centuries of adherence to 
religion&#44; the iharch of wickedness has often marred 
the beautiful structure of holiness&#44; and spread desola&#8211; 
tion over the fields&#44; towns and temples upheld only 
by virtue&#44; piety and devotion. All this has been 
abundantly verified by the history of our people. 
There had been times&#44; during the continuance of the 
Hebrew commonwealth&#44; when virtue was loved&#44; when 
the law of God was honoured&#44; and when the throng 
of worshippers crowded the temple at Jerusalem.

But through the folly of rulers and people a change 
had come by degrees over the fair scene&#59; and in 
place of virtue&#44; murder and incest were committed &#59; 
in place of the law of God&#44; heathen rites were hon&#8211; 
oured&#59; and instead of crowds at Jerusalem&#44; the tem&#8211; 
ples of the numberless idols of Judah received the 
thoughtless multitude. Thus was the people circum&#8211; 
stanced&#44; which had once been chosen as a peculiar 
treasure of righteousness and sanctity&#44; and thus far 
had the Israelites sunk down from their high estate. 
But still they vainly imagined themselves free from 
guilt&#44; and they did not in their obduracy look upon 
their mischievous conduct as blamable. At such 
doings the indignation of God was kindled&#44; and He 
resolved to let the punishment denounced take its 
natural course&#44; that it might be accomplished what 
had been foretold&#44; that the Israelites should be cast 
out from their delightful land&#44; if they at any time 
were to disobey those precepts&#44; through the observ&#8211; 
ance of which alone they could lay claim to the lovely 
inheritance. Now&#44; though the conditions had been 
clearly proposed&#44; and there could be no possible doubt 
as to their meaning and bearing&#58; still the merciful 
One delayed his just indignation&#44; and sent his ser&#8211; 
vants the prophets to warn the apostate race of the 
danger they were voluntarily incurring by the course 
they were pursuing. Our people had in former times 
seen and felt how great was the difference between 
following the will of God and disobedience to his 
precepts. Moreover they had before them the holy 
law which denounced awful visitation as a natural 
consequence of quitting the path of right. Still&#44; as

the good land wliicli the Lord giveth to you&#34; had re&#8211; 
mained hitherto unfulfilled&#44; although they had defiled 
their lovely country by their abominations and their 
idolatry &#58; our ancestors possibly imagined&#44; that the 
other punishments&#44; short of this&#44; were events&#44; in the 
ordinary course of nature&#44; to which all nations&#44; whether 
Israelites or not&#44; are alike subject. But they heeded 
not&#44; that in all occurrences of life it is the superin&#8211; 
tending Providence that rules&#44; and that nothing&#44; even 
if it be only a daily adventure&#44; is sent without a high 
object from the Source of all. They thus continued 
to sin&#44; till even the house of God witnessed in its sa&#8211; 
cred precincts the murder of the priest and the prophet 
&#8212; as though the evil day would never reach them. O 
blind delusion &#33; shortsighted sinfulness &#33; does the 
Almighty not see&#44; because his arrows do not fly in&#8211; 
stantaneously &#61; does the Judge of all slumber&#44; because 
sudden destruction overtakes not the transgressor&#61; 
and cannot the Omnipotent repay iniquity to its per&#8211; 
petrator&#44; solely because He mercifully delays the pun&#8211; 
ishment&#61; &#8212; Most truly&#44; 0&#44; our God&#33; have we experi&#8211; 
enced that&#44; although Thou art slow of anger&#44; thy 
punishment strikes home&#44; and thy arrows sink deep 
into the sinful heart&#44; and that thy vengeance is only 
retarded&#44; not >vithheld. Yet&#44; though so great were 
our misdeeds&#44; our heavenly Father let the merited 
retribution take place by degrees &#58; first&#44; a part of the 
kingdom of Israel was overrun by one Assyrian king&#44; 
and then the remainder was led away by his suc&#8211; 
cessor. In this manner was fulfilled in part the de&#8211; 
nunciations of Moses&#44; which had been confirmed by 
a constant succession of inspired men&#44; one of whom 
predicted &#40;1 Kings xiv. 15&#41;&#58; &#34;And the Lord will

smite Israel&#44; like the reed bendeth in the water&#44; and 
He will expel Israel from off this good land&#44; which 
He hath given to their fathers&#44; and scatter them on 
the other side of the river&#44; because they have made 
their idol&#8211;groves&#44; incensing the Lord.&#34; Although 
the curse had been thus partially fulfilled&#44; the men 
of Judah&#44; it is possible&#44; did not altogether grieve for 
the downfall of the rival kingdom&#44; with which they 
had waged many bitter and bloody wars. Perhaps 
also they fancied themselves secure&#44; because they had 
within their boundaries the sacred temple which God 
had chosen as the residence of his holy name. Per&#8211; 
haps too they did not conceive their transgressions to 
be quite so heinous as those of the Israelites&#44; because 
they had occasionally repented&#44; which the latter had 
never done. Thus they lulled themselves into a fatal 
security&#44; and the amount of their iniquities was fear&#8211; 
fully swelled&#44; till they too were ripening fast for de&#8211; 
struction. &#8212; Again the spirit was poured forth&#44; and 
men arose who yet shake the world by their fervour 
and eloquence. They went out with the word of life 
on their lips&#44; and whilst announcing the impending 
evil&#44; they entreated their brothers to avert it by a 
speedy return to righteousness. &#8212; But they addressed 
deaf ears&#44; their words fell like seed upon an unfruit&#8211; 
ful soil&#44; upon unwilling hearts &#59; and therefore there 
occurred what had been so long foretold&#44; and down 
fell the glory of our nation&#44; the crown of our head 
was hurled to the ground&#44; and the bright gems were 
dimmed&#44; and the pure gold was tarnished&#59; &#8212; our tem&#8211; 
ple was burned&#44; our holy city rendered the abode of 
the wild beasts of the desert&#44; and our nation scattered 
to the four corners of heaven&#44; so that years rolled over

our devastated land&#44; during which not the foot of 
man nor of cattle trod its desolate soil. 

Long is the time since this calamity befel us&#44; cen&#8211; 
turies have sped along in their unceasing course&#44; and 
nations have sprung up and nations have passed 
away &#59; and nevertheless we are yet left to mourn for 
the bereavement we then suffered&#44; for never have we 
again risen to our pristine greatness&#59; and though un&#8211; 
destroyed&#44; because indestructible&#44; our glory and our 
power have at no time since attained any considerable 
eminence. Still we are the same that we have been 
in olden times&#44; the descendants of the same illustrious 
race&#44; and the inheritance of the most favoured and 
most pious and most devoted of men is yet in our 
possession &#59; for the books of the holy inspirations&#44; 
which tell us of the outpourings of the spirit which 
God graciously revealed to Adam&#39;s sinful progeny&#44; 
have not perished amidst the troubles and afflictions 
which befel us. As has been said already&#44; the Israel&#8211; 
ites fancied that they were secured from the evils 
which had been predicted&#44; and consequently the ban&#8211; 
ishment which had overtaken one portion of the peo&#8211; 
ple was not regarded as a warning by the other&#44; and 
they therefore sinned&#44; as though the dreaded future 
would never arrive. But all the while their evilday 
was drawing nigh&#44; and the enemies of our race were 
already buckling on their armour for the deadly 
conflict against the far&#8211;famed Jerusalem. And this 
period so pregnant with wo was chosen by Grod to 
send another of those devoted messengers&#44; who&#44; 
among the prophets that had been deputed&#44; was one 
of the greatest&#44; and one that was indeed the man of 
sorrow&#59; who&#44; during his mission&#44; and after the event

bad so dreadfully verified the truth of the words he 
had spoken&#44; suffered many and various mishaps&#44; in the 
persecutions he encountered&#44;&#39; and the evils he wit&#8211; 
nessed as befalling his beloved nation&#44; the holy city&#44; 
and the sacred temple. This man was Jeremiah&#44; and 
be was told to go and to warn the people of the im&#8211; 
pending storm&#44; that by repentance they might haply 
escape its outbreak. In the opening of the book of 
his prophecies we are presented with a succinct ac&#8211; 
count of his appointment to the sacred calling of 
j&#41;rophet&#44; to which dignity he was raised whilst yet 
very young. He at first hesitated to accept the holy 
trust&#44; but he was told&#44; &#39;&#39;Not to say&#44; I am young&#59; 
for to Avhithersoever I send thee thou shalt go&#44; and 
whichsoever I command thee thou shalt speak&#59; be 
not afraid of them &#59; for I am with thee to save thee&#44; 
saith the Lord.&#34; From this we are to learn&#44; that it 
matters not what age the teacher may be&#44; but how&#8211; 
ever young or otherwise unimportant&#44; the word of 
salvation must be received with becoming deference 
from his mouth &#59; for it is not the man nor his glori&#8211; 
fication which is the object in view&#44; but the end is 
the spread of righteousness&#44; and the effect is the 
sanctification of the Creator of the universe&#44; and 
this can be attained by the instrumentality of any 
one whom He&#44; who is enthroned above&#44; may select 
in his wisdom. &#8212; Jeremiah no longer refused to go 
forth&#44; and&#44; accepting the trust together with its dan&#8211; 
gers &#40;for then&#44; as now&#44; the admonisher of the people 
on account of their wrongs and backsli dings was not 
beloved&#41; he received his mission by&#44; to adopt the 
figurative language of Scripture&#44; a touch from the 
Supreme Hand on his lips&#44; or in other words&#44; by the

iDfiision in him of an accession of wisdom&#44; of knowl&#8211; 
edge&#44; and of a higher moral courage &#59; and the Lord 
said to him &#34; Behold&#44; I have given my words in thy 
mouth.&#34; Next in order follow several visions which 
Jeremiah saw&#44; which as prophet he had to tell as a 
part of his mission to the people&#44; and were intended 
to impress on their minds the intention of God to 
cause the threatened evil to come soon over them. 
They had thought themselves safe &#59; hut now it was 
announced that the evil was hastenina&#59; to overwhelm 
them. God also showed to Jeremiah the northern 
hordes&#44; who would sweep over the plains and moun&#8211; 
tains&#44; and bring destruction even to the gates of Jeru&#8211; 
salem itself &#8212; Jerusalem which then was thought too 
strong and too impregnable to fear the approach even 
of the foeman. &#8212; Having announced to the people 
what punishment was in store for them&#44; he tells 
them&#44; how much satisfaction God had received froni 
their former love&#44; when they went after Him confid&#8211; 
ingly&#44; like the youthful bride follows the chosen of 
her heart&#44; into the desert&#44; to receive there the con&#8211; 
firmation of the holy espousals &#8212; the law which was 
proclaimed from Sinai. &#8212; But now&#44; continues the 
prophet&#44; speaking in the name and the person of the 
Deity &#58; &#34; HeaY ye the word of the Lord&#44; house of 
Jacob&#44; and all ye families of the house of Israel. 
Thus saith the Lord&#44; What evil have your ancestors 
found in me&#44; that they have distanced themselves 
from me&#44; and that they went after vanities and be&#8211; 
came vain &#61;&#34; Here we have the folly and wicked&#8211; 
ness of the transgressors among our people placed 
in a vstrong light before us. First&#44; we are told how 
much was regarded the filial devotion&#44; and how ever&#8211;

lastingly would be remembered the submission to 
God&#39;s guidance. But now look upon the contrast&#58; 
the very nation that had obtained Heaven&#39;s favour 
in so singular a manner&#44; is the very one that for&#8211; 
sakes Him without any cause&#59; the very one that 
seeks vanity&#44; where the opposite reality is so great&#44; 
so palpable&#44; so powerful&#44; so wise&#44; so good &#33; Could 
they allege&#44; that God was not so great as formerly&#61; 
or does perhaps the sinner of our own day imagine&#44; 
that the power of the Lord is lessened &#61; when they 
must have known&#44; and when we daily experience&#44; 
that He is ever the same&#44; and that his is the everlast&#8211; 
ing majesty &#33; Could they aver&#44; that the Lord spoke 
no more from Sinai &#61; or will the transgressors of our 
time say&#44; that the divine legislation has not been re&#8211; 
newed before their own eyes &#61; can this be an excuse 
for trespassing and sin &#61; &#8212; But are not the effects of 
divine omnipotence daily manifested around us &#61; are 
the light and heat of the sun ever in aught dimin&#8211; 
ished&#61; do the stars now shine with less than their 
wonted splendour &#61; is the blue of heaven less intense 
and less beautiful&#61; does not the nourishing earth 
still yield her manifold productions &#61; do not the sea&#8211; 
sons&#8211;roll on thus far in unending&#44; unchanging&#44; and 
unvarying succession &#61; &#8212; And say&#33; are not the won&#8211; 
ders of revelation the same they were on the first 
day of their announcement &#61; can&#44; therefore&#44; any one 
seriously say&#44; that God is less manifest now than 
formerly&#61; &#8212; And say you his power is lessened&#61; 
when it is nowise diminished by age and care&#44; when 
in Him succeeding centuries have not discovered 
aught of decay&#44; of uncertainty of purpose&#44; of a lack 
of energy &#59; when all with Him is as from the begin&#8211;

ning&#44; when He is unending in power and unlimited 
in might &#33; &#8212; And He who is old of days and unchang&#8211; 
ing in purpose is no less wise than powerful&#59; and 
since his acting vigour is unimpaired&#44; the knowl&#8211; 
edge which is his&#44; the wisdom which is himself&#44; is 
also left unchanged. And doubt you it&#44; when you 
see that daily new wisdom is brought to light &#61; and 
say you&#44; it is the inventive faculty of man which 
produces these wonders &#61; But whence does wisdom 
come to man &#61; say&#44; who is it that causes his mind to 
swell with intelligence&#44; unless it be He&#44; who teaches 
man understanding&#61; &#8212; Sinners&#44; perhaps&#44; say&#44; God is 
no longer so kind as formerly He was wont to be&#59; 
He beheld the suffering of our ancestors in Egypt&#44; 
and He saved them &#59; but where now are his mercies 
of which our fathers have spoken &#61; But let us con&#8211; 
sider a moment and reflect what blessings we&#44; though 
unworthy&#44; daily receive&#44; and we will cease to com&#8211; 
plain &#59; true&#44; we linger in captivity&#44; as also did a por&#8211; 
tion of Israel at the time of Jeremiah &#59; but then are 
not our sins and our ancestors&#39; sins the division be&#8211; 
tween our God and ourselves &#61; where is the repent&#8211; 
ance&#44; the return to righteousness&#44; which has been 
asked at our hands &#61; when did we ever go back again 
to the Lord ih sincerity and truth&#61; &#8212; Oh no. He is 
always the same&#44; ever great&#44; ever manifest&#44; ever 
powerful&#44; ever wise&#44; ever good&#59; but we do as the 
prophet says &#58; &#34; And when I brought you into the 
land of Carmel to eat of its fruits and good products&#44; 
you came and made unclean my land&#44; and my inheri&#8211; 
tance ye rendered an abomination. The priests said 
not. Where is the Lord &#59; those that laid hold of the

me &#59; and the prophets prophesied by Baal &#59; and after 
that which cannot help they went.&#34; Is this not true&#44; 
ay&#44; even to this very day&#44; of many of us&#44; I fear to say&#44; 
of most of us &#61; is there not&#44; therefore&#44; cause enough 
for the anger of God which was once poured out to 
continue its action on us&#44; or as the Bible says&#44; &#34; Tliere&#8211; 
fore&#44; yet will I strive with you&#44; saith the Lord&#44; and with 
the children of your children will I strive &#61;&#34; Yes&#44; we 
alone are the cause that Grod&#39;s favour is not bestowed 
on us&#44; we are indeed the obstinate&#44; obdurate genera&#8211; 
tion&#44; whose eyes are blinded to the effects of our mis&#8211; 
deeds &#59; we sin&#44; and then arraign the Supremo&#39;s good&#8211; 
ness for applying the merited chastisement. &#8212; And if 
this was true in Jeremiah&#39;s time&#44; it is not the less so 
at this very hour. How little regard is paid to the 
dictates of the law &#33; every one&#44; alas &#33; forms a code 
for himself&#44; he does&#44; as it were&#44; set up an idol of his 
own&#44; to which he pays his homage. One worships 
his money&#44; and to it he sacrifices the eternal repose 
of his neglected soul. To him no Sabbath bids the 
weekly rest to come &#59; to him no holy days of the 
Lord are days of rejoicing&#59; the period of atonement 
for sins is to him like all others&#44; a season for the pur&#8211; 
suit of vile lucre &#59; and often honesty and probity are 
made cloaks&#44; only assumed to hide his turpitude&#44; 
which the laws of the land would signally punish&#44; if 
his real acts were discovered. &#8212; Another is a sensual&#8211; 
ist&#44; and what are to him the precepts which incul&#8211; 
cate holiness and chastity&#61; even into the house of 
God he goes benumbed by the intoxicating drink 
which he loves &#59; even in midnight hours he seeks to 
gratify his lust&#44; and for the sake of pleasing his palate 
he will devour whatever the law of God has inter&#8211;

194 THE TRANSGRESSION OF ISRAEL. 


&#34;Be astounded at this&#44; ye heavens&#44; and shudder&#33; they are very 
much corrupted&#44; saith the Lord. For two evils my people have 
done&#44; &#8212; me they have forsaken&#44; the spring of living waters&#44; to hew 
themselves cisterns&#44; cisterns that are broken&#44; which cannot hold the 
water.&#34; Jeremiah ii. 12&#44; 13. 

This was spoken but a short time&#44; not fifty years&#44; 
before the destruction of the temple by N&#39;ebuchad&#8211; 
nezzar. The people indeed had become very corrupt&#59; 
gross idolatry was the disgrace of our people&#59; on every 
hill&#44; under every green tree idols were seen&#44; to which 
they senselessly offered adoration &#59; but though their 
folly was proved to them&#44; they still continued to defile 
themselves&#44; not heeding the voice which so feelingly 
called to them to consider the folly of their way&#44; in 
&#34; saying to the wood. Thou art my father&#44; and to the 
stone. Thou hast borne us.&#34; But&#44; alas &#33; the messen&#8211; 
gers of God remained unheeded&#44; their advice was 
listened to only to be contemned&#59; for at that time 
already there were not wanting those who looked 
upon the really wise&#44; the servants of God&#44; as fanatics 
and bigots. But at length the evil&#44; the advent of 
which was not believed&#44; came and swept away wall 
and temple&#44; city and people&#44; priests and judges&#59; and 
then was seen the slaughter of the mother upon her 
babes&#44; and of the father upon his children&#44; and to&#8211; 
gether lay slain the teacher with his scholars&#44; and 
the bride and the bridegroom &#59; and there arose the 
shouts of assailants and the groans of the vanquished&#44; 
and in the prostrate ruins of God&#39;s house were heard

the hated voice of the triumph of the adversary&#44; as 
he strode conquering and rejoicing over the desola&#8211; 
tion which his arms had been permitted to achieve. 
&#8212; Hah &#33; dreadful indeed was that day&#44; when the glory 
of Israel sunk&#44; when the sun of our prosperity set in 
a sea of blood. True&#44; the temple was once more re&#8211; 
built&#44; and again a remnant was permitted to reoccupy 
the sacred soil &#59; but a second time also&#44; the terrible 
scenes were reenacted with more heightened effect&#44; 
and the slaughter was tenfold increased under the 
command of the Roman Vespasian and his son Titus&#44; 
since when we have been wanderers&#44; and an easy and 
ready prey to any one who chose to persecute us. &#8212; 
All this was caused by our sins&#44; because we would 
not listen to the warning voice of instruction&#44; which 
would fain have arrested our steps on the road of ruin. 
Our ancestors&#44; however&#44; were obdurate&#44; and our pres&#8211; 
ent state is an evidence of their folly and wickedness. 
It is now the period in which the calamitous sub&#8211; 
version of our state twice occurred &#59; let it act as a 
wholesome check to our own obduracy&#44; and let us re&#8211; 
flect&#44; that we too are sinning&#44; and hewing out for our&#8211; 
selves cisterns which wdll not hold the living waters. 
Ay&#44; heap up wealth in masses&#44; avaricious one&#44; &#8212; still 
thou hast not laid up imperishable treasures&#59; thy cis&#8211; 
tern is a broken cistern&#44; and not a drop of the water 
of life will remain in it&#44; unless the breach is healed 
by a recourse to the holy law. Sensual one&#44; weenest 
thou that thy tasting of all pleasures will avail thee 
aught at the final day of judgment&#61; sinful man &#33; no&#44; 
thy birthright thou hast sold for a mess of pottage &#59; 
and when thy doom is sealed thou wilt thyself ac&#8211;

and that it held not the living waters &#33; &#8212; And thou too&#44; 
man of ambition&#44; of worldly vain&#8211;glory&#44; seest thou 
not that thy worship was the worship of a false delu&#8211; 
sive idol&#61; worldly honour thou didst crave&#44; and thou 
didst not hesitate in thereby offending Him who 
has given thee life and wisdom. Go meet&#44; then&#44; thy 
doom&#44; and teach by thy example and misery&#44; that 
those who forsake the Lord and his law have hewn 
themselves broken cisterns which hold not the living 
waters. &#8212; Brethren &#33; seed of Jacob &#33; children of Israel &#33; 
open your hearts to the instruction which God has 
vouchsafed to you&#59; and &#33; let it be your endeavour to 
deserve&#44; by serving Him in truth&#44; a return of his fa&#8211; 
vour&#59; and feel and know&#44; that only through obedience 
can we Israelites be happy&#44; and only through adhe&#8211; 
rence to the law can we deserve God&#39;s kindness and 
protection. 

O Thou&#33; who art ever the Guardian of Israel&#44; shield 
us by thy protecting wings&#44; and watch over us&#44; lest 
the nations swallow us up in their wrath. We know 
that we have sinned&#44; but do Thou&#44; O merciful God &#33; 
prove to us thy superabundant kindness&#44; and judge 
us not according to our misdeeds&#44; but according to 
thy mercy&#44; which is unending. And may it be thy 
will to revisit our captivity&#44; and number us like the 
shepherd numbers his flock&#44; that not one of them may 
escape his tender care&#44; and lift up thy hand a second 
time to restore the remnant of thy people which has 
escaped to thy holy mountain&#44; there to worship Thee 
for ever. Amen.

THE INSTITUTION OF PRAYER. 

O OUR God and Father &#33; hearken to our prayers&#44; and 
listen to the supplications which we pour out before 
Thee. And O grant us thy forgiveness on that fear&#8211; 
ful day which Thou hast appointed as the time of 
judgment for thy creatures &#59; and when Thou siftest 
our deeds and probest our transgressions&#44; mayest 
Thou say&#58; &#34;I will redeem them from going to de&#8211; 
struction&#44; I have found a redemption.&#34; May this be 
thy will. Amen 

Brethren &#33; 

The season has again arrived when the descendants 
of Israel&#44; who have but a spark of the holy fire left 
unquenched within their bosoms&#44; will hasten to the 
house of prayer to offer up their devotion to their 
God. And sweet indeed is the incense thus sacrificed 
on the altars of our Father&#44; and truly grateful in the 
Supreme Pres&#39;fence is the odour of such offerings &#59; for 
the humble outpourings of the heart that knows its 
weakness will never be despised by the Disposer of 
human destinies. Biat prayer to be acceptable&#44; to be 
a truly agreeable oflering&#44; should be prompted by 
holy feelings&#44; and be based upon a knowledge of our 
unworthiness and the acknowledgment of the evil of 
our ways. Many a one may enter these walls&#44; many 
a one may utter his orisons&#44; but his heart may be far

away&#44; wandering after his worldly pursuits&#44; and whilst 
his lips are praying&#44; his thoughts may be engaged in 
speculating on objects of pecuniary gain and interested 
in matters far from appertaining to the worship of 
God. Many persons praying&#44; or rather assembling 
under such disadvantageous and ungodly circum&#8211; 
stances&#44; there actually are&#44; and it is therefore neces&#8211; 
sary that we should endeavour to find out the proper 
feelings&#44; which ought to accompany us to the house 
of God. To come to a correct understanding on this 
point&#44; we must consider &#59; first&#44; to lohom we pray &#59; sec&#8211; 
ondly&#44; for lohat cause we pray&#44; and lastly&#44; what is to 
be effected by our prayers. 

Well has one of our wise men said &#58; nnx &#39;a &#39;jaS &#59;&#61;n 
noij&#61; &#34;Know before whom thou art standing.&#34; In this 
simple sentence Ave are reminded&#44; that our Hearer is 
not an ignorant man who understands not our words&#44; 
who knows not our wants&#59; not a wise man who may 
be deceived by our superior cunning&#44; or circumvented 
by our appearance&#59; not even a mighty potentate who 
may not be able by the insufficiency of his power to 
grant all our requests &#59; but it is our God&#44; who fully 
comprehends our words&#44; and is acquainted with our 
wants&#44; ay&#44; even before our lips give utterance to them. 
He is also wise&#44; it is beyond our cunning to deceive 
Him&#44; and no assumed appearance&#44; however ingeni&#8211; 
ously contrived&#44; can impose on his credulity &#59; for to 
Him who is all&#8211;seeing the inmost recesses of thought 
are laid open&#44; and He knows the secret motives of the 
most mysterious action perpetrated in the darkest 
corner&#44; the furthest removed from all human kind. 
And at last his power is unbounded&#44; and we need not 
fear in Him any inadequacy or inability to comply 

<pb n="199"/>

THE INSTITUTION OF PRAYER. 199 

with our demands&#44; if they are consonant with our ul&#8211; 
timate good &#59; and as his power is unlimited by time 
or circumstances&#44; we need not fear that our prayer 
has not been answered&#44; because our request is not 
immediately granted &#59; for since God is not less good 
than wise and powerful&#44; we should consider that our 
petition may be granted at a period remote from the 
present&#44; when it may redound more to our advantage 
and the repose of our soul. If now we come to pay 
our adorations&#44; it is obviously our first duty to remove 
all deceit and duplicity from our heart&#59; to endeavour 
to be fully impressed with the conviction&#44; that nothing 
but undivided sincerity will avail us&#44; since by no pos&#8211; 
sibility can we hope to deceive God. Secondly&#44; to 
come with humble confidence in our Father&#44; and not 
be deterred by the magnitude of our wants&#44; nor by 
the unworthiness of ourselves&#44; from laying our desires 
open to Him. And lastly&#44; to wait with becoming 
hope and resignation the fulfilment of our petition&#44; 
not to be depressed at finding ourselves rejected for 
a brief space &#59; nor to be elated with pride when we 
witness the accomplishment of our wishes &#59; nor may 
we be looking upon ourselves as righteous beyond 
our neighbours&#44; because our prayer has been answer&#8211; 
ed. But we should consider that&#44; if our wishes are 
not done&#44; we in our ignorance have perhaps desired 
that which&#44; if granted&#44; would be hurtful to us&#44; and 
that perhaps our previous sins have deprived us of 
the asked&#8211;for advantage. In either of these cases&#44; we 
should endeavour to amend our course and watch our 
own feelings narrowly&#44; to seek out the error which 
will at length&#44; upon an honest investigation&#44; be dis&#8211; 
covered in ourselves. In case&#44; however&#44; that our 

<pb n="200"/>

200 THE INSTITUTION OF PRAYER. 

petition is granted&#44; it would be ridiculous in the ex&#8211; 
treme&#44; if&#44; because God has been kind and merciful to 
us&#44; we should therefore wax proud in our hearts and 
look upon others with contempt&#59; since this indeed 
Avould at once prove that we are absolutely unworthy 
of the favour of God. For if we fairly examine our 
course of life&#44; and reflect how often we have vexed 
God by our sinfulness&#44; and how often we have been 
remiss or lukewarm in the practice of the righteous&#8211; 
ness demanded at our hands &#58; we will surely have no 
cause to elevate ourselves above our neighbours&#44; who&#44; 
if even acknowledgedly more wicked than we&#44; may 
not have had the opportunities for improvement nor 
the benefits of a holy example which to enjoy may 
have been our happy lot. 

Whenever then we go to pour out our heart in 
prayer&#44; it should be done with a sincere confidence 
on the unlimited bounty of God&#44; and with a firm re&#8211; 
liance that whatever He may vouchsafe to decree&#44; that 
alone is the best and most conducive to our own wel&#8211; 
fare and the happiness of others. And in this spirit 
our wise men relate&#44; that the high&#8211;priest during his 
annual ofiiciating in the holy of holies prayed&#44; that 
&#34; the petition of wayfarers may not be listened to&#44; to 
stay the blessings of the descending rain when the 
world is in need thereof&#44;&#34; for to grant the request of 
such an individual thus praying would be to the det&#8211; 
riment and injury of the many. It is therefore not 
acting in the spirit of becoming deference&#44; if the peti&#8211; 
tioner comes to the throne of Grace with a long reci&#8211; 
tal of his own merits &#59; for let a man observe ever so 
many Sabbaths&#44; let his charity be ever so unbounded&#44; 
let his philanthropy indeed cheer up the countenance 

<pb n="201"/>

of all that suffer&#58; still all these virtues and many 
others superadded cannot&#44; should not make an erring 
mortal think&#44; that now his claims to divine grace are 
established on so iirm a footing&#44; that he may ask in a 
tone of authority&#44; or appeal with a confidence of as&#8211; 
sured success. If one prays in such a spirit of ar&#8211; 
rogance&#44; he deserves not that He that answereth 
prayers should vouchsafe to him his request&#59; since 
the first requisites towards obtaining grace&#44; humility 
and devotion&#44; are supplanted by pride and arrogance. 
And in this&#44; as in many other points&#44; we have a beau&#8211; 
tiful example of piety set us by our great teacher&#44; who 
was indeed the shining light and the guiding star sent 
to lead a newly redeemed people to a happiness which 
should not be merely temporal and confined to one 
spot&#44; but lasting and universal &#59; and thus though the 
land of Palestine&#44; our temporal inheritance&#44; has been 
rendered desolate&#44; though Jerusalem our holy city is 
now surrounded with wastes and ruins &#58; yet the law 
is not wrested from us&#44; and the examples of holiness 
and piety it contains flow continually into our souls 
to refresh and invigorate them&#44; like the meadow 
stream which meanders along through grassy banks 
and shady groves&#44; fertilizing the soil in its course&#44; 
which otherwise would be barren and dreary. In 
Moses&#39;s own family there was afiiiction &#59; his brother 
and sister&#44; they who had been associated with him in 
the holy work of redeeming their fellow&#8211;believers&#44; 
had sinned against him their brother and teacher&#44; 
and God&#44; incensed at their misconduct&#44; and ever act&#8211; 
ing up to that great principle&#44; that the greater the 
piety of an individual the more strictly will also be 
the retribution to which he will be held&#44; punished

Miriam with leprosy&#44; that loathsome disease&#44; which 
caused the infected to be removed out of the commu&#8211; 
nity of Israel and compelled them to live in solitude. 
Seeing his sister&#39;s affliction&#44; Moses did not remind 
God of the many acts of devotion&#44; nor of the many 
good works wrought by him &#59; but he called simply 
in the most humble and confiding manner on the 
Healer of the sick to grant her relief&#44; saying&#58; &#34;O 
God &#33; I pray thee&#44; do thou heal her.&#34; You will ob&#8211; 
serve&#44; brethren&#44; that these few words&#44; including every 
thing which was needed&#44; presented without parade or 
ostentation&#44; were graciously received&#44; and the leper 
was healed after a probation of seven days had elapsed. 
An example from so high a source should not be 
without its efiect upon us&#44; and as Moses did&#44; so should 
we also do &#59; in whatever trouble and sorrow we may 
be plunged&#44; whatever joy may elevate our hearts&#44; we 
should resort in all humility&#44; free from pride and ar&#8211; 
rogance&#44; either to lay our wants in sincerity before 
God&#44; or to offer Him our thanks with heartfelt grati&#8211; 
tude. And if we approach the Lord in this manner&#44; 
as children that come before their father&#44; we need not 
tremble at the immeasurable distance which divides 
us from the Most High &#59; we need not then be struck 
with fear&#44; because we are sinful and He is great &#59; but 
we may be comforted with the assurance that our 
offering will be received and our supplication listened 
to with favour&#44; for He the Ruler and Preserver of all 
things feels for&#44; and cares for&#44; all his creatures&#44; from 
the greatest to the lowest. 

Next let us consider the second question proposed &#58; 
&#34; For what cause shall we pray &#61;&#34; It must be evident 
to every one endowed with common sense&#44; that there 

<pb n="203"/>

THE INSTITUTION OF PRAYER. 203 

are many circumstances and occurrences in life&#44; where 
all human agency is incapable of rendering us the least 
service. There are moments&#44; when the heart is full 
to overflowing with joy or with sorrow&#44; when we are 
in danger&#44; either of being corrupted by pride&#44; or of 
sinking into the slough of despair. Ay&#44; there are 
seasons&#44; when we would shun to confide to any hu&#8211; 
man ear what rests heavily on our mind&#44; when we 
are disgusted&#44; satiated with things of evanescent life&#44; 
when we are wearied with the same dull round of 
care and labour which constantly oppresses us&#44; and 
when the sight of a fellow&#8211;mortal becomes almost 
loathing&#44; and when the words of encouragement&#44; of 
censure&#44; or of praise will fall on our ears like the 
rattling of the bones of some suspended malefactor&#44; 
hateful beyond endurance. Again there are times&#44; 
when we are forsaken by all the world&#44; when for foul 
suspicion we are cast into a dungeon&#44; exjDOsed to a 
public trial&#44; condemned to an ignominious punish&#8211; 
ment&#44; and left to pine in solitude&#44; vainly recurring to 
our former life&#44; and regretting too late that we gave 
way to temptations&#44; when an opposite course might 
have given us comfort and prosperity. &#8212; The child too 
may follow to the tomb the remains of his last be&#8211; 
loved parent&#39; the father may weep over the early 
bier of his only offspring&#44; and the husband may 
mourn over the grave of the dearly&#8211;beloved and 
early&#8211;called wife of his bosom&#58; who is there amono&#8211; 
men that can speak consolation to them &#8212; what on 
earth is there to bid their hearts rejoice&#44; they&#44; to 
whom all around is gloom and despair&#61; And even 
heap riches up for either &#58; and the son will tell you 
that yonder grave hides the guide of his youth&#44; the

friend of his infancy&#44; and the author of his existence. 
And the father&#39;s only hope&#44; the stay of his old age&#44; is 
closed up in the cold earth&#44; and he heeds not the 
world&#39;s greatness&#44; because he is no more &#33; &#8212; The hus&#8211; 
band has lost her&#44; who was to him dearer than life&#44; 
the mother of his children&#44; the partner of his joys 
and of his sorrows&#44; her&#44; with whom he vainly hoped 
to pass down the vale of life in harmony and concert&#59; 
and her&#44; the life of his life&#44; death has snatched from 
him in the bloom of youth and usefulness. &#8212; In all 
such instances it should be our duty to resort to pray&#8211; 
er&#44; either to unburden ourselves of the load which 
oppresses us in the presence of Him&#44; who can alone 
remove the weight&#44; or to give vent to our surcharged 
feelings and ask consolation and assistance of the Lord 
of consolations and the Saviour of mankind. &#8212; When 
the measure of thy joy has suddenly become filled to 
excess&#44; when thy giddy brain refuses to bear with 
meekness the exuberance of the blessings received&#44; 
O mortal man &#33; hie thee to the house of God&#44; and 
sacrifice there to Him thy thanks&#44; and humble thy&#8211; 
self at his feet&#44; and reflect that He who gave thee 
joy can take aAvay again the gift He has bestowed&#59; 
and thou wilt return to thy dwelling with the peace 
of God within thee&#44; filled with humility and lowli&#8211; 
ness because of thy perishable greatness&#44; and imbued 
with love and kindness towards all&#44; who like thee 
are inhabitants of the mortal clayey dwellings. &#8212; If 
thou art wearied with the cares of life&#44; if the burden 
of existence has become too heavy for thee&#58; seek 
again relief from thy God. Eeflect that it is thy des&#8211; 
tined appointment to earn thy bread with the sweat 
of thy face&#44; and that thy lot is not heavier than that

of others&#44; since no one&#44; however exalted&#44; is free from 
care and sorrow. And if this reflection fails to give 
thee comfort&#44; then forget all thy dissatisfaction and 
lay open thy heart to thy Maker&#44; ask of Him for 
strength and support &#58; and surely thy prayer will he 
answered&#44; and thy toil will be lightened&#44; and thy 
burden will be eased &#59; and thou wilt again mix with 
the cheerful groups of associates&#44; and smile with the 
smiling&#44; shed a tear of sympathy with the afilicted&#44; 
feel a new interest in life&#44; and gladly do those duties 
which the station assigned to thee may demand at thy 
hands. The spirit of despondency will then fly away&#44; 
and the gloom of despair will vanish&#59; and the fields 
will smile again in verdure clad&#44; the blithesome song 
of the feathered minstrels will again sound sweetly&#44; 
the flowers will again send forth their odours &#59; and 
reconciled to thyself and nature&#44; thou wilt thank God&#44; 
who has through darkness led thee to feel the more 
strongly his love and power. 

Thou&#33; who languishest in captivity&#44; imagine not 
that thy hope has fled for ever. E&#39;o &#8212; sinner though 
thou art&#44; forsaken though thou deemest thyself&#44; though 
a prison holds .thy fettered limbs&#58; there is One above 
that watches&#44; that cares for thee. &#34;He slumbereth 
not and He sleepeth not&#44;&#34; says the holy singer&#44; &#34;the 
guardian of Israel&#44;&#34; and He who so bounteously cares 
for all his creatures has not forgotten thee&#44; the captive 
and forlorn. lift but thy obdurate heart to Him &#33; 
O cease but thy vain repining&#44; let but a holy hope in&#8211; 
vigorate thy heart&#58; and instantaneously will enlarge&#8211; 
ment come to thee even in thy captivity&#59; and the 
sunbeam which lights up thy narrow cell will teach 
thee&#44; that the light of heaven is not yet quenched&#44;

that tlie goodness of the Creator is not ended&#44; al&#8211; 
though thou for thy crimes are doomed to suffer. If 
thus thou thinkest&#44; thy captivity will be a blessing to 
thee&#59; since it has rescued thee from the grasp of sin&#44; 
and united thee again to thy God and Lord. &#8212; And if 
thou art suffering innocently&#44; if thou languishest for 
the glorification of the holy name&#44; if heathens in their 
triumph punish thee&#44; because thou refusest to join 
their unhallowed rites&#58; then surely thou mayest feel 
comfort in the knowledge that the God for whose 
law&#39;s sake thou suiferest&#44; will number thy tears&#44; so 
that not one of them shall be forgotten&#44; and He will 
treasure them up in his receptacle&#44; and will cleanse 
thy soul&#44; and purify thy heart&#44; till thou at the end of 
days wilt shine forth among the righteous ones&#44; with 
the effulgence of the stars for ever more. 

And thou son&#33; who mournest for thy father &#8212; pa&#8211; 
rent&#33; who complainest because thy only one is taken 
&#8212; husband &#33; who bewailest a beloved wife&#44; all ye come 
hither to the temple of our heavenly Father. Ye 
lament the loss of earthly friends&#44; friends deservedly 
dear&#44; deservedly valued&#59; but reflect who it is that 
decreed their doom&#33; Our frame being constituted 
mortal it results that our bodies must be given to 
decay&#44; our flesh must again be changed to the dust&#59; 
&#34;for dust we are and to dust we must return.&#34; Can 
we ward off the shafts which are constantly flying&#61; 
Is there not a period set to our days&#61; What matters 
it then&#44; whether a few brief years more or less have 
been assigned to us&#44; provided we do our duty as men&#44; 
and endeavour to deserve the favour of our Maker&#61; 
Since&#44; therefore&#44; death is inevitable&#44; it is necessary 
that friends must always be prepared to meet with

becoming resignation the day when their connexion 
must be severed for a period&#44; a period I say&#44; for a 
reunion must take place before many years have com&#8211; 
pleted their course. Instead therefore of lamenta&#8211; 
tions carried to a sinful excess&#44; ye should reflect that 
God took away your relatives&#44; because their task was 
done&#59; and you should only hope that they now enjoy 
rest and happiness in the presence of their Maker. 
And in place of repining&#44; pray fervently that strength 
may be given you that you also may live in piety and 
holiness &#59; so that when your course too is ended&#44; you 
also may meet in yonder life with that beatitude 
which&#44; it is to be hoped&#44; God has already decreed to 
those who were so dear to you. If you act and pray 
thus&#44; you will be resigned to the decrees of Him&#44; all 
whose ways are just&#44; and you will cease to complain 
of your hard fate&#44; which is at best but the common 
portion of humanity. &#8212; In short&#44; upon every occasion&#44; 
where we may require heavenly counsel or heavenly 
assistance&#44; we should resort to prayer&#44; and express 
fearlessly&#44; with a sincere outpouring of the spirit&#44; 
whatever we stand in need of. This also we are 
taught in the first book of Kings&#44; viii. 38&#8211;40 &#58; 


&#34; Every prayer and every supplication which any man may make

of all thy people Israel&#44; who may know each the affliction of his 
heart&#44; and spread out his hands to this house &#59; and do Thou hear in 
heaven&#44; thy dwelling&#8211;place&#44; and forgive&#44; and do to each man accord&#8211; 
ing to his ways&#44; inasmuch as Thou knowest his heart&#59; for Thou 
alone knowest the heart of all the children of man. In order that 
they may fear Thee all the days which they live upon the land&#44; 
which Thou hast o&#8211;iven to our fathers.&#34; 



In this beautiful extract from tlie fervid prayer of 
Solomon at the dedication of the temple we have a 
brief elucidation of the whole object and scope of 
prayer&#59; for here he lays down with the utmost pre&#8211; 
cision&#44; that every man&#44; no matter how heavy his guilt 
or affliction may be&#44; provided the heart be sincere&#44; 
should come and prostrate himself before God&#44; spread 
out his hands as it were towards the temple&#44; and ask 
for whatever his case demands from Him who prom&#8211; 
ised to let his glory dwell among us. And even to 
this day &#34;it is to the East that the Hebrew bends&#44;&#34; 
it is in the direction of that holy temple from which 
our sins have caused us to wander&#44; that we direct 
our face during our prayers&#44; and in this manner we 
contribute to keep alive within our bosom the sacred 
flame&#44; which yet burns with a yearning towards those 
hallowed fields and those venerated shrines from 
which we have been driven. Let it then be our en&#8211; 
deavour to call for assistance on Him&#44; who is able to 
assist us amidst every danger and to rescue us from 
all tribulations. And every morning too&#44; and when 
the sun is bending his face towards the west&#44; and 
every evening when the glorious light of day has 
set&#44; and every night before we seek our couch&#44; let us 
pour out our orisons before our heavenly Father&#44; and 
let us at every hour&#44; at every period of our life&#44; con&#8211;

stantly thank Him for the many favours He has so 
graciously bestowed. 

The third part of our subject&#44; &#34; What is to be effected 
by our prayers&#61;&#34; now demands our consideration. &#8212; 
Persons may ask &#58; &#34; What need has God of our prayers&#44; 
when He is assuredly acquainted with our wants 
before we express them in words&#33;&#34; No one more 
cheerfully acknowledges God&#39;s all&#8211;pervading om&#8211; 
niscience than we do &#58; still it must be admitted that 
prayer is necessary&#44; not &#40;as may be erroneously sup&#8211; 
posed&#41; to inform God&#44; but to impress on our own 
mind our dependence&#44; yes our entire dependence for 
every comfort and blessing we enjoy. Worldly men 
are but too apt to think much of their own power&#44; as 
though their strong arm were enough for them&#44; and 
they accordingly never or but rarely pray&#59; for in effect 
they think themselves placed beyond the necessity of 
asking assistance from God &#58; hence too they are proud&#44; 
vain&#44; selfish&#44; and self&#8211;sufficient. But suddenly their 
evil day comes&#44; and their riches take unto themselves 
wings and fly away&#59; the number of their children is 
diminished by death &#59; and then their intellect is often 
reduced to madness&#44; and they present a striking ex&#8211; 
ample of what man is when God&#39;s protection is with&#8211; 
drawn. But the humble and meek&#44; who daily resort 
to a communion with the invisible Power that sur&#8211; 
rounds all&#44; who express in words the filial confidence 
they really feel&#44; are truly&#44; and in every sense of the 
words&#44; removed beyond the chances and changes of 
life. To them even in misfortunes and sufterings 
there are peace and enjoyment&#44; and the world may 
exhaust its malice against them&#44; without disturbing 
the sacred trust they feel in Heaven. Besides&#44; the

210 THE INSTITUTION OF PRAYEE. 

Bible does teacli us&#44; that God grants the prayers of 
his adorers&#44; now&#44; though He is not made more con&#8211; 
scious of our wants than Ho was before we prayed &#58; 
still we must look upon prayer as we do upon any 
other virtuous act&#44; which is to be performed for the 
sake of making ourselves worthy of the favour of 
God. &#8212; If we go to pray for any calamity&#44; or in any 
tribulation&#44; or in any impending danger&#44; it is obvi&#8211; 
ously necessary that we must look into our own hearts 
to see if all is right there&#44; and we must examine our 
conduct both past and present to observe whether or 
not sin and corruption lurk there as the parents of 
evil. In this manner we take God to witness&#44; so to 
say&#44; that we wish his protection&#44; in consecpience of 
which we prepare ourselves to become his servants 
more intimately than we have been hitherto. Now&#44; 
God does not need our words to satisfy Him of our in&#8211; 
tentions&#44; but we need it&#59; the heart to feel truly should 
clothe its thoughts in words&#44; this makes the impres&#8211; 
sion more lasting&#44; it fixes the more strongly the ref&#8211; 
ormation that is once begun&#59; and who knows but 
that the Almighty may do according to all that we 
ask&#44; when He perceives that&#44; by preparing ourselves 
truly for prayer&#44; we have changed for the better&#44; and 
now abhor the evil which we formerly loved&#61; ISTo 
wonder need therefore be expressed that the Omnis&#8211; 
cient has told his people to pray to Him and to call 
on his holy Name&#59; He asks for a devotional spirit&#44; for 
pure and elevated thought&#44; and as a reward for such 
a petition He promises to relent &#40;to use human ex&#8211; 
pressions&#44; since even of the holiest things we must 
speak as men dp&#41; from the intended evil&#59; not as 
though He&#44; the unchangeable One&#44; had altered his

purpose&#44; but because man has himself rescinded the 
evil&#44; menaced for his misconduct&#44; by a change of his 
deeds&#44; and has thus secured an alteration of his fate&#44; 
a reversion from the curses to the blessinscs. Just as 
at the making of the golden calf God did not utterly 
destroy the Israelites&#44; because Moses prayed&#44; and be&#8211; 
cause there were yet multitudes left who had never 
swerved from the righteous path&#44; and had remained 
true when many went astray. brethren&#44; let this 
lesson not be lost upon you&#59; return to the Lord with 
prayer like the men of i>rineveh&#44; and God may revoke 
the evil&#44; and you may not perish. The season of re&#8211;&#44; 
pentance is at hand&#33; soon will the sound of the sho&#8211; 
pliar announce in all the&#34; assemblies of the remnant 
of Israel that the ISTew Year has arrived&#44; that we have 
again lived to commence a new season from the crea&#8211; 
tion of the world. How many hours of anguish have 
passed over our heads in the year that has passed and 
gone &#59; how many bitter tears have flowed to the 
memory of the departed &#59; how many sighs have been 
heaved over fortunes lost&#44; over riches foolishly squan&#8211; 
dered&#59; how many hours of regret have &#8211;we purchased 
unto ourselves by our forgetful n ess of the Lord&#39;s be&#8211; 
hests&#44; commanded to our ancestors &#33; And shall the 
season of prayer pass away&#44; and not one of us return 
to the bosom of the great Father whom we have fa&#8211; 
tigued&#44; as the prophet says&#44; by our works&#61; shall all 
the admonitions have been vouchsafed&#44; and still our 
hearts remain obdurate&#61; shall the day never come 
when the sinners will seek again the fold from which 
they have strayed&#61; Let us hope&#44; at least&#44; for better 
things&#44; and let us trust that many will come to join 
the band of brethren who have yet the fear of God

may be increased a thousand&#8211;fold&#44; who all may know 
before whom they pray&#44; who pray to the Lord in their 
affliction&#44; and who are drawn closer to Him every 
time their mouth utters the praise of God. Let then 
all Israel listen with fear to the voice of the cornet 
when it sounds like the alarum through the land&#44; let 
it rouse them to exertion in behalf of their souls&#59; so 
that&#44; universal piety prevailing&#44; we all may live to

Hearer of prayer &#33; to Thee all flesh cometh. O 
grant Thou our desire&#44; and raise up to us teachers of 
righteousness in whose mouth thy word may dwell&#44; 
that they may teach thy people of thy ways. Teach 
them what they shall say&#44; make them understand 
what they shall speak&#44; that they may communicate 
to others of thy children the holy love that burns 
within them. And grant to all thy adorers&#44; be they 
wise or foolish&#44; great or humble&#44; thy blessing&#44; and in&#8211; 
scribe all in the book of life&#44; when Thou approach est 
to judge the children of men&#44; the creatures of thy 
hand. Be this thy will&#44; and may the words of our 
mouth and the thoughts of our hearts&#44; be acceptable

Brethren&#33; 

When we look upon one of the outcasts of human 
society&#44; made outcast by his own folly and crime &#58; we&#44; 
who have not yet sunk so far&#44; must wonder&#44; how one&#44; 
who like us bears the impress of God&#39;s image on his 
countenance&#44; could become so miserably degraded. 
It is to us incomprehensible&#44; how any one can feel 
the least joy in wallowing drunk in the mire&#59; how

any one&#44; calling himself tlie father of a family&#44; could 
stake his last shilling at the gaming&#8211;table &#59; how the 
husband could leave his chosen wife&#44; the mother of 
his children&#44; to riot in the embrace of a wanton &#59; 
how any one at all imbued with reason&#44; could for&#8211; 
swear his God&#44; and doubt in the existence of the 
Creator. In short&#44; the utter degradation by crime&#44; 
displayed in all its horrors before us&#44; is a spectacle 
not alone revolting&#44; but of astonishment also &#59; since 
with ever so humble an opinion of ourselves&#44; with 
ever so much charity and indulgence towards human 
failings and frailties&#44; we cannot avoid looking upon 
ourselves with some satisfaction that we are not de&#8211; 
graded like those sinners. But whilst we experience 
this feeling&#44; it should be mingled with thankfulness 
to God&#44; for having preserved us from temptations&#44; 
and given us strength to withstand the allurements 
by which others fell&#59; for though nothing is more 
established than that every one must make the be&#8211; 
gmnirig to be good&#44; still it is equally certain&#44; that 
divine assistance is afibrded to whomever makes the 
beginning&#44; in the words of our sages &#58; &#34; He that comes to purify himself will be 
assisted from Heaven.&#34; If we view the grievous sin&#8211; 
ners in this light&#44; our abhorrence for their actions 
will not be coupled Avith pride&#44; and their fall will in 
truth be a warning to us&#44; that we may avoid sinning 
as they have done. For when we come to look into 
the history of the persons exhibited above&#44; we must 
be soon convinced that they were born as virtuously 
as we have been&#44; with just the same feelings&#44; pas&#8211; 
sions&#44; and propensities&#44; besides which it is very often 
the case that their and our education have been pre&#8211;

cisely alike&#44; at least to outward appearances. It may 
also be taken for granted&#44; I would almost venture to 
say as an established maxim in morals&#44; that no man 
becomes suddenly wicked. The question then for 
us to ponder on is&#58; &#34;How have these men become so 
lost to all sense of duty V There are two ways at 
least in which the mystery can be solved. First&#44; it 
may be a defect in education&#44; which in being of the 
outward kind may leave the heart unimproved&#44; and 
expose it thus to be ensnared by the power of sin. 
Let us suppose an example &#58; There was a man&#44; who 
in his childhood was instructed in accomplishments&#44; 
in arts&#44; and in sciences&#44; but the law of God was not 
impressed on his soul. As a boy he was left to his 
uncontrolled will&#44; and his inclinations had not the 
curb of restraint laid on them. His passions showed 
themselves in petty tyranny over his fellows &#59; but he 
went unwhipped of the rod of a father&#39;s correction. 
He next grew up to manhood&#39;s years &#59; but the hom&#8211; 
age his talents justly received from the world was 
by no means calculated to lessen the opinion he en&#8211; 
tertained of his own importance. His arrogance was 
even nourished&#44; at seeing others&#44; whom common par&#8211; 
lance stigmatized as of inferior birth and meaner 
grade in life&#44; &#34;endeavouring to outstrip or rival him 
in the path of preferment. Do you think that he 
could have been left uncontaminated in moral con&#8211; 
duct&#44; while his feelings and sentiments had become 
gradually vitiated &#61; Is it likely that no crime&#44; how&#8211; 
ever secret and well covered&#44; or that no act of diso&#8211; 
bedience to parental authority and the divine will 
had been committed &#61; It would be over charitable 
to suppose a favourable reply possible. But even

assume that all hitherto had been right within&#44; yet it 
is certain that an outward morality without a holy 
conviction&#44; and withal undermined by pride&#44; could 
be no safeguard against temptation. And lo &#33; an of&#8211; 
fence against his dignity was committed&#44; say one of 
his friends or himself should have been publicly in&#8211; 
sulted &#58; and he&#44; unguarded and corrupted in mind&#44; 
seized the weapon of deadly strife&#44; and his guilty 
hand was imbrued and dyed red in a brother&#39;s blood. 
&#8212; You say&#44; perhaps&#44; that one so guilty from such a 
cause is a mere fiction &#59; alas&#44; no&#44; brethren &#33; the exam&#8211; 
ples of the dreadful reality are but too common&#44; and 
many a family now mourns over their blighted hopes 
brought about by the indulgence of unguarded and 
unchecked anger&#44; vented in murder and homicide. &#8212; 
Let us take another case&#44; not one for which the angry 
Judge above would demand&#44; &#34; Where is thy brother&#44;&#34; 
and condemn one whom the innocent blood crying 
from the polluted earth accuses &#59; but of an infatuated 
voluptuary&#44; a devotee to pleasure&#44; who is ruining his 
health and happiness upon the path he has chosen to 
tread. Again&#44; let us suppose him to belong to the 
better classes&#44; a man of education and refinement&#44; 
endowed with reason of a higher degree&#44; and in pos&#8211; 
session of wealth and power. Of course all these ad&#8211; 
vantages tend to give him a certain importance in the 
eyes of society as well as in bis own. And should 
he&#44; the man of refinement&#44; of intellect&#44; of renown&#44; 
of wealth&#44; and of standing&#44; submit to be controlled 
by antiquated statutes by which the unlettered peas&#8211; 
ant is governed &#61; should he consent to belong to the 
common herd of commonplace moral people&#44; who 
fear God as their fathers have done before them &#61;

Not SO can our genius act&#59; and behold&#33; he runs riot 
in his excitements&#44; in his pursuits of novelty and en&#8211; 
joyment&#44; and he falls deeper and deeper into moral 
debasement&#44; and he grows cloyed with tasting the 
high&#8211;seasoned food his appetite has so long craved&#44; 
and he perhaps leaves his once&#8211;loved home&#44; a volun&#8211; 
tary exile&#44; and his heart becomes soured to all ap&#8211; 
proaches of humane feelings&#44; and he sinks&#44; a prey to 
the gnawing of an overloaded conscience and the op&#8211; 
pression of a heart destroyed by remorse&#44; into an 
early and untimely grave&#44; a dire monument of the 
efi&#39;ects of unregulated passions&#44; and desires uncurbed 
by religion and morality. &#8212; In the two instances here 
exhibited&#44; we have seen how a disregard to the in&#8211; 
culcation of sound religious and moral principles 
in childhood may cause many noble souls to be lost&#44; 
by leaving them unguarded against the approach of 
sin&#44; or rather by removing all defences by which the 
enemy can be warded off. &#8212; It must be apparent that 
sinning even to degradation in such cases is a result 
to be expected&#44; and in place of wondering that so 
many become lost&#44; it is very remarkable how any one 
in such circumstances ever escapes the contamination. 
&#8212; Besides those of the gifted and higher classes&#44; the 
uneducated aftd poor are no less subject&#44; under simi&#8211; 
lar conditions&#44; to enormities only varied in shape&#44; 
nature&#44; and appearance by the difference of station 
and opportunity&#59; and in truth our daily experience 
proves&#44; how much and how awfully responsible pa&#8211; 
rents&#44; particularly of the humbler classes&#44; must be to 
God for the neglect which they suffer their children 
to experience in not attending to&#44; and watching over&#44; 
and curbing the iirst outbreakings of the evil pas&#8211;

sions.&#34; It were easy to pourtray to you a poor man&#44; 
who might have been an ornament to his station&#44; but 
has become degraded from similar causes&#44; only acting 
in a difierent manner&#44; which we have shown to be so 
pernicious in the wise and wealthy&#59; but it is needless 
to fatigue your patience by detaining you with a re&#8211; 
cital of examples which&#44; alas &#33; are so numerous that 
any one of the least experience must be acquainted 
with many. 

A second reason of moral debasement may be found 
in the carelessness with which we are apt to watch 
ourselves&#59; and unfortunately from this cause proceeds 
the ruin of many a noble mind from whose former 
course of life&#44; and from whose previous training bet&#8211; 
ter results might have been expected. As the world 
is constituted&#44; we are always surrounded by tempta&#8211; 
tions in a greater or less degree&#44; and in combatting 
these successfully consists the duty of our life. But 
how many do fail in this &#33; how many yield&#44; totter&#44; 
and stumble &#33; how few who remain steadfast&#44; un&#8211; 
dismayed&#44; and unblinded by the manifold allure&#8211; 
ments &#33; True&#44; no one becomes depraved from yield&#8211; 
ing to the first temptation &#59; but the road to evil has 
certainly been trod&#44; and the downward path has been 
made more pleasing&#44; at least less abhorrent to the 
imagination. &#8212; Imagine a man that has for years been 
sober and abstemious in his habits &#59; hitherto his life 
has been one of ease and comfort&#44; his children have 
grown up around him in strength and beauty&#44; and he 
is called among the happy&#44; one of the happiest &#59; but 
human prosperity is not everlasting&#59; and his evil 
hour also has arrived&#59; his wealth has become im&#8211; 
paired by unfortunate speculations&#44; or some other

evil befals him which to him is grievous to bear &#59; he 
has heard that wine drowns sorrow&#44; and he resorts 
to it for rehef as a trial &#59; he stiipifies his brain into 
temporary forgetfulness by the enemy he puts into 
his mouth that robs him&#39;of his reason. But anon&#44; he 
awakes&#44; he feels perhaps degraded at his weakness&#44; 
and finds his sorrow more agonizing than before &#59; a 
deeper potation will be the next step&#44; and his inebriety 
will be of longer duration &#59; till by degrees&#44; seeing his 
misery increasing&#44; his health waning&#44; he resorts to 
drink as his sole comforter&#44; imagining that his great&#8211; 
est enemy&#44; the chief promoter perhaps of his sorrow&#44; 
the consummator of his sufferings&#44; could be the heal&#8211; 
ing balm which his wounded spirit demands &#58; and 
you at length see him the outcast&#44; wallowing in the 
mire&#44; a disgrace&#44; a spectacle&#44; a byword&#44; when he 
might have been&#44; as he once was&#44; an example of ab&#8211; 
stinence&#44; of virtue&#44; and of piety &#33; Do I exaggerate &#61; &#8212; 
Alas&#44; no &#33; the annals of degradation speak also of ex&#8211; 
amples like this too numerous for the happiness and 
welfare of society&#33;

cannot give his children bread&#44; when they cry in their 
hunger. And yet he was not always vicious &#33; In an

for gold&#44; for unholy lucre &#8212; shall I pursue the gambler

to become wealthy and overloaded with treasure&#44; a

Another man has walked in the fear of his God

he ventured among those who scoff&#42; at Providence 
and scorn the power of the Most High. He listened 
to their wild harangues&#44; he was startled by their 
avowal&#58; &#34;Let us eat&#44; let us drink&#44; let us enjoy our 
existence whilst we may&#44; for to&#8211;morrow we die.&#34;

at their seeming candour&#44; for their sophistry as yet 
concealed their ulterior tenets. Anon they went far&#8211; 
ther&#44; they said&#44; that there is no heavenly law &#8212; relig&#8211; 
ion has no foundation in fact &#8212; morality is a restraint 
on the inclinations&#44; an abridgment of our personal 
liberty&#44; an invention of priests and of tyrants&#44; who 
.want to rule the world by keeping them under the 
restraint of ignorance and superstition. He&#44; who 
had once admitted that pleasure is an object worth 
living for&#44; had also to admit the superfluity&#44; the in&#8211; 
juriousness of religious restraint. jS&#39;ext&#44; the retribu&#8211; 
tion after death was denounced&#59; and the new convert 
embraced also the doctrine of everlasting sleep. Thus 
initiated&#44; what was to him the Creator&#61; no law&#44; ac&#8211; 
cording to those pernicious notions was given &#59; pleas&#8211; 
ure is the grand object of life &#59; there is no life after 
death &#59; no reward &#59; no punishment. And at last he 
heard proclaimed aloud what the fool says in his 
heart&#44; &#39; There is no God&#44;&#34; and the madman grasped 
at this idea to slay within him the last lurking affec&#8211; 
tion for the religion of his ancestors &#59; and now&#44; he 
too&#44; like his teachers&#44; scoffed against all that is holy&#44; 
he bid defiance to the power of Heaven&#44; imagining 
that the watchful Eye was closed for him&#44; because he 
denied his existence. What course of crime was now 
open for him&#33; with adulterers he harboured&#59; with 
blasphemers he revelled&#44; with murderers he associa&#8211; 
ted&#44; and on the altar of bloodstained liberty he im&#8211; 
molated his benefactors&#44; his friends&#44; and his kindred&#44; 
and exhibited even his father&#39;s head as an evidence 
of his virtue &#33; abused word&#44; when thus applied to dig&#8211; 
nify horrors and crimes. &#8212; But his doings did not last 
for ever&#44; and a sudden and awful death closed his

career&#44; whilst yet uttering his imprecations against 
the Supreme Judge&#44; ay&#44; on the very day on which he 
had bid defiance&#44; on which lie denied his existence&#44; 
he was made to feel his power&#44; and hurried hence&#44; to 
answer at that dread tribunal for his misdeeds&#44; and for 
the grace abused&#44; and for the law he had forsaken. 

Yet another who abandoned the path of righteous&#8211; 
ness had borne in better days the character of an up&#8211; 
right man&#59; he was fair in his dealings&#44; and nothing 
unlawfully obtained was found in his possession. To 
the widow he was a protector&#44; and a guardian he was 
to the orphan. But his hour of trial came&#59; the pros&#8211; 
perity of his early years was declining&#44; and in his 
tribulation he called not on God for assistance&#44; he 
sought not for aid from the merciful One&#44; and he 
relied on his ingenuity to extricate himself from his 
difficulties. False shame prevented him from laying 
his distressed situation open before his friends&#44; his 
resolution wavered&#44; and he appropriated to his own 
use the substance of the widow and of the orphan 
intrusted to his care&#44; and he associated at length with 
plunderers and shared their spoils&#44; till his turpitude 
became known to the ministers of the law&#44; and he 
was punished for the injuries he had done to his 
fellow&#8211;men. &#8212; More examples might be furnished&#59; we 
could follow sinners of every kind step by step&#44; from 
the first petty crime to the consummation of daring&#8211; 
deeds and high&#8211;handed outrage &#59; but enough has been 
shown to prove that the first step taken in sin makes 
sinning easy and pleasant&#44; and that therefore we need 
not express so much surprise at the sight of great 
criminality in others&#44; when we reflect how nearly we 
are at all times exposed to become what they are

already. Let no man&#42; think himself secure in his 
imagined excellence&#44; for confidence is the forerunner 
of deterioration &#59; but when we are watchful&#44; and re&#8211; 
gard with care every step we take&#44; we may then hope 
to maintain that degree of excellence which we have 
once obtained&#44; and&#42; if we look upon every act of piety&#44; 
no matter how trifling&#44; as useful&#44; we will indeed reach 
an enviable degree of moral excellence. Just as the 
fair creation of God is made up both of little creatures 
and large ones&#44; as the humble violet is no less fra&#8211; 
grant than the magnificent citron &#58; so has every good 
act its beneficial eftect&#44; so does every obedience to 
God increase and strengthen the purity of our souls. 
And in this wise taught Ben Azzai&#44; one of the early 
sages of our nation&#58; &#34;Run after every little 
good act&#44; and fly from transgression&#59; for one good act 
is the forerunner of another&#44; and one transgression 
produces another.&#34; And of this we may be assured&#44; 
that&#44; no matter how unpleasant ixny good act may ap&#8211; 
pear at first&#44; its repetition will be easier than its first 
accomplishment&#59; and therefore if the beginning is 
once made&#44; we may with more safety look forward 
to a good ending. In the same way the first step in 
crime is the chief&#44; and is the precursor of a long list 
yet to follow&#44; each greater in magnitude&#44; and each 
easier of accomplishment &#40;as far as the will is con&#8211; 
cerned&#41; than the other. If we therefore wish to pre&#8211; 
serve our virtue&#44; we should watch ourselves constant&#8211; 
ly with great care&#44; and withstand every temptation 
which might tend to draw us from the right path. 
And moreover it is necessary that we should fre&#8211; 
quently examine ourselves dispassionately&#44; to discover

if we have erred&#59; and if our investigation should con&#8211; 
vict us as wrong&#44; it is our duty to set about at once 
altering the defects&#44; and not wait till our debt to God 
has become heavy &#59; for who knows if we will ever be 
able to alter&#44; since every day may be our last. But 
if we have gone astray widely from the way marked 
out by God&#44; if indeed in our obduracy we have 
added sin to sin&#44; till we are ripe for punishment&#44; be 
the cause carelessness&#44; pride or temptation &#58; we should 
stop short in our career&#44; as soon as we make the dis&#8211; 
covery&#44; and not endeavour to hide our iniquity be&#8211; 
hind the plausible excuse&#44; that our passions are 
stronger&#44; or our opportunities greater than another&#39;s. 
In refutation to the first plea&#44; or excuse for sin&#44; we 
may answer&#44; that it is not the positive strength of 
an individual&#39;s passions or natural incHnation to sin 
which is the reason of one man&#39;s being better than 
another&#44; but that one has them under better control 
than the other. For if we will watch ourselves and 
check the rising inclinations&#44; we will be able to over&#8211; 
come strong impulses&#44; and we can be virtuous in de&#8211; 
spite of them&#59; and therefore also we find many a one 
with such a temperament always walking humbly 
before God and mindful of his commandments. On 
the other hand sluggish passions and weak inclina&#8211; 
tions may outgrow our strength of combating them&#44; 
if we yield ourselves to their sway&#59; and in the same 
manner we find indolent persons&#44; who never displayed 
any fire&#44; either of genius or activity&#44; acting the parts 
of very wicked men. &#8212; With regard to the second ex&#8211; 
cuse&#44; that our temptations have been great&#44; we may 
remark&#44; that temptations might be a valid excuse&#44; if 
we were not informed as to the extent and nature of 

<pb n="225"/>

CAUSES AND REMEDIES OF SIN. 225 

our duties &#59; but this is not the case &#59; God&#39;s law is 
explicit&#44; and whatever is prohibited there should be 
avoided&#44; as we would avoid destruction and death&#44; 
no matter how great the incentive and opportunity 
for transgression may be. In matters of common 
honesty&#44; no person would think of excusing himself 
for theft&#44; by saying&#44; that he was left in a room where 
he saw treasures of which he could not refrain from 
stealing&#59; and yet in religious and moral misdeeds we 
hear constantly excuses&#44; not the least more reason&#8211; 
able&#44; offered in defence of every species of wrong. 
So will the Sabbath&#8211;breaker tell you&#44; that he measures 
the small amount of worldly gain against the positive 
enactment of the law&#59; the man that gives way to his 
anger and commits an act of violence&#44; that he was 
provoked to do an unlawful deed by the offences of 
another&#59; the disobedient child&#44; that his father asked 
an act of obedience more than he&#44; the child&#44; thought 
consonant with his reason&#59; and lastly&#44; he that for&#8211; 
swears his religion&#44; professes his motives to be worldly 
preferment. And are grounds like these sufficient 
to excuse our transgressing&#61; and what better excuses 
can sinners make &#61; To avoid such a ruinous course&#44; 
we should rend the veil from our soul&#44; expose her 
nakedness&#44; and view her deformity with an unquail&#8211; 
ing eye. We must expect to find ourselves very sin&#8211; 
ful&#44; and we should not endeavour to gloss over half 
of our faults. If now we turn away our eyes from 
our errors&#44; aM imagine ourselves better than we are&#44; 
there is no hope of our ever reforming&#59; but if we 
seriously grapple with the evil&#44; and analy&#39;ze our feel&#8211; 
ings carefully&#44; place our turpitude in its natural hide&#8211; 
ousness before ourselves&#44; we may look forward to the

time when we may be freed. from the burden of our 
sins. To effect a reformation&#44; we should&#44; in the first 
place&#44; after discovering our wrongs&#44; endeavour at once 
to discontinue them&#44; and not leave off by degrees&#44; for 
this would be compromising with our conscience. Let 
the profane scoffer not merely omit abusing those who 
believe&#44; but he must at once think and speak himself 
respectfully of the Deity&#44; and thus prepare the way 
for farther amendment. The same may be said with 
regard to other sins. Having once left off&#39; sinning&#44; 
we should set about a thorough reformation&#44; or in 
other words&#44; a change of conduct&#44; and endeavour to 
act in every way comformably to the law of God&#44; and 
prove in this manner&#44; that the detestation of our crimes 
is inwardly felt&#44; and our renovated love of righteous&#8211; 
ness&#44; sincere and undivided. On former occasions 
we have dwelt at greater length upon the means of 
repentance&#44; such as fasting&#44; prayer and charity&#59; and 
it is therefore merely necessary to refer to them now&#44; 
and to state&#44; that to promote the growth of righteous&#8211; 
ness&#44; we should&#44; after the custom of our ancestors&#44; 
fast with contrition&#44; pray with devotion&#44; and distribute 
charity to the needy&#44; to compensate in as far as lies 
in our power the wrong we have done&#44; or to use the 
words of our ancients&#44; to correct the evils in the sum 
of universal right which we have caused by the un&#8211; 
holiness of our deeds. Now it may be asked&#58; &#34;Who 
should repent &#61; will the great sinner&#39;s repentance be 
available &#61; need the man who formerly was righteous 
repent&#44; or will his prior good&#44; conduct counterbalance 
his present sins&#61;&#34; To these questions we have dis&#8211; 
tinct answers given by the prophets&#44; especially in the 
book of Ezekiel&#44; chap&#44; xviii.&#44; beginning at verse 20&#58; 

<pb n="227"/>

CAUSES AND REMEDIES OF SIN. 227 

&#34;The soul that sinneth&#44; she alone shall die&#59; the 
son shall not help to bear for the iniquity of the 
father&#44; and the father shall not help to bear the in&#8211; 
iquity of the son &#59; the righteousness of the righteous 
shall be upon him&#44; and the wickedness of the wicked 
shall be upon him. &#8212; And the wicked&#44; when he turn&#8211; 
eth away from all his sins which he hath committed&#44; 
and keepeth all my statutes&#44; and executeth justice and 
righteousness&#44; shall surely live&#44; he shall not die.  All 
his transgressions which he hath committed shall not 
be remembered unto him&#59; through his righteousness 
which he hath done shall he live. Have I then the 
least pleasure in the death of the wicked &#61; saith the 
Lord Eternal&#59; ivid not in his turning away from his 
ways that he may live&#61; &#8212; But when the righteous 
turneth away from his righteousness and committeth 
wrong&#44; and doth according to all the abominations 
that the Avicked man doth &#59; shall he live &#61; All his 
righteousness that he hath done&#44; shall not be remem&#8211; 
bered&#59; through his trespass which he hath com&#8211; 
mitted&#44; and through his sin that he hath done&#44; &#8212; 
through them shall he die.&#34; 

And says the prophet farther &#58; 

&#34; Cast away from yourselves all your transgressions&#44; whereby ye 
have transgressed&#44; and make yourselves a new heart and a new 
spirit&#59; for why will ye die&#44; O house of Israel&#61; For I have no 
pleasure in the death of him that deserveth to die&#59; therefore con&#8211; 
vert yourselves and live.&#34; Ezek. xviii. 31&#44; 32.

228 CAUSES AND REMEDIES OF SIN. 

We have in this passage a perfect exposition of the 
various cases&#44; stated to you this day&#44; of righteous men 
relapsing into sin&#44; and it is emphatically stated&#44; that 
none of their good deeds shall be remembered&#44; when 
they become transgressors. If&#44; now&#44; one who once 
loved virtue has yielded himself to vice&#44; he must not 
think to escape punishment &#59; for retribution will be 
awarded to him in the same manner it is to others. 
&#33;N&#34;or must he think that his former good actions will 
save him from becoming wicked&#44; since we are told 
from high authority&#44; and experience proves it&#44; how 
little recollection of former goodness will rescue a 
man from a downward course of evil &#59; and he that 
relies upon his attained eminence is&#44;but too likely to 
fall&#59; and he that looks with pride and disdain upon 
others worse than himself&#44; and feels a self&#8211;exaltation 
unmixed with lowliness&#44; meekness&#44; and gratitude be&#8211; 
fore God&#44; is already far advanced on the road to sin &#59; 
for security and carelessness have destroyed many a 
one. If&#44; therefore&#44; a righteous man should be be&#8211; 
trayed into sin&#44; let him arrest his straying feet at the 
outset&#44; and return at once with prayer and repent&#8211; 
ance. But far better would it be that the first step 
in sin be never taken&#44; and better would it be that we 
never knew what pleasure is given by transgression&#44; 
than that we should feel one moment of remorse and 
compunction. For our pursuit of virtue may be com&#8211; 
pared to the ascent of some slippery and icy moun&#8211; 
tain&#59; we have the strength to toil onward&#44; we have 
the capacity to reach the summit &#59; but if we loiter 
on the way&#44; if we&#44; by carelessness or design&#44; suffer 
our feet to slip&#44; we cannot know where we may be 
able to halt in our descent &#59; and if we even succeed 

<pb n="229"/>

to recover our firm footing by grasping at some shrubs 
that here and there are placed in our way&#44; still we 
have to retrace the same weary route which we had 
already once overcome&#44; when our foot lost its hold. 
And&#44; says the sage&#44; in the name of God &#58; &#34; If thou 
leavest me one day&#44; two days I will forsake thee&#44;&#34; 
meaning&#44; that&#44; as man is bound to make the begin&#8211; 
ning in amendment&#44; he will have to do an increased 
number of holy actions to regain the favour of God 
he has lost. &#8212; If in this way the righteous one too 
requires care and repentance&#44; the wicked on the other 
hand should not despair of hope and pardon. The 
invitation to purify ourselves is held out to all men&#44; 
and no matter how great the sins&#44; we should consider&#44; 
that it is not for us to set limits to God&#39;s kindness. 
&#39;Nov should we say&#44; &#34;We cannot repent&#59;&#34; for we are 
told that we should make ourselves a new heart and 
a new spirit&#44; consequently it is within our power to 
change ourselves&#44; whenever we please. It is only 
obduracy which withholds us&#44; it is only our deafness 
to the aftectionate invitation which is a clog upon our 
reformation. But what do we gain if we persevere 
in sin&#61; only a temporary gratification of our appe&#8211; 
tites&#44; or it may be we succeed in making the world 
believe that we find nothing blamable in our con&#8211; 
duct. And what do we lose thereby&#61; we jeopard 
the everlasting peace of our souls&#44; and incur and con&#8211; 
firm the just indignation of our God whom our pre&#8211; 
tensions cannot deceive. And why should pride pre&#8211; 
vent us from acknowledging to the world that we 
have been wrong&#61; must I persist in violating the 
Sabbath&#44; because I did so once publicly&#61; must I 
nightly resort to the gaming&#8211;house&#44; because I was

once seen there &#61; must my drunkenness be of daily 
recurrence&#44; because I was once drunk &#61; must forbid&#8211; 
den food be daily tasted&#44; because I once transgressed &#61; 
must I become a prowling thief&#44; because I am known 
to have wronged a neighbour once &#61; Surely the ab&#8211; 
surdity of such reasoning is too evident to need a 
refutation &#59; and yet it would appear that daily such 
motives prompt men to sin&#44; or to persevere in sin&#8211; 
ning. How many children have not been permitted 
to enter the covenant&#44; because their parents had once 
foolishly spoken against its necessity&#33; how many in&#8211; 
termixtures with gentiles have taken place&#44; because 
one of a family began to set the example &#33; and how 
many persons publicly violate the holy Sabbath&#44; dis&#8211; 
regard holiness of life&#44; live in incest&#44; indulge in 
drunkenness&#44; love dishonesty&#44; because they cherish 
the evil which others do &#33; Yet&#44; if we only reflect&#44; 
we must clearly see that we are&#44; in thus doing&#44; tread&#8211; 
ing the way of death &#8212; yes&#44; death of tlie soul&#44; perhaps 
too the death of the body. And still there is that 
remedy which the great Father has vouchsafed&#44; it is 
called EEPENTANCE &#8212; a return from the evil&#44; and a re&#8211; 
turn to the good. But&#44; if we come to repent&#44; we 
must not look upon one or another of our crimes 
as more excusable than the other&#59; for the prophet 
teaches&#58; &#34;If the wicked return from all his sins&#44;&#34; 
and thus&#44; not one should be retained&#44; if we truly wish 
to be forgiven. &#8212; If we thus come prepared by re&#8211; 
pentance&#44; if we superadd deeds of virtue&#44; if we ap&#8211; 
proach with an humble faith in God that He will for&#8211; 
give us in his mercy&#58; we may then hope with confi&#8211; 
dence that we will be restored to favour&#44; that we have 
corrected the evil which we had committed. &#8212; When

we have&#44; in this manner&#44; accomplished the desire of 
God&#44; we will willingly again submit to his guidance&#59; 
and if He chastise us then for our former sins&#44; we 
will subject ourselves with resignation to the decree 
which dooms us to suffer&#59; and even should our body 
sink into death&#44; we will glorify the infinite One&#44; who 
has suffered us to live long enough&#44; that we might 
regain his lost favour&#44; and not snatched us hence in 
our sinfulness &#33; 

Brethren &#33; the prophet says in the name of God &#58; 
&#34;I desire not the death of the guilty one&#44; return ye 
and live&#33; &#34; Thus we are warned&#59; but do we heed it&#61; 
Does not the Holy Spirit speak to unwilling ears&#61; 
It was so in ancient days&#44; when the temple fell a sac&#8211; 
rifice to our transgressions&#59; but we have yet been 
spared to glorify God by our conduct. Let us then 
hope&#44; that there are many to whom the warning will 
come like a refreshing shower to quicken into life the 
seeds of piety which have long lain dormant. This 
season is emphatically called that of repentance &#59; may 
it then be indeed accomplished that many a repentant 
heart will &#8211;seek the Lord and his righteousness&#44; and 
return to Him in sincerity and love&#59; so that when the 
coming Day of Forgiveness of sin closes&#44; many a 
newly accepted child of God may cry out in the con&#8211; 
gregation of fhe faithful&#44; in the fulness of faith &#58; &#39; The 
Lord is the God&#44; his kingdom will endure for ever &#59; 
He is our God&#44; and there is none besides Him.&#34; 

O Lord God&#33; shower upon us thy blessings&#44; and 
extend over us thy protecting arm. Forgive us our 
trespasses and purity us from our iniquities&#44; and do 
not destroy us utterly according to thy mercy&#59; and do

OUR God and Creator&#33; we thy people are here 
assembled this day to offer up to Thee the grateful 
thanks of our hearts for the many favours which we 
have received from thy bounty. When the world 
was sunk in darkness. Thou calledst forth thy servant 
Abraham to shine like the light of the bright beacon 
on the bosom of the trackless ocean. Amidst idola&#8211; 
trous nations Thou didst preserve his son and his 
grandson&#44; till people ignorant of thy worship learned 
to adore thy name. When Jacob went down to 
Egypt to fulfil his destiny and the destiny of his house&#44;

in the land of the sons of Mitzraim&#58; thy glory went 
thither with him&#44; and he did not leave this earth&#44; till 
his eyes had foreseen thy kingdom&#44; that is to spread 
over all flesh. His children Thou didst not forsake &#59; 
and when they had&#44; unto the fourth generation&#44; en&#8211; 
dured the oppression of the princes of Noph&#44; Thou 
sentest thy servant Moses to work great things in thy 
name&#59; and Pharaoh acknowledged thy almighty 
power&#44; O Lord &#33; and let thy children go free from 
hondage&#59; and they went forth to follow thy guidance 
in the howling wilderness. There&#44; Thou gavest them 
water out of the arid rock&#44; .and from heaven Thou be&#8211; 
stowedst on them&#44; in abundance&#44; bread never before 
tasted by men. But their souls too Thou didst disin&#8211; 
thral. Thou banishedst the gloom of superstition and 
false worship from their minds&#44; and yon favoured 
Sinai witnessed thy descent to speak nnto thy people&#44; 
and to command them the path they should follow in 
serving Thee. But still thy goodness did not end 
here&#59; and ever hast Thou been the Guardian of Israel&#59; 
ever hast Thou watched over us&#44; that we have not 
been cut off&#39;&#44; and that the burden of misfortune has 
not crushed us. O do Thou then&#44; in thy mercy&#44; con&#8211; 
tinue to bless us&#44; to preserve us&#44; and to protect us &#59; 
and if not for&#34; our sakes&#44; if our sins are too great&#44; if 
our transgressions cry aloud for retribution&#44; do it 
for the sake of thy abundant mercies&#44; and for the sake 
of the covenant Thou didst make with our ancestors&#44; 
when Thou chosest theni as thy own people and treas&#8211;

popularity&#44; he would assuredly never undertake to 
grapple with the follies of the age&#44; which he&#44; by his 
own individual exertions&#44; certainly cannot hope to 
overcome. Nothing but ill&#8211;will&#44; perhaps even hatred&#44; 
perhaps taunts&#44; can be his reward from those whose 
faults he may unwittingly expose&#44; and very many 
others will think that remarks which may wound 
the self&#8211;love of any class of his hearers had better 
be omitted. Besides this&#44; no sooner does any one 
presume to teach&#44; than the tongue of detraction is 
busy with his character&#44; and even the wicked will 
search for trifles&#44; for small foibles&#44; magnify them by 
the Tight of envy and malice&#44; and declare that one 
so bad as he is&#44; has no right to presume to correct 
others equally good and virtuous with himself. Add 
to this&#44; that words will rarely&#39; eftect reformation&#44; at 
least an immediate one&#44; in those for whose improve&#8211; 
ment he is anxious&#44; and the feeling of mortification 
which the generally sensitive philanthropist experi&#8211; 
ences at seeing his advice contemned &#58; and any one 
can easily determine&#44; that he&#44; who lifts up the voice 
of warning to his fellow&#8211;men&#44; has undertaken not an 
enviable task. Yet it is necessary that there should 
be guides to show the way &#8212; sentinels to warn of the 
coming storm &#8212; leaders to commence ever the work 
of reformation &#59; and for the people in general it is 
requisite that they should look with respect upon 
their teachers&#44; and listen with deference to the ad&#8211; 
vice which they may oiFer in accordance with the 
law of God. Let no one think&#44; that the teacher can 
take any pleasure in exposing faults &#40;for he that 
would be guilty of such an odious outrage deserves 
not to be called to the chair of instruction in Israel&#41;&#44;

but that he is moved by a love towards his fellow&#8211; 
men to exhort them in time to escape from the ven&#8211; 
geance of the outraged covenant&#44; which will be exe&#8211; 
cuted on the hardened sinner who transgresseth and 
repenteth not. Is not the teacher himself one of 
the people &#61; is not their glory his glory &#61; is not their 
shame his shame &#61; &#8212; Why then should he be blamed 
when honest truth compels him to speak against 
the misdeeds which he sees wrought around him&#44; 
by which right is neglected &#8212; religion slighted &#8212; evil 
practised &#8212; and wickedness fostered&#61; &#8212; The same al&#8211; 
ready happened to Jeremiah&#44; whose misfortune it 
was to live in wicked times&#44; when the law of God 
had been almost forgotten&#44; and when the last re&#8211; 
mains of our national glory were fast sinking to 
decay. He often had announced the punishment 
that would inevitably follow&#44; and as a recompense 
for his faithfulness the powerful sinners of those 
days visited him&#44; the humble prophet&#44; with unmer&#8211; 
ited persecution. I must refer you to the twentieth 
chapter of this book&#44; where you can read the details&#44; 
and where also you will find the almost surprising 
fact that Jeremiah was an unwilling agent&#44; equally 
so with Moses in the time of Pharaoh&#44; mistrusting&#44; 
like the great prophet&#44; his power to arrest the evil&#44; 
which to detiounce he was sent. He says&#44; speaking 
to God &#58; &#34; Thou didst persuade me&#44; Lord &#33; and I 
was persuaded&#59; Thou laidst thy hand strongly on 
me&#44; and didst prevail &#59; I am laughed at all the time&#44; 
every one mocketh me. For as often as I speak&#44; 
must I cry out&#44; violence and wasting must I pro&#8211; 
claim &#59; because the word of the Lord is become unto 
me a disorrace&#44; and a derision all the time. And I

thought&#44; I will not make mention of Him&#44; and I will 
not speak any more in his name. But it became in 
my heart as a burning fire&#44; enclosed within my bones&#44; 
and I was weary with enduring&#44; and I could not over&#8211; 
come it.&#34; Here we see how gladly the prophet would 
have refrained from obtruding his advice upon the un&#8211; 
willing ears of the multitude&#44; knowing that the more 
he spoke in the name of the Lord&#44; the more he would 
find himself despised and hated. But the word would 
not be thus restrained&#44; the message of which he was 
full could not thus be suppressed&#44; and he felt as though 
a burning fire was consuming his heart and wasting 
his bones&#44; until he had spread the message of Heaven 
before the people&#44; and had cried it aloud in their ears&#44; 
so that even unwilling they were compelled to hear. 
&#8212; now as an humble and unworthy follower of the 
great ones of the former days&#44; with powers far in&#8211; 
ferior beneath the least on their list&#44; with a perfect 
consciousness that much may be alleged against my&#8211; 
self&#44; with a full knowledge that I have sinned as 
others have sinned&#44; I think it my solemn duty to in&#8211; 
veigh against the many derelictions which I daily 
see practised by the remnant of Israel. I know full 
well&#44; as well as any one can inform me&#44; that in all 
likelihood but few will listen with patience to any 
thing I have to say&#44; fewer yet will apply the moral 
to themselves&#44; and fewer still will leave the place of 
worship amended in heart and resolved to alter their 
doings&#59; but nevertheless I must discharge what I 
consider my duty&#44; let the result be what it may &#59; per&#8211; 
haps the heart of one may suddenly feel and acknowl&#8211; 
edge the power of the Lord&#44; and who knows but that 
one sheep may return to the fold of the great Shep&#8211;

herd&#44; when it hears that it has strayed in its wander&#8211; 
ings&#44; and that the return way is not impeded by ob&#8211; 
stacles which cannot be surmounted. 

Brethren &#33; the painful truth must force itself upon 
the conviction of every one who thinks&#44; that the pres&#8211; 
ent age is not one of religion&#44; but that&#44; on the con&#8211; 
trary&#44; the duties which the law demands are daily 
more and more neglected. &#8212; Why is this &#61; why is the 
house of God empty&#61; why are the Sabbaths .and fes&#8211; 
tivals neglected &#61; why do those fall off who formerly 
were true and steadfast &#61; why does the father show 
the evil example to his sons&#44; and the mother to her 
daughters&#61; It is&#44; because the age has learned to 
love gain more than the law&#44; riches more than vir&#8211; 
tue&#44; the perishable more than the everlasting&#44; &#8212; in a 
word&#44; to love the outward world more than the Al&#8211; 
mighty God&#33; But why should we of the present 
day be so much more sedulous in the pursuit of 
wealth&#44; than were our forefathers&#61; have we any claim 
to a longer duration of life than they had &#61; It may&#44; 
indeed&#44; be freely conceded&#44; that the present age has 
made wonderful advances in the nseful sciences&#44; in 
refinement and luxury&#59; all the elegancies of life are 
now more appreciated and more accessible than they 
were before eur days &#59; and a general spirit of inquiry&#44; 
for good or&#39; for evil&#44; is spread abroad&#44; before which 
error and fanaticism will ere long have to retire. All 
this the moralist will cheerfully acknowledge &#59; but he 
will instance it as an additional motive for gratitude 
to the Supreme Ruler&#44; for having showered down so 
many more blessings on us than on our fathers. But 
how do the worldly repay this kindness &#33; Instead of 
repairing to the house of God to return their thanks

to tlie Dispenser of all good&#44; tlieir feet do but seldom 
seek the sacred threshold&#58; and if they do go&#44; they 
arrive at so late an hour&#44; as to disturb by their en&#8211; 
trance the assembled worshippers &#59; and when there&#44; 
their indecorous behaviour&#44; their inattention&#44; their 
conversation where silence should reign&#44; their looks 
of disdain&#44; as though they honoured the worship by 
their presence&#44; &#8212; all prove that their hearts are not 
engaged in the divine service&#44; and that tlieir attend&#8211; 
ance for the once or twice a year is but a mere out&#8211; 
ward show&#44; a display more of their adherence to re&#8211; 
ligion than a sincerely&#8211; felt devotion. And when do 
many of these persons come &#61; on the usual day of the 
weekly rest&#61; on a festival&#44; when their business might 
sufler by their absence &#61; Xo &#8212; only on such days 
when their worldly affairs cannot be attended to&#44; 
when the laws of men forbid work to be done &#59; but 
at other times the world is more loved than God&#44; 
and the courts of his holy house are left untrodden 
of their feet. And do reasoninsj men call this devo&#8211; 
tion &#61; do Israelites call this worshipping the God of 
their fathers &#61; Wo&#44; wo&#44; on the sinning generation&#33; 
this is mockery &#33; this is profanation &#33; not such is the 
service which the Lord desires&#44; not such the servants. 
For alreadv aijainst the sinners of his own day did 
Isaiah testity &#40;i. 10&#8211;13&#41; &#58; &#34; Hear ye the word of the 
Lord&#44; chiefs of Sodom&#44; hearken to the instruction of 
our God&#44; people of Gomorrah. To what purpose 
serveth me the mass of your sacrifices&#61; saith the 
Lord&#44; I am sated with the burnt&#8211;offerings of rams&#44; 
and the fat of fatlings&#44; and the blood of steers&#44; of 
lambs&#44; and of wethers&#44; I desire not. When you 
come to be seen in my presence &#8212; who asketh this

THE SPIRIT OF THE AGE. 239 

at your hands to tread down my courts &#61; Bring no 
more the offering of falsehood&#44; it is to me incense 
of abomination &#8212; new&#8211;moons&#44; Sabbaths&#44; festivals &#8212; I 
cannot endure misdeeds with festive gathering.&#34; 
From this it will clearly appear how odious is to 
God that pretended holiness&#44; where the outward 
conformity does not find a responding feeling in the 
soul&#59; and no matter how much soever we have suc&#8211; 
ceeded in glossing over our faults&#44; no matter how 
much polishing we have applied to the unsightly 
surface&#58; we may be perfectly assured&#44; that the in&#8211; 
ward corruption will not escape Ilim to whom all is 
known. No&#44; brethren&#44; this is not the way which 
can be pleasing to our heavenly Father&#59; if we are 
bad&#44; if we are sinners&#44; do not let us figure in our 
minds an image of excellence and apply it to our&#8211; 
selves&#59; if we have transgressed the law let us not&#44; 
in the name of justice&#44; lay claim to the title of pious 
and virtuous men &#59; for in this way we would add to 
our other sins the crime of insulting the Holy Spirit&#44; 
which we yet cannot deceive. As well might an 
Israelite sit down to a table covered with forbidden 
food and ask God&#39;s blessing upon the sinful meal &#33; 
Would such worship not be better omitted&#61; And 
yet this is the spirit of our age as it was of Isaiah&#39;s&#44; 
that on high occasions we now and then show our 
faces in God&#39;s temple&#44; we bring our sacrifice&#44; we 
display a certain zeal and energy for a moment&#44; and 
imagine that in this way we have satisfied our con&#8211; 
science&#59; but no sooner does interest call&#44; no sooner 
become crime and sin a little more profitable than 
virtue and jjiety&#44; than we forsake the standard of the 
Lord&#44; &#39; we see the thief&#44;&#34; to use the words of Scrip&#8211;

tiire&#44; &#34; and run after him&#44; and have our portion with 
adulterers.&#34; And do we not see hourly the bitter 
fruits of this mockery of religion&#61; Where is the 
wholesome discipline which parents should exercise 
over their children &#61; it is sacrificed to interest &#59; the 
father fears that his son may not become great enough 
and rich enough&#59; and straightway he permits him&#44; 
nay teaches and in a measure compels him&#44; to dese&#8211; 
crate the Sabbath&#8211;day&#44; whilst he perhaps himself 
makes his appearance at the. Synagogue&#44; and even 
pretends to direct and lead others. &#8212; But&#44; brethren&#44; 
I must put it to your own conscience to answer the 
question without self&#8211;love or self&#8211;deception&#44; whether 
it is really necessary for the advancement of your 
children&#44; that religion should be so totally neglected&#61; 
whether it is absolutely requisite that your offspring 
should be taught by you to despise God&#39;s law &#61; &#8212; In 
yon Decalogue which surmounts our ark where the 
law is kept&#44; in yon Decalogue which the Lord gave 
to his people for their government&#44; it is written &#58; 
&#34; Thou shalt honour thy father and thy mother&#44;&#34; 
and you are right in exacting implicit obedience 
from your children&#44; in accordance with the law of 
God. But the same Decalogue also teaches &#58; &#34; Re&#8211; 
member the Sabbath&#44;&#34; and this you imagine may be 
safely left unenforced. Are you so blind as not to 
see&#44; that you cannot obtain your children&#39;s esteem&#44; 
if you show them the example&#44; or permit them to 
neglect this precept&#61; Will not the child reason 
thus &#58; &#39;&#39; The obedience I owe my parents and to the 
law of God rest upon the same foundation&#44; and if 
one is unnecessary&#44; the other is equally so.&#34; But 
you may perhaps say&#44; that this reasoning is never

resorted to&#59; nevertheless&#44; experience may be safely 
appealed to&#44; to prove&#44; that filial obedience has much 
deteriorated under the shameful want of religious 
education from which so many of the rising genera&#8211; 
tion suffer. Formerly the father spoke&#44; and no one 
of his family would contradict him &#59; but now&#44; the son 
rises in judgment against the father&#44; and the daugh&#8211; 
ter against the mother&#59; and that deference to pa&#8211;
rental authority in general&#44; and that respect for old 
age&#44; which were once so becoming in youth&#44; are&#44; 
alas &#33; fast wearing away among us &#59; and even the 
union of families and the unanimity of interest and 
wishes are disappearing before the selfish pursuits of 
the individual members of the household. I may&#44; 
perhaps&#44; be charged with overdrawing the picture&#44; 
and of adding fictitious traits to my portrait &#59; but I 
believe that I have underrated the truth&#44; and that 
the evil is yet greater than I have stated. And why 
is it so &#61; because the children are not early taught to 
love God above all things&#44; and that his favour is to be 
prized more than riches &#59; and if even it should have 
been taught in infancy&#44; no sooner is the boy old 
enough to aspire to a profession&#44; or to embark in 
trade&#44; than he is flatly told&#44; that now&#44; as he has to 
make his living&#44; he may neglect the Sabbath&#44; and 
eat whatever &#8211;is put before him&#59; it is his business to 
get along in the world&#44; but not to be stopped by 
speculative opinions. I know well enough&#44; that 
there are honourable exceptions to this almost uni&#8211; 
versal degeneracy&#59; but too many&#44; alas &#33; do as I have 
represented it &#59; and the consequences may easily be 
calculated on with certainty&#58; the child grows up 
without any religion whatever&#44; he neither fears God&#44;

for that his parents have not taught him&#44; and he 
honours not these&#44; because he cannot see from his 
own reasoning that they deserve it from him. And 
when such a one is asked&#44; why he is not religious&#44; 
he answers&#44; that he does know little or nothing about 
it&#44; not having had any instruction and but little of 
example before him&#44; and he blames his parents for 
not educating him to be a servant of the Lord. It 
is indeed true&#44; that an excuse of this kind is not 
enough to justify a want of religion in any one&#59; 
since the means of self&#8211;education are at present so 
plentifully scattered about&#44; that whoever wishes it 
can learn&#44; and there are enough righteous yet left 
whose example may safely be followed. But this 
does in nowise do away with the blame attachable to 
parents and guardians for the entire want of&#44; or the 
little care devoted to a religious domestic education &#59; 
for no matter how much a child may learn at school&#44; 
when removed from his parents&#39; eye&#44; it is the do&#8211; 
mestic fireside nevertheless&#44; where the word of God 
should be made dear to him. For what does the 
Bible teach &#61; &#39; And thou shalt teach them &#40;the 
words of God&#41; diligently unto thy children&#44; and thou 
shalt speak of them&#44; when thou sittest in thy house&#44; 
when thou walkest by the way&#44; when thou liest 
down&#44; and when thou risest up.&#34; I may freely leave 
it to the reflection of my auditors to determine&#44; 
whether this is their mode of doing&#44; whether they 
make the law of God lovely in their children&#39;s eyes&#44; 
whether they show them by their example&#44; no less 
than by precept&#44; the way they ought to go. But&#44; 
alas &#33; how many parents are deficient in this respect &#33; 
how much of frivolity&#44; how much of trifling&#44; do the 

<pb n="243"/>

THE SPIRIT OF THE AGE. 243 

children see from their elders &#33; haw anxiously are 
the pursuits of pleasure and of gain persevered in&#44; 
whilst religion lies cast off in a corner&#44; neglected 
and unheeded &#33; The child soon perceives that its 
parents labour on the Sabbath&#44; that they do not go 
to the place of worship even if the weather be in&#8211; 
viting&#44; but that the dancing&#8211;rooms&#44; the concert&#8211; 
halls and the theatres&#44; are crowded even amidst the 
stifling heats of summer and the terrific storms of win&#8211; 
ter &#58; in short&#44; the child sees the house of God empty&#44; 
and the resorts of pleasure thronged to overflowing. 
Suppose now&#44; that an innocent boy&#44; in the simplicity 
of his heart&#44; should ask his father&#44; why he goes not 
to the Synagogue whither he himself had been sent 
in the company of an esteemed relative&#61; or&#44; sup&#8211; 
pose that a daughter should demand of her mother 
the reason for her being prohibited from doing her 
little playful work&#44; while the parents are engaged 
in the pursuit of their usual avocation &#58; &#8212; I ask&#44; what 
must be the parents&#39; feelings &#61; or how can they hope 
that their children should be better than themselves&#44; 
if shame seals their lips&#44; or if such exaMiples are per&#8211; 
petually exhibited&#61; 

And still some parents desire to be called Israel&#8211; 
ites&#44; and are willing to suffer an imputation of a 
disregard of&#42; religion to be fastened on them. Vain 
delusion&#33; the substance is yielded&#44; and the shadow 
grasped &#33; And their children they will not permit&#44; 
as is but just and proper&#44; to mingle in marriage with 
other nations &#33; But how can this be prevented by the 
system of education so generally pursued &#61; For cor&#8211; 
rect religious knowledge is not at all&#44; or at best but 
imperfectly&#44; imparted&#44; and they must see&#44; that to

their elders at least worldly interest is the paramount 
good&#59; how can it then he expected of them&#44; that they 
should abstain from following their perverted notions 
of right&#44; when inclination&#44; passion&#44; and interest call&#44; 
merely to gratify a parent&#39;s whim &#61; &#8212; And even sup&#8211; 
pose that the rising generation should be&#44; like the pres&#8211; 
ent one&#44; vacillating between the service of pleasure and 
money on the one&#44; and that of God on the other hand&#44; 
what benefit to piety and true morality can thereby 
accrue &#61; But even this doubtful state can hardly be 
expected to continue&#44; if things are not changed &#59; for 
daily more and more will fall off&#44; our number already 
too small&#44; especially in this favoured country&#44; will be 
gradually diminished by apostacy&#44; by intermarriage&#44; 
and by death &#59; and&#44; to speak in human probability&#44; 
in less than the age of one man the name of Israelite 
will hardly be known in this land&#44; save as an object 
of memory&#44; to be referred to as something that has 
been. I do not say that this will be the actual result&#44; 
but only that the misconduct of our people tends 
towards it. &#8212; For lift up your eyes&#44; you who are in the 
habit of attending in this house to adore the God 
of your fathers&#44; and see how few young men resort 
hither&#44; of how many families not even one attends 
on the Sabbath&#44; how many middle&#8211;aged persons are 
known to follow their pursuits on the holy day&#44; and 
how many children are put to work on the day which 
God ordained should be observed&#44; even by the stran&#8211; 
ger and the slave&#44; nay&#44; the ox and the ass &#8212; see how 
many children are without the means of being in&#8211; 
formed of their eternal welfare&#44; when the fault might 
easily be remedied by a concerted action &#58; I say&#44; view 
all this&#44; as I have done&#44; with anguish&#44; with sorrow&#44;

with regret&#44; and with shame at such degeneracy of 
Israel&#44; and then blame the philanthropist&#44; if you can&#44; 
when he declares that our people are hastening along 
the downward path of ruin and destruction. It is 
useless to deny it&#44; that we have fallen upon evil days&#59; 
for but rarely has the religion of God been so much 
neglected as it now is&#44; and the result thereof will be 
dreadful indeed if the evil is not speedily arrested. 
We flatter ourselves occasionally with the reflection&#44; 
that we must needs be better than our forefathers&#59; 
for they worshipped idols&#44; which we do not. &#8212; Admit&#8211; 
ted&#59; but have we not our idols too&#61; They indeed 
worshipped images&#44; the works of their own hands&#59; 
they only however wanted to imitate their neigh&#8211; 
bours&#44; thev wanted to be rid of the burden of the 
law&#44; they did not wish to serve God&#44; that they might 
be allowed to drink wine out of basins&#44; wallow in 
forbidden luxuries&#44; profane the Sabbath&#44; and follow 
the evil desires of their hearts. For we read in the 
xxviii chapt. of Isaiah&#44; how the people of his day had 
become corrupt&#44; by following pleasure and gluttony 
and neglecting the law&#44; and they fancied&#44; to use the 
prophet&#39;s words&#58; &#34;We have made a covenant with 
death&#44; and with the grave we have made a contract&#44; 
the overflowing stream when it passed will not come 
over us&#59; for. we have made lies our protection&#44; and 
with falsehood we cover ourselves.&#34; They thus im&#8211; 
agined&#44; that whatever evil might pass over the world 
would not come to them&#44; they were in their own no&#8211; 
tions amply secured in their doings&#44; although they 
left&#8211;unminded the law of their God. &#8212; In the same 
manner we also have our idols&#44; if not precisely stocks 
and stones&#44; certainly those having equally pernicious

consequences. Our worship of the present day&#44; as 
indicated ah&#39;eady&#44; is the pursuit of pleasure and 
gain. Do we not sacrifice to them all that we hold 
dear&#61; the peace of our own souls&#44; the welfare of 
the community&#44; and the moral elevation of our chil&#8211; 
dren&#61; Do we not also neglect the law of God&#61; 
Do we not look upon the Sabbath&#8211;hreaker with per&#8211; 
fect complaisance&#61; Do we not swallow the things 
which God has declared unclean&#61; Do we not seek 
riches as the thing most to be desired&#61; Do not men 
spend day after day&#44; week after week&#44; month after 
month&#44; in one constant round of unceasing exertions 
to obtain a larger portion of their idol&#61; And what 
at last is the great advantage in being so immensely 
rich&#61; Suppose your gold is too much to be counted 
&#8212; suppose your ships cover every ocean &#8212; suppose 
you have possessions in all parts of the world &#8212; have 
you thereby arranged your covenant with death&#61; 
will the grave not ere long claim its own&#44; and en&#8211; 
close your body within the dark gloomy dwelling&#61; 
And even before this period arrives&#44; may not the 
sweeping stream &#8212; the devouring flame &#8212; the destroy&#8211; 
ing storm &#8212; the vicissitudes of trade &#8212; carry off the 
idol you so ardently love &#61; And then you will call 
down maledictions on your own head&#44; for having neg&#8211; 
lected those interests which neither the stream&#44; nor 
the fire&#44; nor the storm can injure&#44; the peace everlast&#8211; 
ing&#44; the treasury of virtue&#44; which can be obtained 
only by serving God. 

But in the very pursuit of wealth there is at all 
times something so heartless&#44; that the man of feel&#8211; 
ing&#44; even if we leave religion totally out of view&#44; 
ought to shrink from it as he would from destruc&#8211;

tion. Those who are striving to outdo their neigh&#8211; 
bours&#44; often resort to such means to oppress the less 
cunning&#44; that many a one whom the laws cannot 
punish for a positive infringement of right&#44; is yet so 
guilty in moral equity&#44; that he is scarcely more hon&#8211; 
est than a highway robber. Many a one is attended 
by menials&#44; who has acquired his gain by under&#8211; 
handed trickery. The world knows perhaps nothing 
of the knavery of such people&#59; they are perhaps 
called honest&#44; upright&#44; honourable&#44; and worthy mem&#8211; 
bers of the community&#59; but who with the smallest 
portion of humanity would wish to have by fraud 
sent a husband to an early grave&#44; and turned his 
widow and children adrift to gain a pittance by daily 
labour&#44; reduced from affluence to poverty&#61; Who 
would like to live in a palace&#44; the very stones of 
which are cemented&#44; so to say&#44; by the tears of a 
ruined partner&#44; or of a defrauded public who con&#8211; 
fided in his honesty&#44; but found themselves outwitted 
and overreached by superior address&#44; without being 
able to punish the wrong they deeply feel&#44; but can&#8211; 
not expose &#61; &#8212; If you now do bow to such idols&#44; are 
you less idolaters than were the Israelites of old &#61; If 
you forget justice &#8212; love &#8212; good&#8211;fellowship &#8212; religion 
&#8212; kindred &#8212; friends &#8212; and God&#44; merely to obtain gold&#44; 
which avails nothing in the grave &#58; are you not cher&#8211; 
ishing a false worship &#61; &#8212; And if you yourselves think 
such pursuits unworthy of yourselves &#8212; if you believe 
yourselves bound to love and worship our Father in 
heaven beyond any thing that exists &#8212; how can you 
wish your children and those intrusted to your care 
to do what you think evil&#61; how can you teach&#44; or 
even permit them&#44; to slight the religion in which we

all were born&#61; Is it reasonable&#44; that you can be just&#8211; 
ified in inducing them to depart from those duties&#44; 
which you yourselves look upon as necessary to your 
happiness &#61; 

And in the same degree as the pursuit of gain is 
injurious to&#8211; the finer moral perceptions&#44; we may as&#8211; 
sert&#44; that&#44; without doubt&#44; every one who has had any 
experience&#44; must often have felt how unsatisfactory 
are the enjoyments of pleasure and the possession of 
riches. We think we should be extremely happy to 
see something which we hear highly spoken of&#44; to 
hear a celebrated singer&#44; to taste a particular food &#59; 
but no sooner has experience come&#44; than we despise 
the bauble that allured us. We fancy that the pos&#8211; 
session of a given sum would satisfy all our reasonable 
desires &#59; God blesses us&#44; and the wish is obtained &#59; 
but&#44; as if by magic&#44; another and a larger boon is at 
once coveted&#44; and when this is got&#44; more and more 
will be thirsted for to still the yet unquenched desire 
for gold &#58; just like a spoiled child that cries for a rat&#8211; 
tle or some other toy which&#44; when obtained&#44; it breaks 
wantonly after being delighted with it for a brief 
space&#44; and now it cries for a handsomer and more 
valuable plaything. &#8212; Virtues on the contrary are 
never cloying&#44; never despised when once acquired&#59; 
and it may safely be asserted&#44; that few would take 
the money back which they liave expended in charity&#44; 
even if it were ofiered to them&#44; with an understand&#8211; 
ing that every merit of the gift should thus be can&#8211; 
celled &#59; for there is so much holiness in rectitude and 
virtue&#44; that hardened indeed must be that sinner who 
could part with the least of his acquired mental and 
spiritual riches.

It was said in the commencement of our subject&#44; 
that we had no more right to neglect religion than 
our fathers had before us. Very few indeed there 
are who would deny this in theory &#59; yet how many 
deny it in practice&#44; nay even in words &#33; We thus 
hear it often alleged&#44; that our fathers were ignorant&#44; 
but that we in a more enlightened age should be above 
their prejudices. Now&#44; no one will gainsay the evi&#8211; 
dent fact that this age has made improvements&#44; won&#8211; 
derful improvements&#44; if you will&#44; upon the discoveries 
of former periods &#59; but it is utterly denied&#44; that in 
moral sciences the smallest advance&#8211; has been achieved&#44; 
simply because it is impracticable. The man who 
builds a steam&#8211;engine&#44; which travels through an en&#8211; 
tire degree of latitude in one brief hour&#44; so as almost 
to annihilate time and space&#44; has thereby conceived 
no stronger or better notions of God&#44; and of the ma&#8211; 
ture of his Maker&#44; than the laborious farmer who 
drives his ox&#8211;cart&#44; at a rate perhaps sixty times slower. 
There is no connexion whatever between the outward 
and the inward world&#44; any more than that&#44; if new 
benefits are vouchsafed through inventions and im&#8211; 
provements to mankind&#44; more gratitude should be 
shown to the Giver of wisdom&#44; and a greater prompt&#8211; 
ness displayed to engage in his service. What would 
a human master think&#44; if his servants for a few pen&#8211; 
nies of daily wages would toil from morning till night&#44; 
but as soon as he gave them a bag of silver for their 
pay&#44; they should simultaneously refuse doing any 
work whatever&#44; or at least no more than they might 
deem enough&#61; &#8212; What would any one call it&#44; but 
sheer ingratitude &#61; &#8212; And yet we act so towards God&#33; 
When the name of Jew was a passport to ill&#8211;treat&#8211;

ment &#59; when we were oppressed in the whole world &#59; 
when many tears and few joys were our lot&#44; we were 
cheerful&#44; willing&#44; servants to our God. The world 
then admired our constancy&#44; our devoted heroism. 
But now enlargement has heen given to us&#44; persecu&#8211; 
tion for opinion&#39;s sake is no longer the fashion&#44; and 
especially in this land we can worship God without 
let or hindrance&#44; we here have a perfect equality with 
the other inhabitants &#58; yet here it is&#44; where our re&#8211; 
ligion is the most neglected&#44; where we have truly suc&#8211; 
ceeded in making our name a byword for careless&#8211; 
ness and neglect of our glorious hope. When pun&#8211; 
ished we were good&#44; when free we are wicked. &#8212; Is 
that the sri&#39;atitude which we are to offer to our Father 
and heavenly Master &#61; Is it thus we are to celebrate 
the Passover and our redemption from slavery &#61; Is 
it ijius that we can hope for a continuation of the di&#8211; 
vine favour&#61; Certainly not&#44; and indeed &#33; indeed &#33; we 
may justly fear that ere long the weight of God&#39;s ven&#8211; 
geance will fall heavily upon us who are guilty of 
sinning against his just decrees. For we imitate the 
vices of the gentiles&#44; but neglect their virtues. They 
pursue gain and pleasure&#44; and we do likewise. But 
they devote money to public worship &#59; they establish 
schools for the education of their poor &#59; they hasten 
to their churches &#59; they honour the teachers of their 
religion &#59; they&#44; many of them at least&#44; try to serve 
God&#44; although in some respects erroneously &#59; but we 
are backward in supporting the worship of olden 
days &#59; we hardly think&#44; that there are poor who too 
ought to partake of an education tbat they might 
learn to fear the Lord&#59; we stay away for months 
from the holy but humble Synagogue &#59; we honour

not those in whose mouths the law of God dwells &#59; 
and we cannot devote the necessary time to serve 
our Maker &#8212; and 3&#39;et we alone have the true law to 
guide our erring footsteps. &#8212; Is this to last for ever&#61; 
Is this indifference to have no end&#61; Is there never 
to be harmony among us to effect jointly measures 
for public benefit &#61; How long shall the spectacle be 
witnessed&#44; that the good which one proposes is to be 
thwarted by the folly of another&#59; and that the good 
of our scattered congregations is to be lost sight of&#44; 
because those whose business it is will not meet and 
discuss in friendship and concert the necessary meas&#8211; 
ures &#61; &#8212; Believe me&#44; brethren&#44; that there exists a 
great mass of evil &#59; hut it can be removed&#44; when once 
we are anxious to effect a reformation&#44; and when we 
are truly conscious of our errors. &#8212; Repentance and 
changes&#44; even great ones&#44; are within the compass of 
probability&#44; and of this too the Bible speaks. A re&#8211; 
markable instance is found in the king Josiah&#44; as we 
read in the HajAtorah of to&#8211;day. His father and 
grandfather had been excessively sinful&#44; and their 
abominations had filled the land with wickedness. 
Josiah was very young when he became king&#59; but 
no sooner was he made conscious of the sins he was 
unwittingly committing&#44; than he returned in truth to 
the Lord&#44; apd did&#44; not like Pharaoh of Egypt&#44; who 
spoke&#44; &#34;AYho is the Lord&#61;&#34; and who refused to obey 
the prophet&#39;s mandate to let Israel go free&#44; but like 
his ancestor David&#44; who submitted to the decree of 
God whom he had offended. The Passover in com&#8211; 
memoration of the Exodus had for years been neg&#8211; 
lected &#59; hut now Josiah restored it in all its former 
splendour&#44; and he purified the land of the images 

<pb n="252"/>

which filled it. &#8212; Of him too it is said&#44; 2 Kings xxiii. 
25&#58; 

&#34;And like him there was before him no king&#44; who returned unto 
the Lord with all his heart&#44; with all his soul&#44; and with all his might&#44; 
according to the law of Moses&#44; and after him arose none other.&#34; 

Here we see that a son of a wicked king&#44; and who 
surely did not lack those who would have ministered 
to his vices&#44; was truly repentant and followed the 
law. Let such an example riot he lost upon us. 
True&#44; the spirit of the age is avarice &#58; let us&#44; who are 
of the house of Israel&#44; resist it &#59; let us in our endeav&#8211; 
our to obtain a living not overstep the legitimate 
hounds&#59; and if riches should be found unattainable 
with a strict adherence to the law&#44; then let us prefer 
to be poor&#44; let us then enrich our souls though we be 
humble. Thus many of our forefathers became the 
great ones of the earth &#59; thus they earned for them&#8211; 
selves an imperishable fame&#44; better far than&#44; gold and 
silver &#59; and thus too can we all arrive at that glorious 
state&#44; that we can depart this life and leave not one 
behind to curse our name&#44; and be assured&#44; that there 
will be many who will honour our memory and bless 
the day that we were permitted to see the light of the 
world. 

Do Thou&#44; our Father &#33; grant us thy salvation&#44; 
and remove from our bosom the heart of stone&#44; and 
give us the heart of flesh which Thou hast promised &#59;

No. I. 

OUR God and Lord &#33; through the mouth of thy 
prophets Thou hast promised hope and salvation to 
thy people&#44; and hast announced unto them&#44; that they 
should ever find in Thee protection and salvation. 
Do Thou&#44; therefore&#44; now display over us thy almighty 
power&#44; and manifest towards us thy wondrous deeds&#44; 
that the gentile may not say&#44; &#34; AVhere is their God &#61;&#34; 
But let them see&#44; and let them feel&#44; that oppress and 
deride thy children&#44; that Thou art the Lord&#44; and that 
thy reign extends from the beginning to the consum&#8211; 
mation of all created things&#44; and that for ever and ever 
Thou art God. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

Often&#44; doubtless&#44; has the subject of the advent of a 
Messiah been urged upon your attention&#44; both by Is&#8211; 
raelites and those who are of a different persuasion. 
VOL. II. 22 

<pb n="254"/>

254 THE MESSIAH. 

Full often&#44; too&#44; has this subject been learnedly and 
ably handled by controversial writers and oral dis&#8211; 
putants&#59; and&#44; nevertheless&#44; professed believers in 
revelation are nowise agreed as to the nature of the 
Messiah&#44; nor the object and intent of his mission. 
Still&#44; because the doctrine of the coming of this pe&#8211; 
culiar favourite of God is so vitally important&#44; it is 
absolutely necessary to endeavour to obtain some 
correct idea concerning him&#44; despite of the many 
erroneous and generally false notions and doctrines&#44; 
promulgated chiefly by persons interested in main&#8211; 
taining views materially differing from ours. &#8212; Let us 
elucidate&#44; first&#44; the nature of the Messiah by the light 
which Scripture&#44; the only true test&#44; afibrds&#44; and next&#44; 
we must by the same rule trace out the extent and 
scope of his mission. 

Our opponents aver that the deity is of a divided 
nature&#44; that is to say&#44; that although God be one&#44; there 
still exists a modification in this oneness&#44; to use an ex&#8211; 
pressive word&#44; which permits God to divide himself 
into god and man &#59; or in other words&#44; one part of the 
deity could&#44; and at one time did&#44; invest himself with 
all the attributes of humanity and mortality&#44; while 
the other portion retained the divine attributes and 
the superintending power over all nature&#44; and even 
over the other portion of himself which had become 
man. All this was done&#44; because in the fall of Adam 
all mankind are averred to have earned everlasting 
condemnation&#59; and therefore&#44; it is contended&#44; that to 
insure them salvation&#44; God himself had to descend 
into the body of the seed of the Avoman &#40;Eve&#41;&#44; to be 
enabled&#44; by the assumption of the human form&#44; to 
ofler himself as an atonement for the sins of man&#8211; 

<pb n="255"/>

THE MESSIAH. 255 

kind to the other portion of the deity not invested 
with humanity. From all which it would appear to 
he the opinion of the sect alluded to that&#44; to be able 
to effect the salvation of man&#44; God had to sacrifice 
himself to himself to make it possible for him to 
save&#44; unto happiness and salvation&#44; the creatures 
whom He had formed for happiness and salvation. 
This incarnation of the deity moreover&#44; which it is 
alleged was to be&#44; and actually was sacrificed for the 
sins of man&#44; they call Christ&#44; or Messiah&#44; which ren&#8211; 
dered into the vernacular tongue&#44; means the anointed 
chief or priest&#44; elevated to his station by having been 
consecrated with oil&#44; by anointing with which priests 
and chiefs among us used to be appointed. In short&#44; 
they say that the Messiah&#44; whom the prophets fore&#8211; 
told&#44; was to be a god&#44; and a portion of the deity&#44; that 
through him alone the salvation of all men was to be 
effected&#44; and that lastly&#44; this personage&#44; or to use 
their term&#44; this divine personage&#44; has made his ap&#8211; 
pearance already&#44; and that&#44; therefore&#44; the prophecies 
alluding and referring to a redeemer to be sent have 
been already accomplished. I believe&#44; brethren&#44; that 
I have stated to you&#44; with as much candour and fair&#8211; 
ness as I was able to summon&#44; the nature&#44; attributes&#44; 
and scope of the IS&#39;azarene doctrines&#44; which I did&#44; in 
order to lay before you a concise view of our ideas 
on the same subject&#44; and to proye&#44; how these are de&#8211; 
ducible and strengthened by the plain import of the 
text of Holy Writ. 

First&#44; we contend that the ever&#8211;blessed God is not 
capable of division or change&#59; and&#44; secondly&#44; we 
maintain that nowhere is there even a remote allu&#8211; 
sion to prove the necessity of the intervention of a 

<pb n="256"/>

256 THE MESSIAH. 

mediator to insure man&#39;s salvation. &#8212; God&#44; according 
to our opinion&#44; is infinite&#44; immeasurable&#44; and indivisi&#8211; 
ble&#59; that is to say&#44; we have no conception of the pe&#8211; 
riod when his existence began&#44; nor can we conceive 
any possibility of his ceasing to exist&#59; immeasurable 
we call Him&#44; because the immense extent of space is 
not able to hold Him&#59; He does not exist in the world&#44; 
but the Avorld exists in&#44; as well as through Him &#59; and 
indivisible we believe Him&#44; because no material body 
can separate Him into parts&#44; no walls can bar Him 
out&#44; no seas can withstand Him&#44; and no darkness can 
screen us from his presence. And thus also we are 
taught in the one hundred and thirty&#8211;ninth Psalm &#58; 
&#34; Whither shall I go from thy spirit &#61; and whither 
shall I flee from thy face &#61; If I ascend to heaven&#44; 
Thou art there&#44; and if I should lie down in the deep&#44; 
I should find Thee.&#34; The whole of this eminently 
beautiful&#44; devotional Psalm must be familiar to you&#44; 
and it is therefore enough to refer you to it&#44; for the 
sake of proving that the Bible&#8211;doctrine of the Deity 
is an entire omnipresence and a perfect indivisibility. 
&#8212; &#39;Now&#44; what can be meant by the idea of god father 
and god son&#44; but that the divine essence is divided 
into two and distinct persons&#44; of whom one must of 
necessity have the priority of existence&#61; For&#44; grant 
that the existence of both is coeval&#44; or that they were 
always coexistent&#44; then it must follow that there are 
two independent powers&#59; because&#44; if one of the per&#8211; 
sons be more powerful than the other&#44; how can there 
be harmony and concert &#61; or even grant this&#44; on ac&#8211; 
count of the perfection of the divine nature&#44; it yet is 
left to be determined&#44; who of the two is the creator&#61; 
The absurdity of a divided deity is thus made per&#8211;

fectly manifest&#44; it being so completely clisconsonant 
with common sense&#44; besides which the holy law 
plainly declares &#58; &#34; Hear&#44; O 
Israel&#44; the Lord our God is the sole eternal Being&#44;&#34; 
or according to the common version&#44; &#34;the Lord our 
God&#44; the Lord is one &#33;&#34; This certainly means that a 
plurality of the divine power is entirely dissonant 
with the doctrines of revelation. But&#44; say the jN&#39;aza&#8211; 
renes&#58; &#34; We do not say that there are two gods&#44; but 
that the father and son are one.&#34; Let us examine 
this doctrine also by the same standard we just now 
adopted. The father&#44; I presume&#44; we must suppose 
to be the creator of all&#44; and consequently the elder 
power&#44; and of course the son&#44; as well as every thing 
else in nature&#44; is a creature or an emanation from the 
creator. If you admit this&#44; and you must come to 
this at last&#44; then it follows that God has at one time 
or the other divested himself of a portion of his power 
and conferred it upon another personage&#59; or worse&#44; 
that lie has divided himself into two or perhaps more 
parts. But independently of the entire unintelligible&#8211; 
ness of such an opinion&#44; it is contradicted by the plain 
letter of Scripture&#44; which says &#40;Isaiah xlii. 8&#41; &#58; &#34;I am 
the everlasting One&#44; this is my name&#44; and my glory 
to any otherJL will not give&#44; nor my praise to images.&#34; 
&#40;Ibid&#44; xliii. &#8211;10&#8211;12&#41;&#58; &#34;You are my witnesses&#44; saith the 
Lord&#44; and my servant&#44; whom I have chosen&#59; in order 
that you may know&#44; and believe me&#44; and understand 
that I am He&#59; before me no god was formed&#44; and 
after me there will be none. I&#44; only I&#44; am the Lord&#44; 
and there is none beside me a saviour. I have myself 
told&#44; and have saved&#44; have caused you to hear&#44; and 
among you was no stranger god&#59; and you are then

my witnesses&#44; saith the Lord &#8212; and I am God.&#34; Ibid&#44; 
xliv. 6&#58; &#34; Thus saith the Lord&#44; Israel&#39;s King and his 
Redeemer&#44; the Lord of the universe&#44; I am the first&#44; 
and I am the last&#44; and beside me there is no god.&#34; 
Ibid. 24&#58; &#34;I am the Lord who make all things&#59; who 
spread out the heaven by myself alone&#44; and extend 
the earth from myself.&#34; And in the same manner 
also speaks Jeremiah x. &#58; &#39; But the Lord God is truth&#59; 
He is the living God and the everlasting King. &#8212; Yes&#44; 
thus ye shall say to them. The gods that made not the 
heaven and the earth shall perish from the earth and 
from beneath these heavens.&#34; All these passages&#44; 
which could be fortified by innumerable others&#44; clearly 
demonstrate&#44; that the God of the Bible is not of a 
divisible nature&#44; but of simple essence and of eternal 
duration. What are the words we have quoted&#58; &#34;I 
am the first&#44; and I am the last&#44; and beside me there 
is no god &#61;&#34; This verse surely means to say&#44; that the 
Creator God is alone the King and Redeemer&#59; for 
beside Him no other god exists. How then can there 
be a second personage to share the honours of the 
Supreme&#61; How can we reconcile it with reason&#44; to 
assert in one phrase that one God alone does all&#44; and 
claims all the honour of worship&#44; and in another mo&#8211; 
ment to maintain that&#44; nevertheless&#44; there are two 
parts composing the same one&#44; both claiming and de&#8211; 
serving the same regard and adoration&#61; &#8212; We could 
carry this argument out to a much greater length&#44; 
but it is not expedient to treat the subject in a con&#8211; 
troversial light&#44; any farther than to exhibit to your 
understanding the absurdity and the contradiction to 
revelation which are presented in the idea of a plu&#8211; 
rality in the deity&#44; or of a division in the divine es&#8211; 

<pb n="259"/>

sence. From all the above we must deduce as a 
natural consequence&#44; that our Messiah cannot be god&#59; 
since that Avould say&#44; in efiect&#44; that God himself is 
the Messiah&#44; or that a portion of himself were the 
Messiah&#44; both of which doctrines have been shown 
to be follacious. 

In the second place&#44; especially with reference to 
the object of the sending of this messenger&#44; he is not 
to come to save sinners&#44; much less to die in atone&#8211; 
ment for them&#59; because we believe&#44; and can prove&#44; 
that God requires no assistance to enable Him to 
save the man whom He has created. Where lirst the 
idea of a vicarious sacrifice took its rise from we are 
not able to determine&#59; but of one thing we are per&#8211; 
fectly certain&#44; that not the most distant allusion is 
found in the Bible which&#44; if rationally interpreted&#44; 
will bear an interpretation favourable to this doctrine. 
Let us now take a calm view of the assertion&#44; that 
God could not forgive man for the original sin com&#8211; 
mitted by Adam&#44; till a vicarious atonement &#40;for this&#44; 
I believe&#44; is the term employed&#41; was made&#59; and what 
does it amount to &#61; but that God is unable to forgive 
sins&#59; which is a monstrous absurdity&#44; even admitting 
that by the sins of our original progenitors we were 
debarred frqin all admission into happiness. But is 
this true &#61; By no means &#59; for as regards the first&#44; God 
emphatically styles himself the Forgiver of sins&#44; the 
Pardoner of iniquities&#44; expressed in the two Hebrew 
words nSiD and&#39;&#58;&#58;&#59; consequently He requires no one 
person nor any one thing to authorize Him to forgive&#44; 
if He&#44; the All&#8211;wise thinks that the atonement made&#44; 
or suffered&#44; or even contemplated by the sinner&#44; be 
enough. As also we read in Exod. xxxiv. 6&#8211;7&#44; &#34;The 

<pb n="260"/>

260 THE MESSIAH. 

Lord Everlasting&#44; is a God merciful and gracious&#44; 
long of anger and great in kindness and truth&#59; He 
preserveth kindness unto the thousandth generation&#44; 
pardoning iniquity&#44; transgression and sin&#44; yet suf&#8211; 
fereth not guilt to pass unpunished.&#34; Here the words 
employed&#44; as plainly as words can speak&#44; distinctly 
announce that every sin will be visited with God&#39;s 
indignation&#44; that every sinner must be punished&#58; yet 
that&#44; nevertheless&#44; there is a remedy&#44; a return to 
righteousness&#44; a change of conduct&#44; which will cause 
God to show himself not as the Avenger of outraged 
righteousness&#44; but as the merciful Father&#44; who will 
bear with the fault of the child when he alters&#44; chas&#8211; 
tise with moderation&#44; and then forgive the guilt. 
This is so beautifully expressed by the word xiyj which 
originally means to bear&#44; to carry&#44; to suffer&#44; and thus it 
expresses the indulgent kindness of the Father of all 
more strongly&#44; than any other term implying forgive&#8211; 
ness could have done. All this must tend to prove 
that the eternal Lord of all is of himself able&#44; with&#8211; 
out assistance or intervention&#44; to bear with and to 
forgive whatever sins may have been committed from 
nature&#39;s birthday to her dissolution&#59; He is&#44; indeed 
all sufficient and truly the almighty God&#44; 
able to effect every thing&#59; and consequently there can 
be no being able to aiford and grant Him the slightest 
assistance. 

Yet it may be said&#58; &#34;True&#44; God is able&#59; but was 
He willing&#61; was not death decreed inconsequence of 
Adam&#39;s sins&#61;&#34; To this we answer&#44; that death was 
indeed decreed&#59; but not death of the soul&#44; not the 
damnation of the vital principle&#44; but the decease only 
of what is naturally mortal&#44; when divested of that

ethereal spark which bestowed on it life and Diotioii. 
Am I understood&#61; &#8212; Yet with regard to everlasting 
damnation having been the portion of every one that 
died before a given period&#44; it is absolutely contra&#8211; 
dicted&#44; not only by the spirit&#44; but by the letter of the 
Bible also. First&#44; nowhere in direct terms is it an&#8211; 
nounced that a Messiah should come to redeem souls 
from purgatory&#59; and secondly&#44; we are taught that we 
have power over sin&#44; as God said to Cain&#58; &#34;If thou 
dost&#39; act well thou wilt be accepted&#44; but if thou dost 
not act well&#44; sin will rest at the door&#44; and to thee is 
his desire&#44; but thou canst rule over him.&#34; &#8212; Here a 
direct dominion over sin is conceded to man. Farther&#44; 
in Leviticus xviii. 5&#44; we read &#58; &#39;&#39; And you shall observe 
my statutes and my judgments&#44; which a man is to do 
and live through them &#59; I am the Lord.&#34; Deut. xxxii. 
47 &#58; &#34; For it is not an empty matter for you&#44; on the 
contrary&#44; it is your life.&#34; &#8212; Solomon&#44; the wise king of 
Israel&#44; speaking of the divine wisdom&#44; the fear of 
the Lord&#44; and the knowledge of the law&#44; says &#40;Prov.

and hath obtained favour of the Lord.&#34; Ibid. ix.

and honour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness&#44; 
and all her paths are peace. A tree of life is she to 
those that lay hold of her&#44; and her supporters are 
happy.&#34; In Ezekiel&#44; also &#40;chap&#44; xx.&#41;&#44; we have a con&#8211; 
firmation &#40;if any confirmation could even be needed 
to fortify the doctrines of the blessed Moses&#41; in the 
following words &#58; &#34; And I gave unto them my statutes&#44; 
and my judgments I made known to them&#44; which a

man is to do and live tlirough them. And also my 
Sabbaths I gave to them&#44; to be for a sign between me 
and them&#44; to show that I am the Lord that sanctified 
them.&#34; All these passages&#44; selected without any par&#8211; 
ticular care from various books of Scripture&#44; go far 
to prove that God&#44; in giving the Sabbath and the 
statutes contained in the law delivered from Sinai&#44; 
intended that their observance should insure life and 
happiness&#59; and unless anyone can show&#44; what indeed 
some have asserted&#44; that the Israelites had no fixed 
idea of a reward and punishment hereafter&#44; it is also 
evident that salvation of the soul must be included by 
the prophet&#44; since no other requisite is ever spoken 
of or even alluded to. And that the Israelites knew 
of an hereafter&#44; can also be demonstrated by various 
scriptural passages&#44; all admitting of but one interpre&#8211; 
tation. When Abigail&#44; the wife of Nabal&#44; the Car&#8211; 
melite&#44; met David to dissuade him from his intended 
violence against her husband&#44; she said&#44; among other 
things &#58; &#34;And a man rose to pursue thee and to seek 
thy soul&#59; but may the soul of my Lord be bound up 
in the bond of life with the Lord my God.&#34; &#40;1 Samuel 
XXV. 29.&#41; &#8212; In this passage&#44; the e&#39;sj or soul is used 
twice&#44; first&#44; with regard to the injury intended by the 
man Saul against David&#44; secondly&#44; in the blessing 
pronounced upon the latter. Though now the word 
Naphesh often means person&#44; yet the phrase lyaj typn 
means to take life&#44; or to separate soul and body&#44; and 
it consequently has then no 7naterial reference&#59; there&#8211; 
fore&#44; when the word is used again in the next sen&#8211; 
tence&#44; it must needs bear the same meaning&#44; and refer 
then to the spiritual soul&#59; or in other words&#44; Abigail 
prayed that the pious shepherd of Israel&#44; whom she 

<pb n="263"/>

THE MESSIAH. 263 

addressed&#44; might be found acceptable before the Lord 
his God&#44; and be ultimately rewarded by Him with 
life unending&#44; despite that now a man&#44; distinguished 
and great&#44; endeavoured to hunt him down&#44; and to 
seek his death. Also in the .book of Psalms&#44; David 
expresses his hope of a glorious permanence in the 
following glowing words &#58; &#34;I will bless the Lord who 
hath counselled me&#59; also in the dark nights&#44; when 
my thoughts oppress me&#44; have I placed the Lord ever 
before me &#59; for He is at my right hand&#44; that I cannot 
be moved. Therefore is glad my heart&#44; and it re&#8211; 
joiceth my glory &#40;the soul&#41;&#44; and also my flesh &#40;the 
body&#41; will rest securely. For thou leavest not my soul 
to the grave. Thou wilt not suffer thy pious one to 
see corruption. Thou makest known to me the path 
of life&#59; the fulness of the joy is before thy face&#44; the 
pleasures on thy right hand are unending.&#34; &#40;Psalm 
xvi. 7&#8211;11.&#41; Also&#44; in Psalm xxvii. 13 &#58; &#39;&#39; Did I not be&#8211; 
lieve to behold happiness from the Lord in the land 
of life&#61;&#34; &#8212; The foregoing quotations must certainly 
tend to prove&#44; almost to demonstration&#44; that the Is&#8211; 
raelites had a perfect notion&#44; and a beautiful one too&#44; 
of the true happiness which awaits the righteous&#44; and 
that they expected to reach this happiness through a 
righteousness founded upon the execution of the so 
much undeiwalued observance of the tenets of the 
Mosaic religion. If now&#44; as it must be evident&#44; hap&#8211; 
piness and life could be reached through these means 
at the time of the prophets&#44; it is apparent that&#44; unless 
a limitation had been mentioned&#44; the same means 
now must produce&#44; and this inevitably so&#44; the same 
results&#59; or to state the matter so as to offer an answer 
to the objection raised&#44; that God is willing and able 

<pb n="264"/>

264 THE MESSIAH. 

to save mankind unto salvation&#44; without the interven&#8211; 
tion of a mediator or a vicarious sacrifice to be offered 
up as an atonement for the original sin of Adam&#59; 
since a man&#39;s own righteousness&#44; based upon an ob&#8211; 
servance of the law of God&#44; is enough to save him. 
By this&#44; however&#44; we do not mean to say&#44; that any 
man can set up a measure or a quantity of righteous 
deeds&#44; beyond which he need not go to insure the 
desired happiness&#59; but that&#44; if a man has done in sin&#8211; 
cerity and truth all that ever was in his power of ac&#8211; 
complishing&#44; he will doubtless receive the favour of 
that Being&#44; whom in sincerity he has endeavoured to 
worship. Consequently&#44; the doctrine maintained by 
us cannot be charged with the defect of a tendency 
to render us proud and careless&#59; but&#44; on the contrary&#44; 
it will cause us to be circumspect and humble&#44; since 
by these means alone&#44; we will be induced to make 
exertions to practise wdiatever the Scriptures demand 
of us&#44; in order to obtain the favour of the Lord&#44; which 
to do has been placed altogether within our power&#59; 
for&#44; in addition to the gift of a rational soul&#44; our God 
and King has given us his law for our government&#44; 
by obeying which a man may live virtuously and reach 
life and happiness. 

In the foregoing&#44; it has been briefly shown&#44; that 
the Deity is not divisible&#44; and that&#44; consequently. He 
never could have been divided&#59; add to which&#44; that 
God is a pure spirit&#44; not liable to change or decay&#44; 
not visible to&#44; nor tangible by the senses &#58; and it must 
be conceded&#44; that the divine essence&#44; or God himself&#44; 
never could have been enclosed within a mortal body&#59; 
for to have thus been mixed up with mortality would 
have rendered the Godhead liable to change&#44; death&#44; 

<pb n="265"/>

THE MESSIAH. 265 

and corruption&#59; and then the deity&#44; while on earth in 
such a body&#44; must have been tangible&#44; material&#44; and 
visible to the eyes &#59; and does not the prophet say &#58; 
&#34;And to whom will you compare God&#44; and what form 
will you liken to him&#61;&#34; &#40;Isaiah xl. 19.&#41; But even let 
this pass &#59; still if this personage did actually appear&#44; 
and was really slain ignominiously to effect an atone&#8211; 
ment for mankind &#58; what need is there for any exer&#8211; 
tion to live virtuously&#44; since a complete atonement 
must have been made &#61; And if it is contended&#44; that 
the death of the Messiah was only to remove the disa&#8211; 
bility to happiness which before existed&#58; then we ask&#44; 
what was the state of the righteous of former times &#61; 
were they saved or not&#61; if the first&#44; how could they be 
happy with the original sin unatoned for &#61; and if the 
last&#44; how could God give them a law&#44; the observance 
of which after all could not satisfy his indignation &#61; 
But pass over this objection also&#44; as more ingenious 
than solid &#58; yet we ask&#44; What are men of the present 
day to do to obtain felicity after their disability&#8211; has 
been once removed &#61; what law are they to obey &#61; 
Our opponents do not say that our law is to be fol&#8211; 
lowed&#59; and yet we may boldly say&#44; that they have 
none of divine origin to offer in its stead. The Mes&#8211; 
siah is acknowledged to be but an agent&#44; even grant 
him to be a part of the Deity &#58; what right can he have 
then to abrogate the old&#44; and institute a new law &#61; 
And even grant this also &#58; still the question recurs&#44; 
Where is the new code&#44; where is the public legislation&#44; 
where is the evident manifestation of divine majesty&#44; 
like the glorious descent on Sinai &#61; The . doctrines&#44; 
in short&#44; of the incarnation&#44; of the vicarious atonement&#44; 
and of the new religion in all its modifications&#44; are all

obnoxious to the objections just indicated&#59; and al&#8211; 
though they are so briefly stated&#44; yet the demonstra&#8211; 
tions and proofs drawn from Holy Writ&#44; faithfully 
and honestly presented&#44; must convince every Israelite&#44; 
and to these alone I address myself&#44; that the doctrine 
of a plurality in the divine Author of all is blasphe&#8211; 
mous &#59; that the doctrine of an incarnation is incom&#8211; 
patible with the nature of God as pronounced through 
the mouth of the prophets &#59; that the doctrine of an 
appeasing offering being requisite to satisfy God&#44; and 
to enable Him to save mankind&#44; when otherwise He 
would not be able&#44; is unsupported and contradicted 
by Scripture&#59; since God always announces himself as 
the only Redeemer and Saviour&#44; from whom all re&#8211; 
demption proceeds&#44; and that all beings act under 
Him and are ruled by his guidance. And therefore 
by inference as well as by direct argument we have 
arrived at the conclusion&#44; that God is one and alone&#44; 
without division&#44; without similitude &#59; incorporeal&#44; 
and therefore&#44; intangible&#44; and immortal&#59; that He has 
never delegated his power to any other being&#44; and 
without this no other power equal to Him can exist&#59; 
that He has never doomed man to utter hopelessness&#44; 
but that He has established statutes and ordinances 
which&#44; when observed&#44; will lead to happiness&#44; here 
and hereafter.&#8212; In illustration of this&#44; we read farther 
in Isaiah &#40;xli. 4&#41; &#58; 

&#34;Who effected and did this&#61; who called forth the generations 
from the beginning&#61; I the Lord&#44; the first&#44; and with the latest&#44; I 
am the same.&#34;

These predicates and attribnfes belong but to the 
One&#44; before whom walked our patriarch Abram&#44; whom 
God called out from Ur iu Chaldea&#44; that he might 
become a shining light to those that dwelt in dark&#8211; 
ness&#59; no other being there exists that shareth his 
glory&#44; and none ever will be&#44; our God &#33; who will rule 
with Thee&#44; none can ever exist to whom Thou canst 
be compared&#59; for Thou alone art God&#44; and Thine 
alone will ever be the dominion and rule over all. &#8212; 
But yet of thy glory and of thy wisdom Thou hast 
bestowed on man the work of thy hands &#59; and Thou 
wiliest that he should be happy by obeying thy pre&#8211; 
cepts&#44; and the children of Jacob Thou hast chosen to 
be thy beloved people. Let then&#44; we pray Thee&#44; thy 
power be again displayed&#44; and send Thou the anoint&#8211; 
ed messenger&#44; David thy servant&#44; whom Thou hast 
ordained to effect by thy assistance the restoration 
of thy people&#44; who look up to Thee in their captivity&#44; 
and cry unto Thee in their affliction. May this 
speedily come to pass&#44; even in our days and in our 
lives&#44; and may then Judah be saved and Israel dwell 
securely. Amen &#33;

No. 11. 

In THY NAME&#44; Lorcl &#33; may thy people be blessed&#61; 
and may their sufferings be removed by thy mercy&#59; 
and do thou cause those that are captives in the whole 
world&#44; thy earth&#44; to be gathered together on thy holy 
mountain&#44; to serve Thee there&#44; according to the com&#8211;

Brethren &#33; 

On the subject of Messiah&#44; which was lately offered 
to your consideration&#44; it was exhibited to you that&#44; 
according to the doctrines which are obviously de&#8211; 
ducible from Scripture&#44; the person promised to be 
sent is not to be a divinity&#44; nor if he were&#44; would 
it be requisite for him to atone for the sins of the 
world. This argument was considered necessary to 
prove&#44; that there was no intention to predict the ad&#8211; 
vent of a being whose nature should be differino&#59; from 
that of man&#44; and whose actions should have the effect 
of reconciling the indignant and offended Creator to 
his creatures. It will not be denied&#44; that the idea of 
a god coming down full of love and compassion&#44; and 
assuming a nature and appearance foreign to him to 
work an entire change in the regulation and economy 

<pb n="269"/>

THE MESSIAH. 269 

of the world&#44; is highly poetical&#59; but&#44; nevertheless&#44; it 
cannot become a matter of fViith&#44; one to found our 
belief upon&#44; if it clashes at all with the sublime truths 
of the holy law&#44; which was given to us to be actually 
the guide and instructor for every thing relating to 
the divine nature &#40;if I may make use of so profane a 
word&#41;&#44; and to the divine economy&#44; and to the conduct 
of God towards man&#44; the chief and best work of his 
hands. In no part of the canon of our Bible does it 
say&#44; that a deity should be delegated&#44; in no one verse 
is it taught in so many words that the Deity&#44; who 
spoke through the prophets&#44; would cause a division 
in Himself to ensue&#44; and in no one passage does it 
say&#44; that there can be no salvation except through 
the death of such a messenger. &#8212; The idea&#44; in short&#44; 
notwithstanding its poetical beauty&#44; is no scriptural 
idea&#44; but an invention of heathen poets&#44; Avhose works 
teem full of reports of incarnations&#44; and of bodily 
appearances of divinities on the earth&#44; and of divi&#8211; 
sions of the gods&#44; and of progenies and children of 
these gods&#44; some of whom were classed among the 
immortals&#44; others again .among those liable to change 
and corruption. &#8212; We cannot deny&#44; that many pas&#8211; 
sages in the Bible have been tortured to show a dele&#8211; 
gation of the divine holiness to another&#59; but still we 
do maintain&#44; that without unfair reasonins&#59; not a sin&#8211; 
gle passage bears a direct and evident interpretation 
to this effect&#59; and&#44; moreover&#44; we contend that&#44; if it 
were true that in such a faith our whole salvation 
depended&#44; it would not have been indicated in an 
obscure wording&#44; but in a direct announcement like 
the first precept in the Decalogue&#44; &#39;I am the ever&#8211; 
lasting One&#44; thy God&#44; who have brought thee out of

the land of Egypt&#39; where the evident and direct 
words leave no room for doubt or uncertainty. 

Much has been written and said on the subject of 
this our difference from other sects&#59; but the books 
and arguments are not accessible to many&#44; besides 
which they are mostly stated in too learned a way to 
become generally useful. I therefore&#44; propose to de&#8211; 
vote some little time to the elucidation of several 
texts&#44; before I proceed to unfold our views of the na&#8211; 
ture and object of the Messiah. &#8212; At the same time&#44; I 
must do myself the justice to state&#44; that although 
I thus undertake to attack&#44; to a certain extent&#44; the 
opinions of the majority of the people among whom 
we live&#58; it is not done for the sake of making a dis&#8211; 
play of our own views to those entertaining contrary 
opinions&#44; but solely to instruct those among us who 
may entertain doubts&#44; or be not well informed&#44; on 
this subject&#44; as to what is generally thought thereof 
by Jews&#44; and to enable them&#44; in some measure&#44; to 
give reasonable answers&#44; when they are asked for the 
reasons of their faith. It is a long time already since 
these considerations were presented to my mind &#59; but 
never&#44; until now&#44; could I resolve to speak of them in 
a public address. To be altogether silent &#8212; permit 
me to remark &#8212; would appear&#44; as though we Jews 
had not the courage to speak of things pertaining to 
our religion in our own assemblies. Now&#44; although it 
is abhorrent to all correct sentiment to attack others&#44; 
or to wound their feelings in so essential a point as 
religion &#58; still would that cowardice be much more 
blameworthy which would prevent Jews from speak&#8211; 
ing of their own laws in their own assemblies&#44; in a 
country&#44; where equal rights are guaranteed to all 

<pb n="271"/>

the inhabitants by the constitution and the laws of 
the land. Whilst we&#44; therefore&#44; concede to every 
sect the right of temperately discussing any thing re&#8211; 
lating to their own and even to our persuasion &#58; we 
also claim and have the same right&#59; and&#44; if temper&#8211; 
ately exercised&#44; no one can&#44; and no one ought&#44; to 
complain. Complaisance and forbearance are&#44; truly 
speaking&#44; great virtues&#44; which ought to be strictly 
cultivated&#59; but their exercise should never degrade 
them into the kindred vices of affected politeness and 
meanness&#59; and better far would it be were our 
mouths stopped by the violent arm of arbitrary rule&#44; 
than that we should surrender tamely to worldly ex&#8211; 
pediency what we refused to yield amidst the heavy 
persecutions we had to encounter &#8212; I mean the right 
of honestly believing the truth and of boldly express&#8211; 
ing what we believe. And let me add&#44; that if we 
once submit&#44; and give up tacitly this precious right 
of expounding our laws according to our received 
opinions&#58; the enemies of Judaism will have achieved 
a victory for which they have so long striven in vain &#59; 
as they will thus have succeeded to make the laws of 
God by degrees forgotten by us&#44; and the next step 
would then be of easy attainment&#59; for&#44; when our or&#8211; 
dinances are forgotten&#44; theirs will be readily substi&#8211; 
tuted in tli.eir place&#44; and Israel&#44; which God in his 
mercy forefend&#44; will have ceased to be a nation. But 
there lives that One above who will prevent such a 
calamity&#44; and that time will never arrive which shall 
witness the quenching of the glorious light&#44; which 
has been ordained the guiding star of all mankind&#33; 
&#8212; I fear that I have said already too much&#59; since 
no apology for the discussion proposed is necessary

to justify myself towards any Israelite&#44; and I doubt 
whether any can at all be looked for by one who does 
not believe with us. Let us&#44; therefore&#44; without far&#8211; 
ther preface&#44; proceed to the illustration of the various 
texts upon which our opponents rely as a justification 
of their doctrines&#59; and I have only to remark&#44; that I 
shall not go over the whole ground&#44; but merely select 
a few of the most prominent&#44; believing that it will be 
easy for any one to explain the Bible&#8211;texts to himself&#44; 
if he has been made acquainted with the interpreta&#8211; 
tion of a few selected from various parts of Scripture. 
Some persons have fancied that they could discover 
in the phraseology of the Bible an allusion to a plu&#8211; 
rality in the Deity&#59; among the rest&#44; the text in the 
first chapter of Genesis &#58; &#34; And God said. We will 
make man in our image&#44; in our likeness&#44; and he shall 
rule over the fish of the sea&#44; and over the birds of 
heaven&#44; and over the cattle&#44; and over all the earth&#44; 
and over all the creeping things that move on the 
earth.&#34; &#34;And God said. We will make man&#44;&#34; it is 
alleged&#44; refers to a plurality in the Deity&#44; say father&#44; 
son&#44; and ghost&#44; who consulted and agreed to make 
the creature called man after the image of God &#58; first&#44; 
in the nature and constitution of his soul&#44; and also&#44; 
measurably&#44; of the body&#44; since the son of God took 
the body of man&#59; secondly&#44; in his place and authority&#59; 
and&#44; lastly&#44; in his purity and rectitude. That a con&#8211; 
struction of the verse in question should at all be 
used to prove a plurality in the Deity is a matter of 
surprise &#59; but surely a consultation and agreement in 
the persons&#44; were any existing&#44; of the Godhead&#44; can 
in nowise be inferred. To the definition of the words 
&#34;image and likeness&#34; as just exhibited&#44; which&#44; by 

<pb n="273"/>

THE MESSIAH. 273 

the way&#44; was given in the very words of a work in 
great authority among the ITazarenes&#44; we could make 
but Uttle objection&#44; except with regard to the body 
of .man having been dignified by an assumption of it 
by a part of the Deity&#44; which we deny as having taken 
place&#44; and&#44; consequently&#44; cannot think it implied 
under the words &#34;image and likeness.&#34; &#8212; It strikes 
me&#44; that the whole difficulty of explaining the verse 
we have quoted can&#34; be removed&#44; if we consider&#44; that 
the Hebrew&#44; as well as every other language&#44; I be&#8211; 
lieve&#44; has words which have a plural form&#44; and yet 
are&#44; in their signification&#44; singular&#44; Now&#44; in constru&#8211; 
ing a word of this kind&#44; the writer may employ the 
verbs&#44; adjectives&#44; pronouns&#44; and nouns&#44; referring to 
it&#44; either in the singular&#44; according to its signification&#44; 
or in the plural&#44; according to its form. The whole&#44; 
then resolves itself into a grammatical construction 
of a sentence &#59; and if no rule of propriety is thereby 
violated&#44; and if the meaning is not rendered ambigu&#8211; 
ous or uncertain&#44; the singular and plural both are 
employed in Hebrew alternatelj&#39;&#44; as can be shown by 
examples taken from the only remains of the Hebrew&#44; 
which are found&#44; as all know&#44; in the Bible solely. &#8212; 
The term D&#39;nbx&#44; which is commonly rendered God&#44; is 
one of this class of words&#44; and has the appearance of 
a plural&#44; though actually a singular. Many reasons 
and explanations have been given why the plural 
form should be employed to designate the Deity&#59; but 
it must be observed that is not by any means the only 
name applied to God in our holy language&#44; but is one 
of the many which have been given to Him&#44; and is 
like them expressive of some particular quality in&#8211; 
herent in Him. So we call Him the All&#8211;suifi&#8211;

cient&#44; because He is able to accomplish every thing 
which He may desire &#59; niu or Creator&#44; because He 
alone produced existence out of non&#8211;existence&#44; a ma&#8211; 
terial world out of nothing&#59; So&#39; &#42; the Almighty&#44; 
because his power is universal&#44; and his kingdom ex&#8211; 
tends over all&#59; farther Sn God&#44; or&#44; more properly 
speaking&#44; the Power&#44; because to Him all power ap&#8211; 
pertaineth&#44; and to Him all are accountable&#59; Many 
other names expressive of his glory belong also to 
Him &#59; but it is foreign to our purpose to enumerate 
them&#44; and we must therefore conclude the number 
by adding the last term by which He revealed him&#8211; 
self to our forefathers&#44; and particularly to Moses&#44; the 
name which expresses his essence to be permanent&#44; 
ever being&#44; never ending&#59; profane lips&#44; like ours&#44; 
must not utter the ineflable word&#44; but it declares God 
as the eternal One&#44; who ever was&#44; always is&#44; and ever 
will be&#44; without change&#44; without division. It will be 
perceived&#44; from an inspection of the Bible&#44; that not 
one of the names&#44; just enumerated&#44; is ever found in 
the plural either of termination or signification&#44; but 
always in the singular&#44; without a solitary exception. 
IsTow&#44; it appears to me&#44; if I dare to give an expression 
to my ideas&#44; without having the support of any com&#8211; 
mentator known to me&#44; that the word D&#39;hSk is the 
plural of Sx in its signification of power and should 
accordingly be rendered the powers and as applied 
to God&#44; He in whom all powers are centred. To 
prove the plausibility of this interpretation is perfectly 

&#42; This term is not found in the Bible&#44; still it is expressive of the 
divine ability to accomplish all&#44; and is therefore here inserted with 
the others. The Biblical term is Most High God.

easy &#59; for the word elohim very often is applied to men 
to denote chief or judge&#44; either in singular or plural&#44; 
and also to false deities&#44; again either singular or plu&#8211; 
ral. In fact&#44; whenever the word God receives suffixes 
in Hebrew&#44; the plural form is almost invariably 
adopted with but few exceptions. To those who are 
unacquainted with the Hebrew grammar I offer&#44; as 
an explanation&#44; that those words&#44; which are termed 
in English possessive pronouns&#44; or pronouns denoting 
possession&#44; are expressed in Hebrew&#44; not by entire 
words&#44; but by letters or syllables attached to the end 
of the word to which they refer&#44; and these so&#8211;called 
suffixes are differently attached to the plural from 
the singular. I hope this brief explanation is suffi&#8211; 
ciently intelligible&#44; and assuming it to be so&#44; let us 
continue the argument. The plural suffixes are used 
with the plural&#8211;looking elohim&#44; even if denoting a 
single idol&#44; as we read in the address of Jephtha to 
the king of the Ammonites &#40;Judges xi. 24&#41; &#58; &#39;&#39;Behold 
that which thy god ynSx Kemosh giveth thee to in&#8211; 
herit&#44; that only thou mayest possess&#44; and that which 
the Lord our God hath driven out before us&#44; that 
even we will possess.&#34; In this passage no one can 
say&#44; with any show of reason&#44; that the word re&#8211; 
fers to any other than one idol&#44; since his name is 
mentioned&#44; &#34;hamely&#44; Kemosh &#59; and when&#44; in the second 
part of the verse&#44; &#94;yrh&#94; is used&#44; it certainly cannot 
mean any thing else save the one God&#44; not a plurality&#44; 
and refers therefore to the Lord Eternal&#44; whom the 
Israelites call their God. &#8212; AVitbout one word more 
added to what has just been said&#44; the argument ap&#8211; 
pears to me perfectly conclusive &#59; but we may carry 
the illustration&#44; for the sake of greater clearness&#44; a

little farther. The plural&#44; in connexioD with the 
Deity&#44; is used in but few other passages&#44; the whole 
number amounting to but six&#44;&#42; besides the one under 
consideration&#44; as far as I can recollect at the present 
moment&#44; and I very much doubt whether any more 
can be found &#59; and in explaining them we must be 
struck with the little authority they can give to a be&#8211; 
lief in a divided deity. &#8212; The first is in Genesis iii. 22&#44; 
immediately after the account of Adam&#39;s fall &#58; &#34; And 
&#40;He&#41; the Lord God said. Behold the man is become 
like one of us&#44; to know good and evil.&#34; Here &#34; like 
one of us&#39;&#39;&#39; is employed to convey the idea that man 
had acquired a degree of knowledge of good and evil 
superior to what he had before. Immediately there&#8211; 
after we read&#44; that God placed angels&#44; named cheru&#8211; 
bim&#44; to guard the entrance of the garden&#44; to prevent 
the re&#8211;entrance of man. Is it not now more than 
probable&#44; that in the mighty assembly of his minis&#8211; 
ters&#44; who&#44; as the prophets say&#44; surround his glory&#44; 
the Almighty thus spoke&#58; &#34;Behold man has now 
become like one of us &#40;here assembled&#41;&#44; to distinguish 
between good and evil&#61;&#34; And it then means&#44; that 
Adam had actually reached that knowledge which 
the serpent had foretold to Eve&#44; saying&#58; &#42;&#39;And you 
will become like elohim &#40;properly rendered divine 
&#34;beinsis or ano&#8211;els&#44; to distinguish them from Adam or 


Since writing the above&#44; I have found at least one more exam&#8211; 
ple of the kind spoken of in the text &#40;2 Samuel vii. 23&#41;&#44; which how&#8211; 
ever refers to an idol&#44; or any thing acknowledged as god&#44; and yet 
in the continuation the&#41;&#61;&#39;07io2. in referring to it is used in the singu&#8211; 
lar. &#8212; I do not recollect any more similar passages above referred 
to &#59; but I have no doubt&#44; that&#44; if any should be found&#44; the explana&#8211; 
tions given in the text will be enough to explain them.

sons of earth&#44;&#41; knowing good and evil.&#34; Adam and 
Eve had accordingly seen this truly verified&#44; but&#44; alas&#33; 
their innocence too had fled with their iofnorance&#44; 
.and they had offended God by seeking to dive farther 
than his command had permitted them. The doc&#8211; 
trine of the plurality&#44; you will see&#44; is nowise bene&#8211; 
fitted by this passage &#59; for acknowledging that it is 
after all&#44; like the whole account of the temptation&#44; 
awfully mysterious&#44; since it refers to a state of things 
of which we can&#44; from our altered state&#44; form no con&#8211; 
ception &#58; we may yet claim that our explanation bears 
the evident marks of orthodoxy&#44; which can be farther 
proved by a reference to the vision of Micaiah son of 
Yimlah&#44; which you can find in the twenty&#8211;second 
chapter of the 1st Kings&#44; beginning with verse 19. 

The second passage is also in Genesis &#40;chap. xi. 7&#41;. 
Speaking of the building of the Babylonian tower&#44; 
God is represented as saying&#58; &#34;Come on&#44; let us de&#8211; 
scend&#44; and let us mix there their language&#44; that one 
may not understand the speech of the other.&#34; If the 
explanation of the last&#8211;quoted passage has appeared 
reasonable&#44; then this one must and ought to be simi&#8211; 
larly explained&#59; but after all&#44; it may be taken as a 
mere soliloquy of God&#44; expressive of his intentions. 
But&#44; if I may urge my views&#44; I would respectfully &#8211; 
refer to wherfe God&#44; in speaking immediately to Abra&#8211; 
ham of his intentions to subvert Sodom and Gomorrah 
&#40;Genesis xviii. 21&#41;&#44; says&#58; &#34;I will now descend and 
see&#44;&#34; where the singular is used&#44; because the person 
addressed being mortal could not become a party in 
the transaction&#44; nor be employed as the agent&#44; and 
God therefore simply announced to him the intention 
He entertained of&#44; as it were&#44; descending unto the

regions of the earth&#44; and to investigate the reported 
misconduct of the cities of the plain. And when 
again we find God speaking in the heavenly council 
of his ministering seraphim &#40;Isaiah vi. 8&#41;&#44; we read&#58; 
&#34; And I heard the voice of the Lord saying&#44; Whom 
shall I send&#44; and who will go for us&#61; and I said&#44; Here 
I am&#44; do Thou send me.&#34; &#8212; Has our interpretation 
been thus clearly established&#61; &#8212; I hope so&#59; but more 
amplification would show it better&#44; yet I am admon&#8211; 
ished by the time already consumed not to dilate too 
largely&#44; although the subject is&#44; to me at least&#44; so 
highly interesting. 

The third instance is found again in Genesis xx. 
13&#44; where Abraham speaks of God having caused him 
to wander away from his father&#39;s house&#44; and uses the 
verb in plural&#44; which can be justified on the ground 
laid down&#44; that a noun having a plural termination&#44; 
though a singular meaning&#44; may have the verb agree&#8211; 
ing with it&#44; either according to the termination or the 
sense&#59; and if this is not satisfactory&#44; we may say that 
Abraham&#44; perhaps&#44; in addressing a heathen king who 
knew not exactly the trueworship&#44; used the language 
customary in the country&#44; without thereby intending 
to convey the idea of a plurality in the Deity. At 
all events&#44; any arguments from this verse in favour 
of such a doctrine must be too far&#8211;fetched to bear any 
authority whatever. 

The fourth example is also in Genesis&#44; in the his&#8211; 
tory of Jacob &#40;chap. xxxv. 7&#41;&#58; &#39;And he built there 
an altar&#44; and he called the place&#44; &#39; The God of Bethel &#59;&#39; 
for there had appeared to him the elohim&#44; when he 
fled before his brother.&#34; Here the word elohim is 
again employed as a plural&#59; still&#44; this passage&#44; of all 

<pb n="279"/>

THE MESSIAH. 279 

yet quoted the most favourable to our opponents&#44; will 
be found&#44; upon examination&#44; to aiFord them no tenable 
ground. For&#44; upon referring to the event alluded to&#44; 
we read in the account of Jacob&#39;s dream &#40;Genesis 
xxviii. 12&#41;&#58; &#34;And he dreamt&#44; and behold a ladder 
ws standing on the earth&#44; and its top was reaching 
heavenward&#44; and the angels of God were ascending 
and descending on it.&#34; What then did Jacob see in 
his dream at Bethel&#44; when he fled before his brother 
&#8212; a multitude&#44; or one being only &#61; &#8212; a multitude surely &#59; 
&#8212; but what constituted this multitude divinities or 
creatures&#61; &#8212; creatures surely&#44; although of the highest 
order &#59; and they were sent by God to comfort him in 
his trouble&#44; when sleep had weighed down his eye&#8211; 
lids&#44; while he was reposing on the flinty rock for a 
pillow&#59; and among this host of ministers also appeared 
the Creator&#44; who in his own glory comforted and as&#8211; 
sured his servant by promising him his protection. 
But does elohim mean angels&#61; certainly&#59; for after the 
angel had disappeared from the eyes of Manoah and 
his wife&#44; the former said &#58; &#34; We must die&#44; for we have 
seen an elohim&#44;&#34; meaning an angelic being&#44; for im&#8211; 
mediately before we are told&#44; &#34; Then knew Manoah 
that he was an angel of the Lord.&#34; And Manoah&#39;s 
wife too&#44; better informed perhaps&#44; at all events better 
judging&#44; answered &#58; &#34;If the Lord had wished to slay 
us. He would not have accepted from our hand burnt 
and meat&#8211;offering&#44; and would not have let us see all 
this&#44; nor at this time have suffered us to hear like 
that we have heard.&#34; &#40;Judges xiii. 21&#8211;23.&#41; The ex&#8211; 
planation here attempted is perfectly rational&#44; and will&#44; 
I trust&#44; be enough to clear away the seeming difficulty 
of this passage&#44; and the plural is then only used to

refer to tlie multitude of angels that appeared to 
Jacob ill his dream. 

The fifth example is found in Joshua xxiv. 19&#44; and 
constitutes a part of the address of this great leader 
to the Israelites before his death. He says&#59; &#39;&#39;You 
may not be able to serve the Lord&#44; for He is the holy 
Gods.&#34; I have rendered the words Elohim edoshim 
literally&#44; as though they referred actually to a plural 
number&#59; but who does not see that the singular &#34;He 
is&#34; is fatal to the assumption of the idea of a plurality 
being actually entertained&#61; and&#44; to give a rational 
commentary&#44; we must say&#44; that Joshua employed 
again the grammatical license of considering the word 
elohim both according to its nature and appearance&#44; 
and therefore he uses the adjective in the plural to 
agree with the latter&#44; and the pronoun in the singular 
to refer to the former. 

The sixtli example we have in Isaiah vi.&#44; and has 
already been explained&#44; and I hope that conviction 
has been wrought to demonstrate&#44; that no reliance 
whatever can be placed upon an argument founded 
upon few plural constructions of the word Elohim&#44; 
especially as the doctrine plainly taught to us says 
that the Lord our God {Elohim&#41; is one. &#8212; In addition 
to the foregoing&#44; it must be borne in mind&#44; that there 
are a number of other words in Hebrew &#40;like in most 
other languages&#44; as has been mentioned already&#41; 
which are used as plurals&#44; although having singular 
meanings&#44; among which we may enumerate D&#39;J3 face&#44; 
Dni&#59;j youth&#44; d&#39;d water&#44; D&#39;r&#58;iy heaven&#44; and many others 
which&#44; having no singular form&#44; are always construed 
as plurals&#44; although often applied to individual things. 
The argument which has been drawn from the verse 

<pb n="281"/>

THE MESSIAH. 281 

quoted from the first chapter of Genesis&#44; therefore&#44; 
appears so weak upon a cahxi review&#44; as hardly to 
merit a refutation&#59; hut as it is so constantly repeated 
and pressed on our view&#44; I hope the time will not be 
considered by you&#44; my brethren&#44; as misspent&#44; which 
has been devoted to its overthrow. In dismissing 
this subject for the present I have only to add&#44; that 
but little exception would ever have been taken to 
the verse &#34;Let us make man&#44;&#34; had it not been&#44; that 
in accordance with the doctrines of the heathens the 
plurality of the deity had been promulgated by a sect 
deriving their faith and their laws from our holy code&#44; 
only with such exceptions as would tend to make 
them more pleasant and easy to the larger mass of 
Adam&#39;s descendants&#44; who might not wish to be bound 
down by abstract ideas&#44; which they had not the ripe 
intelligence to understand&#44; and a multiplicity of cere&#8211; 
monial observances of which they knew not the mean&#8211; 
ing. &#8212; And of all the abstract tenets of our Heaven&#8211; 
born religion&#44; against which the heathens most strove&#44; 
and which was ever the most unintelligible to their 
besotted minds&#44; the belief in one God&#44; undivided 
and immutable&#44; must be preeminently distinguished&#59; 
since the very simplicity of this faith was to them 
quite inconprehensible&#59; for there&#44; where their priests 
most pretended to mysteries and secrecy&#44; our teachers 
were candid and open&#59; hence those of our nation&#44; who 
brought a reformed religion to these heathens&#44; re&#8211; 
tained a multiplicity of the deity&#44; whilst in conformity 
Avith their own belief they promulgated the worship 
of the one God.

of the world&#44; the Nazarenes maintain&#44; is taught in

282 THE MESSIAH. 

Genesis iii. 15&#44; where we read as a continuation of 
the curse upon the serpent &#58; &#34; And enmity I will put 
between thee and between the woman&#44; and between 
thy seed and her seed&#59; he shall bruise thee in the 
head&#44; and thou shalt wound him in the heel.&#34; This 
verse is so explained to favour the idea of the atone&#8211; 
ment so often already alluded to &#58; &#34; Enmity should 
arise between Satan or the devil&#44; who had entered 
the body of the serpent to tempt Eve&#44; and between 
the woman and her race &#59; still the seed of the woman&#44; 
meaning the god&#8211;man&#44; should ultimately overcome 
the power of Satan&#44; but he should thereby suffer the 
loss of his material life&#44; which is represented under 
the words of &#42; he shall bruise thy head&#44; and thou shalt 
wound his heels.&#39; &#34; &#8212; This explanation is according to 
the opinion entertained by a vast majority of the&#39;fol&#8211; 
lowers of the new creed&#59; a majority&#44; I say&#44; for there 
is among them a great multitude who differ very 
widely in their doctrines from the majority. But it 
needs not much sagacity to see&#44; that this mode of com&#8211; 
menting would lead to making the Bible&#8211;text mean 
any thing or nothing. If it is offered as a mere ac&#8211; 
commodation of certain views to this or any other 
text&#44; we can have but small objecti9n to make&#59; for 
then it would amount to no more than seeking a mere 
parallel in words the real obvious meaning of which 
is something very different&#59; and such fanciful con&#8211; 
struction can in nowise serve as argument. &#8212; But&#44; if 
the doctrines so fancifully supported are forced upon 
us as of fundamental importance&#44; and as proved by 
the holy Text&#58; then&#44; indeed we must solemnly protest 
against any such assumption. &#8212; It must however be 
evident&#44; that the curse was levelled against the veri&#8211; 

<pb n="283"/>

THE MESSIAH. 283 

table serpent&#44; the so&#8211;called snake&#44; which in truth 
now has the qualities denounced in the curse. How 
this serpent could have spoken and tempted our first 
parents is indeed more than&#44; I believe&#44; any man is 
able to tell precisely&#44; and we must reckon the whole 
account amongst those mysteries into which our re&#8211; 
search cannot fully penetrate. But we have the Bible 
as our warrant for believing that&#44; allured in an ex&#8211; 
traordinary manner&#44; and greatly prompted by curi&#8211; 
osity. Eve tasted the forbidden fruit&#44; and Adam by 
her tempted&#44; sinned with her. In his indignation&#44; 
coupled with mercy&#44; the Almighty called our pa&#8211; 
rents&#44; Avho had forfeited their life&#44; to an account for 
their misconduct&#44; and ordained their punishment&#44; 
and also that of their original tempter. Before their 
sin there was no death&#44; and the lion therefore slew 
not the innocent steer&#44; the wolf devoured not the 
harmless lamb&#44; the kite&#39;s destructive talons dealt not 
death to the hen and her brood&#44; not in circling eddies 
pursued his prey the eagle&#44; nor in the cleft of the 
barren rock lay the coils of the poisonous viper. 
But sin changed the harmony of nature&#59; and the 
beasts of the field broke their truce with man&#44; and 
those that had hitherto been harmless and playful 
now strode abroad with the eager desire for slaugh&#8211; 
ter&#44; armed with the voracious mouth&#44; with the sharp&#8211; 
ened talon&#44; or with the destroying&#44; withering fang &#58; 
and thus the former companions&#44; and among them 
the tempting&#44; glowing&#44; beautiful serpent&#44; became the 
enemies and terror of man. Still&#44; though hated&#44; his 
dominion was not to cease over God&#39;s creation&#44; and&#44; 
therefore&#44; power was left him to crush the serpent&#39;s 
head&#44; literally crush it&#44;&#44; although the latter was armed

for deadly strife. Where in this is there any evident 
allusion to a redeeming Messiah &#61; We pause for an 
answer. Now&#44; we will even grant&#44; that in this de&#8211; 
nunciation of the tempter God had an allusion to the 
power of man over sin&#58; still&#44; what reference can that 
have to the I&#58;Nazarene doctrine of a redeemer&#44; who is 
to be both god and man&#61; &#8212; And to illustrate our 
subject more clearly&#44; and to show that our view is 
supported by other texts in the Bible&#44; and that it is 
sin only which exposes us to the enmity of the beasts 
of the field&#44; but that virtue will remove the danger&#44; 
let us refer to the sublime Psalm&#44; written by the 
prophet Moses&#44; and the man wdio best knew the 
ways of Grod with man. It is in the Psalm xci. 10&#8211; 
13&#44; we read &#58; &#39;&#39; no evil shall befal thee&#44; and no plague 
shall approach thy tent. For his angels will He give 
charge concerning thee to guard thee in all thy ways. 
On hands shall they bear thee&#44; that thou mayest not 
dash against a stone thy foot. On leopard and adder 
shalt thou tread&#44; thou shalt tread down the lion&#39;s 
whelp and serpent.&#34; It is thus seen that sin arms 
nature against us&#44; and by virtue we obtain peace&#59; 
and this is the doctrine which is taught also in Gen. 
iii. 15. 

The elucidation of these two points has unexpect&#8211; 
edly detained us so long&#44; that for to&#8211;day it will not be 
practicable to go through the whole important sub&#8211; 
jects in dispute&#44; and time&#44; therefore&#44; is left us to speak 
of but one more. &#8212; In the blessing given to Abram&#44; 
when God ordered him to leave his father&#39;s house&#44; 
we read&#44; among others &#40;Genesis xii. 3&#41; the following&#58; 
&#34;And I will bless those that bless thee&#44; and him that 
curses thee&#44; I will curse&#44; and through thee all families 

<pb n="285"/>

of the earth shall be blest.&#34; Were any one to read 
for the first time this annunciation of happiness&#44; he 
never would imagine that any other than the Patri&#8211; 
arch himself is spoken of&#44; and those immediately con&#8211; 
nected with him by family descent. But no&#44; this 
simple and obvious mode of commenting on the Text 
is not satisfactory to our Nazarene interpreters&#44; and 
they again make this passage also subservient to an 
announcement of the coming of their messiah. They 
accordingly say &#58; &#34; That this crowning blessing refers 
to the messiah the divinity&#44; 1&#44; in whom only all that 
are blessed are blessed&#59; 2&#44; in whom all that believe&#44; 
of whatever family they may be&#44; are&#8211; blessed&#59; 3&#44; in 
whom some of all nations are blessed&#59; 4&#44; since there 
are some blessings&#44; such as the new law propagated 
under his name&#44; which are common to all mankind.&#34; 
I again extract almost verbatim from the book of high 
authority already referred to&#44; and consequently the ar&#8211; 
gument is fairly stated. l&#33;Tow we have no objection 
to admit that the Messiah whom we expect is to be 
the crowning blessing&#44; perhaps he also may have 
been alluded to in the promise made to Abraham&#44; 
as also our sages teach &#58; &#34; The Messiah&#39;s name was 
created before this earth was made.&#34; But that&#44; never&#8211; 
theless&#44; Abram himself and all Israel his descendants 
are at least included&#44; is evident&#44; first from the very 
context of which the verse quoted makes a part. Sec&#8211; 
ondly from the blessing given to Isaac&#44; &#34; And I will 
multiply thy descendants like the stars of heaven&#44; and 
I will give to thy descendants all these lands &#59; and 
there shall bless themselves in &#40;or through&#41; thy de&#8211; 
scendants all the nations of the earth &#34; &#40;Gen. xxvi. 4&#41;.

And lastly&#44; tlie promise to Jacob&#44; from the portion 
read this day&#44; as the day&#39;s lecture &#58; 

&#34;And thy descendants shall be as numerous as tlie dust of the 
earth&#44; and thou shalt spread out to the East&#44; the West&#44; the North&#44; 
and the South&#44; and in thee and in thy seed all the families of the 
earth shall be blest.&#34; Gen. xxviii. 14. 

Can any words more phiinly say&#44; that the seed 
spoken of shall not be only one individual&#44; but a peo&#8211; 
ple&#44; a numerous people&#44; who shall proclaim the glory 
of God in the heathens&#39; lands &#61; And who are this 
people &#61; who but the children in the flesh&#44; as well as 
spirit&#44; of Abraham&#44; Isaac&#44; and Jacob&#44; to whom God 
made his covenant known &#61; &#8212; True&#44; these descendants 
now are despised&#44; their countenance is marred&#44; their 
wisdom slighted &#59; but who knows not that arrive will 
that bright day&#44; when their light will indeed shine&#44; 
when from them teachers will go out and proclaim 
God&#39;s name to the far islands of the sea&#61; &#8212; The time 
is delayed&#44; because of our sins&#44; but come it will&#44; and 
then God will be declared One&#44; and his name will be 
One. 

Do Thou our Father &#33; hasten this time&#44; for to Thee 
are our eyes directed&#59; and do Thou comfort those 
that mourn for their sins&#44; and seek salvation in Thee 
only&#44; who art our Father&#44; King&#44; and Redeemer&#33; 
Amen.

DISCOURSE XLVI. 

THE MESSIAH. 
No. III. 

Remembee us&#44; Lord &#33; in thy kindness&#44; and have 
mercy upon us&#44; the erring and scattered flock&#44; and 
raise unto us a shepherd&#44; who shall guide us in thy 
holy name&#44; and send unto us a prophet who shall 
again instruct us of thy will. Cause us&#44; also&#44; to be&#8211; 
hold thy glory&#44; when Thou again wilt dwell before 
our eyes in Jerusalem&#44; thy holy city&#44; as in days of 
old and as in years of former times. Amen. 

Brethren&#33; 

If one were to form his ideas of prophecy from the 
vague assertions which are constantly hazarded re&#8211; 
jecting it &#58; he would assuredly never arrive at any 
satisfactory knowledge concerning this great fund of 
divine wisdom&#44; which God in his kindness transmitted 
to us through a long succession of holy and inspired 
men&#44; who went out&#44; and spoke&#44; and wrought awful 
things&#44; by and through his sacred name and power. 
To believe every thing&#44; therefore&#44; which is alleged 
to be founded on prophecy would be to believe ab&#8211; 
surdities and contradictions innumerable&#59; for the 
recklessness of false interpreters has dared to invade 
even this sanctuary of God&#44; and to fortify their errors 
and falsities bv arguments deduced therefrom. It is 
accordingly the manifest duty of every Israelite&#44; who 

<pb n="288"/>

288 THE MESSIAH. 

truly confides in the faith in which his forefathers be&#8211; 
lieved&#44; lived&#44; suffered&#44; and died&#44; to arrive at a certain 
and fixed knowledge of the dosrmas on which his be&#8211; 
lief is founded&#44; and to endeavour to attain a sufficient 
understanding of the sacred Text&#44; to be able at one 
glance to distinguish the false from the true&#44; the evil 
from the good&#44; the absurd from the reasonable. In 
short&#44; ignorance of his religion and its tenets is&#44; in a 
Jew&#44; a positive crime&#44; which nothing but an inability 
to arrive at knowledge can in the least excuse. And 
in the same measure as knowledge derivable from in&#8211;&#42; 
struction conveyed by others is difficult of access to 
any man&#44; he is bound to search the Scriptures for 
himself&#44; and&#44; with an humble diffidence in his own 
power of discernment&#44; to proceed upon the princi&#8211; 
ples which have been handed down to us&#44; and which 
are so widely and universally disseminated&#44; that 
hardly any one&#44; called an Israelite&#44; can be absolutely 
ignorant of the whole of them&#44; unless he never has 
enjoyed the blessings of converse and intercourse 
with his brethren in faith. &#8212; It being thus admitted 
that every one ought to learn&#44; it follows as a natural 
consequence that every one&#44; capable of teaching&#44; 
should endeavour to disseminate the knowledge that 
is within him&#44; to propagate as far as in him lies&#44; and 
to perpetuate to the extent of his abilities&#44; the knowl&#8211; 
edge and the love of the truth&#44; which is at last the 
same with the knowledge and love of God&#44; since tlie 
God to whom Israel bend in submission&#44; since the 
Lord whom we worship&#44; is Himself the truth. 

In furtherance of this object let us revert to the 
exposition of prophecies applied by our opponents to 
fortify their doctrines of the Messiah in opposition to 

<pb n="289"/>

THE MESSIAH. 289 

ours. A variety of passages referring to the alleged 
plurality of the deity and to a saving redeemer has 
already been expounded&#44; and it has been shown that 
no literal explanation will warrant the doctrines al&#8211; 
leged to be drawn from them&#44; and a fanciful commen&#8211; 
tary can never&#44; and ought never&#44; to be taken&#44; or even 
urged as argument. The number of similar passages 
being very great&#44; it would no doubt be useful to go 
over the whole ground&#59; but it is time that a con&#8211; 
nected view should be concisely exhibited&#44; and the 
subject speedily closed. I am therefore compelled to 
select but a few more&#44; and leave the remainder for 
some future and more fitting opportunity. To pro&#8211; 
ceed however without farther preface&#44; I must draw 
your attention to the fact that the Nazarenes of every 
degree have entertained as a favourite notion&#44; that 
the time of the advent of the Messiah was so dis&#8211; 
tinctly pointed out&#44; that his appearance at a certain 
stated and fixed period was absolutely necessary to 
verify the predictions relating to him. &#8212; Predictions&#44; 
therefore&#44; have been selected&#44; and many and varied 
arguments have been adduced to prove&#44; that they have 
been fulfilled to the letter at a certain given period in 
bygone times. &#8212; One of the most favourite of this 
kind is found in Genesis xlix. 10 &#58; 

which is rendered &#58; 

&#39; The sceptre shall not depart from Judah&#44; nor the lawgiver from 
between his feet&#44; until Shiloh come &#59; and unto him shall the gath&#8211; 
ering of the people be.&#34; 

VOL. II. 25

290 THE MESSIAH. 

The interpretation of this translation is so given by 
the IsTazarenes &#58; The kingdom when once given to 
Judah&#44; which was accomphshed in the person of 
David&#44; son of Jesse&#44; a resident of Bethlehem&#44; in Ju&#8211; 
dah&#44; should never depart from the tribe of Judah or 
from those immediately connected with it&#44; till the 
time that Shiloh shall come&#44; to whom the nations 
should assemble &#59; but immediately before his coming 
the kingdom should cease&#44; which&#44; it is said farther&#44; 
was accomplished at the accession of Herod&#44; of Edu&#8211; 
mean descent&#44; at the downfall of Hyrcanus the Sec&#8211; 
ond&#44; the last of the Asmonean princes. And very 
often indeed has this prophecy of Jacob been tri&#8211; 
umphantly advanced&#44; together with the assertion&#44; 
that&#44; since the Israelitish kingdom is extinct&#44; there&#8211; 
fore the Messiah must have come. &#8212; But in answer to 
this bold affirmation&#44; even allowing that there should 
be no error in the common Bible&#8211;translation as adopt&#8211; 
ed by all IN&#39;azarenes&#44; we must as boldly maintain that 
the alleged fullilment tallies in nowise with the Text&#59; 
and&#44; strange as it may appear&#44; that an assertion of so 
many learned and philosophical men should be totally 
erroneous&#44; the fact is nevertheless so. In the first 
place&#44; if Jacob meant to say&#44; that Judah&#39;s descend&#8211; 
ants should always be the cliiefs of the nation of Is&#8211; 
rael&#44; then the prophecy never was fulfilled&#59; for&#44; up 
to the time of David&#44; at least six hundred years from 
Jacob&#39;s departure&#44; there was no preeminent prince 
from Judah&#39;s tribe. But grant that the meaning 
should be&#44; that from the commencement of the king&#8211; 
dom it should never cease till the coming of the 
Messiah&#58; then he ought to have come&#44; according to 
the most moderate calculation&#44; four hundred years 

<pb n="291"/>

THE MESSIAH. 291 

before the alleged advent&#44; or according to some chro&#8211; 
nologists&#44; six hundred years. For&#44; when Zedekiah was 
captured by the Chaldeans after his flight from Jeru&#8211; 
salem&#44; the kingdom of Judah actually ceased&#59; and 
no history that I know of has left us any record&#44; that 
any other king from the family of David ever reigned&#44; 
even for one single day&#44; over the restored Jews&#44; in&#8211; 
cluding Judah&#44; Benjamin&#44; and Levi&#44; much less over 
the hitherto never restored kingdom of Israel. And 
to say&#44; that the rule of satraps under the Persian tu&#8211; 
telage and dominion can be called the wie&#39;lding of the 
sceptre implied in the prophecy&#44; is evidently using a 
standard of criticism not applicable to Scripture &#59; and&#44; 
farther&#44; to sav that the kino&#59;dom of the Asmonean 
princes&#44; who were descendants of Aaron&#44; and conse&#8211; 
quently not belonging to the tribe of Judah&#44; was also 
in accordance with the prophecy&#44; is perfectly absurd&#59; 
for the blessing was addressed to Judah only and not 
to Levi inclusive&#44; and therefore it is not possible to 
suppose that the fultilment in the persons of Levi&#39;s 
descendants could at all verify the prediction with re&#8211; 
gard to Judah. And for that matter&#44; since Herod 
was a professing Jew&#44; as nearly all the people called 
Edumeans were in those days &#58; he might have been 
included in tlie prediction according to the above lat&#8211; 
itudinarian exposition &#40;for&#44; according to our laws&#44; the 
proselyte is equal with the native son of Israel&#41;&#44; if 
such an explanation had suited the. &#33;N&#34;azarene creed. 
If then this prophecy meant that Messiah must come 
as soon as Judah&#39;s sceptre be broken&#44; Zedekiah&#39;s 
flight ought to have been the time&#59; and therefore&#44; if 
the argument is good against our hopes of a coming 
Messiah&#44; it is good also against the belief of those

differing from us&#44; as has been amply shown&#44; and I 
doubt whether evasions ever so subtle will be able to 
countervail the plain reasoning just exhibited. But&#44; 
it is likely&#44; highly likely&#44; that the common version is 
incorrect&#44; and accordingly a translation has been 
given by various persons of our people and those 
agreeing with them&#44; which gives the prophecy quite 
a different appearance&#44; and it is then perfectly recon&#8211; 
cilable both to prophecy and history. The differ&#8211; 
ence depends upon the meaning of the two particles 
o ij&#59; which when united as one compound mean un&#8211; 
til that&#59; but i&#59;&#59; by itself is often applied to designate 
eternity&#44; and should then be rendered with for ever &#59; 
and o by itself means because&#44; for&#44; inasmuch&#44; or&#44; in 
short&#44; is a particle denoting the consequence of an 
antecedent sentence. If then we sever these words 
and connect one with the first&#44; and the other with 
the second part of the verse&#44; it should be rendered 
thus &#58; &#34; The sceptre shall not depart from Judah&#44; and 
the lawgiver not from between his feet &#40;that is&#44; from 
his descendants&#41; for ever&#44; inasmuch as the Shiloh 
shall come&#44; and to him shall be the assemblage of the 
nations.&#34; If this interpretation is correct&#44; and it is 
certainly perfectly reconcilable to the Hebrew&#42; id&#8211; 
iom &#58; Jacob meant to say&#44; that Judah should be the 
chief tribe&#44; which indeed it was&#44; both in the number 
and the bravery of its men &#59; that from it should go 
out the rulers of the nation&#59; and that&#44; if ever through 
the means of transgressions the kingdom should be 

&#42; The accent on n&#94; is a disjunctive&#44; which would evidently imply&#44; 
that&#44; according to the Massoratists&#44; it is not connected with the 
word &#94;3.

removed for a time&#44; the removal should not be ever&#8211; 
lasthig&#59; for the king Messiah should arise&#44; to whom 
all nations are to assemble to learn of him the laws 
of God&#44; in which they are to walk&#44; and which they 
are all ultimately to obey. It would appear from this&#44; 
that the chief excellence which Judah was to have 
above his brothers&#44; over Reuben&#44; because he had 
grievously sinned&#44; and over Simeon and Levi&#44; be&#8211; 
cause by their headstrong violence they had grieved 
their father and done injustice to others&#44; and over 
the others because over them he had the right of 
prior birth&#44; was to consist in the descent of the Mes&#8211; 
siah from his family&#44; in whom the kingdom and the 
legislation were for ever to remain&#44; and who was to 
be the harbinger of peace and knowledge to all man&#8211; 
kind. We merely wish to ask&#44; has such a personage&#44; 
uniting these qualities&#44; ever been known on earth &#61; 
and where then is the hopelessness which the world 
says is ours in looking forward for his coming &#61; 

Having said thus much already in elucidation of 
this verse&#44; it is with extreme diffidence that I venture 
to ofier views of my own on the subject&#44; especially 
as I am ignorant whether I am supported in them by 
others or not. &#8212; But trusting that the matter has also 
a considerable share of interest for you&#44; my brethren&#44; 
I will even continue&#44; and throw myself on your in&#8211; 
dulgence for detaining you longer on this point&#44; than 
may seem at first sight necessary. &#8212; In looking over 
the Scriptures with reference to the doctrines of the 
Messiah&#44; I have been so struck with the extreme 
unity of agreement of the various prophets&#44; as to 
amount to astonishment. Much as I had read before&#44; 
often as I had studied the oracles of our faith &#58; I yet 

25&#42;

found new cause for admiration over the extreme 
beauty and harmony discoverable in the scheme of 
revelation which we possess&#44; and I was filled with 
thankfulness&#44; that we have been permitted to inherit 
such a store of rich blessings&#44; full of wisdom and con&#8211; 
solation. Long before our times&#44; said a sacred singer &#58; 
&#34;Had not thy law been my entertainment&#44; I long 
since would have perished in my misery &#59; &#34; and well 
may Israel collectively say now what the holy seer 
exclaimed in bygone days&#44; when the spirit of pro&#8211; 
phecy was yet rife on earth. In judging therefore 
of any one passage which may be presented to us&#44; we. 
must not regard it as one isolated sentence&#44; but as a 
part of a great scheme&#44; with which it must&#44; and un&#8211; 
doubtedly does&#44; agree. If then we even admit&#44; that 
the received version of the Nazarenes is correct&#44; it 
certainly will not militate against our religion. For&#44; 
the verse in question contains a twofold promise &#58; of 
the sceptre&#44; and the lawgiver&#44; or rather law&#8211;dispenser. 
It would accordingly mean&#44; that both&#44; the kingdom 
and the dispensation of the divine law&#44; should never 
be at the same time taken from Judah&#39;s descendants&#44; 
up to the time when Messiah should hold universal 
dominion over the earth. And thus the kingdom 
conferred on Judah shall never cease&#59; and though 
Judah&#39;s immediate descendants did not at once hold 
the sway&#44; yet at a later period David was chosen&#44; and 
in him began the commencement of the fulfilment&#59; 
and with regard to the continuance thereof after a 
suspension &#40;understand a suspension&#44; but not an abo&#8211; 
lition&#41; of the kingdom we have an ample account in 
the book of the prophecies of Jeremiah. Jeremiah 
lived during the reigns of the latter kings of Judah&#44; 

<pb n="295"/>

when the wickedness of the people had rendered 
them ripe for destruction&#59; he was accordingly deputed 
to predict the death or downfall of three kings &#58; Je&#8211; 
hojakim&#44; Jochoniah&#44; and Zedekiah&#44; through the king 
of the Chaldeans&#44; Nebuchadnezzar. After stating 
the utter subversion of the kingdom of Judah&#44; and 
testifying against Jochoniah that none of his descend&#8211; 
ants should ever rule over the land of Israel&#44; he con&#8211; 
tinues &#40;xxxiii. 7&#41; as follows&#58; &#34;And I will bring back 
the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel&#44; and 
I will build them up as at the first.&#34; And in verse 
14&#44; we read in continuation &#58; &#34;Behold days are com&#8211; 
ing&#44; saith the Lord&#44; when I will fulfil that good word 
which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel 
and concerning the house of Judah. In those days&#44; 
and at that time I will cause to grow unto David the 
sprout of righteousness&#44; and he shall execute justice 
and righteousness in the land. In those days shall 
Judah be helped&#44; and Jerusalem shall dwell in safety&#44; 
and this is what she shall be called&#44; The Lord our 
Righteousness. For thus hath said the Lord&#44; There 
shall never be wanting unto David a man to sit upon 
the throne of the house of Israel &#58; and unto the priests 
the Levites there shall not be wanting a man before 
me&#44; to offer &#39;l&#41;urnt&#8211;offerings&#44; and to burn meat&#8211;offer&#8211; 
ing&#44; and to prepare sacrifices at all times.&#34; In the 
same manner too spoke Hosea &#40;iii. 4&#44; 5&#41;&#58; &#34;For many 
days shall Israel abide without a king&#44; and without a 
prince&#44; and without a sacrifice&#44; and without a standing 
image&#44; and without an ephod and theraphim. After 
that will the children of Israel return and seek for 
the Lord their God&#44; and David their king&#59; and fear&#8211; 
ing will they hasten to the Lord and his goodness in

the latter days.&#34; Also to David it was said by IN&#39;atliaii 
the prophet &#40;2 Samuel vii. 16&#41; &#58; &#34;And thy house and 
thy kingdom shall be steadfast for ever before me &#59; 
thy throne shall be established for ever.&#34; These ex&#8211; 
tracts will give lis a convincing commentaiy on Jacob&#39;s 
prophecy&#44; and all tend to show that the suspension 
of the kingdom during the long&#8211;endured captivity 
does not indicate that the reign of Judah is over&#59; on 
the contrary they prove that the time will come&#44; when 
the captives of Judah and Israel will all be gathered&#44; 
and over them shall rule the king descended from 
David &#59; and to quiet the fears which some might en&#8211; 
tertain at the length of the captivity and the threat&#8211; 
ened extinction of David&#39;s line&#44; the Lord promised 
that never should that time arrive&#44; when there should 
be wanting a man to David&#44; capable of holding sway&#59; 
for He distinctly stated&#44; at the very time that both 
kingdom and temple ceased&#44; when both chief and 
priest were banished&#44; that Aaron no less than David 
should always be blessed with capable successors&#44; 
ready and able to tread in their fathers&#39; footsteps. 
Although&#44; therefore&#44; the regular tables of descent 
have been lost in the long course of persecutions &#58; 
there are yet numbers who boast of a descent from 
David&#44; and thousands there are&#44; whom the universal 
voice of Israel hails as the offspring of Aaron&#44; the 
Lord&#39;s anointed&#44; and at all festivals the priestly bless&#8211; 
ings are dispensed by those who are sanctified with 
the commands given to the father of all the priests. &#8212; 
And lastly&#44; with regard to the lawgivers and those 
to whom the law of God is familiar&#44; we may simply 
state&#44; that at no time has the lawgiver been removed 
from the feet of Judah &#59; for never yet was that time&#44; 

<pb n="297"/>

THE MESSIAH. 297 

when the law had not its friends&#44; cultivators&#44; and ex&#8211; 
pounders. And in the same spirit spoke Isaiah &#40;lix. 
21&#41; &#58; &#42;&#39; And my covenant with them is this&#44; saith the 
Lord&#44; My spirit which is upon thee&#44; and my words 
which I have put in thy mouth&#44; shall not depart from 
thy mouth&#44; and out of the mouth of thy children&#44; and 
out of the mouth of thy children&#39;s children&#44; saith the 
Lord&#44; from now and for ever.&#34; This prediction has 
certainly heen accomplished &#59; and more yet&#44; the de&#8211; 
scendants of Judah are at the present moment con&#8211; 
stituting the greatest part of the Jews&#44; and moreover 
the descendants of David are not extinct. Farther&#8211; 
more&#44; the suspension of the kingly rule was accord&#8211; 
ing to the prophecies&#44; and to avenge the many crimes 
of the Israelites &#58; what contradiction does our belief 
then oiFer to the prophecy of Jacob&#61; or rather are 
not our hope&#44; and our belief&#44; and the foretelling of 
our prophets of a later period confirmatory of&#44; and 
conformable to&#44; and best explaining&#44; the closing in&#8211; 
spiration of the dying Israel &#61; &#8212; Assuredly&#44; brethren&#44; 
and it requires a hardihood&#44; not very enviable in the 
possessor&#44; to assert&#44; that we are feeding on a vain 
hope and indulging in a fruitless longing. &#8212; On the 
contrary&#44; oui&#39; trust is firmly placed &#8212; placed on the 
word&#42;of Him who does not err&#44; and all whose ways 
are just and true &#33; 

Having dismissed this subject&#44; although much could 
have been added which would have the stronger con&#8211; 
firmed our views of a redeemer yet to come&#58; we will 
now turn to chapter xviii. of Deuteronomy&#44; beginning 
at verse 14. &#8212; We read there as follows&#58; &#34;For those 
nations&#44; which thou shalt drive out&#44; listen unto ob&#8211; 
servers of time and diviners&#58; but as for thee&#44; the Lord 

<pb n="298"/>

thy God hath not suffered thee to do the like. A pro&#8211; 
phet from among thyself&#44; from thy own brethren&#44; like 
unto me&#44; will the Lord thy&#39; God raise up unto thee &#59; 
to him ye shall hearken.&#39;&#39; When we consider to 
whom Moses spoke&#44; and what He knew himself to 
he &#58; it is wonderful and surpassing strange&#44; how any 
one could apply so plain a passage&#44; not to a prophet&#44; 
but to a redeeming Messiah. And more wonderful 
still it is&#44; that the Kazarenes of every shade and com&#8211; 
plexion refer to it&#44; as a convincing argument hi favour 
of their assumed theory. To enable you&#44; however&#44; to 
judge of the fairness of the interpretation&#44; adopted by 
the people referred to&#44; I will now lay before you an 
abstract of the favourite work&#44;&#42; already spoken of on 
a former occasion. These are the words &#58; &#34; Some 
think it is the promise of a succession of prophets&#44; 
that should for many ages be kept up in Israel. &#8212; 
These prophets were like unto Moses&#44; though far in&#8211; 
ferior to him&#44; Dent&#44; xxxiv. 10. &#8212; Whether a succession 
of prophets be included in this promise or not&#44; we are 
sure that it is primarily intended as a promise of 
Messiah&#44; and it is the clearest promise of him that is 
in all the law of Moses.&#34; &#8212; &#34;Observe&#44;&#34; continues this 
writer&#44; &#34;what it is&#44; that is here promised concerning 
Messiah&#59; what God promised Moses at Mount Sinai&#44; 
which he relates&#44; verse 18&#44; which he promised the 
people&#44; verse 15&#44; in God&#39;s name&#59; 1. That there should 
come a prophet&#44; great above all the prophets&#44; by whom 
God would make known himself and Jiis will to the 
children of men&#44; more fully and clearly than ever he 
had done before. He is the light of the ivorld&#44; as proph&#8211; 

&#42; Matthew Henry&#39;s Commentaries.

ecy was of the Jewish church. 2. That God would 
raise Mm up from the midst of them. In his birth he 
should be one of that nation. In his resurrection he 
should be raised up at Jerusalem&#44; and from thence his 
doctrine should go forth to all the world. &#8212; 3. That 
he should be a prophet like unto Moses&#44; only as much 
above him&#44; as the other prophets came short of him. &#8212; 
4. That God would put his ivords in his mouth&#44; verse 
18. What messages God had to send to the children 
of men&#44; he would send by him&#44; and give him full in&#8211; 
structions what to say and do as a prophet.&#34; &#8212; It is 
needless to extract any farther&#44; having in the fore&#8211; 
going exhibited the entire strength of the argument&#44; 
Now&#44; I am unable to perceive what we can lose by 
even admitting the construction thus falsely placed 
on Moses&#39;s prophecy&#59; for granting it perfectly correct 
and legitimate&#44; w&#8211;e might still say and aver&#44; that we 
expected the fulfilment as yet to come. But&#44; much 
as we might gladly refer this annunciation to the great 
messenger&#44; to whose coming Israel has ever looked 
forward with hope and with prayer&#58; candour and 
truth compel us to discard such an explanation &#59; since 
the whole context plainly shows&#44; that by the succes&#8211; 
sors of Moses are understood those men&#44; who pro&#8211; 
mulgated&#44; aiier the great teacher&#39;s demise&#44; the law 
and knowledge of God&#8211;&#44; and to no one else. What 
was it the Israelites had asked at Tloreb&#61; It was 
that&#44; not desiring any more to see themselves the 
glory of God evidently revealed&#44; fearing to die in case 
a public legislation&#44; like that on Sinai&#44; were repeated&#44; 
they wished for a mediator to announce to them in 
future the will of God&#44; and that they would be willing

as mucli as those announced to tliem by tlae Lord 
himself. God having once given them in his honour 
and glory the standard of the ten precepts upon which 
He wished to found the entire code of laws lie in&#8211; 
tended promulgating&#44; was satisfied with this request &#59; 
He ordered&#44; therefore&#44; the people to return home to 
their usual occupations&#44; but told Moses to remain on 
the mount&#44; to be farther instructed of the ways and 
will of his Maker. What&#44; now&#44; was the request of 
Israel &#61; not for a redeemer to save their souls&#44; or to 
go abroad to give light unto the heathens&#44; not for a 
mediator to die for their transgressions and to atone 
for the sin of Adam &#59; but simply for one or more per&#8211; 
sons&#44; human beings&#44; to let them know whatever might 
be God&#39;s wish and will. In granting them this rea&#8211; 
sonable request&#44; the answer ought evidently be like 
the question&#59; and consequently God granted what 
the people asked&#58; they asked for a teacher&#44; and a 
teacher was vouchsafed. Moses&#44; the first prophet in 
rank and holiness&#44; was the first deputed&#44; and not to 
leave the flock without a shepherd&#44; successors in the 
prophetic calling were promised&#59; and not only prom&#8211; 
ised&#44; but also set&#44; to yet farther speak&#44; exhort&#44; teach&#44; 
and admonish them in the name of the King of kings&#44; 
the God of Israel. And thus there were the warrior 
Joshua&#44; valiant and true&#59; the righteous Samuel&#44; who 
judged the people after the manner of Moses&#59; the 
king David who never&#44; forgot&#44; even when sunk through 
sin&#44; to return with prayer to his oflended Maker&#59; and 
after him Elijah who never sufiered the pangs of 
earthly dissolution&#59; the inspired Elisha who poured 
water on Elijah&#39;s hands&#59; Isaiah whose greatness of 
endowment&#44; fervour of piety&#44; and high descent&#44; alike

mark him eminent among the holy of the earth&#59; again 
the ardent Jeremiah&#44; the man of sorrow&#44; whose eyes 
behekl&#44; in the desolation of the holy city&#44; what Moses 
already had foreseen &#59; and Malachi too&#44; the last among 
these preachers&#44; who again exhorted the people of 
the second temple to remain steadfast to the law given 
through Moses&#59; besides numerous others&#44; who all 
spoke in conformity with the law given through the 
father of all the prophets. And therefore we read in 
continuation&#58; &#34;And it shall be&#44; the man who doth not 
hearken to my words which he may speak in my name&#44; 
I will require it of him. But the prophet who may 
presume to speak a word in my name which I have 
not commanded him to speak&#44; or who may speak in 
the name of other gods&#44; even that prophet shall die.&#34; &#8212; 
Moses therefore evidently speaks of messenger&#8211;pro&#8211; 
phets who&#44; being men&#44; may be liable to be sinful&#44; and 
not of a divinity who from his very nature must&#44; in 
reason&#44; be exempt from sin and falsehood. Besides 
we may boldly challenge the supporters of the above 
argument to produce that passage&#44; where it is said 
that a prophet greater than Moses was to be looked 
for&#61; On the contrary it does appear from the whole 
tenor of revelation that Moses was absolutely to be&#44; 
and for ever&#39;the greatest of his brethren&#44; as it is his 
law&#44; or rather the law called by his name&#44; and given 
through his agency&#44; which is to be the standard of 
the truth or falsehood of any prophet. And even the 
Messiah himself&#44; were he to appear this instant among 
us&#44; and were he to declare in so many words&#44; &#34;The 
son of man is lord even over the Sabbath&#8211;day&#44;&#34; or 
&#34;Eat&#44; for what I have declared clean do thou not call 
unclean&#44;&#34; we would be compelled to disobey &#59; for we

should have to look on such an announcement as a 
temptation purposely put in our way&#44; by which we 
maybe tried&#44; &#34;whether we love the Lord our God 
with all our heart and with all our soul &#34; &#40;compare 
with Deut. xiii. 4&#41;. no I no prophet can of his own 
account&#44; not even by a direct message&#44; abrogate any 
part of the law or add any new precept to the same&#59; 
for the law having been publicly given&#44; and therefore 
not resting for confirmation on any miracles wrought&#44; 
cannot be abolished&#44; except by an equally public act 
of God&#44; similar to the descent on Sinai&#44; and no evi&#8211; 
dence short of this ought ever to satisfy us. &#8212; E&#39;ow it 
will be apparent that&#44; when Moses speaks of a prophet 
like himself&#44; he means one who is to announce his 
mission&#44; just as he himself was wont to do&#44; with 
&#39;n &#39;ir&#58;.x hd &#34; Thus hath said the Lord &#59;&#34; this can only 
apply to a man and not to the Deity. Besides we also 
contend&#44; that the whole passage from the eighteenth 
chapter of Deuteronomy under question must refer to 
one class of persons&#44; as we cannot discover any break 
or want of connexion in the whole message. If 
then the first part refers to the Messiah&#44; the latter part 
must likewise do the same&#59; and can it be believed&#44; 
that the command should be to slay the Messiah&#44; in 
case he should speak falsely in the name of God&#61; can 
it be possible that of one so highly endowed it could 
be presumed that he should predict what would never 
happen&#61; The absurdity of an affirmative to these 
simple questions is too clear to require any farther 
discussion&#59; and consequently the passage does not 
speak of one man but of an entire class&#44; such&#44; as said 
already&#44; were to be&#44; and actually did&#44; make their ap&#8211; 
pearance on earth&#59; and the phrase like me&#44; does not 

<pb n="303"/>

THE MESSIAH. 303 

then absolutely imply equals with Moses&#44; but only 
persons deputed in a similar manner to speak a mes&#8211; 
sage in God&#39;s name&#44; and protected by Him&#44; and in&#8211; 
structed by Him. The prophetic office being thus 
established it was natural enough that wicked men 
should at times speak falsely in the name of God&#59; 
and tests were therefore established by which the 
truth or falsehood of prophecy could be established. &#8212; 
For a long period did these prophets follow each other 
in regular succession&#44; till the scheme of revelation was 
completed&#59; for Moses&#44; let it be understood&#44; was the 
instrument of the law&#44; and consequently in teaching 
all the duties was by no means to write down all the 
religious truths and doctrines. The last was accom&#8211; 
plished more and more by every succeeding prophet&#44; 
till the whole was finished by Malachi&#59; after him the 
prophecy ceased&#44; or rather was suspended&#44; and in him 
we see the last spark of the holy fire yet illuminating 
the earth&#44; before its light was hid for a long period&#44; 
after the announcement of the Lamentations&#44; &#39;&#39;Her 
prophets also found no revelation from the Lord.&#34; 
But we are promised that the time will come&#44; when 
God will pour out his spirit over all flesh&#44; when our 
maidens and our youths will again receive the spirit 
of prophecy&#44;&#39;and when again the glory of God will 
be revealed as of old&#44; &#40;see Joel iii. 1&#44;&#41; and then indeed 
will be again fulfilled the promise made to Moses &#58; &#34; A 
prophet the Lord thy God will raise up to thee from 
among thy brethren&#44; like unto me&#44; him ye shall obey.&#34; 
O Lord&#44; do Thou accomplish this speedily&#44; and may 
we in our days see thy glory&#44; and rejoice in thy salva&#8211; 
tion &#33; Amen.

DISCOURSES XLVII. 

THE MESSIAH. 
No. IV. 

O OUR God&#44; and God of our fathers&#33; in thy just in&#8211; 
dignation Thou didst in former times hurl us out of 
our inheritance because of our sins&#59; and Thou hast 
since then often caused us to pass through fire and 
through water&#44; and given us rulers severe and cruel&#44; 
that we might be taught the difference between serv&#8211; 
ing Thee&#44; the merciful and holy One&#44; and of submit&#8211; 
ting to the yoke of oppressors and enemies&#44; whom our 
transgressions placed over our heads. And long has 
the captivity pressed down our spirit&#44; and we liave re&#8211; 
mained dumb like the sheep before her shearers&#59; we 
have become an object of derision and of contempt to 
nations that are strangers to thy worship&#44; and we have 
been plundered by those who not yet have learnt thy 
service. But by thy holy name Thou hast sworn that 
not for ever should thy anger last&#44; and that Thou 
wouldst at one time remember the captives of Israel&#44; 
and restore them to their land&#59; and that again vine&#8211; 
yards should be planted&#44; and fields tilled in the de&#8211; 
serted hills and wasted plains. may it then be thy 
will soon to fulfil the blissful promise&#44; and may the 
heart of thy servants be gladdened&#44; by the mercies 
which Thou wilt display among them&#44; so that all na&#8211; 
tions may exclaim&#58; &#34;Happy the people to whom the

like has happened&#44; happy the people&#44; whose God is 
the eternal Lord&#39; Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

In reviewing the history of the world we must dis&#8211; 
cover that out of every apparent evil some permanent 
good is produced&#44; and if even individual suffering 
should he the consequence&#44; a puhlic benefit will gen&#8211; 
erally ensue&#44; apparent even to our now views&#44; to the 
imperfect vision of men&#44; who cannot thoroughly un&#8211; 
derstand the reason and connexion of things. This 
being admitted&#44; and who can doubt it&#61; &#8212; it is abso&#8211; 
lutely necessary to believe&#44; that every thing that oc&#8211; 
curs must be beneficial&#44; or in other words&#44; that every 
occurrence will be directed to a beneficial end by the 
Disposer of all. &#8212; If even then we see one nation dis&#8211; 
appear and another spring up from the ruins of the 
other&#39;s greatness&#44; we should not complain of the ap&#8211; 
parent evil&#59; for we may rest assured&#44; that the former 
having fulfilled the circle of its usefulness&#44; the new 
has taken its place as one better calculated to lead 
the way in the measure of improvement which the 
world requires. &#8212; It thus happened&#44; that Egypt flour&#8211; 
ished for a while&#44; nay&#44; Jacob went down there to ac&#8211; 
complish liisv destiny of becoming the great nation&#44; 
and amid tile powerful and civilized race that dwelt 
in the land of the Nile&#44; he and his family grew up 
into a people mighty and distinguished. And when&#34; 
the Egyptians oppressed the strangers whom they had 
received as friends&#44; God&#39;s power was displayed&#44; and 
amidst avenging judgments Israel was freed from 
Egyptian thraldom. Still&#44; Egypt was permitted to 
retain its rule&#44; even as the instrument of punishment

to the Israelites&#59; but at length it fell before the north&#8211; 
ern warrior ITebuchaclnezzar&#44; who had trampled down 
the kingdoms and states of Central Asia. lie swept 
like a whirlwind over the world&#44; and his path was over 
ruins of empires and the wreck of cities&#44; and even the 
holy temple was given into his hands&#44; and he broke 
the walls of Jerusalem&#44; and led the people captives 
unto Babylon. &#8212; He had fulfilled his mission&#44; when he 
too was made to feel the awful greatness of the Lord&#44; 
and was taught wisdom from the mouth of God&#39;s ser&#8211; 
vant&#44; and convinced that he had been but an agent in 
a great work&#44; the work of regeneration&#44; constantly 
progressing to a fulfilment. &#8212; Nebuchadnezzar&#39;s king&#8211; 
dom succumbed to Cyrus the Persian&#44; and the Israel&#8211; 
ites were again permitted to dwell in their former 
dwelling&#8211;places&#59; and again was seen the spectacle of 
a powerful nation ruling for a while over extensive 
lands&#44; till its doom was hastened by cruelty and wick&#8211; 
edness&#44; and the consequent moral and phy&#8211; sical degra&#8211; 
dation&#59; and the Grecian Alexander&#44; brushed away&#44; as 
it were&#44; the tottering throne of Darius III.&#44; the last 
ruler in Persia of the successors of the great Cyrus. 
&#8212; A new period seemed now to open&#44; a new era ap&#8211; 
peared to greet the world&#59; refinement chased away 
barbarism&#59; the elegant arts and sciences supplanted 
rudeness and ignorance&#59; and towns arose where mag&#8211; 
nificence and luxury hitherto almost unknown be&#8211; 
came universal. But all this outward elegance&#44; this 
tinsel beauty was weakness itself&#59; it lacked a soul&#59; 
there was not the life of holy truth in all the fabric&#44; 
and it tumbled and was frittered away by the iron 
arm of Roman conquest&#59; and the crazy building of a 
vain&#8211;glorious philosophy&#44; the gaudy show of enervat&#8211;

THE MESSIAH. 307 

ing sensuality&#44; sunk ingloriously before the merciless 
children of conquest that swarmed in numberless le&#8211; 
gions from the shores of the beautiful Italy. Thus 
was transferred the seat of empire from the &#39;Nile to 
the shores of the insignificant Tiber&#44; and Rome was 
hailed the mistress of the world. &#8212; And Judsea too fell 
beneath the resistless power&#44; and the Jewish leaders 
were carried in triumph through the hostile city&#44; and 
those sons of Jacob that had escaped the slaughter 
were driven into slavery and banishment. &#8212; Rome&#39;s 
triumph&#44; however&#44; was not unending&#44; and the town 
that had vainly styled itself eternal was sacked by 
unheard of barbarians breaking forth from the very 
centre of Asia&#44; the cradle of mankind. &#8212; Again&#44; these 
barbarians felt the force of elegance and learning&#44; 
they occupied the fields which they had laid waste&#44; 
and reared kingdoms&#44; and aimed for universal em&#8211; 
pire. &#8212; Well&#8211;nigh had the scheme succeeded&#44; and all 
Europe listened to the command of a chief unknown 
in ancient times&#44; and the head of a religious sect dic&#8211; 
tated laws and disposed of empires from his seat at 
Rome&#44; and dared to call himself God&#39;s vicegerent on 
earth. Every thing seemed at one time to yield to 
this almost magic spell&#44; and kings and nations poured 
out their blaod at the bidding of this fancied power 
for the recdvery of a fancied treasure&#59; and the right 
of thinking and of worshipping God after the dic&#8211; 
tates of his own law was calkd a crime&#44; because it 
gainsaid the doctrines of the Roman pontiff. And 
straightway the torch of persecution was kindled&#44; 
and in every town blazed the stake&#44; and in every 
place was erected the gallows&#44; and in every district 
was set up the scaftbld&#44; to immolate the victims on 

<pb n="308"/>

308 THE MESSIAH. 

the altars of a false belief. Where now was any re&#8211; 
fuge for Israel&#61; &#8212; Hardly had persecution ceased at 
one spot&#44; because of the want of objects for slaughter&#44; 
when the rage for blood showed itself at another&#44; and 
the star of Jacob seemed nigh its setting for ever. 
But again the power&#44; which appeared so strong&#44; was 
broken&#44; and before the words of an humble man na&#8211; 
tions&#44; once ready to strike in its cause&#44; buckled on 
their armour against its head and his supporters&#44; and 
by degrees the fire of persecution was smothered&#44; 
and in some measure was enlargement vouchsafed to 
Israel to recover fresh strength to meet the fulfilment 
of their destiny &#58; &#8212; this was the will of Heaven. &#8212; Who 
can say&#44; after candidly viewing the history of the 
world&#44; as we have just done&#44; that every step has not 
been an improvement&#61; and do we not clearly perceive&#44; 
in all the mutation of empires&#44; the evident finger of 
God displayed in the preservation of our nation amidst 
all the vicissitudes of fortune&#61; There flourished the 
Egptians &#8212; but where are they&#61; the Assyrians &#8212; but 
they are no more&#59; &#8212; the Babylonians &#8212; their very 
memory is forgotten&#59; &#8212; the Persians &#8212; but their em&#8211; 
pire has scarcely left a wreck behind&#59; &#8212; the Grecians 
&#8212; but their very religion is now a theme of ridicule&#44; 
and what remains of their state is not a resemblance 
of its former greatness&#59; &#8212; and lastly&#44; &#8212; the liomans&#44; 
how powerful were they not once&#59; the words&#44; &#8212; &#39;&#39;The 
Senate and the Roman People&#34; struck terror in the 
most distant lands&#59; but long since has this greatness 
ceased&#44; and this terror has not for ages past oppressed 
the world. &#8212; Again&#44; the religion of Kome&#44; after the 
downfall of its empire&#44; which as said&#44; was nigh be&#8211; 
coming universal&#44; has lost its power of harming&#59; for 

<pb n="309"/>

THE MESSIAH. 309 

the nations&#44; wbicli it once kept in subjection&#44; have 
each almost adopted a reformed system&#44; as they term 
it&#44; of their own&#44; and men now legislate on the most 
sacred topics as though the eternal concerns of the 
soul could be regulated like a matter of state policy 
by the voice of a despot&#44; who speaks in the name of 
his people&#44; or by an assembled body of politicians&#44; or 
even at length by some learned philosopher or divine&#44; 
who builds up systems or pulls them down&#44; as it hap&#8211; 
pens to suit his fancy. &#8212; Yet under all circumstances&#44; 
whether as rulers or as slaves&#44; whether prosperous or 
oppressed&#44; we the Israelites have maintained intact 
God&#39;s greatest and best gift &#59; we have preserved the 
law&#44; we have adhered to the revelation from Sinai&#59; 
we have&#44; in a word&#44; continued true to the character 
of a people of God&#44; a beloved treasure &#33; This is no 
vain boasting&#44; this is no idle grandiloquence &#58; no &#8212; 
brethren&#44; it is the sober truth&#44; an undeniable truth&#44; 
which our worst opponents dare not&#44; cannot&#44; gainsay&#33; 
&#8212; But not for our own glorification did the Almighty 
preserve us&#44; not to show us up as something curious 
was all this efi&#58;ected&#59; but for a far nobler end&#44; that we 
might become the means gradually to amend the rest 
of mankind&#44; and at length to be the agents in spread&#8211; 
ing salvatioh&#39;&#44; both temporal and permanent&#44; to the 
ends of the earth. 

Do you now see what is meant by the reign of the 
king Messiah&#61; is it now clear to you what is to be his 
mission &#61; &#8212; what his doings &#61; &#8212; what his character &#61; &#8212; 
Evidently the reign of the Messiah must be one of 
happiness and peace &#59; his mission must&#44; in the first 
instance&#44; be to the Israelites&#44; and then to the rest of 
mankind &#59; his doings in this mission must be distin&#8211; 

<pb n="310"/>

310 THE MESSIAH. 

guishecl by truth&#44; justice&#44; aud rectitude&#59; and his 
character must be Hke that of prophets of old &#8212; hke 
Moses&#44; like Samuel&#44; like Elijah&#44; one of piety&#44; and hope 
and entire singleness with the Lord his God. &#8212; In all 
this he needs not any attributes of divinity&#44; no dele&#8211; 
gation of any more of the divine power than was 
awarded before this to extraordinary men&#44; who acted 
in the name of God and by his will in a sphere of 
greatness and glory which had been marked out for 
them as their proper mission. It will moreover be 
obvious to you&#44; that the advent of such a gifted one&#44; 
endowed above all men with wisdom&#44; with under&#8211; 
standing&#44; and with power&#44; and wholly guided in all 
his acts by a pious will&#44; and protected by divine fa&#8211; 
vour&#44; is an object over which God may be supposed 
to watch &#40;to speak in the language of man&#41; with par&#8211; 
ticular solicitude&#59; and that besides&#44; the period of this 
mission will not be hastened&#44; before every thing on 
the whole earth is in such a state of preparation&#44; that 
the greatest effect can be produced in the shortest 
time&#59; and that&#44; as we are totally ignorant of the 
counsels of God&#44; any farther than He has been pleased 
to communicate them to us through his prophets&#44; 
it would be idle presumption in us to fix this pe&#8211; 
riod with exactness&#44; or to declare the world at one 
time more ripe for the expected coming than the 
other. Let me here at once remark that&#44; therefore&#44; 
it will avail nothing in an argument to assert&#44; that 
the coming of the Messiah must have been fixed by 
prophets for a definite period&#44; because Jews at one 
particular time looked for him with anxiety&#59; for even 
granting that they were really expecting the Messiah 
at the time so often dwelt upon by our opponents&#58; 

<pb n="311"/>

THE MESSIAH. 311 

still that argues nothing more than that the hope of 
deliverance from thraldom was strong in the minds 
of our people&#44; and that they looked forward with 
hope for the arrival of the son of David&#44; to do for 
them at that time what the prophets had announced 
he should do&#44; at what they called &#34; the end of days&#44; &#34; 
meaning a period remote and distant from the time 
of their prophecy. &#8212; Even grant that many persons 
started up&#44; claiming the dignity of Messiah in their 
own persons&#44; and deceiving many hy pretended mira&#8211; 
cles&#59; nay&#44; grant that this feeling of hope was so strong 
that even the learned and the good were deceived&#58; it 
amounts to no more than that&#44; at a period of almost 
unheard&#8211;of distress&#44; our nation&#44; true to their faith&#44; 
looked towards Heaven as the source of their deliver&#8211; 
ance&#44; hut that&#44; for the sake of their great criminality&#44; 
their prayer was not granted&#44; although many were 
misled hy an appearance of a counterfeit fulfilment 
of their wishes. To draw from such a deplorable 
state of confusion and dismay an argument in favour 
of the claims of any individual&#44; chiefly because he 
lived at that very period of time&#44; is basing the claim 
upon a very weak foundation &#59; and bad indeed must 
be that cause which would rest for support upr 
grounds so entirely devgid of cogency and force 

According to the views just exhibited&#44; which are 
but a natural deduction of sound reasoning&#44; without 
a resort to revelation&#44; we have established&#44; that 
a change in the order of things&#44; as relates to the moral 
state of man&#44; may safely be looked for. Secondly&#44; that 
as God always acts through the agency of men&#44; the 
expected change will be wrought through a man 
whom&#44; for the sake of distinction&#44; we will call the 

<pb n="312"/>

312 THE MESSIAH. 

Messiah&#44; or the anomted&#44; chosen&#44; or chief&#44; as the in&#8211; 
strument in the hand of God. Thirdly&#44; that this 
chosen agent will&#44; and must&#44; he eminent in all the 
virtues which adorn human nature&#44; and that his 
mental endowments will correspond with his high 
office. Fourtlily&#44; that the Israelites&#44; the visible evi&#8211; 
dences of God&#39;s power&#44; will be benefitted in a high 
degree by the arrival of the deliverer. And lastly&#44; 
that all nations will&#44; under his reign&#44; be led to a 
knowledge of the true and only God. Having thus 
stated our views&#44; it is now necessary&#44; according to our 
usual custom&#44; to fortify every position by scriptural 
arguments&#44; in order to show that in this&#44; as well as 
in every other consolatory doctrine&#44; Scripture tallies 
with reason. 

Our first position is &#58; &#34; That a change will come over 
the moral state of man.&#39;&#39; Every philanthropist&#44; of 
every age&#44; I am well&#8211;nigh tempted to assert&#44; has re&#8211; 
volved in his mind the means of preventing a resort to 
arms to settle national and individual disputes. But 
as often as one thous&#8211;ht he had discovered the desired 
remedy&#44; some untoward mishap proved that the means 
were inadequate to the end&#44; and that the beautiful 
vision had vanished into thin airy nothing. &#34;&#39; Blood&#8211; 
shed is sinful&#44;&#34; teaches the philanthropist&#59; &#34;War to 
the knife&#44;&#34; is the patriot&#39;s watchword&#44; who sees his

patient endurance of all the hardships and fatigues of 
war. &#8212; Who then can cry out &#39; peace&#44;&#34; when there is 
no peace &#61; where is that concert of action bj&#39; which 
modern diplomacy has assayed to quench the torcli 
of war&#61; and is it not reasonable to presume that all 
new schemes will fail&#44; as all others hitherto have ut&#8211; 
terly failed&#61; But yet&#44; that scheme which in hunuui 
hands is but a Utopian attempt&#44; which can never hope 
for success&#44; in higher keeping will&#44; must&#44; yield the 
blessed fruit&#59; and not for ever shall the brother be&#8211; 
wail the slaughtered brother&#44; nor the father mourn 
for the early&#44; gory&#44; grave of his beloved offspring. 
And&#44; says the prophet&#44; in speaking of human attempts 
&#40;Malachi&#44; chap. i. 4&#41;&#58; &#34;For if Edom even say&#44; &#8212; We 
a&#59; 3 impoverished&#44; but we will return and build tlio 
Wc sted places&#59; but thus saith the Lord of hosts. They 
may indeed build&#44; and I will surely throw down &#59; and 
people will call them&#44; The territory of wickedness&#44; 
and the people against whom the Lord hath indigna&#8211; 
tion for ever more&#59;&#34; &#8212; for not to human hands&#44; not 
to a mortal&#39;s foresight&#44; will the Lord yield the super&#8211; 
intendence of his creation&#44; an interference in his high 
prerogative of Euler of the universe. But in the 
Lord&#39;s own good time will be accomplished wdiat 
Isaiah foretells&#58; 

&#34; And it shall come to pass at the last days&#44; that the mountain of 
the house of the Lord shall be firmly established on the top of the 
mountains&#44; and shall be exalted above the hills &#59; and unto it shall 
flow all the nations.&#34; ii. 2.

And then continues Isaiah&#58; &#34;And many people 
shall go and say&#44; Come ye&#44; and let us go up to tlie 
mountain of the Lord&#44; to the house of the God of 
Jacob&#44; that he may teach us of his ways&#44; and we 
may walk in his paths&#59; for out of Zion shall go forth 
the law&#44; and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem. 
And he will judge among the nations&#44; and decide 
for many people&#44; and they shall beat their swords 
into ploughshares&#44; and their spears into pruning&#8211; 
knives &#58; nation shall not lift up sword against nation&#44; 
and they shall not learn any more war.&#34; &#8212; But little 
need be added in explanation of a text so plain and 
self&#8211;evident. The prophet speaks of a change that 
is to take place&#44; and describes it as twofold &#58; one is&#44; 
the evident exaltation of the religion of the Lord as 
the universal law of the world&#44; and the other&#44; the per&#8211; 
fect state of peace that is to prevail in consequence 
of the adoption of the holy law. &#8212; ISTow this is pre&#8211; 
cisely that condition of society which has been so 
long and so ardently desired&#44; and this we call in one 
word the days of the Messiah&#44; Now&#44; can any one main&#8211; 
tain that this condition has been brought about&#61; is 
there now one law&#44; one faith&#44; and one Glod universally 
acknowledged &#61; is every sword beaten into a plough&#8211; 
share &#61; is every spear turned into a pruning&#8211;knife &#61; 
or rather does not the land resound with preparation 
for strife &#61; do not nations plot each other&#39;s downfall &#61; 
does not daily the deep&#8211;mouthed cannon thunder 
forth death and destruction to its doomed hundreds &#61; 
do not yet hostile fleets from the far North and from 
the distant West sail forth in all the gay array of mar&#8211; 
tial prowess and settle the deep hatred of their rival 
nations in the far golden regions of the sunny East &#61;

And this jou call peace&#61; such discord you call har&#8211; 
mony&#61; &#8212; Or perhaps you imagine that the prophet 
spoke of mental peace&#44; of agreement in religious 
tenetSj of a universal acquiescence in one rule of life. 
&#8212; But even this has not been attained. For how 
many are the creeds now which mankind acknowl&#8211; 
edge &#33; There is the ignorant negro&#44; who literally 
says to the stone&#44; &#34;Thou art my father&#59;&#34; and the 
barbarous South Sea islander&#44; who sacrifices his cap&#8211; 
tives to his dreadful image&#59; and there the indweller 
of the land of China&#44; with his absurd mockeries in 
place of worship&#59; again&#44; here stand the adherents of 
the lama&#44; believing in a perpetual reign of their man&#8211; 
idol on earth&#59; and there you will behold the melan&#8211; 
choly Hindoo&#44; rolling in the sand to be crushed by 
the wagon of his false homage&#44; or wallowing in the 
swamp of the Ganges&#44; to be devoured by the croc&#8211; 
odile or the shark&#59; and there stands the fierce Arab&#44; 
defying all law&#44; an enemy to all men&#44; and trusting 
only to his good lance&#44; and he says&#44; &#34;There is but 
one God&#44; but Mahomed is his prophet&#44;&#34; and his re&#8211; 
ligion is one of forms mostly&#44; and his beatitude but 
sensuality&#59; &#8212; again behold the Eomanist&#44; seeking in 
the elected head of his church the vicegerent of his 
god &#59; and tliQ. numerous sects of another belief uext 
present themselves&#44; all maintaining that each alone 
is right&#58; and thus you have a picture of discord in 
place of the harmony prophesied. And yet you say 
that the reign of the Messiah has endured already 
near two thousand years&#61; when shall we look for 
harmony&#61; is the dispute of sectarians waxing less 
angry as time advances&#61; are not daily new and often 
monstrous absurdities propagated in the name of the

king of peace&#61; and where is this all to end&#61; You 
perhaps say&#44; at the second coming of the Messiah &#33; 
So then you acknowledge that the first alleged com&#8211; 
ing failed of accomplishing all that was necessary&#59; 
l&#41;ut we too hope for a coming of Messiah&#59; but it is 
the first&#44; the only coming&#44; when all will be fulfilled 
jind accomplished to the letter&#44; which has been fore&#8211; 
told concerning his ministry. For&#44; in lookhig through 
the Scriptures to be informed on this important sub&#8211; 
ject&#44; we are constantly referred to the prince in whose 
days all shall dwell in safetj&#8211;&#59; but in no one instance 
is an allusion even made&#44; in so many words&#44; to a sec&#8211; 
ond appearance after his removal from the eyes of 
the world. &#8212; On the contrary&#44; a permanent reign is 
foretold&#58; &#34;And my servant David shall be prince 
over thoni for ever&#44;&#34; says Ezekiel xxxvii. 25&#44; which 
verse surely&#39;&#44; if it has any meaning&#44; which nobody can 
deny&#44; must indicate an everlasting state of blessed&#8211; 
ness&#44; from the coming of the Messiah till all shall be 
resolved again into chaos&#44; if this be the ultimate will 
of God&#44; and a reproduction of a better earth and a 
better heaven. And who knows to a certainty&#44; what 
is precisely meant by the new creation which is fore&#8211; 
told in Isaiah Ixvi. 22&#61; The words are&#58; &#34; For as the 
new heavens and the new earth&#44; which I will make&#44; 
shall stand permanently before me&#44; saith the Lord&#44; 
thus shall exist your posterity and your name.&#34; .I&#58;Tow&#44; 
this may mean&#44; that when this earth and all the pres&#8211; 
ent system of nature shall have existed during a cer&#8211; 
tain period&#44; then a different system&#44; one more perfect 
than the one now in being&#44; shall be established&#44; which 
after its formation shall stand permanent&#33;y before its 
Creator &#59; such an idea&#44; let me remark&#44; is by no means 

<pb n="317"/>

THE MESSIAH. 317 

discordant with the principles of men of science&#44; who 
have endeavoured to seek wisdom from the records 
of nature itself. &#8212; Yet&#44; in the midst of this change&#44; 
the upholding of Jacob&#39;s progeny is not to be lost 
sight of&#44; and consequently the Messiah&#39;s reign is not 
even then to terminate. &#8212; Another meaning of this 
verse may be&#44; that it is the intention of God to re&#8211; 
model the moral state of the earth&#44; and to infuse in 
all created things a spirit of love and unity&#44; and thus 
a new creation will be efl&#39;ected in the moral and spir&#8211; 
itual world&#44; though the physical and material sub&#8211; 
stances may have undergone no perceptible change. 
In every view of this difficult question&#44; however&#44; it 
will be perceived&#44; that the reign of the Messiah and 
the existence of the Israelitish people shall be unend&#8211; 
ing while the world lasts. 

All the above clearly proves&#44; that according to the 
revelation of the prophets a great moral&#44; and perhaps 
t.oo a physical&#44; change is impending&#44; when the dis&#8211; 
cord and strife which now distract the world shall no 
longer be experienced. Whatever events&#44; please to 
observe&#44; have taken place in bygone days&#44; whatever 
events are now occurring&#44; and whatever events will 
come to pass in future times&#44; all will tend ultimately 
to the consummation of this great change. If now 
one nation rises in blood&#44; and shoots up its branches 
from the ashes of a slaughtered people&#59; if we see ap&#8211; 
parent injustice even in the unjust being permitted 
to tread upon the head of fallen greatness&#58; we may 
rest in the hopeful assurance&#44; that all is so wisely or&#8211; 
dained&#44; all so nicely balanced&#44; that&#44; when the end of 
all this warfare and this unhappiness shall have ar&#8211; 
rived&#44; we shall discover that every thing has truly

happened for the best&#44; and all lias been so ordained 
by the eounsel of Ilim who snpervises all onr con&#8211; 
duct&#44; that nothing but justice&#44; nothing but righteous&#8211; 
ness&#44; will be the ultimate result&#44; and that the course 
of events was so organized as to bring about&#44; in the 
best manner&#44; the end whicli&#44; iu the mind of God&#44; is 
already come to pass&#44; which with Him is the past 
already&#44; but which to us is yet the future&#44; and the 
accomplishment of whicli we have still to expect. &#8212; 
What matters it then&#44; that first the Egyptians flour&#8211; 
ished&#44; and next the Assyrians and Babylonians&#44; then 
the Grecians&#44; after them the Romans&#44; whether it be 
roaming savages that scour the forest&#44; or bigoted 
Spaniards that devoted millions of victims to destruc&#8211; 
tion&#61; All&#44; all are in his eyes but vanity&#44; merely like 
the dust that adheres to the polished scales &#8212; all their 
doings are nothing in his estimation&#44; and He looks 
upon their efforts at greatness&#44; upon their puny striv&#8211; 
ing at renown&#44; with derision and with scorn&#44; as the 
PsaTmist says &#40;ii. 1&#8211;4&#41;&#58; &#34;Wherefore do nations rage&#44; 
and people attempt vanity&#61; &#8212; He that dwelleth in 
heaven will laugh&#44; the Lord will hold them in deri&#8211; 
sion&#59;&#34; not as tliough the holy One indulged in spite&#8211; 
ful malice&#44; but to make the human ear understand 
tlie. utter weakness of human ambition. &#8212; In short&#44; 
all is subscrvielit to the great end that is approach&#8211; 
ing&#44; slowly perhaps to us&#44; whose years are appointed 
to the short space of seventy annual revolutions&#44; or 
perhaps to the frosty age of eighty&#39;&#44; but quickly&#44; 
speedily&#44; to Him&#44; whose age no numbers can indi&#8211; 
cate&#44; whose existence is not limited by time or space. 
&#8212; As yet&#44; however&#44; the state of warfare is not over&#59; 
as yet oppression stalks abroad&#59; as yet Israel is com&#8211;

pelled to bend his head under the lieavy yoke which 
oppressors fasten on his neck&#59; as yet wickedness as&#8211; 
sumes the right of giving the law to innocence&#59; and 
consequently the altered state of the world has not 
arrived&#44; the Messiah has not yet been sent. But the 
time of this great event may be very near&#44; nearer than 
any one imagines&#44; &#8212; the wrathful time of trial may be 
approaclnng &#59; but where is the preparation which is 
needed to pass the fiery ordeal &#61; And what says the 
prophet &#40;Malachi iii. 1&#8211;4&#41;&#61; &#34; Behold&#44; I will send my 
messenger&#44; and he shall clear out the way before me&#44; 
and suddenly will come to his temple the Lord whom 
ye seek&#59; and the messenger of the covenant&#44; whom 
ye desire for&#44; behold &#33; he is coming&#44; saith the Lord 
of hosts. But who can sustain the day of his com&#8211; 
ing&#61; and who can stand when he appeareth &#61; for he 
is like the fire of the melter&#44; and like the lye of the 
washers&#59; and he will sit as a melter and purifier of 
silver&#59; and he will purify the sons of Levi&#44; and re&#8211; 
fine them as gold and silver&#44; that they may oflPer unto 
the Lord an offering in righteousness&#59; and then shall 
be pleasant unto the Lord the ofi&#59;erings of Judah and 
Jerusalem&#44; as in the days of old&#44; and as in former 
years.&#34; &#8212; The refiner will come and sift the sinners 
from among the community of the righteous &#59; &#8212; and 
what will stand the test of the Messiah&#39;s fire&#61; will it 
be a heap of wealth &#61; &#8212; a renown for greatness in elo&#8211; 
quence or prowess in arms &#61; &#8212; will it be the love which 
one bears for pleasures and sensuality&#61; &#8212; No&#44; itwill
be the love which we bear to God&#44; the readiness which 
we show to obey his laws&#44; and the mass of virtues&#44; 
which alone is our true inheritance in this world&#44; here 
whilst living&#44; and in yonder life&#44; When our soul has

departed to the place of its first origin. &#8212; 0&#44; let it 
then be our aim to observe the precepts of the Lord&#44; 
and let us ever be&#8211;willing and prepared to yield our&#8211; 
selves obedient servants to his will&#44; as our ancestors 
were on that day&#44; when assembled by the faithful 
Moses they stood at the foot of Sinai&#44; and heard an&#8211; 
nounced from amidst the lire the Ten Command&#8211; 
ments which God instituted as the terms of the cove&#8211; 
nant between Him and Israel&#44; Now&#44; these are the 
riches which we possess &#59; these are the blessings 
which God wishes to spread over all the earth &#59; these 
are the gifts which the Messiah is to distribute to all 
the peoples &#59; and when he&#44; therefore&#44; is sent to re&#8211; 
joice the hearts of all men&#44; nations indeed will ex&#8211; 
claim &#58; &#34; Let us go to the house of the God of Jacob&#44; 
and let Him teach us of his ways&#44; and we will walk 
in his paths&#44;&#34; and then truly will it be fulfilled wdiat 
the prophet says&#44; &#34; That from Zion shall go out the 
law&#44; and the word of God out of Jerusalem.&#34; 

our Father and King &#33; how long shall we hope &#61; 
how long shall we pray &#61; and when wilt Thou hear 
ug &#61; For ages we have hoped for peace&#44; but our 
prayers were not heard &#59; we looked for quiet&#44; but the 
oppressor was suifered to lord over us &#33; 0&#44; let it now 
be thy will to hasten the days of our deliverance&#44; and 
cause it to be verified in our days&#44; that the angel of 
the covenant and the son of David thy servant may 
come to gladden our hearts with thy salvation &#59; and 
then our joy will be complete&#44; when Thou barest thy 
holy arm before all nations&#44; and provest to the whole 
world that Thou&#44; O Lord &#33; art God alone&#44; and that

O Thou &#33; Shepherd of Israel&#44; hear our supplica&#8211; 
tions&#44; and let thy countenance shine unto us&#59; renew

Thee all the days that we live on the earth. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

In the view we have taken thus far of the subject 
of the Messiah&#44; we have arrived at the conclusion&#44; 
that both reason and Scripture warrant us in looking 
forward to a change that is impending over the moral 
condition of man. This change&#44; we have shown&#44; 
must produce a state of universal peace all over the 
earth&#44; so that no one&#44; be he weak or strong&#44; need to 
fear or to ward off the attacks of his neighbour. We 
have also proved&#44; that this state is not the present 
condition of the world&#44; and consequently&#44; that the 
predictions of the prophets have in this respect not 
yet seen their fulhlment &#59; and whereas the announce&#8211; 

<pb n="322"/>

322 THE MESSIAH. 

ment of the prophets must be true as the emanation 
of the holy Spirit&#44; it is reasonable&#44; and consonant 
with religion&#44; to look forward witli an unwavering 
confidence to the fulfilment of the prophecies relating 
to the reign of universal peace. &#8212; The second deduc&#8211; 
tion laid down was&#44; that this change was to be ef&#8211; 
fected through an agent&#44; whom we call the Messiah. 
On this subject so much has already been said inci&#8211; 
dentally&#44; that we might pass over to the next point&#44; 
which you perhaps recollect was the character of this 
messenger &#59; but it being perhaps best to draw some 
more light from Scripture&#44; Ave will illustrate it some&#8211; 
what more at large. &#8212; Already in the book of Genesis 
we find&#44; that Jacob prophesied of a Shiloh&#44; to whom 
the nations should assemble. This evidently refers 
to a messenger&#44; whom God intends to send to fulfil 
the object of the world&#39;s regeneration. The proph&#8211; 
ecy&#44; it may freely be admitted&#44; is not very explicit 
as to the manner in which this is to be effected &#59; but 
later prophets afford us ample and more enlarged de&#8211; 
tails&#44; and as the whole Bible is but one entire&#44; as has 
been demonstrated on other occasions&#44; one part must 
always be taken to illustrate the other. And we are&#44; 
therefore&#44; warranted in the belief&#44; that Jacob spoke 
of the same teacher&#44; whom the seers of later ages 
foresaw in their visions. One remarkable phrase you 
must particularly note in all prophecies concerning 
Messiah &#59; it is that the words&#44; D&#39;O&#39;n jT&#34;inN3 &#34; In the 
end of days&#34;&#42; are employed in nearly all&#44; from Jacob&#44; 

&#42; However we may render tlie words&#44; whether in the end&#44; succes&#8211; 
sion of&#44; or last days&#44; they must be viewed as indicating a great 
stretch of time far into the future &#58; their very indeflniteness shows 
that they refer to the close of the present state of trial. 

<pb n="323"/>

THE MESSIAH. 323 

the earliest one who spoke of the Messiah&#44; to the Lat&#8211; 
ter days of the first&#44; nay&#44; even down to the commence&#8211; 
ment of the second temple. This would seem to 
prove&#44; that not one of the prophets contemplated the 
desired advent as absolutely close at hand&#44; and that 
the rebuilding of the house of God by Ezra and his 
associates was not viewed as an accomplishment of 
the promised happiness of the people of Israel. This&#44; 
it will be easily seen&#44; is an important point in our ar&#8211; 
gument&#44; which scarcely can be overthrown by any 
thing that has been advanced against our hopes&#44; so 
far as my knowledge thereof extends. So then&#44; it 
would appear&#44; that Jacob the first prophet&#44; who pre&#8211; 
dicted the Messiah in distinct terms&#44; referred&#44; no less 
than his successors&#44; his advent to a period remote&#44; 
more or less&#44; according to the fitness of the world for 
the altered state that is to follow in his footsteps. &#8212; 
Bileam&#44; in his advice to Balak to mislead Israel to sin&#44; 
also spoke &#40;Numb. xxiv. 14&#41; &#58; &#34; And now I am ready 
to go to my people &#59; come&#44; I will counsel thee&#44; what 
this people will do to thy people at the end of days.&#34; 
And in ver. 17&#44; he says&#44; foreseeing the exalted glory 
of Israel &#58; &#34; I see him&#44; but he is not yet now&#44; I behold 
him&#44; but he is not near&#59; there steppeth forth a star 
from Jacob and there ariseth a sceptre out of Israel&#44; 
and he pierceth the corners of Moab&#44; and destroyeth 
all the children of Seth.&#34; Ver. 19&#58; &#34;A ruler shall 
come from Jacob&#44; and destroy whatever escapeth out 
of the city.&#34; In this passage&#44; so corroborative of the 
Patriarch&#39;s words&#44; an agent&#44; nay&#44; a human agent is 
distinctly announced&#44; and we are told&#44; that his advent 
was foreseen by the gentile prophet&#44; although it had 
not then been witnessed&#44; nor was it to be near at 

<pb n="324"/>

324 THE MESSIAH. 

hand&#59; and that to the messenger was to belong the 
earthly rule over the nations. This remarkable pre&#8211; 
diction is farther supported by Isaiah&#44; chap. Ix. 12 &#58; 
&#34; For the nation and the kingdom that will not serve 
shall perish&#44; and the nations shall be utterly haid 
waste &#59;&#34; and by Jeremiah xlvi. 27&#8211;28 &#58; &#34; But fear not 
thou&#44; my servant Jacob&#44; and be not dismayed&#44; 
Israel &#33; for behold&#44; I will save thee from afar oif&#44; and 
thy seed from the land of their captivity &#59; and Jacob 
shall return&#44; and be at rest&#44; and at ease&#44; and none 
shall make him afraid. Thou &#8212; do thou not fear&#44; my 
servant Jacob&#44; saith the Lord&#44; for I am with thee&#59; for I 
will make a full end of all the nations whither I have 
driven thee &#59; but of thee I will not make a full end &#59; I 
will correct thee in judgment&#44; but never destroy thee 
altogether.&#34; &#8212; Although these two passages do not 
speak distinctly of the Messiah&#44; I am induced to cite 
them at this stage of the argument to exhibit at one 
view the connexion between the various predictions 
delivered at so great distances of time&#44; and under vary&#8211; 
ing circumstances. Having now touched this point&#44; it 
maybe as well to state at once that the annihilatipn of 
the gentiles does not allude to the extermination of the 
individuals composing the mass of mankind &#59; but only 
to their national existence&#44; which will be effected&#44; the 
more fully to reduce the whole remainder of the hu&#8211; 
man race to peace and harmony. The individuals&#44; 
however&#44; are not to be cut off&#44; but are to become ser&#8211; 
vants of the Lord&#44; as will be shown hereafter. &#8212; It will 
be seen from the foregoing&#44; that the idea of a redeem&#8211; 
ing human agent&#44; acting under the evident supervi&#8211; 
sion of God&#44; was distinctly known to the Israelites&#44; 
as early as the days of Moses&#44; and even before&#59; this 

<pb n="325"/>

THE MESSIAH. 325 

also is a very important point in onr argument&#44; and 
must do away with the assumption which has been 
hazarded&#44; that the early Israelites knew nothing of a 
Messiah. &#8212; If we now trace the prophecies downwards&#44; 
including several other allusions of Moses&#44; we shall 
find the great hope for a human saviour under God 
constantly kept in view &#59; but it would require much 
time to cite the whole and to illustrate them. We 
must therefore proceed at once to the distinct annun&#8211; 
ciation of the redeemer and his character&#44; which we 
find in the books of the later prophets&#44; from which 
indeed most of our doctrines must be confirmed&#44; as 
they are more ample in detail than the scattered pre&#8211; 
dictions of former periods. &#8212; Let us begin with Isaiah &#59; 
in his eleventh chapter he says&#58; &#34;And there shall 
come forth a shoot out of the stem of Jesse&#44; and a 
sprout shall spring out of his roots. And there shall 
rest upon him the spirit of the Lord&#44; the spirit of 
wisdom and understanding&#44; the spirit of counsel and 
might&#44; the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the 
Lord. And he shall be animated by the fear of the 
Lord&#59; and not after the sight of his eyes shall he 
judge&#44; and not after the hearing of his ears shall 
he decide&#59; but he shall judge with righteousness the 
poor&#44; and decide with equity for the suffering ones 
of the earth&#44; and he shall smite the earth with the 
rod of his mouth&#44; and with the breath of his lips 
shall he slay the wicked. And righteousness shall 
be the girdle of his loins&#44; and faithfulness&#44; the girdle 
of his hips.&#34; And in continuation &#58; &#34; And it shall 
happen on that day&#44; that he of the root of Jesse&#44; who 
shall stand as an ensign of the people&#44; to him shall 
nations come to inquire&#44; and his resting&#8211;place shall be

glorious.&#34; Jeremiah&#44; chap. xxx. 9&#44; says&#58; &#34;And they 
will serve the Lord their God&#44; and David their king 
whom I will raise up unto them.&#34; &#8212; Chap&#44; xxxiii. &#58; &#34;Be&#8211; 
hold&#44; days are coming&#44; saith the Lord&#44; when I will 
fulfil that good word which I have spoken concern&#8211; 
ing the house of Israel and over the house of Judah. 
In those&#39;days and at that time I will let grow up unto 
David the sprout of righteousness&#44; and he shall ex&#8211; 
ecute justice and righteousness in the land. In those 
days shall Judah he helped and Jerusalem shall dwell 
in safety&#44; and this is what it shall be called&#44; &#39; The Lord 
our righteousness.&#39; &#34; Ezekiel says &#40;chap&#44; xxxvii.&#41; &#58; 
&#34; And speak to them. Thus saith the Lord Eternal&#44; 
Behold I will take the children of Israel from be&#8211; 
tween the nations wdiither they have wandered&#44; and 
I will gather them from every side&#44; and bring them 
unto their own land. And I will make them into 
one nation in the land&#44; on the mountains of Israel&#44; 
and one king shall be for king to them all&#44; and 
they shall not be any more two nations&#44; and not be 
divided at any time into two kingdoms any more. 
And they shall not any more defile themselves with 
their idols&#44; and their abominations&#44; and with all their 
transgressions &#59; but I will save them out of all their 
dwelling&#8211;places wherein they have sinned&#44; and I will 
cleanse them&#44; and they shall be my people&#44; and I will 
be their God. And David my servant shall be king 
over them&#44; and one shepherd shall be for them all&#44; &#8212; 
and in my ordinances they shall walk&#44; and my stat&#8211; 
utes they shall keep and do them. And they shall 
dwell in the land which I have given to my servant&#44; 
to Jacob&#44; wherein your fathers have dwelt&#59; and they 
shall dwell therein&#44; they and their children and their

children&#39;s cliildreu for ever&#44; and David my servant 
shall be prince to them for ever.&#34; &#8212; And in reference 
to the same subject we read chapter xxxiv. &#58; &#39; And I 
will save my flock&#44; and they shall no more be a prey&#44; 
and I will judge between lamb and lamb. I also will 
appoint over them one shepherd who shall feed them&#44; 
namely&#44; my servant David &#8212; he shall feed them&#44; and 
he shall be their shepherd. And I the Lord &#8212; I will 
be to them as God&#44; and my servant David shall be 
prince among them &#58; I the Lord have spoken it.&#34; &#8212; 
Hosea&#44; too&#44; clearly speaks of the Messiah&#44; and like 
Jeremiah and Ezekiel&#44; calls him David &#59; for we read 
in chap. iii. 5 &#58; &#34; After that the sons of Israel will re&#8211; 
turn and seek the Lord their God and David their 
king.&#34; &#8212; Amos also alludes to the same personages 
&#40;chap. ix. 11&#41; &#58; &#34; On that day I will raise the fallen 
tabernacle of David&#44; and I will repair its breaches&#44; 
and its ruins I will raise up&#44; and build it up as in 
former days.&#34; &#8212; Micah&#44; after stating the punishment 
that was to overtake the Israelites for their wicked&#8211; 
ness&#44; speaks of the glory that should ultimately await 
them&#44; when all had been accomplished&#44; and thus ad&#8211; 
dresses the city from which the family of David has 
sprung &#40;v. 1&#8211;3&#41; &#58; &#34; But thou Bethlehem Ephratha&#44; the 
least though Uiou be among the thousands of Judah&#44; 
yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to 
be ruler in Israel&#44; whose origin is from olden times&#44; 
from the most ancient days. &#8212; And he shall stand for&#8211; 
ward&#44; and feed Israel through the strength of the 
Lord&#44; through the excellency of the name of the 
Lord his God&#59; and they shall abide safely&#59; for now 
shall he be great even unto the ends of the earth.&#34; &#8212;

ino&#59; words &#58; &#34; Rejoice greatly&#44; thon daughter of Zion&#44; 
shout O daughter of Jerusalem&#44; for thy king will 
come to tliee&#44; righteous aud victorious he is&#44; lowly&#44; 
and riding on an ass&#44; on a colt the foal of a she&#8211;ass. 
And I will destroy the chariots from Ephraim and 
the horses from Jerusalem&#44; and destroy&#39;ed shall be 
the bow of war &#59; and he shall speak peace to the na&#8211; 
tions&#44; and his dominion shall be from sea to sea&#44; and 
from the river to the ends of the earth.&#34; &#40;ix.&#41; &#8212; In the 
foregoing&#44; I have endeavoured to lay before you a 
concurrent mass of scriptural texts to show to you at 
one view&#44; what the Bible teaches concerning the per&#8211; 
son and character of the expected redeemer. You 
will discover that&#44; among the texts selected&#44; I have 
adopted several on which the Nazarenes rely partic&#8211; 
ularly iis foundations for their own faitli &#59; but upon 
a close inspection it will readily be perceived&#44; that 
their construction cannot hold good&#44; as the described 
character and doings of their reputed messiah does 
not accord with the whole of the requirements of 
prophecy. 

You will now see&#44; that&#44; in all the passages quoted&#44; 
the Messiah is either called David&#44; from David&#39;s stem&#44; 
from Jesse&#39;s root&#44; the king&#44; the prince&#44; but never a 
god or a son of God &#59; in fact&#44; the idea of a divine re&#8211; 
deemer&#44; other than the Creator himself&#44; is nowhere 
indicated&#44; as far as we can learn. The chief personal 
characteristic of the Messiah then is&#44; his lineal descent 
from David&#44; who was the son of Jesse of Bethlehem. 
And&#44; as with us no mother whatever could confer the 
name of her family upon the offspring&#44; any more 
than among other civilized nations&#44; as no priest could 
be one&#44; merely by his mother&#39;s being a priest&#39;s daugh&#8211; 

<pb n="329"/>

THE MESSIAH. 329 

ter &#40;and so in other cases&#41; &#58; it farther follows&#44; that 
the descent from David means a descent in the male 
line&#44; which&#44; as has heen shown on a former occasion&#44; 
was never to cease according to the promise of proph&#8211; 
ecy. In wdiat manner the &#33;N&#34;azarene claimant of the 
messiahship answers in this respect to the prophe&#8211; 
cies&#44; remains&#8211; yet to be shown by his advocates. 

I must here draw your attention to an objection 
that might&#44; perhaps&#44; be made by unbelievers&#44; that the 
whole of the scheme of Messiah may have been an 
invention of court&#8211;sycophants to please the reigning 
family of Judah&#44; then ruling in Jerusalem. To this 
we answer&#44; that even if Isaiah could have had such a 
motive&#44; as he lived under the flourishing rule of Ileze&#8211; 
kiah &#58; still this could not have operated on the othci&#39;s&#44; 
especially&#44; as at least two&#44; to wit&#44; Hosea and Amos&#44; 
lived in the rival kingdom of Samaria&#44; and one&#44; Eze&#8211; 
kiel&#44; was in captivity among the Babylonians. Be&#8211; 
sides this&#44; Jeremiah spoke bitterly against tlie kings 
who misgoverned God&#39;s people &#59; and at the very time 
wdien he with anguished feelin2&#58;s witnessed the assault 
of the Chaldeans upon the battered walls of Jeru&#8211; 
salem&#44; when famine&#44; pestilence and the sword were 
slaying their thousands&#44; when Zedekiah was taken 
during his flight&#44; when his children were slaughtered 
in his presence&#44; his eyes bored out&#44; and he was led 
bound with fetters to Babylon&#44; it was that the most 
cheering promises with regard to the consolation of 
Israel were promulgated. Where then could be his 
motive&#44; save that of holy truth&#44; to speak of greatness 
to come to the house of David &#61; Besides&#44; what mo&#8211; 
tive could Jacob have to predict glory to Judah&#44; who&#44; 
no matter how devoted soever he had been latterly

to his father&#44; had certainly been the adviser of selHog 
the beloved Joseph into banishment and slavery&#61; &#8212; 
I know not indeed that such an objection has ever 
been started&#59; but inlidelity is so fruitful of inventions&#44; 
that I thought it might be advisable to refute a sup&#8211; 
posed question&#44; even before it was stated&#59; since it is 
quite as good as most that are so gravely urged against 
our holy religion and our hopes of better things. So 
far&#44; however&#44; from its impairing the credibility of the 
expectation of a Messiah from David&#39;s line&#44; the re&#8211; 
markable unanimity of men speaking at such distant 
periods &#8212; one patriarch&#44; one heathen&#44; some Jews&#44; 
others priests&#44; and others again Israelites&#44; some dur&#8211; 
ing the first temple&#44; others during captivity&#44; others 
at last after the rebuilding of God&#39;s house&#59; of whom 
some were men of high authority&#44; as Isaiah and 
Daniel&#44; others again men of humble life&#44; as Amos&#44; 
and Jonah&#44; and Jeremiah&#44; &#8212; must convince any one&#44; 
except a bitter skeptic&#44; that the spirit of God alone 
could have produced the result &#59; especially as several 
of the prophets were contemporary&#44; for instance&#44; Jere&#8211; 
miah and Ezekiel&#44; Hosea and Isaiah&#44; and it is not 
probable&#44; speaking humanly&#44; that one could have 
known what the other one was promulgating&#44; at a 
great distance&#44; and living in a different kingdom. 
To assert that the prophecies were made at one time&#44; 
by one or more men&#44; is too absurd a position to de&#8211; 
serve a serious refutation. For&#44; as has been shown 
in another place&#44;&#42; the style of the various books of 
the Bible is so different&#44; and the internal evidence is 
so strong&#44; that each actor in the scenes described was 

&#42; Jews and Mosaic Law&#44; chap&#44; xxiii. &#40;first edition&#41; pp. 170&#8211;171.

the narrator himself&#44; or had a contemporary historian&#44; 
that it cannot he possible that the Bible should have 
been composed at one period of time. And if then 
it is admitted&#44; as it must be&#44; that the several books 
were written at different times&#44; and at different places&#44; 
by persons unacquainted with each other personally&#44; 
and perhaps with each other&#39;s writings &#58; the position 
we have taken becomes incontrovertible&#44; namely&#44; that 
the unanimity of the prophets is the strongest proof 
that what they announced was the truth&#44; infused into 
their minds by the inspiration of the holy Spirit. 

This son of David is to be an agent of God&#44; for we 
are distinctly told &#58; &#34;And I will raise unto them one 
shepherd who shall feed them&#44; my servant David&#44; &#8212; 
and I will be their God.&#34; In this prophecy&#44; which 
cannot be mistaken&#44; the prophetic&#44; or rather the dele&#8211; 
gate character of the redeemer&#44; is announced &#59; and 
consequently to assert that the Messiah is to be in 
any way&#44; even by implication&#44; independent of his 
Sender&#44; is to speak contrary to revelation &#59; or in other 
words&#44; Messiah is to be a man&#44; a man only&#44; and no 
god. If now the true Messiah does appear&#44; as appear 
he will in the end of days&#44; he will at once announce 
himself as the messenger of God&#44; and in his holy name 
he will speak. Even grant &#40;what we some time ago 
denied as .exclusively applicable to him&#41; that the 
eighteenth chapter of Deuteronomy alludes to Mes&#8211; 
siah&#44; then he will address the people as Moses always 
did before&#44; and as did the other prophets&#44; with &#58; &#34; Thus 
speaks the Lord.&#34; &#34;But on no account is he to have 
any power to alter of his own accord any command&#8211; 
ment&#44; either positive or negative &#59; but&#44; being one of 
the people&#44; a man like them&#44; a subject to divine au&#8211;

332 THE MESSIAH. 

thority as well as they&#44; he is to be bound by the same 
laws which they have to obey&#44; and he is to execute 
the divine will&#44; not to set himself above it. If we 
now are asked &#58; &#34; Whether we believe the law to 
be perpetual&#61;&#34; we may answer&#44; unhesitatingly&#44; Yes&#59; 
since the advent of the Messiah hi no place seems in 
the prophets&#39; minds to be connected with the abroga&#8211; 
tion of any commandment. On the contrary&#44; Ezekiel&#44; 
chap&#44; xlv.&#44; in speaking of the days that are to come&#44; 
distinctly refers to the sacrifices&#44; to Sabbaths&#44; new&#8211; 
moon&#8211;days&#44; and festivals&#44; and farthermore to the ju&#8211; 
bilee&#44; or the year of freedom &#59; consequently the law 
which we now possess&#44; and which contains the enact&#8211; 
ments of these precepts&#44; shall after these days also be 
observed. It is true that some slight additions are 
prescribed vyith regard to the prince &#59; but they&#39; are 
only for him&#44; and not for the people at large&#44; there&#8211; 
fore so to say&#44; mere local or individual regulations&#44; 
not general laws. If now a claimant to the dignity 
of Messiah arrogates divine attributes&#44; or claims the 
power of destToying the law and the prophets &#58; he 
cannot&#44; of necessity&#44; be the one whom we expect&#44; 
and whom Moses and the prophets foretold. 

The man Messiah&#44; we stated&#44; in the enumerations 
of the doctrinal points advanced&#44; &#42;&#39;must be eminent 
in all the virtues which adorn man&#59; and his mental 
endowments will correspond with his high office.&#34; &#8212; 
This character is especially ascribed to him in the ex&#8211; 
tract from the eleventh chapter of Isaiah we liave 
quoted. &#34; On him shall rest tht&#41; spirit of the Lord&#44; 
the spirit of wisdom and of understanding&#44; the spirit 
of counsel and of might&#44; the spirit of knowledge and 
of fear of the Lord.&#34; &#8212; We here see&#44; first&#44; that the 

<pb n="333"/>

THE MESSIAH. 333 

Messiah is not to be an ordinary man&#44; not one merely 
wise as others are&#44; but particularly&#39; iitted for the high 
requirements of his glorious mission. He shall pos&#8211; 
sess capacity for information &#8212; or wisdom&#59; capacity 
for judgment &#8212; or understanding&#59; capacity for gov&#8211; 
erning and advising &#8212; or counsel&#59; capacity for energy 
in maintaining the right&#44; supporting the innocent&#44; 
and repressing the wicked &#8212; or might&#59; he shall have 
extensive knowledge&#44; or whatever any man knows or 
can acquire&#44; that shall be familiar to him&#59; and&#44; at last&#44; 
all these gifts are to be crowned by the utmost reli&#8211; 
ance on heavenly aid&#44; and he will ever have the fear 
of God before him. For this exemplary conduct he 
will have the spirit of prophecy &#8212; or knowledge of 
hidden things&#59; and in his exercise of justice he will 
therefore not have to depend on the pleadings of the 
parties interested&#44; nor will he have to rely upon the 
outward appearance which a case may present to the 
human eye&#59; but&#44; more than any other man&#44; he will 
be able to dive into what to them is unknown&#44; expose 
the evil to the eye of day&#44; and bring out the right&#44; 
though struggling against powerful craft and consum&#8211; 
mate wickedness. Evil&#8211;doers in him will find an un&#8211; 
flinching judge&#44; and he&#44; in imitation of the God that 
sends him&#44; will fear neither the great&#44; nor be terrified 
by the mighty &#59; &#39;&#39; and he will smite the earth with the 
rod of his mouth&#44; and with the breath of his lips he 
will slay the wicked&#44;&#34; whilst&#44; on the other hand&#44; &#34; he 
will judge with righteousness the poor&#44; and decide 
with equity for the suffering ones of the earth.&#34; It 
must be kept in mind that a great cause of wicked&#8211; 
ness and oppression is&#44; that the tribunals&#44; before which 
the criminals are to be arraigned&#44; are apt to be de&#8211;

ceived&#59; and tlierefore we are promised that the Mes&#8211; 
siah should ill his judgment be guided by more insight 
than other judges&#44; so that no crime&#44; however secretly 
committed&#44; shall escape his cognizance. This&#44; then&#44; 
gives us a third characteristic &#8212; the Messiah must be 
eminently wise&#44; and a dispenser of justice. Such a 
one has not as yet been seen on earth&#44; and conse&#8211; 
quently we yet expect his coming. In addition to 
what Isaiah thus emphatically announces&#44; we have 
also the prophecy of Jeremiah&#59; in his third chapter 
he says&#58; &#34;And I will give you shepherds after my 
own heart&#44; and they shall feed you with knowledge 
and understanding.&#34; In chapter xxiii. we have a 
farther explanation as to who these shepherds are to 
be&#58; &#34;And I will raise over them shepherds who shall 
feed them&#44; and they &#40;the flock or the people&#41; shall 
fear no more nor be dismayed&#44; and none of them shall 
be missing. Behold days are coming&#44; saith the Lord&#44; 
when I will raise up unto David a righteous sprout&#44; 
and he shall reign as king&#44; and prosper&#44; and he shall 
execute justice and righteousness on the earth. In 
his days shall Judah be helped&#44; and Israel shall dwell 
in safety&#59; and this is his name whereby he shall be 
called&#44; The Lord is our Righteousness.&#34; To un&#8211; 
derstand these passages correctly&#44; it is only neces&#8211; 
sary to refer back to the occupation which David&#44; the 
first king of Judah&#44; followed even after he had been 
anointed king &#8212; he was a shepherd&#59; besides which&#44; 
Moses already compared Israel to a flock&#44; for whom 
he begged of God the appointment of a trusty shep&#8211; 
herd. Add to this that our people were an agri&#8211; 
cultural nation&#44; living from the produce of their 
farms and pastures&#44; and but little given to trading and 

<pb n="335"/>

THE MESSIAH. 335 

luxuries&#44; before the pure spirit of the divine legisla&#8211; 
tion had lost its influence among them. All the pro&#8211; 
phetic imagery is therefore drawn from the pursuits 
of husbandry&#44; with but few exceptions. Jeremiah&#44; 
now&#44; had uttered his complaints against the wicked 
rulers&#44; by whose mismanagement the people went to 
rnin&#59; he styled them&#44; &#34;Shepherds that destroy and 
scatter the flock of God&#39;s pasture&#44;&#34; and announced 
at the same time that these bad shepherds should be 
punished. But he says&#44; &#34; That though the flock had 
been scattered&#44; the remainder should be gathered to 
their former fold&#44; where they should increase and mul&#8211; 
tiply&#59;&#34; and he then continues with the passage quoted&#44; 
&#34;And I will raise over them shepherds who shall feed 
them&#44;&#34; meaning that at the restoration of the people 
under the king Messiah&#44; who is to be the righteous 
sprout from David&#44; leaders should arise who will be 
difterent&#44; far difterent&#44; from the ofiicers of the Jewish 
kings&#44; Avho oppressed the poor and misled the wealthy. 
From this we again learn the character of the re&#8211; 
deemer&#58; he is to be a leader after God&#39;s own mind&#44; 
just and equitable&#44; free from the taint of injustice&#44; 
and perfectly submissive to the behests of the Lord. 
Under him security is to reign&#59; no one there shall be 
to make the remnant of Israel afraid&#44; for they shall 
dwell free from aggression and assault. The name of 
the prince&#44; too&#44; as well as of the glorious city&#44; shall 
be&#44; &#34; The Lord is our Righteousness&#44;&#34; but as yet the 
city of Jerusalem is not inhabited in safety&#59; its name 
is not &#34;The Lord our Righteousness&#44;&#34; npi&#58;&#39;n&#44; nor 
has that man arisen who is the leader of all Israel&#44; 
and who is honoured with the same name&#33; 

As shown already&#44; prophets say much relative to

the high characteristics of the coming king&#44; but the 
limits which must be given to a public address will 
not permit me to adduce them all. We must there&#8211; 
fore be satisfied for the present with adverting only 
to the passage from Zechariah&#44; already quoted&#44; to 
show that the expectations we entertain of a Messiah 
are consonant with Scripture. &#34;Be greatly rejoiced&#44; 
O daughter of Zion&#44; &#8212; behold thy king will come 
nnto thee&#44; righteous and victorious is he&#44; lowly and 
riding on an ass&#44; on a colt the foal of a she&#8211;ass.&#34; &#8212; 
We have been taunted by our opponents with expect&#8211; 
ing a mere temporary king&#44; a warrior and a con&#8211; 
queror. &#8212; To this we reply&#44; that we expect in the Mes&#8211; 
siah a twofold character&#44; &#8212; the one is purely spiritual&#44; 
as has been shown already&#44; and as I intend proving 
hereafter in a subsequent address&#44; but the other char&#8211; 
acteristic is certainly temporary&#44; and no one&#44; we are 
free to say&#44; can be the Messiah&#44; who does not unite 
both in his own person. &#8212; From Ezekiel especially&#44; 
and also Obediah and Zechariah&#44; it appears that great 
wars will be waged in Palestine at the time of the 
end&#59; and farther that this will be a period of great 
tribulation to Israel. We are also told&#44; that our peo&#8211; 
ple will&#44; by the aid of God&#44; escape from the threat&#8211; 
ened extirpation&#59; and now this aid of God will be 
rendered through an agent&#44; who is the Messiah&#59; he 
is therefore called righteous and victorious&#44; literally 
however a &#34;helped one&#44;&#34; meaning guided and as&#8211; 
sisted of God. If this temporal character of warrior 
in the holy cause of defending his people and of sub&#8211; 
jecting barbarians&#44; who come to kill and destroy&#44; 
derogates from his high dignity in the estimation of 
our opponents &#58; they are perfectly welcome to all the

addition to their argument which they can derive 
from it&#59; ice see nothing in it save a farther proof of 
the goodness of God&#44; in protecting his people from 
destruction against a&#44; perhaps&#44; united world. But let 
it not be lost sight of&#44; that immediately after speak&#8211; 
ing of the victoriousness of Messiah&#44; the prophet calls 
him &#34; lowly and riding on an ass &#59;&#34;&#39;and why so humbly 
mounted&#61; why not on a prancing war&#8211;steed&#61; why not 
bedecked with the spoils of the vanquished&#61; Because 
say&#39; s Zechariah &#58; &#34; I will cut off chariots from Ephraim 
and horses from Jerusalem&#59;&#34; the king himself&#44; there&#8211; 
fore&#44; will not appear on a beast of war&#44; but on an 
humble animal of labour&#44; for meekness will be the 
character of him&#44; as well as it was of Moses&#44; and he 
will in his own person teach humility and love of God &#59; 
and then &#40;after the wars of these times are over&#41;&#44; 
&#34; destroyed shall be the battle&#8211;bow&#44; for he shall speak 
peace unto the nations&#44; and his dominion shall be 
from sea to sea&#44; and from the river to the ends of the 
earth.&#34; So that the temporal actions of our future 
hope shall redound as much to the benefit of mankind 
as his spiritual gifts will be &#59; for those will pave the 
way for peace and happiness&#44; &#8212; these will establish the 
same on a foundation which shall never be moved. I 
regret exceedingly&#44; that I cannot dwell longer on the 
subject&#44; and &#39;examine more at length the objections 
so often made &#59; but I trust&#44; that what has been said 
will prove&#44; that our opinions are altogether founded 
on the word of God&#44; and are conformable to the dic&#8211; 
tates of reason. God&#44; understand well&#44; works through 
natural means and natural agents&#44; and consequently 
these will always be resorted to in some measure&#44; even 
iit the performing of great miracles.

338 THE MESSIAH. 

Connected&#44; however&#44; with the advent of the son of 
David is the mission of another glorious name&#44; that 
of Ehjah the prophet&#59; for we read&#44; Malachi iii. 23&#8211;24&#58; 

&#34;Behold I send unto you Elijah the prophet before the coming 
of the day of the Lord&#44; the great and dreadful&#59; and he shall turn 
back the heart of the fathers to the children&#44; and the heart of the 
children to their fathers.&#34; 

It will thus appear that love and truth are to pave 
the way for the great day of the Lord&#44; and Elijah is 
to be sent to be the precursor of the redeemer. No 
Elijah has yet come to gladden the hearts of the pa&#8211; 
rents and the children&#59; consequently the great day 
has not yet arrived. &#8212; The message of love has not yet 
been announced &#59; discord and contention yet disturb 
the peace of the family home&#59;&#8212; where then is the ful&#8211; 
filment of the prediction&#61; But the God of truth has 
spoken the word by his servant&#59; He that never errs 
has said&#44; that the coming time shall teem with salva&#8211; 
tion&#59; let it then be our endeavour to fortify ourselves 
in faith&#44; and to deserve the blessings which will fol&#8211; 
low the footsteps of the Lord whom we are seeking&#44; 
and of the messenger of the covenant whom we de&#8211; 
sire. 

May it be the will of our Father to guard us on the 
path of life which we are pursuing&#59; may He pour out 
his blessing over us&#44; and yield to each man the good 
desire of his heart&#59; and may He to his chosen nation 
especially give his grace&#44; and enlighten their hearts&#44;

even in the lands whither they have wandered for 
their manifold transgressions&#44; that they may learn to 
discern between the true and the false&#44; the good and 
the evil. May He deliver them from the snares of the 
ungodly&#44; who constantly aim to rob them of their hope 
and their support&#44; the law which He himself has given&#59; 
so that all the house of Israel&#44; and after them the 
whole race of man&#44; may be found worthy in his eyes&#44; 
to send down from heaven Elijah the angel of the 
covenant&#44; and cause his anointed one to come to glad&#8211; 
den us with peace and salvation. Amen.

THE MESSIAH. 
No. VI. 

To Thee&#44; O king of glory &#33; do we lift up our eyes&#59; 
on Thee&#44; O Ftither of mercy&#33; do we call&#44; to grant us 
salvation and peace&#44; and to cover us and all the earth 
with the panoply of thy grace and bounty O&#44; our 
God &#33; Thou hast said&#44; that the earth should be full of 
the knowledge of Thee&#44; and that no nation should 
lift up sword against nation &#58; do Thou now&#44; according 
to thy promise&#44; and arrest&#44; by thy potent might&#44; the 
strife and contention which at present desolate the 
earth &#59; and remove speedily the yoke of oppressions

which the humble ones are suffering from the hands 
of those stronger than they&#33; And cause Thou&#44; the 
redeemer&#44; even David thy servant&#44; to be sent unto us 
to gladden our hearts&#44; and to bid those rejoice who 
now mourn for Zion&#44; the city of thy holiness&#33; May 
this be thy will&#44; speedily&#44; and in our days &#33; Amen. 

Brethren&#33; 

Let us once more revert to the elucidation of the 
doctrines connected with the Messiah&#44; or as we have 
explained the word in our last lecture&#44; to the man&#44; 
descended from David&#44; endowed with high intellect 
and virtue&#44; deputed&#44; or anointed&#44; by the Most High to 
work out the changes of which the prophets speak as 
impending over the outward world. &#8212; It is evident&#44; 
even without resorting to the Bible for proof&#44; that&#44; 
consistently with the truth of God&#44; the people&#44; whom 
He once chose of all nations as the depositary of his 
will and law&#44; cannot&#44; by any possibility&#44; be excluded 
from participating in the benefits resulting from &#8211;the 
mission of the high functionary whom all their seers 
taught them to expect. For to argue otherwise would&#44; 
to say no more&#44; be impeaching the wisdom of God&#44; 
for having selected a family of men as the recipients 
of the highest trust&#44; who would&#44; on the first and great&#8211; 
est opportunity&#44; utterly fail of answering the end in&#8211; 
tended&#44; and show themselves entirely unworthy of 
the great grace vouchsafed unto them. For&#44; what 
other reason could there be to deny them a share in 
the happiness to be brought through the Messiah&#61; 
would God be unkind to those&#44; once called his chil&#8211; 
dren&#44; without a very powerful motive for their rejec&#8211; 
tion&#61; Let us pause one moment&#44; and see what this 

<pb n="341"/>

THE MESSIAH. 341 

powerful motive can be&#44; eveu supposing that one 
should exist. It cannot be a denial of the Deity him&#8211; 
self&#59; for&#44; amidst all the apostacies of the Israelites&#44; 
we never yet saw the period when a total neglect of 
the Deity and his commands took place&#44; and relying 
upon the historic records of the Bible&#44; there was ac&#8211; 
cordingly&#39; no time in all the seasons of trouble and 
destruction&#44; when our nation was utterly forsaken by 
the Lord&#59; and convulsions&#44; which overthrew and an&#8211; 
nihilated other empires&#44; compared to which our state 
was hardly as a small corner&#44; merely purified our peo&#8211; 
ple&#44; and even if diminished in number by every pas&#8211; 
sage through the smelting furnace&#44; a hardier&#44; a firmer&#44; 
a purer body always emerged after every trial. All 
this proves that mere sinning will not deprive us en&#8211; 
tirely of the grace of God&#59; we must therefore seek 
for the cause of such a supposition farther even than 
the nearly universal apostacy witnessed in the days 
of the kings of Judah and Israel. It must be the 
rejection of the Messiah when he comes. But it re&#8211; 
quires only a small share of penetration to discover 
that this refusal to receive God&#39;s anointed can never 
take place. We ask&#58; &#34;To whom did the prophets 
speak&#44; when predicting the redeemer&#61;&#34; The Bible 
answers&#58; &#34;To the sons of Israel.&#34; &#34; To whom asrain 
did God speak when saying&#44; that even in the land of 
their enemies He would never forsake them&#44; though 
their sins had banished them from their lovely inher&#8211; 
itance&#61;&#34; The Bible again answers&#58; &#34;To the sons of 
Israel.&#34; &#34;To whom were the prophets like Moses 
promised&#61; in tbe midst of whom walked in humble 
guise the man that never tasted the cup of death&#61; 
whose ancestors stood at the foot of the burning 

29&#42;

342 THE MESSIAH. 

mount to receive the law of the King of glory&#61; whose 
forefathers were called the friends of God&#61;&#34; &#39;&#39;Kone 
others than the people of Israel &#33;&#34; And yet we should 
assume&#44; that they alone should&#44; of all mankind&#44; wil&#8211; 
fully place themselves out of the pale of God&#39;s mercy 
by rejecting the messenger&#44; whom He purposed send&#8211; 
ing from the beginning&#44; nay&#44; while they ostensibly 
profess to be guided by the ordinances of the law 
which He gave to them as his will &#33; can blindness be 
carried farther&#61; And assuming this as possible&#44; Avhat 
can be thous&#8211;ht of the wisdom that selected such a 
people of all others as the guardians of the law&#61; Is it 
possible to suppose&#44; that the religion to be upheld by 
the advent so much desired can be spread to the lim&#8211; 
its of the earth&#44; whilst its first possessors are false to 
their trust&#44; in even rejecting th&#39;e messenger&#44; and there&#8211; 
by incurring a punishment greater far than was suf&#8211; 
fered for apostacy and the worship of idols &#61; &#8212; We 
could multiply questions like these&#44; and endeavour to 
strengthen conviction yet farther&#59; but what needs it 
to adduce arguments to prove that the sun sheds light 
at the noon of day&#44; and what proof do you require&#44; 
that God&#39;s wisdom is unerring&#44; and that his means 
always accomplish their object&#61; We must therefore 
dismiss the absurd idea&#44; that the Messiah is not for 
the Israelites&#44; and we must assume that the son of 
David will also to our people bring salvation and peace 
among the rest of the sons of Adam. 

Let us now see of what our nation stands in especial 
need&#44; and what have always been the causes of our 
weakness. We need&#44; more than any thing else&#44; an 
entire and perfect union &#59; since our present existence 
can hardly be called national&#44; being dispersed&#44; as we 

<pb n="343"/>

THE MESSIAH. 343 

are&#44; in unimportant numbers all over the globe &#8212; op&#8211; 
pressed in many countries&#44; tolerated merely in others&#44; 
and regarded as equals in but few indeed. To such 
a state of degradation have we&#44; the people of God&#44; 
been reduced&#44; and it is thus we suffer the burden of 
our iniquities. l&#33;Now&#44; it is not to be denied&#44; that to 
a nation&#44; that has been once independent and free&#44; it 
is of vast importance and of paramount interest to 
enjoy an equal share of liberty of action as former&#8211; 
ly&#44; and hence no efforts&#44; however heroic&#44; are held as 
too dearly applied&#44; that will produce this result. And 
tell a conquered people to cease longing for a rein&#8211; 
statement of their government&#44; because their new 
rulers govern with justice and moderation&#58; and you 
will be answered&#44; that nothing can compensate for 
precious laws abolished&#44; for homes desolated&#44; and for 
altars overturned. This sentiment of regret has never 
been a stranger to the captives of Judah&#59; and many 
have been the tears that flowed for thee&#44; holy Zion &#33; 
many have been the sighs heaved at remembering 
thee&#44; O sacred city of Salem &#33; and let thy children&#44; 
land of Israel&#44; land of loveliness&#33; wander whither 
they may&#44; unto thy distant shores they will turn in 
their prayers&#44; a&#59;id bless the dust in which sleep their 
glorious fathers&#33; &#8212; their trusty prophets &#33; &#8212; the friends 
of their God &#33; And should we not weep over our 
fallen state&#44; when we see the ordinances of the Lord 
held in light esteem &#61; when in no one country the 
code of Moses is obeyed &#61; when as slaves or as citi&#8211; 
zens our brothers are constantly enticed away to for&#8211; 
sake the religion of their fathers&#61; when&#44; alas&#33; the 
arts of our adversaries on the one side&#44; and the open 
violence of the persecutor on the other&#44; have been 

<pb n="344"/>

344 THE MESSIAH. 

equally effective in drawing away niany a faint&#8211;heart&#8211; 
ed Israelite from his hope &#8212; from his only stay of sal&#8211; 
vation &#61; Shall we not mourn&#44; that in the land of 
Mori ah the stranger worships in his false helief&#44; and 
that the cities of our beloved land are the dwelling 
of robbers&#44; the abode of ravenous beasts&#61; that the 
lields are deserted&#44; and the plains rendered desolate&#61; 
Shall we not call in our agony on the Lord&#44; when we 
are told&#44; that to us&#44; of all men&#44; the rights of man 
must be denied&#44; that the children of the faith are un&#8211; 
worthy of trust &#8212; destitute of honour &#8212; solely because 
they build their faith on one God &#8212; on one law&#61; Shall 
we not pray to Him&#44; who is alone the Lord of ven&#8211; 
geance&#44; to require the blood&#44; the innocent blood&#44; of 
his servants that has flowed in streams unmeasured&#44; 
because they would not forsake Him&#44; their Father 
and God &#61; &#8212; Ay&#44; surely&#44; these and many more have 
been the consequences of our dispersion and dismem&#8211; 
berment&#44; and it is&#44; therefore&#44; reasonable to hope&#44; that&#44; 
since God will send the Messiah to. restore peace on 
earth&#44; He will also cause our dispersions to be gathered 
and united again in a land which was once their own&#44; 
the land of Palestine in which their forefathers dwelt. 
Upon a farther search into our history we will discover&#44; 
that nearly all the calamities&#44; to which our nation has 
ever been subject&#44; had their origin in a want of unan&#8211; 
imity among ourselves&#44; and the absence of a devotion 
to God. If now all the dispersed Israelites should be 
assembled together in one body&#44; and there should be 
a diversity of interests prevalent among them&#44; no per&#8211; 
manent union could be thought of. And if even a 
political unity of feeling should exist&#44; but a rebellion 
towards God be encouraged&#58; the peace thus upheld 

<pb n="345"/>

THE MESSIAH. 345 

would be of small advantage&#44; whilst every act of ours 
would anew call down the oft&#8211;experienced vengeance 
of Heaven. We would do this again just as at the time 
of Jeroboam&#44; when the division of the kingdom into 
Judah and Israel caused at first contention among 
the rival chiefs&#44; and when the latter&#44; in order to make 
more complete their severance from the family of 
David&#44; induced their subjects to throw off the yoke 
of the divine law&#44; for which expulsion from their 
land and banishment to distant climes were the doom 
of the wicked and apostate race. &#34;Would it then be 
wise in God to gather the Israelites without removing 
these great stumbling&#8211;blocks &#61; Assuredly not&#44; espe&#8211; 
cially as we always see&#44; that the actions of God on 
earth never fail of effecting a useful end. We must 
therefore come to the conclusion&#44; that at the appro&#8211; 
priate time a reassemblage of all the children of Is&#8211; 
rael will take place&#44; and that the returning captives 
will be without envy towards each other&#44; and all de&#8211; 
voted&#44; heart and soul&#44; to the service of their Maker. 

You will observe&#44; brethren&#44; that in all these de&#8211; 
ductions we have not quoted a single Bible&#8211;text&#59; and 
still we may freely challenge the exposition of the 
want of a single connexion between the argument 
and the coAclusion arrived at&#44; although merely de&#8211; 
duced from common reasoning. But these views&#44; 
thus proved to be reasonable&#44; are also perfectly con&#8211; 
sonant with the doctrines and the evident text of the 
prophecies&#59; and according to our usual method&#44; we 
will now proceed to adduce a number of parallel pas&#8211; 
sages from various prophets&#44; all tending to prove the 
intention of God to preserve the Israelites amidst 
their captivity&#44; and to restore them again to their 

<pb n="346"/>

346 THE MESSIAH. 

former land&#44; united under one head and devoted to 
the laws given through the servant&#44; faithful in the 
whole house of the Lord. &#8212; Moses&#44; the father of the 
prophets&#44; speaks thus &#40;Deut. xxx. beginning at verse 
1&#41;&#58; &#39;&#39;And it shall come to pass&#44; wdien all these things 
are come updn thee&#44; the blessing and the curse&#44; which 
I have set before thee&#44; and thou reflectest on them in 
thy heart&#44; among all nations&#44; whither the Lord thy 
God hath driven thee&#44; so that thou return est unto 
the Lord thy God&#44; and liearkenest unto his voice&#44; ac&#8211; 
cording to all that I command this day&#44; thou and thy 
children&#44; with all thy heart and with all thy soul&#58; 
that then the Lord thy God will restore thy captivity&#44; 
and have mercy upon thee &#59; and He will again gather 
thee from all the nations&#44; whither the Lord thy God 
hath scattered thee. If thy outcasts be at the out&#8211; 
most parts of heaven&#44; from there will the Lord thy 
God gather thee&#44; and from there will He fetch thee &#58; 
and the Lord thy God will bring thee unto the land 
which thy fathers possessed&#44; and thou shalt possess 
it &#59; and He will do thee good and multiply thee above 
thy liithers. And the Lord thy God will circumcise 
thy heart&#44; and the heart of thy seed&#44; to love the 
Lord thy God with all thy heart&#44; and with all thy 
soul&#44; in order that thou mayest live.&#34; In the same 
book &#40;xxxii. 36&#41; we read &#58; &#34; For the Lord will espouse 
the cause of his people&#44; and bethink himself of his 
servants&#44; when He seeth that their power is gone&#44; and 
the guarded and the fortified are no more.&#34; In these 
two striking passages we are distinctly told&#44; that a 
state of things&#44; like the one now existing&#44; would one 
day be experienced &#59; that it should be &#34; a day of trou&#8211; 
ble to Jacob&#59;&#34; but that nevertheless the remnant 

<pb n="347"/>

THE MESSIAH. 347 

would not be cut off&#59; but that at the end of days a 
change is to come over the face of the desolation&#44; so 
that the captives should return from the most distant 
climates&#44; and&#44; converted to the service of the Lord&#44; 
live peaceably in their own land&#44; worthy servants of 
the Most High&#44; and eminently deserving of his fa&#8211; 
vour. But before this could come to pass&#44; all the 
previously announced evil must have occurred&#44; even 
to the extent of an entire dismemberment of the peo&#8211; 
ple&#44; in small bodies&#44; all over the earth &#59; although at 
the moment the prophecy was spoken they were trav&#8211; 
elling under one leader in the desert of Arabia&#44; sep&#8211; 
arate and distinct from every other nation. Without 
any farther reference every one must be struck with 
the exact state of the Jews so pointedly foretold&#44; and 
the precise accomplishment in many respects of the 
blessings for obedience&#44; and the curses for rebellion 
so emphatically announced. Without even the con&#8211; 
currence of other prophets&#44; the events actually ex&#8211; 
perienced would stamp the prediction of Moses as 
true and proved &#59; but the confirmation becomes dou&#8211; 
bly strong&#44; when we draw in the testimony of other 
messengers&#44; all speaking before the banishment had 
wholly or partially come to pass. &#8212; Let us refer to 
Isaiah &#40;xi. tjegiuning at verse 10&#41; &#58; &#34; And it shall 
happen on that day&#44; that he of the root of Jesse&#44; who 
shall stand as an ensign of the people&#44; to him shall 
nations come to inquire&#44; and his resting&#8211;place shall 
be glorious. And it shall happen on that day&#44; that 
the Lord will put forth his hand again the second 
time to acquire the remnant of his people&#44; which 
shall remain from Asshur&#44; and from Egypt&#44; and from 
Pathros&#44; and from Cush&#44; and from Elam&#44; and from 

<pb n="348"/>

348 THE MESSIAH. 

Hamatli&#44; and from the islands of the sea. And He 
will lift up an ensign unto the nations&#44; and will as&#8211; 
semble the outcasts of Israel &#59; and the dispersed of 
Judah will He collect together from the four corners 
of the earth &#33;&#34; The prophet here speaks in confirma&#8211; 
tion of Moses. He first alludes to the king Messiah&#44; 
him of the root of Jesse&#44; and asserts&#44; that he should 
become a teacher&#44; not alone to Israel&#44; but to the 
whole world besides&#59; not that he should go after 
them&#44; but that they should seek him out&#44; to inquire 
of him the way of salvation&#44; as was also said in the 
second chapter &#58; &#34; Out of Zion shall go out the law&#44; 
and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem.&#34; The 
next assertion is&#44; that the Israelites should not be left 
in a scattered state&#44; but that from every place&#44; whith&#8211; 
ersoever they may have wandered&#44; they should be 
called together into one body. The Bible mentions 
the countries of Asia and Africa&#44; and even the islands 
of the sea&#44; those distant regions&#44; where at that time 
none of the scattered of Judah dwelt&#59; since the de&#8211; 
struction of the kingdom of Judah did not take place 
till long after the death of Isaiah. It must also be 
taken into account&#44; that only a remnant were to re&#8211; 
turn &#33; a remnant&#44; understand &#33; for the greater part 
should perish in the enemy&#39;s land. How fearfully 
has this been verified &#33; Had our numbers not been 
thinned by the wars of extermination waged for the 
hundredth time against us&#44; and by the destroying per&#8211; 
secutions which spared neither age nor sex &#58; our na&#8211; 
tion would by this time not have been the insignifi&#8211; 
cant body it now is. But still a remnant has been 
left&#44; an indestructible remainder has survived&#44; and 
this bare handful&#44; compared to the rest of mankind&#44;

continues to this very hour the special object of care 
to an overrnliog Providence&#44; and is the subject of the 
outpourings of the divine spirit over men&#44; the wisest 
and most virtuous with whom the world was ever 
blest. &#8212; After having stated the intended gathering 
from the four corners of the earth&#44; Isaiah continues &#58; 
&#34;Then shall depart the envy of Ephraim&#44; and the 
adversaries of Judah shall cease &#59; Ephraim shall not 
envy Judah&#44; and Judah shall not assail Ephraim.&#34; 
In chapter li. 11&#44; we read &#58; &#39;&#39; And the ransomed of 
the Lord shall return&#44; and come to Zion with song&#44; 
with everlasting joy upon their head &#59; gladness and 
joy shall they obtain&#44; while sorrow and sighing shall 
flee away.&#34; &#8212; Chap. lii. 2 &#58; &#34; Shake thyself free from 
the dust&#44; arise&#44; sit down&#44; O Jerusalem &#33; loosen thy&#8211; 
self from the bands of thy neck&#44; O captive daughter 
of Zion &#33; For thus hath said the Lord&#44; For naught

deemed.&#34; &#8212; Verse 6 &#58; &#34; Therefore shall my people 
know my name&#44; therefore on that day&#44; that I am He

tidings&#44; that publisheth peace&#44; that announceth tid&#8211; 
ings of happiness&#44; that publisheth salvation&#44; that saith

watchmen&#44;&#8211;i&#8211;they raise their voice&#44; together shall

and unto those that return from transgression in Ja&#8211; 
cob&#44; saith the Lord. And as for me&#44; this is my cove&#8211; 
nant with them&#44; saith the Lord&#44; My spirit which is 
upon thee&#44; and my words which I have put in thy 
mouth&#44; shall not depart out of thy mouth&#44; nor out 
the mouth of thy children&#44; nor out the mouth of thy 
children&#39;s children&#44; saith the Lord&#44; from now and 
for ever.&#34; What has just been adduced from the two 
prophets only will fully maintain our positions&#44; that 
though the Messiah is certainly to be the harbinger 
of peace to the whole earth&#44; it never entered into the 
contemplation of the seers of God to exclude the 
children of the covenant from a participation in the 
promised happiness. For what does Moses say &#58; &#34;And 
the Lord will circumcise thy heart&#44; that thou mayest 
love the Lord thy God&#44; in order that thou mayest 
live.&#34; Does this not prove that on no account would 
the Almighty suffer his people to reject the chosen re&#8211; 
deemer&#61; &#39; That thou mayest live&#44;&#34; says the prophet. 
Does not this presuppose that no crime deserving of 
rejection should be done by the Israelites with regard 
to Messiah&#61; And says Isaiah &#58; &#34; And unto Zion shall 
come the redeemer&#44; and unto those that return from 
transgression in Jacob.&#34; If even there could be a 
doubt about the meaning of the word Zion&#44; which as 
.some suppose means all such as have been brought 
by grace under the dominion of the Lord&#44; to which 
explanation&#44; let it be remarked&#44; we would not much 
object&#44; if taken merely as an accommodation and not 
as argument&#58; still the words &#34;And those that return 
from transgression in Jacob&#34; would fix the prophecy 
upon the literal descendants of the patriarchs especi&#8211; 
ally&#44; for it is they who have transgressed&#44; and have

drawn upon themselves the indignation of the Lord. 
Besides the concluding words of the covenant &#34; From 
now and for ever&#34; confirm the construction of the 
passage in favour of the theory we are advocating in 
our address of this day. For at the time of Isaiah 
the spirit of God and his word were only in the mouth 
of the Israehtes&#44; consequently when he says&#44; &#34; from 
now&#34; &#8212; from the moment&#39; I am speaking &#8212; it must be 
referring to those blessed with the possession of the 
Word&#44; and of these possessors he says&#44; &#34; that the 
spirit should never depart from them&#59;&#34; consequently 
to them too&#44; and for them the redeemer must come &#59; 
and to their Zion&#44; the city of Jerusalem&#44; he will 
repair to plant there&#44; on the mountains of Israel&#44; 
the standard of salvation&#44; to which the nations shall 
flock. The restored Zion&#44; the rebuilt temple&#44; must 
be possessed by those who&#44; sold for no price&#44; are to 
be redeemed without silver &#59; they who for their sins 
were expelled from the most lovely inheritance&#44; will 
be restored to their home by repentance and good 
deeds. In their restored land also they shall dwell for 
ever&#44; with none to make them afraid&#44; and the storm 
of desolation&#44; and the besom of destruction&#44; which 
have so often passed over them&#44; shall no longer be 
felt&#44; for no one that is unclean of heart and defiled 
by wickedness will any longer pass among them. &#8212; 
And to illustrate this farther&#44; we will extract one 
more passage from Isaiah&#44; chap. liv. v. 8 &#58; 

&#34; In a little wrath did I hide my face for a moraent from thee &#59; 
but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee&#44; saith thy 
Redeemer the Lord&#44;&#34; 

<pb n="352"/>

352 THE MESSIAH. 

And he continues emphatically &#58; &#34;For as the waters 
of IToah is this unto me&#59; as I have sworn that the 
waters of Noah should no more pass over the earth &#58; 
so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee&#44; 
nor rebuke thee. For the mountains may depart&#44; 
and the hills may be removed &#59; but my kindness shall 
not depart from thee&#44; neither shall the covenant of 
my peace be removed&#44; saith He that hath compassion 
on thee &#8212; the Lord.&#34; 

Can words be more forcible &#61; can love be more 
ardent&#61; can truth be more unwavering&#44; than are here 
presented to us&#61; &#8212; Israel forsaken&#61; Jacob rejected&#61; 
As well may the mother forget her offspring&#44; cease 
cherishing the child of her own body &#58; yea&#44; if these 
even could be forgotten&#44; God would not forget us &#59; 
never would lie deny us the hope of his salvation. 
But verily the redeemer will be sent to comfort the 
captives of the lonely people&#44; who have so long borne 
the contumely of a proud world&#44; because they had 
forsaken the law of their Father&#44; who redeemed them 
from bondage to be his people and treasure &#33; 

May thy kingdom&#44; Lord &#33; be speedily renewed&#44; 
and do Thou bless us with the advent of the prince 
of peace&#44; under whose shadow we may live securely 
among nations&#44; pleasing Thee by the righteousness 
of our lives&#44; so that we may ever deserve thy care and 
love &#33; Amen.

THE MESSIAH. 

No. VII. 

Lord op glory &#33; we call on Thee for protection &#33; 
How long yet shall thy children sufier&#61; how long 
yet shall thy inheritance sojourn in the land of the 
stranger&#61; May it be thy will&#44; O gracious Father&#33; 
again to have compassion upon those that have so 
long borne the weight of thy wrath&#44; and gather them 
from all nations&#44; and unite them as one people on the 
mountains of their heritage&#44; even the land of Israel&#44; 
which Thou hast sworn to give unto their fathers 
and their children after them&#44; as an everlasting pos&#8211; 
session. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

In our last address&#44; on the subject of the expected 
deliverer&#44; we adduced concurrent testimony from two 
prophets&#44; to prove that a great benefit is to result to 
Israel from&#44; his mission. &#8212; In continuation we must 
observe&#44; that the disposition to forsake the covenant 
of the Lord has always been the source of the greatest 
misfortunes that befell us&#44; ever since we were a peo&#8211; 
ple. If now a time should come&#44; when a greater love 
and a more uniform adherence to the law of Heaven 
were to be cultivated&#58; then it is also reasonable to 
suppose&#44; that the happiness of the nation so acting 

30&#42;

would be more amply secured tlian by any other 
means known to us&#59; since &#34;the ways of religion are 
the ways of pleasantness&#44; and all her paths are peace.&#34; 
And that such a time is impending&#44; appears clearly 
from the prophecies of Jeremiah&#44; who says &#40;iii. 
14&#8211;17&#41;&#58; &#34;Return&#44; O backsliding children&#44; saith the 
Lord&#44; for I am become your husband&#59; and I will 
take you one of a city&#44; and two of a ftimily&#44; and bring 
you to Zion &#59; and I will give you shepherds after my 
own heart&#44; and they shall feed you with knowledge 
and intelligence. And it shall come to pass&#44; when 
you multiply and increase in the land in those days&#44; 
saith the Lord&#44; that men shall not say any more&#44; &#39;The 
ark of the covenant of the Lord&#44;&#39; nor shall it come 
any more to mind &#59; nor shall they remember it any 
more &#59; nor shall they mention it &#59; nor shall any thing 
be done any more with it. At that time shall they 
call Jerusalem&#44; The throne of the Lord &#58; and all the 
nations shall be gathered unto it&#44; to the name of 
the Lord&#44; to Jerusalem &#59; and they shall not walk any 
more after the stubbornness of their evil heart. &#34; The 
meaning of this prophecy seems to be&#44; that at the 
time of the advent&#44; God will select the few that have 
escaped the many persecutions and the great hardships 
of a long captivity&#44; and restore them to their former 
land&#44; where He will appoint rulers who&#44; mindful ouly 
of justice and truth&#44; shall govern the people after the 
holy law&#44; which is&#44; in truth&#44; knowledge and intelli&#8211; 
gence. In those days the Israelites shall multiply and 
increase&#44; and none shall disturb them&#59; and no one 
shall any longer swear by the ark of the covenant&#44; 
for the whole congregation&#44; in all their assemblies&#44; 
shall be holy&#59; wonders sliall be wrought every where&#59; 

<pb n="355"/>

THE MESSIAH. 355 

God&#39;s majesty will appear at all places&#59; and to the 
throne of the Lord at Jerusalem shall flock the nations 
to worship the holy Name&#44; the ONE God&#59; and no 
more shall wickedness of heart mislead them to sin. 
How strangely&#44; how strongly&#44; does this agree with 
the annunciation of Isaiah &#33; and the coincidence is 
the more remarkable&#44; since the phraseology is so en&#8211; 
tirely difierent. In farther confirmation of the fore&#8211; 
going&#44; let us examine the thirty&#8211;first chapter of the 
same book&#44; ver. 1&#58; &#34;In those days&#44; saith the Lord&#44; 
will I be the God for all the families of Israel&#44; and 
they shall be unto me for a people.&#34; Yer. 27&#8211;34&#58; 
&#34; Behold days are coming&#44; saith the Lord&#44; when I 
will sow the house of Israel&#44; and the house of Judah&#44; 
with the seed of man and the seed of cattle. And it 
shall come to pass&#44; that just as I have watched over 
them&#44; to pluck up&#44; and to pull down&#44; and to over&#8211; 
throw&#44; and to destroy&#44; and to do harm &#58; so will I watch 
over them&#44; to build up&#44; and to plant&#44; saith the Lord. 
In those days shall they not say any more&#44; The fathers 
have eaten sour grapes&#44; and the children&#39;s teeth are 
set on edge &#59; but every one shall die for his own in&#8211; 
iquity &#58; every man that eateth sour grapes&#44; his teeth 
shall be set on edge. Behold days are coming&#44; saith 
the Lord&#44; wken I will make with the house of Israel&#44; 
and with the house of Judah&#44; a new covenant&#59; not 
like the covenant that I made with their fathers on 
the day that I took hold of them by the hand to bring 
them out of the land of Egypt&#44; which my covenant 
they have brokeij&#44; although I was become their hus&#8211; 
band&#44; saith the Lord &#59; but this is the covenant that I 
will make with the house of Israel after those days&#44; 
saith the Lord&#44; I place my law in their inward parts&#44; 

<pb n="356"/>

356 THE MESSIAH. 

and upon their heart will I write it&#44; and I will be 
unto them for a God&#44; and they shall be unto me for 
a people. And they shall not teach any more every 
man his neighbour&#44; and every man his brother&#44; say&#8211; 
ing&#44; &#39;Know the Lord&#59;&#39; for they all shall know me&#44; 
from the least of them even unto their greatest&#44; saith 
the Lord &#59; for I will forgive their iniquity&#44; and their 
sin will I not remember any more.&#34; &#8212; In order to pre&#8211; 
sent a connected view of the message spoken to Jere&#8211; 
miah&#44; I have extracted a considerable part of it&#44; al&#8211; 
though against our usual custom to make so long a 
quotation. It will be perceived&#44; that we are promised 
two things &#58; the first&#44; temporal security in our own 
land&#59; and the second&#44; a renewal of the covenant which 
the Israelites had broken&#44; much to the displeasure of 
their God. The first promise requires at present no 
exposition&#44; having spoken on the subject on former 
occasions &#59; but concerning the new covenant a few 
words&#44; by way of explanation&#44; may perhaps be useful. 
The words are&#58; &#34;Behold&#44; days are coming&#44; when I 
will make with the house of Israel&#44; and the house of 
Judah&#44; a new covenant.&#34; The parties are stated&#44; not 
to be the nations of the earth&#44; not a spiritual Israel&#44; 
but the actual descendants from the line of Jacob&#44; 
the houses of Israel and Judah. If a spiritual nation 
were meant&#44; the prophet would not have particular&#8211; 
ized&#59; for the double family appellation is not appli&#8211; 
cable to a spiritual symbol&#44; but only&#44; as said&#44; to the 
people that was at that time divided into the two con&#8211; 
tending divisions. Says the Text &#34;Not like the 
covenant that I made with their fathers&#44;&#34; for this 
covenant was neglected over and again by the parties 
to be benefitted by its institution &#59; but a new contract&#44; 

<pb n="357"/>

THE MESSIAH. 357 

a new agreement&#44; of a more permanent kind&#44; is to be 
entered into&#44; to observe the laws emanating from 
God&#44; or in the words used in the Bible&#58; &#34;I place my 
law in their inward parts&#44; and upon their heart will I 
write it.&#34; What is this that is to be written&#61; &#8212; the 
new covenant&#61; or if you will&#44; a new law&#61; by no 
means &#8212; the law of God which was given in former 
days&#44; this is to be written upon the heart of the peo&#8211; 
ple &#59; by which figurative phrase is to be conveyed&#44; 
that henceforward the ordinances and statutes of the 
law should be indelibly fixed in the affection of our 
nation&#44; so that they should never depart therefrom. 
Nay&#44; more&#44; the knowledge of God and his precepts 
shall be so universally diffused&#44; that no one shall need 
to ask for instruction concerning his duties &#59; since all 
shall be taught by the Creator himself. Where is 
here to be discovered the smallest allusion or the most 
remote reference to a new dispensation&#44; or a change 
in the commandments which were to be&#44; and are&#44; im&#8211; 
mutable &#61; It is idle to assert&#44; that the words covenant 
and law are synonymous &#59; for if this were so&#44; why do 
we always find the former used when a contract be&#8211; 
tween parties is meant&#44; and the latter when duties to 
be executed are spoken of&#61; And so we read in Gene&#8211; 
sis xvii. 8&#8211;1 &#58; &#34; And I will give unto thee&#44; and to 
thy descendants after thee&#44; the land wherein thou so&#8211; 
journest&#44; all the land of Canaan&#44; for an everlasting 
inheritance &#59; and I will be their God. And God said 
to Abraham&#44; But thou&#44; for thy part&#44; shalt observe 
my covenant&#44; thou and thy descendants after thee&#44; in 
their generations. This is my covenant which ye shall 
observe between me and between you&#44; and between 
thy descendants after thee&#44; Every male child among

358 THE MESSIAH. 

yon shall be circumcised.&#34; Ver. 21 &#58; &#39;But my cove&#8211; 
mint will I establish with Isaac.&#34; So also in Exodus 
xix. 5&#58; &#39;And now if you will hearken to my voice 
and observe my covenant you shall be to me a dearly 
beloved people more than all nations &#59; for all the earth 
is mine.&#34; In these passages&#44; it will be seen&#44; the word 
covenant is used&#44; although applied to the law&#44; in the 
sense of a contract&#44; by which the people and the father 
of this. people&#44; Abraham&#44; were to be bound by certain 
stipulations&#44; in return for which they should receive 
the more immediate and constant protection of God. 
But a much stronger exemplilication we find in Le&#8211; 
viticus xxvi. 14&#8211;15 &#58; &#34;But if you will not hearken to 
me&#44; and will not do all these commandments &#59; and if 
you will despise my statutes&#44; and your soul loathe my 
ordinances&#44; so as not to do all my commandments in 
that ye break my covenanC Here&#44; the not doing the 
commandments is termed breaking the covenant&#44; or 
we are told&#44; that the people by not doing the duties 
of religion&#44; which is their part of the contract&#44; would 
forfeit God&#39;s love and favour&#44; which&#44; as his part of 
the contract&#44; was to be bestowed in return for obe&#8211; 
dience. &#8212; So also &#58; &#34;And He told you his covenant&#44; 
which He commanded you to do&#44; the ten command&#8211; 
ments.&#34; &#40;Deut. iv. 14.&#41; And&#58; &#8211;&#39;It shall come to 
pass&#44; in reward for that you will hearken to these or&#8211; 
dinances&#44; and observe and do them &#58; tha&#8211;t the Lord 
will observe to thee the covenant and the kindness 
which He hath sworn to thy fathers.&#34; &#40;Ibid. vii. 12.&#41; 
Farther&#58; &#34;And they shall say&#44; Because they had for&#8211; 
saken the covenant of the Lord&#44; the God of their 
fathers&#44; which He made with them&#44; when He brought 
them forth out of the land of Egypt &#59; and they went&#44; 

<pb n="359"/>

THE MESSIAH. 359 

and served strange gods&#44; and bowed down to them&#44; 
gods which they did not know&#44; and which He had 
not assigned to them.&#34; &#40;Deut. xxix. 24&#8211;25.&#41; It will 
be perceived from the various texts from the Penta&#8211; 
teuch just given&#44; and which might be multiphed at 
pleasure&#44; that the words Berith covenant&#44; and Torah 
law&#44; are not the same &#59; and&#44; consequently&#44; when the 
prophet speaks of a new covenant&#44; he refers to a new 
contract or bargain&#44; to use a well&#8211;known homely 
phrase&#44; which should be so strongly adhered to&#44; that 
no infraction of the law&#44; which is to be strictly ob&#8211; 
served on the part of the Israelites&#44; should ever take 
place any more&#44; as had been frequently the case be&#8211; 
fore the time of the end&#44; and for which the infringers 
of the agreement between their God and themselves 
had drawn upon themselves the wrath and indignation 
of Heaven. But now&#44; when no longer ignorance of 
the details of the law will be found among the people&#44; 
when all will know the Lord from the greatest to the 
least&#58; then will the Almighty be their God&#44; and they 
shall be his people&#44; over whom He will watch with 
particular care&#44; and whose sin He will have forgiven. 
Of the other benefits&#44; to result from the coming of 
Messiah&#44; Jeremiah speaks no less than his great pre&#8211; 
decessor&#44; Isaiah.. To place the matter in a strong 
light before&#39;you&#44; we will extract one passage refer&#8211; 
i&#8211;ing to the punishment&#44; and another relating to the 
consolation of Israel &#40;xvi. 9&#41; &#58; &#34; For thus hath said 
the Lord of hosts&#44; the God of Israel&#44; Behold&#44; I will 
cause to cease out of this place before your own eyes&#44; 
and in your own days&#44; the voice of gladness&#44; and 
the voice of joy&#44; the voice of the bridegroom&#44; and 
the voice of the bride.&#34; Yet in chap&#44; xxxii. 36&#8211;41&#44; 

<pb n="360"/>

360 THE MESSIAH. 

we are told &#58; &#34; But now therefore&#44; thus hath said 
the Lord&#44; the God of Israel&#44; concerning this city&#44; 
which you say is given up into the hands of the 
king of Babylon through the sword&#44; and through the 
famine&#44; and through the pestilence. Behold I will 
gather them out of all the countries&#44; whither I have 
driven them in my anger&#44; and in my fury&#44; and in 
great wrath &#59; and I will bring them back again unto 
this place&#44; and I will cause them to dwell in safety &#59; 
and they shall be unto me for a people&#44; and I will 
be unto them for a God &#59; and I will give unto them 
one heart&#44; and one manner&#44; to fear me at all times&#44; 
that it may be well with them&#44; and with their chil&#8211; 
dren after them &#59; and I will make with them an ever&#8211; 
lasting covenant&#44; that I will not turn away from them 
to do them good on my part&#59; and my fear will I 
place in their heart&#44; so that they may not depart 
from me. And I will be glad over them to do them 
good&#59; and I will plant them in this land in truth&#44; 
with all my heart and all my soul.&#34; &#8212; And then con&#8211; 
tinues Jeremiah &#40;chap&#44; xxxiii.&#41;&#44; after adverting to the 
destruction which Jerusalem was at that moment 
suffering through the Chaldeans &#58; &#34; Behold&#44; I will 
bring it &#40;Jerusalem&#41; healing and cure&#44; and I will cure 
them&#59; and I will display unto them the abundance 
of peace and truth. And I will cause to return the 
captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel&#44; and I 
will build them up as at the first. And I will cleanse 
them from all their guiltiness&#44; whereby they have 
sinned against me &#58; and I will pardon all their in&#8211; 
iquities&#44; whereby they have sinned against me&#44; and 
whereby they have transgressed against me. And it 
&#40;Jerusalem&#41; shall be to me for a name of gladness&#44; a

who will hear all the good that I am doing unto them 
&#40;the Israelites&#41; &#58; and thej shall dread and tremhle be&#8211; 
cause of all the good&#44; and because of all the happi&#8211; 
ness that I prepare unto it. Thus hath said the Lord&#44; 
Yet again shall there be heard in this place&#44; of which 
he say&#44; It is ruined&#44; without man and without beast&#44;&#39; 
even in the cities of Judah&#44; and in the streets of Jeru&#8211; 
salem&#44; that are desolate without man&#44; and without in&#8211; 
habitant&#44; and without beast&#44; &#8212; the voice of gladness&#44; 
and the voice of joy&#44; the voice of the bridegroom&#44; and 
the voice of the bride&#44; the voice of those that say&#44; 
&#39; Give thanks unto the Lord of hosts&#44; for the Lord is 
good&#44; because to eternity endureth his kindness&#44;&#39; of 
those that bring thanksgiving &#8212; offering unto the 
Lord &#59; for I will cause to return the captivity of the 
land&#44; as at the first&#44; saith the Lord. Thus hath said 
the Lord of hosts. Yet again shall there be in this 
place&#44; which is ruined&#44; without man and even with&#8211; 
out beast&#44; and in all its cities&#44; an habitation of shep&#8211; 
herds who cause their tiocks to lie down. In the 
cities of the mountain&#44; in the cities of the lowlands&#44; 
and m the cities of the south&#44; and in the land of Ben&#8211; 
jamin&#44; and in the environs of Jerusalem&#44; and in the 
cities of Judah&#44; shall the flocks yet pass under the 
hands of hii&#61;i that counteth them&#44; saith the Lord&#34; 
&#40;6&#8211;13&#41;. In continuation&#44; the prophet speaks of the 
Messiah by name&#44; calling him David&#44; and predicts that 
security shall prevail all over the land. The an&#8211; 
nouncement just recited is also confirmed by Zecha&#8211; 
riah &#40;viii. 2&#8211;5&#41;&#58; &#34;Thus hath said the Lord of hosts&#44; I 
am jealous for Zion with a great jealousy&#44; and with 
great fury am I jealous for her. Thus hath said the

said the Lord of hosts&#44; Behold&#44; I will save my people 
from the east country&#44; and from the country of the 
setting of the sun &#59; and I will bring them back&#44; that 
they may dwell in the midst of Jerusalem &#59; and they 
shall be unto me for a people&#44; and I will be unto 
them for a God in truth and in righteousness.&#34; 
&#40;Ibid. X. 10&#41; &#58; &#34; And I will bring them back again 
out of the land of Egypt&#44; and out of Assyria will I 
gather them &#59; and into the land of Gilead and Leb&#8211; 
anon will I bring them&#44; and it shall not be sufficient 
for them.&#34; &#40;Ibid. 12&#41; &#58; &#39;&#39; And I will strengthen them 
in the Lord&#44; and in his name shall they ever walk&#44; 
saith the Lord.&#34; 

These extracts clearly prove&#44; that the restoration 
of Israel is to be accompanied by a change of the 
heart&#44; which change will produce in them an acqui&#8211; 
escence in the decrees of Heaven and a uniformity of 
sentiment and action. Ezekiel&#44; one of the seers of 
the Lord&#44; also confirms the above messages in differ&#8211; 
ent parts of his book&#44; and speaks of a union and 
good&#8211;fellowship that are to prevail among the people 
of the Lord&#44; and of an entire dependence they are to 
show towards their Maker. These are his words&#58; 
&#34; Therefore say to the house of Israel&#44; thus hath said

THE MESSIAH. 363 

the Lord Eternal&#44; not for your sake do I this&#44; O house 
of Israel&#44; but for the sake of my holy name&#44; which 
ye have profaned among the nations&#44; whither ye are 
gone. And I will sanctify my great name wliich ye 
have profaned among the nations&#44; which ye have 
profaned in the midst of them&#59; and the nations shall 
know that I am the Lord&#44; saith the Lord Eternal&#44; 
when I will be sanctified through you before jour 
eyes. And I will take you from among the nations&#44; 
and I will gather you out of all the countries&#44; and I 
will bring you unto your own land. And I will sprin&#8211; 
kle upon you clean water&#44; and you shall be clean&#58; 
from all your impurities and from all your idols&#44; will 
I cleanse you. And I will give you a new heart&#44; and a 
new spirit will I put within you &#59; and I will remove 
the heart of stone out of your body&#44; &#8211;and I will give 
you a heart of flesh. And my spirit will I put within 
you&#44; and I will cause that you shall walk in my stat&#8211; 
utes&#44; and that my ordinances ye shall keep and do 
them. And ye shall dwell in the land which I gave 
to your fathers&#59; and ye shall be unto me for a people&#44; 
and I truly will be unto you as a God.&#34; &#40;xxxvi. 22&#8211;28.&#41; 
And in continuation we read &#40;xxxvii. 21&#8211;28&#41;&#58; &#34;And 
speak unto them. Thus has said the Lord Eteriml&#44; 
Behold&#44; I will take the children of Israel from among 
the nations wliither they are gone&#44; and I will gather 
them from every side&#44; and bring them unto their own 
land&#59; and I will make them into one nation in the 
land&#44; on the mountains of Israel&#59; and one king shall 
be to them all for king&#44; and they shall not be any 
more two nations&#44; nor shall they at any time be di&#8211; 
vided into two kingdoms any more &#58; neither shall they 
delile themselves any more with their idols&#44; and with

their detestable things&#44; nnd with all their transgres&#8211; 
sions &#59; but I will save them out of all their dwelling&#8211; 
places wherein they have sinned&#44; and I will cleanse 
them&#44; and they shall be unto me for a people&#44; and I 
will be to them for a God. And my servant David 
shall be king over them&#59; and one shepherd shall be 
for them all &#59; and in my ordinances shall they walk&#44; 
and my statutes shall they observe and do them. 
And they shall dwell in the land wdiich I have given 
to my servant Jacob&#44; in wdiich your fathers have 
dwelt&#59; and they shall dwell therein&#44; they and their 
children&#44; and their children&#39;s children for ever&#44; and 
my servant David shall be prince unto them for ever. 
And I will make with them a covenant of peace&#44; an 
everlasting covenant shall it be with them&#59; and I will 
preserve them&#44; and multiply them&#44; and I will set my 
sanctuary in the midst of them for ever. And my 
residence shall be with them&#44; and I will be unto them 
for a God&#44; and they shall be unto me as a people. 
And the nations shall know that I am the Lord&#44; who 
sanctify Israel&#44; when my sanctuary will be in the midst 
of them for ever more.&#34; 

How any one professing a veneration for the proph&#8211; 
ecies of the Lord can at all misapprehend the obvious 
import of these consolatory messages&#44; is indeed sur&#8211; 
prising&#44; and our astonishment will not be a little in&#8211; 
creased&#44; when we discover that the same sentiments 
are expressed by other prophets besides those already 
cited. For so says Hosea &#58; &#34; And I will make for them 
a covenant on that day with the beasts of the field&#44; 
and with the fowl of heaven&#44; and with the creeping 
things of the ground&#59; and the bow&#44; and sword&#44; and 
war I will break away out of the land&#44; and I will cause 

<pb n="365"/>

them to lie clown in safety. And I will betroth tliee 
unto me for ever&#59; and I will betroth thee unto me in 
righteousness and in justice&#44; and in loving kindness&#44; 
and in mercy&#59; and I will betroth thee to me in faith&#8211; 
fulness&#44; and thou shalt know the Lord.&#34; &#40;ii. 20&#8211;22.&#41; 

Joel says &#58; &#34; And you shall know that I am the 
Lord your God&#44; dwelling in Zion&#44; my holy mountain&#59; 
and Jerusalem shall be holy&#44; and strangers shall not 
pass through her any more.&#34; &#40;iv. 17.&#41; 

Amos predicted&#58; &#34;And I will bring back the cap&#8211; 
tivity of my people Israel&#59; and I will plant them upon 
their soil&#44; and they shall not be pulled up any more 
out of their land&#44; which I have given unto them&#44; saith 
the Lord thy God.&#34; &#40;ix. 14&#8211;15.&#41; 

So also Zephaniah &#58; &#34; At that time will I bring you 
back&#44; even at the time that I gather you&#59; for I will 
make you for a name and for a praise among all the 
people of the earth&#44; when I bring back your captives 
before your eyes&#44; saith the Lord.&#34; &#40;iii. 20.&#41; 

From the whole of the extracts adduced it will be 
clearly perceived&#44; that&#44; when the time of the Lord ar&#8211; 
rives&#44; the following must take place &#58; First&#44; the Israel&#8211; 
ites will be assembled from all the countries where 
they are now scattered. &#8212; Sccondhj&#44; division and con&#8211; 
tention among tliemselves will not take place any 
more. &#8212; Thirdly&#44; they are to dwell securely each under 
his own vine and each under his own fig&#8211;tree&#44; un&#8211; 
disturbed by any foreign foe or invader. &#8212; Fourthly&#44; 
plenty and fruitfulness are to prevail in all the land 
of Israel&#44; which is to be far more extensive than it 
was at any time before. &#8212; Fifthly&#44; the rule of the Mes&#8211; 
siah will prevent the exercise of injustice and oppres&#8211; 
sion. &#8212; And lastly&#44; the universal acquiescence in the

will of God will preclude the recurrence of the pour&#8211; 
ing out of the wrath of Heaven over the Israelites&#44; or&#44; 
in the words of the prophet&#44; &#34; The iniquity of Israel 
will be sought and shall be no more&#44; and the sin of 
Judah will not be found.&#34; &#8212; These in short are the 
advantages which are to result to our people from the 
advent of the anointed of the Lord&#59; and although the 
prophets furnish yet more ample and minute details 
of events to occur in those days&#44; still as the subject 
has been so long kept under your consideration&#44; it is 
necessary to bring it to a close at present&#59; I do not&#44; 
however&#44; relinquish the idea of resuming ther&#34;discus&#8211; 
sion at a later period of more leisure&#44; when I trust to 
be able to treat it more clearly and intelligibly than I 
have done at present. 

We will now proceed to elucidate the last inquiry 
which we proposed&#58; &#34;What benefit is to result to the 
world at laro&#58;e from the mission of the son of David&#61;&#34; 
This question has been almost answered already in&#8211; 
cidentally&#44; when discussing the other points in the 
course of our investigation&#59; but still we will add a few 
especial elucidations drawn from the prophets. &#8212; In a 
preceding lecture we remarked&#44; that the desired ob&#8211; 
ject of many philanthropists&#44; the prevalence of uni&#8211; 
versal peace&#44; will then be accomplished&#59; but what is 
more&#44; not peace alone&#44; but a universal religion is also 
to prevail&#44; and the knowledge of God and his com&#8211; 
mands is to spread all over the earth. &#8212; For so says 
Isaiah&#58; &#34;And many nations shall go and say. Come 
let us go up to the mountain of the Lord&#44; to the 
house of the God of Jacob&#44; and He shall teach us 
of his ways&#44; and we will walk in his paths&#59; for out 
of Zion shall go forth the law&#44; and the word of God

from Jerusalem. And he will judge between the 
people&#44; and decide for many nations&#59; and they shall 
beat their swords into ploughshares&#44; and their spears 
into pruning&#8211;knives&#59; no nation shall lift up the sword 
against nation&#44; and they shall learn no more war.&#34; &#40;ii. 
3&#8211;4.&#41; &#34; And the Lord shall be exalted alone on that 
day. And the idols will he utterly abolish. &#8212; On that 
day a man shall throw away his idols of silver and his 
idols of gold&#44; which have been made for him to wor&#8211; 
ship.&#34; &#40;lb. 18&#8211;20.&#41; &#34;They shall not injure and they 
shall not destroy on al1 my holy mountain&#59; for the 
earth shall be full of knowledge of the Lord as the 
waters cover the sea. And it shall be on that day&#44; 
that he of the root of Jesse&#44; who standeth as an en&#8211; 
sign for the people&#44; to him nations shall come to in&#8211; 
quire&#44; and his resting&#8211;place shall be glorious.&#34; &#40;Ibid. 
xi. 9&#8211;10.&#41; &#34;And I will display a sign on them&#44; and I 
Avill send from them those that escape to the nations 
Tharshish&#44; Pul and Lud&#44; that draw the bow&#44; Thubal 
and Yavan&#44; the distant islands that have not heard my 
fame&#44; and have not seen my glory&#44; and they shall pro&#8211; 
claim my glory among the nations.&#34; &#40;Ibid. Ixvi. 19.&#41; 

And so also says Jeremiah &#58; &#34;0 Lord my strength&#44; 
my protection&#44; and my refuge&#44; on the day of trouble&#33; 
unto Thee nations will come from the ends of the 
earth&#44; and sfty. Toothing but falsehood had our fathers 
inherited&#44; vanity in which there is no profit. Can a 
man make to himself gods &#61; which are yet no gods. 
Therefore&#44; behold&#44; I will let them know&#44; at this time 
will I cause them to knoAv my hand and my might&#44; 
and they shall know that my name is the Lord.&#34; &#40;xvi.

ter&#44; fully confirms the prophecy of Isaiah&#44; with re&#8211; 
gard to the cessation of war&#44; and says&#44; emphatically&#44; 
that there should be none to make the peaceable in&#8211; 
habitants afraid&#59; and Ilabakkuk&#44; in almost the words 
of the same prophet&#44; announces &#58; &#34; For the earth shall 
be filled with knowledge of the glory of the Lord&#44; as 
the waters cover the sea.&#34; &#40;ii. 14.&#41; 

But of all the prophecies relating to this great and 
eventful change&#44; none is more explicit than Zepha&#8211; 
niah&#44; who says&#58; &#34;Terrible will the Lord appear over 
them&#59; for lie will cause to vanish all the gods of the 
earth&#58; and then shall prostrate themselves before him 
every one from his place&#44; all the isles of the nations.&#34; 
&#40;ii. 11.&#41; And after adverting to the judgment of God&#44; 
he continues&#58; 

&#34; Yea then I will change unto the people a pure language &#59; that 
they may all call on the name of the Lord&#44; to serve Him with one 
accord.&#34; iii. 9. 

It will thus appear that the will of God has been an&#8211; 
nounced as desiring to bring all the nations under his 
rule&#44; that all shall call upon his name and serve Him 
alone. This is farther confirmed by Zechariah&#44; who 
says&#58; &#34;And there shall come many people and mighty 
nations to seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem&#44; and 
to pray before the Lord.&#34; &#40;viii. 22.&#41; So also Malachi 
&#40;i. 11&#41;&#58; &#34;For from the rising of the sun even unto 
his going down my name is great among the nations&#44; 
and in every place incense is burnt and there is offer&#8211; 
ed to my name&#44; even a pure ofifering&#59; for my name is 
great among the nations&#44; saith the Lord of hosts.&#34; 

<pb n="369"/>

THE MESSIAH. 369 

David speaks of the same change&#44; when saying&#58; &#42;&#39;A11 
the nations that Thou hast made shall come and how 
down before Thee&#44; O Lord&#33; and honour thy name.&#34; 
&#40;Psalm Ixxxvi. 9.&#41; 

Yes&#44; brethren &#33; the time is coming&#44; when all nations 
will be brousfht to acknowledo&#58;e none but the God 
that made the heavens by his might&#44; and the earth&#44; 
and all that fills it&#44; and serve Him alone in truth and 
sincerity. We cannot determine whether the whole 
of the Mosaic law is to be obeyed&#59; but it is most 
likely&#44; to judge from the language of Zechariah&#44; that 
a part only of the commandments&#44; such as are best 
suited to the gentiles&#44; will be imposed on them. At 
all events the religion of Heaven will be made the 
standard of right for all nations&#44; who are to learn 
&#34;of the ways of the Lord.&#34; But as yet many people 
walk in ignorance&#59; &#34;they bow to vanity and empti&#8211; 
ness&#44; and pray to gods that cannot help&#59;&#34; yet one 
after the other will have the light made to dawn upon 
them&#44; till in yon glorious time the truth will be fully 
revealed. Already has one entire class of men a re&#8211; 
ligion analogous to ours&#59; they declare the Lord to be 
God alone&#59; but they found their belief upon the say&#8211; 
ings of a false prophet. Another class&#44; smaller in 
number&#44; but more endowed with the blessings of 
education&#44; have separated themselves from the be&#8211; 
lievers in a division of the deity&#44; and now believe in 
one God &#59; but they also put faith in a person whom 
we acknowledge not as a prophet sent to speak in the 
name of the Lord. But still the light is spreading&#59; 
ay&#44; despite of the efforts of men&#44; truth will ultimately 
triumph&#44; when &#34;the glory of God will be revealed&#44; 
and all flesh shall see that the mouth of the Lord

luitli spoken it.&#34; Ay&#44; onward will be the march of 
lisht&#44; till it will he verified what was foretold&#58; &#34;And 
I will display my greatness and holiness before the 
eyes of many nations&#44; and they shall know that I am 
the Lord.&#34; Higher and higher will the reverence for 
God rise upward &#59; more and more families will be 
taught to honour his holy Name &#33; superstition will 
yield her em23ire &#33; false worship will sink into oblivion &#33; 
unbelief will stand abashed &#33; and truly&#44; wdien our re&#8211; 
deemer&#44; David&#44; son of Jesse of Bethlehem&#44; is sent&#44; 
the universal law will be everywhere acknowledged&#44; 
truth will dwell in all places&#44; and in evcrj&#8211; house there 
will be worshippers of the Lord&#44; in every bosom there 
wnll beat a heart that acknowledges no prophet as the 
teacher of a heavenly law&#34; except Moses the chosen 
of the Lord&#44; and no God save our almighty Father 
and Ruler&#44; who spoke all these vrords through his 
servants&#44; and faithfully kept his promises to those 
who hope for Ilim&#44; and long for the time when He 
will dwell again in Zion. Li those days and in that 
period will be fullilled what the prophet predicted&#58; 
&#34;The Lord shall be One&#44; and his name OKE.&#34; And 
all mankind shall then acknowledge&#44; that the Ever&#8211; 
lasting alone is King&#44; Creator&#44; and Preserver&#44; and to 
Him alone appertain the power&#44; and the glory&#44; and 
the dominion&#33; 

This is the reign of the Messiah&#44; and this is the 
change which is impending. Li the whole of the 
exposition laid before you the Scriptures alone have 
been consulted&#44; and the subject was allowed to un&#8211; 
fold itself gradually to your reflection&#59; nothing un&#8211; 
reasonable was brought forward in the course of the 
argument&#59; and thus&#44; by the favour of Heaven&#44; I have 

<pb n="371"/>

THE MESSIAH. 371 

been permitted to add another demonstration to the 
well&#8211;established fact&#44; that reason and revelation are 
not inconsistent. It is now time to draw my labours 
to a close&#59; and let me breathe the fervent hope&#44; that 
the pains and care&#44; which have been very great&#44; be&#8211; 
stowed npon so interesting a subject&#44; may not have 
been without a commensurate share of benefit. For 
myself at least this has been the case&#59; and the more 
I entered into the study of the scheme of revelation&#44; 
the more became my astonishment and veneration 
rivetted&#59; astonishment at the consistency of the whole 
chain of predictions constantly increased&#59; and vene&#8211; 
ration for that great Being that spoke all&#44; and has 
also fulfilled&#44; as we daily see&#44; grew more ardent&#59; for 
in all our captivity&#44; and in all our wanderings&#44; it was 
his holy Spirit that ever upheld us. This beneficence 
will also guide the whole world&#44; and ultimately all 
will like us be led to fall down and worship before 
Ilim&#44; who is the Lord alone&#44; unending and omnipo&#8211; 
tent&#44; and without whom there is neither God&#44; Saviour&#44; 
nor. Redeemer &#33; 

Sovereign of the universe &#33; Upheld by thy bounty&#44; 
sustained by thy grace&#44; we have been preserved be&#8211; 
fore Thee unto this day&#33; O let us experience thy fa&#8211; 
vour henceforward&#44; and guide us through thy knowl&#8211; 
edge to thy service. And let thy spirit breathe com&#8211; 
fort into our souls when we are afilicted&#44; and cause 
all the sons of men to be enlightened of thy wisdom&#59; 
so that they too may be brought to thy worship&#44; as 
are the children of thy servants&#44; to whom Thou didst 
promise&#44; that Thou wouldst be their God&#44; and never 
forsake them even in their captivity and sufferings. &#8212; 
O do now display thy glory&#44; as Thou hast said&#44; and 

<pb n="372"/>

372 THE MESSIAH. 

build up the temple where thy name is to dwell for 
ever&#44; and send the redeemer&#44; even thy anointed one&#44; 
to heal the wounds which have been struck on us for 
our manifold transOTessions. O do it for the sake of 
thy holy name&#44; that has been profaned among the na&#8211; 
tions&#33; and let all the world see&#44; that thou art God in 
Israel&#44; and that there is none like Thee&#44; O Thou&#44; who 
art our Creator&#44; God and King&#33; Amen.

Note. &#8212; The discourses on the subject of Messiah must not be 
viewed as a complete treatise&#44; but merely as an illustration of the 
doctrines connected therewith. I must also distinctly state&#44; that I 
hold myself alone responsible for the arguments and sentiments 
advanced&#44; and that whatever of error and deficiency may be dis&#8211; 
covered should not be laid as a fault against our religion&#44; but solely 
to my inadequacy of doing the subject complete justice. I would 
likewise state&#44; that when I began the discussion&#44; I thought of finish&#8211; 
ing it in one&#44; or at most&#44; in two lectures &#59; but by degrees&#44; becoming 
more interested than I myself at first expected&#44; I continued the work 
during several months&#44; and had at length to finish it&#44; almost ab&#8211; 
ruptly&#44; because I had to draw the matter to some sort of a&#42; con&#8211; 
clusion&#44; before these volumes had entirely gone through the press. 
I do not&#44; however&#44; ask to be excused for gross errors&#44; which I trust 
will not be found &#59; but only to receive the reader&#39;s indulgence&#44; if he 
should not find all he may wish or expect from me. But&#44; as I have 
said in the text&#44; I do yet hope of resuming the discussion at some 
future period &#59; and in the meantime I would be greatly obliged for 
any hints&#44; advices&#44; or corrections from any one&#44; whether Israelite 
or not&#59; as I think&#44; that by a mutual interchange of opinions&#44; can&#8211; 
didly and temperately exhibited&#44; the truth and holiness of the divine 
law will be best proved to the satisfaction of the many&#44; and the 
happiness and welfare of all.

fliction as our lot on earth &#58; O then give us firmness 
to bear thy dispensations without repining&#44; and let 
our sorrows rise up unto Thee&#44; as an atonement for 
our misdeeds&#44; and hear our prayer in thy holy abode&#44; 
in order to purify our hearts and to cleanse us from 
our transgressions&#59; so that&#44; shielded by thy grace&#44; 
we may live to please Thee&#44; and to merit thy mercy 
and forgiveness&#44; Thou&#44; who art our Father&#44; King&#44; 
and God &#33; Amen.

DUTY AND SCOPE OF CHARITY	. 

Ladies and Gentlemen &#33; 

In the report of the managers which has just been 
read&#44; there have been exhibited to you the proceed&#8211; 
ings of a number of benevolent daughters of our 
people&#44; who for near twenty years have&#44; with means

quite inadequate for so noble a purpose&#44; endeavoured 
to succour the distresses of their fellow&#8211;beings. There 
always has been&#44; and&#44; whilst society is organized as it 
noTV is&#44; there always must be&#44; a great share of suffer&#8211; 
ing&#59; and whether the cause be inability to labour&#44; 
sickness&#44; loss of fortune&#44; or lastly&#44; improvidence 
even &#58; the sufferers have a claim upon the sympa&#8211; 
thies and means of those who are blessed with the 
opportunity and ability of granting relief. &#8212; But if 
individuals be ever so kind&#44; if their hearts are ever 
open to the calls of humanity &#58; still the poor&#44; especi&#8211; 
ally if he has seen better days&#44; must feel some hesi&#8211; 
tation to lay his distressed situation open before 
them&#44; justly dreading a refusal&#44; even allowing that 
he should not fear&#44; nor need to fear&#44; being treated 
with unkindness besides having his petition unat&#8211; 
tended to. If&#44; however&#44; the sufferer knows that a 
society exists&#44; established for no other purpose&#44; act&#8211; 
ing from no other motive&#44; than dispensing good to 
all according to its ability &#58; then he has a fund which 
he may call his own&#44; and friends in the managers 
of the charity&#44; who will soothe and solace him&#44; and 
look into his wants&#44; and relieve them&#44; while the fund 
for distribution is not totally exhausted. It is&#44; in&#8211; 
deed&#44; a pursuit well worthy the daughters of our an&#8211; 
cient race&#44; to become as it were the patrons of the 
needy ones&#59; to enter their humble dwellings&#44; per&#8211; 
haps in the dreary season of blighting winter&#44; and 
seek out a neglected sister who&#44; like them&#44; may once 
have been radiant wuth youthful bloom&#44; shining forth 
with all the elegance of splendid attire&#44; and attrac&#8211; 
tive by her sallies of wit and her intelligence. &#8212; But 
through the vicissitudes&#44; to which all are liable&#44; sad

reverses have befallen her &#59; one by one her friends 
have departed&#59; relative after relative was borne to 
the grave &#59; her worldly substance was swallowed up 
by unforeseen mishaps&#59; and now&#44; in some distant 
quarter of a large city&#44; she has been overtaken by 
the cold chill of winter&#44; with her resources exhausted&#44; 
and without the ability of earning the merest neces&#8211; 
saries of life. The managers of a charity&#44; like the 
one before us&#44; enter her abode. The cheerful flame 
again visits her cold neglected hearth &#59; the exhausted 
larder is replenished&#59; and the lonely sufferer&#39;s heart 
is lightened by the kind and cheerful converse of the 
friendly sisters&#44; and to Heaven ascend the grateful 
thanks&#44; and upon the benevolent is poured out the 
blessing of a soul snatched from the gloom of de&#8211; 
spair&#44; now rejoicing over the timely assistance&#44; sent 
almost as was to the prophet of old the widow of 
Zareptha&#44; to feed him in the days of famine. &#8212; But my 
friends &#33; like the means of the benevolent widow&#44; the 
funds of our society are also very limited&#44; and often 
indeed have the managers to husband their resources 
carefully and sparingly&#44; in order to enable them to 
grant a moderate relief to all standing in need of 
their assistance. And in seasons of severe cold their 
charitable intentions&#44; especially with regard to pro&#8211; 
viding fuel for the indigent&#44; which necessary article 
is often&#44; as j&#8211;ou all know&#44; beyond the reach of the 
really necessitous poor&#44; who most need it&#44; can only 
be partially but not adequately executed&#59; since the 
managers&#44; in order to let none go unassisted&#44; have 
to divide the means at command in small portions 
among the many that require aid. It is not to be de&#8211; 
nied that&#44; prompt to the call of distress&#44; our brethren

always have been&#44; and no doubt always will be&#44; ready 
to dispense the blessings of benevolence to all who 
are in want &#59; I only need to call to mind one instance 
of not very old occurrence&#44; where sojourners and 
wanderers were amply provided for&#44; as soon as their 
necessities were made public. Still this does nowise 
do away with the propriety&#44; the duty I may say&#44; of 
better endowing a charity like our Ladies&#39; Benevo&#8211; 
lent Society and of strengthening the hands of its 
managers&#44; in order to enable them to permit the 
stream of their benevolence to flow in a broader and 
deeper channel. Perhaps&#44; hard thoughts may have 
been entertained at times&#44; when the relief Avas not so 
promptly and amply bestowed as those who interested 
themselves for the distressed ones thou2&#58;lit it ouirht to 
be. But it should be remembered that&#44; before any 
thing is given&#44; it is the duty of the managers to inves&#8211; 
tigate and look into the cases presented to them&#44; to 
prevent any improper waste of the fund intrusted to 
their care&#44; and to see that not the least thereof be di&#8211; 
verted into improper channels. Nevertheless&#44; after 
satisfying themselves that the applicant is fully de&#8211; 
serving of aid&#44; it often happens that with the best in&#8211; 
tentions the managers have to stint their charity&#44; 
much to theii&#39; sorrow&#44; because of the insufficiency of 
their means&#42;. It is to be regretted that&#44; as appears 
from the report of the board&#44; a part of their availa&#8211; 
ble means derived from interest on a certain invest&#8211; 
ment&#42; has failed this year &#59; and the same may hap&#8211; 
pen again&#44; and be another proof of the insufficiency 
of human caution and foresight to secure against un&#8211;

welcome vicissitudes. The more necessity therefore 
exists for promptness of action in those charitably 
disposed. A season is approaching&#44; when in the 
usual course of events much suffering among the 
poor must be expected. This is the case in ordinary 
times&#44; when the Ahnighty has poured out ample 
stores over the earth for the sustenance of man. 
But in his wisdom&#44; which none of us dare to ques&#8211; 
tion&#44; He has caused the visitation of stinted crops to 
fall upon these shores&#44; that have almost uniformly be&#8211; 
fore this teemed with plenty. In addition to this&#44; 
from the combination of the labouring and produc&#8211; 
iog classes&#44; the price of almost every thing that en&#8211; 
ters into the use and consumption of a family has 
been raised to an exorbitant height. It must there&#8211; 
fore be self&#8211;evident&#44; that there must be many poor&#44; 
who will not be able to procure their usual portion 
of comforts and necessaries&#44; if the coming winter 
should even be but moderately rigorous. But should 
it hold the earth in its icy fetters with the same se&#8211; 
verity&#44; and for an equal space as last year &#58; who will 
be able to calculate the amount of suffering that 
would ensue &#61; Many persons who now can live&#44; and 
hitherto always have lived&#44; by the labour of their own 
hands&#44; will then not be able to do so any more&#44; and 
unless He who giveth food &#34; to the children of the 
raven&#44; when they cry&#34; sends them unexpected aid 
and enlargement &#58; they will have to seek assistance 
from their fellow&#8211;mortals&#44; from those &#34; whose gifts 
are small&#44; and whose shame is great.&#34; Would it 
then not well befit descendants of Abraham&#44; to arise 
in time&#44; and to provide the &#39;&#39;poor man&#39;s treasure&#34; 
with means&#44; in order that it may bestow its blessings

to all who may need &#61; &#8212; The institution&#44; in whose be&#8211; 
half this appeal is made to you&#44; does not so much 
distribute money as purchase the things needful&#44; 
which alone are given to its pensioners &#59; and in its 
managers you have ladies&#44; the wives&#44; sisters&#44; daugh&#8211; 
ters&#44; and relatives of your ownselves&#44; and no encom&#8211; 
ium need be passed upon them or their exertions to 
induce you to believe&#44; that whatever is placed under 
their charge will be well bestowed. &#8212; And for what is 
your bounty asked&#61; &#8212; Is it to rear up splendid palaces 
for the residence of the oppressors of the people&#61; is 
it to send your substance to feed sufferers in a distant 
land &#61; &#8212; 1&#58; &#44; it is none of these &#59; you are called upon 
to remember the poor within your own gates&#44; to suc&#8211; 
cour the distressed that are among yourselves&#59; to cheer 
the heart of some lonely widow&#59; to illumine with joy 
the humble home of the fatherless&#59; and to solace the 
indigent mother amidst her toiling to provide food 
and garpaents for her needy offspring. Shall I paint 
to you the anguish which such a mother must feel&#44; 
when she looks with dire apprehension to the coming 
days of wintry frost&#44; with the certain conviction that 
her unremitted exertions will not provide bread even 
to her helpless babes&#61; Shall I exhibit her to you 
despairing&#44; when the last handful of fuel is thrown 
on the almost dying embers &#8212; when the last morsel 
of coarse food is devoured &#8212; when the hungry &#8212; half 
famished &#8212; almost naked innocents huddle together 
on their miserable pallet in a night when fearfully 
rages without the winter&#39;s blast&#44; and drives in the 
sleet and snow through the open crevices of the al&#8211; 
most roofless cottage &#61; Say&#44; shall I lay open this 
mother&#39;s heart&#44; as she in despair calls on her God to

take her&#44; together with her suffering little ones&#44; unto 
his heavenly abode &#61; Is your charity to slumber&#44; till 
such a dreadful picture of suffering humanity is ab&#8211; 
solutely brought under your observation &#61; And yet 
such objects of distress have been &#59; yes&#44; the poor have 
perished from want of warmth&#44; from lack of food&#44; 
while the sons of affluence rolled over the frozen 
ground ensconced within their chariot of ease&#44; en&#8211; 
robed with the skin of the costly sable&#59; when their 
table was covered with untasted luxuries&#59; yes&#44; when 
the winter&#39;s chill was absolutely banished from their 
carpeted halls &#59; when the useless fires blazed within 
every corner of their splendid chambers &#59; when the 
wine&#8211;cup passed round the social circle&#59; when the 
merry song was heard&#44; and blithesome music rav&#8211; 
ished the soul. But will you&#44; beloved friends&#44; be 
the luxurious rich&#44; the heartless worldlings&#44; living at 
ease&#44; rioting in pleasure&#44; tasting of dainties&#44; while 
near you a brother suffers&#44; while in your city a fel&#8211; 
low&#8211;mortal groans under poverty&#39;s weight &#61; No&#44; this 
may never be &#59; no&#44; the descendants of Israel will not 
suffer this reproach to rest on tliemselves &#33; for in all 
times ennobling charity has characterized our peo&#8211; 
ple&#44; and liberality of heart and kindliness of feeling 
have ever remained a peculiar feature in our dis&#8211; 
position&#44; &#8212; yea&#44; amidst the persecution of tyrants&#44; 
arnidst the stunning scorn of our oppressors. And 
what does the law&#44; which we all revere&#44; say on the 
subject of charity&#61; It commands us to open our 
hearts to the calls of the sufferers&#44; and to give ac&#8211; 
cording to the blessing of the Lord which has been 
vouchsafed to us. We are commanded&#44; to leave a 
corner of the field for the stranger&#44; the widow&#44; and 

<pb n="381"/>

DUTY AND SCOPE OF CHARITY. 381 

the orphan &#59; the sheaf forgotten in the field must go 
to the same destination &#59; when the frait&#8211;trees are once 
pUicked&#44; the gleanings must be for the poor &#59; but as 
now the Israehtes no longer are an agricultural peo&#8211; 
ple&#44; and as we no longer live in one community se&#8211; 
cure and isolated&#44; it is still our duty to observe the 
spirit of these precepts. Let the rich therefore give 
a corner of his amassed wealth into the poor man&#39;s 
treasure&#59; let the husbandman and merchant&#44; when 
settling their yearly accounts&#44; drop their superfluous 
gains into the granary of the Lord&#44; and thus swell 
their amount of virtues by the small largess which 
they let fall to the share of their suffering brothers. 

Yet charity&#44; to be an acceptable offering to the 
Deity&#44; should not be a mere unwilling gift&#44; but it 
should flow spontaneously from the heart of the giver&#59; 
as we read in Deuteronomy xv. beginning at verse 7 &#58; 
&#34;If there should be a needy one among thee&#44; one 
from thy brethren&#44; in one of thy gates&#44; which the 
Lord thy God giveth thee &#58; thou shalt not harden thy 
heart&#44; and shalt not close thy hand against thy bro&#8211; 
ther the needy. For thou shalt open wide thy hand 
to him&#44; and lend unto him according to the want he 
may want. Take heed unto thyself&#44; lest there be any 
thing godless in thy heart&#44; saying. The seventh year 
of release is nigh &#59; and thy eye would thus be evil 
against thy brother the needy&#44; and thou wouldst not 
give to him &#59; and if he should call concerning thee 
unto the Lord&#44; it would be a sin in thee. Thou must 
give unto him amply&#44; and thy heart must not grieve&#44; 
when thou givest to him&#59; for on account of this thing 
the Lord thy God will bless thee in all thy works&#44; 
and in all the doings of thy hands. For the needy

will not cease from the midst of the laDcl&#58; I therefore 
command thee&#44; saying&#44; Thou shalt surely open thy 
hand to thy brother&#44; to thy poor&#44; to thy needy one&#44; 
in thy land.&#34; From this eloquent passage it appears&#44; 
that unwilling charity is not what the Lord desires &#59; 
but we are exhorted to let our liberality be accom&#8211; 
panied by a willingness of heart&#44; knowing as we must 
do&#44; that by whatever we bestow we make a loan&#44; as 
it were&#44; to our heavenly Father&#44; who will increase 
our store as a recompense for our hastening to the 
relief of his children&#44; the poor&#44; our brethren&#44; that are 
amongst us. In furtherance of this divine behest it 
has been our custom from time immemorial to form 
ourselves into societies&#44; and to raise&#44; actually and truly&#44; 
treasures in the name of the Lord for the relief of the 
needy. Some of these have for their object the relief 
of the sick and the burial of the dead&#59; may these be 
spread into every congregation of Israelites&#44; and their 
means be blest. Others are to give relief to the por&#8211; 
tionless traveller&#44; and to bestow largesses unto those 
that are needy &#59; may the Lord bless these also&#44; and 
cause them to prosper and multiply in. the land. 
Others are to dispense the blessings of education to 
the children of the necessitous&#44; and to teach them 
how to serve their Creator and God&#44; and to walk in 
his ordinances &#59; may these too be blessed&#44; and may 
hopeful fruits answer the expectation of their benev&#8211; 
olent founders. Others again there are&#44; whose object 
is to apportion dowerless maidens&#44; and to cause the 
helpless orphan to dwell in the house of her husband 
in humble content&#59; may our Father look upon these 
with favour&#44; and cause many happy matrons to call 
down blessings upon the friends of their helpless

youtli &#33; Others at last there are&#44; that&#44; like our Fe&#8211; 
male Benevolent Society&#44; enter the ahocle of wretch&#8211; 
edness&#44; to look carefully into the wants of suffering 
sisters and brothers of Israel&#44; and to cause every visit 
to be an earnest of relief and assistance&#44; to cheer the 
soul of the afflicted&#44; and to rescue ignorance from the 
way of destruction. Surely such institutions deserve 
the benison of Heaven &#59; and those&#44; whom He above 
blesses&#44; merit the favour of man&#33; Shall&#44; then&#44; our 
sisters appeal in vain to you&#44; my beloved hearers &#61; 
Shall your own mothers&#44; wives&#44; sisters&#44; relatives and 
friends be compelled to tell the suffering poor&#44; that 
their treasury is empty and their funds are exhausted&#61; 
May this disgrace nevei&#58; attach to our name &#59; on the 
contrary&#44; sons of Israel &#33; you to whom the Lord has 
given his blessing&#44; open your hearts to the appeal of 
the distressed&#44; before it is uttered loudly in your ears&#59; 
fill to overflowing the store of the benevolent&#44; and 
enable them to go on prosperously in their goodly 
task&#44; and to relieve and to succour all on whom the 
heavy hand of misfortune may fall. &#8212; And you&#44; daugh&#8211; 
ters of Yeshurun&#33; who have so rfobly embarked in 
the cause&#44; go on and prosper&#44; for the Lord your God 
is with you &#59; go on&#44; scatter consolation into the hearts 
of the afflicted&#44; and light up with joy the counte&#8211; 
nance of the mourners&#59; go on&#44; restore warmth and 
the genial flame to the deserted hearth&#44; and replenish 
the larder that is exhausted &#59; go on&#44; rescue from sin 
those whom pinching poverty tempts to transgress &#59; 
and O forget not the task&#44; most delightful of all&#44; to 
instruct the young mind&#44; to awaken the tender soul 
to a knowledge of the Creator&#44; and assist the dis&#8211; 
tressed mother to enable her to rear up the children

that the Lord has given her&#44; a joy to herself&#44; an 
honour to yon&#44; and servants to their Maker. If all 
thus combine&#44; if our brothers and sisters go hand in 
hand doing and bestowing good&#58; how joyfully must 
life then pass away&#44; and how sweetly will then rise 
to Heaven the incense of thankful hearts&#44; recalled 
from despair&#44; and taught in their hour of distress&#44; 
that even to this day our ancient race are true to their 
pristine virtue &#59; and that they are still worthy of 
being&#59; called the children of the Lord.

Note. &#8212; Since the above was spoken&#44; many institutions have been 
called into being in Philadelphia&#44; especially to relieve the distressed&#44; 
and to diffuse education. The work of charity and enlightenment 
goes forward notwithstanding occasional interruptions&#44; and the so&#8211; 
ciety too for which the appeal was made thirty years ago&#44; is still 
existing with increased means&#44; and controlled yet bj&#39; one or two 
of its officers of that day&#44; to relieve the distressed and to encourage 
those who are ready to perish.

PRAYER. 

O Lord God of fathers &#33; we call upon Thee&#44; to be&#8211; 
stow on us the watchfulness of thy providence &#59; for 
we well know&#44; and we have been taught that before 
Thee all is naught&#44; and that from thy omnipotence 
there is no fleeing. &#8212; In olden times it was that Thou 
decreedst punishment against thy chosen people Is&#8211; 
rael&#44; because they had sinned&#44; and had transgressed 
thy righteous commandments &#59; and they who thought 
themselves secure behind their impregnable walls&#44; 
within their fortresses of strength&#44; were led away

captive before their foe &#33; &#8212; And their oppressors too 
have felt the weight of thy power&#59; and Babylon&#44; and 
Persia&#44; and Greece&#44; and Kome&#44; they who mocked the 
sorrows of the children of thy inheritance&#44; have been 
overthrown&#44; when their day of sorrow came&#44; and all 
have proved in their turns&#44; that before Thee no mor&#8211; 
tal power can stand&#44; and that thy will builds up na&#8211; 
tions&#44; and that&#44; in thy justice&#44; kingdoms perish and 
are as though they had not been &#33; 

But in our own day&#44; too&#44; we have witnessed the 
manifestations of thy might. For Thou spokest&#44; and 
the destroyer hastened onward on his message of 
death&#44; and thousands fell beneath the sword that was 
drawn over many a devoted land. Ay&#44; and vain were 
the efforts of impotent men &#59; and on the high moun&#8211; 
tains&#59; in the barren deserts&#59; on the verdant banks 
of flowing rivers &#59; on the pathless ocean &#59; in the sunny 
South&#44; and in the cold of the North&#44; were the slain 
of thy awful visitation &#59; and we were emphatically 
taught&#44; that thy goodness alone saved us&#44; that thy 
mercy alone shielded us&#44; when mortals quailed and 
yielded in despair the contest against the minister of 
thy vengeance upon the sinful sons of the earth&#33; 

The warning passed on&#44; and the danger was over&#44; 
and we soon forgot Thee&#44; who hadst delivered us. 
But again Thou calledst on the curse of war&#44; and lands 
that weened they were secure in peace and prosperity 
heard the din of arms and preparation for battle re&#8211; 
sound in their boundaries&#44; and blood has flowed in 
streams&#59; because men thought not of Thee&#44; and 
trusted in their own wisdom and power. &#8212; Anon&#44; Thou 
beheldest how vain men trusted too much in their 
riches &#59; they imagined that they need not serve Thee&#44;

because their wealtli was extensive and their posses&#8211; 
sions widely spread&#59; but Thou commandedst&#44; and the 
flames&#42; went forth&#44; and houses that seemed to bid 
defiance to time&#44; crumbled into ashes in one single 
hour&#59; human efforts stood aghast&#44; mortal striving 
was vain agai&#8211;nst thy power&#44; and thy tire went on 
spreading and desolating&#44; till the proud were made 
to feel thy greatness&#44; and till the heart of the arrogant 
Avas rendered humble before Thee. For they who 
in their gay mansions listened in the evening&#8211;hour to 
the sound of the merry viol&#59; the light&#8211;hearted who 
in mirth expected a joyful morrow&#59; the lordly bride&#8211; 
groom&#44; at whose side smiled the lovely bride&#44; saw 
not the sun rise over their splendour&#44; because one 
night of desolation had robbed them of all the wealth 
on which they had built their hopes. &#8212; Yet we heeded 
not&#44; and we wended our way&#44; regardless of thy cove&#8211; 
nant&#44; reckless of the coming storm &#59; but the land that 
had been ever fruitful&#44; the soil that had always nour&#8211; 
ished&#44; have tixiled to give their return to the expect&#8211; 
ant husbandman&#44; and the measure of bread has been 
lessened by the unfruitfulness of the seasons. &#8212; Thus 
we have seen thy workings manifested before our 
eyes &#58; O do Thou enlighten our souls&#44; that we may 
bow to thy dispensations&#44; and endeavour to merit 
again thy favtjur by our obedience to thy will &#33; &#8212; And

ADDRESS. 

on the objects of charity. 

Brethren&#33; 

It was in ancient clays&#44; when the worshippers of the 
true God were few&#44; and the mass of mankind sunk in 
superstition and ignorance&#44; that the Lord of the uni&#8211; 
verse descended in his majesty to give unto his chosen 
people laws and statutes for their guidance. Centu&#8211; 
ries have elapsed since that glorious daj&#8211;&#59; empires 
liave risen and empires have fallen &#59; nations were 
horn and nations perished&#58; and still the legacy of 
Heaven is the guiding&#8211;star of Jacoh&#39;s children&#44; and 
the revelation from Sinai is still the law which the 
Israelites obey&#33; Ay &#8212; this has been the instrument 
in the hands of our Father above of preserving us 
amidst all the suffering&#39;s and chastisements we had to 
encounter&#44; because of our manifold transgressions&#59; 
and we have been spared&#44; miraculously upheld&#44; amidst 
the wreck of kingdoms&#44; and the annihilation of entire 
nations&#44; by this best gift which the Creator could con&#8211; 
fer upon the works of his hands. And although we 
have been often rebellious and disobedient to the di&#8211; 
vine mandates&#58; still there never yet was a time&#44; when 
the blessed law did not strike a chord of harmony in 
our hearts&#59; for despite of sin we have remained a 
faithful people&#44; since the divine revelation has at all 
times found its defenders among the descendants of 
the patriarchs&#44; the friends and adorers of the God of 
heaven and earth&#33;

One of tlie characteristics of onr people&#44; and one 
which is so strictly enforced in the records of revela&#8211; 
tion&#44; has always been our kindness to those that need 
our assistance&#59; and the assembly this day in the house 
of God proves&#44; that the ancient spirit of benevolence 
is not extinct among my hearers. For what brings 
you here&#61; is it to listen to sounds of enchanting mu&#8211; 
sic&#61; is it to partake of the viands of some festive 
board&#61; or is it perhaps to celebrate the achievement 
of some mighty conqueror&#61; or to do homage at the 
thi&#39;ono of earthly power&#61; &#39;No&#44; my friends&#33; you came 
hither to be excited to feelings of kindness and devo&#8211; 
tion &#59; you bent your steps to this holy edifice&#44; conse&#8211; 
crated to our almighty Father&#44; to raise your eyes&#44; to 
elevate your thoughts&#44; to yield your hearts in adora&#8211; 
tion of Him&#44; and you are here assembled to be pre&#8211; 
pared to give of the treasures with which you are 
blest to the poor Avithin your gates&#44; and to assist with 
your substance and with your counsel the unpro&#8211; 
tected orphan&#44; whose parents were removed before 
the charges intrusted to their keeping had j&#8211;eached 
that age&#44; when they need no longer the watchful eye 
of the father&#44; and the tender care and protecting 
mercy of the mother&#33; And well it is that there are 
those who feel for another&#39;s wo&#33; for turn we where 
we will&#44; we must discover many on whom have fallen 
the burdens of afflicting poverty&#44; and Avho suffer ills 
i&#39;rom which no liiiman exertions are able to extricate 
them. When the benevolent then looks into their 
wants&#44; and remembers that the sufferers are men like 
himself&#44; and that our God demands that he should suc&#8211; 
cour the needy &#58; the glow of kindliness at once warms 
his heart&#44; and with the hungry the loaf is divided.

ajid the naked go not away unclotlied. And although 
by such deeds of charity the needy are certainly ben&#8211; 
efitted&#58; it may nevertheless be maintained that the 
giver is also blest. For who would be hard&#8211;hearted 
enough&#44; unless he loved gold more than any thing 
else on earth&#44; and lived only for himself&#44; to enjoy 
alone the comforts which his means will afford him&#44; 
if a trifle freely bestowed would tend to alleviate the 
sufferings of his neighbour&#61; who but the arrogant 
would be willing to luxuriate alone in the pleasures 
of science and refined life&#44; if made conscious&#44; that 
by his exertions many poor might be snatched from 
ignorance and vice&#44; to become&#44; like himself&#44; an or&#8211; 
nament of human nature&#61; Yes&#44; brethren&#44; much as 
Ave may excuse ourselves for a neglect of charity&#44; by 
averring that we are unable to relieve all the suffer&#8211; 
ings&#44; and to remove all the evil that come under our 
notice&#58; it may freely be maintained&#44; that&#44; if concerted 
efibrts were made&#44; if one would take counsel with the 
other&#44; and proceed hand&#8211;in&#8211;hand to further the goodly 
cause&#44; sufferings would be relieved that are now gall&#8211; 
ing and almost force the humble to despair&#44; and evils 
would be remedied that now threaten at times the 
subversion of social organization and order. 

It was for the furtherance of these objects that the 
members of&#39; the society&#44; who celebrate their anniver&#8211; 
sary this day&#44; formed the bond of union&#44; to relieve 
the distresses of the stranger&#44; of the unprovided poor&#44; 
of the unprotected widow and orphan&#44; and of those 
Avho niny be overtaken by the rigours of winter with&#8211; 
out adequate comforts to combat with the severity of 
the season. In the countries beyond yon great water

of our brethren find themselves unable to procure the 
necessaries of life by their labour. Or&#44; again&#44; op&#8211; 
pressed by tyrannical rulers&#44; because of their descent 
from the great names of former ages&#44; suffering under 
the opprobrium of being members of the Jewish na&#8211; 
tion&#44; thev find a lousrer residence in their native land 
next to impossible. They hear&#44; that in this favoured 
clime industry is rewarded by a full and adequate re&#8211; 
turn&#59; they are told&#44; that in these States&#44; Avhich are 
free&#44; and long may their freedom continue&#44; the sons of 
Israel are permitted to assemble and call upon their 
Father in heaven after their ancient manner without 
let or hinderance. They make therefore every exer&#8211; 
tion to reach these shores. Behold them descending 
from the bark that carried them hither&#59; their means 
are exhausted by reason of long travel&#59; they are ig&#8211; 
norant of the manners and the language of the new 
home they have been seeking&#58; to whom shall they 
apply&#61; to individuals the burden would become too 
heavy&#59; and even if some one blest with extraordinary 
riches and possessed of unbounded benevolence could 
be found&#44; still his own occupations&#44; which every one 
must have&#44; would prevent him from giving due at&#8211; 
tention to the cases of the distressed strangers. But 
if there exists an institution like your society&#44; they 
may apply to the persons selected to bestow the char&#8211; 
ity with a well&#8211;founded hope&#44; that every thing will be 
done to relieve their wants and to aid them with 
wholesome advice&#44; and to point out the way by which 
not alone present distress may be relieved&#44; but which 
will enable thent to obtain &#39;an honest livelihood for 
themselves by their own exertions&#44; and perhaps at a 
later period to dispense the bounties of benevolence 

<pb n="393"/>

to those who may come after them. And when they 
find themselves blest with ease and competence&#44; they 
will thank our God&#44; that He had caused to prosper an 
association the aim of which it is to do good without 
hope of reward. 

Many a one has been in affluence in days gone by&#59; 
he had hoped that his latter days would be free from 
want and care. But who is able to rely with confi&#8211; 
dence upon the stability of aught in this evanescent 
world&#61; His fortune was dissipated little by little&#44; 
from the effects&#44; perhaps&#44; of too much confidence 
placed in those undeserving of it&#59; or from the sud&#8211; 
denness of political changes which caused his well&#8211; 
laid plans to fail&#59; or from the weight of diseases with 
which he or his family may have been afflicted. Could 
he&#44; who had seen better days&#44; resort to begging&#44; per&#8211; 
chance to be refused and spurned by those through 
whose villany he was reduced to his present distressed 
situation &#61; Iso&#44; not whilst a society exists&#44; which in 
relieving feels no interest in making the applicant 
ashamed&#59; which in bestowing need not&#44; will not&#44; pub&#8211; 
licly proclaim that a fellow&#8211;being has been reduced to 
poverty&#59; which in succouring distress will screen the 
wounded and tender feelings which the needy often 
experience&#44; and when in his old days comfort dwells 
in his house&#44; he will ask the peace of Heaven upon 
the benevolence that cheered his despairing spirit. 

In the day of youthful vigour man treads lightly 
the path of life. Fortune seems to smile on his en&#8211; 
terprise&#44; and he dreads not the coming day of evil. 
Jle enjoys life&#44; because of the buoyancy of his heart&#44; 
and he dreams not that it is incumbent on him to 
husband his resources and to lay up provision for his 

<pb n="394"/>

family&#44; because of the coming day of death. But 
alas&#33; the enemy may be kirking near&#44; although un&#8211; 
perceived&#59; and suddenly the youthful aspirant is taken 
from the midst of his pursuits&#44; and he is borne to the 
silent&#44; dark&#44; .and narrow grave. When living&#44; the 
world thought him prosperous&#59; but the gay outside 
deceived them&#59; and when the lonely widow looks 
into the deranged affiiirs of her departed husband&#44; 
she discovers that beggary and want are before her. 
From a heartless&#44; selfish world&#44; that only laughs with 
the prosperous&#44; but frowns upon the unhappy&#44; she 
may not&#44; cannot look for support in her straits&#59; but 
when the helping hand of a society like ours is near&#44; 
she has friends who will console and assist her&#59; and 
when her heart has ceased to mourn&#44; she will lift up 
her soul to God&#44; and thank Him that He had raised 
up to her friends in the hour of trouble&#44; of need&#44; and 
afliiction. 

But above all do they deserve protection&#44; whose 
natural guardians have been early removed&#44; who are 
left&#44; as it were&#44; desolate and lonely on the ocean of 
life&#44; with no guiding&#8211;star to point out the way&#44; with 
no watchful steersman to guard against the shoals&#44; 
the rocks&#44; the waves of existence. How many are 
there thus forsaken I and how many who are lost be&#8211; 
cause of the want of some kind friend to protect and 
shield them at the very time of life when care and 
watchfulness are doubly required. It may well com&#8211; 
port with the views of the proud and selfish to leave 
those to go to destruction&#44; who have no wealth to be&#8211; 
stow&#44; no favours to grant. But how would they feel&#44; 
were they to be made conscious that they should die 
in want&#44; their wives be left helpless widows&#44; and their

children unprotected orphans&#61; And is this end so 
very improbable to those even who deem them&#8211; 
selves lirmlj seated&#61; Ask the annals of poverty&#44; 
what are the sons of the great and wealthy&#61; and you 
will be told&#44; that they are among the miserably poor&#59; 
and descendants of kings are houseless wanderers&#44; 
strangers and exiles from the countries which their 
fathers governed&#33; It may indeed be said&#44; that the 
liigher his prosperity&#44; the nearer man is to his fall. 
And such a fall I from a proud eminence to the lowest 
degradation &#33; from the royal banquet to the scaffold&#44; 
from the pahice to the prison&#33; Ought not the rich 
man then to remember in his prosperity the fatherless 
and the widow&#44; in order that when his own children 
and the wife of liis own bosom may call&#44; they too 
shall find fatliersand protectors in benevolent friends&#44; 
&#8212; friends&#44; raised to eminence and distinction perad&#8211; 
venture by the fruits of the very charity bestowed 
by him from his useless superfluities in the days of 
his ease and prosperity&#61; &#8212; And ask&#44; who sit among 
the great of the land&#61; whose advice is listened to 
among the counsellors and governors&#61; who are they 
that scatter blessings wherever they go&#61; and you will 
be told&#44; they are the sons of the lonely widow&#44; the 
children of hximble parents&#44; the orphan who neither 
had a father&#39;s care nor a mother&#39;s love&#44; raised by a 
life of integrity&#44; of virtue&#44; and of kindness&#39;&#44; to the 
proud eminence which they now enjoy. And is it 
not something animating to the charitably disposed 
to believe that&#44; by his exertions&#44; some one may per&#8211; 
haps be raised from an humble condition&#44; perhaps 
from vice and its concomitant degradation&#44; to a sphere 
of usefulness and happiness&#61; But there are those so

acting&#59; there always have been friends of their species&#44; 
who disdained not to spend their time and their means&#44; 
however small&#44; to effect so noble a work. There once 
lived&#44; in a distant land&#44; a man who walked humbly 
before his Maker. Industrious he was&#44; but fortune 
smiled not upon his exertions. It pleased Ilim&#44; who 
is enthroned in heaven&#44; to afflict him with sufferings 
long and severe&#44; almost beyond endurance&#58; yet he 
repined not&#44; but yielded a cheerful submission to the 
just decrees of his God. Anon&#44; the wife of his heart 
Avas taken away to the realms of bliss&#44; where her 
virtues will shine for ever&#44; amid the servants and 
adorers of the Lord&#59; and he was left to struggle on a 
few brief years longer&#44; to provide by the sweat of his 
face for the wants of his offspring. But his end also 
soon approached&#44; before they for whom he toiled were 
old enough to battle with the world and its dangers. 
Yet the children of the righteous weie not forsaken&#59; 
and after the father had resigned his spirit in tran&#8211; 
quillity&#44; and joy at a release from his long&#8211;endured 
pain and hardship&#44; they each found friends to be to 
them in a father&#39;s place&#44; although his love and tender 
care could never be compensated by acts of the kindest 
relatives and indulgent friends. And one there was 
wdio&#44; feeble of strength&#44; and often and early sul&#41;ject 
to bodily disease&#44; was unable to labour with his hands 
for the support of his weak frame. Was he now left 
to struggle in hopeless and sickening toil for a scanty 
and tearful support&#61; IsTo&#59; for there was a man&#44; be&#8211; 
loved of God and honoured of all that knew him&#44; 
who&#44; though blest with but small means&#44; had yet 
ahvays a mite for those that were needy. He felt for 
the orphan&#8211;boy&#44; took him as his own child&#44; watched 

<pb n="397"/>

over his youth with paternal care&#44; instructed him in 
the way of righteousness&#44; and taught him to fear the 
Creator&#44; and to look to Him for support in all his 
afflictions. And when the youth needed farther as&#8211; 
sistance&#44; more than the beloved teacher himself could 
give&#59; when the light of more extended knowledge 
was&#42; required for his mind &#58; he induced other sons of 
Israel to lend their aid to finish the goodly work which 
he had begun. Years passed away&#44; and the orphan 
sought a home in a distant land&#44; where a relative of 
his mother oflPered him the welcome of a father&#39;s 
house&#58; there his efforts have been blest&#44; and those 
are now his friends&#44; that&#44; but for the assistance of the 
blessed teacher in Israel&#44; would never have known 
his name. The benevolent one has gone to his re&#8211; 
ward before the Father whom he so faithfully served&#44; 
whose laws he so faithfully taught&#59; and the orphan&#44; 
who wept over his father&#39;s bier as one almost forsaken&#44; 
now addresses you&#44; and pleads for the stranger&#44; the 
widow&#44; and the fatherless &#33; 

Although it must be admitted that the task of pro&#8211; 
tecting the children of persons not connected with 
ourselves must be&#44; in a measure&#44; highly laborious and 
unpleasant&#44; especially if&#44; by previous neglect&#44; their 
manners should have become corrupted and their 
minds vitiated &#58; still we ought not to forget&#44; that the 
children are not to be blamed for the negligence of 
their progenitors&#44; and that&#44; if they are vicious and 
stubborn&#44; proper means should be employed to cure 
them of these obstacles to moral improvement. Of 
all means which are likely to effect this end&#44; none 
seems to me more promising than an extended sys&#8211; 
tem of useful&#44; scientific and religious education&#44; of 
VOL. II. 34 

<pb n="398"/>

398 ON THE OBJECTS OF CHARITY. 

which all the children of persons of our persuasion 
should he permitted to partake&#44; not so much a free&#8211; 
school&#44; but one open to all&#44; &#8212; to the wealthy for a 
moderate contribution&#44; and to the poor for whatever 
they can give&#44; or without any price whatever&#44; if their 
means will not permit them to pay. It must be ap&#8211; 
parent to the most casual observer&#44; that many of&#39; the 
evils to which society is exposed proceed from two 
great causes&#44; first&#44; the want of all information&#59; second&#8211; 
ly&#44; the want of correct instruction. Absolute ignor&#8211; 
ance will be conceded on all sides to be very perni&#8211; 
cious&#44; as such a deficiency will leave the mind open 
to be influenced by all impulses which a corrupt world 
may instil&#44; and to be ruled solely by passions and de&#8211; 
sires to which the best of men are subject&#44; but which 
they keep down by moral government. But if we 
come to examine the bad consequences arising from 
a want of correct instruction&#44; we will soon find that 
they are fully&#61; as pernicious as the effects of total ig&#8211; 
norance. Take for instance a young man conversant 
with all the learning of the schools &#59; imagine him to 
be accomplished in the arts of riding&#44; dancing&#44; music&#44; 
and painting &#59; add to these as many other things as 
you please&#44; but leave out a careful religious training&#44; 
which is most likely the only subject either slightly 
touched upon or altogether pretermitted&#58; what&#44; I 
would ask&#44; can you expect from the heartless&#44; finished 
irentleman&#44; as he is termed&#61; Does he bear love for 
God&#61; &#8212; by no means&#44; this >vas not included in his 
course of discipline. Does he look upon his acquire&#8211; 
ments with meekness&#61; is be humble&#61; is he modest&#61; 
not at all &#59; for he was praised for his knowledge in 
Ms own presence&#44; and he has not yet learned that 

<pb n="399"/>

ON THE OBJECTS OF CHARITY. 399 

others can be as wise as himself. &#8212; Does he love his 
fel low&#8211;men &#61; no&#44; not he&#44; for they are all his rivals&#44; 
thev stand in the wav of his preferment&#44; or else&#44; thev 
are too low&#44; too mean&#44; too much beneath his notice. 
And what are the effects of such an education &#61; &#8212; ask 
the beguiled maiden&#44; whose sinful course has driven 
her from a father&#39;s home&#59; ask the deceived asso&#8211; 
ciate&#44; who relied too firmly upon the word of his sup&#8211; 
posed friend&#59; ask the heart&#8211;broken mother&#44; when she 
laments too late that she did not teach her son to 
adore and fear his Maker and to walk in his statutes&#44; 
as his fathers had done before him &#33; It is needless to 
expatiate at greater length upon a proposition so selt&#8211; 
evident. And as Israelites cannot gain a knowledge 
of their religion from strangers&#58; it is evident&#33;y a duty 
incumbent on them to provide teachers of their own 
who&#44; besides being capable of imparting useful knowl&#8211; 
edge and elegant accomplishments&#44; shall also be quali&#8211; 
fied&#44; both by character and information&#44; to teach the 
holy religion we profess. There are abundant ma&#8211; 
terials in this city&#44; the&#8211; chief residence of our brethren 
in America&#44; for the formation of an institution on 
Jewish principles&#59; and doubtless&#44; if sufiicient encour&#8211; 
agement were held out&#44; men of distinguished talents 
would soon be found&#44; who would gladly assume the 
hopeful task of rearing up our youths and our maidens 
in the knowledge and the service of their Creator 
and God. And if&#44; in addition to this&#44; associations 
should be founded&#44; whose aim it would be to procure 
employment for our young men without a profana&#8211; 
tion of the Sabbath&#59; who would endeavour to ele&#8211; 
vate&#8211; the character of our people by making of our 
poor somethhig more useful than itinerant traders &#58; a

blessed spectacle would speedily be exhibited&#44; of our 
community being regenerated from many faults laid 
to its charge &#59; for our houses of worship would be 
filled with devout&#44; attentive adorers&#59; the Sabbath of 
the Lord would become a delight to many&#44; now 
strangers to its blessings &#59; the family circles on the 
festivals would be again completed &#59; and in short we 
should be distinguished for something more than 
merely a successful pursuit of wealth &#59; and no more 
would attach to our name the reproach of our being 
a people bent on the acquisition of earthly goods and 
forgetful of our permanent happiness. &#8212; And never 
tell me&#44; that it is impossible to earn a livelihood with&#8211; 
out transgressing the divine mandates &#59; for how is it 
that our forefathers lived at ease and respected&#44; in 
countries where they were subject to oppression and 
maltreatment&#61; How is it that so many even here 
find time to serve their heavenly Father&#44; and yet 
are blest with all that their hearts can desire &#61; It 
may be that there are great difficulties in the way of 
a strict religious course in large commercial cities&#44; 
where the competition in every employment is so 
very great &#59; but still it seems to be utterly impossible 
to justify the so general forgetfulness of religious 
duties on these grounds&#44; especially as honest candour 
would seem to warrant the assertion that concerted 
exertion would do a great deal towards combating&#44; if 
not entirely removing&#44; the evil. 

Both the objects just mentioned&#44; the difiusion of 
religious knowledge&#44; and the promotion of a stricter 
conformity to religious observances&#44; seem to be prop&#8211; 
erly within the province of your society. For their 
laws say&#58;

1st. Relief to the orphans and widows of deceased 
members.&#42; 

2d. Elementary and religious education&#44; and trades&#44; 
to such orphans&#44; and to the children of indigent 
Jews&#44; giving a preference to those of indigent 
or deceased members. And in all cases&#44; where 
evidence of superior talent in any child shall 
manifest itself&#44; to extend&#44; if practicable&#44; a liberal 
education. 

3d. Aid to all Jews in distress under such reorula&#8211; 
tions as may hereafter be prescribed.&#34; 

It will be seen from the foregoing&#44; that the found&#8211; 
ers of the society contemplated such an institution as 
I have been urging upon your attention &#59; for it is not 
to be supposed&#44; that religious education could be ob&#8211; 
tained at any other than our own schools&#44; nor is it 
credible that&#44; after a child has been relio&#8211;iously edu&#8211; 
cated&#44; he should be bound out to a stranger&#44; and com&#8211; 
pelled to eat of food prohibited by the law&#44; and to 
labour on the days which&#44; as he was taught&#44; are con&#8211; 
secrated to the service of Heaven. &#8212; This surely could 
never have been the intention of the benevolent&#44; who 
associated themselves to diifuse the blessino&#58;s of char&#8211; 
ity. Let them therefore rouse themselves to establish 
the good work which they have contemplated&#59; let 
them draw the children of the rich&#44; of the moderate 
in circumstances&#44; and of the poor&#44; into one common 
school&#44; where all may uniformly be taught the religion 
of our Father in heaven &#59; and if it should then un&#8211; 
fortunately happen&#44; that indigence or early bereave&#8211;

ment throw any child upon the bounty of the world&#44; 
the managers&#44; as fathers of the orphan&#44; will not 
have to contend against ignorance&#44; and against vice&#44; 
brought on by the not knowing the way of life and 
salvation &#33; It is to be hoped that&#44; should such a 
seminary be commenced&#44; none but worthy men should 
be appointed as instructors&#59; and that&#44; on the other 
hand&#44; the wealthy would not disdain to let their 
children mix in fellowship and brotherly love with 
the offspring of the humble&#59; for who knows&#44; but that 
the descendants of the affluent may in after&#8211;life be 
indebted for aid to those who were inferiors to them 
in youth&#59; besides it would teach them to place a 
proper value upon the fleeting possessions of onr 
earthly existence&#44; when they discover that the poor 
too have feelings like themselves&#44; and are endowed 
by the Creator with the same intellect&#44; and are from 
their worth deserving of respect and kindness. And 
if teachers should come among you&#44; O then treat them 
with proper regard&#44; you who are fathers and mothers 
in Israel &#59; endeavour to second their exertions to bene&#8211; 
fit your children&#44; and let these hear nothing from you 
wdiich could in the least tend to induce them to es&#8211; 
teem lightly their spiritual parents I Can any one 
doubt that happy fruits would be the result of such a 
pious course&#61; And what can be the end&#44; if some&#8211; 
thing is not done&#44; and speedily done&#44; to arrest the 
growing evil&#44; and to check the forgetfulness of the 
divine mandates&#44; which has spread its poison so fa&#8211; 
tally for many years over the younger part of the 
American Jews &#61; 

Doubtless the society&#44; that wishes to take charge of 
the poor&#44; the orphan&#44; and the widow&#44; has not means

enough to accomplish all its benevolent plans&#59; but 
year after year its funds are accumulating&#44; and when 
its wealth has greatly increased&#44; it then will be able 
to do whatever the founders at first purposed. But 
shall the rising generation in the mean time languish 
and thirst for the word of God&#44; and find no one to 
satisfy their desire &#61; Shall the poor apply in vain to 
an exhausted treasure&#44; when sickness oppresses his 
humble home&#44; when penury checks his hopeless la&#8211; 
bour &#61; Shall the orphan be cast abroad&#44; with none 
to feel compassion for his helpless state &#61; Shall the 
widow&#44; she&#44; perhaps&#44; who in better days bestowed 
her bread to the hungry and clothed the naked &#8212; shall 
she in her old days be allowed to sufter&#44; because there 
is no one to plead for her&#44; when distress overtakes 
her &#61; &#8212; iTever be this said of men&#44; of Israelites &#33; There 
are here now present those who are greatly blessed 
with means beyond their wants &#58; let them open their 
hearts&#44; and give freely unto the treasury&#44; whence the 
sufferings of many may be relieved&#44; through which 
many may be rescued from ignorance&#44; from igno&#8211; 
miny&#44; and irreligion &#33; They&#44; whose substance is not 
so extensive&#44; let them also give according to their 
abilities&#44; and let them be assured&#44; that no loss will 
accrue from the bounty bestowed to benefit the peo&#8211; 
ple of the Lo4t1&#44; the poor&#44; the needy&#44; and the afflicted. 
&#8212; And&#44; lastly&#44; the poor also&#44; let them give their trifle&#44; 
and let them be convinced&#44; that though the gift be 
small&#44; the ever&#8211;kind Father will yet look upon the 
heart&#44; and bless the sincere offering that is made in 
his service. If all thus contribute&#44; and if all will 
lend their aid and counsel to further the goodly work 
&#8212; blessing and prosperity will attend the efforts of

your society&#44; and they who are now but few in num&#8211; 
ber &#40;which it is hoped may this day be increased 
manifold&#41; will be the supporters of the poor&#44; the 
props of the widow&#44; and the fathers of the father&#8211; 
less. And will not our God bless his servants that 
thus endeavour to glorify his holy NAME &#61; Assur&#8211; 
edly&#44; for these are the words of the inspired one&#44; who 
Siiys &#58; 

&#34; Bring ye all the tenth part into&#44;the treasury&#8211;house&#44; that it may 
serve as a provision in my house&#59; and prove me&#44; I pray you&#44; in 
this&#44; saith the Lord of hosts&#44; if I will not open for you the windows 
of heaven and shower down you blessing without measure.&#34; Mal&#8211; 
achi iii. 10. 

Here&#44; friends and brethren&#44; you have the distinct 
announcement&#44; that benevolence will not be followed 
by temporal loss&#44; besides that it brings imperishable 
treasures. Do you&#44; then&#44; prove the Lord in this&#33; 
open your stores of wealth&#44; fill up his treasury to 
overflowing&#44; and strengthen the hands of the stew&#8211; 
ards in God&#39;s household&#44; that they may be enabled 
to give provision to the poor who live in the world&#44; 
his land &#59; perhaps the Lord may see it and receive 
your doing in favour&#44; and cause much good to result 
from your efforts&#59; and perhaps He may stay&#44; in his 
mercy&#44; the devouring flame&#44; that it consume not agnin 
the labours of many years &#59; perhaps He may decree

and daughters of Yeshurun &#33; join in with the band of 
the faithful who have not relinquished the task of

let not this day pass before you have all resolved to 
serve the Almighty&#44; the everlasting One our God&#44; 
and to love and to fear Him all the days that you may 
live on this earth&#59; so that you may be favourably re&#8211; 
ceived in the embrace of the ever&#8211;blessed Father&#44; 
when your race is run&#44; when you will receive the 
recompense meet for those who remained true and 
firm to the commands of the law&#44; undismayed by 
temptation&#44; unswayed by interest&#44; loving and adoring 
the Being who is God alone&#44; and whose rule is from 
everlastins&#58; to everlasting. 

May the God of our fathers be with you all&#44; and 
bless&#44; guard&#44; and save you&#44; and give you peace and 
contentment here below&#44; and happiness and satisfac&#8211;

have sped hence&#44; to receive at his judgment&#8211;seat their 
portion with the righteous who have obeyed his will &#59; 
and may you rise again to unending life and imper&#8211;
