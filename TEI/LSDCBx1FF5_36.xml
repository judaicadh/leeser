                              <p rend="indent(3)">I take the liberty of writing you this as<lb/> it
                                        is no more than my duty to let you know in what
                                        position<lb/> I am, for <sic>oweing</sic> to the length of
                                        time that I have owed you<lb/> your account you must think
                                        that my principle is bad, but<lb/> I trust that the
                                        following will remove any bad impression you<lb/> may have
                                        formed of me, in the first place I must inform you<lb/> that
                                        had it not have been for the brutality of <persName>Mr.
                                                  Joseph</persName><lb/> during his Treasurership
                                        your account would have been<lb/> paid long ere this, as I
                                        have often begged a dollar of him<lb/> to go to market and
                                        have been refused although I was entitled<lb/> to 40 times
                                        the amount it is true I had no right to make use<lb/> of
                                        your money, but on the other hand I only received it by
                                                  <add>?</add><lb/> and <add>?</add>, and of three
                                        or four I never received it at all. 2ndly<lb/> my salary is
                                        now very limited indeed out of which I have to pay<lb/> £50
                                        a year for two years to come for expenses incurred at
                                        my<lb/> election, finta I have to pay as also income tax,
                                        very heavy<lb/> Doctors bills since my family have been
                                        here, and besides<lb/> my family, a Mother in law and sister
                                        to maintain, so that<lb/> you will see that a Salary of £200

                                        here where every thing<lb/> is so enormously expensive. I
                                        therefore most earnestly<lb/> intreat that you will grant me
                                        time to settle your account<lb/> as God knows that it
                                        grieves me to the heart that I am not able<lb/> to answer
                                        your call as my principle is good but unfortunately<lb/> not
                                        my means. I have endeavored by all the means in my
                                        power<lb/> to send you a something but find it impossible. I
                                        once more<lb/> intreat that this will not be the means of
                                        lessening our<lb/> friendship, but that if in return for
                                        your kindness you think<lb/> there is anything that I can do
                                        for you here, I shall not only<lb/> consider it a pleasure
                                        but a duty to serve you. Hoping<lb/> this will meet with a
                                        favorable reply, and that at all</p>
