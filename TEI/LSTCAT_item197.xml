			<p rend="align(right)"><date>Thursday Evening 19 Decr&#47;50</date></p>
			<p>My dear Sir</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">With reference to our conversation of yesterday<lb/> I have
				concluded that as <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> labors under great<lb/>
				misapprehension as to my course of action in respect<lb/> to the office of Hazan to
				the <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> congregation&#8212;it<lb/> might be quite
				compatible with your friendly feelings<lb/> for both parties were you to acquaint
				him when you<lb/> again write him that I have most emphatically<lb/> denied and ever
				must deny to you and to every one that<lb/> I have ever thought done or said
				anything that could to<lb/> the best of my knowledge and intent&#44; injure in
				the<lb/> remotest degree <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> and his cause. I am
				quite<lb/> aware as I stated to you yesterday that <persName>Mr L.</persName>
				considers<lb/> I have <sic>agrieved</sic> him but I am also equally certain<lb/>
				that I have no little cause of surprise mortification and<lb/> sorrow not to say
				anger at the way <persName>Mr L</persName> has treated me.<lb/> If after four years
				&#40;on my part&#41; agreeable communion<lb/> we have become now estranged&#44; I
				must not and will not<lb/> let <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> or any one else
				suppose that this<lb/> has been through my fault entirely. I may say<lb/> through my
				wickedness&#44; for if the charges<lb/>
				<persName>Mr Leeser</persName> brings directly or indirectly against me<lb/> are
				true. I do not refer to anything he may have<lb/> written</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
			<p>written you&#44; but what I have learnt from others&#44; if these<lb/> can be
				substantiated by him in opposition&#8212;not<lb/> to mere assertion only&#44; but to
				the documentary proofs<lb/> of denial in my possession then I certainly have<lb/>
				acted as one unworthy Israelite and false friend&#8212;which<lb/> I most solemnly
				deny. <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> if I<lb/> understand you aright left it to your
				option<lb/> to show me what he says about me in certain<lb/> letters to you. As you
				know&#44; I have not heard<lb/> or seen the particulars of those letters&#44; but
				you<lb/> are quite at liberty to show <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> these few
				lines<lb/> to which I will add that I have never sought or<lb/> made use of Swiss
				mercenaries either of the press<lb/> or of the K. K Mickveh Israel as I hear is his
				belief<lb/> and if I appear to have been associated with a<lb/> party it is because
				I am not residing in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>&#44;<lb/> the only
				partisanship I have ever thought permissible<lb/> to me&#44; being the support of
				those of the Congregation<lb/> who might consider me worthy to fill the office<lb/>
				<hi rend="underline">when <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> was by his own word and
					deed</hi><lb/>
				<hi rend="underline">no longer a candidate for the office</hi>. I also most<lb/>
				emphatically deny that any one here or abroad<lb/> ever dissuaded me by word or
				letter from<lb/> visiting <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>. <persName>Mr
					Leeser</persName> I believe<lb/> is under the impression I was so advised<lb/>
				All letters on the subject including copies<lb/> of my own&#44; I have in my
				possession and these you</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
			<p>or any one else can inspect&#44; though I cannot suppose<lb/> that any of my friends
				knowing me and not being &#8220;hasty<lb/> to judge&#8221; will doubt my assertions.
				Had any one whom I<lb/> esteem less than <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> formed these
				notions of me<lb/> I would perhaps not care were he disabused or<lb/> not of
				them&#44; but I don&#39;t think I ought to suffer<lb/> unworthy stigmas to fasten on
				me when conscious<lb/> of my innocence&#59; and I therefore repeat you can &#40;if
				disposed&#41;<lb/> send this to <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> that he may see I
				&#40;and I am<lb/> happy to say many friends&#41; cannot admit that I am<lb/> the
				guilty thing he seems to consider me</p>
			<p rend="indent(7)">I am</p>
			<p rend="indent(8)">Yours very truly</p>
			<p rend="indent(8)"><persName role="author">Abraham de Sola</persName></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Of course if&#44; after seeing this my disclaimer of the wrongs<lb/>
				imputed to me&#44; <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> is willing to admit to you that
				he<lb/> may have been deceived with respect to me&#59; I shall&#44; as his<lb/>
				junior waive the consideration that he is yet to reply to<lb/> a letter of mine he
				received some six months back and I will<lb/> address him if he like giving a full
				detail of circumstances<lb/> in my justification of the course pursued by me&#44; of
				if he<lb/> will wait for the more convenient opportunity of a personal
				interview<lb/> &#40;and I cannot suppose that he so &#8220;takes me in his
				heart&#8221; that he<lb/> will not see me when possible&#44; but that he is rather
				willing to<lb/> &#8220;reprove&#8221; me showing me how wrong I have been if he
				can&#44; and then<lb/> forgive me&#41; when I can have with me certain documents
				indispensable<lb/> for elucidation&#44; and if he can &#8220;hold one
				guiltless&#8221; till then&#44; I shall in such<lb/> case consider myself justified
				in addressing him on matters perhaps<lb/> more acceptable under present
				circumstances.</p>
