                        20<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> the ladies had their 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>
                meeting at my house, when<lb/> the sum of $334.20 was handed in as collections. The
                School<lb/> will be opened the <date>27<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date>. I have drawn
                up a code of Bye<lb/> Laws, and officiated as Secretary; but you must not
                mention<lb/> it, as I wish the petticoats to have all the credit. You can<lb/>
                merely say, I gave them my advice and assistance in organizing<lb/> the School. I
                have every reason to believe the school will<lb/> be very successful. The youth of
                both sexes belonging to the<lb/> two congregations in the city, and that of
                    <placeName>Lafayette</placeName> are<lb/> united to attend as pupils; but the
                government of the School<lb/> will be managed by the ladies <sic>worshipping</sic>
                at the Portuguese<lb/> Synagogue, who are now or may hereafter become teachers.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I wish to be informed respecting a female who<lb/> came here some
                weeks ago, a widow, calling herself <persName>Mrs. Rice</persName><lb/> who says she
                has long resided in your city, where her husband<lb/> kept a large
                    <sic>Jeweller's</sic> shop. Her uncle, according to her acct<lb/> resides there
                now, his name is <persName>Brühl</persName>. Her story is to this effect.<lb/> A
                sister named <persName>Fernbein</persName> living at
                    <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName> wrote for her<lb/> and on arriving at that
                city, she found her sister had removed<lb/> to <placeName>N. O.</placeName> No such
                persons, after due inquiry, could be found<lb/> here; and she applied for assistance
                to go back to <placeName>Pa</placeName><lb/> to her uncle. From many circumstances,
                people here think<lb/> she is somewhat of an impostor. I am half inclined to
                that<lb/> opinion myself. However some money was made up for her<lb/> to enable her
                to return via <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName>. She <sic>quitted</sic>
                yesterday.<lb/> She told us her child was poisoned some years ago by her<lb/>
                servant girl. The impression she made has been any thing but<lb/> favourable even
                upon those who espoused her cause.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">All your friends whose name is <persName>Legion</persName> send<lb/>
                their regards, and hoping your health is<lb/> improving, and with best wishes in which<lb/>
                <persName>Mrs. N.</persName> joins I am Truly yours</p>
