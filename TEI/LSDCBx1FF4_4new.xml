			<p><date>March 6/47</date></p>
			<p><addressee>Rev Isaac Leeser</addressee> <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>/<placeName>Montreal</placeName></p>
			<p>My dear Friend</p>
		  <p rend="indent(2)">I write you only to explain why I did not<lb/> write more fully when I send you a Sermon yesterday.<lb/>  In frimis[&#63;]&#8211;I had made up my mind not to send again<lb/> a single line&#44; until I had heard from you&#44; and I was<lb/> the more induced to determine this&#44; since you did not<lb/> even acknowledge the receipt of my last when you<lb/> sent the <date>Feby</date> No of the Occident I acknowledge&#44; I have<lb/> been somewhat amiss in not having sent you the<lb/> article I promised but this has arisen from an<lb/> unavoidable circumstance&#44; viz. The necessity<lb/> of referring to a rather source work which it<lb/> is impossible for me to see in <placeName>Canada</placeName> and I<lb/> have been compelled therefore to write to <placeName>england</placeName><lb/> about it.  To make amends&#44; I sent you a Sermon<lb/> and as I wished to send it you as <del>early</del> soon<lb/> after it was copied as possible&#44; as I was told<lb/> at the Post Office that the American mail was<lb/> just about being closed I thought it better to<lb/> send it you on without delaying a day&#44; as you<lb/> might then be able to insert it your next<lb/> number which I would like  I therefore borrowed<lb/> a wafer at the Post Office&#44; and before this reaches you&#44;<lb/> you will have received it.  If you can find room<lb/> and you think it worthy insertion&#44; may I request<lb/> that you will have the goodness to attend to the</p>

		<pb n="2"/>
		
			<p>proper insertion of the notes&#44; punctuation &amp;c. and that<lb/> there [&#63;] more mistakes in than escape <hi rend="underline">your own</hi><lb/> eye.  You will perceive that in translating a quotation<lb/> from the Psalms.  I have used <persName>Millan&#39;s</persName> beautiful version<lb/> which proceeding&#44; if perhaps novel&#44; I don&#39;t think<lb/> more objectionable than quoting the christian <sic>authorised</sic><lb/> version.  I have even used <persName>Lawth&#39;s</persName>&#44; or <persName>Bro[&#63;]</persName>&#44; version<lb/> when quoting the most sublime of the prophets.  I think<lb/> that such version send much more than the <sic>authorised</sic><lb/> translation to give us <del>an ide</del> I ought rather to say<lb/> to give those who dont read the original&#44; an idea<lb/> of the force &amp; beauty of the Hebrew texts.  Let me<lb/> have your opinion.  I must further say that<lb/> I <sic>dont</sic> forget them in fruits where they drag in<lb/> the [&#63;] <sic>Jasus</sic> &#34;as <persName>Pat</persName> calls him&#44; whether<lb/> he has any right there or not&#44; but recollecting this<lb/> even&#44; Jeandices[&#63;] that as they hear these quotations<lb/> from orthodox lifes[&#63;] that there is no more danger<lb/> in using them than in using any English Bible<lb/> with their objectionable headings or New Testament<lb/> additions&#8212;muit ce&#39;st apez Jour cela&#8212;To save<lb/> postage I have written the Sermon on thin paper and<lb/> [&#63;] for the same reason I wrote the prayer<lb/> on a small piece of paper and I must ask you to<lb/> see that it comes in&#44; in its proper place&#44; it is<lb/> marked to age [&#63;].<lb/>  This prayer which as you</p>

		<pb n="3"/>
		
			<p>will perceive is nothing but a congeries of verses from<lb/> the Parasa &amp; Sftora of the day I must request you to<lb/> alter.  At the commencement instead of its reading and<lb/> hast turned their heart back again &#34;please let it read<lb/> &#34;who will turn their heart back again&#34;&#8211;I am induced<lb/> to make this alteration because however I may<lb/> understand the [Hebrew] I <sic>dont</sic> like to oppose my opinion<lb/> to that [Hebrew] who in his [Hebrew] uses this<lb/> verse in proof of the correctness of the opinion of<lb/> the Rabbinni[&#63;] thus &#34;[Hebrew]&#8212;To his opinion<lb/> I may defer.  I have much that I desire to communicate<lb/> with you upon&#44; but I shall not do so until I<lb/> have heard from you the course of your long<lb/> silence&#44;  Have you any of <persName>Noga&#39;s[&#63;]</persName> <sic>pamphlilets</sic><lb/> <hi rend="underline">Hebrew and English</hi> if you have let me have a copy<lb/>  I sent some names [&#63;] as subscribers but have<lb/> heard nothing from home concerning them&#8211;<lb/> are they in your parcel.  My uncle the publisher<lb/> of &#34;the Voice&#34; wrote me he had sent me the nos &#34;in<lb/> the American Israel[&#63;]&#34;  Is that addressed to you or<lb/> to <persName>Mr Isaacs</persName>.  I received a letter from him last<lb/> week but he says nothing about them.  And now<lb/> dear friend&#44; as I have purposely limited myself<lb/> to a small piece of paper&#44; I must conclude &amp; wishing<lb/> therefore the approaching days of <date>Purim</date> [Hebrew]<lb/> For the delivery of this I am indebted to<lb/> <persName>Mr Bernal</persName>&#44; my [&#63;]<lb/> correspondent&#44; and friend of my family<lb/> how does he get on as [&#63;] minister&#63;  What kind of a person<lb/> is he.  Is he [&#63;]&#63;  Personally I am quite unknown to him.</p>
