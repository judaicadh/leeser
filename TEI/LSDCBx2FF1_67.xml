				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>D&#252;lmen</placeName>&#44; <date>Wednesday</date>&#44;</p>
				<p rend="align(right)"><date>&#40;16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Tammuz&#41;&#44; July 12&#44; 1854</date>.</p>
				<p>Dearest cousin&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Your letter of the <date>20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Iyar &#40;May&#41;</date>&#44;<lb/> which came to me by way of <placeName>Magdeburg</placeName>&#44;<lb/> delighted me all the more in that I saw in it<lb/> your warm family devotion and especially your<lb/> interest and concern and love for me.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Were I still unmarried I would&#44;<lb/> without further thought&#44; consent to your<lb/> request to obtain for myself the position at<lb/> <placeName>San Francisco</placeName>.   I would also and aside from<lb/> the success or failure of this plan&#44; gladly<lb/> have accepted your invitation to make a<lb/> holiday trip to you.  This I could have<lb/> done without losing my position here&#44; for it<lb/> would have given me great pleasure to spend<lb/> some time with a beloved relative&#44; whose name<lb/> has become famous far off&#44; and who has<lb/> accomplished worthwhile things in <placeName>America</placeName> in<lb/> the interests of our holy faith.  However&#44;<lb/> since about a year ago I am happily married<lb/> and I must take into consideration the<lb/> wishes of my beloved wife and not journey</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">2.</p>
				<p>with her quite so far away to a place from<lb/> which she would presumably not have the<lb/> opportunity again to see her aged parents.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">But even if I cannot take into consider<lb/>ation the problematical position&#44; nevertheless&#44; I<lb/> can answer your questions with regard to a friend<lb/> who has ambitions of that sort.  His name<lb/> is <persName>David Steinberg</persName>&#44; and he is&#44; at the present<lb/> time&#44; teacher in the Jewish seminary at <placeName>M&#252;nster</placeName>.<lb/>  The day before yesterday he paid me a visit.  From<lb/> two letters of his friend <persName>Guttheim</persName>&#44; I noticed<lb/> that the latter recently paid you a visit&#44;<lb/> furthermore&#44; that he asked <persName>Steinberg</persName> to<lb/> take steps with regard to the position in <placeName>San<lb/> Francisco</placeName>.  He asked me&#44; therefore&#44; to <del>let you</del><lb/> <del>know</del> request of you to send a word of<lb/> recommendation for him to that place.<lb/>  <persName>Steinberg</persName> has&#44; in addition to a decided philo<lb/>logical bent&#44; devoted to a thorough study of the<lb/> classics.  At this very time he is about to take his<lb/> doctoral examination.  He told me that he is<lb/> thoroughly acquainted with the French language<lb/> &#38; English&#44; however&#44; he has not made any further<lb/> progress than to understand the &#8220;Vicar of<lb/> Wakefield&#8221; without having done much further</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">3.</p>
				<p>reading.  With his thorough philological<lb/> knowledge&#44; however it will not be difficult for him to&#41; make great<lb/> progress in this respect.  The chief thing&#44; however&#44;<lb/> is that it was always his great desire he<lb/> is now 34 years old&#8212;to devote himself to<lb/> the education of the young.  In all the com&#45;<lb/>munities in which he acted as teacher&#44; until<lb/> now&#44; as well as in all his general relationships&#44;<lb/> he has enjoyed general respect and love&#44;<lb/> both with regard to his thoroughness as well<lb/> as his honorable moral character.  As regards<lb/> religious and ceremonial life&#44; his present<lb/> position insures that he lead a ceremonial&#45;<lb/>ly Jewish life&#44; if only not to suffer criticism.<lb/>  Nevertheless&#44; I don&#39;t want to overlook the<lb/> fact that in this respect he inclines towards<lb/> &#42; a mild reform.  However&#44; in matters that<lb/> concern the fundamentals of our holy<lb/> faith&#44; I can safely say that&#44; in so far as I can<lb/> judge human beings&#44; that he is a Jew with<lb/> a sincerely Jewish heart.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Steinberg</persName> thinks that if it is possible he<lb/> would prefer that another man be given the<lb/> position of chazan while he devote himself to<lb/> preaching and religious instruction of the<lb/> young.  This he desires&#44; not because he lacks</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">4.</p>
				<p>the aptitude for such work but because the<lb/> combination of all these activities in one person&#44; es&#45;<lb/>pecially in so large a community&#44; might be too<lb/> exhausting.  He would gladly give up a portion of<lb/> his salary if a chazan were appointed separately.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In the year <date>1851</date>&#44; the second part of my<lb/> Hebrew study and exercise book appeared.  I sent it<lb/> to you through an emigrant but I don&#39;t know<lb/> whether it has been delivered to you.  The reviews&#44;<lb/> of this book&#44; seem very favorable.  It is also<lb/> having a seemingly good sale.  Although it<lb/> was written originally for Jewish schools&#44; it has been<lb/> introduced also in some German<lb/> gymnasia.  Unfortunately&#44; a large number<lb/> of our Jewish teachers are either too ignorant of<lb/> Hebrew or too indifferent to make practical use<lb/> of this book.  On the other hand&#44; some highly re&#45;<lb/>spected and excellent colleagues have let<lb/> me know by letter that since the introduction of<lb/> my book in their schools&#44; the instruction in<lb/> Hebrew has taken a new upward swing and<lb/> has <del>caused a</del> made Hebrew a popular subject&#44; on the<lb/> part of the spiritually awakened children.  Such<lb/> men&#44; however&#44; are exceptional&#44; for most<lb/> Jewish teachers are merely &#8220;hewers of wood<lb/> in the house of God.&#8221;  They limit them&#45;<lb/>selves to the most essential.  Generally<lb/> speaking&#44; Hebrew teaching is torture for<lb/> them&#44; since they themselves are ignorant</p>

				<p>of it.  Most guilty is the &#8220;M&#252;nstersche Ver&#45;&#42;<lb/>einschule&#8221; which does not produce sufficient<lb/> results in this respect&#44; and in spite of the en&#45;<lb/>closed program of studies which has been<lb/> acclaimed throughout the classes of the com&#45;<lb/>munity&#44; it has not until now&#44; improved<lb/> any.  The chief fault lies in the unsatisfactory<lb/> method of the good&#44; but elderly&#44; seminary<lb/> teacher&#44; <persName>Cohen</persName>&#44; who has no understanding<lb/> of how an interest for such studies can be<lb/> planted in his pupils.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">For our needy brothers in <placeName>Palestine</placeName>&#44;<lb/> collections have been taken up rather diligently<lb/> here also.  <placeName>D&#252;lmen</placeName> for example contributed<lb/> 18 &#189; Reichstaler.</p>

The former has four<lb/> children.

The little<lb/> son which she left&#44; is thank God&#44; in good<lb/> health.  <persName>Zanvil</persName> has a good<lb/> medical practice in <placeName>Herzfeld</placeName>&#44;</p>

My dear<lb/> mother is&#44; thank God&#44; still in good health&#44;<lb/> and is at present on a visit at <persName>Procha&#39;s</persName>.<lb/>  Everyone sends you hearty greetings.

In<lb/> order to improve our situation&#44; I intend<lb/> to establish a store&#44; which my wife&#44; who is<lb/> used to such things from her home&#44; will<lb/> have in charge.</p>

A short while ago I heard you<lb/> had given up your position.  Is that really<lb/> so&#63;  Good luck&#44; many blessings to you<lb/> and your work.
