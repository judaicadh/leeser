            <p>Dearest cousin:</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Your letter of the <date>20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Iyar
                    (May)</date>,<lb/> which came to me by way of
                <placeName>Magdeburg</placeName>,<lb/> delighted me all the more in that I saw in
                it<lb/> your warm family devotion and especially your<lb/> interest and concern and
                love for me.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Were I still unmarried I would,<lb/> without further thought,
                consent to your<lb/> request to obtain for myself the position at<lb/>
                <placeName>San Francisco</placeName>. I would also and aside from<lb/> the success
                or failure of this plan, gladly<lb/> have accepted your invitation to make a<lb/>
                holiday trip to you. This I could have<lb/> done without losing my position here,
                for it<lb/> would have given me great pleasure to spend<lb/> some time with a
                beloved relative, whose name<lb/> has become famous far off, and who has<lb/>
                accomplished worthwhile things in <placeName>America</placeName> in<lb/> the
                interests of our holy faith. However,<lb/> since about a year ago I am happily
                married<lb/> and I must take into consideration the<lb/> wishes of my beloved wife
                and not journey</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p rend="align(center)">2.</p>
            <p>with her quite so far away to a place from<lb/> which she would presumably not have
                the<lb/> opportunity again to see her aged parents.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">But even if I cannot take into consider<lb/>ation the problematical
                position, nevertheless, I<lb/> can answer your questions with regard to a
                friend<lb/> who has ambitions of that sort. His name<lb/> is <persName>David
                    Steinberg</persName>, and he is, at the present<lb/> time, teacher in the Jewish
                seminary at <placeName>MÃ¼nster</placeName>.<lb/> The day before yesterday he paid me
                a visit. From<lb/> two letters of his friend <persName>Guttheim</persName>, I
                noticed<lb/> that the latter recently paid you a visit,<lb/> furthermore, that he
                asked <persName>Steinberg</persName> to<lb/> take steps with regard to the position
                in <placeName>San<lb/> Francisco</placeName>. He asked me, therefore, to <del>let
                    you</del><lb/>
                <del>know</del> request of you to send a word of<lb/> recommendation for him to that place.<lb/>
                <persName>Steinberg</persName> has, in addition to a decided philo<lb/>logical bent,
                devoted to a thorough study of the<lb/> classics. At this very time he is about to
                take his<lb/> doctoral examination. He told me that he is<lb/> thoroughly acquainted
                with the French language<lb/> &amp; English, however, he has not made any
                further<lb/> progress than to understand the âVicar of<lb/> Wakefieldâ without
                having done much further</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p rend="align(center)">3.</p>
            <p>reading. With his thorough philological<lb/> knowledge, however it will not be
                difficult for him to) make great<lb/> progress in this respect. The chief thing,
                however,<lb/> is that it was always his great desire he<lb/> is now 34 years oldâto
                devote himself to<lb/> the education of the young. In all the com-<lb/>munities in
                which he acted as teacher, until<lb/> now, as well as in all his general
                relationships,<lb/> he has enjoyed general respect and love,<lb/> both with regard
                to his thoroughness as well<lb/> as his honorable moral character. As regards<lb/>
                religious and ceremonial life, his present<lb/> position insures that he lead a
                ceremonial-<lb/>ly Jewish life, if only not to suffer criticism.<lb/> Nevertheless,
                I don't want to overlook the<lb/> fact that in this respect he inclines towards<lb/>
                * a mild reform. However, in matters that<lb/> concern the fundamentals of our

            <p rend="indent(1)">In the year <date>1851</date>, the second part of my<lb/> Hebrew
                study and exercise book appeared. I sent it<lb/> to you through an emigrant but I
                don't know<lb/> whether it has been delivered to you. The reviews,<lb/> of this
                book, seem very favorable. It is also<lb/> having a seemingly good sale. Although
                it<lb/> was written originally for Jewish schools, it has been<lb/> introduced also
                in some German<lb/> gymnasia. Unfortunately, a large number<lb/> of our Jewish
                teachers are either too ignorant of<lb/> Hebrew or too indifferent to make practical
                use<lb/> of this book. On the other hand, some highly re-<lb/>spected and excellent
                colleagues have let<lb/> me know by letter that since the introduction of<lb/> my
                book in their schools, the instruction in<lb/> Hebrew has taken a new upward swing
                and<lb/> has <del>caused a</del> made Hebrew a popular subject, on the<lb/> part of
                the spiritually awakened children. Such<lb/> men, however, are exceptional, for
                most<lb/> Jewish teachers are merely âhewers of wood<lb/> in the house of God.â They
                limit them-<lb/>selves to the most essential. Generally<lb/> speaking, Hebrew
                teaching is torture for<lb/> them, since they themselves are ignorant</p>

                of studies which has been<lb/> acclaimed throughout the classes of the
