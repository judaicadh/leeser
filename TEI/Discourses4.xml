PREFACE. 



The preceding three volumes in this series were published at two 
different times in 5597 and 5601. Since then I have not&#44; till now&#44; 
collected my sermons into volumes&#44; and the present is the first of 
the third series&#44; which will comprise mainly those addresses deliv&#8211; 
ered from 5601 to 5610&#44; when my connexion with the Mikve Israel 
Synagogue terminated. Since then I seldom committed my re&#8211; 
marks to writing&#44; and depended almost universally on extempora&#8211; 
neous speaking&#44; even without any notes whatever&#44; and it was but 
rarely that I wrote down afterwards what I had delivered from the 
inspiration of the moment. Therefore it has happened that though 
I addressed the congregations all over the country much more fre&#8211; 
quently than before&#44; not many of these speeches can now be re&#8211; 
called. At a later period&#44; should my life be spared&#44; and the public 
desire it&#44; I may write out some of the most important topics which I 
was permitted to discuss before audiences in various places&#44; as their 
substance is by no means forgotten&#59; but for the present this must be 
omitted&#44; as the materials on hand already will swell this collection 
to a far greater extent than was thought likely to be the case when 
my intention to undertake the work was announced in the various 
circulars issued by me. I have made it a rule to lay my writings 
aside without referring to them again&#59; in order that I may judge 
impartially of them when the needed time to use them shall have 
come &#59; and thus it happened that I was both ignorant of their con&#8211; 
tents and not aware of the quantity I had composed till after a por&#8211;

tion of these volumes had been reprinted. I must therefore request 
the public&#44; and my subscribers in particular&#44; to excuse me that the 
amount of matter presented to them is more than was honestly es&#8211; 
timated when their support was asked. It is confidently hoped&#44; 
however&#44; that all the various sermons&#44; addresses&#44; and prayers may 
be found to have sufficient interest to make them somewhat valua&#8211; 
ble for future reference and use&#44; and that they may bo regarded 
hereafter as vehicles of information on many points&#44; and be used for 
private devotion in the family circles of our people. If this wish 
should bo realized&#44; I shall be amply compensated for the thought&#44; 
labour&#44; and care expended in preparing them for the press&#44; and 
presenting them to the public as my humble contribution to Jewish 
religious literature.

DISCOURSES 

ON THE

JEWISH RELIGION. 



DISCOURSE I. 

THE DANGERS OF ISRAEL. 

God of Israel&#44; the everlasting Father&#33; be with us 
in our waking hours&#44; and at the time when we are 
sunk in sleep&#59; protect us by the shadow of thy wings 
when we are living&#44; and shield our spirits under 
the throne of thy grace when our task is ended. 
And watch over us with thy paternal care&#44; and give 
strength to our virtuous resolves&#44; that we may not 
stumble on the path of righteousness which we would 
fain pursue&#44; unless prevented and lured away by the 
temptations of the world and the inclination for evil 
inherent to our frame. O holy One &#33; establish Thou 
iirmly the work of our hands&#44; and cause that through 
us thy name may be glorified&#59; teach us to see the 
errors of our ways&#44; so that we may not profane thy 
blessed service&#44; whilst our selfish ignorance would 
vainly influence us to believe ourselves actuated by 
pious motives. Implant in our hearts a firm brotherly

love towards all Israel our brethren&#44;and remove from 
us and from them all manner of malevolence and 
causeless hatred&#59; and those who presumptuously rise 
up to disturb the peace of thy household&#44; and who 
wickedly endeavour to mislead the children of thy 
adorers from the true path of thy law&#44; confound Thou 
in thy mercy&#44; that the evil they attempt may not take 
root in the minds of thy servants&#59; and grant that 
these as well as all other sinners may speedily dis&#8211; 
cover the perniciousuess of their doings&#44; and return 
unto Thee with a sincere repentance&#44; a repentance of 
love and truth&#44; to be reunited to Thee and thy pure 
worship in laith and humility. And spread upon all 
thy people Israel&#44; wherever be their dwellings&#44; the 
pavilion of thy peace&#44; and cause them to dwell se&#8211; 
curely in the midst of the nations whither Thou hast 
banished them &#59; and preserve them entire as one peo&#8211; 
ple&#44; to be ultimately restored to the mountains of 
Zion&#44; where thy glory is again to dwell as in days of 
old&#44; as in former years&#44; all obeying one law&#44; worship&#8211; 
ping in one manner&#44; servants all with one heart&#44; speak&#8211; 
ing all with one tongue&#44; adoring all the one&#44; O Thee 
alone&#44; our Father&#44; God&#44; and Saviour&#33; Amen.

&#34;It is even a time of trouble unto Jacob&#44; and tbercfrom be sball 
be saved.&#34; 

Let us apply this saying of the great prophet who 
viewed with his own eyes the downfall of Jerusalem&#39;s

glory&#44; a downfall vvhicli others had merely predicted&#44; 
which he&#44; however&#44; had the misfortune to witness as 
well as to foretell&#44; to the present situation of our peo&#8211; 
ple all over the Avorld. It is not to be concealed&#44; that 
for many years past there have gradually sprung up a 
feeling of restlessness under ancestral rules and a striv&#8211; 
ing after innovations&#44; which both threaten the subver&#8211; 
sion of the ancient landmarks&#44; while new ideas have 
been broached which are full of evil portents to our 
existence as a separate religious community. &#34;What 
compared with this danger were the persecutions of 
ignorant ages &#63; Then indeed thousands of innocent 
victims were led forth to the slaughter&#44; and the ad&#8211; 
versaries of Jacob loudly exulted&#44; as the flames con&#8211; 
sumed the many noble martyrs who voluntarily sur&#8211; 
rendered themselves to a painful death&#44; to seal with 
their life&#39;s blood their devoted attachment to the law 
of God. But these slaughters brought no real danger 
to Jacob&#39;s faith&#59; for&#44; though many fell off&#44; though 
many&#44; too feeble or too worldly to choose death&#44; pre&#8211; 
ferred to join themselves to the nations of the earth&#58; 
still the holy example of the glorious sufferers stimu&#8211; 
lated the multitude to love ihe more ardently the re&#8211; 
ligion which their friends had sanctified with their 
last expiring breath. And the greater the danger was 
which each individual incurred for the profession of 
the law of Moses&#44; the greater became the ardour to 
preserve untouched the holy birthright of Jacob&#59; and 
with every effort of the enemy the blood of circum&#8211; 
cision became a more willing sacrifice&#44; the weekly 
Sabbath became a more refreshing day of rest&#44; and 
the acknowledgment of Adonai Echad became more 
ardently the watchword of the house of Israel in all

their dwellings&#44; despite that the enemy stood near&#44; 
eager to seize every opportunity to wreak his hatred 
upon the unoftending sons of Abraham. noble in&#8211; 
deed were those devoted sjiirits who preserved&#44; amid 
all the great tribulations they had to encounter&#44; the 
holy inheritance which Avas theirs from their forefa&#8211; 
thers&#59; and glorious is now their reward&#59; for their un&#8211; 
resisting perseverance has at last overcome the ma&#8211; 
levolence of their opponents&#44; and the name of Israel 
is now more respected than it has been since the dis&#8211; 
persion of our nation&#44; and we are called a people who 
nobly sustained themselves as the preservators of 
Heaven&#39;s holy gift to the children of man&#44; under such 
trials and difficulties as Avould have broken down 
every other people save it be the descendants of him 
who went forth at the bidding of his Master&#44; from Ur 
in Chaldea&#44; to be a stranger in a strange land&#44; him&#8211; 
self and his descendants&#44; for a period of four hundred 
years. 

It was thus&#44; beloved friends&#44; that the means relied 
on for our extermination have wrought the opposite 
effects&#44; and have made dear and precious to us the 
fruit of the tree of life&#44; which flourished abundantly&#44; 
nurtured by the blood of those who strove to preserve 
it from the rude assaults of unholy hands&#44; and to seek 
shelter under its wide&#8211;spreading branches. But now 
and of late we have dwelt in comparative peace&#59; our 
opponents&#44; despairing of destroying us by the sword&#44; 
Lave changed their mode of attack &#59; they open wide 
their arms to receive us in their fatal embrace&#44; and to 
make us forget our destiny&#44; whilst we are invited to 
revel in luxuries and pleasures&#44; even literallly&#44; in lux&#8211; 
uries and pleasures forbidden by our holy laws&#44; and

death&#8211;bringing to our national existence. Now the 
Jews are called brothers&#44; yea the elder brothers of 
the new recipients of the law in the manner it was 
modified to suit a gentile world &#33; But is the Jew as 
such more loved&#63; or his law more prized&#63; O no&#44; 
for now is a time of trouble to Jacob&#44; and may God 
in his wisdom and mercy save him therefrom. The 
seeming security is a fatal delusion&#44; my brethren &#33; the 
haters of our name wish to induce us to give up to 
flattery that which force could never obtain from us. 
They therefore pretend to mourn over our blindness&#44; 
over our literal attachment to the word of the law&#44; 
whilst&#44; they allege&#44; we are unmindful of the spirit 
and essence of religion. They therefore tell us&#44; that 
the Jew is unwise to preserve his separate position 
and his distance from his gentile friends&#59; they wish 
to make him believe that it is of no moment whether 
he eat of one sort of food or the other&#59; they tell him&#44; 
it is of no moment whether he observe the first day 
of the week or the seventh as devoted to rest and 
worship &#59; they tell him it is of no moment whether he 
wed a daughter of the stranger or a maiden from the 
children of the faithful &#58; they tell him these absurdi&#8211; 
ties and many others &#59; and shall we yield to these ad&#8211; 
vances &#63; or are we to stand idly by and make no effort 
to counteract the evil which is thus impending &#63; Be&#8211; 
lieve me&#44; that theoretical religion is but a mockery of 
Judaism. Ours&#8211; is not a system of faith merely&#44; it is 
far more&#44; it is a system of actions which is to regu&#8211; 
late our conduct as individuals&#44; as members of the 
community&#44; as children of the everlasting Father&#33; 
For so we read in Deuteronomy&#44; vi. 2&#44; 3 &#58; &#34; In order 
that thou mayest fear the Lord thy God&#44; to observe 

1&#42; 

<pb n="6"/>

all his statutes and commandments which I command 
thee&#44; thou&#44; thy sou&#44; and thy son&#39;s son&#44; all the day&#58;&#63; of 
thy life&#44; and in order that tliydays maybe prolonged. 
Hear then&#44; Israel&#44; and observe to do&#44; so that it may 
be well witli thee&#44; and that ye may greatly multiply&#44; 
as the Lord the God of thy fathers hath promised 
thee&#44; in a land flowing with milk and honey.&#34; In 
what then does our religion consist&#63; Surely in actions&#44; 
in individual piety&#44; in neighbourly love&#44; and in devo&#8211; 
tion to the Supreme Ruler of the universe. Is there 
then not danger in listening to the advice of strangers&#44; 
in even weighing for a moment whether their argu&#8211; 
ments be of weight or otherwise &#63; For to doubt even 
of the necessity of our duties as we have received 
them is incipient treason&#44; and is already the first step 
to rebellion against the Lord &#33; And has it come to 
this that we&#44; the first inheritors of the law&#44; are to be 
guided by those who borrowed some of its precepts 
from us&#63; are Israelites to govern themselves by the 
erroneous ideas which the gentiles have engrafted 
upon our simple mode of interpreting Scriptures&#63; 

Some may say&#44; that they will take reason for their 
guide&#44; and apply the light of an enlightened modern 
philosophy to teach them the proper explanation of 
the law&#33; But this is the very danger which now 
threatens the house of Jacob&#44; of which we have been 
speaking. It is false reasoning to ask&#58; &#34; Why are we 
to kill our beasts after the prescribed mode of the an&#8211; 
cients &#63; why are we not to mingle at tlie friendly board 
with our gentile friends&#63; what harm can there arise 
from my marrying the woman whom I love&#44; ahhough 
we differ in speculative opinions&#63; what good can the 
Lord devise by my impoverishing myself by an ob&#8211;

servance of the festivals and the Sabbath&#63; what good 
can result from our fasting on certain days to com&#8211; 
memorate the destruction of the Jewish empire &#63; 
foi&#8211; are we not free&#44; arc we not equals in the eyes of 
the law&#63; are not offices open to us no less than to 
other citizens&#63; can we not boldly profess our religion&#63; 
what need is there then to look forward to a restora&#8211; 
tion to oui&#8211; ancient land&#44; a country which we neither 
desire nor think equal to the states of civilized na&#8211; 
tions where we live &#63;&#34; But let us reply to these false 
positions &#58; The law was given to render us a separate 
people&#44; in order to make the glory of God known ul&#8211; 
timately to all nations of the earth&#59; therefore we were 
to be separate in our manners and habits no less than 
in the superior knowledge which had been given to 
us of the UNITY of God. And to prevent our uniting 
with those by whose opinions ours might become cor&#8211; 
rupted&#44; by being inmates at tbeir houses and partakers 
of their food&#44; we were ordered to observe certain for&#8211; 
malities with the food we are to take for our suste&#8211; 
nance&#44; in order to be even in mere bodily matters re&#8211; 
minded of the high destiny which is ours&#44; and of the 
great goodness of the Creator in selecting us to be the 
instruments of his grace and love to all the children 
of man&#44; and to set an insuperable bar to a too close 
intimacy with persons differing from us in their rule 
of life. &#8212; And yet when the fair daughter of the stran&#8211; 
ger attracts us&#44; and our desire is kindled&#44; shall we 
hasten to sacrifice at her feet our attachments to the 
law and our parental commands &#63; Ay&#44; is this obeying 
the voice of the Most High&#63; Tell me &#8212; can Israel 
remain a people when her sons swerve from the law&#44; 
drawn away by the ties of unholy kindred &#63; Or say

8 THE DANGERS OF ISRAEL. 

you&#44; we wed not by forswearing&#44; as of old it was wont&#44; 
the religion of our fathers&#63; But toll me then&#44; does 
the daughter of the stranger worship with you at the 
same shrine &#63; does she too bend the knee to the One&#44; 
who is Israel&#39;s God&#44; as do the daughters of our people&#63; 
or does she teaeh her children to acknowledge the pure 
faith&#44; and to pray to none save the Creator&#44; to acknowl&#8211; 
edge no law save the law which lie ordained &#63; Or ra&#8211; 
ther&#44; will she not endeavour to lead them to her mode 
of thinking&#44; and to educate her children in tenets 
and ceremonies which are and ought ever to be for&#8211; 
eign to our people&#63; And say truly&#8211;&#44; will not the evil 
spread&#44; and bring a canker into our vitals&#44; and destroy 
the remnant that lias escaped the many bitter perse&#8211; 
cutions and trials we liad to encounter &#63; No&#44; brothers 
of the house of Israel &#33; the gentile blood must not min&#8211; 
gle witli that of Jacob &#59; for too many of the patriarch&#39;s 
sons and daughters have already been sacrificed to 
this destructive intercourse&#44; and too many families 
have already been cut off from the community of the 
faithful&#44; as our own eyes have seen. 

The festivals and Sabbaths too we are to deem of 
no importance&#59; we fear being impoverished by our 
forsaking our daily toil. But are we believers&#44; are we 
the descendants of those who followed the guidance 
of Moses into the trackless wilderness&#44; fed for forty 
years by God&#39;s providence&#44; Avithout ploughing the 
soil&#44; or reaping a harvest&#63; And did not millions 
upon millions rest on the Lord&#39;s holy days&#44; and yet 
obtain bread to eat and raiment to put on &#63; and are 
we to doubt&#44; to hesitate whether it be prudent to 
obey &#63; to ask&#44; &#34; what is this day more than other 
days&#44;&#34; as once a scoffing heathen did of one of our 

<pb n="9"/>

THE DANGERS OF ISRAEL. 9 

ancient sages &#63; What is this day &#63; Even the day 
ordained by the Lord&#44; instituted by his providence 
to bring peace&#44; and rest&#44; and refreshment to the la&#8211; 
bourer wearied by toil&#44; and to bid the soul rejoice in 
a renewed love to her Maker. For so we read &#40;Exo&#8211; 
dus xvi. 28&#44; 29&#41; &#58; &#34; And the Lord said unto Moses&#44; 
How long refuse ye to observe my commandments 
and my laws&#63; See&#44; that the Lord hath given you 
the Sabbath&#44; therefore He giveth you on the sixth 
day the bread for two days &#58; abide ye every man in 
his place&#44; let no man go out from his place on the 
seventh day.&#34; It is want of faith&#44; a wicked doubting 
of the goodness and of the truth of God&#44; to suppose 
that any injury can result from the observance of the 
holy rest &#59; for lie who provided manna for two days 
to those who came forth from Egypt&#44; can and does 
send his blessing upon our labours even at tliis day&#44; 
and we may truly say with David &#40;Ps. xxxvii&#44; 25&#41;&#44; 
&#34; I have been young and now am old &#59; yet I have 
not seen the righteous forsaken&#44; nor his children 
besiffino&#59; bread.&#34; And admit for a moment that our 
keeping Sabbath should absolutely deprive us of an 
opportunity of acquiring a large share of wealth &#58; still 
then would we be more likely of enjoying the portion 
of worldly goods which we have lawfully obtained&#44; 
than we should be in consuming the immense hoard 
which unlawful striving should have brought. And 
as regards the notion&#44; that the Creator cares not 
about the particular day&#44; provided one out of seven 
be set apart to his service&#44; we must say that such a 
mode of arguing would be subversive of every thing 
like positive religion. The Scriptures are emphatic 
as to the precise period which has been commanded&#59; 

<pb n="10"/>

10 THE DANGERS OF ISRAEL. 

and even that period&#44; or no other&#44; must we sanctify 
and set apart as devoted to the serviee of our Creator. 
Then as to the fasts commemorative of our nation&#8211; 
al downfalK say not that our captivity is ended&#33; 
Ave are scattered&#44; not gathered together&#59; we are di&#8211; 
vided&#44; not united &#59; we are severed&#44; and not yet are 
Judah and Ephraim one on the mountains of IsraeL 
And say where is tlie glory of the law which is to en&#8211; 
lighten all nations&#63; where is the light of truth which 
is to guide all the families of the earth &#63; are our hearts 
one in the service of the Most High &#63; are there no 
dissensions in the midst of our scattered communi&#8211; 
ties &#63; has Elijah come&#44; and are the liearts of parents 
turned to the children&#44; and the liearts of children to 
their parents&#63; And can Judah awaken her harp to 
hymns of praise in every land&#44; unawed by the threat 
of the adversary &#63; Alas &#33; alas &#33; our harps are still 
hung upon the willows&#44; and the souls of the sons&#8211; of 
Jacob are still grieved because of the burning which 
the Lord has burned. O &#33; yet is desolate the beauti&#8211; 
ful Jerusalem&#59; yet is captive the daughter of Zion&#59; 
and over every laud her sons are scattered&#44; and they 
wander from clime to clime to seek rest for their 
weary foot&#44; and to provide sustenance for their little 
ones &#59; with anxious care oppressed&#44; scorned not rarely 
for the sake of their belief&#44; for their unswerving truth 
and faithfulness to God&#39;s ancient law&#44; they lift their 
eyes on high and ask for that protection which they 
so much need from their God&#44; wiio yet never forsook 
his people. O &#33; let us then fust&#44; and let us pray to 
our Creator on the days which are devoted to the 
memory of our national downfall&#44; and let us not for&#8211; 
get in our prosperity those of our brethren who yet 

<pb n="11"/>

languish in sorrow and oppression&#59; and let us in our 
exultation over the liberty we enjoy not forget&#44; that 
it is not our own strength of arm nor our wisdom 
which has furnished us enlargement&#44; but the mercy 
of the Lord&#44; extended to us not for our righteousness&#44; 
but only because He is good&#44; and for the sake of the 
covenant which He swore unto our fathers. 

These are some of the views which hastily have 
presented themselves to my mind in dwelling on the 
subject of the erroneous ideas which an intercourse 
with friendly gentiles and the false reasoning of a 
miscalled improving philosophy have of late forced 
upon our observation. I mean not that we should 
reject all instruction which gentiles may offer us&#44; to 
discard the light of reason in entering upon religious 
investigations &#59; but to impress upon your minds&#44; 
brothers and sisters of the house of Israel &#33; to take 
the light of our own ancients&#44; the manner of inter&#8211; 
pretation which has been handed down to us&#44; to 
abide by the customs which long and well&#8211;established 
usage has sanctioned&#44; in vour mode of thinkino&#59; and 
in your manner of acting through life. The oppo&#8211; 
site tendency&#44; to mark out new ways&#44; to fly after new 
customs&#44; is the danger which threatens the peace and 
the unity of the house of Jacob. But dangers as 
great almost&#44; &#8212; for I believe this to be the greatest 
we ever encountered&#44; &#8212; have passed over us&#44; without 
permanently injuring the vineyard of the Lord&#44; the 
house of Israel &#59; and guided by his mercy let us hope 
that this cup of bitterness and confusion too will pass 
away from us&#44; and leave us&#44; as after every danger 
hitherto&#44; more devoted and more united in the cause 
of the law of God.

Note. &#8212; The above address was delivered before the Shearith 
Israel Congregation of Charleston&#44; South Carolina&#44; which had then 
been recently organized in consequence of a bare majority of the 
old congregation&#44; Beth Elohim&#44; having adopted an organ and other 
fancies of modern reform&#44; llaving been invited to Savannah on 
some official engagement&#44; I remained over for a few days at Charles&#8211; 
ton&#44; and was in consequence requested to speak in the temporary 
Synagogue&#44; on the upper floor of a warehouse on Meeting Street&#44; 
which had been fitted up as a place of worship. The contrast with 
the handsome new Synagogue then nearly completed and the other 
circumstances which compelled my hearers to separate from their 
former associates&#44; called forth the train of thought&#44; which has 
found expression in the above. &#8212; Twenty six years have since then 
elapsed&#44; and now the two bodies are again unitecl under the old 
name&#44; and I have had several times an opportunity to sjieak to the 
reunited Kahal in the old Synagogue which has been restored and 
renovated by the combined efforts of the two divisions&#44; i&#59;fter the 
eflects of war had nearly destroyed the sanctuary. The event is 
deeply suggestive of serious reflection&#44; which all true Israelites can 
readily institute for themselves without my prompting.

O Lord&#44; God of our fathers&#44; Abraham&#44; Isaac&#44; and

thy word&#44; look down&#44; we beseech thee&#44; from thy high

in this house&#44; which we have devoted unto Thee&#59; and 
as Thou wast pleased to dwell in ancient days&#44; in visi&#8211; 
ble glory&#44; like a consuming fire on the summit of Si&#8211; 
nai&#44; and in the tabernacle which our forefathers had 
reared&#59; so do Thou come now and dwell in the midst 
of us&#44; though unseen by our bodily eyes&#44; in these 
walls&#44; and fill our hearts with thy spirit&#44; so that we 
may devote ourselves to thy service and live in thy 
fear and consecrate unto Thee our thou Hits and our 
will&#44; even as we are commanded in the law which 
Thou didst make known to our fathers. We farther 
beseech Thee to bless the labour of our hands&#44; and 
to send increase&#44; prosperity and peace among our 
habitations&#44; in order that we may be free from cor&#8211; 
roding care&#44; and enabled to live without the tempta&#8211; 
tions to which we otherwise might be exposed by the 
contentions and distress of mind inherent to penury 
and want. Give us&#44; likewise&#44; understanding and wis&#8211;

faithlnl to oiii&#8211; trust. You liave done well not to rest 
until this sanctuaiy arose out of its ashes&#44; and it fore&#8211; 
shadows prosperously for the maintenance among you 
of the ancient system of faith which has been ours 
from time immemorial. And it is truly consolatory 
to observe the growing desire manifested in many 
places of this country to promote religious worship&#44; 
and to diffuse the proper understanding of our relig&#8211; 
ion. This fact is doubly gratifying&#44; after the distress&#8211; 
ing state of indifference which has so long prevailed&#44; 
and which had caused many to doubt of the perma&#8211; 
nence of our existence as a distinct community&#44; more 
espcciallj&#8211; since so many individuals have forsaken 
the covenant of Abraham&#44; whilst others have forsworn 
their faith altogether&#44; and whilst others asrain have 
intermarried with the gentiles&#44; and become thereby 
lost to the house of Jacob. All these lamentable in&#8211; 
stances of dereliction from duty caused our enemies 
to rejoice&#44; they fancied that Ave would gradually di&#8211; 
minish&#44; and that our name would&#44; after a lapse of 
time&#44; be the only remembrance of what we had been. 
Even many sincere Israelites at times desponded&#44; and 
feared that tlie many apostacies would seriously in&#8211; 
jure us&#44; and that only by constant arrivals from for&#8211; 
eign climes could our race be preserved in the Western 
hemisphere. But&#44; tlumks be to the Lord of our des&#8211; 
tinies &#33; we begin to see a brighter sky&#44; although yet 
lieavy clouds arc hanging over us&#44; which but too much 
forebode evil and sorrow. Lukewarmness and in&#8211;

strongly impressed on our minds &#59; nevertheless&#44; there 
appear signs of convalescence&#44; of which one is the 
ceremony of dedication which we have just performed. 
For years have elapsed&#44; I may say many weary and 
darksome years&#44; since the service peculiar to Israel&#8211; 
ites was performed in this city &#59; and the house of God&#44; 
after having heen deserted by worshippers&#44; and after&#8211; 
wards consumed by tire&#44; remained&#44; since its having 
been rcbuih&#44; untrodden by those who come to pray&#59; 
but now a new fceling has been awakened&#44; and you 
are assembled to offer your adoration after the good 
ancestral rule&#44; and let us hope&#44; with feelings of high 
resolve&#44; to remain entire in the path of duty as sons 
of Israel worthy of being the descendants of those 
who fled hither from the persecution of tyrants&#44; to 
obey conscientiously the law of Moses&#44; which was 
prohibited unto them in their native land. Such&#44; 
my friends&#44; were your forefathers&#59; men who were 
drawn to their homes by the ties of wealth&#44; of place 
and high standing&#44; and who nevertheless quitted it 
in order to be enabled to follow the honest dictates 
of their conscience in the new lands of the Western 
World. And now you have arisen after them&#44; to de&#8211; 
clare your adherence to the same faith for which they 
suffered so much &#59; and shall it be said&#44; that you are 
unmindful of their example&#63; &#8212; is it merely for to&#8211;day 
that you are to come hither&#44; whilst the desire is awak&#8211; 
ened to dedicate the house of God&#63; &#8212; or rather&#44; will 
you not long remember the occasion which brings us 
to this house&#44; and let it call up in you a pious senti&#8211; 
ment which is to endure for years&#44; for your whole 
life &#63; For what is life without virtue &#63; &#8212; what are our 
days without devotion &#63; Look&#44; my friends&#44; upon hirn

who values nothing&#59; but worldly advantages&#44; who sees 
no good in any thing which lays a check upon his 
appetite&#44; which throws obstacles in the way of his 
pursuits &#58; and do yon think that his days are days of 
happiness&#63; O no I give him the fill to satiety of his 
desires&#44; still lie cannot say&#44; that real tranquillity ever 
follows his enjoyments&#59; bestow on him the utmost 
fruits of his ambition or his avarice&#44; and still he can&#8211; 
not say that he has enough of what he so ardently 
craves. There is something so unsubstantial in mere 
worldly things&#44; something so powerless&#44; that their 
fruition opens but farther avenues of desiring&#44; or 
fairly causes us to feel disgust&#44; whilst others perhaps 
envy us because of the extent of our means for pro&#8211; 
curing happiness&#44; whereas we ourselves feel languid 
and melancholy&#44; and deplore the evil of our appor&#8211; 
tioned lot. But turn we to things that are not of 
this earth&#44; to the beatitude that results from piety 
and devotion&#44; and we shall there find true sources of 
happiness&#59; for there&#44; when we rejoice over our suc&#8211; 
cess&#44; we need not fear that another has cause for grief&#44; 
which is too often the case in Avorldly enjoyments &#59; 
because when the conqueror sings the song of tri&#8211; 
umph over the vancjuishcd foe&#44; whilst cities are re&#8211; 
splendent with brilliant lights over some signal vic&#8211; 
tory&#44; tliousaiuls mourn over relatives slain&#44; over friends 
dear and prized wlio never more will return unto 
them from the plains&#44; where man met his fellow&#8211;man 
in deadly battle array. And whilst the voluptuary 
revels in his wine&#8211;cup&#44; and is vociferous concerning 
the qualities of his fatal friend&#44; the suficring wife sighs 
at home over the estrangement of her lost husband&#44; 
and helpless children perhaps cry aloud for bread&#44;

wliilst none is near to provide for their pressing wants. 
But when the righteous returns to his home in the 
consciousness that by his timely exertion some suffer&#8211; 
ing brother has been relieved from want&#59; or that 
some mourner has received consolation from his pious 
ndvice&#59; or that some sinner has been awakened to a 
consciousness of his wrong and iniquity &#59; or that some 
one ignorant of the ways of God has been enlightened 
by his instruction&#44; and taught to look towards God 
for aid and support &#58; say&#44; who can suffer at the result 
he has achieved &#63; &#8212; or rather&#44; is not a happy feeling 
also enkindled in the hearts of others&#63; &#8212; do not his 
fellows partake of his triumphs&#44; which are conducive 
to the happiness of many&#44; to the injury of no one &#63; 
O true&#44; an avaricious feeling is engendered&#44; an avarice 
after more virtue&#44; a desire for more extended useful&#8211; 
ness&#59; a feeling of dissatisfaction too is produced&#44; at 
the smallness of the results of the labours of piety&#44; 
and the little benefit which every individual exertion 
j&#41;roduces. But tell me&#44; what will be the effect of 
this desire for more virtue &#63; &#8212; will it be the amassing 
of more useless wealth &#63; &#8212; the striving after more un&#8211; 
substantial renown &#63; no &#59; for the result will be 
akin to the desire&#44; and the righteous man will strive 
to add to his means of righteousness&#59; he Avill ask the 
Lord for more light&#44; and for more blessing upon his 
exertions in the Held of godliness in which he has 
laboured. 

And thus&#44; whilst with worldly pursuits more cares 
are added&#44; and more disappointments heaped up with 
every addition to our means&#44; a different result will 
attend an increase in piety&#59; for with every new deed 
more tranquillity&#44; more satisfaction&#44; more hopefulness&#44;

will be added&#44; and every step in advance which we 
take will render us more fitted to become active and 
vigorous in the execution of that part of our task 
which we have not yet accomplished. And even 
they who have so great a love for wealth and renown&#44; 
should still prize virtue and be sedulous for its attain&#8211; 
ment&#59; for thereby they secure to themselves still more 
the things they value &#59; since with the absence of fraud 
from our business&#44; our property&#44; be it large or be it 
small&#44; will be left the more securely undisturbed in 
our possession&#59; the good name which is not based 
upon trick and falsehood may well stand the attacks 
of malice and envy unharmed&#44; because unassailable&#59; 
and the security&#44; tlie absolute certainty almost of our 
retaining&#44; in all probability&#44; that which is once ours&#44; 
will&#44; or rather ought to&#44; incite us to seek honour and 
riches only in the way of virtue and righteousness. 
And which is this way&#63;&#8212; where are we to seek for 
the principle which is to secure unto us life and hap&#8211; 
piness&#44; and place our temporal welfare upon the firm 
basis we have been speaking of&#63; Only in the law of 
God are we to look for thie way&#44; and its words will 
point out to us the principle we are in quest of. For 
if we act up to its precepts&#44; we will omit no oppor&#8211; 
tunity of fortifying our minds with heavenly wisdom&#44; 
and our actions will best comport with our own hap&#8211; 
piness&#44; and promote&#44; to the utmost of our ability&#44; the 
welfare of our fellow&#8211;men. And so says Solomon&#44; 
&#34;Happy is the man that tindeth wisdom&#44; and the 
man that getteth understanding. For the merchan&#8211; 
dise of it is better than the merchandise of silver&#44; 
and the gain thereof better than tine gold. She is 
more precious than rubies&#44; and all the things thou 

<pb n="21"/>

canst desire are not to be compared nnto her. Length 
of days is in her right hand&#44; and in her left are riches 
and lionour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness&#44; 
and all her paths are peace.&#34; 

&#34;She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her&#44; and every&#8211; 
one that firmly graspeth her will bo made happy.&#34; Prov. iii. 18. 

And in trnth&#44; no course of life can be the way of 
peace&#44; which looks not to the wisdom of God for its 
guide &#59; no one can say that he has stretched forth his 
hand after the fruit of life&#44; who is ignorant of the 
commandments of the Lord. Because it is knowl&#8211; 
edge alone of our duties which can make us aware of 
what we should do&#59; and ready obedience and resig&#8211; 
nation to the Divine will&#44; or as the Scriptures call it&#44; 
the laying hold on wisdom&#44; can alone enable us to 
execute the duties which we know to be required of 
us. &#34;What then should you resolve upon at this day&#63; 
a day joyful to you&#44; my beloved brethren&#44; because on 
it you see accomplished a long&#8211;deferred hope&#44; and 
have gratified the wish of praying in this building 
after the manner of the house of Israel &#63; nothing 
else than to secure your temporal no less than your 
everlasting happiness&#44; by making every effort within 
your power to become acquainted with your duties&#44; 
as sons of Jacob&#39;s household&#44; and to strive to remove 
every evil practice&#44; be this social or religious&#44; which 
the corruptions of the times may have introduced 
among you. Do not merely consecrate a building of 
wood and stone&#44; a building which is perishable and

liable to decay&#59; but do more&#44; purify your immortal 
spirits&#44; consecrate your hearts&#44; dedicate yourselves to 
the service of the Most High&#44; be yourselves holy&#59; 
for the Lord your God is hoiy&#44; and desires of you a 
holiness and simplicity of purpose which catmot put 
any thing in comparison or competition with his will&#44; 
as expressed in the law which is in your possession. 
This consecration of yourselves should consist&#44; as we 
have hinted already&#44; in the subduing of all unhallowed 
feelings&#44; in regulating the passions inherent to man&#44; 
and in teaching you to gratify these natural propensi&#8211; 
ties only then&#44; when they do not enter into conflict 
with the law of God&#44; and cannot in the least become 
injurious to yourselves individually and to your fel&#8211; 
low&#8211;men&#44; whether as individuals or society at large. 
So as regards simple obedience&#44; you should be care&#8211; 
ful to follow implicitly all the commandments which 
may belong to your circle of action. As respects 
yourselves you should preserve both mind and body 
free from impurities &#8212; you should not indulge in vi&#8211; 
cious propensities&#44; never allow anger&#44; envy&#44; malevo&#8211; 
lence&#44; hatred&#44; or duplicity to take root in your heart&#44; 
and not be guilty of those indulgences and excesses 
which undermine the health and render the body un&#8211; 
fit for a proper habitation of the soul&#44; and may cause 
you to be carried to an untimely grave&#44; as victims of 
those transgressions which&#44; though pleasant to ap&#8211; 
pearance in the beginning&#44; yet take ultimately dread&#8211; 
ful vengeance on those who were weak enough to 
yield&#44; when resistance was no less necessary than 
wise. And as regards your fellow&#8211;men&#44; look upon 
all as brothers &#8212; give to each his just due &#8212; be punc&#8211; 
tual in the discharge of your pecuniary obligations

to all who may have claims upon you &#8212; rob no one of 
his reputation &#8212; be indulgent rather to others&#39; faults 
&#8212; condemn not hastily &#8212; and if you have to contend 
for your own rights&#44; be especially careful that you 
trample not on the rights of others. In short&#44; love 
all men&#44; and deny to no one the claims of Ijumanity 
and good fellowship&#59; not alone to the sons of Israel&#44; 
but also to every other man&#44; be his creed what it 
may. You are not the judges of the mercy of God&#44; 
you know not to whom He will be gracious&#59; you 
cainiot tell who has merited&#44; and will therefore re&#8211; 
ceive&#44; his favour &#59; you cannot set limits to his bounty 
and goodness&#59; do therefore act mercifully and kindly 
towards all men&#44; and prove&#44; by your conduct&#44; that 
religious intolerance&#44; that most odious and pernicious 
feature&#44; which has so long disfigured the annals of 
mankind&#44; has no abiding&#8211;place in the heart of sin&#8211; 
cere Israelites. Act always the part of good citizens&#44; 
and never forget that there are gentiles who have 
a kindly regard for our people&#44; as was evidenced 
by the liberal&#8211;minded of your fellow&#8211;citizens in this 
place&#44; who&#44; though strangers to our creed&#44; contrib&#8211; 
uted&#44; unsolicited&#44; towards erecting the house of pray&#8211; 
er wherein we are now assembled. Such an act 
proves that not all differing from us despise our faith&#44; 
and it is accordingly our duty to be doubly diligent 
to show that mercy to all men which our religion de&#8211; 
mands&#44; but which was falsely said we were ordered 
to exliibit towards Israelites only. 

In short&#44; let the present joyful occasion be the 
means to awaken in you all the noble characteristics 
of our religion&#44; and let no day hereafter pass without 
your doing something to prove that the meeting of

to&#8211;day was something morG than an idle exhibition. 
Were it&#44; however&#44; that no good should result from a 
dedication of this sanctuary&#44; it would&#44; I am almost 
tempted to say&#44; have been better had it remained in 
ruins &#59; for nothing is more odious in the sight of our 
Maker than insincerity &#59; and public worship without 
piety is that feature against which our blessed proph&#8211; 
ets so frequently inveighed. Truth &#8212; thankfulness &#8212; 
meekness &#8212; mercy &#8212; these are the characteristics of a 
godly life&#44; which will cause prayer to ascend on high&#59; 
deceit &#8212; scorn &#8212; pride &#8212; oppression &#8212; are qualities 
which will close unto us the gates of happiness if 
even we come with some good deeds to plead for an 
extenuation of our sins. For so says Isaiah &#58; &#34; When 
ye come to appear before me &#8212; who hath required 
this at your hand to tread down my courts&#63;&#34; &#40;i. 12.&#41; 
&#34; Your new&#8211;moons and your appointed feasts my soul 
hatetb&#59; they are become a burden unto me&#59; I am 
weary to bear them. And when ye spread forth your 
hand&#44; I will hide my eyes from you &#58; yea&#44; when ye 
make ever many prayers&#44; I will not hear&#44; your hands 
are full of blood. Wash you&#44; make yourselves clean &#59; 
put away the evil of your doing from before my eyes&#44; 
cease to do evil&#59; learn to do well&#59; seek justice&#59; re&#8211; 
lieve the oppressed&#59; judge the fatherless&#59; plead for 
the widow.&#34; &#40;14&#8211;17.&#41; 

So also the Psalmist &#40;Ps. 1. 16&#8211;21.&#41; &#58; &#34; But unto tlie 
wicked God saith&#44; What hast thou to do to declare 
my statutes&#44; and why bearest thou my covenant upon 
thy mouth &#63; Seeing thou hatest instruction&#44; and cast&#8211; 
est my words behind thee. When thou secst a thief&#44; 
then thou runnest with him&#44; and with adulterers thou 
hast thy portion. Thou lettest loose thy mouth with 

<pb n="25"/>

LIFE IN FAITH. 25 

evil&#44; and thy tongue frameth deceit. Thou sittest 
and speakest against thy brother&#59; against thy own 
mother&#39;s son thou utterest slander.&#34; 

AVe could readily quote many more passages to 
prove that the Bible bears emphatic testimony against 
worship without piety&#44; against outward devotion 
where brotherly love is wanting. JSTo&#44; brethren &#33; the 
religion of the Jews is not merely a system of forms&#44; 
though these are necessary to prove the existence of 
inward feeling&#59; but it is intended to work upon them 
in such a manner as to produce&#44; in the most extended 
sense of the words&#44; devoted worshippers&#44; good citi&#8211; 
zens&#44; and sincere philanthropists. One set of duties&#44; 
no matter how carefully practised&#44; absolves us not 
from the performance of the others&#59; but a perfect 
character can only be formed by a due observance of 
all the dictates of religion&#44; as we have said already. 

But let no one imagine&#44; that at this late day our 
religion has become obsolete or antiquated&#59; old it is&#44; 
few are its adherents&#59; but forgotten&#44; unpractised&#44; or 
useless it is not&#59; since there cannot be pointed out a 
single period from its promulgation to our own times&#44; 
when amidst all the delinquencies of Israel there were 
not some left who never did forsake the law&#59; and be&#8211; 
cause we see daily before our eyes that there exists 
in Judaism a recuperative or constantly reviving prin&#8211; 
ciple&#44; which seems always the most active in times of 
lukewarmness and apostasy. Let nq one then say 
that he need not obey&#44; because obedience is unfash&#8211; 
ionable. What is it to any oi us what the others do &#63; 
Are we to direct ourselves by the foolish conceits of 
the vain&#8211;glorious or unlearned&#44; or those who differ 
from us in their belief&#63; What concern of ours is it&#44;

that so many transgress&#63; We arc each answerable 
for ourselves&#44; that should not be forgotten &#59; we cannot 
seek shelter behind tlie faults of our neighbours&#59; and 
if sinning should unfortiinately become even more 
the fashion of the day than it now is&#44; still it would be 
justly expected from all of us&#44; from every son and 
daughter of Israel&#44; to avow boldly a firm belief in 
the law&#44; and to prove the activity of this belief by a 
strict adherence to the commandments. Therefore 
now&#44; beloved brethren&#33; be ye strong in the Lord&#59; have 
all one heart and one spirit&#44; and go hand in hand to&#8211; 
wards the perfection and oneness in the precepts of 
the Lord&#44; and become the devoted servants of the 
Most High&#44; whom He purposed to raise up unto him&#8211; 
self by the miraculous descent on the Mount Sinai&#44; 
to promulgate unto your fathers the law which the 
Lord designated for their government. Remember 
the sources from which you have sprung&#59; remember 
the sufferings of those who before you bore the name 
of Israel &#59; remember how tliey prized the holy word 
of their Maker&#44; and how they stretched forth their 
necks to the executioner&#39;s sword to sanctify the name 
of the Lord&#44; sooner than do aught which might re&#8211; 
semble a forsaking of the holy testimony which was 
theirs both by descent and adoption. Remember 
the many who forsook their native land to profess 
abroad their abhorred faith&#44; a faith doomed to de&#8211; 
struction by ruthless persecutors&#44; but which has so 
far survived and will continue to live to the end of 
days. Remember these facts&#44; and then too rellect&#44; 
that only through obedience can wo be happy. Re&#8211; 
flect that&#44; whenever we went astray&#44; the puuishnients 
deiiouuced against us were poured forth&#44; through the 

<pb n="27"/>

LIFE IN FAITH7 27 

agents of the Lord&#44; in his government of the world&#44; &#8212; 
the sword&#44; the pestilence&#44; the famine&#44; the storm&#44; and 
the fire. Reflect&#44; that never were we safe when sin 
had become universal&#44; and that fatal security was al&#8211; 
ways followed by the too sure coming affliction. Re&#8211; 
flect&#44; that twice was Jerusalem destroyed &#59; once be&#8211; 
cause of the idolatry which prevailed&#44; and once be&#8211; 
cause of the disunion in her streets&#44; and of the 
innocent blood which flowed freely&#44; even in the courts 
of the temple. Reflect&#44; that to&#8211;day you have entered 
into a new covenant&#44; as we may say&#44; to worship the 
Lord&#44; inasmuch as ye have appeared before Him to 
open the doors of this house for the admission of 
worshippers. Reflect&#44; that religion consists not mere&#8211; 
ly in words&#44; but more especially&#44; and in fact&#44; solely 
almost in a constant&#44; active&#44; striving after perfection. 
Reflect&#44; too&#44; that ye are sons of Lsrael&#44; scions of that 
ancient race who flourish best when the Lord is their 
acknowledged King&#44; and his law their rule of life. 
Reflect&#44; also&#44; that tiie Lord&#39;s hand is not shortened&#44; 
and that lie is able to punish now&#44; as He did always&#44; 
whenever we arc ripe for retribution. Reflect&#44; lastly&#44; 
how befltting to us is sincerity&#44; and that we can truly 
become a praise to the nations by contributing to the 
glorification of the name of God&#44; through an entire 
submission to his decrees&#59; which i&#58;mst prove that 
his spirit&#44; which was more than three thousand years 
ago poured out ovci&#8211; us&#44; is yet active and fresh&#44; in an 
unending state of youth&#44; to this very day. And know 
that&#44; if ye wish to be happy&#44; you must first deserve to 
be happy&#44; and that as IsraeUtes&#44; born under the law&#44; 
and bound by the law&#44; you cannot be happy without 
faith&#44; love&#44; and obedience.

And 80 also we rend in the first Book of Kings&#44; 
chap. ix. &#58; &#34; And it came to pass&#44; when Solonnon had 
finished tlie l&#41;uihling of the house of the Lord&#44; that 
the Lord appeared to Solomon the second time&#44; as 
He had appeared unto him at Gibeon. And the Lord 
said unto him&#44; I have heard thj prayer and thy sup&#8211; 
plication that thou hast made before me &#59; I have hal&#8211; 
lowed this house which thou hast built&#44; to put my 
name there for ever&#44; and my eyes and my heart shall 
be there perpetually. And if thou wilt walk before 
me&#44; as David thy father walked&#44; in integrity of heart 
and in uprightness&#44; to do according to all that I have 
commanded thee&#44; and keep my statutes and my ordi&#8211; 
nances&#58; then will I establish the throne of thy king&#8211; 
dom over Israel for ever&#44; as I promised to David thy 
father&#44; saying. There shall not fail thee a man upon 
the throne of Israel. But if ye shall at all turn from 
following me&#44; you and your children&#44; and will not 
keep my commandments and my statutes which I 
have set before you&#44; but go and serve other gods&#44; and 
worship them &#58; then will I cut off Israel out of the 
land which I have given them &#59; and this house&#44; which 
I have hallowed for my name&#44; will I east out of my 
sight&#44; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword 
among all people.&#34; And he continues&#58; &#34;And this 
house shall be desolate&#59; every one that passeth by it 
shall be astonished and shall hiss&#59; and they shall say&#44; 
&#34;Why hath the Lord done thus unto this land&#44; and to

We have seen how this prediction was literally ful&#8211; 
filled. &#8212; Whilst Israel obeyed&#44; the land llourished&#44; and 
the temple was the residence of the glory of God. 
But when Israel sinned&#44; the temple was put away

from the sight of God&#44; its walls were broken clown 
and its defences destroyed&#59; and the kingdom was 
snatched away from David&#39;s sons&#44; the land made al&#8211; 
most a desert&#44; and the people that dwelt there were 
scattered over all the earth. Nothing but disobedi&#8211; 
ence could have wrought so much destruction&#44; noth&#8211; 
ing but obedience could have averted the dreadful 
blow which was struck against Israel&#39;s greatness. 
And now&#44; in our wanderings over many distant lands&#44; 
we have left unto us the law only&#44; and in all our 
dwellings the unity of God is yet acknowledged &#59; and&#44; 
where permitted&#44; we have erected houses of prayer 
unto his adorable name. Do therefore now stand for&#8211; 
ward&#44; ye of the seed of Jacob &#33; assembled here this 
day&#44; and resolve&#44; firmly and truly&#44; to love the Lord 
your God with all your hearts and all your souls&#44; in 
order to merit the blessing pronounced upon them 
who fear the Everlasting One&#44; and to insure that 
upon these walls&#44; too&#44; the glory of God may dwell&#44; 
and that no sin of yours shall cause its destruction&#44; 
until that day when all Israel shall be assembled 
again together to worship the Lord of hosts on Mount 
Moriah&#44; the chosen residence of his name. And may 
you all&#44; wlio fear the Lord&#44; find strength in His will&#44; 
and may His blessing and His spirit guide you rightly 
and truly&#44; and shield you from evil and transgression 
now and for ever. Amen. 

And now&#44; O Lord&#44; our God &#33; we acknowledge that 
we have sinned and done wickedly&#44; and that for our 
transgressions&#44; and the transgressions of our fathers&#44; 
Jerusalem and thy people have been rendered a re&#8211; 
proach to all who surround us. But&#44; merciful Fa&#8211;

DISCOURSE III. 

PRESIDENT W. H. HARRISON.&#42; 

O Thou &#33; the great&#44; almighty&#44; and fearful God&#44; 
who art powerful to slay&#44; and omnipotent to bring 
unto life&#44; in whose hands are the bodies and souls of 
the living and the dead&#44; hear our supplication in thy 
high abode&#44; and give us strength and prosperity in 
all our doings &#59; be with us in our going out and our 
coming in&#59; prevent our feet from stumbling&#59; and 

&#42; General William Henry Harrison was installed President of 
the United States on March 4th&#44; 1841&#44; and died after brief illness in 
about a month from that date. The subjoined address was delivered 
on Sabbath the 5th day of Passover&#44; and is believed to have been 
the first spoken on the decease of the suddenly summoned chief 
magistrate of the land.

PRESIDENT AV. II. HARRISON. 31 

lead us not in the way of temptation&#44; but preserve 
us upright in the palli of obedience to thy command&#8211; 
ments&#44; in which there is life everlasting. And if we 
stray aside unto evil&#44; if we have tasted in om&#42; sinful&#8211; 
ness of worldly desires and enjoyments which are 
prohibited by thy law&#58; cause us speedily to feel the 
uuworthiness of our disobedience&#44; and lead us back 
to thy blessed fold from which we have strayed. 
And if our end has come as decreed by thy unerring 
judgment&#44; if no more days of transient life are ours &#58; 
then do Thou&#44; our Father &#33; take our spirit unto 
thy holy dwelling&#44; there to abide with Thee for ever&#44; 
even as Thou hast promised to thy servants who have 
been true and faithful. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

When Abner&#44; the son of ISTer&#44; fell by the sword of 
Joab&#44; the leader of David&#39;s amiy&#44; the Psalmist gave 
vent to his feelings in the following words addressed 
to his servants &#40;2 Sam. iii. 38&#41; &#58; 

&#34; Know yo not that a chief and a great man hath fallen this day 
in Israel&#63;&#34; 

In the same words may we now mourn over the 
afflicting and sudden bereavement which has just be&#8211; 
fallen this extensive land&#44; in the unexpected demise 
of its chosen chief magistrate&#44; the late President 
Harrison&#59; for well does it become us&#44; of the rem&#8211;

with the sorrows and regrets of our fellow&#8211;citizens

of other creeds concerning a loss wliich is no less 
ours than theirs&#59; since&#44; as the equals in the eyes of 
the law&#44; we had an equal share with tlieni in the 
illustrious deceased. And if we are bound by the 
religion we profess to i&#41;ray for the welfare of the city 
in which we dwell&#44; if even it be subject to a tyranni&#8211; 
cal ruler&#44; and if even we are oppressed there for our 
opinions&#44; and excluded from the free enjoyment of 
the rights of man &#58; how much more must we pray 
for the well&#8211;being of a land like this&#44; wdiich we may 
term our common country &#59; since we are not merely 
tolerated to worship after the dictates of our con&#8211; 
science&#44; not subject to the arbitrary good&#8211;will of a 
chief and his advisers&#44; but are here a part of the law&#8211; 
making power ourselves&#44; and have a share in the se&#8211; 
lection of the officers intrusted with the execution 
of the laws to which we have in a measure assented. 
&#8212; Not that there exists no prejudices in the minds 
of the majority&#44; of those who differ from us in re&#8211; 
ligious matters &#59; but this much we may freely assert&#44; 
that our living undisturbed depends not upon the 
whim of this majority &#59; for the violation of our rights&#44; 
to oppress us by laws uncongenial to universal equal&#8211; 
ity&#44; would soon lead to the entire overthrow of the 
liberty which&#44; under Providence&#44; the inhabitants of 
this land have achieved at the expense of so much 
labour&#44; so much wealth&#44; so much blood&#44; and so much 
suffering. Yes&#44; while the liberties of this land stand 
unimpaired&#59; while no religion&#44; as by law established&#44; 
becomes the dominant worship of the state &#59; while 
no test&#8211;oaths can be imposed before an incumbent 
enters upon office&#59; while no orders of nobility or 
other privileged classes are acknowledged by the

constitution and laws of the land&#58; so long will the 
Israelite&#44; despite of his separate religious views&#44; be 
11 part and parcel of the state&#44; and have a legitimate 
portion in the welfare of the community&#44; and a per&#8211; 
sonal interest in those wliom the popular voice calls 
to the councils of the nation&#44; and selects as the ad&#8211; 
ministrators of the laws. We then say truly that in 
President Harrison&#39;s death a chief and a great man 
has fallen&#44; not only to gentile opinions&#44; in which he 
was born and educated&#44; but also to the opinions of 
the children of Jacob who worship in this house the 
God of their forefathers. 

The name of the late President is so intimately 
connected with the history of his country&#44; that to 
many it may seem superfluous to dwell upon the in&#8211; 
cidents of his life&#59; especially as his decease has been 
too recent to allow an impartial estimate to be formed 
of his actions and opinions &#59; the more so since by his 
elevation to the chief magistracy after a long&#44; ardent&#44; 
and a well&#8211;contested struggle&#44; the dominion of a party 
has been overthrowai who for many years have held 
the ascendency in the councils and government of 
the nation. Nevertheless&#44; it seems a fitting occasion 
to take a rapid view of the services which were ren&#8211; 
dered by General Harrison&#44; and to show that our text 
is not misapplied to him. 

The war wdiich established the independence of 
this commonwealth was over&#44; and the constitution&#44; 
under which it is now governed&#44; had been promul&#8211; 
gated&#44; and the first&#44; the greatest of its children&#44; had 
been selected to preside over the administration of 
its affairs &#58; when the sound of fierce alarm called 
airain its sons into the field. It was not then the

34 PRESIDENT W. II. HARRISON. 

assault of the warlike sons of ancient Britain &#59; not 
the children of gallant France from whom clanger 
was threatened to the extensive frontiers of this 
Union&#59; it was not foul treason which had reared 
her bloody pennon in populous cities or remote dis&#8211; 
tricts&#59; but it was the war&#8211;yell of the fierce&#44; untamable 
sons of the forest&#44; who slaughtered without mercy the 
armed man and the defenceless woman &#59; who spared 
not&#44; in their murderous lust&#44; the aged sire and the 
timid maiden&#44; and who were strangers to mercy&#44; and 
unmoved by the innocent smiles of helpless infancy. 
The chivalrous spirit of youth was aroused&#44; and round 
their country&#39;s standard flocked manj&#8211; to brave the 
rifle and the seal ping&#8211;knife of the wily savage&#59; and 
among them came a young man&#44; who had left his 
peaceful studies to sliare the dangers and hardships 
of the tented field&#44; though the distinguished name 
which his father bore might have opened to him 
avenues of preferment in the calmer walks of life. 
lie soon attracted to himself the attention of the 
most daring chief of the American revolution&#44; and 
was speedily promoted to higher rank&#44; the just re&#8211; 
ward for a devotedness to duty and fearlessness 
under trials. And fields which smile under the in&#8211; 
dustry of the active husbandman &#59; mountains Avhich 
are now securely traversed by the solitary traveller&#44; 
over which flies&#44; with then unthought of speed&#44; the 
car impelled by the power of steam&#59; spots where at 
this day are found cities which teem with crowded 
populations&#44; and are the scat of refinement and ele&#8211; 
gance &#59; rivers which then flowed amidst prinieval

the tread of the timid fown&#44; tlic stately buck&#44; tlie 
prowling wolf&#44; the fierce bear&#44; or the wary fox&#59; soli&#8211; 
tudes&#44; vocal only to the rush of the eagle&#39;s flight&#44; or 
the scream of the vulture&#44; or the croaking of the ra&#8211; 
ven&#44; or the night bird&#39;s howl&#44; or the hissing of the 
poisonous serpent in pursuit of prey &#58; were in those 
days won by the prowess of the civilized Caucasian 
race from the indigenous inhabitants of the land&#44; more 
savage than the beast of their forests&#44; and as unculti&#8211; 
vated as the soil on which they trod. And these turned 
their backs upon the rising sun&#44; seeking a home in 
the distant West&#44; yet pursued&#44; as they travelled on&#44; 
by the wild bee&#44; the forerunner of the white man&#44; 
and quickly followed by the hardy pioneer&#44; who gains 
his bread in the distant wilds &#59; and thus they have 
been driven from station to station&#44; until the mighty 
Andes .are scarcely a limit to their wanderings&#44; and 
protect them from the devouring contact with the 
vices of civilized life. Extermination and an utter 
obliterating almost have thus been the fate of many 
tribes of the once powerful owners of this land&#44; for 
whom we cannot avoid feeling pity&#44; though they have 
often been stained with the blood of many innocent 
victims&#59; knowing&#44; as we do&#44; that their untutored 
mind was not rarely goaded on to madness by the 
bad faith and rapacity of their more lettered&#44; but fre&#8211; 
quently dishonest neighbours&#44; who came at times&#44; 
first&#44; to seek a refuge and shelter in the to them 
hospitable forest&#44; and then aimed ere long to dispos&#8211; 
sess their kind red friends of the graves of their fore&#8211; 
fathers. But these yielded not without a terrible re&#8211; 
sistance&#44; and many a glade was reddened by the blood 
of mortal foes&#44; of rival races struggling for the su&#8211;

premacy&#59; and amidst such scones the youth wc spoke 
of distino&#59;uished liimsclf&#44; escaping with life where 
deatli enfolded many in his cold em&#8211;brace&#44; and he 
was thus spared to become the chief and the great 
man who has so lately fallen. 

The war was ended&#44; and the yonng soldier resigned 
the sword which hud not been ingloriously drawn&#59; 
and honoured by the wise man who then governed 
the state&#44; he received a more peaceful appointment 
in the newly&#8211;conquered territory. Anon he rose to 
the chief rule of the land for which he had fought&#44; 
and acquired by his prudence and fiiithfulness the af&#8211; 
fection of the grateful inhabitants. And when the 
newly&#8211;awakened demon of war again roCised the sav&#8211; 
ages to strife and slaughter&#44; he led the armies of his 
country to the onset&#44; and overthrew the dangerous foe. 
And when&#44; soon after&#44; the island&#8211;king was declared 
the enemy of these States&#44; the time&#8211;honoured soldier 
did not seek repose from danger&#59; but he marched 
where the contest raged fierce and hot&#58; the leaguer&#44; 
and camp&#44; and battle&#8211;field tell truly where fought and 
directed the hero who since then became the great 
man for whom the nation now mourns. 

Peace again shed her blessings over city and field&#44; 
and the men of war sheathed their swords&#44; and re&#8211; 
turned to the bosom of their own beloved household. 
No longer was heard the roar of the dread artillery&#44; 
and the mariners again spread their sails to seek the 
pursuits of commerce in far&#8211;off oceans&#44; and they&#44; who 
had lately mixed only in the fierce encounter&#44; again 
grasped each other&#39;s hand in friendship and union &#59; 
and he&#44; who had so lately wielded the weapon of de&#8211; 
struction&#44; was sent on to the metropolis in the peace&#8211;

fnl jriiise of the representative of the people&#44; to share 
ill the deliberation of measures best calculated to per&#8211; 
petuate the liberties and rights which had been dearly 
purchased and gloriously luaintained. There we find 
him for many years pursuing the even tenor of his way&#44; 
uncorrupted and honest in the discharge of his duties &#59; 
and when he was at length raised to take his seat among 
the assembly of the ancients who are appointed to 
mature what their coadjutors have perhaps rashly pro&#8211; 
posed&#44; the same integrity of purpose was manifested 
by the patriot&#59; and if even all his acts in the capacity 
of legislator may not meet with universal approba&#8211; 
tion&#44; no one will deny him the just claim of having 
followed the dictates of a conscience never burdened 
with the charge of having promoted his private ends 
to the injury of his public trusts. And he deserves 
therefore the title of a great and good man&#44; who mer&#8211; 
its the regrets of his grateful countrymen. 

Roused by the oppression of ancient Spain&#44; and fired 
by the example set them in this republic&#44; the people 
of the southern portion of this continent resolved to 
be free&#59; and nobly they strained every nerve&#44; and 
finally succeeded &#40;so willed Providence&#41;&#44; in casting 
out the legions of the parent state&#44; a country which 
is loaded with guilt&#44; and rapine&#44; and slaughter&#44; from 
every part of this hemisphere &#59; and they thus estab&#8211; 
lished themselves as independent communities. The 
prominence which was attached to General Harrison 
caused the then President&#44; Adams&#44; to send him am&#8211; 
bassador to the Republic of Colombia&#44; over which 
was then placed that remarkable man &#8212; remarkable 
and great despite of his faults &#8212; the Liberator&#44; Simon 
Bolivar. Party considerations induced Mr. Adams&#39;s

successor to recall the patriot soldier before he had 
an opportunity of effecting much in the furtherance 
of his mission&#59; and having thus returned to his na&#8211; 
tive land&#44; he settled down in retirement near the 
scenes of his early achievements&#44; where in a few years 
had sprung up a city second to few in commerce and 
enterprise. And here the man who had been a general&#44; 
governor&#44; representative&#44; senator&#44; and ambassador&#44; 
and who had received the thanks of Congress for his 
bravery and skill&#44; did not disdain to resort to a com&#8211; 
paratively humble calling to acquire an honourable 
competency in his old age&#44; by taking a respectable 
though subordinate station in one of the courts of 
law near his domicil&#44; where he lived in liberal&#44; though 
unostentatious hospitality. Many anecdotes are re&#8211; 
lated of his goodness of heart&#44; and the frank openness 
of his maimers &#59; it is needless&#44; however&#44; to dwell upon 
them now&#44; especially as no doubt those who knew him 
well will before long present them to the public in an 
authentic shape &#59; enough for our purpose that a large 
portion of his countrymen&#44; believing the measures 
pursued by the executive of the Union injurious to 
the general welfare&#44; singled him out as the person 
who could remedy the defects which they deplored. 
The first attempt&#44; owing doubtless to the want of 
proper harmony and union&#44; failed&#44; and his rival was 
elevated to the highest dignity under the laws&#44; and 
he had thus to yield for a time to a man who&#44; what&#8211; 
ever the light be in which difference of party may 
view him&#44; is yet deserving of the especial gratitude 
of all Jews for the active part he took upon a recent 
occasion to have justice extended to the oppresssed 
sons of Israel in the Ottoman dominions. But not

PRESIDENT W. H. HARRISON. 39 

disheartened by the first failure&#44; General Harrison 
was again nominated for the presidency &#59; and within 
a few months past the free and nnbonglit suffrage of 
a free and independent people declared him by a tri&#8211; 
umphant vote to be the man called to administer the 
government for the space of four years&#44; the longest 
term which the laws allow at one election. I need 
not tell you how his success was hailed as the guar&#8211; 
antee of better times and returning prosperity &#59; nor 
is it requisite to call your attention to the astonishing 
fact&#44; how the party so long in power&#44; and who con&#8211; 
tended so violently for the victory&#44; quietly submitted 
to the popular will&#44; as soon as it was ascertained that 
a majority had decreed a change of rulers&#59; thus evi&#8211; 
dencing that the greatest liberty&#44; even amounting to 
a revolutionizing of the whole system of government 
in many essential particulars&#44; can be and is compati&#8211; 
ble with the utmost security&#44; and can be and is ef&#8211; 
fected without bloodshed and a disruption of the civil 
compact. 

But we must hasten to the final scene. The newly 
elected President travelled from his distant home to 
assume the reins of government&#44; and his progress 
equalled&#44; nay surpassed&#44; the triumphal procession of 
a mighty conqueror &#59; and wherever he appeared 
crowds flocked to greet him and to do honour to the 
man whom their own choice had raised. And it is 
but one brief month since he appeared&#44; according to 
the laws of the land&#44; before its representatives and 
chief judge&#44; in the presence of assembled thousands 
to swear true allegiance and faithfulness in the execu&#8211; 
tion of the high trust reposed in him &#59; and the multi&#8211; 
tude shouted &#8212; the cannon&#39;s roar loudly yet peacefully

announced the event &#8212; the flags of the stripes and 
stars were gaily thrown out to the breeze &#8212; and mil&#8211; 
lions anxiously watched for the message from the an&#8211; 
cient patriot that was to announce to them the meas&#8211; 
ures he meant to pursue. Yes&#44; there were throngs 
in the streets of the capital city &#59; there were crowds 
on the roads of persons vainly eager to hasten on&#8211; 
ward to behold the exciting spectacle&#59; there were 
many anxious to know whether in the distribution of 
public favours their claims would be regarded&#44; and 
there were many others intent only to behold their 
country&#39;s favoured and illustrious son. &#8212; And ho&#44; the 
object of all this excitement&#44; seemed to feel himself 
but little elated&#44; and continued to exhibit the same 
frankness and kind urbanity which had characterized 
him in a private station. Those who had hoped much 
from his elevation hailed with joy the summons he ex&#8211; 
tended to the councillors of the people to meet him 
in two months&#39; time to deliberate over the national 
welfare. But scarce had as many weeks elapsed when 
intelligence of his illness was wafted over the land&#44; 
and a few days more rolled on when&#44; after deceptive 
appearances of amendment in his disorder had been 
announced&#44; the melancholy and startling tidings were 
scattered abroad that the President of these States 
liad been summoned away to a bettor world&#44; and that 
the heart which so lately throbbed with thoughts of 
high resolve had ceased to beat&#44; and that the spirit 
which had animated and prompted him to noble ac&#8211; 
tions had taken its flight to the God who gave it. 
And now the land is tilled with sorrow and regret&#44; 
and the cannon booms in solemn sounds of woe&#44; and 
the flags are hung out enshrouded with signs of

silent spectators&#44; and hushed is tlie tuniidt of assem&#8211; 
bled thousands&#44; who meet to honour truly by their 
silence the departed chief who now sleeps undisturbed 
by passions and anxious care. And in the distant 
home sits perhaps alone the beloved wife&#44; anxiously 
awaiting the summons of her lord to share with him 
the splendour of the national pahico&#59; but this sum&#8211; 
mons comes not&#44; for he&#44; whom she loved&#44; is no more&#44; 
and in the place of joyful tidings the messenger of 
evil must needs reveal to her the truth tliat afflicts 
so many &#59; and may the great Creator in his mercy 
inspire her with fortitude to bear with humble resig&#8211; 
nation the blow which has been struck against her 
peace&#44; and may she receive consolation as was given 
always to those who trusted in the Lord and confided 
in his goodness. And may the deceased meet the 
reward destined unto virtue&#44; and may his soul re&#8211; 
pose in peace amid the righteous of Israel&#44; who en&#8211; 
joy the happiness which the Lord has destined for 
those who place in Him their hopes of salvation. 
&#8212; And we are justified in believing that the man&#44; 
who in the moment of his elevation forgot not his 
Creator&#44; but endeavoured to serve Ilim &#40;as report 
says&#41; after the manner which he had been early 
taught was the accepted mode of worship&#44; though 
this is not the truth which is the portion of Jacob&#39;s 
congregation&#44; will have been received ere our prayers 
ascend for him this day in the favour and the presence 
of the Lord of life&#44; and that his sins have been for&#8211;

the far iiortli and where it borders upon Britain&#39;s 
wide domain&#44; to where a southern sky sheds a briglit 
warmth over a soil laden with tropical products&#44; for 
the venerable departed who in his last moments and 
by his last words testified his anxiety for the land he 
had been called on to rule over &#59; since no matter what 
may have been shades of difference in opinion enter&#8211; 
tained concerning him and his proposed measures&#44; 
none will now deny him an honesty of purpose and a 
purity of heart&#44; and all will join in the words of our 
text&#44; &#34; Know ye not that a chief and a great man hath 
fallen this day in Israel.&#34; 

In the brief sketch we have just furnished of the 
life and services of General Harrison&#44; it will be per&#8211; 
ceived that he passed through every stage of promo&#8211; 
tion&#44; and that he rose from an humble standard&#8211;bearer 
to the chief command of the army and navy&#44; and the 
presidency of the councils of his native land &#59; and he 
thus reached a station as high as human ambition can 
look for&#59; because the voluntary suffrage of a free peo&#8211; 
ple raising one of their own fellow&#8211;citizens to the high&#8211; 
est honour within their gift&#44; is a far more enviable dis&#8211; 
tinction than a throne inherited by a stripling from 
a royal ancestry&#44; or acquired through violence by an

a lesson that virtue and moderation&#44; joined to a 
straightforward line of conduct&#44; are well calculated 
and will pre&#8211;eminently conduce to acquire for us the 
favour of God and man&#44; and thereby secure to us the 
desires even of a worldly ambition to a far greater 
extent than trick and cunning on the one&#44; or violence&#44;

cess may be obtained&#44; still such success will fail to 
produce inward peace&#44; and to secure the love and 
good&#8211;will of the wise and virtuous. 

But another lesson&#44; and one not less impressive&#44; is 
derived from the briefness of the period in which the 
late President enjoyed his high rank&#44; and the sudden&#8211; 
iress of his removal hy the hand of death. The shout 
that accompanied his accession to power yet rever&#8211; 
berates through the land&#44; when the air is loaded with 
the sound of wailing over his unexpected decease. 
And whilst the words of flattery which the crowd al&#8211; 
ways offer at the foot of power have not yet died away&#44; 
his ears have become deaf to the clang of trumpets &#59; 
to the measured tramp of the war&#8211;steed&#59; to the rattle 
of the muffled drum &#59; the tolling of the funeral bell &#59; 
and the firing of the artillery&#44; which accompany him 
to the home destined for all the living. In the pre&#8211; 
rogative invested in him by the laws of the land&#44; he 
summons round him the councillors and the elders 
of the nation&#59; but ere the command has reached them&#44; 
he who bid them come can feel no more the cares of 
state&#44; and is borne away to the tomb&#44; and over him 
is piled the dust from which his body sprung&#59; and he 
must leave to another hand the task of carrying out 
the work which he would gladly have executed him&#8211; 
self&#44; had life and health been given. 

Say&#44; mortal &#33; dost thou not feel rebuked at the state 
of uncertainty which thus is proven to hang around 
all thy steps&#63; Thou plannest&#44; thou ordainest&#44; thou 
biddest&#44; art chafed if aught displease thee&#44; if aught 
contradict thee&#59; but seest thou not how soon all thy 
mighty resolves may be arrested&#44; and all thy toiling 
rendered as naught &#63; And yet thou clingest to earth

as though thy ahiding&#8211;place were here for ever &#33; Thou 
vainest not the life everlasting and its joys&#44; its pleas&#8211; 
ures and its holiness. Thou numberest those hours 
as bright in which thou hast laboured to elevate thy&#8211; 
self above thy fellows&#44; and thinkest those minutes lost 
in which thou heldest communion with thy Creator&#44; 
and didst learn to humble thyself&#44; as becomes the 
weak and sinful worm before Ilim who is holy&#44; pure&#44; 
and great. Alas &#33; alas &#33; that this should be our striv&#8211; 
ing&#44; that thus we suffer our days to pass in vain de&#8211; 
sires&#44; and in actions by which we are more closely 
drawn to a perishable world&#44; forgetful of the end that 
must come much sooner than we anticipate. But 
would it not be wise&#44; brethren&#44; so to act as though 
every day were our last &#63; to number our days by the 
happiness of the inward spirit which delights only 
in virtue&#44; in truth&#44; injustice&#44; in the love of the great 
Supreme&#63; Surely far more enviable is the man who 
is rich in these&#44; and far happier must he be than the 
man who builds his house in iniquity&#44; and fills his 
coffers by acts of injustice. Yet&#44; we envy not the 
righteous man for his righteousness&#44; nor the humble 
in religious hope for the serenity of his mind&#59; and 
why&#63; because we know not thoroughly&#44; because we 
wish not to feel in truth the happiness of religious 
wealth&#44; and the enduriugness of spiritual hopes. 
Could we but be made alive to them&#44; how speedily 
would we hasten to make ourselves worthy of their 
attainment&#59; how soon would we purchase them in 
preference to the merchandise of silver or the fra&#8211; 
grance of precious oils. But let us be wise&#59; let us

DISCOURSE IV. 

JUSTICE&#44; TRUTH&#44; AND PEACE.&#42; 

O Lord our God &#33; whose name is powerful over all 
the earth &#33; we have entered thy house overwhelmed 
by a sense of thy unending greatness&#44; and humbled 
by a feeling of our entire dependence on thy will. 
It was but lately that the inhabitants of this land 
called one from among them to go out and to come 
in before their armies&#44; and to make his voice heard 
in their councils. They looked with satisfaction upon 
the work they had accomplished&#44; and perhaps wor&#8211; 
shipped the creature more than thy majesty&#44; imagin&#8211; 
ing that human aid should help them. But lo&#33; thy 
command went forth&#44; and him they had chosen Thou 
willedst to take from among the living&#44; whilst but 
one change of the moon had passed over his great&#8211; 
ness. And then thy angel sped forth&#44; and brought 
his spirit before thy throne&#44; to be judged of Thee&#44; 
the great and Almighty Ruler and Judge&#44; who re&#8211; 
gardest alike the exalted&#44; and those who are cast 
down even to the dunghill. And how many who per&#8211; 
advcnture never thought that thy providence rules 
the nations&#44; have acknowledged thy power&#44; and they 
come to humble themselves in spirit&#44; and to crave 

&#42; This address was&#42; delivered on the day of public fasting and 
humiliation&#44; proclaimed by President John Tyler in consequence 
of the decease of his predecessor.

thy blessed protection. O &#33; do Thou teach all such 
and those who ere this walked before Thee&#44; to feel 
that they are entirely depending on Thee&#44; and that 
without thy aid their life must be vanity&#44; their days 
as nothing&#44; and their strivings of no avail. Fill them 
thus with humility&#44; that they may subdue the evil of 
their hearts&#44; and learn to be like Thee&#44; just and mer&#8211; 
ciful&#44; regardful alike of the claims their fellow&#8211;men 
have on their justice and bounty&#44; and forgiving to 
those who have offended them. And O may it be 
thy will&#44; that the afflictive event&#44; which Thou didst 
cause to happen&#44; may have a permanent effect upon 
us all&#44; and induce us to learn obedience betimes&#44; while 
life and health are yet ours by thy dispensation &#59; so 
that&#44; when the hour of our separation from earth does 
arrive&#44; we may be able to meet Thee joyfully as our ap&#8211; 
proving Father&#44; and our benignant Judge&#44; while Thou 
wilt receive us into thy paternal embrace. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

The acting President of the republic&#44; in view of the 
unexpected demise of the late chief magistrate&#44; recog&#8211; 
nizing in this event the finger of Providence&#44; has re&#8211; 
quested the people all over the country to observe 
this day&#44; each persuasion after their own manner&#44; as 
a day of fasting&#44; prayer&#44; and humiliation. It is in ac&#8211; 
cordance with this recommendation&#44; that we have 
also repaired to the house of God&#44; to mingle with the 
other citizens in the well&#8211;timed exercise of pious rites. 
I say well&#8211;timed &#59; for is not an occasion like the one 
which we have just witnessed&#44; and which has sum&#8211; 
moned us hither&#44; well calculated to fix our attention 
on the greatness of God&#44; and to point out to us em&#8211;

phatically&#44; our own insignificance &#63; It was but lately&#44; 
that millions of men Avilled to select one of their 
number to be their chief&#59; but the Lord willed that 
the mighty man and the counsellor should strive on 
earth no longer&#44; and now he sleeps the sleep of death&#44; 
and another is left the heir of all his honours and 
power. What availed it to the deceased that he had 
been called from his peaceful home to assume the 
cares of state&#44; what advantage was it that so many 
looked up to him with hope and confidence&#44; what 
mattered it that so many&#44; skilful in tlie healing art&#44; 
watched around his bedside &#63; the angel of death had 
been sent on his mission&#44; and he returned not till his 
errand had been fulfilled&#44; and till all the anxiety&#44; care&#44; 
hope and labour had been exhausted in vain. Thus 
the striviuij of man and his confidence in his own 
power have been again proved before our eyes to be 
unavailing&#44; when contending with the Lord of life&#44; 
whose we are and to whom we must render an account 
of our deeds. Where then should we&#44; frail and mor&#8211; 
tal&#44; look for support&#63; where should we place our 
trust &#63; Shall it be in those who have power &#63; wealth &#63; 
Avisdom &#63; renown &#63; Shall we cling to power &#63; to riches &#63; 
to worldly wisdom&#63; to fame&#63; Shall we pursue the 
course of conduct which selfishness dictates&#44; smile 
when cities blaze&#44; shut our eyes to the sight of suf&#8211; 
fering&#44; turn a deaf ear to the appeals of the distressed&#44; 
and steel our hearts to the dictates of justice&#63; In 
short&#44; shall we trust in human means&#44; pursue worldly 
things&#44; and live only for ourselves &#63; no &#33; this would 
not be wise &#59; we thus should not profit in the least by 
the admonition of Providence so recently vouchsafed 
to us &#59; and the wound which has been struck would

not conduce toward the healing of the Ri&#41;irit&#44; of which 
we all stand so much in need. No&#44; brethren&#33; it is 
vain to rely on man&#44; even the most powerful and the 
wisest&#44; for all are alike mortal&#44; and unable to assist 
us&#8211; in the hour of dissolution&#59; since no human power 
and wisdom can afford us help beyond the grave. 
But upon Him who is everlasting&#44; whose power is 
not limited by time and space&#44; whose wisdom is un&#8211; 
clouded by human frailties and ignorance of ultimate 
results&#44; we should cast our hopes&#44; our trnst&#44; and if 
we rely on Ilim&#44; we shall then be truly sheltered&#44; yes 
sheltered and eecui&#8211;e even when death is near. And 
thou&#44; suffering brother&#33; who art oppressed by the 
powerful and proud&#44; whose head is bowed before 
those who fear not the Creator&#44; who art banished 
from thy home an exile and outcast on the wide world 
by the action of those who feel no pity&#44; think not 
that there is none to help thee&#59; man may frown&#44; but 
there is One who nevertheless can assist thee&#59; only 
be firm and of good courage&#44; and doubt not of the 
o&#8211;oodness of God&#44; because thou art for a time com&#8211; 
pelled to suffer wrong and contumely &#59; but cheered 
by the conociousness that thy God&#44; who will not mete 
out to thee greater trials than thou canst bear&#44; does 
watch over thee and number all thy steps&#44; persevere 
in the path of righteousness which thou hast hitherto 
pursued. And if even thy sufferings should not be re&#8211; 
moved&#44; and want and penury be thy portion&#44; thou wilt 
have within thee a light which will illumine the dark&#8211; 
ness of the spirit&#44; and banish the corroding thought 
of utter forsakenness which the unkind deeds of mor&#8211; 
tals may have aroused within thy bosom &#59; for thou 
wilt then know that thy Redeemer liveth&#44; and that

lie will smile approvingly upon the soul of the un&#8211; 
swerving servant&#44; when thy l&#41;0&#40;lj has l&#41;een surren&#8211; 
dered to corruption. 

Yes&#44; truly this is the portion of the righteous&#44; who 
though they suffer&#44; though men are their enemies&#44; 
have the consciousness that the great God is their 
friend&#44; who will not permit them to endure more 
than is conducive to their improvement&#44; and which 
is beyond their means of bearing. And their sorrows 
which dim not the light of their virtue will he a holy 
example to others around them&#44; and will tell more 
loudly than Avords&#44; that they who trust in God are 
Avell secured&#44; and that tribulations Avhen borne with 
meekness are truly the way of life and everlasting 
happiness. 

And those who are powerful and wise themselves&#44; 
the rich and renowned&#44; have not they a right to boast 
of their possessions&#44; and to look with something like 
pride upon those less favoured&#63; shall they not have 
some cause to regard themselves as born to command&#63; 
Alas&#33; how vain are these advantages&#59; but a brief 
period will elapse when power will vanisli&#59; nay&#44; if it 
even abide with a man till the day of his death&#44; as 
was the case with the late President &#58; yet how soon 
will this day arrive&#44; hov&#63; soon will the body&#44; bereft 
of soul&#44; return to inert clay. And who will then do 
homage to the mouldering dust&#63; who will fear the 
frowns of the quenched eye&#44; or dread the sound of 
the tongue tliat is now hushed&#44; and Avisli to influence 
by flattei&#8211;y the heart that now beats no more &#63; Even 
let us suppose that a mighty nation should weej&#41; for 
a fallen chief&#44; that millions should mourn because the

hands&#58; what does that avail the body which is insen&#8211; 
sible alike to praise or blame&#63; &#8212; And yet man shall 
trust in the delegated authority whicli is his for a 
brief space&#63; forget his Creator&#44; because he can for a 
time bear rule over others&#63; despise his fellow&#8211;crea&#8211; 
tures who arc humble&#63; forget in liis exaltation the 
end that to him too is fast approaching &#63; vanity of 
vanities&#33; for inglorious indeed will be that end&#44; un&#8211; 
blessed that memory where the possessor of power 
valued himself because he had attained it&#44; and loved 
his species less&#44; because he was raised on high&#44; or wor&#8211; 
shipped not his Maker with due fervour&#44; because 
other men were subject to his rule. 

The wise man thinks perchance that he is of more 
consequence than the rest of mankind&#44; and that he 
sliould be exempt from the fate of humanity&#44; labour 
and mutual dependence on others. But is this just&#63; 
how any knowledge we possess raise us above the level 
of mankind&#63; Go then&#44; vain boaster&#44; who despisest 
thy neighbour because thou art wise &#58; &#8212; who gave thee 
wisdom&#63; who filled thy tongue with eloquence&#63; was 
it not thy Creator&#63; and why was this wisdom given &#63; 
was it not that thon mightest be an instructor to 
others&#44; a guide to those less favoured than thyself&#63; 
But what at last is thy wisdom&#63; thou standest but 
on the shore of the great ocean of knowledge and 
truth&#44; a pebble perchance&#44; picked up amidst the 
mountains of sand against which the waters dash&#44; 
may fall to thy share&#44; whilst the depth profound&#44; the

happiness wei&#8211;e ho to consecrate his sword to Heaven&#44; 
and never draw it but in a just cause&#44; and look upon 
the Arbiter of nations as the Power to whom he too 
is accountable&#63; O then will the warrior&#39;s laurels be 
green for ever&#44; and at his decetise ministering angels 
will wreathe around his brow garlands of virtuous 
deeds which will never fade&#44; which will bloom not

humanity&#63; while we oppress those over whom we 
have power&#63; while we aim to establish our own will 
regardless of the just remonstrances of others&#63; while 
we stand unmoved at the calls of justice&#44; simply be&#8211; 
cause we will not forego an opinion once formed&#44; no 
matter if the cruelty of our resolve be ever so appa&#8211; 
rent &#63; O no &#33; this is not the way of life &#59; tiiis is not 
the path of salvation. But listen&#44; brethren &#33; to the 
voice of God as made known through his messenger&#58; 


&#34; Those are the things that ye shall do&#44; Speak ye every man the 
truth to his neighbour&#44; the truth and judgement of peace judge ye 
in your gates &#59; and let none of you imagine evil in your heart 
against his neighbour&#44; and love no false oath&#59; for all these are 
things that I hate&#44; paith the Lord.&#34; Zechariah viii. IG&#44; 17. 

In this emphatic passage we have an indication 
of what is the will of God in regard of the conduct 

<pb n="57"/>

JUSTICE&#44; TRUTH&#44; AND PEACE. 57 

from man to man. The first is&#44; we are ordered to 
speak the strictest truth to one another. There is a 
great fault&#44; not rare among many&#44; to speak as much 
truth only as suits their purpose and to conceal what&#8211; 
ever might be hurtful to their interest. Many evils 
actually result from such a course. The confiding 
and generous are very frequently misled by this half&#8211; 
way truth &#59; they believe themselves in the possession 
of facts upon which to act &#59; they do not imagine that 
their friends would mislead them &#58; when lo &#33; in the 
hour of trial&#44; they find that they were deceived&#44; not 
by what their timid friends had told&#44; but by what 
they had carefully concealed. But such truth is not 
speaking the truth&#44; it is deception under the guise of 
truth. Therefore&#44; says the prophet&#58; &#34;Speak ye 
every man the truth to his neighbour&#59;&#34; in this im&#8211; 
portant matter let it be as with neighbourly love&#44; not 
to do that to another which would be disagreeable to 
yourselves. Now imagine for once that your neigh&#8211; 
bour were to serve you so meanly as to conceal in 
his communication an important part of the matter 
which to know is of vital imi&#41;ortance to you. What 
would you think of his baseness &#63; yet even as you 
expect of him&#44; act on your part&#44; speak the truth 
plainly&#44; fearlessly&#44; and without disguise&#44; so that your 
neighbour may not be misled by the information 
which you impart to him. 

Then continues the prophet &#58; &#34; The truth and the 
judgment of peace judge ye in your gates.&#34; You 
no doubt know that the word &#34;gates&#34; in Scriptures 
is equivalent to our term &#34;courts of justice&#44;&#34; since 
in the days of oin&#8211; commonwealth the gates&#44; the 
places of the greatest resort&#44; were the spots selected

58 JUSTICE&#44; TRUTH&#44; AND PEACE. 

for the assemblies of the people and elders. So then 
the judges&#44; or all those whose province it may be to 
sit in judgment&#44; arc admonished to judge first &#34;the 
truth&#44;&#34; and secondly &#34; the judgment of peace.&#34; When 
a case&#44; no matter what its character&#44; comes before 
you&#44; it is your solemn obligation to search well your 
heart&#44; whether deceit be not lurking there under tb.&#34;&#34; 
mask of inexorable justice. Dwell with care upon 
the issue before you&#44; and see that the cause of truth 
be truly served by your honest verdict made up by 
the removal of prejudice to the utmost extent in your 
power. And in deciding&#44; it is also requisite that you 
should turn a deaf ear to the special pleading of art&#8211; 
ful mystifiers who&#44; by the plausible show of words&#44; 
may cast the truth in the shade&#44; and exhibit the in&#8211; 
nocent in the light of an otiender&#59; but do not act in 
this way&#44; judge truth&#44; the truth only&#44; stripped of all 
web of ingenious sophistry&#44; in candour and sincerity&#44; 
even as you hope in your dying hour to receive mercy 
and truth from your Maker. Yet not alone truth 
should be your guide&#44; but peace likewise. O blessed 
peace &#33; which in countries and communities&#44; and large 
cities&#44; and single households&#44; art the harbinger of hap&#8211; 
piness and content &#33; come thou down from heaven&#44; 
from the presence of the Lord of peace&#44; and dwell in 
the midst of us&#44; to restore harmony where there is 
contention&#44; and spread contentment where thou al&#8211; 
ready dwellest. &#8212; Yes&#44; brethren &#33; &#41;each is this beauti&#8211; 
fying principle which is to govern you in&#44; your deci&#8211; 
sions upon all occasions and at all times&#59; always lean 
to the side of amity and brotherly love&#59; and sooner 
than let strife go to the extremity of power&#44; and 
justice be done to the injury of many&#44; let compromise

of good&#8211;will be thrown into the scales&#44; so that both 
parties be left to dwell together in peace&#44; sooner than 
the one should needlessly triumph in an absohitc con&#8211; 
quest&#44; and the other&#39;s mind rankle under the idea of 
suffering from too harsh a decision&#44; though this deci&#8211; 
sion be strictly just.&#8212; Let it be your study through 
life to lean on the side of mercy &#59; for this&#44; when well&#8211; 
timed&#44; will heal wounds&#44; and bring harmony&#44; where 
otherwise discord might break asunder the bonds of 
friendship whicU formerly seemed to unite men&#44; as 
though it were one spirit that dwelt in different l&#41;odies. 
We are farther told&#44; &#34; That we are not to imagine 
evil in our h&#40;&#42;arts against our neighbour.&#34; TIow re&#8211; 
quisite is this injunction &#33; how much happiei&#8211; world 
Ave all be&#44; were we to abide by this holy advice pro&#8211; 
ceeding from the highest Source of Wisdom. What 
do we not impute to our neighbour&#63; An act of the 
most trifling kind&#44; a word spoken hastily&#44; an expres&#8211; 
sion not clearly understood dropped in the heat of ar&#8211; 
gument&#44; are seized upon by malevolence and tortured 
into grave offences&#59; and then witness the means used 
to execute vengeance upon the unhappy culprit&#44; espe&#8211; 
cially if the offender be one on whom we can freely 
wreak our ill&#8211;will. But how much would human hap&#8211; 
piness be promoted&#44; were we to look upon the favour&#8211; 
able side of every question. Suppose I am offended 
at a remark made by any one of my neighbours&#44; and 
grant that I am not mistaken in my information&#58; is 
it not possible that I may have given the first cause 
for offence &#63; that my pride&#44; my own inconsiderate folly 
may have provoked the injury &#63; Surely&#44; humanity is 
so liable to err&#44; that daily experience proves that many 
honest persons are thus constantly taking offence&#44;

where either no offence was meant&#44; or where the o&#39;&#39;&#8211; 
fence was the result of our own previously committed 
wrong. Shall we now&#44; brethren&#33; on this day rcisolve 
over&#44; so to say&#44; the ashes of the late chief of this land&#44; 
to endeavour to bear and foi&#8211;bear with the faults and 
foibles of each other&#63; Shall we not mutually forgive 
and forget injuries&#63; and start anew in the race of 
brotherly love &#63; shall we henceforward be ready to 
think well over the faults inherent to human nature 
to which we are all liable&#44; and to which the best of 
us not rarely yield in moments of weakness and ex&#8211; 
citement&#63; &#8212; Yes&#44; let us listen to the words of God&#44; 
which are so beautiful an exemplification of his good&#8211; 
ness and care&#44; inasmuch as He designed through his 
prophets to hold up the mirror to nature&#44; and to 
cause us to see our own image in the words&#44; in which 
He vouchsafed to declare to us his will and instruc&#8211; 
tion. 

Having thus exhorted his hearers to truth&#8211;speak&#8211; 
ing&#44; truth&#8211;judging&#44; restoring of peace&#44; and thinking 
kindly of another&#44; the holy seer concludes by admon&#8211; 
ishing the people against every species of false swear&#8211; 
ing. Many&#44; alas&#33; many more than we would suspect&#44; 
are guilty of this sin. They assert with an air of 
confidence and sincerity as positively true that of 
which they know but little&#44; and impose upon the 
credulity of the unsuspecting by their apparent can&#8211; 
dour. It is indeed lamentable that the words of or&#8211; 
dinary conversation only too much favour this spe&#8211; 
cies of deception&#44; and that there exists a great readi&#8211; 
ness to accommodate ourselves to the abuse of terms 
though slightly inconsistent with truth. The more 
therefore is there need that we do not allow ourselves

to bo led away to utter falsehood&#44; least of all to grow 
careless in the use of oaths to asseverate to the truth 
of things whicli are at best doubtful in their luitore. 
And still many arc not rarely led astray by the 
habit they observe in others&#44; to employ a degree of 
looseness in expressions which are hardly fitting if 
applied to truth &#59; and they not unfrequently cause an 
injury to others&#39; interests and reputation by the levity 
with which a common rumour is set down as a fact&#44; 
as though it were well ascertained and undeniable. 
All this&#44; however&#44; is wrong&#59; we are prohibited from 
sporting Avith falsehood&#44; even if it be for mere sport&#59; 
we ourselves may know that we are jesting&#44; but a 
third person may innocently believe us to be in earn&#8211; 
est&#44; and thus falsehood may be scattered by our in&#8211; 
strumentality&#44; and thus wound a heart unsullied and 
pure&#44; which we would gladly protect from injury at 
the expense of our life even. And adds the Text&#58; 
&#34;For all these are things that I hate&#44; saith the Lord.&#34; 
Our God is so holy and pure&#44; so true and faithful&#44; 
that any deviation from truth&#44; justice&#44; and the way 
of peace is an abomination in his sight&#44; and we can&#8211; 
not expect ever to enter his presence&#44; if we do not 
love ovir fellow&#8211;men&#44; and deal witli them in honour&#44; 
truth&#44; faith&#44; and kindness. But let not our ob&#8211; 
duracy&#44; the fear of yielding before the eyes of a 
frivolous&#44; fault&#8211;iinding world&#44; counsel us to persevere 
in a wrong which we have meditated&#44; in an injury 
which we have resolved on atjainst our brother. Who 
asks this duty of us&#63; is it not our Maker&#63; and have 
we not come hither to acknowledge his great power&#44; 
and to humble ourselves before llim &#63; And shall we 
hesitate&#44; fear to yield because we dread the taunts of

than we&#44; steeped in sin and iniquity&#63; and for what&#63; 
to perpetrate a wrong which nay ultimately not in&#8211; 
jure those whom we threaten&#44; and revert upon our&#8211; 
selves like a rolling stone which returns upon the 
head of the one that rolled it forward &#63; But let us 
take wiser counsel from the book which teaches us 
where is the source of life&#59; in order that much good 
may result from our labours on earth&#44; and truth&#44;

angels unto the footstool of the throne of Mercy&#33; 

And now&#44; O Lord our God&#44; who didst bring forth 
our forefathers from Egypt with a mighty hand&#33; we 
have sinned before Thee&#44; and followed the evil in&#8211; 
clination of our hearts&#44; in that we have forsaken thy 
commandments&#44; and oppressed one another in diso&#8211;

has in justice been poured out over us&#44; and that when 
we hoped for light there was darkness&#44; and that terror 
came where Ave looked for peace. But&#44; Father of

anger from the children of thy creation&#59; for Thou

DISCOURSE V. 

THE DIVINE KINGDOM. 

Brethren &#33; 

Among the Ijlessings which we are promised at the 
coming of the Messiah&#44; we find the following an&#8211; 
nouncement&#44; as delivered to us in the fourteenth chap&#8211; 
ter of Zechariah v. 9 &#58; 

&#34;And the Lord shall be the Kinsj over all the earth&#59; on that 
day there shall be the Lord one&#44; and his name shall be one.&#34; 

Among the causes which withdraw man from the 
service of his Maker are prominent want of faith and 
want of knowledge. We constantly transgress&#44; be&#8211; 
cause we have not yet confidence in divine assistance 
and a belief in God&#39;s superintendence&#44; or because we 
are not sufficiently familiar with divine things&#44; which 
knowledge it is that is to place us above the tempta&#8211; 
tions of e very&#8211;day life. Yet suppose even that we 
are duly familiar with our duties&#44; that from our very 
infancy it lias been the i&#41;ractice of our parents to point 
out to us the way we should go&#44; and that in riper 
years we have api&#41;lied ourselves diligently to a study 
which is so rich in blessed fruits&#58; what is it that often 
renders us children of wrath by the pursuit of sin&#63; 

<pb n="65"/>

THE DIVINE KINGDOM. 65 

Yet if we cast Ji look into our own heart&#44; we shall 
discover that the Lord does not reign alone there&#44; 
but that his place is supplied by the lust for pleasure&#44; 
or desire for wealth&#44; the fear of the world&#44; the cravings 
of ambition&#44; the hatred of our fellow&#8211;men&#44; or perhaps 
of that thrice accursed love of ease which despises 
labour&#44; and seeks its own gratitication at the hazard 
of injuring the immortal spirit by polluting it with 
transgressions against our neighbour&#39;s rights and 
possessions. We are told&#44; and every thing around 
us assures us of its being so&#44; that God rewards and 
punishes the deeds of his creatures&#59; but we have not 
that universal all&#8211;pervading feeling of adoration which 
will enable us to acknowledge Ilim the sole adorable 
one&#59; for we have often within us&#44; strange though it 
be&#44; a love of God overshadowed by a desire for unsub&#8211; 
stantial&#44; fleeting things&#44; not inaptly called the goods 
of this earth&#59; for when we cease to be indwellers of 
this sphere&#44; or when our spirit has severed its myste&#8211; 
rious connexion with the material body&#44; all the gifts 
which were valuable and prized in our mixed state 
of being are left behind as appertaining to the earth 
and its inhabitants. &#33; then does the man of power 
cast off his purple as an heir&#8211;loom for other shoulders&#59; 
then does the man of war not wield any more his 
martial baton &#59; other hands than the former owner 
clutch the much&#8211;desired gold&#59; and broad lands and 
fertile domains welcome the young possessor who will 
lavish perhaps the hard earnings of his penurious 
predecessor. And it is the desire after such treasures 
or the pleasures and gratifications which they bring&#44; 
which drive out of our heart the love which we natu&#8211; 
rally feel for our supreme Benefactor&#58; I say naturally 

6&#42;

feel&#44; for lost indeed must be that spirit which&#44; amidst 
the throng of evils which surround it&#44; does not occa&#8211; 
sionally glow with gratefulness and awe for the Au&#8211; 
thor of its existence. But the multitude of mankind 
are almost exclusively alive to the advantages which 
wealth&#44; power and pleasure afford&#59; they see tangibly 
before them&#44; that the man who is blessed with riches 
can live at ease&#44; and command the smiles no less than 
the services of both equals and inferiors &#59; that he 
who has authority conferred upon him is envied and 
courted&#44; because of the influence he exercises over 
the affairs of his country&#44; or for the fxvours he can 
bestow &#59; and there is scarcely a single individual who 
does not endeavour to enjoy life in all the varieties 
of satisfaction which he may deem attainable&#44; and to 
avoid all the hardships&#44; labours and sorrows which&#44; 
he fancies&#44; may embitter the brief hours which are 
allotted to him here below. If therefore our faith is 
not strong&#44; if we have not so far learned to place a 
proper value upon earthly things&#44; as to postpone these 
to the favour of the Lord &#58; it is evidently to be ex&#8211; 
pected that transgressions will be the natural result&#44; 
inasmuch as such a course will bring us&#44; according to 
our worldly views&#44; nearer to the things we so highly 
prize. 

Thus mucli may be said of transgression when the 
cause is want of faith&#44; where nevertheless a knowledge 
of religion has been imparted to the sinner. But 
suppose that we are unacquainted with our duties&#44; 
that our days have been spent in the vain pursuits 
of worldliness&#44; without any appreciation of the bless&#8211; 
ings flowing out of the word of God &#58; &#8212; what can you 
expect&#44; but that every deed almost&#44; done under the 

<pb n="67"/>

THE DIVINE KINGDOM. 67 

influence of such deplorable ignorance&#44; will be in con&#8211; 
travention of the law of God&#63; For the want of proper 
information will be the cause&#44; that the person who is 
about to act will not be able to judge correctly be&#8211; 
tween the right which should be practised&#44; and the 
wrong which ought to be avoided&#59; and hence it is not 
to be presumed that he will forego the apparent ad&#8211; 
vantages of absolute gain for the remote and unseen 
benefits resulting from a course of godliness. 

Whilst now the above two causes are as active in 
their operation in the affairs of mankind&#44; as we act&#8211; 
ually find them at this day&#44; it is natural that we 
should expect a great mass of sin and corruption. 
Man&#39;s heart is prone to evil&#59; from his infancy he is 
drawn to iniquity and the goods and pleasures of 
life seem to him to be the objects the most to be de&#8211; 
sired during the course of his earthly pilgrimage. If 
therefore we turn to the history of the world from its 
very beginning we shall discover that&#44; though at the 
very commencement of the creation man was inform&#8211; 
ed of the will of his God&#44; he was yet led away by 
sensuality to transgress the command which he had 
received. But&#44; because he was forewarned&#44; he justly 
incurred the wrath meet for his transgression&#44; and 
he was banished from the garden of delight to till in 
sorrow and toil the ground from Vv&#39;hich his body was 
taken. So you see that&#44; because our first father 
valued the advantage of sensual life beyond the fa&#8211; 
vour of God&#44; or in other words&#44; because he had not 
suflicient faith&#44; trust or confidence in his Maker&#44; he 
voluntarily chose that which he had been told was 
sinful and odious to Ilim from whom he had re&#8211; 
ceived his being&#59; and he fell from a state of inno&#8211; 

<pb n="68"/>

68 THE DIVINE KINGDOM. 

cence into one of shame and degradation&#44; where lie 
could only hope to obtain forgiveness and mercy&#44; 
whereas before he might have looked forward to re&#8211; 
ward and bliss. 

The death decreed against Adam was duly dis&#8211; 
pensed to him and his progeny &#59; and yet&#44; though 
stricken&#44; the latter had not learned to fear the Lord. 
They in the lapse of time forgot much of what be&#8211; 
longed to their duty&#44; and what remained unforgotten 
was left unheeded&#44; amidst the violence and corrup&#8211; 
tion which spread over the earth. And the decree 
went forth that the sinning race should be cut off&#59; 
and the mighty flood of waters overflowed the high&#8211; 
est mountains&#44; and not a vestige of life was left on the 
earth&#44; save those who escaped through the mercy of 
the Lord with the man who had been found rio&#8211;hteous 
in his generations. But barely had the flood sub&#8211; 
sided&#44; scarcely was the sign of the heavenly arch in&#8211; 
stituted as the covenant between God and all the 
earth&#44; when Koah himself sinned by converting the 
blessing of the vine into an inebriating drink&#44; and his 
son drew upon himself the parental malediction for 
his disrespect to his progenitor. In the succeeding 
generations the worship of the Creator fell speedily 
into disuse&#59; for mankind wished to live free from 
the trannnels of religion&#44; they designed to let their 
own will be the rule of their actions&#44; and they there&#8211; 
fore refused to instruct their children in the truths 
which had been transmitted through Adam&#44; Enoch&#44; 
&#33;N&#39;oah&#44; and the righteous ones of those days. No&#44; they 
would not acknowledge the Lord as the sole King 
of all the earth &#59; they invested with imaginary power 
things which are powerless&#59; they invented beings 

<pb n="69"/>

THE DIVINE KINGDOM. 69 

to whom they oifered adoration&#44; only to avoid&#44; as 
they vainly fancied&#44; the responsibility they owed to 
the Lord of all. Anon they endeavoured to oppose 
themselves to the decree of their Father who had 
given unto them the whole earth as their dwelling&#59; 
but by confounding their language&#44; and making them 
speak in different dialects&#44; He made them unintelli&#8211; 
gible to each other&#44; and in this manner forced them 
to seek different homesteads on the face of the earth&#44; 
and thus compelled them to endure his rule&#44; although 
they had forsaken his service. But what was the 
state of the world in consequence of the estrange&#8211; 
ment from the true path&#63; By degrees every spe&#8211; 
cies of violence and crime became every where pre&#8211; 
vailing&#44; and men at length proceeded to worship 
the most loathsome reptiles and the personifications 
of the vices as beings deserving of adoration &#59; and 
where a few were left who yet adored the true God&#44; 
they had to endure the persecutions and hatred of 
idolaters. In those days the Lord was not acknowl&#8211; 
edged King over all the earth. lie was not acknowl&#8211; 
edged the Everlasting One&#44; and his name was not 
One among the gentiles. But it was also in those 
days that from the stock of a Chaldean shepherd 
gradually a nation grew up&#44; to whom the Lord vouch&#8211; 
safed to impart a knowledge of his ways&#44; and whom 
He desired to place in Him faith and hope as their 
Kino&#8211; and Father&#44; and whom He designated to be his 
witnesses&#44; that He is indeed the God&#44; and that besides

wlioni lie had chosen followed his tjuidance into the 
trackless desert&#44; to receive the law which lie had 
ordained as the rule of their actions. On a former 
occasion your attention was drawn to the fact&#44; that 
punishment had failed to awaken a sense of religion 
in mankind&#44; and that a universal revelation&#44; such as 
had been given in the cases of Adam and Noah&#44; had 
not imbued the hearts of men with a knowledge of 
their duties. It is not to be said that there were no 
other means in the power of the Lord to establish 
universally a knowledge of His being and of His or&#8211; 
dinances &#59; but this much we may freely assert&#44; that 
He adopted the best method to do this so far as our 
judgment reaches&#44; by educating a whole people in 
the school of adversity&#44; taking them out from bondage 
with a mighty hand without their own agency&#44; and 
imparting to them as their possession a hiw founded 
on equal justice&#44; and a system than which not heaven 
itself can be purer and truer. O&#44; then went forward 
the ransomed of the Lord with childlike confidence 
to meet their God and King&#44; and well did He also&#44; 
at a time when they were stained with guilt&#44; remem&#8211; 
ber unto them this entircness of faith and trust&#59; 
for thus says the text &#58; &#34; Go and cry in the ears of 
Jerusalem&#44; saying&#44; Thus saitli the Lord&#44; I remember 
unto thee the kindness of thy youth&#44; the love of thy 
espousals&#44; when thou wcntest after me in the wil&#8211; 
derness&#44; in a land that is not sown. Israel is holy 
unto the Lord&#44; the first fruit of his increase&#44; all that 
devour him shall ofiend&#44; evil shall come upon them&#44; 
saith the Lord.&#34; &#40;Jer. ii. 2&#44; 3.&#41; But this faith lasted 
not for ever&#59; soon many sinned and made themselves 
for worship the likeness of a grass&#8211;eating ox&#59; and

because the reign of the Lord was not universal&#44; 
the Israelites also went astray after the vanities of 
the gentiles. Ignorance&#44; too&#44; of much that ought to 
have been universally known&#44; followed in the train 
of apostacy&#44; and after being at first an effect of irre&#8211; 
ligion&#44; it became in its turn the parent of the forget&#8211; 
fulness of the Lord. But now there was a written 
law from which many could drink&#59; a nation there 
was to whom the Word of the Lord had been given 
as an inheritance&#44; and the watchword 
was too firmly established to be shaken by the most 
degrading apostacy and image&#8211;worship which were 
practised among our forefathers. And thus&#44; though 
a thousand systems flourished awhile&#44; and reigned 
their space on earth&#44; they have all sunk into the 
black ocean of oblivion&#44; a&#33;&#41;d in their stead newer 
and more complicated fancies have arisen to make 
room for others&#44; perhaps yet more startling&#44; which 
will come after them&#59; whilst the religion announced 
from Sinai is yet contained untouched&#44; and unchanged 
in yonder book&#44; which we have preserved with so 
much care and solicitude. 

Now let us inquire&#44; what gave the law of Moses 
so much greater stability than the prior revelations 
to the Patriarchs &#63; Simply this&#44; that it was based 
upon and connected with the history of the people 
who were appointed its conservators. The covenant 
of Abraham had been already instituted&#44; and had de&#8211; 
scended to them with the peculiar protection of God&#44; 
which had been promised them. But now the cere&#8211; 
monies of the new covenant bore immediately&#8211; upon 
the tilings which they themselves had witnessed. 
The Sabbath was to remind them weekly of the great

supernatural deeds which the Creator alone could 
have performed. The Passover was to commemo&#8211; 
rate&#44; by the various laws incident to its celebration&#44; 
the first day when the shackles were knocked off&#44; so 
to say&#44; from their swollen limbs&#44; and when they were 
bid to go forth rejoicing unto freedom and truth. 
The Pentecost was to be kept on the day when their 
King lowered his majesty before their eyes on Mount 
Iloreb&#44; to speak unto them from amidst thunder and 
lightning&#44; and the cloud of glory that enveloped the 
throne of his power. And lastly&#44; the Feast of Tab&#8211; 
ernacles was established&#44; that in all future genera&#8211; 
tions the ceremonies incident thereto should recall 
to their memories that for many years they had trav&#8211; 
elled in the deserts of Arabia&#44; where they did not 
plough the field for their support&#44; and where they 
cultivated neither the vine&#44; nor the fig&#8211;tree&#44; nor the 
pomegranate&#44; nor the olive &#59; where they did not build 
houses to live in&#44; nor cultivated tljc arts to supply 
themselves with the elegancies or even the necessa&#8211; 
ries of life. Yes&#44; for forty years our forefathers dwelt 
in booths&#59; their garments did not grow old&#59; their 
shoes did not wear oif from their feet&#59; water was 
given them out of the flinty rock&#44; and their daily 
bread was every morning&#44; save the morning of the 
Sabbath&#44; miraculously supplied to them &#59; in short&#44; 
all their wants were provided for from the immediate 
bounty of their God. Xow these ceremonies and the 
recollections attendant on them were handed down 
from father to son&#44; and from son to grandson&#59; the 
whole life of the true Israelite was to be and was a 
series of reminiscences and acts of worship&#44; all found&#8211; 
ed upon the history of his nation&#44; and the gratitude

thence resulting to their great Benefactor. And 
though&#44; in many instances&#44; much sinninoj was wit&#8211; 
nessed among us&#44; the law had taken too deep root to 
be in danger of perishing entirely in the hearts of all 
Israel. No&#44; it survived&#44; and will survive to the end 
of time. 

The gentiles&#44; however&#44; with whose history and be&#8211; 
invr our reliijion had no connexion&#44; could not be ex&#8211; 
pected to embrace a system which was not given to 
them in a direct manner. They&#44; it is true&#44; saw the 
excellent eftects resulting from the piety founded on 
the Bible&#59; they could doubtless comprehend&#44; with 
ease&#44; the superior truthfulness of the doctrines of the 
Mosaic dispensation&#44; beyond that of any other. But 
their knowledge of divine things was not strong 
enough to overcome the want of faith under which 
tliey laboured &#59; and tlieir inclination for unrestrained 
freedom was not counterbalanced by the conviction 
of direct accountability. So then has time passed on&#44; 
and our religion is yet unacknowledged by any other 
people &#59; and the law of Moses is yet the inheritance 
of the congregation of Jacob alone. But does it not 
strike you&#44; brethren&#44; that in all ages&#44; and now no less 
than before&#44; the proximity of the gentiles has had a 
pernicious effect upon the conformity to be expected 
from us &#63; Have we not too readily relinquished our 
own blessed hopes for the vanities of those whose 
portion is not as our portion&#44; and whose lot is not 
like our lot&#63; Ay&#44; truly we have a law &#59; but where is 
the knowledge thereof which ought to be universal 
among us&#63; where the faith which should teach us to 
place the favour of God above all the desires of our 
hearts&#63; Alas&#33; alas&#33; the knowledge of divine things

is not prized&#44; we seek more the sciences and compre&#8211; 
hension oi&#39; worldly matters tlian to be instructed in 
the ways of the Lord and the duties which He has 
prescribed &#59; and even if we have learned the holy 
&#34;Word&#44; how anxious are we then to prove that we are 
free from that prejudice&#44; as some term it&#44; of a pecu&#8211; 
liar Jewish feeling&#44; as though it were a disgraceful 
thing to esteem the religion which God gave unto the 
sons of Israel&#44; and to wish to perpetuate the knowl&#8211; 
edge thereof among our descendants&#33; Prejudice do 
you call this&#63; bigotry you aver it to be&#63; Then let 
lis bless the time when such prejudice and such big&#8211; 
otry will become universal among us&#33; But no&#44; it is 
no prejudice which aims at perpetuating what God 
has bestowed as a special gift on Israel &#59; it is no big&#8211; 
otry which endeavours to instruct the young in the 
ancestral institutions&#44; and to enforce a due obedience 
to their behests&#59; for they are legitimate feelings&#44; ne&#8211; 
cessarily flowing from a conviction of the truth of 
our professions&#44; and have no reference whatever to 
the opinions of others difiering from us&#44; and have no 
affinity whatever with intolerance&#59; since they do not 
look forward to persuade even&#44; much less coerce any 
one who is not by descent a son of Abraham. But 
surely we ourselves ought to be ashamed of igno&#8211; 
rance in a matter which is our very life&#44; the cause of 
our existence as a separate people. Had it not been 
for the law&#44; we should have been where the ancient 
Romans&#44; Babylonians&#44; Assyrians&#44; and other nations 
now are&#44; lost&#44; blotted out&#44; and remembered only for 
the evil they have done&#44; and for the ruins which 
mark their existence. Do you wish such a late  
Israel&#63; Is there one Jew&#44; here or elsewhere&#44; who

would not shudder at the idea of the total overthrow 
and annihilation of his own kindred&#44; tlie house of Ja&#8211; 
cob &#63; &#8212; And how is this preservation to be effected&#63; 
Solely and simply by the transmission to all our de&#8211; 
scendants of the code which established us&#44; and by 
the observance of the covenant and the law which 
make ua a separate people among the nations of the 
earth. We should be a light to them&#44; but are on no 
account to suffer our light to be darkened by the 
shadow of their unbelief. If the lamp shines bright&#8211; 
est in a dark apartment&#44; if the miner does penetrate 
with its aid in the bowels of the earth &#58; should not the 
true Israelite endeavour to exhibit in his knowledge 
and his example a model to others&#44; that they may be 
struck with the conviction of God&#39;s power&#44; and be 
shown that nations may with safety go in the light of 
the Lord which was erst kindled at the promulgation 
of the commandments at Iloreb &#63; &#8212; The darkness yet 
covers the earth&#44; and a thick cloud the nations. Van&#8211; 
ity after vanity has been adopted&#44; and error has been 
cherished aftei&#39; error. One day the idolatry of a mul&#8211; 
titude of deities is abolished&#44; only to make way for 
the admission of the doctrines of a prophet whom 
God had not scut. &#8212; Again millions subscribe their 
names as servants of the Lord of hosts&#59; but in their 
ignorance they associate with Ilim a mediator be&#8211; 
tween Ilim and his creatures&#44; as though his hand were 
shortened&#44; and He vrere not able to save the man He 
has formed and to bless the work of His hands &#33; And 
shall wo for tilings like these cease to bo vigilant over 
ourselves&#63; shall doctrines like these induce us no 
longer to seek to teach the law and to proclaim aloud 
without fear or reserve our hope&#44; our confidence&#44; our

belief&#44; our entire faith in tlie Lord One&#63; Shall we be 
willingly ignorant or&#44; if instructed&#44; be wilfully untrue 
to our great King&#44; forswear his service and join our&#8211; 
selves to the multitude&#44; for no better reason&#44; that we 
can discover&#44; than that they are the majority&#44; and we 
but few in number&#63; And say&#44; at what period of the 
world was it that the righteous were the most numer&#8211; 
ous portion of mankind &#63; Say&#44; how many were saved 
in the ark &#63; and was not Abraham alone in his father&#39;s 
house when he proclaimed his faith in the Lord One&#63; 
how many associates had Moses when he spoke to 
Pharaoh in the name of this great Being &#63; when Jez&#8211; 
ebel slew the prophets of the Lord&#44; how many were 
with Elijah when he appeared before the multitude 
of idolaters on Carmel&#63; And to sum up all in a few 
words&#44; at what period of the history of the world were 
we otherwise than a small fragment of mankind&#63; 
Yet now we are to become faint&#8211;hearted&#44; because we 
arc not more numerous&#63; because we are not of greater 
importance in the scale of society &#63; because in the 
pursuit of our belief we may not be permitted to em&#8211; 
ploy as many days in the acquisition of wealth as our 
gentile neighbours&#63; But let us bo comforted by the 
reflection&#44; that no matter what our disparity in num&#8211; 
bers&#44; importance or worldly gains may be in compar&#8211; 
ison with others&#44; we shall ultimately suffer no harm&#44; 
if we only remain true and faithful to our Father in 
heaven. Let us consider how miraculously every 
thing has always worked for our preservation &#59; how 
when the sword and pestilence slow their millions&#44; 
we were comparatively exempt&#59; how a respect for our 
law produces temperance and contentment&#44; which 
bring in their train length of days and vigorous old 

<pb n="77"/>

age&#59; how even in barbarous countries&#44; where our 
members are denied access to high seminaries of 
learning&#44; they have nevertheless the reputation for 
intelligence superior to their neighbours. Let us re&#8211; 
flect on the many mercies which have sustained us in 
despite of ourselves&#44; when we presumptuously went 
astray after the evil desires of our hearts &#59; let us reflect 
on the wonderful change which has been wrought in 
the minds of gentiles in modern times&#44; so that now 
we are regarded with more kindliness than we were 
before&#59; let us consider that the same Beneficence 
wliich provided for our fathers in the desert yet 
watches over us&#44; and works all these deeds in our be&#8211; 
half&#58; and surely we shall not find cause for murmur&#8211; 
ing at the fact that the law of Moses is yet imposed 
on us as our lot&#44; and that we are called upon to make 
it appear lovely to our children&#44; and to glorify by its 
observance the name of the Lord One before the eyes 
of the families of the earth. 

In this manner I meant to exhibit that&#44; though we 
stand alone&#44; we would be acting suicidally&#44; were we 
to relax in our duty. But another consideration yet 
remains&#44; and this is&#44; that&#44; as we accepted the law be&#8211; 
cause its principles were interwoven with our history 
and being&#44; so there will come a time when the same 
will be the case with the gentiles. Remember that the 
law was not intrusted to us for our own gratification 
merely&#44; but chiefly that through us the kingdom of 
God might be established on earth. &#34;When this es&#8211; 
tablishment of universal truth will take place&#44; is not 
for us to solve&#59; the fact is sure of fulfilment&#59; the time 
only is concealed from us. But&#44; till this time comes&#44; 
we are bound by the terms of our covenant with God

to keep alive the fire of religion upon the altar of 
the world. &#8212; No matter who thou art&#44; humble son of 
Jacob &#33; thou art a priest in the sanctuary&#44; and it is 
thy province to purify thyself for the service by knowl&#8211; 
edge and faith&#44; to nourish the holy flame which is to 
illumine in God&#39;s own time the ends of the earth. 
Nor must thou be weary with watching&#33; But every 
day do thou raise thy eyes and heart to thy great 
Father&#44; and entreat Him that He would give thee 
light to see and strength to endure&#59; that thou mayest 
stand undismayed in the assault of passions which 
would counsel thee to stray aside from thy path&#44; and 
to walk away upon the roads of sin&#44; the end of which 
is darkness and death. &#8212; And indeed how would it be 
with us&#44; were we to become unfaithful to our trust&#44; 
on the day of the great redemption&#44; when all nations 
are to rejoice in the great glory then to be revealed 
to all eyes&#63; what shame&#44; what contrition would be 
ours&#44; were we no longer recognizable as a separate 
people adhering with unshaken faith to the God of 
Abraham&#33; But it cannot come to this&#33; We may 
be inclined to swerve&#44; many may actually sink into 
the embrace of their seducers&#44; and leave the fold of 
the Lord&#59; but many more will&#44; with all this&#44; remain 
to rally round the sacred emblem of the law&#59; and 
wlien the standard is raised on the mountains&#44; when 
nations will flock to the son of David to be taught of 
the ways of the Lord&#44; the children of Jacob will be 
there to receive joyfully among them the sons of the 
stranger&#44; who will no longer be eager for their de&#8211; 
struction&#44; but emulous like themselves to become 
children of salvation under the law&#44; which is quick&#8211; 
ening unto life&#44; both by its letter and its spirit. And 

<pb n="79"/>

THE DIVINE KINGDOM. 79 

when tills has taken place&#44; the Lord will institute to 
the gentiles one of our festivals&#44; the Feast of which 
we arc now celehrating the conclusion&#44; on which they 
are annually to assemble through their deputies to 
worship before the Lord of hosts at Jerusalem. And 
why this feast&#63; Because the Passover and the Pente&#8211; 
cost were properly days of liberation of Israel from 
physical and moral bondage &#59; but the Tabernacles&#44; as 
was said ah&#8211;eady&#44; is a commemoration of divine good&#8211; 
ness and protection &#59; it is the emblem of the superin&#8211; 
tending watchfulness of the all&#8211;seeing Eye who leaves 
not a bird to fall to the ground before its time&#44; and 
who regards alike the lowly and the great. When 
now the nations are brought to a knowledge that 
their thoughts were vain&#44; and their deities powerless 
to save &#58; they will become&#44; so to say&#44; more immedi&#8211; 
ately children of Providence&#44; and subjects of the 
King of kings&#44; and servants of the Lord of lords&#59; 
they will no longer be a stumbling&#8211;block by their 
ignorance and example to the people of Israel &#59; but 
they will&#44; like these&#44; acknowledge as God the Ever&#8211; 
lasting One alone&#44; and thus He wi&#42;ll be the King of 
all the earth&#44; acknowledged the sole God&#44; and em&#8211; 
phatically be called One&#44; since besides Ilim and with 
Ilim no being will receive the adoration of any son 
of man. And to commemorate this great event the 
festival of providential care will be a season of uni&#8211; 
versal rejoicing&#44; and from all the earth will come am&#8211; 
bassadors to the residence of their King&#44; to bow down 
and to worship at the house where He will let his 
glory visibly dwell among mankind. And this state 
of universal knowledge will be a state of universal 
righteousness&#44; and no one who is unwilling to ac&#8211;

knowledge his subjection to the majesty of Heaven 
will be left to encumber the earth with his presence. 
But says the doubter&#44; &#34; Will indeed all this come 
to pass&#63;&#34; Yes&#44; it will&#33; all the accounts of past ages 
teach us that every thing is perishable&#44; and has per&#8211; 
ished or will perish&#44; save the word of God alone. This 
alone has survived all the shocks of time&#59; and often 
as it was neglected&#44; much as it has been obscured by 
the acts and words of men&#44; it has ever risen up again 
with renewed and increased vigour. And therefore 
have in all ages the altars of heathenism stooped and 
tumbled down before the power of this Word &#59; and 
the errors too of the new systems&#44; which have en&#8211; 
grafted upon its holy foundation the ideas of a me&#8211; 
diator and similar theories&#44; will surely vanish when 
the warfare against truth will have ended. Already 
now the mighty fabrics are shaken &#33; the thousand&#8211; 
columned temples tremble&#33; the teachers of error are 
at war with each other&#33; one binds&#44; the other loosens&#33; 
pillar after pillar crumbles to the dust &#33; and in vain 
do the mighty take counsel against the Lord and his 
anointed. But pVoceed in your unholy work&#44; your 
working is m vain &#33; He that sits enthroned in heaven 
smiles at your endeavours&#44; and the words of faith 
which our babes are taught to lisp&#44; and which ring in 
the ear of our dying sires&#44; &#34; The Lord is One&#44;&#34; will 
hurl you from power and level to the ground the 
mighty fabrics on which you have been toiling for 
ages. Yes&#44; &#34; the Lord is One &#33; his name is one &#34; will 
yet be the faith of all the world&#44; and then will be in&#8211; 
deed a day of glory&#44; and a day of rejoicing to all the 
faithful&#44; to the servants that remained true and un&#8211; 
shaken&#44; who taught untiinchingly the truth they had

vice of the Lord whilst hnt few so worshipped. But 
they too will rejoice who are glowing with a new zeal 
in the work of regeneration&#44; who come from all parts 
of the world&#44; &#40;which now has been rendered easily 
possible by the recent improvements in the arts ap&#8211; 
plied to travelling&#44;&#41; to worship annually the Lord at 
Jerusalem his holy city&#44; on this festival of Taber&#8211; 
nacles&#59; and thus men from all nations and from all 
climes&#44; the fair European and the sooty Ethiop&#59; the 
men from the icy pole and they from the burning 
equator&#44; all&#44; all will exclaim&#44; with one heart and one 
voice&#44; in speech again understood by all alike&#34; and in 
a dialect no longer diverse and not comprehended by 
every son of Adam&#58; The Lord is King over all the 
earth &#33; no one is to share his glory &#59; there is no saviour 
besides Ilim our Saviour&#59; He is One and One be his 
name&#44; praised and glorified for evermore&#33; Amen. 

Our Father and King &#33; east out for our iniquities 
we are scattered among the gentiles&#44; and our sanc&#8211; 
tuary is desolate&#44; our altars are destroyed&#44; and no 
priest is there to make atonement for our sins. But 
in our captivity we have been taught to feel more 
strongly our dependence upon thy bounty and mercy&#33; 
O have mercy then upon the remnant that has escaped&#44;

words of our lips&#44; and let the meditations of our hearts 
be acceptable as incense before Thee. Shed also thy

AVe often hear persons boast of their religious ob&#8211; 
servance&#44; of their religious hopes and comfortable ex&#8211; 
perience of an inward holiness &#59; whereas there are 
others who ridicule all such sentiments and actions 
founded upon them&#44; and speak and live as though there 
were nothing deserving of more consideration than the 
mode of life&#44; which they would iiiin make us believe 
to be the legitimate result of human reasoning. The 
pride of spiritual elevation of the first class&#44; and the 
vaunting indifference of the other are equally appar&#8211; 
ent &#59; and if the first is at times odious through its of&#8211; 
ten misplaced zeal and stoical indiflerence&#44; the latter 
becomes disgusting through its disregard of the spirit&#8211; 
ual light&#44; which the Creator bestows on men through 
the variety of incidents and changes which constitutes 
human life. When therefore a man is absorbed in 
the idea of his own excellence&#44; be this the result of 
an overweening sense of righteousness and religious 
confidence&#44; or produced by a disregard of the duty 
which he owes to his Maker &#58; he is equally void&#44; al&#8211;

thoiisrh in diti&#39;eroiit cleffrees&#44; of that rcliic&#39;ioiis liumil&#8211; 
ity and singleness of faith wliich are held up to our 
imitation by the great luminaries of our race&#44; such as 
Abraham and Moses. But the number of outwardly 
strict zealots&#44; whose religion consists in externals 
more than in a deep&#8211;seated knowledge of their sinful 
nature&#44; is not so great as of the class of the unbeliev&#8211; 
ers in a direct responsibility to God for all their do&#8211; 
ings &#59; or&#44; in other words&#44; there are more who do not 
feel religion both outwardly and inwardly&#44; than those 
who are mere formalists&#59; and&#44; consequently&#44; we are 
very apt to be oftener shocked by non&#8211;conformity&#44; 
than by the heedless&#44; persecuting zeal of men who 
lack spirituality in their religion. 

It is not&#44; however&#44; our purpose to&#8211;day to contrast 
the evils which spring from the absence of religion 
on the one side&#44; and its misapplication on the other&#59; 
but we will merely endeavour to show the applicabil&#8211; 
ity of a proper sense of our relation to God to the 
endurance of whatever may be dispensed to us&#59; and 
to exhibit the dangers which must arise&#44; if our mind 
is not betimes subjected to a proper training and a 
correct conception of things&#44; which it behooves us to 
weigh well in every stage of our existence. Let us 
reflect. We arc the creatures of an all&#8211;wise Provi&#8211; 
dence. What is Providence&#63; It is that quality or 
attribute of the Deity which surveys&#44; superintends&#44; 
and provides for all the occurrences of life. Can this 
attribute be exercised by inadvertence&#63; without due 
care and reflection&#63; Assuredly not&#59; or else we must 
impute TO the Lord the imperfections of linite nature&#44; 
since the absence of care and thought is the cause of 
error in man as often at least as want of knowledge. 

<pb n="85"/>

DIVINE JUSTICE. 85 

To impute want of knowledge to God would at once 
strike any reflecting mind as inconsistent with his 
purity&#59; and for the same reason the absence of care 
must be equally so. Now&#44; if God knows every thing&#44; 
&#8212; we know lie does and must&#44; &#8212; it follows from our 
definition&#44; that He cannot avoid&#44; from the immensity 
of his knowledge and power&#44; which extend and are 
applicable to the minutest thing&#44; no less than to the 
greatest&#44; directing his view and his superintendence 
to every portion of what He has created&#44; that is&#44; to 
every thing which enjoys an existence. In such a 
superintendence there can occur no mistake in any 
event within the ken of the supervising Power&#58; or&#44; 
in other words&#44; no event can take place in all the 
range of existence which has not received the sane&#8211; 
tion of Providence&#44; which is the power exercising this 
superintending care. I do not mean to assert that this 
limits our liberty of choice&#59; for the agents endowed 
with intellect&#44; such as man is&#44; have received a free&#8211; 
dom to do as they please without control&#44; so far as 
actual force is concerned &#59; that is to say&#44; there is no 
compulsion exercised to make them act counter to 
their will and inclination. In addition to&#44; and in con&#8211; 
sequence of&#44; this freedom of choice&#44; there is responsi&#8211; 
bility&#44; by which I mean&#44; that each and all are respon&#8211; 
sible for any act they do from a free choice&#44; where no 
insurmountable force is laid upon their freedom of 
selecting. In so iar only&#44; then&#44; the Providence which 
guards us is not accountable for every occurrence&#44; and 
in so tar are we not at liberty to say&#44; that every event 
in which man as a free agent is the actor is of an 
unmixed good character and tendency&#44; since herein 
man and not Providence is responsible. It is not&#44;

however&#44; for ns to determine precisely how the om&#8211; 
niscience of God is compatible with an nnlimited 
freedom of action &#58; enongh for onr purpose that this 
is the doctrine of Scripture&#59; and with this we must 
rest satisfied as believers in the justice and truth of 
the Most Higli. All that was meant to be exhibited 
in this connexion is to assert&#44; as a legitimate deduction 
from scriptural authority that all the occurrences of 
life emanating immediately from a Source indepen&#8211; 
dent of direct human agency are in their nature an 
unmixed benefit to the world at large&#44; and within the 
scope of a just administration of the world by its Di&#8211; 
vine Author. Let us examine this by the standard 
we have laid down. The Creator must be beneficent&#44; 
or else He would not of a free choice have given life 
to so many beings&#44; and filled the world with so manv 
means of aftbrding enjoyment to everj&#8211; living crea&#8211; 
ture &#59; as says David &#40;Ps. cxlv. 15&#44; 16&#41;&#44; &#34;The eyes of 
all wait upon Thee&#44; and Thou givest them their food 
in due season &#59; Thou openest thy hand&#44; and satisfiest 
the desire of every living thing.&#34; He cannot be ca&#8211; 
pricious&#44; irritable&#44; and changing in his afiections&#59; for 
Avherever we turn our view&#44; if we inquire into events 
of a bygone age or of our own times&#44; we shall dis&#8211; 
cover that an unceasing chain of acts of kindness is 
visible in every department of nature &#59; and that where 
a destruction is presented at a first glance&#44; it is but a 
step to a renewed existence in another and perhaps a 
more beautiful and permanent shape and form &#59; in 
fact&#44; that which in our haste we term destruction&#44; an&#8211; 
nihilation&#44; or loss&#44; is not so in reality. Now&#44; if this 
can be proved to be true&#44; it follows as a necessary 
consequence&#44; that every act of Providence is of an

pain&#63; of sorrow&#63; of sickness&#63; of death&#63; are they 
not evils &#63; They certainly are so&#44; to speak the lan&#8211; 
guage of man&#59; but it does not follow that they are 
not requisites in the economy of a beneficent Provi&#8211; 
dence. It is only necessary that we come to approach 
the investigation&#44; whenever auy such evil is presented 
in our own instance or that of those dear to us&#44; with 
minds properly imbued with knowledge and confid&#8211; 
ing trust&#44; and the consideration that&#44; however we may 
look upon ourselves and our own immediate friends 
as of vast importance to ourselves&#44; we and they are 
at last nothing more than a small integral portion of 
the entire immensity &#34;which forms&#44; in its various ram&#8211; 
ifications and almost endless variety&#44; the system of 
nature which our and its God lias created in wisdom 
and mercy. 

Says David &#40;Ps. cxlv. 9&#41; &#58; &#34; The Lord is good to 
all&#44; and his mercies are over all his works &#59;&#34; and the 
longer we investigate&#44; the more readily will we yield 
assent to the truth of this assertion. We must not 
forget that our God is eternal&#44; everlastingly the same&#44; 
of unending power. If then to&#8211;day we are suffering 
from any thing we call evil&#44; that does not prove that 
to&#8211;morrow there may not be a sudden and blissful 
chaui&#39;&#8211;e in our circumstances. At the beffinninjy of 
night there may be weeping&#44; and sobs&#44; and sorrow&#44; 
and the rising sun may scatter joy&#44; and gladsome 
smiles&#44; and renewed hope. Ay&#44; the sun of our earthly 
life may set&#44; as men speak&#44; for ever&#59; but may&#44; doQn 
it not shine more lucent&#44; more unclouded in a renewed 
state of existence&#63; Are we cut ofi&#39; utterly&#44; because

mittiiii&#58;&#59; you do not understand this&#44; I would ask you 
tu explain to rae what is life as we find it before us&#63; 
Look upon the butterfly which flits along on gay 
painted pinions&#58; has it not life&#63; Upon the niglitin&#8211; 
gale whose melody&#44; though himself unseen&#44; ravishes 
your delighted ear&#58; has he not life &#63; Upon the fleet 
horse as he dashes along in his heedless career obey&#8211; 
ing the will of his rider&#63; Upon the vast and huge 
elephant&#44; who stands in his towering strength amidst 
the din of battle and the rush of contending hosts&#58; 
has he not life&#63; And then turn upon the many races 
of man&#44; each distinguished by some peculiar charac&#8211; 
teristic&#44; by some marked difterence of feature &#58; and 
tell me&#44; have they not life&#63; And then inform me&#44; 
if you can&#44; what paints the l&#41;utterfly&#39;s wings &#63; what 
gives sweetness to the nightingale&#39;s song&#63; what fleet&#8211; 
ness to the horse &#63; what strength&#44; and sagacity&#44; and 
courage to the elephant&#63; what speech&#44; variety of dia&#8211; 
lect&#44; diversity of colour and temperament&#44; to the dif&#8211; 
ferent races of our own species&#63; Perhaps to explain 
this myStery&#44; you wnll resort to the assertion that it 
is the result of organization&#44; coupled Avith vitality. 
But by saying this you only use synonymous terms 
with the word lile&#44; and you have not advanced a 
single step in your attempted explanation. And no 
matter how learned you are&#44; all you can do is to as&#8211; 
sert it is so&#59; and if you are really wise&#44; you will at 
once confess your ignorance of God&#39;s ultimate pur&#8211; 
pose&#44; and your inability to penetrate farther than the 
mere surface into a proper understanding of his crea&#8211; 
tion. We assume&#44; therefore&#44; as proved&#44; that life it&#8211;

man above the brute is too subtle a substance &#40;if sub&#8211;

stance it may properly be called wliicli can not be 
subject to the admeasurement capable to bo performed 
by our bodily senses&#41; to be correctly comprehended 
by any means in our power. Wo will proceed a step 
farther&#44; and assert that there is au essential difference 
between animal and human life &#59; for&#44; despite of the 
great sagacity which some dumb creatures&#44; such as 
the horse&#44; dog&#44; camel&#44; and elephant display &#59; despite 
of the forethought exhibited by others&#44; for instance&#44; 
the beaver and the busy little bee &#59; despite of the ex&#8211; 
treme swiftness possessed by some&#44; as the chamois 
and the deer&#44; and their instinct to seek the inaccessi&#8211; 
ble heights to which they resort&#59; despite of the fe&#8211; 
rocity exhibited by many others&#44; such as you see in 
the untamed lion&#44; the voracious tiger&#44; and the spotted 
leopard&#44; they are all subject to the power and control 
of man&#44; who is generally their inferior in some physi&#8211; 
cal capacity &#59; and nearly all&#44; if not all&#44; can be tamed 
to his use&#44; and be even domesticated and live in com&#8211; 
panionship&#44; though in servitude&#44; with him. Does 
not this prove the truth of the Scripture which&#44; in 
the history of creation&#44; asserts that man was created 
to be the lord of all subordinate nature&#44; from the in&#8211; 
sect that dances in the sunbeam&#44; to the mighty whale 
that lashes into foam the waters of the vasty deep &#63; 
Another thing&#44; however&#44; it proves likewise&#44; that the 
spirit of man is essentially different from the vitality 
which is inherent to animals &#59; and that though man&#44; 
considered as an animal&#44; which he undeniably is&#44; has 
propensities and wants which ally him to his subor&#8211; 
dinates&#44; there is something&#44; whatever that something 
may be&#44; which places him in a state of exaltation far&#44; 
lar above the greatest and wisest of them all. This

something&#44; by way of distinction&#44; we call in Hebrew 
lyijj or nn&#44; soul or spiiit in English. It is not so iiinch 
the words we use as the idea we convey&#44; which is of 
any importance in our inquiry. We say&#44; therefore&#44; 
that deny as you please the independent existence 
of spirit&#44; you must admit that there is a something 
which elevates man above the beast&#44; properly so called&#44; 
and whether you call it spirit or not&#44; soul or some&#8211; 
thing else&#44; it matters not &#59; and the existence of this 
ethereal&#44; invisible fluid &#40;again to use a phrase often 
employed&#44; though it does not correspond altogether 
with the idea&#44; so poor is language that very often we 
feel more than we can express&#41; is proved by the very 
means which you employ to deny its existence&#59; for 
it is felt&#44; its activity is experienced&#44; whether you put 
man as a rider on the back of the horse&#44; whether you 
exhibit him as leading the bear along obedient to his 
every nod&#44; or whether you place him before others 
of his species expressing by articulate and defined 
sounds the emotions which are agitating&#44; or the fears 
which trouble him. Is there not enough of evidence 
in all these and a thousand other things&#44; to prove 
beyond doubt&#44; that&#44; as Ave read in Job xxxii. 8 &#58; &#34; But 
there is spirit in men&#44; and the inspiration of the Al&#8211; 
mighty giveth them understanding&#63;&#34; And if you 
say&#44; it is too wonderful for belief&#44; then again we will 
recur to the question which we already propounded 
relative to the organization of animal life &#59; and till 
this be clearly and incontestably elucidated&#44; we will 
rest for security upon the authority of Scripture&#44; 
which is&#44; as we have proved&#44; borne out by our own 
experience&#44; that there is a spirit distinct from mat&#8211; 
ter. If now such an existence is possible&#44; what hiu&#8211;

dors the Almighty to lot it continue in existence after 
the body shall have taken the usual course of or&#8211; 
ganized life&#44; that is&#44; ceased to exist in the shape it 
was wont to bear&#63; or to express ourselves in terms 
more familiarly used&#44; what prevents God to grant us 
a heavenly life&#44; after our earthly career is ended &#63; 
But again you say&#44; that you do not understand it&#58; 
let us&#44; therefore&#44; resort to some more minute eluci&#8211; 
dation. What is death&#63; The cessation of animate 
existence&#44; or decay&#44; rottenness&#44; corruption&#44; whether 
applied to animal or vegetable life. Is it any thing 
else&#63; surely not. You will perhaps say it is annihi&#8211; 
lation&#44; a destruction&#44; total and final. But is this 
borne out by our every&#8211;day experience&#63; Behold the 
voracious silkworm&#44; or the destructive caterpillar. 
It crawls as it were into life&#44; a minute&#44; unsightly&#44; 
shapeless thing. Watch it&#44; &#8212; it seizes upon the green 
herbage which nature so bountifully provides&#59; it 
grows rapidly&#44; amazingly&#44; to the full size which it is 
capable of attaining&#59; behold&#44; its work is done&#59; it eats 
no more&#59; it only seeks for repose to weave its own 
winding&#8211;sheet. Approach it again&#44; it lies motionless&#44; 
buried&#44; dead in its silvery sepulchre &#58; and is its exist&#8211; 
ence ended&#63; You err&#59; a new life soon is active in 
the tiny charnel&#8211;house&#44; and from the wonderful cere&#8211; 
ment springs forth a new insect&#44; and speeds along in 
a new existence&#44; and with wondrously spangled Avings&#44;

the open bosom of the earth the seed&#44; which is to 
yield him a rich return. The harrow passes again 
over the furrow&#44; and from the human sight tlic rich 
treasure is hid&#44; and is surrendered confidingly into 
the hands of the Giver of life. And soon the seed 
dies&#44; rots&#44; decays&#44; is no longer lit for human food&#44; 
and its bright colouring is changed to a dull&#44; colour&#8211; 
less mass. But is the death final &#63; has existence ter&#8211; 
minated with decay&#63; Again come hither&#44; and look&#58; 
as far as your eye reaches&#44; a covering of the richest 
green o&#39;erspreads the field &#59; for the decaying seed 
has become instinct with new life&#44; and a beneficent 
Providence elicits the germ from a putrescent source. 
Anon the wintry snows bury up the tender shoots&#44; 
and again the field is hid from view for days and 
weeks by the gentle downy cover which drops from 
the cloud&#8211;clad sky&#59; but still the seeds die not &#8212; they 
yet survive this change even. And when the vernal 
sun bursts forth to gladden anew the frozen earth&#44; he 
speedily strips the landscape of its uniform deadness 
and dreary aspect&#59; and as he mounts higher in his 
course&#44; so too the young and tender shoots acquire 
strength and fulness&#44; and ere the summer has shied 
away&#44; a blissful harvest overjoys the husbandman&#44; 
who reaps the fruit of his labour from amidst corrup&#8211; 
tion and decay. 

Is this not so&#63; is not every growth and increase 
preceded by corresponding changes of form &#63; What&#44; 
then&#44; is death&#44; even as we find it&#44; but a transmutation 
from one state to another&#63; And who says&#44; then&#44; 
that death is final when applied to man&#63; True&#44; we 
too open the earth&#44; and each and all of us deposit in 
the opened grave a seed more valued&#44; than that which

readily drops from the hands of the husbandman &#59; 
with tearful eyes we stand by as more and more the 
beloved is hidden from view&#59; but do we not&#44; even as 
does the husbandman&#44; intrust what we place in the 
earth into the hands of the Lord of life&#63; and may 
we not then expect to see arising from the grave be&#8211; 
dewed with our tears&#44; and warmed ere long by the 
sun of Heaven&#44; a new life&#44; a new and holier existence&#63; 
It is wonderful thus to believe &#59; but are the physical 
changes which we have described less wonderful&#44; 
though they admit not of doubt or cavil &#63; And shall 
a mere speechless insect rise into a newer and more 
beautiful life&#63; shall the inanimate seed ripen into a 
new existence&#44; multiplied and varied a thousand fold&#63; 
and yet shall it be unreasonable to believe that the 
crown of God&#39;s creation may not be likewise restored&#44; 
nay in the very flesh&#44; arising again from the corrup&#8211; 
tion into which his body has been thrown &#63; Yes&#44; we 
are doubters&#59; we i&#39;aucy that our cause is not correctly 
judged by our everlasting Judge&#59; nevertheless&#44; his 
word is full of promise&#44; full of the assurance of better 
things&#59; and thus speaks the prophet &#40;Isaiah xxvi. 19&#44; 
20&#41;&#58; &#34;They shall live&#44; thy dead&#59; together with my 
dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing&#44; ye that 
dwell in the dust&#59; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs&#44; 
and the earth shall cast forth her dead. Come&#44; my 
l&#41;eople&#44; enter thou into thy chambers&#44; and shut tliy 
doors about thee &#59; hide thyself as it were for a little 
moment&#44; until the indignation be overpast.&#34; We 
could cite many more passages from ihe blessed vol&#8211; 
ume to prove&#44; that it affirms in language not to be 
misunderstood&#44; that death is but a phase in our ex&#8211;

if a mystery&#44; it is certainly no greater mystery than 
life itself&#44; as was endeavoured to be shown. 

All this proves&#44; incontestably&#44; that the so&#8211;called 
evil is a part of providential rule&#44; and one of the 
changes which we must undergo in order to be able 
to assume that station or that state of existence for 
which we were created. Some of you may perhaps 
ask &#58; &#34;Why are we not at once placed into the highest 
state of perfection&#44; witliout our passing iirst through 
so many trials to reach it&#63;&#34; But reflect that&#44; to dive 
in this manner into the counsel of God&#44; would be 
in effect arrogating to ourselves wisdom of an equal 
degree as is possessed by Ilim &#59; as well might the 
infant ask&#44; why he is not born at once a man in 
stature and intellect. Every thing on earth is pro&#8211; 
gressive&#44; every thing is capable of improvement by 
education and training&#59; and why may we not assume 
that our earthly existence is also a state of progressive 
improvement&#44; no less than of probation &#63; The Lord 
gave us for tliis reason a law of truth&#44; which&#44; being 
the emanation of his own will and wisdom&#44; must&#44; if 
obeyed&#44; guide us aright on the path which leads to 
happiness. And in this spirit we read &#40;Isaiah xlii. 
21&#41;&#58; &#34;The Lord is well pleased for his righteousness&#39; 
sake&#59; He magnifieth the law&#44; and maketh it honour&#8211; 
able.&#34; Yes&#44; brethren&#44; without diving daringly into 
the secret will of our Maker&#44; we may assert that an&#8211; 
gelic perfection is no test of merit&#44; inasmuch as per&#8211; 
fection attained as the gift of the Creator&#44; without the 
previous labour of the creature&#44; is not deserving of 
reward&#44; seeing that it was impossible to reject the 
least part of the blissful attainment. Whereas the 
presence of temptation&#44; the existence of attainable 

<pb n="95"/>

DIVINE JUSTICE. 95 

evil&#44; render the avoidance of the last and the disregard 
of the former a matter of praiseworthy and meri&#8211; 
torious activity. If man were immortal&#44; then must 
he have been made sinless and passionless&#59; for only 
in such a state would it comport with wisdom to leave 
him on earth&#59; since&#44; as it now is&#44; the only relief man&#8211; 
kind has&#44; under Providence&#44; of the injuries inflicted 
by the wicked is their removal by death&#44; or inca&#8211; 
pacity by diseases&#44; mental or bodily. Ask we then&#44; 
&#34;Why does evil exist&#63; why do we meet with sorrow&#44; 
with pain&#44; with suflering&#44; Avith death&#63;&#34; we shall be 
answered&#44; these are the agents of the Deity to restrain 
the eflects of sin upon mankind at large. &#34;Why do 
the riirhteous die&#63; and suft&#39;er&#63;&#34; Because no man is 
free from sin&#44; and because man in a mixed state of 
good and evil is not destined to remain here for ever&#59; 
and since the spirit cannot be purified whilst it is in 
connexion with the body&#44; it follows as a necessary 
consequence that a severance must take place when&#8211; 
ever the Lord deems it best. &#34;Do not many pious 
people die young and in the midst of usefulness&#63;&#34; 
Assuredly &#59; but again&#44; are we the judges of our Maker&#44; 
to prescribe Him rules for action &#63; Our wise men 
have left us a beautiful apologue on this subject&#44; 
which permit me to relate to you in this place &#58; A 
wise king upon a time hired a number of labourers 
to work in a beautiful garden near his palace&#44; and 
about midday he came himself to superintend and to 
look at his servants. All were at work&#44; but he singled 
out one who appeared most industrious and intent on

called for their wages&#44; and those who had worked 
the whole day&#44; were surprised when the king ordered 
the full amount to be paid out to him who had been 
at work but half the time. As natural&#44; the others 
murmured at what they conceived an injustice to 
them&#58; &#34;Have we not laboured the whole day&#63; and 
are we to be paid no more than one who has not 
earned more than half that we did&#63;&#34; &#34;Silence&#44;&#34; 
commanded the king&#59; &#34;it was my fault that he did 
not work as long as you did&#44; and it was my knowl&#8211; 
edge of his superior excellence that I took him early 
from his task to converse with me.&#34; You&#44; of course&#44; 
understand the application. The king is the King of 
kings&#44; the Holy One&#44; blessed be his name&#59; the garden 
is our earthly existence&#59; the palace the state of felicity 
in the presence of our Lord&#59; the labourers all man&#8211; 
kind&#59; the day of labour the life of man&#59; the labourer 
called by the king from his work the righteous who 
diligently strives to fultil all the duties accessible to 
him&#59; nightfall is the close of life&#44; when all mankind 
come before the divine tribunal to receive the reward 
of their labour. And when now it pleases the Lord 
to remove a faithful servant betimes from the field 
of his usefulness&#44; what needs he complain &#63; will not 
his reward be as ample as though all his good inten&#8211; 
tions had been accomplished&#63; and what right have 
the aged labourers to complain&#63; was it not the Lord 
of the beautiful garden&#44; the Master of them all&#44; who 
called to himself thus early the one who had been 
appointed to work with them for a time&#63; 

In this light must we view the loss of the righteous &#59; 
God deemed it best to end their task&#59; they had found 
grace in his sight&#44; and their reward&#44; therefore&#44; must

be sure&#44; though others have done more and hxboured 
longer. &#8212; &#34;Why are diseases sent&#63;&#34; If life were to 
pass away without any pain to endure&#44; how bitter 
u&#39;oukl be the parting&#8211;&#59; we could not think of quitting 
Ml existence so constantly blessed with sweets and 
joys. But in mei&#39;cy to corruptible nature&#44; the seeds 
of decay shoot up into sight before the harvest is 
i&#8211;eady for the sickle &#59; and when the body is racked 
with pain&#44; when tlie intellect becomes clouded&#58; man 
himself looks forward to a cessation of life by the 
mild hand of death &#59; mild&#44; I say&#44; because it closes 
upon him a scene of anguish&#44; insupportable for his 
feeble strength. &#8212; &#34;And why do we often sulfer from 
penury&#63; from obloquy&#63; from unmerited censure&#63;&#34; 
All these are trials by which our constancy is proved&#44; 
by which we ourselves can judge of ourselves&#44; whether 
or not we love the Lord Avith all our heart&#44; all our 
soul&#44; and all our might.&#8212; &#8211;Again&#44; we have often sinned&#44; 
and all such sufferings are then sent upon us in niercy&#44; 
to awaken our attention&#44; and to admonish us&#44; that we 
have subjected ourselves to wrath&#44; and that we ought 
speedily to return and seek a renewal of divine fa&#8211; 
vour. 

Who then will complain of the injustice of God&#63; 
seeing that we are his in every sense of the word&#44; 
linite while He is unending&#63; mortal while lie is of 
everlasting lite&#63; Yes&#44; why should we doubt of his

and with all thy might&#44; &#8212; with whatever thou pos&#8211; 
sessest of worldly things&#59; so also art thou bound to 
be extremely thankful to Ilim for every measure lie 
may mete out to thee.&#34; Yes&#44; this should be our 
study from our earliest youth&#44; to consider every act 
of the Lord as intended for our individual and social 
improvement&#44; as sent in mercy to bind the creature 
closer and closer to his Maker. 

Having premised this much&#44; let ns turn our atten&#8211; 
tion to the second point of our subject&#44; narnely&#44; the 
dangers arising from an improper training&#44; wliich we 
stated to be an over&#8211;confidence in our righteousness&#44; 
and disregard of spiritual light. The person who 
looks upon himself as better than his neighbours be&#8211; 
cause of his piety&#44; is not likely to go through life 
in humility and devotion. He looks upon God as his 
debtor&#44; who ought to pay him liberally for the many&#8211; 
good deeds he daily executes. If&#44; then&#44; any evil oc&#8211; 
curs to him&#44; he feels himself wronged by his great 
Judge&#44; he imagines&#44; perhaps&#44; that his case has not 
been properly noticed before the august tribunal. 
Again&#44; he beholds those who are wicked prosperous 
and joyful&#59; and straightway he asks&#44; &#34;What use is 
my piety&#63; the wicked llourish as well as myself&#44; &#8212; nay&#44; 
they are richer&#44; happier&#44; more renowned than I am&#59; 
there is no use&#44; so far as I am concerned&#44; in my being 
lighteous.&#34; Many feel so&#44; though but few may give 
vent to their complaints in words&#59; many thus arraign 
the justice and mercy of Him before whom there is

no perversion nor deceipt. And see you not&#44; that the 
next step to such complaining may be an apostacy to 
the way of the sinner&#63; may not boastful&#44; self&#8211;sufficient 
piety&#44; degenerate into open rebellion &#63; And has not 
this&#44; alas&#33; been the case with many an Israelite&#44; who&#44; 
seeing the nations prosperous and at peace&#44; whilst his 
own brotliers are wanderers and oppressed&#44; burst the 
chains which bound him to the yoke of the Lord&#44; be&#8211; 
cause he felt not the full force of the cause of tribula&#8211; 
tion&#44; of the purifying effects of sorrow and humble&#8211; 
ness upon the rightly thinking mind&#63; And suppose 
even that the piety of the complaining should be too 
deeply seated to be moved by his envy and discon&#8211; 
tent&#58; still he will not be equal to the task of bearing 
becomingly the lot which the highest of all wisdom 
and justice may assign him&#59; life will be rendered 
miserable&#44; and his end&#44; notwithstanding his good 
deeds&#44; will not be the death of the righteous who 
have learned betimes&#44; and practised wdiat they have 
learned&#44; to regard God not alone as merciful and 
great&#44; bnt as just and impartial in all He dispenseth&#44; 
ISTow turn we to the scornful unbeliever&#44; who es&#8211; 
teems his own will and wi.&#39;&#59;dom as paramount to all&#44; 
who looks not to the word of God for his guide 
through life. ITow doe&#58;&#44; he regard the workings of 
Providence&#63; lie sees in them nothing to admire&#44; 
nothing to dread. He knovrs&#44; at least he cannot help 
knowing&#44; that he is mortal and corruptible&#44; &#8212; the 
child of disease&#44; of sorrow. But what is that to him &#63;

annihilation which he professes to expect&#44; which he 
nevertheless dreads. His spirit&#44; his soul&#44; the better 
part of himself&#44; is in the meanwhile in total darkness&#58; 
he will not listen&#44; he will not know. He is irrespon&#8211; 
sible&#44; so he fancies&#59; and if the thought of a Deity pre&#8211; 
sents itself&#44; he denies his providence&#44; alleging that 
One so exalted will not regard the deeds of one so 
humble as himself. But is this idea the offspring of 
humility or of pride&#63; Evidently of the latter&#59; for if 
he were humble&#44; and not elated at the consciousness 
of his dignity&#44; wisdom&#44; and importance&#44; he would 
forego the inspiration of his own wild notions of 
things&#44; and submit to be taught by the recorded will 
of his God. Yet speak to him of an Avenger of the 
covenant&#44; and he will ridicule the weakness which 
would ascribe to the purest Spirit the malignity of 
human passion&#44; forgetting&#44; all the while&#44; that it is not 
so much our gracious Father who punishes&#44; as the 
justice which pervades everything that demands ret&#8211; 
ribution&#44; for light given and for grace wilfully re&#8211; 
jected. He therefore lives as though there were no 
eternity&#59; he fancies there is nothing beyond nmterial 
life&#44; and nothing more to be prized than the enjoy&#8211; 
ment of material things whilst this liic endures. Thus 
his days pass away in idle pursuits&#44; in vaiiities which 
leave no fruit behind. And when evil befalls him&#44; 
he curses the fate which he believes unavoidable&#44; and 
thinks not of prayer&#44; of grace&#44; and divine aid. And 
when the sands of life run low&#44; he glories&#44; perhaps&#44; in 
having so long braved the anger of the Most High 
with impunity&#44; and that despite of his blaspheniy he 
has lived to a&#39;high oVd age&#44;iii tlie enjoyment of many

death&#44; still denying his accountabiUty&#44; and now he be&#8211; 
lieves that annihilation will close on the scene for ever. 

But there will be an awakening&#44; an awakening of 

horror and anguish&#58; the sinner has indeed passed 
away&#44; but the Avenger&#44; the Judge is ready to mete 
out retribution&#33; O now it is too late&#33; the agonized 
soul shrinks abashed&#44; overwhelmed before the Al&#8211; 
mighty&#39;s awful throne&#44; her sins unconfessed&#44; her trans&#8211; 
gressiojis unatoncd&#33; And gladly would she now re&#8211; 
turn to life to obey the precepts which were once 
contemned&#44; to seek the light which was formerly 
shunned&#44; to accept the grace which was but lately 
rejected. No lying evasions will now avail&#44; and the 
hiding of the light&#44; perhaps for ever&#44; the denial of 
grace for enduring years&#44; the rejection from favour 
till all the sins are expiated&#44; wall be the doom. Still 
even then in mercy will existence be vouchsafed&#44; for 
even to the wicked their death will not be final&#59; and 
though &#34;their worm will not die&#44; nor their fire be 
quendied&#44;&#34; they will yet have the grace given them 
to endure the punishment to which they are con&#8211; 
demned&#44; and be a memorial of the difterence be&#8211; 
tween those who served the Lord and those who 
sought not his worship. 

No&#44; brethren&#44; neither the overweening pride of re&#8211; 
ligious hope&#44; nor its opposite&#44; religious forgetfulness&#44; 
can tranquillize the spirit&#59; nor can that stoical in&#8211; 
diftcrcnce be approved of&#44; which can look unmoved

but we are only not permitted to murmur&#59; and he 
who smiles when a friend is carried to the grave&#44; who 
drops not a tear as the remains of the precious dead 
are laid low in their narrow dwelling&#44; is equally far 
from the true point of religious resignation&#44; as he who 
murmurs and complains&#44; as though a wrong had been 
done to his person and the merits he lias claims for 
upon Providence. True religion is meek and hope&#8211; 
ful &#59; it feels the chastisement of the Lord&#44; yet bows 
with resignation&#59; it endeavours to learn lessons of 
humility&#44; and strives to profit by the warning which 
is discoverable in the visitation&#44; whilst deeply in the 
bosom rankles the arrow which has been sent to 
wound&#44; only to be a call to amendment&#44; and a sum&#8211; 
mons to return from the path of error which prosperity 
and peace may&#44; perad venture&#44; have opened to us. And 
thus says the wisest of men &#40;Prov. iii. 11&#44; 12&#41;&#58; 

&#34; My son I despise not the chastening of the Lord &#59; neither be 
weary of his correction &#59; for whom the Lord loveth lie corrccteth&#44; 
even as a father the son in whom ho dcliglitelh.&#34; 

Indeed the Providence&#44; whom we adore&#44; watches 
over us with paternal solicitude&#44; and not the slightest 
occurrence reaches us&#44; be it good or evil&#44; but has been 
dispensed from Ilim. We are his children&#44; lie our 
Father&#59; not in anger but in love are his visitations&#59; 
and even as our Father is everlasting&#44; so is his mercy&#59; 
and thus are his children always under his care&#44; be 
they here in this mutable life&#44; or in yonder existence 
where there is no chano&#8211;e nor sorrow.

Considerations like tliese should ever be before our 
eyes&#44; whenever the current of life does not run along 
in one undisturbed cahn surface. And how seldom 
is this &#33; every day almost brings with it some care&#44; 
some grief to remind us of our mortality&#44; to convince 
us that we are but a shadow that passeth away. Na&#8211; 
tions and communities&#44; no less than individuals&#44; are 
liable to these warnings&#59; for death is constantly busy 
to snatch away those prominent for virtue and use&#8211; 
fulness&#44; after their task is done&#44; and to bear them off 
to the silent tomb. Is it&#44; then&#44; proper&#44; that such an 
event should occur without our attention being arrest&#8211; 
ed&#63; without the chastisement being felt&#63; ISTo&#44; this were 
not wise&#59; this would not be the part of children of 
grace&#44; as are the people Israel&#44; who have so long been 
taught to know that their Redeemer indeed liveth&#44; 
and that they are his creatures&#44; and to Him account&#8211; 
able. Let us&#44; then&#44; pause awhile on the bereavement 
which this congregation so lately experienced in the 
death of its president.&#42; It is not my purpose now to 
pass a splendid eulogium upon the departed &#59; for it 
becomes not a mortal when he acknowledges his 
nothingness&#44; to glorify another mortal. But this 
much we may be permitted to say&#44; that our late presi&#8211; 
dent was a sincere believer in the tenets of our faith&#44; 
and devotedly attached to its principles. Of late 
years&#44; especially&#44; he had given proof that he felt the 
solemn obligation of surrendering his interests to the 
calls of his religion&#59; and every measure proposed&#44; 
which promised to promote piety&#44; met with his hearty

approval and co&#8211;operation. We will not advert to 
his private relation in the bosom of his family circle&#58; 
enough that he was there beloved&#44; and respected 
abroad. When he erred&#44; we may freely assert&#44; that 
it was never from bad intentions&#44; such was the kindli&#8211; 
ness of disposition which he evinced on all occasions. 
&#8212; Only lately he was active among the living&#44; antici&#8211; 
p&#41;ating a happy succession of years. Yet this antici&#8211; 
pation&#44; as if in mockery of human calculation&#44; was 
sadly frustrated&#59; and after a few brief days of illness 
he sunk calmly&#44; imperceptibly almost&#44; into the em&#8211; 
brace of his Maker&#44; surrounded in his last moments 
by many friends and dear relatives&#44; who all felt that 
a valuable man had been taken away from among us. 
You were witnesses how numbers flocked together to 
pay the last honours to his mcmory&#44; and how uni&#8211; 
versal a burst of sympathy was expressed for those 
Avhom he left to mourn over their bereavement. Does 
it need any farther proof to attest his worth&#63; &#8212; Only 
one thing remains now for me to do&#58; it is to admon&#8211; 
ish you all not to neglect the correction which you 
have all received in this sad admonition. Are yonr 
lives secure against the approach of death &#63; are you 
prepared to meet the change that is impending&#63; Pre&#8211; 
pare yourselves&#44; then&#44; betimes&#44; whilst yet the sun is 
high above the horizon&#44; for know that his setting is 
last approaching. O &#33; vow it here&#44; here in the house 
of our God&#44; to be true and faithful&#44; faithful to the end&#44; 
that you may be accepted when your spirit is required 
back&#44; let the summons come when it may. Tarry 
not&#44; delay not&#44; men of Israel &#33; but resolve at once 
to show your regard for the deceased&#44; whom you wish 
to lionour&#44; and your love for God&#39;s word&#44; which you

should obey&#44; that you feel the warning that has been 
addressed yon in its full force. Believe me&#44; there is 
sin among us&#44; &#8212; let us not deceive ourselves in regard 
to our righteousness&#59; and let the evil be removed&#44; 
whilst the grace is yet given us to amend. By this 
means we shall indeed be chastened and made better&#59; 
more peace and more light will dwell among us&#59; and 
when in after years we call to mind the memory of 
the departed&#44; let us hope that we may be able to say&#44; 
that many who before were indifferent&#44; have through 
his decease been awakened to reflection&#44; and been 
thus made children of salvation through obedience to 
the law. Then&#44; indeed&#44; will his spirit rejoice over 
the good which has been wrought&#44; and he will rest 
in peace&#44; whilst we all shall be participants of the 
blessings which are destined for the righteous. 

O Thou&#44; our Father and God &#33; how great and won&#8211; 
derful art Thou. Low before Thee every creature 
bends&#59; powerless and weak are the mightiest men. &#8212; 
Do Thou&#44; O Lord &#33; send the spirit of thy consolation 
unto those who mourn&#44; and cause them to understand 
that it is Thou who afilictest them in mercy. Make 
even for ns the path of life&#44; and when our end has 
come&#44; 0&#44; then&#44; render for us easy the pangs of death&#44;

Thee a people and a peculiar treasure. From bond&#8211;

wonders&#59; and at a time when thy service was un&#8211;

Brethren&#33; 

In our intercourse with the gentiles around us&#44; it 
is of frequent occurrence that we hear them speak 
after this manner&#58; &#34; We believe that once you were 
the chosen people of God&#44; and that through you and 
the prophets who arose from among you&#44; there came 
salvation to mankind&#59; but this state of blessedness 
is now no longer yours&#59; you have been rejected for 
your rebellion&#44; and your long captivity proves that 
you are no longer the chosen people&#59; you are there&#8211; 
fore in darkness in your perseverance to abide by the 
Mosaic dispensation&#44; which has been set aside for one 
purer&#44; more spiritual&#44; more in consonance with divine 
mercy.&#34; An uninformed&#44; disinterested stranger&#44; to 
whom both the Nazarene creed and our belief should 
be utterly unknown&#44; hearing the above stated posi&#8211;

majority of our neighbours&#44; would hardly hesitate to

give us wrong for our opposition&#44; unless we could 
give convincing counter&#8211;arguments to the assertion 
offered as an undoubted fact&#44; and admitting of no 
contradiction. Indeed the Nazarenes treat the ques&#8211; 
tion as a settled point&#44; and in their arguments with 
us express the utmost astonishment that we can even 
dare to hesitate acknowledging our errors and the 
weakness of our hopes&#44; as they arrogantly affect to 
call our firm adherence to the One God&#44; and our un&#8211; 
shaken confidence in the fulfilment of his promises. 
If denunciation be proof&#44; and assertion sound argu&#8211; 
ment&#44; then indeed are we conquered &#59; but if Scrip&#8211; 
tures are to be appealed to&#44; if history is to be con&#8211; 
sulted&#44; then can we triumphantly defend our cause&#44; 
and convince even the stranger who has never heard 
of the word of our God&#44; and the doctrines which 
some preach erroneously in his blessed Name&#44; that 
we have the better reason on our side. 

Let us take a brief view of the different parts of 
the idea above thrown out&#44; which&#44; permit me to re&#8211; 
mark&#44; contains the essence of all that is ever brought 
forward to convince the Jew of his alleged error &#59; and 
if it fail of enforcing conviction&#44; the whole argument 
of the Nazarenes at once falls to the ground&#44; as far 
at least as the Israelite is concerned. I will also state 
once for all that the discussion is not entered into&#44; be&#8211; 
cause I deem that our adults require such aid as it is 
in my power to afford&#44; but to give them means under 
the blessing of our supreme Father to inculcate the 
same faith they have received in the minds of their 
children&#44; and to place the hopes of these on so firm 
a footing&#44; that they cannot be shaken by the specious 
arguments of the gentiles&#44; or be misled by the per&#8211;

nicious examples of those who forsake our commu&#8211; 
nion from an alleged conviction of the truth of an&#8211; 
other belief&#44; or from a criminal indifference to the 
word and will of the Lord&#44; 

To commence &#58; It is fortunate for the world no less 
than for Israel&#44; that all believers in a divine revela&#8211; 
tion&#44; of whatever sector creed&#44; admit as a prerequisite 
the divine legation of the father of the prophets&#44; and 
that he was deputed to deliver his fellow&#8211;Israelites 
from bondage &#59; for the admission of these facts places 
us at once on a firm rock&#44; from which we may start 
in commencing to trace to their source the nature 
and effect of the Law of God. For if Moses was di&#8211; 
vinely inspired to go forward to demand of Pharaoh 
the liberation of a captive people&#44; and if he was arm&#8211; 
ed by supernatural terrors to effect this noble pur&#8211; 
pose &#58; it follows that he was faithful and upright&#44; and 
that whatever he effected in the process of this mis&#8211; 
sion must bear the stamp of divine approbation&#44; or 
else he would have at the same time been a messen&#8211; 
ger of God&#44; and displeasing to this great Being by 
his non&#8211;conformity to the will of his Sender. Sec&#8211; 
ondly&#44; seeing that this mission was in behalf of a cer&#8211; 
tain people&#44; and for no other&#44; so far as our knowledge 
extends&#44; we are naturally led to inquire&#44; &#34; Why was 
this so &#63; Was it merely to humble the tyrant of 
Egypt&#44; to assert the cause of universal liberty and 
equality&#44; or had the whole proceeding another and a 
deeper motive&#63;&#34; If the former&#44; then there were in 
olden days&#44; and there are in our own times&#44; commu&#8211; 
nities of slaves equally oppressed as were our fore&#8211; 
fathers&#44; and&#44; being children of one great Father&#44; 
ought to be no less the objects of Providence and

Justice than were the Israelites in Egypt&#59; and if 
even there be no tyrant to doom to death the off&#8211; 
spring of the slavish race&#58; there are a thousand 
chains&#44; a thousand heartburnings&#44; a thousand suffer&#8211; 
ings connected with a state of absolute servitude&#44; 
which will not allow the All&#8211;Seeing to pass them by 
unnoticed. And yet&#44; the Israelites alone of all slave 
nations were redeemed by divine interposition. The 
answer therefore to our question is evident&#44; that the 
action of God&#44; through his servant Moses&#44; had for its 
object another and a higher view than the mere break&#8211; 
ing of physical fetters&#59; and this was&#44; as we have as&#8211; 
serted on a previous occasion&#44; the disenthralling of 
the mind of men from the bonds of superstition and 
unbelief&#44; and to fix a law of truth and righteousness 
immovably in the hearts of sinning mortals&#44; which 
law should never thenceforward be banished from 
the memory and the affections of its first possessors&#44; 
and that through their silent teachings&#44; as a great 
spirit&#42; of our people calls it&#44; by their presence on 
earth as the witnesses of God&#39;s truth&#44; they should 
proclaim the verities&#44; faith and righteousness in their 
hands to the utmost ends of the earth. We have be&#8211; 
fore this&#8224; proved that this procedure. on the part of 
God was both wise and necessary&#59; and all we have 
now to do&#44; is merely to start from this point as estab&#8211; 
lished in the farther pursuit of our inquiry. 

What now constitutes the existence of a nation &#63;

or at least an association of goverments obeying one 
common head. Another may answer&#44; to constitute a 
nation&#44; the individuals must be descended from one 
common origin&#44; and have a uniformity of language 
and customs. To a certain extent these definitions 
are correct&#59; and if peradventure any of these charac&#8211; 
teristics should be wanting at the first formation of a 
commonwealth&#44; the progress of time and the changes 
attendant on a propinquity of races&#44; will in an incred&#8211; 
ibly short period assimilate the different parts of a 
state in features&#44; manners&#44; and habits &#40;unless there 
be disturbing causes&#44; arising from climate&#44; and an 
entire diversity of pursuits&#41;&#44; which will render those 
persons who united to form a state&#44; though very di&#8211; 
verse themselves&#44; the parents of a uniform and homo&#8211; 
geneous race of descendants. It is needless to quote 
examples&#44; since the inquiry pursued in its ramifica&#8211; 
tions would carry us too far from our subject. If&#44; 
then&#44; these points were the sole requisites to form a 
nation&#44; the words spoken by the Lord through Jere&#8211; 
miah would not have been fulfilled. For thus we 
read &#40;Jer. xlvi. 27&#44; 28&#41;&#58; 

&#34; But thou &#8212; O do not feur&#44; my servant Jacob &#33; and be not dis&#8211; 
mayed&#44; O Israel&#33; for behold&#44; I will surely save thee from afar off&#44;

and thy seed from the land of their captivity &#59; and Jacob shall re&#8211; 
turn&#44; and shall rest&#44; and shall be at case&#44; and none shall make him 
afraid. Thou &#8212; do thou not fear&#44; my servant Jacob &#33; saith the Lord&#44; 
for I am with thee &#59; for I will make a full end of all the nations 
whither I have driven thee&#44; but of thee I will not make a full end &#59; 
I will correct thee in judgment&#44; yet not suffer thee to go entirely 
unpunished &#34;&#42; 

We are here told that the Lord would not make an 
end of the nationality of His servant Jacob. But 
where now is his governmennt &#63; his country&#63; his asso&#8211; 
ciation of sovereignties&#63; his common head&#63; Where&#63; 
&#8212; O they have been &#33; but now &#8212; his children are scat&#8211; 
tered over every land&#44; wanderers in every clime &#8212; op&#8211; 
pressed by some&#44; despised by many&#44; and loved by 
none &#59; and they obey laws which their wise men and 
their ancients do not recognize as those laws and 
those ordinances founded on the law of Moses. Their 
country is desolate and possessed by aliens to their 
blood&#44; and their kings have long since ceased to rule&#44; 
and their judges have for ages not sat in the seat of 
judgment. But who will say&#44; notwithstanding this&#44; 
that Jacob&#39;s sons are not a nation &#63; They are still a 
people&#44; all must confess&#44; not because in the possession 
of a common country and one government&#44; but by 
the possession of one common origin&#44; by the owner&#8211; 
ship of one law&#44; by the acknowledged providence and 
rule of One&#44; sole&#44; universal God. And if you look 
for and meet the descendant of Israel in the icy re&#8211;

earth &#8212; he will tell you that he is linked in spirit and 
descent to that hapless nation who have so long borne 
the obloquy&#44; and the contempt&#44; and the galling yoke 
which the ignorance and malevolence of gentiles 
have inflicted on them. And ask him&#44; why he so sub&#8211; 
mits to these national evils&#63; he will tell you&#44; it is be&#8211; 
cause he confides in the truth of his God&#44; because he 
does not believe that the All&#8211;wise could waver in his 
counsel and enact a new law&#44; when He had declared 
the ordinances of Moses to be the statutes which He 
had ordained for the perpetual government of his 
chosen people. In this then exists our nationality&#44; in 
the possession of one religion&#44; uniform in its main 
features all over the world&#44; and in our cherishing the 
consanguinity inherent to our descent from the Pa&#8211; 
triarchs&#44; and inasmuch as we are sedulous to contract 
matrimonial alliances with those only who are&#44; like 
us&#44; obedient to the same religious code&#44; and descended 
from the same common stock. If&#44; then&#44; it is admit&#8211; 
ted that we were at one time&#44; however remote&#44; the 
chosen people of God&#44; it is also admitted that we 
thereby&#44; that is to say&#44; by our being chosen as a di&#8211; 
vine people&#44; were constituted the guardians of a divine 
law &#59; for this alone&#44; as we have briefly exhibited&#44; could 
have been the meaning of the prophecy which we have 
quoted for our text&#59; since&#44; when Jeremiah prophesied 
these words&#44; he also foretold the downfall of our na&#8211; 
tional government&#44; and his promise of the permanence 
of the nation could accordingly refer only to spiritual 
advantages which were to endure when &#8212; and long&#44; 
long after&#44; all the physical or outward features of a 
state had been entirely obliterated. In other words&#44; 
the Israelites were constituted a nation to continue

THE HOPE OF ISRAEL. 115 

thus through a state of political exaltation&#44; and 
through seasons of entire political subversion. 

In truth the Nazarenes confess this to be the fact&#44; 
by saying that salvation came through Israel&#44; by which 
they can only mean&#44; that through the promulgation 
of the law to our ancestors&#44; in the first instance&#44; the 
knowledge of the way of salvation was at length 
carried to the gentiles&#44; who are now enjoying the 
light of religion which was formerly exclusively ours. 
Without gainsaying in the least the truth of this as&#8211; 
sertion&#44; since we are not disposed to deny to any 
human being the hope of salvation in the Lord&#44; by 
the pursuit of the right so far as this is known to him &#58; 
we cannot assent to the deduction&#44; which the gentiles 
make&#44; that their admission to grace has caused our 
rejection. First&#44; because the gentiles never were ex&#8211; 
cluded from divine mercy&#44; from the calling of Abra&#8211; 
ham down to this hour. Many no doubt forfeited 
everlasting bliss by their manifold transgressions 
against the light they had received&#44; and in contraven&#8211; 
tion to the truths which had been made known to 
mankind from the beginning&#59; but this does not say 
that there was any inherent defect in the spirit of the 
gentile from enjoying the rewards to which his virtues&#44; 
be they many or few&#44; might have entitled him from 
the impartial Judge of all flesh. The law&#44; we admit&#44; 
was given to be the road of salvation to Israel&#44; in the 
first instance&#44; and to become the beacon to the other 
nations of the earth thereafter&#59; but it was intended 
solely to bind our people to the strict observance of 
its letter and spirit&#44; and not to condemn to eternal 
sorrows those who had never been informed of its 
nature and tenets. The Lord o&#8211;ave his command&#8211;

ments to be obeyed to everlasting&#44; to remove through 
them&#44; by certain though slow degrees&#44; the empire of 
sin and evil&#59; yet He never doomed to destruction 
those who&#44; by a long course of misrule and accumu&#8211; 
lated ignorance for which they were nowise to blame&#44; 
had not learned to fear his great and adorable Name. 
Secondly&#44; even granting&#44; for argument&#39;s sake&#44; that 
until a certain fixed period the gentiles had been ex&#8211; 
cluded from God&#39;s mercy&#44; which we cannot admit&#58; 
still we are constrained to affirm&#44; that their admission 
to favour can on no account have wrought our ex&#8211; 
pulsion from the mansion of our Father&#33; Is not his 
power far&#8211;reaching enough to extend over each and 
all of his creatures&#63; Is his goodness limited&#44; that it 
needs must be exhausted unless some are doomed to 
unhappiness&#63; Is his wisdom so short&#8211;sighted&#44; that 
his laws are insufficient to speak to every soul &#8212; to 
subdue every heart to fear and to love Him&#63; &#8212; Not so 
are we permitted to set limits to his bounty and be&#8211; 
nevolence&#59; and if man can occasionally forgive his 
enemies and pray for those who have grievously 
transgressed against him &#58; will you deny to the All&#8211; 
good&#44; the Possessor of all perfection&#44; the power&#44; the 
capacity&#44; the disposition&#44; the will to be good to all&#63; 
Is this your conception of your Maker&#39;s greatness&#44; 
that you give Him less perfection than is possessed by 
a mortal creature &#63; &#8212; No &#33; no &#33; brethren &#59; God&#39;s love 
is ample for all&#59; his wings are sufficiently extended 
that all may seek shelter under their shadow&#59; his 
forgiveness is not exhausted if even every creature 
were forgiven and enjoying everlasting happiness&#59; 
and whilst we believe this&#44; we cannot imagine&#44; much 
less believe&#44; that the acceptance into favour of the

gentiles has wrought injury to the children of the 
house of Israel. 

&#34;But&#44;&#34; say the advocates of our rejection&#44; &#34;it is 
not because God is not able to save&#44; only because you 
refused and still refuse the salvation which was offered 
to you. The thirsty man cannot complain of the 
effect of water not slaking his thirst&#44; if he refuses to 
drink.&#34; Let us now inquire&#44; What have we rejected &#63; 
Have we rejected the law &#63; Do we as a people refuse 
studying or obeying the commandments&#63; &#8212; Assuredly 
not &#63; with faces covered with the blush of shame we 
must indeed confess that we have sinned as our fathers 
have done before us &#59; but never can it be said&#44; that we 
as an entire body have rejected the law. If then our 
transgressions during the ages of the prophets were 
punished with mild though condign punishment &#40;for 
everything is mild compared to entire annihilation&#41;&#44; 
as a retributive measure for the infraction of the cove&#8211; 
nant of God with Israel &#58; it is wonderful indeed that 
anything could have occurred more heinous&#44; more 
subversive of our duties as a people and individuals&#44; 
than the general idolatry at one time so prevalent for 
a space of several centuries. Now we read in the 
awful denunciation of Moses in the twenty&#8211;sixth chap&#8211; 
ter of Leviticus&#44; that the spirit of prophecy anticipated 
such a state of rebellion&#59; for he says &#40;verse 30&#41;&#58; &#34;And 
I will destroy your high places&#44; and cut down your 
sun&#8211;images&#44; and cast your carcasses upon the car&#8211; 
casses of your idols&#44; and my soul shall abhor you &#59;&#34; 
thus evidently indicating that the direful rebellion of 
forgetfulness of God should be followed by the signal 
punishment of the sinners and the downfall of the idols 
they would worship&#44; and God is represented as say&#8211; 

<pb n="118"/>

118 THE HOPE OF ISRAEL. 

ing that his soul would abhor the daring rebels. Now 
hear what the prophet says in continuation &#40;verses 
43&#8211;45&#41;&#58; &#34; The land also shall be left &#40;desolate&#41; of thera&#44; 
and shall enjoy her Sabbaths&#44; while she lies desolate 
without them&#44; and they shall accept of the punish&#8211; 
ment of their iniquity&#59; because&#44; even because they 
despised my judgments&#44; and my statutes their souls 
abhorred. And yet for all that&#44; when they are in the 
land of their enemies&#44; I will not cast them away&#44; 
neither will I abhor them&#44; to destroy them utterly&#44; 
and to break my covenant with them&#59; for I am the 
Lord their God. But I will remember unto them the 
covenant of their ancestors&#44; whom I brought forth 
from the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations&#44; 
that I might be their God &#58; I am the Lord.&#34; The 
sin&#44; the punishment&#44; and the mercy are all here re&#8211; 
cited&#59; and still the promise of an everlasting covenant 
is held out. And for what was the punishment de&#8211; 
nounced&#63; For a disregard of the statutes and judg&#8211; 
ments of the law&#44; which would imply&#44; that there will 
follow favour and mercy if the Israelites were to obey 
these statutes and judgments. Not to speak of the 
blissful promise that our greatest sinning should not 
cause utter rejection &#58; we will confine ourselves to the 
consideration of the unjewish doctrine that obedience 
to the law should not be able to insure salvation&#44; un&#8211; 
less something else were to be superadded. Let us 
inquire of our opponents what that something is&#63; 
They will&#44; as you all know&#44; tell us&#44; it is the belief in 
a mediator&#44; who is to atone for our sins&#59; since no man 
is righteous under the law&#44; and he requires a purifica&#8211; 
tion and a sacrificing process beyond what his own 
deeds can attain&#59; and since we in former times re&#8211; 

<pb n="119"/>

THE HOPE OF ISRAEL. 119 

jectcd the mediator&#44; when he &#39;us said to have appeared&#44; 
and as professing Jews yet continue to reject him&#44; 
they will make us believe that we are by this unbelief 
condemned to the abhorrence of the Lord&#44; even to 
utter spiritual condemnation&#44; both nationally and in&#8211; 
dividually. Before wo go to argue the question upon 
its remote merits&#44; such as consistency with divine 
goodness and mercy&#44; we will bring it down to the 
standard of Scripture&#59; and we will ask&#44; with all due 
deference to the many learned and pious professing 
Nazarenes&#44; to point out to us a single passage in the 
wliole five books of Moses which even remotely 
teaches the doctrine of a mediator&#44; or which hints 
that any other atonement is needed than a man&#39;s own 
acts&#44; done in obedience to and in reliance upon divine 
wisdom and mercy. It will not do to assert that this 
doctrine is taught by inference and obscure allusions &#59; 
for in a matter concerning our final beatitude or con&#8211; 
demnation&#44; the merciful Father of all creatures would 
not leave doubt or obscurity to perplex us in our 
course through life. We have plain and ample di&#8211; 
rections for our belief in one God&#44; the Author and 
Preserver of all things&#59; we have express injunction 
regarding our own course of life as children of God&#44; 
as descendants from human parentage&#44; and as mem&#8211; 
bers of a community of intelligent beings like our&#8211; 
selves&#44; nay&#44; in many instances regarding our conduct 
towards the brute creation &#59; and is it to be believed 
that&#44; if our salvation depended upon a belief in a me&#8211; 
diator&#44;&#39;this idea would not have been clearly and dis&#8211; 
tinctly laid down in the ten commandments along 
with the injunction to acknowledge the Creator &#63; &#8212; 
Moreover&#44; What Israelite&#44; from the mission of Moses

to the destruction of the second temple&#44; ever believed 
in an adjunct deity&#63; and&#44; consequently&#44; if such a be&#8211; 
lief were necessary to salvation&#44; no one of all the 
Bible personages could have been saved&#44; no matter 
what might have been his piety or the favour with 
which he was regarded by his Maker. &#8212; But what does 
this hypothesis mean&#63; Nothing else than that the 
Lord had given a law which&#44; while in appearance it 
was a means of salvation&#44; failed in its effect &#59; since 
there was another requisite which it does not enjoin&#44; 
yet without which all obedience to it is in vain. Is 
this reasonable&#63; can the Lord be so unjust&#44; so cruel 
towards those He alleges to love &#63; Moreover&#44; this 
view would be disconsonant with Scriptures&#59; since in 
many passages we read to the following effect&#44; &#34;Ye 
shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments&#44; 
which if a man do&#44; he shall live in them &#58; I am the 
Lord.&#34; &#40;Lev. xviii. 5.&#41; &#34;And when Moses had made 
an end of speaking all these words to all Israel&#44; he 
said unto them&#44; Set your hearts unto all the words 
which I testify among you this day&#44; that you may 
command them your children to observe to do all the 
words of this law. For it is not a vain thing for you&#44; 
because it is your life &#59; and through this thing ye shall 
prolong your days in the land&#44; whither ye go over 
Jordan to possess it.&#34; &#40;Deut. xxxii. 45&#8211;47.&#41; &#34;With 
these extracts the proofs arc not exhausted &#59; but 
enough for the present to establish the biblical doc&#8211; 
trine that no mediator is required to obtain for us 
salvation &#59; on the contrary&#44; we are taught that the law&#44; 
which is to insure our life&#44; is neither in heaven n.or 
beyond sea&#44; so that a mediator or messenger need be 
sent to fetch it&#44; but is in our mouths and our hearts. 

<pb n="121"/>

that we may do it. We repeat therefore the question&#44; 
How can the Jews have been rejected from divine 
grace&#44; so that whilst adhering firmly to the law which 
was intrusted to them&#44; they should earn eternal con&#8211; 
demnation&#44; simply because they do not admit a doc&#8211; 
trine which their Scriptures do not contain&#63; 

In this point of the argument&#44; it is possible we may 
be met by the bold assertion of our antagonists &#40;I use 
this word as referring only to a mere friendly differ&#8211; 
ence&#41;&#44; that granting the old dispensation of the law &#8212; 
so they term our code &#8212; did not contain the doctrine 
of a sacrificed mediator&#44; a new and purer revelation&#44; 
which unfettered the world from the curse of bodily 
obedience&#44; made known a safer and easier method of 
sanctification&#44; by teaching the sinner not to regard 
himself or his deeds as of any avail&#44; but to throw 
himself upon the merits of one who had assumed both 
the curse of the condemnation under the law&#44; pro&#8211; 
nounced against Adam&#44; and removed the disqualifica&#8211; 
tion attendant thereon by his voluntary death in ex&#8211; 
piation of original sin. &#8212; I state the substance of the 
doctrine in its strongest bearings. Indeed&#44; if this 
view were scriptural&#44; then might Israel tremble&#59; for 
by having rejected both the person and the assistance 
of the alleged great personage whom the Nazarenes 
call their messiah&#44; or mediator&#44; or by what other 
name he may be known&#44; they would of necessity have 
rejected the only means of salvation. But&#44; brethren&#44; 
there is&#44; there can be no dispensation from the Lord 
differing in aught&#44; even one iota or one tittle&#44; from 
the law of Moses &#33; For what is God &#63; is He a son of 
man&#44; that He should repent&#63; can He be uncertain in his 
purposes &#63; wavering in his will &#63; Did He give a law to

tion to less than two thousand years&#44; when a thou&#8211; 
sand years are in his sight like a yesterday that pass&#8211; 
eth and a watch in the night&#63; Can this be the God 
who spoke thus through his servant&#58; &#34;And know 
therefore this day&#44; and reflect in thy heart&#44; that the 
Lord is the God in the heavens above and on the earth 
beneath &#59; there is none else &#34; &#40;Deut. iv. 39&#41; &#63; Ay&#44; 
&#34;THERE IS NONE ELSE&#33;&#34; these are the words&#44; 
the consolatory assurance of the Most High himself. 
What do they mean&#44; but that beside the Lord&#44; the God 
of Israel&#44; there is no being to share his power&#44; his 
glory&#44; his saving mercy &#63; Upon whom then does the 
lave bid us to rely for salvation &#63; The same Power 
who announced himself to Moses&#44; when the prophet 
asked by what name he was to call his Sender when 
speaking to the Israelites&#44; &#34;I shall be who I shall be.&#34; 
And again&#44; &#34;The everlasting One&#44; the God of Abra&#8211; 
ham thy father&#44; and the God of Isaac &#40;as was told 
to Israel when reposing in his prophetic vision&#41;&#44; and 
the God of Jacob&#44; hath sent me unto you &#58; this is my 
name for ever&#44; and this is my memorial unto all gen&#8211; 
erations.&#34; And how was this everlasting&#44; eternal Be&#8211; 
ing to be viewed &#63; Here again the Scriptures come 
to our aid &#58; &#34;Hear&#44; O Israel &#33; the Lord our God&#44; the 
Lord is one&#44;&#34; one&#44; sole&#44; omnipotent&#44; working all&#44; crea&#8211; 
ting all&#44; ruling all&#44; and saving all. Is there a possi&#8211; 
bility of an adjunct&#44; an associate&#44; an assistant&#44; a be&#8211; 
ing between God and man &#63; Again the law speaks 
in farther coniirmation&#44; when the prophet in his last 
song&#44; delivered probably on the day of his death&#44; fore&#8211; 
tells the fearful effects of the apostacy&#44; which his 
mind&#39;s eye foresaw and greatly dreaded&#59; he intro&#39;

duces the Deity as speaking&#44; denouncing punishment 
for rebellion&#44; and as then continuing&#58; &#34;See now&#44; 
that I&#44; I alone am He&#44; and there is no god with me&#59; 
I&#44; I kill and I bring to life&#44; I wound and I heal&#44; and 
there is no one can deliver from my hand. I lift up 
my hands to heaven&#44; and say. As sure as I live for 
ever.&#34; &#40;Deut. xxxii. 39&#44; 40.&#41; Do we need farther 
proof&#63; then let us once more refer to the unfailing 
guide we have always at hand&#58; &#34;And the Lord will 
scatter you among the peoples&#44; and you shall be left 
few in number among the nations whither the. Lord 
will lead you. &#8212; And if you will seek thence the Lord 
thy God&#44; thou wilt find Him&#44; if thou wilt seek Him 
with all thy heart and with all thy soul.&#34; &#40;Deut. iv. 
27&#44; 29.&#41; &#8212; All these concurrent texts&#44; scattered through 
the Pentateuch&#44; explain one the other&#44; and all reject 
as impossible the idea of a sacrifice beyond the person 
of the sinner himself&#58; &#34;I wound and I heal&#44; and there 
is no one can deliver from my hand&#59;&#34;&#39; where&#44; we 
would ask&#44; is an exception &#63; if the Lord&#44; the everlast&#8211; 
ing He condemns&#44; if He wounds&#44; who can absolve&#44; 
who can heal &#63; We are promised deliverance by re&#8211; 
turning from our evil ways&#59; yet whom shall we seek&#63; 
again&#44; &#34;the Lord our God&#44;&#34; who announces himself 
as &#34; One&#34; and &#34;living for ever.&#34; 

But&#44; say the Nazarenes&#44; &#34;Your law is but a type&#44; 
a foreshadowing of more glorious things that were to 
follow.&#34; Without at present discussing the truth or 
otherwise of this singular position&#44; we will merely 
confine ourselves to a single remark. Admitting&#8211; for 
a moment the impossible and not&#8211;to&#8211;be&#8211;thought&#8211;of 
idea&#44; that the unchanging God had communicated a 
law which in its nature was so imperfect that it re&#8211;

124 THE HOPE OF ISRAEL. 

quired to be changed &#58; it would still solely apply to 
ordinances to be done and prohibitions to be avoided&#59; 
for these only could by any chance be objects of re&#8211; 
peal or change. Yet how does this aftect the truths 
of revelation &#63; Can the Lord repeal his own un&#8211; 
changeableness &#63; can He cease to be one&#63; can He at 
one time be the sole Saviour&#44; and require au adjunct 
at another &#63; can He in the least divest himself of one&#44; 
nay&#44; the smallest prerogative of universal royalty in 
favour of another&#63; can&#44; in short&#44; the holy&#44; the ever&#8211; 
lasting&#44; uniform&#44; unchanging&#44; saving&#44; redeeming God 
cease to be less than this in any manner whatever&#63; 
A truth is an idea which cannot be controverted&#59; it 
embraces something which is so and not otherwise by 
any change of circumstance&#44; time&#44; or place. Kow if 
God at any one time&#44; either past or present&#44; nay&#44; even 
future&#44; embraced or should embrace any attribute 
whatever&#44; this same attribute must have been his 
from the commencement&#44; and cannot be changed to 
all eternity. We therefore demand the proof&#58; AVhere 
does the law teach us to pray through a mediator&#44; or 
rather does not the law strenaouslv prohibit any such 
system of idolatry &#63; No proof can be exhibited&#44; for 
there exists none&#44; that God meant to divest himself 
of a portion of his power&#44; admit it even as possible &#59; 
and whilst the law is silent&#44; we cannot believe that 
another revelation&#44; gainsaying it in so important a 
particular&#44; can be of divine origin. Consequently the 
fears they would influence us with&#44; who say that we 
are condemned&#44; because we rejected the person and 
mission of their mediator&#44; are idle and groundless&#59; 
for we are commanded over and again &#58; &#34;The Lord 
thy God shalt thou fear&#44; and Him shalt thou serve &#59; 

<pb n="125"/>

THE HOPE OP ISRAEL. 125 

to Him shalt thou cleave&#44; and by his name slialt thou 
swear&#33; &#34; Yes&#44; brethren &#33; to Him will we cleave&#59; come 
weal&#44; come woe &#8212; be the world friendly or frowning &#8212; 
be the name of Israel loved or hated &#8212; be Jacob&#39;s 
sous many or few &#8212; they who fear the Lord&#44; the One&#44; 
the Eternal&#44; the Undying&#44; the Unchanging&#44; will swear 
by his name&#44; and call Ilim their Father &#8212; their Friend 
&#8212; their Life &#8212; their Redeemer. 

A holier God than the God of Abraham&#44; of Isaac&#44; 
and of Jacob&#44; cannot be imagined&#59; a more evident 
revelation of his will than was proclaimed from Sinai 
never was witnessed &#59; and consequently a system more 
pure and holy than that embra&#40;&#59;ed in the Mosaic code 
cannot&#44; does not exist. Away then with the appeal 
so shamelessly addressed to us to forsake this code 
for any other&#44; say if you will&#44; it even be purer&#59; &#8212; 
away&#33; tempt us not with your wealth&#44; your power&#44; 
your matrimonial alliances with your great families &#58; 
they are unworthy of its light who forsake the law 
which is ours&#59; and only with its extinction can the 
lamp of Jacob be quenched. 

Again says the E&#39;azarene&#44; &#34; If it be as you say&#44; that 
there is but one God and one law given by this God&#44; 
how is it that you&#44; its followers&#44; are so scattered&#44; so 
long oppressed&#44; so long without priest or prophet&#44; tem&#8211; 
ple or sacrifice &#63; Is not your dispersion a positive 
proof of your rejection from grace&#63; Is it not more 
than likely that before many centuries have elapsed 
the names of Jacob and Israel will only belong to 
history as things that have been &#63;&#34; But we answer &#58; 
Had we never sinned&#44; then would dispersion never 
have been sent as a visitation over us&#59; but had we 
sinned and we been left flourishing and at peace in

our own land&#44; while we defiled it with onr abomina&#8211; 
tions &#58; then would the word of God not have been 
true. When we sinned&#44; it was absolutely requisite 
that punishment should be meted out&#44; and the pun&#8211; 
ishment threatened was the scattering of our race 
among the gentiles from one end of the earth to the 
other. The punishment has been literally accom&#8211; 
plished thus far &#58; yet withal it was told that in the 
land of our enemies the Lord&#39;s covenant would re&#8211; 
main steadfast and unmoved with us. Has this been 
so&#63; We appeal to history&#44; to the experience of every 
age and country&#44; to conlirni the wcll&#8211;foundedness of 
our trust and confidence. Have not ages of sorroAv&#44; 
of trial&#44; of temptation passed over us without con&#8211; 
suming us&#63; History answers&#44; Yes&#59; and shall we then 
become faint&#8211;hearted now&#44; when we are at peace&#63; 
Shall we despair after so many centuries of sorrow&#44; 
fearful to confide in the Lord&#39;s promises &#63; Manj&#8211; may 
perhaps be weary of bearing the name which marks 
them children of a hated&#44; crushed&#44; and despised peo&#8211; 
ple&#59; but there are many &#8212; millions compared to hun&#8211; 
dreds &#8212; who would embrace the burning stake&#44; who 
would welcome the blow of the bared sword&#44; sooner 
than swerve from the acknowledgment of the Unity 
of God which they have inherited from their fathers 
&#8212; sooner than forsake the law which was proclaimed 
from heaven by the omnipotent voice of the undying&#8211; 
God &#33; Lidifl&#58;crence to the commandments is not a 
new thing among us &#59; it is this which has twice ruined 
our temple&#44; twice scattered the dwellers of Palestine 
as slaves and outcasts over all the earth &#59; and yet 
every period of forgetfulness was followed by one of 
love for the law. Can it be otherwise now &#63; Will

not a better spirit awaken in the souls of our people&#44; 
when this age of worldliness has passed away&#63; As&#8211; 
suredly &#8212; if there be truth in the word of God &#8212; and 
if oven many or all of us pass aWay&#44; before this revi&#8211; 
val takes place&#44; take place it will&#44; and we never need 
to dread the extinction of a people which has so long&#44; 
so i&#39;aithfully&#44; so unshrinkingly been the witness of 
God&#39;s power&#44; mercy&#44; and providence. The prophets 
no longer speak among us&#59; but the prophetic treas&#8211; 
ures are not forgotten&#44; and if we have no priests nor 
temple&#44; then is the Lord our refuge&#44; our sanctuary&#44; 
and our atonement. This is the permanence of his 
word&#59; and when the appointed time arrives&#44; then 
will the restoration of all the blessings not be want&#8211; 
ing&#44; and then will be fullillod the words we have 
quoted for our text&#44; and which we will repeat as a lit 
conclusion for our to&#8211;day&#39;s contemplation &#58; &#34; But thou 
&#8212; do not fear&#44; my servant Jacob&#44; and be not dis&#8211; 
mayed&#44; Israel&#33; for behold&#44; I vv&#39;ill surely save thee 
from afar off&#44; and thy seed from the land of their 
captivity&#59; and Jacob shall return&#44; and shall rest&#44; and 
shall be at ease&#44; and none shall make him afraid. 
Thou &#8212; do thou not fear&#44; my servant Jacob&#44; saith the 
Lord&#44; for I am with thee&#59; for I will make a full end 
of all the nations whither I have driven thee&#44; but of 
tliec I will not make a full end&#58; I will correct thee 
in judgment&#44; yet not sufler thee to go entirely unpun&#8211; 
ished.&#39;&#39; 

O Lord God&#33; indeed we know that our reoellion 
has called down upon us thy wrath and indignation&#44; 
yet have we not forsaken entirely thy covenant&#59; and 
Thou&#44; our Father &#33; hast also done according to thy

promise&#44; and not broken with us the oath Thou hast 
sworn to our fathers. Let our prayers then ascend to 
Thee&#44; and bless the outcasts of Israel with thy grace 
and peace&#59; and let us here in thy house welcome 
many&#44; many years of reunion in heart and soul&#44; on 
the day when these doors were first opened to admit 
the worshippers of thy name at this shrine. And let 
none be ever wanting here to defend the truth Thou 
hast given us&#44; and may this endure until the captives 
shall return to Zion with songs of triumph and joy 
because of thy renewed goodness through thy servant 
David. Amen.

Lord of glory &#33; shine forth in thy majesty over thy

Brethren &#33; 

It is our boastful privilege to call ourselves sous of

THE ISRAELITISII NATION. 129 

Israel&#44; clcsc&#39;ciidants from tlie patriarchs&#59; we claim 
with uiRleiiiable justice to be the inheritors of a 
glorious name than wliich none more honourable 
Was ever borne by any individual or people. Ages 
have rolled on&#44; and still through good and through 
evil report there have always been found men and 
women who gloried in the name of Jacob&#44; who 
thanked with heartfelt gratitude the Lord of all&#44; that 
He had not made their portions like the families of 
the earth&#44; nor their lot like that of all their multitude. 
We bless the Lord daily in our prayers that He&#44; by 
his wise providence&#44; exempted us from the unfor&#8211; 
tunate state of idolatry and false belief&#44; by the be&#8211; 
stowal of his law&#44; the precepts of which are the 
emanation of his wisdom and goodness&#59; and we 
deem our lot a happy one&#44; when we cast our eyes 
around us or turn our view to history and find that&#44; 
whilst many nations have obtained a partial knowl&#8211; 
edge of the truth&#44; and others are yet groping in en&#8211; 
tire mental blindness&#44; we have alone a clear concep&#8211; 
tion of the highest wisdom which the greatest unaided 
human intellect has ever failed of atti&#8211;uning. We feel&#44; 
indeed&#44; that our law is from God&#44; and that we are his 
chosen instruments to preserve it unto the end of 
days. 

At a time&#44; when we lived together in one common 
country&#44; governed by the very law&#8211; which the Lord 
had given us&#44; our superiority over the other nations&#44; 
who were our neighbours all around us&#44; was maui&#8211; 
test enough at a first glance even &#59; nay this was the 
case at that very time when we were so foolishly bent 
upon imitating the follies of the gentiles &#59; for in every 
age there were found those unwavering heroes in the

faith of their forefathers who by their unswerving 
rectitude made the sinners ashamed&#44; and shook by 
their fervid ekjquence and their bold denunciation 
the throne of tyrants who unworthily filled the royal 
seat of David&#44; But now a change has for many 
years past come over the face of our national glory &#59; 
we have been taken from out of the bounds of our 
inheritance and carried away unto every clime of the 
earth&#44; and scattered in small numbers and unimport> 
ant communities into every land which would open 
its boundaries for our reception&#44; which did not dis&#8211; 
dain to let the fugitives from the once great Palestine 
rest awhile&#44; and to allow them to be refreshed from 
the great slaughter which the enemies of their name 
had wrought in the very precincts of their temple&#44; at 
the foot of the altar of their God. &#8212; And not alone 
this&#59; but the very people who have been healed 
through our bruises&#44; and who have been brought to 
the partial knowledge of the Lord by our suflerings&#44; 
now claim a superiority over us as being more in the 
pale of divine favour&#44; and brand our religion as the 
result of error and misapprehension of the law of 
God. If now we arc cowards in the cause which has 
been surrendered to our defence&#44; if we are faint&#8211; 
hearted in the service which our Master demands of 
us&#44; we will naturally become recreants to our trust&#44; 
an easy prey to the enemies of Israel. But in this 
trial of our strength and faith one thing is preemi&#8211; 
nently obligatory on us&#44; as a prerequisite to all else&#44; 
that is&#44; we are on no account to look upon ourselves 
as degraded for no better cause than that others say 
so&#59; we ourselves must not look upon the name of 
Jew&#44; Hebrew or Israelite as something to be ashamed

of&#44; for the best of all reasons&#44; &#8212; because there is ab&#8211; 
solutely nothing why we need to blush to be desig&#8211; 
nated by either or all of them. The odium which 
some attach to our present designation&#44; the title Jew&#44; 
is only a remnant of that barbarism which formerly 
doomed the possessors thereof to an ignominious death 
and to every contumely which malevolence could in&#8211; 
vent&#44; for no other reason than because they refused to 
embrace the opinions of the majority&#44; their inferiors 
in every thing save in the possession of political 
power&#44; with regard to religious opinions and observ&#8211; 
ances. What then made the word Jew a byword of 
reproach &#63; any thing intrinsically attached to it &#63; any 
crime or bodily or mental inferiority belonging to or 
chargeable upon its possessors&#63; Certainly not&#59; they&#44; 
who persecuted our people for no valid cause&#44; at last 
began or at least aiiected to despise them as inferior 
to the lordly and favoured race among whom they 
dwelt. Persecution thus produced scorn&#44; and scorn 
in its turn was then made the pretext for farther out&#8211; 
rage. Whom does this procedure stamp as infe&#8211; 
rior&#63; Those who&#44; from a relentless spirit of bigotry&#44; 
maltreated a people who never oftended&#44; and whose 
deplorable condition demanded the commiseration 
of every feeling heart&#44; &#8212; or those who&#44; despite of 
unmerited suficrings which&#44; from their magnitude 
seemed almost too much for human nature to bear&#44; 
adhered the closer to those truths and those laws from 
keeping which originated all their sulierings and sor&#8211; 
rows &#63; And say if you will that in process of time 
the long&#8211;endured contumely and abliorrence produced 
at length a degree of slavish cringing&#44; a certain spe&#8211; 
cies of double&#8211;dealing towards&#44; and an inward hatred

of&#44; the oppressors&#58; still can this be wondered at&#63; is 
this not the natural result of outrages against liuman 
rights&#63; do you expect that the wretch who writhes 
under the lash of your inflictions will turn round and 
kiss reverentially your bloodstained hand&#63; do you 
imagine that the wrongfully enchained patriot will 
love in his heart the cruel tyrant who dooms him to 
death for daring to uphold the rights of his countrj&#8211; &#63; 
or do yon believe that man will not cringe and sub&#8211; 
mit seemingly to your contempt when by such con&#8211; 
duct he may hope to escape from your cruelty&#44; which 
otherwise he is sure will reach his exposed head &#63; 
Even grant&#44; that a long state of degradation at last 
taught the Hebrew to disregard&#44; in some instances&#44; 
the laws of honesty and fair dealing&#44; so far as his per&#8211; 
secutors were concerned &#58; still&#44; can you wonder that 
this should be &#63; did not your rapacity teach him to 
remunerate himself for the unceasing rapine to which 
he was exposed &#63; how else could he supply the con&#8211; 
stant demand for contributions from your kings&#44; and 
priests&#44; and lords&#44; unless he had a hoard of gold at 
hand to satisfy their unquenchable cravings&#63; And 
then let us reflect that without exculpating ourselves 
or denying in aught the charges of this nature brought 
against us&#44; they are chiefly drawn irom the chronicles 
of those who themselves persecuted us&#59; and it is not 
claiming too much for the honour of our name to 
say&#44; that the sufierings of Israel have not been over&#8211; 
rated&#44; whilst their crimes and faults have been fully 
exposed. Nay&#44; even admit that many ages of in&#8211; 
flicted inferiority have at length produced a natural 
inferiority&#59; that&#44; having been long trodden upon&#44; the 
Jew has lost all noble aspirings after better things

than mere traffic and petty gain &#58; is this sufficient to 
make ns ashamed of our brothers of Israel &#63; If the 
oppression of a whole world&#44; if the contempt of man&#8211; 
kind&#44; have crushed their spirit and extinguished every 
spark of a high&#8211;souled ambition &#58; then let us sit down 
contentedly with them&#44; let us at least not shun inter&#8211; 
course with them&#44; if by providential blessing we 
should happen to be possessed of a better lot&#44; if we 
should inwardly feel the burning of a desire for dis&#8211; 
tinction which they do not have. For what were the 
best of us not many years back &#63; but the very out&#8211; 
casts from the rights of man which the greater part 
of our people is to this day&#59; and if perchance wealth 
or distinguished services gave any one a temporary 
importance&#44; he was nevertheless excluded in almost 
every country from the enjoyment of the riglits of 
citizenship&#44; and he had in many lands to purchase a 
limited protection&#44; literally to purchase it at an exor&#8211; 
bitant price at the hands of the rulers. And if now 
in several states we are considered equals in the eyes 
of the law&#59; if there a more liberal treatment enkin&#8211; 
dles in us the long&#59; dormant feelino&#59; after nobler as&#8211; 
pirations than yet contents those who still sulier from 
the maltreatment of undeserved persecution for opin&#8211; 
ion&#39;s sake&#58; we should be the last to despise our un&#8211; 
fortunate brothers&#44; or to disown our alliance with 
them. Instead of contempt&#44; they deserve our warm&#8211; 
est admiration&#44; that under all the disadvantages of 
poverty&#44; of ojipression&#44; of exclusion from power&#44; and 
debarment from elegant literature &#59; that despite of 
every advantage offered them formerly&#44; and to this 
very day&#44; if they would but cast off their spiritual 
allegiance to the Jewish laws and rites&#44; they have ad&#8211;

liered firmly to their ancestral institutions&#44; defencling 
them without the power of the sword and the shield 
against the rude assault of barbarous kings&#44; of relent&#8211; 
less priests&#44; and the ceaseless hatred of an excited 
and ignorant multitude. And if they or their sons 
appear among us in this or in any other free country&#44; 
loaded perhaps with the opprobrium attached to mean 
and degraded occupations&#59; if they love not those 
branches of industry wdiicli were till lately utterly 
denied them &#59; if they have vices which oppression is 
but too apt to fasten upon the oppressed &#58; then let us 
step forward&#44; take them aflectionately by the hand&#44; 
make them feel that they are indeed our brothers&#44; 
and let us elevate them with God&#39;s blessing from the 
state of degradation into which they have been cast&#59; 
awaken in them a love of industry and of mental en&#8211; 
lightenment&#59; and it is not saying too much&#44; that only 
a short time will elapse before they will bear a fa&#8211; 
vourable comparison with the other inhabitants of 
the land. 

In the above&#44; we have assumed the worst possible 
state as the position of our people&#59; we have taken as 
true the pictures of degradation which our Intterest 
enemies and our persecutors&#44; as they would gladly be&#44; 
if the mercy of God did not restrain them&#44; present of 
us &#59; and still we have briefly shown that no Israelite 
need be ashamed of his people even as they now are 
said to exist. But we do not admit that we are so de&#8211; 
graded. If w&#39;e have our national faults&#44; we have also 
our virtues. In the midst of all the corruption and 
the love of gain entailed upon us as the bitter fruits 
of persecution&#44; w&#39;e always maintained the character 
of an intelligent&#44; sober&#44; moral&#44; and frugal people.

And Avhen the universities and higli&#8211;schools were 
closed to us&#44; we then diligently applied ourselves to 
the wisdom contained in our religion&#44; and the inge&#8211; 
nuity which was prohibited from nnfolding itself in 
the field of scientific discovery&#44; found ample employ&#8211; 
ment in elucidating the mysteries of religion and to 
meditate on the ways of oar eternal Father. Though 
in this manner doubtless much learning was uselessly 
spent upon unnecessary argumentations and too re&#8211; 
fined disputes &#58; it nevertheless is an evidence that the 
genius of Israel would not suffer itself to rust away 
idly and neglected as a thing of no value. Being 
shut out from scientific pursuits&#44; it is no wonder that 
many of our predecessors at length disregarded them 
as of no importance in the acquisition of a true 
knowledge of what concerns the immortal spirit&#59; 
and hence may have arisen a prejudice with some of 
our nation against the use of secular sciences&#44; al&#8211; 
though now they are open tv&#42; us in every civilized 
country. Men&#44; therefore&#44; who&#44; notwithstanding their 
limited field of inquiry&#44; devoted their lives to study 
and contemplation&#44; justly acquired a widely extended 
influence over the minds and affairs of the Jewish 
communities in which they lived&#44; especially as they 
by their sterling piety were regarded with reverence 
by all their brethren&#44; and were not rarely called upon 
to decide contests arising between Israelites without 
any resort to the courts of justice&#44; where proceedings 
are not conducted upon the simple rules of Jewish 
jurisprudence. &#8212; Of men like these&#44; the most enlight&#8211; 
ened modern philosopher need not be ashamed to 
claim them as compatriots &#59; for if he even be more 
fully acquainted with things unknown to them &#58; still

lio niavl&#41;oast of tlieni as men who unswervingly&#44; and 
often in poverty&#44; and not rarely in loathsome dun&#8211; 
geons&#44; bore their righteous testimony to the unity of 
God and the truth and permanence of his law. Their 
example&#44; moreover&#44; had a wonderful effect upon the 
people Avhose leaders they were&#59; and a love of re&#8211; 
ligion was always maintained supreme in the heart 
of the humblest Israelite&#44; and a scrupulous adherence 
was produced which is well calculated to astonish the 
most profound observer. And in the train of this 
deep&#8211;rooted conformity followed the kindred virtues 
of love of order and a proverbial sobriety&#44; to which 
were added an almost profuse charity towards the 
needy&#44; and a deep reverential deference to parental 
authority &#59; and it is but a rare sight indeed to see a 
Jew asking for alms from the stranger&#44; and offences 
against the person&#44; such as murder and violence&#44; are 
instances of but unfrequent occurrence compared to 
our numbers and the extent of time and surface which 
they occupy. Such&#44; in brief&#44; has been the state of 
the Jews&#44; notwithstanding the debasing influences to 
which they have been exposed&#59; and therefore no one 
who has any self&#8211;respect need to blush for his frater&#8211; 
nity with a race which has so nobly&#44; so unflinchingly&#44; 
supported itself amidst calamities and occurrences&#44; 
the tithe of which conquered the spirit&#44; subdued and 
crushed the mind of every other people similarly 
situated&#44; save it be the descendants of Jacob them&#8211; 
selves. Why then should we hesitate to avow our 
origin &#63; when any one asks us &#34; What is your belief&#63;&#34; 
are we to equivocate or attempt to conceal what 
should be our glory&#63; our boast&#63; our pride&#63; why 
should we seek to hide from the world that we are

followers of the Law of Moses&#44; servants of the God 
of Jacob&#44; seeing that thereby we stamp ourselves as 
connected with a line of martyrs to truth&#44; compared 
to whom the hero who defies death at the month of 
the cannon is a child&#44; a coward &#63; &#8212; Far then be such 
baseness from us&#33; on the contrary&#44; let us on every 
occasion boldly avow our descent&#44; and prove by our 
conduct that we are not unwortliy to enjoy amidst 
peace and freedom a legacy of truth and holiness&#44; 
which was preserved undefiled in the confusion and 
dismay attendant upon persecution and exile. But 
independently of every other consideration let us 
view the question of the open and candid avowal of 
our belief and descent in this light. If there be odi&#8211; 
um resting upon our name&#44; from any reasonable 
cause&#44; then let us endeavour to provide a remedy by 
which the evil can be speedily and readily removed. 
But if&#44; on the contrary&#44; there be no valid reason for 
the foul blot which our enemies have attempted to 
fasten upon the honoured name we bear &#58; then it be&#8211; 
comes evidently our duty to throw back the scorn 
which is cast upon us&#44; and to prefer to remain un&#8211; 
noticed in the midst of the communities where we 
live&#44; rather than buy a secondary importance in so&#8211; 
ciety&#44; in countries where we are equals&#44; by a tame 
submission to insult&#44; or by studiously keeping out of 
siglit that we are Jews&#44; members of the people whom 
the majority of our neighbours do not love&#44; because 
they cannot acquiesce in the religious opinions of 
those who borrowed their religion and philosophy 
from them. This course of action involves no relin&#8211; 
quishment of the duties of citizenship&#44; no abandon&#8211; 
ment of the offices of kindness towards those dift&#39;er&#8211;

ing from us in opinion &#59; the person who speaks to 
you now lias himself received too many acts of kind&#8211; 
ness from persons of difterent shades of belief ever 
to be on his part the advocate of illiberality&#44; a pro&#8211; 
cedure as abhorrent to his feelings&#44; as it is contrary 
to the religion of Israel. Only this was meant to 
be conveyed &#58; that we should insist upon the un&#8211; 
obstructed enjoyment of our natural and unaliena&#8211; 
ble rights&#44; and not disgrace ourselves by tacitly ad&#8211; 
mitting&#44; either byword or deed&#44; that we are in aught 
inferior as professors of a iÂ»eculiar faith to the rest of 
our fellow&#8211;citizens. And if they will not recognize 
our rights&#44; if they are determined to continue to an&#8211; 
noy us by exciting or expressing odium against us&#44; 
as said&#44; merely because we are Jews &#59; if they en&#8211; 
deavour to raise means to promote our conversion to 
a faith which we do not believe in &#59; if they tamper 
with our children or those among us who happen to 
be ignorant of the arguments Avhich we possess in 
abundance &#58; then it is evidently our duty either to 
meet boldly these shameless attempts upon our rights 
and privileges&#44; or if this be impossible&#44; the only other 
remedy is a quiet seclusion and an unobtrusive course 
of condn&#40;jt&#44; till we shame into a retraction those who 
have unjustly assailed us. 

It is almost needless to inform you that intrinsically 
there is nothing degrading in either of the names by 
which we are called. The name of Jew is derived 
from Jadah&#44; the tribe to which David belonged&#44; and 
was used as early as the reign of Ilezckiah&#44; to desig&#8211; 
nate the people composing the kingdom of Judah&#44; 
consisting of tlie tribe of that name&#44; and the tribes 
of Levi and Benjamin&#44; in contradistinction of the&#42; 

<pb n="139"/>

THE ISRAELITISII NATION. 139 

kingdom of Israel&#44; composed of the remaining tribes. 
The derivation of the word min&#94; is from the two 
words H&#39; miN&#44; &#34; I will thank tlie Lord&#44;&#34; which was 
the expression of Leah when her fourth son was 
born. From tliis proper name Yehudah is made the 
generic one of Yehudi.&#44; which has by a contraction&#44; 
not unusual in transmissions&#44; from one language to 
another&#44; been changed into the term Jew &#59; and con&#8211; 
sequently there is nothing in the appellation in itself 
which should render it one of reproach by any known 
rules of interpretation. The name Israel or &#94;xT&#94;y&#94; is 
a by name given to our foretather Jacob&#44; and is like&#8211; 
wise a compound noun from liy a chief&#44; and &#94;x God&#44; 
or a &#34; Divine chief&#44;&#34; and it was conferred upon the 
patriarch to designate the favour with which he was 
regarded by the Lord&#44; and it was given him at a time 
when he had miraculously contended with an angel. 
&#8212; And at last the word Hebrew &#39;n3>&#39; was the name 
applied to Abraham when in Palestine&#44; as denoting 
the one who had come from the other side of the 
river Euphrates&#44; which was the country whence he 
emigrated to Palestine &#59; or&#44; as some suppose&#44; because 
he was a descendant from IJbcr &#34;1&#58;1&#59;&#59;&#44; the tilth in descent 
IVom Noah&#44; and one of the ancestors of Abraham. 
It will be evident that all of these three titles are 
honourable in their original acceptation&#44; and nothing 
l&#41;ut the ignorance of our persecutors could ever have 
made them terms of reproach. This being the case&#44; 
our duty as regards our religious connexions be&#8211; 
comes obvious. We must so live as to restore the lost 
honour&#44; if indeed it be lost&#44; to our natioiud appella&#8211; 
tion&#44; and take a jileasure in claiming alhnity both in 
acts of kindness and religious associations with those&#44;

who&#44; equally with iis&#44; are descended from the same 
common stock&#59; and we may rest assured of one 
thinij&#44; that the Gentiles will at the last honour us for 
displaying so proper a self&#8211;respect&#59; and in this&#44; no 
less than every instance of life&#44; it liolds true&#44; that no 
one can expect of right the esteem and regard of 
others&#44; who is base enough to deny his own descent&#44; 
and who has not sufficient respect for his own fair 
fame and his personal rights&#44; to preserve the one 
from any unjust aspersion&#44; and the others from any 
and every assault which can be made upon them&#44; be 
the offenders who they may. 

But it is not enough for our salvation that we avow 
ourselves Jews&#44; that we be Israelites in our hearts&#44; 
and that we give our aid and countenance to others 
of Hebrew descent. This would be idle boasting&#44; in 
truth valuing a thing of no actual value. For if we 
merely covet the name of Jew&#44; if we only glorify 
ourselves for our honourable descent&#44; and neglect the 
duties which such descent imperiously demands of 
us &#58; we have nothing in our possession to distinguish 
us outwardly from other members of the community 
around us. If we eat the food which they eat&#44; if we 
go to the temples whither they resort&#44; if we rest on 
the days when they rest&#44; if we only pray in a language 
in which they pray &#58; we arc evidently not distinguish&#8211; 
able from them in aught&#44; unless it be our features&#44; 
which are not different in many cases I&#39;rom those of 
other men. And unless our neighbours are right in 
all they do&#44; unless their food be lawful for us to eat&#44; 
their temples the places where the truth is taught&#44; 
their resting day the one appointed by the Lord&#44; their 
language the speech of Israel &#58; we cannot bejustilied

in adopting their manners&#44; or following their exam&#8211; 
ple. No&#44; if our heart feels&#44; then should our acts 
speak out our feelings&#59; if we glory in the possession 
of the law&#44; we should display an entire surrender of 
our will to its dictates. &#8212; In our intercourse with the 
world we will no doubt be frequently invited to sit 
down to the social meal with our gentile friends&#59; 
should we now truly be sensible of what is expected 
from us&#44; we shall feel ourselves called upon not to 
partake of what our law prohibits. We may perhaps 
be called unsociable &#59; but what is that to us&#63; we have 
received divine ordinances which we are bound to 
obey&#44; and nothing&#44; save the most insuperable neces&#8211; 
sity&#44; can in the least absolve us from the prohibition. 
Some may feel a degree of false shame at their seem&#8211; 
ing unreasonableness in declining to eat what is put 
before them &#59; but a simple reference to the command&#8211; 
ments must be answer enough to any intelligent non&#8211; 
Israelite&#44; and any unpleasant feeling&#44; which might 
momentarily have been excited by the apparent re&#8211; 
fusal to partake of the proffered hospitality&#44; will 
speedily be allayed&#44; when it is made evident that this 
refusal is based upon conscientious grounds. We 
will not suppose that original indifference to religion 
is the first impulse to transgression&#44; as we now refer 
merely to the duties which the sincere Israelite has 
to observe&#44; and one who deserves this appellation 
will necessarily look upon all the precepts of Scrip&#8211; 
tures of equal authority and bindingness. But even 
such a one may not have moral courage enough to 
avow boldly in his conduct what he conceives to be 
the truth in theory&#59; and to him therefore we will 
address ourselves and tell him&#44; that moral cowardice 

<pb n="142"/>

as the motive of transgression is na shield against 
punishment&#44; no bar to accountability&#59; and moreover 
that it is highly unreasonable&#44; since the dread of 
worldly consequences is futile&#44; and the exhibition of 
a little lirmness in the outset is all that is required to 
make the path of duty easy and pleasant&#44; in every 
similar circumstance which may afterwards occur. 

To the churches of those dissenting from us we are 
not permitted to go&#44; and to worship there &#59; the order 
observed in them is not the service which was given 
to us&#59; the Deity is not invoked&#44; as we are taught by 
our prophets&#44; and the doctrines lield forth in the most 
liberal of them all are obnoxious to their being not 
in agreement with our received mode of scriptural 
interpretation. I do not mean to say&#44; that the mo&#8211; 
rality preached by our gentile neighbours is otherwise 
than pure and holy&#44; or that they teach aught else 
than the deepest reverence for the Supreme Being. 
God forbid that I should so far forget what is due to 
truth and candour. All I mean to say is this. A 
dissentient church is no place for the habitual resort 
of a Jew&#44; whence he is to carry away his ideas of 
God&#44; of duty&#44; and of the approaching future. It is 
dangerous&#44; especially for the uninformed&#44; to hear his 
own people denounced as walking in error and dark&#8211; 
ness&#44; as being out of the pale of divine mercy&#44; for 
certain deeds and the rejection of certain opinions&#44; 
which when admitted as truths would destroy at 
once the existence of the Jewish people. Ilis ear 
must be offended&#44; or else his faith must be wavering&#44; 
to perceive the remnant of Israel prayed for&#44; not that 
the divine protection might be vouchsafed to them as 
formerly&#44; that the Lord might be pleased to let his 

<pb n="143"/>

glory dwell again in Zion&#44; but that they might be 
turned away from their ancient path to walk in the 
light of a dispensation which we caif never admit as 
of any authority&#44; while Ave have the least reverence 
for the ordinances of the Bible&#44; and which can only 
take place at our entire avmihilation. &#8212; Let us look at 
the doctrines propounded. Of God they say that He 
needs a mediator to shield man from everlasting con&#8211; 
demnation &#59; we&#44; however&#44; are taught to regard Ilim 
alone as all in all&#44; as all&#8211;sufficient to create and to 
save. Of our duties they say&#44; that by a new dispen&#8211; 
sation&#44; though without any public manifesting of the 
divine glory&#44; all the positive injunctions of ceremonial 
religion have been abrogated&#44; nay that in the moral 
institntes a vital change has been made&#59; now we can&#8211; 
not acquiesce in any such teaching&#44; since we claim 
permanence and unchangeableness for the word of 
God. Lastly&#44; with regard to the future&#44; their doctrine 
of the messiah is such that we cannot recognize it to 
be the view entertained of this august messenger by 
the prophets of Israel. In short&#44; though mere mo&#8211; 
rality can be acquired from gentile teachers&#44; religion 
proper is not in their power to bestow on those who 
like us believe in One God&#44; in the permanence of the 
Law&#44; and in the blissful coming of the son of David. 
It is not&#44; however&#44; meant to be conveyed&#44; that an oc&#8211; 
casional attendance without the idea of partaking in 
worship&#44; merely to hear the peculiarity of a different 
belief clearly exhibited by one every way capable of 
doing it justice&#44; is sinful&#59; not so&#59; I speak of a con&#8211; 
stant repairing or a frequent attendance for the pur&#8211; 
pose of listening to heterodox sermons&#44; which will 
naturally cause a loosening of the ties which bind us 

<pb n="144"/>

144 THE ISRAELITISH NATION. 

to our religion. It is a dangerous self&#8211;confidence to 
suppose that a frequent hearing of any peculiar doe&#8211; 
trine will not have any sensible effect upon us&#59; if it 
does not enforce new ideas&#44; it will to a certainty 
weaken old impressions&#44; unless indeed we arc well 
fortiiied by a high degree of knowledge and a deep&#8211; 
seated humble faith in the Word of God. A great 
deal more remains to be said on this subject&#59; but I 
must defer it to a future occasion. In brief it may 
be very proper occasionally to go and hear what our 
religious opponents have to say&#44; for two reasons&#44; the 
one that we may be able to fortify ourselves in our 
own views and to ward off&#34; the attacks which may be 
made unawares upon our members&#44; which would 
evidently be out of our power&#44; if we were entirely 
unacquainted with the ideas which others entertain 
on the momentous subject of religion&#44; and the argu&#8211; 
ments they make use of to fortity their position &#59; and 
secondly&#44; to show that we are not blind believers&#44; 
who are unwilling and afraid to investigate for them&#8211; 
selves&#59; since our religion is onphatically one tliat 
can bear the test of exposure aud has millions of ar&#8211; 
guments to prove its truth and holiness. But we 
must not yield from weakness&#44; from fear of offending&#44; 
or for the sake of appearing in fashionable meeting&#8211; 
houses&#44; to the solicitation of our friends to accom&#8211; 
pany them frequently to their places of worship &#59; for 
this compliance can lead to no good results&#44; and may 
produce abundance of evil to our spiritual&#8211;welfare. 
It is not illiberality which is to teach us this course 
of conduct&#44; but a decent consistency and self&#8211;respect&#59; 
for by a frcqueut attendance on such preaching as 
just mentioned we confess that we have not sufficient 

<pb n="145"/>

THE ISRAELITISH NATION. 145 

moral instruction of our own&#44; and that we needs must 
seek for light from those who confessedly have bor&#8211; 
rowed from us. And if there actually be a deficiency 
of such teaching among us&#44; which I cannot deny&#44; to 
a great extent at least&#44; it is evidently our duty&#44; and 
should be our pleasure&#44; to remove the evil&#44; and place 
ourselves upon an equality in respect to religious in&#8211; 
struction &#59; since we are undoubtedly equal as regard 
reliofious truths with our neighbours. 

Another subject I deem it my duty to touch upon 
in connexion with the above. It is a melancholy 
fact&#44; that there are persons whose moral vision is so 
perverted&#44; that they go about sapping the foundation 
of all positive religion &#59; they go so far as to erect 
halls for the spreading of their peculiar views&#44; and 
there gather hearers around them&#44; and in flowing 
and smooth speeches tell their auditories&#44; that all re&#8211; 
ligion is fable&#44; and the unphilosophical invention of 
designing men. It exceeds my comprehension to 
miderstand what benefit such declaimers propose to 
themselves or society at large. It is needless for me 
to appear as the champion of the advantages which 
the religion of the Bible confers upon society&#44; and of 
the civilizing and elevating influence it has exerted 
and will continue to exert upon all who drink at her 
holy fountain. These men therefore appear like in&#8211; 
cendiaries who&#44; from fruitless malice&#44; apply the torch 
to works of art&#44; for no other reason than to destroy. 
But it more than surprises me&#44; to hear that Israelites 
can go time after time&#44; and encourage such men to 
persevere in their blasphemy&#44; by lending them the 
countenance of their presence&#44; and by contributing 
to their support. What good can be derived from

such a course&#63; If we admit once that the Bible is 
not true&#44; there can be no occasion for our hearing 
the same idea repeated in a new form from time to 
time. If Ave are once persuaded that there is no ne&#8211; 
cessity for belief&#44; there is an end of moral obligation&#44; 
and an end too of the necessity of any man to tell us 
so&#59; and therefore there can be no earthly imaginable 
reason&#44; why we need go more than once to attend inii&#8211; 
del lectures&#44; if we admit their truth. The only result 
such an attendance can produce is a laxity of religious 
observance&#44; or&#44; if this has already established itself as 
the course of life of the moral patient&#44; it locks the 
door against his recovery&#44; and fairly shuts against 
him the hopeful portals of repentance. ISTo&#44; beloved 
friends &#33; that man who attempts in the least to weaken 
your attacliment to the inherited religion you pos&#8211;

thrown the Lord behind their backs&#44; to use the em&#8211; 
phatic word of Scripture&#44; would invite you to cross 
the threshold of his halls&#44; avoid them as you would 
the portals of the lazar house where a horrible death 
would await you &#59; nay&#44; far safer would it be to expose 
your bodies to a premature earthly dissolution&#44; than 
to risk by such intercourse the everlasting happi&#8211; 
ness of your immortal spirits. 

We have been led step by step to dwell so long 
upon the few points already exhibited&#44; that we must 
condense what yet remains of our proposed&#58; subject 
for to&#8211;day&#39;s contemplation. We spoke of our day of 
rest as contradistinguished from the season of repose 
chosen by the gentiles. In this point we are unfortu&#8211; 
nately greatly remiss. Every excuse is greedily seized 
upon which can by any possible construction extenu&#8211; 
ate our disregard of the day of the Lord&#39;s own insti&#8211; 
tuting. This blessed day was to be a sign between 
Him and his chosen people&#59; for on it they should re&#8211; 
pose from bodily labour&#44; and consecrate it to Him 
alone. It was to be a perpetual sign&#44; that is to say&#44; that 
in every period of time&#44; from Moses to the latest gen&#8211; 
eration&#44; it should be always regarded and respected 
as the special evidence of the Lord&#39;s superintending 
care over all creation. It is not to be denied that the 
gentiles&#44; when partially embracing our faith&#44; changed&#44; 
without any reasonable cause whatever&#44; the seventh 
into the first day as devoted to rest and worship. But 
Ave have not received any dispensation to authorize 
us to follow in this course&#59; the Scripture&#63;&#44; sanctity the 
seventh day and no other&#59; and if the observance of 
our Sabbath is no longer requisite&#44; then is there no 
instituted Sabbath Avhatever. But again I say&#44; it is 

<pb n="148"/>

148 THE ISRAELITISH NATION. 

morally ccrtnin that an unbelief in the religions obli&#8211; 
gation to keep the seventh day holy is not the cause 
of its frequent violation among us&#59; we believe&#44; on the 
contrary&#44; in the full force of its enactment&#59; but an 
unholy desire for wealth or distinction counsels too 
strongly a transgression of the divine behest&#44; and we 
sin because we believe sinning to be advantageous in 
promoting some tangible worldly advantage. Yet it 
must he evident&#44; that such a proceeding is not worthy 
of men who have been so eminently favoured with 
religious knowledge as we have been &#33; Chosen to be 
the champions of the wisdom proceeding from the 
highest Source&#44; it is indeed too humiliating that we 
are so much the slaves of worldliness &#33; Not this is 
the way of life&#44; not tlius can we expect the glory of 
the Lord to dwell among us. But if we seek earnestly 
to abide in the shadow of the Most High&#44; we must 
lay aside all desires which stand in the way of a union 
with Ilim&#44; cast off the trammels whi&#40;&#59;h would neces&#8211; 
sarily clog our upward flight&#59; and thus only can we 
be eternally happy&#44; when&#44; prizing God&#39;s favour above 
all things&#44; we can forego the tangible gains ol&#39; earthly 
pursuits&#44; and dedicate even in our dispersion and cap&#8211; 
tivity to his service the day which was set apart as the 
national acknowledgment of liis universal sovereignty. 
Nor are we at liberty to abolish the use of Israel&#39;s 
speech in onr prayers. An unacquaintauce with it is 
nothing but a disgrace to us and an evidence of an 
unpardonable stipineness on our part&#59; since&#44; disguise 
it as we may&#44; there are many opportunities for acquir&#8211; 
ing at least a moderate acquaintance with its struc&#8211; 
ture. It was shown on a former occasion how a com&#8211;

the bond which unites the many congregations of 
oui&#34; people is our common language&#59; destroy this&#44; 
and you destroy by far more than you imagine our 
nationality. The same book&#44; no matter where printed 
or written&#44; provided the language and characters are 
Hebrew&#44; will be understood in every laud where Is&#8211; 
raelites dwell&#59; the very words are interwoven with 
our daily speech in some shape or the other&#44; and the 
tones of this language are familiar to the Jewish ear 
as dimly remembered notes of music upon the enrap&#8211; 
tured fancy. And for what should these sweet recol&#8211; 
lections be changed &#63; for the multifarious dialects of 
many nations&#44; which would require for each land a 
properly authorized version of Scripture&#63; Shall we 
thus bind ourselves to the decisions of fallible men&#63; 
are we to rely helplessly upon the interpretations 
which might be forced upon us by persons&#44; who might 
unfortunately be willing to take advantage of our ig&#8211; 
norance &#63; But whilst our prayers are offered up in 
the original Hebrew&#44; whilst the Holy Law is re&#8211; 
bearsed in the very words it was first given&#44; we need 
never fear such a result&#59; for if an error even should 
have been made in the rendering of any word or sen&#8211; 
tence&#44; and say even that it has become current among 
Hebrews&#44; succeeding generations may with the orig&#8211; 
inal before them correct tlie misapprehension of their 
predecessors&#59; and thus the religion of Israel will ever 
spring forth renewed and in refreshed vigour from 
the fruitful soil of Israel&#39;s language.

In short&#44; we are bound to cultivate earnestly what&#8211; 
ever may tend to elevate our character and mark the 
boundary line between us and the gentiles with more 
distinctness&#44; though this must always be&#44; as said al&#8211; 
ready&#44; without infringing in the least upon the rules 
of liberality and an active neighbourly love towards 
all our fellow&#8211;men of whatever creed and country. 
Only by such a course can we deserve the blessing of 
God&#39;s immediate protection&#44; and be worthy of being 
the recipients of his glory. For this is nothing else&#44; 
than that the workings of our blessed religion shall 
be seen in our lives and the happiness which thereby 
we diftuse around us&#44; and by so acting the name of 
God&#44; whom we adore and whose inheritance we are&#44; 
will be glorified and his kingdom be in the end ac&#8211; 
knowledged by all the sons of man&#44; who will see its 
happy eti&#39;ects on a people whom they once persecuted 
and despised. But this can only be&#44; if we in very&#8211; 
deed are Israelites in name and conduct&#59; there must 
be no amalgamation with others&#59; for to the descen&#8211; 
dants of Jacob alone&#44; and only where we appear as 
such&#44; which consequently demands at our hands a 
constant preservation of our race&#44; our lineage&#44; and 
our law&#44; was the promise made which we read in our 
to&#8211;day&#39;s portion &#58; 

&#34; And I will dwell among the children of Israel&#44; and I will be a 
God unto them. And they shall know that I am the Lord their 
God&#44; who have brought them out of the land of Egypt&#44; that I may

dwell in the midst of them&#44; I am the Lord their God.&#34; Exodus&#44; 
xxix. 45&#44; 4G. 

So great a blessing as is here held out to our ac&#8211; 
ceptance cannot be deemed one of small moment&#44; 
nor should it be idly thrown aside from motives of 
unbelief or faithlessness. We ought to consider that 
our redemption was not for our glorification&#44; our se&#8211; 
lection was not that we might boast of the great favour 
which we had received &#58; only that we might be the 
recipients of the law which was founded upon the 
wisdom of God&#44; in order that he might in very truth 
dwell in the hearts of his creatures and be reverenced 
and acknowledged the King of all. The way this can 
be done has been pointed out to you in Scripture&#59; 
but this can only be accomplished&#44; if you are will&#8211; 
ing to be and to remain children of Jacob whom the 
Lord called Israel and Jeshurun&#44; and are obedient in 
thought&#44; in faith&#44; in hope&#44; in deed to that holy law 
which was surrendered to you by that mediator and 
messenger between God and man&#44; Moses&#44; than whom 
no greater prophet ever arose in Israel&#44; and like whom 
none ever will exist from the beginning of the world 
till all shall have ceased to be. 

And now&#44; our God &#33; till our hearts with rever&#8211; 
ence of tliy great and fearful name &#59; teach us truly 
how to worship Thee&#44; and remove the heart of stone 
from us&#44; that we may all return unto Thee with a 
sincere and humble repentance&#44; in order that thy 
glory may be evident among us&#44; and that it may be 
known by all that we are thy people&#44; and that thy 
word in our hands is true and abiding for ever. Amen.

DISCOURSE IX. 

JUDAH&#39;S OFFERING. 

Unto the everlasting Father and eternal King&#44; the 
sole Creator&#44; the only Ruler&#44; the omnipotent Saviour&#44; 
be glory&#44; praise&#44; and adoration from now unto ever&#8211;

Brethren &#33; 

As one of the blessings promised to the Israelites 
at their restoration the last of the prophets predicts&#58; 

&#34;Then shall be pleasant unto the Lord the ofTering of Judah and 
Jerusalem&#44; as in the days of old&#44; and as in former j&#34;cars.&#34; Mala&#8211; 
chi&#44; iii. 4. 

In proceeding to investigate the meaning of this 
prediction as well as that of every other prophecy con&#8211; 
tained in Scripture&#44; we must bear in mind&#44; Who 
were the prophets&#63; and&#44; To whom did they speak in 
the execution of the missions with which truly were 
charged&#63; First&#44; as to who were the prophets&#63; we 
answer&#44; they were men of Israel&#44; descendants from 
the patriarchal stock&#44; chosen from among the multi&#8211; 
tude of their fellow&#8211;citizens on account of the supe&#8211; 
rior adaptation which an all&#8211;seeing God discovered 
in them for matters of high emprise and noble dar&#8211; 
ing in the cause of the blessed faith given from Ilorcb. 
Secondly&#44; as to whom did they speak in the execu&#8211; 
tion of the missions witli which they were charged&#63; 

<pb n="153"/>

JUDAH&#39;S OFFERING. 153 

To this we reply&#44; tliat tliey were sent to those wlio 
were of their own kindred&#44; tlie whole house of Isniel&#44; 
to warn them and to exhort them to obedience to that 
law which they had all alike received as their heav&#8211; 
enly heir&#8211;loom&#44; and which they were all alike bound 
to follow&#44; be they priests or people&#44; prophets or chil&#8211; 
dren. In other&#39; words&#44; the prophets were ardent&#44; 
strict&#44; unflinching adherents of the Law of Moses&#44; 
and they were sent to exhort their fellow&#8211;believers to 
follow in the same path&#44; in the road of salvation. It 
is therefore evident that&#44; if we wish to have a correct 
view of prophets and prophecies&#44; we must on no ac&#8211; 
count lose sight of the two important facts which we 
have mentioned&#44; that the prophets were Israelites in 
every sense of the word&#44; and spoke preeminently of 
matters which concerned the political and religious 
welfare of Israelites&#44; of those to whom they had 
been sent. 

From this reasonable view it follows likewise that&#44; 
if prophets speak of the Israelites or of the law of 
the Israelites&#44; and exhort the first to obedience and 
set before them the latter as the thing to be obeyed&#44; 
they must be understood to speak in a direct&#44; literal 
and obvious sense of the words&#44; and not be taken as 
speaking figuratively or metaphorically&#59; that is to 
say&#44; they mean nothing else than what the first and 
common sense meaning of their words signifies. If 
now Malachi speaks of the oli&#39;ering of Judah and 
Jerusalem as the thing which shall be again agreea&#8211; 
ble unto the Lord&#44; it is not consonant with reason to 
look for occurrences taking place four hundred or 
more years after the prophet&#39;s death to interpret for 
us his words&#44; but to events and institutions with 

<pb n="154"/>

which he himself and his hearers Hkewise were fa&#8211; 
miliar&#44; Nor will it he correct to suppose that Jiidali 
means some other people than the inhabitants of 
Palestine&#44; and Jerusalem some other city than the 
capital of that land &#59; for if the prophet had wanted 
to convey this view&#44; he would have so expressed it. 
lie surely cannot be supposed to be in want of words 
to express his ideas so as to be intelligible &#59; and if 
he did not wish to convey the actual Judah and the 
identical Jerusalem&#44; he certainly chose a very ambigu&#8211; 
ous mode of expressing his thoughts. For if Judah 
be not Judah&#44; and Jerusalem some other real or im&#8211; 
aginary city&#44; we require some authority other than 
the holy Text to inform us what we are to under&#8211; 
stand by the words employed&#59; and consequently&#44; 
Scriptures would cease to be able to direct and inform 
us as to what are the doctrines we are to believe in&#44; 
and what duties we are to practise. But it is evident 
that we must necessarily rely upon the Bible alone 
for all matters of belief and duty &#59; and therefore no 
matter what may be the secondary&#44; hidden or in&#8211; 
cluded meaning of the words &#40;which spirituality we 
arc on no account willing to deny&#41;&#58; the evident sig&#8211; 
niiication of the phrases must be the first and chief 
object of the revelation which we have received. So 
then when we are told of an offering&#44; an absolute of&#8211; 
fering&#44; or sacrifice in its various modilication is meant&#59; 
and when it is qualiiicd by the addition of Judah and 
Jerusalem&#44; we are at once certain that the sacrilice 
spoken of is precisely such a one&#44; as was offered by 
the people of Judah at the city of Jerusalem&#44; and no 
other. Admit now&#44; for argument&#39;s sake&#44; that the of&#8211; 
fering designated should not be the outward sacrifice

JUDAH&#39;S OFFERING. 155 

of animals with their accompanying&#8211; meat and drink&#8211; 
offerings&#58; what then should he understood&#63; The 
prophet himself gives us no clue whatever&#44; the Bihlc 
is completely silent of the spiritual sacrifice&#59; and 
consequently we are left to mere conjecture to desig&#8211; 
nate with any prohability the intended or promised 
sacrifice. Indeed they&#44; who arrogate the blessed 
promise as referring to themselves&#44; actually do en&#8211; 
deavour to make their system tally with the predic&#8211; 
tion&#44; and even different sects try to prove that they 
have something like a sacrifice among the ceremonies 
of their religion&#44; which they vainly assert is the pure 
oftering indicated by the prophet from whom our text 
is taken. Without going to&#8211;day far into the subject&#44; 
I will merely state the case simply&#44; that each of you&#44; 
brethren&#44; may be able to decide the question for him&#8211; 
self In the first place&#44; there seems to an Israelite 
something very harsh and iri&#8211;econcilable with divine 
wisdom to call any sacrifice which the Lord has in&#8211; 
stituted less pure than any other&#44; which He has or&#8211; 
dained or which He may ordain hereafter&#44; or which 
any man may invent. As believers in the truth of 
revealed religion we have no right&#44; and cannot there&#8211; 
fore be authorized&#44; to call a symbolic sacrifice more 
pure than an actual one &#59; or the presentation of bread 
and wine&#44; or any other typical gift of whatever na&#8211; 
ture it may be&#44; more holy than the actual presenta&#8211; 
tion of blood and fat on the altar. We are nowhere 
authorized to condemn any portion of the Bible as 
unreasonable&#44; superfluous&#44; or abrogated&#59; and conse&#8211; 
quently we are not warranted&#44; either by reason or 
revelation&#44; to stigmatize the sacrifices described in 
Leviticus as otherwise than holy and pure&#44; or else 

<pb n="156"/>

156 JUDAH&#39;S OFFERING. 

they never could have occupied a conspicuous place 
in the word of God&#44; or heen permitted to constitute 
a constant&#44; daily&#44; and integral part of his temple&#8211; 
worship. In short&#44; we maintain that we need no 
other&#44; and that there is nothing purer and holier than 
the divine ordination of the sacrifices&#59; and these con&#8211; 
sisted&#44; as we all know&#39;&#44; of different kinds of animals&#44; 
with different species of bread&#44; oil&#44; and wine&#44; and 
were divided&#44; according to their nature&#44; into burnt&#44; 
peace&#44; sin&#44; and trespass&#8211;offerings&#59; and according to 
the character of the offerers into private and public 
sacrifices. The introductory chapters of Leviticus 
give ample directions regarding this subject&#44; and you 
are referred to this authority for the different laws 
respecting it. Upon inspection&#44; it will be seen that 
all the sacrifices&#44; without exception&#44; were intended as 
aids to devotion&#44; and as acknowledgments by the sin&#8211; 
ner of his guiltiness and uuworthiness in the sight of 
his Maker. 

We all know from experience and history that 
mankind are disposed to sin&#44; both individually and 
collectively &#59; and consequently the sacrifices were of 
a similar nature. They were in the first instance the 
gifts of individuals&#44; springing at times from a volun&#8211; 
tary elevation of feeling to acknowledge some signal 
deliverance&#44; some undeserved enjoyment of merey 
&#40;as all the bounties of the Lord are undeserved by 
man&#41;&#44; at others from a conviction that guilt attached 
to their soul. In the first case&#44; the Israelite came to 
the house of his God perhaps from a distant corner 
of his lovely fatherland&#44; when he had escaped from 
the perilous storm which threatened destruction to 
his frail bark&#44; frail when contending against the

power of the Most High &#59; or when rising from the 
couch of sickness&#44; where human aid was also of no 
avail&#44; and where the great Physician alone could 
send healing&#59; or when returning from the sands of 
the mighty desert in safety&#44; delivered from the sword 
of the marauding plunderer and the fatal simoom &#59; or 
upon again seeing his loved homestead&#44; snatched by 
his almighty Deliverer from the dungeon of the foe&#44; 
the dangers of the battle&#8211;field and the assault of con&#8211; 
tending armies &#59; or because he saw himself blessed 
in his undertakings&#44; his fields yielding a rich produce&#44; 
his flocks multiplied&#44; and his herds bringing a numer&#8211; 
ous increase. &#8212; In all these instances and many similar 
ones&#44; the pious Israelite came with the fatling of his 
fiock&#44; or the best steer of his herds&#44; or the first fruits 
of his field&#44; to enjoy a day of festivity at the courts of 
his God in the midst of sympathizing friends and re&#8211; 
joicing kindred&#59; and others doing and feeling like 
himself were there likewise&#59; and the common bond 
of love to God bound them then into the common 
chain of Israel&#39;s sons and daughters&#44; teaching them 
all to look to Ilim only for grace&#44; mercy&#44; and protec&#8211; 
tion&#59; inasmuch as all had come to acknowledge them&#8211; 
selves his subjects and debtors for undeserved mer&#8211; 
cies&#44; bountifully bestowed. 

Or if a man had sinned against God or man&#44; if his 
soul felt overburdened with the weight and conscious&#8211; 
ness of his guiltiness&#44; wdiat could better fix upon his 
mind the nature and odiousness of sin&#44; than his re&#8211; 
pairing to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem with 
his sacrifice as an atonement&#63; not that the slaughtered 
beast had any power in it to wash away sin and to 
restore pejice to the soul&#44; but that the entire process

<pb n="158"/>

158 JUDAH&#39;S OFFERING. 

was the work of iaitli and obedience&#59; for from the 
moment that the sinner tlionght of bringing an offer&#8211; 
ing&#44; till the consummation of the sacrilice&#44; was one 
series of acts of penitence and devotion. First&#44; he 
must have been awakened to a consciousness of sin&#44; 
before he could resolve to bring a sin or trespass&#8211;of&#8211; 
fering. Then he must have felt the contaminatinsr 
influence of sin&#44; or else he would not strive to escape 
from its power. Then he had to make restitution 
for whatever injury he had done to his neighbour&#44; or 
even the defenceless stranger&#44; who had no friend to 
take his part and no protector&#44; save the Lord above 
who announces himself as the Friend of the stranger. 
Next there was required an humble outpouring of 
the spirit in confession of the wrong done and of the 
guiltiness thereby incurred &#59; and when at last the 
sacrilice itself was standing near the altar&#44; the sinner&#39;s 
hands were laid on the head of the victim&#44; and he 
was solemnly impressed&#44; not alone by the knowledge 
of his iniquity&#44; but the overpowering consciousness 
that he was&#44; so to say&#44; standing in the immediate pres&#8211; 
ence of the great King&#44; the Searcher of hearts&#44; who 
could not be deceived with regard to the sincerity of 
his repentance. It must hence be self&#8211;evident that&#44; 
if a thorough conviction of sin can at all be produced 
in the mind of man&#44; it must be through means like 
these and at a place like the temple in Jerusalem&#44; 
especially since the very nature of publicly sacriticing 
a sin or trespass&#8211;offering was a public acknowledg&#8211; 
ment that the sacrificer had transgressed &#59; and now he 
came before the face of all the people to bow in hu&#8211; 
mility and meekness&#44; nothing daunted by the shame 
of exposure&#44; only because he had sinned&#44;.to seek for 

<pb n="159"/>

JUDAH&#39;s OFFERING. 159 

mercy and forgiveness and a i&#8211;encwal of fuA&#39;our from 
the Lord whose law he had transgressed. It was not 
therefore the sacrifice itself which made atonement&#44; 
but the contrition of heart&#44; the sincerity of hope&#44; the 
wrong amended&#44; the restitution of the iniquitous gain&#44; 
the exuberance of prayerful feeling&#44; the renewed faith 
and trust which characterized the accepted oftering. 
&#8212; These features were&#44; in brief&#44; the leading points 
of the individual sacrifices&#59; but the public ones&#44; the 
daily no less than the extraordinary&#44; were to do like&#8211; 
wise for the people what the former did for the single 
person. Daily the people&#44; by their representatives&#44; 
consisting of priests&#44; Levites&#44; and Israelites&#44; stood 
near the Lord&#39;s altar at Jerusalem&#44; to acknowledge 
that the nation&#44; like its component single members&#44; 
had received bounties from God&#44; and that collective 
sins too had been committed&#44; for which at stated pe&#8211; 
riods general atoning offerings were required. And 
when particular great sins had been committed by 
the congregation&#44; and on the great Day of Atonement&#44; 
once in every year&#44; sacrifices were required&#44; which&#44; 
by the peculiar solemnities attending them&#44; were the 
more strongly calculated to arrest the attention&#44; and 
to move more emphatically the whole assembled body 
l&#41;resent at such an occasion to a more inmicdiate and 
thorough repentance. And when the three seasons 
of pilgrimage to the sanctuary came round to bless 
and sanctify the house of Israel&#44; then again were the 
offerings demanded&#44; in order that over the board&#44; lit&#8211; 
erally spread from the immediate store of the Lord&#44; 
his holy name might be blessed&#44; and his fear niight 
again animate the ardent belief in his salvation&#44; and 
that they who had no means of their own might sit

down with their wealthier brethren to commemorate&#44; 
annually&#44; their redemption from Egypt&#44; the proclama&#8211; 
tion of their life&#8211;bringing law&#44; and the watchful Provi&#8211; 
dence that had cared for&#44; and protected them during 
their weary and protracted wandering for a period of 
forty years in the inhospitable deserts of Arabia. 
And again npon the recurrence of the Passover&#44; the 
peculiar offering of a roasted lamb with its attendant 
ceremonies&#44; was to bring back a lively recollection&#44; 
or more correctly speaking&#44; a personification of their 
redemption from cruel bondage&#44; and to remind them 
that for the sake of making them a priestly nation 
was the arm of the Most High bared to break asunder 
the bauds of their yoke&#44; that they might walk forth 
freed and redeemed. 

In short&#44; individual gratitude and sin&#44; national 
thanksgiving and transgression&#44; were all to be ex&#8211; 
pressed by offering or sacrifice. To discover anything 
impure or unworthy in such an institution surpasses 
the comprehension of an Israelite. For no one can say&#44; 
with any show of truth&#44; that faith excited to contri&#8211; 
tion&#44; sinfulness acknowledged publicly&#44; the feeling of 
thanksgiving exhibited unequivocally before assem&#8211; 
bled thousands&#44; devotion participated in simultaneous&#8211; 
ly by all classes of the people&#44; are otherwise than acts 
npon which the Lord must look with approval&#44; seeing 
that thereby his kingdom will truly be extended over 
the hearts of individuals&#44; and be firmly established 
among a people where they who act thus are so numer&#8211; 
ous&#44; as they were during the prevalence of piety among 
our forefathers. AVhatever&#44; also&#44; has an effect upon the 
spread of righteousness&#44; whatever elevates the heart 
and rouses the dormant faculties to contemplation and

reverence&#44; is evidently not unworthy of divine favour &#59; 
consequently the sacrifices&#44; even as they were brought 
by the actual people of Judah&#44; and in the identical 
city of Jerusalem in days of old and in former years&#44; 
are things which are well worthy to be restored at the 
time of the redemption. &#8212; I do not deem it requisite 
to defend the institution of bloody victims against the 
asserters of a new revelation&#59; for if they at all rely 
upon the predictions of the prophets&#44; they must also 
admit the truth of the law and the wisdom of that 
divine institution&#44; in confirmation of which all the 
prophets spoke. It is strange indeed to hear them 
cavil at some portions of Scripture&#44; and to see with 
how much skill and industry they select such pas&#8211; 
sages as suit their convenience&#44; and weave them into 
an apparently strong i&#39;abric&#44; which they ofier to the 
world at large as impregnable to the assaults of argu&#8211; 
ment. But if the Bible is true&#44; which all believers 
will gladly join in asserting&#44; it is an absolute requi&#8211; 
site that the whole of its contents be true &#59; and if one 
part of the law is obligatory&#44; every one of its enact&#8211; 
ments must be likewise binding and authoritative. 
Xow it is evident that the sacrifices&#44; as they were in 
practice among us&#44; were of divine origin&#44; being or&#8211; 
dained and described in the law&#59; consequently they 
are in their very nature the effects of a Source&#44; pure 
and holy. iS&#39;ow&#44; say even that&#44; at a subsequent period&#44; 
another institution of a different kind was established 
by an equally high authority&#44; which we&#44; however&#44; 
totally deny&#44; that does not prove that the original 
scheme of sacrificial atonements was otherwise than 
wise&#44; pure&#44; and holy. Nay&#44; the very claim of a sub&#8211; 
stitute&#44; either as having been made absolutely by one

individual in a period long antecedent to this age&#44; 
which is maintained by some&#44; or as being to this day 
brought daily in a symbolical and typical manner&#44; as 
asserted by others of the followers of the creed al&#8211; 
luded to&#44; proves that all agree in maintaining the 
necessity and usefulness of sacrifices&#59; since they only 
differ in respect to the manner and nature of the ma&#8211; 
terials which&#44; are to be employed toward this purpose. 
In fact&#44; they go in their zeal so far as to say that&#44; 
without a sacrifice&#44; there can be no atonement&#59; but 
this proves too much or too little &#59; for if sacrificial 
atonement be absolutely required&#44; then there is a ne&#8211; 
cessity likewise for bloody victims&#44; if an offering of 
some sort is to be brought&#44; for the law mentions no 
other&#59; and if these can be dispensed with&#44; tlien have 
we every right to contend that&#44; under certain circum&#8211; 
stances&#44; there can be atonement without sacrifices&#59; 
for we assert that they were&#44; at best&#44; but aids to de&#8211; 
votion and repentance &#59; and when&#44; by any reason 
whatever&#44; their attainment is out of our power&#44; the 
Merciful will accept devotion and repentance&#44; pro&#8211; 
vided they be sincere&#44; even if unaccompanied by the 
gifts originally stipulated for in the law. 

This view brings us now to the elucidation of our 
text&#58; &#34;Then shall be pleasant unto the Lord the of&#8211; 
fering of Judah and Jerusalem&#44; as in the days of old 
and as in former years.&#34; Let us at first determine the 
period meant by the prophet. In the first two chap&#8211; 
ters he reproves the evil&#8211;doers for their contempt of 
divine authority and their defiance of God&#39;s judgment. 
But we all know that this is the present state of the 
world no less than in the day&#39;s of our republic&#59; wicked&#8211; 
ness sits enthroned in high places&#44; and triumphantly 

<pb n="163"/>

JUDAH&#39;S OFFERING. 163 

defies the God of justice&#44; ridiculing the weakness of 
less hardy spirits&#44; who affect to tremble before the 
invisible Judge and his unknown decrees. But sud&#8211; 
denly the prophet bursts forth with an impassioned 
and high&#8211;wrought picture of better things&#44; that are to 
follow at a time remote from his own&#44; and under a 
state of society diftcring materially from the one pre&#8211; 
vailing when he spoke. These are his words &#58; &#34; Be&#8211; 
hold&#44; I send my messenger&#44; and he shall clear out the 
way before me &#59; and suddenly shall come to his tem&#8211; 
l&#41;le&#44; the Lord whom ye are seeking&#44; and the angel of 
the covenant whom ye desire&#44; behold &#33; he cometh&#44; 
saith the Lord of hosts. But who may abide the day 
of his coming &#63; and who can stand when lie appear&#8211; 
otli &#63; for he is like the retiner&#39;s fire and like the soap 
of the fuller. And he will sit as the refiner and pu&#8211; 
rifier of silver&#44; and shall purify the sons of Levi&#44; and 
purge them like gold and silver&#59; that they shall be&#8211; 
long unto the Lord&#44; who sacrifice the offering in 
righteousness.&#34; And then he adds&#58; &#34; Then shall be 
pleasant unto the Lord the offering of Judah and Je&#8211; 
rusalem.&#34; It must be self&#8211;evident that the prophet 
looks forward to a state of mental purity. It cannot 
be that he spoke of the second temple&#59; for he lived&#44; 
according to the best authorities&#44; near a hundred 
years after its erection. It cannot be that he spoke 
of a state of society like that in which he lived &#59; for 
he spccifically says that the Refiner will purify the 
house of Levi as gold and silver&#59; which&#44; as far as our 
knowledge extends&#44; has not yet taken place. Nor 
can it bo asserted that he speaks of a metaphorical 
cleansing &#59; for he couples this promise with one of a 
real&#44; substantial&#44; well&#8211;understood act&#44; the bringing of 

<pb n="164"/>

164 JUDAH&#39;S OFFERING. 

sacrifices. Nor can it be that the sacrifice itself is to 
be symbolical &#59; for he mentions the offering of Judah 
and Jerusalem as in days of old. Now what were 
the days of old &#63; Evidently the days of Moses&#44; of 
David&#44; of Hezekiah&#44; of Josiah&#44; and other pious lead&#8211; 
ers&#44; when&#44; indeed&#44; the offering of the people was sa&#8211; 
voury in the eyes of the Lord. I3ut if a symbolical 
sacrifice had been intended&#44; he would have said &#58; 
&#34; Then shall be brought unto the Lord a new offer&#8211; 
ing&#44; which shall be forever pleasing&#44; by far more than 
the ancient sacrifice of steers and lambs upon the 
altar of the house of Judah&#44; erected unto the Most 
High&#44; which is now in Jerusalem.&#34; It is really incon&#8211; 
ceivable that these words could not have been cm&#8211; 
ployed&#44; if this were to have been the idea intended. 
Yet no such promise is made&#59; on the contrary&#44; &#34; the 
offering of Judah at Jerusalem&#34; is given as the ob&#8211; 
ject of promise&#59; and consequently we have by this 
simple construction a clear and undoubted exposition 
of the whole context. The time&#44; therefore&#44; for which 
the promise was given&#44; is one subsequent to his own 
days&#59; but not alone this&#44; subsequent to our days also&#59; 
for as yet the offering of Judah is not brought unto 
the Lord by purified priests at Jerusalem. So far is 
this from being the case&#44; that our priests and Levites 
are hardly distinguishable from the rest of the peo&#8211; 
ple &#59; and there is no altar now&#44; nor has one been for 
many centuries&#44; sacred unto the God of Judah at Je&#8211; 
rusalem. On the contrary&#44; in place of olferings be&#8211; 
ing there accepted&#44; millions of the people themselves 
have been slain in the cities of Judah and the streets 
of Jerusalem &#59; in place of a joyful coming of the Lord 
to his sanctuary&#44; the very temple which stood during 

<pb n="165"/>

JUDAH&#39;S OFFERING. 165

the prophecy of ISIahichi was levelled to the ground 
and utterly destroyed by the people of the coming 
prince&#44; as foreseen by Daniel. It cannot&#44; therefore&#44; 
be that the time specified has already arrived&#44; or else 
the most essential part of the prophecy&#44; that is&#44; the 
accomplishment of the blessing which tlic prophet 
announced to his hearers&#44; would have remained un&#8211; 
fulfilled&#44; whilst all the terrors of the purification had 
been amply dispensed. We&#44; however&#44; assert that the 
text alludes to a time&#44; when a mighty change shall 
come over the arrangements of society&#59; when the 
reign of injustice and oppression shall be at an end&#59; 
when the God of justice will indeed come with the 
necessary preparation of the angel of the covenant&#59; 
even Elijah&#44; the Tishbite&#44; who&#44; with the messenger 
of salvation&#44; David&#44; the anointed redeemer&#44; shall re&#8211; 
store to their own long&#8211;lost homes the people who 
have for so many centuries borne the weight of their 
transgression&#59; and then&#44; and then only&#44; will the time 
of purification be&#59; and then&#44; too&#44; will the wicked be 
plucked out from the inheritance of the Lord&#44; and the 
righteous alone shall be left to officiate in the awful 
Presence&#44; which Avill then be residing in manifest 
glory before the eyes of all fiesh. 

Having thus fixed the time&#44; Ave will bricfiy elucidate 
the nature of the blessing. We must remember&#44; that 
sacrificing without repentance is an act of heinous 
hypocrisy which otfencls the Lord more than not sac&#8211; 
riiicing. For so says Isaiah &#58; &#34; To what purpose is 
unto me the multitude of your sacrifices &#63; saitli the 
Lord &#59; I am sated with burnt&#8211;offerings of rams and 
the fat of fat beasts&#59; and the blood of steers&#44; or of 
sheep and goats&#44; I desire not.&#34; &#40;i. 11.&#41; Lest&#44; how&#8211;

166 JUDAH&#39;S OFFERING. 

ever&#44; this passage be taken as a repudiation of all 
sacrifices&#44; we will adduce a parallel illustration from 
Leviticus&#58; &#34;And if for all this you will not hearken 
unto me&#44; but walk contrary unto me&#44; then will I lay 
waste your cities&#44; and desolate your sanctuaries&#44; and I 
will not smell your agreeable savours.&#34; &#40;xxvi. 27&#44; 31.&#41; 
This clearly indicates that it is sin alone which takes 
away the acceptability of the sacrifice&#44; but that right&#8211; 
eousness will make it a sweet and agreeable savour. 
Another construction must be inadmissible&#44; since no 
reasonable being could suppose that Moses meant to 
cast discredit upon the institution which he himself 
was ordered to promulgate. It was therefore the 
multitude of transgressions which caused the sacri&#8211; 
fices to cease for a time&#44; not that thereby an atonement 
is denied to us&#44; but that the great aids to devotion 
would not be acceptable&#44; whilst the general state of 
sinfulness continued to defile the house of IsraeL 
But to the individuals composing this&#44; people atone&#8211; 
ment is not denied&#44; forgiveness is not withheld whilst 
they voluntarily seek the pardon of their God by sin&#8211; 
cerity&#44; humility&#44; and repentance. Not to weary you 
with quotations&#44; we will merely cite a single proof 
from the third chapter of Ilosea&#44; 4&#44; 5&#58; &#34;For the 
children of Israel shall abide many days without a 
king&#44; and without a prince&#44; and without sacrifice&#44; and 
without an image&#44; and without ephod and teraphim. 
After that shall the children of Israel return&#44; and 
seek the Lord their God and David their king&#44; and 
they shall fear the Lord and his goodness in the latter 
days.&#34; It requires no extensive learning to interpret 
these words. They picture just such a state as our 
own is at this day &#59; we have neither king nor prince&#44; 

<pb n="167"/>

JUDAH&#39;S OFFERING. 167 

neither sacrifice to the Lord&#44; nor on tlie other hand 
arc we given to idolatry&#59; and whilst no priest with 
the ephod ofliciates for us&#44;Vc are steadfastly refusing 
to adopt the teraphim or idolatry of every and any 
nation under the sun. Nevertheless&#44; says the prophet&#44; 
there are hope and salvation &#59; for after these many 
days of evil are passed away&#44; the children of Israel 
shall return and seek the Lord and David their king. 
Are they to he cast off for their rebellion &#63; or are they 
to be rebels&#63; By no means&#59; they are to seek the 
Lord in sincerity&#44; and consequently they will fear 
Him and be accepted by Him&#44; according to his glori&#8211; 
ous promises&#44; at the very time Avhen they are to de&#8211; 
sire and acquiesce in the mission of the person whom 
their God will send as his messenger. If&#44; now&#44; there 
were no atonement without sacrifice&#44; then would it 
be impossible that this state of acceptance could ever 
take place&#59; but since it is promised as imx&#41;ending&#44; 
Ave must come to the conclusion&#44; that the change of 
heart and conduct which alone made the ofi&#39;ered vic&#8211; 
tim an agreeable savour&#44; will yet&#44; in our dispersed 
state&#44; obtain for the individual Israelite the forgive&#8211; 
ness and salvation of his Creator. But when the 
state of rebellion and sin which iiow characterizes us 
has passed away&#44; when the Lord has again been found 
by us&#44; when the King David truly reigns on earth &#58; 
the obstacles to national acceptability will have been 
removed&#44; and they&#44; who are left of all Israel after the 
millions of sinners shall have been removed and cast 
out from the household of God&#44; will again unite as 
one num in front of the altar of the Most High at 
Jerusalem&#44; and bring there their offering in truth&#44; 
and humility&#44; and righteousness&#44; and call again with

one accord upon their Rock and Redeemer&#44; whose 
glory will then fill the earth&#44; and whose kingdom 
will then subdue every heart and consecrate every 
spirit. In this manner only&#44; and by no symbolical 
atonement or other fanciful substitute&#44; either of times 
past or the present day&#44; can the prophecy be fulfilled 
to which we have clung with so much of hopefulness 
and well&#8211;founded confidence. Indeed&#44; the Word of 
God has never deceived us&#59; and therefore we trust 
in his coming&#44; and that&#44; though fearful the trial for 
each of us&#44; lie will purity the remnant of his chosen 
flock from all who are unworthy of dwelling in his 
fold &#59; and then will assuredly the temple be rebuilt 
upon the spot of Isaac&#39;s intended sacrifice&#44; on the 
blessed hill in the land of Moriah &#59; and there at the 
foot of the altar will all Israel fall prostrate&#44; whilst 
thence will ascend again the smoke of the sacrifice as 
in the days of old and in former years of acceptance 
and national happiness. 

O&#44; may our eyes behold it and our heart be glad&#44; 
and our soul rejoice in thy salvation&#44; Lord &#33; when 
in truth it is said to Zion &#34;thy God reigneth&#59;&#34; for 
thine is the kingdom and unto everlasting wilt Thou 
reign in glory&#44; for we have no king save Thee&#44; who 
are the undying Ruler and Creator of all fiesh&#44; and 
whose providence is from everlasting to everlasting.

But we especially would beseech Thee&#44; our Father 
and King &#33; to have regard to our fallen condition&#44; and 
to look down with compassion upon the sinners of 
thy people Israel. Fill Thou their hearts with an ap&#8211;

the sinfulness of their ways &#59; so that they may feel the

Friends and Brethren &#58; 

We have this day assembled to commemorate the 
fourth anniversary of the institution of a school for the 
diffusion of religious knowledge among the Jewish

inhabitants of this city. The exercises which we have 
&#34;witnessed bear ample testimony&#44; that much has been 
clone to advance the cause in which we are all alike 
interested&#44; whether we are parents or not&#44; since no 
Israelite&#44; be he who he may&#44; can do otherwise than 
participate with heartfelt joy in whatever tends to 
promote a knowledge of the faith of which he is a 
professed member&#44; and which is so well calculated&#44; 
as is this school&#44; to prevent the spread of erroneous 
opinions on matters concerning our everlasting hap&#8211; 
piness amidst the descendants of Israel. If this is the 
case with those who have no ties of consanguinity with 
these young disciples before us&#44; how much greater 
must be the joyful emotion of those who behold here 
some young relative proving by his to&#8211;day&#39;s replies 
that he indeed knows how to appreciate his birthright&#44; 
and ancestral privilege of being numbered among the 
sons of Abraham&#44; the friend of the Lord. And how 
much greater yet must be the happy feeling of those 
who claim in this youthful assembly a son or a daugh&#8211; 
ter&#44; if they be parents who indeed think it a happy lot 
that their God is the God of Jacob&#44; that their faith is 
that perfect truth which has descended down to us 
from a long line of pious ancestors. For they must be 
convinced&#44; and for this consciousness thank their 
Maker&#44; that by the imbibing of religious knowledge 
their children will ever call on the Lord whom alone 
they themselves worship&#44; and cling to that law which 
alone they have received as the everlasting truth 
spread abroad by the Creator of the universe. 

But to feel pleasure in the proficiency of their chil&#8211; 
dren in religious knowledge is not enough to prove 
that parents have a proper appreciation of their duty&#59; 

<pb n="173"/>

PARENTAL EXAMPLE. 173 

for&#44; since bj the will of the Father of all flesh they 
hawe been appointed temporary guardians of one or 
more immortal spirits&#44; something else may justly be 
expected of them than mere joy at the successful 
progress of their offspring&#59; for they must take part 
in the blissful labour to promote this knowledge&#44; they 
must themselves set them the example of righteous&#8211; 
uess in action&#44; which they then may follow to their 
hist day without doubt or uncertainty What is the 
use of children being taught by their teachers to fear 
the Lord&#44; if their parents do not enforce the precept 
tlius given by their conversation at home&#44; and the 
conduct which they exhibit in their domestic arrange&#8211; 
ments &#63; For&#44; if such be the example which the chil&#8211; 
dren witness&#44; they are taught in vain during the 
hours they are under the teacher&#39;s eye&#44; and no holiness 
can take root in the youthful mind. Yet it requires 
no great exertion of the reasoning faculties to prove 
that without religion there can be no happiness&#44; and 
that moreover to the Israelite there can be no religion 
without his drinking from the fountain of living wa&#8211; 
ters erst opened for us on Mount Iloreb by a mightier 
Hand than was the prophet&#39;s&#44; when he caused water 
to flow by his rod from the rock on yonder mount. 
There is no safety for Jacob&#39;s sons and Israel&#39;s daugh&#8211; 
ters but beneath the wings of the cherubim&#44; which 
cover the ark of the covenant&#59; and there is no one 
can place them there with as much ease and eflect as 
their own parents&#44; whom both law and reason counsel 
them to love and to obey. JSTo&#44; the father&#39;s glory is 
not in having a wise son&#59; it is ilot the mother&#39;s hap&#8211; 
piness that she have an intelligent daughter&#59; unless 
the one is quick in serving the Lord&#44; and the other

intelligent in knowing her Maker&#39;s ways. But if this 
end be attained&#44; then indeed may parents bless them&#8211; 
selves that they are not childless&#44; and that they may 
leave behind them those who will perpetuate their 
name and lineage amidst the people of the God of 
Jacob. To do this requires no great amount of in&#8211; 
formation nor a high degree of intellect on the part 
of parents&#59; it is not the most renowned for wisdom 
and learning who are the highest in the kingdom of 
Heaven&#44; nor whose children are the truest servants 
of the Lord &#59; but they&#44; who are sincere in their love 
of God&#44; and who uniformly set before their house&#8211; 
hold the law and wisdom of the Lord&#44; are the per&#8211; 
sons who will be highest among the elect&#44; and whose 
seed will enjoy the highest blessing&#44; that of being 
numbered among those who have a place and a name 
in the house of their Maker&#44; a place which no earthly 
trials and mutations can snatch from them&#44; and a 
name which no calumny can deprive them of&#44; which 
will not perish in the lapse of centuries and amidst 
the subversion of empires. 

The Bible gives us a beautiful example of parental 
piety in the mother of the prophet Samuel. She was 
the wife of a pious Levite&#44; who omitted no season to 
repair to the house of God at Shiloh to make his offer&#8211; 
ino&#34;. With him came his wife Hannah&#44; to whom 
hitherto had been denied the blessing of being a 
mother. In common with others of our people she 
lono&#8211;ed to have a being upon whom she might lavish 
a mother&#39;s care&#44; and to see herself so to say continued 
in a child in whose ejiistence she might claim a share. 
Her barrenness therefore was to her a source of the 
severest grief&#59; and knowing that the Lord could

grant her wish&#44; she earnestly implored his aid in her 
distress&#44; and before the altar of the Most High she 
besought with inward prayer that her sufferings might 
be regarded&#44; and the shame of being childless be re&#8211; 
moved from her. And these were her words &#58; 

&#34; Lord of hosts&#33; if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of 
thy handmaid&#44; and remember me&#44; and not forget thy handmaid&#44; 
but wilt give unto thy handmaid a male child &#58; then I will give 
him unto the Lord all the days of his life&#44; and no razor shall come 
upon his head.&#34; 1 Sam. i. 11. 

We perceive in this vow nothing of worldliness&#44; no 
temporal gain which the pious woman expected by 
the son she prayed for&#44; only that&#44; should the Lord 
hear her prayer&#44; she might have the happiness of see&#8211; 
ing him destined to the service of his Maker&#44; to be 
in fact a Nazir&#44; or one devoted altogether to a life of 
religious observance. The child she had prayed for 
was born &#59; and when the little Samuel was barely 
old enougli to dispense with his mother&#39;s personal 
care&#44; she brought him to the tabernacle of the Lord&#44; 
to be there educated for his noble calling under the 
immediate superintendence of the high&#8211;priest Eli. It 
is not our purpose at present to follow the prophet 
through the various scenes of his eventful life &#59; we 
are not able to add the least to the effective though 
brief history which the Bible furnishes us with &#59; hut 
it is proper that we apply the lesson so beautifully

taught us to our own course of conduct. Picture to 
yourselves the Hebrew mother&#44; her long&#8211;desired wish 
amply gratified&#44; now on the point of quitting her 
house with her son for the tabernacle at Shiloh&#44; The 
greater her love was&#44; the greater must have been the 
sacrifice she was now bound to make in fulfilment of 
her vow&#59; she must forego his innocent prattle&#44; his 
joyous laughter&#59; she must not cradle his head upon 
her bosom when sickness seizes him &#59; she is not per&#8211; 
mitted to rejoice in the dawning of his intellect&#44; in 
the expansion of his mind &#59; only at distant and long 
intervals can she even be allowed to behold him&#44; and 
to pour out the full gushing tide of maternal affec&#8211; 
tion. Yet she grieves not&#44; she rather rejoices that 
she can fulfil the self&#8211;imposed task &#59; for she knows 
that her son is well provided for&#44; since he may dwell 
near the altar of her God&#44; and be there reared by 
faithful and trusty guides as an earnest follower of 
the great Being by whose especial favour he had been 
given in answer to his mother&#39;s prayer. We have 
now the key to Hannah&#39;s wish &#59; it was not&#44; as we 
said&#44; for worldliness that she desired a son&#44; only that 
among the faithful her image might be borne by one 
of their number&#44; her name be treasured by one whom 
she had born and then devoted to God. She knew 
not&#44; she could not have anticipated&#44; that he would 
rise to that eminence of being the accepted prophet 
unto the Lord wdiich afterwards he attained&#44; and that 
her own simplicity of faith and her prayers would be 
chronicled in the record of her people to live for 
everlasting in the memory&#44; and for the imitation of 
all &#59; but the whole context clearly proves that the 
piety of her progeny was all she craved&#44; justly think&#8211;

iug that if her child he pleusing to God&#44; his whole 
happiness would be well secured&#44; and thus the moth&#8211; 
er&#39;s ardent desire for his welfare&#44; both in this life and 
the future&#44; would amply be fultillcd. That this was 
so&#44; we find fully related in the Bible&#44; and more&#44; too&#44; 
than she had had the boldness to ask was also granted&#59; 
inasmuch as by his sincere devotion and piety Samuel 
was selected by the Lord to be his messenger to the 
Israelites on many an occasion&#44; and by these he was 
chosen as their judge in whom they all confided&#44; 
whilst his bodily strength permitted him to hold the 
reins of government. 

Now&#44; let us investigate what gave Samuel the high 
standing among his people &#63; Nothing but his unim&#8211; 
peachable integrity and incorruptible love of justice&#44; 
qualities which marked him as a trusty servant of the 
Lord&#44; and a worthy successor of the great prophet 
who was the instrument of God&#39;s mercy to his people. 
It was not great wealth&#44; which probably he never had&#44; 
nor the great talents with which he was endowed&#44; 
that placed him in that prominent post&#59; for we find 
that&#44; as soon as his sons whom he had appointed to 
succeed him in his lifetime departed from the path 
of justice&#44; his personal influence was not suflicient to 
maintain the delegated powers in unworthy hands. 
The means which raised him to his exalted dignity 
were wanting in his sons&#44; and hence the people&#44; who 
revered the father&#44; refused to tolerate the dominion 
of those who followed not his good example. We 
have accordingly a twofold lesson taught us by the 
history of Samuel &#58; the first&#44; the duty which parents 
owe to their children and society to train them up in 
godliness&#59; the second&#44; that integrity is at length&#44; 

<pb n="178"/>

178 PARENTAL EXAMPLE. 

despite of every other possession&#44; the only quality 
which will carry us creditably through life&#44; which 
integrity consists&#44; however&#44; in the exhibition of piety 
towards our Maker and sterling honesty in our in&#8211; 
tercourse with our fellow&#8211;men. Parents who truly 
love their children&#44; and they who fear of ofiending 
their God&#44; cannot close their eyes to the foibles and 
follies which they ought to be the first to detect. It 
is not well that strangers should be sharp&#8211;sighted to 
punish or to despise&#44; when a little timely advice&#44; and&#44; 
if need be correction&#44; might remove the fault whilst it 
is yet time. It is far better even in a prudential view 
that a friendly hand should punish&#44; than that a cen&#8211; 
sorious world should detect even the existence of a 
failing&#44; though from interested motives it might be 
winked at. It is unbecoming to rational beings to 
be wilfully blind to traits of character which&#44; if not 
early eradicated&#44; must ultimately be the parents of 
vices that will render life miserable to the individual&#44; 
and make him odious to his fellows. Were it that 
such indulgence could render faults unobserved&#44; then 
the weakness of a parent might lind some extenuation 
for not persevering in his endeavours to correct the 
faults of an obstinate child&#44; which endeavours natural&#8211; 
ly produce at times unpleasant domestic scenes. But 
we are mistaken&#44; if we believe that whatever faults 
our friends or ourselves have will not be readily dis&#8211; 
covered &#59; mankind are not unmindful of the charac&#8211; 
ter of their neighbours&#59; and any unamiable qualities 
will surely expose their possessor to contempt and 
hatred. Nothing therefore but a sturdy perseverance 
ought to be exercised towards any and every fault in 
children. If such correction and the necessary ife&#8211; 

<pb n="179"/>

PARENTAL EXAMPLE. 179 

proof produce even unpleasant contentions at times&#44; 
it is evident enougli&#44; that they will become less fre&#8211; 
quent and constantly of a less intense degree&#44; if those 
who ought to exercise authority are determined to be 
obeyed&#44; and if both reason and religion tell them that 
the obedience they exact is strictly conformable to 
piety and moral integrity. There is nothing gained 
by vacillating&#44; yielding at times and insisting at 
others &#59; children detect this foible in their parents 
with remarkable quickness&#44; and are not backward in 
availing themselves of all the tangible advantages 
which such a discovery affords them&#44; in indulging 
their bad passions&#44; and not rarely making their elders 
feel the power of annoyance and tyranny which they 
have by this means acquired. Be warned&#44; parents &#33; 
remember the example of Eli&#39;s sons whom God cast&#44; 
off for their crimes &#59; and that because their father did 
not properly reprove them&#44; he too shared in their 
punishment. Reflect that the great Samuel had to 
submit to the deepest mortification in his old age&#44; 
because of the illegal proceedings of his own children. 
Endeavour&#44; therefore&#44; to counteract betimes any and 
every aberration from the path of right&#44; and insist in 
every instance to meet with a cheerful obedience to 
your wishes and an acquiescence in the blessed re&#8211; 
ligion which is yours. Do not imagine that your 
children will&#44; when they grow up&#44; learn by their own 
experience how to act&#59; some indeed may perhaps do 
so &#59; at least we are not disposed to dispute the possi&#8211; 
bility &#59; but&#44; believe me&#44; that it is not very probable 
that they will submit to any new restriction when 
they grow up. If you wish them &#40;and who being a 
parent would not &#63;&#41; to speak the truth upon all occa&#8211;

sions&#44; insist upon thoir doing so at the very outset of 
life &#59; if you desire them to possess habits of frugality&#44; 
temperance&#44; and industry&#44; teach them these princi&#8211; 
ples from their earliest infancy&#59; and lastly&#44; if you 
have any fear of the Lord&#44; if your bosom at all throbs 
with the idea of God&#44; his goodness&#44; his wisdom&#44; his 
truth&#44; and his law&#44; if you mean it seriously with the 
hope that your sons and daughters should perpetuate 
the name of Israel which you yourselves bear &#58; com&#8211; 
mence at once to instil the like principles from the 
cradle&#44; and teach them day after day&#44; and hour after 
hour&#44; to know the Almighty God of Jacob&#44; to feel that 
He is good beyond our most exalted thoughts&#44; wise&#44; 
and true&#44; and just beyond measure&#44; that his law is 
founded solely and surely upon his wisdom and truth&#44; 
and that no man can possess a greater privilege than 
to be a member of Jacob&#39;s race&#44; by which means he 
is shielded from error&#44; from a belief in a god who 
does not exist&#44; and a law which was not given by the 
Lord. 

But to accomplish this pious system of domestic 
educiition&#44; you must not rely upon your own wisdom 
to accomplish it&#59; but&#44; like Hannah&#44; you should call 
upon the Giver of all grace for aid and counsel in this 
most important task of a parent&#39;s life. Sanctify your&#8211; 
selves by devotion and an entire surrender of your 
hopes and your wishes to the will of your Maker&#59; be 
yourselves earnest in prayer&#44; purify your own hearts 
by self&#8211;examination&#59; and then go to work with a 
cheerfulness that is untiring&#44; and an unflagging reli&#8211; 
ance upon divine aid which does not anticipate to fail 
in its holy task&#59; and thus prepared&#44; thus armed&#44; with 
peace at home&#44; with strong hopes placed above&#44; your

labour will be pleasant and your task more than half 
accomplished. At least&#44; you will have done your 
share&#44; and you will not have to accuse yourselves of 
having neglected to secure your children&#39;s best in&#8211; 
terests in this life and the life to come. What is it&#44; 
if you leave them wealth &#8212; if you transmit to them an 
honoured name &#58; &#8212; if you make not the first a blessing 
by pointing out by precept and example how it should 
be best employed&#44; and show them how to add to the 
other by their own public and domestic conduct. So 
many thoughts crowd at this moment on my mind&#44; 
that I would detain you too long were I to give utter&#8211; 
ance to all I feel&#59; but enough&#44; you understand me&#44; 
and can readily fill up the meagre outline of the pic&#8211; 
ture which I have presented. Only reflect&#44; that the 
best legacy you can leave your oft&#39;spring is your hon&#8211; 
oured name&#44; honoured because of moral integrity to&#8211; 
wards men and a true devotion to God&#44; and the pos&#8211; 
session of a training which will enable them in their 
turn to follow up your example&#44; which will make their 
name likewise honoured when their race is run. Re&#8211; 
llect that Hannah vowed her son to God &#59; as we said&#44; 
she desired a male child by whose worthiness her 
name might be blessed among mothers &#59; and she hes&#8211; 
itated not to fulfil her vow&#44; to surrender her child of 
prayer as a servant at the temple of her God&#44; when 
her prayer had been granted. &#8212; You&#44; my friends&#44; are 
not called upon thus to sever the domestic tie which 
hinds you to your children &#58; still your religion demands 
of you an analogous sanctification round the domestic 
fii&#8211;esidc. Wo have uoav no tabernacle like that for&#8211; 
merly at Shiloh&#44; where your children could dwell in 
the immediate presence of God&#44; under the guidance

of lioly priests juid Levites &#59; but you yourselves should 
Wiitcli over their early education&#44; yes&#44; watch unceas&#8211; 
ingly&#44; to see that no unholy principles are inculcated 
in their minds&#44; and that&#44; with the knowledge of the 
truth which our blessed law gives unto us&#44; they also 
are taught to practise upon every occasion with you 
every ceremony which our religion prescribes. And 
even before such time of action on their part arrives&#44; 
do not omit the duties which are prescribed for early 
intancy&#59; if yours be a male child&#44; do not&#44; if you love 
your souls and his lot in Israel&#44; deny him the right of 
circumcision&#44; which will make him perfect as Abra&#8211; 
ham was made perfect&#59; and if he be the first fruit of 
conjugal love&#44; then redeem him according to the words 
of law&#44; and thereby acknowledge your gratitude to 
the God wdio has shed so manifold blessings upon Is&#8211; 
rael in redeeming them to be liis people from amidst 
bondage and sorrow&#59; and both sons and daughters 
train up from the moment their infant lips can breathe 
forth the name of God&#44; from the very first dawn of 
awakening intellect&#44; to know and to love their Maker&#44; 
so that with every day of their advance into life their 
knowledge of his power and their love for Ilini&#44; be&#8211; 
cause of his goodness&#44; may increase w&#8211;ith their growth 
and strength as they become stronger. In this man&#8211; 
ner you may rejoice over their advancement in relig&#8211; 
ious and scientific knowledge &#59; for thus you have done 
the best in your power to make the first effective and 
the latter of real advantage to them and others&#59; and 
thus&#44; too&#44; you nuiy return sincere thanks to the Lord 
that He has not left you childless&#44; inasmuch as you 
load not your soul with the guilt of corrupting by neg&#8211; 
lect or connivance an immortal spirit&#44; destined like

yourselves to everlasting happiness by the pursuit of 
virtue based on the religion received through Moses&#44; 
which&#44; let me repeat&#44; is the only means by which we 
can attain the felicity of Avhich the prophets speak as 
destined for the righteous who have faithfully obeyed 
the will of their Father in heaven. 

Before I conclude I must say a few words to teachers 
and superintendents of children&#44; applicable to these 
present no less than to all others who undertaivC these 
most important offices. Whether the care is bestowed 
voluntarily or for a price cannot atiect the nature of 
the ol&#41;ligation &#59; but whoever stands in relation of 
teacher is bound to employ every means which ex&#8211; 
perience and skill atibrd him&#44; to improve the minds 
and morals of his pupils. Negligence&#44; slovenliness&#44; 
irascibility and hastiness are alike unpardonable&#59; and 
in many instances it would be far better that no edu&#8211; 
cation should be imparted&#44; than that error should be 
permitted to corrupt the minds of the young by defec&#8211; 
tive teaching. Teachers also&#44; like parents&#44; should set 
a wholesome example to their charges&#44; and not think 
their task accomplished&#44; if a lesson is well recited and 
a subject correctly understood. But above all is this 
required in an establishment like ours&#44; where the 
avowed object is the imparting of religious knowledge 
to our young friends. No doubt the teachers all feel 
their duty to its full extent&#59; let us then hope that 
they will honour the religion which they believe in 
by their conduct&#44; and omit no opportunity to render 
it lovely in the eyes of their pupils&#44; so that they&#44; too&#44; 
may be led by the silent and powerful incentive of 
imitation of those they justly love and revere to tread 
the same blissful path of truth and holiness&#44; the com&#8211;

In all ages since the promulgation of our divine 
law it has shared the fate of all the blessings which 

<pb n="185"/>

THE REBELLION OF KORAII. 185 

the Almighty has conferred on man &#59; it has been tlic 
ol&#41;ject of attack and derision from the ignorant and 
designing&#59; its very hoUness has called forth the bit&#8211; 
terness of bigotry&#44; and the taunts of those who rely 
on their own wisdom &#59; and yet it has ever proved 
itself invulnerable to the shafts of persecution&#44; and 
it has bidden deiianceto the array of argument which 
the unbeliever has been able to bring to bear against 
its truth. Yet so little does this enmity of opponents 
prove anything against the truth of our religion&#44; that 
Moses&#44; in the veracious history of our people&#44; bears 
himself convincing testimony that he and his ordi&#8211; 
nances were alike the mark at which envy and malice 
shot many of their poisonous shafts. Did this fact 
convince him of the erroneousness of his system &#63; 
Did he&#44; because he was often opposed&#44; cease to pro&#8211; 
mulgate&#44; during the remainder of his life&#44; the doc&#8211; 
trines of the Torali&#63; On the contrary&#44; the triumphant 
superiority vouchsafed to him on all occasions con&#8211; 
tirnied him hourly&#44; if such coutirmation had even 
been needed after his glorious and miraculous selec&#8211; 
tion as the prophet of the Lord&#44; that lie was truly 
endowed with the spirit of wisdom and knowledge 
proceeding from on High&#44; the like of which had never 
been conferred&#44; nor ever will be conferred upon any 
mortal &#59; and this assurance then urged him on to 
l&#41;ersevere&#44; till the moment that death sealed his elo&#8211; 
&#40;jiient lips&#44; in teaching on all occasions&#44; before few 
&#58;nul before a whole people&#44; whatever of doctrine and 
duty he had obtained from the Lord in the character 
which had been bestowed on him&#44; that of mediator 
between God and man. Indeed we may maintain&#44; 
that the very opposition wdiich was on several occa&#8211;

sions manifested against the anthority of Moses&#59; the 
many instances of disobedience which are recorded 
on the part of tlie hrst recipients of tlie law&#44; and the 
outbreaks of human passions with which the great 
teacher himself is chargeable &#8212; all tended to exhibit 
the more strongly the truthfulness of the revelation 
proclaimed from Sinai&#44; which&#44; almost unprepared as 
the peoi&#58;&#41;le were for its reception&#44; addressed itself to the 
mind of man&#44; to govern his passions and to restrain 
his desires&#44; in a manner hitherto unknown among 
mankind &#59; since it was more strongly confirmed after 
every trial to which it Avas subjected&#44; despite of the 
dangers that would have destroyed any other system&#44; 
which&#44; not being the immediate emanation of the 
Supreme Wisdom&#44; could not have so established&#44; as 
our religion has done&#44; its empire over the heart of the 
universal mass of mankind. Yes&#44; the heart of all 
mankind&#59; for though there are to this day many who 
know not the Lord&#44; and who have not yet heard of 
the mighty deeds lie has done for the salvation of his 
people and all the sons of Adam&#59; the time is approach&#8211; 
ing&#44; be it by ever so slow steps and ever so gradual 
an advance&#44; when the veil will be rent asunder&#44; and 
the covering which now obscures the eyes of many 
nations will be removed&#44; when they all shall see the 
glorious&#8211; truth of which they now only perceive the 
faint dawning light&#44; which but just begins to redden 
the distant horizon. 

But it needs not my feeble voice to glority the 
beauty of the heavenly bride that shone forth in lier 
virgin loveliness before the eyes of adniii ing millions. 
Every son of Israel whose heart has not been led 
astray to worship at the shi&#8211;ine of a foreign god&#59;

every daughter of our race who glories in lier happy 
birthright in caUing on the One God only in all her 
prayers and supplications&#44; will simultaneously join in 
returning thanks for the undeserved mercy which 
God conferred on Israel to select them for his people&#44; 
to guard the sacred treasure from the rude approach 
of the unclean and the stranger. 

Nevertkeless&#44; it is evident that&#44; while there are 
those who may in verity be styled unclean in spirit&#44; 
and those who are strangers to the truths which are 
revealed in the law&#44; so long will our religion meet 
with opponents more or less violent&#44; as the case may 
be. You no doubt are aware&#44; beloved brethren&#44; that 
they who dwell in darkness always love to see others 
situated like themselves&#59; and no sooner has any one 
embraced a course of life&#44; be it ever so profligate or 
unreasonable&#44; provided always he has only proceeded 
so far that he fears not to let his sentiments be known&#44; 
than he will seek for associates in his pursuits. Daily 
experience proves this in the congregations of wicked 
persons combining for a certain end which they have 
in common &#59; and&#44; by this combining of different mem&#8211; 
bers&#44; plans of iniquity are concocted&#44; and not rarely 
executed&#44; which one man would hai&#8211;dly have dared 
to encompass in his mind&#44; or certainly would not 
have proceeded to venture on their execution&#44; if he 
had even been bold enough to plan them. The rare 
exceptions to this general rule do not invalidate its 
truth&#44; which is demonstrable from the whole history 
of man. But the same facts hold good with regard 
to opinions. Xo sooner does a man embrace a pecu&#8211; 
liar set of views&#44; than he seeks to make converts to 
his side of the question&#59; few men can bear to be in

an inglorious minority&#44; and tliey seek countenance 
to themselves by the overshadowing influence of a 
multitude agreeing with them in sentiment. It is 
owing&#44; also&#44; to this same consideration&#44; that minor&#8211; 
ities are looked upon with suspicion &#59; and any one 
Avho ventures to dift&#39;er from the majority is sure to 
draw upon himself much of obloquy and&#44; not rarely&#44; 
hatred. Few&#44; indeed&#44; there are who will ojienly pro&#8211; 
fess unpopular sentiments&#44; although true in theory&#44; 
or exhibit traits of conduct&#44; however laudable&#44; which 
will cause them to be remarked as persons of singu&#8211; 
lar views and unfashionable deeds&#44; again assuming 
that they are not urged on by the not unfrequent 
motives of attracting public attention by their sin&#8211; 
gularities&#44; or of making converts &#40;a feeling very 
powerful and extremely urgent to many minds&#41; to 
their own opinions. These general ideas which are 
experimental facts&#44; proved by every one&#39;s experience&#44; 
will explain to us the cause wdiy Moses and his suc&#8211; 
cessors the prophets&#44; and the people who follow their 
teaching&#44; have always been exposed to the suspicion&#44; 
hatred&#44; and injustice of mankind in general. For 
Moses taught a new theory in politics and religion &#59; 
he preached it openly&#44; not so much with a view to 
make converts&#44; as to enforce the conviction which 
the people had received from another Source. The 
end of it was that they&#44; whose ideas of &#34;self&#8211;aggrandize&#8211; 
ment were aiuiihilated by the new doctrines&#44; and they 
who were compelled to acquiesce in the rule of their 
late associates&#44; men of their own kindred&#44; and equals 
in everything except their selection by liuman and 
divine choice to their exalted position&#44; became dissat&#8211;

opportunity of outraging the feelings of the best raau 
who was ever raised to authority&#44; and to sow discon&#8211; 
tent in the bosom of the newly organized community. 
Tlie successors of Moses fared no better from those 
whom they were sent to reprove for many an act of 
daring disobedience. It had become fashionable to 
be irreligious&#59; vice dwelt in high places of authority&#44; 
and was unblushingly practised before the face of the 
noonday sun. What business then had some&#44; who 
probably were unlettered men&#44; to put to shame the 
learned and the great&#63; &#34;Why should others of the 
lower order of the people dare to approach the noble 
clad in armour&#44; or defy the king enrobed in purple&#63; 
Add to this&#44; that these same plain&#44; roughly clad&#44; bold&#8211; 
spoken preachers were even more marked in their 
conduct than in their exterior appearance&#44; that they 
not only denounced vice&#44; but exercised themselves the 
strictest virtue and devotion&#58; and we have an abund&#8211; 
ance of reasons to account for the facts&#44; that Elijah 
was a fugitive&#44; Micajah a prisoner&#44; Zechariah slain be&#8211; 
fore the altar&#44; and Jeremiah treated with every indig&#8211; 
nity&#44; not to mention other names noted in Scripture 
who were equally ill&#8211;used by their countrymen. 

And now let us descend from the prophets to the 
people who&#44; though sinning&#44; have still borne their 
testimony to the truth of prophecy &#58; and we shall find 
that similar reasons have ever contributed their eflect 
in rendering them odious &#8212; a strong word&#44; neverthe&#8211; 
less a true one &#8212; to the majority of men. This people&#44; 
we the Jews&#44; have hrmly maintained a peculiar sys&#8211; 
tem&#44; both of opinions and actions&#59; the opinions go to 
reject all adjuncts to the Deity&#44; of every kind what&#8211; 
ever&#44; and the actions are based upon a code&#44; which

many have never ucknowleclged in theoiy even&#44; and 
which others&#44; who have admitted its ti&#39;uth&#44; declare 
abrogated as far as the obligations of positive religion 
are concerned. You can easily understand&#44; brethren&#44; 
how wide a line of demarcation these two points &#8212; I 
mean the difference in opinions and the diversity of 
the acknowledged rule of action &#8212; present between 
us and the gentile world&#59; and consequently the ab&#8211; 
horrence of the vast majority opposed to us is in no&#8211; 
wise a matter of astonishment to one who has paid 
the least attention to the motives which govern human 
nature&#59; since the constant presence of a numerically 
unimportant body of men&#44; contradicting by word and 
action the views of their numerous neighbours&#44; is 
daily exciting more or less acerbity of feeling which&#44; 
if even it does not produce hatred or ill&#8211;will&#44; is .still a 
secret source of an unkindness of sentiment which&#44; 
if it does not reach our bodies so as to injure us in a 
material manner&#44; will yet prevent our religious ideas 
being received with that deference and respect so 
eminently due to their sanctity and truth. The ma&#8211; 
jority does not love to be contradicted by the minor&#8211; 
ity&#44; much less can the multitude condescend to be 
instructed by the few. Now the fact is that our re&#8211; 
ligion does contradict in every point of view&#44; except 
the mere system of moral laws&#44; the ideas of nearly 
the whole human race&#58; of God we have conceptions 
which no other community shares&#59; and our duties are 
prescribed in that holy book which the world at large 
will not receive as sole authority&#59; for even our neigh&#8211; 
bours who believe in its inspiration&#44; its holiness and 
truth&#44; nevertheless assert that&#44; so far as obligaiion is 
concerned&#44; its precepts have long since been repealed. 

<pb n="191"/>

THE REBELLION OF KORAH. 191 

We will&#44; not now stop to inqaire whether the man&#8211; 
ner of this repeal be historically true or otherwise&#59; 
enough&#44; we maintain the permanency of all the bibli&#8211; 
cal enactments&#44; and as such we are in l&#41;old contra&#8211; 
diction to those who maintain the contrary opinion. 
This being the case&#44; it is perfectly consonant with 
human nature that the Jew should be the object of 
suspicion and misrepresentation&#44; not because his ideas 
are wrong or untrue&#44; or injurious to society at large&#44; 
but only because those who ditfer from him are the 
many&#44; whilst his fellow&#8211;believers are both the few in 
numbers&#44; and the unimportant in the political scale 
of society. 

These prefatory remai&#39;ks will disclose to us the 
whole cause of the contentions to which Moses was 
exposed during nearly the whole time that he was at 
the head of the aiiairs of our infant commonwealth. 
You know that he was the first who proclaimed a 
consistent code of laws founded upon the great fun&#8211; 
damental principle of the Unity of God&#44; a doctrine 
which&#44; as said on a late occasion&#44; had been nearly 
overshadowed by the influence of the superstitious 
reverence of the Egyptians for a multiplicity of gods. 
Conse&#40;piently&#44; the people were bidden to separate 
themselves from all other then known nations&#44; in 
ideas&#44; in conduct&#44; and in worship. It mattered not 
that the ideas were the sublimest that ever were 
presented to any descendant of Adam&#44; that the rule 
of conduct was the essence of the highest wisdom&#44; 
and the worship one which ennobled the worshipper 
and exalted him above the level of the ignorant and 
benighted followers of idols &#58; it was enough that now 
they were ordered to be distinct fiom their former

associates&#44; and live apart iu their domestic intercourse 
and intermarriages from those whom they were des&#8211; 
tined to conquer. The end was that a constant rest&#8211; 
lessness was displayed&#44; and a hankering after pro&#8211; 
hibited worships&#44; interdicted enjoyments and illegal 
affinities was manifested. In addition to this&#44; every 
little adversity&#44; every fancied&#44; no less than real hard&#8211; 
ship caused them to regret that they had followed 
Moses into the wilderness&#44; forgetting in their sense&#8211; 
less ingratitude the benefits which he liad been made 
the instrument of conferring on them. So soon is 
weak human nature prone to exalt itself when pros&#8211; 
perity dawns upon us &#33; So soon are we inclined to 
forget in moments of temporary trials the joys that 
were so long enjoyed &#33; So soon do we endeavour to 
magnify temporary difficulties&#44; and deem them insur&#8211; 
mountable&#44; that we may frame vain excuses for neg&#8211; 
lecting the duties which reason and religion demand 
of us &#33; Hence it was that our forefathers deemed it 
a great hardship that so many particular restrictions 
had been laid upon them&#44; which had not been en&#8211; 
joined upon the gentiles. They fancied&#44; therefore&#44; 
that the yoke of Heaven was too burdensome for their 
unwilling shoulders&#44; and they constantly strove to 
imitate the course of Egypt Avhich tliey had left&#44; 
despite of their being warned that the practices of 
that land were odious in the sight of the Lord. Nay&#44; 
when they had been falsely told that the land of Ca&#8211; 
naan&#44; whither they were journeying&#44; was too stronglj&#8211; 
fortified for them to conquer&#58; they altogether lost 
every vestige of confidence iu the guidance of God 
and his servant Moses&#44; and wanted to appoint a leader 
to return to the land wliere galling servitude had

been their afflictive portion. It was not that they had 
any doubt of what tlioir own eyes had boheki of the 
truth of their niiracuhjus redenq&#41;tion from shivery 
and the pul&#41;Uc prochimation of the Decalogue&#44; nor 
that they had not been convinced that&#44; in the contest 
with the Deity which&#44; so to say&#44; their oppressor Pha&#8211; 
raoh had waged&#44; lie and his idols had been signally 
disconilited &#59; but they could not so readily and with&#8211; 
out a violent struggle sever themselves from their 
ancient habits&#44; and erect an insurmountable barrier 
between themselves and their former masters and as&#8211; 
sociates. It was galling to them to l&#41;e alone in their 
worship of One God&#44; just as their descendants to this 
very day are often ashamed to acknowledge them&#8211; 
selves Jews&#44; or carefnlh&#39; conceal their practices under 
the law from the eye of the public&#44; as though there 
were actually some disgrace in the fact of their wor&#8211; 
shipping and acting in accordance with the laws of 
Moses&#44; No one of our present rebellious members 
doubts the main facts of revelation&#44; or if perchance 
a few can be found who actually do so&#44; they to a 
surety do not believe in the dogmas of those whose 
society they seek in preference to that of Israelites&#44; 
and to whom they strive by every means to assimilate 
in speech and conduct. We all know that this was 
highly unwise in our ancestors&#44; and this sinning was 
followed&#44; as the record tells us&#44; by punisliment well 
merited by the apostates&#59; but equally absurd and a 
thousand times more inexcusable is this procedure in 
the unfaithful of our time and country. The ancient 
Israelites had the excuse that the system they had re&#8211; 
ceived as their law was yet new&#44; and inveterate habits 
were not so easily eradicated&#44; except by miracle.

though the law proceeded from God&#44; and its appoint&#8211; 
ed teacher was the greatest i&#41;rophct. But the Jews 
of our own times have heen reared in no other sys&#8211; 
tem&#59; the ideas of our belief are theirs by inheritance 
and descent &#59; the views of idolatry and its temples 
have alike crumbled into dust before its searching 
fire&#59; and the new conceptions of law and doctrine 
which have from time to time sprung up like rank 
weeds in a luxuriant soil&#44; have nevertheless not been 
able to acquire that consistency in arrangement&#44; nor 
that harmony in detail&#44; which we discover in the law 
and philosophy of Israel. And why then do these 
apostates&#44; or these of little faith cast off their allegi&#8211; 
ance to the law &#63; is it not because they do not love to 
be in a minority&#63; that they dread the finger of public 
notoriety &#63; that they sooner sin with the many than 
seek the divine favour with the few&#63; &#8212; But how 
would it be were ours the multitude&#44; could we dis&#8211; 
pense public favours&#44; or could the profession of our 
faith produce wealth and distinction. O &#33; then would 
these timcservers press forward to be the foremost in 
their profession of attachment to Israel and their an&#8211; 
cient mode of worship&#44; they would then he zealous 
among the foremost&#44; and perhaps speak of enforcing 
by penal laws statutes&#44; which now they do not value 
in the least. But whilst we always Avere in a mi&#8211; 
nority&#44; and whilst the state of the world precludes 
the idea of our increasing from without&#44; we wore al&#8211; 
ways subjected to the danger of members quitting 
our communion merely to escape cither the obliga&#8211; 
tions&#8211; of religion and be like the gentiles from a want 
of faith&#44; or to join other persuasions from the more 
sordid motive of a tangible gain&#44; or some personal

These causes continue to operate&#44; whether the Jew 
is free in the eves of the law of the land&#44; or whether 
he is suhject to restrictions for the sake of his hclief &#59; 
tlie motive for joining tlie majority&#44; or to speak in 
proper terms&#44; for quitting the law to gain the stand&#8211;

Avhich&#44; if correctly viewed&#44; our religion confers on its 
members&#44; imagine that he only can roach the sum&#8211;

are few in number&#44; for those who can bring the ad&#8211; 
vantages of a imraerous connexion&#44; wealth&#44; and fam&#8211;

are presented every now and then to our view&#44; and 
it is left with you&#44; brethren&#44; to draw your own infer&#8211; 
ence. Were mine that eloquence which erst burned 
upon the lips of the holy prophets&#44; or that lofty im&#8211; 
agery&#8211; in diction which graced the speech of the 
Psalmists &#58; how would I appeal to you in this place 
to scorn such an unworthy procedure&#44; yes&#44; unworthy&#44;

gentiles&#44; should these bubbles of a moment cut off 
your connexion with your own brothers in faith&#44; or 
lead you ultimately to a desertion of the religion of 
Israel&#39;s house &#33; 

This state of unwillingness&#44; which may be called 
strangeness to truth&#44; or the rejection of what one be&#8211; 
lieves from a motive of gain or aggrandizement&#44; or 
because one fears to be noticed for the peculiarity of 
his views&#44; was the cause of the rebellion on occasion 
of the golden calf and the sending of the spies. The 
doctrines of Moses stood in opposition to the fanciful 
doctrines of polytheism &#59; they demanded a separation 
from the gentiles&#44; and exacted obedience at some 
personal risk and inconvenience from his followers&#59; 
and these&#44; becoming alarmed at the one occasion&#44; be&#8211; 
cause of JMoses&#39;s protracted absence&#44; and in the other 
because they professed not to have confidence suffi&#8211; 
cient in divine assistance&#44; which should enable them 
to conquer Palestine&#44; threw off tlie allegiance they 
had but recently assumed&#44; and their sinning was done 
as a consequence of their being&#44; as yet&#44; strangers to 
the divine rule of the law. But in the rebellion of 
Korah and his associates&#44; what may be called unelean&#8211; 
ness of the spirit&#44; was at work. Envy and malice&#44; 
engendered by the fact that by divine command one 
man had been raised to the everlasting priesthood&#44; 
impelled the discontented to give loud vent to their 
complaints&#44; saying &#58; 

&#34; You assume too much &#59; for the whole congregation are all holy&#44;

THE REBELLION OF KOllAII. 197 

aud the Lord i.s among thein &#59; and why will you raise yourselves 
above the congregation of the Lord&#63;&#34; Numb. xvi. 3. 

It was not now&#44; as on former occasions&#44; that they 
professed a doubt whether the Lord be among them&#44; 
but they asserted truly that the wliole people of Israel 
was an assembly of the Lord&#59; all its individuals had 
beard the precepts of truth proclaimed by the Most 
High himself&#44; and as such&#44; there could be no supe&#8211; 
riority inherent in one more than the other. But the 
rebels made a wrong deduction &#59; it docs not follow 
that&#44; because all are equal&#44; God should not be author&#8211; 
ized to select for himself the most deserving for par&#8211; 
ticular ofSces &#59; because&#44; though all are the same to 
Him&#44; as far as they arc his creatures&#44; this does not 
abridge his right to bring nearer to Ilim for his own 
wise purposes&#44; those whom He thinks most suited for 
this high calling. But even by human reason there 
can be found ample ground for the appointment of 
Moses to be prophet&#44; and Aaron as the high&#8211;priest. 
In their servitude&#44; Moses ventured to smite an Egyp&#8211; 
tian who maltreated an unfortunate Israelite&#59; and 
when the prophet was sent to ask the liberation of 
his people from Pharaoh&#44; we iind that he and Aaron 
went upon this perilous errand&#44; and bid cleliance to 
the tyrant in his own palace. When now the libera&#8211; 
tion had been accomplished&#44; who was so worthy to 
lead the people as their deliverer&#63; who was so well 
fitted to administer for them in the house of their 
God&#44; as he who had shared his brother&#39;s perils &#63; But 
because so much had been given to the people&#44; since 
they had seen the glory of the Lord manifested unto 
them&#44; on more than one occasion&#44; Korah and his band 

17&#42;

198 THE REBELLION OF KORAII. 

professed to doubt tlie authority of Moses in appoint&#8211; 
ing his ekler brotlier to the priesthood&#44; and they ac&#8211; 
cused him of usurping an undue ascendency over the 
congregation of the Lord. You will clearly perceive 
that the whole relation of facts connected with this 
outbreak of discontent&#44; detracts not the least from the 
credibility of Moses or the truth of his history&#59; and 
that the troubles he met with&#44; and the unbelief so 
often manifested&#44; can give no colour to the idea that&#44; 
if all is true as told to us&#44; he ought to have met with 
universal credence from his contemporaries. This 
would have been the case in good sooth&#44; had all the 
people been as much impressed with their duty to 
God&#44; as they had been instructed by the visible dis&#8211; 
play of his power and glory. Yet&#44; since God came 
only to instruct&#44; and not to coerce the will of the peo&#8211; 
ple&#44; human nature was left in its original state of 
proneness to sin and doubt&#59; and hence&#44; many mani&#8211; 
festations of power were required to overcome the in&#8211; 
clination to gentile customs on the one hand&#44; and to 
subdue the aversion which man naturally feels to 
control. The elevation of Aaron&#44; preceded though 
it had been&#44; by the punishment of the worshippers of 
the golden calf&#44; and followed by the death of the false&#8211; 
hood&#8211;speaking men who had been sent to spy out the 
land&#44; could not therefore be submitted to by those 
who conceived themselves aggrieved&#44; till some&#44; who 
had by their daring drawn upon themselves signal 
punishment&#44; had been taken out of the midst of the 
assenibly. The operation of those feelings in our na&#8211; 
ture&#44; love of power and the opposition to injustice&#44; 
degenerated in Ibis instance into envy of those justly 
raised to distinction&#44; and a malicious contempt of the 

<pb n="199"/>

restraint wliicli their liberty had received in the sin&#8211; 
gle point of the privilege to sacrifice at the altar&#44; con&#8211; 
ferred alone on Aaron and his sons&#59; and therefore&#44; 
under pretext of maintaining the dignity of the peo&#8211; 
ple&#44; the most unrighteous accusation was laid against 
their pious leaders&#44; as though they had assumed power 
not properly belonging to them over those who were 
their equals. 

But&#44; as on former occasions&#44; so was on the present 
the messenger of the Lord not left unprotected&#44; and 
as not by the power of human arms was the king&#8211; 
dom of religion established at its first promulgation&#44; 
so was it not now to be supported by similar agency. 
A remarkable feature runs through the whole history 
of Moses&#44; that it was not so much the miracles he 
performed&#44; as the manner which gave them value as 
testimonies of the truth of his mission. There is no 
display of unnecessary wonders in the whole five 
books&#59; no showing ott&#39; of a power superior to man&#59; 
no premeditation or plan to arrange events to answer 
any given purpose&#59; but the whole history seems to 
proceed step by step from the finding of the infant&#44; 
exposed in a frail box on the shore of the Nile&#44; till his 
glorious death as the leader of a new race of men&#44; 
educated under his own cj&#8211;e&#44; and destined to be the 
reformers of the whole human family. The same 
thing is observable on the present occasion. lie had 
sent for two of the malcontents to come to him&#44; but&#44; 
as they refused&#44; he went to their habitation. Yet 
even when their leader had come in this wise unto 
their presence&#44; they refused to yield to the spirit 
which they knew dwelt in him. They bid defiance 
to his power&#44; and stood in front of their tents with 

<pb n="200"/>

all their houseliold. The moment was a critical one &#59; 
it was necessary for Moses either to resiiru his au&#8211; 
thority&#44; and thus confess that he had been a deceiver&#44; 
or announce something to be done in which he could 
have no agency by any probability whatever. I need 
not recapitulate the catastrophe which succeeded. 
The instantaneous fuliilment of the threatened pun&#8211; 
ishment&#44; at the bare speaking of Moses&#44; was of that 
astounding nature which left no room for doubt&#44; and 
thus was the death of the transgressors&#44; they who&#44; 
from envy and malice&#44; from uncleanuess of heart&#44; 
wished to separate the people from their trusty lead&#8211; 
ers&#44; made the instrument of anew athrming that the 
messages announced in the name of the Lord were 
indeed the emanations of the Most High&#44; the true 
words of the only true God. 

The foregoing remarks are merely intended as an 
illustration of the causes which gave rise to the fre&#8211; 
quent murmurings of our ancestors in the wilderness &#59; 
I am perfectly conscious that I have presented mere&#8211; 
ly the outlines of an argument&#59; but Israelites believ&#8211; 
ing in the law need only this to remove any difficulty 
or doubt&#44; which may arise in their study of the holy 
Scriptures. But one observation more for this day&#44; 
and I have done. The same Providence which watched 
over Moses&#44; and caused him to triumph over those 
Avho opposed the establishment of the Torah&#44; is yet 
as active as ever&#59; and the same Power which cast into 
the dust those who rose up to oppose the messengers 
of God&#44; is not weakened by age nor circumscribed in 
its omnipotence. Let us&#44; then&#44; who love the name 
and law of Israel&#44; remain undismayed amidst defec&#8211; 
tions which are of constant recurrence&#44; and arising

either from want of faith or an overweening self&#8211;con&#8211; 
fidence&#59; and let US not arraign the mercy of Provi&#8211; 
dence who leaves sins to go for a long while nnpnn&#8211; 
ished. We have no right to expeci&#58; that retrihution 
shall come instantly upon transgression &#59; equally un&#8211; 
wise is it to doubt of the retribution because it is de&#8211; 
layed. Let the wicked not dream of impunity&#44; which 
does not exist &#59; nor let the righteous doubt of the ul&#8211; 
timate prevalence of truth and the reign of piety on 
earth&#44; because wickedness flourishes awhile&#44; and crime 
reigns triumphant. In his own time the Lord will 
purify his people&#44; and separate from his flock those 
who are unworthy to be his servants&#59; and then will 
joy be everywhere difiused over the earth&#44; and peace 
and good&#8211;will till the hearts of all men. 

Bless and preserve us&#44; O Lord our God &#33; and deal 
mercifully with us&#44; and judge us not according to our 
sinful ways&#44; but according to thy mercy&#44; and because 
of the covenant which Thou madest with our fathers.

202 THE PROHIBITIONS. 

DISCOURSE XII. 

THE PROHIBITIONS. 

To nim who sanctifies Israel with his command&#8211; 
ments&#44; and whose eye surveys all from the beginning 
unto the end of time&#44; be praise&#44; glory&#44; and adoration 
from now and forever. Amen. 

Brethren &#58; 

We read in the law of God as follows &#58; 

&#34;And every winged insect is unclean unto you&#44; they shall not 
be eaten. Every clean fowl you may eat. You shall not eat any 
thing that dieth of itself&#59; thou mayest give it unto the stranger 
that is in thy gates that he may eat it or sell it unto an alien &#59; for 
thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God &#58; thou shalt not seethe 
a kid in its mother&#39;s milk.&#34; Deut. xiv. 19&#8211;21. 

It is well known to you that certain animals are 
interdicted to us to be used as food&#44; and those which 
are permitted are to be eaten only in part&#44; and in a 
manner prescribed by our laws and ceremonies. The 
oi&#39;igin of this limitation to our physical enjoyment is&#44; 
like all other prohibitions&#44; to be looked for in the law 
of God &#58; that is to say&#44; the law revealed by God to 
our fathers contains a specific ordinance which regu&#8211; 

<pb n="203"/>

THE PROHIBITIONS. 203 

hites the permission&#44; otherwise granted to man&#44; to 
employ the llcsh of living creatures for his food&#59; and 
the enjoyment of the same is then permitted only in 
the allowed limits&#44; and becomes sinful if these limits 
are transgressed. The prohibition is too clear to ad&#8211; 
mit of a doubt&#44; for both the practice of Jews and the 
words of Scripture are alike illustrative of the unlaw&#8211; 
fulness of marine and terrestrial animals other than 
those specified as clean. It would appear&#44; therefore&#44; 
at the very first blush of the question&#44; that no Jew&#44; 
who comes to worship in the house of God&#44; who truly 
feels himself to be a son of Israel&#44; could hesitate to 
yield obedience to the precepts referring to this mat&#8211; 
ter&#44; no less than to any other&#44; seeing that the same 
law embraces them with all the other rules prescribed 
to us for our guidance. Times indeed have been&#44; 
when the household of all Jews was by universal 
assent of that degree of lawfulness&#44; that every profes&#8211; 
sor of our ancient faith might sit down at the hospi&#8211; 
table board of any one of his brothers and eat with 
him in the fear of God of whatever was placed before 
him. Every house was then alike in the reputation 
of godliness&#44; unless some positive knowledge of trans&#8211; 
gression could be alleged against it. But to our 
shame be it spoken&#44; this is no longer the case in many 
instances&#59; for a criminal disregard of our religion in 
nuitters relating to household duties has lately been 
frequently witnessed&#44; and the sociulity&#44; once so lovely 
among Israelites&#44; has by this fatal means been well&#8211; 
nigh banished&#59; because the religious Jew lias to in&#8211;

fuse. Why is this &#63; It is becauee men have of late 
not referred to the evident meaning of Scripture&#44; but 
have fancied and devised a mode of interpretation 
entirely their own&#44; by which manner things unlawful 
have been invested with a new character which did 
not belong to them in ancient Israel. Surely&#44; this 
matter is of deep importance&#44; and the house of God 
is a proper place to elucidate it for our improvement. 
Let us take a view of the scheme of the Mosaic 
dispensation as regards things permitted and things 
forbidden&#44; to see what is the foundation thereof&#63; 
only the will of God&#44; who by his word permitted us 
some&#44; and&#44; by the same authority&#44; forbade us other 
things. &#34;When&#44; therefore&#44; anything is denied to us&#44; 
it is not because the origin of the prohibition is one 
thing or the other&#44; which we might suppose&#44; but sim&#8211; 
ply because it is the will of God as expressed in the 
divine code. Kow&#44; the modern transgressors of the 
law of cleanliness fancy to believe&#44; that the Bible is 
not to be understood according to its evident mean&#8211; 
ing&#44; but by some laws of interpretation and by a spe&#8211; 
cies of liberal reasoning not deducible from its text. 
We speak not of those who pretend to be unbelievers 
in revelation&#44; but of those who profess to be Jews and 
avow their determination to obey the Bible &#8212; as they 
understand it. But a human understanding of the 
divine law&#44; arbitrarily assumed by every one who 
chooses to otter an explanation as he understands the 
text&#44; is evidently not the standard by which we ought 
to regulate our lives&#59; for in this manner there wouhl 
be no uniformity in our actions&#44; and no certain stand&#8211; 
ard by which to transmit our faith and our rules of 
conduct to those who are to live after us. Could

thus the law of God bo a sure guide &#63; could thus 
the father teach his son to abide by the law of Moses&#44; 
when a thousand different ways are shown to hitu as 
the right path of salvation &#63; There would evidently 
be a multiplicity of religions&#44; a practical diversity of 
conduct&#44; although every one should profess to abide 
by the same law&#44; with the sole limitation &#34;as he un&#8211; 
derstands it.&#34; It is needless to urge upon your con&#8211; 
sideration&#44; brethren&#44; the self&#8211;evident conviction that 
it was for no such purpose that the Lord could have 
given us &#34;one law and one statute&#44;&#34; which means a 
guide&#44; sure and stable&#44; a fountain ever flowing with 
the same wholesome waters of salvation for all Israel. 
Now&#44; in reference to the domestic prohibitions&#44; 
regarding food and culinary utensils&#44; despite of the 
derision of our opponents&#44; the law has given us spe&#8211; 
cific directions. We are interdicted from eating the 
flesh of the quadrupeds&#44; birds&#44; fishes&#44; reptiles&#44; and 
insects enumerated in the text&#59; we are prohibited 
from eating the blood of all warm&#8211;blooded animals&#44; 
the fat&#44; that&#44; namely&#44; which was burnt upon the altar&#44; 
of all that class denominated domestic cattle&#44; that is 
to say&#44; the ox&#44; the sheep&#44; and the goat&#59; and at last 
the slaughtering of all the permitted quadrupeds and 
birds was to be done in the manner handed down to 
us from Sinai&#44; by which interdict all the flesh of ani&#8211; 
mals killed by a gentile&#44; destroyed by wild beasts&#44; or 
having died of themselves&#44; is likewise unlawful for 
us to eat. But this is not all &#59; the vessels in which 
Ibrbidden food has been placed must undergo purifi&#8211; 
cation according to the ordinance promulgated in the 
thirty&#8211;first chapter of Numbers&#44; 21st to 23d verses&#58; 
&#34; And Elazar&#44; the priest&#44; said unto the men of war

who had gone to battle&#44; This is the ordinance of the 
law which the Lord commanded Moses&#44; Only the 
gokl and the silver&#44; the copper&#44; the iron&#44; the tin&#44; and 
the lead&#44; everytlniig that cometh into the fire&#44; ye shall 
make go through the fire&#44; and it shall be clean&#44; only 
it shall be purified with the waters of sprinkHng&#44; and 
whatsoever cometh not into the fire ye shall cause to 
go through the water.&#34; This is a prohibition against 
the indiscriminate employment of vessels for our use&#44; 
after having been appropriated for the food of gen&#8211; 
tiles&#44; since the clause inserted&#44; &#34; nevertheless it shall 
be purified with the waters of sprinkling&#44;&#34; proves that 
the ordinance of fire and water purification refers not 
to the cleansing of the vessels after having been de&#8211; 
filed by a contact with the dead &#59; for this was to be 
effected solely by the sprinkling with the waters of 
sprinkling&#44; as the ashes of the sacrificed red cow were 
called&#44; for which I refer you to the nineteenth chap&#8211; 
ter of Numbers. One would naturally suppose that 
all the prohibitions alluded to were sufficiently ex&#8211; 
plicit in their tenor&#44; so as not to admit of doubt and 
contradiction. ISTeverthcless they&#44; who always try to 
make the profession of religion one of ease and con&#8211; 
venience&#44; have discovered a ready means to break 
the force of the biblical text by a reasoning and trans&#8211; 
lation of their own. It is this&#58; they profess in words 
the highest veneration for the Scriptures &#59; nothing is&#44; 
according to them&#44; holier&#44; purer&#44; and better adapted 
for the moral government than the Pentateuch &#59; yet 
there is a &#34;but&#44;&#34; an exception as they deem it be&#8211; 
tween the moral or permanent&#44; and the ceremonial 
or temporary. They&#44; forsooth&#44; in this way separate 
the law&#44; &#34; as they understand it&#44;&#34; into essential and 

<pb n="207"/>

THE PROHIBITIONS. 207 

non&#8211;essential. Now for the division. The moral 
part&#44; or the alleged permanent and essential&#44; consists 
of ideas of belief&#44; spiritual worship&#44; and the inter&#8211; 
course between man and man&#44; with perhaps the ob&#8211; 
servance of the Sabbath&#44; as commemorative of the 
creation by the Everlasting One. The ceremonial&#44; 
or the temporary and non&#8211;essential&#44; is said to embrace 
all that they term health&#8211;laws&#44; and acts of personal 
religion&#44; public ceremonies in the temple&#44; and&#44; to 
sum up&#44; all the institutions which concern not the 
moral government of mankind. Whence the author&#8211; 
ity for thus separating the divine precepts has been 
derived&#44; I am not able to divine&#59; but that many pro&#8211; 
fessing Judaism act up to this mode of expounding 
the Scriptures is a melancholy fact&#44; too palpable to 
be denied. But the reason often ollered is this &#58; 
The law was promulgated under peculiar circum&#8211; 
stances&#44; and in a country peculiarly&#39;&#39; constituted by 
the nature of its soil and climate&#59; and that hence 
ordinances perfectly applicable to the distant East&#44; 
fail to be binding on us now who arc so ditfcrcntly 
situated. In reference to the particular ordinance 
before us to&#8211;day&#44; that of abstaining from certain arti&#8211; 
cles of food&#44; or dietetic interdict&#44; it is averred that 
Moses instituted the same as purely a health&#8211;law&#59; 
since the flesh of many animals&#44; together with the 
blood and fat&#44; would prove highly injurious in the 
sands of Arabia and even the cultivated district of 
Palestine&#44; and that all that was meant was to enforce 
such rules&#44; as would be best calculated to preserve 
the health and insure the long life of the members of 
the Jewish commonwealth. In consequence of this 
assumption&#44; they would make us believe&#44; that the 

<pb n="208"/>

208 THE PROHIBITIONS. 

prohibition is not applicable to us who&#44; living in a 
more temperate climate&#44; where neither shell&#8211;fish nor 
the flesh of the swine and the hare are injurious to 
health&#44; niay partake of things the cause of whose 
prohibition does nowise apply to ns. 

The scheme is surely&#44; I will confess it&#44; an ingenious 
one &#59; it first makes religion very easy&#44; and then gives 
a reason why this lightening of&#42; the burden is to be 
viewed as pleasing to God. &#8212; But with all the shoAv 
of philosophical fairness&#44; Avith all the exhibition of 
profound learning&#44; it lacks but one feature to render 
it convincing&#44; and this is nothing else than the stamp 
of truth. &#8212; The Bible&#44; in its own words&#44; does not di&#8211; 
vide itself into the permanent and temporary&#59; it does 
nowhere allege that one command is holier than the 
other&#59; it does not state in so many words that any of 
its laws were to last only for a period and then cease 
to exist&#44; unless they were from their very nature in&#8211; 
tended solely for the time being&#44; such as the killing 
of the first Passover lamb with the peculiar ceremo&#8211; 
nies intended exclusively for the once&#44; and the gath&#8211; 
ering of the manna six days during every week&#44; cal&#8211; 
culated only for the time that our ancestors travelled 
through the wilderness&#44; and&#44; as concerns us of the 
present day&#44; all the regulations with regard to the 
sacrifices&#59; since the whole scheme of otferings and 
priesthood is connected with the existence of the 
temple in Jerusalem&#44; as the place chosen by God to 
let his name dwell there&#44; which evidently means that 
uowhei&#39;e else can such sacrifices be brought. For so 
we read &#40;Dent. xii. 13&#44; 14&#41;&#58; &#34;Take heed to thyself 
that thou offer not thy burnt&#8211;offerings in every place
which thou seest &#59; but in the place which the Lord 

<pb n="209"/>

THE PROHIBITIONS. 209 

thy God shall choose in one of thy tribe&#44; there shalt 
thou offer thy burnt&#8211;offerings&#44; and there shalt thou 
do all that I command thee.&#34; In the second book of 
Samuel&#44; chapter xxiv.&#44; we have now an account of the 
plague which afflicted Israel in the time of David&#44; 
and we read in verse 18&#58; &#34;And Gad came that day 
unto David&#44; and said unto him. Go up&#44; erect an altar 
unto the Lord on the threshing&#8211;floor of Aravnah&#44; the 
Jebusite.&#34; This command was given because&#44; as said 
in verse 16&#58; &#34;And the angel of the Lord was by the 
threshing&#8211;place of Aravnah&#44; the Jebusite&#44;&#34; when he 
was bidden to stay the plague. And&#44; in conclusion&#44; 
we are told &#40;verse 25&#41;&#58; &#34;And David built there an 
altar unto the Lord&#44; and oflered burnt&#8211;offerings and 
peace&#8211;ofi&#39;e rings.&#34; On this spot afterwards Solomon 
the son of David built the house which he consecrated 
unto the Lord&#44; and which our great Father hallowed 
by his glory&#44; made evident by the visible presence 
of the cloud which filled the house&#44; when the priests 
brought thither the ark of the covenant. In this man&#8211; 
ner&#44; I state this merely incidentally&#44; was pointed out 
the spot where sacrifices would be acceptable&#44; and by 
inference they are prohibited in every other place 
upon the face of the whole earth&#59; and consequently 
our dispersion and the destruction of the temple have 
suspended &#8212; mind&#44; not abolished &#8212; the ordinances and 
laws relating to the sacrificial scheme&#44; and the rules 
of the priesthood where they relate to the sacrifices 
only&#59; but all the others&#44; although the priests cannot 
now trace their genealogy&#44; are in full force&#44; and bind&#8211; 
ing upon all whom the public voice hails as sons of 
Aaron&#44; who was consecrated to minister unto the 
Lord&#44; himself and his sons forever as a perpetual line

of priests&#44; selected to stand before the Lord to serve 
Him and to bless in his name. 

But we must leave this matter to be more clearly 
elucidated hereafter&#44; and revert to where we started 
from. &#8212; &#34;We maintain that the Bible can be explained 
only by the words of the context and the manner of 
interpretation as received from our fathers&#44; which is 
at best nothing but an exposition of how they acted 
np to the words of Scripture&#44; no matter what they&#44; 
who do not understand the subject&#44; may assert to the 
contrary. We maintain&#44; farther&#44; that any metliod of 
explaining away what the phraseology employed by 
the sacred writers does evidently imply&#44; is nothing 
else than to destroy all authority of revelation as a 
rule of life. For&#44; if I am permitted to say that the 
precept &#34;Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing&#34; 
means either any disgusting substance&#44; such as spi&#8211; 
ders&#44; reptiles&#44; and food unsightly or nauseously served 
up&#44; or things which disagree with a person&#39;s constitu&#8211; 
tion&#44; without appealing to the context to see what is 
meant by &#34;abominable thing&#58;&#34; I am at liberty to do 
the same with every other precept&#44; and stop short in 
the middle of a verse or text without regarding Avhat 
follows. And&#44; farther&#44; if I can interpret the same text 
to say that it relates to the preservation of my health 
in general&#44; and that under a change of circumstances 
and situations where such a result could not ensue 
the command is inoperative &#58; I have evidently&#39; the same 
authority to interpret in this manner every other text 
of Scripture &#59; and thus&#44; &#34; Remember the Sabbath day 
to keep it holy&#34; might mean&#44; that I may rest when 
my personal interest&#44; which to many persons is their 
paramount rule of life&#44; does not interfere with my 

<pb n="211"/>

resting on a day wliich the majority employ in labours 
of worldly gain and in pursuit of amusement denied 
otherwise to me as a member of the Jewish church. 
So&#44; also&#44; &#34; Thou shalt not commit murder&#44;&#34; must 
mean&#44; if I am not too much provoked by a taunt&#44; an 
insult&#44; or a personal injury.&#42; &#34;But&#44;&#34; say they who 
argue in this manner&#44; &#34; we apply not this rule to 
moral laws&#44; only to those which are evidently cere&#8211; 
monial&#44; and have no bearing upon the inward man.&#34; 
Granted &#59; but how can we prevent every man from 
picking out such rules as the proper moral ones&#44; with 
the rejection of those which others include in this list&#44; 
if we permit any departure from the simple words of 
the Bible&#63; Is it something so unheard of that Sab&#8211; 
bath&#8211;breaking is defended by just such reasons as I 
have given to you &#63; is it something so very unheard 
of that a man steeps his murderous hand in the warm 
life&#39;s&#8211;blood of his fellow&#8211;man&#44; simply because he is of&#8211; 
fended &#63; and when such a deed of violence is perpe&#8211; 
trated before the face of the sun&#44; iu the midst of a 
crowd in the street of a populous city&#44; is not the slayer 
of his brother defended by such a reason&#44; if reason it 
dare be called&#44; that he slew a man&#44; a being created in 
the image of God&#44; because&#44; and simply because&#44; the 
murdered victim had given him some provocation&#44; 
which in the false code of honour as understood by 
men of vile passions and of godless violence is called 
a sufficient cause of homicide&#63; &#8212; Where&#44; then&#44; is the 
safety for the latitudinarian commenting on the Bible &#63; 
where are we to set the limit when once we break

down the boundaries and landmarks which our an&#8211; 
cients have set&#63; &#8212; We say&#44; and this as Israelites&#44; no&#8211; 
where would there be safety &#59; a strict construction is 
demanded&#44; and we cannot explain away&#44; by assigning 
a reason which is not given&#44; any precept which we find 
recorded. 

Now&#44; as regards the prohibited meats&#44; we are asked 
for the reason of the enactment. If we say that this 
is their unwholesome tendency&#44; we must be able to 
make this apparent from the words of the Bible. Yet 
we shall search in vain to find the most distant allu&#8211; 
sion to such a cause &#59; nowhere is it hinted that the 
flesh of the swine or of the eagle would cause disease &#59; 
nowhere is blood prohibited&#44; because it might shorten 
the life of man. And surely if God made this enact&#8211; 
ment&#44; from such a motive&#44; He would have so recorded 
it&#59; and as this record is not to be found&#44; it is evident 
that no such reason influenced our Supreme Legisla&#8211; 
tor. But even suppose that this had been so &#58; where 
do you find a clause limiting the enactment to the 
deserts of Arabia or the fertile lands of Palestine&#63; 
Yet&#44; even yield this&#44; too&#44; we again ask&#44; Are Israelites 
not now residents in lands equally subject to the same 
deerree of heat and excessive moisture as were the 
countries just named &#63; Nay&#44; is not a part of our peo&#8211; 
ple even now residing in the very countries under 
consideration &#63; or is there one law for the Jew of 
the East and another law for the Jew of the West &#63; 
And where will you set the limit as regards geo&#8211; 
graphical position&#44; where the prohibition is to cease 
and the permission to commence &#63; It were easy to 
multiply proofs to exhibit the fallacy of the idea 
which bases the domestic economy of the Mosaic code 

<pb n="213"/>

THE PROHIBITIONS. 213 

upon the preservation of health and life as the osten&#8211; 
sihle reason of its legislation&#44; although it admits of 
no douht that obedience thereto will best promote 
the great blessing of a healthy soul in a healthy hody &#59; 
and since the life we enjoy is a gift of the Lord&#44; the 
true servants of God will not idly or carelessly trifle 
with what He has bestowed on them for his own be&#8211; 
nignant and wise purposes. 

But even inference cannot be adduced to prove 
that Scripture lays down the unwholesomeness of the 
prohibited things as a cause of their interdiction &#59; for 
these are the words of our text &#58; &#34; Thou shalt not eat 
of anything that dieth of itself&#59; thou niayest give it 
unto the stranger that is within thy gates that he may 
eat it&#44; or sell it unto the alien.&#34; Were it&#44; now&#44; that 
meat of this kind should be absolutely unwholesome&#44; 
it would be interdicted to the stranger also&#59; and in 
truth we know&#44; on the other hand&#44; of cases where an 
animal comes to its death by an accident nowise refer&#8211; 
able to disease. And yet there is no exception in fa&#8211; 
vour of such a dying of itself to permit it to the Israel&#8211; 
ite&#59; and in the same manner&#44; since the stranger&#44; too&#44; 
is an object of God&#39;s care&#44; it would be absurd to sup&#8211; 
pose that the law&#39; would encourage us to give him 
food of which we knew beforehand that it would prove 
absolutely injurious to his health or life. But the 
reason assigned is quite a difi&#39;erent one &#58; &#34; For thou 
art a holy people unto the Lord thy God&#44;&#34; meaning 
things permitted to the stranger and alien&#44; who have 
not been sanctiiied by the acceptance of the law&#44; are 
interdicted to the son of Israel&#44; because he is bound 
by the law &#59; and therefore every member of that peo&#8211; 
ple&#44; which has been chosen as the sanctuary of the 

<pb n="214"/>

214 THE PROHIBITIONS. 

Lord&#44; is bound from the reason of his membership to 
call that abominable which the law has so declared &#59; 
not because it is injurious to his health&#44; granted even 
that this should also be the case&#44; but because it is pro&#8211; 
hibited. And so we read in Leviticus xi&#44; 43&#44; 45 &#58; &#34;Ye 
shall not make yourselves abominable with any creep&#8211; 
ing thing that creepeth&#44; neither shall ye make your&#8211; 
selves unclean with them&#44; that you should be defiled 
thereby. For I am the Lord your God &#58; ye shall 
therefore sanctify yourselves&#44; and ye shall be holy&#59; 
for I am holy&#59; neither shall ye deiile yourselves with 
any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the 
earth. For I am the Lord&#44; that l&#41;ringeth you up out 
of the land of Egypt to be your God &#58; ye shall there&#8211; 
fore be holy &#59; for I am holy.&#34; We are here told&#44; first&#44; 
that creeping things are abominable only in the eyes 
of the laAV&#44; and secondly&#44; that they who live under 
the law would be defiled by partaking of them as food. 
We are farther ordered to be holy&#44; because the Lord 
is holy. How is this to be done&#63; Are we to al&#41;stain 
from all worldly pursuits&#63; spend our days in fasting 
and our nights in prayer&#63; are we to shun the inter&#8211; 
course with our fellow&#8211;men&#44; secluded in solitary cells 
amidst the retreats of a rocky glen&#44; an impenetrable 
forest&#44; or the inaccessible sands of the desert &#63; are we 
to be distinguished from other men by the colour of 
our shoes or the fashion of our garments &#63; Indeed&#44; 
if such had been the command&#44; all these things 
or any of them would have been requisites to holi&#8211; 
ness&#59; but the requirements are very different&#58; obedi&#8211; 
ence to the words of the Law is demanded&#44; and this 
one word&#44; obedience&#44; comprises the whole idea of 
sanctilication as ordained by the holy One of Israel.

111 farther illustration we will quote some verses 
from the twentieth chapter of Leviticus &#40;22&#8211;26&#41; &#58; &#34; Ye 
shall therefore keep all my statutes&#44; and all my ordi&#8211; 
nances and do them&#44; that the land&#44; whither I hring 
you to dwell therein&#44; may not cast you forth. And 
ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation which 
I cast out before you &#59; for they committed all these 
things&#44; and therefore I abhorred them. But I have 
said unto you&#44; Ye shall inherit their land&#44; and I will 
give it unto you to possess it&#44; a land that floweth with 
milk and honey &#58; I am the Lord your God&#44; who have 
separated you from other people. Ye shall there&#8211; 
fore put difference between clean beasts and unclean&#44; 
and between the unclean fowls and clean&#59; and you 
shall not make your souls abominable by beast&#44; or by 
fowl&#44; or by any manner of living thing that creepeth 
on the ground&#44; which I have separated unto you as 
unclean. And ye shall be holy unto me &#59; for I the 
Lord am holy&#44; and have severed you from other peo&#8211; 
ple&#44; that ye should be mine.&#34; In this passage&#44; the 
vocation of Israel is clearly pointed out. The holy 
God&#44; whose eyes survey all from the birth of nature 
to her death&#44; has from the multitude of families of 
man severed one nation&#44; and this a people few in 
number&#44; to be his chosen treasure&#44; that they might 
be the witnesses of his glory and power. These fa&#8211; 
voured men were not to act like others&#44; and do as 
they please&#44; and live only for the gratification of their 
sensual desires&#59; but they should be limited&#44; circum&#8211; 
scribed&#44; and hedged in by ordinances which He&#44; who 
had sanctiiied them to his service&#44; might find useful&#44; 
both for their temporal and everlasting welfare. He 
wanted to sever them from the mass of idolatry and

unbelief&#44; and from those who worship not tlic &#33;Most 
Holy&#44; and who regard not his law. Acts of kindness 
towards every man lie enjoined upon his servants&#59; 
they should show mercy to the stranger who came 
to their land&#44; and even to the bondman who should 
flee thither from his master&#59; but they should be pre&#8211; 
served from a too close union with those who were 
not Israelites&#44; and this should be effected by barring 
them from a partaking of the food which was by Ilim 
interdicted and mingling with gentiles in wedlock. 
The latter prohibition we all know is not to be 
ascribed to an inferiority of the races&#44; either in bodily 
or mental endowment&#59; but only to the danger of 
misleading those who intermarry with strangers from 
the adherence to the One God. This is the sole ba&#8211; 
sis&#44; as we find frequently recorded&#44; of several ordi&#8211; 
nances&#59; and so also is the domestic arrangement of 
Israel ascribable to the ordinances of their mighty 
King&#44; who forbade them many things to others per&#8211; 
mitted&#44; that they might be preserved in the path of 
righteousness in which He desired them to travel. 
This is evidently the meaning of the words which I have separated unto you as un&#8211; 
clean&#44;&#34; not as the common version has it&#44; &#34; which I 
have separated from you &#59;&#34; and it says accordingly&#44; 
that the interdict is not from any inherent evil in the 
flesh of the swine&#44; or eagle&#44; or shark&#44; or crocodile &#59; 
but because these animals have been separated from 
the mass of permitted things as unclean to the house 
of Israel. 

If this view is the evident deduction from the lan&#8211; 
guage of Scripture&#44; and that it is so is borne out by 
the authority not alone of the words themselves&#44; but

by the assertion of the great luminaries of our people 
down to our own days &#58; it follows that the obligation 
of abstinence promulgated by Moses&#44; is not weakened 
by the change of territory and climate to which we 
as a nation have been subjected. We are yet a peo&#8211; 
ple separate and distinct from the nations of the earth&#59; 
in our worship we call yet upon the same God who 
spoke audibly to our fathers at Ur and at Sinai&#59; and 
as yet all sons of men do not call upon Him with one 
voice and with one accord. Where then is the infer&#8211; 
ential permission to go and eat with the gentiles of 
things not permitted to us&#44; of food separated unto 
Jacob as unclean &#63; It is unworthy of rational beings 
to be so wedded to mere brutal enjoyment&#44; that they 
cannot overcome a passing inclination for things which 
are only calculated to gratify the palate &#59; it speaks but 
little of self&#8211;culture in any individual&#44; if he must fly 
to prohibited food in the midst of plenty&#44; in the midst 
of the thousands of objects which are ready to sus&#8211; 
tain life and strength. And still such must be the 
motives which counsel a transgression&#44; seeing that 
the breaking down of the law by iufcrring a reason 
which is not given nor hinted at&#44; is both unscriptural 
and against every sound rule of argument and inter&#8211; 
pretation. 

It is therefore incumbent upon every Israelite to 
regard well the law in this respect no less than in 
matters of&#44; what the world calls&#44; graver import&#44; though 
to us&#44; as cliildren of the law&#44; every precept is equally 
holy&#44; since the whole Pentateuch is the emanation of 
the same wisdom. &#8212; We should reflect that&#44; whereas 
the whole world is the Lord&#39;s&#44; we are also subject to 
his uncontrolled disposal. Farther&#44; that every per&#8211;

mission is derived from llini&#44; and that consequently 
there is intrinsically no hardsiiip in his denying us 
whatever He deems unclean. Our aim should be the 
attainment of holiness&#44; because lie our God is holy&#59; 
this can be done only through obedience. That ser&#8211; 
vant is&#44; however&#44; not obedient who follows his master 
only when he understands clearly the reason of the 
order he has received&#44; or when it suits his fancy or 
convenience to obey. Even so is it with us&#59; we. have 
received mandates of various kinds from our heavenly 
Master &#58; of some we know the reason why &#33; of others 
we do not&#59; some may interfere with our personal con&#8211; 
venien&#40;&#33;e&#44; whilst others are pleasant and easy of exe&#8211; 
cution. If then we wish to excel in our striving for 
the attainment of Ins gracious favour&#44; we should im&#8211; 
plicitly obey his behests without asking the motives 
of their enactment&#59; enough for us to know that the 
Lord commands&#44; and it is ours to listen submissively. 
One effect this will have upon us above mere me&#8211; 
chanical obedience&#44; is the attainment of more spiritual 
light as we proceed onward in righteousness&#59; so that 
things once obscure to us in the outset of our career 
will become luminous with wisdom and light&#44; even 
as the sun sheds more warmth and eflulgence as he 
ascends from his rising to his meridian height. If 
all our brethren act so&#44; if naught but dire necessity 
ever induces them to transgress&#58; how sweetly&#44; how 
unitedly will the household of Israel then dwell. &#8212; 
Every table will be permitted to all alike&#59; the fear of 
God will preside in every domicil&#44; and as the old 
men and the lisping infants gather around the social 
boards&#44; the anthem of praise may becomingly ascend 
on high as though the very place for earthly enjoy&#8211;

And why shonld this not be&#63; is not the whole earth 
full of liis glory&#63; is not his presence felt by the hum&#8211; 
ble and pious in every spot&#44; in every relation of life&#63; 
and why then should his service be absent when we 
sit down to refresh and invigorate our bodies by the 
food which his bounty alone has provided for us&#63; 
Yet how can this be fittingly done&#44; if we&#44; in disobe&#8211; 
dience of the will of the Lord&#44; taste of things wdiich 
He forbids to us&#59; if we by our sinfulness tell Him that 
we wish not holiness in the manner He prescribes the 
same as attainable by us &#63; O then will his presence 
not be felt in our homesteads&#44; and his grace will not 
consecrate the viands He has created but not for us &#33; 
But if we serve Him in our daily avocations&#44; as well 
as in great matters &#59; if every step of life is regulated 
by his will&#59; if we seek his favour by every attainable 
act of obedience&#59; if his word&#44; his law&#44; his promises 
are ever before our eyes&#44; ever impressed on our spirits &#58; 
then will holiness be indeed within our reach&#59; and 
when at the conclusion of our repast we raise the 
cup full of wine to bless the Lord for his grace&#44; good&#8211; 
ness and mercy with wdiich He sustains all the crea&#8211; 
tures which Ho has created in his abundant kindness&#44; 
we have in truth brought an oflcrina&#59; bcfittins&#58; children

ceptance of the universal Father of all&#59; and thus will 
daily and hourly be drawn closer the bonds wdiich

among the children of thy covenant&#44; even the house 
of Israel whom thou hast redeemed to be thine&#59; and 
lot thy glory fill the places whither they resort&#44; in 
all their dispersions to ascribe honour and praise to 
thy blessed name&#44; which is exalted above all bless&#8211;

Brethren &#33; 

How exalted were the feelings&#44; and how ardent the 
desire which animated the heart of the holy singer&#44; 
when he burst forth in praise of the delights he hoped 
to experience in the house of his God &#59; and how must 
he have felt gratified when&#44; having&#8211; beheld the crown 
of glory dwelling on Zion&#44; he found all his expecta&#8211; 
tions more than fullilled by the reality of the great&#8211;

ness far exceeding the excited imagination of antici&#8211; 
pated bliss. For&#44; at the happj time when he lived&#44; 
there was yet one temple&#44; whither all Israel resorted 
to adore the Most High in the beanty of holiness and 
unity &#59; and there was one altar where their God was 
pleased to accept their ofi&#39;erings and their prayers. 
And this was the place where the one people&#44; selected 
as the guardian of the covenant&#44; dwelt as a light to 
the njitions and as a beacon to those who walked 
in darkness &#59; and they therefore&#44; who&#44; like the sons 
of Korah&#44; were privileged to watch at the gates of 
the sanctuary&#44; drank in to fulness the great eifulgence 
of light&#44; and the ecstacy of being surrounded with a 
thousand tokens of their Maker&#39;s power&#44; with a thou&#8211; 
sand proofs of his mercy and goodness. It was not&#44; 
therefore&#44; the great splendour of the temple&#8211;structure 
v.&#39;hich he describes&#59; he dwells not in terms of admi&#8211; 
ration upon its magnificent architecture&#44; its columns&#44; 
its almost wonderful I&#39;abrics of brass and gold&#44; its 
thousand decorations which were the admiration of 
all the earth&#44; and which had engaged&#8211; an entire peo&#8211; 
ple almost to rear and to elaborate&#44; but he refers to 
the internal holiness&#44; the soul&#8211;tranquillizing power 
which the pious there could experience. And these 
are his words&#44; Avhich&#44; for sweetness&#44; are unsurpassed 
in any writing of any people &#58;

&#34; How lovely are thy tabernacles&#44; O Lord of hosts &#33; my soul de&#8211; 
sireth&#44; yea&#44; it longeth for the courts of the Lord &#59; my heart and my 
flesh join in singing praises unto the living God. Even the spar&#8211; 
row hath found a house&#44; and the swallow a nest for herself&#44; where 
she may place her young in thy altars&#44; O Lord of Hosts&#44; my King 
and my God &#33; Happy are they who dwell in thy house&#44; continu&#8211; 
ally they will praise Thee. Selah.&#34; Psalm Ixxxiv. 2&#8211;5. 

The Psalmist thus shadows forth his deli2&#58;ht at the 
thought of revisiting the sanctuary of his God&#44; and 
exhibits to us the causes which awaken this pleasur&#8211; 
able emotion. We have said already&#44; that it was not 
the elegance of the structure which filled his imagi&#8211; 
nation&#44; but the association of holiness and truth Avhich 
tend jointly and separately to elevate the mind above 
the level of earthly things and transient enjoyments&#59; 
it was not the splendid temple&#44; but its being the tab&#8211; 
ernacle of his God&#44; which called forth the Psalmist&#39;s 
admiration. His soul&#44; he says&#44; longeth for the courts 
of the Lord&#59; for there he can devote his heart to 
meditate on the great power of the Lord&#44; on his wis&#8211; 
dom&#44; on his mercy. All the feelings of devotion 
will vibrate in unison&#44; where the whole object of 
everything around him is the glory of God&#44; and the 
promotion of trust in his goodness&#59; and praise there&#8211; 
fore will spring fo&#41;&#34;th spontaneously from lips glow&#8211; 
in&#42;&#39;&#8211; with the enthusiastic love&#44; by which the heart is 
filled. The hymn thus uttered will not require the 
slugirish prompting of a tardy will&#59; the bending of 
the knee will not be the mechanical action enforced 
by human authority&#44; as a token of conformity to the 
popular religion. O no&#33; there where God evidently 
dwells&#44; a holy shower will&#44; so to say&#44; moisten with 
its refreshing drops every one subject to its influence&#59;

a rushing onward to be foremost among the most 
zealous will characterize every one&#44; who means in 
truth to be a servant of the glorious Essence&#44; whom 
we term the living God&#44; the Undying&#44; Everlasting&#44; 
the Holy One of Israel &#33; And then in his presence 
all is peace&#44; all is joy &#33; Yea&#44; the sparrow may find his 
domicil under the caves of the Lord&#39;s house&#44; and the 
swallow can securely lodge her young under the shel&#8211; 
ter of his altar&#59; for no rude hand will there disturb 
the innocent nestlings which claim their food from 
the Lord of all&#44; who pours out in abundance his 
bounty to the towering forest ox&#44; and the humming 
insect that glances like a point of light in the beams 
of the sun. Yea&#44; peace is there&#44; and harmony rules 
there&#44; if they who come to worship feel their insig&#8211; 
nificance&#44; in comparison with the Being whom they 
come to adore&#59; if man truly is conscious&#44; that in the 
presence of his jS&#39;Iaker he is weak&#44; powerless&#44; and 
corrupt&#59; if he of limited intellect will but deign to 
bow in submission to Ilim who gives wisdom to the 
wise&#44; and who sees and searches the heart. For they&#44; 
who thus act&#44; will indeed imagine themselves in the 
house and at the table of their King &#59; to whom rever&#8211; 
ence is meet&#59; to whom appertain majesty and glory&#59; 
before whom strife and discord are unseemly exhibi&#8211; 
tions of traitorous neglect in his service&#59; since where 
all are servants&#44; where all are alike in mortality&#44; in 
accountability&#44; in dependence&#44; it behoves no one to 
raise himself above his fellows&#44; and to assume an 
authority which beiongs alone to the Immortal&#44; and 
in which the perishable sons of earth have no share. 
They will&#44; moreover&#44; be alive to the consideration 
that this King is their God&#44; whose power is not Ha&#8211;

Lie to decay&#44; whose wisdom is not subject to the cor&#8211; 
roding influence of the tooth of time&#44; before which 
all delegated poAver is sure to crumble&#58; but they will 
be&#39; impressed with the solemn conviction that what&#8211; 
ever is done at any moment of time&#44; be it virtue&#44; be 
it vice&#44; will always live in his memory&#44; to be recom&#8211; 
pensed by weal or by woe&#44; whenever the hour of re&#8211; 
ward has come&#44; whenever the moment of retribution 
has arrived. Such a worsliip of the Most High is not a 
degrading servitude&#59; it is not one which enslaves the 
mind&#44; or throws superstitious trammels over the free 
spiritual essence implanted in man &#59; on the contrary&#44; 
it is a pleasant converse with the Supreme Father&#44; a 
return&#44; as far as the creature can ofl&#58;er it&#44; for the 
many benetits which have been heaped upon it from 
the moment it first entered into life. And the place 
where we obtain the greatest amount of incentives 
for this service&#44; is&#44; of all others&#44; the one we should 
desire to visit&#59; and hence&#44; lovely must be the taber&#8211; 
nacle&#44; desirable the courts&#44; where meet as one the 
noble band who have consecrated their days&#44; not to 
the pursuit of selfish gains&#44; not to the acquisition of 
worldly goods&#44; and a perishable renown&#44; but to the 
spreading of good&#8211;will among men&#44; and the extension 
of the glory of their God. Happy&#44; therefore&#44; are all 
those who dwell in the house of God&#44; who resort 
thither to confirm themselves&#44; and to assist in con&#8211; 
firming others in the upholding of the sublime truths 
which they have received&#59; in eradicating the errors 
of a faulty education&#44; to which&#44; untortunately they 
may have been subjected&#44; and in wanling olf the 
approach of perverted ideas of God and worship 
which may&#44; perchance&#44; have been imbibed from an

intercourse with the world and men of sin. And 
wlien these results&#44; applicable to the various classes 
of worshippers&#44; have been obtained&#44; then&#44; indeed&#44; 
will praise ascend on high from souls filled with heav&#8211; 
enly lire&#44; from spirits touched with the light which 
alone springs from God. And wdien from youtli till 
age&#44; from the dawning of intellect till the hour of 
death&#44; the same unvarying course has been pursued&#44; 
if the dwelling in God&#39;s house has not been merely 
for the one hour&#44; for the one day&#44; for the one year&#44; but 
constantly renewed at every epoch of life &#58; how bliss&#8211; 
ful will then be the permanence of this abiding&#44; how 
grateful the hymn which arises continually from lips 
burning with the holy inspiration of truth derived 
from God&#44; of wishes centring all in the Lord&#44; of 
hopes which alone can be fulfilled by Him&#44; &#8212; by Ilim 
who is the same in youth and in age&#44; who supports 
us by our hand at the moment when the infant first 
opens his eyes to the light and beauty&#44; and shades&#44; 
and joys&#44; and sorrows of this life&#44; and when the 
trembling soul shrinks within herself at the moment 
when racking pains rend the tenement of clay&#44; and 
bid the spirit to flee away to the place whence it 
sprung&#44; the fountain of life&#44; wdiich it&#8211;&#33; in the presence 
of Him&#44; our living Father. 

Well was the sanctuary on Ziou calculated to awak&#8211; 
en these thoughts in the minds of our forefathers. 
For there were the prophets who spoke the truths 
they had received in the hearing of a mighty people&#44; 
made mighty by the possession of the law under 
which they lived in security. And there were the 
incentives to piety appealing momentarily to the souls 
of all. Just as the law commanded&#44; so was the wor&#8211;

ship organized. There was the altar of burnt&#8211;offering 
which a hundred priests daily surrounded to make 
atonement for the people in whose behalf they ad&#8211; 
ministered. Tliere was the golden altar&#44; whence 
morning and evening ascended tlie smell of the sweet 
incense made&#44; in strict conformity to the ordinance of 
the law&#44; by skilful and obedient hands. There&#44; too&#44; 
were the orders of Levites who&#44; with their high&#8211;sound&#8211; 
ing instruments and uplifted voices&#44; made the courts 
of the Lord vocal with the melodies derived from 
David&#44; from Ethan&#44; from Assaph&#44; the sons of Korah&#44; 
and other children of song&#44; melodies yet unrivalled&#44; 
from which poets of all ages have caught the lire of 
inspiration&#44; and which all the world has adopted as 
its vehicle of praise. There were likewise the courses 
of the people to appear daily as the delegates of all 
Israel to witness the offerings made for all the land&#44; 
at the place which the Lord had chosen to let his 
name dwell there. Here also sat that august assem&#8211; 
bly of the wisest and best of our then happy country&#44; 
who dispensed the knowledge of that law which was 
the study of their lives&#44; and by the decision of whom 
all the people were governed. At that time too the 
profession of our religion carried with it no disgrace&#44; 
no stigma&#59; the name of Israel was not a byword&#44; the 
name of Jew was no term of reproach. No induce&#8211; 
ment of worldly gain tempted to a violation of the 
Sabbath&#44; no prospect of political preferment counsel&#8211; 
led the ungodly or the wavering to deny his Jewish 
lineage&#44; or to ibrswear publicly the laith which nis 
fathers had taught him. But thrice every year all 
the sons of Israel&#44; as one&#44; flocked together to offer up 
their orisons&#44; and to bring their offerings before the

shrine wliere tlie tables of the covenant were depos&#8211; 
ited &#59; thrice every year they renewed in the conrts 
of their God the political bond of union which made 
them one people. It is therefore easy to imagine&#44; 
how an ardent follower of the Mosaic law must have 
felt when the season came round again&#44; when he 
should appear at Jerusalem &#59; how already many days 
before the appointed time&#44; at the shore of the great 
sea&#44; at the foot of Carmel&#44; on the summit of Tabor&#44; 
in the shades of Lebanon&#44; and on the margin of the 
Arabian Gulf&#44; in fertile plain or in sterile wilderness&#44; 
he pictured to his mind the multitudinous throng 
clustering together upon every road&#44; from every ave&#8211; 
nue of our happy&#44; peaceful land&#44; the torrent swell&#8211; 
ing every hour&#44; increasing imperceptibly every mo&#8211; 
ment&#44; till with a host of flocks and rich gifts&#44; with 
banners weaving in the wind&#44; with music&#44; lulling the 
spirit&#44; springing from a thousand tubes&#44; answered by 
a thousand harps&#44; echoed by millions of voices&#44; the 
mighty army burst with its interminable length and 
its countless hosts into the rejoicing streets of the 
glorious Jerusalem&#44; an army that came not to con&#8211; 
quer&#44; but to do homage to the great King who sat 
enthroned&#44; invisible among them yet felt&#44; and known 
and acknowledged by all&#44; on the spot sacred to mira&#8211; 
cl&#40;&#33;s&#44; hallowed by a thousand mercies&#44; the hill of 
Moriah&#44; the centre&#44; the glory of all the earth. Well 
might the poet sigh if this spectacle were denied him 
to witness&#59; well might he exclaim&#44; &#34; How lovely are 
thy tabernacles&#44; O Lord of Hosts&#33;&#34; when he was 
among the glad array in the holy courts&#44; especially 
if it was the first time that he was permitted to ad&#8211; 
minister with his brothers at the altar&#44; and to drink

in deeply the enthusiastic devotion which animated 
so many around hhii&#44; who all were intent only on 
worshipping God&#44; the One&#44; the Immortal&#44; the Ever&#8211; 
lasting&#44; and on sealing with the whole tenor of their 
life their claim to the brotherhood in the house of 
Israel. 

But now&#44; alas &#33; the busy throng fills no longer the 
highways of Palestine&#59; the ark of the covenant is 
taken away from us&#44; and the crowd of worshippers 
has vanished from the temple&#44; which has fallen a 
prey to the devouring flame which the enemies of 
our name kindled in the holy place of our God. Were 
it now&#44; that the Psalmist&#39;s desire had only been 
kindled by the outward splendour of that house&#44; and 
by the pomp and grandeur arising only from the 
peaceful state and political importance of our nation &#58; 
then indeed would we have nothing left to awaken 
in our hearts&#44; in our state of captivity and dispersion&#44; 
a desire akin to his desire. But independently of the 
outward attendant circumstances which gloritied the 
temple&#44; there was a something which was inherent in 
its very nature&#44; and was not liable to the destruction 
which awaited it so soon as the people&#44; who had 
reared it in honour of God&#44; forsook the law which He 
had given them. This something was the fact&#44; that 
it was a structure consecrated to the Creator of the 
world&#44; whose abiding is not limited to walls reared by 
human hands. It is true that the site of the temple 
was the place chosen for the dwelling of his name&#44; 
where alone He ordained that our sacrifices should be 
ofl&#58;&#39;ered. But it is also true that He is nigh unto us 
in whatever place we call upon Ilim &#59; for all the earth 
is the seat of his glory. So&#44; then&#44; at the time that the 

<pb n="229"/>

THE SANCTUARY. 229 

temple yet stood&#44; people were not confined to its 
precincts alone for prayer and religious assemblies&#44; 
or else the periods of devotion and instruction would 
have been too few and limited in usefulness. They 
however met Aveekly at least to pour out in a com&#8211; 
mon assembly&#44; each one for himself and through a 
chosen organ&#44; their wishes before the throne of Grace&#44; 
and to have the law of God read aloud to them for 
their information&#44; and to listen unto such admoni&#8211; 
tions as they Avho were familiar with the ordinances 
addressed to their consideration. The periodical re&#8211; 
unions in the temple were to renew at every recur&#8211; 
rence of them the connecting link which made all 
Israel one people &#59; but the weekly and daily meetings 
for prayer and instruction were for the constant feed&#8211; 
ing of the sacred fire&#44; which our religion should kindle 
ever and anon in the heart of every son of Israel. 
Hence probal&#41;ly the Psalmist does not say&#44; &#34;How 
lovely is thy tabernacle&#44;&#34; by which the one great 
house would have been conveyed&#44; but &#34; how lovely 
are thy tabernacles&#44;&#34; evidently indicating every place 
of assembly for the glory of God&#44; though inferior in 
dignity&#44; and entirely void of the splendour which dis&#8211; 
tinguished the dwelling of the Lord at Jerusalem. 
&#34;When then the outward grandeur was taken away 
by the irruption of the gentiles into our lovely in&#8211; 
heritance&#44; the presence of the God of Israel was not 
thereby removed &#59; He does not&#44; indeed&#44; manifest 
himself openly before our eyes&#44; the evidence of his 
favour does not fill outwardly the places we consecrate

shield us &#63; Do we not continue the minor assemblies 
for the glorification of our Father&#63; is not his law yet 
proclaimed in our meetings on the Sabbaths and ap&#8211; 
pointed seasons &#63; do we not attest here&#44; again and 
again&#44; our firm adherence to the law He has pre&#8211; 
scribed as our rule of action. &#8212; It is therefore in our 
power&#44; though in a minor degree&#44; to share the long&#8211; 
ing of the Psalmist for the courts of our God &#59; we too 
can feel ourselves lifted up above the things of the 
earth by a resort to his dwelling. We have the assur&#8211; 
ance that He &#34;will be to us a small sanctuary in the 
lands whither we shall have been scattered for our 
sins&#44; as lie spoke through his prophet Ezekiel at a 
time&#44; when&#44; through our transgressions&#44; the temple was 
burnt&#44; and our people carried away captive&#44; few only 
being left&#44; through means of the destruction which 
the enemy&#39;s sword hud Avrouglit among us. It was 
then&#44; I say&#44; that He promised to dwell among us in 
the minor sanctuaries which we might dedicate to his 
worship&#59; and thus&#44; as in the temple of old&#44; it will not 
be the elegance of the building&#44; not the splendour of 
columns and ornaments&#44; not a thousand bright lights&#44; 
nor the harmony of song or instruments&#44; which will 
constitute the holiness of the places of our gathering&#44; 
but the spirit of the Lord which is among us&#44; when 
we are assembled in sincerity&#44; truth and humility to 
sacrifice our souls as a willing offering to his service&#44; 
and to open our hearts in prayer to his all&#8211;seeing eye. 
If the preservation of our race throughout all the trib&#8211; 
ulations to which it has been subjected be any evi&#8211; 
dence of this holy Presence &#59; if the fact that at every 
emergency in our history&#44; since our captivity com&#8211; 
menced&#44; wonderful men have arisen as though they

had been prompted by an inward spirit to guide tlieir 
less favoured brethren&#44; when apostacy was forced upon 
us by the persecution of the gentiles&#44; or when a dere&#8211; 
liction from the righteous way became general through 
the natui&#8211;al proneness of man to sin&#44; be a sure token 
that the Lord is in the midst of our assemblies&#44; and 
who can deny it&#63; then&#44; indeed&#44; have the blessed 
promises of which we speak been literally accom&#8211; 
plished&#44; yes fulfilled to the utmost signification of the 
words of Scripture. Hence it is&#44; that they who feel 
a pleasure in their connexion with the race of prom&#8211; 
ise hasten to the meetings of their brothers&#44; they love 
to hear their national tongue&#44; they love its sounds as 
they are addressed to the throne Avhere Mercy sits 
enshrined to listen and to forgive. They feel that 
fearful is the place which ha&#8211;&#44; been dedicated to the 
Name of the One who is great&#44; holy&#44; good&#44; and true&#59; 
they feel&#44; indeed&#44; that his portals on earth are the 
gates of heaven&#44; where the righteous must enter here 
below&#44; to earn their admissions into the portals of 
bliss when their perishable life is ended. This con&#8211; 
sideration will account for the ardour which is so 
generally felt among us to erect houses of prayer&#59; 
this will account for the surprising fact that&#44; even 
when death was the prize of acknowledging Judaism&#44; 
its professors would meet in secret&#44; in subterranean&#39; 
vaults and in solitary caverns to constitute themselves 
an assembly of Israelites&#44; in order to be blessed by 
the Spirit of God&#44; that it might direct them aright&#44; 
and point their steps to the road of truth which leads 
onward to happiness. 

So also acted oui&#8211; predecessors who&#44; few in number&#44; 
and nearly all strangers on this land&#44; and most of

whom had come to seek a home in the then almost 
wilderness&#44; where at this day are beautiful towns and 
cultivated tields&#44; erected&#44; somewhat more than sixty 
years ago&#44; a house of prayer on the spot where we 
are assembled this day. A lovely ardour&#44; a holy de&#8211; 
sire to tread the courts of their God impelled them&#44; &#8212; 
though few had wealth&#44; and whilst a iierce war with 
the powerful &#34;queen of the isles&#34; paralyzed their 
energies&#44; and though the greater number wore men 
who were yet young in years&#44; &#8212; to devote a liberal 
portion of their substance to the holy work&#59; and 
the fruits of their striving was the building up of 
this congregation&#44; which&#44; though often weakened by 
death&#44; by backsliding&#44; by temporary divisions&#44; and 
by emigration&#44; has stood thus far a minor luminary 
among the lights of Israel. Of those who assisted 
in laying the foundation of this house the greater 
part have gone to their reward&#44; and but one or two 
yet survive who&#44; then young and active&#44; find their 
hair now blanched by the frosts of near eighty Avin&#8211; 
ters&#44; and their steps hurrying on to a grave which in 
the course of nature must soon receive them. These 
few stand a monument of an a.ge that is gone&#59; but of 
the first buildei&#8211;s&#44; the sons and grandsons to the fourth 
generation are among us to transmit to a yet later pos&#8211; 
terity the work which their fathers liave so worthily 
accomplished. And we who ourselves have come 
across the bosom of the deep Atlantic sea&#44; and they 
whose immediate progenitors took up their abode in 
this famous city are&#44; with the first&#44; heirs of the fruits 
of the first ioundcrs of our congregation. We all&#44; 
therefore&#44; have but one object&#44; this is to preserve and 
to perpetuate the good institution which now em&#8211;

braces ns within its walls. Let us continue to uphold 
whatever good we enjoy here &#59; and let us be sedulous&#44; 
too&#44; to add according to the letter and spirit of the 
law to the inlieritance which we liave acquired. It 
is easy to find fault with deficiencies and irregulari&#8211; 
ties which Ave all acknowledge to exist&#59; but let us do 
a nobler thing&#44; let each of us contribute to the extent 
of his power to the removing of whatever evil we 
may discover. If this place of worship is not enough 
visited by those Avhose privilege it is to resort hither&#44; 
let the wrong be removed&#59; let all feel a desire to come 
frequently into the courts of the Lord&#44; and there sing 
with us the praises unto the living God. If&#44; occa&#8211; 
sional I3&#34;&#44; there are some who observe not proper de&#8211; 
corum&#44; which beseems a house of prayer&#44; let their 
altered behaviour prove that they now feel that&#44; when 
here&#44; they are in the immediate presence of their 
King and God. If they&#44; who meet here&#44; are not suf&#8211; 
ficiently versed in the language and the law of Israel&#44; 
let them come here frequently&#44; and dwell in the house 
of God&#44; and learn there to become familiar with our 
national tongue&#44; and to love those who are&#44; like them&#44; 
sons and daughters of Israel&#44; and to value the birth&#8211; 
right which a gracious Providence has conferred on 
them in exempting them from calling on a god who 
cannot save&#44; and in permitting them to worship in 
their hymns and their prayers &#39;the One&#44; who by his 
speech created the heavens&#44; and&#44; with the breath of 
his mouth&#44; all their host. If there be any who are 
ignorant of the ways of God&#44; let those who are able 
strain every nerve to spread the truth wliich they 
already possess&#44; that others may understandingly fol&#8211; 
low in the path of righteousness which they are tread&#8211;

ing. In short&#44; let our periodical meeting be a per&#8211; 
petual union of spirit&#44; and move us all to do right 
ourselves and to cause others to do likewise. And 
as our predecessors&#44; regardless of worldly outlay&#44; 
founded this house and finished it&#44; let us not be be&#8211; 
hind them in supporting it with our increased means 
and more extended substance&#59; &#8212; not with a view of 
advancing the temporal interests of any one man or 
a set of men&#44; but to extend the usefulness of the 
Synagogue whither we have so long resorted&#44; and to 
prove to those who will come after us&#44; that Ave have 
not been unmindful of our duty in endowing properly 
the sanctuary which was delivered to our safe&#8211;keep&#8211; 
ing&#8211; 

Circumstances have occurred which have rendered 
it imperative upon the heads of our congregation to 
demand a small additional annual contribution for 
the support of the public expenditures&#59; the burden 
itself is but slight&#44; indeed&#44; and would not be felt at 
all were it not for the revulsion&#44; which has lately an&#8211; 
nihilated what many thought hoards of wealth beyond 
the approach of any contingency. But it is not to be 
denied that&#44; in the aggregate&#44; our means&#8211;are ample 
enough for all that is demanded of us&#44; and&#44; if the ne&#8211; 
cessity should occur&#44; that much heavier burdens could 
readily be borne. All that is required for every one 
to do is&#44; to take a prbper view of the immense impor&#8211; 
tance of properly supporting the establishments for 
worship&#44; for education and public interment among 
us&#44; in each of which it is absolutely requisite that we 
should be independent of our gentile friends and 
neighbours. I trust&#44; therefore &#40;I speak this not only 
for myself&#44; but in the name also of the worthy presi&#8211; 

<pb n="235"/>

THE SANCTUARY. 235 

dent of our congregation&#41; that each and all will not 
refuse to bear their share in the additional outlays 
which circumstances&#44; known to you all&#44; have rendered 
necessary. Were it requisite&#44; the details could easily 
be furnished&#59; but we do not deem it proper to en&#8211; 
cumber an address&#44; on tlie necessity and beauty of 
public worship&#44; with details that properly belong to a 
linancial report. One thing&#44; however&#44; I must add&#58; it 
is&#44; that no one should properly view himself as ag&#8211; 
grieved in any regulation which the congregation 
may&#44; from time to time&#44; adopt for its government&#59; 
for in every community&#44; where the majority necessa&#8211; 
rily rules&#44; there must always be some&#44; more or less&#44; 
wdiose views will have to jdeld to the decision of the 
many. Not alone in our establishment&#44; but in every 
institution almost where men deliberate and govern&#44; 
there have always been causes for complaint and op&#8211; 
portunities for fault&#8211;finding. Violent opposition and 
threats of division only irritate the feelings and in&#8211; 
crease the evil &#59; but a patient&#44; I do not say a tame&#44; 
submission to any slight grievance&#44; will much more 
readily open the door for a speedy redress&#44; than a 
course dictated by violence and an insisting upon 
one&#39;s own views of right. Let me&#44; therefore&#44; entreat 
you&#44; whilst I am speaking for the first time here on 
congregational matters&#44; to do everything in your 
power&#44; individually and collectively&#44; to promote a 
spirit of forbearance&#44; and to strengthen the hands of 
your ofiieei&#34;s&#44; selected by yourselves and from among 
yourselves&#44; in conducting peaceably and acceptably 
the affairs which concern us all&#44; and have been law&#8211; 
fully transferred to tlu&#39;ir management and direction. 
Instead of upbraiding&#44; let us &#40;.&#8211;ounsel them if we deem

their course erroneous&#44; and let us pray to our Father 
in heaven&#44; that He will endow them with his wisdom&#44; 
that they may not alone be our heads in our temporal 
aflairs&#44; but be filled with a spirit of piety&#59; that they 
may confer honour upon the stations which they hold 
by a course strictly in consonance with our blessed 
law&#59; and that they may be enabled&#44; assisted from a 
higher Source&#44; so to govern our as yet small congre&#8211; 
gation&#44; that all shall acquiesce in their rule&#44; and many 
be brought hither to worship on the weekly Sabbath&#44; 
on new&#8211;moons&#44; holy days&#44; and days of assembly&#44; the 
Lord&#44; our God&#44; who erst dwelt on Zion&#44; and who is 
the same now as He was when He revealed himself to 
our father Abraham on Mount Moriah&#44; the spot con&#8211; 
secrated unto everlasting as the dwelling of his adora&#8211; 
ble Name &#33; 

Brethren &#33; but few hours more will elapse when 
another year will have ended&#44; and be only remem&#8211; 
bered in the records of time. It is a mournful re&#8211; 
flection&#44; that the days that have passed will not re&#8211; 
turn again&#44; and that the moments that have fled&#44; 
have fled for ever. Great is the mercy of God in 
giving us so many opportunities for repentance and 
a forsaking of sin &#59; happy indeed would it be&#44; were 
we fully alive to the gracious calls that are hourly 
addressed to us by the words of Scripture&#44; by admo&#8211; 
nitions of friends&#44; and by passing events which speak 
a language not to be misunderstood&#44; that only the 
days that are spent in the imrsuit of truth have not 
passed by in vain&#44; that the hours alone dedicated to 
the worship of God and in deeds of mercy to liis 
creatures are the treasures that are left to us from 
the cpiick&#44; rapid flight of time.&#8212; Do you feel the im&#8211;

portance of this wealth &#63; are you alive to the worth&#8211; 
lessness of every other thing hcsides&#63; Then be fre&#8211; 
quent in your acts of goodness&#44; and love the house of 
God&#44; and prize the privilege that you are permitted 
to enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts 
with praise. As yet the sun is shining in heaven&#44; 
the day is not yet closed&#59; and if you are on the way 
of sin and corruption&#44; the blessed light is still at 
hand to extricate you from the mazes of death and 
perdition. Heed then the grace which ordains for 
you seasons of repentance and days of forgiveness&#59; 
and may the old year witness in its last expiring hour 
your abhorrence of iniquity&#44; and may the new one 
open upon you with a lirm resolve to be Israelites in 
name and in deeds&#44; servants who know their Master&#44; 
and who love to dwell in his house&#44; and desire to 
chant hymns and prayers in his presence all the days 
of their life. 

O God&#33; who dwellest in the midst of Israel&#44; who 
art everlasting and of infinite goodness and mercy&#44; 
cause the approaching year to be full of blessing to 
all thy children&#44; and let the spirit of truth and the 
foi&#39;giveness of mutual wrongs become rife among us&#59; 
so that all causeless contention may be far&#44; far from us&#44; 
and peace be reigning within our walls&#44; and tran&#8211; 
quillity in our dwellings. And do Thou&#44; Father

let our days pass along with the full assurance of thy 
favour&#44; wliich sweetens sorrow&#44; enhances pleasure&#44; 
and renders easy the hour of death. &#8212; Bless&#44; in the 
coming year&#44; the earth with abundant increase&#44; and

striving may not be in vain&#44; and that we may not 
need the assistance of one another&#44; but receive our 
daily bread and decent raiment from tliy bountiful 
hand alone&#44; which is not galling in its bestowal of 
gifts&#44; like the hand of flesh and blood&#44; and is not 
wearied in giving&#44; nor exhausted by its munificence. 
&#8212; Be also mindful of our captivity&#44; and guard us from 
the assaults of the uncircumcised and alien&#59; frustrate 
all evil counsel against us&#44; and bless all who wish well 
to the outcast children of thy covenant. And when

DIVINE GRACE. 

From everlasting to everlasting&#44; Thou&#44; Lord &#33; art 
God&#44; and to Thee all the events ot every age are 
known. If then our souls are laden with the weight 
of iniquity&#44; there is no being who can save us from 
the grasp of thy indignation&#44; neither can the length 
of time&#44; in which our transgressions have passed by 
unheeded&#44; obliterate them from thy memory. We are 
therefore conscious that to Thee only can we appeal for 
protection&#59; for although Thou art a righteous Judge&#44; 
Thou art also a compassionate Father&#44; who willeth 
not the death of the sinner&#44; but that he return from

his evil way and live. O answer us therefore now&#44; 
our Father&#33; and when our deeds appeal loudly for 
condign visitation&#44; if the magnitude of our hacksliding 
invokes the outpouring of thy anger&#58; then let thy 
mercy suppress our guilt&#44; and pardon and forgive&#44; as 
Thou hast done full often the children of the dust&#44; 
whose intellect is circumscribed within the narrow 
bounds Thou hast set for its sphere&#44; and whose days 
are numbered and hurrying on fast to the tomb&#44; the 
house appointed for all the living. And show thus 
that&#44; as we are sinful as were our fathers&#44; thy goodiiess 
is yet powerful to save&#44; and thy grace yet all&#8211;sufficient 
to redeem sinners&#44; if only they return and seek&#39; thy 
favour in the manner it is ordained in the words of 
thy law&#44; and the prophets whom Thou didst send to 
speak in thy name to thy people Israel. May this be 
thy will. Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

The period intervening between the New Year and 
the Day of Atonement which is fast approaching&#44; is 
properly called the season of repentance&#44; or the prep&#8211; 
aration requisite to usher in the great day of the 
Lord. This has given rise to the time&#8211;honoured cus&#8211; 
tom of expatiating in a public lecture on the impor&#8211; 
tance and mode of repentance&#44; on the Sabbath which 
intervenes between the commencement of the year 
and the day of forgiveness of sin. The frequency of 
such appeals does not derogate from their importance 
and necessity&#44; nor does the sameness of the subject 
weaken the ibrce of the admonition&#59; for in every 
year sins are committed&#44; and hence men also require 
to be awakened to a knowledge of their misdeeds at 

<pb n="240"/>

240 DIVINE GRACE. 

every period of their existence. With this view&#44; 1 
propose to lay hefore you this day some reflections&#44; 
calcuhxtcd to arrest the attention&#44; as a fit preparation 
for the time when&#44; if we have repented&#44; our sins will 
be forgiven. 

Moses&#44; the man of God&#44; says in his prayer &#40;Psalm 
ex.&#44; V. 3&#41;&#58; 

&#34;Thou bringest man to contrition&#44; and saidst&#44; Eeturn&#44; ye sons 
of man.&#34; 

What is man in this world &#63; and who is the One 
that watches over him &#63; Man at his entrance into ex&#8211; 
istence is weak in mind and powerless in body. In 
his progress he acquires comparative firmness of in&#8211; 
tellect and vigour of frame. And when he has reached 
the highest degree of development of spirit and mat&#8211; 
ter&#44; he decays gradually&#44; imperceptibly&#44; momentarily&#44; 
till&#44; should old age be his j&#41;ortion&#44; he lingers for a 
space stripped of his exalted powers of soul and en&#8211; 
feebled in limbs at the verge of eternity&#44; till gradually 
the vital spark flees away from a dwelling no longer 
fit for its habitation. &#8212; And God &#63; he has been from 
the beginning&#44; our thoughts run not back to a time 
when He was not&#59; our first conceptions find Ilim 
perfect in strength&#44; unending in wisdom&#44; and as our 
powers weaken and decay we discover no symptoms 
of perishableness in his being&#44; no diminution in las 
wisdom. And when we compare this&#44; our own ex&#8211; 
perience&#44; with the records of days that have elapsed 
before we were born&#44; we shall discover everywhere 

<pb n="241"/>

DIVINE GRACE. 241 

the same traces of providential power and wisdom 
which it has been our privilege to experience&#59; for 
every page of history teaclies this lesson&#44; that there is 
an overruling Power who shapes the course of events&#44; 
in a manner the most conducive to the general happi&#8211; 
ness of the mass of men&#44; the chief objects of the Lord&#39;s 
care on earth&#59; I say the chief objects of the Lord&#39;s 
care on earth&#44; since the least reflecting must perceive 
at the first glance&#44; that man has received dominion 
over the earth and the sea&#44; and all their manifold in&#8211; 
habitants&#44; in which dominion he is left uncontrolled&#44; 
provided he abuses not the trust confided to his care. 
This superabundant goodness of the Lord ought 
naturally to awaken our liveliest sense of gratitude&#44; 
for benefits received and for mercies so often mani&#8211; 
fested. If one man thanks the other for gifts be&#8211; 
stowed or for acts of kindness occasionally granted&#44; 
whereas these gifts are but few and this kindness lim&#8211; 
ited exceedingly in its scope and eflicacy&#58; how much 
more is it obligatory on us to return thanks to God 
for all that He has done for us &#59; seeing that his gifts 
arc innumerable&#44; and his mercies constantly exercised 
without stint or measure. But how can we thank 
Him&#63; how shall we return Him one of the many fa&#8211; 
vours which He has lavishly heaped upon us&#63; Can 
we serve Him again &#63; can we do anytliing to increase 
his happiness &#63; can we assist Him in liis need &#63; It is 
evident&#44; however&#44; to the dullest comprehension that 
by neither of the three modes&#44; by which one man 
shows the sense of obligation he owes to another&#44; can 
we in the least requite the smallest even of the fa&#8211; 
vours which God has done for us&#59; for He is not hun&#8211; 
gry that we could feed Him &#59; He is never athirst that 

VOL. IV. 21 

<pb n="242"/>

242 DIVINE GRACE. 

we could give Him drink &#59; lie ia never oppressed by 
superior enemies that we could hurry to his rescue. 
And yet the debt of gratitude is due. Should a man 
serve me&#44; even once in a year&#44; I could not boldly step 
up to him as though we two were upon equal terms&#59; 
I would be his debtor&#44; and I should feel myself&#44; if not 
humbled&#44; at least subdued in his presence&#44; and I 
should continue to be sensible of my indebtedness 
until an act of great unkindness on his part had coun&#8211; 
teracted his goodness&#44; or till by deeds on my part I 
had proved that I am not unworthy of his kindness. 
And what at last is&#44; generally speaking&#44; human kind&#8211; 
ness &#63; One parts with a thing which he needs not for 
his own use&#44; or incurs a trouble which is easily en&#8211; 
countered &#59; and&#44; again&#44; even these acts of mercy are 
exhibited mostly towards our own friends and rela&#8211; 
tives&#44; very rarely toward strangers&#44; and most rarely 
towards those inimical to us. But how ditiercnt is 
all this in the conduct of God to man &#33; His deeds of 
mercy are not recurring once in the year merely&#59; our 
memory needs not to be searched for marks of the 
favours which we receive from Ilim &#59; but every mo&#8211; 
ment of our life teems with motives of gratitude. 
&#34;Wherever we turn our eyes there will mercy stand 
revealed. Does tlie earth thirst for water&#44; the wind&#44; 
the breath of the Lord&#44; drives up the vapour from 
the briny sea&#44; and anon the clouds are bound unto 
the firmament in a hundred beautiful forms&#44; in many 
a sight&#8211;ravishing shape&#44; and soon the pattering rain 
comes down in sweet drops with refreshing coolness&#44; 
and man breathes freer&#44; his heart expands to the 
genial influence&#44; and the beast lows gratitied in the 
field&#44; and the drooping herbage lifts up ifs sunkeji

head&#44; and as the sunbeams dart forth again&#44; how do 
then a nij&#8211;riad of pellucid gems sparkle on every 
blade&#44; on every leaf&#44; in every l&#41;lossom &#59; and if the 
bride is beautiful when arrayed in her nuptial attire 
to the eyes of her husband&#44; how much more splen&#8211; 
didly is nature arrayed&#44; when her Lord has decked 
her out with the thousands of jewels and glittering 
gems&#44; which drop so beneficently and profusely out 
of his widely&#8211;extended hand &#33; Who feels not that 
great is the Author whose works are so beautifully ar&#8211; 
ranged&#44; so admirably adapted to give delight and joy&#44; 
whilst they lack nothing in usefulness and strength. 
And when his sun shines&#44; when his rain descends&#44; it 
is not alone for those who love Him&#44; for those who 
are his friends&#44; but for those also who will not believe 
in his existence&#44; who shut their eyes&#44; wilfully blind&#44; 
against the countless evidences of his being and grace 
who seek not his favour&#44; nor dread his wrath. &#8212; How 
then&#44; shall we&#44; who feel the weight of the obligation&#44; 
fitly thank Him &#63; can we stand boldly in his presence 
and say we have no motives of gratitude &#63; shall we 
be ungrateful enough to forget that we are servants 
while he is Lord &#63; that we are debtors while He is 
the Giver of all we have&#63;&#8212; We must farther reflect 
that we cannot escape from his sight&#44; and that wher&#8211; 
ever we are&#44; be it in this state of existence or after 
death&#44; we are still in his world and subject to his de&#8211; 
cree&#59; and&#44; consequently&#44; if we are truly conscious of 
our relation to Him&#44; we can never do otherwise than 
strive to prove ourselves grateful. 

This gratitude&#44; we have said&#44; consists not in return&#8211; 
ing favours to God&#44; because we can in nowise do Him 
any personal service. If now we had no revelation 

<pb n="244"/>

244 DIVINE GRACE. 

our whole life would be spent in vain to discover the 
means of gratifying this sense of obligation&#44; which 
every right&#8211;thinking man must feel. J3ut we have a 
knowledge of God and his ways&#44; not derived from 
our own unassisted reason&#44; and this is embraced in 
the revelation of his august will which He has com&#8211; 
municated to us. In this we are told&#44; that serving 
God means to impress deeply on our minds his great&#8211; 
ness and our dependence on his bounty&#59; for so it is 
written&#58; &#34;And thou shalt remember that thou wast 
a servant in the land of Egypt&#44; and that the Lord 
thy God brought thee out thence with a mighty hand 
and by an outstretched arm &#59; therefore the Lord thy 
God hath commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day.&#34; 
&#40;Deut. V. 15.&#41; Secondly&#44; that the evidence of this 
impression is to be exhibited by a cheerful obedience 
to the ordinances which are contained in the revela&#8211; 
tion of his will. If I&#44; then&#44; wish to show my ardent 
appreciation of the Lord&#39;s mercy&#44; two things are 
necessary &#58; the one&#44; that I omit no opportunity of 
making myself thoroughly acquainted with Avhatever 
lie has taught us&#44; and the other that&#44; when I have 
learned&#44; I omit no occasion whatever to obey cheer&#8211; 
fully what I have been shown to be the will of God. 
Now&#44; any one not acquainted with human nature 
would suppose that all wdiich they&#44; who give instruc&#8211; 
tion in the word of God&#44; would have to do to summon 
all mankind to his service&#44; would be that they honestly 
tell all their hearers&#44; &#34;So has God spoken&#44;&#34; in order 
to insure a cheerful&#44; a ready&#44; an unwavering obedi&#8211; 
ence. One would say&#44; that so great is the depend&#8211; 
ence of man on God in every stage of his being&#44; that 
it would be impossible for him to deviate from the 

<pb n="245"/>

DIVINE GRACE. 245 

right path in the merest trifle even. But any one 
who tliinks so highly of human nature will surely 
find himself sadly disappointed&#59; man is given to sin&#44; 
and not to obedience&#44; and consequently the teacher 
of religion has to watch closely the progress of events 
in his pupils&#44; and the religious parent the develop&#8211; 
ment of his children&#39;s character&#44; to assist by constant 
admonition the efiect of doctrinal teaching which they 
have impressed upon their charges. But even this 
care&#44; no matter how honestly exerted&#44; no matter dur&#8211; 
ing how long a time&#44; will not prevent a deviation from 
the path of rectitude&#59; for rebellion against his Bene&#8211; 
factor too often characterizes the life of the child of 
clay. In infancy already he is restive under the 
little restraints&#44; which his parents are compelled to 
impose upon him for the preservation of his life and 
health&#59; and when he begins to drink in the waters 
of knowledge&#44; how little pleasure does he manifest 
in the acquisition of that which will render his after&#8211; 
life pleasant and useful&#59; for knowledge is distasteful 
to him&#44; and partially by force&#44; partially by bribes&#44; 
partially by the stimulus of hateful ambition&#44; he is 
brought to con his daily lesson&#44; wdiich his unwilling&#8211; 
ness makes an odious task&#59; nay&#44; often all these means 
even fail of awakening in him a love of learning&#44; and 
the precious years of youth and vigorous intellect 
pass away in idleness and play&#44; and the young man 
enters upon the active stage of life with passions un&#8211; 
regulated&#44; and the mind left unstored of useful knowl&#8211; 
edge. Yet even under the most favourable circum&#8211; 
stances our maturer years are full of temptation. 
Ah&#44; how the world smiles upon us &#33; how gay the 
outside of vice appears&#33; Look at her trappings&#44; her

ous look&#44; her enticing mien&#44; her mask&#44; her teigned 
smile which hides the hideous visage&#59; and how our 
heart flutters to follow her footsteps&#44; to advance 
whither she beckons&#33; Ah&#33; how fearful is the stake&#33; 
We hesitate&#44; perhaps&#44; at first&#59; but soon we venture 
one step&#59; we heed not the weeping voice of virtue&#44; 
which in her unadorned loveliness calls after us to 
beware&#58; yes&#44; the first step is taken&#59; we feel intoxi&#8211; 
cated with the delicious draught&#44; drugged by the 
poison which our senses have cast into the cup of life&#44; 
and we reel on&#44; &#8212; on&#44; &#8212; on&#44; and we see not that the 
tempter is no longer on the smooth lawn where we 
first beheld her&#59; she flits along with a lurid glare&#44; 
like a false light&#44; attached to her flowing garb&#59; yet 
we fancy it is the steady lamp of truth we are pur&#8211; 
suing&#59; we wade through deep waters in the wake of 
our destroyer&#59; she mocks us with deceitful hope&#44; that 
soon our feet will be again on dry land&#44; and our limbs 
stretched out on the couch of pleasure &#59; yet we ween 
that her voice is soothing&#44; and her advice the dictate 
of heavenly reason&#59; but soon &#8212; sooner than even our 
enemies dared to hope for our destruction&#44; the waters 
rise tumultuously above our heads&#44; and the fiend 
laughs at our folly&#44; at our infatuation&#44; that we called 
darkness light&#44; and bitterness sweet&#59; and we would 
.sink into the abyss forever&#44; were not the merciful One 
at hand&#44; to snatch us in the last extremity&#44; when in&#8211; 
voluntarily we invoke his Name for protection&#44; from 
the destroyer&#39;s gi&#39;asp&#44; even as a brand is snatched 
from the lire. They&#44; perhaps&#44; avIio have never been 
tempted&#44; may in the pride of self&#8211;righteousness ex&#8211; 
claim against the folly of sinners&#44; and believe in their

own hearts that they never would have fallen. Especi&#8211; 
ally will the rich&#44; the endowed with mental greatness&#44; 
they who are exempt from lahour&#44; and consequently 
from many a temptation to which the poor&#44; the ig&#8211; 
norant&#44; and they who have to battle with an un&#8211; 
friendly world for their daily bread&#44; exult in their 
pride over their fallen fellows&#44; who sunk because 
circumstances tempted them to transgress. But let 
them beware&#59; they&#44; too&#44; are human&#44; and crimes to 
which the poor are not liable ensnare their footsteps 
at every stage of life. And when they yield to the 
power of sin&#44; how hideously does their misconduct 
look&#44; how does it shock our sensibility &#33; And have we 
never seen the once temperate man become besotted 
by intemperance&#63; has not many a daughter of atJlu&#8211; 
ence herded with the lowest outcasts of her sex&#63; have 
not sons of the great confederated with the robbers 
in the woods&#44; and with those who covertly pluuder 
the unsuspecting at the accursed gaming&#8211;table &#63; have 
not children of the virtuous called the blush of shame 
upon their parents&#39; cheeks by their crimes and deeds 
of violence &#63; have not the ofl&#39;spring of the great and 
powerful&#44; through their follies&#44; been a loathing to 
those who would have been honoured by the appoint&#8211; 
mont as keepers to their fathers&#39; dogs&#63; and&#44; lastly&#44; 
have we not witnessed mauy&#44; who have once led a 
godly life&#44; by degrees forgetting their own instruction&#44; 
and&#44; joined with the inlidel and ungodly&#44; despising 
their Creator&#44; and neglecting his law &#63; It is true&#44; that 
vice when calmly viewed&#44; and irreligion when her de&#8211; 
ceitful mask is removed&#44; are both hateful and disgust&#8211; 
ing in their nature and outward proportions. But 
when passions speak loudly within our heart&#44; when 

<pb n="248"/>

248 DIVINE GRACE. 

self&#8211;indulgence claims to be gratified&#44; when cupidity 
seeks to amass large hoards of wealth&#44; when interest 
whispers that gain and ambition are to be prized 
above everything else on earth &#58; how quickly is the evil 
invested with the beauty of light and goodness&#44; we 
cease to regard with horror what we have once tasted 
and found delightful &#59; and hence the commencement 
once made&#44; immorality and irreligion&#44; of whatever 
kind they may be&#44; may boast of possessing among 
their votaries men of whom the world had a just 
right to expect a different course. 

&#34;Were it therefore that we had received no aid for 
amendment in addition to the plain dictates of the 
law&#44; how many souls would l&#41;e eternally lost to the 
fold of the Lord &#59; for if the soul that sinneth were 
to die as soon as the sin had been committed&#44; nay&#44; 
grant that this should be for heinous offences only &#58; 
we might with truth say&#44; that few would see the light 
of salvation. Bnt God did not leave us so unpro&#8211; 
vided&#44; and herein is his mercy&#8211; doubly displayed. He 
included in his law incentives to repentance. He 
taught us that&#44; however we may have departed from 
the path of truth&#44; there is hope for us&#44; if wo will but 
return from our evil and seek a renewal of his grace. 
He has also appointed in his law ordinances which&#44; 
if even at first sight unmeaning to the superficial 
thinker&#44; arc&#44; by their very strangeness&#44; calculated to 
excite inquiry&#59; and upon inquiry for the reason of 
all and each&#44; we shall be answered. That thcy are for 
the sake of arousing us to a sense of our sinfulness&#44; 
in order that we may investigate our deeds and re&#8211; 
model our conduct in conlormity with the commands 
of the Lord. And so also when we hear the Shophar 

<pb n="249"/>

DIVINE GRACE. 249 

on the bogiiming of the year&#44; we slionld liccd it as 
the call to repentunce&#44; to awaken our dormant ener&#8211; 
gies Avith this assurance that&#44; though we deem our&#8211; 
selves secure iu our iniquity&#44; there is a Guardian above 
who heeds our every act&#44; and that an Avenger is 
really to execute the judgment which we have drawn 
down upon ourselves. Then is the Day of Atone&#8211; 
ment&#33; an entire day are we to fast&#44; an entire day are 
we to dwell in the house of God&#59; not to gratify Ilim&#44; 
who only delights in mercy&#44; with our bodily affliction&#44; 
but to prove to ourselves that we are conscious of our 
errors&#44; and seek even at the hazard of bodily pain to 
conquer our bodily desires&#44; and thus demonstrate that 
we abhor sin and its chief incentives&#44; which are the 
strivings after carnal desires and worldly acquisitions. 
Then comes the Feast of Tabernacles. Then is the 
temporary abode in booths to represent&#44; that we can 
place ourselves at the command of God into frail 
abodes&#44; there to celebrate his mercy which lie has 
ever extended to Israel in particular&#44; and to every 
other family of man in general&#59; and then at last the 
other ceremonies attending this festival are to impress 
on us that we are to devote ourselves&#44; even in small 
things&#44; entirely to the guidance of his holy will&#44; and 
to accept as truth whatever He has prescribed for us 
in his law. 

But if neither instruction nor warning will restrain 
nor cure us from sin&#44; if the obduracy of our heart 
will not heed the voice which speaks in mercy &#58; then 
has the Lord the terrors of his wrath by Avhich He 
can terrify and scathe those who will not listen. Be&#8211; 
lieve not&#44; beloved brethren &#33; that any event which 
happens to you and the world is without its meaning.

If a thunderholt shivers a tree in your presence&#59; or 
if a ship sinks under your feet&#44; and you escape un&#8211; 
hurt&#59; if a bit of sickness brings you to the edge of 
the tomb&#44; and yet you recover&#59; if your wealth is 
taken from you&#44; and you are deprived of what you 
valued so highly &#58; in every case be assured that your 
conduct has been weighed in the just balance of 
truth&#44; and that you are declared wanting in godli&#8211; 
ness &#59; and that it behoves you to retrieve the lost fa&#8211; 
vour by an altered course of life. The very immi&#8211; 
nence of the danger or the positive affliction must 
prove to you&#44; that you have clung to earthly things 
with a fondness which was displeasing to Gad&#59; and 
that you can only regain favour by seeking for light 
in the pages of revelation&#44; and an unwavering ad&#8211; 
herence to whatever duties are there recorded. An 
abhorrence&#44; however&#44; of the evil will not be sufficient&#59; 
you must do more&#44; &#8212; you must avoid it&#44; and not think&#44; 
as many unwise ones tliink&#44; that they are not able to 
overcome inveterate habits. The struggle may in&#8211; 
deed be very severe&#44; but amendment is nevertheless 
practicable&#59; and if you are sincerely desirous of 
amending&#44; you will ultimately succeed&#44; provided you 
avoid the error of self&#8211;reliance&#44; and lean for support 
in your renewed zeal upon Ilim who has shown unto 
you his mercy and power. 

Nor must you be faint&#8211;hearted&#44; for fear of your be&#8211; 
ing condemned by your transgressions. True&#44; sin 
un repented opens the portals of perdition&#59; but far 
different is it when repentance has reconciled us to 
our heavenly Father&#44; who says through his prophet&#44; 
&#34;Return ye and live.&#34; Return&#44; therefore&#44; O house of 
Israel &#33; to the Lord whom you have estranged by your 

<pb n="251"/>

DIVINE GRACE&#44; 251 

iniquity&#44; only come to Ilim who can sprinkle tlie 
waters of cleanliness upon you&#44; in order that you may 
be puriiied through his mercy&#44; which is never want&#8211; 
ing to those who seek Ilim in truth and humility. 

Tliis now is the way of God to man. lie teaches 
us his paths&#44; lie bestows his goodness upon us&#44; and 
when we sin&#44; lie corrects us as a father who wishes 
to improve his son &#59; and when we have even sunk 
deeply into the slough where the wicked lie who for&#8211; 
get the Lord&#44; his hand is stretched forth to save and 
to redeem. let nothing then withhold us from re&#8211; 
pentance&#59; we incur additional guilt&#44; if we doubt the 
gracious promises of which the Scriptures are so full&#44; 
which are so consoling to the wounded spirit&#44; when 
it lays open its affliction to the One who heareth 
prayer. Happy&#44; &#8211;therefore&#44; are we&#44; if we always per&#8211; 
severe on the path of truth&#44; and transgress not in 
any of our doings&#59; but also happy shall we be&#44; if we 
betimes discover our error when we have gone astray&#44; 
and heeding the warning which timely punishment 
addresses to us&#44; we return unto the way of righteous&#8211; 
ness and salvation which is discoverable in the word 
of God. Kor need the sinner fear that he will be less 
in the kingdom of Heaven &#59; true he has done grievous 
wrong&#44; he has been ungrateful and rebellious&#59; but 
it is not his right to set limits to the grace of our God&#44; 
who is Ions&#59; sutlbrino&#59;&#44; and abundant in forgiveness. 
In line&#44; let us all be mindful that it is in our power 
to merit the grace which is extended to sinners if they 
will but claim it&#59; and that there is hope if even re&#8211; 
pentance be late accomplished &#59; and let us reflect far&#8211; 
ther&#44; that punishment is not an evidence of rejection&#44; 
but an exhortation to amendment&#59; for God leads us

to contrition&#44; and then sa3&#8211;s&#44; &#34;Return&#44; ye children of 
man.&#34; In this liope let ns pass the coming Day of 
Atonement&#59; and let us trust that among the thou&#8211; 
sands of Israel&#44; many may be led to repentance&#44; and 
obtain forgiveness&#44; in order that the salvation of the 
Lord may extend wider and wider&#44; and his fear be 
constantly deeper impressed on the hearts of all the 
seed of Abraham&#44; his servant. 

O God&#33; who hast spoken the good through so many 
messengers of truth&#44; fulfil&#44; we beseech Thee&#44; thy pro&#8211; 
mise&#44; and send thy spirit unto us to purify us of our 
iniquities&#59; and when our sins demand the punish&#8211; 
ment meet for our ingratitude&#44; then let thy mercy 
prevail&#44; inasmuch as we are but flesh&#44; and our inclina&#8211; 
tion is prone to evil. And let us be brought to dis&#8211; 
cover the erroneousness of our deeds&#44; that our heart 
may be filled with humble resignation in whatever 
visitation may be sent to us &#59; so that we may learn to 
adore Thee in afltliction&#44; if prosperity should have in&#8211; 
spired us with a vain reliance upon our own reason 
and strength. But above all&#44; preserve us before Thee&#44; 
that we may live and merit&#44; through a sincere re&#8211; 
pentance&#44; thy grace&#44; whilst yet it is time to return&#44; 
and cast us not olf in our sins. So that&#44; living in the 
spirit of truth&#44; and as new&#8211;born children of grace&#44; 
we may devote the remainder of our day&#39;s to thy ser&#8211; 
vice&#44; and proclaim to many the wonders Thou hast 
wrought in our behalf&#44; and that many may be brought&#44; 
through our instruction&#44; to bow at the foot of thy 
throne as accepted servants and true worshippers.

DISCOURSE XV. 

THE WATERS OF NOAH. 

Let the soul of all living praise the Lord&#44; and 
acknowledge his glorious kingdom &#59; and let every 
breath extol the King who is mighty&#44; fearful&#44; and 
good&#44; and who alone is Saviour&#44; Redeemer&#44; God &#33; 
Amen. 

Brethren&#33; 

Let the section of the law which we have read this 
day occurs the following promise &#58; 

&#34; While the earth remaineth&#44; seed&#8211;time and harvest&#44; and cold and 
heat&#44; and summer and winter&#44; and day and night shall not cease.&#34; 
Genesis viii. 22. 

In referring to the time when this assurance came 
from the mighty Creator&#44; we will discover that it was 
when a fearfully sinning race had just been annihi&#8211; 
lated by the awful visitation of Providence&#44; of wiiich 
the traces are remaining over the whole globe at this 
very hour. In his omnipotence God had created the 
earth and all the manifold inhabitants that have life 
and being on its surface. Bat no sooner had the 
noblest and wisest of his creation escaped&#44; so to say&#44; 
from his creative hand&#44; than he was induced by pride

and curiosity to violate the only command of the 
Lord which he had received. Before this transgres&#8211; 
sion the power to sin was merely implanted in man&#44; 
but had not yet developed itself in practice &#59; conse&#8211; 
quently&#44; he was in a state of purity&#59; for the commis&#8211; 
sion of sin alone defiles&#44; not the ability of being sin&#8211; 
ful. But with the first act which contravened the 
will of God&#44; the fioodgates of evil were opened&#59; and 
the worst consequence of the fall of Adam was that 
henceforward rebellion against the Lord was the pre&#8211; 
vailing course of conduct&#44; by which his descendants 
were distinguished. The eating of the forbidden 
fruit by the fiither was&#44; before long&#44; succeeded by the 
murder of his second son through the hand of his 
eldest brother&#59; and every succeeding age yet more 
and more placed at a distance from themselves the 
duty which they owed to their Lord and God. It 
was not unbelief which is recorded against them as 
the cause of divine displeasure&#44; but daring acts of 
wickedness and violence&#44; which at last prompted the 
Judge of all flesh to destroy the man whom lie had 
made from the face of all the earth&#59; and&#44; as by tliis 
destruction the appointed ruler of creatures was to be 
removed&#44; the inferior animals likewise were doomed 
to destruction. It is not to be doubted that the men 
of sin then living on earth fancied themselves placed 
beyond the reach of retribution&#44; just as they do who 
in our own days disregard the law&#44; preferring to fol&#8211; 
low the bent of their inclinations. And should one 
who really felt the force of religion actually have re&#8211; 
proved them&#44; he would probably have been called an 
enthusiast&#44; a dreamer&#44; one not conversant with the 
world and with the many and various ways of enjoy&#8211;

ing whatever is presented to us&#59; and liis advice would 
tlierefore have remained unheeded. Yet the imagin&#8211; 
ary security was no barrier against the coming storm&#59; 
for the Lord had determined to blot out the race of 
the offenders &#59; and though every child of man is ulti&#8211; 
matcly destined to depart from this life&#44; He caused 
the decree of death to reach all mankind in a sudden 
and frightful manner&#59; and the earth opened her 
fountains&#44; and the sky poured down incessant floods 
for forty days&#44; until the entire face of nature was 
covered with one uniform dreary waste of waters. 
How dreadful must have been the catastrophe &#33; But 
few looked forward with apprehension to the period 
which the mercy of God had set as the time for re&#8211; 
pentance&#44; by which the threatened evil might have 
been averted&#59; and these few alone were provided 
with means of escape from the general ruin. But all 
others&#44; by degrees&#44; saw the soil beneath their feet 
more and more giving way to the rush of waters&#44; 
which issued forth from thousands of hidden springs&#59; 
and whithersoever they fled&#44; there were the same tor&#8211; 
rents flooding down from the skies &#59; the same heav&#8211; 
ing of billows&#44; at their heels. When an eminence 
had been reached&#44; and they vainly thought that there 
they were safe&#44; the new&#8211;made ocean came rushing up 
to them&#44; and no refuge was unto them l&#41;ut in the 
arms of death. Fathers saw their household&#44; one by 
one&#44; sink to rise no more&#59; daughters appealed to 
their mothers who themselves were unable to help&#59; 
and barely was the cry of anguish rung from the 
lover at seeing his bride snatched by some curling 
wave from his feverish grasp&#44; when he too was lost 
beneath the billows forever. But what needs it to

dwell longer on the horrors of those days&#63; Painters 
and poets have essayed to pourtruy what they con&#8211; 
ceived them to be&#44; and how man and beast strove 
with one another to reach some place of safety&#44; which 
in itself was soon to be so no longer&#59; but all tliat we 
can conceive of the scene now must be far short of 
the dreadful reality of that great desolation&#44; which 
the Providence of God sent upon earth to sweep off a 
sinning generation&#44; who had made the world hideous 
by their crimes. 

Yet&#44; as our God does never punish but with a view 
to amend thereby those who are witnesses of his pow&#8211; 
er&#44; He left also&#44; in the present instance&#44; some few to 
profit by the warning effected by the destruction of the 
transgressors &#59; and Noah&#44; therefore&#44; the man who had 
been found righteous in his generation&#44; and who had 
accordingly met with the favour of the Lord&#44; was 
saved in the ark which he had built by the decree of 
the Supreme Wisdom&#44; together with his whole house&#8211; 
hold&#44; as we read in the record which has been trans&#8211; 
mitted down to our time &#59; and in order to insure a 
continuance of the other living things which were on 
the earth&#44; at least one pair of each kind was likewise 
taken in the ark to again propagate its species&#44; after 
the punishment should have abated of its violence. 
AVe will not to&#8211;day enlarge upon the circumstances 
attending the deluge&#44; though the whole of them are 
well calculated to awaken in the thinking mind re&#8211; 
flections deep and profound&#44; over the tremendous 
majesty and power of God. We will merely advert 
to the promise of everlasting Truth which is recorded 
as given immediately after the subsiding of the waters 
had permitted the new progenitor of the human race

to quit bis place of refuge. You must not suppose&#44; 
brethren&#44; tbat tbe sacrifice of IToab reminded God of 
a fact wbicb He bad not noticed before&#44; that all men 
are sinful by natnre&#59; for He who made us knows our 
frame&#44; and remembers tbat we are dust. But the 
Bible always speaks of the doings of God in tbe lan&#8211; 
guage of man&#59; for this is tbe only method by which 
ideas can be at all conveyed to finite beings like our&#8211; 
selves. It then happened that Noah&#44; after his won&#8211; 
derful deliverance from the general destruction&#44; felt 
himself called upon to signalize his first act by grati&#8211; 
tude to his Deliverer &#59; be therefore took some of tbe 
beings preserved for bis service and the service of 
his children&#44; to consecrate them upon the altar of 
God. It was not therefore the mere slaying of the 
victims&#44; but&#44; just as in the case of the first offerer&#44; 
Abel&#44; the sincerity of the devotion which made the 
sacrifice acceptable. Tbe smoke of the burnt&#8211;offerino&#8211; 
therefore ascended on high&#44; and was received as an 
agreeable savour in the most holy Presence&#44; and the 
offerer was blest for the sake of the perfection of his 
faith&#44; which induced him to refer his deliverance to 
tbe Source of all salvation&#44; and to look to Him alone 
for farther aid and protection. It was accordingly
proved&#44; not to the Lord&#44; for He knew it beforehand&#44; 
but to man himself&#44; tbat be could serve bis Maker 
though alone among thousands who desire not to 
hallow themselves by truth and obedience&#59; and that&#44; 
therefore&#44; though many may draw upon themselves 
guilt and its concomitant punishment&#44; some few there 
will always be who&#44; deserving divine favour&#44; will 
be signally exempted from the evil which strikes 
down all around them. Let us farther reflect&#44; tbat by

the universality of the flood&#44; of which the traces can 
be discovered in the highest mountains&#44; man had 
learnt a lesson that no monument of his power&#44; no 
contrivance of his skill and industry can stand for one 
momeut&#44; when the foundations of his structure are 
sapped by the tooth of sin&#44; when his handiwork has 
not and deserves not the blessing of Heaven. As far&#44; 
therefore&#44; as all mankind are concerned&#44; the warning 
was complete&#44; not alone for that generation&#44; but for 
all future ages. We therefore find that the virtue of 
JSToah caused his memorial to come before our Father 
in heaven&#44; and lie blessed him with his grace and 
favour&#44; and promised that in no future age should a 
universal flood destroy all living&#44; though all men 
should be sinners&#59; but that lie would temper justice 
with mercy&#44; and preserve and shield&#44; whilst the de&#8211; 
stroyer should be sent on his mission to compel the 
transgressors to bow before the Eternal&#39;s awful 
throne. &#8212; And when now the proud throw oft&#39; the 
yoke of religion and wish not to humble themselves 
as servants before their Master &#58; they may be reminded 
that their greatness exists only at the wall and suft&#39;er&#8211; 
ance of God&#44; and that He&#44; who took vengeance on the 
generation&#44; which lived at the flood&#44; is yet able to sin&#8211; 
gle out every sinner and mete out to him the recom&#8211; 
pense due for his misdeeds&#44; though millions of slaves 
crouch at the foot of his throne&#44; and nations tremble 
at the mention of his name. 

Were it indeed that the promise&#44; that no deluge 
should henceforth destroy the earth&#44; would set limits 
to the power of God to Immble and to punish trans&#8211; 
gressors&#44; or that it should hold out hopes of impunity 
to the sinners &#58; then would it aigue a vacillation iu

the will of God&#44; incompatible with the attributes 
which wo have learned of his being. But the origi&#8211; 
nal purpose of God in creating man was to render 
him great and glorious&#44; and to constitute him a being 
but little less than angels. When therefore it be&#8211; 
came necessary to punish&#44; it would have betrayed a 
disappointment with the result of his creation&#44; had 
the Lord been compelled to either blot out the whole 
race of man&#44; or to give them a new mental organiza&#8211; 
tion. But at the beginning of creation He had looked 
over all He had made&#44; and found it very good&#44; in&#8211; 
cluding even the inclination to sin&#44; which He had im&#8211; 
planted in man. It was therefore perfectly consistent 
Avith his wisdom and mercy that&#44; the punishment once 
indelibly impressed upon his children&#44; He should in 
future deal with them more in their individual than 
in their aggregate capacity &#59; and hence was the prom&#8211; 
ise given&#44; that as long as the earth stands&#44; whilst yet 
the creation&#44; as we see it&#44; has not accomplished the 
end of its institution&#44; the regular course of seasons 
should not be interrupted&#44; but seed&#8211;time and harvest 
should annually succeed each other&#44; and the alterna&#8211; 
tion of summer and winter&#44; spring and autumn&#44; 
should be as permanent as the changes which occur 
diurnally&#44; and which bid the sun to disappear from 
our horizon&#44; and call forth the silvery moon and the 
glittering stars to cover with their sweet light the 
nocturnal heavens. 

This promise of the Lord has stood the safeguard 
of the world for thousands of years&#44; and the course 
of nature as by Him organized has not abated of its 
original regularity and force in the least IVom the 
moment all was finished&#44; even unto this very hour.

And when sin prevailed to a great extent&#44; severe visi&#8211; 
tations have from time to time passed over the earth &#59; 
but no deluge has ever agaui ravaged it to sweep off 
all the living as it happened at the flood. And when&#8211; 
ever soon after the rising of the sun or near his set&#8211; 
ting masses of dark clouds are piled up opposite to 
him in the firmament&#44; and rain&#8211;drops descend unto 
the earth&#44; the gorgeous arch of promise overspans the 
west or the east&#44; and the pious are called upon to 
adore the Most Higli who &#34; remembers the covenant&#44; 
is true in his covenant&#44; and faithful in his word.&#34; 
And&#44; as it fades from the sight in the brighter light 
of day&#44; or in the increasing gloom of evening&#44; true 
thankfulness swells every heart that feels&#44; that God 
is the Ruler&#44; and that in Ilim he lives&#44; and that his 
truth preserves all&#44; and that it is because of his good&#8211; 
ness that He destroys not the sinners&#44; but gives them 
time to repent and regain by their own deeds and 
faith the happiness for which they were created&#44; and 
from which sin and iniquity will banish those who 
defile themselves by their means&#44; forgetful that they 
are servants to One who reigns unto everlasting. 

In the same manner&#44; now&#44; as man was made the 
crown of God&#39;s works on earth&#44; and became in vari&#8211; 
ous ways the object of promises&#44; enduring as is the 
earth itself&#58; the Israelites were chosen from the rest 
of Adam&#39;s progeny to be the witnesses in the world&#44; 
and a living monument&#44; that &#34; the Lord is the God&#59;&#34; 
and with their existence&#44; too&#44; arc therefore connected 
covenant and promises&#44; to endure while nature is un&#8211; 
destroyed. At the creation of man&#44; it is said &#58; &#34; And 
God said. We will now make man in our image&#44; in 
our likeness&#44;&#34; to indicate that the production of this 

<pb n="261"/>

particular being was of more importance in the scale 
of oxistins&#59; things than any other of those which had 
preceded him &#59; and wo have said already that man&#44; 
though he afterwards fell greatly in the general de&#8211; 
pravity of the times&#44; yet did not lose in all his branches 
the true image of God&#59; inasmuch as when all the rest 
were found deserving of destruction&#44; there was one 
whom God called righteous in his generation&#44; and 
saved him and his house from the general wreck&#44; to 
propagate again the human species&#58; thus proving that 
man&#39;s nature was yet the perfection of all things&#44; else 
Noah&#44; too&#44; would have been destroyed&#44; and anew race 
of animated beings differing materially from Adam 
would have been formed. In nearly the same manner 
does God at a later period announce his selection of 
Israel&#44; in the following words &#40;Exodus iii. 7&#44; 8&#41; &#58; &#34;I 
have surely seen the affliction of my people that are in 
Egypt&#44; and have heard their cry by reason of their task&#8211; 
masters&#59; for I know their sorrows&#59; and I have come 
down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians&#44; 
and to bring them up out of that land&#44; unto a good 
and an ample land&#44; unto a land ff owing with milk and 
honey.&#34; Here&#44; too&#44; is a circumspection of the high&#8211; 
est kind indicated&#44; as though the Ever&#8211;blessed One 
needed to come down upon earth from the residence 
of his glory to accomplish an object dear and impor&#8211; 
tant to Him&#44; again using the language of man to pic&#8211; 
ture unto the weak mind of mortals the grandeur of 
the event which would require so great a care on the 
part of Omnipotence. We all know the reason of 
this divine descent&#59; for&#44; when the liberation was ac&#8211; 
complished&#44; the religion of Heaven was proclaimed 
before the chosen people and was indelibly and per&#8211;

manently impressed on their hearts. But we too&#44; 
like the men before the flood&#44; would uot remain de&#8211; 
voted to God&#44; and we desired to throw off our pecu&#8211; 
liar allegiance to the great King&#44; eager to be like the 
gentiles to worship wood and stone&#44; and to bow down 
before the works of our hands&#59; and like the early 
inhabitants of the earth&#44; too&#44; we have been visited 
with a punishment almost equal to annihilation&#44; since 
our state has been abolished&#44; and we have been left 
few from many. Nevertheless to us also was a promise 
given&#44; similar to the one announced after the flood&#44; 
and it is in these words &#58; 

&#34; For this is us the waters of Noah unto me &#59; for as I have sworn 
that the waters of Noah should no more pass over the earth &#58; so 
have I sworn&#44; that I will not be wroth with thee&#44; nor rebuke thee.&#34; 
Isaiah liv. 9. 

As it was the Lord&#39;s intention not to destroy man 
after appointing him the ruler of his works &#58; so had 
He resolved from the beginning not to annihilate 
Israel&#44; after He had constituted them the guardians 
of his law. And as He swore immediately after the 
flood that such an event should never again occur&#44; 
so have we&#44; in the parallel promise just cited&#44; an as&#8211; 
surance that&#44; when the barren daughter of Zion shall 
be permitted to sing over the mighty redemption 
which shall bid her rejoice&#44; the anger of the Lord 
would never more be kindled against her numerous 
offspring&#44; which then shall fill the land. We have 

<pb n="263"/>

THE WATERS OF NOAH. 263 

seen how truly and faithfully has remained accom&#8211; 
plished from age to age the covenant&#44; of which the 
glowing rainbow is the visible sign in heaven&#58; and 
shall we doubt the fulfilment of the other hope&#44; which 
is so gloriously shadowed forth in every event which 
has happened to our people &#63; Other nations have 
sinned&#44; and barbarians came and subverted their 
mighty empires&#44; and with such fury has the besom 
of destruction swept over them and their lands&#44; that 
in vain the inquirer asks after the remnants of these 
nations&#33; It appears as though the earth had opened 
and swallowed up temples and towers&#44; palaces and 
gardens&#44; walls and cities&#44; for of many people the very 
spot tbcy inhabited is uncertain&#44; and others have not 
even left their names in the memory of their succes&#8211; 
sors. But when Jacob&#39;s sons sinned&#44; their land was 
in very truth trodden down by the legions of many 
nations&#44; and their proud walls and fortified places 
were trampled into dust by the heavy tread of the 
armed millions that invaded the fields of Palestine. 
Whatever was destructible in the vales of Moriah&#44; in 
the desert of Judah&#44; at the sea of Galilee&#44; in the 
coasts of Zebulun or the Mount of Ephraim&#44; was en&#8211; 
tirely given up to the fury of the fire that burned in 
all our boundaries. Sulphur and salt have in very 
truth desolated the land&#44; and in many formerly fertile 
regions the thistle now waves its briery head&#44; or the 
sharp thorn wounds the hand of the traveller&#59; from 
the city of palms the trees whence its name is derived 
have almost disappeared&#44; and desolation sits triumph&#8211; 
ant over the broken aqueducts and ruined towers. 
But has Israel been destroyed &#63; Say&#44; are there none 
of Jacob&#39;s sons on earth &#63; Speak&#44; do you know of 

<pb n="264"/>

264 THE WATERS OF NOAH. 

none who call on the name of Abraham&#39;s God&#63; Yes&#44; 
yes &#33; there are many&#44; many such Avho cling to the 
glorious law which their fathers received at Iloreb&#44; 
who l&#41;le8s their God daily that He has been pleased 
to place their souls in bodies&#44; who in the flesh claim 
an alliance with the faithful of ancient days&#44; and who 
will ever prefer ignominy from man&#44; sooner than for&#8211; 
sake the standard of holiness which Moses elevated 
in the wilderness of Arabia. And shall these devoted 
men be told that their liopes are vain &#63; that their ex&#8211; 
pectations are not well founded &#63; No&#44; brethren &#33; if 
there is truth in God&#44; and it is blasphemy almost to 
use these words&#44; there is an imperishable covenant 
made with us&#44; that will not be broken whilst heaven 
and earth endure. ISTay&#44; mountains may be shaken&#44; 
and hills be moved &#59; but the kindness of the Lord 
will not depart&#44; nor will his covenant of peace be re&#8211; 
moved from us &#59; but unto all times will He be our 
Protector&#44; as He has been from times of old. 

There may be many&#44; however&#44; who are not fully 
sensible of the great good which they have received&#44; 
nor have fixith in the mercies which in his own good 
time the Lord intends extending to his people. Such 
as these will profess to disbelieve the truth of the 
covenant&#44; or fancy that they see it accomplished in 
the history of the gentiles&#44; who claim now to be the 
spiritual Israel&#44; under the averment that the literal 
Israel have been rejected from grace by means of 
their rebellion. To those who will not abide the 
Lord&#39;s coming&#44; whose heart yearns after the flesh&#8211; 
pots of Egypt and Edom&#44; that is the worldly advan&#8211; 
tages which the strangers unto Israel&#39;s God can con&#8211; 
fer upon their associates&#44; we have only to say&#44; that 

<pb n="265"/>

the Lord stands iu no need of such unwilling ser&#8211; 
vants as they are&#44; and that&#44; though we must always 
see with pain when any one falls off from our com&#8211; 
munion&#44; the unity of our nation is beneiitted&#44; if the 
false&#8211;hearted have no longer a share in our household. 
But let them beware how they listen to the counsel 
which their passions or worldly interests give unto 
them &#58; they may renounce outwardly their share in 
our people&#59; but they nowise escape thereby the cog&#8211; 
nizance of the Lord&#44; and tliey and their children may 
receive such retribution&#44; as will mark them in this life 
and the life to come as rebels against the majesty of 
Heaven. 

To the gentiles&#44; however&#44; who fancy to see in our 
dispersion an argument for the truth of their belief&#44; 
who imagine themselves the successors to our spirit&#8211; 
ual selection&#44; we will say that the prophet compares 
the happiness of Israel to the waters of ISToah. Let 
us then ask&#44; &#34; Who suffered in this calamity&#63;&#34; Evi&#8211; 
dently the descendants of Adam&#44; because they had 
sinned&#59; &#34;who escaped&#63;&#34; a small remnant of the 
same family&#44; who again peopled the earth after the 
subsidence of the flood&#44; Kow to the parallel &#58; &#34; Who 
sinned against the law of Moses &#63;&#34; the sons of Israel &#59; 
&#34; Who were banished&#44; in consequence of this&#44; from 
Palestine &#63;&#34; the same people. &#34; What nation was told 
that its people should be slaughtered by thousands&#44; 
and their land laid waste for a foro&#8211;etfulncss of the 
Divine law&#63;&#34; again the sons of Jacob. &#34; Who were 
promised that though but few should be left&#44; still 
they should not be entirely cast off&#63;&#34; the same por&#8211; 
tion of mankind. This being clearly established&#44; it is 
but reasonable that when the prophet speaks in one

part of the book of punishment for certain acts com&#8211; 
mitted by a certain people&#44; he refers to the same 
when he&#44; in another part&#44; speaks of good things that 
are to happen to them. Besides&#44; in the very chapter 
of Isaiah of which we are now speaking&#44; is mentioned 
the shame of the widowhood of the people which is 
to be blessed. Where can the gentile church claim 
to have suffered such a shame&#63; for&#44; according to all 
their assumptions&#44; the very commencement of their 
system was the consummation of all the glory pre&#8211; 
dicted by the prophets. Whereas&#44; if we apply this&#44; as 
we do the punishments threatened elsewhere&#44; to our&#8211; 
selves&#44; it is perfectly agreeable both to history and 
the context&#59; for now Zion is as though forsaken by 
her husband&#44; she is in a state akin to widowhood&#44; 
and amply docs she meet with contumely and shame&#59; 
because He&#44; who has sworn to protect her&#44; is by many 
supposed to have chosen himself another bride. But 
all this is but a state of probation&#44; to see who are the 
true and faithful&#44; who are they who will love and 
trust on through all trials and dangers&#44; and who are 
those who fear of following him through the laby&#8211; 
rinth of sorrow whither their God precedes them. 
Indeed&#44; darkness often seems to rest on our path &#59; but 
if we will look attentively&#44; there is always a bright 
star fixed in the heaven of our hopes which will lead 
us securely&#44; pleasantly&#44; calmly to the haven of our 
destiny &#59; and&#44; as in every age which has preceded our 
own&#44; we shall have ample cause to rejoice that we are 
called by the name of Israel&#44; though this name expose 
us at times to the scorn and hatred of the world. 

The flood of Noah has never more been renewed&#44; 
there the promise of the Lord has remained firm and

unshaken &#59; and as annihilation has never yet over&#8211; 
whelmed the actual bodily Israel&#44; we may likewise 
say that the promise made unto Abraham has been 
fufilled to the very letter. Whenever we look heaven&#8211; 
ward and behold the arch of light spanning the dark 
clouds before us&#44; we must feel that great and true is 
the Lord who keeps his covenant to a sinning world&#44; 
and lets the transgressors even live&#44; though they have 
often neglected his will. So&#44; also&#44; when we open our 
eyes to the blessing of the heavenly religion which is 
in our possession&#44; when we reflect that by its means 
we have in very truth been chosen from all nations&#44; 
and been elevated above error&#44; to call upon the One 
who is God alone&#44; and to worship none else &#58; then 
must every thinking Israelite be conscious that this is 
a sign of the covenant&#44; more brilliant than the play of 
light which the sun reflects in his rising&#44; or when he 
sets in the golden west&#44; a sign of the covenant which 
endures during the darkness of the night no less than 
in the light of day.&#8212; In this light&#44; beloved brethren &#33; 
let us walk&#59; and may it guide us with the blessing of 
Heaven through the tribulations of life&#44; through the 
shadows which surround us in our captivity&#44; and place 
us securely in the presence of our almighty Father&#44; 
when He demands back our spirit&#44; when our task is 
done. 

May the words of our mouth&#44; our God &#33; be ac&#8211; 
cepted by Thee as an agreeable savour&#59; and send 
Thou thy spirit to bless us in all our assemblies where 
we meet to worship thy holy Name&#59; and impress 
deeply into our minds the elevated blessing which is 
ours to be the children of thy covenant&#59; so that we

Were it that the people of Israel should he at the 
pinnacle of political power at the present day&#44; and 
that the earth were full of the fame of their deeds of 
arms and glorious achievements in the field of politi&#8211; 
cal sciences&#58; then&#44; indeed&#44; would it require few in&#8211; 
centives to urge our hrothcrs in faith to he sincere in 
upholding a system&#44; which of itself would&#44; in that 
case&#44; he the sphei&#8211;e in which all their worldly great&#8211; 
ness must&#44; of necessity&#44; find its source&#44; and wdience 
it would draw its means of support and increase. 
Suppose&#44; for instance&#44; that the law of the state rec&#8211; 
ognized the seventh day as truly dedicated to rest 
ajid prayer&#59; that nearly all the inhahitants of the 
land refrained from Avork on this day in ohedience 
to the civil enactments of the deleo&#59;at.ed authorities 
to which all are compelled to yield ohedience&#44; under 
pain of civil punishments &#58; it would necessarily re&#8211; 
sult that the few&#44; who of their own accord might not

sort to the places of general meeting&#44; where the mul&#8211;

tern&#44; man is for tlie most part an imitative creature&#44; 
and not unlike certain inferior animals&#44; that in their 
physical capacity take their colour from surround&#8211; 
ing objects&#44; he will in his moral character reflect 
the peculiar features of human beings like himself&#44; 
in the reach of whose influence he happens to be 
placed. We are thus often tempted to accuse each 
other of inconsistency&#44; for professing at one time of 
our life opinions&#44; which we combatted at an earlier 
period. In itself&#44; this in truth argues an inconsist&#8211; 
ency&#59; but it does not follow that we are to be blamed 
for exhibiting it. It may be that&#44; when we made our 
first profession of opinions&#44; we were under a diflcr&#8211; 
ent influence from what we are now &#59; our own mind 
had been trained and tinctured by the contact with 
peculiar persons of a certain and determined mode 
of thinking&#44; and in giving expression to what we 
deemed our oion thoughts&#44; we but uttered unknow&#8211; 
ingly the imbibed thoughts which we had derived 
from others. Now as times progress&#44; we had per&#8211; 
haps quitted our first associates and were transplanted&#44; 
to use a simile borrowed from the vegetable world&#44; 
from one species of soil to another. Xo doubt&#44; dur&#8211; 
ing the first few months&#44; the new soil did not har&#8211; 
monize with our mental well&#8211;being&#44; we felt the strange 
influence as detrimental to our healthy development&#59; 
hut our nature soon acconmiodated itself&#44; though 
slowly and by degrees&#44; to the new powers which 
were brought to act on it&#44; and as the soil&#8211; has in many 
plants a material effect upon the colour of flowers&#44; 
and leaves&#44; and fruits&#44; so were we transferred&#44; by 
extraneous influence&#44; into the new field of thought 
which we now profess to have learned to cultivate

from our own unassisted and more matured state of 
reasoning. There is&#44; accordingly&#44; on the one hand&#44; 
no great cause for others to complain of our inconsist&#8211; 
ency&#59; nor is there on the other&#44; any room for our 
exultation over the greater extent of our mental de&#8211; 
velopment&#59; seeing that our own unaided research 
had but little to do in producing the new develop&#8211; 
ment of mind of which we boast&#44; and which our 
former friends condemn. Indeed&#44; Avere opinions of 
every sort stationary&#39;&#44; were it a disgrace to express a 
change of sentiment on any subject whatever&#44; there 
could be no progress in society at large&#44; and but little 
liope for the future prevalence of better ideas in 
individuals&#59; since the multitude at large originate 
but a small number of new ideas&#59; these are the pro&#8211; 
ductions of the master&#8211;spirits&#44; who in every age&#44; more 
or less&#44; rule the world by their precept and example. 
And hence&#44; communities or societies are not guilty 
of blamable inconsistency if they occasionally change&#44; 
though the new views are not their own invention &#59; 
and as little need the individual blush if new asso&#8211; 
ciations&#44; by degrees&#44; make it evident to him that his 
former views were contracted&#44; and based perhaps 
upon the errors of ages&#44; and conceived by him to be 
sound and reasonable solely&#44; because he had never 
heard them attacked by his early friends&#44; and always 
found them in the ascendant among the greater part 
of those who surrounded him. 

If now the multitude are in the habit of pay i no&#8211; 
respect to certain laws&#44; and assume that one of the 
community does not deem them of paramount impor&#8211; 
tance&#44; provided he has never been condnced of their 
wrongfulness &#58; he acts simply in consonance with

human nature&#44; if he follows the example of those 
around him&#44; in showing outwardly duo deference to 
the observance of his associates. Again&#44; if opinions 
are constantly broached without contradiction&#44; if as&#8211; 
sumptions are made for any system or theory un&#8211; 
checked because of the overshadowinor influence of 
those who profess them&#58; no one who has not been 
taught to believe or acquiesce in contrary views 
ought to be deemed insincere or hypocritical for 
professing similar ideas&#44; no matter what you or I 
may think of their soundness and truth. You must 
observe that the human mind is not of that uniform 
character in every person as the mere bodily func&#8211; 
tions&#44; such as sight&#44; taste&#44; and hearing&#59; for there are 
a thousand&#44; nay millions&#44; of disturbing causes Avhich 
constantly influence the soul in every stage of exist&#8211; 
ence&#44; and sway it nearly as the currents of air con&#8211; 
tinually agitate the surface of seas&#44; lakes&#44; and I&#39;ivers. 
But even in physical things&#44; I mean purely animal 
functions&#44; sight&#44; taste&#44; and hearing&#44; accidental or 
constitutional disturbing causes greatly modify their 
development in difl&#39;erent or even the same individ&#8211; 
uals. If for instance you live in a country where 
art has yet to struggle for its existence with the rude 
powers of undirected nature&#44; the vision is greatly 
more sharpened than it is in civilized countries&#44; 
where the resources of art furnish appliances for the 
production of artificial light and the assistance of 
diseased eyos. The roving savage will distinguish 
objects during the day at a far greater distance than 
you can imagine&#59; and at night a simple rude torch&#44; 
consisting of some resinous wood&#44; will suffice to en&#8211; 
able liim to ibllow the few pursuits for which he needs

the aid of artificial illuniiiiation. Whereas&#44; as civil&#8211; 
ization advances&#44; and you have the appliances for pro&#8211; 
curing an abundance of light&#44; the inventive faculty 
is constantly racked to discover and to bring into use 
new and more powerful contrivances to see at a distance 
in daytime&#44; and to dispel&#44; as far as art can do it&#44; the 
gloom of night. With taste something similar can 
be discovered&#59; education and habit render palatable 
things which no one would lay hold of for the purpose 
of converting them into food if left to his own fancy&#59; 
and other substances again&#44; perfectly nauseous to some 
persons&#44; become absolute dainties to others differently 
trained. &#8212; With the sense of hearing precisely the same 
peculiarity will present itself&#59; it is education alone 
which habituates the ear to certain combinations of 
sound&#44; so as to produce agreeable or disagreeable sen&#8211; 
sations&#59; the highly cultivated European will accord&#8211; 
ingly consider as insuti&#39;erable the clanging noises 
Avhich the savage African or untutored Asiatic digni&#8211; 
ties with the name of music&#59; and then again it requires 
a great knowledge of musical combinations to render 
those highly&#8211;wrought productions&#44; with which great 
performers occasionally astonish us&#44; pleasing to a 
general audience&#44; who mic&#8211;ht all he enchanted with a 
simple ballad or plaintive melody. &#8212; So also they&#44; 
who are from circumstances compelled to watch for 
many hours in lonely places&#44; become at length so 
alive to impressions of sound that their ear can per&#8211; 
ceive the approach of footsteps&#44; or the like&#44; much 
sooner and with far greater certainty than the un&#8211; 
practised can have any idea of. 

We see thus that if we view man as a mere ani&#8211; 
mal even&#44; a number of diversities will be observable

ill difterent individuals&#44; apparently all alike endowed 
with healthy and vigorous bodily organs&#59; and the 
wonder at this diversity will cease&#44; if we take but 
very little trouble to investigate the training Ndiich 
they have undergone&#44; be this the effect of necessity&#44; 
of chance&#44; or of choice. The facts connected here&#8211; 
with are so generally known&#44; and arc so abundant in 
every one&#39;s experience&#44; that it is needless for our 
present purpose to enlarge any more on the subject&#44; 
or to adduce examples which arc familiar to every 
one. And&#44; as we have stated already&#44; the same phe&#8211; 
nomenon is observable if we regard man in a higher 
light&#44; that of an intelligent and accountable being. 
&#34;When first he is born&#44; it is doubtful whether he is at 
once conscious of the ideas which are&#44; so to say&#44; rep&#8211; 
resented around him in the words and actions by 
those who have the custody of his earliest days. But 
this state of entire thoughtlessness soon ceases&#44; and 
it is surprising how early&#44; with intelligent children&#44; 
the development of ideas commences. It is left to 
every one of you to call to mind some exhibition 
of infantile intellect&#44; which has falleji under his ob&#8211; 
servation. We may say with perfect truth&#44; that be&#8211; 
fore the child is a year old the formation of opinions 
commences. Now observe&#44; ideas like language&#44; arc 
insensibly imbibed from those around us. Present 
the child with an object and call it apple&#44; he will after 
a few trials&#44; provided he can utter this simple word&#44; 
designate the like thing whenever he sees it with the 
same appellation. So too with the idea that this ob&#8211; 
ject can be used as food&#59; and if he once linds his taste 
gratilied by its enjoyment&#44; he will in future endeavour 
to renew this pleasure&#44; whenever an apple is within

Lis reach. Everything tends to make siniihir impres&#8211; 
sions&#44; and this constantly&#44; iiyon the infant mind&#59; and 
words spoken inadvertently perhaps by older persons&#44; 
habitual expressions which tlioughtlessly fall from 
them&#44; sink deeply into the tender spirit&#44; to take root 
perchance never to be eradicated. It is not necessary 
to remind you how superstitious terrors&#44; with which 
foolish parents not rarely endeavour to frighten chil&#8211; 
dren into obedience&#44; are left indelibly engraven upon 
the tablets of memory&#44; and mark the whole character 
of after&#8211;life. Yet if you extend your inquiry&#44; you will 
at once see that these are not the only errors which 
are the result of early training. We must admit that 
gross superstition&#44; such as belief in fairies&#44; witches&#44; 
and second&#8211;sight&#44; is now utterly rejected by intelligent 
people&#44; and hence&#44; if any one should even have eavly 
learned the same&#44; he will have ample opportunity to 
drive it if possible from his mind. Yet we find that 
the thing is very difficult&#59; and there are very few 
indeed&#44; no matter how firm in resolution&#44; no matter 
how enlightened&#44; who have not an undefinable dread 
of some supernatural apparition&#44; which they fear to 
encounter under certain circumstances&#44; such as the 
neighbourhood of the dead or their place of interment&#44; 
when alone and in a dark night. We tell ourselves 
that all such terrors are foolish and sinful&#59; still some 
tincture of superstition will haunt the mind&#44; and exer&#8211; 
cise an unhallowed influence over those even who are 
eidightened in science&#44; and fortified by a religious 
trust in Gotl. IIow then is the case now with errors 
which are not so generally reprobated by the many&#63; 
It is certain that of the many ideas entertained by 
man&#44; the majority must be erroneous&#44; since the

two opposites of a proposition cannot be true at the 
same time. For instance&#44; if it be true tbat the law 
of Moses contains the only true fiiith&#44; it cannot be 
true that another code diHerinii&#59; materially from the 
same can likewise point out the true faith. If we 
now .turn our view from our own households to 
others&#44; we will become conscious that some such 
opinion&#44; in one shape or other&#44; is preached to most 
men from their cradle. The professors of this train 
of ideas are the many&#59; from some cause or other it 
is their interest to entertain it&#59; hence the person who 
lias been once suihciently exposed to its influence&#44; so 
as to imbibe it into his spirit&#44; will have no adequate 
opportunity to expel it from his imagination. 

I do not merely speak of one or the other set of 
ideas&#44; either political&#44; scientific&#44; or religious&#44; but of 
all alike &#59; it is the same what they may be&#44; so that 
they are generally adopted&#44; and are not of that gross 
nature as to shock the sensibility of men of moderate 
intellect&#59; and no matter what the few may allege&#44; the 
many will tacitly adopt what the many promulgate. 
Does this prove that the many teach the truth&#44; and the 
few are in error and darkness&#63; Assuredly not&#59; on 
the contrary&#44; it may&#44; and it does happen&#44; that the few 
may hold their ideas by conviction&#44; the many from 
convenience&#59; and again&#44; it may occur&#44; that by a vio&#8211; 
lent commotion&#44; to which all human systems are lia&#8211; 
ble&#44; cherished notions&#44; the fabrics of centuries&#44; may 
be brushed away by one of those moral blasts&#44; whjch 
occasionally sweep over the political and religious 
world. Let us instance two historical facts. Before 
the preaching of Luther the power of the Roman Pon&#8211; 
titfwas almost supreme in all civilized countries&#59; his 

<pb n="277"/>

RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS. 277 

emissaries&#44; with nothing bat their investiture from 
the visible head of the ruling cliurcli&#44; raised men to 
the throne and hurled them down again &#59; every dis&#8211; 
pute was settled by an appeal to the dread power of 
Rome&#44; and armies marched and fleets loosened their 
sails at the bidding of an authority that was said to 
be spiritual only in its nature and tendencies. Some 
few&#44; indeed&#44; there were who from time to time made 
opposition to the monstrous encroachments on the 
rights of all&#44; constantly more and more attempted by 
pretended messengers of peace &#59; but their fate was a 
speedy destruction &#59; and neither kings nor philoso&#8211; 
phers had power enough and wisdom enough to con&#8211; 
tend with the man who called himself God&#39;s vicege&#8211; 
rent on earth. He founded his power&#44; it is true&#44; on 
erroneous principles &#59; but every one had been taught 
either to suppose it&#8211; divine or to dread its crushing 
weight&#44; and the world remained a willing slave. But 
the evil at length found a cure in its own excess. 
The wickedness insensibly attaching itself to uncon&#8211; 
trolled authority overshot&#44; through cupidity&#44; the am&#8211; 
ple bounds in which it had exercised its sway so long 
and so frightfully &#59; and a minister of its communion 
was roused to opposition by some real or fancied 
grievance done to his peculiar associates. Let me 
state that in this rapid sketch of a great historical 
event I state well&#8211;known facts&#44; and mean not to take 
sides with the pontiif or his opponents&#59; I only want 
to illustrate a vital principle&#44; and leave the decision 
where it properly belongs&#44; to the tield of impartial 
history. &#8212; To proceed&#44; when Luther commenced his 
oppugnation against the Church of Rome&#44; he&#44; with&#8211; 
out doubt&#44; designed to counteract its power merely in 
VOL. IV. 24

one single point&#44; in wliicli lie probably conceived him&#8211; 
self and his associates injured by the preference shown 
to a monastic order to Avhich he did not belong. To 
many&#44; his opposition may have seemed unwise and 
foolhardy&#44; inasmuch as nearly all previous reformers 
had felt the crushing hand of the ecclesiastical arm&#44; 
and the weight of spiritual weapons&#44; though wielded 
by a feeble old man&#44; tottering on the brink of the 
grave. But circumstances&#44; on the one hand&#44; soon 
taught Luther that he must go farther than his mere 
initiatory steps if he would mean to succeed&#44; and&#44; on 
the other&#44; men&#39;s minds had been gradually awakened 
to the absurdity of regarding all mankind fallible 
save the single individual who claimed to hold the 
keys of heaven&#44; to lock and to unlock&#44; to bind and to 
unbind&#44; to permit and to proliibit&#44; at pleasure. The 
consequence was soon seen &#59; entire states&#44; following 
the lead of their kings and princes&#44; threw oiFthe hated 
allegiance which they now openly disavowed&#44; whilst 
they formerly would have demanded the instant death 
of whomever had doubted its divine authority &#59; and 
in a few brief years the converts to a new mode of 
thought were powerful enough to contend for the em&#8211; 
pire with the adherents of the Bishop of Rome. I do 
not wish to avow a preference for either side of the 
question&#44; but simply to illustrate the fact that opinions 
are often acquiesced in by many not from conviction&#44; 
l&#41;Ut l&#41;ecanse too many have been taught to regard 
them as sacred&#59; lor no one will pretend to say that 
the supremacy of the Pope was less erroneous before&#44; 
than after the preaching of Luther. 

Let us take another fact. It is now about seventy 
years ago when&#44; in France&#44; there reigned an absolute 

<pb n="279"/>

RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS. 279 

government&#44; just as in most other states of the Old 
World. What the king willed&#44; that was law &#59; and he 
averred to hold his power by divine appointment&#44; and 
the people were called absolute subjects&#44; whose prop&#8211; 
erty&#44; whose liberty&#44; whose persons&#44; whose life were at 
the disposal of one man&#44; irresponsible&#44; unappi&#8211;oachable 
to all others besides. But about the period named a 
new event aroused the attention of the world. On 
the western shore of the vast Atlantic a new nation 
sprung into existence&#44; under the avowed declaration 
of opposition to arbitrary rule proceeding from one 
or many&#44; and an unalterable determination to resist 
being taxed without the consent of their own deputies. 
The successful struggle which resulted in the inde&#8211; 
pendence of the States forming the American U&#59;iion&#44; 
conlirmed the biblical doctrine that princes are ame&#8211; 
nable to their subjects for a non&#8211;performance of the 
duties&#44; which the governed have a right to expect 
from their rulers. This rediscovery of an ancient 
axiom&#44; and the necessity which the King of France 
was under from an exhausted treasury to consult the 
representatives of his people&#44; called speedily forth a 
spirit of inquiry into the actual claim to sacrcdness of 
the sovereign&#39;s power and person &#59; and in the confu&#8211; 
sion attendant upon the outbreak of the vilest pas&#8211; 
sions&#44; pent up by long ages of arbitrary taxation and 
oppression&#44; the authority of the king was at first de&#8211; 
lied and then abrogated&#44; and his person was brought 
before a tribunal&#44; self&#8211;constituted and extra&#8211;judicial&#44; 
and his head fell beneath the axe of an exccutionei&#8211;&#39; 
by which act all law and the sacred obligation of an 
oath were set at detiance. We are not engaged in an 
historical disquisition&#59; it is not our purpose to explain

the motives of any event&#44; and I merely adduce this 
instance to show how opinions&#44; held sacred by acqui&#8211; 
escence and enforced by the power of prison and the 
sword&#44; are set at naught when passions&#44; breaking 
through the dread of these barriers&#44; overleap the 
bounds which was hitherto set them&#44; and riot in a 
newdy&#8211;opened path&#44; which was formerly not even ap&#8211; 
proached in imagination. 

If&#44; however&#44; the power of the Pope&#44; which jve have 
instanced&#44; and the divine right of kings&#44; with its ac&#8211; 
companying doctrines of passive obedience and non&#8211; 
resistance&#44; had been the result of conviction instead 
of cherished errors&#44; the entire overthrow which they 
have experienced could not have taken place &#59; for 
men &#8211;are not likely to cast that ofi&#39; which they deem 
of paramount importance&#58; witness the many martyrs 
to religious and political creeds who in every age pre&#8211; 
ferred death to yielding their avowed doctrines. In 
the same manner the adoption of different views in 
modern times does not prove that a new conviction 
has dawned upon every mind &#59; for&#44; in the lirst place&#44; 
many communities as yet acquiesce in the dicta of the 
Church of Rome&#44; and others again blindly obey their 
temporal rulers without questioning their authority&#59; 
and secondly&#44; protestants in religion and republicans 
in politics are perhaps as little able to give good rea&#8211; 
sons for their own opinions&#44; as ever their religious or 
political opponents are. It is much easier to follow a 
certain train of ideas adopted by others than originate 
one for ourselves&#44; and much easier to refer to the mul&#8211; 
titude who agree wuth us as a proof that we are right 
than show this fact by sound and conclusive argu&#8211; 
ments.

As we hinted already&#44; man becomes gradually used 
to certain opinions&#44; just as lie does to certain manipu&#8211; 
lations in mechanical pursuits&#44; to which he is com&#8211; 
pelled or induced to apply himself daily &#59; and no man 
is any more a Trinitarian or a Mahomedan by nature&#44; 
than another can claim to have acquired intuitively 
the art and mystery of watchmaking&#44; without having 
any previous knowledge of the complicated machine&#44; 
by which we are enabled to measure time and dis&#8211; 
tance. We then do not mean to say&#44; whilst maintain&#8211; 
ing that the Jewish religion alone is true&#44; that all 
other men who profess any other of the many moral 
systems which formerly governed&#44; and to this day 
govern the world&#44; are acting against their conviction 
of truth &#58; though we do assert&#44; that we base our con&#8211; 
duct&#44; in the main&#44; upon the firm persuasion&#44; that the 
law of Moses is true&#44; and has been the only proper 
divine code ever since the day of its promulgation. 
We say&#44; we will accord to those who differ from us 
the full benefit of heartfelt sincerity&#59; because&#44; claim&#8211; 
ing them to be in error&#44; we cannot shut our eyes to 
the undoubted fact that&#44; few&#44; indeed&#44; ever hear any 
thing of the Jewish religion&#44; and what they hear is 
conveyed to them&#44; for the most part&#44; through inter&#8211; 
ested and misinformed teachers. Besides&#44; though to 
us the unity of God seems so self&#8211;evident a proposi&#8211; 
tion&#44; that we cannot conceive how we could doubt it&#44; 
others have been taught from their infimcy to asso&#8211; 
ciate this oneness with the secondary idea of a me&#8211; 
diator. From the earliest years of their childhood&#44; 
they have heard mentioned with reverence&#44; with 
heartfelt devotion&#44; with a sacred awe&#44; a name which 
their teachers and parents say belongs to an adjunct

of the Deity &#59; they have been told&#44; that of themselves 
they are children of perdition&#44; incapable of any vir&#8211; 
tuous resolve or virtuous action&#44; utterly rejected from 
divine grace&#44; unless it be through the merits of a 
Diediator&#44; whose blood has been shed for a sinning 
world. And do you wonder&#44; that this creed is adopted 
without examination in perfect simplicity of faith &#63; I&#44; 
for my part&#44; do not&#59; it is true&#44; that as an Israelite&#44; 
who has been taught to look upon the mercy of God 
as all&#8211;sufficient to cleanse him from transgression&#44; I 
could not imagine the probability of a secondary deity&#44; 
if my life were to depend on it&#59; but at the same 
time&#44; we must not forget&#44; that to the greater part of 
our neighbours no idea whatever of our religion is 
ever conveyed&#44; except it be to connect it with our 
state of dispersion&#44; asserted to be a recompense for 
our sins&#44; in maintaining our ancient system&#44; and re&#8211; 
jecting the alleged mediator. Beautiful imagery also 
is not wanting&#44; to exhibit the grace and goodness of 
a divinity dying by human hands&#44; to atone for the 
sins of man &#59; enchanting eloquence is exhausted to 
convoy to the mind an adequate notion of an incar&#8211; 
nation of the divine principle in the body of a mor&#8211; 
tal&#44; to effect the just&#8211;mentioned salvation&#59; miracles 
said to have been wrought&#44; are appealed to&#44; in order 
to silence all objections&#59; and&#44; lastly&#44; every one is 
referred to the immense strides this or the other 
system &#40;for besides the Nazarenes&#44; the Mahomedans 
and heathen too claim to be right&#41; has made in the 
empire of opinion&#44; whilst the Jewish belief is pro&#8211; 
fessed by only a comparative&#33;y few and obscure in&#8211;

by tlieir ordinaiy occnpations&#44; all this is sufficient 
evidence in fuvour of the correctness of the majority 
in their immediate vicinity&#44; and they acquiesce more 
from indolence&#44; than conviction based on investiga&#8211; 
tion &#59; and this chiefly because the advantage of places 
and offices of trust and profit&#44; the possession of re&#8211; 
nown and power&#44; and political and social high con&#8211; 
nexions are decidedly with the many&#59; since in all 
states&#44; whether the government be monarchical or 
republican&#44; the few must yield to the majority both 
power and patronage&#44; and accept any distinction 
&#40;whatever the laws may say&#41; more as a favour than a 
right&#44; the majority having all power&#44; and consequently 
the i&#41;hysical abihty of denying all offices and share 
in the government to the minority. &#8212; But to the vast 
multitude&#44; who never think&#44; except on objects imme&#8211; 
diately concerning their ease or advancement&#44; it is 
enough that&#44; what they call&#44; every body believes or 
acts so&#44; and they are perfectly satisfied that they are 
right if they believe and act as every body around 
them does &#59; and every call for reasons for their con&#8211; 
duct is answered by an appeal to the potent argu&#8211; 
ment&#44; that the vast majority is with them in error&#44; if 
there be any error. There are&#44; no doubt&#44; many who 
do think&#44; whose mind is not penetrated by the early 
instruction of friends and by the appeal of the learned 
in after&#8211;years&#59; but they often prudently conceal what 
they really think&#44; and not being acquainted with any 
thing better&#44; and not knowing where to apply for 
true instruction&#44; they dismiss the subject from their 
mind&#44; not being able to arrive at a satisfactory con&#8211; 
chision from their own research&#59; and at length they 
fall insensibly into the train of thinking so generally

adopted&#44; persuading themselves&#44; perhaps&#44; at the sarna 
time&#44; that so many wise&#44; good&#44; and useful men cau 
scarcely he mistaken&#44; or that they would wilfully and 
knowingly teach wdiat they believe to be false. 

I fear that the observations wdiich I have laid he&#8211; 
fore you&#44; brethren&#44; have detained you already too 
long&#59; I must&#44; therefore&#44; leave them in their unfin&#8211; 
ished state&#44; to be resumed&#44; God wiUing&#44; on some fit&#8211; 
ting future occasion. &#8212; I started with the idea that&#44; 
were our religion the popular one&#44; we should have 
followers and devoted adherents as a spontaneous of&#8211; 
fering to public opinion. But the case is very dif&#8211; 
ferent now&#59; the true faith&#44; the faith which we uphold&#44; 
is professed&#44; and has ever been professed&#44; by but a 
handful of men&#44; compared with the mass of mankind. 
It is its truth alone which has upheld it&#59; no power&#44; 
no learning&#44; no eloquence has wrought the miracle 
of the preservation of the heavenly kuv which is ours. 
On the contrary&#44; all three&#44; namely&#44; power&#44; learning&#44; 
eloquence&#44; have been unceasingly exerted to break 
down the code of Moses&#44; and to scatter its followers 
among the many nations of the earth. The majority 
have appealed to us to forego the belief in one God&#44; 
and to acquiesce in the intervention of a mediator&#44; 
and of a saviour the child of a woman. The Bible 
itself has been appealed to&#44; so as to prove that God 
is more than one person&#44; I shudder almost&#44; as I speak 
it&#44; that the unchangeable&#44; the undying&#44; the sole God&#44; 
had become incarnate&#44; multiplied&#44; mortal&#44; subject as 
such to sorrow&#44; pain&#44; and death. Ila&#33; liow the bar&#8211; 
barians raved when&#44; like the sheep that are led to 
slaughter&#44; we stood unresisting&#44; still&#44; patient&#44; resigned&#44; 
and received the death&#8211;blow&#44; exclaiming&#44; &#34;The Lord

is One.&#34; Ila &#33; how did the anger of the persecutor 
kindle&#44; when we refused the proffered gifts of phice&#44; 
of wealth&#44; of life&#44; and joy&#44; only that we might re&#8211; 
main humble followers of that great&#44; adorable Being 
who lifts up the lowly&#44; and casts down the proud. 
Yes &#33; these were the trophies which Israel carried off 
in the strife for the sacred right of freedom of opin&#8211; 
ion &#59; these are the imperishable honours which will 
attach to our name to the end of time. 

But it is not to be concealed&#44; that many were led&#44; 
we would willingly believe that it was from convic&#8211; 
tion of some sort&#44; to amalgamate Avith the gentile 
mass&#44; and we must confess&#44; that even now&#44; when 
persecution has nearly sheathed her bloody sword&#44; 
there are those who no longer wish for a share in the 
good which the Lord has spoken concerning Israel. 
Yea&#44; there are apostates &#33; the peace and prosperity of 
the gentiles allures them&#44; and they insensibly sink 
into the opinions which alone can justify their change 
of religion. Thank God &#33; compared to the mass&#44; the 
number of these renegades is but small&#44; and the 
house of Israel flourishes like the vigorous monarch 
of the forest&#44; that sheds its refreshingshade though 
some excrescences have been lopt off by the wood&#8211; 
man&#39;s axe. And whenever then any desertion does 
take place&#44; let us warn our children of the danger of 
listening to the overtures of strangers to our faith&#44; 
and to point out the causes which led our brothers to 
forsake our communion. In a word&#44; it is an early 
and thorough religious education in our homesteads&#44; 
in our schools&#44; and in our houses of prayer&#44; which 
should fortify us against the seductive appeals which 
a popular religion addresses to our interests&#59; the

Jews should be taught what they are to believe as 
Jews&#44; and why they should be Jews. We know that 
it requires some self&#8211;conquest to exhibit the outward 
tests of an unpopular opinion&#44; before those who do 
not profess it&#59; and unfortunately&#44; it is mainly this 
cowardly feeling which not rarely deters some of us 
from avowing their belief&#44; and practising the duties 
which the law demands of them. Now&#44; it is educa&#8211; 
tion which should counteract this fear of appearing 
singular&#59; so that when questioned concerning the 
reasons of our practices&#44; we may give intelligible 
and satisfactory answers&#44; both to our own associates 
and to the stranger who may inquire of us the ways 
of the Lord. If then we are well informed&#44; we will 
revere that holy faith which binds us indissolubly to 
the God who was&#44; who is&#44; and who will be&#44; and we 
will gladly bear our testimony to the truth of the 
law which has stood the shocks and vicissitudes of 
so many changes in our national existence&#44; though it 
may not be received by our gentile neighbours as 
their guide of life&#44; and the belief in the Oneness con&#8211; 
tinue confined to the small numbc which comprises 
the descendants of Abraham. 

Such a lirmness characterized the father of our 
race&#44; who in the days of gray antiquity&#44; opposed him&#8211; 
self almost alone to the oi&#41;inions of the many and 
mighty&#44; who surrounded him on all sides. Fearlessly 
and boldly&#44; the blessed son of Terah left his father&#39;s 
house&#44; where already his attachment to a pure the&#8211; 
ology had exposed him to persecution&#44; to wander 
away into a distant land&#44; where also the name of the 
Lord was not honoured. He went forward among 
strangers&#44; and proclaimed aloud that he did not be&#8211;

lieve as the inhabitants of the land believed&#59; and he 
instructed his household to walk in the ways of his 
heavenly Master&#44; whilst he impressed on their minds 
to love justice and righteousness. Even when ad&#8211; 
verse circumstances seemed to render dark his path 
of life&#44; he did not waver in his faithful allegiance to 
the behests of his God &#59; and he sealed himself with 
the sign of the covenant&#44; although the precept was 
new and given only to him and his descendants&#59; and 
when years thereafter he was bidden to render up the 
oidy son of his Sarah&#44; as an offering on the altar&#44; he 
hesitated not to comply with the commandment. &#8212; In 
brief&#44; he adopted in early life the belief in the One 
Supreme&#44; from a sincere conviction of its truth &#59; he 
did this when alone among idolaters&#44; undismayed by 
the danger he incurred&#44; unswayed by the example of 
the multitude&#59; and during the remainder of his davs 
he omitted no opportunity to prove that his belief 
was something more than a profession of opinions&#44; 
and that it enabled him to conquer his self&#8211;love&#44; and 
to sacrifice his dearest thing on earth&#44; when he 
deemed this to be the course marked out by the 
strict line of dnij. 

This was the faith of Abraham which raised him so 
preeminently above the rest of his contemporaries&#44; 
and the remembrance of this faith the Lord promised 
to preserve unto his latest descendants. For&#44; when 
Isaac was sore pressed by famine&#44; the Lord appeared 
to him&#44; and forbade him to go down to Egypt&#44; and then 
continued&#58; &#34;Sojourn in this land and 1 will be with 
thee and bless thee&#59; for unto thee and thy seed I 
will give all these lands&#44; and I will fultil the oath 
which I have sworn to thy father Abraham. And I

will multiply thy seed like the stars of heaven&#44; and 
I will give to thy seed all these lands&#44; and in thy seed 
shall all the nations of the earth he hlessed.&#34; 

&#34; Because that Abraham hearkened unto my voice&#44; and kept 
my observances&#44; my commandments&#44; my statutes&#44; and my hiws.&#34; 
Genesis xxvi. 5. 

The language of this promise is too self&#8211;evident 
to require any extended explanation &#59; for God clearly 
conveys thereby the consoling assurance that the vir&#8211; 
tue of Abraham&#44; in remaining a steadfast adherent of 
the true faith&#44; should always stand the protection of 
his descendants in all their tribulations&#59; and that as 
descendants of Abraham&#44; that is&#44; as men marked by 
the same inward faith in the unity of God&#44; and by the 
outward observance of the divine ordinances and laws&#44; 
they should become a blessing to all the nations of 
the earth. Be it then your study&#44; sons of Abraham I 
to remain true as the glorious father of your race 
was before you&#59; depart not from the divine standard 
to the right or the left&#59; regard not the fewness of 
your own brothers and the multitudes devoted to 
other creeds&#59; heed not the call which would induce 
you to give up the oppressed and despised house of 
Jacob&#44; for the glory and splendour of the gentile 
church&#59; and reflect that only as the followers of Gue 
who is unchangeably the same throughout all time 
and space&#44; can you become a light to the world&#44; a light 
which shall in due time dispel the mists of supersti&#8211; 
tion&#44; of unbelief&#44; of error and sin&#44; when the sun of

righteousness will shod forth his beneficent light over 
all the children of man&#44; even for the sake of the vir&#8211; 
tue of Abraham&#44; the true friend and adorer of the 
Creator of heaven and earth. 

O Father&#44; to &#8211;whom nothing is too woifderful&#33; 
deign to bless us with thy peace &#59; strengthen us in the 
moments of adversity&#44; and nphold our spirit at the 
hour when worldly prosperity smiles upon us&#59; in or&#8211; 
der that in every situation of life we may experience 
the workings of thy gracious countenance witliin our 
lieart&#44; to support us when our soul is weary&#44; and to 
check us when our pride would teach us to regard 
ourselves as mighty&#44; forgetful that thy blessing alone 
gives us prosperity and peace. And teach us not to 
look with envy upon the possessions of our neigh&#8211; 
bours&#44; and to value as naught any worldly greatness 
which might withdraw us from thy holy service. So 
that we may live as our fathers lived&#44; worshipping 
Thee in truth&#44; and loved by Thee even as trusty ser&#8211; 
vants and faithful children&#44; whose body is Thine&#44; and 
whose soul is the work of thy hands. May this be 
thy will&#44; now and forever. Amen.

THE DOCTRINES OF JUDAISM. 

O Lord God of Israel &#33; who didst guard the infancy 
of our people&#44; and bless the parents of our race&#44; be&#8211; 
cause that they walked before Thee in the love of thy 
name and obedience to thy comniahdments&#44; vouch&#8211; 
safe at this time and at this hour to listen to the 
prayers of our scattered captives who as yet love to 
avow themselves thy servants&#44; and to uphold the truth

fathers&#44; love them as Thou didst love the righteous 
ones of old &#59; and let thy gracious goodness be their

Brethren &#33; 

Religion&#44; that blissful bond which unites man to 
his God&#44; naturally divides itself into two i&#41;arts&#44; relig&#8211; 
ion of thought&#44; and religion of action. If we have 
no regard to motives&#44; which being yet in thought are 
called principles&#44; or bases on which actions are found&#8211; 
ed&#44; there can be no action of any sort&#59; for we move 
not from the spot on which we stand&#44; nay&#44; do not 
so much as raising our hand&#44; without some cause for 
our simple motion. Whatever action then takes place 
is founded upon some principle&#44; or moving cause&#59; 
and consequently the act is merely the exhibition of 

<pb n="291"/>

THE DOCTRINES OF JUDAISM. 291 

the tlionght&#44; feeling&#44; motive&#44; principle or by whatever 
term you express yonr meaning&#44; which lies buried iu 
our soul. When we now say of a man&#44; that he has 
good or bad principles&#44; we only mean to express&#44; that 
the habitual motives which prompt his conduct are 
of that kind which will result in good or bad acts&#44; as 
the case may be. In commencing now a course of 
conduct&#44; if we wish that religion&#44; or what is the same&#44; 
a sincere acknowledgment of divine power&#44; should 
be the pervading characteristic&#44; the mind must be 
imbued with that species of feeling which&#44; responded 
to in acts&#44; will redound to the greatest glory of God. 
Since&#44; however&#44; the religion of acts is a matter of rev&#8211; 
elation&#44; &#8212; I mean to say&#44; since our active duties are 
prescribed to us in the Scriptures which certify herein 
of the will of God &#58; it is but proper that we should 
search the same source for the correct training of the 
thoughts. The first step is to see. Why we should be 
religious &#63; the second&#44; How to become so &#63; In both 
these important points the Bible is the sure guide&#44; 
which we may follow without fear of going astray. 

We just defined religion to be &#34; the bond which 
unites man to his God.&#34; It is therefore union with 
God&#44; peace with our Maker which we are to seek. 
N&#39;ow&#44; the question recurs&#58; &#34;Who is our God&#63;&#34; It 
may be difiicult for the child of the desert&#44; for the 
native of interminable forests whom no light of truth 
cheers with precious knowledge&#44; to answer this query 
satisfactorily to himself&#59; but to the possessor of the 
Bible&#44; the reply is one of great simplicity&#44; it is&#58; Our 
God is that great Intelligence who&#44; being too far re&#8211; 
moved from tlie search of human knowledge to be 
understood by finite beings&#44; created alone and un&#8211;

aided everything which exists and moves around us 
on every side&#44; be this on the earth on which we live&#44; 
or in the immense extent of space where millions and 
millions of worlds&#44; many far larger tlian our own 
earth&#44; abide and move&#44; and they are alike creatures 
of the same Power that created and shaped the form 
of each of us&#44; and the countlesshostsof those who have 
departed from this life. The Omnipotence&#44; creating 
all&#44; sustaining all&#44; who is visible in every blade of 
grass&#44; in every pearly drop that lies tremblingly re&#8211; 
posing in the half&#8211;open cup of a flower w&#8211;hich in heed&#8211; 
lessly passing you crush beneath your foot&#44; uo less 
than in the gigantic snow&#8211;capped mountain which 
must ever remain inaccessible to man &#8212; this Omnipo&#8211; 
tence cares for each and every one wdio is the eftect 
of his work&#44; the offspring of his creation&#44; and is solici&#8211; 
tous for his welfare. Awful thought &#33; consoling as&#8211; 
surance &#33; the King of the universe loves me&#44; the 
eartlnvorm whom He has fashioned &#33; the Iloliest Es&#8211; 
sence in whom there is no evil watches over&#44; cares

impure in thought&#44; sinful in conduct&#44; and brief of 
years &#33; And does lie need my aid &#63; can I add the 
least to his infinite greatness &#63; As well might the 
infant raise in its tiny arms the mother in whose 
bosom he buries his face&#59; as well might the midday 
sun envy the liglit of the taper which pales in his 
presence. No &#33; God loves me&#44; because&#44; and only be&#8211; 
cause He is good&#44; and delights in the happiness of his 
creatures&#44; and not because they can add in the least 
to his beatitude&#44; which is as perfect as we can con&#8211; 
ceive it to be&#44; and irot capable of augmentation by the 
actions of mortals &#59; unless we might so term the satis&#8211;

faction&#44; which the Bible expresses itself figuratively 
us appertaining to the Lord&#44; in consequence of the 
virtuous deeds of the righteous on earth and their 
words of sincere prayer&#44; which are represented as an 
agreeable offering in his presence. But even in the 
last instances we must not suppose that thereby God&#39;s 
greatness is in any manner enhanced &#59; for it is only 
that Ave are certified of his approbation in terms be&#8211; 
fittino&#58; human understanding&#44; not however corre&#8211; 
sponding with the essence of the divine Majesty&#44; of 
which no words can give us an adequate conception. 
We must not forget that words are exponents of sen&#8211; 
timents&#59; but since our whole intercourse is with be&#8211; 
ings like ourselves&#44; who more or less have the same 
capacities and the same wants&#44; consequently the same 
feelings or moral sensations &#58; it follows that whatever 
idea we have of language must of necessity limit 
itself to finite things and objects confined to and ter&#8211; 
minable in this life. We may feel&#44; nay&#44; we do feel 
the existence of a vast extension into farther &#8212; farther 
&#8212; farther space and time which we imagine to be 
eternity &#59; but still we measure this eternity even by 
the diurnal revolutions of the planets and by the an&#8211; 
nual change of seasons&#59; in short our very eternity is 
but a long extension of measured time&#44; as our infinity 
limits itself to a great enlargement of our notions of 
space. II ow really far short all this must necessarily 
leave us from a correct comprehension of eternity 
and infinity&#44; can easily be understood by the com&#8211; 
monest comprehension &#59; and thus in going beyond 
ourselves in w&#39;ords and in thoughts&#44; we are necessarily 
bound by terms&#44; words or expressions which are ap&#8211; 
l&#41;licable only to things of the earth&#44; as we liave said&#44; 

25&#42;

all of sliort tluratiou and of measurable limits. Were 
our intercourse on the contrary with beings of ahiy&#59;h&#8211; 
er order&#44; were we to become familiar with those who 
live to an actual eternity &#58; not alone our ideas would 
become enlarged&#44; but our words&#44; too&#44; would have a 
different bearing&#44; and adapt themselves naturally to 
the then extended sphere of our knowledge. Let us 
state the argument again for the sake of greater 
clearness. As we now are&#44; our words have constant 
reference to mortality and mortals&#59; for the earth and 
sun also are creatures&#44; and therefore subject to change 
and decay&#44; if so it be the wall of their Maker to 
change or destroy them &#59; our feelings and knowledge 
belong to beings of a finite nature&#44; and therefore the 
words expressive of our feelings are one and all&#44; with 
few exceptions indeed&#44; referable to earthly existence 
only&#59; and even the few exceptions noticed are just 
such approaches to a diiferent state of existence as 
must argue a longing after better things&#44; a foretaste 
merely of another state&#44; as an evidence of the diver&#8211; 
sity of spirit from matter &#59; and lastly&#44; if our sensa&#8211; 
tions were by any possibility raised to a higher stan&#8211; 
dard&#44; our words would either be different&#44; or their 
application would receive the higher significancy&#44; 
suitable to our more exalted existence. 

Now&#44; however&#44; we are essentially mortal&#44; iinite in 
time&#44; limited in wisdom and knowledge. Ilow are 
we HI this respect&#44; then&#44; to be certified of the nature 
of the Deity and of the character of his works &#63; Is 
there&#44; perhaps&#44; an angelic language which we can 
employ when speaking of the Most High &#63; Certainly 
not&#59; we have only the words of ordinary life to con&#8211; 
vey to each other our ideas of his being and power&#59; 

<pb n="295"/>

THE DOCTRINES OF JUDAISM. 295 

lience&#44; when we speak of Him&#44; who is immortal and 
inliiiitc&#44; we employ terms fitting to a mortal&#39;s appre&#8211; 
hension&#44; not to onr Creator&#39;s infinite vastness of 
power&#44; existence&#44; g&#39;ooclness&#44; happiness&#44; Avisdom&#44; and 
mercy&#33; And He will forgive us if&#44; in our ignorance 
how to indicate his praise&#44; we use terms unbefitting 
his truth and holiness&#59; if from our inability to ex&#8211; 
press what we feel but which yet are unable to utter&#44; 
we speak of Ilim as we would do of man&#44; and ascribe 
to Him human attributes which are nevertheless 
foreign to his nature. Even the word which I have 
just used&#44; &#34;nature&#44;&#34; is quite inappropriate to God &#59; 
nature means&#44; correctly speaking&#44; organization&#44; which 
presupposes a derivation from a superior Power &#59; and 
still it is the only word which we can employ&#44; when 
we wish to express in one term the whole system of 
attributes which we fancy to constitute the essence 
of the Lord. 

But in accidentally carrj&#8211;ing out a passing thought 
on the subject of the language which the Bible uses 
in speaking of God&#44; and which demands more than 
a mere casual elucidation &#58; I fear that I have too far 
strayed from my subject in reference to the truths or 
doctrines which the Scriptures teach. To return&#44; how&#8211; 
ever &#58; The Decalogue&#44; that first of the great exposi&#8211; 
tions of our duties&#44; commeuces with the demand of 
the acknowledgment of the Godhead of Him who 
spoke to our ears&#44; and whose fire of glory blazed 
visibly before our astonished eyes. The first motive 
which was placed before us &#34; why we should obey&#63;&#34; 
was the announcement of the Everlasting &#39;&#34;I am&#44;&#34; 
that He is&#44; was&#44; and will be&#59; consequently&#44; that since 
He alone exists as such&#44; no one can have any claim 

<pb n="296"/>

296 THE DOCTRINES OF JUDAISM. 

to our obedience&#44; which might by any chance inter&#8211; 
fere with the homage due to the everHving One our 
God&#44; who desires from a free choice&#44; without com&#8211; 
pulsion&#44; without interest&#44; without hope of return&#44; to 
bring us near unto his service. The second motive 
has &#34;gratitude&#59;&#34; for it says&#44; &#34;I&#44; thy God&#44; who have 
brought thee out of the hind of Egypt&#44;&#34; indicating 
thereby&#44; that the obedience claimed was not an arbi&#8211; 
trary demand by the strong from the weak&#44; but a debt 
which the child ought gladly to pay to the Father&#44; the 
obliged servant to his bountiful Benefactor. 

&#34;We must now observe that the truth of God&#39;s ex&#8211; 
istence promulgated in the first commandment&#44; is 
unchanged to our very day&#59; there is yet the same 
overruling Power who guides the universe as a father 
guides the early steps of his child&#44; who provides for 
all and cares for all&#44; even for those who are unbeliev&#8211; 
ing in his existence&#44; or heedless of obeying his will. 
From the day that the Lord called Moses up to the 
Mount Sinai and spoke to the people Israel&#44; no new 
power has started into existence to claim a share of 
his glory&#44; or a portion in the worship due to Ilim 
alone. &#8212; Moreover&#44; whatever motives of gratitude ex&#8211; 
isted from the beginning exist also now with full 
force&#59; since all the good which man enjoys in his in&#8211; 
dividual and social capacity he derives immediately&#44; 
without the intervention of a secondary power&#44; from 
the grace of the Creator only. If it could be true 
that a minor or equal power could be found in all the 
immense space which the Lord has called forth&#44; lie&#44; 
who is and was our God&#44; would have commanded us 
to acknowledge and obey him. This however is no&#8211; 
where pointed out&#44; nowhere hinted at&#59; and therefore 

<pb n="297"/>

THE DOCTRINES OF JUDAISM. 297 

as servants of the Most High we must reject every 
idea of such a secondary deity&#59; for to entertain it 
after Ave have been instructed of the will of God&#44; 
would be high treason against the majesty of Heaven. 
&#8212; Treason against human authority means a wilful 
rising in rebellion against tlie lawfully constituted 
authorities of a country&#44; on the part of those who owe 
them allegiance and obedience. We cannot indeed in&#8211; 
jm&#8211;e the Deity&#44; in the sense of the word a rebel can the 
person of the sovereign or the authorities of a coun&#8211; 
try&#44; by depriving the same of the ability to govern&#59; 
but as far as the actor himself is concerned&#44; he places 
himself beyond the pale of heavenly rule whenever 
he adores another being instead of God&#44; or he asso&#8211; 
ciates another in his mind as sharing the dominion 
of the world &#59; whereas to the Lord alone belongs the 
government&#44; and his are the greatness&#44; the majesty&#44; 
victory&#44; and glory. The universality of Providence&#39; 
proves that He is everywhere active in all that occurs 
in the world&#59; and the uniformity of the superintend&#8211; 
ence here discovered argues&#44; that there must of neces&#8211; 
sity be a oneness of design&#44; a singleness of purpose&#44; 
which can only proceed from one single sentient con&#8211; 
trolling Power&#44; with whom there can be no associate 
to share his prerogative&#44; or to limit his ability to work 
his will. 

This view of the Deity answers the question we 
propounded &#58; &#34; Why we should be religious V For 
if we can by any possibility bind ourselves closely to 
our God&#44; if by any act of ours we can draw down upon 
ourselves his love and approbation&#58; it follows that we 
are bound to do so&#44; both by motives of gratitude for 
his many favours&#44; and by a proper regard to the best

and dearest interests of ourselves&#44; seeing that we are 
entirely in the power of God&#44; who can make ns feel 
the weiglit of his indignation whenever in his wisdom 
lie may see tit to chastise us for our conduct. That&#44; 
however&#44; it is possible to bind ourselves to our Crea&#8211; 
tor&#44; or&#44; in other words&#44; to become religious&#44; is certi&#8211; 
fied to us in the revelation of his will which He gra&#8211; 
ciously communicated to us. He left us not in doubt 
whether or not we have duties to perform&#44; what these 
duties might be&#44; what we are to believe of Him&#44; and 
what we are to hope for or dread from the result of 
our course of life &#58; on the contrary. He himself be&#8211; 
came the Teacher of mankind&#44; and made himself 
known&#44; first through his works&#44; or&#44; as some call it&#44; 
the book of nature&#44; wherein is legibly written that 
the Author of so many beautiful&#44; great&#44; and wonder&#8211; 
ful things must be beyond measure&#44; good&#44; wise&#44; and 
powerful&#59; and secondly&#44; at a time when He thought 
fit to come in his glory to teach a law to the children 
of man&#44; the first truth He proclaimed was the ac&#8211; 
knowledgment of his being as the first principle&#44; the 
chief motive which should prompt their actions. It 
is not our purpose to&#8211;day to diverge to the other 
branch of religion&#44; to wit&#44; the duties&#59; though in 
passing we may say&#44; that in addition to &#34; why we 
should obey&#44;&#34; we were certified &#34; how we should 
obey&#59;&#34; in other words&#44; duties defined and deter&#8211; 
mined in their nature were laid before us for our ac&#8211; 
ceptance&#44; by following which we were told we should 
render ourselves worthy of the favour of our heavenly 
Master. 

The fundamental principle which lies as the chief 
incentive to the observance of duties is accordingly

the belief in God&#59; for witliout this conviction there 
could be no inducement whatever to practise any vir&#8211; 
tue&#44; saving only that mere sordid interest and per&#8211; 
sonal convenience could be pronjoted thereby. But 
it needs no great power of reasoning to prove that 
such a basis of action must lead to great evils&#44; when&#8211; 
ever the bad passions&#44; which form an integral part of 
human nature&#44; should&#44; from some cause&#44; become pre&#8211; 
dominant for the moment. Suppose&#44; for instance&#44; 
that jealousy&#44; hatred&#44; or revenge should be excited 
in an unbeliever in the Deity&#44; and arm him with a 
deadly weapon&#44; place his victim in the range of his 
murderous steel&#44; and if no human eye watches him&#44; 
the life&#8211;blood of his fellow will soon dye his hands&#44; 
and he Avill walk away&#44; perhaps unwhipped by the 
scourge of partial justice or corrupted tribunals&#44; glory&#8211; 
ing in his iniquity&#44; defying the power of the Invisi&#8211; 
ble&#44; who unseen and unbelieved in&#44; will yet watch his 
crime&#44; and mete out retribution when the hour of un&#8211; 
sleeping vengeance shall arrive. 

We now have two additional principles evolved 
from the first one named. That is to say &#58; that as 
there is a God&#44; there must also be a law&#44; if we mean 
to believe that lie takes cognizance of the acts done 
in the world&#59; or&#44; there must be an immutable rule&#44; a 
steady unvarying standard of right established by the 
Most High himself&#44; according to which every act can 
be measured&#44; and man can know whether to condemn 
the actor or to approve of his doings. &#8212; Lastly&#44; that as 
there are a God and a law of his ordaining&#44; there must 
be a reward and a punishment&#44; according to the mer&#8211; 
its or demerits of every one of our deeds. Let us 
explain ourselves. Since God necessarily loves his

creatures&#44; and as lie has given them a free scopato 
choose their own course of life&#44; it is impossible to be&#8211; 
lieve that He should not have placed somewhere a 
scheme of laws which must be universally beneficial. 
Individuals there are&#44; who feign to think for them&#8211; 
selves &#59; and these&#44; though often learned and of exten&#8211; 
sive acquirements and experience&#44; differ so widely iu 
their rules of life&#44; that the unwise and the inexperi&#8211; 
enced cannot take their instruction for a guide to lead 
them safely through the dangers and trials of life. If 
even we had no Bible&#44; we would search for some 
means to discover wdiat might be the will of God 
with regard to man &#59; we would seek for light&#44; and be 
sorely disappointed if our search were in vain. The 
very proneuess to idolatry and the establishment of 
false worships among men prove&#44; that there is a want 
in the human mind&#44; a longing in our souls&#44; which 
cannot be satisfied except it rest for support and aid 
upon the immortal essence of the Creator of man. 
Now the inferential existence of a divinely&#8211; revealed 
will is satisfactorily answered by the pages of the sa&#8211; 
cred Volume&#44; which is so familiar to our very nature&#44; 
being from early youth known to us&#44; either by our 
own study&#44; or at least by&#39; the conduct of all around 
us in some shape or other&#44; that we fairly forget that 
it is a treasure precious beyond price&#44; endued with 
wisdom&#44; far more than we can conceive. And yet all 
rejection of its behest&#63; will sooner or later prove to 
have proceeded from ignorance or from wilful blind&#8211; 
ness &#59; and that man never yet lived&#44; who on his dying 
bed ever regretted that he had remained a steady fol&#8211; 
lower of the precepts it inculcates. In short&#44; the pur&#8211; 
suit of the duties it teaches will bind us to God&#44; and 

<pb n="301"/>

THE DOCTRINES OF JUDAISM. 301 

will bring us liis peace whicli is so dear&#44; so consoling 
to the soul of man &#59; for what can the world do to him 
who is armed with the sacred panoply&#44; that impervi&#8211; 
ous armour of proof&#44; which the holiness of a religious 
life throws around him &#63;&#8212; But if such be the natural 
consequence of obedience&#44; it at once brings us to our 
proposition&#44; that there must be reward as the price 
of virtue&#44; which at last is nothing more than a strict 
conformity to the Bible in obedience to its divine 
Author &#59; and as this one branch of the idea embraces 
necessarily the other&#44; that of punishment for disobe&#8211; 
dience&#44; wo at once maintain&#44; that the existence of 
God and the fact of a divine legislation require&#44; to 
complete the moral motives for religious action&#44; the 
doctrine of reward and punishment. This proposi&#8211; 
tion does not mean that the merciful One delights in 
inflicting evil upon his creatures&#44; as some wicked 
men have pretended to find recorded in the Scrip&#8211; 
tures&#59; but that the disregard of the duties embraced 
in revelation either draws down evil on the perpetra&#8211; 
tors as a necessary consequence&#44; or that the evil com&#8211; 
mitted is of that dangerous tendency to the well&#8211;be&#8211; 
ing of society&#44; that the Almighty has either implanted 
such an abhorrence for the crime in the breast of all 
men&#44; that they will inflict condign punishments&#44; some 
of which are confessedly laid down or demanded in 
Scripture&#44; or&#44; where human power fails. He has re&#8211; 
served to himself the awful prerogative of causing 
the transgressors to feel the weight of his unerring 
justice&#44; seeing that they remained unmoved to grati&#8211; 
tude&#44; despite of the many benefits which He had be&#8211; 
stowed on them&#44; no less than on the rest of his crea&#8211; 
tion.

&#34;But&#44;&#34; says the timid doubter&#44; &#34; I see the wicked&#44;

and intellect&#44; surround his fireside &#58; is this retribu&#8211; 
tion &#63;&#34; No&#44; doubter&#44; this is not retribution&#44; it is in&#8211; 
dulgence&#59; God is merciful&#59; lie is long&#8211;suftering &#59; He 
sees not with human eyes&#59; lie measures not by a hu&#8211; 
man standard. There may be a mysterious link run&#8211; 
ning through a long series of years&#44; and be a good 
reason why the wicked one should be happy&#44; of which 
both you and I cannot form any conception &#59; and 
though we may wonder&#44; it is our duty as servants of 
God whom we wish to adore&#44; not to grumble at the 
blessings which He gives unto those we justly deem 
wicked&#44; even supposing that there is no error in our 
judgment. But independently of the retribution 
which may yet reach transgressors in this life&#44; there 
is the life of the soul&#44; which dies not with the corrupt&#8211; 
ible body&#44; and this extends the time of retribution 
beyond the mere short season of months which is al&#8211; 
lotted to man here below. With the body the spirit 
dies not&#59; and when the sinner is by death removed 
from his family&#44; who tlien cannot be temporarily even 
injured by the visitation which reaches his guilty 
soul &#8212; who can tell what the agonies may be with 
which the condemned is afflicted&#63; he may be con&#8211;

presence of the Lord where the pious ones dwell who 
have obeyed His wilh 

But it is not given to ns to understand&#44; much less 
to exphiin&#44; the state of blessedness or condemnation 
after death. All that is for us to know is&#44; that the 
Lord&#39;s power to send retribution for guilt is not con&#8211; 
fined to the few years that we are permitted to exist 
in this life&#44; and that the Scriptures speak distinctly 
of a state hereafter connected&#44; as it may be required 
from the conduct of man himself&#44; with a due system 
of reward or punishment. That there may be an 
hereafter has been proved from analogy by philoso&#8211; 
phers who had not the light of revelation &#59; and that 
it is so is certified to the believer by the words of 
Scripture&#44; which&#44; as we have laid down in the com&#8211; 
mencement of our subject&#44; ought to constitute as 
much the authority for our inward thoughts and 
opinions&#44; as they are our guide for our outward con&#8211; 
duct. The arguments and texts to prove this will 
probably be given on a future occasion &#59; but for the 
present we will merely lay down the three principles&#44; 
which we have endeavoured to elucidate in the fore&#8211; 
going remarks. There are&#44; to be sure&#44; other doctrines 
wdiich religion lays down for our acceptance&#59; but they 
are the consequences of revelation&#44; not principles on 
which to found our conduct in general. 

The Jew&#44; therefore&#44; is required to believe firmly&#44; 
unalterably&#44; unwaveringly&#44; these truths&#58; 

First. I believe that there exists one&#44; sole&#44; omnip&#8211; 
otent&#44; incorporeal&#44; eternal God&#44; who created&#44; solely 
and alone&#44; all the things which compose the entire 
range of nature&#59; that all spirit emanates from Ilim&#44; 
and that all matter is of his creation. Consequently 

<pb n="304"/>

that whatever homage and adoration man may offer 
to a superior power is due only to our God&#44; tlie Lord 
everlasting and King eternal&#44; before whom the migh&#8211; 
tiest are little&#44; the holiest impure&#44; 

Secondly I believe that in order to secure the hap&#8211; 
piness of the inhabitants of this earth&#44; and to let them 
know what is his will. He from the first beginning 
made himself known first to man in his innocence&#44; 
and afterwards in his state of sin&#44; and told him the 
duties he was to observe. And that&#44; when the de&#8211; 
scendants of this man forgot wilfully their allegiance&#44; 
the Lord punished them&#44; and raised up a people to 
whom He meant to confide his law in trust for the 
ultimate benefit of all mankind. And when&#44; accord&#8211; 
ingly&#44; the proper time had arrived&#44; his glory was made 
manifest before all this people&#44; and He spoke to them 
audibly&#44; and enjoined on them the duties they should 
obey. 

Thirdly. I believe firmly that the Lord is the Judge 
of all his creatures &#59; that&#44; seeing and knowing all our 
deeds&#44; He will without forgetting any punish with due 
visitation all transgressions against his law&#44; whether 
this be in this state of existence&#44; in the life to come&#44; 
or at the resurrection of the dead &#58; and that every act&#44; 
which is conformable to the religion of Heaven&#44; will 
be recompensed by a blessedness&#44; either temporal or 
eternal&#44; which the Merciful and All&#8211;just God whom 
we adore will adjudge to be commensurate with our 
deeds. 

Much more might be added to elucidate this sub&#8211; 
ject&#44; but we must forbear at the present&#59; having al&#8211; 
ready occupied nearly my usual time in this address. 
Yet my purpose will not be complete without calling

your attention to a passage in the Bible&#44; wliich is of 
the gravest importance&#44; and wliich nevertlielcss has 
been overlooked by too many persons. The Naza&#8211; 
renes liave boldly asserted that their religion was the 
first to proclaim the life of the spirit of man&#44; and its 
retribution after death &#59; they aver that the Pentateuch 
is silent on the subject&#44; and the passages of the proph&#8211; 
ets and psalms&#44; which hardly bear any other interpre&#8211; 
tation than as referring to immortality&#44; they do not 
regard as explicit enough. We&#44; of course&#44; do not ad&#8211; 
mit any claim to divine origin for their books of au&#8211; 
thority&#59; we reject them altogether&#59; so did our early 
teachers&#59; consequently if the new religion were the 
only foundation for the doctrine of immortality&#44; it 
could never have been admitted among the truths 
of the Jewish religion. ISTow&#44; whatever of obscurity 
persons may fancy to rest on the passages in the Bible&#44; 
none will aver that this is the case with the books of 
the Jewish doctors of later ages&#59; they one and all 
speak of reward&#44; of punishment&#44; of resurrection&#44; of 
judgment&#44; as matters of general acquiescence&#59; con&#8211; 
sequently they at least must have derived them from 
the general system&#44; whether traditional or scriptural&#44; 
current and accepted among them. Yet it would be 
easy to silence all cavil by a multitude of quotations 
from the Scriptures&#44; to prove what were the prophetic 
views on the subject&#59; for the present we will not do it&#44; 
but confine ourselves to the passage alluded to. You 
know that when Joseph had made himself known to 
his brothers&#44; he sent them back to Canaan to bring 
his father to him into Egypt. Israel&#44; in consequence&#44; 
travelled in the pursuit of his journey&#44; and came to 
Beersheba&#59; he was at that time one hundred and

thirty years old&#44; cntecl&#41;1cd by age and suffering&#44; and 
looking forward to u speedy release by the hand of 
death. In this phice he performed his usual acts of 
devotion in honour of the God of his father Isaac&#44; and 
during the following night the vision of prophecy was 
given to him in these words &#58; 

&#34;I am the God&#44; the God of thy father &#59; fear not to go down to 
Egypt&#44; for I will make thee there a great nation. I &#8212; even I will 
go down with thee to Egypt&#44; and I &#8212; even I will surely bring thee 
up again &#59; and Joseph shall put his hand upon thy eyes.&#34; Gen. 
xlvi. 3&#44; 4. 

What is precisely meant by the idea of the glory 
of God accompanying a man&#44; we cannot say with 
any degree of certainty &#59; it is spoken of in Scripture 
as the greatest blessing granted to the most right&#8211; 
eous&#59; in truth&#44; it is an idea too elevated for human 
nature to comprehend. But whatever it may be&#44; it 
was promised to the righteous father of our race&#44; 
when he was on his journey to the land where his 
mortal life was to close&#44; and where his children 
sliould become a great people. But observe&#44; breth&#8211; 
ren &#33; the phraseology of the words&#58; &#34;I will go 
down with thee to Egypt&#44;&#34; the glory of God would 
assuredly accompany him in his pilgrimage to the 
country where the blessing of the numerous progeny 
promised to Abraham was to be fulfilled&#44; as also the

nnnonncement of centuries of labour&#44; foretold at the 
same time. Consequently&#44; Jacob&#39;s eartlily life must 
terminate long before this could&#44; and&#44; in fact&#44; did 
take place. Still does the verse continue&#44; &#34;And I 
will surely bring thee up again&#44;&#34; evidently meaning&#44; 
that with the Israel&#44; bereft of life&#44; the spirit severed 
from the earthly covering&#44; the glory of God would 
go back from Egypt to Palestine&#44; whither the body 
was carried by his children after Joseph had literally 
closed his eyes. The blessing was given to Israel&#44; 
individually&#44; consequently in him alone could the 
accomplishment take place. The people were left 
behind centuries after Jacob&#39;s body was removed&#59; 
therefore his mortal clay was not even included in 
the glorious exodus from Egypt. But when the 
corpse of the archfather was carried up to his sepul&#8211; 
chre by a sorrowing people&#44; the glory of God&#44; prom&#8211; 
ised to be present&#44; was present&#44; and the purified 
spirit&#44; no longer sufiering with the corruptible flesh&#44; 
stood high&#44; exalted amid the righteous&#44; who are an&#8211; 
gels of mercy in the joyful presence of the Lord &#33; 

O may this be our portion&#44; Father of love and truth&#33; 
to be received by Thee&#44; to be taken up by thy glory&#44; 
to dwell in thy presence for ever more. Amen.

ON MIRACLES. 309 

Brethren &#33; 

In my last address I laid before yon the three prin&#8211; 
cipal articles on which onr religious system is fonnded. 
These were&#44; briefly&#44; the belief in the existence of God&#44; 
the existence of a revelation&#44; and the existence of ac&#8211; 
countability&#44; or a righteous scheme of rewards and 
punishments. We may say with perfect truth that&#44; 
without admitting the whole of these three&#44; there can 
be no religion&#59; for we would not submit to its re&#8211; 
straints&#44; if there were no Head and Chief&#44; capable 
through his wisdom and power to direct our will&#59; we 
could not obey Him&#44; if there were no prescribed rules 
which we could follow out in our course of conduct&#59; 
and lastly&#44; many&#44; if not all&#44; of us&#44; would not follow 
the dictates of an acknowledged Supreme even&#44; if we 
did not dread his power&#44; or looked up to Him for a 
favourable judgment on our deeds. Man may aver 
that he would practise what he terms virtue&#44; even if &#39; 
there were no God&#44; from motives of general benev&#8211; 
olence to his species&#59; exercise justice and mercy&#44; 
though there were no precepts to direct him&#44; it being 
most consonant with the refined feelings of human 
nature&#59; and lastly&#44; be good and righteous from no 
motives of reward&#44; from no fear of punishment&#44; but 
only because the good man must naturally love the 
good and eschew the evil&#44; simply because of their 
intrinsic qualities&#44; and because the inherent loveliness 
of virtue and the natural deformity of vice carry with 
them their own reward and punishment&#44; as the case 
may be. Such reasoning would hold good&#44; were man 
that perfect being which this theory would require 
him to be&#59; were he in a state of nature benevolent&#44; 
generous&#44; docile&#44; obedient&#44; honest&#44; chaste&#44; and sober&#59; 

<pb n="310"/>

310 ON MIRACLES. 

were lie&#44; when tempted&#44; always averse to practising 
vice&#44; though there were no fear of bodily injury to 
prevent him. But experience proves&#44; that man is 
only capable of a high degree of perfection&#44; not per&#8211; 
fect&#44; however&#44; in his natural state&#59; that even with 
instruction he may feel drawn towards benevolence 
and generosity&#44; and be capable of becoming docile&#44; 
honest&#44; chaste&#44; and sober&#44; and yet be the very reverse 
in his conduct&#59; and that lastly the abstract love of 
virtue is no safeguard against the desire for indul&#8211; 
gence&#44; if opportunity&#44; unchecked by outward restraint&#44; 
tempt the weak son of earth to taste of the dangerous 
fruits of self&#8211;indulgence. Without&#44; therefore&#44; enlarg&#8211; 
ing at present on these points&#44; we will reassert what 
we started with&#44; that without God&#44; revelation&#44; and 
retribution&#44; no virtue&#44; deserving of the name&#44; can 
have any existence&#44; no matter what the unthinking 
may say to the contrary. 

Besides&#44; however&#44; these necessary truths&#44; there are 
others which might have been otherwise&#44; but which 
have become incorporated with religion&#44; either as 
historical events&#44; or as the promises of the spirit of 
God&#44; which both must be admitted as true&#44; the hrst 
class&#44; as things which have actually taken place&#44; the 
second&#44; as certain to occur&#59; since the Being from 
whom they emanate is infallible&#44; and cannot&#44; there&#8211; 
fore&#44; predict or promise any thing which will not be 
ultimately fulfilled. 

Historical facts&#44; which serve as the basis of doc&#8211; 
trines connected with our religion&#44; are solely and 
alone to be looked for in Scripture&#44; which of itself 
bears internal evidence of its truth&#44; and is itself an 
liistorical fact&#44; or traditional truth of religion. In 

<pb n="311"/>

ON MIRACLES. 311 

the same manner the prophetic truths&#44; as we aptly 
term the promises of God&#44; are also contained in the 
same vehicle of faith&#59; and confeequently such only 
are to be admitted into the articles of our religion&#44; 
as are substantially borne out by internal consistency&#44; 
and supported by the words of the Bible&#44; in their 
evident and common sense meaning. This belief in 
the history and prediction of the Bible becomes the 
duty of every Israelite&#59; although this acquiescence 
in facts and promises would presuppose an admission 
of a state of things difl&#39;ering materially from every&#8211; 
day life&#44; in other words&#44; the truth of miracles&#44; which 
are produced by a change of nature as we find it 
organized through means of our bodily organs. 

It is true that revelation&#44; or the Biblical record&#44; 
contains also the commandment of the acknowledo&#59;&#8211; 
ment of the Deity as a part of divine legislation&#59; 
nevertheless this command did not establish the ex&#8211; 
istence of God as a new fact which did not exist 
before&#44; but merely recited this existence as a truth 
which had existed already from the beginning&#44; and 
which the sound common sense of man must admit 
as a matter of necessity more than of belief God&#39;s 
existence is not established by the precept&#59; but the 
precept was given because of his existence being the 
basis&#44; the starting&#8211;point&#44; upon which all good acts are 
founded&#44; and from which all virtuous resolves must 
proceed. So also the admission that there are acts 
which are pleasing to God is&#44; as we have said&#44; a pre&#8211; 
requisite for religion&#59; and if the record now contains 
such general directions as are evidently conducive to 
the general prosperity of society and the well&#8211;being 
of individuals&#44; we must say&#44; that these laws or facts

of revelation are not only true because they are com&#8211; 
manded&#44; but also because the human mind requires 
such directions to Satisfy its craving for what is in 
itself good and beautiful. But there are other facts 
recorded&#44; and other commandments given&#44; which 
need not necessarily be so&#44; and which might have 
been otherwise if God had so ordained it&#59; and though 
the latter are necessary now to a correct religious life&#44; 
human reasoning would not have discovered them 
by unaided research&#59; and they therefore do. not&#44; and 
many of them cannot&#44; appeal to our reason as a 
ground for believing the first and obeying the latter. 
But&#44; although the details of the Scriptures are not 
necessary truths&#44; they are manifestations of the will 
of the Lord&#44; who in this manner declared what lie 
chose to prohibit as evil&#44; and what lie wished to com&#8211; 
mand as good. In the same manner&#44; though the 
flood&#44; for instance&#44; was not a necessary consequence 
of the deeds of the Antediluvians&#44; as another punish&#8211; 
ment equally efficacious might have been dispensed&#44; 
its occurrence has rendered it an historical fact&#44; re&#8211; 
corded in the Bible&#44; and thus it has become a matter 
on which we are not at liberty to doubt or to ofier 
any speculations of our own&#44; inconsistent Avith the 
text of the sacred volume. The same holds good 
with almost every fact of which we have any account 
in the Bible. Yet it has to be observed&#44; that all the 
occun&#8211;eiices which are related to us&#44; although of their 
ti&#39;utli there can and ought to be no doubt on the mind 
of a believer&#44; are not of themselves articles of faith&#44; 
or that kindof facts which has a bearing on our course 
of conduct. In fact the greater number is merely 
recorded as having occurred in the course of the trans&#8211; 

<pb n="313"/>

actions&#44; which the Lord was pleased to permit being 
done&#44; and all such acts are only surprising or claim&#8211; 
ing our attention&#44; as they are of uncommon magni&#8211; 
tude&#44; or out of the ordinary course of events with 
which onr experience has rendered us familiar. It 
would evidently consume a great deal of time to 
glance merely even at all the facts of Scripture&#44; and 
to argue their reasonableness&#59; we will therefore only 
take up a few in connexion with some brief remarks 
on the miraculous power. 

Perhaps no one fact of Scripture has given more 
cause for cavil to unbelievers than the alleged im&#8211; 
probability of miracles&#44; especially as they do not occur 
before our eyes iu our own days. But let us look 
into the nature of any miracle recounted in the Bible&#59; 
take for instance the first mission of Moses&#44; when he 
beheld a bush flaming in fire without being consumed &#58; 
and it will strike you&#44; that the object of the appear&#8211; 
ance was not of a trifling kind&#44; not merely performed 
to show off an extraordinary power before an aston&#8211; 
ished audience&#59; but to introduce some great and im&#8211; 
portant event iu history&#44; which had an important 
bearing upon the affairs of mankind in general&#44; or at 
least to teach a true and wholesome lesson to the 
people before whom the transaction took place. To 
infer the probability of such an occurrence&#44; we should 
consider who caused the same to happen&#44; and what 
gives to general events&#44; of which we are informed&#44; an 
air of plausibility&#63; To commence with the latter part 
of our proposition &#58; &#8212; we say that we believe any event 
to have happened&#44; no matter how grand the elFect be 
said to have been produced&#44; if we can suppose that 
the means and streijgth of the agents were equal to

the effect said to have been produced. Let us take 
an example from an occurrence not now very rare&#44; 
but which was utterly unheard of within less than 
the age of many persons yet living&#44; that of a man 
ascending high above the earth in a machine of pecu&#8211; 
liar construction. Were we to be told that the aer&#8211; 
onaut accomplished this feat by means of a heavy iron 
structure&#44; and of complicated contrivance &#58; we would&#44; 
with our present impressions&#44; pronounce the thing 
impossible and untrue. But if we were to be informed 
that he employed an air&#8211;tight silken bag&#44; tilled with 
a well&#8211;known fluid&#44; many times lighter than the air 
we breathe&#44; and which will therefore float in the at&#8211; 
mosphere&#44; just as lighter substances will float on the 
surface of the water&#44; though partly immersed therein&#44; 
and that he was conveyed in this voyage in a frail car 
attached by ropes to the air&#8211;filled silken bag&#58; they who 
are familiar with the laws of nature&#44; as laid .open by the 
late discoveries in science&#44; would pronounce the rela&#8211; 
tion not alone probable&#44; but true likewise&#44; athough no 
ocular demonstration had made the thing manifest to 
their outward sensual organs. But suppose that&#44; be&#8211; 
fore the discovery of the existence of the different 
gases had been demonstrated&#44; and their respective 
specific weights had been determined&#44; one had pro&#8211; 
posed to accomplish a voyage in the air&#44; he would 
have been pronounced as attempting impossibilities &#59; 
or should he have succeeded&#44; by a natural process 
known to him only&#44; he would have risked an accusa&#8211; 
tion of witchcraft&#44; which would have been fatal to 
liim from the ignorance of those who witnessed his 
miraculous exhibition. Of course there are many 
hundred instances which&#44; at one time actually impos&#8211;

sible from the want of the proper knowledge of pro&#8211; 
ducing thcni&#44; have become of kite matters of common 
notoriety&#44; to such a degree&#44; that we cease to regard 
them with wonder. I will notice one single fact only&#44; 
bearing strongly upon our discussion. Before the art 
of printing was invented&#44; books could only be mul&#8211; 
tiplied Ijy the slow process of ti&#39;anscribing each letter 
separately&#44; one at a time. Just about four hundred 
years ago the inventive genius of man was led upon 
the idea of contriving the multiplying of transcripts 
by machinery of very simple construction&#59; and so 
wonderful were the cheapness at which books were 
oflered&#44; and the rapidity with which they were mul&#8211; 
tiplied by those who did not at once make public their 
mode of accomplishing this astonishing work&#44; con&#8211; 
sidered&#44; that the art was ascribed to supernatural 
agency and demoniacal power&#44; by those whose ig&#8211; 
norance caused them to doubt the possibility for man 
to accomplish that&#44; which in our day is too generally 
diffused to excite the smallest attention. 

This is the case where a mere mortal is the agent &#59; 
impossibilities to some are pastimes to others&#59; and 
what one age fails to realize&#44; becomes in a succeed&#8211; 
ing one matter of every&#8211;day occurrence. &#8212; Now let us 
ascend from man to his Maker. What is God&#44; re&#8211; 
garded as Master of the world&#63; All&#8211;powerful. What 
do we call all&#8211;poworful &#63; That He is able to do what&#8211; 
ever lie pleases&#44; every thing&#44; though it be beyond 
the power of accomplishment by the greatest of men&#44; 
nay&#44; even of all men combined. &#8212; AVliut is Jiature&#63; 
The organization of things in every state of exist&#8211; 
ence in all the extent of creation&#44; from the com&#8211; 
mencement to the end&#44; as God has ordained them&#44;

aiul as they were arranged by Ilim&#44; just in such a 
manner as seemed best adapted to tbe ends of his 
wisdom. &#8212; Can God change nature&#63; Certainly&#59; na&#8211; 
ture adds nothing to his power and greatness&#44; since 
lie alone has ordained it&#59; there is moreover no other 
power to interfere with Him in his judgment and the 
execution of his almighty pleasure. Consequently 
nature as an entire&#44; and as constituted of an infinite 
number of details&#44; becomes of itself subject to the 
immediate control of its sovereign Lord&#44; and lie can 
accordingly change&#44; alter&#44; or subvert it&#44; if his designs 
require such change. Indeed were miraculous power 
claimed by any other than the Creator&#44; we might 
freely say that it would be au impossibility &#59; because 
a miracle is contrary to the course of nature&#44; or that 
suprising system of organization established by the 
Supreme Wisdom. But when the Creator himself 
comes to instruct&#44; to govern&#44; to restrain&#44; to control&#44; 
to reward&#44; to punish&#44; &#8212; what&#44; we ask&#44; is to prevent 
Ilim from working a miracle&#63; Ay&#44; He changes na&#8211; 
ture&#33; but is the new arrangement any thing more 
wonderful than the ordinary course of events &#63; When 
there was darkness upon the face of the deep&#44; and 
the Lord spoke&#44; &#34;Let there be light&#58;&#34; was the in&#8211; 
stantaneous burst of the flood of brilliancy which re&#8211; 
joiced the face of creation&#44; till then buried beneath 
ages of gloom and desolation&#44; any less wonderful 
than the change of the waters of Egypt&#39;s river into 
stagnant blood &#63; or the sudden burst of hail&#44; rain&#44; 
and tire which whelmed that hapless country with 
despair and dread because of the sin of its ruler and 
inhabitants &#63; &#8212; Some indeed have of late years en&#8211; 
deavoured to render the Bible more credible&#44; by ex&#8211;

plaining all&#44; or nearly all&#44; the miracles recorded there 
by the ordinary laws of nature. In this they cer&#8211; 
tainly do not act wisely&#44; and scarcely honestly. The 
Bible claims for God the power of doing what He 
deems best&#59; it teaches that He empowered men&#44; act&#8211; 
ing under his special guidance&#44; to work astonishing 
things at different periods of the history of the world &#59; 
it tells us as facts that such events did happen &#58; and 
it is therefore not proper that we at this late day 
should attempt to do away with the evident meaning 
of Scripture&#44; by substituting our own fancies in its 
stead. It is certainly true that in several instances 
the miracles are within the range of the laws of na&#8211; 
ture&#59; for instance&#44; the locusts which devoured every 
thing in Egypt&#44; the destruction by a sort of earth&#8211; 
quake of Korah and his fellow&#8211;conspirators&#59; but in 
ail cases we shall see that it is not so nmch the event 
as the promptness of the occurrence&#44; which is dwelt 
upon as a sign or evidence of the truth of that which 
it was intended to verify. It does not derogate from 
the dignity of the Lord&#44; that He called in the aid of 
nature as it is already constituted&#44; as little as He is 
restrained by the non&#8211;existence of the thing He wishes 
to produce&#44; which his creative power has to summon 
into being&#44; before his will can be accomplished. 

We are too apt to think of the immaculate Sover&#8211; 
eign as we would think of a mortal &#59; in using the 
terms wonderful &#8212; impossible&#44; &#8212; we fancy that we have 
expressed something too great for every being&#44; the 
Supreme no less than ourselves. But when we say 
that any thing is impossible for us&#44; we only say that&#44; 
with our present capacities and powers&#44; we cannot 
accomplish the act mentioned &#59; but this does not say&#44; 

27&#42;

that another is equally weak with ourselves&#44; or that 
we also&#44; with an increase of energy&#44; proceeding IVoni 
any source&#44; either by the march of discovery&#44; or an 
augmented experience elaborated by our own mind&#44; 
might not be able to accomplish the thing conceived 
impossible. &#8212; Now grant even that not one miracle iu 
the Bible should ever be within the scope of human 
possibility&#44; it does not restrict in the least its being 
done by divine possibility. The acts of God are not 
limited by our will&#44; nor restrained by our power&#59; it 
is enough that lie wishes to do strange thir.gs&#44; and 
they are done. He created the sea and the dry land&#59; 
and when He means to let the waters flow over de&#8211; 
lightful valleys and fruitful mountains&#44; or to convert 
the ocean into fertile iields&#44; the change must take 
place&#44; and desolation speeds onward at his nod&#44; or 
prosperity hastens hither by the King&#39;s command. 
The word &#34;impossibility&#34; is not applicable to the 
Deity&#59; whatever exists is in being through his sufler&#8211; 
ance only&#44; and it is only existing because He has made 
it as it is. When now He finds it consonant with his 
wisdom&#44; of which fact He is the sole judge. He can 
80 change nature for the time being as to produce the 
intended eti&#39;cct&#44; or He can work counter to the ordi&#8211; 
nary course of events without deranging the same. 
Every source of events&#44; antl every thought in the 
moral&#44; with every cause in the material world&#44; are 
alike within his view and knowledge &#59; consequently&#39;&#39; 
He can arrange events in one spot of the creation 
without in the least aft&#39;ecting the other parts. So 
then&#44; if a miracle l&#41;e confessedly a breach of the laws 
of nature&#44; it is a breach produced by the great Ar&#8211; 
chitect himself&#44; who&#44; whilst effecting it&#44; has the mas&#8211;

tery over all nature&#44; so as not to injure or derange 
the other portions&#44; nor to break up the harmony 
which governs every sphere in the most distant orbit. 
It is said by some who&#44; while professing an intimate 
knowledge of the laws of nature&#44; doubt the truth of 
the Bible history&#44; that the occurrence of a miracle 
would subvert the course of nature&#44; and that conse&#8211; 
quently God would not&#44; if He could&#44; permit any such 
to take place&#44; &#8212; But such an objection has no force&#44; 
if we carefully consider what we have advanced al&#8211; 
ready. Were it that God&#44; having once fixed certain 
laws for the government of the universe&#44; had retired&#44; 
to use a human phrase&#44; from the active rule of things&#44; 
and left it altogether to these unalterable laws of his 
own institution &#58; then indeed might it be said that lie 
would not suffer any miracle to occur&#44; for fear of dis&#8211; 
turbing the universal harmony of creation. &#8212; Yet both 
reason and religion teach us a dilierent idea of the 
Supreme&#59; He not alone founded the structure of the 
universe&#44; but continues to superintend it by his wis&#8211; 
dom and direct overruling providence &#59; He is not 
wearied with watching&#44; nor fatigued by his exertions &#59; 
He is not overtasked in his labours&#44; nor inadequate 
to the part which lie has assumed&#59; He is the same 
as from the beginning&#44; and knows not sleep nor 
slumber&#44; and might&#44; wisdom&#44; and goodness are yet 
his characteristics as in tlie days of old. Now imagine 
a case where a great event is yet buried deep in the 
recesses of time&#59; the welfare of a large portion of 
sentient beings&#44; either on our globe or in one of the 
many other worlds which compose our Master&#39;s king&#8211; 
dom&#44; should require a chain of events to bring the 
desired occurrence to pass&#59; and imagine farther that

the ordinary course of things would be inadequate to 
bring it forth at all&#44; or not with sufficient rapidity and 
effectiveness&#58; &#8212; we Avould ask&#44; why should the Lord 
not abrogate for tlie time the laws of nature&#44; and make 
himself manifest as the Ruler of events by the occur&#8211; 
rence of an astounding thing&#44; one beyond the laws 
of nature to accomplish &#63; &#34;We have already proved 
that to God there is nothing impossible&#59; and his hav&#8211; 
ing left nature endued with such harmonious laws 
only places it beyond the power of creatures to arrest&#44; 
alter&#44; or destroy it in the smallest particular&#59; but to 
the Maker himself it must be evidently as easy to act 
counter to his own institutions&#44; if lie desires it&#44; as it 
was&#44; in the first instance&#44; to institute those laws of 
wonderful harmony&#44; to which the thousands of suns&#44; 
with their millions of planets&#59; to which on earth all 
the minerals&#44; all the mountains&#44; all the valleys&#59; &#8212; all 
the plants with their immense variety of flowers and 
fruits &#59; &#8212; all the animals&#44; they who range the forest&#44; 
and they who live in peace with man and are obedi&#8211; 
ent to his word&#59; the birds that sing amid the leafy 
branches&#44; and the fishes that sport in the sea &#59; &#8212; all man&#8211; 
kind&#44; from the sage whose lips drop the honey of wis&#8211; 
dom&#44; to the nursling in its mother&#39;s arms&#44; bow in silent 
submission&#44; acknowledging all their Maker&#39;s power. 
Already&#44; in the early part of the history of man&#44; 
we find an instance of unbelief recorded in one from 
whom such ought not to have been looked for. I al&#8211; 
lude to the announcement to Sarah&#44; that at the ex&#8211; 
l&#41;iration of a year she should be the happy mother of 
a son&#44; with whom the Lord would establish his cove&#8211; 
nant. She affected to consider the fulfilment impos#8211; 
sible&#44; having reached the age of nearly ninety in her

childless state. But the Lord reproved Abraham for 
the unbelief of his wife&#44; in these words&#58; &#34;Where&#8211; 
fore did Sarah laugh&#44; saying&#44; Shall I of a surety bear 
a child&#44; when lam old&#63; Is anything too hard for 
the Lord&#63; At the time appointed&#44; 1 will return unto 
thee&#44; at this time next year&#44; and Sarah shall have a 
sou.&#34; &#40;Gen. xviii. 13&#44; 14.&#41; This occurrence will serve 
us as an illustration for many other miracles. All 
that was needed to accomplish the prediction was to 
restore the youth of Sarah&#44; which she thought un&#8211; 
likely to occur. But from the child with which God 
meant to bless Abraham&#44; it was intended to raise up 
a people that should become the light of the world &#59; 
moreover it was deemed necessary that its mother 
too should be one who had a due knowledge of divine 
things&#44; fittingly to educate the son who should be&#8211; 
come the successor to the covenant of Abraham with 
God. However the superficial may view the subject&#44; 
it has had the most important bearing upon man&#44; that 
Abraham and his son Isaac were true worshippers in 
the time of general idolatry. Hence the birth of 
Isaac was thought worthy to be attended by a mira&#8211; 
cle&#44; in order to signalize more emphatically the sa&#8211; 
cred calling for which he was destined&#44; to transmit 
the blessing of true religion to the latest descendants 
of Adam. 

Now let us go down in our inquiries to later gener&#8211; 
ations&#44; and we will be surprised at the actually&#39; small 
number of prodigies recorded in the Bible. Were it 
then that this book should not be a true record&#44; the 
authors thereof would have introduced necessarily 
many attestations of their truth&#44; and Avould thus have 
recorded many wonders as proofs of their authentic&#8211;

ity&#44; if they once bad chiinied them to be within the 
range of divine economy. But from the time of 
Koah to the mission of Moses there are but few indi&#8211; 
cations of supernatural occurrences&#44; with the excep&#8211; 
tion of the confusion of tongues&#44; the destruction of 
Sodom&#44; and the manifestation of prophecy to various 
pious persons. When&#44; however&#44; we come to the time 
of the redemption of Israel&#44; we see a more evident 
display of the divine power before the eyes of man&#8211; 
kind. Why is this &#63; &#8212; Let us attempt an answer. The 
promise&#44; which had been given when the birth of 
Isaac was first announced&#44; had now ripened to a ful&#8211; 
filment. The descendants of Abraham had increased&#44; 
though in servitude&#44; and become a numerous nation&#44; 
distinct and separate&#44; despite of their being the fel&#8211; 
low&#8211;countrymen of a people of a diflferent origin and 
a peculiar mode of thinking. &#8212; But the promise of the 
Lord had to be fulfilled&#44; since He is the God of truth&#44; 
in whom there is no deception &#58; yet He found his 
people oppressed&#44; slaves to those who regarded not 
his name&#44; nor feared his power. How then&#44; we ask&#44; 
was the promise to be kept&#63; Should the Lord&#44; by 
his almighty influence&#44; so work upon the heart of the 
king of Egypt and his people as to cause the libera&#8211; 
tion of Israel&#44; without their having any outward cause 
to discover the potency of Him who had thus influ&#8211; 
enced them&#63; or should there be such manifestation 
of divine might that&#44; though unwilling&#44; the oppressors 
would have to acknowledge that the Creator was too 
mighty for mortals&#44; exalted above the strength of man 
and the idols which he had made for his worship&#63; &#8212; 
Either action would have been a miracle&#59; the first&#44; 
though inward&#44; no less wonderful than the second&#59;

for man is too tenacious of power&#44; too greedy for his 
own interest&#39;&#44; ever to relinquish his hold from a free 
accord upon the rights of others&#44; especially if&#44; as was 
the case in Egypt&#44; the governing class thought them&#8211; 
selves far superior to those they held in bondage. Yet 
if this inward influence alone had been exerted&#44; the 
effect would have been only very transient upon the 
minds of the Egyptians&#44; and quite unfelt by the Isra&#8211; 
elites&#44; despite of their being thus the recipients of the 
Lord&#39;s bounty&#59; they would have ascribed their free&#8211; 
dom to an act of grace on the part of their masters&#44; 
and would probably have little valued a boon so easily 
obtained. But the course indicated in the Bible was 
decidedly more calculated to produce a lasting effect&#44; 
and one much more likely to reduce such a man as 
the arbitrary king of Egypt to obedience. He was 
told that the Lord&#44; the God of the Hebrews&#44; demanded 
of him to let his people go free. He answered inso&#8211; 
lently &#58; &#34; I know not the Lord&#44; and also Israel I wall 
not dismiss.&#34; It was then that the Most High deemed 
it necessary to show the manifestation of his power 
which we find narrated in the first chapters of Exodus&#44; 
till Pharaoh was compelled to acknowledge the om&#8211; 
nipotence of the Protector of Abraham&#39;s sons. Dur&#8211; 
ing the time that these miracles transpired&#44; there was 
no cessation of the powers of nature&#44; except as it re&#8211; 
garded the bodies of the Egyptians themselves&#59; for to 
Israelites there was neither the plague of the pesti&#8211; 
lence&#44; nor injury from the wild beasts&#44; nor death from 
the hailstones&#44; nor darkness in their dwellings &#59; but 
all the afflictions were special creations to warn and 
punish thooc whom it was necessary thus to reduce 
to obedience to the divine commands. This will ex&#8211;

plain to us the first two verses of the tenth chapter of 
Exodus&#44; which speak as follows &#58; 

&#34;And the Lord said unto Moses&#44; Go unto Pharaoh&#59; for I have 
caused to be heavy his heart and the heart of his servants&#44; for the 
sake that I miglit do these my signs in the midst of them. And 
for the salie that thou mightest tell in the ears of thy son and of thy 
son&#39;s son that which I have wrought in Egypt&#44; and my signs which 
I have done among them &#59; and you shall know that I am the Lord.&#34; 

&#34;VVe have explained on a former occasion what is to 
be understood by the word hardening or making 
heavy the heart of Pharaoh&#44; and stated it to be noth&#8211; 
ing else than what we see every day among sinful 
men&#44; who do not open their souls to divine admoni&#8211; 
tion&#44; and remain callous to the wrathful dispensations&#44; 
which others around them consider as sufficient to 
open their eyes to the crroneousness and evil of their 
course. We then stated that the Lord must not be 
supposed as active in preventing Pharaoli&#39;s repent&#8211; 
ance&#44; but as not compelling him to pay obedience be&#8211; 
fore the chain of events had produced the necessary 
conviction on his mind. We have now merely to ap&#8211; 
ply the miraculous part to our to&#8211;dny&#39;s discussion. 
It has been stated before that&#44; like their masters&#44; the 
Israelites had learned to pay divine honours to idols&#59; 
witness the many murmiuings mentioned during their

travels in the wilderness. Now let us not forget what 
we have insisted on in several previous lectures&#44; that 
the ultimate salvation of all mankind was to be 
brought about by the education of the seed of Abra&#8211; 
ham as the Lord&#39;s peculiar people. They had there&#8211; 
fore need to be purified of their reverence for the 
superstitions of Egypt&#44; no less than to be cautioned 
against the pernicious practices unblushingly perpe&#8211; 
trated in that unhappy land&#44; which&#44; amid a high state 
of civilization&#44; was prostrated beneath the sway of 
idolatrous priests&#44; the coadjutors of despotism&#44; who 
enslaved the minds as much&#44; as the sovereigns did 
the bodies of the people. But when the Israelites be&#8211; 
held the destruction which reached alike the people&#44; 
the king&#44; the priests&#44; and their idols&#44; they could not 
help feeling that the power of the God&#44; who humbled 
all that were held up to them as objects of reverence&#44; 
must be vast&#44; infinite&#44; immeasurable &#59; that He who 
arrested nature at his mere word&#44; who made the 
winds his messengers&#44; and the flaming fire his ser&#8211; 
vants &#59; who covered the heavens with darkness&#44; and 
sent the angel of death unerringly into every house to 
slay the oldest of every family&#44; from the prince down 
to the captive slave&#44; must in truth be the Lord&#44; the 
Creator&#44; the Sovereign of the universe. He who builds 
up and destroys&#44; who revives and slays&#44; and that there 
is no one to snatch or save from his hands. This it 
was that should be told to the descendants of Israel&#44; 
namely&#44; that their God is the Most High&#44; who abideth 
unto everlasting&#44; unchangingly holy&#44; wise&#44; and pure&#44; 
great beyond human conception&#44; all&#8211;powerful in the 
execution of his will&#44; cognizant of nature&#44; and chang&#8211; 
ing its laws whenever He wills a change to take place&#59;

How glorious&#44; Lord &#33; is thy testimony &#59; how ex&#8211; 
alted the truth which Thou hast revealed to us &#33; All 
the works of man have crumbled before thy messen&#8211; 
ger of decay&#44; the flight of time over this changeable 
world &#59; and empires no less than moral systems have 
one by one jnelded to those which came springing 
up after them in the march of events. But thy word 
and thy law have stood unmoved&#44; firm as the Source 
from which they have sprung&#59; fresh and youthful 
amidst the hoariness and decay which have over&#8211; 
whelmed all else besides. Be it therefore thy will to 
let this great truth be deeply impressed upon our 
minds&#44; that we may make it the foundation of our 
life&#44; and the sure support of our hopes of a happy 
future. In order that our souls&#44; redeemed from the 
jaws of perdition&#44; in which sink they who are stran&#8211;

O&#44; Eternal One&#44; our God &#33; Amen. 

Brethren &#33; 

In the course of the inquiiy which we lately insti&#8211; 
tuted into the doctrines of the Jewish religion&#44; we 
stated&#44; that we must admit as one of them the possi&#8211; 
bility for God to work his will in whatever lie pleases&#44; 
though to do this. He should necessarily have to act 

<pb n="328"/>

328 ON MIRACLES. 

against the usual course of nature. &#34;We also stated&#44; 
that nature herself is a miracle&#44; or an efl&#39;ect of God&#39;s 
will&#44; to produce which nothing impelled Ilira but his 
own pleasure &#59; and that therefore it requires no greater 
creative powers to introduce temporary changes or 
permanent alterations in the regular course of things&#44; 
than to institute the same in the lirst instance. That 
God is the Creator&#44; admits of no doubt&#44; or else lie 
would and could be no object of adoration. That 
God is the Preserver of things&#44; follows from the very 
nature of the terms&#44; or else there must be a second&#44; 
to whom would in that case be transferred the pres&#8211; 
ervation of the universe&#44; who&#44; however&#44; would of ne&#8211; 
cessity have to be independent of the Creator&#59; for if 
the preserving power were not independent&#44; God the 
Creator would be&#44; what He is in truth&#44; the Preserver 
as well as the Creator&#59; and we have already shown&#44; 
that the harmony everywhere observable&#44; and the 
perfect accordance of cause and effect&#44; in the material 
world no less than in the history of the mind&#44; as far 
as this can be elucidated in the afl&#39;airs of mankind&#44; 
tend to prove that there is but one will&#44; one spirit&#59; 
hence there must be but one power&#44; one ruler&#44; and 
there can be no second&#44; independent&#44; coexisting being 
to share&#44; much less to dispute&#44; the superintendence and 
government of all objects and things that have their 
existence by the Supreme Creator&#39;s will. This will give 
us&#44; then&#44; what we claimed for God &#8212; the perfect and 
absolute power to do whatever He deems best&#44; with&#8211; 
out any&#8211; control or hindrance&#44; not only from any 
extraneous power&#44; but from the laws of organization 
as by Ilim instituted&#59; inasmuch as they are depend&#8211; 
ing upon his gracious pleasure for their continuance

ill existence&#44; but are by no means necessary to his 
happiness&#44; nor can they contribute the smallest item 
to his greatness and power&#44; farther than to prove to 
the sentient beings whom He has formed&#44; that He is in 
truth the Lord of lords and the King of kings&#44; the 
Creator of all spirits&#44; and the Author of all that is in 
the heavens above&#44; on the earth below&#44; and in the 
waters beneath the earth. 

In the instance of a skilful mechanician who has 
contrived a cunningly devised fabric&#44; with the joints&#44; 
screws&#44; levers&#44; and wheels of which he is necessarily 
perfectly acquainted&#44; we will readily believe that he 
may be able to introduce some alteration which&#44; so 
far from injuring the machine&#44; will render it more 
simple and ettective &#59; because we must admit that the 
one who has produced a thing so lifelike and wonderful 
is thereby not prevented from carrying the fruits of 
his invention yet farther into the regions of discovery&#44; 
which are totally inaccessible to ordinary minds. It 
would not be considered a mark of wisdom in any 
one to say&#44; that he did not believe the artist could 
alter his machine&#44; because there appeared to him no 
reason for this alteration&#44; and because he conceived 
that it was as perfect as it could be&#59; for&#44; admitting 
the objection to be true&#44; still that does not abridge 
the power of the master to do with his handiwork 
what he may think best&#44; and to alter it in any man&#8211; 
ner he may deem fitting in his superior experience 
and knowledge. JSTow extend this simple position to 
the Supreme Arcliitect&#44; who not only shaped the 
workl&#44; but created it from nothing&#59; who not only 
works with pre&#8211;existing materials&#44; but also calls them 
into being&#59; who is not only endowed with inventive

faculties which proceed from a superior source&#44; as 
man is&#44; but who is himself the Source of wisdom and 
understanding. And of Ilim shall it be said that his 
power is so circumscribed by his own rules&#44; that it is 
impossible that such a change should be wrought by 
Him in the magniiicent fabric which his wisdom has 
built&#63; The perfection of nature merely proves the 
greater perfection of its Creator&#44; &#8212; not that lie is un&#8211; 
able to construct a better one&#44; one yet more wonder&#8211; 
ful&#44; more free from evil&#44; more allied in purity to his 
own pure essence. And what does his holy Word 
teach us&#63; Simply this&#44; that step by step He organized 
nature&#44; and gradually perfected what He had made. 
At first He spoke&#44; and matter started forth in a vast 
expanse&#44; of which the human mind cannot conceive 
the end. It was yet rude and unformed&#44; for the will 
was merely to create a mass of things elements&#44; vast 
powers&#44; terrific in strength&#44; but as yet unorganized&#44; 
without determined individuality. Again He spoke&#44; 
and globes separated in wonderful array in the difier&#8211; 
ent regions of space&#44; revolving each around a centre&#44; 
all obedient to one directing will&#59; but there was no 
life&#44; no light&#44; no verdure&#44; in all their extent. Again 
He spoke&#44; and there was light&#44; springing from his 
own mighty being&#44; to illumine and to rejoice the face 
of nature &#59; and from then until now&#44; there was even&#8211; 
ing and there was morning in each sphere&#44; according 
to its own proper position in God&#39;s world&#44; and the 
blessing of light has not been withheld in its due sea&#8211; 
son from the many globes that thirst for its presence. 
Again the word went forth&#44; and the atmosphere of 
life&#8211;sustaining air was cast around our world at least&#44; 
and no doubt round many another likewise&#44; to be&#8211;

come the sustaiuer of animated beings that were to 
dwell upon the same thereafter&#59; and from the begin&#8211; 
ning till now&#44; the mixture of respirable gases has been 
80 nicely balanced&#44; so scattered far and wide without 
stint or scanty measure&#44; that every spot has always 
been supplied with a due portion for all that dwell 
there &#59; and this stream has always been everywhere 
of the same healthy proportions&#44; unless disturbed by&#8211; 
causes for which nature&#44; as such&#44; cannot be considered 
responsible. Scarcely were light and air provided&#44; 
when a separation of the elements took place &#58; the 
aqueous parts were collected into vast receivers&#44; and 
formed oceans&#44; lakes&#44; and rivers&#59; whilst the solid 
parts stood forth&#44; as mountains that pierce the clouds&#44; 
as sloping hills&#44; as pleasant valleys&#44; as rolling plains&#44; 
and as shelving beaches. And then suddenly sprung 
forth&#44; from the soil fitted for culture&#44; many thousand 
herbs&#44; plants&#44; and trees&#44; bearing fruit and seed&#44; all 
calculated to subserve the use of creatures of a higher 
order&#44; to be thereafter created&#44; and all adapted by 
various wonderful contrivances to propagate their 
species&#44; some by seeds&#44; some by layers&#44; some by 
roots&#44; and some by other methods&#44; known best and 
most admired and most dwelt upon with rapture by 
those who have penetrated into the mysteries of the 
great book of knowledge&#44; which nature everywhere 
unfolds. The orbs next&#44; which are capable of illu&#8211; 
minating by the light which radiates from tliem&#44; were 
assigned to dispense their invaluable treasures to the 
bodies which are opaque in their substance&#44; and 
which therefore need to receive this precious gift 
from others more blessed than themselves.

its Maker&#39;s presence&#59; the brilliant snn flics on in his 
course&#44; sending forth rays of glorious effulgence to 
gladden and to fructify the kingdoms assigned to 
him by his Creator&#59; and beneath his influence stand 
erect the lofty cedars on Lebanon&#44; waving to and 
fro their gloomy tops&#44; as the invisible spirit of the 
wind passes through them on his mysterious mes&#8211; 
sage to purify the heated atmosphere&#59; see in the 
valleys&#44; how brightly&#44; glowingly&#44; stands the blush&#8211; 
ing rose&#44; or the snow&#8211;white lily&#44; or lies concealed 
amid the verdant turf the modest violet&#44; or scents 
the gale the cinnamon tree in the farther India&#44; or 
spreads over the rosy sea the fragrant breath of the 
sweet shrubs of the happy Araby&#44; or smiles the per&#8211; 
fumed carnation in the fair fields of Asia&#59; whilst the 
gaudy peony&#44; the coral honeysuckle&#44; the tinted pansy&#44; 
or the simple daisy&#44; each contribute to deck the land&#8211; 
scape with an additional trait of loveliness. Behold 
in yon wide plain the mellow sea of ripening corn&#44; 
bending in graceful waves to the gentle breeze which 
sways them like the billows of the yielding ocean&#59; 
and the blushing fruits concealed almost under the 
dark&#8211;green leaves which shade them from the heat of 
the midday sun&#59; and listen to the dull&#44; gentle heav&#8211; 
ing of the sea&#44; as it dashes against the newly&#8211;formed 
strand&#44; gifted with fearful power when it rises into 
wrathful spray urged by the stormy blast&#44; but now 
playful&#44; placid&#44; bright&#44; harmless&#44; like an infant giant 
unconscious of his strength. And lo &#33; when the sun 
has set&#44; how sweetly beam the hosts of stars in their 
new state of innocence&#44; and shines the silvery moon 
sailing in her oAvn deep blue heaven&#44; the image of 
purity and truth &#58; &#8212; and say&#44; is not the scene beautiful&#44;

soothing&#44; enchanting in the extreme &#63; And yet there 
is no lii&#39;e&#44; nothing &#8212; nothing &#8212; that moves of a free 
accord from the spot on which it stands. ISTevcrthe&#8211; 
less&#44; the creation is thus far finished &#59; there is organ&#8211; 
ization&#44; and there are laws&#59; there are causes iniphmted 
in nature which must produce their eft&#39;ects&#59; and con&#8211; 
sequently there is a species of perfection already at&#8211; 
tained&#44; and there are beings who feel the impulse of 
their Maker&#39;s will. But say&#44; were God&#39;s powers ex&#8211; 
hausted when He had proceeded thus far&#63; was He 
withheld from doing more&#44; as soon as the suns&#44; the 
planets&#44; the elementary powers&#44; the light&#44; the atmos&#8211; 
phere&#44; the sea&#44; the land&#44; and vegetation had been fin&#8211; 
ished&#63; or was it a reasonable objection to his farther 
action&#44; that enough had been done&#44; and wisely done &#63; 
Both investigation into nature and the history of 
Holy Writ teach us quite another lesson &#59; for as soon 
as the earth had become fitted for the habitation of a 
different order of beings&#44; they were called forth to 
the light of day&#44; and soon the voiceless forests were 
filled with the song of many a feathered minstrel &#59; 
birds of gay plumage flitted among the groves of the 
sunny south &#59; the gaudy parrot chatted amid the 
branches of the orange and the palm&#59; and the change&#8211; 
able humming&#8211;bird sipped the honey from the open 
flowers which invited his restless wings to hover over 
them &#59; and the merry water&#8211;fowls sailed majestically 
down the northern rivers&#44; whilst the shores resounded 
with the sweet voice of the dusky nightingale. In 
the seas was placed tlie mighty whale&#44; who sported 
mirthfully and fearlessly on the face of the deep&#44; 
whilst he lashed into spray the dark&#8211;green waters as&#8211; 
signed to him for his habitation &#59; the rivers were alive

with the children of the finny tribes&#44; which rejoiced 
as they glided swiftly&#44; undisturbed in the element 
which sustains their life and gives them shelter. In&#8211; 
sects&#44; too&#44; in myriads&#44; dashed along on busy wings&#44; 
reflecting the brilliant light in their many gaudy col&#8211; 
ours&#44; and sought from the inward call of nature the 
home which was provided for each in the bosom of 
the earth&#44; on the face of the waters&#44; or the many fruit&#8211; 
trees&#44; shrubs&#44; and flowers which every where stood 
ready for their reception. 

But there were yet wanting some more beings&#44; that&#44; 
uniting more energy than falls to the lot of insects&#44; 
birds&#44; and fishes&#44; should have their habitation on the 
face of the earth itself. &#8212; Again stood the glory of 
God anew revealed in the many beautiful creatures&#44; 
that sprung at his creative word into life and being. 
They too sought out the homes which were suited to 
each&#44; where best their natural development could be 
carried to the utmost perfection&#44; where a due portion 
of heat&#44; and the proper sustenance were provided by 
the bountiful hand of their Creator. The arid fields 
of Africa beheld the tawny lion and the lioness watch&#8211; 
ing with anxious care and fearful strength their ten&#8211; 
der young. The sagacious elephant reared his tow&#8211; 
ering form amid the deep shady woods of the tropical 
land&#44; secure and careless because of the might of his 
limbs and the invincible power which had been im&#8211; 
parted to his matchless frame. The spotted tiger and 
the beautiful leopard ranged the forests and jungles 
of the Eastern countries&#44; whilst the graceful gazelle 
and the swift&#8211;footed deer fled with unapproachable 
speed over the extended plains. Here behold the

lino&#59; Ganges&#44; or the torrents of the river of Egypt&#44; 
whilst on the shores of many streams grazed the 
peaceful ox&#44; and lowed in the green pasture the use&#8211; 
ful cow&#44; regarding with maternal solicitude her new&#8211; 
horn calf. In the sands of Arahia yon might sec the 
prancing steed rushing on with resistless speed&#44; and 
pawing the soil&#44; that you would fancy the earth to 
shake beneath &#59; there ranged the wild ass&#44; hurrying 
on in his wild career&#44; free and untrammelled as the 
air he snulfed in with his extended nostrils&#59; there&#44; 
too&#44; browsed on the hardy shrubs of the desert the 
patient camel&#44; regardless alike&#44; by his habits of absti&#8211; 
nence and power of endurance&#44; the gnawings of hun&#8211; 
ger and the burning of thirst. On the grassy plains 
skipped joyfully the harmless sheep&#44; and the horned 
o&#8211;oat&#44; and over the Alpine precipices wended their 
way the daring chamois as they leaped from crag to 
crag in their unapproachable solitude&#44; whither naught 
ascends but the strong&#8211;winged eagle or the mighty 
condor. And there where the cold offered a fitting 
habitation&#44; stalked abroad the shaggy bear&#44; or showed 
itself the stately reindeer&#59; every wdiere was life&#59; &#8212; 
every where stood before the light of the sun the 
beautiful works of the great Creator.&#8212; If we thus 
view the Lord as the Author of the earth only&#44; we 
shall find cause enough to admire his power and his 
infinite ability to work his will&#44; seeing that the eftccts 
produced thereby are so varied and surprising in their 
organization. But this is not all &#58; the system of na&#8211; 
ture in which we live is of immense extent&#59; no man 
lias yet measured its greatness&#44; no man will ever un&#8211; 
derstand its astonishing structure. And wherever

our imagiuation can grasp&#44; there must be the same 
tokens of power and goodness which are discoverable 
on earth &#59; for knowing as we do how good the Al&#8211; 
mighty is to the inhabitants of the terrestrial globe&#44; 
we cannot imagine that there should be so many 
worlds which we can see nightly with our eyes&#44; re&#8211; 
volving in the immensity of space the end of which 
we cannot discover&#44; existing uselessly&#44; surrendered 
to dreary desolation&#44; without atmosphere&#44; vegetation&#44; 
and life. But if it even were so&#44; that all else in crea &#8211; 
tion but our own earth were desolate and dreary&#44; there 
would still be enough to satisfy the most incredulous 
mind of the ability of God to work his will in all He 
desires. Look at the various countries which chequer 
the face of the globe &#59; examine the variety of climates&#44; 
and temperatures&#44; and vegetables&#44; and animals which 
are assigned to each &#59; reflect on the peculiarities of 
the ocean&#8211;breeze which renders the tropical sea&#8211;coasts 
habitable to the white race of man&#44; and the brilliant 
northern or southern lights which illumine and break 
the dreariness of the winter in the higher latitudes. 
Consider also the peculiar adaptedness of the polar 
animals to live readily in rigorous climates&#44; by the 
additional coat of thick white fur which every year 
defends them against the cold of the frozen season&#44; 
or the instinct which teaches others to hide in a living&#8211; 
state of suspended animation in the depth of caverns&#44; 
or in hollow trees&#44; or in sandy banks where tliey pass 
away the months when ice antl snow cover the ground&#44; 
in a happy forgotfulnoss of the storm which rages 
without&#44; and which would prove fatal to their exist&#8211; 
ence. Then turn to the astonishing organization of

by thoir physical&#44; and not unfrequeiitly by their men&#8211; 
tal developments&#44; for the yery countries where we find 
them phiced in a state of nature. Moreover&#44; reflect 
upon this peculiar fact&#44; that a race originally liying 
in one sort of climate&#44; is materially changed in one 
or two generations if transplanted to one of a difterent 
degree of heat&#44; so as to render it in a great degree 
better adapted to bear the especial hardships which it 
has to encounter in its new home. Kay&#44; more&#44; let us 
ponder upon the astonishing truth&#44; that the same man 
when quitting his own country for one at a distance 
from his own often becomes acclimated&#44; and in a man&#8211; 
ner physically changed&#44; in order to render him a fit 
inhabitant of the place which he has chosen for his 
residence &#58; &#8212; consider all these facts&#44; and you must ac&#8211; 
knowledge that there is enough on this earth to make 
you stand astonished at the power of the Creator. 
For there is evidence of design and forethought in all 
this &#59; the very exceptions we meet wdth to these gen&#8211; 
eral rules&#44; prove that nature as an inert uniform agent 
cannot cause them&#44; or else there could be no excep&#8211; 
tions &#59; but the exertions of a Power so eminently be&#8211; 
neficent&#44; so nearly universally uniform in its working&#44; 
demonstrates it to be one of intelligence&#44; and of liv&#8211; 
ing&#44; active&#44; all&#8211;pervading wisdom&#44; which is not limited 
in its strength&#44; not defined by any outward agency. 

But we are leaving our subject. We wanted to 
portray merely the wisdom and power of God as dis&#8211; 
played in his creation&#44; and to exhibit Ilim as working 
miracles in every thing which meets our view. We 
stated that the creation was a miracle&#44; and we may 
freely rest satisfied with the rapid view we have taken 
of its origiq and its causes. &#8212; At every step in advance

which nature took under the creative commands of 
the Lord&#44; He miglit hav&#39;e restricted it and rested&#44; if 
so it had pleased his wisdom&#59; He needed not to have 
added one more miracle to those already wrought 
before &#59; but He willed it otherwise &#59; and as the world 
was more blessed with creatures of beauty&#44; power&#44; 
and usefulness&#44; at each successive period of the forma&#8211; 
tion of the universe&#44; his wisdom&#44; his glory&#44; his good&#8211; 
ness&#44; his might&#44; were rendered more evident for the 
intelligent beings whom He designed to frame&#44; as the 
crowning work of his creation. &#8212; We traced the earth 
as divided into sea and land&#59; as surrounded with an 
atmosphere of living air&#44; as illuminated and warmed 
by mighty worlds which shine by day or appear at 
night &#59; we beheld it decked with plants of a thousand 
diflerent kinds&#59; we saw it peopled with many living 
things which have their home in the air&#44; on the land&#44; 
or in the water&#59; but there was yet no animal so like 
the divine majesty of the Author of all&#44; as to utter 
its thoughts in words&#44; to reflect in a continuous train 
of reasoning&#44; to feel the weight of responsibility&#44; and 
to choose from free reasoning between good and evil. 
&#8212; The thought to create such a one ascended&#44; if we 
may so express ourselves&#44; before the Lord &#59; and 
straightway the thought became will&#59; the will went 
forth into the creative word&#59; the dust&#44; of the earth 
assumed the shape of the human form&#59; the breath of 
divine life was breathed into the mortal clay&#44; and man 
stood there a creature of the earth&#44; fired by a soul of 
unending endurance&#44; whilst nature holds sway&#44; whilst 
the existence of the universe is suifered to continue 
by the will of its Maker. How wonderful is this 
creature &#33; how fearfully great is this body of ours &#33;

Low surprisingly sul&#41;lime the soul which lives within 
us&#33; Well might David exclaim&#44; when feeling the 
great power of the Lord as displayed in his works&#44; 
and especially in the formation of the human body &#58; 
&#34;I will praise thee&#44; for I am fearfully and wonder&#8211; 
fully made&#59; marvellous are thy works&#44; and that my 
soul knoweth right well.&#34; &#40;Psalm exxxix. 14.&#41; In 
truth&#44; the more you investigate the various combina&#8211; 
tions of bones&#44; of muscles&#44; of veins&#44; of ligatures&#44; of 
sinews&#44; of channels&#44; of viscera&#44; of fluids composing 
the human body &#58; the more will you be surprised at 
the extraordinary adaptation of each part to the ends 
of its formation &#59; and it is not an ignoble study to 
trace the developments and uses of every particular 
part of our body&#44; especially if the student rises from 
his investigation with a deeper reverence for his God&#44; 
with a profounder humility for his Creator. Men of 
research have argued from the economy of animal life 
the existence of design in the creation&#59; they have 
proved that so wonderful a mechanism could not&#44; by 
any possibility&#44; be the effect of chance &#59; and truly is 
it so &#33; if the beautiful flower displays in its shape&#44; its 
colour&#44; its odour&#44; the undeniable goodness of God&#44; the 
animal frame no less demands of us to acknowledgre&#44; 
that He who so contrived each part to answer in the 
best uianner the object for which it was required&#44; who 
repeats the same arrangement in so many millions of 
creatures from age to age&#44; from generation to genera&#8211; 
tion&#44; cannot be otherwise than wise and intelligent&#44; 
able to work his will&#44; and designing all lie does for 
a special and useful object. 

So much with regard to the body. But is the soul 
less wonderful&#63; No&#44; no&#33; it is this which constitutes

the essence of man&#44; Avbicli gives him dominion over 
the other creatures. Regai&#8211;d well the gradual devel&#8211; 
opment of the mind of an infant&#44; and the instinct of 
the inferior animals &#58; and how surprisingly great will 
the difference strike you &#33; The animal soon reaches 
the full growth of its body&#44; and equally speedily all 
the few attainments which are within its grasp. But 
the human infant grows slowly&#44; and as slowly does 
its intellect increase in intensity and comprehensive&#8211; 
ness&#59; it has much to learn&#44; and therefore the age of 
childhood is long continued&#44; that it may not be di&#8211; 
verted by the cares of seeking a livelihood which fall 
to the share of brutes&#44; from attending to its mental 
cultivation. There may appear&#44; at first sight&#44; some 
degree of hardship in this state of feebleness &#59; but it 
leads to the great results which every where appear 
to demonstrate&#44; that subordination&#44; obedience&#44; and 
gratitude&#44; are the means of government Avhich the 
Lord designs for the world. It is thus that the weak&#8211; 
ness of the child renders it necessarily subordinate to 
its parents &#59; it next is the source of the child&#39;s obedi&#8211; 
ence to the wholesome counsels of its wise benefac&#8211; 
tors and progenitors&#44; and at length influences it with 
feelings of gratitude for the many tavours conferred 
unceasingly and uncomplainingly&#44; and induces it to 
follow now willingly from a free choice&#44; the lessons 
of wisdom which it has learned in early infancy. In 
this manner w&#8211;e shall discover by a careful inquiry 
that&#44; provided the mind be not too overtasked at the 
very outset&#44; and that our researcli be confined within 
the ample bounds which God has set for its exercise&#44; 
man can acquire an astonishing number of facts and 
ideas &#59; and not alone this&#44; but he can enlarge upon 

<pb n="341"/>

ON MIRACLES. 341 

what ho has received&#44; and add greatly to the general 
stock of knowledge hy the elucidation of new truths&#44; 
and the careful analysis of previously known ideas in 
almost every branch of knowledge. It is barely 
necessary to advert to the power of speech&#44; which so 
surprisingly marks the human species&#44; whereby one 
communicates the nicest shades of thoughts which 
agitate him to the comprehension of others&#59; or to 
the faculty of informing one another by written char&#8211; 
acters of things done in the absence of those we wish 
to instruct&#44; and by which we know what has passed 
in former ages&#44; and by means of which we treasure 
up our thoughts for future generations. All these 
are powers peculiarly appertaining to mind&#44; wherein 
matter&#44; as far as we understand it&#44; can exercise but 
little if any agency&#44; any farther than a corrupt and 
diseased body is a fit instrument for the soul to eifect 
therewith its objects and purposes. 

It will thus be seen that&#44; as we view each succes&#8211; 
sive act of the Creator&#44; from the formation of the 
rude mass of the material world to the communicat&#8211; 
ing of spirit to man&#44; we must come to the conclusion 
that his ability to work his w&#39;ill is unlimited in ex&#8211; 
tent&#44; and unconfined to any period of time &#59; seeing 
that in every epoch of creation&#44; whether this mighty 
event lasted six days only&#44; as the simple words of the 
Bible would seem to indicate&#44; or whether it lasted for 
many centuries&#44; as the philosophers assert&#44; and which 
is not altogether contradicted by Scripture&#44; his power 
was exercised to add to creatures already&#39; existing 
others equally or more wonderful&#44; and all proceeding&#44; 
as their predecessors had done befoi&#39;C&#44; from his will 
solely&#44; without there being the least force&#44; necessity&#44;

or inducement from any other source whatever to in&#8211; 
fluence his will&#44; or to urge on his action. 

&#34;When therefore the whole earth had been finished&#44; 
and it was peopled in every part thereof with things 
of life&#44; things of growth&#44; and those which are not in&#8211; 
creasing as animals and plants do&#59; when man had 
been placed there to rule over every thing beneath 
him in the scale of being &#58; the miraculous power of 
the Lord did not thereby cease and become extinct. 
On the contrary&#44; we would derogate from his dignity&#44; 
deny his omnipotence&#44; even doubt of his being&#44; were 
we to assert that&#44; with the creation of the material 
world&#44; the whole of God&#39;s will was accomplished. 
No&#44; He is yet almighty&#44; and will continue to be so to 
the end of all creation &#59; and when every thing shall 
have ceased to be&#44; if so this be his ultimate will&#44; then 
will He yet be&#44; without all this wonderful organiza&#8211; 
tion. King&#44; God&#44; Almighty&#44; able to reproduce the 
same or another world&#44; as soon as He deems it best 
to do so. Upon this we rest our belief in the truth 
of miracles. With the formation of Adam&#44; the work 
of creating was not complete. True&#44; the material 
world had received an organization&#44; which&#44; for all 
that we know&#44; may be final &#59; but the spirit was yet 
to progress&#44; just as the soul of a child advances under 
the guidance of parents and teachers. But the 
teacher of the world needs to be the Lord himself&#44; 
who must himself instruct&#44; and educate&#44; and correct 
the works of his hands. We&#44; therefore&#44; are satisfied 
that He has actually left the world at large in a state 
of infancy&#44; and from age to age He permits improve&#8211; 
ments and new developments to take place which 
were unknown before that time. And are these dis&#8211;

covci&#39;ics not iu a measure wonderful&#44; even somewhat 
miraculous&#44; when we consider the immense influence 
they have from time to time upon the whole frame&#8211; 
work of society at large&#63; It was&#44; therefore&#44; that&#44; 
when the world had so far progressed as to be ready 
in a small degree for the reception of the law which 
God had ordained from the beginning &#40;for we main&#8211; 
tain that every principle of the moral law was&#44; from 
the necessity of the case&#44; always unalterably fixed in 
the mind of the Lord&#41;&#44; He revealed himself by new 
creations&#44; by changing things already existing&#44; by 
infusing new powers into objects otherwise inert or 
inefiicient&#44; to demonstrate his almighty power&#44; and to 
eft&#39;ect his unalterable will&#44; to teach mankind the truth 
of his omnipotence&#44; and to induce them to look upon 
Him with hope and confidence. So was the rod of 
Moses no more in itself than another branch of a 
tree on which man leans for support. But wielded 
by the prophet in obedience to the command of God&#44; 
it assumed the shape of a devouring serpent&#44; it con&#8211; 
verted the waters of the Nile into blood&#44; it changed 
the dust of the earth into noxious vermin&#44; it produced 
hail and thunder in Egypt&#44; it divided the sea for the 
passage of the Israelites&#44; it brought forth water from 
the flinty rock&#44; and at length was sanctified by a 
repetition of the same event in the last year of the 
seer&#39;s life. All this was done&#44; all the miracles ex&#8211; 
hibited during that fruitful period of great events 
were performed&#44; that the world might become pre&#8211; 
pared through Israel&#44; the children of Abraham&#44; for 
the reception of the law of God. This important step 
in the gradual progress of the human mind required 
a powerful impulse&#59; and this is the best explained iu

the miracles recorded as having been wroiicrht to 
bring this truth home to the people of Israel&#44; that 
the law they were to receive must indeed be the veri&#8211; 
table gift of the Lord&#44; seeing that He alone could 
effect the acts&#44; contrary to the course of nature&#44; which 
occurred before their eyes. Does any one of you 
believe that it was a mere idle parade of wonderful 
power which was the object of the miracles&#63; He 
would certainly be in error&#59; for we find explicitly 
stated in the iirst appearance of the divine prophecy 
to Moses&#44; as the result of all that he saw&#58; &#34;And 
this shall be the sign unto thee that I have sent thee&#44; 
when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt&#44; 
ye shall serve God upon this mountain.&#34; &#40;Exodus iii. 
12.&#41; Tliis evidently means that all the miracles 
would be as naught&#44; were it not for the public proc&#8211; 
lamation of the law&#44; which had already for centuries 
been inscribed in the presence of God&#44; as the Rabbins 
figuratively say&#44; with black upon white fire&#44; so pure 
are its words&#44; so sacred its ordinances &#33; as a gift of 
the Lord to the children of man. 

We will therefore maintain that the miracles were 
necessary accompaniments of this wonderful exhibi&#8211; 
tion &#59; it was the &#40;creation of a new mind&#44; the divine 
wisdom of the law&#44; which the Lord purposed &#59; and 
this event&#44; in itself as wonderful as the formation of 
the universe&#44; in fact&#44; itself a suspension of the law of 
nature&#44; since mortals became cognizant in a direct 
manner of the intentions of God&#44; which is unattain&#8211; 
able in the ordinary course of events&#44; was preceded&#44; 
accompanied&#44; followed by the works of nature feeling 
likewise the presence of the Supreme&#44; more imme&#8211; 
diately than at other periods of history. &#8212; Was the

object worthy of tins divine manifestation &#63; &#8212; Yes&#44; 
truly it was&#59; God meant to teach the world&#44; and his 
works became terrified&#44; to use the Bible phrase&#44; at 
his presence&#44; the hiws of nature relaxed in their hold&#44; 
when the Sovereign himself assumed the rule in his 
glory and might. And so sings Assaph&#44; the man 
who knew the service of the Lord&#44; and spoke forth 
his thoughts from a worshipping heart &#58; 

&#34; Thy way&#44; O God&#44; is in the sanctuary&#44; what god is so great as 
God&#63; Thou art the God that doest wonders&#44; thou hast declared thy 
strength among the people. Thou hast redeemed with thy arm 
thy people&#44; the sons of Jacob and Joseph &#8212; Selah. &#8212; The waters saw 
thee&#44; O God I the waters saw thee &#58; they were afraid &#59; also the 
depths were troubled.&#34; Psalm Ixxvi. &#59; 14&#8211;17. 

Without a public manifestation of the Lord&#44; the 
world would not have accepted the law&#44; notwithstand&#8211; 
ing its truth and holiness&#59; the miracles were&#44; there&#8211; 
fore&#44; the most natural means to effect the great end 
of Providence. Well might the earth shake&#44; light&#8211; 
nings play athwart the gloom&#44; the thunder roll in 
terrific echoes along the crags of Sinai &#59; well might 
the fire shoot heavenward from the peaceful Iloreb&#39;s 
peak &#59; well might nature stand affrighted at the awful 
Presence&#59; for there were combined all the elements 
of power and grandeur. And truly the manifesta&#8211; 
tion was not in vain &#59; the miracles were indeed tran&#8211;

sicnt&#44; for now Sinai sleeps qnietly&#44; a pasture for tlie 
flocks of tlie desert &#59; tbe Ilcd Seu admits not now the 
passage of a mighty host&#59; the vision of the prophet 
no more enlightens the mind of Israel&#39;s sons. Yet 
the law remains&#44; the desired creation of the light of 
the soul was effected&#44; established forever&#44; equally so 
witli the grand chains of the Andes mountains&#44; which 
stand as the frame of the earth&#44; that she may never 
be moved. And if storms assail the holy legacy&#44; if 
furious onsets of adversity threaten danger to its 
upholders &#58; the fury will in vain exhaust itself&#44; the 
danger will pass&#44; and leave the troubled sky more 
serene&#44; more unclouded than before. And though 
now the miracles have ceased among us&#44; the time will 
come&#44; when the farther developments of the will of 
the Lord will render again familiar his presence 
among us&#44; when all the earth shall see that the word 
of the God of Jacob is true&#44; abiding among us for 
ever. 

Bless&#44; O bless&#44; our Father &#33; thy children&#44; as Thou 
hast blest their fathers who feared Thee&#59; let thy 
countenance shine unto them&#44; and fill their souls with 
the abundance of peace which is ever before Thee&#59; 
and let thy light be their joy and support in every 
stage of their lives. And when adversity comes nigh 
unto their dwellings&#44; do Thou&#44; O Lord &#33; interpose 
thy protecting hand&#44; and cover with the panoply of 
thy sljield those who seek refuge under the shadow 
of thy wings. May this be thy will. Amen.

We have in the preceding lectures shown that the 
unlimited power of God renders it possible for Him 
to exercise his pleasure without the least regard to 
that which in any but the Creator would be beset by 
insurmountable difficulties. Man&#44; we stated&#44; works 
with preexisting materials &#58; God produces the ma&#8211; 
terials likewise. Man is bound within the limits of 
divine arrangement&#59; he cannot displace the smallest 
partick&#8211; oi&#39; the immense system in which he exists&#44; 


<pb n="348"/>

348 ON MIRACLES. 

and of which he is a minutely small integral portion&#58; 
whilst God is the Maker of this system&#44; and has no 
one superior to himself to circumscribe his will within 
the limits of laws and space. A miracle&#44; therefore&#44; 
if it should not conflict with the designs of the Lord&#44; 
or&#44; rather&#44; if lie chooses to work one by his own im&#8211; 
mediate power&#44; or suffer any spiritual or corporeal 
creature to efiect the same&#44; is within the range of 
possibility&#44; and its having occurred is then rendered 
probable&#59; or&#44; in other words&#44; we believe that it has 
occurred&#44; if the evidence be sufficient to produce the 
conviction of its truth in our minds&#44; or if the effect 
stated to have been brought about&#44; and which we 
know from circumstances to have occurred&#44; be such 
that ordinary every&#8211;day causes could have produced 
it but imperfectly&#44; or not at all&#44; as the case may be. 
We will now&#44; therefore&#44; define what the Bible calls 
N&#94;3 or a wonderful unnatural occurrence&#44; that it seems 
to designate an eli&#39;ect produced by the power reserved 
to the Creator alone&#44; to effect changes in the ordinary 
course of events&#44; which take place to impress a certain 
truth or to work some powerful conviction upon the 
minds of intelligent beings&#44; or at least to arrest their 
attention. &#8212; Let us consider the nature of man. He 
finds himself placed upon earth with an intellect 
vastly superior to every other creature around him. 
lie soon feels this importance swelling high in liis 
bosom&#44; and straightway he thinks of schemes of ag&#8211; 
grandizement&#44; and perchance sees unlooked for suc&#8211; 
cess crown his efibrts. Thoughts which were dear 
to him in an humbler sphere&#44; in the days when his 
mind had not reached its great development&#44; are now 
discarded as unfit for one so great in wealth&#44; so re&#8211;

nowned in wisdom&#59; and he enters new paths of life&#44; 
he invents new schemes of thoughts and feelings at 
variance with the early lessons of infancy. But just 
as an individual throws oft&#34; the lessons of early years&#44; 
just as prosperity and success induce him to regard 
himself as superior&#58; so also are entire nations afiected 
by the whisperings of pride which follow on the path 
of success and civilization &#59; and with every step iu 
advance&#44; entire communities have at all times been 
found to regard with more or less contempt the ideas 
which were formerly&#42; cherished as true and unan&#8211; 
swerable&#44; and have also introduced changes in their 
conduct which were far from improvements. &#34;With 
individuals so acting there are within the power of 
God the terrors of disease&#44; of mental suft&#39;o rings&#44; of 
deprivation of wealth&#44; of death of the beloved&#44; to 
recall the wanderers to the path of righteousness&#44; to 
remind them that their course is not one of wisdom&#44; 
and to admonish them&#44; whilst it is yet time&#44; to retrace 
their evil steps. With nations&#44; too&#44; there are national 
punishments&#44; which the Almighty wields to correct 
the crying evils which have been committed by an 
entire body politic&#59; since He lets liis voice be heard 
in the alarum of the war&#8211;trumpet&#59; causes his might 
to be seen in the scanty yield of the fruits of the earth&#59; 
in the raging pestilence&#44; which slays its thousands and 
its ten thousands&#59; and terrifies those who live in sinful 
security&#44; by bidding the ground to heave beneath their 
feet&#44; and reel to and fro like a man that is drunk with 
wine. 

&#42; This fact has been conclusively proved by the radical changes 
in political ideas and measures since this was written&#44; both in Eu&#8211; 
rope and America. In fact&#44; history is full of such examples.

350 ON MIRACLES. 

We will not now inquire how much of truly mirac&#8211; 
ulous power is directly displayed in all of these ap&#8211; 
parently natural occurrences&#59; we will not now claim 
that the very periodical visits of war&#44; of famine&#44; and 
of pestilence&#44; are such proofs that the Lord is supe&#8211; 
&#8211; rior to the laws of nature&#44; which in themselves are 
unable to produce these results&#59; but we will assume 
the position&#44; that it may in the providence of God be 
necessary to produce an effect without resorting to 
terrible warnings&#44; or to bless one part of a people 
whilst the other is punished. For instance&#44; when the 
Israelites dwelt in Egypt&#44; the scourge of the pesti&#8211; 
lence&#44; by which an indiscriminate slaughter of all the 
inhabitants would&#44; in the course of nature&#44; have taken 
place&#44; could not have answered as a retribution to&#8211; 
wards the oppressors&#44; inasmuch as the oppressed 
would have shared the same fate. How then should 
the Lord act &#63; As He did&#44; by discriminating between 
the guilty and the innocent&#44; by protecting these&#44; while 
the others suiierod. The miracle did not consist in 
the fact&#44; that the plague was not a thing in the course 
of nature&#44; but that it spared the property of the 
Israelites&#44; whilst that of the Egyptians was surren&#8211; 
dered to the destroyer. Now it cannot be denied that 
these astounding events happen frequently&#44; that the 
power of the Lord is held out to protect those who 
deserve his mercy&#59; but we pass them by&#59; we disco&#8211; 
ver nothing wonderful or extraordinary in them&#59; and 
far from improving oar minds&#44; they leave us unin&#8211;

reasoning had to yield to the overpowering convic&#8211; 
tion&#44; that the demands of Moses were the veritable 
injunctions of the Supreme ru1er of the universe&#44; 
who&#44; by the deeds then and thus wrought&#44; was pleased 
to demonstrate liis almighty power&#44; exerted&#44; let it l&#41;e 
understood&#44; to preserve the truth of his promise&#44; to 
break the chains of the unjustly enslaved&#44; and to 
prove the universal truth&#44; which was true from the 
beginning&#44; and will be true to all eternity&#44; that there 
is but one God&#44; one Creator&#44; one Saviour&#44; who was&#44; 
who is&#44; and who ever will be &#59; before whom no crea&#8211; 
tive power existed&#44; and after whom there will be none&#59; 
and with whom there is neither an associate nor a 
delegate to share in the smallest degree the govern&#8211; 
ment of the universe. And these are the words of 
the Bible in reference to this subject&#58; &#34;And the 
Lord said unto Moses&#44; Pharaoh&#39;s heart is hardened&#44; 
he refuseth to let the people go. Go thee unto 
Pharaoh in the morning&#44; and thou shalt say unto 
him. The Lord God of the Hebrews hath sent me 
unto thee&#44; saying. Let my people go&#44; that they may 
serve me in the wilderness&#59; and behold&#44; hitherto 
thou hast not hearkened. Thus saith the Lord&#44; By 
this thou shalt know that I am the Lord&#44; behold&#44; I 
will smite with the rod which is in niy hand upon the 
waters which are in the river&#44; and they shall be 
turned to blood.&#34; &#40;Exod. vii. 14&#8211;17.&#41; Again &#58; &#34;And 
Moses said unto Pharaoh&#44; Assume glory over me&#44; for 
what time I shall entreat for thee&#44; and for thy ser&#8211; 
vants&#44; and for thy people&#44; to destroy the frogs from 
thee and from thy houses&#44; that tliey may remain only 
in the river&#63; And he said. For to&#8211;morrow&#59; and he 
said. Be it according to thy word &#59; in order that thou

mayest know that&#44; there is none like unto our God.&#34; 
&#40;Ibid. viii. 5&#44; 6.&#41; Farther &#58; &#34; And the magicians said 
unto Pharaoh&#44; This is the finger of God.&#34; &#40;Ibid. 15.&#41; 
Again we read &#58; &#34; And I will distinguish on that day 
the land of Goshen&#44; in which my people abideth&#44; that 
no wild beasts shall be there&#44; that thou mayest know 
that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth.&#34; &#40;Ibid. 
18.&#41; In another passage we read &#58; &#34;But for this rea&#8211; 
son have I suiiered thee to remain&#44; in order to show 
thee my power &#59; and in order that my name may be 
declared throughout ali the earth.&#34; &#40;Ibid. ix. 16.&#41; It 
was then also that Pharaoh for a moment felt hum&#8211; 
bled&#44; and he sent for Moses and Aaron&#44; and said unto 
them &#58; &#34; I have sinned this time &#59; the Lord is the 
righteous&#44; and I and my people are the wicked.&#34; 
&#40;Ibid. 27.&#41; It is also said &#58; &#34; And I will pass through 
the land of Egypt in this night&#44; and I will smite all 
the first Jborn in the land of Egypt&#44; both man and 
beast&#44; and against all the gods of Egypt will I execute 
judgment&#59; I am the Lord.&#34; &#40;Ibid. xii. 12.&#41; These 
few brief extracts&#44; which will be more amply con&#8211; 
firmed by reading them in connexion with their con&#8211; 
texts&#44; give us at one view a. clear understanding of 
the object of the miracles related to us as having been 
performed in Egypt&#44; and it was&#44; what we have always 
contended for&#44; the fulfilracnt of the Lord&#39;s intention 
to establish one people on earth as the depositary of 
his laws&#44; and to prove himself to be the sole Deity to 
whom worship is due from all creatures. We have 
before shown&#44; that in the ordinary course of events&#44; 
by the usual influence of human feelings&#44; the king of 
Egypt could not have been induced to dismiss a mul&#8211; 
titude of slaves&#44; who built his pyramids&#44; erected his

temples&#44; dug his canals&#44; laboured in his fields&#44; and 
whose intelligence well fitted them for those works 
where something more than mere brute force was 
requisite for their execution. Should his benevo&#8211; 
lence have been appealed to&#44; his cupidity would have 
checked the first dawning of kindness for the enslaved 
race. To an appeal for justice he would have answer&#8211; 
ed&#44; that they who had been bondmen for centuries&#44; 
had no claims to more than mere existence&#44; which 
they were fortunate enough to receive as a bounty 
from his royal favour. If reminded of the despera&#8211; 
tion of men reduced to extremities&#44; who&#44; when will&#8211; 
ing to be free&#44; might by one great efibrt break asun&#8211; 
der their chains&#44; and wreak their vengeance in rivers 
of blood upon their oppressors &#58; he would have scorn&#8211; 
ed the threat &#59; have appealed to his hundreds of thou&#8211; 
sands of warriors&#44; all ready to perish at his nod &#59; 
have pointed to tha many brave swords anxious to 
leap from their scabbards in defence of the sacred 
majesty of Egypt&#44; and have exultingly asserted that 
they who had been so long slaves&#44; and subjected to 
all manner of ill treatment&#44; could not desire the boon 
of liberty&#44; and would be unfit to use it becomingly&#44; 
even should it be conceded to them from his unde&#8211; 
served bounty. And farther&#44; had he been merely 
informed that it was a decree of a mighty Deity&#44; who 
wished to protect the slavish race whom he valued so 
low&#44; whom he regarded as outcasts from humanity&#58; 
it cannot be otherwise than as the Bible teaches us&#44; 
that he would not have regarded in the least such a 
demand&#44; backed by what he must naturally have 
thought an unwarranted pretension to a divine pre&#8211; 
rogative&#44; falsely assumed for the God in whose name

he was appealed to&#44; by the daring rebel who ventured 
to enter the royal i&#41;alace with such unheard of auda&#8211; 
city&#44; with such a monstrous request&#44; addressed to the 
highest monarchical power in the known world&#44; in 
favour of the meanest slavish people. Here then was 
a case where discriminating justice could not send a 
universal&#44; uniform punishment over the land&#44; which&#44; 
not merely that&#44; without the intervention of the very 
miraculous power of which we have been speaking&#44; 
it must have afflicted the Israelites equally with the 
Egyptians&#44; would have assuredly been regarded by 
Pharaoh&#44; his people&#44; and his slaves also&#44; as one of 
those terrible visitations which occasionally devastate 
the earth &#59; and it would thus have entirelv failed of 
being regarded as a warning&#44; and consequently it 
could not have effected the liberation of Israel. Let 
us view the many calamitous occurrences of modern 
times &#59; the terrible wars &#59; the visitation of new pesti&#8211; 
lential diseases &#59; the frightful conflagrations &#59; the de&#8211; 
structions by flood and storms &#59; the general&#42; commer&#8211; 
cial bankruptcy which has destroyed the fortunes of 
thousands of families all over the earth&#44; that thought 
themselves secure against the assaults of adversity&#44; &#8212; 
let us&#44; I say&#44; view them in their proper light &#58; are 
they not all manifestations of divine wrath&#63; and yet 
who heeds the warning that is addressed thereby to 
all alike&#63; does not every one think that they are but 
natural events&#44; and have no bearing whatever upon 
the moral world &#63; &#8212; Even should a preacher&#44; in imita&#8211; 
tion of the ancient prophets&#44; be bold enough to de&#8211; 
nounce the sins of the age&#44; and apply these disasters 
to the case of his hearers&#44; and tell them&#44; &#34; It is partly 
for your sins that the Lord has afflicted the land &#59;

repent&#44; that the divine wrath may be diverted from 
you &#59; return to the ways of righteousness&#44; lest you 
perish in your iniquity&#58;&#34; &#8212; who is there among us 
that would listen to the words of such a holy man&#63; 
would we not look upon him as a mad enthusiast&#44; 
who misapplies the ordinary events of life to a pur&#8211; 
pose for which they have no analogy&#63; And yet mod&#8211; 
ern times are in possession of a far greater knowl&#8211; 
edge of divine truths than were the Egyptians of 
olden days &#59; especially are the sons of Israel more 
enlightened in the true knowledge of God&#39;s provi&#8211; 
dence&#44; and of his judgments&#44; and of his mercies&#44; inas&#8211; 
much as they possess the key which opens for them 
the portals of true wisdom&#44; namely&#44; the holy law&#44; the 
pure emanation of the most high God&#44; And shall 
we believe that mere ordinary calamities could have 
softened Pharaoh&#39;s heart &#63; could have taught his peo&#8211; 
ple to revere the everlasting Shield of Abraham &#63; 
could have impressed upon the sons of Jacob that they 
must be holy to a God different from the deities their 
masters worshipped&#44; when no such knowledge could 
have come to them in the way of nature&#44; and when&#44; 
moreover&#44; they suffered from the same evils which 
befell their masters&#44; arguing from the point that 
miracles are either impossible&#44; or that the occasion 
did not call for their being performed &#63; 

I leave it to you&#44; brethren&#44; to answer for yourselves 
these questions&#44; which&#44; rejecting the possibility of 
miracles&#44; would give replies which bear absurdity 
upon their very face. For if no miracles had been 
performed&#44; no knowledge of a system different from 
Egyptian mythology could have suddenly dawned 
upon the Israelites &#59; and even could such a thing have

come into existence&#44; it could never have caused Plia&#8211; 
raoh to consent to the dismissal of sixty myriads of 
able&#8211;bodied slaves&#44; as we have said already. The 
miracles&#44; therefore&#44; recorded in the book of Exodus 
&#40;and these are the principal ones which the Bible con&#8211; 
tains&#44; and are&#44; perhaps&#44; solely the foundations of doc&#8211; 
trines of the Jewish church&#41; were necessary&#44; first to 
discriminate between those who deserved punishment 
and those who did not&#44; whilst merely ordinary calam&#8211; 
ities could not have answered the purpose which 
Providence had evidently in view with the children 
of Israel&#59; and&#44; secondly&#44; since the Lord designed to 
bless his people with a special gift&#44; more valuable 
than aught else besides&#44; that is to say&#44; the possession 
of a religion founded upon truth&#44; and immovably uni&#8211; 
form in its happy effects upon society in all times and 
ages&#44; to use such means&#44; to exhibit such attestations&#44; 
as would best conduce to render the effect permanent&#44; 
and to impress the new truths upon the minds of so 
manv human bein2&#58;s at one and the same time&#44; that 
no subsequent miracle should be needed to retain a 
due knowledge of the law&#44; thus publicly and solemnly 
announced&#44; in the minds of the children of man. &#8212; &#34;We 
have enlarged before on the necessity of the miracles&#59; 
consequently there is no occasion to dwell on the 
mere probability of them any longer today. We will 
therefore turn at once to the question &#58; &#34; Why was it 
that the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt was 
considered of that paramount inn&#41;ortance&#44; as to justify 
the exhibition of so many miracles in their behalf&#63;&#34; 
To this we will give the following answer. At a time 
when the world was nearly overrun by idolatry&#44; the 
true light of divine wisdom&#44; which emanated directly

ON MIRACALES. 357 

from the Lord as a gift to tlie first progenitors of the 
human family&#44; liacl not become totally extinct&#59; since 
it burned brightly in the heart of one at least who 
dreaded not to avow his conviction before the world&#44; 
fearless of dangers which might result to him from 
his public confession of unpopular opinions. This 
wise man delivered the truths he professed to his de&#8211; 
scendants&#44; of whom he lived to see the third genera&#8211; 
tion&#44; and then went down to the grave honoured as 
the luminary of the world by many nations&#44; and to 
this day his name is revered among idolatrous peo&#8211; 
ple&#44; who respect his example and his virtues&#44; without 
knowing from whom they are derived. His immedi&#8211; 
ate descendants and their families became by degrees 
mingled among tlie inhabitants of various lands &#59; but 
the truths which Abraham had taught were not long 
remembered except by a few who remained faithful &#59; 
and soon the rank falsehoods of superstition&#44; in which 
a heathen world was sunk&#44; overshadowed the beauties 
of the divine revelation which had been offered alike 
to all sons of Adam. The name of the Lord was not 
known among those who lived in the fairest portions 
of the earth &#59; and from the rising of the sun to his 
setting ascended the smoke of sacrifice&#44; which was 
incense of abomination to the God of Israel. In this 
deplorable state of mankind&#44; of which all history bears 
the amplest evidence&#44; the light of truth had need to 
be rekindled &#59; and rekindled it was&#44; as we are certified 
in the holy Scriptures. We acknowledge that the 
Lord has many ways to accomplish his purposes &#59; it 
is not for us to say&#44; how He is to effect his will &#59; but 
without discussing whether He employed the best 
means or called in the most fitting agents&#44; it is suf&#8211; 

<pb n="358"/>

358 ON MIRACLES. 

ficient for us to know that&#44; from the many means and 
the innumerable agents at his command&#44; He chose to 
establish a people as the means of effecting the refor&#8211; 
mation of the earth&#44; and these agents He selected 
from the descendants of Abraham&#44; the friend of the 
Lord in times of the darkest idolatry. Whatever may 
be urged against the unworthiness of the Israelites in. 
olden days&#44; and against the mairij fearful backslidings 
of the Jews&#44; their successors&#44; at the present time&#44; is 
nothing to the matter&#59; for any other people might in 
all probability have become equally rebellious&#44; if not 
more so than our own nation has shown itself. Only 
this point of view must be kept before us&#44; that the 
miraculous redemption of the children of Israel had 
for its object the establishment of truths&#44; which re&#8211; 
quired an astounding exhibition of the divine power 
to render them for ever after impossible to be for&#8211; 
gotten. 

Having brought our inquiry to this sole point of 
any importance to the general inquirer after truth&#44; 
we have at once an answer to the question &#58; &#34; Wliat 
is the object of miracles&#63;&#34; It is&#44; namely&#44; the estab&#8211; 
lishment&#44; or confirmation rather&#44; of a fact or series 
of theoretical and practical facts&#44;&#42; commonly called 
truths&#44; in the minds of those persons before whom 
these wonderful events take place. But please to ob&#8211; 
serve&#44; brethren&#44; any fact attested by a miracle is not 
true because of the performance of the miracle&#44; but it 
is true because of the intrinsic nature of itself which 
constitutes it an undoubted fact or a truth. The mir&#8211; 

&#42; For instance&#44; the theory of the truth of Moses&#44; the fact of the 
existence of God&#44; and the historical truth of rcvchition. 

<pb n="359"/>

ON MIRACLES. 359 

acle makes it only evident to the comprehension of 
the spectators&#44; with the superadded conviction that 
the person who is enabled to perform it must needs 
epeak the truth&#44; always supposing that there is no 
deception or collusion in the performance which he 
otters as an attestation of the truth of that which he 
avers. Now what is the nature of a truth &#63; This 
also we have illustrated on a former occasion&#44; and we 
stated it to be&#44; a fact which cannot be otlierwise&#44; or 
an idea of which the reverse cannot be true. If now 
a miracle has been wrought to attest a certain fact 
and to exhibit it as of divine origin&#44; and as approved 
of by the wonder&#8211;working power of the Creator&#44; ef&#8211; 
fected through the agency of one of his holy ministers 
whom He sends from time to time to instruct and im&#8211; 
prove mankind &#58; the truth of the fact has been per&#8211; 
manently established&#44; not alone for the time being 
when the miracle takes place&#44; but also for all future 
times. Understand well&#44; brethren&#44; for it is a material 
point in the doctrines of our blessed religion&#44; which 
contradistinguishes it from all other creeds. AVe just 
now said&#44; that a truth is not a truth because of the 
miracle which attests it&#44; but simply from its own in&#8211; 
trinsic nature. But this self&#8211;evident proposition can 
be carried yet farther &#58; it is this&#44; that any truth must 
be always a truth&#44; or what is the same&#44; no circum&#8211; 
stances can have any bearing upon its being so under 
any imaginable view of the question&#44; no matter how 
slight&#44; or how important any change in the condition 
of things may seem to all mankind combined. 

Let us apply this test to the doctrines which the 
miracles in Egypt and the wilderness were to con&#8211; 
firm or establish. We used above the words&#44; &#34;new 

<pb n="360"/>

360 ON MIRACLES. 

trutlis&#44;&#34; not however as tliough these truths then oniy 
became such&#44; but as being cither then first promul&#8211; 
gated&#44; or at least generally difl&#39;used among the chil&#8211; 
dren of man at that time inhabiting the earth. We 
liave already recited&#44; at the commencement of to&#8211; 
day&#39;s lecture&#44; several texts which clearly indicate that 
it was deemed necessary to establish the unlimited&#44; 
almighty power of the Lord&#44; and to prove the noth&#8211; 
ingness of all the various deities&#44; falsely so called&#44; 
which were worshipped in Egypt. What did the 
miracles do in this point of view &#63; They taught 
Pharaoh and his people something which they did 
not believe&#44; which nevertheless was true&#59; they be&#8211; 
lieved&#44; or professed to believe &#40;it is all the same to us 
in our present inquiry&#41; in an innumerable quantity 
of tutelary powers&#44; which they represented under 
various visible shapes&#44; and which images were placed 
in every part of their extensive country. When noti&#8211; 
fied&#44; let us assume&#44; for the iirst time&#44; that a Deity&#44; 
announcing himself under a name which they had 
never known&#44; demanded of them a sacrifice which it 
was galling to their pride to make&#44; and which ma&#8211; 
terially confiicted with their interests&#58; they refused 
compliance&#44; and they did not yield till sore experi&#8211; 
ence had proved to them that&#44; though the 7iame of 
the God in whose name Moses spoke was new to 
them&#44; He was nevertheless supreme over all&#44; able to 
accomplish his omnipotent will in all lie desired. In 
this way the Egyptians confessed themselves converts 
to the belief in the omnipotence of the Creator. But 
had the Lord not been omnipotent&#44; the miracles could 
not have constituted Ilim endowed with this attri&#8211; 
bute. Yet He is omnipotent&#44; He was so from the 

<pb n="361"/>

ON MIRACLES. 361 

beo&#59;iuinng&#44; and He must necessarily continue so for 
ever and ever. Suppose now a miracle were to be 
performed&#44; or a story &#34;&#34;should come down to us related 
as an historical fact&#44; that at some period a miracle 
had been performed&#44; real or fictitious&#44; by a person 
who thereby meant to prove that the Lord had parted 
with his attribute of universal power &#58; would we be 
able to believe such an attestation &#63; For our parts&#44; 
as Israelites&#44; we would maintain&#44; be the prodigy ever 
so great&#44; the truth of its being performed ever so un&#8211; 
doubted&#44; that we must steadfastly reject the evidence 
thus offered&#44; and support in our thoughts and our 
words our unshaken belief in the unvarying power 
of the Lord. For that God is omnipotent&#44; that He 
is a perfect unity&#44; that He is alone&#44; without any asso&#8211; 
ciate&#44; is true from the very nature of his being&#59; and 
if we were by any possibility in doubt of this&#44; the 
revelation of the Bible would have removed this 
doubt. Well&#44; then&#44; what does a miracle prove as 
sucli&#63; merely that it has been performed&#44; that an 
astonishing event has taken place. But has this at&#8211; 
testation destroyed in the least the order of nature &#63; 
has it in the least deprived the blessed Infinity of any 
power&#63; By no means&#59; miracles&#44; even those wrought 
actually by God&#44; are extra&#8211;natural&#44; and yet destroy not 
nature&#59; and as all power to work such extra&#8211;natural 
things comes from Him&#44; the Author of all nature 
alone&#44; it cannot diminish his ability to work his will&#44; 
otherwise called his omnipotence&#44; nor can it invest&#44; 
independently of the actual delegation from the Lord 
himself&#44; any being whatever with independent ability 
to do any thing in contravention of the gloiy and 
greatness of the Most High. &#8212; Nay&#44; more &#59; the reve&#8211;

lation of God is the declaration of Ins will and wis&#8211; 
dom. Its announcement was&#44; as we have seen&#44; at&#8211; 
tested by a public manifestation of prodigies and 
unheard of wonders. For what was this gift so sol&#8211; 
emnly attested&#63; Simply to mark it with that seal 
of divine approbation&#44; the like of which has never yet 
been given to any other event&#44; save the creation alone. 
&#34;We maintain&#44; therefore&#44; that it cannot be abrogated 
by any means whatever &#40;of which probably more here&#8211; 
after&#41;&#44; at all events that for its repeal it would require 
a similar&#44; if not superior pul&#41;lic manifestation&#44; than 
accompanied its iirst promulgating. We therefore 
insist upon this point&#44; as the main support for our 
continuance to uphold the ancient law of Moses &#40;in 
the midst of all the difficulties which have attended 
its observance&#41;&#44; that no means whatever have yet 
been employed by the Giver of this law to alter&#44; re&#8211; 
voke&#44; or annul any part&#44; the minutest even&#44; of the 
whole system which he confided to our safe&#8211;keeping. 
Moreover&#44; that no miracle&#44; be it ever so well attested&#44; 
nay even&#44; were it at this very instant cfl&#39;ccted in the 
midst of us&#44; and that we were convinced by the sight 
of our eyes and the hearing of our ears that there is 
no deception in the case&#44; can absolve us from the 
obedience which we as the descendants or successors 
&#40;for the proselytes too are equally Avith the sons of 
Israel children of the law and covenant&#41; owe to the 
legislation of Sinai&#59; and that consequently all such 
miracles&#44; admitting&#44; as we said&#44; that they are real&#44; are 
not the attestations which the Lord will receive as an 
excuse ibr our forsaking the religion which he him &#8211; 
self&#44; and himself alone&#44; announced to ns as that sysr&#59; 
tern to which we should remain everlastingly true and

faitbful. It cannot be possible that tbe Lord should 
mean&#44; all along supposing that a miracle is indeed 
shown&#44; to contradict by a single fact&#44; or a series of 
lacts&#44; taking place necessarily before a comparatively 
small number of spectators&#44; that which lie deemed 
of sufficient importance to bring a whole people to&#8211; 
gether in the wilderness to receive it&#44; and to proclaim 
it then and there in the hearing of every man&#44; woman&#44; 
and child assembled at the foot of Mount Sinai. 

Let us look a little deeper into the case before we 
close this subject for the present&#59; and excuse me&#44; 
brethren&#44; if you should find a repetition of what has 
been said already. That the Lord created the world 
alone&#44; without aid&#44; without associate&#44; without a divi&#8211; 
sion in his own essence&#44; was&#44; it is true&#44; the doctrine 
taught to the Israelites&#59; but we have said&#44; and said 
truly&#44; that it was an announcement merely of the 
everlasting truth of God&#39;s existence and unity. Un&#8211; 
derstand&#44; unity means a oneness&#44; without separation 
of parts&#44; without division into separate individuals. 
A doctrine&#44; believed in by many intelligent&#44; wise&#44; and 
good men&#44; asserts&#44; that at a time subsequent to the

judge of mankind. We cannot&#44; to&#8211;day&#44; enter into 
an extensive examination of the subject&#59; we will&#44; 
therefore&#44; merely ask &#58; Can the performance of all&#44; 
these miracles make true what common sense and 
the Bible declare as not true &#63; How can the fact that 
any person raises a dead man unto life establish as a 
fact the falsity that he is a part of the Deity&#44; or that 
&#34;he is appointed to the formerly unknown dignity of 
interceder between God and man &#63; &#8212; Could the unity 
of God be abrogated by a mere miracle &#63; Could his 
omnipotence to save sinners&#44; to hear prayer&#44; to assist 
the distressed&#44; be in the least abridged by the de&#8211; 
struction of all nature &#63; by the calling into existence 
of a new world&#63; &#8212; Not for such a purpose were the 
miracles of the Bible wrought&#59; they took place to 
glorify the Creator before his works&#44; not to elevate 
creatures to an even rank with Ilim&#59; and&#44; conse&#8211; 
quently&#44; as believers in the Bible&#44; we cannot admit 
that any number of miracles can attest to that&#44; which 
is not true from the very nature of the terms. 

Farther&#58; the word of God as revealed in the Law 
is cither divine or not. We&#44; as believers&#44; assume the 
affirmative&#44; and all other believers in prophecy admit 
the same. Wliat does this require &#63; Simply that the 
Bible is the everlasting truth&#44; and this not because 
miracles attended its bestowal&#44; but simply because it 
contains the necessary truths which God thought 
proper to teach the world. These truths would have 
been such without any miracle&#59; and&#44; consequently&#44; 
no miracle can make them otherwise. So it says&#44; 
&#34;Thou shalt have no other god before my face.&#34; 
Does this prohibition appeal for its truth to the earth&#8211; 
quake which shook the mountain of Iloreb when the

Lord proclaimed it&#63;&#8212; Again&#44; &#34;Thou slialt not bear 
tlie name of the Lord thy God in vain.&#34; Was the 
same miracle requisite to constitute it an everlasting 
point of the moral law&#63; &#8212; Also&#44; &#34;Remember the Sab&#8211; 
bath day to keep it holy &#59; six days shalt thou labour 
and do all thy work &#59; but the seventh is the day of 
rest unto the Lord thy God.&#34; Did the miraculous 
proclamation of this precept alone render it binding&#44; 
or was it founded upon a more firm basis than the 
evanescent exhibition of the most astounding occur&#8211; 
rence &#63; &#8212; We could multiply questions of this kind at 
pleasure&#44; but it needs not &#58; enough&#44; the precepts as 
well as doctrines depend only on themselves&#44; the lat&#8211; 
ter as necessary deductions from the existence of a 
spiritual God&#44; the former as the institutions derived 
from this God who&#44; being supremely wise&#44; cannot be 
so capricious as to order acts to be done&#44; which He 
in a short time would cease to regard with pleasure&#44; 
or would institute others either altogether new&#44; or at 
least not in consonance with his first legislation. &#8212; 
Here&#44; however&#44; we are met again by persons of a 
different persuasion&#44; no doubt as honest as we are 
ourselves&#44; and as sincere in their belief as we can 
claim to be&#59; they say&#44; that miracles have been 
wrought to prove that the old covenant has been 
abolished&#44; and new laws have been substituted in its 
stead. Could miracles&#44; any thing less than a public 
legislation&#44; eft&#39;ect such a result&#44; we might pause for 
proofs that such miracles were at one time or the 
other actually performed. But we need not be so 
cautious&#59; nowhere in the Bible is it asserted as a 
doctrine that any event can do away with what the 
law institutes as an everlasting ordinance&#59; conse&#8211; 

31&#42; 

<pb n="366"/>

qnently the performance of many miracles&#44; even to 
the raising the dead and dividing the waters of the 
great ocean&#44; eould not do away Avith the observance 
of the Sabbath&#44; the prohibition of image&#8211;worship&#44; or 
the joining of an adjunct in the service which we 
offer to the Lord. No&#44; as He is one&#44; everlastingly&#44; 
unchangeably&#44; and uniformly&#44; in all times and under 
all circumstances&#44; so must his law be unchangeable&#44; 
everlasting&#44; uniform&#59; and any miracle whatever&#44; even 
should one actually be permitted by his omniscience 
for a wise purpose&#44; will not authorize us to forsake 
the path which He has taught us to tread. 

This doctrine is clearly pointed out in the book of 
Deuteronomy&#44; at the beginning of the thirteenth chap&#8211; 
ter&#58; &#34;If there arise in the midst of thee a prophet or 
a dreamer of dreams&#44; and he giveth thee a sign or a 
token&#44; and the sign or token come to pass whereof 
he spoke unto thee&#44; saying&#44; Let us go after other gods 
which thou dost not know&#44; and let us serve them &#58; 
thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet&#44; 
or unto that dreamer of dreams&#59; for the Lord your 
God proveth you&#44; to know whether ye love the Lord 
your God with all your heart and with all your soul.&#34; 
And then continues the text &#40;verse 5&#41;&#58; 

&#58; &#39;n &#39;r &#39;&#8211;I3T 

&#34; After the Lord j&#8211;our God shall ye walk&#44; and Him shall yo fear&#44; 
and his commandments shall yc keep&#44; and to his voice shall ye 
hearken&#44; and Him shall ye serve&#44; and unto Him sliall yo cleave.&#34; 

Here&#44; as usual in the Bible&#44; the doctrinal point is 

<pb n="367"/>

ON MIRACLES. 367 

too self&#8211;evident to need any extended explanation &#59; 
and the words bear out clearly the articles of faith 
which I thought it my duty to teach you in the last 
lectures&#44; including the one I have been permitted to 
lay before you this day&#44; that&#44; first&#44; miracles are the in&#8211; 
struments of the Lord to work conviction upon the 
minds of people of truths already existing&#44; or to 
effect certain purposes which He deems of sufficient 
importance that He should subvert for a time or per&#8211; 
manently the laws of nature&#59; but that&#44; secondly&#44; no 
miraculous attestation can in the least alter any re&#8211; 
ligious or moral truth&#44; or do away with any precept 
of the Bible whatever &#59; and that&#44; lastly&#44; should a&#59; mir&#8211; 
acle be permitted which would claim to be an attes&#8211; 
tation of an opposite doctrine&#44; its evidence must be 
rejected as contrary to the plain instruction of the 
Lord&#44; conveyed to us in his blessed book. One more 
observation&#44; and I have done. Although a spurious 
miracle is spoken of in our text&#44; there is no particle 
of evidence that any such was ever wrought&#44; although 
should it be so&#44; it would not and ought not to weigh 
in the least as evidence against any part of the Bible 
just as we have received it. &#8212; Therefore&#44; sons of Is&#8211; 
rael &#33; therefore&#44; daughters of Zion &#33; be ever alive to 
your duty&#44; to the glorious privilege of being the 
chosen messengers of God&#39;s mercy&#59; and let no allure&#8211; 
ment&#44; no show of great deeds&#44; call you away from 
the path which was pointed out to you&#44; and which 
surely leads onward to salvation&#44; yea&#44; as surely as 
there is one&#44; sole God and Saviour who has created 
the universe&#44; and who has given us the soul which 
lives within us &#33;

O God of Israel&#44; the everlasting Father &#33; we again 
approach Thee&#44; in this house devoted to the service 
of thy name&#44; accompanied by the younger branches 
of our community&#44; who have been permitted by thy 
providence to receive some instruction in the law and 
the ordinances which Thou didst prescribe in ages 
long gone by unto thy own chosen people. And truly 
are we conscious of the blissful privilege which is ours 
through this law &#33; Other nations&#44; they who first fell

80 soon after thy wrath had swept off the immense 
7nultitudes of a simiiiig race&#44; have had to pass through 
centuries of mental darkness&#44; in order to arrive at the 
glorious truths which thy word contains. And as yet 
the entire light has not been accorded to them&#59; for 
they see the brilliancy which overspreads thy religion&#44; 
and they are dazzled with its brightness&#44; and they 
stumble in the excess of its effulgence&#44; seeking in the 
recesses of mystery for that truth wdiich is so plainly 
spread over the whole surface of thy law &#59; they hear 
the voice in which Thou speakest to thy creatures&#44; 
but they understand it not as proceeding from Thee&#44; 
the only one and true God&#44; but fancy that Thou art too 
mighty to be approached alone&#44; without a mediator&#44; 
by the sons of man. AVhereas we have known Thee 
and thy ways from the moment that thy glory dwelt 
visibly before our astonished eyes on the blessed 
mountain in the desert of a far&#8211;off&#39; land&#59; we call on 
thy name which is exalted above all&#44; we come near 
Thee as a child approaches its father&#44; feeling our un&#8211; 
worthiness&#44; yct not unmindful that it is thy way to 
compassionate&#44; to forgive&#44; to receive sinners who open 
unto thy all&#8211;searching view the chambers of their 
hearts&#44; detesting their misdeeds&#44; resolved to live a 
holier life&#44; and to sin no more. 

Yet do we know&#44; that our conduct has not corre&#8211; 
sponded with the knowledge which is ours. The na&#8211; 
tions of the earth walk&#44; many of them&#44; in the course 
of piety according to the light which is theirs &#59; they 
strive earnestly&#39; by faith and deeds to sanctify their 
life according to the doctrines which have been taught 
unto them &#59; but we&#8211;we confess it with shame&#44; we 
and our fathers have not so heeded thy instruction &#59;

we would not listen to thy voice&#44; and preferring the 
ways of error in which the gentiles walked&#44; we wan&#8211; 
dered away from the path of righteousness&#44; like the 
sheep that are scattered in the desert without a shep&#8211; 
herd to lead them back to their healthful pasture. 
And even now we are yet obdurate &#59; we heed not thy 
admonition&#44; and follow the foolish imaginings of our 
own sinful hearts &#59; we wish not thy instruction&#44; and 
are seeking new roads which thy law does not sanc&#8211; 
tion. It is therefore in accordance with thy right&#8211; 
eousness that punishment has befallen us&#44; that we 
were scattered among the nations&#44; and that in every 
generation sorrow and affliction have pursued the 
children of Abraham&#44; Isaac&#44; and Jacob. We thus dis&#8211; 
cover in our dispersion thy almighty hand and thy 
mercy&#44; which are exerted to lead us back to the path 
which we have forsaken&#44; and to keep alive by means 
of tribulation the love and knowledge of thy law 
within our innermost heart. 

Be it then thy will&#44; our God&#33; to be with us in 
our endeavours to teach&#39; thy word. Let persuasive 
wisdom be imparted to our speech&#44; that our words 
may sink deeply into the hearts of those who come 
to learn from us&#44; the ordinances and commandments 
of thy law &#59; guard us against error &#59; and cause that 
nothing injurious&#44; nothing doubtful&#44; nothing that is 
not strictly according to the everlasting truth which 
Thou hast prescribed&#44; may fall from our lips through 
ignorance or inadvertence &#59; so that whatever is taught 
by us may tend to spread a true knowledge of thy 
religion among the youthful scions of the house of 
Israel&#44; and confirm them in the holy faith which they 
have received from their fathers&#44; and arm them with

an unswerving firmness to resist&#44; all the days of their 
lives&#44; every temptation&#44; every lure&#44; every persuasion&#44; 
every terror&#44; which might&#44; altogether or each sepa&#8211; 
rately&#44; be brought against them to draw them aside 
from the law of Moses&#44; either to fall into the snares 
of sin and transgression&#44; or to break off altogether 
their connexion with the household of Jacob&#44; which 
is theirs by their birtliright as the descendants of those 
whom Thou didst call thy own first&#8211;born son Israel. 

But not for our sakes do we ask this grace &#59; for we 
are sinful&#44; and weak in knowledge&#44; and slothful in 
righteousness. Yet for thy own sake show thy glory&#44; 
for the sake of thy kindness and thy truth give us 
this blessing we ask&#59; and remove thereby the dis&#8211; 
grace which the nations would otherwish attach to 
us&#44; the small remnant that has escaped the many per&#8211; 
secutions which we had to endure because that our 
fl.esh was sealed with thy covenant&#44; and because that 
we were called by thy name. For why should they&#44; 
who worship not Thee aloiie&#44; be sufifered to believe 
that we are cast out from thy favour &#63; that our blessed 
law is no longer thy will &#63; Whereas this law has been 
instituted by thy will and wisdom&#44; and Thou hast 
ever preserved it&#44; as the heritage of the congregation 
of Jacob. We therefore beseech Thee to remove 
graciously the stumbling&#8211;block&#44; which the cares of 
life throw in the paths of many sons of Israel&#59; cause 
them to feel sincerely the holiness and truth of thy 
word&#59; make them conscious that worldliness and sin 
are not the ways of everlasting life &#59; so that they may 
devote their hearts in humble faith and yielding trust 
to thy service &#59; in order that grace may abound in our

be glorified tlirough our words aud actions&#59; and tluit 
the nations may thus be brought to acknowledge that 
our waiting for thy salvation is the height of wisdom&#44; 
and our observance of thy laws&#44; the summit of perfec&#8211; 
tion&#44; by which only we can be led into the gates of 
everlasting bliss&#44; and our souls be rendered pure and 
cleansed from sin. Yea&#44; purify us&#44; O our Father&#33; in

of Israel&#44; who cleansest us with thy waters of purifi&#8211; 
cation&#44; even thy holy spirit&#44; that we may be washed 
clean from all our iniquities&#44; and from all our abomi&#8211; 
nations&#44; and from all our impurities&#44; as Thou hast 
spoken through the mouth of thy prophet. &#8212; But above 
all&#44; let us pray Thee to preserve us one entire people&#44; 
to remove from us all causeless contention&#44; to banish 
from us all discord&#44; aud to frustrate all the evil de&#8211; 
signs&#44; whether from Israelites or strangers&#44; which 
might have for their object to destroy the unity which 
once distinguished thy people. Keep us thus entire&#44; 
our ranks unbroken&#44; and our numbers undiminished 
in our captivity&#44; till the time that Thou wilt send the 
son of David to proclaim salvation to the ends of the 
earth&#44; to bid the captives go free&#44; and to give light to 
those who walk in darkness. May this be thy will&#44; 
for the sake of thy covenant and goodness. Amen. 

Brethren and Friends &#33; 

In our daily prayers wliich were handed down to 
us from our forefathers occurs the ibllowing passage&#58; 

<pb n="373"/>

THE LAW OF ISRAEL. 373 

&#39; Blessed be our God &#33; who hath created us for his glory&#44; and 
separated us from those who go astray&#44; and given us the law of 
truth&#44; and planted eternal life within us.&#34; 

Ill these words we return onr tluitiks to the Lord 
for his mercy in having heen pleased to call us to his 
service&#44; and to separate us from the mass of mankind 
who are in error with regard to religious duties and 
doctrines&#44; by bestowing on us the law which contains 
the true principles which He himself declared to be 
in consonance with his wisdom&#44; and best promotive 
of the happiness of man. The unbeliever and the 
gentile will doubtlessly smile when they hear&#8211; us re&#8211; 
cite these words. They say&#44; that we have no superi&#8211; 
ority over any other people &#59; on the contrary&#44; that we 
are inferior to them in the progress we have made in 
arts and sciences&#44; and that&#44; as far as moral superiority 
is concerned&#44; we are far behind many of the diiferent 
sects which are scattered over the world. Thouorh 
both these positions&#44; by which an inferiority on our 
part is assumed&#44; admit of ample contradiction&#44; or at 
least of explanation&#44; we may for the present admit 
them as true &#58; and still we will maintain that we have 
cause for thankfulness in the possession of the true 
law. Were it that worldly greatness&#44; that progress in 
arts and sciences could alone stamp a nation as pow&#8211; 
erful and great&#44; then indeed might we feel ashamed 
of our littleness&#59; but there are other elements of 
greatness&#44; and these are the heritage of the sons of 
Jacob.

sons of Israel are&#58; still&#44; whence did their religion&#39; 
come &#63; was a new revelation vouchsafed unto them &#63; 
did another prophet&#44; like unto Moses&#44; indeed come 
into their beniglited lands&#44; and proclaim a special an&#8211; 
nouncement of a new code of laws in the name of 
the Most High &#63; Our opponents themselves do not 
claim it&#59; they refer to Moses and the prophets as 
their instructors&#44; &#8212; understand to our Moses and our 
prophets&#44; to our law and our predictions. How then 
could the Romans or their heathen contemporaries 
have had true cause to exult over the captive Hebrew&#63; 
were they not arrogant when they gloried in their 
victories which did not save their empires from de&#8211; 
struction&#44; and their opinions from oblivion &#63; and was 
not the captive justified for thanking God for the 
blessing of the law&#44; which&#44; whilst the name of Jew 
is despised&#44; whilst the people of Jacob are outcasts in 
every land&#44; outcasts because not governed politically 
by their own equitable code&#44; holds its dominion over 
the minds of men more firmly and more widely dif&#8211; 
fused&#44; than when Israel dwelt securely in their own 
land &#63; 

We will therefore not claim to be more instructed 
in worldly sciences than our gentile friends&#44; which we 
are not&#59; we will not say&#44; that as a people we are more 
moral&#44; more honest than they are&#44; which&#44; though 
surely true in some respects&#44; is not so in others &#59; but 
this we will say&#44; that we are more acquainted Avith 
the basis of all truths than they are&#44; we are blessed

with a treasure from which&#44; despite of the pride of 
human opinion&#44; thcj have been compelled to borrow 
most of their moral principles&#44; and that whatever 
they have of their own&#44; independently of this source&#44; 
is either not practicable or of a very questionable 
usefulness. 

Let us look a little into the matter. &#34;Where do we 
find the origin of the universal precepts of worship 
and philanthropy&#44; &#34;Love God above all&#44; and thy 
neighbour as thyself&#44;&#34; but in the blessed books of 
Moses &#63; Did he not teach from the very first com&#8211; 
mencement of his commonwealth&#44; that the love we 
are to bear to our neighbour&#44; which should respect 
his rights and the feelings even which the peculiarity 
of his position might occasion&#44; should be the first 
principle upon which the superstructure of our whole 
state polity was to be founded &#63; Perhaps the doubter 
may be induced to appeal to the penal statutes which 
appear rigorous to the superficial observer. But are 
rigorous laws necessarily cruel in their effect upon 
society &#63; This would be so indeed&#44; if it had been left 
to the judge to execute bodily punishment at his ar&#8211; 
bitrary will upon a person brought before him with 
or without cause. Yet we shall not find the practi&#8211; 
cal effect of the law at all of this nature. The law 
itself defined the offence as well as the punishment&#44; 
and publicity&#44; credible witnesses and a searching in&#8211; 
vestigation were all required before any punishment 
could follow upon any crime whatever&#44; great or small&#44; 
according to the letter of the law&#59; consequently the 
rigorous enactments could only reach him who boldly 
and voluntarily exposed himself to their action&#59; and 
as the statutes were publicly known&#44; and could not 

<pb n="379"/>

THE LAW OF ISRAEL. 379 

be increased by any subsequent legislation&#44; every 
member of the state had ample opportunity to make 
himself acquainted with their nature and tendency. 
In short&#44; it was a regard for the rights of all wdiich 
iiiduced the denunciation of punishment against him 
who either had grievously wronged his fellow&#8211;being 
in person&#44; moral standing&#44; or possessions&#44; or had by 
a scandalous example defied the law&#39;s upon which 
rested the best interests of the commonwealth. Or&#44; 
in other Avords&#44; the love for the neighbour should be 
like the love for ourselves &#59; he was to be restrained 
from injuring us even if he had the inclination&#59; we 
had a right to expect from him assistance in our need&#44; 
kindness if we required it&#44; consolation if we were in 
trouble&#58; whilst we on our part had the same obliga&#8211; 
tion towards liim&#44; to abstain from injuring him in the 
least&#44; and to render him all the services in our power 
Avhich his situation might call for. This&#44; in brief&#44; 
was the social love demanded by Moses&#44; and is in 
truth the only sure foundation of a happy republic. 
If any subsequent code teaches the same&#44; it is tanta&#8211; 
mount to the Mosaic code&#59; and if it teaches any 
thing diiferent&#44; it is impracticable&#44; and cannot in 
truth become the constitution of a free and enlight&#8211; 
ened people. 

The love of God above all things is also the very 
life of our religion. What does the Scripture say&#58; 
&#34; And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy 
heart&#44; and w&#8211;ith all thy soul&#44; and with all thy might.&#34; 
Can we love Ilim more ardently than this precept 
demands&#63; Is there any otlicr mode by which we 
can demonstrate our love than by yielding all our 
energies&#44; all our possessions&#44; nay&#44; our very life in the

service of our heavenly Father&#63; He who knows all 
our thoughts has asked no more &#8212; He accepts the 
services of man according to the strength He has en&#8211; 
dowed him with. What more then could we add 
tlicM&#8211;cto &#63; &#8212; Is it&#44; perhaps&#44; that we should cease to be 
human&#63; that we should withdraw ourselves from the 
walks of life in the seclusion of a cloister&#63; in the 
caverns of the desert&#63; live with wild beasts&#44; or with 
men more savage than the brutes of the forest &#63; that 
we should shun the intercourse with beings like our&#8211; 
selves&#44; devote our days to fasting&#44; our nights to use&#8211; 
less meditations &#63; If this had been requisite&#44; it would 
have been so taught us&#59; the absence of such ordi&#8211; 
nances clearly proves that the law contemplated the 
love of God to be exhibited in the midst of social en&#8211; 
joyment&#44; in the walks of every&#8211;day life &#59; we should 
hold all we possess as subject to his will&#44; even whilst 
the mirthful laugh is heard in our dwellings&#44; whilst 
little children play on our knees&#44; whilst youths and 
maidens stand around their parents to ask for instruc&#8211; 
tion or to share their domestic happiness. &#8212; What 
think you&#44; that such a love of God is something im&#8211; 
practicable &#63; something too refined for a mortal to 
attain &#63; O no &#33; look at the many righteous fathers 
and mothers of our race from our very origin&#44; from 
the birth of Abraham to the destruction of our temple 
and even since &#58; and you will see that their social 
happiness did not prevent them from following the 
path of the Lord though it led them to death&#44; to trib&#8211; 
ulation&#44; or to captivity. Yet&#44; they who love the Lord&#44; 
love also all the beings whom He has created&#44; they 
feel that they have duties to perform on earth towards 
those who like themselves bear the image of God&#59; 

<pb n="381"/>

THE LAW OF ISRAEL. 381 

but they feel more deeply yet that to Ilim wlio lives 
to eternity their whole duty is due&#44; and they are 
therefore prepared to follow the call of Heaven&#44; like 
Abraham&#44; to sacriiice&#44; if need be&#44; their only child on 
whom all their earthly hopes are centred &#59; to go out&#44; 
like Elijah did&#44; into the wilderness&#44; without provision 
for the journey in their bags&#44; without a drop of water 
in their cruses&#59; or to die&#44; as did the many martyrs&#44; 
in the defence of their faith&#44; preferring to yield their 
spirits in innocence and truth&#44; sooner than accept 
the bribes and offices of the enlightened barbarians&#44; 
who&#44; professing to possess a religion of peace and 
good&#8211;will to mankind&#44; doom to the stake and the 
scaftbld those who cannot honestly agree with them 
in religious opinions. Such a love of God our law 
teaches&#44; such a love our history proves to have fre&#8211; 
quently animated its followers. Can any system show 
a more consistent one &#63; is there in fact any other de&#8211; 
manded by the creeds of enlightened men &#63; Now 
say&#44; where was this beautiful virtue first taught &#8212; in 
the law of Moses or elsewhere &#63; 

But one more instance will we cite. Human ex&#8211; 
perience has proved the usefulness&#44; nay&#44; the necessity 
of a day of rest &#59; I do not believe that any people of 
antiquity had any such institution as a regular weekly 
recurrence&#44; although among some nations several 
day&#39;s of lawless festivity were allowed once a year to 
their bondmen &#59; nor has modern paganism anything 
resembling such a w&#39;eckly respite I&#39;rora toil. Still 
modern civilized nations all recognize it in one shape 
or another&#44; Now say&#44; wdience was it derived &#63; We 
acknovrledge that priestcraft has succeeded to induce 
a large proportion of the world to rest on the first 

<pb n="382"/>

382 THE LAW OF ISRAEL. 

day of the week&#44; a day which the Lord has not 
ordained&#44; which lie has not sanctified&#44; nor blessed 
above all other days. Nevertheless where did the 
idea spring from to require that the workshops be 
closed&#44; the labourers be permitted to abstain from 
constant toil&#44; and even the beasts of burden to rest&#63; 
Is it not from the law of Moses &#63; &#34;Was it not there 
written&#44; before anywhere else&#44; that the Lord had been 
pleased to give rest unto his people Israel on the 
seventh day of tlie week&#44; on the holy Sabbath&#44; the 
day which lie had blessed and sanctified&#44; which He 
had instituted as a sign between Ilini and Israel for&#8211; 
ever&#44; to show that they believe that He had created 
the heavens and the earth&#44; and all that is in them in 
a period of six days &#63; &#8212; And where&#44; again we ask&#44; is 
the revelation which teaches a different lesson &#63; Be&#8211; 
lieve me one thing&#44; and we challenge those who dif&#8211; 
fer from us to the proof&#44; that there is not a tittle of 
evidence even in their authorities to prove in so many 
words that any Sabbath was ever instituted except 
the INIosaic or Jewish day of rest&#59; and that there is 
consequently no reason toglorify any system&#44; because 
of this blissful ordinance&#44; above the law which Israel&#8211; 
ites consider their rule of life.
But what shall we say concerning the doctrinal 
part of our faith &#63; If the moral and religious parts 
are so perfect as our brief exhibit has proved them&#44; 
the ideal of our belief is not less so. What docs it 
teach of God &#63; That lie is the Creator with whom 
there is no being to share the dominion&#44; without whom 
there is no god&#59; that He is supreme&#44; overall things&#59; 
that He is true in his word&#44; faithful in liis promises&#59; 
that He is unchanging in his essence&#44; perfect in his

happiness &#59; that He is merciful and forgiving&#44; desiring 
the welfare of his creatures&#44; and ever intent on giving 
them opportunities to retrieve the errors which they 
have committed&#44; and to propitiate their God by an 
amended line of conduct&#59; that He is the Creator&#44; the 
Ruler&#44; the Saviour&#44; the Father&#44; the Friend of all that 
has life&#44; and that everything that is has been framed 
for a wise&#44; useful&#44; and benevolent purpose. Is this 
exposition of our doctrines beautiful&#44; animating&#44; con&#8211; 
soling&#63; Assuredly it is&#59; for in it we find ourselves 
the special objects of a wise Providence&#44; who watches 
over us&#44; and loves and protects us&#44; who desires our 
happiness&#44; and forsakes us not even when we have 
wickedly rejected his mercy&#44; but benignantly calls to 
us hy means of the instruments so accessible to his 
omnipotence to bethink ourselves concerning our 
deeds&#44; and to come back to his paternal embrace&#44; 
where we shall lind peace without end&#44; blessing with&#8211; 
out measure. &#8212; This is our belief&#59; this is the doctrine 
of the law of life. But are the doctrines of other sys&#8211; 
tems equally pure&#44; equally simple &#63; &#8212; No&#44; they deny 
the m&#94;rcy of God to all except to the comparatively 
few who profess a certain set of ideas &#59; they&#44; some at 
least&#44; imagine a complication in the person of the 
Deity&#44; and fancy&#44; and so teach&#44; that there can be no 
happiness&#44; no peace&#44; no salvation without the inter&#8211; 
vention of a being neither God nor man&#44; according to 
some&#44; or&#44; as others have it&#44; by a divine being&#44; who 
had to become a sacrifice for the sins of man. And&#44; 
if we ask for the proof that the Bible ever inculcated 
such a doctrine&#44; we are referred to a number of pas&#8211; 
sages which&#44; not one of them&#44; teaches it in so many 
words&#59; on the contrary&#44; all insist that the Divine

Being who spoke to Moses is tlie one&#44; sole&#44; eternal&#44; 
merciful God&#44; who hears jjrayer&#44; and forgives the 
sinner who returns from his evil and acts righteously. 

If then the gentile or the unbeliever smiles over our 
arrogance&#44; as it sometimes is termed&#44; in calling our&#8211; 
selves a peculiar people&#44; a favourite race &#58; we will 
point out to him the many excellencies and beauties 
which are either derived from our law&#44; and thence 
transferred to other systems&#44; or which are as yet alone 
our guides and our doctrines. Well may we then 
say in the fulness of our gratitude &#58; &#34; Blessed be our 
God who hath created us for his glory&#44; and separated 
us from those who go astray&#44; and given us a law of 
truth&#44; and planted eternal life within us&#33;&#34; &#8212; Yes&#44; be&#8211;

wrought this wonder&#44; that has set Israel apart&#44; blessed 
with truth&#44; blessed with life&#44; blessed with a law dis&#8211; 
tinct from the multitude of the gentiles&#44; who see a 
light which they do not know&#44; and hear a voice wliioh 
they do not understand. May it then be our study 
to make ourselves familiar with this heavenly treas&#8211; 
ure&#44; to endeavor to understand it in all its bearings&#44; 
and to I&#39;ullil all the duties which this knowledge de&#8211; 
mands at our hands. 

And you&#44; who are teachers in this blessed under&#8211; 
taking&#44; of the school the happy fruits of which we 
have beheld this day&#44; remember what it is you have 
undertaken. You have avowed by your presence 
and by your labours&#44; that you have a firm belief in 
Israel&#39;s God&#44; in Israel&#39;s law&#44; in Israel&#39;s hopes. Israel&#39;s 
God is the everlasting Father&#44; from whom all that is 
has sprung into being&#59; Israel&#39;s law is that blessed

lasting will and covenant&#59; Israel&#39;s liopes are the 
bright days of a happy future which in God&#39;s own 
time will dawn upon the world&#44; dispt&#8211;l the mists of 
darkness&#44; of doubt&#44; of superstition&#44; of unbelief&#44; and 
establish the kinmlom of God over the hearts of all 
men from sea to sea&#44; and from pole to pole&#44; in which 
days the Lord will be called one&#44; and one shall be 
his name. Remember this &#33; hold to this truth firmly &#33; 
and use your influence&#44; your authority&#44; all the arts 
of persuasion flowing from a holy enthusiasm&#44; to im&#8211; 
press the same belief and hopes on the minds of those 
who come unto you to drink through your means the 
waters of the fountain of life which was opened unto 
us on Mount Sinai &#59; and let your virtuous example 
prove to your charges that in following your steps 
they are treading safely and iirmly the path&#44; which 
leads to everlasting happiness and salvation. 

Parents &#33; you whom the Lord has permitted to 
become fathers and mothers in Israel&#44; to you we look 
confidently to be the spiritual guides of your offspring. 
The law says&#58; &#34;And thou shalt teach them diligently 
unto thy children&#44; and speak of them when thou sit&#8211; 
test in thy house&#44; when thou walkest by the way&#44; 
when thou best down&#44; and when thou risest up.&#34; 
Remember this duty &#59; let religion be a frequent sub&#8211; 
ject of conversation in the presence of your children&#44; 
not the one&#44; God forbid&#44; wdiicli should call in question 
the truths of the law&#44; or throw discredit upon its pre&#8211; 
cepts&#44; but one of encouragement&#44; which should en&#8211; 
deavour to explain in a familiar manner the doctrines 
which have been handed down to us&#44; and the duties 
which we should observe. But if the proper infoiM

under the persuasion that tliis course is one of the 
greatest duties which you owe to yourselves&#44; to your 
children&#44; to your fellow&#8211; Israelites&#44; and above all&#44; to 
your God. &#8212; But be especially watchful that no act 
of yours should teach your children to neglect re&#8211;

they obtain at school or from men who speak to them 
in the name of tlie Lord&#59; and thus only can you fulfil 
the obligation which you admit to rest upon you by 
desiring that your offspring should be instructed in 
the word of God. 

If all thus combine&#44; if teachers&#44; fathers&#44; and mothers 
all contribute to make the law of life understood and 
obeyed&#58; how readily will then the children&#44; who are 
the objects of this holy care&#44; respond in their knowl&#8211; 
edge and their conduct to the wishes of their own 
immediate friends and all Israel&#59; the blessed truths 
of revelation will then flourish in their hearts &#59; their 
deeds will correspond with the spirit which animates 
them&#59; and they&#44; their teachers&#44; their parents&#44; and 
they who are their fellows in the only true religion&#44; 
will rcyoice with songs of thanksgiving at the time 
when the spirits of the blessed will stand to judgment 
before that adorable&#44; nnending&#44; only God&#44; who alone 
in his wisdom separated us from the nations&#44; and 
planted in our midst the law of life&#44; his truth&#44; his

Brethren&#33; 

On an occasion like this&#44; when every heart is glad&#44; 
when every soul is moved by a holy sensation of a 
goodly work accomplished&#44; it well beseems the re&#8211; 
flecting mind to turn with thoughtful scrutiny unto 
the object of all those festivities which it has wit&#8211; 
nessed. We never act without a motive &#59; in the most 
trivial action&#44; where the will is not constrained&#44; there 
is a free impulse which prompts the soul&#44; which moves 
the inward man to put forward his mental and bodily 
energy to accomplish his desire &#59; and surely the scene 
witnessed this day&#44; the sounds of psalmody the pro&#8211; 
cessions&#44; the hymns and the words of praise&#44; all pro&#8211; 
ceeding from a free will&#44; from a consenting and yield&#8211;

not have been present this joyous and crowded assem&#8211;

piety. Yet we may not see Him and live&#59; whilst the 
clay covers the spirit&#44; the ethereal essence cannot be 
revealed to our eyes&#44; the material cannot behold the 
immaterial&#44; the impnre cannot look on the holy. Bnt 
in times of old when we had a spot especially conse&#8211; 
crated by an evident miracle&#44; whereon stood the house 
which our fathers had built&#44; there was a somethino&#8211;&#44; 
an appearance not like the emptiness which now re&#8211; 
sides in our places of assembly&#44; a something unusual&#44; 
awful&#44; mysterious&#44; which was on occasions rendered 
manifest to the eyes of the worshippers&#44; which proved 
that there the more immediate glory of the Lord did 
dwell. When&#44; however&#44; sin became reo&#8211;nant amono&#8211; 
our tribes&#44; our families&#44; and our households&#44; this glory 
left our desecrated temple&#44; and the heathens entered 
the holy of holies&#44; and uttered loud shouts of exulta&#8211; 
tion when the flame seized pinnacle after pinnacle&#44; 
when rafter after rafter came crashing down into the 
fiery sea below&#44; when the walls were crushed&#44; and the 
foundations laid bare&#44; and desolation triumphed over 
the structure&#44; that was once beautiful and sublime&#44; 
the joy of our nation&#44; the boast of our assemblies. 
And now we are scattered&#44; congregated in small num&#8211; 
bers in every land which shuts not out our wanderino&#8211; 
race from its boundaries&#44; and we essay&#44; wherever per&#8211; 
mitted&#44; to erect minor sanctuaries to meet therein as 
one man to call in the language of ancient Israel on 
the God of our fathers. And though the visible glory 
does not till these walls as when Solomon brought in 
the ark of the covenant into the holy of holies &#58; we 
have every reason to believe that a pious adoration&#44; 
flowing from a sincere conviction&#44; accompanied by a 
due humility&#44; because that we are in a house devoted

to the service of the only God&#44; conscious that we stand 
in the presence of Ilim who sees every secret of onr 
hearts&#44; will cause our prayers to Ije received in favour&#44; 
and&#44; what is more&#44; it will subdue our whole nature to 
the Lord of all &#59; it will chain us indissolubly to the 
horns of his altar&#44; and make every deed of our life an 
act of worship&#44; every day of our existence a day of 
mental repose&#44; spent&#44; so to say&#44; in the sacred precincts 
of our Father&#39;s house. Such a spirit of piety may well 
be said to be the effect of the peculiar grace&#44; the oii&#8211; 
spring of that invisible glory&#44; which must be sought 
for in the places especially devoted to prayer&#44; where 
brethren meet in unity to concentrate their forces&#44; to 
elevate their voices&#44; and to send upward their united 
petitions to the throne of Grace. And where such a 
sacred union prevails&#44; where the liearts are humble&#44; 
where the spirits are contrite&#44; abashed before the pu&#8211; 
rity which is the character of God&#44; subdued by the 
awe which the mortal must feel when approaching 
the Creator&#44; who can doubt that there the glory of 
the Eternal will indeed come&#44; to bless&#44; to purify&#44; to 
exalt&#44; to hear&#44; and to save&#63; &#8212; Those who are weak in 
faith&#44; the children of worldliness may doubt&#59; but not 
so they who place a firm reliance on tlic revelation of 
the Bible&#44; who are the sincere followers of the God 
of Jacob. For these are the words of the prophet 
Isaiah which he utters as proceeding from the Most 
Holy speaking comfort to the humble and contrite &#58;

&#34;Por thus saith the high and lofty One that abidoth to eternity 
and whoso name is Holy&#44; I dwell in the high and holy j&#41;lacs&#44; and 
also with him who is contrite and of a lowly spirit&#44; to revive the 
spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite.&#34; Isaiah 
Ivii. 15. 

No matter then whether we are in captivity&#44; or in 
Palestine&#44; whether our teachers are the lords of the 
earth&#44; or the lowly ones who propagate the Word in 
dread of the persecutor&#39;s sword&#44; whether we are pros&#8211; 
perous in worldly goods or suffering the pangs of 
penury &#58; it is all the same to our God and King&#44; lie 
sees us alike in all situations &#59; and if the spirit be 
true&#44; then will He be in the midst of us&#59; and our 
thoughts will be purified&#44; our soul will become ele&#8211; 
vated&#44; the will must become subdued&#44; and the doc&#8211; 
trines of religion must triumph over the inspirations 
of sinful desires&#44; so that our conduct will proclaim us 
to all the world&#44; more loudly&#44; more clearly than mere 
words can do&#44; children of grace&#44; cliildren of divine 
salvation. 

Is it then enough&#44; beloved friends&#44; that we dedicate 
synagogues for outward worship without an inward 
consecration &#63; Think on one thing&#44; that it is not so 
many stones&#44; so many beams of wood&#44; so many deco&#8211; 
rative ornaments&#44; which can become the habitation 
of the Lord&#44; if the wickedness of our deeds&#44; the un&#8211; 
hallowedness of our thoughts bid the Holy Spirit to 
remove from us. Was not the temple of Solomon the 
most costly building of antiquity &#63; and jct Nebuchad&#8211; 
nezzar burnt it &#59; was not the temple of Zerubbabel&#44;

high above the beauty and elegance of Jernsalera&#44; 
also subverted by the Roman Titus &#63; 

And why was the wrath poured out &#63; Simply be&#8211; 
cause the people confided in the outward temple&#44; and 
forgot the spirit which alone could preserve the struc&#8211; 
ture of human hands from the destroyer. During the 
first period of our history&#44; the sin of idolatry was 
prevalent among us&#59; we saw the nations around us 
bowing to stocks and stones&#44; we saw the freedom 
from moral restraint which rendered every act lawful 
for them &#58; and we were seized with the mania that 
there must be something useful in acts which&#44; whilst &#44; 
they left ample scope for the indulgence of the pas&#8211; 
sions&#44; brought with them&#44; to appearance&#44; no worldly 
sufferings&#44; inasmuch as empires flourished though 
their kings and people adored the works of their 
hands&#44; and observed not the restraints which the 
law of Moses required&#44; and ate unhallowed food in 
the temples of their gods&#44; and I&#39;ioted in pleasures 
which our code denounced as sinful. We saw this&#44; 
and were deceived &#59; and our rulers led the way in the 
path of apostacy&#59; till the gods of Judah were equal 
in number to its cities&#59; every where was rebellion 
against the heavenly kingdom &#59; every where heathen&#8211; 
ism rose triumphant above the blessed Pentateuch. 
What was the end&#63; Simply that the boasted sanc&#8211; 
tuary&#44; which in the midst of all our sins&#44; we still loved&#44; 
was taken from us &#59; the glory of God fied from it&#44; be&#8211; 
cause near it was the image of abomination &#59; and the 
enemy swept away with fire the palace of the Most 
High which He had cast ofl&#34; in his wrath&#44; it being no 
longer the dwelling of his spirit&#44; because his children 
had sinned.

Our residence among the bcathens&#44; the daily view 
of the follies which they practised&#44; cnred us of our 
love for idols during a captivity of seventy years&#44; 
when we dwelt on the banks of the Euphrates and 
the Tigris&#44; where we hung&#44; on the willows of Baby&#8211; 
lon&#39;s streams&#44; the tuneful harps&#44; which in happier 
days had sounded their melodies to the sacred songs 
of Zion. &#8212; And Avith a return of more righteous feel&#8211; 
ings&#44; the mercy of the Lord also returned to us&#44; and 
Cyrus caused a proclamation to be sent out giving 
liberty to the sons of Judah to rebuild the house&#44; the 
destruction of which they mourned by annual fasts 
and humiliations. &#8212; Again stood on its old foundation 
Israel&#39;s house of prayer&#44; the priests again sacrificed 
on the altar&#44; and the spirit of prophecy again com&#8211; 
forted those who mourned the minor splendour of the 
new temple. But whilst the entire people had not 
been recalled to their former homes&#44; the gift of proph&#8211; 
ecy was not any longer vouchsafed to the small rem&#8211; 
nant which had returned&#44; any farther than to confirm 
the ancient covenant at Iloreb&#44; and to exhort the Is&#8211; 
raelites to remain faithful to the end&#44; with the prom&#8211; 
ise of temporal and spiritual blessedness. Yet would 
we not hear&#33; we had learned to despise idolatry&#59; but 
the love of God had&#44; notwithstanding this&#44; not alto&#8211; 
gether subdued our hearts. Instead of idol worship&#44; 
as during the first temple&#44; we dived into the philo&#8211; 
sophical systems of our neighbours&#44; and divided our&#8211; 
selves into fierce political and religious sects&#44; as 
though we could&#44; by disunion&#44; build up our God&#8211;gov&#8211; 
erned commonwealth. Heathen views&#44; under a dif&#8211;

ship of God. Anon&#44; the internal dissension&#44; at first 
glowing under the surface&#44; broke out into open strife&#59; 
and scarcely had our oppressed state been wrested 
from the grasp of a madman&#44; Antiochus Epiphanes 
he was called&#44; scarcely had victory against all out&#8211; 
ward enemies crowned the arms of Judah&#39;s bravest 
sons &#58; when domestic contentions&#44; encouraged by a 
disregard of the duties demanded by the law&#44; caused 
factious brothers to call in the arbitrament of Roman 
generals&#44; who soon made their dn&#8211;eful power felt in 
every dwelling in all our land&#44; and we became tribu&#8211; 
tary vassals to Rome&#44; and accepted chiefs and kings 
of its appointment. Misfortune&#44; however&#44; had not 
taught us to resort to the counsels of wisdom&#59; we 
continued our contests in the very streets of Jerusa&#8211; 
lem&#44; brother warred against brother&#44; and all ties of 
kindred were dissolved. The temple w&#39;as still hon&#8211; 
oured&#44; and thousands poured out their blood like 
water&#44; and heroes ofiered their forms as a rampart 
around it&#44; over which the enemy could only pass 
after their souls had fled &#59; but the crimes of the peo&#8211; 
ple had rendered the sanctuary abhorred in the sight 
of Heaven&#44; and the deeds of heroism were in vain&#44; 
and useless were the rivers of blood that were shed&#59; 
for the enemy prevailed as in ages before. Yet it 
was not the Roman prowess&#44; but the crimes of the 
Jews wdiich overthrew all at one fell swoop&#44; and thus 
were but too literally fulfilled the threatenings of the 
father of the prophets&#44; given us as a warning just be&#8211; 
fore the close of his earthly career. 

Did this take place because Israel&#44; as a nation&#44; 
were entirely rejected from the pale of God&#39;s mercy&#63; 
O no &#33; We are taught&#44; in many passages in Scripture&#44;

that the Lord would never forsake the people of his 
covenant. What&#44; then&#44; was the cause of this terrible 
catastrophe &#63; It was&#44; as we have said already&#44; that 
the people had neglected the truth&#44; and sought in 
other paths for that happiness which can be found 
only in the ways of the law. What use was there 
among such for the ceremonials&#44; the solemnities&#44; the 
presence itself of the outward temple&#44; when the spirit&#44; 
which alone could render the whole acceptable&#44; had 
been banished by the disputes of philosophical schools 
and the crimes and outrages&#44; of contending factions&#63; 
It was for this reason&#44; then&#44; that the glory of the Lord 
passed away from the midst of us&#44; and left us to re&#8211; 
ceive the just punishment of our crimes&#44; crimes which 
could only be atoned for&#44; so was the decree of eternal 
Justice&#44; by the dismemberment of our state&#44; by the 
slaughter of our people&#44; and by the destruction of all 
that was lield sacred and dear among us. 

We would therefore deceive ourselves&#44; should we 
think that outward ceremonials&#44; that the pomp of 
worship alone could be enough to propitiate the Lord 
if we sin&#44; or were we to presume that lie would ac&#8211; 
cept external acts if the inward sauctification be want&#8211; 
imy&#8211;. &#8212; How then shall we do on an occasion like this&#63; 
Shall we be satisfied with the ceremonial&#44; the anthem&#44; 
the psalm and the loud exclamations&#44; the&#39; united re&#8211; 
sponses of joyous hundreds&#63; no&#33; we should bring 
a sacrifice of our will upon the altar of virtue&#44; we 
should reflect that&#44; by coming to worship&#44; we also 
come to acknovv ledge the supreme rule of the Creator. 
As servants therefore of the Omnipotent shoukl we 
approach his presence&#59; we should endeavour to learn 
what He desires us to do&#44; and then follow his guid&#8211;

ance&#44; without regarding the difficulties which may be 
ill oar way&#44; unchecked by dangers&#44; undismayed by 
opposition&#44; untemptcd by worldly allurements. &#34;We 
ought to reflect that our deeds are not&#44; as though a 
mortal only watched us&#44; likely to be forgotten&#44; over&#8211; 
looked or excused&#44; but that the eye that beholds us is 
wakeful&#44; always observant&#44; never dimmed by watch&#8211; 
ing&#44; never wearied with fatigue&#59; that therefore each 
of our deeds will come up in judgment against us&#44; 
both in this life and the life to come&#44; to demand 
against us whatever visitation our misconduct may 
have merited. Such a view of our accountability will 
check within us every desire for transgression&#44; and 
will enable us to withstand every allurement which 
might appeal to us to forsake the way of the Lord. 
For what can to a mind&#44; tlius feeling&#44; counterbalance 
the incurrence of the displeasure of Heaven &#63; Tell 
him tliat wealth will pour into his treasure&#8211;chambers&#59; 
but will he not answer&#44; Will this save me from the 
judgment of my God&#63; Assure him that the height 
of human power will be his&#59; but he will appeal to 
you. Will such greatness excuse my sinning against 
the law of my Maker &#63; &#8212; But where this inward piety 
is wanting&#44; how readily is every excuse snatched at 
to extenuate the commitment of every wrong. A 
paltry item of gain will then induce one to violate the 
Sabbath&#44; to labour every day in the year&#44; to think but 
rarely or never of the welfare of the immortal soul&#44; 
as though the few extra pieces of silver which the Sab&#8211; 
bath&#8211;labour may perhaps bring could weigh against 
the displeasure of the Lord&#44; as though the hoarding 
up of a little superfluous wealth were all the duty of 
man on earth. &#8212; Another&#44; who fears not truly the in&#8211;

dignation of God&#44; violates the laws of neighbourly 
love&#44; utterly regardless of the rights of every one 
who comes in contact with him&#44; as if every thing on 
earth were made for him only&#44; and every one had 
need to bend the knee to his authority. We will not 
multiply illustrations&#59; but of this we may be sure&#44; 
that an act of wickedness will readily be perpetrated&#44; 
when the spirit is not properly subdued&#44; when the 
passions have not been subjected to the guidance of 
the divine law&#44; when the man is not fully alive to the 
knowledge that to his God are due every act of his 
life and every thought which his soul can frame. It 
is not to be denied that the attainment of this degree 
of piety is not very easy&#44; or that constant watching 
and care are not required to enable us to make prog&#8211; 
ress in this holy calling&#44; or that without heavenly 
grace all our labours would be in vain. &#8212; But then is 
not this end the chief object of our existence&#63; What 
fatigues do we not undergo to acquire wealth and 
renown &#33; how many sleepless nights does not the 
voluptuary spend to gain the enjoyment of some 
fleeting pleasure &#33; And shall we think the salvation 
of our soul of too little importance to labour thereat 
from the beginning of our earthly existence till its 
close by death&#63; Besides this&#44; the care of our spirit 
does not preclude us from following worldly pursuits 
under the limitations of the law of Moses&#59; nay&#44; the 
rational enjoj&#8211;ment of all earthly gifts&#44; the acquisition 
of wealth&#44; the obtainment of an honoured name&#44; are 
all blessings which the law sets before us as gifts of 
God which lie bestows on his servants. But we 
should take heed that&#44; in being worldly&#44; we be care&#8211; 
ful that we exchange not the substance for a shadow&#44;

and make the body the first&#44; the soul the last object 
of our solicitude. And when we thus move onward&#44; 
when we are honest in our endeavours to overcome 
sin and its temptation&#58; the spirit of God will come to 
our aid&#44; and render easy&#44; every day easier&#44; the work 
of purification&#44; till at length obstacles which at first 
seemed to bar our progress on the way of righteous&#8211; 
jiess will not be heeded&#44; not felt&#44; till we arrive at the 
palace of our Father&#44; the portals of which will then 
stand open to receive our spirit&#44; purified above the 
angels by the trials and temptations of an earthly and 
a sinful life. 

It is for a purpose like this&#44; that it is proper to dedi&#8211; 
cate places of worship&#44; in order that one may encour&#8211; 
age the other&#44; and urge him on by a righteous exam&#8211; 
ple to become quick in the service of the Lord&#44; to be 
in very truth a son of Israel&#44; a child of salvation. The 
spirit loves to link itself to spirit &#59; man loves to see 
others striving for the same end&#44; it proves to him that 
there is something actually worthy of attainment in 
liis pui&#39;suit. When&#44; therefore&#44; many come to wor&#8211;

Abraham&#44; Isaac&#44; and Jacob&#44; each one will feel him&#8211;

for the renown of his lineage&#44; any self&#8211;respect in his 
Jewish descent&#44; any fear of his Maker&#44; endeavour to 
prove by his moral&#44; no less than his religious conduct&#44; 
that his soul is animated by the sacred fire of devo&#8211;

following counsels which proceed from suspicious 
sources. &#8212; Let humility be your watchword&#44; listen to 
instruction&#44; suspect ever your own wisdom&#59; for in 
humility alone and in distrust of our own mental
