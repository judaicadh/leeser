          <p rend="indent(1)"><hi rend="underline">Note</hi>&#58; We insert cheerfully <persName>Mr Mack&#39;s</persName> letter which gives <add>&#63;</add><lb/> an account of the people<add>&#63;</add> of the congregation to which he is attached&#59; but we would<lb/> call his attention to the last statement at the bottom of page 47 of this column<lb/> which will prove to him that we had not forgotten the existence of the school<lb/> of which he speaks with such hopeful terms&#44; and in which we trust he may<lb/> not be disappointed. <persName>Mr M.</persName> must pardon us one remark&#44; that it seems<lb/> strange to us that he has overlooked the services of the <persName>Reverend James K.<lb/> Gutheim</persName> when preliminary labours have most assuredly paved the way for<lb/> the perhaps more successful <add>&#63;</add> of the Respected <persName>Mrs G.</persName> needs not our<lb/> defense&#59; for his present position is every way a proud one to so beloved by a<lb/> numerous &#38; growing constituency and to be reelected without any <add>&#63;</add><lb/> prove that he is not im<add>&#63;</add> to any now in the ranks of our ministry. <add>&#63;</add><lb/> he has yet met <add>&#63;</add>&#59; but we are sure that he himself does not desire<lb/> to assure the appearance of bury the past when there was suitable <add>&#63;</add><lb/> yet before him. <add>&#63;</add> <placeName>Israel</placeName> have many very many more&#44; and may our<lb/> eyes see it&#44; who can and <add>&#63;</add> willing to labour on the good cause&#58; they<lb/> are all needed and all with be amply employed&#44; so soon as their merits are<lb/> known.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">We here also received a remonstrance as regard to a remark he made&#44; that</p>
		<pb n="2"/>
			<p><add>&#63;</add> had offered the Sunday school publish <persName>Mr Macks</persName> letter<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> Two of the gentlemen alluded to have written to us that they<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> because they had asked for the <add>&#63;</add> of the Synagogue <add>&#63;</add><lb/> a <date>sabbath</date> afternoon to teach Hebrew to those who do not attend the<lb/> Sunday school&#44; <add>&#63;</add> that the holy day of rest could not be better employed<lb/> than in diffusing a knowledge of the same language and our laws and were<lb/> refused a compliance with their request. We are deeply pained at this<lb/> difference of opinion&#44; and yet more that it has led to a little unpleas&#45;<lb/>antness of feeling. We had the pleasure of making the personal acquain&#45;<lb/>tance of several of the gentlemen in question during our <add>&#63;</add><lb/> <add>&#63;</add>&#44; and cannot help thinking that it requires but a little mutual yielding<lb/> to write them all in the glorious cause of the regeneration of that portion<lb/> of <placeName>Israel</placeName> scattered in and around the green city of the west. Will they then<lb/> listen to our <add>&#63;</add> based and heart in the glorious<lb/> work&#63; Why should slight misapprehension <add>&#63;</add> hearts <add>&#63;</add> should<lb/> <add>&#63;</add>&#63; We know well enough that emotional jealousies arising<lb/> from a difference of our birth place&#44; early habits &#38; early <add>&#63;</add> are<lb/> great drawbacks to a thorough union of Israelites&#59; but in the name of<lb/> our common religion&#44; let us cease to call each other &#8220;bigots&#8221; or &#8220;new light&#8221;<lb/> or other terms of reproach which likeliness of mind is so ready to reveal.<lb/> We have at last all but one <add>&#63;</add> &#8220;the promotion of the good cause&#59; at all<lb/> events we all employ this magical phrase&#59; let us then show that we<lb/> are in earnest&#44; and our enemies will be unfounded when they see the Jews<lb/> united for <placeName>Israel&#39;s</placeName> God and <placeName>Israel&#39;s</placeName> Law&#44; and <placeName>Israel&#39;s</placeName> <add>&#63;</add>&#33; Come brothers&#33;<lb/> meet as friends who have been estranged and have again been united<lb/> in peace in God&#39;s cause for God&#39;s sake&#59; you are all to affect much<lb/> good by union&#59; but you are powerless if you are divided.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">Finally it would state that our <add>&#63;</add> to establish general<lb/> schools was not because we were ignorant of the <add>&#63;</add> of the<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> institute&#44; but because we wished to see all other agree<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> but to rest satisfied till they have each member remaining &#38;<lb/> till all Jewish children shall have an opportunity in this <add>&#63;</add> land<lb/> to acquire Daily a knowledge of our holy language and religion so that<lb/> a person or a Jew ignorant of <sic>there</sic> most important matters shall not be found<lb/> and we are glad to say&#44; that the desire is at length aroused&#44; and we<lb/> trust that it may lead to action and to many glorious results. &#160;&#160;<hi rend="underline">Ed.
