            <p rend="indent(1)">Whether <add>?</add> himself or<lb/> by whom, or by what
                society<lb/> contributed I have been unable<lb/> to learn and as the donors
                have<lb/> studiously avoided publicity<lb/> I presume there will be no mention<lb/>
                made of it. The address presented<lb/> to him was by the Trustees &amp; not by<lb/>
                the congregation who were never<lb/> consulted in the matter—nor was the<lb/>
                reply</p>

            <p rend="align(right)">5</p>
            <p>for any sin on my part, that her merits, and her<lb/>
                <add>?</add> love for me may plead at the gates<lb/> of mercy and procure that
                pardon I daily<lb/> so ardently solicit, yes in the integrity of my<lb/> heart I
                pray that this bereavement <add>?</add> bear<lb/> atonement for my sins. Of her
                happiness (so far<lb/> as human eye can see, or human ken can
                fathom<add>?</add>)<lb/> there is no doubt I only trust that I may be at<lb/> the
                end of life be as worthy a place among the<lb/> blessed and meet her in that state
                of bliss.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Grandfather<add>?</add> desires his regards to you he<lb/> feels
                rather <sic>anoyed</sic> at your silence, and says<lb/> that he thinks you might at
                least have written<lb/> him some particulars of your affairs knowing<lb/> how much a
                fathers part he had taken always<lb/> and still would exercise for you were he<lb/>
                in a position to do so. Pray write him as soon<lb/> as you can. At last you have
                seen my <persName>Uncle<lb/> Moses</persName>; let me know what you think of<lb/>
                him, you must by this time have discovered<lb/> whether his letters bespeak him what
                you<lb/> find him. My love to all friends, tell <persName>Mrs C</persName><lb/> I
                long to see her and all my <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> friends</p>

            <p>6</p>
            <p>but I cannot leave <persName>David</persName> who is doing all he<lb/> can to make
                comfortable. I have long since<lb/> given up the school by his wish, finding
                him<lb/>self in a situation to <add>?</add> make me independent<lb/> of public
                patronage and thank Heaven my<lb/> honored and revered mother lived to see it, but<lb/>
                <add>?</add> a few short months before her<lb/> flight to a better world. My mind so
                often<lb/> strays to the spot where her mortal remains<lb/> are conferred, and
                oftener in regions above, where<lb/> I could almost <add>?</add> my way in happy
                com<lb/>munion with her true spirit, but I fear<lb/> to <sic>endulge</sic> in these
                day dreams lest my mind<lb/> be carried way by derangement I often<lb/> think of how
                    <persName>Sally Sola</persName> was and <add>?</add> the<lb/> dwelling on this
                    <add>?</add> theme. So farewell<lb/> my friend, may you live to rejoice
                over<lb/> all trials and disappoint all those who<lb/> have so long made it their
                study to thwart<lb/> you. We I hope shall yet meet in this life<lb/> if not, may a
                better one await us. But that<lb/> we may both live to shake a friendly hand again
                is<lb/> the wish of your respectful friend</p>
