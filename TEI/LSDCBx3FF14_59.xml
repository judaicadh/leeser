				<p>My Dear Sir</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Your monthly packages come<lb/> regularly to hand per Express.  You<lb/> send more numbers than I have<lb/> obtained subscribers for&#8212;in future<lb/> you had better send less.  I would name<lb/> <persName>Desola</persName>&#8212;<persName>Allen</persName>&#8212;<persName>Dr David</persName>&#8212;<persName>J Levy</persName>&#8212;<lb/> <persName>Mr Joseph</persName>&#8212;<persName>Bresler</persName>&#8212;<persName>Silverman</persName><lb/> <persName>G Benjamin</persName>&#8212;<persName>S Benjamin</persName>&#8212;<persName>Wm Benjamin</persName>&#8212;<lb/> <persName>L Solomon</persName>&#8212;<persName>A S Hart</persName>&#8212;<persName><add>&#63;</add> Benjamin</persName> &#38; <persName>Kahn</persName><lb/> 14 subscribers.  Many of these expected<lb/> that when you failed in publishing<lb/> the Advocate you would have made<lb/> the Occident more of a newspaper<lb/> &#38; a channel for the communication<lb/> of Jewish intelligence.  Of course<lb/> I know little of your subscribers<lb/> elsewhere&#44; but I believe ours here<lb/> to have the usual coverage of<lb/> intelligence &#38; education and yet<lb/> the</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>articles on Christian Dogmas<lb/> congregational disputes&#44; sermons &#38;c<lb/> they consider of very trivial importance<lb/> as compared with reports of Education<lb/> Societies and the establishment<lb/> of new congregations &#38; Institutions<lb/> of occasion kinds&#8212;you will please<lb/> observe these to be the views of<lb/> our <hi rend="underline">people</hi> generally composed of<lb/> Germans with an imperfect<lb/> knowledge of English.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">You will have heard of <persName>D Raphals</persName><lb/> visit.  His course of Lectures was<lb/> more numerously attended than<lb/> any before delivered in <placeName>Montreal</placeName><lb/> excited more admiration &#38;<lb/> were more respectfully patronized</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The summer season is not the<lb/> most favourable &#38; the room could<lb/> not contain all who came yet they<lb/> must have netted him &#36;300</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
			<p rend="indent(1)">He was advertised to preach in the<lb/> synagogue on two occasions&#8212;the first<lb/> I did not attend but at the second<lb/> I found myself required to surrender<lb/> my seat to Ladies &#38; many of the<lb/> children were standing in order<lb/> to make room for the crowd of<lb/> women thus invited&#8212;and even<lb/> the readers desk was occupied<lb/> by a Christian.  Having always<lb/> been in favor of the <add>&#63;</add> separation<lb/> of families I was rather pleased<lb/> to find our trustees thus sanction<lb/> the introduction of females to the<lb/> floor of the Building <persName>Dr<lb/> Raphael</persName> was visited by many of<lb/> the clergy who all expressed them<lb/>selves equally well pleased <add>&#63;</add> his<lb/> sermons his lectures &#38; himself.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The usual address was</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>presented to him at the termination<lb/> of his course.  He subsequently gave<lb/> a lecture for the benefit of a<lb/> <sic>christian</sic> &#38; a Jewish society.  It<lb/> happened rather oddly that the<lb/> Jewish Society had ceased to exist<lb/> however the proceeds will answer<lb/> some good purpose.  I have since<lb/> heard that <persName>Lewas<add>&#63;</add></persName> presented <add>&#63;</add><lb/> a piece of plate by <persName>Mr Heys</persName></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Whether <add>&#63;</add> himself or<lb/> by whom&#44; or by what society<lb/> contributed I have been unable<lb/> to learn and as the donors have<lb/> studiously avoided publicity<lb/> I presume there will be no mention<lb/> made of it.  The address presented<lb/> to him was by the Trustees &#38; not by<lb/> the congregation who were never<lb/> consulted in the matter&#8212;nor was the<lb/> reply</p>

				<p rend="align(right)">5</p>
				<p>for any sin on my part&#44; that her merits&#44; and her<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> love for me may plead at the gates<lb/> of mercy and procure that pardon I daily<lb/> so ardently solicit&#44; yes in the integrity of my<lb/> heart I pray that this bereavement <add>&#63;</add> bear<lb/> atonement for my sins. Of her happiness &#40;so far<lb/> as human eye can see&#44; or human ken can fathom<add>&#63;</add>&#41;<lb/> there is no doubt I only trust that I may be at<lb/> the end of life be as worthy a place among the<lb/> blessed and meet her in that state of bliss.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Grandfather<add>&#63;</add> desires his regards to you he<lb/> feels rather <sic>anoyed</sic> at your silence&#44; and says<lb/> that he thinks you might at least have written<lb/> him some particulars of your affairs knowing<lb/> how much a fathers part he had taken always<lb/> and still would exercise for you were he<lb/> in a position to do so.  Pray write him as soon<lb/> as you can.  At last you have seen my <persName>Uncle<lb/> Moses</persName>&#59; let me know what you think of<lb/> him&#44; you must by this time have discovered<lb/> whether his letters bespeak him what you<lb/> find him.  My love to all friends&#44; tell <persName>Mrs C</persName><lb/> I long to see her and all my <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> friends</p>

				<p>but I cannot leave <persName>David</persName> who is doing all he<lb/> can to make comfortable.  I have long since<lb/> given up the school by his wish&#44; finding him<lb/>self in a situation to <add>&#63;</add> make me independent<lb/> of public patronage and thank Heaven my<lb/> honored and revered mother lived to see it&#44; but<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> a few short months before her<lb/> flight to a better world.  My mind so often<lb/> strays to the spot where her mortal remains<lb/> are conferred&#44; and oftener in regions above&#44; where<lb/> I could almost <add>&#63;</add> my way in happy com<lb/>munion with her true spirit&#44; but I fear<lb/> to <sic>endulge</sic> in these day dreams lest my mind<lb/> be carried way by derangement I often<lb/> think of how <persName>Sally Sola</persName> was and <add>&#63;</add> the<lb/> dwelling on this <add>&#63;</add> theme.  So farewell<lb/> my friend&#44; may you live to rejoice over<lb/> all trials and disappoint all those who<lb/> have so long made it their study to thwart<lb/> you.  We I hope shall yet meet in this life<lb/> if not&#44; may a better one await us.  But that<lb/> we may both live to shake a friendly hand again is<lb/> the wish of your respectful friend</p>
