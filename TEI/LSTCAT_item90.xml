				<p rend="align(center)">To <del>the Editor</del> <addressee>R I</addressee> of the Asmonean.</p>
				<p>Sir</p>
				<p>an article which appeared in the Asmonean of the<lb/> <date>13<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> ins. under the head of &#8220;The Occident and the Asmonean&#8221;<lb/> challenges the animadonsion<add>&#63;</add> not only of the friends of<lb/> the Revd Gentleman therein assailed&#44; but also of all friends of<lb/> truth<lb/> justice &#38; the conventional decorum of society&#44; all of which<lb/> in this article are violated.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">This Sir&#44; is a strong&#44; and may seem<lb/> to you a harsh&#44; &#38; rude assertion&#59; but I assure you&#44; that it is<lb/> not made in a wanton spirit of unkindly insult&#44; nor with<lb/> a view to provoke in your bosom any angry or unpleasant feeling&#44;<lb/> but is dictated solely by a sense of justice&#44; to the object of your<lb/> unmerited abuse&#44; and to that religious community of which you<lb/> assure to be a guide of shining light&#44; whose dignity &#38; respectability<lb/> you have outraged by the contemptuous &#38; scornful language you have<lb/> held towards a man&#44; who has <del>&#63;</del> entitled himself to the<lb/> highest position in its regard&#44; and whom is his delighted to honour with<lb/> its esteem &#38; reverence&#59;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I feel assured this if you&#44; will review the<lb/> article in a calmer frame of mind than that <add>&#63;</add> which it was<lb/> penned&#44; you will yourself feel ashamed of the grossness of tone&#44;<lb/> and unworthy jealousy&#44; with which you there endeavor to cast<lb/> obloquy upon a man&#44; whom your peevish susceptibilities have<lb/> conjured into an enemy&#44; and your jealous fancies converted into a rival&#59;</p>
				<p>What think you of the first sentence&#63; &#8220;We &#40;<persName>RI.</persName>&#41; Do not usually bandy&#8221;<lb/> &#8220;words with a man of whom we have ceased to think except with commiseration&#8221;</p>

				<p>abstract yourself &#40;if self love will allow&#41; for a moment&#44; from your own<lb/> individuality&#44; be for an instant not &#40;<persName>R I</persName>&#41; but one of the <del>mass</del> herd.<lb/> of the nameless&#8212;now consider who it is&#44; who this ceased to be aught<lb/> but the object of commiseration to <persName>R I</persName>.  Why truly it is he&#44; who<lb/> selected by one of the most ancient &#38; respectable of the<lb/> American congregations as their religious guide &#38; instructor&#44;<lb/> at an age&#44; when others have scarcely ceased from the frivolities of<lb/> boyhood&#44; gave instant proofs of piety &#38; ability&#44; which not only seemed<lb/> for him the esteem of his flock but earned him an honored &#38; venerated<lb/> name throughout <placeName>America</placeName> &#38; <placeName>Europe</placeName>&#59; <sic>It</sic> is he&#44; who when others<lb/> were droning through their hebdomadal<add>&#63;</add> duties&#44; in the lifeless and<lb/> monotonous forms of the synagogue&#44; had the energy&#44; zeal&#44; and talent<lb/> to take the lead of all others in <placeName>America</placeName>&#44; in the introduction of sermons<lb/> as a regular portion of the service&#44; for the purpose of imparting to his flock<lb/> religious instruction&#44; and of infusing a living and breathing spirit of piety<lb/> into the religious torpor that <sic>prevaded</sic>&#44; and his merits are not less in this&#44;<lb/> that his sermons thus preached&#44; <del>were</del> published at great cost &#38; pecuniary risk<lb/> by his own unaided exertions&#44; and diffused to stimulate the slumbering piety<lb/> of distant congregations&#44; furnished an example&#44; slowly followed at first&#44; and<lb/> at long &#38; wide intervals&#44; until &#40;to use the expressions of those who on a<lb/> late festival occasion&#44; <sic>commemmorated</sic> in your pages&#44; alluded to the practice&#44;<lb/> tho oblivious of his claims of precedence.&#41; it has become a &#8220;sine que non&#8221;<lb/> of synagogue requirement.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">It is he whose midnight labors&#44; illuminated<lb/> by the pious zeal which urged him on the path of usefulness&#44; in disregard<lb/> of personal pain or privation&#44; prepared for his coreligionists&#44; suitable and<lb/> correct translations&#44; of the forms of prayer used by both minhags for the<lb/> service throughout the year&#44; freed from the grammatical inaccuracies and</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">3</p>
				<p>Barbarous and inelegant phraseology which disfigured those previously<lb/> in use.  Furthermore sir it is he whose capacious intellect and untiring<lb/> enterprize&#44; conceived <hi rend="underline">the</hi> idea of establishing a periodical devoted<lb/> to Jewish advancement social &#38; religious&#59; &#38; unaided&#44; achieved it.<lb/>  It certainly does not argue favorably for the Jewish zeal&#44; religious<lb/> sincerity&#44; or intellectual qualifications of <del>the man</del> one&#44; who can boast<lb/> &#8220;that he has had no opportunity properly to appreciate&#8221; such a man&#59;<lb/> but let us as gently as we may&#44; examine the pretensions of <persName>R. I.</persName> who<lb/> &#8220;has ceased to think of such a man with any other feeling than commiseration&#44;&#8221;<lb/> <persName>RI</persName> has but recently assumed a prominent position&#44; as the Editor of a religious<lb/> print&#44; ostensibly devoted to the diffusion of religious truth &#38; knowledge&#59; and<lb/> under the banner of the <sic>maccabees</sic>&#44; stands forth&#44; the champion of Jewish<lb/> fame &#38; Jewish right.  It would be hardly fair&#44; from the short<lb/> experience the public have had of the ability with which he sustains<lb/> the character&#44; to pass a definite opinion of his merits&#59; I confess<lb/> that viewing his literary efforts as likely&#44; if not of themselves&#44; yet<lb/> by stimulating them&#44; to promote Jewish progress&#44; in faith &#38; knowledge&#59;<lb/> I have been disposed to approve them&#59; and have been willing to admire and<lb/> cheer the Banner of the Maccabees as it flaunted its folds in the air&#44;<lb/> altho&#39; I could not believe the staff upborne<add>&#63;</add> by a <persName>Sampson</persName>.<lb/>  But it is quite fair to impugn&#44; the acrimony&#44; the insolence&#44; the<lb/> jealousy &#40;<hi rend="underline">all evil passions</hi>&#41; which the editor of a professedly religious<lb/> paper exhibits in an attack against the personal character <del>&#38; public</del><lb/> <del>utility</del> of any individual&#59; how much more&#44; when against one whose<lb/> fame &#38; honor should be cherished by every Jew&#44; and by those of<lb/> <placeName>America</placeName>&#44; regarded as a subject of national pride&#33;</p>
				<p><persName>R. I</persName> &#8220;derides arrogance&#44; chastens insolence and rebuts falsehood&#8221;<lb/> did it not occur to him when framing his attack&#44; that</p>

			<p rend="indent(1)">I do not desire to pursue the subject<lb/> further&#44; and in taking leave of <persName>Mr. I.</persName> I again repeat&#44; that<lb/> it is no unkind or hostile feeling that I have written.<lb/>  If from the nature of the subject and if necessitate <add>&#63;</add>&#44; I have<lb/> been forced to use harsh &#38; ungentle expressions <del>it has bee</del><lb/> my feelings have been those of the surgeon&#44; who cuts but<lb/> to cure&#44; and whose heart feels pain&#44; while his patient bleeds.</p>
