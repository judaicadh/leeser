				<p rend="align(center)"><date>Oct 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1852</date>.</p>
				<p>Dear Sir.  Having recently gotten hold of the last issue of<lb/> the &#8220;Occident&#8221; I was much surprised on finding in it an article<lb/> from <persName>Mr E. Marcussohn</persName> denying his ever having abjured<lb/> Judaism.  Now it may be proposed to state what I know of this<lb/> gentleman&#44; as the Editor of the Occident seems to solicit information<lb/> concerning him.</p>
				<p><persName>Mr Marcussohn</persName> was introduced to me at my house by <persName>Rev<lb/> Mr Bonhomme</persName> &#40;a gentleman long and favorably known.&#41;<lb/>  He appeared a little awkward from his want of a ready use of<lb/> the English language&#44; for this he apologized&#44; and expressed a<lb/> desire to enter upon the study of it.  Thereupon I proposed that<lb/> he should instruct me in Hebrew and I would in turn teach him<lb/> English.  In order to carry out this arrangement he was to visit<lb/> me at a certain <del>period</del> hour every morning &#40;That is when his<lb/> engagements or mine did not otherwise prevent&#41;.  For several<lb/> weeks he continued to come&#44; when together we would read the<lb/> Old and New Testaments frequently <sic>stoping</sic> while reading to<lb/> comment upon some passage.  He appeared greatly interested in<lb/> the New Testament especially with those portions found in the<lb/> first chapters of <persName>Mark</persName>&#44; embracing the Savior&#39;s sermon on the<lb/> <placeName>Mount</placeName>.  He observed the most profound <sic>reverance</sic> in speaking<lb/> of <persName>Christ</persName>.  He acknowledged the importance of a Mediator in our<lb/> approaches to the Father.  Spoke of the <sic>ineficiency</sic> of the law to justify<lb/> the sinner.  Told me that he prayed to God to pardon his sins&#44; and that he<lb/> felt that he had received pardon.  I spoke plainly with him touching<lb/> the witness of the spirit&#44; &#38; the inward peace consequent upon the<lb/> forgiveness of sins.  He remarked that he felt that he had received this<lb/> witness &#38; this peace.  I felt anxious for <persName>Mr M.</persName> to be placed beyond all doubt<lb/> in regard to his spiritual change&#44; &#38; hence I often conversed with him<lb/> upon the subject of the new birth&#8212;or scripture religion.  He expressed great<lb/> dissatisfaction with the duties laid upon him as Teacher of the Jewish faith&#44;<lb/> Complained of his brethren&#44; their want of enlightenment &#38; so on.  Said he<lb/> was receiving from them &#36;500.00 a year as a salary&#44; that they paid him at<lb/> fixed times&#44; said that one installment would be due him in a few weeks&#44;</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>but that he felt that he could not remain with them up to that time as it<lb/> would be acting the part of the hypocrite.  This he mentioned more than once&#44;<lb/> Of course I could but sympathize with him&#44; in what I conceived to be the honest<lb/> <sic>struglings</sic> of conscience.</p>
				<p>On the <date>5th July</date> according to my best recollection&#44; he made his appearance at my<lb/> house&#44; greatly agitated.  Said that he had given up his church &#38; had declared<lb/> in favor of Christianity.  He stated at the same time that he need money&#44; &#38; had<lb/> no means of paying it&#44; as the Jews whom he had been serving would no doubt<lb/> withhold that portion of his salary which was due him.  Seeing him in<lb/> this unpleasant dilemma&#44; I advanced him &#36;70 which he said would<lb/> be sufficient to pay him out of debt.  He now left his boarding house&#44;<lb/> and moved his trunks to my house and lived with me.  I noticed in him<lb/> a perfect conformity to Gentile customs.</p>
				<p>When he first visited me he would not take a drink of water except<lb/> with his hat on&#44; if it was not at hand&#44; he would leave his seat and go in<lb/> search of it.  After he came to my house to live&#44; he gave up this custom&#44; indeed<lb/> he gave it up before.</p>
				<p>Again he sat at my table and ate whatever I did&#44; and what without any apparent scruple<lb/> I was a little surprised when he asked me the loan of my razor&#44; and stated that<lb/> he had never put a razor upon his face&#44; but that he had been accustomed to clip<lb/> his beard with a kind of scissors.  He handled the razor very awkwardly but<lb/> made out to sh<add>&#63;</add>.  Since then I think he has used this instrument altogether<lb/> especially during his <hi rend="underline">Conversion to Christianity</hi></p>
				<p>In regard to his church <sic>preferances</sic>&#44; he said that they were with the Methodist&#44; that he<lb/> believed in their doctrines&#44; &#38; desired to unite with them.  The time when I was to receive<lb/> him by baptism into the church was appointed but owing to some circumstance it was<lb/> <sic>defered</sic>.  In the meantime <persName>Rev. Mr Davis</persName> &#38; myself had an interview upon the subject of<lb/> his uniting with the church&#44; Our claims upon him were about equal&#44; &#38; we agreed that<lb/> neither of us would receive him&#44; or in any way influence him to become a member of our<lb/> respective communions&#44; but that we would leave him to make up deliberately his own<lb/> mind &#38; decide for himself.</p>
				<p>After this I was compelled to be absent from my station for several days and consequently<lb/> procured for <persName>Mr M.</persName> another home&#44; which was at the house of one of my members&#44; where he was<lb/> well cared for and fed.  He showed while here no anti&#45;swine disposition but</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>ate this kind of flesh with a gusto.  Since I disposed of <persName>Mr M.</persName> as<lb/> alluded to&#44; I have not seen him up to the present time.  The particulars<lb/> touching his history from thence to his setting out for <placeName>Charleston S. C.</placeName><lb/> <persName>Rev. Mr Davis</persName> can give you.  &#40;We both honestly endeavored to benefit a<lb/> man who shewd himself in our way for instruction &#38; guidance&#44; if<lb/> we have been deceived it is not any guilt of ours.  We feel <sic>acquited</sic><lb/> before God and at the bar of our own consciences.  The religion which<lb/> we profess teaches us to forgive those who wrong us.  So did our divine<lb/> Master before us&#44; &#38; so do we.  In conclusion I humbly recommend friend<lb/> <persName>Marcussohn</persName> if he has never known <persName>Christ</persName> to seek him with all his<lb/> heart&#44; &#38; when he has truly found him he will never disown him&#44; but<lb/> like his noble countryman &#38; brother after the flesh <persName>Paul</persName> he can say<lb/> &#8220;God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>&#8221; &#38;c.</p>
