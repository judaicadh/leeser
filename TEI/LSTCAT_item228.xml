				<p>O God of <persName>Abraham</persName>&#44; <persName>Isaac</persName>&#44; and <persName>Jacob</persName>&#44; our fathers&#33;<lb/>  how glorious is thy name in all the earth.  From gene&#45;<lb/>ration to generation Thou art God&#44; and beside Thee<lb/> there is no saviour and redeemer.  How blessed are<lb/> they therefore who trust in Thee&#33;  how happy those to<lb/> whom Thou art God&#33;  And ever thus were blessed thy<lb/> own heritage&#44; the sons of <persName>Jacob</persName> thy servant&#44; whom<lb/> Thou didst choose to be unto Thee a people and a pecu&#45;<lb/>liar treasure.  From amidst bondage&#44; from galling<lb/> slavery&#44; Thou didst ransom their bodies by a mighty<lb/> deliverance and unthought of wonders&#59; and at a time<lb/> when thy service was unknown to nearly the whole<lb/> race of man&#44; Thou didst proclaim unto them thy law&#44;<lb/> and make them feel that in Thee&#44; the all&#45;wise&#44; the all&#45;<lb/>powerful&#44; omnipresent&#44; omniscient One&#44; they should<lb/> acknowledge their divine Ruler and King&#33;  Are we<lb/> then not blessed&#63; is not our lot cast in delightful parts&#63;<lb/> &#8212;Yet have we often murmured&#44; felt as it were thy<lb/> yoke too heavy a burden for our obdurate necks to bear&#33;</p>

				<p>We went after strange gods&#44; and sought the sinful plea&#45;<lb/>sures which thy laws prohibit.  And therefore came<lb/> upon us the many evils which we endure this day&#44;<lb/> therefore lies now heavy upon us the burden of our sins.<lb/>  But Thou&#44; O Lord&#44; art mighty to save and ready to for&#45;<lb/>give&#33; and even according to thy unending mercies do<lb/> Thou deal with us&#59; and if we have sinned greatly&#44; let<lb/> thy abundant kindness throw the veil of oblivion over<lb/> our transgression&#59; and when Thou purifiest us in thy<lb/> judgment&#44; which is ever holy&#44; ever merciful&#44; ever spar&#45;<lb/>ing of the repentant&#58; then guard us by thy might&#44; that<lb/> we be not cut off utterly&#59; so that we may ever remain<lb/> on earth&#44; to make known in all future generations thy<lb/> power&#44; thy glory&#44; thy truth&#44; thy unity unto all those<lb/> who know Thee not&#44; who worship Thee not alone and<lb/> in truth as do thy children <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; whom Thou didst<lb/> release from <persName>Pharaoh&#39;s</persName> bondage.

				<p>In our intercourse with the gentiles around us it is<lb/> of frequent occurrence that we hear them speak after<lb/> this manner&#58; &#8220;We believe that once you were the<lb/> chosen people of God&#44; and that through you and the<lb/> prophets who arose from among you there came salva&#45;<lb/>tion to mankind&#59; but this state of blessedness is now no<lb/> longer yours&#58; you have been rejected for your rebellion&#44;<lb/> and your long captivity proves that you are no longer<lb/> the chosen people&#59; you are therefore in darkness in</p>

				<p>your perseverance to abide by the Mosaic dispensation&#44;<lb/> which has been set aside for one purer&#44; more spiritual&#44;<lb/> more in consonance with divine mercy.&#8221;  An unin&#45;<lb/>formed&#44; disinterested stranger&#44; to whom both the Naza&#45;<lb/>rene creed and our belief were utterly unknown&#44; hearing<lb/> the position above stated so triumphantly assumed by<lb/> such an immense majority of our neighbours&#44; would<lb/> hardly hesitate to give us wrong for our opposition&#44;<lb/> unless we could give very strong counter&#45;arguments to<lb/> the assertion offered as an undoubted fact and admitting<lb/> of no contradiction.  Indeed the Nazarenes treat the<lb/> question as a settled point&#44; and in their argument with us<lb/> express the utmost astonishment that we can even dare<lb/> to hesitate acknowledging our errors and the weakness<lb/> of our hopes&#44; as they arrogantly affect to call our firm<lb/> adherence to the One God&#44; and our unshaken confi&#45;<lb/>dence in the <sic>fulfilment</sic> of his promises.  If denunciation<lb/> is proof&#44; and assertion sound argument&#44; then indeed are<lb/> we conquered&#59; but if Scriptures are to be appealed to&#44;<lb/> if history is to be consulted&#44; then can we triumphantly<lb/> defend our cause&#44; and convince even the stranger who<lb/> has never heard of the word of our God&#44; and the doc&#45;<lb/>trines which some preach erroneously in his blessed<lb/> Name.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Let us take a brief view of the different parts of the<lb/> idea above thrown out&#44; which&#44; permit me to remark&#44;<lb/> contains the essence of all that is ever brought forward<lb/> to convince the Jew of his alleged error&#59; and if it fail<lb/> of enforcing conviction&#44; the whole argument of the<lb/> Nazarene at once falls to the ground&#44; as far at least as<lb/> the Israelite is concerned.  I will also state at once that<lb/> the discussion is not entered into&#44; because I deem that</p>

				<p>our adults require such aid as it is in my power to<lb/> afford&#44; but to give them means under the blessing of<lb/> our Supreme Father to inculcate the same faith they<lb/> have received in the minds of their children&#44; and to<lb/> place the hopes of these on so firm a footing that they<lb/> cannot be shaken by the specious arguments of the<lb/> gentiles&#44; or be misled by the pernicious examples of<lb/> those who forsake our communion from alleged convic&#45;<lb/>tion of the truth of another belief&#44; or from a criminal<lb/> indifference to the word and will of the Lord.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">To commence&#58; it is fortunate for the world no less<lb/> than for <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; that all believers in a divine revelation<lb/> of whatever sect and creed admit as a prerequisite<lb/> the divine legation of the father of the prophets&#44; and that<lb/> he was deputed to deliver his co&#45;Israelites from bon&#45;<lb/>dage&#59; for the admission of these facts places us at once<lb/> on a firm rock&#44; from which we may start in commen&#45;<lb/>cing to trace to their source the nature and effect of the<lb/> Law of God.  For if <persName>Moses</persName> was divinely inspired to go<lb/> forward to demand of <persName>Pharaoh</persName> the liberation of a cap&#45;<lb/>tive people&#44; and if he was armed by supernatural ter&#45;<lb/>rors to effect this noble purpose&#58; it follows that he was<lb/> faithful and upright&#44; and that whatever he effected in<lb/> the process of this mission must bear the stamp of<lb/> divine approbation&#44; or else he would have at the same<lb/> time been a messenger of God&#44; and displeasing to this<lb/> great Being by his non&#45;conformity to the will of his<lb/> Sender.  Secondly&#44; seeing that this mission was in<lb/> behalf of a certain people&#44; and for no other&#44; so far as<lb/> our knowledge extends&#44; we are naturally led to inquire&#44;<lb/> &#8220;Why was this so&#63;  Was it merely to humble the<lb/> tyrant of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>&#44; to assert the cause of universal liberty</p>

				<p>and equality&#44; or had the whole proceeding another and<lb/> a deeper source&#63;&#8221;  If the former&#44; then there were in<lb/> olden days&#44; and there are in our own times&#44; communi&#45;<lb/>ties of slaves equally oppressed as were our fore&#45;<lb/>fathers&#44; and&#44; being children of one great Father&#44; no less<lb/> the objects of Providence and Justice than were the<lb/> Israelites in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>&#59; and if even there be no tyrant to<lb/> doom to death the offspring of the slavish race&#58; there<lb/> are a thousand chains&#44; a thousand heartburnings&#44; a<lb/> thousand sufferings connected with a state of absolute<lb/> servitude&#44; which will not let the All&#45;Seeing pass them<lb/> by unnoticed.  And yet&#44; the Israelites alone of all<lb/> slave nations were redeemed.  The answer therefore to<lb/> our question is evident&#44; that the action of God through<lb/> his servant <persName>Moses</persName> had for its object another and a<lb/> higher view than the mere breaking of physical fetters&#59;<lb/> and this was&#44; as we have asserted on a previous occa&#45;<lb/>sion&#44; the disenthralling of the mind of man from the<lb/> bonds of superstition and unbelief&#44; and to fix a law of<lb/> truth and righteousness immovably in the hearts of<lb/> sinning mortals&#44; which law should never thenceforward<lb/> be banished from the memory and the affection of its<lb/> first possessors&#44; and that through their silent teaching&#44;<lb/> as a great spirit&#42; of our people calls it&#44; by their pre&#45;<lb/>sence on earth as the witnesses of God&#39;s truth&#44; they<lb/> should proclaim the truth and righteousness in their<lb/> hands to the utmost ends of the earth.&#8212;We have before<lb/> this&#8224; proved that this procedure on the part of God was<lb/> both wise and necessary&#59; and all we have now to do&#44; is</p>

				<p>merely to start from this point as established in the<lb/> farther pursuit of our inquiry.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">What now constitutes the existence of a nation&#63;<lb/>  Some will perhaps answer&#44; the possession of a common<lb/> country and the obedience to one government&#44; or at<lb/> least an association of governments obeying one com&#45;<lb/>mon head.  Another may answer&#44; to constitute a nation<lb/> the individuals must be descended from one common<lb/> origin&#44; and have a uniformity of language and customs.<lb/>  To a certain extent these definitions are correct&#59; and if<lb/> peradventure of any of these characteristics are wanting at<lb/> the first formation of a commonwealth&#44; the progress of<lb/> time and the changes attendant on a propinquity of<lb/> races will in an incredibly short period assimilate the<lb/> different parts of a state in features&#44; manners and habits&#44;<lb/> &#40;unless there be disturbing causes&#44; arising from climate<lb/> and an entire diversity of pursuits&#44;&#41; which will render<lb/> those persons who united to form a state&#44; though very<lb/> diverse themselves&#44; the parents of a uniform and homo&#45;<lb/>geneous race of descendants.  It is needless to quote<lb/> examples&#44; since the inquiry pursued in its ramifications<lb/> would carry us too far from our subject.  If then these<lb/> points were the sole requisites to form a nation&#44; the<lb/> words spoken by the Lord through <persName>Jeremiah</persName> would not<lb/> have been fulfilled.

Their country is desolate and<lb/> possessed by aliens to their blood&#44; and their kings have<lb/> long since ceased to rule&#44; and their judges have for ages<lb/> not sat in the seat of judgment.

Without gain&#45;<lb/>saying in the least the truth of this assertion&#44; since we<lb/> are not disposed to deny to any human being the hope<lb/> of salvation in the Lord&#44; by the pursuit of the right so<lb/> far as this is known to him&#58; we cannot assent to the<lb/> deduction&#44; which the gentiles make&#44; that their admission<lb/> to grace has caused our rejection.  First&#44; because the<lb/> gentiles never were excluded from divine mercy&#44; from<lb/> the calling of <persName>Abraham</persName> down to this hour.  Many no<lb/> doubt forfeited everlasting bliss by their manifold trans&#45;<lb/>gressions against the light they had received&#44; and in<lb/> contravention to the truths which had been made known<lb/> to mankind from the beginning&#59; but this does not say<lb/> that there was any inherent defect in the spirit of the<lb/> gentile from enjoying the rewards to which his virtues&#44;<lb/> be they many or few&#44; might have entitled him from the<lb/> impartial Judge of all flesh.  The law&#44; we admit&#44; was<lb/> given to be the road of salvation to <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; in the first<lb/> instance&#44; and to become the beacon to the other nations<lb/> of the earth thereafter&#59; but this was intended solely to<lb/> bind our people to the strict observance of its letter and<lb/> spirit&#44; and not to condemn to eternal sorrows those who<lb/> had never been informed of its nature and tenets.

The thirsty man cannot complain of the effect<lb/> of water not slaking his thirst if he refuses to drink.&#8221;<lb/>  Let us now inquire&#44; what have we rejected&#63;  Have we<lb/> rejected the law&#63;  Do we as a people refuse studying or<lb/> obeying the commandments&#63;&#8212;Assuredly not&#59; we must<lb/> with faces covered with the blush of shame confess that<lb/> we have sinned as our fathers have done before us&#59; but<lb/> never can it be said&#44; that we have rejected the law.  If<lb/> then our transgressions during the ages of the prophets<lb/> were punished with mild though condign punishment&#44;<lb/> &#40;for every thing is mild compared to entire condemna&#45;<lb/>tion&#44;&#41; as a retributive measure for the infraction of the<lb/> covenant of God with <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#58; it is wonderful indeed<lb/> that any thing could have occurred more heinous&#44; more<lb/> subversive of our duties as a people and individuals than<lb/> the general idolatry at one time so prevalent for a space<lb/> of several centuries.

Now hear what the prophet says in<lb/> continuation &#40;verses 43&#45;45&#41;&#58; &#8220;The land also shall be<lb/> left &#40;desolate&#41; of them&#44; and shall enjoy her <date>Sabbaths</date><lb/> while she lies desolate without them&#44; and they shall<lb/> accept of the punishment of their iniquity&#58; because&#44;<lb/> even because they despised my judgments&#44; and my<lb/> statutes their souls abhorred.  And yet for all that&#44;<lb/> when they are in the land of their enemies&#44; I will not<lb/> cast them away&#44; neither will I abhor them&#44; to destroy<lb/> them utterly&#44; and to break my covenant with them&#44; for<lb/> I am the Lord their God.  But I will remember unto<lb/> them the covenant of their ancestors&#44; whom I brought<lb/> forth from the land of <placeName>Egypt</placeName> in the sight of the heathen&#44;<lb/> that I might be their God&#59; I am the Lord.&#8221;  The sin&#44;<lb/> the punishment&#44; and the mercy are all here recited&#59; and<lb/> still the promise of an everlasting covenant is held out.<lb/>  And for what was the punishment denounced&#63;  For a<lb/> disregard of the statutes and judgments of the law&#59;<lb/> which would imply&#44; that there will follow favour and<lb/> mercy if the Israelites were to obey these statutes and<lb/> judgments.  Not to speak of the blissful promise that<lb/> our greatest sinning would not cause utter rejection&#58;<lb/>  we will confine ourselves to the consideration of the<lb/> unjewish doctrine that obedience to the law should not<lb/> be able to insure salvation&#44; unless something else were<lb/> to be superadded.  Let us inquire of our opponents&#44;<lb/> what that something is&#63;  They will&#44; as you all know&#44;<lb/> tell us&#44; it is the belief in a mediator&#44; who is to atone for<lb/> our sins&#44; since no man is righteous under the law&#44; and<lb/> he requires a purification and a sacrificing process<lb/> beyond what his own deeds can attain&#59; and since we<lb/> in former times rejected the mediator&#44; when he is said</p>

				<p>to have appeared&#44; and as professing Jews yet continue<lb/> to reject him&#44; they will make us believe that we are by<lb/> this unbelief condemned to the abhorrence of the Lord&#44;<lb/> even to utter spiritual condemnation&#44; both nationally and<lb/> individually.  Before we go to argue the question upon<lb/> its remote merits&#44; such as consistency with divine good&#45;<lb/>ness and mercy&#44; we will bring it down to the standard<lb/> of Scripture&#59; and we will ask&#44; with all due deference to<lb/> the many learned and pious professing Nazarenes&#44; to<lb/> point out to us a single passage in the whole five books<lb/> of <persName>Moses</persName> which even remotely teaches the doctrine of a<lb/> mediator&#44; or which hints that any other atonement is<lb/> needed than a man&#39;s own acts&#44; done in obedience to and<lb/> in reliance upon divine wisdom and mercy.  It will not<lb/> do to assert that this doctrine is taught by inference and<lb/> obscure allusions&#59; for in a matter concerning our final<lb/> beatitude or condemnation the merciful Father of all<lb/> creatures would not leave doubt or obscurity to perplex<lb/> us in our course through life.  We have plain and<lb/> ample directions for our belief in One God&#44; the Author<lb/> and Preserver of all things&#59; we have express injunc&#45;<lb/>tions regarding our own course of life as children of<lb/> God&#44; as descendants from human parentage&#44; and as<lb/>  members of a community of beings like ourselves&#44; nay&#44;<lb/> in many instances regarding our conduct towards the<lb/> brute creation&#59; and is it to be believed that&#44; if our salva&#45;<lb/>tion depended upon a belief in a mediator&#44; this idea<lb/> would not have been clearly and distinctly laid down in<lb/> the ten commandments along with the injunction to<lb/> acknowledge the Creator&#63;&#8212;Moreover&#44; what Israelite&#44;<lb/> from the mission of <persName>Moses</persName> to the destruction of the<lb/> second temple&#44; ever believed in an adjunct deity&#63; and&#44;</p>

				<p>consequently&#44; if such a belief were necessary to salva&#45;<lb/>tion&#44; no one of all the Bible personages could have been<lb/> saved&#44; no matter what might have been his piety or the<lb/> favour with which he was regarded by his Maker.&#8212;But<lb/> what does this mean&#63;  Nothing else than that the Lord<lb/> had given a law which&#44; while in appearance it was a<lb/> means of salvation&#44; failed in its effect&#44; since there was<lb/> another requisite which it does not enjoin&#44; yet without<lb/> which all obedience is in vain.  Is this reasonable&#63; can<lb/> the Lord be so unjust&#44; so cruel towards those He alleges<lb/> to love&#63;  Moreover&#44; this view would be disconsonant<lb/> with Scriptures&#44; since in many passages we read to the<lb/> following effect&#58; &#8220;Ye shall therefore keep my statutes<lb/> and my judgments&#44; which if a man do&#44; he shall live in<lb/> them&#58; I am the Lord.&#8221; &#40;Lev. Xviii. 5.&#41; &#8220;And when<lb/> <persName>Moses</persName> had made an end of speaking all these words to<lb/> all <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#58; he said unto them&#44; Set your hearts unto all<lb/> the words which I testify among you this day&#44; that you<lb/> shall command them your children to observe to do all<lb/> the words of this law.  For it is not a vain thing for<lb/> you&#44; because it is your life&#59; and through this thing ye<lb/> shall prolong your days in the land&#44; whither ye go over<lb/> <placeName>Jordan</placeName> to possess it.&#8221; &#40;Deut. xxxii. 45&#45;47&#41;  With<lb/> these extracts the proofs are not exhausted&#59; but enough<lb/> for the present to establish the biblical doctrine that no<lb/> mediator is required to obtain for us salvation&#59; on the<lb/> contrary we are taught that the law&#44; to insure life&#44; is<lb/> neither in heaven nor beyond sea&#44; so that a mediator or<lb/> messenger need be sent to fetch it&#44; but in our mouths<lb/> and our hearts&#44; that we may do it.  We repeat there&#45;<lb/>fore the question&#44; how can the Jews have been rejected<lb/> from divine grace&#44; so that whilst adhering firmly to the</p>
