            <p>O God of <persName>Abraham</persName>, <persName>Isaac</persName>, and
                    <persName>Jacob</persName>, our fathers!<lb/> how glorious is thy name in all
                the earth. From gene-<lb/>ration to generation Thou art God, and beside Thee<lb/>
                there is no saviour and redeemer. How blessed are<lb/> they therefore who trust in
                Thee! how happy those to<lb/> whom Thou art God! And ever thus were blessed thy<lb/>

                didst choose to be unto Thee a people and a pecu-<lb/>liar treasure. From amidst
                bondage, from galling<lb/> slavery, Thou didst ransom their bodies by a mighty<lb/>
                deliverance and unthought of wonders; and at a time<lb/> when thy service was
                unknown to nearly the whole<lb/> race of man, Thou didst proclaim unto them thy
                law,<lb/> and make them feel that in Thee, the all-wise, the all-<lb/>powerful,
                omnipresent, omniscient One, they should<lb/> acknowledge their divine Ruler and
                King! Are we<lb/> then not blessed? is not our lot cast in delightful parts?<lb/>
                —Yet have we often murmured, felt as it were thy<lb/> yoke too heavy a burden for

            <p>We went after strange gods, and sought the sinful plea-<lb/>sures which thy laws
                prohibit. And therefore came<lb/> upon us the many evils which we endure this

                thy abundant kindness throw the veil of oblivion over<lb/> our transgression; and

            <p>In our intercourse with the gentiles around us it is<lb/> of frequent occurrence that
                we hear them speak after<lb/> this manner: “We believe that once you were the<lb/>
                chosen people of God, and that through you and the<lb/> prophets who arose from
                among you there came salva-<lb/>tion to mankind; but this state of blessedness is
                now no<lb/> longer yours: you have been rejected for your rebellion,<lb/> and your
                long captivity proves that you are no longer<lb/> the chosen people; you are

            <p rend="align(center)">THE HOPE OF <placeName>ISRAEL</placeName>.</p>
            <p>your perseverance to abide by the Mosaic dispensation,<lb/> which has been set aside
                for one purer, more spiritual,<lb/> more in consonance with divine mercy.” An
                unin-<lb/>formed, disinterested stranger, to whom both the Naza-<lb/>rene creed and
                our belief were utterly unknown, hearing<lb/> the position above stated so
                triumphantly assumed by<lb/> such an immense majority of our neighbours, would<lb/>
                hardly hesitate to give us wrong for our opposition,<lb/> unless we could give very
                strong counter-arguments to<lb/> the assertion offered as an undoubted fact and
                admitting<lb/> of no contradiction. Indeed the Nazarenes treat the<lb/> question as
                a settled point, and in their argument with us<lb/> express the utmost astonishment
                that we can even dare<lb/> to hesitate acknowledging our errors and the
                weakness<lb/> of our hopes, as they arrogantly affect to call our firm<lb/>
                adherence to the One God, and our unshaken confi-<lb/>dence in the
                    <sic>fulfilment</sic> of his promises. If denunciation<lb/> is proof, and
                assertion sound argument, then indeed are<lb/> we conquered; but if Scriptures are
                to be appealed to,<lb/> if history is to be consulted, then can we triumphantly<lb/>
                defend our cause, and convince even the stranger who<lb/> has never heard of the
                word of our God, and the doc-<lb/>trines which some preach erroneously in his
                blessed<lb/> Name.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Let us take a brief view of the different parts of the<lb/> idea
                above thrown out, which, permit me to remark,<lb/> contains the essence of all that
                is ever brought forward<lb/> to convince the Jew of his alleged error; and if it
                fail<lb/> of enforcing conviction, the whole argument of the<lb/> Nazarene at once
                falls to the ground, as far at least as<lb/> the Israelite is concerned. I will also
                state at once that<lb/> the discussion is not entered into, because I deem that</p>

            <p>our adults require such aid as it is in my power to<lb/> afford, but to give them
                means under the blessing of<lb/> our Supreme Father to inculcate the same faith
                they<lb/> have received in the minds of their children, and to<lb/> place the hopes
                of these on so firm a footing that they<lb/> cannot be shaken by the specious
                arguments of the<lb/> gentiles, or be misled by the pernicious examples of<lb/>
                those who forsake our communion from alleged convic-<lb/>tion of the truth of
                another belief, or from a criminal<lb/> indifference to the word and will of the
                Lord.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">To commence: it is fortunate for the world no less<lb/> than for
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>, that all believers in a divine revelation<lb/> of
                whatever sect and creed admit as a prerequisite<lb/> the divine legation of the
                father of the prophets, and that<lb/> he was deputed to deliver his co-Israelites
                from bon-<lb/>dage; for the admission of these facts places us at once<lb/> on a
                firm rock, from which we may start in commen-<lb/>cing to trace to their source the
                nature and effect of the<lb/> Law of God. For if <persName>Moses</persName> was
                divinely inspired to go<lb/> forward to demand of <persName>Pharaoh</persName> the
                liberation of a cap-<lb/>tive people, and if he was armed by supernatural
                ter-<lb/>rors to effect this noble purpose: it follows that he was<lb/> faithful and
                upright, and that whatever he effected in<lb/> the process of this mission must bear
                the stamp of<lb/> divine approbation, or else he would have at the same<lb/> time
                been a messenger of God, and displeasing to this<lb/> great Being by his
                non-conformity to the will of his<lb/> Sender. Secondly, seeing that this mission
                was in<lb/> behalf of a certain people, and for no other, so far as<lb/> our
                knowledge extends, we are naturally led to inquire,<lb/> “Why was this so? Was it
                merely to humble the<lb/> tyrant of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, to assert the
                cause of universal liberty</p>

            <p rend="align(center)">THE HOPE OF <placeName>ISRAEL</placeName>. </p>
            <p>and equality, or had the whole proceeding another and<lb/> a deeper source?” If the
                former, then there were in<lb/> olden days, and there are in our own times,
                communi-<lb/>ties of slaves equally oppressed as were our fore-<lb/>fathers, and,
                being children of one great Father, no less<lb/> the objects of Providence and
                Justice than were the<lb/> Israelites in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>; and if even
                there be no tyrant to<lb/> doom to death the offspring of the slavish race:
                there<lb/> are a thousand chains, a thousand heartburnings, a<lb/> thousand
                sufferings connected with a state of absolute<lb/> servitude, which will not let the
                All-Seeing pass them<lb/> by unnoticed. And yet, the Israelites alone of all<lb/>
                slave nations were redeemed. The answer therefore to<lb/> our question is evident,
                that the action of God through<lb/> his servant <persName>Moses</persName> had for
                its object another and a<lb/> higher view than the mere breaking of physical
                fetters;<lb/> and this was, as we have asserted on a previous occa-<lb/>sion, the
                disenthralling of the mind of man from the<lb/> bonds of superstition and unbelief,
                and to fix a law of<lb/> truth and righteousness immovably in the hearts of<lb/>
                sinning mortals, which law should never thenceforward<lb/> be banished from the
                memory and the affection of its<lb/> first possessors, and that through their silent
                teaching,<lb/> as a great spirit* of our people calls it, by their pre-<lb/>sence on
                earth as the witnesses of God's truth, they<lb/> should proclaim the truth and
                righteousness in their<lb/> hands to the utmost ends of the earth.—We have
                before<lb/> this† proved that this procedure on the part of God was<lb/> both wise
                and necessary; and all we have now to do, is</p>

            <p>merely to start from this point as established in the<lb/> farther pursuit of our
                inquiry.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">What now constitutes the existence of a nation?<lb/> Some will
                perhaps answer, the possession of a common<lb/> country and the obedience to one
                government, or at<lb/> least an association of governments obeying one com-<lb/>mon
                head. Another may answer, to constitute a nation<lb/> the individuals must be
                descended from one common<lb/> origin, and have a uniformity of language and
                customs.<lb/> To a certain extent these definitions are correct; and if<lb/>
                peradventure of any of these characteristics are wanting at<lb/> the first formation
                of a commonwealth, the progress of<lb/> time and the changes attendant on a
                propinquity of<lb/> races will in an incredibly short period assimilate the<lb/>
                different parts of a state in features, manners and habits,<lb/> (unless there be
                disturbing causes, arising from climate<lb/> and an entire diversity of pursuits,)
                which will render<lb/> those persons who united to form a state, though very<lb/>
                diverse themselves, the parents of a uniform and homo-<lb/>geneous race of
                descendants. It is needless to quote<lb/> examples, since the inquiry pursued in its
                ramifications<lb/> would carry us too far from our subject. If then these<lb/>
                points were the sole requisites to form a nation, the<lb/> words spoken by the Lord
                through <persName>Jeremiah</persName> would not<lb/> have been fulfilled. For thus

                been! but now—his children are scattered over<lb/> every land, wanderers in every
                clime—oppressed by<lb/> some, despised by many, and loved by none; and they<lb/>
                obey laws which their wise men and their ancients do<lb/> not <sic>recognise</sic>
                as those laws and those ordinances found-<lb/>ed on the law of

            <p rend="indent(1)">In truth the Nazarenes confess this to be the fact, by<lb/> saying
                that salvation came through <placeName>Israel</placeName>, by which<lb/> they can
                only mean, that through the promulgation of<lb/> the law to our ancestors, in the
                first instance, the know-<lb/>ledge of the way of salvation was at length carried
                to<lb/> the gentiles, who are now enjoying the light of religion<lb/> which was
                formerly exclusively ours. Without gain-<lb/>saying in the least the truth of this
                assertion, since we<lb/> are not disposed to deny to any human being the hope<lb/>
                of salvation in the Lord, by the pursuit of the right so<lb/> far as this is known
                to him: we cannot assent to the<lb/> deduction, which the gentiles make, that their
                admission<lb/> to grace has caused our rejection. First, because the<lb/> gentiles
                never were excluded from divine mercy, from<lb/> the calling of
                    <persName>Abraham</persName> down to this hour. Many no<lb/> doubt forfeited
                everlasting bliss by their manifold trans-<lb/>gressions against the light they had
                received, and in<lb/> contravention to the truths which had been made known<lb/> to
                mankind from the beginning; but this does not say<lb/> that there was any inherent
                defect in the spirit of the<lb/> gentile from enjoying the rewards to which his
                virtues,<lb/> be they many or few, might have entitled him from the<lb/> impartial
                Judge of all flesh. The law, we admit, was<lb/> given to be the road of salvation to
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>, in the first<lb/> instance, and to become the
                beacon to the other nations<lb/> of the earth thereafter; but this was intended
                solely to<lb/> bind our people to the strict observance of its letter and<lb/>
                spirit, and not to condemn to eternal sorrows those who<lb/> had never been informed

                by certain though slow<lb/> degrees, the empire of sin and evil; yet He never<lb/>

                ignorance in which they were<lb/> nowise to blame, had not learned to fear his great
                and<lb/> adorable name. Secondly, even granting, for argu-<lb/>ment's sake, that

                wisdom so short-sighted, that<lb/> his laws are insufficient to speak to every
                soul—to<lb/> subdue every heart to fear and to love Him?—Not so<lb/> are we
                permitted to set limits to his bounty and benevo-<lb/>lence; and if man can
                occasionally forgive his enemies<lb/> and pray for those who have grievously
                transgressed<lb/> against him: will you deny the All-good, the Pos-<lb/>sessor of
                all perfection, the power, the capacity, the<lb/> disposition, the will to be good
                to all? Is this your<lb/> conception of your Maker's greatness, by giving Him<lb/>
                less perfection than is possessed by a mortal creature?<lb/>—No! no! brethren; God's
                love is ample for all; his<lb/> wings are sufficiently extended that all may seek
                shel-<lb/>ter under their shadow; his forgiveness is not exhausted<lb/> even if
                every creature were forgiven and enjoying ever-<lb/>lasting happiness; and whilst we

            <p rend="indent(1)">“But,” say the advocates of our rejection, “it is not<lb/> because
                God is not able to save, only because you<lb/> refused and still refuse the
                salvation which was offered<lb/> to you. The thirsty man cannot complain of the
                effect<lb/> of water not slaking his thirst if he refuses to drink.”<lb/> Let us now
                inquire, what have we rejected? Have we<lb/> rejected the law? Do we as a people
                refuse studying or<lb/> obeying the commandments?—Assuredly not; we must<lb/> with
                faces covered with the blush of shame confess that<lb/> we have sinned as our
                fathers have done before us; but<lb/> never can it be said, that we have rejected
                the law. If<lb/> then our transgressions during the ages of the prophets<lb/> were
                punished with mild though condign punishment,<lb/> (for every thing is mild compared
                to entire condemna-<lb/>tion,) as a retributive measure for the infraction of
                the<lb/> covenant of God with <placeName>Israel</placeName>: it is wonderful
                indeed<lb/> that any thing could have occurred more heinous, more<lb/> subversive of
                our duties as a people and individuals than<lb/> the general idolatry at one time so
                prevalent for a space<lb/> of several centuries. Now we read in the awful
                denun-<lb/>ciation of <persName>Moses</persName> in the twenty-sixth chapter of
                Leviticus,<lb/> that the spirit of prophecy anticipated such a state of<lb/>
                rebellion; for he says (verse 30): “And I will destroy<lb/> your high places, and
                cut down your images, and cast<lb/> your <sic>carcases</sic> upon the
                    <sic>carcases</sic> of your idols, and my<lb/> soul shall abhor you;” thus
                evidently indicating that<lb/> the direful rebellion of forgetfulness of God should
                be<lb/> followed by signal punishment of the sinners and the<lb/> downfall of the
                idols they should worship, and God is<lb/> represented as saying that his soul would

            <p>daring rebels. Now hear what the prophet says in<lb/> continuation (verses 43-45):
                “The land also shall be<lb/> left (desolate) of them, and shall enjoy her
                    <date>Sabbaths</date><lb/> while she lies desolate without them, and they
                shall<lb/> accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because,<lb/> even because
                they despised my judgments, and my<lb/> statutes their souls abhorred. And yet for
                all that,<lb/> when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not<lb/> cast them
                away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy<lb/> them utterly, and to break my
                covenant with them, for<lb/> I am the Lord their God. But I will remember unto<lb/>
                them the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought<lb/> forth from the land of
                    <placeName>Egypt</placeName> in the sight of the heathen,<lb/> that I might be
                their God; I am the Lord.” The sin,<lb/> the punishment, and the mercy are all here
                recited; and<lb/> still the promise of an everlasting covenant is held out.<lb/> And
                for what was the punishment denounced? For a<lb/> disregard of the statutes and
                judgments of the law;<lb/> which would imply, that there will follow favour and<lb/>
                mercy if the Israelites were to obey these statutes and<lb/> judgments. Not to speak
                of the blissful promise that<lb/> our greatest sinning would not cause utter
                rejection:<lb/> we will confine ourselves to the consideration of the<lb/> unjewish
                doctrine that obedience to the law should not<lb/> be able to insure salvation,
                unless something else were<lb/> to be superadded. Let us inquire of our
                opponents,<lb/> what that something is? They will, as you all know,<lb/> tell us, it
                is the belief in a mediator, who is to atone for<lb/> our sins, since no man is
                righteous under the law, and<lb/> he requires a purification and a sacrificing
                process<lb/> beyond what his own deeds can attain; and since we<lb/> in former times
                rejected the mediator, when he is said</p>

            <p>to have appeared, and as professing Jews yet continue<lb/> to reject him, they will
                make us believe that we are by<lb/> this unbelief condemned to the abhorrence of the
                Lord,<lb/> even to utter spiritual condemnation, both nationally and<lb/>
                individually. Before we go to argue the question upon<lb/> its remote merits, such
                as consistency with divine good-<lb/>ness and mercy, we will bring it down to the
                standard<lb/> of Scripture; and we will ask, with all due deference to<lb/> the many
                learned and pious professing Nazarenes, to<lb/> point out to us a single passage in
                the whole five books<lb/> of <persName>Moses</persName> which even remotely teaches
                the doctrine of a<lb/> mediator, or which hints that any other atonement is<lb/>
                needed than a man's own acts, done in obedience to and<lb/> in reliance upon divine
                wisdom and mercy. It will not<lb/> do to assert that this doctrine is taught by
                inference and<lb/> obscure allusions; for in a matter concerning our final<lb/>
                beatitude or condemnation the merciful Father of all<lb/> creatures would not leave
                doubt or obscurity to perplex<lb/> us in our course through life. We have plain
                and<lb/> ample directions for our belief in One God, the Author<lb/> and Preserver
                of all things; we have express injunc-<lb/>tions regarding our own course of life as
                children of<lb/> God, as descendants from human parentage, and as<lb/> members of a
                community of beings like ourselves, nay,<lb/> in many instances regarding our
                conduct towards the<lb/> brute creation; and is it to be believed that, if our
                salva-<lb/>tion depended upon a belief in a mediator, this idea<lb/> would not have
                been clearly and distinctly laid down in<lb/> the ten commandments along with the
                injunction to<lb/> acknowledge the Creator?—Moreover, what Israelite,<lb/> from the
                mission of <persName>Moses</persName> to the destruction of the<lb/> second temple,
                ever believed in an adjunct deity? and,</p>

            <p rend="align(center)">THE HOPE OF <placeName>ISRAEL</placeName>.</p>
            <p>consequently, if such a belief were necessary to salva-<lb/>tion, no one of all the
                Bible personages could have been<lb/> saved, no matter what might have been his
                piety or the<lb/> favour with which he was regarded by his Maker.—But<lb/> what does
                this mean? Nothing else than that the Lord<lb/> had given a law which, while in
                appearance it was a<lb/> means of salvation, failed in its effect, since there
                was<lb/> another requisite which it does not enjoin, yet without<lb/> which all
                obedience is in vain. Is this reasonable? can<lb/> the Lord be so unjust, so cruel
                towards those He alleges<lb/> to love? Moreover, this view would be
                disconsonant<lb/> with Scriptures, since in many passages we read to the<lb/>
                following effect: “Ye shall therefore keep my statutes<lb/> and my judgments, which
                if a man do, he shall live in<lb/> them: I am the Lord.” (Lev. Xviii. 5.) “And when<lb/>
                <persName>Moses</persName> had made an end of speaking all these words to<lb/> all
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>: he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all<lb/>
                the words which I testify among you this day, that you<lb/> shall command them your
                children to observe to do all<lb/> the words of this law. For it is not a vain thing
                for<lb/> you, because it is your life; and through this thing ye<lb/> shall prolong
                your days in the land, whither ye go over<lb/>
                <placeName>Jordan</placeName> to possess it.” (Deut. xxxii. 45-47) With<lb/> these
                extracts the proofs are not exhausted; but enough<lb/> for the present to establish
                the biblical doctrine that no<lb/> mediator is required to obtain for us salvation;
                on the<lb/> contrary we are taught that the law, to insure life, is<lb/> neither in
                heaven nor beyond sea, so that a mediator or<lb/> messenger need be sent to fetch
                it, but in our mouths<lb/> and our hearts, that we may do it. We repeat
                there-<lb/>fore the question, how can the Jews have been rejected<lb/> from divine
                grace, so that whilst adhering firmly to the</p>

            <p>law which was <sic>intrusted</sic> to them, they should earn<lb/> eternal
                condemnation simply because they do not admit<lb/> a doctrine which their Scriptures

            <p rend="indent(1)">In this point of the argument, it is possible we may be<lb/> met by
                the bold assertion of our antagonists, (I use this<lb/> word as referring only to a
                mere friendly difference,)<lb/> that granting the old dispensation of the law—so
                they<lb/> term our code—did not contain the doctrine of a sacri-<lb/>ficed mediator,
                a new and purer revelation, which unfet-<lb/>tered the world from the curse of
                bodily obedience, made<lb/> known a safer and easier method of sanctification,
                by<lb/> teaching the sinner not to regard himself or his deeds as<lb/> of any avail,
                but to throw himself upon the merits of<lb/> one who had assumed both the curse of
                the condemna-<lb/>tion under the law pronounced against <persName>Adam</persName>,
                and re-<lb/>moved the disqualification attendant thereon by his<lb/> voluntary death
                in expiation of original sin.—I state<lb/> the substance of the doctrine in its
                strongest bearings.<lb/> Indeed, if this view were scriptural, then might
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName><lb/> tremble, for by having rejected both the
                person and the<lb/> assistance of the alleged great personage whom the<lb/>
                Nazarenes call their messiah, or mediator, or by what<lb/> other name he may be
                known, they would of necessity<lb/> have rejected the only means of salvation. But,
                bre-<lb/>thren, there is, there can be no dispensation from the<lb/> Lord differing
                in aught, even one iota or one tittle, from<lb/> the law of
                    <persName>Moses</persName>! For what is God? is He a son of<lb/> man, that He
                should repent? be uncertain in his pur-<lb/>poses? wavering in his will? Did He give
                a law to<lb/>
                <persName>Moses</persName>, declare it to be eternal, and yet limit its
                dura-<lb/>tion to less than two thousand years, when a thousand<lb/> years are in

            <p>a watch in the night? Can this be the God who spoke<lb/> thus through his servant:
                “And know therefore this<lb/> day, and reflect in thy heart, that the Lord is the

                (Deut. iv. 39)? Ay, “THERE IS NONE<lb/> ELSE!” these are the words, the consolatory
                assurance<lb/> of the Most High himself. What do they mean, but<lb/> that beside the
                Lord, <hi rend="italics">the</hi> God of <placeName>Israel</placeName>, there is
                no<lb/> being to share his power, his glory, his saving mercy?<lb/> Upon whom then
                does the law bid us to rely for salva-<lb/>tion? The same Power who announced
                himself to<lb/>
                <persName>Moses</persName>, when the prophet asked what name he was to<lb/> call his
                Sender when speaking to the Israelites, “I shall<lb/> be who I shall be;” and again,
                “I am the everlasting<lb/> One, the God of <persName>Abraham</persName> thy father,
                and the God of<lb/>
                <persName>Isaac</persName>,” as was told to <persName>Jacob</persName> when reposing
                in his pro-<lb/>phetic vision. And how was this everlasting, eternal<lb/> Being to
                be viewed? Here again the Scriptures come<lb/> to our aid: “Hear, O
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>! the Lord our God, the<lb/> Lord is one,” one,
                sole, omnipotent, working all, creat-<lb/>ing all, ruling all, and saving all. Is
                there a possibility<lb/> of an adjunct, an associate, an assistant, a being
                between<lb/> God and man? Again the law speaks in farther con-<lb/>firmation; the
                prophet in his last song, delivered proba-<lb/>bly on the day of his death, foretold
                the fearful effects of<lb/> the apostacy, which his mind's eye foresaw and
                greatly<lb/> dreaded; he introduces the Deity as speaking, denoun-<lb/>cing
                punishment for rebellion, and as then continuing:<lb/> “See now, that I, I alone am

            <p>ever.” (Deut. xxxii. 39, 40.) Do we need farther<lb/> proof? then let us once more
                refer to the unfailing<lb/> guide we have always at hand: “And the Lord will<lb/>
                scatter you among the nations, and you shall be left<lb/> few in number among the
                people whither the Lord will<lb/> lead you.—And if you will seek thence the Lord
                thy<lb/> God, thou wilt find <hi rend="italics">Him</hi>, if thou wilt seek Him with
                all<lb/> thy heart and with all thy soul.” (Deut. iv. 27, 29.)—<lb/> All these
                concurrent texts, scattered through the Penta-<lb/>teuch, explain one the other, and
                all reject as impossible<lb/> the idea of a sacrifice beyond the person of the
                sinner<lb/> himself; “I wound and I heal, and there is no one can<lb/> deliver from
                my hand;” where, we would ask, is an<lb/> exception? if the Lord, the everlasting He
                condemns,<lb/> if He wounds, who can absolve, who can heal? We<lb/> are promised
                deliverance by returning from our evil<lb/> ways; yet whom shall we seek? again,
                “the Lord our<lb/> God,” who announces himself as “One” and “living<lb/> for
                ever.”</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">But, say the Nazarenes, “Your law is but a type, a<lb/>
                foreshadowing of more glorious things that were to<lb/> follow.” Without at present
                discussing the truth or<lb/> otherwise of this singular position, we will merely
                con-<lb/>fine ourselves to a single remark. Admitting for a<lb/> moment the
                impossible and not to be thought of idea,<lb/> that the unchanging God had
                communicated a law<lb/> which in its nature was so imperfect that it required
                to<lb/> be changed: it would still solely apply to ordinances to<lb/> be done and
                prohibitions to be avoided, for these only<lb/> could by any chance be objects of
                repeal or change.<lb/> Yet how does this affect the truths of revelation? Can<lb/>
                the Lord repeal his own <sic>unchangeableness</sic>? can He</p>
            <pb n="20"/>
            <p>20</p>
            <p rend="align(center)">THE HOPE OF <placeName>ISRAEL</placeName>.</p>
            <p>cease to be one? can He at one time be the sole Sa-<lb/>viour, and require an adjunct
                at another? can He in<lb/> the least divest himself of one, nay, the smallest
                prero-<lb/>gative of universal royalty in favour of another? can,<lb/> in short, the
                holy, the everlasting, uniform, unchanging,<lb/> saving, redeeming God cease to be
                less than this in any<lb/> manner whatever? A truth is an idea which cannot be<lb/>
                otherwise, it embraces something which is so and not<lb/> otherwise by any change of
                circumstance, time or place.<lb/> Now if God at any one time, either past or
                present, nay<lb/> even future, embraced or should embrace any attribute<lb/>
                whatever, this same attribute must have been his from<lb/> the commencement, and
                cannot change to all eternity.<lb/> We therefore demand the proof: Where does the
                law<lb/> teach us to pray through a mediator, or rather does<lb/> not the law
                strenuously prohibit any such system of<lb/> idolatry? No proof can be exhibited,
                for there exists<lb/> none, that God meant to divest himself of a portion of<lb/>
                his power, admit it even as possible; and whilst the<lb/> law is silent, we cannot
                believe that another revelation<lb/> gainsaying it in so important a particular can
                be of<lb/> divine origin. Consequently the fears they would in-<lb/>fluence us with,
                who say that we are condemned, be-<lb/>cause we rejected the person and mission of
                their<lb/> mediator, are idle and groundless; for we are com-<lb/>manded over and
                again: “The Lord thy God thou<lb/> shalt fear, and Him thou shalt serve; to Him
                shalt<lb/> thou cleave, and by his name shalt thou swear!”<lb/> Yes, brethren! to
                Him we will cleave; come weal,<lb/> come wo—be the world friendly or frowning—be
                the<lb/> name of <placeName>Israel</placeName> loved or hated—be
                    <persName>Jacob's</persName> sons many<lb/> or few—they who fear the Lord, the

                with your wealth, your power, your matrimonial<lb/> alliances with your great
                families; they are unworthy<lb/> of its light who forsake the law which is ours; and
                only<lb/> with its extinction can the lamp of <persName>Jacob</persName> be
                quenched.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Again says the Nazarene, “If it be as you say, that<lb/> there is
                but one God and one law given by this God,<lb/> how is it that you, its followers,
                are so scattered, so long<lb/> oppressed, so long without priest or prophet, temple
                or<lb/> sacrifice? Is not your dispersion proof positive of your<lb/> rejection from
                grace? Is it not more than likely that<lb/> before many centuries have elapsed the
                names of <persName>Jacob</persName><lb/> and <placeName>Israel</placeName> will only
                belong to history as things that have<lb/> been?” But we answer: Had we never
                sinned, then<lb/> would dispersion never have been sent as a visitation<lb/> over
                us; but had we sinned and we been left flourishing<lb/> and at peace in our own
                land, whilst we defiled it with<lb/> our abominations: then would the word of God
                not have<lb/> been true. When we sinned, it was absolutely requi-<lb/>site that
                punishment should be meted out, and the pun-<lb/>ishment threatened was the

                that in the land of our ene-<lb/>mies the Lord's covenant would remain steadfast
                and<lb/> unmoved with us. Has this been so? We appeal to<lb/> history, to experience
                of every age and country, to con-<lb/>firm the well-foundedness of our trust and
                confidence.<lb/> Have ages of sorrow, of trial, of temptation passed over<lb/> us
                without consuming us? History answers, Yes; and<lb/> shall we then become
                fainthearted now, when we are at<lb/> peace? Shall we despair after so many
                centuries of<lb/> sorrow, fearful to confide in the Lord's promises? Many<lb/> may
                perhaps be weary of bearing the name which<lb/> marks them children of a hated,
                crushed and despised<lb/> people; but there are many—millions compared to<lb/>
                hundreds—who would embrace the burning stake, who<lb/> would welcome the blow of the
                bared sword, sooner<lb/> than swerve from the acknowledgment of the UNITY of<lb/>
                God which they have inherited from their fathers—<lb/> sooner than forsake the law
                which was proclaimed from<lb/> heaven by the omnipotent voice of the undying
                God!<lb/> Indifference to the commandments is no new thing<lb/> among us; it is this
                which has twice ruined our temple,<lb/> twice scattered the dwellers of
                    <placeName>Palestine</placeName> as slaves and<lb/> outcasts over all the earth;
                and yet every period of<lb/> forgetfulness was followed by one of love for the

                be<lb/> truth in the word of God—and if even many or all of<lb/> us pass away,

                have no priests nor temple, then is the Lord our refuge,<lb/> our sanctuary, and our

                wanting, and then will be fulfilled the words we<lb/> have quoted for our text, and
                which we will repeat as<lb/> a fit conclusion for our to-day's contemplation:

                    <persName>Jacob</persName> shall return, and shall rest, and shall<lb/> be at
                ease, and none shall make him afraid. Thou—<lb/> do thou not fear, my servant
                    <persName>Jacob</persName>, saith the Lord, for<lb/> I am with thee; for I will
                make a full end of all the<lb/> nations whither I have driven thee, but of thee I
                will<lb/> not make a full end; I will correct thee in judgment,<lb/> yet not suffer
