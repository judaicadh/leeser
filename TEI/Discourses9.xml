                purpose of doing honour to our Everlasting King&#44; and to la&#8211; bour in his
                name. It has always been the custom of Israel&#44; on all occasions of public

                deep humil&#8211; ity invoke the aid of our Father in heaven on the work which we
                are about to begin&#44; in order that lie may be with us at our first starting&#44;
                and not withdraw from us his grace and aid till our task be accom&#8211; 1 dished. O

                in vain&#44; our words fell on ears deaf to admonition&#59; but at length&#44; for
                which we bless thy Name&#44; we are at the eye of commencing the work which is so

                Joshua&#44; the successor of Moses&#44; was nigh the end of his mortal career&#44;
                he assembled the whole tribes of Israel at Sliecliem&#44;and addressed the
                elders&#44; captains&#44; judges&#44; and officers of justice&#44; in a heart&#8211;
                stirring appeal&#44; relative to their duties to their God&#44; in reminding them
                liow mercifully lie had brought them and their fathers to be his servants. He left
                them&#44; however&#44; the choice of remaining faithful to the Lord&#44; or
                selecting some of the various idolatries which were then in vogue&#44; either that
                of the Mesopo&#8211; tamians&#44; or of the Emorites&#44; near whom they then
                dwelt&#59; but whatever the people might resolve on&#44; he declared his tirm
                determination that he and his house&#8211; hold would serve the Lord. The
                Israelites&#44; however&#44; who had been the witnesses of the mercy and might which
                had been displayed before them&#44; had no doubt of the trulli of their religion in
                their heart&#59; they therefore chose the same worship which their leader had
                chjjHen&#44; and they declared&#44; &#34; We also will serve the Lord&#59; for he is
                our God.&#34; After again receiving <pb n="5"/> THE TESTIMONY. 5 an affirmation of
                this pious and prudent resolution&#44; Joshua wrote all that had transpired in a
                book con&#8211; taining the law of God&#44; and took a large stone and erected it
                there&#44; under the beech tree which was near the sanctuary of the Lord &#59; and
                then we read &#8212; &#34;And Joshua said&#44; Behold this stone shall be as a
                testimony against us&#44; for it hath heard all the sayings of the Lord which He
                hath spoken with us &#59; and therefore shall it be as a testimony against you&#44;
                that ye may not prove fixlse to your God.&#34; Joshua xxiv. 27. These last words of
                the son of Nun may appear strange to you&#44; inasmuch as he ascribes hearing to an
                inanimate block of stone&#44; and says that it shall be a testimony against those
                with whom he spoke. But it is not to be expected that Joshua meant to convey&#44; or
                that the people understood him as implying&#44; any such absurdity. It is only in a
                metaphorical sense that he spoke. The people had been assembled near where the stone
                lay on the ground&#44; consequently all the words and promises which they uttered
                could have been heard by the stone had it been a living being&#59; wherefore it
                might well be erected in that place&#44; and remind all future comers&#44; on seeing
                it&#44; that on that very spot&#44; and around it&#44; their forefathers stood&#44;
                when they solemnly declared that they would remain Israelites&#44; and obedient to

                is well known to you how powerfully memeutos of the departed affect us&#59; how we
                can be made sad by re&#8211; tailing to mind some simple lay which we in infancy
                heard our mother sing&#59; how we are constantly wrought upon by even trifling
                matters&#44; which bring back before our memory events that we long since had deemed
                as faded and forgotten. It need not&#44; therefore&#44; surprise us that
                mankind&#44; in all ages&#44; have deemed monumental columns of high importance&#44;
                as fixing historical events in the most energetic manner on the minds of the
                beholders&#59; and it is only in obe&#8211; dience to a positive injunction&#44;
                that the ancient Israel&#8211; ites did not invoke the aid of sculpture&#44; or the
                other cognate branches of the plastic art&#44; to commemorate their heroes and their
                beneficent exertions. The more reason was there for erecting simple&#44; and if you

                the all&#8211;devouring tooth of time&#44; in order tliat they might serve to point
                out the spots con&#8211; secrated by the occurrence of important events&#44; which
                would then also call their attention to the fact that&#44; be&#8211; cause they were

                per&#8211; haps&#44; esteem this prohibition of sculpture and carving as narrow and

                representing the hu&#8211; man figure in relief&#44; as it was practised by the
                an&#8211; cients &#8212; the consequent tendency of rising in imagina&#8211; tion
                from the mortal to the Immortal&#44; and to portray Ilini too with daring and
                impious hands &#8212; the means it gives to represent criminal acts and indecencies
                of all sorts&#44; as we see but too often among moderns&#58; &#8212; we need not
                feel any surprise that iu our religion no ojiportunity was allowed to a prurient

                to vice&#44; or to elevate to an undue height frail mortality&#44; and to invest it
                with attributes to which it has no claims. Besides all this&#44; the emblematic
                pic&#8211; tures and sculptures of the ancients have long since lost their
                significance &#59; and however some one highly endowed may yet be permitted to
                decipher their secrets&#44; and the history and lessons they convey&#44; it is not
                to be denied that&#44; as guides to mankind&#44; the stu&#8211; pendous works of
                antiquity are practically of no more use than the simple stone erected by Joshua.
                You may say that&#44; so far as permanence is con&#8211; cerned&#44; the monument
                erected near the sanctuary at Shechem is no longer in existence&#59;
                consequently&#44; to us&#44; at this late day&#44; it is of no more use than the

                it Avas required&#44; whilst the mind of the people needed to be rekindled&#44;

                potent now as it was on that very day&#59; and yet more&#44; it is more firmly
                established in the hearts of all Israelites than at that early date of our
                history&#44; when so many wavered and went often astray after strange gods who have
                no breath in their nostrils. And let me ask you. What brings us here together this
                day&#63; It is the very same idea which caused Joshua to set up his memorial
                stone&#44; &#8212; it is to testify that we wish to erect an institution in honour
                of the name of God. The sanctuary is indeed no longer ours&#59; we have only small
                places for meeting to pray and to exhort &#59; and we lack the glorious
                manifestation of the Divine Presence which formerly animated and comforted us. But

                relation of children to their Father&#44; of scholars to their Teacher. And we have

                principal business of the teach&#8211; ers to imbue the mind early with true
                conceptions of the Godhead&#44; and to repeat the lesson so frequently&#44; by a

                the multitudes followed&#44; whether they&#8211; made their pilgrimage to the temple

                maintaining their religion. We in our day require the same devoted zeal among our

                they now&#63; It has always been to me a subject of profound astonishment and deep
                regret&#44; that there was not a single school all over the country&#44; until very
                lately&#44; where a Jewish child could obtain any information on his religion. The
                synagogue was noplace for instruction&#44; because public lectures formed no part of
                the exercises. Family&#8211;worship&#44; except in rare instances&#44; was
                unknown&#44; and family religious reading was not thought of&#44; beyond a perusal
                of the Bible in the common translation&#44; which was first ordered to be read in
                churches by authority of King James the First of England. The religious books
                accessible were limited to the works of the late David Levi&#44; who in his lifetime
                was but ill&#8211;rewarded for the strenuous exertions he made in the cause of
                Judaism. Our Jewish predecessors in this country had only one place of meeting&#44;
                and this was the synagogue where the worship was uniformly the same every Sabbath in
                the year&#44; the tunes only varying to suit the various occasions for which they
                are very happily adapted. Could such a system tend to make men and women familiar
                with their faith&#63; could it produce a fusion <pb n="13"/> THE TESTIMONY. 13 of

                among the natives them&#8211; selves&#63; It is idle to expect it&#44; for many knew
                not a word of Hebrew&#59; the language of their worship was an unknown tongue to
                them&#59; consequently the sounds&#44; beyond the sweetness of the melody&#44; fell
                like an un&#8211; meaning noise on their ears&#44; and no improvement&#44; no
                lifting up of the heart could be expected. And where a little Hebrew was acquired
                from some casnal trav&#8211; elling teacher&#44; it served more to deepen the shadow
                of the absence of information&#44; than to remove it&#44; just as the taper reveals
                to us more grimly the desolation and darkness of a subterranean prison&#44; the
                outlines of which are not to be discerned by the flickering flame which we carry in
                our hands. It was indeed surprising that so many years should elapse without due
                efforts being made to establish schools&#44; and place the worship in the synagogue
                on a better footing. But though the evil was so appar&#8211; ent&#44; it was allowed
                to continue unchecked&#44; until the eyes of many were painfully opened to the want
                of love and harmony existing among us. People who had not in youth any familiar
                intercourse&#44; who had been exclusively reared among gentiles&#44; who had no
                friends among their own nation&#44; could not sympathize with the other
                Israelites&#44; who moved in a different or inferior station to themselves. The
                sequel was es&#8211; trangement from religion&#44; and a constantly decreasing
                obervance of the precepts of the Bible. I Avas told by an aged gentleman&#44; now no

                and enjoined on all to abstain from eating with her at her table&#59; and only upon
                a reparation of the wrong was the interdict removed. You may say that this was
                tyranny&#44; an unwarranted interference in private family&#8211;matters&#59; I
                cannot agree with you in such an opinion&#44; as it was a public affair in which the
                pious synagogue&#8211;elders thought them&#8211; selves authorized by custom and
                prescriptive right to interfere. But be this as it may&#44; it shows the high degree
                of conformity then prevailing in the oldest congregation in the country. Xow look at
                the con&#8211; trast with the present state of affairs &#33; See how many violate
                the Sabbath &#59; how many are married out of the pale of Judaism &#59; how many eat

                worse. I said the evil had become so apparent&#44; and that something was necessary

                the just charge of actual ignorance is no longer applicable to all places where this
                has been done. But no one can say&#44; that much has been accomplished towards
                diflusing a knowledge of the language of the Scriptures&#44; without which no
                education of an Israelite can be complete. The little that can be acquired in extra

                requires no argument to prove this proposition. And pray&#44; why should we not

                again. Shall this be always so&#63; will you be always satisfied with things as they
                are&#44; when you see the evil that has already resulted to our communities from

                progressive acquirement of Hebrew&#44; Hebrew literature&#44; and religion. It is
                not to be as in other schools&#44; a secondary matter whether the children learn
                Hebrew and religion or not&#44; but they are to acquire these&#44; if even nothing
                else can be imparted. Still imagine not that we are not fully alive to the

                branches of education under the superintendence of instructors of their own people
                no less than of others. We mean&#44; however&#44; to let the objects and concerns of
                eternal life not be merely the work of spare&#8211;time and a leisure&#8211;day&#44;
                but to see that daily&#44; and in the usual school&#8211;hours&#44; the language and

                it is merely a sense of duty which impels them to be ac&#8211; tive in the

                to carry out their views. But as this is the case&#44; the greater obligation rests
                upon those who have children&#44; and who wish to rear them in a religious and
                hopeful manner&#44; to send them to us&#44; that we may fulfil in them the duty
                which in obedience to our religion we have assumed. But&#44; I hear some one

                what they liave acquired elsewhere before&#44; we shall be willing to acknowledge
                that we have failed. You must&#44; however&#44; reflect again&#44; that we do not
                merely charge ourselves with simple education &#59; we wish to return your children

                and we Avill endeavour to amend&#44; so far as this may be practicable with the
                means and materials at our disposal. Only let me beg you&#44; not to doubt hastily
                of a good result&#59; it has been well said that &#34; our doubts are
                traitors&#59;&#34; and it is certain that no great enterprise ever succeeded where
                the actors themselves doubted of their final success. To insure a happy issue we
                must have but one thing in view&#44; namely&#44; the end we are aiming at&#59; we
                must not regard great or small obstacles as things worth minding&#44; but move
                straight onward&#44; and let each step taken in advance be the forerunner and
                guarantee of the next succeeding one. Believe me&#44; that the greatest results are
                obtained by slow and con&#8211; tinuous minor advances&#59; and they succeed the
                best who persevere the longest&#44; without despairing of their chances of carrying
                out what they at first dimly con&#8211; ceived to be within the range of their
                possibility. As little as wealth or renown is suddenly acquired&#44; ex&#8211; cept

                progress. Without a miracle&#44; this will be impossible&#44; and we are not vain or
                foolish enough to claim the ability to accomplish the impracticable. Bat let me beg
                of you all&#44; not to undervalue our and your capacity for succeeding with this

                self&#8211;willed to succeed where others find no bar to carry out their views. For
                my part I will never believe that we are inferior to the best of mankind in whatever
                we devote our attention to. Look at the great progress we have made in commerce and
                the mechanic arts wherever we had a fair field of action &#58; and I see no reason
                why the same result is not equally certain in every pursuit to which we may
                seriously devote our energies. It is and has been our misfortune for many
                centuries&#44; that small trading&#44; and at best large commerce&#44; has been our

                maintained a high character as an educated and intellectual people&#44; though at
                times our educational systems have been highly defective. But I ask you&#44; what is
                to prevent us in this free country&#44; where all legal disqualifications are
                unknown&#44; from advancing with the same or greater rapidity in intel&#8211;
                lectual pursuits with our fellow&#8211;citizens of other per&#8211; suasions&#63;
                What a humiliating confession would it be&#44; were we to acknowledge that we did
                not establish religious schools&#44; because we lacked the capacity and energy to
                undertake them&#44; though we had ample <pb n="21"/> THE TESTIMONY. 21 means and a

                this all of you&#44; induce others to say the same&#44; and then you will soon see
                whether Israelites can succeed in disseminating education and religious knowledge as
                successfully as the best and most enlightened denomi&#8211; nation&#44; whatever
                this may be. I use plain language&#44; I deal in no flowers of ora&#8211; tory&#44;

                so much to the feelino&#8211;s that I wish to appeal as to your good judgment&#44;
                and hence I hope that you will not get impatient when my address de&#8211; tains you
                longer than you expected. The subject is one of the highest importance&#44; and
                concerns you all&#44; my hearers&#44; whether you are rich or poor. Could I have the
                opportunity of seeing you here frequently&#44; I might indeed cut my remarks short
                to resume them at another time &#59; but as this may perhaps never be in my
                power&#44; I must crave your indulgence to some few other considerations in
                connexion wuth the subject. &#8212; To Israelites their religion is no luxury&#44;

                importance. An Episcopalian need not be a high or low churchman in order to believe
                in his sys&#8211; tem &#59; for he has a wide range in which to move &#59; and he
                can be a Nazarene&#44; and for all we know fully as good as auy in his sect&#44;
                though he turn Baptist or Quaker. But a Jew is no Jew if he has not a firm hold on
                his peculiar opinions and distinguishing practice. Theoretical Jews can exist&#59;
                we have&#44; unfortunately&#44; many such&#59; but they are not the Israelites of
                the Scriptures&#44; because the material element of this char&#8211; <pb n="22"/> 22

                restrictions&#59; no noble classes who may transgress&#44; no lower orders who may
                yield them&#8211; selves to degrading vices in order to gratify the sen&#8211;
                sualities of the lordlings&#44; who look upon them with contempt even whilst they
                minister to their pleasures. The Jew is a Jew&#44; whether he is the peddler that
                bends double under the burden which his laborious shoul&#8211; ders carry&#44; or
                the baron of the Austrian Empire who idles away his hours on the luxurious sofa. The
                hopes of the last are not a whit higher and nobler than those of the first&#44; and
                this one has the same claims to immortality and a glorious hereafter&#44; as the
                most favoured child of luxury. Fortune&#39;s gifts may be&#44; by the will of
                Providence&#44; very unequally distrib&#8211; uted &#59; but let not their

                par&#8211; take of the repast which we hope to spread for you in the name and by the
                aid of God. We demand of those able to pay&#44; a small fee towards defraying the
                expenses which we have to incur&#44; and we trust that this will be cheerfully given
                &#59; but they who are not blessed with a superabundance of means are invited&#44;
                nevertheless&#44; to intrust to us their children&#44; and we promise them that they
                shall not suffer the least re&#8211; proof for the inability of their parents. All
                we ask of them is to send their children tidily dressed&#44; and cleanly in their
                persons&#44; so that no stain will attach to them for their humble state. And let me
                here re&#8211; mark at once&#44; that nothing so promotes good conduct and
                proficiency in study as scrupulous cleanliness&#59; in a dirty body a dirty soul too
                often dwells&#44; and the ex&#8211; terior is mostly a fair index of the inward man.
                Cleanliness&#44; saj&#8211; our wise men&#44; is the first step to the acquisition
                of holiness&#44; and it is a necessary element <pb n="24"/> 24 THE TESTIMONY. of
                Jewish life&#44; as our Loly law amply proves. It is not to be questioned that&#44;
                if the children of the poor come hither so that all can freely associate with
                them&#44; it will be an incentive for the rich to apply to us also to take their
                offspring under our charge&#59; and only the non&#8211;observance of this rule can
                operate as an ex&#8211; cuse to withhold any one from taking advantage of the
                institution we now commence. Let no one think that any injury can result to

                the fact that all are not prosperous alike. It will produce in them kindliness of
                feeling&#44; at finding that the same virtues can dwell in a heart covered by a

                of the poor are the same as those of the rich. This is levellmg iqyward&#59; you

                they ac&#8211; quire from them politeness and good breeding. This is well understood
                in the country where I was born. Universal education has long since been established
                there &#59; and at the same colleges where the sons of the nobles acquire their
                collegiate education&#44; the children of the day&#8211;labourers are freely
                admitted. The former have to pay the annual stipend which the rules re&#8211;
                quire&#44; whilst the others enjoy precisely the same ad&#8211; vantages and
                privileges without any charge whatever&#59; and it is not rare that the poorest

                the happy effects it may produce&#44; if it is rightly encouraged. Its friends and

                doubts and difficulties have surrounded every step in advance we have taken&#44; and

                are assigned &#59; but these aftect not their general obedience &#59; and the
                especial acts required of them extend only to the general good&#44; for the
                furtherance of which the various selected classes have needs to be established&#59;
                since neither an Aaron&#44; nor a David&#44; nor a Samuel&#44; nor an Isaiah&#44;

                these were called upon to exe&#8211; cute&#44; was merely to fortify the large
                masses of their countrymen in the observance of the precepts in which all had a
                common interest. But as respects pure morality and the relative obligations which
                each man has to the other&#44; there was not&#44; and could not be any difference in
                the different ranks of society&#44; inas&#8211; much as all had the same Chief to
                follow&#44; and all owed obedience and implicit fealty to the same God&#44; who
                declared all alike to be his children. Let us now take as the text of our reflection
                of to&#8211; day the following verse from this day&#39;s Sidrah&#44; &#34; My
                Sabbath shall ye observe&#44; and my sanctuary shall ye rever&#8211; ence &#58; I am

                Ju&#8211; daism&#44; referable to one single cause&#44; and this is the will of God
                as revealed to us in his word. You can&#8211; not indicate to me a single act which
                is obligatory upon us that is not contained in or at least derived from the
                Scriptures&#59; and if it be possible to point out any not so authenticated&#44; we
                may at once say that its execution is a voluntary act on our part&#44; but is no <pb

                we are punish&#8211; able&#44; and for the observance of which on the other hand we
                are entitled to reward. Punishment and reward are properly applicable to duty
                only&#59; we are ordered by God to fulfil certain precepts&#44; some of which are
                easy and others difficult of execution&#44; and the measure of our disobedience or
                obedience fixes our liability to divine and civil visitation for our acts&#44; or
                exhibits us as entitled to commendation from God and our fellow&#8211;men&#44; and
                the consequent happy and gratifying results springing from this state of things. It
                is according to this view that we are simply bound to become acquainted with the
                principles of the re&#8211; vealed religion&#44; which we justly assume to be from
                God&#44; in order that we may know what acts to do and what others there are which
                we must avoid &#59; and the closer any one of us approaches the standard thus
                discovered&#44; the nearer will he be perfect&#44; so far as this is practicable for
                us to become. At best will this perfection be exceedingly difficult for ua to
                acquire&#59; we are so surrounded with temptations&#44; we are so constantly
                imagining that we are excused by circum&#8211; stances for failing in our duty and
                faltering in our path&#44; that we must often feel shame and contrition at
                discovering how easily we have been lured away to do that which we would condemn in

                little do we struggle before we yield to allurement&#44; how glad indeed are we to
                have so paltry an apology&#44; as an opportune and convenient temptation to do what
                is wrong. This is our course even when we know our line of duty &#58; how much more

                state of nature&#44; by which is meant that state of lawlessness&#44; where he roams
                about at will without moral or civil restraints&#44; indulging in all imaginable
                fancies which his own impulses may direct him to. Without entering deeply into the
                inquiry whether such a state ever can exist&#44; even amongst the most savage
                tribes&#44; it must at once strike you&#44; that the unrestrained license in one
                must operate to the injury of all others &#59; for it is not to be supposed
                that&#44; when a man is absolutely free to do as he pleases&#44; he will be
                restrained from any act of aggression upon the person and property of others&#44; if
                he deems such a trespass&#44; as we view it in our state of civilization&#44;
                conducive to his pleasure and within the limits of his strength to accomplish.
                Nature&#44; we may be sure&#44; is as strong in one as in another &#59; the desire
                for gratification and to possess is powerful in all alike. If&#44; therefore&#44;
                there be no law to restrain the impulse to have and to enjoy&#44; there can be no
                peace&#44; no property&#44; no love&#44; no rights&#59; but all would be one
                universal scene of warfare&#44; anarchy&#44; hate&#44; and plunder&#59; the strong
                would override the weak&#44; and the latter would plan secret and cuuniug devices to
                accomplish by craft what he lacks in brute force&#44; to be revenged on the other.
                Consequently if you abolish law&#44; you abolish civilized society &#59; for if even
                you might succeed by any&#44; the barest&#44; possibility to enable a savage to live
                alone in the recesses of a mountain&#8211;fastness&#44; or the solitude of the
                forest unre&#8211; strained and uncontrolled&#44; you cannot give him a single

                can submit unconditionally to the will of another and be happy or even negatively
                con&#8211; tent&#59; he will sigh to be released from the bonds of such depressing
                slavery &#59; he will want to know how far the bounds of the power of his tyrant
                extends&#59; and if he can find none&#44; he will not rest till he has discovered
                some method to set a limit to the will that oppresses him&#44; so that he may tell
                him&#44; &#34; Thus far shalt thou go&#44; but approach nearer at thy peril.&#34; So
                far&#44; therefore&#44; is the law of God from abridging our natural rights&#59; so
                far is it from destroying our independence&#59; so little does it deprive us of the
                least that we could claim as justly our due&#58; that it is at once the exponent of
                our rights&#44; and the best definer of our duties&#59; since it marks out what we
                must do to others and what we have an undoubted right to re&#8211; quire from them.
                All just legislation must be a sys&#8211; tem of checks and balances&#59; something
                must be granted in return for every demand&#59; there must be relaxation for every
                exertion&#44; there must be an in&#8211; dulgence for every&#8211; sacrifice
                required&#44; and so on the other hand there must be no reward without toil&#44; no
                glory without previous merit. Our wise men have an expression which exhibits this

                of religion. It is accordingly not so much the gratification of a desire to rule
                uncircumscribed in tlie world&#44; which induced our gracious and heavenly Father to
                bestow on us his law&#44; as the knowledge He had of our fallible nature that we
                required a guide&#44; sure and unwaver&#8211; ing&#44; which is to point out to us
                whatever we should do or avoid &#59; which should teach us when we should aid our

                greatest state of peace and prosperity&#44; when the fewest possible have cause to
                complain of the acts of oppression committed and of the deeds of charity denied them
                by others. And O &#33; how happily might our life glide away&#44; if each would look
                upon the other as his friend&#44; whom he is bound to love and whom he is willing to
                cherish as one equal with him in the eyes of the Creator&#59; if the strong would
                rejoice in his strength to assist the weak against his oppressor&#59; if the rich

                there is indeed much that is heavenly scattered all over the earth&#59; there are
                brothers and sisters of the needy&#44; there are those in whose houses the poor find
                a cheerful welcome&#44; to whom it is enough that a fel&#8211; low&#8211;being
                suffers&#44; to excite their warmest pity&#44; as they hope to be heard in their

                of crime. And yet such as these are often called the great ones of the earth&#59;
                they are raised high amidst those who have power&#44; and many call them the
                illustrious of mankind&#59; the glittering star of proud rank graces their
                bosom&#44; and historians love to record their deeds&#44; and sycophants flatter

                now wonder that the divine legislation&#44; which is ours&#44; endeavoured to
                place&#44; and succeeded in so doing&#44; all human beings on one level of

                cheeks&#59; and he sees that when they have surfeited themselves with drink and
                food&#44; they sicken from the excess just as he&#44; the labourer&#44; does when he
                neglects the pruden&#8211; tial rules of temperance and moderation&#59; that when
                age creeps over them their hair whitens&#44; and their limbs totter&#44; just as is
                the case with him and his com&#8211; peers&#59; that when an epidemic rages and mows
                down the hard&#8211;working classes and those who live in pen&#8211; ury&#44; it
                spares not the palaces of the rich and great&#44; but garners them in likewise into
                an untimely grave&#59; and that&#44; finally&#44; should all things go well with
                them for many&#44; many years&#44; they cannot escape from the gaping&#44; yawning
                tomb&#44; though it be a pyramid which covers their dust&#44; or a mausoleum which
                rises above their mouldering bones. It is&#44; therefore&#44; I say&#44; that the
                humblest labourer feels within himself that he is a human being&#44; equal with the
                highest&#59; that he has hopes and wishes which carry him beyond the narrow space in
                which he dwells here&#59; that lie has a right to look forward to the time when he
                is to exchange his coarse attire for garments of light and glory&#44; when he is to
                be the immediate servant of God instead of being dependent on&#44; and subject to
                the arbitrary will of man. This future equality of all the sons of Adam&#44;

                weariness&#44; with watchfulness untiring&#44; and with intelligence unflagging&#58;

                which is expounded&#44; &#34; Faithful to bestow reward&#44; and faithful to bestow
                punishment.&#34; It is because God is ever living and ever present&#44; consequently
                always ready and well informed of the affairs of men&#44; that He is emphatically
                our God&#44; and capable to supervise man&#8211; kind to see whether or not they are
                faithful to their trust&#44; and sedulous in fulfilling the various duties which He
                has assigned to them. In this respect now&#44; namely&#44; that there is but One
                Being to whom all are responsible&#44; and all are compelled to look for the
                ful&#8211; filment of their wishes&#44; we must consider all men upon one and the
                same level &#59; wherefore it is also but just that all should have the same
                relative obligations towards each other. Station and wealth are merely accidental
                circumstances which in the present state of society must be assigned to the few for
                the benefit of the many&#59; wherefore their possession does not ab&#8211; solve any
                one from the smallest requirement which is obligatory on others &#58; and so
                likewise the humble&#8211; ness of our position is no reason why we should
                per&#8211; mit ourselves trespasses and violations of the rights of our
                fellow&#8211;men&#59; since neither the possession of worldly goods nor their
                absence can absolve us from a strict regard of the personal rights of our
                neigh&#8211; bours. But it is not alone simple moral rules which the Scriptures
                contain&#44; and which we are bound to ob&#8211; serve &#59; for there are other
                precepts which have refer&#8211; ence more to the dependence which we have on
                God&#44; as our immediate Sovereign&#44; and which are not less necessary for our
                happiness&#44; than the mere rights of <pb n="37"/> THE ESSENCE OF JUDAISM. 37
                humanity. I have already told you&#44; that all duty de&#8211; pends on the revealed
                will of God&#59; philanthropy&#44; there&#8211; fore&#44; and charity in its most
                extended sense&#44; are only obligatory on us because they are a part of the divine
                ordinances&#44; which to enforce He announces himself as the Judge&#44; who is sure
                to measure out a full recom&#8211; pense for our deeds&#44; be this reward or
                punishment. But in order to impress us the more strongly with the acknowledgment of
                his sovereignty&#44; and to render us thus the more energetically the friends of our
                spe&#8211; cies. He lias assigned to us other duties&#44; which in appearance only
                refer to our position toward the Lord alone&#44; although they are secondarily
                calculated to govern our will&#44; and to render us&#44; therefore&#44; more
                obedient in all other things. To this class of duties we may reckon the observance
                of the Sabbath and fes&#8211; tivals&#44; as also the resort to places of
                worship&#44; wherein the name of God is especially invoked. Our text ac&#8211;
                cordingly says&#44; in the same strain&#44; as of the moral precepts&#44; to which
                we have already referred&#58; &#34;My Sabbaths shall ye observe&#44; and my
                sanctuary shall ye reverence&#44; I am the Lord &#59; &#34; which close of the verse
                we may freely expound as the others&#44; &#34;Ready to re&#8211; ward those who obey
                me in this&#44; and to punish those who wilfully refuse obedience.&#34; It says&#44;
                then&#44; that as much as we look to God to reward and punish us according as we are
                merciful and just&#44; or the contrary&#44; so also will our observance of
                Sabbath&#8211;keeping&#44; and propriety in public worship&#44; or the neglect
                thereof&#44; entitle us to God&#39;s mercy or his wrath. It would de&#8211; tain us
                too long to exhibit all the requirements which the observance of the festivals of
                the Lord demand&#59; we can only deal with generalities&#44; and I nmst there&#8211;

                particular day have ujjon lis&#63; Simply this&#44; that whenever it recurs it will
                impress on our mind the well&#8211;attested fact&#44; that it is a part of the law
                revealed to us by our Benefactor&#44; He who gives us life and intellect&#44; who
                moreover extends to us his helping hand to aid us in our distress&#44; just as He
                acted towards our fathers&#44; when He appeared as the Avenger of their wrongs&#44;
                and broke asunder the bonds of their slavery&#44; and bade them go forth to an
                everlasting freedom. It is this God also who demands of us to be kind to the
                poor&#44; and to love each other&#44; inasmuch&#44; as we have been servants to
                Pharaoii in Egypt&#59; consequently&#44; the observing of any festival will awaken
                us to reflect&#44; that in addition to the mere act of resting which we do as a
                religious duty&#44; we offer our homage to the Lord for the benefits we have
                received from Him&#44; under so many and varied circumstances&#44; and we tell at
                the same time&#44; that we will do something&#44; however little it may be&#44; to
                deserve the continuance of his mercy&#59; consequently&#44; we shall be incited to
                make the rest from labour a happy day to all our dependents&#44; to grant them a

                43 Brethren&#33; One of our ancient prophets&#44; one of those chosen by God to
                diffuse a knowledge of his being and will among men&#44; thus spoke in the holy
                enthusiasm with which he was filled at the contemplation of sin around him &#58;
                &#34; Wo to him who saith to the wood&#44; Awake I Kouse up&#33; to the inert stone.
                This should teach &#63; Behold&#44; it is set in gold and sil&#8211; ver&#44; and no
                spirit whatever is in it. But the Lord is in his holy temple&#59; be silent before
                Him&#44; all the earth.&#34; Haba. ii. 19&#44; 20. This is the festival of the
                promulgation of the law on Mount Sinai&#44; when the Lord appeared in a man&#8211;
                ner never before or since witnessed&#44; to instruct man&#8211; kind in his will.
                This was an event which is most fitting to be celebrated whilst the earth
                stands&#8212; whilst the seasons follow each other in their ceaseless succession
                &#8212; whilst the sun shines as a light by day&#44; and the moon and the stars rule

                ccivccl&#44; and the duty which rests on us to be grateful to our eternal
                Benefactor. Ilabakkuk&#44; in common with most of the prophets whose works have come
                down to us&#44; preserved in the canon of the Bible&#44; lived at a time when
                fearful sin had usurped the place of the worship of the Lord&#44; which the law was
                given to institute. Israel had in&#8211; deed departed from the way of
                righteousness&#44; and their land was full of idols&#44; and the number of Ju&#8211;
                dah&#39;s gods was equal to that of its cities. The in&#8211; struction of the sages
                learned in the history and leg&#8211; islation of their people was not sought&#59;
                but the sinful multitude resorted to priests of falsehood and decep&#8211; tive
                oracles to tell them what the future would bring forth. The temple at Jerusalem was
                not visited&#59; but&#44; instead of this&#44; men rushed to the altars at Dan and
                Beth&#8211;El&#44; wherefore the last was called by the prophets
                Beth&#8211;Aven&#44; meaning no longer the house of God&#44; as it was named by
                Jacob&#44; when he dreamt of the angels who watched over his flinty pillow&#44; but
                the house of iniquity&#44; as it had become through the enormous transgressions of
                the chosen people. Therefore did God send fearless men&#44; who only saw in their
                fellow&#8211; beings perishable creatures&#44; whose anger they could well
                despise&#44; and whose vengeance they could well defy&#44; in the holy work for
                which they were designed&#44; to lead back the erring children to the embrace of the
                Father who wished for their reconciliation. Hence we have the long list of prophets
                and teachers&#44; who faltered not before the frown of despots&#44; and halted not
                in the presence of a riotous multitude&#44; though carnal weapons were lifted up
                against them&#44; and they knew that by their perseverance their hours <pb n="45"/>

                boldly against the prevalent follies of their age. It mattered nothing in their
                estimation that it was the king who said to the wood&#44; &#34; Thou art my
                father&#44;&#34; or that the high&#8211;priest spoke to the stone&#44; &#34; Thou
                hast borne me&#59;&#34; for their mission was from on High&#44; and they re&#8211;
                garded not the earth nor its allurements&#44; in view of the great destiny which was
                theirs. Therefore says Habakkuk&#44; &#44;&#34; Wo to him who saith to the wood&#44;
                Awake.&#34; Yes&#44; so senseless had the people become in that generation&#44; that
                they felled a tree in the forest&#44; cut it into pieces&#44; and feshioned a
                portion into the shape of a man&#44; to stay with them in the house&#44; whilst the
                other was perhaps used to bake the very bread they ate &#59; and then they fell down
                on their knees before it&#44; and addressed it in the words of prayer&#44; in order
                to invoke the assistance of the idol&#44; the fancied god&#44; which had been made
                from a block of wood by the skill of the sculptor&#44; and the decora&#8211; tions
                of gold and silver which it exhibited being merely the tinsel trappings of a cunning

                elapsed. But were our fathers forgotten &#63; Did their groans escape the wakeful

                for that protection which we in vain sought for on eartli. But&#44; independently of
                this considera&#8211; tion&#44; we must not forget that the early followers of the
                truth were hut the members of one family&#44; which&#44; in the lapse of more than
                two hundred years after the emigration of Abraham from Chaldea&#44; amounted to only
                seventy persons. What barrier would such a handful of men have opposed to the evil
                influence of false opinions all around them&#63; Was it not to be supposed that in a
                very short time one by one would have dropped oft&#34; and mingled with the masses
                around them &#63; Do we not see even at this day&#44; that persons become tired of
                presenting the singular spectacle of being conforming Israelites&#44; and adopting
                the cus&#8211; toms&#44; manners&#44; and religion of the gentiles&#63; Might not
                prosperity and ease have led us away&#44; when so few in number&#44; to regard as of
                no importance our separate national existence&#63; No doubt but that this would have
                been the case to a great extent&#44; at least&#44; just as at present&#44; when we
                see similar causes pro&#8211; ducing similar results. But now observe the ways of
                Providence &#58; &#8212; Barely had the family of Jacob begun to multiply in the
                country assigned to them for their residence&#44; than the antipathy of a difterence
                of faith produced its natural result&#44; a dislike of the majority for those who
                diftered from them&#44; precisely as it is witnessed daily in our own experience.
                Yet not alone was this dislike manifested in a mere unwilling&#8211; ness to
                acknowledge the Israelites as equals&#44; though they had greatly enriched the land
                of their adoption&#44; which had so pressingly invited their first settling on <pb

                shepherds &#58; but it soou degenerated into a desire of subjugating them to the
                service of the state&#44; first to diminish their increase by excessive toil&#44;
                and then to prevent their quitting the country&#44; which they had already
                benefitted by their presence. On the one side&#44; therefore&#44; we behold the
                Egyp&#8211; tians tyrannizing over our forefathers&#44; abominatmg them as
                aliens&#44; maltreating them as entirely depend&#8211; ing on their will and
                pleasure&#58; whilst on the other&#44; it was also natural that those who thus
                suffered&#44; should sigh for their freedom&#44; which they could only hope to gain
                by the overthrow of their masters. A mingling of the races&#44; where the subsisting
                relation was only as tyrant and slave&#44; was&#44; in the nature of things&#44;
                impossible&#59; and sooner or later&#44; a collision must have taken place&#44;
                wherein one or the other would have been exterminated&#44; when either the rage of
                the oppressed would have crushed the oppressors&#44; or the power of these&#44;havc
                exterminated the insurgent hordes. Both alternatives have occurred in the his&#8211;
                tory of the wcM&#8211;ld&#44; and would in our case have resulted in an obliteration
                of our entire people from the his&#8211; tory of mankind&#44; or presented us in our
                first rise r.s merciless murderers&#44; and a horde of ruthless bar&#8211; barians.
                In either case our residence in Egypt would have been without its influence on human
                events&#44; so far&#44; at least&#44; as the progress of mind and civilization is
                concerned&#59; and this would have been the result even if we had been
                victorious&#44; until such time as the savage and rude natures&#44; who had struck
                for freedom&#44; had been reduced to a more gentle and tractable state. This might
                have endured for ages&#44; as we liave proofs <pb n="61"/> THE OBJECT OF OUR

                good result&#59; and then it is douhtful what form the new civilization would have
                assumed. But it is evident that the compulsory residence in Egypt of a family of men
                like ours is&#44; higlily intellectual and susceptible of the greatest
                improvement&#44; could not lead to such deplorable results&#44; without injuring in
                a material point the progress of human society. If the intention of Providence was
                to isolate us&#44; it was not to render us barbarians&#59; if it was designed that
                we should not be mingled up with other nations&#44; it was not to arm us against all
                the world besides. How then was the liberation of Israel to ho effected &#63;
                Pre&#8211; cisely as it is recorded&#44; by the evident interference of
                Omnipotence&#44; at the time when they had become suf&#8211; ficiently numerous to
                stand alone in the rank of na&#8211; tions&#44; capable of maintaining an
                independence in government and opinions&#44; against the assaults of all mankind.
                Some of you may&#44; perhaps&#44; think that it is assum&#8211; ing too much to
                suppose that the course of events portrays to us the ways of Providence&#59;
                but&#44; on the other hand&#44; let me ask you&#44; &#34;Wherein will you dis&#8211;

                purpose and encompass in their mind the greatest injury to society&#44; they will he
                de&#8211; barred at once by the limits in which they are per&#8211; mitted to

                and beyond the power of endurance of others they will not he permitted to work out
                their fell design. We are&#44; therefore&#44; empowered to assume&#44; even if we
                had no revelation to guide us&#44; that tlie residence of the Israelites in Egypt
                was not a useless period in their history&#44; and that the sorrows which they had
                to encounter were not without their corresponding good results. We will&#44;
                then&#44; at once assert&#44; that their residence in that country was de&#8211;
                signed to withdraw them for awhile from the close intimacy which had sprung up
                between them and the inhabitants of Palestine&#44; whose corruption and im&#8211;
                morality would have operated highly detrimental to their own prosperity&#59; and the
                servitude they had to endure was in the same manner calculated to pi&#8211;event
                their mingling with the refined but voluptuous and indolent denizens of the land of
                the Nile&#44; and sinking&#44; like them&#44; into idolatry and moral inertness. The
                Psalmist&#44; therefore&#44; justly enumerates this fact amidst the objects of mercy
                for which he is grateful to the Lord&#59; as we read &#58; &#34; And Israel came to
                Egypt&#44; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ilam. And God mul&#8211; tiplied his
                people greatly&#44; and nnide it stronger than its enemies. He turned their heart to
                hate his people&#44; to deal treacherously against his servants.&#34; &#40;Ps.
                cv&#44; 23&#8211;25.&#41; And all this was done&#44; we may assert farther&#44; to
                impress on the conviction of this people&#44; on the mind of these servants of
                God&#44; the full knowledge of <pb n="63"/> THE OBJECT OF OUR REDEMPTION. 63 whose
                people and whose servants they were. They saw around them the prosperity of their
                masters&#44; and they beheld them at the same time worshippinjr in the manner their
                own diseased fancy had taught them. Every virtue&#44; every vice&#44; every power of
                nature was deified and represented under some typical form&#44; some monstrous
                figure of man&#44; of bird&#44; or of beast&#59; the very cattle of the field were
                held sacred and wor&#8211; shipped&#44; or&#44; at least&#44; regarded as the emblem
                of some superior power&#44; even on the assumption that idolatry represented deeper
                and higher ideas among those ini&#8211; tiated in its mysteries&#44; than it did
                among the vulgar crowd. And yet when the time came for the contest between the truth
                and the falsehood&#44; between the hving God and the base inventions of
                darkness&#44; it was made manifest that the Lord is the only God in heav&#8211; en
                and on earth&#44; and that there is none else&#59; his will had to be obeyed&#44;
                and&#44; though unwillingly&#44; Pharaoh had to consent to let Israel go free&#44;

                means of the messenger of Heaven. But I anticipate what I was going to advance when
                referring to our history. Moses hud come to the des&#8211; ert in pursuit of his
                humble calling&#44; when his atten&#8211; tion was arrested by what could not fail
                of strikino&#8211; with awe the spirit of the most courageous&#44;&#8212; a bush
                wasilaming in fire&#44; yet not diminished of its substance&#44; notwithstanding the
                fierce combustion to which it was subjected&#59; and whilst about preparing to
                investigate this phenomenon&#44; so much in accordance with&#34; the history of his
                people&#44; then and since&#44; he for the first time obtained an insight into those
                great truths for Mdiich he had hitherto sighed in vain. The voice of <pb n="64"/> 64
                THE OBJECT OP OUR REDEMPTION. Almighty Power fills his ears with audible somuls&#44;
                like which nothing human can be imagined&#59; it is not merely hearing&#44; but a
                full conviction that it is so&#44; and not otherwise&#44; which comes over him&#44;
                and his foot is arrested on the sacred soil where the mighty Presence is
                revealed&#44; and he feels strengthened and endowed with a new vigour to undertake
                the noblest mission which ever fell to the lot of man&#44; to be the harbinger of
                freedom and the herald of truth to the oppressed and unenlightened&#44; and the
                light and guide to his fel&#8211; low&#8211;creatures for all ages which are to be
                on earth. And so spoke the God of our fathers&#44; &#34;I am the God of thy
                father&#44; the God of Abraham&#44; the God of Isaac&#44; the God of Jacob&#44;&#34;
                and all uncertainty which the in&#8211; ventions of Egypt&#39;s jDriests may have
                produced in his soul at once fled&#44; and he recognized that all their dreams were
                vanity&#44; and that there exists none to share the power of the One whom
                Abraham&#44; Isaac&#44; and Jacob had worshipped. The traditions of his fathers
                rushed through his soul &#59; the false teacliings of the priests of Egypt and
                Midian&#44; if ever they had the least influence on his spirit&#44; vanished
                forever&#44; and he recognized in its full extent the existence of one sole God and
                Ruler&#44; and that no other being can be im&#8211; agined as sharing his power and
                glory. But the very reminding that this God was the one worshipped by the patriarchs
                must have excited in him the deepest regret at the long servitude of their
                children&#44; seeing that they were to all appearances forsaken and left to the
                mercy of their oppressors. lie may have thought that&#44; if the covenant with
                Abraham was yet remem&#8211; bered&#44; why did his children languish and groan

                the patriarchs should be no longer delayed. The manner of effect&#8211; ing tliis
                was next made known to him&#59; since he him&#8211; self was appointed the messenger
                of the Divine Will to Pharaoh to demand the liberation of Israel. To this&#44;
                however&#44; Moses objected&#44; alleging his unworthi&#8211; ness for the great
                work assigned to him. Be it that Moses actually uttered the words which we find
                re&#8211; corded&#44; or that he merely thought so&#44; and revolved in his mind the
                difficulties of the task before him&#44; it is all the same&#59; and well did it
                become him not to rush upon the glorious mission with hot and eager haste&#44; as
                many of inferior powers would assuredly have done&#59; and not until he felt
                convinced that he could not fail&#44; would he consent to make &#8211;the
                attempt&#44; even in obedience to a divine command. But this assurance was not long
                withheld&#59; for he was told&#44; &#34; For I will be with thee &#59; and this
                shall be unto thee the proof that I have sent thee&#44; when thou hast brought forth

                demand which &#59;Moses was to make in the name of God. The pro&#8211; phet was&#44;
                therefore&#44; thus answered&#44; when he asked&#44; &#34;Who am I&#44; that I
                sliould go to Pharaoh &#63;&#34; Indeed&#44; in his own person he had little
                power&#59; he was but a lone shepherd of the desert&#44; banished from his native
                land&#44; unknown to his fellow&#8211;Israelites&#44; whom he was to redeem from
                bondage&#44; without wealth or inliuence anywiiere&#44; in danger of his life&#44;
                so far as human probability was concerned&#44; in case he should he de&#8211;
                nounced to the civil authorities&#44; if lie ventured to re&#8211; turn unpardoned
                from his banishment. Consequent&#8211; ly the assurance came with a double force
                when the Lord told him&#44; &#34; Go&#44; because I will be with thee&#58;&#34;
                nothing shall be too difhcult to be overcome&#44; and no danger too great to be
                withstood&#44; since the Most High himself would protect and prosper his
                messenger&#59; hatred should be converted into respect&#44; unwilling&#8211; ness

                Supreme&#44; until that time when the accomplishment should have crowned the attempt
                with complete success. And more yet&#44; a new assurance was given&#44; one even
                greater than the mere freeing the people from earthly bondage&#44; that&#44; when
                they should have left the land of their servitude&#44; they should also be freed
                from the vices and supersti&#8211; tions of the priests who there taught their
                errors&#59; and the Israelites&#44; thus released from thraldom to the king&#44;

                voice. And the very im&#8211; potence of the idols of Egypt and their worshippers
                was to be exhibited clearly and conclusively as a pre&#8211; paratory step to this
                double enfranchisement&#59; good&#8211; ness and justice were to be conjoint in
                effecting the will of the Most High&#58; so that the obduracy of the king was to be
                coerced in consenting to the libera&#8211; tion of his serfs&#44; and these were to
                see that an Al&#8211; mighty Hand had guided them forth to freedom and light. We
                have thus before us this conviction&#44; that the stay of the Israelites in Egypt
                was not to punish them for any wrong done by them individually or collec&#8211;
                tively&#44; but to teach them nationally the power and goodness of God. A people was
                needed on earth to guard the truth of God&#39;s being the sole Author of all&#44; a
                truth which each successive generation had rejected as too little in accordance with
                the pursuit of pleasure and selfishness. It was&#44; therefore that&#44; at the very
                time the Lord promised to Abraham a numerous progeny&#44; He also foretold him the
                sufferings which they should have to endure. Our ancestor did not complain&#44;
                though a dark&#44; deep melancholy overcame him&#44; assured that all would result
                for the best of the world. He did not&#44; perhaps&#44; understand how such great
                sufferings could well lead to so great an end&#59; still he did not lose his
                confidence in Him who had so long guarded him in his own wanderings&#44; nor was his
                trust misplaced. During all the servitude of the Israelites&#44; though so many
                perished&#44; the great aim constantly became more and more developed &#59; a nation
                was reared&#44; hardy&#44; strong&#44; and laborious&#44; so unlike all others

                gratitude to whomsoever would or could release their limbs from the galling chains
                with which they were loaded. Had it been a man&#44; they perhaps might have deified
                him&#44; as was the foolish practice of the age in which they lived &#58; what else
                then could they do&#44; but be drawn to the service of that invisible Being&#44; who
                in his might passed through the land at the dark midnight hour&#44; and at whose nod
                sank unto death the Urst&#8211;born of every house &#63; Then arose wailing and
                weeping from the hearts of the obdurate who refused to recognize the power of the
                Supreme&#44; and the slaves were sent forth to freedom&#44; and their hands were not
                stained with blood&#44; and their garments reeked not with the gore of their slain
                adversaries &#59; but they rejoiced in the victory which Justice had achieved&#44;
                and they praised the Power which had tri&#8211; umphed without effort over the weak
                designs of im&#8211; potent men. No wonder&#44; then&#44; that our forefothers were
                ready to follow their God into the trackless desert&#44; that they promised to obey
                and to do whatever might be taught them from on High. And though the ancient force
                of habit occasionally overcame their newly&#8211;begotten faith&#44; though they at
                times sighed for the fleshpots of Egypt&#58; they again returned to their allegiance
                when they were reminded that the same Justice which had humbled their
                oppressors&#44; was also ready to chastise them for their forgetfulncss of duty. And

                restrained by a vain dread of offending&#58; no instruction could ever be conveyed
                from the pulpit&#59; for every public address could then be chargeable as obnoxious

                Ba&#39;al&#63;&#34; &#34;We have indeed fallen on evil tinnes when men put their
                dreams in the place of the revelation of God&#44; and endeavour to subvert the
                customs of our forefa&#8211; thers for idle fancies. It is fearful to contemplate
                the vast amount of false teaching which is brought for&#8211; ward to mislead the
                people&#59; and it is agonizing to reflect that the flocks have to watch the
                shepherds&#44; and those who should be led&#44; their leaders. In an&#8211; cient
                times it was not so &#59; for then we could securely follow the guidance of our
                teachers &#59; we had only to ask them for advice&#44; and we were safe &#59;
                because we knew that they would only show and instruct us what is right. &#34; The
                scholars of the wise brought truly much peace in the world&#59;&#34; and their words
                were full of the divine intelligence by which truth and right&#8211; eousness were
                scattered abroad. But many of their modern successors have wofully failed to tread
                iu their footsteps&#44; but have substituted their own fancies and inventions in
                lieu of the pure doctrines of our religion. And still they tell us that there is

                strife&#44; that there is disunion. Opin&#8211; ions have been made to clash against
                opinions&#44; and diverging methods of explaining Scripture have been invented&#44;

                the decision of their sages. Now&#44; however&#44; we have the fancies of wild
                theorists in the place of religion&#44; and instead of mature wisdom we have
                DREAMS&#44; and teachers of the kind in question grope in darkness&#44; and each one

                scorn and contempt&#44; as our reason would at once revolt against his creed &#59;
                we would reject triumphantly the invitation of the Mufti&#44; who would bid us

                because we could on no con&#8211; dition attach any faith to one wdiom the Creator
                has not sent in his name &#59; and surely not one of us would ever listen to the
                assumption of the Lama&#44; that in him there is constantly a renewal of the

                to the absolute com&#8211; mands of God&#44; and we install our wisdom in the place
                where the precepts of the Lord should alone bear the government. Foreign gods we can
                resist&#59; false prophets of other nations we may safely defy &#59; they cannot
                injure us&#44; for we never can adopt them as the controllers of our will. But far
                difierent is it with the idol that dwells within us &#59; the inclination to evil
                which lies in wait for us in our own hearts&#44; which is sure to overpower us when
                we lose sight of our ac&#8211; countability&#44; and fancy that we can travel
                securely without the guidance of God&#44; or that we can measure the justice of his
                enactments by the standard which our comprehension of things may set up as the
                proper measure of truth and right. Therefore we may ap&#8211; ply to our

                speak in consonance with the sincere dictates of our conscience&#44; with what we

                need not be offended at our misapprehending their intentions&#59; for there is One
                above who will be able to judge them rightly&#44; if they suffer wrong at our hands

                will not let them suffer any permanent injury from the injustice of erring and
                partial men. But&#44; as human beings&#44; we must decide the case according to the
                facts before us &#59; and with these I am compelled to say&#44; that under their
                teaching a degree of laxity of observance has been produced which was not known
                before these men arose among us. Sinning has always characterized the children of
                mortality &#59; but the present agitation appears to be a systematic effort to
                render the defection permanent and incura&#8211; ble&#44; and to install quite
                another measure of righteous&#8211; ness for Israel than the plain word of God&#44;
                as we have been interpreting it to this very time. And in this the leaders of whom I
                speak have acted very unjustly. They have spoken in general terms&#44; that a change
                was necessary &#59; and when we called on them through public speech&#44; or public
                writing&#44; to define the limits of their intended progress&#44; we obtained abuse
                instead of a calm reply. Instead of fairly laying down the principles on which the
                modifications of our religion should be made&#44; by which all might have been

                things to denounce those who act with us&#44; it is not true that we are all so
                ignorant&#44; so unenlight&#8211; ened as our opponents pretend to think us. The
                light of science and discovery has risen for us also&#44; and we have not been
                behind them&#44; as a class&#44; in the field of modern research and study. What

                them in any element necessary to com&#8211; prehend justly the matter at issue. They
                know this &#59; and they therefore ought to have developed their plan&#44; and at
                once unfolded their principles of action. But silence on this point suited them
                better&#44; and rid&#8211; icule and denunciation were resorted to in place of sound
                argument. Yet grant for argument&#39;s sake that we were all so ignorant as has been

                and to render Jews of the present day as ditferent from ancient Israel as possible.
                How far they have succeeded&#44; let the pres&#8211; ent confusion prevailing among

                to several entering the synagogue&#44; and causing some interruption in

                which has just taken place may perhaps be seized on to prove that a change is
                requisite in our mode of worship&#59; that we must go out of our limits to find a
                model to imitate&#44; in order to purify the Jewish synagogue&#44; and that nothing
                short of customs foreign to the observances we have hitherto followed can save our
                structure from ruin. But it is not true that orthodoxy is chargeable with want of
                decorum in our places of worship. Our teachers require of us that Ave are not to
                converse during the prayers&#44; nor during the reading of the law&#59; that we are
                to behave in the synagogue at all times as though we stood in the immediate presence
                of our heavenly King&#59; that when we come to pray Ave should direct our heart on
                High&#44; and feel Avithin our inmost soul what our mouth utters. Do you Avant any

                is usually used&#44; but a recurrence to ancient principles&#44; to do what the
                teachers of Israel&#44; the men of faith and piety&#44; have laid down for our
                guidance. The people ought to be told Avhat is needed&#44; Avhat is required of

                What&#33; are we to have&#44; instead of prayer&#44; the strains of a hired
                choir&#44; who sing a few words with&#8211; out feeling what they utter for our

                requirement of Is&#8211; raelites&#44; at least if they would pray in earnestness
                and sincerity to their Creator. In the mode which our reformers wish to
                introduce&#44; it must be evident that all which they design is to please those who
                come to the synagogue. They fancy that people do not attend now&#44; because the

                prayers themselves are too long&#44; or the language of our fathers does not suit
                the modern taste&#44; nor can the method of enforcing obedience to the ceremonial

                that all this is fallacious&#63; I think not&#59; for all worship would be
                self&#8211;glorification&#44; not intended to humble ourselves before the Supreme
                Power&#44; not calculated to bring comfort and consolation to an agonized

                we have become stran&#8211; gers. &#34;We must not forget that the chief object of
                public worship is to pray in unison with our fellow&#8211; Israelites&#44; so that
                one may incite the other to sub&#8211; mission to the decrees of God&#44; while all
                impress on themselves the conviction&#44; in asking Him for all they need&#44; that
                from the Lord alone can they obtain aid in their need&#44; enlargement in their
                distress. If&#44; then&#44; I feel truly my dependence&#44; if I have within me the
                consciousness of God&#39;s greatness and wisdom&#44; and of my own dependence and
                littleness &#58; I shall not find the time hang heavily on my hands which I spend in

                praises&#44; than the consciousness that by words alone I can express the devotional
                sentiments of my heart. It has been said that it is best preach&#8211; ing to a

                end&#44; not the end itself. Good reforms may therefore be regarded as
                authorized&#44; and con&#8211; sequently admissible&#59; but those which are
                not&#44; can never be legalized&#44; though they might tend to till the synagogue to

                If you accordingly want mere improvement&#44; no orthodox will oppose you. For
                instance&#44; the sale of the Mitz&#8211; voth in your congregation is an abuse&#59;

                it can yield nothing to public clamour&#44; nor to the demands which seekers of
                innovations may make to render Judaism a thing to accommodate itself to every phase
                of history. Such a religion would be none at all&#44; as its ground would be
                constantly shifting&#59; but to pro&#8211; gress with the age&#44; to adopt all the
                improvements which have been proved lawful&#44; is perfectly within the limits of
                orthodoxy&#44; and will therefore meet with no opposition from those who really love
                our religion. But the reformers are not satisfied with this &#59; &#34; the prophets
                who wish to impose upon you the deceit of their own heart&#34; will not improve
                merely&#59; they wish to change&#44; to revolutionize&#44; to alter. They aver that
                Judaism is a very sick man&#44; very sick indeed&#44; and that this man must perish

                instinct with life&#44; with undying strength&#44; and it will resume its
                empire&#44; notwithstanding the many doctors which now attempt its cure. But in very
                truth they are more likely to do mischief than good&#59; they have done so whenever
                they have essayed their skill&#44; and may the Guardian of Israel defend us against

                slay both the body and soul of our people. Still they maintain their views with so
                much perseverance&#44; they assert their honesty so constantly that&#44;
                notwithstanding our knowledge of their contemplated mischief&#44; one is almost
                tempted to believe them sincere. They appeal so often to the judgment of the
                public&#44; as though there were no wrong in their endeavours&#44; enough almost to
                stagger their opponents. But we too wish to appeal to the same tribunal of publicity
                for our justification &#59; we likewise do not dread to come before the people. In

                wager of battle was the arbiter between right and wrong&#44; and the truth cannot be
                defended by carnal weapons&#59; but we boldly challenge these false prophets&#44;
                who teach you what the Lord has not said&#44; to come with their arguments before
                the people&#44; and we will meet them&#44; and with the armour of truth we promise
                to overthrow their deceitful web of a vain&#8211; glorious philosophy. If our
                religion is therefore sick&#44; we must seek other remedies and other
                physicians&#44; and they alone can bring us healing. That some sick&#8211; ness does
                exist&#44; is evident from the clashing of senti&#8211; ments which now
                prevails&#44; from the hostile and angry position which one party assumes against
                the other&#59; and hence it is but proper that we seek for the means of restoriniT a
                healthier tone than is now observable. The remedy I Avoiild then recommend to you is
                EDUCATION. Here&#44; before me &#91;pointing to the benches where the boys attending
                the congregational school were seated&#44; with one teacher at each side&#93; I see
                your children&#44; who are yet new in the ways of the world and its temptations&#59;
                train them to know and fear God&#59; en&#8211; courage their teachers to instil in

                to watch the avenues of their souls&#44; that piety and religion may enter
                therein&#44; and fortify them thus against the approach of iniquity. Should then the
                older branches even become forgetful of their duties&#44; <pb n="93"/> THE FALSE
                PROPHETS. 93 the new generation will arise and rebuild anew the temple of
                righteousness which their predecessors had desecrated. Yes&#44; enlightened religion
                is that two&#8211; edged sword which destroys the enemies of Israel &#58; it is
                potent against the assailants from without&#44; and also against the teachers of
                error within our own camp. This instruction is the remedy&#44; and through its
                means&#44; through its blessed influence alone&#44; can and will the deadly apathy
                which now chills us on the one side&#44; and the dangerous counsels which threaten
                us on the other&#44; be safely encountered and conquered. Who are those among
                you&#44; who will cry out&#44; &#34;A sword for the Lord and Gideon&#44;&#34; as did
                of old the handful of faithful undaunted warriors who followed their leader against
                the countless hosts of the sons of the East &#63; Let these few&#44; however few
                they be&#44; arouse them&#8211; selves to the contest&#44; and victory must be with
                them&#59; they will prevail&#44; notwithstanding the struggle may be long and
                painful. But I really fear that few in&#8211; deed are left&#44; even here&#44; who
                arc not worshipping the idol of human pride in their heart. It is said&#44; that
                there are seven thousand Jews in this city. But are there three hundred among them
                who could follow such a champion as Gideon into the battle&#44; sure that God would

                FALSE PROPHETS. bear my testimony against the evil which is evident on all sides. I
                have been asked by your president to address you on the concerns of our religion
                &#59; and&#44; though I am sure that my plain speech will gain me but little
                favour&#44; I must utter boldly the truth&#44; care&#8211; less whether I offend or
                not. And I now tell you that it would be wicked to use synagogue&#8211;reforms as
                the stepping&#8211;stone for a revolution in our religious system&#44; which is
                contemplated by some &#59; and that it would be unpardonable to transform the
                worship merely to render it pleasing to the ear. I do not as&#8211; sert that we
                should permit disorder and confusion in the recitation of the service&#44; or suffer
                anything to ob&#8211; struct uselessly the devotion which is offered in the house of
                God. ISTotso&#59; the service can be read&#44; if even it be not done so by all
                public readers&#44; and should therefore be recited&#44; in a manner to impress all
                with the sacredness of the places in which we are assembled&#44; and to let them
                feel that what they utter is indeed prayer and thanksgiving. To do this&#44;
                how&#8211; ever&#44; we require no change&#44; no revolution. If on the contrary you
                lose sight of the true object of having synagogues&#44; if you want them merely as
                places where you may periodically find entertainment&#44; where you can spend an
                agreeable hour or two &#58; I tell you&#44; you would do much better to burn the
                synagogues&#44; as they would not then be places which the presence of God can dwell
                in. So also in this ark is deposited the law&#44; of which we read &#40;in Deut.
                xxxi. 25&#8211;27&#41; &#58; &#34;And Moses commanded the Levites&#44; the bearers
                of the ark of the covenant of the Lord&#44; saying. Take this book of the law&#44;
                and put it at the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God&#44; that it

                more after my death &#63;&#34; Here we see that the law was given ns as a
                witness&#44; to testify against us if we forsake its path. What then do you want
                with the law&#44; if you become rebellious against it&#63; What use is there to have
                a record of revelation&#44; if you choose to elevate human reason as an arbiter of
                higher value than itself&#63; If then this be your intention&#44; if you mean to
                follow those who call on you to accept their dreams as your guide through life &#58;
                better burn the law&#44; than let it stand here forsaken&#44; and its precepts
                neglected. Yes&#44; let fire consume the synagogues if they cease to receive those
                who worship God &#59; better that we have no law&#44; that the pure tire should
                consume the books which con&#8211; tain it&#44; than that we should cast away its
                obligation while we hold it in our hands. But it depends upon the people to step in
                to arrest the evil. If the shepherds will not feed you on the pastures of faith&#44;
                follow not their lead&#44; abandon them to their own conceit&#44; and do you pursue
                the plain let&#8211; ter of the religion of your forefathers. Ay&#44; it is an

                unbelief takes root in your hearts. Reflect that sincerity is the touchstone of the
                value of your words and deeds&#59; and for this reason you must be very
                circumspect&#44; that you guard against the propa&#8211; gation of any ideas which
                are against the well&#8211;estab&#8211; lished doctrines&#44; which have inspired
                for so many centuries hope and trust in the hearts of the oppressed descendants of
                Abraham. Here I hold in my liand the form of prayers&#44; in accordance with which
                we have for many centuries past offered up our devotions&#44; whether in synagogue
                or in our houses&#44; whether on land or at sea&#44; whether amidst civilized
                nations or savage hordes. The ideas this old book &#91;holding up the
                prayer&#8211;book&#93; contains&#44; and the precepts and doc&#8211; trines which
                are embraced in this holy volume &#91;placing his hands on a Hebrew Bible which the
                speaker had before him&#93; have become incorporated with the very being of
                Israel&#44; and are in truth the guiding&#8211;star of every act of their life. The
                words&#44; therefore&#44; of our pray&#8211; ers&#44; are not merely a frivolous
                thing&#44; but the very life&#8211;breath of the Israelite&#39;s existence. But if

                prophets of truth&#44; whom the Lord wisely sent to speak in his behalf. And if the
                picture is so dreadful and hideous&#44; so that even its proper name will oflend
                &#58; how necessary is it then to fly from the reality&#44; and to endeavour to

                prayers are the expression of the long&#8211;cherished hopes of our ancient
                people&#59; they never could have originated except from the convic&#8211; tion that
                they are actually based upon the revelation of God&#44; and therefore alone fit to
                be addressed to Him in every circumstance and at all times. But tliis consideration
                again forces upon us to suffer no sacrilegious hand to tear asunder this unseen&#44;
                yet ever&#8211;felt bond which unites our people so strongly together in one faith
                and one hope&#44; which is the same wherever we are found&#44; in all our wanderings

                undying system&#44; whose hope is not firmly placed on the Lord God of Israel. For

                words&#44; by prayer and thanksgiving&#44; in ac&#8211; cordance with the standard
                of right and truth &#59; and then we shall have an unvarying guide&#44; which we can
                follow without the least danger of straying from the proper path &#59; and we shall
                be able to bid defiance to all erroneous teaching&#44; come from what source it
                may&#44; when they who mean to mislead us do not speak in the spirit of

                patiently listened to&#44; and I regret deeply that I had to use the language of
                invective instead of words of gentle persuasion. But when the evil is imminent&#44;
                it were weakness and folly to use sweet phrases&#59; whereas the conscience should

                many no doubt will do it&#59; but I have nothing to ask for myself&#59; it is the

                enlightened in God&#39;s wisdom&#44; and be led to seek for instruction in his

                28th of April&#44; 5615. But even before I left that city&#44; I found that some at
                least had misun&#8211; derstood me&#44; and said that I had made assertions without
                proof&#44; and merely scolded the people and their teachers&#44; without adducing
                any arguments for my assertion. For my ownself&#44; it is a matter of per&#8211;
                fect indifference what may be said there or elsewhere &#59; during a public life of
                near twenty&#8211;six years it has never come into my mind to refrain expressing my

                we thus acknowledge &#63; tell us&#44; ye wise in worldly wisdom&#44; do you know
                Him &#63; Were a painter to conceive the most beautiful&#44; the most perfect&#44;
                the most enchanting and glorious picture&#58; could he represent to us an image of
                God &#63; No&#44; &#8212; his art would be in vain &#59; he could not reach the
                eleva&#8211; tion of the Holy One. &#34;Were a sculptor to labour with all the
                intensity of genius&#44; and produce before us a work of surpassing grandeur and
                sublimity&#44; of pro&#8211; portions the most exact&#44; and of a vastness hitherto
                unapproached &#58; would this be a representation of our God&#63; O no&#59; it would
                be a weak embodiment of human ideas&#44; unworthy of the One whom nothing can equal.
                Perhaps the poet may picture in his glowing language the outlines of the
                Almighty&#44; and bring before our imagination a sketch of the highest idea&#44; so
                that we could say that nothing can surpass this &#58; would this represent to us the
                God of Israel &#63; No&#44; friends &#59; it would still be only human
                imagining&#44; but no realization of what God is. But high and holy as He is. He
                dwells within us and around us &#59; in all the earth there are evidences of his
                glory and might&#59; and &#34; in whatever place He permits us to mention his
                name&#44; there will He come unto us and bless us.&#34; For equally little as the
                painter&#44; the sculptor&#44; and the poet can represent Him before us&#44; so
                little can the architect erect a house fit for his glory. Imagine a temple ever so
                grand&#44; &#8212; imagine the pride of the world&#44; the house restored by
                Herod&#44; which erst graced the hill of Moriah&#44; and to which our fathers made
                their pilgrimage three times every year&#44; and which&#44; alas &#33; is now laid
                waste and ruined&#44;&#42;&#8212; imagine this glorious structure infinitely more

                commensurate with the majesty of the God and King of Israel &#33; Columns&#44; and
                halls&#44; though fit expressions of human feelings&#44; contain not the Being whom
                we worship&#59; and He dwells no less in the humblest meeting&#8211;houses&#44;
                where we assemble to call on Ilim&#44; even here&#44; in this temporary syna&#8211;
                gogue where we have met to&#8211;day to invoke his ISTame&#44; than in the most
                majestic of structures&#59; and He will not be absent from the midst of his adorers
                to bless them with his spirit. And He whom the Avorld can&#8211; not contain&#44; in
                whom all exists&#44; &#34;He&#44; the Holy One&#44; dwelleth amidst the praises of
                Israel.&#34; Wisely has the Psalmist said &#94;x&#39;la&#34; ni&#39;7nn &#34; the
                praises&#44;&#34; not in hymns&#44; chaunts&#44; or songs&#44; which may proceed
                from efforts of art&#44; carefully put together in moments of deliberation&#44; and
                coldly calculated for effect&#44; but in heartfelt issues of thanksgiving&#44; where
                the spirit utters what it feels &#59; it is there that God dwells &#59; it is there
                that the universal Father deigns to be present to be invoked&#44; to be adored&#44;
                to bless those who call on Him. Who&#44; then&#44; is the God of Israel&#63; Even
                the Creator of the universe&#44; the embodiment of all the powers which we can
                conceive to exist&#44; the Author and Originator of everything&#44; and without whom
                noth&#8211; ing&#59; could be. This is the adored One presented to us in the
                Scrip&#8211; tures&#44; and in his name are we assembled this day to commemorate the
                event which gave us the light in which we might walk securely. Let us then take for
                our contemplation two remarkable passages of the Scriptures&#44; the first words of
                the first book of Moses&#44; D&#39;nbx N&#8211;13 r&#39;iyx&#8211;&#40;3&#44;
                &#34;In the beginning God created&#34; &#40;Gen. i. 1&#41;&#44; and the introduction
                to the Ten Com&#8211; <pb n="103"/> GOD SPOKE. 103 mandraents&#44; D&#39;nbx
                i3ti&#44; &#34; And God spoke&#34; &#40;Exod. xx. 1&#41;. If the Bible contained
                nothing besides these two sentences&#44; we should have enough to be thankful
                for&#44; that the Lord gave us knowledge&#44; through his revela&#8211; tion&#44; of
                the great truths thus announced&#44; namely&#44; that He created the world&#44; and
                that He spoke to us aud&#8211; ibly&#44; and thus imparted to us a knowledge of his
                will. First&#44; as regards the announcement that God is the Creator. All men are
                willing to acknowledge that they are of themselves powerless&#44; can produce
                noth&#8211; ing&#44; and cannot destroy any substance which exists. Some&#44;
                nevertheless&#44; imagine that nature always ex&#8211; isted&#44; and that from the
                elements&#44; as they were from eternity&#44; the earth and its system were
                gradually de&#8211; veloped. To obviate this idea the Bible says&#44; &#34; In the
                beginning God created.&#34; When it entered into the will of the Cause of causes to
                call forth the universe&#44; He was alone in liis power and glory &#59; and He then
                produced by his mere word the substance of the ma&#8211; terial world from the waste
                state of non&#8211;existence. It was in the beginning&#44; the first origin of
                things&#44; that this took place&#44; and then D&#39;n&#94;x &#34;Elohim&#44;&#34;
                the Posses&#8211; sor of all the collective powers imaginable&#44; the Al&#8211;
                mighty&#44; unaided&#44; unprompted&#44; without compulsion&#44; without advice&#44;
                created whatever He deemed fitting to make&#59; and just as He willed this&#44; and
                not other&#8211; wise&#44; was it done&#59; and just as his wisdom designed&#44; so
                was all established. Here&#44; then&#44; you have the nature of God&#44; as far as
                he has revealed himself to us. He was the First&#44; before all things were &#59;
                and He was the Originator&#44; wdien the universe was made. But this is not all
                which the words of our text teach us. To man exertion is fatiguing&#44; labour
                exhausts his <pb n="104"/> 104 GOD SPOKE. powers&#44; and when his time of toil has
                passed over him&#44; he is compelled to rest&#44; and is no longer able to continue
                his work. Not so the Creator&#59; He called into being the substance of things&#44;
                the vast elements from which natural bodies are compounded &#59; yet his might was
                not thereby lessened&#44; and He continued in the undiminished possession of all the
                attributes of majesty and power which He had before. It was God&#44; the
                all&#8211;powerful&#44; who created&#44; and all&#8211;sufficient He remained&#44;
                and his creative spirit pervaded the mass He had produced&#44; and He endowed it
                with light and life&#44; and enabled it to become organized&#44; beautified&#44; and
                adorned by the same potent word which had first made it. And God said&#44; &#34;Let
                there be light&#59;&#34; and barely had the thought become word&#44; than the word
                saw itself accomplished&#44; and darkness fled from where it had rested on the face
                of the deep&#44; and light spread itself over every part of the creation. The
                Creator&#44; therefore&#44; is not merely the Author of a lifeless&#44; dark&#44;
                shapeless mass&#44; but also of all the light&#44; beauty&#44; order&#44; and
                harmony which everywhere greet us in the re&#8211; motest recesses of all the
                boundless space. Yet even with this the attributes of God are not completed. There
                are practical atheists who imagine that&#44; with the creation&#44; the work of the
                Lord on earth has ceased. He is too vast&#44; too far removed&#44; too great&#44;
                too holy&#44; to take cognizance of what is wrought here below&#59; we are thus left
                to work our own will&#44; to amuse ourselves as we may deem proper&#44; and there is
                no accountability&#44; no punishment&#44; because there is no Judge. &#34; God hath
                forsaken the earth&#44;&#34; so do men often say &#58; &#34; it is enough for us
                that we believe that we did not produce what is around us &#59; but there is <pb

                source save our reason.&#34; These&#44; however&#44; are told&#44; &#34;In the
                beginning God created&#44;&#34; meaning lie&#44; the Creator&#44; is the Source of
                the power that animates all&#59; He is therefore and necessarily the same who
                sustains all &#59; for who is there to whom He has transferred his godhead &#63; And
                if He is the Preserver&#44; He must also be the Ruler&#59; for to whom has He
                surrendered the dominion &#63; who is there to dispute with Him the su&#8211;
                pervision and control over all the beings&#63; And as He thus rules. He cannot be
                indifferent to the acts of his creatures &#59; since he must have made them for
                ulterior happiness&#44; which is proved by the innumer&#8211; able springs of
                delight and enjoyment which every&#8211; where diffuse gladness and pleasure&#44; by
                the innumer&#8211; able forms of beauty and sj&#8211; mraetry which in all times and
                places enchant the vision&#44; &#8212; in brief&#44; by all the contrivances which
                administer to the wants of man. And if He superintends the work that is done
                every&#8211; where. He must also take cognizance of all the deeds which may militate
                against the well&#8211;being of those whom He has made for happiness&#44; and visit
                them with his displeasure&#44; and check the injury they may be intended to inflict.
                Israel&#39;s God&#44; therefore&#44; is not a mere abstraction&#44; an Author of
                nature and nature&#39;s laws&#44; which are left to work out a certain amount of
                phenomena and effects&#44; both physical and moral &#59; not one who&#44; having
                made what He pleased&#44; left his crea&#8211; tures without control&#44; subject
                only to their own im&#8211; pulses to work out their will and pleasure&#44; and to
                rule wherever their rude power might prevail &#59; on the contrary&#44; He is still
                here to restrain and to punish&#44; to superintend and to reward &#59; and so He
                will continue <pb n="106"/> 106 GOD SPOKE. to the end of time &#59; and all this
                because He is &#34;Elo&#8211; him&#44;&#34; God all&#8211;powerfal&#44;
                unchanging&#44; all&#8211;sufficient&#44; and not subject to the control of aiight
                which lie has made. E&#34;ature indeed is the child of God&#59; the laws which
                govern her are firmly established&#44; and not to be checked&#44; controlled&#44; or
                modified by any act of ours&#59; yet they are submissive to his word and
                thought&#44; and are constantly ready to obey his will. They&#44; like our&#8211;
                selves&#44; are amenable to his power only&#44; and therefore our responsibility is
                not lessened by the admitted fact&#44; that outward nature is acted on by uniform
                laws and checks which no creature can transgress. But instead of this removing us
                from God&#39;s supervision&#44; it only brings us the closer under his eye&#59; for
                He&#44; who in&#8211; stituted all we see&#44; will not need to exert any doubtful
                or uncertain power to regard us each and all with a special providence &#58; we are
                always under his view&#44; and cannot escape from his cognizance&#44; let us flee
                whither we may&#59; in the most open and in the most secret place we are alike under
                the eye of the un&#8211; changing&#44; omniscient Father&#59; &#34; for&#44;
                behold&#44; He slum&#8211; bercth not. He sleepeth not&#44; the Guardian of
                Israel&#59;&#34; and we are always remembered&#44; always guarded&#44; always
                protected&#44; just as we are constantly held ac&#8211; countable in every stage of
                our existence. It is not necessary to point out to you&#44; in the va&#8211; rious
                stages of the progress of the world&#44; that these ideas have been verified&#59; to
                us there has been no change&#59; to the divinely enlightened mind there has been no
                transfer of power&#44; and the same God who crea&#8211; ted in the beginning&#44; is
                still here in this world to rule and govern as his wisdom may dictate. But with the
                creation of matter his work was not yet accomplished&#59; <pb n="107"/> GOD SPOKE.
                107 He indeed had given us reason&#44; by which we could iu a measure judge between
                right and wrong&#44; or rather between what responded to what is agreeable&#44; and
                what is obnoxious to us. But the absolute knowledge of what is right and wrong was
                not inherent in man&#44; or else there could have been no difference of opinion in
                regard to morals and duty He&#44; therefore&#44; who held us accountable for our
                deeds&#44; would have acted unjustly&#44; had He left this uncertain guide&#44;
                unaided human reason&#44; to be the only arbiter&#44; in matters in which all men
                are alike concerned&#44; where the views of one&#44; however honestly
                entertained&#44; may work in&#8211; jury to another. Besides all which&#44; we have
                un&#8211; doubted evidence that those who had to rely on their own investigations
                for light&#44; progressed slowly and painfully&#44; and found themselves still far
                from their goal at which they had been aiming. Justice and mercy are&#44;
                however&#44; the attributes of God&#44; no less than power and sovereignty. He
                therefore made&#44; from the earliest ages of the world&#44; his will known to
                mankind&#44; that they might have a knowledge of the way which they should go. But
                the government of the passions was more in consonance with the ideas which the early
                descendants of man enter&#8211; tained&#44; and they refused to be guided by the
                divine counsels which would restrain their inclinations and direct them to higher
                objects. It was then that there arose the ancestor of our race&#44; and in him the
                truth found a refuge&#44; and he taught his children how to fear the Lord. And when
                those who sprung from Abraham were subjected to bondage and cruel labour&#44; their
                cause was not forgotten by God&#44; and He sent bis servant Moses to break asunder
                their chains&#44; and <pb n="108"/> 108 GOD SPOKE. to lead them forth to freedom.
                But what would a mere bodily freedom have been worth&#63; a simple re&#8211; lease
                from thraldom&#44; if their spirit had yet remained captive to the idols of
                Egypt&#63; Nothing permanent&#59; and a slavish mind could readily have succumbed to
                the power of other tyrants&#44; and wrong and oppression would have been multiplied
                as before. But God re&#8211; membered his covenant with Abraham&#44; Isaac&#44; and
                Jacob &#59; and&#44; in redeeming their posterity from Egyp&#8211; tian
                servitude&#44; he made them also worthy to enjoy free&#8211; dom&#44; by liberating
                their spirit from the slavery of the passions. This great event&#44; the
                manifestation of the evident glory of God&#44; was accordingly witnessed by all our
                forefathers&#59; and men&#44; women&#44; and children&#44; the bond and the
                free&#44; the man&#8211;servants and maid&#8211; servants&#44; and the strangers who
                were among them&#44; were brought to the foot of Sinai&#44; in the third month after
                their going out of Egypt&#59; and there they heard the words of the living God
                speaking to them audibly and clearly all that lie had ordained for their spiritual
                freedom. Let us pause here. The words again are D&#39;hSx i3ti&#44; &#34;And God
                spoke.&#34; The same infinite Being who created the world&#44; the Elohim&#44; the
                embodiment of all the powers which can exist&#44; who alone called forth the
                universe out of nothing&#44; now appeared in his majesty before the eyes of his
                redeemed people&#59; and though they saw no similitude&#44; the likeness of
                any&#8211; thing which they could imitate&#44; they all heard the same voice&#44; at
                the same time&#44; in the same manner&#44; rising clear and loud above the din of
                convulsed na&#8211; ture&#44; and it sunk deeply into their soul&#44; never

                dissolution &#59; the fear of personal danger over&#8211; whelmed the stoutest&#59;
                and while their spirit hovered thus on the confines of eternity&#44; the words of
                the Everlasting One were engraved in their very heart&#44; and they went forth
                enlightened and strong&#59; and the light thus kindled has never since been
                quenched&#44; and it has burnt brightly notwithstanding the many tribulations
                through which they had to pass. No na&#8211; tion had ever heard before them the
                voice of the living God&#44; and they started back in awe and dread&#59; but they
                were told that it was only in order that the fear of God might ever be upon
                them&#44;that they had been permitted to see and hear what no one before or since
                has been privileged to do &#59; and thus they were initia&#8211; ted into the
                covenant of life&#44; and&#44; endowed with this knowledge and imperishable
                wisdom&#44; they have pur&#8211; sued their mission to this day. And it was God who
                spoke &#59; not a delegate of the highest power&#44; not a mediator&#44; to stand
                between the Creator and the crea&#8211; ture&#44; not even a messenger who was sent
                to tell what he had alone been permitted to hear &#59; but all the people heard the
                living God&#44; the same who was one at the creation&#44; when first the light came
                forth out of darkness&#59; the same whom Abraham adored&#59; the same who had
                promised his protection to Jacob&#44; who had thus far guided them unscathed amidst
                the nations of the earth &#59; and He taught them all without a mediator&#44;
                without a second to aid Ilim&#44; without a superior to teach Him wisdom&#44; and
                they felt then and thus that He alone is the Lord&#44; and there is none beside Him.

                defined&#59; they exhihit us the Creator as our Benefactor&#44; who alone has the
                g&#8211;ovcrnnient of all that exists&#59; who demands of man to adore llim
                alone&#44; since there is no other being who can save when He intends to punish&#44;
                who can prevent Him from blessing when He desires to bestow his fa&#8211; vour. We
                are also told that we must not expect to be indulged with impunity when we dare to
                rebel against our Sovereign &#59; we are certified that He is a jealous God&#44;
                ay&#44; jealous&#44; loving his children&#44; solici&#8211; tous for their
                welfare&#44; and He will therefore not toler&#8211; ate that&#44; degrading their
                reason&#44; and forgetful of their allegiance to their King&#44; their love to their
                Father&#44; their gratitude to their Benefactor&#44; they should ren&#8211; der
                homage to the conceptions of human reason or folly&#44; which have been in all times
                set up as divinities or tutelary powers to screen man from the immediate
                vengeance&#44; or to propitiate the favour of God. We were taught to regard the Lord
                as He is&#44; independent in his being&#44; and uncontrolled in his power&#59;
                where&#8211; fore we would be untrue to our trust&#44; if we associated with Him any
                conceivable thing&#44; be it a reality or fic&#8211; tion&#44; in the adoration due
                to Him alone. And it is worthy of tlie character of the Most Holy&#44; that He
                should visit with his indignation such a delinquency&#59; since it would tend to
                bring error with all its baleful train of misery which it was the object of the
                pro&#8211; nmlgation of the law at Sinai to destroy forever. The moral laws which
                were imparted have proved them&#8211; selves&#44; after centuries of experience&#44;
                such that noth&#8211; ing has been devised which could in the least add to their
                truth and beauty &#59; and they are as applicable on <pb n="111"/> GOD SPOKE. 111
                this day&#44; as at the first manifestation of the Lord&#39;s glory on Horeb. And
                the laAV has remained the in&#8211; heritance of our race&#44; and we have carried
                it with us in all our wanderings&#44; and notwithstanding our fre&#8211; quent
                transgressions we have never departed from it altogether&#59; but some have remained
                faithful&#44; when the many cast aside their allegiance. And it is thus that we have
                preserved the knowledge of the &#34;Elohim&#34; who created the world in the
                beginning&#44; who gave us reason and freedom of will&#44; by which we might labour
                to please Ilim&#44; and who&#44; as a just and watchful Guardian&#44; expects of us
                to enrich our&#8211; selves with good deeds&#44; &#8212; but who is also the same
                &#34;Elohim&#34; who came himself to enlighten our reason&#44; that we might know
                the deeds we should fulfil&#44; and the work we should accomplish to merit his mercy
                and kindness. It is therefore not proper for us to se&#8211; lect what may please
                our fancy&#44; and reject what is not suitable to our taste&#59; for we are
                told&#44; &#34;And God spoke all these words&#44;&#34; they all are his decrees&#44;
                the expression of his will &#59; and the whole must therefore claim our obedience
                and our entire acquiescence. There is no difierence between one word and the
                other&#59; and &#34;Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy&#34; is to be regarded
                with the same deep venera&#8211; tion as &#34; Thou shalt not murder&#59; thou shalt
                not com&#8211; mit adultery&#59; thou shalt not steal.&#34; And the duties which
                concern our relation to God alone will have&#44; when obeyed&#44; the same
                beneficial effect on us&#44; as those which relate to the well&#8211;being of
                society&#59; and as we find the Creator still with his power undimin&#8211;

                unchanged. Ages have not altered our relation to God&#59; and the existence of our
                political state&#44; or its decay&#44; should therefore have no influence on us&#44;
                to absolve us in the least of all practicable du&#8211; ties which the law of God
                has prescribed for us. We are still the same to whom the divine legislation was
                first imparted &#59; we are still the same descendants from the Patriarchs that we
                always were &#59; we are still the people chosen from all nations to testify by our
                pres&#8211; ence to the Unity of God &#59; and we have the same means that we always
                had to prove our faith and trust&#8211; worthiness&#44; by obeying the commandments
                which have been imparted to us. Let us then show that we are worthy of this high
                destiny &#59; that we are willing to continue faithful to our mission &#59; that we
                truly be&#8211; lieve in the God of Israel&#44; who is not a mere abstrac&#8211;
                tion&#44; a divinity without power&#44; without vigilance&#44; without
                providence&#44; without justice&#44; but a reality&#44; who has created&#44; who
                governs&#44; who judges&#44; because Pie has given us a law which will instruct and
                guide us in all our earthly relations&#44; and point out to us the way which will
                infallibly lead us to the portals of everlasting life. But to do this&#44; we must
                be active in our testimony&#44; not content ourselves with words and mere
                profession&#44; but continue to obey all the words which God&#44; the Elohim
                Creator&#44; has spoken &#59; and then will lie come among us in his

                Name&#44; even in our humble place of assembly&#44; or wherever He is invoked amidst

                our consolation. Brethren and Friends&#33; After darkness comes light&#44; and after
                tribulations&#44; enlargement&#59; so do we Israelites also turn&#44; after the fast
                which is kept in memory of the destruction of the temple and for the people of the
                Lord that fell by the sword&#44; with confidence and trust to the hope of
                consolation and redemption which are to compen&#8211; sate us for the trials which
                we have had to encounter&#44; during so many wars&#44; in which we twice lost our
                coun&#8211; try and sanctuary&#44; and in the subsequent persecutions which we had
                to endure during our wanderings among all the nations of the earth. Let us then take
                for the subject of our to&#8211;day&#39;s contemplation the commence&#8211; ment of
                the fortieth chapter of the prophecies of Isaiah. After he had in the preceding
                chapters spoken of punishment and retribution as the result of sinning&#44; he opens
                with the words &#58; &#34; Comfort ye&#44; comfort ye my people&#44; saith your God.
                Speak ye &#40;comfort&#41; to the heart of Jerusalem&#44; and cry unto her&#44; that
                her time &#40;of sorrow&#41; is accomplished&#44; that her iniquity is pardoned
                &#59; for she hath received of the hand of the Lord twofold for all her sins.&#34;
                The prophet says&#44; that they should be comforted who are God&#39;s people. But
                were these the men of 10&#42; <pb n="114"/> 114 OUR CONSOLATION. his own day &#63;
                Assuredly not &#59; for he lived in the time of Aliaz&#44; a king renowned for his
                wickedness&#44; who&#44; after he had heen to Damascus where he had seen an altar of
                heathenism which suited his fancy&#44; ordered his high&#8211;priest in Jerusalem to
                erect him one exactly like it in the court of the Lord&#44; whereas he removed tiie
                altar huilt hy Solomon to the north side thereof&#44; and ordered all the sacrifices
                to he brought on his new structure&#44; while that consecrated to God was to be only
                occasionally visited at the king&#39;s pleasure. Such a prince and such a generation
                were not to be styled God&#39;s people&#44; &#39;Ammi&#59; for he emphatically
                an&#8211; nounced through another of his messengers&#44; that a nation&#44; as the
                Israelites were then&#44; are properly Lo&#8211; &#39;Ammi&#44; not my people&#44;
                &#34;for you are not my people&#44; and I wall not belong to you.&#34; Yea&#44;
                Isaiah himself had already said to them in his first chapter &#58; &#34; Your
                new&#8211;moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth &#59; they have become a
                burden unto me&#59; I am weary to bear them.&#34; And just before this he
                exclaimed&#58; &#34; When ye come to appear in my presence &#8212; who hath required
                this at your hand to tread down my courts &#63;&#34; The worship of such a people
                with their festivals and prayers&#44; their coming in masses to God&#39;s
                threshold&#44; Avere all regarded as a burden too heavy to be borne by the Lord&#59;
                and can it be&#44; then&#44; to such as these that the prophet applied the term
                &#39;Amnii&#44; my people&#44; speaking on behalf of the Most High &#63; No&#44;
                brethren&#44; it was not that generation who could claim aflinity to God&#59; they
                were not his people&#44; and the decree had gone forth that they should be banished
                from the temple and the land which they polluted by their abominations&#59; their

                slaughter&#44; and no comfort was to be given to those who forsook their Father. But
                Isaiah did not speak to those who then heard him &#59; he looked far down into the
                depths of futurity&#44; and there disco&#8211; vered quite another people of
                Israel&#44; of whom Zepha&#8211; niah spoke when he said &#58; &#34; And I will
                leave as a remnant in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people&#44; and they
                will trust in the name of the Lord. The remnant of Israel will do no wrong&#44; and
                will not speak falsehood&#44; and there shall not be found in their mouth the tongue
                of deceit.&#34; It is such as these who are called&#44; as Ilosea said&#44; &#34;
                The children of the living God&#44;&#34; instead of being formerly known as
                Lo&#8211;&#39;Ammi&#44; whom the Lord will not look upon as his people. What was not
                then in Jerusalem&#44; therefore&#44; the prophet foresaw as sure to arise&#44;
                centuries after his time&#44; per&#8211; haps centuries after our own days &#58; and
                he says in the name of the Lord&#44; that to this holy people&#44; to those whom God
                will call his own&#44; there should be spoken comfort&#44; there should be brought a
                renewed hope&#44; that of a time of sorrow at an end&#44; of sin atoned for&#44; of
                a period of perfect reconciliation to the Creator&#44; with as much certainty as the
                destruction would be&#44; which was so soon to overtake those who had become rebels
                against the law of Heaven. Thatthe consolation thus promised has not yet taken
                place&#44; is evident from the records of history &#59; there has never been a time
                since Isaiah spoke&#44; that our nation presented that devotion and union in the
                in&#8211; terest of their faith&#44; to be entitled to the high distinc&#8211; tion
                which the name of &#39;Ammi&#44; God&#39;s people&#44; confers on them &#58;
                especially if we should assume&#44; as some modern critics pretend to believe&#44;
                that that part of <pb n="116"/> 116 OUR CONSOLATION. the book of Isaiah&#44;
                commencing with the fortieth chapter&#44; was written after the rebuikling of the
                tem&#8211; ple in the time of Zerubbabel. Instead of such an hypothesis weakening
                our position&#44; it would make it the stronger&#59; as surely during no period of
                the dura&#8211; tion of the second temple&#44; had we much of consola&#8211; tion to
                boast of&#59; first subject to the Persians&#59; then to the Greeks&#59; again a
                brief period of independence&#44; which was soon completely lost through the
                ambition of men who should have been content with the priest&#8211; hood&#44; and
                who finally called in the Romans to settle their senseless quarrels&#44; through
                which means the state and people sunk finally before the assaults of the dangerous
                arbitrators&#44; who had first appeared as their friends. We therefore ask&#44; when
                was it proclaimed within the streets of Jerusalem&#44; that her iniquity had been
                atoned for&#63; when&#44; that her time of sorrow was ended&#63; You appeal in vain
                to any history&#59; it never took place&#59; but its accomplishment is nevertheless
                certain&#44; though the time may be far distant yet. Look at the construction of the
                sentence&#59; if we translate the Hebrew literally&#44; it is not as we have given
                it&#44; &#34; saith your God&#44;&#34; but it is &#34;i&#58;dx&#39;&#44; meaning
                &#34; He will say&#34; at the time when it is to be done&#44; and then will He say
                to his messenger&#44; to speak this comfort to those who are us people&#44; to those
                who are worthy to be called by his Name&#44; that they will then have atoned for all
                their previous faults&#44; and that then a new and better era will arise for them.
                But let us next see what the words of consolation are which will be ad&#8211;
                dressed to God&#39;s people. We find them in verses six&#44; seven&#44; and
                eight&#44; as follows&#58; &#34;A voice saith. Pro&#8211; claim&#59; and he
                saith&#44; What shall I proclaim&#63; All <pb n="117"/> OUR CONSOLATION. 117 flesh
                is grass&#44; and all its goodliness as the flower of the field &#59; the grass
                withereth&#44; the flower fadeth&#44; be&#8211; cause the breath of the Lord hath
                blown upon it&#59; surely the people is grass. The grass withereth&#44; the flower
                fadeth&#44; but the word of our God will stand forever.&#34; This is what will be
                said&#59; but what sort of consolation is this for Israel &#63; It is simply the
                as&#8211; surance that&#44; let occur what may&#44; let all on earth perish&#44;
                there is one thing alone which will survive&#44; and this is the Word of our
                God&#44; even his revelation which is with us&#44; and his spirit which has been
                planted in us. In the spring the grass comes out of the ground&#44; when the
                winter&#39;s snows have melted away &#59; and as the season advances&#44; many
                beautiful flowers cover the surface of the ground&#44; emblems of the Creator&#39;s
                mercy and goodness. But scarcely has a day elapsed&#44; and the wind of the Lord has
                passed over the flowery meads&#44; when the grass is dried up&#44; and the flowers
                hang languidly&#44; withering on their stalks. &#34;We speak of earthly
                prosperity&#44; of fortune and pleasure which accompany many of those we call
                happy&#59; but we turn asain to behold them&#44; when we see them with&#8211; ered
                and faded&#44; and their joy turned into grief and mourning&#59; for &#34;surely the
                people is grass&#44;&#34; and nothing can stand before the indignation of the
                Lord&#44; and what men build falls before the blast of his breath. His Word&#44;
                however&#44; which He spoke thousands of years ago&#44; has survived all that ever
                existed&#44; and will stand&#44; outlasting all forever&#44; just as He himself is
                im&#8211; perishable. Error has been promulgated by men of our nation no less than
                others&#59; enemies have assailed the word of God&#44; to cause Israel to forget
                their al&#8211; legiance&#59; but one after the other have they had to <pb n="118"/>

                adher&#8211; ents &#58; let us not despair of the cause which has been intrusted
                into our hands. &#34;VVe indeed may behold how the wicked flourish like the
                grass&#44; and grow in beauty like the flower &#59; but we may rest assured&#44;
                that there are pains and sorrows which are concealed from the eye of man&#44; and
                which&#44; nevertheless&#44; may and will atflict those who have rebelled against
                the word of God. For we read in Isaiah Ixvi. 24&#58; &#34;And they shall go forth
                and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me &#59; for
                their worm shall not die&#44; and their fire shall not be quenched&#59; and they
                shall be an abhorrence unto all flesh.&#34; &#34;We are not the judges of the Lord
                &#59; we can&#44; therefore&#44; not determine why all things around us are just as
                we find them &#59; we have not the means of forming a prop&#8211; er opinion of the
                connexion of the different events which constantly occur. But the time will
                come&#44; when it will be made known who has been the Lord&#39;s&#44; and who has
                earned his approbation&#44; and who it is that has been brought into his holy
                presence&#59; and who again it is whom Ue has condemned to the shade of his

                self&#8211;fed&#44; constantly burning&#44; never quenched &#59; because they have
                misled others to iniquity&#44; and per&#8211; petuated their evil in those who
                follow their example &#59; and thus they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh&#59;
                all will recognize that their doom is just&#44; and they will rejoice that they did
                not yield to the impulse of their desire to follow the sinners on their path of
                rebellion. Our consolation therefore is&#44; &#34; The word of our God will stand
                forever.&#34; It is accordingly in this&#44; in the law of God&#44; in the word of
                his prophets&#44; in the teachings which the men inspired by Him have left us&#44;
                wdiere we must seek for comfort&#44; and where we shall discover the things which
                will befall us. How many misfortunes have not passed over our nation &#59; and yet
                we are here&#44; to testify by our presence that we are still unconsumed. All the
                efforts made to extinguish our name have only resulted in diminishing our
                numbers&#44; but never in destroying us altogether. And when&#8211; ever we went
                astray from the law of God&#44; and en&#8211; deavoured to become like other
                men&#44; we were not permitted to accomplish our design&#44; and we were re&#8211;
                tained in the service of the One who had chosen us as his messengers. It was his law
                which&#44; itself sur&#8211; viving all on earth&#44; has preserved us also&#44; and

                to the laws of the various states which divide the government of the globe among

                the Lord thy God hath scattered thee. If thy outcasts be at the outermost parts of

                cease&#44; and that the children of Abraham&#44; Isaac&#44; and Jacob will form
                again a state of their own in no other country than the land of Palestine&#44;
                whither they were about to pass when Moses pronounced this re&#8211; markable
                prophecy. It is not for me to assert posi&#8211; tively&#44; that all Israelites
                will dwell in our ancient heritage &#59; perhaps many may continue to reside in
                various countries&#44; and only go up once a year or of&#8211; tener to observe the
                national feasts with their brothers&#44; in the city where the Lord will let his
                glory dwell again as of yore. But whether this be so or not&#44; we have the
                assurance that the main seat of the nation&#44; and of the national worship&#44;
                will be where it was in the time of our prosperity&#44; under David and Solomon&#44;
                in the identical land of Israel&#44; which will then be ac&#8211; cessible through
                the new means of intercommunica&#8211; tion to persons residing on all the
                earth&#44; within the circle of every year. But the time is not specified by the
                prophet&#59; it all depends on the return of the people to righteousness&#44;
                &#34;Even this day&#44; if you will hearken to my voice&#44;&#34; &#40;Psalm xcv.

                day is the period of redemption&#44; if the people will but sincerely repent&#44;
                and obey the voice of God with all their heart and with all their soul. It may be
                asked. How will this repentance be brought about &#63; We have not the means to
                answer the question with precision &#59; but we may assume that it can take place
                even without a direct miraculous agency of God. There is constantly going forward a
                change in the manner of thinking and acting of mankind at large &#59; however we may

                dis&#8211; turbing causes to which it has always been subjected. We may therefore
                maintain that&#44; in the process of time&#44; the mind of Israelites may be so
                imbued with the vanity of all they have hitherto been clinging to&#44; they will so
                thoroughly discover the folly of all the objects they have been pursuing&#44; that
                they will with one accord turn to the law of God&#44; and seek in that for the
                course of life they should pursue&#44; and thus they will literally return to the
                Lord their God with all their heart and all their soul &#59; and thus&#44; being
                again worthy of his favour&#44; they will be tit to be united into one nation&#44;
                and to re&#8211;occupy the rank of an independent people&#44; a model and light to
                all others. That the words of Moses can bear no other inter&#8211; pretation than
                that which they evidently convey&#44; needs no argument&#59; they are too distinct
                and too direct to require any elucidation&#59; unbelief may in&#8211; deed step in
                and deny their truths &#59; but this is all it can accomplish&#44; it cannot
                interpret them to mean any&#8211; thing else than the simple announcement&#44; that
                the outcasts of Israel are to be gathered from all the places of their
                dispersion&#44; to be united again into one people&#44; ruled by the law of God&#44;
                under circumstances which will render it forever respected and obeyed. Not
                alone&#44; however&#44; will our own people be benefitted by this restoration&#59;
                for we are told in Isaiah&#44; &#34;That from Zion shall go forth the law&#44; and
                the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.&#34; The truth shall radiate from the

                also desire to walk in the paths of the Lord&#44; after they have learned some of
                his ways &#59; and as Israel has acquired faith in the law of God&#44; so will all
                others cling to the same&#44; that they may know how to regu&#8211; late their
                course of life. The means to accomplish this may be perfectly in the course of
                nature &#59; events may gradually tend to bring all men irresistibly to one mode of
                thinking&#44; and thus pave the way for the triumph of truth. But there will also be
                another more active and direct agency employed to effect the will of the Creator.
                Just as He sent his servant Moses to become the de&#8211; liverer and legislator of
                Abraham&#39;s descendants when they sighed under Egyptian bondage&#44; thus will He
                send another messenger to effect his purpose with re&#8211; gard to Israel in the
                lirst instance&#44; and afterwards to the rest of the world. In other words&#44; we
                expect a bodily messenger&#44; a direct agent of the Lord&#44; in the manner as
                Moses was&#44; and this personage is known as the Messiah&#44; or God&#39;s
                anointed&#59; and of him we read in Isaiah xi. 1&#44; 2&#44; &#34;And there shall
                come forth a shoot out of the stem of Jesse&#44; and a sprout shall spring out of
                his roots. And there shall rest upon him the spirit of the Lord&#44; the spirit of
                wisdom and understanding&#44; the spirit of counsel and might&#44; the spirit of
                knowledge and of the fear of the Lord.&#34; It is needless to recite for you the

                to be a descendant from David&#44; the king of Israel. The prophecy is enlarged&#44;
                not limited&#44; the event is connected with an agent&#44; and such a one as will be
                in every wise suited for the task which he is to accomplish. Wisdom&#44;

                may not such a person effect&#44; even were the course of things to follow the
                natural channel&#44; at a time when intelligence shall have progressed to the point
                of discovering that opinions hitherto cherished were all vain and idle &#63; But we
                are assured also in an&#8211; other passage&#44; that just &#34;as at the time we
                went forth from Egypt would God show us his miracles &#59;&#34; where&#8211; fore we
                have the fullest confidence that every thing&#44; the natural and supernatural&#44;
                will combine to for&#8211; ward the will of God on earth &#59; and thus the prince
                of the Most High&#44; his messenger of salvation&#44; will have every thing levelled
                before him&#44; to effect the ga&#8211; thering of Israel and the establishment of
                the worship of the Lord&#44; as it has been predicted by the prophets. And in all
                our sorrows&#44; amidst all our wanderings&#44; whenever we were banished from the
                places of our sojourning&#44; we had before us this hope of a glorious

                desire not to see their nation restored &#59; who wish not to pray for the
                rebuilding of the temple &#59; who ridicule the idea that again the sacrifice of

                that they do not believe in the personal Messiah&#44; whom Israelites of former ages
                so ardently hoped for. And one of them has said that it is necessary to root out
                this belief from the hearts of Israelites&#44; that they may not be seduced to

                blood in streams&#44; testifying that we would believe only in one God&#44; in no

                be enough to bring con&#8211; viction home to any one who has confidence in the word
                of God. It is the conclusion of the fifty&#8211;ninth chapter of Isaiah&#58;
                &#34;And the redeemer shall come to Zion&#44; and to those who return from
                transgression in Jacob. And as for myself&#44; this is my covenant with them&#44;
                saith the Lord&#44; my spirit which is upon thee&#44; and my word which I have put
                in thy mouth&#44; shall not depart from thy mouth&#44; and from the mouth of thy
                children&#44; and the mouth of thy children&#39;s children&#44; saith the Lord&#44;
                from now unto eternity.&#34; You will see from the connexion of the ideas&#44; that
                as little as the word of God shall depart from us&#44; so shall the messenger of
                God&#44; the Goel who is to effect his will&#44; not remain absent when the
                transgressors in Jacob return to righteousness. There is no doubt expressed of this
                regeneration in spirit&#44; no more than this has been done by Moses&#59; it is
                certain&#44; it is in the nature of things&#44; it is the character of our
                people&#44; and therefore did God select us from all other nations to receive his

                say modern unbeliev&#8211; ers&#44; &#34; we want none of these things&#59; we are
                satisfied with freedom wherever we live&#59; we do not require sacrifices&#44; we do

                pray for a redemption&#44; they believe not in the future son of David who is to
                come&#44; and some of these men endeavour to taint others with their unbelief&#44;
                and to propagate through writing and speech their doctrines&#44; which are opposed
                to the letter and spirit of God&#39;s word which is to live forever. Now&#44; first
                as regards themselves&#44; the prophet Ezekiel already spoke of such as these when
                he said&#58; &#34;And I will select out from you those who rebel and &#40;wil&#8211;
                fully&#41; transgress against me&#59; from the land of their sojourning will I bring
                them out&#44; but to the land of Israel shall they not come&#44; and you shall know
                that I am the Lord.&#34; &#34;What they despise will not be given them&#44; and they
                will be deprived also of what they so ardently cling to. We may well leave their
                punish&#8211; ment in the hands of Him whose word will stand for&#8211; ever&#44; as
                He will prove on them likewise that He is the Lord. But as respects their ridicule
                of our hopes&#44; and their question how it is to be accomplished&#44; we would
                remark&#44; that had any one predicted in Egypt one hundred years before the birth
                of Moses&#44; that a child should be born to a Hebrew mother&#44; who would be
                educated by a daughter of Pharaoh as a prince in the royal palace&#44; that this

                overthrow the idols of Egypt&#44; effect the dismissal which he had asked&#44; and
                become finally the means of promulgating an im&#8211; perishable legislation &#58;

                ridi&#8211; culed for his insane ravings. Nevertheless&#44; all this took place&#44;
                and Moses&#44; though educated in the palace of Pharaoh&#44; never forgot his
                brothers who groaned under their burdens&#59; he forfeited his life to the laws of
                Egypt in the moment of uncontrollable indigna&#8211; tion&#44; when he struck a
                taskmaster who was beating an Israelite&#44; one of his own nation &#59; he came
                back&#44; and&#44; in the name of the eternal God&#44; did not beg for&#44; but
                required the dismissal of a slave&#8211;nation that built the towns and magazines of
                the mighty king&#59; he proved his right to be heard by signs and wonders&#44; which
                overcame at length the tyrant&#39;s stubborn will&#59; the idols of the people and
                the priests that served them were humbled before the prophet of the new God&#44; new
                to that age though the Creator of the world&#59; and at the foot of Sinai the
                redeemed heard the voice of the living God&#44; and they received through Moses the
                details of the law which has survived to this day&#44; and which from mere analogy
                we would be compelled to judge would outlast every new or con&#8211; temporaneous
                idea&#44; as it has done everything brought in competition with it hitherto. And
                after witness&#8211; ing all this great display of divine power in a manner so
                remarkable and striking&#44; shall we doubt that God can gather us again&#44; and

                all his word which He has spoken &#63; Moreover&#44; the progress of science is such
                at this day&#44; that it is scarcely possible to say what can be ac&#8211;
                complished through means of natural causes&#44; which operate in a manner which
                would have been deemed fabulous not a century ago. The exhibition of the natural
                miracles of electricity&#44; photography&#44; and il&#8211; lumination by gas and
                similar things would&#44; in the beginning of the last century&#44; have exposed the
                pos&#8211; sessor of these secrets of nature to the danger of beino&#8211; punished

                advent of the sprout from the root of Jesse&#44; under whom the outcasts of Israel
                will be gathered from the four corners of the earth&#44; in the land which was given
                to our father Abraham. Let us in the meanwhile&#44; however&#44; not be
                disheart&#8211; ened by the humble position which we occupy in the world&#44; nor by
                the disregard which our religion meets with from the majority of mankind. For it was
                the word of God&#44; which in olden days Isaiah was ordered to proclaim&#44; that
                all is perishable save itself alone. Do not fret&#44; therefore&#44; that you are
                few&#44; while the nations are many &#59; because the promise of the Lord is with
                you to save and shield you. Do not be dismayed that the churches of the various
                sects are spread over the land as the grass of the field&#44; while their towers

                of the gentile&#8211;crccds will vanish&#44; when the Lord will alone reign supreme

                because the wind of God will have blown upon them &#59; then will the tow&#8211;

                spirit will worship God alone&#44; at the time when He will send his messenger to
                redeem those who have waited for his salvation. And may He give to you all &#34;
                glory instead of ashes&#44; the oil of gladness instead of mourning&#44; the mantle
                of glory instead of a grieved spirit&#44;&#34; in the consolation of Jerusalem&#44;

                unite for the promotion of religion&#44; and to cultivate good feeling with all
                Israelites. This idea has been carefully kept in view&#44; and the result obtained
                has justified the movement&#44; which many looked on at first with jealousy and

                whose providence cares for all&#44; and whose omniscience surveys all the secrets of

                a new association of his adorers&#44; with our wives and little ones&#44; to declare
                that we also de&#8211; sire to be known as a special society among other communities
                of Israel&#44; as men devoted to that cause which was handed down from the most

                safe&#8211;keeping&#44; when we were assembled at the foot of Horeb&#44; until this
                hour when we are congre&#8211; gated in this house&#44; which we have called that of
                the True God&#44; of Him who was&#44; who is&#44; and who will be. It is&#44;
                therefore&#44; a momentous occasion which has called us together&#44; and it well
                deserves to be pondered on&#44; that it may never depart from our memory&#44; while

                &#34;And the children of Eeuben and the children of Gad called the altar
                &#40;Ed&#41; &#59; for &#40;they said&#41;&#44; It is a witness between us that the
                Eternal One is God.&#34; This passage occurs in one of the last chapters of the book
                of Joshua&#44; and is the conclusion of the his&#8211; tory of the altar which the
                two and half tribes&#44; whose domain was on the east side of the Jordan&#44; had
                erected on the bank of that river&#44; when they returned to their homes&#44; after
                having assisted the western tribes in con&#8211; quering the land of Canaan. It is
                well known to you&#44; that no altar was permitted to be erected in the whole
                country of Israel besides the one which was near the tabernacle&#44; and later&#44;
                the temple on Moriah. When&#44; therefore&#44; news was brought to the other
                Israelites of this occurrence&#44; they at once assembled at Shiloh to send out an
                army against what they thought the re&#8211; bellious tribes&#44; to coerce them to
                obedience. But be&#8211; fore proceeding to such extremes they despatched a
                deputation of eleven of the principal chiefs&#44; among whom was the zealous
                Phineas&#44; prudent as he was daring&#44; to remonstrate with the men of Reuben and
                their confederates on account of the great transgres&#8211; sion of which they
                presumed them guilty. These&#44; however&#44; answered deprecatingly&#44; and
                said&#44; &#34; The God of gods&#44; the Eternal One&#44; the God of gods&#44; the
                Eternal One&#44; He knoweth&#44; and Israel also shall know&#58; if it be in

                TRUE GOD. Lord &#40;aid us not this day&#41;&#44; that we have built us aij altar to
                turn away from following the Lord&#59; or if to ofier thereon
                burnt&#8211;offering&#44; or meat&#8211;offering&#44; or if to offer thereon
                peace&#8211;offerings&#44; may the Lord himself require it.&#34; In the same strain
                they continued to as&#8211; severate their good intentions&#44; and finished by
                saying that it should be regarded as a perpetual testimony between the portions of
                Israelites divided from each other by the Jordan&#44; that both the ones and the
                others believed in the same God&#44; whom they all then adored. And when Phineas and
                his companions had been gratified by this declaration of faith&#44; and had departed
                for their homes&#44; the trans&#8211;Jordanic tribes gave to the altar the name
                which designated it to be to them a testimony&#44; that in every possible
                contingency of life the Lord should be alone their God&#44; and that they would
                regard his altar at the tabernacle as the only centre of worship&#44; &#8212; thus
                pledging themselves to offer up their devotions solely after the manner laid down in
                the divine law. It is well to understand distinctly the condition of the world when
                the Reubeuites and their immediate confederates made this avowal &#58; The
                legislation of Sinai was yet new&#44; and they were only the second generation that
                had become familiar with it&#59; all around them&#44; nay&#44; in their own country
                and neighbourhood&#44; were many tribes that worshipped idols&#44; indulged in
                carnal practices interdicted by the Mosaic law&#44; and&#44; in brief&#44; were as
                different in thought and action from the standard of righteousness which they had
                themselves received&#44; as it is possible to be. They were&#44; therefore&#44;
                exposed through many tempta&#8211; tions to fall off by degrees from the road of
                life they had travelled under Moses and Joshua&#44; and to become <pb n="137"/> THE

                been bondmen&#44; or like the Canaanites&#44; among whom they then dwelt. It was no
                doubt this consideration which impelled the assembled Israelites at Sliiloh to
                endeavour to crush what they supposed the incipient infection of pagan life&#44; by
                a terrible blow&#44; though a universal carnage of the rebels might be the result.
                But the suspected tribes&#44; on the contrary&#44; then de&#8211; clared that they
                did not desire to multiply places of sacrifice&#44; after the manner of the
                idolaters&#44; who fan&#8211; cied that frequent acts of devotion&#44; performed in
                many places&#44; were requisite to propitiate their gods&#59; but that they
                would&#44; after the simpler fashion of the Scripture&#8211;commands&#44; resort
                only to the spot chosen by God out of all their tribes&#44; to offer up there&#44;
                and there alone&#44; all that had been commanded&#44; and just as it had been
                ordained &#59; and that the very altar they had erected on the banks of the
                Jordan&#44; standing&#44; as it should&#44; in solitude and silence&#44; without
                smoke to arise from its hearth&#44; without a priest to keep Avatch near it&#44;
                without the festive crowd to encamp in its precincts on the stated seasons of

                but which has&#44; alas &#33; so greatly waned in the troublous times through which

                faith has its enemies in the circumstance that we are still a peculiar people&#44;
                with laws which separate us from the board and commun&#8211; ion of
                non&#8211;Israelites &#59; in the fact that we adore a Name who is not yet enthroned

                equality&#44; and to grant us that weight in the historical development of the world
                which would of right be due to our industry&#44; probity&#44; and intelligence&#44;

                to&#44; in order to vex us with restraints and burdens from which others are

                the connexion with a people&#44; which the laws of the land and public prejudice
                stig&#8211; matize as inferior to the other classes of the inhabi&#8211; tants.
                Though millions of martyrs have at all periods of history testified by their

                capable to withdraw them from their God and his law&#58; still experience has proved

                apostates altogether&#44; or to shape their con&#8211; duct so that their Judaism
                was rendered undistin&#8211; guishable to the unpractised eye&#44; so that such as

                of the duties of Judaism&#44; and never having been imbued with the full force and

                process of spiritualizing those distinctive acts which&#44; by the scriptural
                enactments&#44; ought to distinguish the con&#8211; duct of every son of Israel.
                This latter species of apostacy is more common where we enjoy a moderate or entire

                excluded from par&#8211; ticipating in the privileges of citizenship. The very
                distance of the danger will bring us Avithin its grasp. Tell a man&#44; when he
                begins to acquire wealth and distinction&#44; that he has taken the first step to
                banish his sons from the precincts of the synagogue&#44; and he will exhibit all the
                appearances of offended rectitude. For he will tell you&#44; that he is engaged in a
                pursuit which will exhibit him to the world as an ornament to human nature&#59; that
                he trusts&#44; with the help of Heaven&#44; to prove what the Jew is capable of

                self&#8211;exaltation&#44; and a gradually increasing contempt for the association

                generations not one of them will be left to swear fealty to the Eternal God. Yet the
                transition was very slow at first&#59; in the beginning it was perhaps a

                position are thus lost to us &#59; many in inferior positions imitate the evil

                home where humble piety dwells&#44; and departing from the path of the law&#44; to
                their entire ruin. It is not nec&#8211; essary to produce illustrations from our

                to reflect on the work before us. We enter this day into a covenant with God&#44;
                tacitly&#44; if not in words&#44; to be faithful to Him&#44; and to preserve the law
                &#34; which is an inheritance of the con&#8211; gregation of Jacob&#34; for those
                who are to come after us. We bind ourselves&#44; by devoting this house espe&#8211;
                cially to the attribute of &#34; Truth&#44;&#34; which is the seal of the Creator
                under which He called the world into being&#44; that we will guard the faith with
                all our strength against the eiicroachment of error from whatever side this might
                tlireaten it&#44; and to show ourselves truthful in a singleness of devotion to the
                precepts we have received. We shall be indeed ap&#8211; proached with appeals as to

                antiquated notions and practices&#59; but this is the very purpose which ought to
                engage us &#59; and to succeed we ought to search into what has come down from the
                days of antiquity. Our very name is as ancient as history. Abraham was sur&#8211;
                named the Hebrew&#44; and this designation yet denotes his descendants&#59; Jacob
                was blest and called Israel&#44; and we are therefore the proper Israelites of whose
                future so much is said in the Holy Scriptures&#44; and of whom so many hopeful
                anticipations are entertained. It would be now insulting to sound human reason to
                pause here to prove that it would be impossible to preserve the identity of the
                Israelites without the bond of the law&#59; as&#44; without this&#44; they would
                soon cease to be distinguishable among the rest of man&#8211; kind&#44; and would
                thus disappear as agents from the work of history. But to check the deterioration
                which was just alluded to&#44; and to preserve the iden&#8211; tity of our race&#44;
                which many have lost already&#44; we ought to resort to those measures which were
                found so eiiicacious in the days of Hezekiah and Josiah&#44; kings of Judah&#44; and
                of Ezra and Nehemiah&#44; when the Babylonian captivity had been terminated by the
                rebuilding of the temple of Jerusalem. These means were&#44; first&#44; a greater
                cordiality among the people&#44; a more intimate union for the purpose of furthering
                the observance of the precepts of the Scriptures&#44; and&#44; secondly&#44; an
                earnest endeavour to render all more fomiliar with the contents of the Scriptures
                than they liad been before. At a future day we shall no doubt recur to this topic at
                greater length &#59; our present pur&#8211; pose is merely to sketch an outline of
                what is needed. When we were still under one government&#44; and had <pb n="144"/>

                of the state&#44; such as judges&#44; kings&#44; princes&#44; governors&#44; and
                high&#8211;priests&#44; could&#44; by their political power and influence&#44;
                contribute largely to the direct improve&#8211; ment of religion and morals &#59;
                hence we find that&#44; in proportion as our rulers were virtuous and pious&#44; the
                people were so likewise. But at present&#44; other in&#8211; fluences must be
                brought to bear on us&#44; and they are&#44; simply&#44; association and individual
                exertions. As re&#8211; gards the first&#44; let us observe that no matter how great
                a mind may dwell in any man&#44; he cannot labour ex&#8211; cept in a very limited
                sphere &#59; he can be only in one place at a time&#44; and he is therefore liable
                to be coun&#8211; teracted and defeated by the next comer&#44; not so much by the

                influence is over&#8211; come by&#44; perhaps&#44; the mere assurance and
                impudent&#44; bold&#44; assertions of the other. It is for this reason nothing
                new&#44; that public bodies exhibit the incon&#8211; stancy of the sea&#44; as they
                are swayed often&#44; not by a positive rule of right&#44; but by the opinion of the
                latest teacher. To avoid this uncertainty and constant fluc&#8211; tuation&#44; it
                is necessary to associate together on a basis of unvarying principles&#44; and to
                establish a rule which nothing shall be able to overthrow. You have at&#8211;
                tempted to carry this into practice&#44; my friends&#44; in the constitution you
                have adopted&#44; by laying down the irrevocable rule that you will&#44; as a
                body&#44; have only those prayers which the great lights of Israel delighted to
                employ in their addressing Him &#34; who sitteth on the throne of mercy&#59;&#34;
                and in so doing&#44; you also de&#8211; clare that you will faithfully and truly

                every one&#44; the righteous one and the sinner&#44; the son of Abraham and him
                whose parentage is not of Israel&#44; to offer up here their devo&#8211; tion&#44;
                and to pour out their heart before the Lord in joy or in sorrow &#59; since God
                himself has taught us that his house should be a house of prayer to all peo&#8211;
                ple. At the same time it has been resolved on wisely&#44; to exclude all from the
                control of affairs whose own conduct would stamp them as unfit to be trusted with a
                voice in the religious concerns of Israel. Having thus commenced&#44; let us hope
                that you will feel the weight of the obligation resting on you&#44; and that you
                will resolve to leave nothing untried to induce each other to be strict in the
                observance of all those duties in which so many are deficient&#44; especially the
                keeping of the Lord&#39;s Sabbath&#44; that this house may not be empty&#44; while

                public will and ought to go lirst forward. Whatever strikes either of you as useful
                and practicable&#44; he ought to bring before the com&#8211; munity and request in a
                courteous manner their co&#8211; operation &#59; and in case it does not meet with
                as prompt support as he has perhaps a right to expect&#44; he should endeavour to

                We are assembled here this day in accordance with the recommendation of the Governor
                of this com&#8211; monwealth&#44; who&#44; in conjunction with the chief mag&#8211;
                istrates of other states&#44; has set it apart as a day of thanking the Most High
                for the many benefits which He has bestowed on this land&#44; and to invoke the
                con&#8211; tinuance of his kindness. Although we Israelites have done this already
                on our own festivals which we lately celebrated&#44; especially on the Day of

                during the coming year&#44; and the Feast of Tabernacles&#44; when we returned
                thanks for the gifts which the past season had brous&#8211;ht us &#58; we still
                unite ourselves this day with our fellow&#8211;citizens of other persuasions to
                repair to the houses of our God&#44; to offer up to Him the grateful offering of our
                thankful hearts. For&#44; as we are the political equals with men of all creeds&#44;
                we must not be absent in any matter in which we have all a common interest&#44;
                although our religion makes it our duty to observe certain periods as especially
                devoted to the exercise of that obligation&#44; which the executives of various
                states in this country request the citizens at large to offer&#44; as a voluntary
                acknowl&#8211; edgment of their indebtedness at the close of the harvest&#44; when
                the abundant increase of the field has blessed the labour of the husbandman. The
                question then arises &#58; &#34;How shall we be thank&#8211; ful&#63;&#34; Is it
                enough that we resort to the places of devotion&#44; and recite there&#44; from
                burning lips&#44; a mul&#8211; titude of words which convey the expressions of
                grat&#8211; itude&#63; This would evidently not be enough&#59; for how often do the
                most fervent words leave the heart cold and unimpressed &#59; and even while a man
                in so many words acknowledges his dependence on divine bounty&#44; he may in his own
                heart ascribe his success to his own skill&#44; and his escape from evil to his own
                prudence. &#8212; How&#44; then&#44; shall we thank God&#63; To solve this question
                let us refer to the teaching of our prophets&#44; from whom we have in all cases
                ample directions for our conduct. When a portion of the people of Judah had been
                carried away as captives to Babylon&#44; at the time when the rest of our state was
                    <pb n="151"/> THE ISRAELITES&#39; THANKSGIVING. 151 hastening to decay&#44;
                Jeremiah sent to those exiled already a message to the effect that they should take
                an interest in their new home&#44; and then added &#58; &#34;And seek ye the welfare
                of the city whither I have banished you&#44; and pray in its behalf unto the Lord
                &#59; for in its welfare shall ye fare well&#44;&#34; or literally&#44; in the
                Hebrew idiom&#44; &#34;in its peace shall ye have peace.&#34; Jeremiah xxix. 7. It
                is thus made the duty of the Israelite to identify himself with the country in which
                he resides&#44; con&#8211; tribute to its prosperity&#44; and invoke Heaven&#39;s
                bless&#8211; ing for its welfare&#44; and&#44; in fulfilment of these duties&#44; he
                will best show himself grateful for the common blessings which he enjoys as a
                citizen&#44; and the pecu&#8211; liar privilege of being a son of Israel. Let
                us&#44; then&#44; trace the line of conduct he ought to pursue. This age is
                emphatically one of self&#8211;sufiiciency. Whatever is old meets with but little
                consideration&#44; and the wisdom of past ages is held in light esteem by those who
                now play their part on the earth. This has produced its mischievous influence on our
                relig&#8211; ious conformity&#59; since it is well known to you&#44; how httle we
                represent in our conduct the practices of our fathers. What they deemed as sacred is
                not regarded by many of us as such&#44; and defection meets us wher&#8211; ever we
                turn our view. But the same is the case in the political world. A constitution which
                was framed scarcely more than seventy years ago&#44; and was then justly esteemed as
                the perfection of human wisdom&#44; has already lost much of its power in a laud
                which it <pb n="152"/> 152 THE ISRAELITES&#39; THANKSGIVING. was calculated to
                bless&#44; and men who love change and excitement have&#44; by their unwise
                agitation&#44; brought this confederacy to the brink of dissolution &#59; and in
                this land where men fondly hoped that human free&#8211; dom might be firmly
                established for many centuries&#44; undisturbed by war&#39;s alarms&#44; we hear the
                rumbling of the distant thunder of tumult and strife spreading over once peaceful
                plains and securely sheltered val&#8211; leys.&#42; Why is this&#63; Because it is
                as though a skil&#8211; fully constructed machine had been placed in charge of an
                inexperienced boy&#44; who is totally ignorant of the levers&#44; valves&#44;
                pistons&#44; and wheels which are neces&#8211; sary for its government and
                safety&#44; and forces&#44; in his ignorance&#44; a stake or spike where it ought
                not to be&#44; in order to improve it&#44; and thereby causes an explo&#8211;
                sion&#44; which destroys the elegant fabric and himself likewise. It is the
                presumption&#44; then&#44; of those who are not satisfied with the amount of good
                they them&#8211; selves enjoy&#44; and thoughtlessly intermeddle with the rights of
                others&#44; which cannot&#44; after all&#44; injure them in any manner&#59; and this
                produces&#44; accordingly&#44; as its natural efiects&#44; the heartburning and
                strife which are manifest to all&#44; and the danger which even now threatens this
                land&#44; so much favoured in the fertility of the soil and the freedom of its
                institutions. Imagine not&#44; however&#44; my friends&#44; that I am going to make
                a political speech &#59; for this is not the place where it should be delivered&#44;
                nor do I think it my province to venture on the task. &#8212; But we have a

                &#59; and&#44; therefore&#44; we have also to see to it&#44; that we avoid
                contributing&#44; by any act of ours&#44; to injure the peace of the country where
                we are so pre&#8211;eminently blessed in the posses&#8211; sion of freedom. As
                citizens&#44; we should accordingly eschew all connexion with agitators&#44;
                who&#44; from ig&#8211; norance or selfishness&#44; might work injury to the
                com&#8211; monwealth. It is true&#44; our numbers are but small&#59; we can&#44;
                therefore&#44; exert but little influence on public afiairs&#44; and our weight can
                scarcely be felt. But&#44; for all this&#44; we should strive to show by our whole
                con&#8211; duct&#44; that we are fully alive to our duties&#44; and that we are
                willing to discharge all the obligations which can be expected of us. We should be
                distinguished for good citizenship&#44; so that&#44; though few&#44; we may be known

                Serve the country faithfully &#59; but to do so you need not be noisy in your
                demon&#8211; stration&#44; and by that means help to fan the flame of discord&#44;
                if it ever be kindled. But you should quietly fulfil your duties&#59; and&#44; above
                all&#44; be true to the com&#8211; monwealth in which you live&#44; and so demean
                your&#8211; selves&#44; that the name of Israel shall sufiter no damage at your
                hands&#44; and be assured that in this manner you will best discharge whatever you
                owe to your fellow&#8211; men in quality of citizens. This line of conduct is the
                more obligatory on us&#44; from the fact that the various states composing this
                Union are becoming more alive to the claim of Is&#8211; raelites to an absolute
                equality&#44; and of our being duly recognized on all public occasions. It was not
                long since that&#44; when some chief magistrates issued their proclamation for a
                thanksgiving&#44; or public fast&#8211;day&#44; they worded the same in such a
                manner that we felt ourselves naturally precluded from uniting with our
                fellow&#8211;citizens in their acts of devotion. But by a respectful insisting on
                our rights&#44; and not by noisy demonstration&#44; we have succeeded in this&#44;
                that in the greater part of the states we are invited with all others&#44; equally
                with all other denominations&#44; to re&#8211; turn our thanks&#44; or to offer up
                our prayers to our common heavenly Benefiictor&#44; and this simple change is to us
                a great cause of additional thankfulness&#44; and a real progress which God has
                obtained for us. It is&#44; therefore&#44; not too much for us to assert&#44; that
                it is highly probable that after a while our conduct as citi&#8211; zens&#44;
                provided it be all it should be&#44; will not fail to have its srood effects for the
                welfare of the state in which our lot is cast&#44; and that the morality which <pb
                    n="155"/> THE ISRAELITES&#39; THANKSGIVING. 155 distinguishes us as individuals
                may extend its bene&#8211; ficial influence on many beyond our own circle. Let us
                now revert to the effect of modern self&#8211;suffi&#8211; ciency on our religious
                state&#44; which affects us as Is&#8211; raelites particularly. It is&#44;
                indeed&#44;&#39;too lamentably true that many of us have learned to disregard all
                positive religious duties&#44; and they have made them&#8211; selves a new code of
                their own invention. They neg&#8211; lect the laws of the Most High&#44; and listen
                to the voice of the passions&#44; or their own private interests&#44; and reject all
                which does not coincide with their fancy. But not alone is this evil to be observed
                among the common people&#59; for among teachers likewise has the defection
                spread&#44; and the divine law is viewed as something which has ceased to have any
                real value&#44; which must yield to the wisdom of the present age. Nay&#44; what is
                more&#44; they treat it as already dead&#44; they subject it to their vain
                criticism&#44; and they submit it to their dissecting knife&#44; presumptuously
                selecting from the dissevered limbs what they imagine suitable for their
                purpose&#44; and then&#44; by a process of galvan&#8211; izing of their own&#44;
                they endeavour to recall these fragments into life. I tell you nothing unknown to
                yourselves&#44; my friends &#33; it is evident to you all&#44; and it is needless to
                hide the fact&#44; that this present cen&#8211; tury has seen the power of God&#39;s
                word gradually los&#8211; ing its influence over the minds of Israelites&#44;
                especial&#8211; ly in this country of universal freedom&#44; where it is our
                reproach that indifference to all that is sacred has reached its highest point. In
                many cases Hebrews seem ashamed of their faith&#44; and they so carefully conceal
                the practices which their religion justly de&#8211; mauds of them&#44; that they are
                only glad when their <pb n="156"/> 156 THE ISRAELITES&#39; THANKSGIVING. origin as
                Jews escapes the knowledge of those among whom they mingle. But is it reasonable
                that in this country and in this land we should thus exhibit our&#8211; selves
                before the Benefactor of Israel &#63; His revela&#8211; tion was to us a treasure in
                times of affliction&#44; when we were persecuted everywhere &#59; and to this day it
                has lost none of its sacredness and blissful efficacy&#44; if we would only listen
                to the wisdom of the past&#44; and follow the paths which our fathers have trod. In
                times gone by it was not granted to us to live in peace&#44; or to remain unharmed.
                The most absurd charges were invented against us&#44; and for their sake we had to
                endure the greatest tortures. And then compare with these trials the present change
                which has been wrought for us &#58; and I ask you&#44; Have we not cause to thank
                our God for the mercy He has shown us in breaking our chains&#44; and making us free
                &#63; Im&#8211; agine not&#44; my friends&#44; that it is merely the progress of
                civilization which has caused all this. For the change is too great to be merely
                human work. Cora&#8211; pare our present position with that in the Middle Ages&#44;
                when&#44; for instance&#44; the pestilence&#44; known as the Black Death&#44; swept
                over Europe&#44; and carried otf its millions of victims&#44; and when&#44; because
                compara&#8211; tively few Israelites perished&#44; it was charged against them that
                they had poisoned the sources of life&#44; the springs and wells whence the water
                for drinking was obtained&#44; in order to destroy the followers of Chris&#8211;
                tianity. It was nothing to the brutalized multitudes that the charge could not be
                true&#44; that many Jews&#44; too&#44; fell before the blows of the destroyer. And
                in all the towns along the Rhine&#44; in Switzerland and Germany&#44; the mob
                assailed our people&#44; who in vain <pb n="157"/> THE ISRAELITES&#39; TnANKSGIVING.
                157 called for protection from the magistrates&#44; and the only method they could
                find to escape from their law&#8211; less persecutors Avas to fall&#44;
                uncontaminated&#44; by their own hands&#44; so that the best gift which they could
                be&#8211; stow on their wives and children was to slay them themselves&#44; before
                they fell into the hands of those who had neither mercy nor pity&#44; and laughed
                with scorn over the misery of the helpless children of Is&#8211; rael. It was
                nothing rare then to see five hundred&#44; a thousand&#44; or two thousand Hebrews
                immolated in one day &#59; and yet they clung to their faith&#44; and went rejoicing
                to their end&#44; since thus they could show their firm adherence to the Guardian of
                Israel. Now&#44; compare the state just merely sketched with our present
                position&#44; where there is no distinction be&#8211; tween us and our
                fellow&#8211;citizens&#44; where we can as&#8211; semble in our synagogues and
                examine&#44; if we will&#44; without hindrance or molestation&#44; the religious
                sys&#8211; tems or dogmas of those differing from us &#58; and then say that we have
                not an especial cause of gratitude towards that Providence which has produced this
                wonderful change&#44; even without reverting to the bar&#8211; barities which were
                witnessed in Spain and Portugal&#44; where the adherents of our faith were
                systematically hunted down&#44; and tried as criminals for believing in the God of
                Israel. If even we concede much to the refinement produced by the spread of
                science&#44; it is&#44; after all&#44; more owing to the greater difiusion of the
                Scriptures&#44; which has humanized mankind&#44; and broken the bonds of tyranny. Do
                we&#44; therefore&#44; do well&#44; when&#44; in the midst of freedom&#44; we forget
                our Benefactor&#44; and turn our back on the precepts which He has prescribed for us

                it must be evident to you&#44; from what has been said already&#44; that we cannot
                walk erect in the path of virtue&#44; if we ascribe the success of the government to

                blessed you here. When you sit among persons of a diflterent belief&#44; partake not
                of their viands from complacency or to hide your own convictions. Re&#8211;

                from such society&#44; when you would have been avoided because of your origin.

                persuasions&#44; without yielding in the least your duty from a mere complaisance to
                their prejudices&#59; be firm&#44; and sacrifice your appetite on the altar of your
                religion. For only when you are consistent Israelites in your own persons&#44; and
                when you train your children to continue worthily after your decease the noble race
                of the Patriarchs&#44; can you be deserving of the many favours which you have
                received from the Lord. Then only can you properly fulfil the duties of

                ISRAEL AND CIVILIZATION.&#42; Brethren and Friends &#33; We are met here this
                afternoon to dedicate to the God of Israel this roomy structure which you have
                ac&#8211; quired as your house of prayer. The old building in which you have
                hitherto worshipped has become too small and too inconvenient for the numbers who
                geek it to unite in prayer to your God and Creator&#44; and the large assembly now
                present testifies that you rejoice because the work you contemplated has been
                accomplished. But in this feeling of pious content&#8211; ment&#44; you must not
                forget for what purpose you ded&#8211; icate&#44; nor be unmindful of Him for whose
                glory you devote it. It is the Lord our God who is to be adored here&#44; and it is
                his law which is to be taught here&#59; and yet He is not alone your God&#44; but
                the God of all the earth&#44; the Sovereign of the whole universe &#58; how solemn
                then the thought&#44; that we mortals erect to Him a dwelling&#44; devote to Him a
                spot on his earth as a particular sanctuary. Let us however resort as nsual to the
                Creator&#39;s own teaching&#44; to his Scriptures&#44; to see what they tell us&#44;
                and connect therewith the remarks proper for this occasion. When Solomon had built
                his house to the Mighty One of Jacob&#44; when &#42; spoken at the dedicadon of the

                and glory&#44; he even then felt the inadequacy of human labour to be prop&#8211;
                erly acceptable to God&#44; and thus he spoke in the words which we have just
                read&#58;&#42; &#34; For in truth will God then dwell on earth &#63; behold&#44; the
                heav&#8211; ens and heavens of heavens cannot contain Thee&#44; how much less then
                this house which I have built.&#34; 1 Kings viii. 27. Indeed&#44; if we inquire of
                human reason&#44; whether it would be proper to erect a house for the residence of
                the divine glory&#44; we should be induced to pretermit our intention &#59; since
                the Incorporeal cannot be con&#8211; fined within any limits&#59; and thus we would
                never dedicate any houses to the worship of God&#44; as the wide space of the
                plains&#44; and the expanse of ocean are equally his with all the structures human
                inge&#8211; nuity can contrive. Wherever we turn our view&#44; we have the
                Lord&#39;s possessions before us&#44; we ourselves are a portion of his wealth.
                Nothing of which we have a conception as existing but belongs to the Lord &#59;
                wherefore we can give Ilim nothing&#44; nor dedicate to him auo&#59;ht that is not
                his alreadv. But we Israelites do not govern ourselves by reason only&#44; we resort
                for instruction to the revelation which has been com&#8211; municated to us from
                Sinai&#44; and there we find it re&#8211; corded that we are permitted to erect
                houses to the name of God&#44; where we are promised that He will be more
                immediately among us than elsewhere&#44; in a manner which we cannot explain. So
                also with re&#8211; &#42; I had just read&#44; as a part of the dedicatory
                service&#44; 1 Kings viii. 22&#8211;44. <pb n="166"/> 166 ISRAEL AND CIVILIZATION.
                gard to prayer &#58; the Omniscient is conscious of all our wants before we arrange
                even our thoughts into entreaty&#59; our words are not needed to enlighten his
                understanding of our requirements and hopes&#59; where&#8211; fore cold human reason
                would likewise absolve us from the duty of prayer as useless and presumptuous. But
                revelation teaches us by the words of Deut. iv. 7 &#58; &#34; For what great nation
                is there that hath gods so nigh unto it&#44; as is the Lord our God at all times
                that we call upon Ilim &#63;&#34; that we should apply to our Father above in all
                relations of life in the words of prayer&#44; in order that we may be relieved of
                our bur&#8211; den&#44; and obtain his almighty aid. We therefore are permitted to
                erect houses&#44; not to inclose the illimita&#8211; ble One within limits&#44; but
                to have a home for his law&#44; where we may assemble to be instructed in order to
                feel the influence of his divine spirit &#59; we are allowed to pray&#44; in order
                that we may be convinced that our enlargement is not the result of our skill and
                labour&#44; but the immediate effect of the providence of the Lord&#44; through
                whose beneficence we exist. We there&#8211; fore&#44; as permitted by the highest
                Authority&#44; dedicate these walls as a. house of assembly for the children of
                Israel dwelling in this place&#44; that from it the law may go forth&#44; and they
                may be enlightened with re&#8211; gard to the deeds they should perform&#44; and
                encourage each other to be true to the law which has been con&#8211; fided to us as
                our inheritance&#44; which hitherto has been and hereafter shall be transmitted as
                the heirloom of the congregation of Jacob. Though thus the law is primarily our own
                property&#44; it was not confided to us for our exclusive benefit. When it was
                proclaimed from the summit of Horeb&#44; while the heavenly fires <pb n="167"/>
                ISRAEL AND CIVILIZATION. 167 blazed out with intense brightness&#44; and outward
                na&#8211; ture was convulsed to its centre&#44; the world lay shrouded in the
                deepest gloom. Knowledge of Truth was nowhere &#59; in every direction were
                false&#8211; hood and superstition worshipped&#44; while the rights of man were
                disregarded by all governments&#44; and irreligion and tyranny ruled hand in hand.
                But when the Lord in his might had broken our chains&#44; and led us through his
                messenger Moses to the foot of Horeb&#44; He himself enlightened our
                understanding&#44; and not in uncertain and painful researches&#44; but in a direct
                and audible manner He made the truth known to us&#44; when He spoke these
                significant words &#58; &#34; I am the Eternal thy God who have brought thee out of
                the land of Egypt&#44; from the house of bondage.&#34; Wise men of many nations&#44;
                especially among the Greeks and Ro&#8211; mans&#44; such as Socrates&#44; Plato&#44;
                Aristotle&#44; and Cicero&#44; painfully strove to know what God is &#59; but they
                always failed&#44; though often they approached the truth. And so it would have been
                yet&#44; had men been left to search for the precious truth unaided. But when our
                fathers were assembled to receive the law&#44; with their wives and little ones&#44;
                their servants and maid&#8211;servants&#44; their hewers of wood and drawers of
                water&#44; their under&#8211; standing was in a moment instructed in the highest
                truth&#44; and they were taught that all this vast universe&#44; these seas and

                constellations and suns in their infinite courses around which other planets than

                of the One and only God&#44; whose visible glory was then made manifest to their

                their hands at that time and that place&#44; has been preserved by them through all
                the vicissitudes they have had to encounter&#44; and neither joys nor sor&#8211;
                rows have been able to unloose their hold thereof&#44; and it is theirs this
                day&#44; of which the assembly pres&#8211; ent is the witness&#59; since the house
                in which we are is devoted to the same Eternal One who made his will and his name
                known to our ancestors in the desert of Iloreb&#44; If men should now question us as
                to what we have done for the collective mass of mankind &#63; we will an&#8211; swer
                them&#44; that we have been faithful guardians of the divine truth&#44; the first
                promulgators of universal charity&#44; the first to set a barrier to tyranny&#44;
                and the first to base the happiness of society on equitable laws&#44; protecting
                equally the rights of all classes of the inhabitants of the land. We have not been
                distin&#8211; guished&#44; it is true&#44; for our discoveries in philosophy nor for
                our achievements in arms&#44; nor in the pleasant fields of poetry and the fine
                arts&#44; nor have we enriched the world by our inventions&#44; especially not of

                but our con&#8211; tribution to the common stock has been the highest for the

                to pro&#8211; duce yet more glorious results than have been wit&#8211; nessed
                hitherto. Thirty&#8211;five centuries have elapsed since this code was communicated
                &#59; but every passing moment adds its testimony to its exceeding worth&#44; <pb

                mysteries of sci&#8211; ence&#44; the more will they become convinced of its truth
                and beauty. And whether it is recognized or not&#44; it underlies the legislation of
                all civilized states&#44; and the closer its precepts are followed&#44; the better
                will human happiness be promoted. At its first in&#8211; ception it overcame the
                idols of Egypt&#44; while their worshippers were compelled in the agony of their
                suffering to acknowledge the supremacy of the Mighty One of Israel. The process of
                time&#44; on the other hand&#44; beholds the triumphant advance of the Scrip&#8211;
                tures &#59; for whether they are in the original language&#44; as with us&#44; or in
                one of the many tongues spoken by men&#44; they are steadily chasing away the gloom
                of mental darkness from the human mind&#44; and implant&#8211; ing gradually the
                soothing principles of universal love which they inculcate. For go into the
                cathedral of the Catholic&#44; the church of the Episcopalian&#44; the
                meeting&#8211;house of the Dissenter&#44; or the mosque of the Mahoraedau&#44; and
                you will hear propounded doctrines which sprung from our law&#59; and though they
                may not have come from us directly&#44; they are nevertheless an emanation from the
                same source whence we derive our guide of life &#58; and thus we utter no idle boast
                when we maintain&#44; that the civilizing principle which is gradually spreading
                over the earth came from us as its centre&#44; and we have performed a true service
                to all men&#44; by preserving the law during all the trials which we had to
                endure&#44; in order to retain it pure and undefiled as we had received it. Whatever
                morality exists is moreover clearly traceable to our own &#59; no practical rule of
                life has been invented or developed which has not its origin in our code &#59; if

                which has been excited against ns in all ages is thus proven to be extremely
                unjust&#59; for instead of our being a burden on society&#44; we have been its
                greatest benefactors. And still how long is it since we were spurned everywhere as

                for some fancied oftence against state and individuals&#44; which was for&#8211;
                eign to his heart and feeling. Nevertheless&#44; he bore it all with patience&#44;
                because he endured it in the de&#8211; fence of that priceless law which had been
                intrusted to his safe keeping. And he has lived to see the Scriptures diffused all
                over the earth&#44; and to hear everywhere rising on High the Psalms and prayers of

                No&#44; friends&#44; it is not the size and elegance of the building which will

                CIVILIZATION. we cannot deny&#44; and wish not to conceal it&#44; that we are in an
                antagonistic position with the vast majority of mankind. Though they have derived
                their re&#8211; ligion from the Bible&#44; they have not adopted the One Lord as the
                God of their worship. They believe in a divided godhead&#44; or&#44; as they term
                it&#44; in a triune God&#44; while we believe in an absolute Unity&#44; without a
                possible division of persons or powers&#44; having full faith that all the acts of
                God are manifestations of the same undivided&#44; indivisible One&#44; who is at the
                same time Creator&#44; Governor&#44; and Saviour of all whom He has called into
                being. But while we thus boldly dis&#8211; sent&#44; we are not permitted to hate or
                persecute an&#8211; other for differing from us in opinion. The religion we profess
                we conceive to be our peculiar inheritance&#59; but we deny the hope of salvation to
                no one who ful&#8211; fils the duties of humanity which are incumbent on all men
                alike. If you are then told thai Israelites have ever been persecutors of their
                fellow&#8211;raen&#44; do not believe it&#59; we never forced our faith on
                others&#59; and the few instances which are recorded against us&#44; and which
                apparently prove the contrary&#44; can easily be explained so as to remove the
                charge from us when it is clearly presented&#59; but I have not time enough
                to&#8211; day to enter into a discussion which would&#44; besides&#44; be foreign to
                my present object. All that is neces&#8211; sary now is to enter an emphatic denial
                against the assumptions often made&#44; and which have been em&#8211; ployed to
                justify the horrible cruelties inflicted on us&#44; for our adherence to the faith
                of our ancestors. For our part&#44; however&#44; though we are fully convinced of
                the truth of our belief&#44; which excludes confidence in any other&#44; and
                prevents us to give our assent to any <pb n="173"/> ISRAEL AND CIVILIZATION. 173
                other&#44; we do not presume to limit the mercy of God. He has bestowed on us his
                law&#44; by which alone we can obtain salvation &#59; it was given to us to guard it
                against all assaults&#44; under all circumstances&#59; but this authorizes us not to
                exclude from our kindness those who are not inheritors of this religion. We should
                emulate herein his ways of mercy. He is a universal God&#44; and his sun shines
                equally for the Turk and Hin&#8211; doo as for the Hebrew&#44; and his rain falls on
                sea and dry land&#44; and refreshes the barren wastes of Siberia&#44; as well as the
                fertile plains of America&#44; and the des&#8211; erts of Arabia no less than the
                savannas of the new world. Everywhere the evidences of his bounty meet our eyes.
                Why&#44; then&#44; shall we hate and injure those who have not been taught as we
                have been &#63; Why should not one human being tolerate all who share not his
                convictions &#63; Still we will not conceal that we look forward for the time when
                the holy Name whom we adore shall be sanctified by the mouth of all men&#59; when
                the veil shall be removed from all eyes&#44; which shall see the divine glory
                revealed unto them with that certainty and undying conviction as was done to our
                fathers&#44; when they marched forth into the wilderness to enter on their wonderful

                willingly before its all&#8211;conquering power. We have given you thus&#44; my
                non&#8211;Jewish hearers&#44; a brief sketch of our faith&#44; and of the views
                which we entertain towards those who differ from us. Let me now appeal to you to
                discard the unworthy pre&#8211; judices which many have been taught to entertain
                against us. Excluded so long from the sympathies of mankind&#44; it is but natural
                that many of us should have acquired habits not altogether commendable. But it is
                wrong to charge this fault upon all Israelites&#44; as though all had sinned. The
                name of Jew has even become unjustly a term of reproach&#44; although it has an
                honourable origin &#59; since Leah when she had borne his fourth son to Jacob&#44;
                called him Judah &#40;whence the name of Jew was by various changes
                derived&#41;&#44; &#34; because this time will I thank the Lord&#44;&#34; feeling
                grateful for the favour of being the mother of so many sons of the patriarch. We may
                have lost much of our ancient high character through the course of so many terrible
                sufferings. But the heart of the Hebrew is still the seat of kindness&#59; distress
                always appeals to him in tones he cannot resist&#44; and few of us are ever guilty
                of violent robbery or of imbruing their hands in a fellow&#8211;man&#39;s blood.
                Even when we were expelled from our homes&#44; and were forced to wander abroad in
                misery and poverty&#44; we turned not round on our assailants and plunged our dagger
                into their heart. The banner which we received from Sinai has not been stained by
                treason &#59; yet its white folds bear many a mark of blood&#44; but it issued from
                the wounds in our own heart&#59; the life&#8211;gore of Israel&#39;s sons and
                daughters has left there its fearful traces&#44; <pb n="175"/> ISRAEL AND

                inflicted in our bosoms by the deadly weapons of our adversaries&#44; who slew
                without mercy those who would not relinquish their belief&#8211; to the demands of
                those who for the time bore rule over them&#44; and whose favour could easily have
                been con&#8211; ciliated&#44; had they consented to forsake the God of their
                fathers&#44; and united themselves with those around them. We also as a class are
                faithful to the govern&#8211; ments under which we live&#59; and although until
                lately we were nearly everywhere excluded from the rights of citizenship and

                the battle&#8211; fields of contending nations&#44; even where the combat was not
                for the rights of man&#44; but the ambition of opposing potentates. And in the
                fearful struggle which now afflicts this land&#44; our victims have not been
                wanting&#44; who hastened to embark their lives and fortunes at the call of the
                authorities. Our hearts al&#8211; ways pulsate with the purest and noblest
                sentiments&#44; and we will not teach our children to hate their fel&#8211;
                low&#8211;men. We will indeed tell them how much we suf&#8211; fered from
                persecution&#44; what cruelties were causelessly inflicted on us&#59; yet not that
                they might hate others&#44; but that they may be induced to love with deep

                many suffered&#44; that it might be preserved untarnished for them and their
                descendants forever&#44; and to bring pure civilization to all mankind. We will

                by the arts of peace. But we have also a hope for the future. We con&#8211; fidently
                expect that the time will come when warfare and oppression will cease
                everywhere&#59; when peace shall reign triumphant under the rule of the Prince

                Isaiah says&#44; meaning that no carnal weapon will henceforth be needed to enforce
                justice and protect the innocent. And as Ezekiel &#40;xxxiv. 25&#41; says&#58;
                &#34;And they shall dwell in the wilderness in safety&#44; and sleep in the
                forests.&#34; Who can now lie down in safety in the depth of the forest&#63; is he
                not in danger from the fang of the poisonous serpent&#63; the claws of the
                bloodthirsty tiger&#63; the talons of the lordly lion &#63; and more yet from the
                cunning and malice of his fellow&#8211;man&#44; who lies in wait for him to rob him
                of his treasures&#44; or to aim at his life&#63; Yet at that glorious time all shall
                be peace and safety&#59; but it will only be when the law of God has conquered all

                satisfy himself not less than others that he is in possession of the truth. If our
                system were simply the product of modern days&#44; or a mere human invention&#44; it
                might not be of such absorbing impor&#8211; tance to investigate and defend it &#59;
                but we claim for it another origin&#44; and&#44; therefore&#44; cannot consent to
                let ourselves be deprived of the same by any agency whatever&#59; and as the human
                mind is apt to indulge in doubts&#44; we should take heed that we may obtain the
                means to remove them&#44; that they may not perma&#8211; nently influence our
                thoughts and actions. If a thing is true&#44; it is not so only for the time
                be&#8211; ing&#44; but in all other conceivable periods. If the law of Israel
                was&#44; therefore&#44; true at the time it was pro&#8211; mulgated&#44; it must be
                so now&#44; and at any period here&#8211; after&#59; and if we can show that in its
                details it has proved itself true&#44; that it has announced nothing which time has
                overthrown &#58; we may freely dismiss all misgiving&#44; and avow our steady
                adherence to the same. The lesson which we have read this day&#44; from the
                Pentateuch&#44; embraces the last admonition which Mo&#8211; ses addressed to the

                where he ended his mortal career. In this admonition he told the people what the
                future would bring forth for them. He warned them against transgressing the law&#44;
                and at the same time announced that&#44; in case they were to do so&#44; the direst

                and individually &#59; for that the disregard of the divine precepts would assuredly
                draw after it &#34;all the curses that are written in that book of the law&#34;
                which he had just completed&#44; and given into the cus&#8211; tody of the people as
                their common and permanent property. He foresaw the commonwealth of Israel disrupted
                by internal rottenness&#44; consequent on an abandonment of the path which he had
                been the means of marking out for the guidance of the people &#58; still he
                said&#44; in connexion with the work he was about completing&#44; that it should be
                written down for a memorial&#44; &#8212; &#34;For it shall not be forgotten out of
                the mouth of his seed.&#34; Deut. xxxi. 21. Was this an idle boast &#63; Was it
                merely a love for his own institutions which induced Moses thus to speak &#63; If
                so&#44; the events of history would have con&#8211; tradicted him&#44; and proved

                devotion to a cause which he had espoused&#44; but nothing more. Yet what has the
                world witnessed in this respect&#63; Has the law of Moses&#44; as it is called&#44;
                perished &#63; or&#44; rather&#44; has the divine revelation of Sinai ceased out of
                the mouth of Abraham&#39;s descendants&#63; By no means&#59; trials of joy and

                still the law is unforgotten. We lived respected and pow&#8211; erful in our
                land&#44; under the banner of our faith&#44; and we have been plucked thence by the

                the code of Sinai is unfor&#8211; gotten. The prediction&#44; therefore&#44; has not
                the char&#8211; acter of an enthusiastic excitement&#44; but that of an absolute
                certainty&#44; which has been confirmed by the experience of mankind. The Israelites
                have well understood also the task which this divine inheritance has imposed on them
                &#59; they have not rested satisfied with the mere posses&#8211; sion of it&#44;
                they have&#44; on the contrary&#44; done everything to perpetuate it among
                themselves. They have made it their daily study and their nightly meditation. Every
                act of their lives has reference to its spirit and teaching&#44; and it thus has
                become incorporated with their very being. It is constantly perused both at home and
                in our public assemblies&#59; and once a year&#44; thus have our wise men
                ordained&#44; should it be read through&#44; assigning a portion to every
                Sabbath&#44; that it may be kept unceasingly fresh in our memory. &#34;We may have
                heard the lesson before&#44; but still it conies ever with the force of a new
                conviction to enlighten our understanding. We are not&#44; however&#44; to content
                ourselves with having the weekly lesson read to us in synagogue only&#44; but we
                should previously at home compare the text with a translation&#44; that the
                words&#44; when proclaimed in public&#44; shall not fail to make their full
                impression on our mind. It requires no long argument to prove both the propriety and
                the necessity of the reading of the law as we do. If we were to parcel it out in
                small sections&#44; and consume years in its perusal&#44; is it not likely that the
                law might gradually fade from our memory&#63; If there were no incentive to study
                it&#44; it would be neglected&#59; and when the practice of religion should have

                familiar to them from their infancy&#44; without any particular trouble or
                exertion&#44; and the continual annual repetition of the instruction in their

                thus the youth and the hoary head had the same knowledge and the same incentive to
                act&#44; and to remain faithful to the same standard. Understand&#44; it is not
                merely the hearing of the text in Hebrew which has eftected this&#44; or can do so
                hereafter&#44; it is the understanding of what is read alone which can produce any
                good result&#59; hence the necessity for imparting a knowledge of the holy
                language&#44; that it may be familiar to our people&#44; so that they can listen to
                it with understanding and pleasure. But even when this is not attainable&#44; the
                facilities have been provided by our pious and learned men to render the Scriptures
                accessible to all&#44; with&#8211; out distinction of class &#59; from the earliest
                period of our exile efforts have been made&#44; and this with the greatest
                success&#44; to make the sense of the holy Word clear to the commonest
                intellect&#44; and all who will&#44; can approach the sacred fountain and satisfy
                their thirst for knowledge. Thus has Judaism not been at any time the property of
                any favoured caste &#59; no one had to unlock the holy treasure for the com&#8211;
                munity at large&#59; for all were the common owners of the inheritance of Jacob&#44;
                and could and did participate in its benefits. The reading&#44; accordingly&#44; of
                the law and the sections of the prophets&#44; as a part of our devotional

                fasts&#44; and festivals&#44; must induce the people at large to desire to become
                constantly more thoroughly familiar with them. We hold the simple Word itself more

                lesson now and then is all that is needed to remind them of its existence&#44; can

                with it&#44; which is so strik&#8211; ingly the case with our gentile

                the way of forgetting it likev7ise. The practice handed down to us is the one which
                both safety and prudence must recommend&#44; and let us endeavour to contribute our

                    n="183"/> THE LAW TESTED. 183 the men who devoted their lifetime to the
                illustration and fixing of the holy Text. They counted the verses&#44; words&#44;
                and letters of the Scriptures&#44; and left us di&#8211; rections how they were to
                be written and read. Some may think it a trifling with sacred things&#44; to inform
                you gravely how many times a certain word or letter re&#8211; curs in the Bible. But
                reflect&#44; on the other hand&#44; that if we have clear directions how our
                forefathers wrote and preserved the Scriptures&#44; we have an infallible guide to
                demonstrate at any time the falsehood of any pretended additions which any one may
                offer for our acceptance. The record of these critical notes&#44; called the
                Massorah&#44; is thus the most valuable criterion which can be devised for the
                maintenance of the purity of the divine revelation&#44; and we have in this wise
                been enabled to preserve it pure and unsullied throughout the long ages of
                persecution which we had to encounter. Should ever&#44; by any combination of
                circumstances&#44; all the Hebrew manuscripts be lost&#44; the Massorah would enable
                us to restore the text in all its perfection. For the very grammatical devia&#8211;
                tions&#44; as some consider them&#44; are parts of the text as received by us&#44;
                and are noted as correct in this tradi&#8211; tional criticism&#44; and are&#44;
                therefore&#44; necessary to com&#8211; plete the Bible&#44; and to render it just so
                as our fathers have left it to us. We must&#44; accordingly&#44; admire the
                singleness and simplicity of their devotion for the truth&#44; that they laboured so
                zealously and at the same time so successfully to hand down to the latest
                gener&#8211; ations&#44; unabridged and unaltered&#44; the divine legacy as they had
                received it&#44; and with such safeguards as will protect it&#44; provided it is

                happened that&#44; even in those ages when books could be multiplied only by the
                slow and laborious process of manuscript copying&#44; the Hebrew Scriptures
                maintained their remarkable uniformity to such an extent&#44; that no reasonable man
                can doubt the identity of the text from the most re&#8211; mote period with that now
                in our possession &#59; and it was&#44; under Providence&#44; all the work of those
                vigilant teachers who taught the people the facts and words of the Bible&#44; so
                that they became incorporated with the very being of Israel&#44; and could&#44;
                therefore&#44; not be forgotten. It was thus that in the darkest periods of
                persecution and general ignorance&#44; the Israelites were always an educated and
                enlightened people&#44; and far above the average of their contemporaries&#59; and
                though at present literature has received&#44; by means of the printing art&#44; the
                greatest diffusion&#44; let us not despise and esteem lightly the instrument and the
                men who served us so well and so disinterestedly in the hour of trial&#44; although
                the great multiplication of copies of the Scriptures seems to secure us against the
                danger of forgetting them utterly&#44; or of accepting spurious editions as the
                correct transcript of the Di&#8211; vine Word. For even on the score of
                prudence&#44; it is advisable to be armed against all contingencies&#44; so as to be
                ready with the best means of defence when they may have to be called into effective
                service&#44; and to guard our sacred treasure against all interpolations&#44;
                additions&#44; or arbitrary amendments&#44; which may be proposed at any time
                hereafter. The law&#44; being thus the inheritance of Jacob&#39;s chil&#8211;

                the freedom from restraint which they witnessed among their gen&#8211; tile
                neighbours&#59; perhaps the general prosperity which they had enjoyed undermined
                their morals&#44; and they therefore indulged in matters which the law
                interdict&#8211; ed. What Moses had foretold unto them occurred &#58; hostile
                nations invaded the land of Palestine&#44; and one portion after the other was swept
                clear of its popula&#8211; tion&#44; and we learned too late the ditierence
                between&#44; bearing the easy yoke of Heaven to wearing the chains which our
                conquerors fastened on our limbs. And wo then went forth into captivity&#44; and on
                the banks of the streams of Babylon we hung up our once tuneful harps&#44; and it
                was in vain that our cap&#8211; tors demanded of us to waken their mute chords with
                the songs of Zion. How could we sing the solemn melodies which filled formerly the
                courts of the tem&#8211; ple&#44; when the joyous multitudes of the sons of Israel
                had assembled to worship the Most High &#63; Was not his house a desolate heap &#63;
                Were not his priests ban&#8211; ished from their station &#63; Were not the people
                of God driven forth into exile and bondage for their manifold transgressions&#63;
                No&#44; our song was hushed&#44; and on the soil of the stranger the once free heart
                of Judah refused to respond to the demand of the con&#8211; querors&#44; and we
                could not forget Jerusalem&#44; the for&#8211; mer crown of our glory. And thus
                again was the blessed promise fulfilled&#44; that the law should not be forgotten
                from the mouth of our descendants. In Palestine we grievously oflfended our heavenly
                Fa&#8211; ther&#44; we provoked Him by our misdeeds&#44; we defied his anger&#59;

                amalgamating&#44; like other con&#8211; quered nations&#44; with those who had
                subdued us. The law&#44; the customs&#44; the psalmody&#44; all that
                character&#8211; ized ancient Israel&#44; became doubly dear to us&#44; and from the
                wreck of our state we saved our relisrion&#44; and it has accordingly preserved us
                intact and uncon&#8211; querable to this day. And when the period of the Babylonian
                captivity had elapsed&#44; a remnant returned to Palestine&#44; and while rearing
                again the walls of the sacred edifice&#44; we laid deeper and broader the
                foun&#8211; dations of our faith&#44; and it has stood the test of the sorest trials
                which the world has ever witnessed&#44; and it has survived&#44; and it has
                sustained us in our separate national existence&#44; the wonder and the envy of
                those who love not the name of Israel &#59; and we have every reason to hope
                confidently&#44; that no event hereafter will be able to effect what all preceding
                human exer&#8211; tions have failed to accomplish&#44; &#8212; the obliteration of
                the law from the mouth and heart of Jacob&#39;s latest descendants. We are thus
                here&#44; brethren&#44; at this distance of time&#44; to avow our adherence to our
                holy and unforgotten Law&#44; practically the same Israel as we were many centuries
                ago. The joyous events which were expe&#8211; rienced in our history have not
                destroyed the strength of our national character&#59; and the trials to which other
                people succumbed have&#44; it is true&#44; left their ter&#8211; rible traces&#44;
                but they have not consumed us utterly&#44; and we have preserved the testimony of
                God&#44; uncor&#8211; rupted and unchanged&#44; as it was delivered to us by our
                great prophet&#44; who&#44; dying&#44; constituted the whole people its guardians.
                And soon we shall enter on a <pb n="187"/> THE LAW TESTED. 187 new year&#44; when we
                shall assemble again in the houses dedicated to God&#44; to declare Him anew the
                glorious King of Israel and the Sovereign of the universe. But take heed that you
                bring not a false offering when you approach God&#39;s sanctuary&#59; let your heart
                be in unison with your professions&#44; and feel the. greatness of the privilege in
                being permitted to adore the One who dwells to eternity. Reflect that when Moses had
                admonished his hearers&#44; he gave them the choice between right and wrong&#44;
                life and death&#44; and urged them to choose life. He stood there as the
                represen&#8211; tative of the Most High&#44; and exclaimed&#44; in the height of his
                inspired enthusiasm&#44; &#34;I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you this
                day&#44; that I have set be&#8211; fore you life and death&#44; the blessing and the
                curse &#59; therefore&#44; choose thou life&#44; in order that thou mayest live&#44;

                adjure them by human love or mortal aspiration&#44; not by anything man in his eager
                pursuit values or desires &#59; but he called on the ever&#8211; lasting creatures
                of God to watch over the upholding of the Lord&#39;s covenant by the people to whom
                it bad been intrusted. The everlasting Word is to be guard&#8211; ed by the
                creatures which are imperishable in their nature&#44; unless destroyed by the Power
                which has called them forth &#59; they survive nations and their works &#59; they
                are always present to tell the glory of their Maker&#44; and to proclaim his might
                and wisdom. If kingdoms rise&#44; become powerful&#44; and fall again into
                decay&#44; the earth itself undergoes no change&#44; it responds to the labour of

                engulfed in its waves. So does the sun shine for a perpetual light by day&#44; and
                the sweet ef&#8211; fulgence of the moon and the glitter of the stars guide the
                traveller by land and sea during the hours of night Everywhere are these witnesses
                of God with us&#44; and from the beginning their laws were es&#8211; tablished&#44;
                which nothing can trespass. We speak of changes&#44; of revolutions&#44; of
                progress&#44; and improve&#8211; ments&#59; but the ordinances of nature&#44; as
                decreed by the Almighty at the beginning&#44; are still the same as they were when
                first implanted in all things. So it is fitting that they should testify to the
                eternal Word which&#44; spoken at Sinai&#44; has sped onward on its mis&#8211;
                sion&#44; and still continues to enlighten the hearts of all believers. Whatever it
                has suftered has not weak&#8211; ened the force of its truth&#44; and however often
                we have transgressed and rebelled&#44; it has stood unmoved&#44; despite of our
                unwillingness to labour for its advance&#8211; ment. Heaven and earth have not
                passed away&#44; and the law also has survived all the shocks to which it has been
                subjected&#44; unscathed and eternally the same. Perhaps you may say that the earth
                and heaven are but silent creatures&#44; and cannot speak&#44; and are there&#8211;
                fore improperly summoned as witnesses for or against any one. But it is only in a
                metaphorical sense that the prophet spoke&#44; as though he could summon all nature
                to be present at the making of the everlasting covenant between God and Israel. We
                have already seen that the subject&#8211;matter was worthy of such a solemn appeal
                &#59; God was giving a law to his people which was ultimately destined to win to
                itself&#44; in some form&#44; all the human family&#59; but&#44; in the
                meantime&#44; we&#44; <pb n="189"/> THE LAW TESTED. 189 its guardians&#44; were to

                against annihilation and from being swallowed up among the masses of mankind. And
                everywhere at this day are the witnesses whom Moses invoked present. When we till
                the soil&#44; there is the earth as it was in ages gone by&#44; ready to respond to
                our labour&#44; and to yield its increase for our bodily sustenance. When we look
                abroad over the green fields or flowery meadows&#44; behold the limpid stream or the
                rushing cataract&#44; we are greeted by the same phenomena which once de&#8211;
                lighted the eye of the great seer of Israel. When we direct our look upward&#44; and
                behold the sun&#44; and moon&#44; and the starry host of heaven&#44; and contemplate
                the countless worlds which blaze nightly in the skies&#44; standing like sentinels
                in the vast field of nature for&#8211; ever&#58; we have there the same mighty works
                of God which were called on to testify when Israel listened to the man who&#44; on

                light to the people whom he had been selected to lead away from bondage to freedom.
                And when the sky is overcast by thick clouds&#44; and rain descends on the

                me&#44; in order to appear before you to&#8211;day to become in a measure the

                suddenness and sig&#8211; nificance. It tells us how frail is the tenure which we
                have on life&#44; how brief are our days&#44; how immi&#8211; nent is the close
                thereof&#44; even when least expected. A similar misfortune befell the first
                high&#8211;priest of our people&#44; Aaron&#44; the brother of Moses&#44; when he
                was bereft of his eldest two sons on one day&#44; at the very period when they had
                been solemnly installed into the priestly ofiice to the Most High&#44; to serve in
                the sanctuary for the people of Israel. And we read in respect to this&#44; in this
                day&#39;s section of the law &#58; &#42; Substance of an address spoken in the
                Synagogue of the Wash&#8211; ington City Hebrew Congregation&#44; on Sabbath&#44;

                Lord hath spoken&#44; saying. Through those who come near to me will I be
                sanctified&#44; and before all the people will I be honoured &#59; and Aaron
                remained silent.&#34; Lev. x. 3. Let us endeavour to analyze these words of our
                great teaclier. On that day the people had beheld the final consecration of a class
                of men selected from themselves to represent them in the sanctuary &#59; the act was
                complete&#44; and Aaron and his sons had been set apart for the everlasting
                priesthood. They had literally been brought nearer to God than their former
                associates &#59; they alone could enter the holy place&#44; and there perform the
                duties which they had to administer for the whole house of Israel. But it was
                precisely at this time&#44; when they had just commenced their sacred functions&#44;
                that death arrested two of them&#44; and &#34; they died before the Lord&#44;&#34;
                meaning that they had of&#8211; fended by introducing&#44; as our text says&#44;
                unholy fire near the altar&#44; and therefore they died suddenly&#44; though
                otherwise in robust health. The people had thus&#44; as Moses told his brother&#44;
                an exemplification&#44; that no position in life insures us immunity&#44; and that
                the higher we rise in the scale of existence&#44; the nearer we are to retribution.
                The priests of God had done only a slight wrong&#44; according to human
                judgment&#59; but&#44; in their case&#44; it had become a grave transgres&#8211;
                sion&#44; and their life paid the forfeit for their iniquity. Men are so apt to
                complain of the hardship of their fate &#8212; of the burdens they have to bear&#59;
                and they look with envy on those who are raised above them&#44; who occupy the high
                positions in society&#44; and they fancy that the others are unduly favoured&#44;
                while they are unjustly neglected. But when they see that those VOL. IX. 17 <pb
                    n="194"/> 194 HOW TO MOURN. who are worthy and righteous&#44; who are great and
                ex&#8211; alted&#44; are exposed to the common lot of mankind&#44; that these are
                not screened against punishment when they transgress &#58; the Lord is sanctified by
                all&#44; who will then acknowledge that He is just and impartial&#44; and that human
                elevation only places us nearer to a rigid accountability. The humble will not
                therefore com&#8211; plain of the evils they have to encounter&#44; seeing that all
                are alike subject to the mishaps incident to hu&#8211; manity&#59; and in the fate
                which befalls the prominent in virtue&#44; talents&#44; and usefulness&#44; they
                discover that there is no injustice or favouritism in the heavenly tribunal.
                When&#44; therefore&#44; those who are nearest to God feel the weight of divine
                indignation&#44; the Lord himself is acknowledged as the just Ruler and the
                impartial Sovereign of the world&#44; and all will ascribe to Him honour and
                glory&#44; as the One who&#44; exalted above all&#44; watches over all with paternal
                solicitude&#44; so that every one may meet with the recompense due to his deeds.
                Aaron felt the justice of this instruction thus solemnly conveyed to him by his
                prophet&#8211;brother&#44; and remained silent in his deep sorrow&#44; under the
                full conviction&#44; that what he then suffered was for his and the people&#39;s
                ultimate good. But do not imagine that Aaron&#39;s submission was the result of
                indifference &#59; on the contrary&#44; the whole tenor of the narrative&#44; and
                his refusal to eat the flesh of the sin&#8211;offering&#44; according to the usual
                ordinance&#44; proved that his father&#39;s heart was deeply grieved. And how could
                it have been otherwise &#63; He had been associated with Moses in effecting the
                redemption of the Israelites&#59; together they had gone to Pharaoh&#44; to demand
                the freedom of their brothers&#44; and he had stood alongside of him&#44; <pb

                bestowal of the law from Sinai through the mediation of the greatest of prophets.
                &#34;Wliile&#44; however&#44; Moses had been made the chief instrument of
                Israel&#39;s re&#8211; demption&#44; to Aaron and his descendants had been promised
                the priesthood as an inheritance to them forever. Moreover&#44; by the divine grace
                the punish&#8211; ment for the defection at the making of the golden calf had just
                been remitted&#44; and the people reinstated into favour&#44; since God had accepted
                their liberal offer&#8211; ings from which the tabernacle and all its vessels had
                been constructed. Nay more&#44; for a week previous&#44; and up to that day&#44; the
                sanctuary had been solemnly anointed and the sacrifices daily ottered on the
                altar&#59; and at length he himself had been admitted to bring the sacrifices&#44;
                and his sons had aided him for the first time in their sacred functions &#59; he had
                lifted up his hands to the people and blessed them&#44; when&#44; in token of the
                forgiveness of the national sin&#44; the glory of God had been manifested to all the
                people &#59; and all was gladness&#44; and the shout of joy was lifted up
                simulta&#8211; neously from the assembled faithful&#44; and&#44; to all ap&#8211;
                pearance&#44; there was nothing to disturb the general pleasure&#44; or to mar the
                happiness of the father&#39;s heart. It was&#44; however&#44; in the moment of this
                blessed repose that a sudden bereavement robbed Aaron of half of his progeny &#59;
                for his two stricken sons left no chil&#8211; dren&#44; and his hopes were almost
                crushed. But he rose superior to the severe trial of that dreadful mo&#8211;
                ment&#44; and submitted in silence to the decree of the Most High&#44; who thus
                willed to be glorified by the death of those whose devotion and sincere piety had
                brought them near to Him. <pb n="196"/> 196 HOW TO MOURN. But why should we&#44; my

                life&#63; What is death&#63; We are born to be here for awhile&#44; to be removed
                hence when our task is done. For awhile&#44; I say&#44; because the death of the
                body is not the end of our existence. Our body is indeed laid in the grave to
                moulder away into corruption. But the spirit which once animated us has not been
                thereby an&#8211; nihilated&#44; and it will survive in the presence of the God who
                bestowed it on us&#44; to await his call for a purer life. It is the seed&#44; as it
                were&#44; of immortality&#44; which we intrust to the earth&#44; to arise thence
                when the graves are opened at the day of the resurrection. So does the husbandman
                intrust to the earth the precious seed. Anon examine it&#44; after it has been
                buried awhile&#44; and its symmetry and beauty are gone&#44; and it presents an
                outward corruption&#44; as though its life were fled. Yet watch it well &#59; it
                contains the germ of a new exist&#8211; ence&#44; and soon it will bring forth the
                new plant to bear the seed&#44; a hundredfold multiplied&#44; to reward the labour
                of man. So also is death the door to eter&#8211; nal existence&#44; purified and
                renewed&#44; through the agency of material dissolution. ISTotliing is annihi&#8211;

                earth and its glories&#44; he will not sink into dejection&#44; nor dread the

                to mourn for the bereave&#8211; ment which death has wrought in their
                family&#8211;circle&#44; should not complain as though they had been wronged by
                Providence&#44; and weep without comfort&#44; but sub&#8211; mit with patience to
                the One who has removed the beloved friend&#44; and acknowledge the justice of his
                decrees&#44; which are always sent in mercy. Though we may not be able to comprehend
                the ways of God&#44; at the moment any event takes place&#44; we may rest satisfied
                that all will ultimately have a happy result. We are not at liberty to say that God
                directs the hand of the assassin&#44; or sends the robber to commit his violation on
                the property of others. But after the wicked have accomplished their work&#44; which
                they meant for evil. Providence steps in&#44; even to the satisfaction of our
                limited view&#44; and directs all&#44; so that no permanent injury shall be wrought
                thereby&#44; and that the crime be deprived of the fatal conse&#8211; quences which
                the wrong&#8211;doer contemplated. In the present affliction which has cast a deep
                shadow over the joy of the country&#44; and arrested so suddenly the exultant shout
                which was heard but a week ago&#44; we&#44; as servants of the Lord&#44; ought to
                turn our looks to Him&#44; for guidance and strength. Let the sudden decease of the
                late President impress on us the important lesson&#44; that all our joys are
                fleet&#8211; ing&#44; all our prosperity is unstable. A week ago he was triumphant
                over those who had been in arms against the Union&#44; of which he was the chief
                magis&#8211; trate&#44; and to&#8211;day his dead body is on its way to its final
                resting&#8211;place&#44; and the grief of the people and the regret of the many
                cannot recall him from his 17&#42; <pb n="198"/> 198 HOW TO MOURN. slumber.
                &#34;While he was perhaps thinking of enjoy&#8211; ing a period of tranquillity
                during his new term of office&#44; after having had to witness strife and the
                tu&#8211; mult of arms during the first period of his presiden&#8211; cy&#44; when
                apparently the end of the stmggle was nigh&#44; and he might have anticipated a
                quiet and prosperous administration &#58; the fatal messenger of death dashed down
                all these hopeful visions&#44; and the chieftain rests suddenly from his labours. In
                place&#44; however&#44; of ar&#8211; raigning the mysterious ways of Providence&#44;
                let us&#44; like Aaron&#44; submit meekly to what our strength can&#8211; not
                repair&#44; which our wisdom cannot alter. When our first high&#8211;priest lost his
                two hopeful sons he did not rend his garments&#44; he did not pull&#8211;out his
                hair&#44; he did not even break forth into the passionate words of grief like King
                David&#44; &#34; Oh&#44; my sous &#33; that I had died in your stead&#59;&#34; but
                silently&#44; without uttering a solitary complaint&#44; he yielded himself entirely
                to the divine behest&#44; and bowed in submissive patience&#44; though his paternal
                heart was ready to burst with the grief which it experienced. So let the American
                people likewise&#44; in their present affliction&#44; seek coun&#8211; sel from God
                &#59; let them recognize Him in this hour of sorrow&#44; and learn to put a proper

                could have added to His greatness. If you were to ask a man how he would prefer to

                lessons. It should tell us not to cling so closely to earth and its joys&#44; to
                pleasure&#44; to power&#59; since all are so readily taken from us. Let us rather
                consider ourselves as constantly subject to the divine summons&#44; and be ready to
                meet them&#44; as creatures of earth whose abode is not here. But I fear that the
                people have not properly appreciated these lessons. They appear to be excited to
                anger at the horrible crime which has been perpetrated&#44; and to dwell too much on
                ideas of vengeance. I will admit that it is but just&#44; at the first moment of
                such tidings as have been just flashed over the land&#44; that men should indulge in
                detestation of the crime and abhorrence of the criminals&#59; but with returning
                calmness&#44; it is not proper to continue in this agitated frame of mind. It is not
                thus Mr. Lincoln&#39;s memory should be honoured. I have been told&#44; since my
                arrival here&#44; of several acts of per&#8211; sonal kindness and clemency which it
                is said he de&#8211; <pb n="200"/> 200 HOW TO MOURN. lighted to indulge in. It is
                moreover said&#44; that in the last cabinet council which he held with his chosen
                advisers&#44; he expressed himself in terms of kindness towards the subdued public
                enemies&#44; that it was his intention to pour the oil of conciliation on the
                troubled waves of war. Now&#44; accepting the truth of this assertion&#44; it were
                well that the people should forego their violent resentment&#44; and imitate the
                good&#8211; ness of heart evinced bj their late President&#44; and to let his
                example have a powerful influence towards in&#8211; spiring them with sentiments of
                benevolence and for&#8211; bearance. For behold&#44; in the vast country to the
                southward from here the fierce desolations of a fright&#8211; ful war are everywhere
                visible. Cities have been ruined&#44; fields rendered waste&#44; homesteads levelled
                to the ground&#44; and ruin stalks abroad over hill and val&#8211; ley. Deep are the
                traces of the havoc which armed hosts have wrought&#44; and despair has seized on
                many inhabitants who have been driven forth bereft of their substance. Now is the
                time to let sweet peace smile again over the distracted land&#59; to offer terms of
                con&#8211; ciliation to the conquered foes&#44; so that hands which have been
                stretched forth armed with the deadly weapon to deal out death and destruction&#44;
                may be soon held out again to grasp each other in token of a hearty reconciliation
                and restored friendship. But with the idea of vengeance&#44; retaliation&#44; and
                revenge&#44; the future of the country will be sad indeed. The strife may be
                over&#44; but peace cannot exist where mu&#8211; tual good&#8211;will is banished.
                And if men wish there&#8211; fore to honour the memory of Mr. Lincoln&#44; let them
                and their new ruler&#44; on whom the grievous death of the one now mourned has
                devolved the government&#44; <pb n="201"/> HOW TO MOURN. 201 imitate and follow up
                his merciful intention&#44; and pour&#44; as he had intended to do&#44; the oil of
                kindness on the bleeding wounds of the land&#44; to stifle the tu&#8211; mult of the
                feelings of the conquered&#44; and induce them to again accept the control of the
                general gov&#8211; ernment with cheerful acquiescence and unforced obe&#8211;
                dience. &#8212; But all mere noisy demonstration will be in vain &#59; for soon will
                the image of the murdered Presi&#8211; dent become tiresome to the masses to
                contemplate&#44; &#8212; they will be unwilling to look at the fearful spec&#8211;
                tacle of the untimely slain&#44; and all moral lessons which they ought to derive
                from the sad exhibition of human frailty will be lost on them&#44; as though they
                had not been so terribly enforced &#59; whereas&#44; by dwell&#8211; ing on his good
                deeds and following his footsteps on the path of peace and conciliation&#44; they
                will honour his memory truly&#44; and be benefitted and improved by the instruction
                which the sudden bereavement should convey to us all&#44; and they will act more in
                consonance with his naturally kind disposition&#44; than by any loud demonstration
                of outward grief&#44; which ends in for&#8211; getful indilference. As regards the
                war in which Mr. Lincoln&#44; as the chief magistrate of the Union&#44; was
                engaged&#44; permit me to pass it by&#44; the time not having yet come to write its
                history impartially. The main features are known to you all&#44; and their recital
                would convey no instruction to you&#44; my hearers. For is this the place to discuss
                political subjects. But with respect to the moral view of the war&#44; without
                trenching on the proximate political events which provoked it&#44; we may freely say
                that sin was the cause of it&#44; yes&#44; national sin was the cause of national
                strife. I will not specify <pb n="202"/> 202 HOW TO MOURN. any particular act whicli
                I might justly stigmatize as such&#59; but surely there must have been grievous
                sinning which could enkindle so fearful a struggle&#44; and we may freely say that a
                general discontent with the blessings here enjoyed contributed greatly to loosen the
                bonds of friendship which formerly united the various sections. But what ingratitude
                to the Bestower of all good does this dissatisfaction display &#33; Behold the
                extent of the land &#33; It stretches from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean&#44;
                from the St. Lawrence to the Rio Grande &#59; within this vast country&#44; nearly
                as large as all Europe&#44; you find the greatest variety of climate and soil. You
                find here the cotton&#44; the sugar&#44; the rice&#44; the tobacco&#44; the
                corn&#44; the cereals of various kinds&#44; and nearly all other productions of the
                soil which are needed for the sustenance of life and the outward comfort of man.
                Among the minerals you find the gold&#44; the iron&#44; the silver&#44; the
                lead&#44; the copper&#44; the coal&#44; and other substances which are cal&#8211;
                culated to embellish life and subserve the pursuits of arts and sciences. In respect
                to the liberty of the individual&#44; this was fully secured by the fundamental
                law&#44; the constitution of the land&#44; which cast its ample protection over all
                the inhabitants&#44; securing to them the right to acquire wealtli&#44; the pursuit
                of happiness without molestation from others&#44; and the amplest re&#8211; ligious
                freedom. And with all these blessings uni&#8211; versally dittused&#44; there still
                dwelt dissatisfaction in the hearts of many &#59; and&#44; therefore&#44; we may
                assume&#44; that God surrendered the people awhile to the control of their own
                passions&#44; and we have beheld in conse&#8211; quence the fierce march of
                desolating strife and mu&#8211; tual slaughter&#44; which we trust will soon be
                closed. <pb n="203"/> HOW TO MOURN. 203 But the people must also repent&#44; and
                turn their looks towards the Father who has for awliile abandoned them to
                themselves&#44; and seek to govern themselves more in accordance with his revealed
                Word&#44; and love mercy and righteousness&#44; so that his wrath may be turned
                away&#44; and He grant again peace and security to the now suffering land. But
                you&#44; my Jewish hearers&#44; have a special duty to perform in this connexion
                &#58; you should&#44; as the chosen servants of God&#44; throw aside all defection
                from our religion of which you may be con&#8211; scious. You must love the precepfts
                which our Scrip&#8211; tures inculcate&#44; and practise them on every occasion when
                the opportunity therefor presents itself&#44; and thus contribute your share to
                cause the restoration of the divine favour to the country in which you have found a
                home for yourselves and your religion &#59; and thus you will secure for yourselves
                the heritage of free institutions&#44; in common with the citizens of other
                creeds&#44; and obtain&#44; as individuals&#44; the especial bless&#8211; ing of
                your heavenly Father. For when you are called on to quit the earth&#44; all the
                perishable goods for which you toiled&#44; and which you prized so greatly&#44; will
                not avail you aught &#59; but virtuous deeds solely will plead for you to obtain
                from God pardon&#44; grace&#44; and mercy. If you then come laden with sin&#44; the
                in&#8211; dignation of your omniscient Judge will demand of you a strict account as
                to the manner in which you have spent your days on earth&#44; and how you have used
                the opportunities so often presented to you to acquire spiritual wealth &#59; and
                the unrepentant sinner&#44; the unpurilied heart&#44; will be doomed to that pain
                and punishment which it has merited by its obduracy and disobedience. But if you
                have sedulously obeyed <pb n="204"/> 204 HOW TO MOURN. the commands of the Lord&#44;
                you can lie down calmly to sleep the sleep of death &#59; for at the portals of
                eter&#8211; nity which you reach through the dissolution of your mortal portion&#44;
                yon will be received by your eternal Father&#44; who will welcome back the returning
                child&#44; and guard him forever in his fatherly protection. Salvation is within
                your own reach. Labour for it&#44; and it will be yours&#44; and while securing your
                own happiness&#44; you will also benefit truly your fellow&#8211;men &#59; since
                your example may incite them to imitate your conduct&#44; and thus be the means of
                making them like&#8211; wise pious and virtuous. I have now to say a few words
                respecting the pray&#8211; ers that were offered up during our divine service for
                the repose of the soul of Mr. Lincoln. It is&#44; indeed&#44; somewhat unusual to
                pray for one not of our faith&#44; but by no means in opposition to its spirit&#44;
                and there&#8211; fore not inadmissible. We pray for the dead&#44; because we believe
                that the souls of the departed as well as of the living are in the keeping of
                God&#44; and there&#8211; fore the subjects of entreaty on our part&#44; and of
                grace and pardon on that of our heavenly Judge. We also believe that&#44; with very
                few exceptions&#44; we cannot of&#8211; fend God eternally&#44; so as to deserve
                eternal damna&#8211; tion &#59; for we are taught &#34;All Israel have a share in
                the world to come&#59;&#34; where&#8211; fore temporary punishment will wipe away
                the sin committed in the flesh&#44; after which the ransomed soul will be received
                in favour&#44; having been redeemed through death and the purification of the
                punishment decreed against it. Again we are taught&#44; mons n&#8211;on Nnn

                the rest in heavenly bliss for men of all nations&#44; as our re&#8211; ligion
                excludes from the favour of God no one who has done his will. The prayers&#44;
                therefore&#44; ofiered up this day for the deceased President are in accord&#8211;
                ance with the spirit of the faith which we have in&#8211; herited as children of
                Israel&#44; who recognize in all men those created like them in the image of
                God&#44; and all entitled to his mercy&#44; grace&#44; and pardon&#44; though they
                have not yet learned to worship and adore Ilim&#44; as we do who iiave been
                especially se&#8211; lected as the bearers of his law. God will judge all according
                to the light they have received&#44; and not withhold from them any reward their
                deeds have merited &#59; while He will hold us to a strict accounta&#8211;
                bility&#44; if we&#44; with the superior knowledge imparted to us&#44; neglect the
                duties which our religion demands of us to perform. One thing&#44; among others&#44;
                is obligatory on us&#44; to do all in our power to promote the welfare of the
                country in which our lot is cast. We must honestly contribute to bear the burdens
                imposed on other citizens&#44; and never offend against the laws enacted for the
                public security. Our religion makes no separation between us and men of other
                creeds. We should submit to the laws of the land in whatever does not militate
                against our moral and religious duties&#44; though we had no part in their
                enactment. For so were we in&#8211; structed by the prophet Jeremiah &#58; &#34;
                Build houses and dwell therein&#44; and plant gardens and eat the fruit thereof&#59;
                and seek the welfare of the city whither I have banished you&#44; and pray for it

                which neither it nor any other could exist. Every religion&#44; as it imposes duties

                and are founded so strongly on human reason that their admission is a matter of
                course&#44; to contradistinguish them from others which Israelites claim as the
                basis of their belief&#44; and which we will term revealed truths&#44; or those
                which are not necessary&#44; but are true because God has revealed them or made them
                known to us like other matters contained in the Bible. Some have attached greater

                thej assert that their evidence is so striking&#44; that man was by nature endowed
                with them&#44; and it needed no direct interference of the Most High in order to
                impart them to mankind. It is true that nearly all nations which have come into
                contact with civilized peoples have&#44; on their first discovery&#44; shown that
                they had some notion of God&#44; or rather that they invested some invisible or
                tangible being with some sort of superior power and authority &#59; also that they
                had some sort of ceremonies by which they hoped to propitiate their deities&#44; and
                that likewise they expected some reward for doing what they sup&#8211; posed
                pleasing to the same&#44; and feared punishment for non&#8211;compliance with their
                wishes. So far&#44; then&#44; some sort of religion is natural to man. He constantly
                feels his inability to cope with the dif&#8211; ficulties which everywhere and at
                all times beset and assail him&#59; and in his helplessness he turns towards the
                Author of things to ask for aid and enlargement. But if we exatiiine into the
                opinions of past ages and of many nations of the present era&#44; we shall discover
                that they were and are the most varied and contra&#8211; dictory. Some invest one
                alone with supreme power&#44; while others deem two necessary to account for the
                origin of things&#44; and others a multitude&#44; more or less numerous&#44;
                according to the system which they pro&#8211; fess. Then&#44; as regards duties&#44;
                we shall be struck with the same variety&#59; ceremonies the most distant from each

                contradictory&#44; have been practised by intelligent no less than barbaric
                nations&#44; and all in the hope of obtaining the favour of their gods or averting

                prev&#8211; alent&#44; a reasonable amount of certainty nowhere. If&#44; now&#44;
                religion is natural to man&#44; if he even should&#44; in truth&#44; be impelled to
                invent one to gratify his inward craving for higher things than his every&#8211; day
                life aftbrds him &#58; it would be&#44; at best&#44; a wavering&#44; unsteady guide
                to Avhich he would have to intrust himself&#44; a fleeting and doubtful happiness
                which he could hope to attain&#44; while he would be equally un&#8211; certain
                whether&#44; after all&#44; be had discovered any means to satisfy the gods whom he
                dreads&#44; not loves. He might&#44; also&#44; in his ignorance of what the gods
                require&#44; offend them when doing what he imagines would gratify them&#59; and
                thus his acts of worship would prove injurious to him&#44; and prevent his
                reach&#8211; ing the very object he sincerely aimed at to attain. Besides&#44; where
                do we discover aught in nature to tell us precisely what the Deity is &#63; did the
                great philos&#8211; ophers of Greece&#44; such as Anaxagoras&#44; Pythagoras&#44;

                conception we have of God&#44; who created all from nothing&#44; &#8212; who
                spoke&#44; and all came forth at his bidding&#63; Go and look into the history of
                the gods of the ancients&#44; or what is com&#8211; monly known as mythology&#44;
                and you will discover that everything animate and inanimate had its god or tutelary
                divinity &#59; there was a god of tire&#44; and one of the sea&#44; one of the
                heavens&#44; and another for the luminary of the day&#59; fountains and trees were

                TRUTHS. 211 they were assigned &#59; while the passions also&#44; both the virtuous
                and the vicious&#44; were typified as superior powers or gods. I will not recite the
                names of the heathen idols in this house dedicated to the glory of the true God
                &#59; but all of you can readily find them in the books which speak of them&#44; and
                many are famil&#8211; iar to you already in your past experience. But this is
                uncontrovertible&#44; that a uniformity of conception of the Divine Power is nowhere
                to be met with among the ancient and modern heathen &#59; and&#44; in short&#44;
                their gods were the embodiments of their own gross na&#8211; tures&#44; and they
                never rose with their deities beyond the conception of their own impulses and
                inclinations&#44; as far as the popular belief&#44; at least&#44; was concerned.
                This being the case&#44; their religion&#44; such as it was&#44; never could render
                them moral and virtuous&#44; or&#44; at best&#44; it could not be the foundation of
                a uniform code of moral duties &#59; and&#44; without investigating the social
                condition of the heathen states&#44; and determining how far they were inferior or
                otherwise to modern ones&#44; we may maintain that any claim they had to moral
                excellence was not owing to their ideas of the gods&#44; nor to any precepts which
                they could have received through their agency. As to the views the ancients had of
                reward and punishment&#44; such as they are represented by the poets&#44; both Greek
                and Roman&#44; who were doubtless&#44; in a great degree&#44; the religious
                authorities of the masses&#44; a simple inspection will convince any one that the
                whole was merely a material thing&#59; and&#44; moreover&#44; that the wrath of the
                gods was excited by trifling acts and thoughtless words&#44; and manifested in a
                manner not reflecting honour on the vengeful beings who em&#8211; <pb n="212"/> 212
                REVEALED TRUTHS. ployed their superior power to afflict helpless mortals. We need
                not explain how little such a crude concep&#8211; tion of responsibility&#44; which
                could not fix on the probable act which might displease any particular inhabitant of
                Olympus&#44; or whatever the fabled resi&#8211; dence of the divinities might be
                called&#44; could operate in checking the evil passions of man &#59; since nothing a
                mortal might do could screen him from the malev&#8211; olence or spite of some of
                the many worshipped be&#8211; ings&#44; which all demanded homage&#44; could all
                cause pain and suiFering&#44; and still differed in their opinions regarding what
                the son of earth should do to propi&#8211; tiate them. The philosophers&#44; such as
                Socrates and Cicero&#44; no doubt had a more elevated conception of the
                preter&#8211; natural world&#44; and they also endeavoured to intro&#8211; duce a
                better moral system than the priests and their assistants could proclaim&#59; but
                they&#44; after all&#44; could not prevent a thorough corruption&#44; nor reduce the
                grossness of the conception under which the masses laboured. They only proved&#44;
                living as they did cen&#8211; turies apart&#44; that natural religion&#44;
                notwithstanding that its truths are apparent at first sight&#44; is not a safe nor a
                uniform guide&#44; and is constantly liable to sink into corruption through the
                agency of designing men acting on the credulity of the people&#44; who may be
                deluded and thereby brought under the control&#44; both political and moral&#44; of
                wicked designs&#44; notwithstand&#8211; ing their advanced state of civilization
                &#59; for no one can dispute that&#44; in material greatness&#44; Egypt&#44;

                nations have scarcely excelled&#44; and of which the remains constantly discovered
                and explored furnish <pb n="213"/> REVEALED TRUTHS. 213 a striking evidence. What
                then is the pre&#8211;eminent claim of eternal or necessary truths &#63; for&#44;
                granting both their cogency and necessity&#44; they are subject to the defects just
                laid before you. If&#44; however&#44; the light of revelation comes to the aid of
                our reason&#44; how marvellously accurate becomes our knowledge of thinsjs otherwise
                concealed from us &#33; Instead of groping about in utter darkness to discover a
                god&#44; we are at once informed that&#44; before aught existed&#44; there existed
                in all perfection the Eter&#8211; nal uncreated Lord of all&#44; from whom all has
                sprung. His existence cannot be defined by us or to us&#44; &#8212; our limited
                reason is not capable to comprehend his being from eternity&#44; nor to define his
                duration&#44; from any means of comparison at our command. But as re&#8211; gards
                his essence&#44; we are informed that He is One&#44; alone in his power&#44; unaided
                in his government. Hu&#8211; man reason&#44; in examining the great diversity of
                ani&#8211; mated and inanimated beings&#44; was led to assume a diversity in the
                godhead &#40;nvu&#39;&#8211;i &#39;nty or nvDm&#41;&#44; or that antagonistic powers
                produce the varying efi&#58;ects of good and evil&#44; mercy and punishment&#44;
                which we ob&#8211; serve. But our revelation tells us that all the effects we
                behold&#44; both in the external and moral world&#44; are the results of one
                Will&#44; the products of one Mind&#44; whom we call&#44; for distinction&#39;s
                sake&#44; by the various appellations given to Him in different languages&#44; such
                as D&#94;n&#94;N in Hebrew&#44; Dcus in Latin&#44; Gott in German&#44; God in
                English&#44; which terms&#44; though they sound dif&#8211; ferently&#44; signify the
                same Being&#44; who&#44; moreover&#44; to designate him from other gods&#44; the
                products of human invention&#44; is styled in his word &#94;ntiy&#94;
                &#39;H&#39;&#94;n &#34; the God of Israel&#44;&#34; as the national Deity&#44; if we
                may so say&#44; of <pb n="214"/> 214 REVEALED TRUTHS. the people that He selected as
                the bearers of his law. Instead&#44; also&#44; of our being permitted to imagine Him
                capricious&#44; cruel&#44; or revengeful&#44; we are informed of his attributes&#44;
                by which He is glorified&#44; that He is &#34; powerful&#44; merciful&#44;
                gracious&#44; long&#8211;sufiering&#44; and abundant in beneficence and truth&#44;
                yet not heedless of the acts of man&#44; but punishing with justice&#44; and never
                forgetting any deed of righteousness&#44; while for&#8211; giving iniquity&#44; and
                transgression&#44; and sin&#44; when for&#8211; giveness and pardon contribute more
                to the happiness of his creatures than severity and rigorous retribu&#8211;
                tion.&#34; We therefore do not know Him merely by negative definitions&#44; as some
                learned men have as&#8211; serted&#44; but He is represented to us by his positive
                qualities&#44; termed the divine attributes&#44; and they are such as to challenge
                the homage of all&#44; and to impress them with the conviction&#44; that One so
                great and in&#8211; finitely good is alone entitled to the worship of his creatures.
                &#8212; So also as regards the duties we are bound to observe&#44; and the acts
                which we should avoid in order to obtain the favour of this infinite God&#44; we are
                not left to conjecture&#44; by which we might be led in our ignorance to do the very
                things which would call down on as his condemnation and ill&#8211;will &#59; but we
                are made sure that we shall act correctly&#44; if we only fol&#8211; low the path
                which He has pointed out to us in his written law&#44; a part of which was
                communicated to the whole assembled people of Israel&#44; while the other portion
                was given through the intermediate agency of the man Moses&#44; whom the nation of
                Israel selected as their messenger&#44; pledging themselves to observe all that God
                might command him with respect to them. This law&#44; so bestowed&#44; was made
                accessible <pb n="215"/> REVEALED TRUTHS. 215 to all&#44; it was written down in a
                code which has been preserved for all time&#59; and thus our people have al&#8211;
                ways had a sure and safe guide to lead them on the path of duty&#44; which has been
                shown to be the second requisite for religion&#44; since&#44; without duties to
                fulfil&#44; no faith can be imagined to have any existence. &#8212; And&#44;
                lastly&#44; with respect to the third element&#44; &#8212; accounta&#8211;
                bility&#44; &#8212; Revelation has also placed this beyond the realms of doubt. In
                all the written records of God&#39;s communing with man&#44; it is always
                prominently held up to him as a warning and incentive&#44; that no deed escapes the
                cognizance of the Lord&#44; who is ever ready to punish&#44; and that no act of
                righteousness is forgot&#8211; ten amid all the transactions of the world&#44; and
                will be recompensed according to its merit. Farther&#44; we are told that no lapse
                of time or concealment will screen the sinner&#59; and the whole tenor of the
                revealed law also impresses upon us the doctrine of the immortal&#8211; ity of the
                soul&#44; and&#44; consequently&#44; that the responsi&#8211; bility of man does not
                cease with this life &#59; wherefore should he on earth be permitted to remain
                unscathed&#44; he has by this means not escaped from the just visita&#8211; tion
                which his deeds have merited. It would take us too far from our subject to exhibit
                to&#8211;day the proofs of this doctrine&#44; though I may briefly state that many
                Scriptural passages could not be understood&#44; unless they meant to teach us that
                the spirit will be held liable in another existence for the deeds done in the
                flesh&#44; so that the grave is no refuge for evil&#8211;doers. Thus also teaches
                Ezekiel &#40;xvii. 4&#41; &#58; nnn n&#39;h nxtann \y2ir\ &#34;The soul which
                sinueth alone shall die&#59;&#34; and thus was it taught to Adam in the
                beginning&#44; when he was forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge&#44; &#34; On
                    <pb n="216"/> 216 REVEALED TRUTHS. the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely
                die&#44;&#34; which&#44; as he did uot perish on the very day of the
                transgression&#44; must mean that the accountabihly to be thereby incurred wouki be
                recompensed at a time subsequent in any state of existence &#59; and thus we are
                likewise informed &#40;Numbers xv. 30&#41; &#58; &#34; And that per&#8211; son shall
                be cut off from among his people&#44;&#34; refer&#8211; ring to one who daringly
                despises the precepts of the Lord. We have&#44; accordingly&#44; in the scheme of
                revelation which is in our possession&#44; all the requirements of natural religion
                which human reason might have im&#8211; perfectly evolved by slow advances&#44;
                while we have obtained them&#44; perfect and precise&#44; without a cloud of
                obscurity&#44; and have thereby an infollible means&#44; first&#44; to know that
                there is a God &#59; secondly&#44; to know that there is a moral guide invariable in
                its principles&#44; and where to find it&#59; and thirdly&#44; to feel that we are
                constantly under the cognizance and watchfulness of the great Being&#44; who
                will&#44; in justice and mercy&#44; mete out punishment and reward for our acts&#44;
                by an unerr&#8211; ing measure of right&#44; without prejudice or partiality&#44;
                and guided solely by the welfare of all his creatures. It is thus that revelation
                has completed for us and all the world&#44; if it will receive its instruction&#44;
                what hu&#8211; man reason had otherwise but dimly discerned and elaborated with
                insurmountable difficulties&#44; without&#44; after all&#44; arriving at a
                satisfactory conclusion. It was&#44; therefore&#44; not perhaps necessary&#44; as a
                deep thinker&#42; of our race has maintained&#44; for God to reveal his exis&#8211;
                tence when He gave the Ten Comnumdments&#44; where&#8211; &#42; Mendelssohn&#44; in

                needed to impart eternal truths&#44; but merely a law or a code&#44; which the
                legislation of Sinai confessedly is&#59; but&#44; at the same time&#44; it was
                needed to rid mankind of the erroneous notions concerning God&#44; the law&#44; and
                responsibility &#59; and to effect this it was well becoming the dignity of the
                Almighty to descend in his glory on the summit of Horeb&#44; and there proclaim
                words of truth and power which were to rend asunder&#44; and this forever&#44; the
                vail which obscured human reason&#44; and to teach to all the attributes which are
                his&#44; and to proclaim his unity and eternity&#44; his being the Creator and Kuler
                of all things&#44; that He is the same from the be&#8211; ginning&#44; and will be
                the same till time shall be no more. But we must leave this part of our subject&#44;
                and hasten to the one 1 intended chiefly to illustrate to&#8211; day&#44;
                namely&#44; revealed truths&#44; in contradistinction to those termed eternal or
                necessary ones. While the latter are&#44; as said&#44; requisite as the basis of all
                religion&#44; the first named are&#44; on the contrary&#44; only true because they
                are founded on the divine revelation in our pos&#8211; session. They could have been
                otherwise&#44; or not at all&#44; if God had so declared it to be his will &#59; but
                hav&#8211; ing taught us that so or so it should be&#44; we are bound to receive
                it&#44; as emanating from the Source of all truth. If&#44; for instance&#44; the
                Most High had instructed us concerning the outcasts or dispersed of Israel&#44; that
                they should be scattered over all the countries and never be restored&#44; or in
                case He had said nothing con&#8211; cerning this point&#44; we would be&#44; in the
                first instance&#44; authorized to assume that the dispersion of Israel was
                final&#44; and that they would never return&#44; any more VOL. IX. 19 <pb n="218"/>

                in the second&#44; we would be at liberty to indulge in conjecture&#44; and assume
                whatever we might deem the more probable or agreeable theory. Restoration in either
                case could not be supported by Scripture&#44; and&#44; therefore&#44; be no doctrine
                of Judaism. But on in&#8211; specting the Bible&#44; we shall discover that it is
                em&#8211; phatically and clearly taught there&#44; that a time will come when the
                scattered remnants of Israel shall be restored to their ancient home&#44; under the
                leadership of a chosen ruler and messenger of the Lord&#44; the God of Israel&#59;
                consequently&#44; as those who have confidence in the One who has revealed himself
                by the light of nature and his spoken word&#44; we are bound to put faith in this
                assertion and adopt it as a revealed truth&#44; not necessary&#44; indeed&#44; as a
                prerequisite for Judaism&#44; demanded for its existence&#44; but as an imparted
                truth&#59; wherefore it is a portion of its dogmas which we have received from the
                One&#44; who cannot err himself nor deceive others. On a previous occasion I have
                dwelt at length on the first part of the Haphtorali of to&#8211;day&#44; contained
                in Ezekiel xxxvii.&#44; and exhibited to you the future union of the formerly
                hostile divisions of Israel and Judah&#44; there represented as Joseph&#44; the
                father of Ephraim&#44; from which tribe the first king of the di&#8211; vided realm
                was descended&#44; and Judah&#44; as the leading tribe of the other division&#44;
                from which the royal house of David also sprung. The future reunion of these parts
                was typified by the two sticks the prophet held in his hand being exhibited as
                one&#44; or as some think&#44; becoming miraculously joined together. At present I
                will refer merely to the subsequent portion&#44; which <pb n="219"/> REVEALED
                TRUTHS. 219 is in these words &#40;21&#8211;25&#41;&#58; &#34;And speak unto
                them&#44; Thus hath said the Lord Eternal&#44; Behold&#44; I will take the children
                of Israel from among the nations whither thej are gone&#44; and I will gather them
                from every side and bring them unto their own land&#59; and I will make them into
                one nation in the land&#44; on the moun&#8211; tains of Israel &#59; and one king
                shall be to them all for king&#59; and they shall not be anymore two nations&#44;
                nor shall they at any time be divided into two king&#8211; doms any more&#59;
                neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols&#44; and with their
                detestable things&#44; and with all their transgressions&#59; but I will save them
                out of all their dwelling&#8211;places&#44; wherein they have sinned&#44; and I will
                cleanse them&#59; and they shall be unto me for a people&#44; and I will be unto
                them for a God. And my servant David shall be king over them&#44; and one shepherd
                shall be for them all&#59; and in my ordinances shall they walk&#44; and my statutes
                shall they observe&#44; and do them. And they shall dwell in the land that I have
                given unto my servant&#44; unto Ja cob&#44; wherein your fathers have dwelt &#59;
                and they shall dwell therein&#44; they and their children&#44; and their chil&#8211;
                dren&#39;s children forever&#59; and David&#44; my servant&#44; shall be prince unto
                them forever.&#34; Here it is not declared that the separation and dispersion of
                Israel should be permanent&#59; but&#44; on the contrary&#44; that a united people
                should be brought again to occupy their former coun&#8211; try&#44; which is clearly
                and pointedly described&#44; and cannot be mistaken for any other. We cannot admit
                that the prediction of Ezekiel was fulfilled in the re&#8211; turn from the
                Babj&#8211;lonian exile &#59; for if you examine the books of Ezra and Nehemiah&#44;
                you will find the whole number of those who accompanied Zerubbabel <pb n="220"/> 220

                if we add the few brought over by Ezra&#44; the whole m411 be so small that no
                intelligent mind can maintain that the great and general restoration was thus
                ac&#8211; complished. Moreover&#44; prince David is promised as the future ruler of
                the returned Hebrew nation &#59; but&#44; again&#44; the history of the world does
                not give us any trace of this being accomplished&#59; for as yet no gov&#8211; ernor
                of the ancient line of our kings bears sway in any part of the world&#44; certainly
                not in the land which our forefathers possessed&#44; where we are strangers and
                servants&#44; as it is this day. The only excuse men can frame for refusing to
                believe this prediction is&#44; that 80 great a length of time has elapsed since it
                was ut&#8211; tered&#44; that its accomplishment appears doubtful and uncertain. But
                here again we must refer back to the Authority who gave the inspiration. It is God
                our Creator&#59; He declared that the future should thus shape itself&#44; at a
                period not made known to us&#44; but which He reserves to himself to hasten or to
                retard&#44; according as the world may be prepared for it&#59; and who can therefore
                tell Him that He has foro&#58;otten what He promised&#44; or delays unduly the
                accomplish&#8211; ment of his word &#63; It is&#44; therefore&#44; our duty&#44; as
                the receivers of the divine revelation&#44; to continue stead&#8211; fast at our
                post&#44; and hope on and forever&#44; till the time when the words of prediction
                shall become facts real&#8211; ized in the history of man&#44; as they surely will
                be&#59; be&#8211; cause the One who uttered them is of infinite power and truth&#44;
                and who speaks not a word which returns without fulfilling its mission. There
                are&#44; however&#44; some of Israel who assert that our dispersion was for the
                benefit of the world. The <pb n="221"/> REVEALED TRUTHS. 221 legislation on Sinai
                was calculated only for an exclu&#8211; Bive people&#59; it was separated by
                prohibitory laws from the rest of mankind&#44; and its isolation in Pales&#8211;
                tine was still more calculated to keep it apart from others. But when it ceased to
                be a nation&#44; when its political union was severed by the conquering arm of
                Rome&#44; it received a new mission. It was sent with this into the world at
                large&#44; and it has fulfilled its task by making the word of God known
                everywhere&#44; by scattering universally the blessed principles of love and
                mercy&#44; and giving thus the impulse to the liigh civilization which the diffusion
                of the Scriptures will effect. Those new teachers who argue after this fashion&#44;
                while seemingly giving the greatest weight to the principles and power of the
                Bible&#44; deny at the same time the evident meaning of the words em&#8211; ployed.
                To them restored Israel means a world brought under the dominion of the Divine Word
                by the progress of enlightenment and civilization &#59; the prince David&#44; or the
                scion of David&#44; or the sprout from the root of Jesse&#44; is neither more nor
                less than that the Hebrews in their scattered state shall&#44; as messen&#8211; gers
                of divine truths and by their mere presence&#44; unite the whole world in the
                Avorship of the true God&#44; and thus carry the great principle&#44; which was
                confided to them in their state of isolation&#44; to all sons of men&#44; after
                their national bond was dissolved for the pur&#8211; pose of making them truly
                priests and teachers of the Most High. The language of prophecy is then farther
                interpreted to signify that by this means peace shall be made universal&#59; that
                is&#44; that the difiusion of knowledge is to produce what the words of the Bible
                apply to a single agent&#44; who is generally termed the 19&#42; <pb n="222"/> 222

                far as Israelites are concerned&#44; that we should not expect a personal
                redeemer&#44; nor a national res&#8211; toration &#59; but that we must be content
                with the only redemption which awaits us in common with all the world&#44; the
                prevalence of a universal acknowledg&#8211; ment of the one God&#44; by which means
                the redemp&#8211; tion of mankind from error&#44; barbarity&#44; war&#44; and
                ser&#8211; vitude shall be effected. I will not detain you too long&#44; nor fatigue
                you by elaborate arguments to confute this assumption&#44; wliich is certainly not
                warranted by the plain words of the Bible&#59; but I will merely ask those who teach
                after this fashion for the smallest particle of proof&#44; which could convince us
                that their hopes of a universal acceptance of the true idea of God can be
                accom&#8211; plished in the manner in which the events of history follow each other
                now. Go whither you may&#44; you hear the cries of the defeated and the shouts of
                the victor&#59; chains are unloosed here to be fastened there on the limbs of

                worse&#44; that the reputed mother of the son&#44; the associate god&#44; has

                there in all this the slightest evidence that the theory &#40;I will not speak aught

                worshipped by others of a lower grade&#59; in other lands the prophet of Mecca has
                his followers&#44; who place him high above our teacher&#44; and fancy to find in
                his book a more sacred record than our Scrip&#8211; tures&#59; and among our

                salvation of the world&#44; &#8212; and in a few days they will celebrate the birth

                from eternity&#44; could be born of woman&#44; and be afilicted with the fallible
                and failing nature of mortal man. If the progress is onward&#44; and of this there
                is no doubt&#44; it is still very slow&#44; and no one is wise enough to fix the

                philanthropic philosophy desires to attain. N&#34;o cos&#8211; mopolitan exposition
                of the Scriptures can guide us here&#44; although it may bo averred that all men
                are&#44; equally with Israel&#44; objects of care to the Almighty. We&#44;
                however&#44; who have been taught by God the truths concerning himself and what He
                has given us as the expression of his will&#44; cannot reasonably hesi&#8211; tate
                to adopt in full the belief in the promises He has made for the future&#44; and to
                confide sincerely in their fulfilment in the manner indicated in the Bible&#44; just
                as we adopt with a sincere conviction the eternal truths of which our reason had an
                indistinct percep&#8211; tion&#44; and Avhich revelation has rendered clear and
                intelligible to all understandings. It is not for us to say that God&#39;s method
                for the world&#39;s education is unreasonable&#44; or that we will not bear that
                part which has been allotted to us in this glorious work. It may be painful for us
                to follow out the path assigned to us&#59; but we only accomplish our mission by

                will not fail to employ the proper instruments to reach the proposed end. How

                and though many scaffolds were stained with the blood of fearless martyrs&#44; let
                us not imagine that their sufferings were in vain. Their ashes will ever be piled up

                He promulgated to us on the festival of Pentecost&#44; the second day of which we

                Author of life and the One who in his pleasure blesses our labour. It is deplorable
                that so many of Israel do not seem to understand the real value of the various
                pursuits in which we spend our lives. We must indeed toil to procure what we need
                for our sustenance and that of our families&#59; there is need for employment to
                give vigour to body and mind&#44; which both deteriorate under slothfulness and
                habitual idleness. But we ought not to forget&#44; that it is equally absurd&#44;
                equally pernicious&#44; to force Heaven&#44; as it were&#44; to give us success&#44;
                to bestow on us wealth. &#34;Were it that we could live honourably only through
                unremittent toil&#44; the Lord would not have given us Sabbaths for rest&#44; and
                festive seasons for rejoicing. The Scriptures would have thundered in our ears the

                He gave us the weekly day of rest&#44; that the weary may find repose&#44; that the

                The violation of this command proves conclusively that we have no confidence in the

                Ja&#8211; cob&#44; it is proper that we reflect on what has been accomplished. Till

                is still laro&#8211;e enouc&#8211;h to receive all who now are about to assemble
                here in their daily and weekly devotions. Yet you left&#44; because you felt no
                longer at home in your ancient dwelling&#44; and you have opened this build&#8211;
                ing&#44; of far less extent in space and inferior in beauty&#44; in order to meet
                here to accomplish your religious duties. So let us investigate the object of the

                emblem of which it is established. For our text we will take Isaiah xxvi. 1&#44; 2.

                righteous nation&#44; that guardeth the truth.&#34; Our religion is indeed a strong
                city&#44; and by the Lord&#39;s gracious assistance it is furnished with ram&#8211;
                parts&#44; towers&#44; and walls. On these He has placed the sons of Israel as
                watchmen and defenders &#59; they are not to be slothful in vigilance&#44; nor
                negligent in ward&#8211; ing off the danger. For before the enemy has yet assaulted
                our city&#44; should the watchman proclaim aloud that he is approaching&#44; and all
                who hear the call should be ready to hasten forward to ward off the evil which might
                produce destruction to the cause of God and his people. It is indeed&#44;
                therefore&#44; a momentous work which you have just conipletpd. For&#44; though the
                habitation of the Lord is the entire universe&#44; which exists only in Him&#44; you
                have devoted this place as his dwelling&#44; among others established in Israel. But
                why &#63; Because j&#8211;ou felt that you were expelled&#44; by the majority of
                your former associates&#44; from participating farther in their communion. Mere

                backsliding of those who ought to have been sincere worshippers in the sacred
                precincts which destroyed their sanctity&#59; nothing but the outward shell was left
                to the adversary on which to wreak his vengeance&#59; but the presence of the Lord
                had long since fled&#44; it was no longer his dwelling&#44; no longer
                acceptable&#44; no longer needed&#44; and therefore it fell&#44; and with it the
                people who had sinned&#59; and thus they who had contemned the words of the
                prophets&#44; learnt by sad experience&#44; that mere outward wor&#8211; ship&#44;
                lip&#8211;service&#44; is an abomination to the God of truth&#44; who requires the
                heart and spirit to be united in his adoration. A place of worship for Israel must
                have something more than beauty and spaciousness to sanc&#8211; tify it&#44;
                something far more than psalmody&#44; and music&#44; and oratory to dedicate it as
                an acceptable offering to the Most High &#58; it is the complete surrendering of our
                will to his will&#44; the subjecting of our inclinations to his commands&#44; the
                yielding of our entire selves to his guidance&#44; which alone can effect this &#59;
                and with this every place wdiere we assemble in his Name will become a centre whence

                ample and beautiful &#59; it was natural that you should feel a deep attachment for
                the struc&#8211; ture where you had spent so many hours of devotion&#44; where you
                so often experienced the joy of a sincere period of religious reunion&#44; on those
                solemn days when all assemble&#44; as one man&#44; to do honour to Israel&#39;s
                King. Nor were you bidden by your associates to quit them&#59; you might have stayed
                among them&#44; and accepted the rules they would establish&#44; and the new form of

                this consistently with the charac&#8211; ter of true believers&#44; and
                s&#8211;eeing that the majority was against you&#44; and likely to increase in
                process of time&#44; you regarded the late proceedings of your fellow&#8211; members
                tantamount to a decree of expulsion&#44; unless you would submit to what you justly
                conceived un&#8211; becoming your religious character. Therefore you quitted the old

                for our transgression &#40;Levit&#44; xxvi. 38&#41; &#59; for if we wished not to do
                needful battle for our and God&#39;s cause&#44; why should we not disappear from the
                earth&#44; as so many nations of antiquity have done &#63; what was to be con&#8211;
                served&#44; if not our law&#63; yet how could we exist with&#8211; out it &#63; It
                was this the rulers of the world understood fully as well as we&#59; and therefore
                they strove to make our days bitter&#44; and render our life a burden to us. But the
                more fierce grew the persecution&#44; the narrower appeared the field on which we
                could move&#58; the more intense grew our devotion to the divine legacy&#44; the
                more confirmed became our devotion. Thus though we were fearfully diminished in
                numbers&#44; though banished from what we fain regarded as our homes&#44; though
                turned out naked and famishing upon the wide world&#58; we still saved&#44; as our
                imperishable in&#8211; heritance&#44; the law of Moses&#44; which had been confided
                to us for safekeeping&#44; and it is ours at this day. Our constancy&#44;
                however&#44; at length wearied out the spirit of hostility of our opponents&#44; who
                clearly saw that the finger of God was in our preservation&#44; who never sufiered
                us to be banished at once from all countries&#44; and opened up for us always an
                asylum&#44; where we might rest awhile to recover from the rapine and slauditer&#44;
                and to be refreshed with new strength&#59; and they learned by degrees to treat us
                more kindly&#44; and not to hunt down the sons of Israel &#34; like a part&#8211;
                rido&#8211;e on the mountains.&#34; And now we have a time of respite&#59; whether
                our peace is to last forever or not is more than I will venture to say &#59; but at
                least now we are unmolested in many countries&#44; and we can <pb n="244"/> 244 OUR

                part of the civil authorities. But the usual results of ease are already visible
                among us&#44; and now men have arisen who endeavour to place a new construction upon
                our ancestral religion&#44; and strive to rob us of our hopes for the future&#44;
                which ever cheered us on in the seasons of the deepest gloom&#44; and caused us to
                look with the confidence of a future triumph for our principles&#44; in the
                Lord&#39;s own good time&#44; over the puny though mighty efforts of vain and
                presumptuous men. These leaders seem to forget that our sunshine may continue only
                for awhile&#59; in days of comparative ease&#44; it is possible then&#44; we might
                be able to sustain ourselves simply as a sect which has its members scattered
                everywhere&#44; held together by a community of certain principles and
                practices&#44; more or less valued and adhered to. But this even is doubt&#8211;
                ful&#44; it is as yet an untried experiment. We always regarded ourselves&#44; and
                were so looked upon by the world&#44; as a nation or a people&#44; in the words of

                truths enun&#8211; ciated by the Bible&#44; the traces of the conflict are plainly
                visible in the councils of our neighbours&#59; the authority of priests has greatly
                waned&#44; and many people no longer receive the dicta of the church with the same
                implicit yieldingness as heretofore. It is possible indeed&#44; that the issue of
                the conflict will ultimately be&#44; that men may resort to Jewish inter&#8211;

                of our fathers&#44; to celebrate this second day of the festival of our redemption
                from Egypt. To the true Israelite there is a higher duty than to enjoy the pleasures
                of this life &#59; he must not pluck the roses as they bloom&#44; nor call a day
                mis&#8211; spent on which he has not tasted the cup of joy. For if this were all for

                pleasure&#59; unless you would assume that the earth and its fulness were created

                relaxation as much as any son of toil. There is enough to be done by the children of
                afflu&#8211; ence&#44; if they Avill employ their time to their own ad&#8211;
                vantage and the promotion of the general welfare &#59; there is no need of their
                hunting constantly the phan&#8211; tom pleasure&#44; and deceitful enjoyment&#59;
                and just in proportion as they solve the problem which their po&#8211; sition has
                imposed on them&#44; will they be benefactors of their fellows&#44; or injurious to
                the peace of society. That so many fail in this&#44; is only another proof that man
                is apt to mistake the apparent for the real good&#59; just as those whose condition
                calls on them to struggle for their daily bread&#44; often fall into habits of
                slothful&#8211; ness&#44; and become useless to their families and a bur&#8211; den
                to society at large. All classes of men should take heed that they fulfil what their
                duties demand of them&#59; and then will they have no cause to accuse the
                All&#8211;just for having neglected them&#44; especially in the distribution of his
                manifold gifts among the sons of man. With these remarks prefaced let us consider a
                por&#8211; tion of the law&#8211;section which we have read this day. &#34; When ye
                shall have come into the land which I give unto you and reap the harvest
                thereof&#58; then shall ye bring an &#39;omer full of the first of your har&#8211;
                vest unto the priest. And neither bread&#44; nor parched corn&#44; nor green
                ears&#44; shall ye eat&#44; until the self&#8211;same day&#44; until ye have brought
                the ofteriug of your God.&#34; And the text thus continues &#59; <pb n="255"/> THE
                &#39;OMER. 255 &#34;And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the holy
                day&#44; from the day that ye bring the &#39;omer of the wave&#8211; offering&#44;
                that it be seven complete weeks &#8212; and ye shall then offer a new
                meat&#8211;offering unto the Lord.&#34; Levit. xxiii. 10&#8211;16. I have condensed
                the passage&#44; selecting the main points&#44; which refer to our subject. The
                feast of Pass&#8211; over was in Palestine the commencement of the
                barley&#8211;harvest&#44; this being the first grain that ripens there. It might
                have been in early seasons which occur at times&#44; that a man&#39;s field was ripe
                before the feast&#59; if now he were of right permitted to use what is his as he
                pleases&#44; he might have cut his grain&#44; and prepared it in the manner
                indicated in the Scriptures&#44; which was no doubt the custom of the country&#44;
                and enjoyed what his land had produced for him. But the commandment steps in between
                him and his inclina&#8211; tion&#44; and tells him that until the people had&#44;
                through their delegates&#44; brought a small portion of the new harvest to the
                sanctuary&#44; no one should presume to call an ear his own &#59; not until Israel
                had annually acknowledged that the increase of the soil was in very truth the
                Lord&#39;s&#44; who graciously permitted them to partake of his bounty&#44; should a
                mortal claim the right to dispose of what otherwise may be his own. And why&#63; You
                can easily frame the answer. It was to teach us that we are responsible for the use
                of our means to a higher Source than man &#59; that we should not say&#44; We have
                laboured&#44; we have succeeded&#44; and the fruits of our toil are justly our own.
                For this was the doctrine of Judaism &#58; namely&#44; that we are mere stewards on
                earth&#44; to hold our possessions at the will and disposal of the Grantor of our
                prosperity&#44; and that hence it may be resumed justly&#44; should we trans&#8211;
                    <pb n="256"/> 256 THE &#39;OMER. gress the conditions of our tenure&#44; and
                disregard the restrictions wbieli have been imposed on us. It was tlms that the
                wealthiest in Israel&#44; naj the chief of the state&#44; could not anticipate&#44;
                while he obeyed the law&#44; the period when all might partake of the earth&#39;s
                pro&#8211; ducts&#44; and thus all were practically taught that wealth and
                possessions were not absolute property&#44; but only held for the advantage of all
                who are like them the sons of faith&#44; and children of the same parentage. But
                after thus introducing the cycle of the annual festivals&#44; that period especially
                which marks the time between the redemption and the promulgation of the law&#44; a
                peculiar commandment was given us to number actually the forty&#8211;nine days which
                elapse be&#8211; tween these periods&#44; and to note the fiftieth especially as a
                day of a renewed offering to the Lord. Let us attempt an illustration. We may assume
                the Pass&#8211; over to be the period of our early manhood&#44; when the age of
                childhood and youth are already past by. In infancy we scarcely heed the days as
                they glide past. They are bedecked with sunshine or overcast by evanescent clouds.
                Few indeed remember the age of childhood&#44; seldom an hour thereof is impressed on
                the memory. So also when the youth prepares him&#8211; self for his calling&#44; he
                is under the tutelage of parents&#44; or guardians&#44; or those in whose charge he
                may be placed&#44; and happy will it be for him if he is judiciously guided&#44;
                carefully controlled&#44; and wisely instructed. So was our education as a people in
                Egypt. &#34;We went thither iu the boyhood so to say of our nationality&#44; and iu
                the iron furnace of afiliction we were taught to look up to our eternal Saviour for
                enlargement&#44; as all the gods of men&#39;s invention are helpless them&#8211; <pb
                    n="257"/> THE &#39;OMER. 257 selves&#44; without power to withstand the
                Almighty&#39;s fiat. This our redemption proved. The stubborn will of Egypt&#39;s
                people and king had to yield before the outstretched arm of the Most High&#44; and
                He led us forth with joy&#44; that we should not be any more the slaves of man&#44;
                but servants to our Redeemer. Our youth and its struggles were ended&#44; and the
                period of our tutelage was overpast&#44; when the hosts of the Lord were led forth
                with a high hand&#44; as the Scrip&#8211; tures call it&#44; by his chosen
                messenger. As it is with nations&#44; so it is with individuals&#59; when the age of
                irresponsibility is over&#44; that of independ&#8211; ence and its accompanying
                accountability commence. We cannot fix the precise date when this eventful change
                takes place in us &#59; but the Bible has assigned the twentieth year as the one
                when the Israelite&#44; after having at his thirteenth year entered into his
                indivi&#8211; dual responsibility to his Maker&#44; became a full mem&#8211; ber of
                the state&#44; bound to go out with the armed host of his countrymen to defend the
                soil against invasion&#44; whether the assailants were many or few. No one could be
                exempted from this patriotic duty&#44; except those who&#44; elsewhere &#40;Deut.
                xx. 5&#8211;8&#41;&#44; were excused by public proclamation from participating in
                the con&#8211; flict. But in point of fact all Israelites having equal rights had
                equal duties &#59; and no one could devolve on another the right which his home and
                his country had on the valour of his arms. The Psalmist says&#44; that our days on
                earth are seventy years&#44; and rarely reach eighty&#59; experience proves the
                correctness of this ancient statement&#44; and when we reach the verge of threescore
                and ten&#44; we lose the elasticity of our steps&#44; the vigour of our limbs&#59;

                intellect&#44; perhaps&#44; becomes uncer&#8211; tain and vague&#44; and those on
                whose advice nations depended&#44; those who moved public assemblies by their
                fervent eloquence&#44; the poets who charmed mul&#8211; titudes by the sweetness of
                their numbers&#44; musicians whose tuneful strains have become the delight of the
                world&#44; are now only shadows of their former selves&#44; and they linger
                perchance awhile longer on the stage of life&#44; to be soon and inevitably gathered
                to the home destined for all the living. The picture is sad and depressing&#59; it
                is what awaits us all&#59; we cannot avoid the pangs of disease nor the terror of
                dissolution &#59; they tower up before us in the dim though sure distance&#44; and
                neither craven fear nor daring in&#8211; difference can ward off what &#91;The proof
                down to this word was sent to Mr. Leeser on December 28th&#44; 1867&#44; but he
                never recovered suffi&#8211; cient strength to complete the writing of the sermon. A
                few days after the receipt of the proof he wrote on it the following&#44; which he
                intended for the printer. It was found among his papers after his death &#58; &#34;I

                I feel easier&#44; but suffer greatly. L.&#34; The twenty lines alluded to have not
