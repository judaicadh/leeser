                                        mutual friend <persName>Mr. Touro</persName> is a man
                                        deliberate<lb/> and cautious in his plans and movements. It
                                        is natural at his advanced<lb/> age. However the property is
                                        now in the hands of the congregation. The<lb/> good old man
                                        signed the act, which gave away $150,000. for such is
                                        the<lb/> value of the land and buildings, as calmly and
                                        coolly as tho' it were an<lb/> ordinary transaction, I am
                                        convinced that the idea, of having thus handed<lb/> his name
                                        down to posterity as a munificent and princely upholder
                                        of<lb/> the institutions of his people, never crossed his
                                        mind. He is without<lb/> exception, one of the most
                                        single-hearted men I ever encountered. His<lb/> ruling
                                        thought is filial reverence; and the gift of the synagogue arises<lb/>
                                        <del>more</del> as much from a desire to do honor to the
                                        memory of his father <del>than</del> as any other.<lb/> Such
                                        a man deserves some testimonial expressive of his
                                        coreligionists'<lb/> esteem. It has occupied the thoughts of
                                        many here, but he is so retiring<lb/> unostentatious, and
                                        modest, as to preclude the hope of his willingness<lb/> to
                                        receive any mark of regard. When you come on, we should have
                                        the benefit of your<lb/> counsel; for something must be done
                                        to save us from the charge of<lb/> ingratitude, or not
                                        properly appreciating his disinterestedness and<lb/>
                                        patriotism. He has further designs for the promotion and
                                        diffusion<lb/> of religious instruction among the rising
                                        generation, which will in time<lb/> be matured and
                                        perfected. He holds you in great esteem, and has<lb/>

                                        together with the amount of business he<lb/> has to transact
                                        in his own office, I might have been induced to suppose<lb/>
                                        that his silence as a correspondent arose from
                                        disinclination to<lb/> write. It is impossible for you to
