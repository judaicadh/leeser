            <p><addressee>Board of Editors American Hebrew</addressee>,</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">In your issue of <date>February<lb/> 4th</date> you <del>ha</del>
                published an editorial article entitled<lb/> "the Mouthpiece of American
                Israelites." As is not<lb/> rare with you there is a certain amount of wrath<lb/>
                developed, and you denounce something as being<lb/> "a sham and without
                foundation."</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)"><del>
                    <add>?</add>
                </del> An editor who desires to enlighten<lb/> his readers should endeavor to treat
                his subjects<lb/> with full information and calm judgment, and<lb/> there should be
                still more wisdom in a whole<lb/> Board of Editors.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Let, us dispassionately examine whether your<lb/> article is really
                one that ought to have been printed.<lb/> The question involved is this: "Shall the
                Israelites<lb/> of the <placeName>United States</placeName> be content to leave
                    <del>any corresp-<lb/>ondence with the State Department on the subject of<lb/>
                    Jewish wrongs in foreign countries</del> to the Board of<lb/> Delegates any
                correspondence with the State Department on the subject of Jewish wrongs in foreign
                countries or shall every society or union or<lb/> individual exercise its their his
                or her <del>right</del><lb/> undoubted right to address the Secretary of State<lb/>
                on any subject whatever?"</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">It ought not to be forgotten that the <del>liberty</del><lb/>
                <del>of</del> government of the <placeName>United States</placeName> are not and
                ought<lb/> not to abandon its traditional policy of non-inter-<lb/>vention in other
                nations' affairs for the Jews or any</p>

            <p>one else and that nothing more than polite remonstrances<lb/> will ever be obtained
                from our Secretary. That these<lb/> may sometimes be useful is true but in the
                far<lb/> greater number of cases they must remain<lb/> without practical result.
                Thence it follows that<lb/> there is rarely such <del>support</del> urgency for
                Jewish<lb/> memorials to the State Department as some<lb/> excitable editors and
                others think. And it<lb/> follows likewise that the Secretary must not be
                harassed<lb/> by <del>inflammatory</del> excited papers based on the<lb/> wildest
                rumors. <del>The</del> Yet if every one <del>will immediately</del><lb/>
                <del>proceed to</del> who reads an anti-Semitic telegram<lb/> in a newspaper were to <del>
                    <add>?</add>
                </del> write a letter to<lb/> the Department praying for Governmental
                interference<lb/> with <placeName>Germany</placeName>, the result would necessarily
                be<lb/> that the Secretary <del>would do nothing for fear that</del><lb/> would come
                to <del>look upon some</del> dread all com-<lb/>munications upon Jewish wrongs and
                in order<lb/> not to make himself ridiculous in the eyes of<lb/> foreign nations
                would never take action on any<lb/> such matter without <del>much addition
                    such</del> an<lb/> accumulation of evidence <del>as to</del> which would dispel
                all doubt,<lb/> whereas if the subject is left to one attentive body,<lb/> with
                trustworthy connections abroad, which body<lb/> never speaks until it has real
                knowledge and<lb/> then only with the judgment and moderation<lb/> born of
                experience and reflection, no one can<lb/> doubt that the representations of such a
                body will<lb/> have real weight.</p>

            <p>The Board of Delegates has performed this duty for nearly<lb/> a quarter of a century
                    <del>and</del> at first <del>by</del> as an independent<lb/> organization and
                latterly as a committee of the<lb/> Union of American Hebrew Congregations.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">No <del>man</del> one has questioned <del>that</del> the good sense
                    <del>and</del><lb/>
                <del>has always characterized, its actions</del> or fidelity<lb/> of its proceedings
                in this respect, <del>and now you</del> until your<lb/> paper began its attacks upon
                the Union, and I<lb/> do not even understand you to say that the work<lb/> could be
                better done, but rather that it should be<lb/> done by somebody else.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">On that point I suppose no one will quarrel<lb/> with you least of
                all the members of the Board of<lb/> Delegates. <del>If</del> They will all no doubt
                cheerfully<lb/> make way for any successors that may be appointed.<lb/> That however
                is not what would seem to satisfy<lb/> you.</p>
