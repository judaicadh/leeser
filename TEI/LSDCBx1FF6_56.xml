          <p rend="indent(1)"><placeName>Philadelphia</placeName></p>
          <p rend="indent(2)">Dear Friend&#44;</p>
          <p rend="indent(3)">Yours from <placeName>Baltimore</placeName> I duly<lb/> received but have been unable to acknowledge it till<lb/> now. You are more fortunate than I in being able to<lb/> run about and get a little recreation. I had fully determined<lb/> to take a short time about the country but L&#39;homme proposes<lb/> et Dieu disposes. I put it off till this week when a<lb/> child of <persName>Mr Moss</persName> dies of cholera and I am fixed&#44; a veritable<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>. In respect to &#8220;the mystery in connection with a<lb/> lady in <placeName>Montreal</placeName>&#8221; I have to remark &#40;the ladies of course<lb/> claiming first attention from we modern Rabbanim&#41;since<lb/> <persName>S Selig newman</persName> says in a sermon preached at the <placeName>London</placeName><lb/> Jewish free school&#44; &#8220;the key <add>&#63;</add> used formerly to be <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> but now&#44; complains <persName>newman</persName>&#44; perhaps from actual<lb/> experience poor fellow&#44; &#8220;it is <add>Hebrew</add>&#8221;&#44; the Lecture<lb/> meant no doubt pathetically to say we had been <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> enough&#44; and so allowed the ladies to turn &#38; <add>&#63;</add> at us<lb/> in the <add>Hebrew</add> form.&#41; but to <add>&#63;</add> from this long<lb/> parenthesis to the &#8220;mystery&#8221; Did I mention my lady&#63;<lb/> Certainly not and yet you seem very anxious to assure<lb/> me that &#8220;nothing has ever passed between us&#8221;<add>&#63;</add> who<lb/> are us&#63; You are one&#44; and who is the second&#8212;Oh<lb/> you guilty man&#33; You can&#39;t keep a secret too&#44; I find.<lb/> It is certainly very kind of you to hope the lady <sic>wont</sic><lb/> refuse a good match&#44; even myself&#44; in your account after I already</p>
		<pb n="2"/>
			<p>wrote you that I would not stand in your way &#40;<add>&#63;</add><lb/> of me.&#41; But seriously&#44; my respected friend&#44; I do not presume<lb/> to suggest myself less to dictate to you who shall be your partner if what<lb/> you tell me will be the downward course of your life&#44;<lb/> nor <hi rend="underline">when</hi> you shall take her. You are better competent<lb/> to decide these yourself&#44; I hope that the little <persName>M<add>&#63;</add></persName><lb/> at banter in which I have indulged may have been<lb/> not <sic>agreable</sic> to you In dismissing &#40;for the present&#33;&#41;<lb/> this soft subject let me say in justice to the young<lb/> ladies to whom we have alluded that we might<lb/> both &#8220;go farther and fail worse&#8221; As for me&#44; my dear<lb/> friend&#44; if you find yourself &#8220;not in a situation to<lb/> marry&#8221;&#44; I also find myself in such a situation. You<lb/> only hold your situation for a year longer&#44; I have<lb/> mine for three only&#44; from present date&#44; Besides &#8220;I<lb/> am not young&#8221; and am too busily employed for<lb/> self and others to think of marriage for a few years<lb/> and <add>Hebrew</add> When I have done a little more &#40;if I may<lb/> be presumptuous enough to say I have done anything&#41; for<lb/> <hi rend="underline">the cause</hi> I shall then be entitled to spend a few<lb/> hours in the pleasures of domesticity as<lb/> a reward for my work. You are now fully entitled<lb/> to such a partial rest&#44; and nothing would afford<lb/> me greater pleasure than to receive a call from you<lb/> to introduce you &#40;<add>Hebrew</add> into the happy <add>&#63;</add><lb/> At the same time I confess that it would be a <hi rend="underline">little</hi><lb/> gratifying to me if I were in a position to ask the same of you.</p>
		<pb n="3"/>
			<p>It was with regret and surprise that I recd your account<lb/> of the manner in which you as yet find yourself remunerated<lb/> for your writings&#44; thus&#44; mon ami&#44; le temps viendra.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">It would give me much pleasure to make the<lb/> acquaintance of Mrs as also of <persName>Mr Cohen</persName> of <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>&#44;<lb/> persons of whom fame speaks so favorably here&#44; I gave<lb/> <persName>Mrs <sic>Cohens</sic></persName> message to <persName>Mrs <add>&#63;</add> Solomons</persName>&#44; <persName>Mrs S</persName> desires<lb/> me to ask you when you are going to <placeName>New Orleans</placeName><lb/> <persName>Mr Touro</persName> of that place is related to them&#44; and you<lb/> know how it is when we have rich relations&#44; we like<lb/> to know something of their whereabouts. She would<lb/> also like to know where <persName>Mr Touro</persName> is living in <placeName>New Orleans</placeName><lb/> I gave your message to <persName>Mr Jacob Joseph</persName>&#44; but as his<lb/> brother <persName>Pepe</persName> and sister <persName>Esther</persName> are in your city you<lb/> can make your own explanations to the <add>Hebrew</add></p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">The Occident for <date>September</date> has not arrived yet<lb/> so cannot say anything on matters literary&#44; The<lb/> articles on the Jews of <placeName>Persia</placeName> I shall not be able to<lb/> <sic>commense</sic> <sic>untill</sic> after <add>Hebrew</add>. It is seldom or never<lb/> that I stipulate for special time for <del>the Oc</del> my articles<lb/> but in the case of sermons I do&#44; I have published<lb/> scarcely other than occasional sermons which<lb/> loose their interest and effect when the cause or<lb/> event they speak upon is part. Thus my<lb/> Sermon on the cholera would have been much more<lb/> seasonable reading for your readers while the<lb/> epidemic prevailed&#44; and might have been to me<lb/> more effect&#44; so a sermon I sent you for</p>
		<pb n="4"/>
			<p><add>Hebrew</add> was published a &#8220;day after the fair&#8221; In future I must<lb/> trouble you to let me know when I send a sermon whether<lb/> it can be published at the time required as I would then<lb/> prefer its not being published at all if not at the<lb/> specified time.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">You have been made aware long before this of the<lb/> visit of <persName>Dr Raphael</persName> and <persName>Dr Isaacs</persName> to the <placeName>United States</placeName>.<lb/> The latter <add>&#63;</add> avowedly to seek for a situation in <placeName>America</placeName><lb/> the former to make a little fortune by lecturing<lb/> and as the chronicle tells us will no doubt be<lb/> permanently engaged in the <placeName>United States</placeName>. I hope<lb/> both these gentlemen for their sakes will not find<lb/> themselves mistaken. I am not sanguine enough<lb/> of you Yankee Israelites to believe that <persName>Dr Raphael</persName><lb/> will find a better situation than the one he filled<lb/> at <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> &#38; which yielded him &#163;500 sterling<lb/> It would be uncharitable to <hi rend="underline">believe</hi> all that is said<lb/> of <persName>Mr D Isaacs</persName>&#44; but he was spoke of both in<lb/> <placeName>London</placeName> and elsewhere as possessing a temper not at all<lb/> likely to <add>&#63;</add> success. Let me hear what you<lb/> think of the contemplated visits. I have now written<lb/> your <add>&#63;</add> fully and must therefore close. Wishing<lb/> you many happy returns of the coming <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> and praying that the coming year may be to<lb/> you <add>Hebrew</add></p>
