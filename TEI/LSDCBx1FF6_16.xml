                              <p rend="indent(1)">I was not a little surprised at your remarks on
                                        my<lb/> article “<add>?</add>
                                        <add>?</add> &amp; their opponents,” you say—“the theme,”
                                        our<lb/> opponents' admits of a much larger elucidation than
                                        you have<lb/> yet given it. You surely must have found (if
                                        you went through<lb/> the commencement of the article) that
                                        I write “I shall reserve what<lb/> I have to say until I
                                        bring forward the quotations I speak of”<lb/> It does appear
                                        to me that you judge too hastily when you<lb/> condemn one
                                        (friendly enough I know) for not doing what<lb/> cannot be
                                        done at once but is proposed to be done in the course<lb/>
                                        of the article. I start with propositions that Hebrew
                                        authors<lb/> have been maligned abused and misrepresented
                                        now as friends would<lb/> not do this for there they must

                              <p>my proposition. I begin with a quotation from Peritsol<add>?</add>
                                        as one,<lb/> when I have concluded my quotation I shall add
                                        some more<lb/> remarks which I had intended writing in
                                        explanation, and<lb/> which would embrace the objection you
                                        make or suggest against<lb/> my course viz of “selling the
                                        point in an off hand manner<lb/> which may do very well for
                                        an orator but not in a philosophical inquiry,”<lb/> Now I
                                        have no wish to settle the point in this way and so you<lb/>
                                        shall see, and indeed I think the lengthy apology I make
                                        for<lb/> a chapter that Peritsol<add>?</add> never should
                                        have written is a proof of<lb/> this. In short and in
                                        conclusion. I say Hebrew writers have<lb/> been
                                        misrepresented and I prove it by quotations from those<lb/>
                                        who have attacked them, their opponents, and let this
                                        be<lb/> enough on a subject that can't be over and above
                                        interesting<lb/> to you.</p>
