			<p><addressee>Rev Isaac Leeser</addressee></p>
          <p rend="indent(1)"><placeName>Philadelphia</placeName></p>
          <p rend="indent(3)">My dear Friend</p>
          <p rend="indent(4)">Many thanks for your kind attention<lb/> in forwarding me the books for our newly established Sunday School.<lb/> <persName>Mr J H Joseph</persName> having some time back sent me a parcel of such<lb/> books&#44; I shall not require for <hi rend="underline">the present</hi> any others there one or two<lb/> dozen of Pykes Catechism which I have requested <persName>Miss Gratz</persName> in the<lb/> enclosed note &#40;which I must ask you to to hand her&#41; to let us have.<lb/> I am sorry that I did not hear from you by mail as you<lb/> intended I should&#44; but am more sorry that the cause was<lb/> indisposition. I sincerely hope&#44; dear friend that you are more<lb/> perfectly well and able to apply yourself to your usual labors.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I was not a little surprised at your remarks on my<lb/> article &#8220;<add>&#63;</add> <add>&#63;</add> &#38; their opponents&#44;&#8221; you say&#8212;&#8220;the theme&#44;&#8221; our<lb/> opponents&#39; admits of a much larger elucidation than you have<lb/> yet given it. You surely must have found &#40;if you went through<lb/> the commencement of the article&#41; that I write &#8220;I shall reserve what<lb/> I have to say until I bring forward the quotations I speak of&#8221;<lb/> It does appear to me that you judge too hastily when you<lb/> condemn one &#40;friendly enough I know&#41; for not doing what<lb/> cannot be done at once but is proposed to be done in the course<lb/> of the article. I start with propositions that Hebrew authors<lb/> have been maligned abused and misrepresented now as friends would<lb/> not do this for there they must ergo have opponents&#44; I quote<lb/> from P<add>&#63;</add> &#38; Eregoire 2 grossly illiberal one <add>&#63;</add> attacks<lb/> in proof&#44; reserving for hereafter other illustrations and proofs of</p>
		<pb n="2"/>
			<p>my proposition. I begin with a quotation from Peritsol<add>&#63;</add> as one&#44;<lb/> when I have concluded my quotation I shall add some more<lb/> remarks which I had intended writing in explanation&#44; and<lb/> which would embrace the objection you make or suggest against<lb/> my course viz of &#8220;selling the point in an off hand manner<lb/> which may do very well for an orator but not in a philosophical inquiry&#44;&#8221;<lb/> Now I have no wish to settle the point in this way and so you<lb/> shall see&#44; and indeed I think the lengthy apology I make for<lb/> a chapter that Peritsol<add>&#63;</add> never should have written is a proof of<lb/> this. In short and in conclusion. I say Hebrew writers have<lb/> been misrepresented and I prove it by quotations from those<lb/> who have attacked them&#44; their opponents&#44; and let this be<lb/> enough on a subject that can&#39;t be over and above interesting<lb/> to you.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I feel proud of your good opinion in thinking I am qualified<lb/> to refute what able and learned tho bejothed men have brought<lb/> against our writers and Rabbis. Although I am aware &#40;thank<lb/> God for enlightening me&#41; that I am <hi rend="underline">not</hi> &#8220;of the class <add>Hebrew</add>&#8221; still<lb/> I have sufficient common sense to know that there are others more<lb/> qualified for such a taste and nothing would give me greater pleasure<lb/> than to see yourself and many others in <placeName>America</placeName> set about it.<lb/> I only want the credit for suggesting such an employment if<lb/> it deserve any&#44; and if it do not then I <sic>dont</sic> want any. I am<lb/> very well convinced that all you write is based on good feelings<lb/> towards me&#44; and I would not have you understand anything else from what I have written above. I am not too proud<lb/> to receive suggestions from <hi rend="underline">you</hi> tho&#39; I might be from ours<lb/> I don&#39;t mind the stroke of the hour but I <sic>dont</sic> like the<lb/> kick of the ass. <add>&#63;</add> in the latter case I always feel</p>
		<pb n="3"/>
			<p>inclined to kick again.</p>
			<p>I gave your respects best regard compliments &#38; I was going<lb/> to say love&#44; to the ladies and some of these to <persName>Dr. &#38; Mrs David</persName><lb/> By the way the latter may <add>&#63;</add> say <add>Hebrew</add>.<lb/> <persName>Mrs A H David</persName> presented her lord this morning with another son and heir.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I could not communicate with my friend or any one else in<lb/> <placeName>London</placeName> competent to undertake the office of Hazan for <placeName>Richmond</placeName><lb/> unless I was aware of all particulars. You say the salary and<lb/> perquesites would <hi rend="underline">probably</hi> be &#163;200 stlng<add>&#63;</add>. What is the actual<lb/> salary&#63; Would they pay his passage out from <placeName>England</placeName>&#63; Would<lb/> they elect him for life&#63; What are the number of families belonging<lb/> to the P. Congregation&#63; Are there fees for marriages etc&#63; Does the Congreg<lb/> provide a dwelling house for him&#63; and are rents high&#63; These are<lb/> questions it appears to me that the applicant should be enlightend<lb/> on&#44; and if you will answer them to me in your next favor<lb/> &#40;which I hope will be soon&#41; I would write &#8220;right off&#8221; to <placeName>England</placeName><lb/> It would be as well to say whether they require a married man<lb/> and whether in case there is no house of the Cong whether he could<lb/> board out. By the way&#44; how comes it that <persName>Mr Lyons</persName> has<lb/> left&#44; and why would not his congregation take him back. I<lb/> understood he was much liked there.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">You omitted sending me a double number of the Oc containing<lb/> my article. I have therefore requested <persName>Mr Joseph</persName> to send me one</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">There is nothing of interest to write you just now&#44; so I conclude<lb/> expecting to hear from you soon I am dear Friend</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">Very Sincerely yours</p>
          <p rend="indent(2)"><persName role="author">Abraham de Sola</persName></p>
			<p>Please send me an extra No next time&#8212;<lb/> I will send you in the course of next week<lb/> a lecture for the <date>Passover</date>&#44; if published let it<lb/> be in the No just before <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; if you can&#39;t<lb/> publish it then&#44; don&#39;t publish it at all.</p>
