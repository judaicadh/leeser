				<p>There is however a good underplot that few<lb/> know&#44; but which I can unfold.</p>
				<p>Let me premise that <hi rend="underline">all parties</hi> here&#8212;our friend<lb/> <del><persName>Dr Eckman</persName></del> <persName>J. J. Jones</persName> amongst the rest were anxious<lb/> to have <persName>Dr Eckman</persName> elected here.  The question<lb/> was&#44; will <persName>Dr E.</persName> accept&#8212;which was doubtful<lb/> as the Dr was on his way to <placeName>N. O.</placeName> with a view<lb/> for election there&#8212;in fact he was &#8220;up for<lb/> <sic>cowes</sic> &#38; a market&#8212;Well <hi rend="underline">they</hi> &#40;I think<lb/> our worthy friend <persName>J. J. J</persName>.&#41;&#44; persuaded <persName>Dr E.</persName> to stop in<lb/> <placeName>Mobile</placeName> &#38; examine things before going to <placeName>N. O.</placeName>&#8212;<lb/>  He did so&#8212;remained some days&#44; including a<lb/> <date>Sabbath</date>&#44; preached to the congregation&#44; had all the<lb/> advantages graphically described by <persName>Israel I.</persName> to him<lb/> of <placeName>Mobile</placeName> as a locale for a congregation &#38;c &#38;c. &#38; was<lb/> then permitted to go to <placeName>N. O.</placeName>&#8212;After spending<lb/> some days in <placeName>N. O.</placeName> preaching there I believe&#44; <persName>Dr E.</persName><lb/> returned to <placeName>Mobile</placeName>&#8212;Now comes the fun&#8212;<hi rend="underline">They</hi><lb/> &#40;<persName>J. J. J</persName> believe&#41; commenced <add>&#63;</add> <persName>Dr E.</persName> as they did<lb/> not wish to elect him &#38; then have him decline<lb/> the election whilst <persName>Dr E.</persName> fought shy &#38; would<lb/> not commit himself either way.  A few days<lb/> before the election here took place &#8220;<hi rend="underline">Sixteen</hi><lb/> numbers of the <placeName>N. O.</placeName> congregation met &#38; elected<lb/> <persName>Dr E.</persName> for one year at &#36;1800.  The <placeName>Mobile</placeName> election<lb/> was close at hand &#38; every means was tried to get<lb/> the Dr to say <hi rend="underline">aye</hi> or <hi rend="underline">no</hi> that he would serve<lb/> here if elected&#8212;he refused to do so&#8212;the electoral<lb/> committee were in a stew&#8212;they had no candidate</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>to present for election &#40;<persName>Dr E.</persName> had not yet replied<lb/> to the <placeName>N. O.</placeName> election&#41; at a private caucus it<lb/> seems that <persName>Dave Solomons</persName> suggested to elect <hi rend="underline">you</hi><lb/> to the office in place of <persName>Dr E.</persName> but would you<lb/> accept&#63;  To ascertain this <persName>Jones</persName> trotted off<lb/> to me&#8212;I told him I would use my influence<lb/> towards it &#38; if the salary was not large enough<lb/> the <persName>Wolff</persName> family would contribute &#36;100. pr annum<lb/> towards enlarging the salary&#8212;this was midday<lb/> of the evening for election&#8212;<persName>Jones</persName> bothered me<lb/> to say positively whether you would accept or not<lb/> &#38; I finally told him I thought you would although<lb/> I knew to the contrary&#8212;with this assurance he was<lb/> forced to be content &#38; then went &#38; told <persName>D. E.</persName> that<lb/> if he did not say <hi rend="underline">positively</hi> that he would accept<lb/> if elected they would not even consider him as a<lb/> candidate.  <persName>Dr E.</persName> still refused to say aye or no &#38;<lb/> <persName>Jones</persName> left him &#38; went into the committee room<lb/> It was then announced that no definite answer<lb/> could be obtained from <persName>Dr E.</persName> &#38; our friend <persName>J. J. J</persName><lb/> stood up to propose you as a fit subject for<lb/> election&#8212;at this moment in rushed <persName>Jim</persName> who<lb/> was on the committee &#8220;It is all right <persName>Dr E</persName><lb/> will accept if elected unanimously.  On<lb/> being <sic>question</sic> he repeated that <persName>Dr E.</persName> had told<lb/> him so &#38; that he had just left him.<lb/>  On this <persName>Dr E.</persName> was elected unanimously Hazan&#44;<lb/> Rabbi&#95;successor to <persName>Moses</persName> &#38; what not.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">No doubt out rushed our worthy friend</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p><persName>J. J. J.</persName> to congratulate <persName>Dr E.</persName>  Hold says<lb/> the Dr. I have not committed myself.  <persName>Mr<lb/> Jones<add>&#63;</add></persName> must have misunderstood me I said<lb/> no more to him than I did to you&#44; which<lb/> was truly noncommittal.  Here was a<lb/> shaking of dry bones&#8212;a tempest in a<lb/> teapot&#8212;<persName>Dr E.</persName> leaves for <placeName>N. O.</placeName> &#38; our committee<lb/> perfectly furious determine to hold another<lb/> election forthwith &#38; elect you &#38; again<lb/> I am questioned&#8212;but I say I am doubt&#45;<lb/>ful now whether you will accept under<lb/> these circumstances.  The matter rests<lb/> thus till <persName>D. E.</persName> returns &#38; formally accepts<lb/> the office here on account of the enlarged<lb/> field presented by the congregation here over<lb/> that of <placeName>N. O.</placeName> &#38;c &#38;c.</p>
				<p>I scarcely think this affair needs a<lb/> comment &#38; I hope you will laugh over<lb/> it as much as I did &#38; do whenever<lb/> I think of it.  Each of us can form<lb/> a fair estimate of the motives influencing<lb/> all parties concerned in the transaction<lb/> &#38; I venture to say that <persName>Dr E.</persName> will prove<lb/> a treasure to the congregation over the<lb/> left</p>

				<p>It is getting near nine <sic>oclock</sic> &#38; as he is at<lb/> home alone I must doze shortly.  It was too<lb/> damp for her to come out tonight as it is<lb/> rainy&#8212;<persName>Jerry<add>&#63;</add></persName> &#38; <persName>Baptiste</persName> are at work.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I have little of interest to communicate as<lb/> regards myself&#8212;my health is good &#38; business<lb/> about as usual.  I am getting anxious to<lb/> see the result of my years work&#8212;which<lb/> I shall know in the course of two or three<lb/> weeks<add>&#63;</add>.  <persName>H&#39;s</persName> health is pretty fair<lb/> &#38; <persName>Mrs cozens</persName> need not be alarmed about<lb/> her.  She is overcareful of herself &#38; will not<lb/> run the slightest risk by exposing herself.  I<lb/> hope that by next summer she will be stout<lb/> &#38; hearty &#38; that there will be no necessity to<lb/> inquire <hi rend="underline">how she is</hi>.
