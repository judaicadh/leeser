            <pb n="1"/>
            <p>There is however a good underplot that few<lb/> know, but which I can unfold.</p>
            <p>Let me premise that <hi rend="underline">all parties</hi> here—our friend<lb/>
                <del><persName>Dr Eckman</persName></del>
                <persName>J. J. Jones</persName> amongst the rest were anxious<lb/> to have
                    <persName>Dr Eckman</persName> elected here. The question<lb/> was, will
                    <persName>Dr E.</persName> accept—which was doubtful<lb/> as the Dr was on his
                way to <placeName>N. O.</placeName> with a view<lb/> for election there—in fact he
                was “up for<lb/>
                <sic>cowes</sic> &amp; a market—Well <hi rend="underline">they</hi> (I think<lb/>
                our worthy friend <persName>J. J. J</persName>.), persuaded <persName>Dr
                    E.</persName> to stop in<lb/>
                <placeName>Mobile</placeName> &amp; examine things before going to <placeName>N.
                    O.</placeName>—<lb/> He did so—remained some days, including a<lb/>
                <date>Sabbath</date>, preached to the congregation, had all the<lb/> advantages
                graphically described by <persName>Israel I.</persName> to him<lb/> of
                    <placeName>Mobile</placeName> as a locale for a congregation &amp;c &amp;c.
                &amp; was<lb/> then permitted to go to <placeName>N. O.</placeName>—After
                spending<lb/> some days in <placeName>N. O.</placeName> preaching there I believe,
                    <persName>Dr E.</persName><lb/> returned to <placeName>Mobile</placeName>—Now
                comes the fun—<hi rend="underline">They</hi><lb/> (<persName>J. J. J</persName>
                believe) commenced <add>?</add>
                <persName>Dr E.</persName> as they did<lb/> not wish to elect him &amp; then have
                him decline<lb/> the election whilst <persName>Dr E.</persName> fought shy &amp;
                would<lb/> not commit himself either way. A few days<lb/> before the election here
                took place “<hi rend="underline">Sixteen</hi><lb/> numbers of the <placeName>N.
                    O.</placeName> congregation met &amp; elected<lb/>
                <persName>Dr E.</persName> for one year at $1800. The <placeName>Mobile</placeName>
                election<lb/> was close at hand &amp; every means was tried to get<lb/> the Dr to
                say <hi rend="underline">aye</hi> or <hi rend="underline">no</hi> that he would
                serve<lb/> here if elected—he refused to do so—the electoral<lb/> committee were in
                a stew—they had no candidate</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>to present for election (<persName>Dr E.</persName> had not yet replied<lb/> to the
                    <placeName>N. O.</placeName> election) at a private caucus it<lb/> seems that
                    <persName>Dave Solomons</persName> suggested to elect <hi rend="underline"
                    >you</hi><lb/> to the office in place of <persName>Dr E.</persName> but would
                you<lb/> accept? To ascertain this <persName>Jones</persName> trotted off<lb/> to
                me—I told him I would use my influence<lb/> towards it &amp; if the salary was not
                large enough<lb/> the <persName>Wolff</persName> family would contribute $100. pr
                annum<lb/> towards enlarging the salary—this was midday<lb/> of the evening for
                    election—<persName>Jones</persName> bothered me<lb/> to say positively whether
                you would accept or not<lb/> &amp; I finally told him I thought you would
                although<lb/> I knew to the contrary—with this assurance he was<lb/> forced to be
                content &amp; then went &amp; told <persName>D. E.</persName> that<lb/> if he did
                not say <hi rend="underline">positively</hi> that he would accept<lb/> if elected
