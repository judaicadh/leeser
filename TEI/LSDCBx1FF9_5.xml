			<p><addressee>Rev Isaac Leeser</addressee></p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">Dear Sir</p>
          <p rend="indent(2)">I received with great pleasure your letter<lb/> of the <date>25th Novr</date> and can assure you that I esteemed<lb/> it an honor to receive a communication from one so well known by<lb/> his literary reputation both in <placeName>America</placeName> &#38; <placeName>England</placeName></p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I can assure you that my business during the<lb/> months of <date>December</date> &#38; <date>January</date> occupies so much of my time<lb/> that I am precluded from attending to any private mat<lb/>ters&#44; and the letter which I received from my brother in<lb/> <placeName><sic>Cincinatti</sic></placeName> by the mail which brought me your favor<lb/> was only answered last week. This explanation will I<lb/> hope be considered by you satisfactory&#44; and an<lb/> ample apology for not replying to you ere this.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I think it better to have to state openly to you the<lb/> reason why I cannot undertake to <sic>percure</sic> subscribers<lb/> for your Bible&#44; than to lead you to believe that I am<lb/> either unwilling or too lazy to attempt to do so. You<lb/> are aware that <persName>Dr. Berusch</persName> who is in intimate terms<lb/> with me announced some time ago his intention<lb/> of publishing a translation of the Bible&#44; and when it<lb/> was intended to form a committee for the purpose of<lb/> aiding him pecuniarily in the task I acted as the<lb/> Honorary Secretary of the same. That plan being abandon<lb/>ed &#38; the doctor undertaking the task in his own respon&#45;<lb/>sibility I lent him my assistance in procuring subscribers<lb/> and the first part of the work viz the Pentateuch is already<lb/> in the hands of 600<add>&#63;</add> subscribers I need not tell you<lb/> that a person on the spot has a great advantage over<lb/> one living at a distance. <persName>D. B</persName> has announced his inten</p>
		<pb n="2"/>
			<p>intention of continuing the work and I may add that<lb/> the same is <add>&#63;</add> at this <add>&#63;</add> by the permission<lb/> of the marrying committee&#44; <persName>Dr. Berusch</persName> having been for<lb/> many years connected with the society. As Secretary<lb/> of the Institution &#38; as a friend of the doctor&#44; and<lb/> having already interested myself for the success of<lb/> the work&#44; you will perceive that it would not<lb/> be possible for me to canvass for subscribers to your<lb/> Bible&#44; and if I were to do so&#44; you must be aware<lb/> that the English Jews would give the preference<lb/> to a work published here&#44; as doubtless the Americans<lb/> would do &#38; have done to one printed in the<lb/> <placeName>United States</placeName>. I do not consider that <persName>Mrs. <add>&#63;</add></persName><lb/> makes a good agent for the Occident my brother<lb/> writes that you informed him that <persName>Mr Franklin</persName><lb/> had led you to expect great assistance from him<lb/> in the circulation of the work&#44; but I may say<lb/> that as he was unable to make his own paper<lb/> succeed it ought not to surprise you that he<lb/> was unable <del>or perhaps</del> to procure a <add>&#63;</add> favorable<lb/> reception for another editors work. I will endeavour<lb/> to procure you some subscribers for the occident<lb/> but the Jews here do not like subscribing to<lb/> foreign Journals and when the L&#39;Ouivers<add>&#63;</add> was<lb/> first published I could only procure for him<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> 2 subscribers &#38; he has only 6 in <placeName>London</placeName>.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">Yours however being written in our native tongue<lb/> ought to meet with a better reception&#44; but as<lb/> the Jews subscribe to the Jewish Chronicle which<lb/> they like &#40;at least many of them&#44;&#41; altho there are<lb/> many opinions on the merit of the paper as a<lb/> literary organ&#44; they are not eager to subscribe</p>
		<pb n="3"/>
			<p>for another. I must express my surprise that in the<lb/> <placeName>United States</placeName> occupied by so many Jews you can<lb/> not find supporters enough&#44; for the &#34;Chronicle is<lb/> supported here altho many are very dissatisfied<lb/> with it.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I cannot say who was the person who corres&#45;<lb/>ponded for your paper under the signature of <persName>O</persName>.<lb/> I have been often asked whether I was the<lb/> writer &#38; can assure you that I was not.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">To reply to your request that I should write a<lb/> monthly letter for your Journal in the state of<lb/> Jewish affairs in <placeName>England</placeName>&#44; I will undertake<lb/> the task with pleasure if you think I can be<lb/> of any service to you. I should wish to remain<lb/> incrg&#8212;for I do not like as I am holding public<lb/> offices to write under my name as I might feel<lb/> my opinions <sic>obacstled</sic> if therefore you wish<lb/> me to do as you have requested a letter in reply<lb/> to this shall have in return my first letter to<lb/> the occident which I will sign <add>Hebrew</add> that being<lb/> my name in hebrew.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">Should you ever intend paying us a visit <del>in<lb/>this&#44;</del> thinking that a personal interview with our<lb/> co&#45;religionists in this city&#44; would lend to give a<lb/> larger circulation to your periodical I shall be<lb/> most happy to see you &#38; render you every assistance<lb/> in my power</p>
          <p rend="indent(9)">I am</p>
          <p rend="indent(10)">Dear Sir</p>
          <p rend="indent(11)">yours Truly</p>
