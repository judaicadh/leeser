            <p>To my friend&#44; etc.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Your kind letter reached me. I shall<lb/> answer it in order. Firstly&#44; I could
                not grow<lb/> very wise from reading your letters&#44; since our<lb/> correspondence
                is rather meager. That is why<lb/> your manner of writing is rather strange to
                me.<lb/> In so far&#44; however&#44; as I could understand it&#44;<lb/> it informs
                me that under no circumstances<lb/> could I get credit from you. But I never<lb/>
                wrote to you asking for credit. I possess enough<lb/> wisdom and good manners not to
                ask for new<lb/> goods when I still owe you &#36;16 which&#44; upon<lb/> my
                honor&#44; I have not yet received&#44; and<lb/> which I hope honestly to pay back
                to you next<lb/> October. I simply wrote to you that I am<lb/> well&#8211;acquainted
                with <persName>Goldsmith</persName>&#44; who trusts<lb/> me with everything I ask
                for. I spoke to him<lb/> and told him that <persName>Ottinger</persName> sells the
                pen&#8211;<lb/>tateuchs and prayer books at a very low<lb/> price and asked whether
                it would be<lb/>
            </p>

            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>possible for me to sell it at the same price.<lb/>
                <persName>Goldsmith</persName> told me to write to you and<lb/> that if you should
                write to him to give me the<lb/> prayer books at a lower price&#44; then I<lb/>
                could have it&#44; since he did not buy<lb/> the books for himself but only on
                a<lb/> commission basis. I have not&#44; however&#44;<lb/> and will not ask for
                credit&#44; because<lb/> I can get whatever I need from<lb/>
                <persName>Goldsmith</persName> whatever I take&#44;
                <persName>Goldsmith</persName><lb/> will put down as sold&#44; and be
                re&#8211;<lb/>sponsible for it himself&#44; for this<lb/> reason I wrote to you that
                I<lb/> deal entirely through <persName>Goldsmith</persName><lb/> Believe me&#44;
                I&#44; too&#44; do business<lb/> carefully and don&#39;t give any<lb/> credit&#44;
                or I must be quite certain.<lb/> I have lost much money through easy<lb/>
                trustfulness.</p>

            <pb n="3"/>
            <p rend="indent(1)">In view of the fact that you can<lb/> send me the unbound pentateuchs&#44;<lb/> that
                is the larger size&#44; at the lower<lb/> price&#44; you may send me five
                sets&#44;<lb/> and charge it to <persName>Goldsmith</persName>. Or<lb/> wait with
                the shipment until I send<lb/> you the money for it. I happen to say<lb/> to
                    <persName>Goldsmith</persName> last Sunday that I knew<lb/> I owed you some
                money and that you<lb/> were the last one I should want to<lb/> treat badly. I know
                you have another<lb/> claim for &#36;10 against me which I<lb/> hope&#44; with
                God&#39;s help&#44; to return to you&#44;<lb/> Gross bill I shall repay as soon as
                I<lb/> receive the money. Send me some circu&#8211;<lb/>lars. I will distribute them
                through<lb/> several travellers who travel about<lb/> with the Shema Yisrael
                &#40;the foregoing is<lb/> confusing. I am not sure of his meaning&#41; s.g.</p>

            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>I shall try my best&#44; but you must<lb/> advertise that subscribers are to
                turn<lb/> to me. How would it be for me to<lb/> send someone throughout this city
                to<lb/> look for subscribers&#63; Think the<lb/> matter over&#44; for I have a
                large<lb/> acquaintanceship among gentiles.<lb/> Write to me your answer soon.
                I<lb/> remain&#44; your friend&#44; ready to<lb/> serve you&#44;<lb/>
