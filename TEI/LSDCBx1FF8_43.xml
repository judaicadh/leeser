          <p rend="indent(4)">Most Esteemed Friend</p>
          <p rend="indent(7)">I have read attentively your statement and<lb/> communication to me of the <date>24th Iyar</date> from which as well as from the course of our<lb/> correspondence I have drawn in full and can well make out the character of such individu<lb/>&#61;als <add>Hebrew</add> <persName>Brother Leeser</persName>&#33; <add>Hebrew</add> in the course of our correspondence you had<lb/> occasion to remind me of the saying <add>Hebrew</add> on my reflecting thereon it struck<lb/> me rather strange that such has been the case throughout the proceedings for in that<lb/> <hi rend="underline">true</hi> <persName>Lady Clarissa</persName> &#40;whom I have never seen since&#41; of course you are well acquainted with<lb/> her <add>Hebrew</add> Father&#44; Brothers&#44; brother in law &#38;c Butchers <add>Hebrew</add> and for her having<lb/> <del>having</del> taken such interest and under handed work for a certain party she surely<lb/> must have had a scent <add>Hebrew</add> that he is as well as herself <add>Hebrew</add> in the same way by father&#44;<lb/> grand father&#44; great grand father &#38;c although butchers in this country are closer to the<lb/> mark of <hi rend="underline">imitating</hi> a gentleman&#39;s business&#44; by their having a Desk to write upon&#44; cheque<lb/> book&#44; banker&#44; and after business hour attending at meetings with a fine coat &#40;of course<lb/> at that moment divested from the <hi rend="underline">blue apron</hi>&#41; which is not the case in <placeName>Leghorn</placeName> they are<lb/> literally <add>Hebrew</add> and in no better sphere than the common drover&#44; here&#59;<lb/> consequently this may in part answer the conduct of his behaviour towards yourself &#38;<lb/> myself&#44; for you know well <add>Hebrew</add> when I say myself I mean to say<lb/> that near his departure or during the treatise of the affair he approached me closer<lb/> than he ever did for 4 years he was here&#44; appearing friendly&#44; and open&#39;d his mind to me<lb/> of course as his countryman &#38; superior&#44; &#40;but I held all this with suspicion&#41; nevertheless he<lb/> had the most kind behaviour &#38; hospitality from one and all at my house&#59; such has<lb/> been the <hi rend="underline">amiable</hi> &#38; <hi rend="underline">modest</hi> Divine that he has never had the politeness I shall not<lb/> say write me a letter&#44; but compt. to me&#44; or my family&#44; and I was the only one who accompanied<lb/> him 7 miles to see him off by the Train&#59; I can only attribute such behavior chiefly to the<lb/> above reason&#44; and than as I took no hints of what he was coming so friendly after me&#44; and<lb/> what he wished&#44; he expected that I should have shelter&#39;d him under one of the great men that<lb/> <placeName>Leghorn</placeName> had <hi rend="underline">once upon a time</hi> the poor <add>Hebrew</add> <sic>beginer</sic> of the present day&#44; was quite mistaken&#44;<lb/> I know him well also his full weight&#44; the first rudiments of the Bible <add>Hebrew</add> grammar a little<lb/> it is &#38; <add>&#63;</add> with the learned Lecturer. I could not allow him in our official certificate<lb/> but the truth and that only&#44; as far as his competency as Hazan. With regard to <persName>E</persName>&#58; <persName>H</persName>&#58; <persName>L</persName>&#58;<lb/> you could easily perceive the truth of the <hi rend="underline">amiable</hi>&#44; the other Two <sic>naturaly</sic> falls&#59; <hi rend="underline">modest</hi> to be to the contrary<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> <hi rend="underline">learned</hi>&#44; <del>after</del> a learned man will easily find that out&#44; what can such a judge<lb/> signify&#44; who knows not the least in our literature <add>Hebrew</add> he cannot translate one verse</p>

			<p>from the Hebrew&#44; the little information he has picked up in from the numerous<lb/> <sic>spanish</sic> books we have a religious points as you well know&#44; Cuzaris&#44; Conciliator&#44;<lb/> Hobat a Cebabot &#38;c &#38;c &#38;c but chiefly on this subject one maxim will answer you all and<lb/> any difficulty you may have&#44; <hi rend="underline">much</hi> is done now <add>Hebrew</add> I believe he has not written any<lb/> more than the first letters to his friends <add>Hebrew</add> otherwise we should have had Bushels of<lb/> <hi rend="underline">puffing</hi> in the chronicle of the <hi rend="underline">miracles</hi>&#44; wonders&#44; performed by him.&#8212;I shall in my<lb/> next write to you the cause of all such <add>Hebrew</add> we have some here among us <sic>equaly</sic> to<lb/> yours&#8212;I hereby send you a copy of the letter sent by me to <persName>Mr. <hi rend="underline">Hart</hi></persName><lb/> let me know your opinion about it&#44; let me beg of you to keep it in confidence not to<lb/> make any public use of it&#44; you are at liberty to show it to any friend. Without<lb/> the least flattery I assure you I never read any thing more powerful&#44; striking to the<lb/> feelings&#44; <hi rend="underline">mainly</hi>&#44; than your Introduction &#38; your reply to the address&#44; in the occident<lb/> <date>April</date> last&#8212;you drew tears from my eyes as I was in full possession of all passed.<lb/> I shall be most happy to hear from you in hopes you are doing well&#44; and have the<lb/> laugh over them <add>Hebrew</add> and hope many will have their eyes open to see it&#44; you will<lb/> candidly let me know if this is the case which I expect it to be <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> wishing you heartily every prosperity&#44; ready at your commands.
