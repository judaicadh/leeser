				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>St Thomas</placeName> <date>16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> August 1846</date></p>
				<p>Revd Sir.&#8212;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I know the deep sympathy and interest<lb/> which you feel in all that concerns your coreligionists<lb/> wherever they may be found&#44; I therefore without apology<lb/> take the liberty of occupying your attention with some<lb/> remarks on a subject that ought to engage the attention<lb/> of every friend to the Faith&#59; I know not what your<lb/> views may be with respect to the various Innovations<lb/> which tender the title of &#8220;Reform&#8221; are finding their way<lb/> into the Ritual and Ceremonies of the Jews of the present<lb/> day&#59; but I think I know sufficient<del>ly</del> of you&#44; in order to<lb/> be assured that whatever your opinions may be&#44; you will<lb/> not object to hear and to give publicity in your valuable<lb/> periodical &#40;the Occident&#41; to the opinions of others however<lb/> they may differ from yours.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">It may be necessary to premise that the Indivi&#61;<lb/>&#61;dual who now addresses you thinks that the form of the<lb/> religious worship of the Jews may be favorably amended&#44;<lb/> some of their customs may without injury or impropriety<lb/> be dispensed with&#59; but he must confess himself not<lb/> sufficiently learned to point at any particular one&#44;<lb/> and to say so with <hi rend="underline">certainty</hi>&#59; therefore for himself&#44; tho&#39; a<lb/> reformer&#44; he would rather yield allegiance to long<lb/> established customs than indiscreetly to have them chang&#39;d&#59;<lb/> but another more powerful reason which induces him<lb/> to object to the innovations alluded to is that they are<lb/> not the result of combined and general understanding<lb/> by the Jews throughout the World&#58; Individuals&#44; who<lb/> claim to be the descendants of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; who believe in the<lb/> revelations of the Old Testament and look for the<lb/> <sic>fulfilment</sic> of the promises declared thereby should consider<lb/> that an obligation rests upon them of a different character</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>to that which belongs to mere religious Sectarians&#59; on<lb/> them devolves the duty of seeking for the national<lb/> regeneration of the house of <persName>Jacob</persName>&#44; and by every means<lb/> should they endeavor to hasten the approach of the gathering<lb/> in of the faithful&#59; will they do so by destroying their<lb/> individuality or by object and servile imitations of the<lb/> customs of the Gentiles&#44; who on their part have on induce&#45;<lb/>ment&#44; no object in preserving that unity&#44; which whilst<lb/> it gives strength&#44; vigor and consistency to the worship is at<lb/> the same time a type of the object of the adoration and hope<lb/> of the Jew&#59; <hi rend="underline">One only true and all powerful God</hi>&#63;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">If our forms be defective&#44; our ceremonies not congenial<lb/> to the spirit of the times&#44; in Heaven&#39;s name let them be<lb/> changed&#59; but let the change be the result of some combin&#39;d<lb/> purpose&#44; let it be based upon the united wisdom of<lb/> competent persons selected by the parties interested&#59; I am<lb/> for change&#44; but for such a change as will not destroy the<lb/> unity&#44; the individuality and harmony of a people who<lb/> claim to the chosen of God&#58; I am led to these<lb/> reflections Mr Editor by having witnessed a ceremony<lb/> performed in the Synagogue of this <placeName>Island</placeName> under the<lb/> title of &#8220;Confirmation&#8221;&#59; what the Hebrew term is I do<lb/> not know&#44; nor do I think there is any&#44; invented as yet&#44;<lb/> for I believe the origin of this grave ceremony does not go<lb/> <hi rend="underline">quite so</hi> far back as when the Hebrew Language was the<lb/> Vernacular of the Jews&#59; but perhaps when I describe it<lb/> your learning may devise some Hebrew word applicable<lb/> to it&#59; and really I wish you would&#44; for the term<lb/> Confirmation reminds one too forcibly of the &#8220;laying on<lb/> of hands&#8221; of the &#8220;Lord&#39;s spiritual&#8221; the &#8220;Vice Gerents of their<lb/> Lord and Master <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>&#59;&#8221; In order to be appreciated<lb/> by a Jewish congregation I will briefly describe the<lb/> ceremony as it was &#8220;enacted&#8221; here.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The confirmant&#233; having undergone a course of<lb/> instruction and preparation and being perfect in their<lb/> parts&#44; a procession composed of the confirmants &#40;the</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>girls dressed in white with white veils covering their heads<lb/> and faces&#44; the Boys in their holiday suits&#41; walking in<lb/> pairs and succeeded by the Reader of the congregation<lb/> dressed in his Robes&#44; proceeded from the residence of the<lb/> Reader to the Synagogue&#44; arriving there the Service of the<lb/> Evening &#40;eve of <date>Shebungot</date>&#41; was commenced&#44; at the<lb/> appropriate time the Reader ascended the pulpit and<lb/> delivered a discourse in English&#44; the confirmants and<lb/> their parents were then placed around the front of the<lb/> Ark in two Ranks&#44; the former in front and the latter in<lb/> the rear&#44; the Reader taking his stand on the platform<lb/> of the ark&#44; then interrogated the confirmants on the Decalogue<lb/> and the thirteen articles of Faith alternately in Hebrew<lb/> and in English&#44; the responses being all correctly made in<lb/> accordance with an established formula&#59; the ark was<lb/> opened and three Scrolls of the Law were taken out and<lb/> held by the dignitaries of the congregation&#44; the confirmants<lb/> then approached and placed their hands upon the Scrolls<lb/> they repeated a solemn pledge and promise that they &#40;the<lb/> confirmants&#41; will always believe in what they have<lb/> learned and repeated&#59; and will never change their Religion&#44;<lb/> &#40;or words to that effect&#41; the confirmants <sic>ascented</sic> thereto&#44;<lb/> and the Parents then laid their hands on the heads of the<lb/> confirmants and a blessing was invoked by the Reader&#59;<lb/> after this an exhortation was delivered and the service was<lb/> concluded.  Now Sir&#33;  I ask&#44; and would respectfully<lb/> ask you to answer&#44; has such a ceremony ever been performed<lb/> in any Synagogue of Jews previous to the establishment<lb/> of what are termed &#8220;reformed congregations&#8221; in <placeName>Europe</placeName>&#63;<lb/>  is it to be found in the formula of Jewish worship<lb/> ordained by Rabbinical authority since the dispersion&#63;<lb/>  is it to be found in the ceremonial established for the<lb/> Israelites by <persName>Moses</persName>&#63;  if not&#44; then I feel constrained to<lb/> say that it is a presumptuous uncalled for innovation<lb/> without warrant from any acknowledged Jewish<lb/> authority and as such should be discountenanced and</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>rejected.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The creed of the Jews as I have understood it consists in<lb/> the emphatic Declaration &#8220;<hi rend="underline">Hear O <placeName>Israel</placeName> the Lord our <del>thy</del></hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">God is One</hi>&#8221; it begins and it ends with that single<lb/> comprehensible and undisputed Idea.  But in the ceremony<lb/> of confirmation as it was performed here this great Truth<lb/> is joined to what are termed the 13<del>th</del> Articles of Faith&#44; all<lb/> of which the confirmants are made to <del>believe</del> declare they<lb/> &#8220;believe with a firm faith.&#8221; thus by confounding a plain and<lb/> evident truth&#44; designed as the basis of the Jewish faith<lb/> with a collection of questionable deductions drawn from<lb/> the writings of the Prophets and the Sages of the Bible&#59;<lb/> the foundation for discussions&#44; divisions and dispersions<lb/> is laid which is to be feared will lead to the same consequences<lb/> as have resulted to the Christian Church&#59; But independent<lb/> of this&#44; I would ask&#44; Is it either wise or proper to cause<lb/> or even to permit young inexperienced persons to make<lb/> a solemn pledge before God and the world&#44; always to<lb/> <hi rend="underline">believe</hi> what they have been taught and always to <hi rend="underline">act</hi> in<lb/> conformity to that belief&#63;  In my humble opinion it is a<lb/> species of subornation of perjury and the promoter of<lb/> deception&#59; Sir&#33; is a man&#39;s belief under his own control&#63;<lb/>  can he lock up his mind&#63;  can he close his senses to the<lb/> evidences and power of Reason&#63;  the idea of pledging<lb/> oneself to any given <hi rend="underline">belief</hi>&#44; appears to be such a perfect<lb/> absurdity and is so much at variance with what every<lb/> man&#44; a fraction beyond an Idiot in intellect must<lb/> himself have observed of himself&#44; that nothing but the<lb/> quintessence of Bigotry could ever have imagined it&#8212;<lb/> the pledge with respect to action is not quite so absurd&#59;<lb/> but what does it lead to&#63;  A child is pledged to a certain<lb/> religious practice&#44; with the increase of years and experience<lb/> he finds them to be erroneous and of course wishes to<lb/> change them&#59; but he remembers his pledge&#44; what then&#63;<lb/>  Either he continues to do what he <hi rend="underline">believes to be wrong</hi>&#59; or<lb/> he argues upon the nonliability to an engagement into</p>
			<pb n="5"/>
				<p>which he was forced or betrayed&#59; and he forfeits his pledge.<lb/>  If the former&#44; what have not his wise teachers to answer for&#63;<lb/>  if the latter&#44; what is the value of his pledge&#63;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">But Sir let us look upon this subject in another<lb/> point of view free form speculation and founded upon<lb/> facts either having occurred or likely to occur.  The<lb/> Communicant is under his pledge bound to observe the Laws<lb/> of the Decalogue among these is the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> &#8220;Remember to keep<lb/> holy the <date>Sabbath day</date> &#38;c&#8221;&#44; he repeats the imperative command&#44;<lb/> he is told that it comes from God himself&#44; that God in whose<lb/> presence he stands&#44; on whose holy word his hand is placed&#44;<lb/> he then repeats the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> command &#8220;Honor thy father and thy<lb/> mother&#8221;&#44; that father&#39;s hand is on his head&#44; he feels its pressure<lb/> and with it he remembers that that father openly and <sic>wilfully</sic><lb/> infringes the command which he brings him there to<lb/> pledge himself to observe&#33;  the father is a <date>Sabbath</date> breaker&#33;&#33;<lb/>  what a solemn mockery is not this&#33;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Mr Editor&#44; numberless are the reflections which<lb/> press on my mind at this moment&#59; yet I dare not<lb/> impose upon your indulgence in giving vent to them&#44; But<lb/> permit me a few words more&#59; I shall be brief.  This<lb/> <placeName>Island</placeName> you know is one of the Colonies of <placeName>Denmark</placeName>&#59; under<lb/> the benevolent protection of its late and present Sovereigns&#44;<lb/> the Jews here have enjoyed not only a free toleration of<lb/> their religion but their congregation has been endowed<lb/> with special and valuable privileges&#59; they prospered under<lb/> them&#59; their worship was upheld&#59; and notwithstanding the<lb/> regulations under which their coreligionists of <placeName>Denmark</placeName><lb/> were governed&#44; they were free to govern themselves&#59; But the<lb/> spirit of absolutism and Bigotry could not let &#8220;well<lb/> enough&#8221; alone&#44; it must control men&#39;s consciences&#59; there<lb/> was too much freedom of action&#44; too much liberty of thought.<lb/>  In the year <date>1814</date> an ordinance of the <persName>King</persName> had provided<lb/> for the religious education of the Jews in <placeName>Denmark</placeName> and<lb/> in order to enforce it&#44; it was ordained that the children<lb/> at 14 years of age should undergo an examination and</p>
			<pb n="6"/>
				<p>&#8220;depose their Religion&#8221; and make a promise &#8220;never with their<lb/> free will to act contrary to the principles which they<lb/> acknowledged&#8221; under the <hi rend="underline">penalty</hi> of not being permitted<lb/> &#8220;to <hi rend="underline">make oath</hi>&#44; to <hi rend="underline">enter into marriage</hi>&#44; to <hi rend="underline">enter as journeymen</hi><lb/> &#8220;<hi rend="underline">in any corporation</hi>&#44; to be <hi rend="underline">made Burghers in any town</hi>&#44; to<lb/> &#8220;<hi rend="underline">keep any trade</hi>&#44; to <hi rend="underline">enter among the students</hi>&#44; or to <hi rend="underline">be their</hi><lb/> &#8220;<hi rend="underline">own guardians</hi>&#8221; all this was specially provided&#44; for the<lb/> people of the &#8220;Mosaic Communion&#8221; residing or such as<lb/> might hereafter be permitted to reside in <hi rend="underline"><placeName>Denmark</placeName></hi>.&#44; well<lb/> Sir&#33; nothing of this was ever applied or intended for the<lb/> Jews of this place&#44; they enjoyed their civil and religious<lb/> rights to the fullest extent&#59; what think you then of the<lb/> fatuity of the men who could seek to disturb so happy<lb/> a state of things&#63; what think you of the Individuals<lb/> who could apply to the Colonial Government for permission<lb/> to enforce the regulations alluded to upon their coreligionists&#44;<lb/> residents of this <placeName>island</placeName> to enslave their consciences&#33;  to make the <del>employment</del> enjoyment<lb/> of their civil rights dependent upon a pledge to shackle<lb/> the freedom of thought and of religious conviction&#33;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Can it be that these men are the descendants of the<lb/> people who for ages have endured persecutions and obloquy<lb/> without surrendering an Iota of their right to worship<lb/> God after the dictates of their own Hearts&#63;  They are so&#44;<lb/> they are Jews who have done this deed&#44; strange<lb/> inconsistency&#33;  the persecuted whilst yet groaning<lb/> under the effects of persecution seek themselves to be<lb/> <sic>persecuters</sic>&#33;&#33; but Sir they say their intention is<lb/> good&#44; they fear that without some restraint of this<lb/> kind the Jewish religion will be lost&#44; that there have<lb/> been a few <sic>seceders</sic> and there might be more&#8212;and is<lb/> it so&#63; is the Jewish religion so weak a fabric as to<lb/> be held together with chains and cords&#63; is its foundation<lb/> gone&#63; has the Glory departed from <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#63;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">These men add insult to injury&#59; Sir you are<lb/> one of the watchmen on the outer tower&#59; to you I<lb/> appeal for a warning&#44; tell these men that in seeking</p>
			<pb n="7"/>
				<p>to uphold that they destroy&#59; tell them that the Great <add>&#63;</add><lb/> of the Universe has given to man free will to choose<lb/> between good and evil&#44; let them not pretend to be<lb/> wiser than their Creator.</p>

				<p><hi rend="underline">Note By the Editor</hi>.  Our valued correspondent&#44; whom we have known and esteemed<lb/> for a number of years&#44; wields a stray pen&#59; and though we think that he <add>&#63;</add><lb/> highly on all generous minds do when an object of interest is presented to them<lb/> still in the <sic>believe</sic> that there is a great cause for serious thought upon<lb/> the subjects embraced in his communication.  Our friend could not have been aware<lb/> when speaking of the ceremony of confirmation that we had noticed it already in<lb/> an <date>August</date> number&#44; from information derived from three various sources<lb/> who all approved of the new institution&#44; whilst we appended upon remarks<lb/> qualifying our assent to the institution thereof we said&#58; &#8220;Though so much is<lb/> told of this child of modern days&#44; we are for our part not yet satisfied of<lb/> its usefulness and though not opposed to its being resorted to&#44; however<lb/> might except to some of the details&#44; we have not yet seen enough to satisfy<lb/> our own judgment of the propriety of its introduction.&#8221;  It will thus be seen<lb/> that we do not assent to the necessity&#44; and consequently to the propriety of<lb/> holding a public religious institution&#44; as has been recommended by some of<lb/> our correspondents in common with many others&#44; for readers need not be sur&#45;<lb/>prised that we allow others to advocate in our pages what we do not think<lb/> either useful or necessary&#59; we have always endeavoured to invite free discussion&#44;<lb/> not the least doubting that we too may obtain thereby convictions not otherwise attain&#45;<lb/>able.  Truth can only gain by discussion&#59; error alone must be crouched<lb/> in darkness for fear of exposure.  So with the confirmation&#44; we permitted its<lb/> advocacy&#44; and will now let others if they think proper discuss it according to<lb/> its merits as then on one or the other side.  We for our fact&#44; deem it a<lb/> harmless thing&#59; but still an innovation upon our ancient customs&#59;<lb/> Just in former days knew nothing of it&#59; it is borrowed from the protestants<lb/> in <placeName>Germany</placeName>&#44; if we mistake not&#44; and is akin to the first communion among<lb/> the catholics&#44; for which the children are prefaced by a long course of study&#44;<lb/> so that they may be able to be cleverly catochind<add>&#63;</add> by the examining clergy<lb/> men when the to them important day arrives for their expression<add>&#63;</add> to<lb/> the <hi rend="underline">grace</hi> of the church.  Christians as our readers know&#44; think the <add>&#63;</add><lb/>king of the bread and wine of the communion of the highest importance</p>
