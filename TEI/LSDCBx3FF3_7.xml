            <p>â€œ<persName>ISAAC LEESER</persName> WAS NO ORDINARY MAN. FEW OF HIS
                CONTEMPORARIES<lb/> had less advantages of education of education or influential
                surroundings.<lb/> Poor in purse, <sic>umknown</sic>, a stranger in a strange land,
                the<lb/> language to be learned, friends to win, and inf <sic>uence</sic> to<lb/>
                make, he commenced his career. Fortunately nature had<lb/> gifted him with
                extraordinary powers of language, and what<lb/> he lacked of scholarship was more
                than <sic>mae</sic> up by a<lb/> broad, deep, <sic>fervant</sic> energy to do, and
                perseverance to<lb/> accomplish. He came to the <placeName>United States</placeName>
                when an Israelite<lb/> was an anomaly, when his religion was condemned, his
                habits<lb/> derided, his motives misjudged , and his actions ever held<lb/> up to
                the <sic>oublic</sic> gaze for derision. Forty years ago, when<lb/>
                <persName>Leeser</persName> commenced his labors, our people were like the
                    <placeName>State</placeName><lb/> few. Influence they had none. Men of mind were
                not; and<lb/> the public press was <sic>asunsparing</sic> in their criticism as
                the<lb/> cause was uncalled for.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">At a time when an American Jewish paper or periodical<lb/> was
                unknown; when the Jewish merchant princes of <placeName>New York</placeName><lb/>
                and other cities were yet wending their way over their<lb/> native hills, trying to
                earn a livelihood; when no pala-<lb/>tial mansions or places of business gave
                evidence of Jewish<lb/> prosperity; when Jewish orphan asylums and hospitals
                were<lb/> embedded in their native <sic>quariies</sic>; when the order of en<lb/>
                Berith had not ripened into a plan of charity; when, in<lb/> short, our
                    <sic>peoplewere</sic> a mere cipher publicly and socially,<lb/>
                <persName>Isaac Leeser</persName> commenced his labors for the cause of Judaism<lb/>
                and true humanity.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">What a crying shame it XX is that his labors were<lb/> not duly
                appreciated as they should have <sic>beeb</sic>; that his<lb/> motives and actions
                were often dragged into the arena of<lb/> personalities; that he was in truth
                tortured to death.<lb/>
                <persName>Isaac Leeser</persName> was only sixty-two years of age, and might<lb/>
                have lived full twenty years, had not his life been em-<lb/>bittered by attacks from
                unthinking, ungrateful, and often<lb/> malicious contemporaries. His was a very
                sensitive nature.<lb/> Knowing the integrity of his conduct, the sincerity of<lb/>
                his motives, every aspersion caused a wound, until at last,<lb/> he died a martyr,
                and no <del>?</del> warrior clad in mail ever<lb/> battled more heroically for his
                lady fair, no king or<lb/>
                <sic>empereor</sic> ever defended his throne more manfully, no painter<lb/> ever
                depicted on canvas more glowingly, no poet ever sang<lb/> more
                    <sic>inspiringly</sic> that <persName>Isaac Leeser</persName> battled for his
                people<lb/> and defended his principles, depicted in word-painting the<lb/> glory of
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName> and <placeName>Israel's</placeName> God, or sang
                more hallelujahs a<lb/> songs of praise for the progress and regeneration of
                his<lb/> people.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">And here we have the perfect example of the ingrati<lb/>tude of the
                masses toward their real benefactors.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">And as of nations, so of individuals, <persName>Mr Leeser</persName>
                knew<lb/> that our only hope lies in education.</p>
