				<p>&#8220;<persName>ISAAC LEESER</persName> WAS NO ORDINARY MAN. FEW OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES<lb/> had less advantages of education of education or influential surroundings.<lb/> Poor in purse&#44; <sic>umknown</sic>&#44; a stranger in a strange land&#44; the<lb/> language to be learned&#44; friends to win&#44; and inf <sic>uence</sic> to<lb/> make&#44; he commenced his career. Fortunately nature had<lb/> gifted him with extraordinary powers of language&#44; and what<lb/> he lacked of scholarship was more than <sic>mae</sic> up by a<lb/> broad&#44; deep&#44; <sic>fervant</sic> energy to do&#44; and perseverance to<lb/> accomplish. He came to the <placeName>United States</placeName> when an Israelite<lb/> was an anomaly&#44; when his religion was condemned&#44; his habits<lb/> derided&#44; his motives misjudged &#44; and his actions ever held<lb/> up to the <sic>oublic</sic> gaze for derision. Forty years ago&#44; when<lb/> <persName>Leeser</persName> commenced his labors&#44; our people were like the <placeName>State</placeName><lb/> few. Influence they had none. Men of mind were not&#59; and<lb/> the public press was <sic>asunsparing</sic> in their criticism as the<lb/> cause was uncalled for.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">At a time when an American Jewish paper or periodical<lb/> was unknown&#59; when the Jewish merchant princes of <placeName>New York</placeName><lb/> and other cities were yet wending their way over their<lb/> native hills&#44; trying to earn a livelihood&#59; when no pala&#45;<lb/>tial mansions or places of business gave evidence of Jewish<lb/> prosperity&#59; when Jewish orphan asylums and hospitals were<lb/> embedded in their native <sic>quariies</sic>&#59; when the order of en<lb/> Berith had not ripened into a plan of charity&#59; when&#44; in<lb/> short&#44; our <sic>peoplewere</sic> a mere cipher publicly and socially&#44;<lb/> <persName>Isaac Leeser</persName> commenced his labors for the cause of Judaism<lb/> and true humanity.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">What a crying shame it  XX is that his labors were<lb/> not duly appreciated as they should have <sic>beeb</sic>&#59; that his<lb/> motives and actions were often dragged into the arena of<lb/> personalities&#59; that he was in truth tortured to death.<lb/> <persName>Isaac Leeser</persName> was only sixty&#45;two years of age&#44; and might<lb/> have lived full twenty years&#44; had not his life been em&#45;<lb/>bittered by attacks from unthinking&#44; ungrateful&#44; and often<lb/> malicious contemporaries. His was a very sensitive nature.<lb/> Knowing the integrity of his conduct&#44; the sincerity of<lb/> his motives&#44; every aspersion caused a wound&#44; until at last&#44;<lb/> he died a martyr&#44; and no <del>&#63;</del> warrior clad in mail ever<lb/> battled more heroically for his lady fair&#44; no king or<lb/> <sic>empereor</sic> ever defended his throne more manfully&#44; no painter<lb/> ever depicted on canvas more glowingly&#44; no poet ever sang<lb/> more <sic>inspiringly</sic> that <persName>Isaac Leeser</persName>  battled for his people<lb/> and defended his principles&#44; depicted in word&#45;painting the<lb/> glory of <placeName>Israel</placeName> and <placeName>Israel&#39;s</placeName> God&#44; or sang more hallelujahs a<lb/> songs of praise for the progress and regeneration of his<lb/> people.</p>  
			<p rend="indent(1)">And here we have the perfect example of the ingrati<lb/>tude of the masses toward their real benefactors.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">And as of nations&#44; so of individuals&#44; <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> knew<lb/> that our only hope lies in education.</p>
