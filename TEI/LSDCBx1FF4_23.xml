                                        to come, amen. As regards my dear children,<lb/> in the
                                        matter of their studies, everything seems to be going
                                        well.<lb/> And they are, thank God, all as fresh and happy
                                        as fish in water. My<lb/> oldest daughter,

                                        could see my <persName>Uncle Itsik</persName><lb/> again(?).
                                                  <sic>with</sic> regard to business, however,
                                        everything here is very<lb/> bad. Everything is fine but the
                                        cost of living is high. This affects<lb/> business badly,
                                        and whoever has a small sum goes to
                                                  <placeName>America</placeName>.
                                        Unfortunate-<lb/>ly, I had a partner who cheated me very
                                        badly. I lost a thousand thalers<lb/> through him, and, in
                                        addition to that, I had to stand for a bankruptcy<lb/> in
                                                  <placeName>BREHM</placeName>, to the extent of 500
                                        thalers. Thus my business affairs are<lb/> in poor condition
                                        to earn a living for my dear wife and children. I<lb/> must
                                        nowadays keep busy and earn little. That is why I take the
                                        liber-<lb/>ty to ask you whether you could not spare $200 or
                                        $300 which I shall<lb/> repay you in 3 years, or, should it
                                        be the case that an inheritance<lb/> from our uncle, may he
                                        rest in peace, or from our aunt, be forthcoming<lb/> to us,
                                        you can retain it. I do not want to make you lose a
                                        penny,<lb/> God forbid, I do this simply to be able to
                                        support my dear wife and all<lb/> children in honor. If you
                                        cannot or do not want to, then please,<lb/> when you write,
                                        say nothing about this to <persName>Leah</persName>, that I
                                        have asked you<lb/> for this. For my dear wife might, God
                                        forbid, be troubled by this, and<lb/> I might be sorry for
                                        it. She has altogether too much of a sense of<lb/> honor. By
                                        the life of this writer, she knows nothing about this.
                                        I<lb/> have simply told her that I have written to you from
                                                  <placeName>Bremen</placeName>. My dear<lb/> wife
                                        and children will soon write to you themselves. Please send
                                        you<lb/> answer soon. I hope that you will always write
                                        frequently, for my<lb/> dear wife is always anxious about
                                        you when you do not write. I know<lb/> of no further news to
                                        write but do not forget to write frequently.</p>
