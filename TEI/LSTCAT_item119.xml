                may “<hi rend="underline">Prepare</hi>” as<lb/> the congregation <hi
                    rend="underline">do not intend</hi> to act in the matter<lb/> so says
                    <persName>Valentine</persName>, at same time I would advise that<lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">you</hi> remain <hi rend="underline">perfectly
                silent</hi>.<lb/> “entre nous” Yesterday I recd a letter from <placeName>New
                    Orleans</placeName><lb/> from one of the Trustees of K. K. Dispersed of
                Israel</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>informing me that <persName>Rev M N Nathan</persName> had <sic>voluntary</sic><lb/>
                resigned his office as minister, and requesting me to<lb/> inform <persName>Dr
                    Eckman</persName> of this fact and to invite him<lb/> to <del>become a
                    candidate</del> apply for the situation<lb/> as <sic>If</sic> they can procure a
                minister without advertising<lb/> they would prefer it no reason being assigned<lb/>
                for the resignation of <persName>Mr Nathan</persName>. <persName>Dr
                    Eckman</persName><lb/> has written to <persName>Mr Nathan</persName> to know
                from him<lb/> whether his resignation is permanent or whether<lb/> he would again
                resume office if matters were<lb/> accommodated to him, as he would not
                interrupt<lb/> or make application, without he first <hi rend="underline">was
                    certain</hi><lb/> of this fact. Should such be the case, and<lb/> you do not

                    Kursheet</persName> might have some weight<lb/> to induce them to accept him, I
                take it for granted<lb/> that they have not <hi rend="underline">offered</hi> you
                the situation as my<lb/> letter is from one of the Trustees. <persName>Mr Myer
