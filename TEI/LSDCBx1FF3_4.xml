                                                  shown to Israelites in education</add> in the
                                        choice of their<lb/> chief religious officer. What
                                        inducement is it for our young<lb/> men to apply themselves
                                        to the study of their religion when<lb/> they see men of
                                        that stamp placed in the highest and<lb/> most important
                                        religious stations, men who know nothing<lb/> about what
                                        they are reading or why they read it, men<lb/> who perhaps
                                        could not read a single line in a Hebrew<lb/> book which is
                                        not exactly the one that they were taught<lb/> (Parrotlike)
                                        to say their prayers in. I ask again what in-<lb/>ducement
                                        is there for the young man to curtail his hours<lb/> of
                                        pleasure for the more dry study of his religion, when<lb/>
                                        such a state of things exists, when he knows that
                                        instead<lb/> of a knowledge of the rudiments of his religion
                                        and the<lb/> unerring principles on which it is founded that
                                        the<lb/> high qualifications for the reading desk consists
                                        in his<lb/> ability to favor the congregation with some
                                        operatic tunes<lb/> (tunes generally more fit for any other
                                        place than one of<lb/> religious worship) or that he knows
                                        he can read his prayers<lb/> in Hebrew without understanding
                                        them and that his<lb/> Hazan can do no more. But surely it
                                        is high time that<lb/> this state of things should cease. In
                                        this country where<lb/> we have about sixty Hazanim perhaps
                                        there <del>is</del><add>are</add> not more<lb/> than ten
                                        amongst them that could answer the most plain<lb/> or simple
                                        question about their religion or what or why things<lb/> are
                                        prohibited or allowed by its holy laws<add>;</add> and as in
                                        the<lb/> United States we are multiplying congregations
                                        faster<lb/> than perhaps <del>than</del>in the whole of the
                                        rest of the world it<lb/> becomes absolutely necessary that
                                        the greatest care should<lb/> be taken in selecting and
                                        appointing proper persons for that<lb/> most important
