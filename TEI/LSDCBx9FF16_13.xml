            <p rend="indent(1)">Dear Sir</p>
            <p rend="indent(2)">I take the opportunity at this<lb/> season of the year to write you
                a few lines<lb/> wishing you many happy returns of the<lb/> festivals &amp; that you
                may be spared many<lb/> more years to defend Ancient Orthodox<lb/> Judaism in
                    <placeName>America</placeName>, against the Anti<lb/> Jewish doctrines of the
                new lights.<lb/> I receive regularly your Occident, &amp; feel<lb/> the same
                pleasure in reading it that I<lb/> always did in <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName>,
                    <persName>Mr Lewis<lb/> Nathan</persName>, <placeName>10 Finsbury
                    Circus</placeName>, requests me<lb/> to say he wishes to become a
                subscriber,<lb/> that gentleman is one of the Parnassim of<lb/> the Great Synagogue,
                [The Synagogues here<lb/> are all conducted on Orthodox principles<lb/> with the
                exception of the <placeName>Margaret St.</placeName><lb/> one, &amp; that I am told
                does not increase<lb/> its number of members very rapidly, if at<lb/> all. The
                branch places of worship of the<lb/> Great &amp; Portuguese Synagogues, in a
                great<lb/> measure having checked it, as formerly<lb/> numbers attended there who
                could not walk<lb/> the distance to the City Synagogues; They<lb/> have just
                reopened it with an Organ, like<lb/> all new customs introduced into Jewish
                Worship,<lb/> as established by our Sages, they must have<lb/> after a certain time
                a change, hence the<lb/> introduction of the Organ. The <placeName>Portland<lb/>
                    St.</placeName> Synagogue a branch of the Great, divide<lb/> the morning
                Service, from the Reading of the<lb/> Law, Additional Service &amp; Sermon, on
                    <date>Sabbath</date><lb/> &amp; holidays with the exception of the</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p><date>New Year</date> &amp; <date>Day of Atonement</date>. The<lb/> prayers for rain
                &amp; dew have also been<lb/> curtailed in that Synagogue by the Sanction<lb/> of
                    <persName>Dr. Adler</persName> the Chief Rabbi, but none of<lb/> the other
                Peyatim are abolished, the Second<lb/> service commences at ½ past 10 Oclock,
                it<lb/> is true this division makes a great many<lb/> attend service which never
                used, but at<lb/> the first service the Synagogue is almost<lb/> deserted there
                being hardly more than Minyan<lb/> attending, so that I believe the rising
                generation<lb/> when they grow up will almost forget there<lb/> is such a service as
                Shocras, it would be<lb/> much better to have both services together &amp;<lb/>
                commence at 9 O Clock; In the country<lb/> most of the Congregations are small, I
                have<lb/> visited a great many of them, &amp; strange to<lb/> say whereas in the
                    <placeName>United States</placeName> the small<lb/> congregations increase
                rapidly, here they diminish.<lb/> At <placeName>Manchester</placeName> besides the
                orthodox congregation,<lb/> there is a seceding one the minister of<lb/> which was
                formerly minister of an orthodox<lb/> one but he having had a misunderstanding<lb/>
                with the members, became a seceder, did the<lb/> disagreement with the members of
                his former<lb/> congregation alter his religious views? I am<lb/> told a great many
                attend that Synagogue that<lb/> never before attended any but would not<lb/> the
                minister have been just as soon able to<lb/> have brought them there by introducing

            <p>In concluding this letter I must say the Great<lb/> Synagogue has a very grand &amp;
                Solemn appearance<lb/> on the <date>Day of Atonement</date>, there is something<lb/>
                in it that makes a person feel devout on<lb/> entering &amp; without any organ to
                occasion those<lb/> feelings. There was only one person wanted &amp;<lb/> that was
                our respected Chief Rabbi who was<lb/> absent being in ill health &amp; ordered to
                the sea sick<lb/> but I am glad to say he is fast recovering, the<lb/>
                <persName>Revd. Mr. Ascher</persName> the Reader, performed the<lb/> services in the
                same impressive way that he<lb/> used ten years ago when I heard him. I<lb/> must
                now conclude giving you my best<lb/> wishes &amp; hoping to hear from you,</p>
