                                        especially when he happens not to be familiar with the<lb/>

                              <p>as he stated for the above named society, called on me<lb/> and
                                        after having taken the trouble twice to converse with<lb/>
                                        him on religion, he felt so fully defeated, that
                                        although<lb/> he promised to call again, he never did so. I
                                        saw him<lb/> walking the streets frequently after that, and
                                        I was told<lb/> by the minister of the fifth

                                        intelligent, and that<lb/> he entertained great hopes soon
                                        to bring them to the<lb/> knowledge of divine truth. He has
                                        not even been listened<lb/> to what his mission was, by any
                                        other jew in this city, and<lb/> as to the truth of the
                                        effects of my arguments, as above said<lb/> I will bring
                                        christians who were present at the time to tes-<lb/>tify to
                                        the same. This and similar facts with what I know<lb/> of

                                        they had agreed upon, to<lb/> compensate his soils in giving

                                        Dollars, and now it appears, since they full well knew<lb/>
                                        that their stupid minds would not pick up sufficient<lb/>
