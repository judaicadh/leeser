			<p><addressee>Rev. Mr. Isaac Leeser</addressee></p>
          <p rend="indent(2)"><placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>.</p>
          <p rend="indent(4)">Dear Sir&#33;</p>
          <p rend="indent(5)">Since <persName>Mr. Marcusson</persName><lb/> has honored me with the perusal of the contents of your<lb/> letter&#44; I take the liberty to say&#44; that we need not<lb/> at all be surprised at the false assertions of <persName>Bonahan</persName><lb/> or any of his colleagues in the fabrication of falshoods<lb/> in regard to their pretended invasion into Judaism.<lb/> The knowledge I have obtained on various occasions of men<lb/> of their stamp&#44; has taught me sufficiently that protes&#45;<lb/>tantic jesuitism is existing to a great extent&#44; among<lb/> a class of man who render the name of a society for<lb/> the purpose of ameliorating the condition of the jews<lb/> send many idlers abroad&#44; among them a few renegades<lb/> from our holy religion&#44; who are <sic>to</sic> lazy to work for an<lb/> honest living. &#40;We can easily spare them as the prophet says<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>&#41;. These men are ever ready and so very eager<lb/> to bounce upon every word uttered by an unsuspecting man<lb/> especially when he happens not to be familiar with the<lb/> language&#44; to construe this to their purpose&#44; than to publish<lb/> it with so many embellishments and <sic>fabulus</sic> ideas of their own<lb/> begetting&#44; as to make it very interesting to the ear of their<lb/> bigotted emploiers. A matter of fact only lately occurred<lb/> to <sic>miself</sic>&#44; will serve to illustrate the above. As man<lb/> calling himself <persName><hi rend="underline">Avery</hi></persName> from <placeName>New York</placeName> state and travelling</p>
		<pb n="2"/>
			<p>as he stated for the above named society&#44; called on me<lb/> and after having taken the trouble twice to converse with<lb/> him on religion&#44; he felt so fully defeated&#44; that although<lb/> he promised to call again&#44; he never did so. I saw him<lb/> walking the streets frequently after that&#44; and I was told<lb/> by the minister of the fifth <sic>presbiterian</sic> church&#42;&#44; that he<lb/> preached the <date>Sunday</date> following our arguments at his<lb/> church&#44; <sic>were</sic> he stated&#44; that he visited some of the jews<lb/> in this city&#44; that he found them very intelligent&#44; and that<lb/> he entertained great hopes soon to bring them to the<lb/> knowledge of divine truth. He has not even been listened<lb/> to what his mission was&#44; by any other jew in this city&#44; and<lb/> as to the truth of the effects of my arguments&#44; as above said<lb/> I will bring christians who were present at the time to tes&#45;<lb/>tify to the same. This and similar facts with what I know<lb/> of <persName>Mr. M.</persName> up to this day&#44; leads me to suppose that those<lb/> Sharks after paying him what they had agreed upon&#44; to<lb/> compensate his soils in giving them hebrew lessons&#44; they ende&#45;<lb/>vor to represent this as a bribe to induce the above said<lb/> Gentl<hi rend="sup">n</hi> to change his religion. Now <sic>miself</sic> and many others<lb/> here will prove that he regards money <hi rend="underline">to</hi> little ever to<lb/> fall a victim to such a snare. I have ascertained<lb/> that he has instructed those men for nearly four months<lb/> every day except <date>Saturday</date> &#38; <date>Sunday</date>&#8212;for the small pittance<lb/> of 70 Dollars&#44; and now it appears&#44; since they full well knew<lb/> that their stupid minds would not pick up sufficient<lb/> hebrew an <sic>equevalence</sic> for their so much spoken of <add>&#63;</add>&#44;<lb/> they had a more jesuitic aim in view in regard to <persName>Mr M.</persName><lb/> but since they did not succeed&#44; they try to revenge</p>
		<pb n="3"/>
			<p>themselves&#44; by proclaiming to the world the flattering<lb/> hope of the conversion of a Rabby.</p>
			<p>The position of these men&#44; and especially that of <persName>Mr Bonahan</persName><lb/> is actually very deplorable. The latter gentln although I have<lb/> no personal knowledge of&#44; I still have received such<lb/> a description of his character by a very eminent christian<lb/> a Gentl<hi rend="sup">n</hi> of great learning and thorough knowledge<lb/> to <sic>guarrantee</sic> my supposition&#44; that we may rely as much<lb/> on his assertions&#44; as on those of any other <add>Hebrew</add>.</p>
			<p>What most surprised me was that&#44; <persName>Mr. M.</persName> condescended<lb/> even to take the least notice of the slanderous productions<lb/> of a parcel of man&#44; who for money collected or almost&#45;<lb/>extorted&#44; from the blind industrious portion of the community&#44;<lb/> pretend to undertake&#44; to ameliorate the condition of a nation&#44;<lb/> who because being least&#44; had ever to submit to all sorts<lb/> of persecutions&#59; at the same time losing <sic>intirely</sic> sight<lb/> of the great defects existing among their own people.<lb/> Considering them <sic>cristians</sic>&#44; because they curse &#38; swear by<lb/> the name of <sic>Crist</sic>. <hi rend="underline">Who needs conversion&#63;</hi><lb/> Surely no man of sense&#33; <hi rend="underline">Besides can pecuniary<lb/> inducements convert a man</hi>&#63; She will say no&#33;<lb/> Then why did these men of <placeName>Montgomery</placeName> <sic>promiz</sic> him such<lb/> a glorious future of indolence and opulence&#44; if he would<lb/> only to consent to stay with them&#44; by which means they<lb/> supposed to produce a rupture between him and his<lb/> people&#63; Why bring those by <persName>Mr. M.</persName> so hard earned paltry<lb/> 70 Dollars so emphatically into consideration. For my part<lb/> I am so well <sic>aquainted</sic> with these petty <sic>manoevers</sic> such<lb/> as invitations to prayer meetings&#44; and other apparent brotherly</p>
		<pb n="4"/>
			<p>treatments and even lies to effect their purpose.<lb/> But not every body can comprehend their motives.</p> 
          <p rend="indent(1)">Let us cast a look into the dissensions of their own<lb/> churches where nothing but love is taught but not prac&#45;<lb/>tised&#44; with plenty of brothers and sisters on their tongue<lb/> but none in their hearts&#44; and then look at the <add>&#63;</add><lb/> friendly face of the missionary&#44; and we cannot mistake<lb/> the <sic>hipocrite</sic>.</p>
			<p>Their attempt to injure <persName>Mr Ms</persName> character as a Rabby is<lb/> to bottomless&#44; to cause him any fear.</p>
			<p>I would refer him to Deut. 7.17.18.</p>
			<p>If my time as a business man would only permit me I<lb/> could tell many things which have come under my<lb/> notice&#44; as well in this country as in <placeName>england</placeName>.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I hope the above will suffice at present&#44; and<lb/> I think that the public may be benefitted by reading<lb/> the words of Alether.</p>
			<p>I hope <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> that you may grant it a space in your<lb/> valuable paper as far as you may consider proper.<lb/>  The truth of all I said I can establish by living <sic>wittnesses</sic>&#44;<lb/> and as <persName>Mr. Marcusson</persName> has not sufficient power of the English<lb/> language&#44; I thought to do no more than my duty in<lb/> defending him against <add>Hebrew</add>.  This latter expression<lb/> I have also used above&#44; since I know they consider it<lb/> the greatest insult.</p>
          <p rend="indent(2)">Yours Sir very <sic>respectfuly</sic></p>
