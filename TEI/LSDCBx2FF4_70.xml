            <p rend="indent(5)">Your letter of the <date>15<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> ult.<lb/>
                would have been immediately replied to, although I received it but a<lb/> day after
                    <add>ר"ה</add>, had I not been otherwise overwhelmed with the<lb/> most various
                business engagements, not the least of which was<lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">moving 2 days after that Festival</hi>. But now, I have sat
                down<lb/> to write a lengthy answer to your rather long letter, and intend<lb/> to
                be as open and candid with you as you have been with me.<lb/> First then, you take
                umbrage at my <sic>indorsing</sic> what <hi rend="underline">you</hi> call<lb/> the
                    <hi rend="underline">scurrilous</hi> and <hi rend="underline">impertinent</hi>
                editorial of the Asmonean in re-<lb/>lation to the establishment of your Synagogue.
                Now, my dear Sir,<lb/> I have always held the opinion that it is unjustifiable, <hi
                    rend="underline">under</hi><lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">any circumstances whatever</hi>, to establish a new religious
                associ-<lb/>ation, unless <hi rend="underline">from principle</hi>. If a change of
                doctrines has<lb/> taken root in a religious body, then, <hi rend="underline">and
                    then alone</hi>, I think,<lb/> it is right for those repudiating that change, to
                establish an<lb/> association of their own. Was such the case in
                    <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>?<lb/> Decidedly not! And for this reason I
                subscribe to the re-<lb/>marks of the <hi rend="underline">Asmonean</hi> which are
                neither scurrilous nor impertin-<lb/>ent. I would ask any unprejudiced mind, whether
                the following<lb/> words, to which I made allusion in my last letter, are such
                as<lb/> you describe them? “What necessity can be shown in
                    <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName><lb/> for two Sephardim congregations? There
                exists no difference on<lb/> dogma; none on form, tone or accentuation; neither is
                the edifice<lb/>
                <sic>to</sic> small for the congregators, even, if they all invariably attended</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>2/</p>
            <p>whenever the portals were opened for service. A watchful opposition<lb/> is
                beneficial, a severing one, suspicious; and the leaders of the<lb/> latter are bound
                to justify themselves before the world, when they<lb/> attempt to launch into
                existence an opposition congregation.”<lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">You</hi> may find these remarks “scurrilous &amp; impertinent,”
                I think<lb/> they contain the plainest truth. Of course, this is only a
                difference<lb/> of opinion, upon which neither of <hi rend="underline">us</hi> can
                decide. However, this<lb/> much I venture to add, that if the Congregation
                Beth-El-Emeth<lb/> had been a reformed one, and the <hi rend="underline"
                    >Asmonean</hi> had made even<lb/> some stronger remarks, <persName>Mr.
                    Leeser</persName> wold not have deemed them<lb/> “scurrilous and impertinent.”
                You do me further injustice by saying<lb/> that I “So far forgot the courtesies of
                life, as to decide<lb/> without knowing the least of the situation of affairs in
                    <placeName>Phila-<lb/>delphia</placeName>.” Now, I can assure you that, although
                I am no Editor<lb/> of a Journal, a Magazine, I am still pretty well informed<lb/>
                with regard to all that is going on in the larger congregations<lb/> of our
                brethren. Besides, have not <hi rend="underline">you</hi> given me the clue<lb/> to
                “the situation of affairs in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>,” at our
                interview<lb/> on the <date>17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of July 1856</date>? Did <hi
                    rend="underline">you</hi> not then tell me that “it<lb/> depended but upon your
                encouraging the movement, and a new<lb/> congregation would be established; for the
                tyranny in the old<lb/> had become intolerable.” Thus then it was “<hi
                    rend="underline">tyranny</hi>” that<lb/> gave birth to the new congregation.
                Tyranny of opinion, principle,<lb/> reform, innovation, and the like? Nothing of all
                this. The<lb/> tyranny so called by a minority that desire a majority to
                sub-<lb/>mit to <hi rend="underline">them</hi>, by a minority that would not obey
                the laws and<lb/> regulations passed and executed by the legal majority. Is<lb/>
                such an imaginary “tyranny” a just course for secession? No, no,<lb/> thrice no! And
                because it is not, such a secession is rebellion that</p>

            <p>should never be countenanced. But, say you in your letter to me, “did it<lb/> not
                strike you, that <persName>Isaac Leeser's</persName> friends may have thought that
                he had been<lb/> in retirement long enough, and that it was but just to protect
                him<lb/> against the slander of <persName>Wise</persName>,
                    <persName>Einhorn</persName>, especially that contemptible price<lb/> of
                criticism in the <date>March</date> Sinai which was translated on
                    <date>Pureem</date> day in a certain city<lb/> called
                    <placeName>Charleston</placeName> by a gentleman whom you perhaps know” (<hi

                <hi rend="underline">farther down</hi>), “of the Asmonean, the director of the

                correspondents on this side of the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName>?<lb/> Now, as you
                have read my strictures on the “Deutsch-Americanische<lb/> Skizzen” you must have
                perceived from the part <hi rend="underline">defending</hi> you, that<lb/> some sort
                of such a though <hi rend="underline">did</hi> really “strike” my mind; but it is
                still<lb/> questionable whether the means adopted by your friends with the view<lb/>
                of giving you satisfaction was a <hi rend="underline">moral</hi> one. The end never
                justi-<lb/>fies the means; and however great and acute the real or imaginary<lb/>
                “slanders” were, of which you complain, and however anxious and<lb/> justified your
                friends may have been to protect and satisfy you<lb/> in <hi rend="underline"
                    >some</hi> way, all this can not induce me to approve a means<lb/> which I, in
                my humble opinion, look upon as rebellious and, therefore,<lb/> immoral. Others may
                think otherwise; they are welcome to their opinion,<lb/> and I do not wish to
                disturb them in their enjoyment of it, as<lb/> little as I can be divested of mine,
                or would permit them to dis-<lb/>turb my convictions. From your letter I perceive
                that the greatest<lb/> number of the Portuguese <add>?</add> of
                    <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> attend <hi rend="underline">your</hi>
                Syna-<lb/> gogue; why, if this majority thus are <hi rend="underline">your</hi>
                friends, why have<lb/> they not exercised their power in the old congregation, in
                your favor?<lb/> This would have been legal, moral and, consequently, right, so<lb/>
                that but the slanderous tongue of malice could then have made any<lb/> objection;
                whereas now, <hi rend="underline">just</hi> criticism may well find room for<lb/>
                its strictures and needs fear no <hi rend="underline">retorts</hi>. You see,

            <p>have been often with you, on this point, and shall further imitate you in<lb/>
                candor, now, as I shall speak of another point, already alluded to above.<lb/>
                Amongst the slander against which your friends protected you, you<lb/> mention also
                “that contemptible piece of criticism in the <date>March</date> Sinai,<lb/> which
                was translated on <hi rend="underline"><date>Pureem</date></hi> day in a certain

            </p>
            <p>This point in my letter I reached on the day mentioned at the head<lb/> of these
                lines when I was interrupted and would not resume them until<lb/> this day. Yet, I
                do not regret this long delay for two reasons: it is my<lb/> best <sic>defence</sic>
                against any charge of writing in excitement; for had your<lb/> letter even caused
                it, it must have been calmed by the long interval<lb/> between its receipt and my
                reply to it. In the second place, the <date>November</date><lb/> manner of the <hi
                    rend="underline">Occident</hi>, which reached me since, offers me an
                opportuni-<lb/>ty to advert to other matters that were then unknown to me.</p>
            <p>And now let us return to the subject broken off above. No one<lb/> can deny that the
                so-called Jewish Sunday Schools, as they have<lb/> been hitherto, and still are
                managed, did more harm than good,<lb/> have been, in a word, mere mockeries of
                religious schools. Some old<lb/> maids, with the view, perhaps, of atoning for the
                sins of their youth, and<lb/> imagining henceforward to consecrate their lives unto
                the Service of God,<lb/> undertake, altho' knowing as little of their Religion and
                the history<lb/> of their nation, as their pupils themselves, to establish and
                manage<lb/> religious schools, that is to say, take it upon themselves to impart
                the<lb/> most important of all branches of education, which requires some
                know-<lb/>ledge, circumspection and experience than any of its cognates. Now,<lb/>
                is the very attempt on the part of these managers not in itself<lb/> sacrilegious?
                And who are, in general, their assistant teachers?<lb/> A few young girls that do
                not even know how to <hi rend="underline">read</hi> the language<lb/> of the Bible,
                or some gentlemen who may be good business men,<lb/> mechanics, artists &amp;c
                &amp;c, but understand just as much of teaching<lb/> and their Religion as their <hi
                    rend="underline">sister</hi>-colleagues. All this, and still</p>
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>will you? I desire to compel them, to inform us also of the <hi rend="underline"
                    >con</hi>-<lb/><hi rend="underline">clusions</hi> of their arguments, which,
                thus far, we must only guess. There is<lb/> yet a good deal to be written until the
                    <add>Hebrew</add> will be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>I just remembered, that I forgot to mention one point with regard to <persName>Mr.
                    J's</persName><lb/> arguments, to prove to you, how little we can write without
                books. You<lb/> remember, that he maintained, that <persName>Hillel</persName>
                “ordered the non-enactment of<lb/> the <add>Hebrew</add>, because the land was
                tributary to <placeName>Rome</placeName>. Poor <persName>Mr J.</persName>! A
                glance<lb/> at <add>Hebrew</add> Vol 386, in the first line, would have told him
                another story:<lb/>
                <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> to which <persName>Rashi</persName>
                <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> remarks: <add>Hebrew</add>. From this point alone you must
                see, how<lb/> great his Talmudical learning is! He is indeed not yet infallible,
                although<lb/> he thinks so!</p>
            <p>You must excuse, that I break off here, so abruptly; the other<lb/> points in your
                letter will soon be attended to. My dear wife just<lb/> enters my study, and
                admonishes me to pay a few visits with her.<lb/> Accept her best regards, &amp; my
                own. Write soon, to yours,</p>
