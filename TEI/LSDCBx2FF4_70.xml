				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>Charleston&#44; S. C.</placeName> <date>October 5. 1857</date>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><addressee>Rev. Isaac Leeser</addressee>&#44; <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>&#44;</p>
			<p rend="indent(4)">Dear Sir&#8212;</p>
			<p rend="indent(5)">Your letter of the <date>15<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> ult.<lb/> would have been immediately replied to&#44; although I received it but a<lb/> day after <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; had I not been otherwise overwhelmed with the<lb/> most various business engagements&#44; not the least of which was<lb/> <hi rend="underline">moving 2 days after that Festival</hi>.  But now&#44; I have sat down<lb/> to write a lengthy answer to your rather long letter&#44; and intend<lb/> to be as open and candid with you as you have been with me.<lb/>  First then&#44; you take umbrage at my <sic>indorsing</sic> what <hi rend="underline">you</hi> call<lb/> the <hi rend="underline">scurrilous</hi> and <hi rend="underline">impertinent</hi> editorial of the Asmonean in re&#45;<lb/>lation to the establishment of your Synagogue.  Now&#44; my dear Sir&#44;<lb/> I have always held the opinion that it is unjustifiable&#44; <hi rend="underline">under</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">any circumstances whatever</hi>&#44; to establish a new religious associ&#45;<lb/>ation&#44; unless <hi rend="underline">from principle</hi>.  If a change of doctrines has<lb/> taken root in a religious body&#44; then&#44; <hi rend="underline">and then alone</hi>&#44; I think&#44;<lb/> it is right for those repudiating that change&#44; to establish an<lb/> association of their own.  Was such the case in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>&#63;<lb/>  Decidedly not&#33;  And for this reason I subscribe to the re&#45;<lb/>marks of the <hi rend="underline">Asmonean</hi> which are neither scurrilous nor impertin&#45;<lb/>ent.  I would ask any unprejudiced mind&#44; whether the following<lb/> words&#44; to which I made allusion in my last letter&#44; are such as<lb/> you describe them&#63;  &#8220;What necessity can be shown in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName><lb/> for two Sephardim congregations&#63;  There exists no difference on<lb/> dogma&#59; none on form&#44; tone or accentuation&#59; neither is the edifice<lb/> <sic>to</sic> small for the congregators&#44; even&#44; if they all invariably attended</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>2&#47;</p>
				<p>whenever the portals were opened for service.  A watchful opposition<lb/> is beneficial&#44; a severing one&#44; suspicious&#59; and the leaders of the<lb/> latter are bound to justify themselves before the world&#44; when they<lb/> attempt to launch into existence an opposition congregation.&#8221;<lb/>  <hi rend="underline">You</hi> may find these remarks &#8220;scurrilous &#38; impertinent&#44;&#8221; I think<lb/> they contain the plainest truth.  Of course&#44; this is only a difference<lb/> of opinion&#44; upon which neither of <hi rend="underline">us</hi> can decide.  However&#44; this<lb/> much I venture to add&#44; that if the Congregation Beth&#45;El&#45;Emeth<lb/> had been a reformed one&#44; and the <hi rend="underline">Asmonean</hi> had made even<lb/> some stronger remarks&#44; <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> wold not have deemed them<lb/> &#8220;scurrilous and impertinent.&#8221;  You do me further injustice by saying<lb/> that I &#8220;So far forgot the courtesies of life&#44; as to decide<lb/> without knowing the least of the situation of affairs in <placeName>Phila&#45;<lb/>delphia</placeName>.&#8221;  Now&#44; I can assure you that&#44; although I am no Editor<lb/> of a Journal&#44; a Magazine&#44; I am still pretty well informed<lb/> with regard to all that is going on in the larger congregations<lb/> of our brethren.  Besides&#44; have not <hi rend="underline">you</hi> given me the clue<lb/> to &#8220;the situation of affairs in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>&#44;&#8221; at our interview<lb/> on the <date>17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of July 1856</date>&#63;  Did <hi rend="underline">you</hi> not then tell me that &#8220;it<lb/> depended but upon your encouraging the movement&#44; and a new<lb/> congregation would be established&#59; for the tyranny in the old<lb/> had become intolerable.&#8221;  Thus then it was &#8220;<hi rend="underline">tyranny</hi>&#8221; that<lb/> gave birth to the new congregation.  Tyranny of opinion&#44; principle&#44;<lb/> reform&#44; innovation&#44; and the like&#63;  Nothing of all this.  The<lb/> tyranny so called by a minority that desire a majority to sub&#45;<lb/>mit to <hi rend="underline">them</hi>&#44; by a minority that would not obey the laws and<lb/> regulations passed and executed by the legal majority.  Is<lb/> such an imaginary &#8220;tyranny&#8221; a just course for secession&#63;  No&#44; no&#44;<lb/> thrice no&#33;  And because it is not&#44; such a secession is rebellion that</p>

				<p rend="align(right)"><hi rend="underline">3</hi></p>
				<p>should never be countenanced.  But&#44; say you in your letter to me&#44; &#8220;did it<lb/> not strike you&#44; that <persName>Isaac Leeser&#39;s</persName> friends may have thought that he had been<lb/> in retirement long enough&#44; and that it was but just to protect him<lb/> against the slander of <persName>Wise</persName>&#44; <persName>Einhorn</persName>&#44; especially that contemptible price<lb/> of criticism in the <date>March</date> Sinai which was translated on <date>Pureem</date> day in a certain city<lb/> called <placeName>Charleston</placeName> by a gentleman whom you perhaps know&#8221; &#40;<hi rend="underline">of this</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">farther down</hi>&#41;&#44; &#8220;of the Asmonean&#44; the director of the Deutsch&#45;Americanische<lb/> Skizzen&#44; and <persName>D Philippson</persName>&#44; and correspondents on this side of the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName>&#63;<lb/>  Now&#44; as you have read my strictures on the &#8220;Deutsch&#45;Americanische<lb/> Skizzen&#8221; you must have perceived from the part <hi rend="underline">defending</hi> you&#44; that<lb/> some sort of such a though <hi rend="underline">did</hi> really &#8220;strike&#8221; my mind&#59; but it is still<lb/> questionable whether the means adopted by your friends with the view<lb/> of giving you satisfaction was a <hi rend="underline">moral</hi> one.  The end never justi&#45;<lb/>fies the means&#59; and however great and acute the real or imaginary<lb/> &#8220;slanders&#8221; were&#44; of which you complain&#44; and however anxious and<lb/> justified your friends may have been to protect and satisfy you<lb/> in <hi rend="underline">some</hi> way&#44; all this can not induce me to approve a means<lb/> which I&#44; in my humble opinion&#44; look upon as rebellious and&#44; therefore&#44;<lb/> immoral.  Others may think otherwise&#59; they are welcome to their opinion&#44;<lb/> and I do not wish to disturb them in their enjoyment of it&#44; as<lb/> little as I can be divested of mine&#44; or would permit them to dis&#45;<lb/>turb my convictions.  From your letter I perceive that the greatest<lb/> number of the Portuguese <add>&#63;</add> of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> attend <hi rend="underline">your</hi> Syna&#45;<lb/> gogue&#59; why&#44; if this majority thus are <hi rend="underline">your</hi> friends&#44; why have<lb/> they not exercised their power in the old congregation&#44; in your favor&#63;<lb/>  This would have been legal&#44; moral and&#44; consequently&#44; right&#44; so<lb/> that but the slanderous tongue of malice could then have made any<lb/> objection&#59; whereas now&#44; <hi rend="underline">just</hi> criticism may well find room for<lb/> its strictures and needs fear no <hi rend="underline">retorts</hi>.  You see&#44; <persName>Mr Leeser</persName>&#44; I</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>4&#47;</p>
				<p>have been often with you&#44; on this point&#44; and shall further imitate you in<lb/> candor&#44; now&#44; as I shall speak of another point&#44; already alluded to above.<lb/>  Amongst the slander against which your friends protected you&#44; you<lb/> mention also &#8220;that contemptible piece of criticism in the <date>March</date> Sinai&#44;<lb/> which was translated on <hi rend="underline"><date>Pureem</date></hi> day in a certain city called <placeName>Charleston</placeName>&#44;<lb/> by a gentleman whom you &#40;I&#41; perhaps know.&#8221;</p>
			<p rend="indent(9)"><hi rend="underline"><date>November 25. 1857</date>.</hi></p>
				<p>This point in my letter I reached on the day mentioned at the head<lb/> of these lines when I was interrupted and would not resume them until<lb/> this day.  Yet&#44; I do not regret this long delay for two reasons&#58; it is my<lb/> best <sic>defence</sic> against any charge of writing in excitement&#59; for had your<lb/> letter even caused it&#44; it must have been calmed by the long interval<lb/> between its receipt and my reply to it.  In the second place&#44; the <date>November</date><lb/> manner of the <hi rend="underline">Occident</hi>&#44; which reached me since&#44; offers me an opportuni&#45;<lb/>ty to advert to other matters that were then unknown to me.</p>
				<p>And now let us return to the subject broken off above.  No one<lb/> can deny that the so&#45;called Jewish Sunday Schools&#44; as they have<lb/> been hitherto&#44; and still are managed&#44; did more harm than good&#44;<lb/> have been&#44; in a word&#44; mere mockeries of religious schools.  Some old<lb/> maids&#44; with the view&#44; perhaps&#44; of atoning for the sins of their youth&#44; and<lb/> imagining henceforward to consecrate their lives unto the Service of God&#44;<lb/> undertake&#44; altho&#39; knowing as little of their Religion and the history<lb/> of their nation&#44; as their pupils themselves&#44; to establish and manage<lb/> religious schools&#44; that is to say&#44; take it upon themselves to impart the<lb/> most important of all branches of education&#44; which requires some know&#45;<lb/>ledge&#44; circumspection and experience than any of its cognates.  Now&#44;<lb/> is the very attempt on the part of these managers not in itself<lb/> sacrilegious&#63;  And who are&#44; in general&#44; their assistant teachers&#63;<lb/>  A few young girls that do not even know how to <hi rend="underline">read</hi> the language<lb/> of the Bible&#44; or some gentlemen who may be good business men&#44;<lb/> mechanics&#44; artists &#38;c &#38;c&#44; but understand just as much of teaching<lb/> and their Religion as their <hi rend="underline">sister</hi>&#45;colleagues.  All this&#44; and still</p>
			<pb n="5"/>
				<p>will you&#63;  I desire to compel them&#44; to inform us also of the <hi rend="underline">con</hi>&#45;<lb/><hi rend="underline">clusions</hi> of their arguments&#44; which&#44; thus far&#44; we must only guess.  There is<lb/> yet a good deal to be written until the <add>Hebrew</add> will be fulfilled.</p>
				<p>I just remembered&#44; that I forgot to mention one point with regard to <persName>Mr. J&#39;s</persName><lb/> arguments&#44; to prove to you&#44; how little we can write without books.  You<lb/> remember&#44; that he maintained&#44; that <persName>Hillel</persName> &#8220;ordered the non&#45;enactment of<lb/> the <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; because the land was tributary to <placeName>Rome</placeName>.  Poor <persName>Mr J.</persName>&#33;  A glance<lb/> at <add>Hebrew</add> Vol 386&#44; in the first line&#44; would have told him another story&#58;<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> to which <persName>Rashi</persName> <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> remarks&#58; <add>Hebrew</add>.  From this point alone you must see&#44; how<lb/> great his Talmudical learning is&#33;  He is indeed not yet infallible&#44; although<lb/> he thinks so&#33;</p>
				<p>You must excuse&#44; that I break off here&#44; so abruptly&#59; the other<lb/> points in your letter will soon be attended to.  My dear wife just<lb/> enters my study&#44; and admonishes me to pay a few visits with her.<lb/>  Accept her best regards&#44; &#38; my own.  Write soon&#44; to yours&#44;</p>
