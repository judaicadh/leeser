            <p>My dear Sir.</p>
            <p rend="indent(2)">The Asmoneon was placed in my<lb/> hands today. And I was
                    <add>?</add> to find that <persName>Mr Jacobs</persName><lb/> had not withdrawn
                his letter.—I shall make but<lb/> little commentary on it, except that he has
                done<lb/> the same that he charges you with, he has attacked<lb/> the B. E.
                Congregation, and I would not wonder if <persName>Dr<lb/> Myer</persName> did not
                reply to him—my opinions of<lb/> the attack on yourself I sent to
                    <persName>Solomon</persName> who handed<lb/> it over to you. <persName>Dr.
                    Myer</persName> called tonight<lb/> and enclosed I give you the commentaries.<lb/>
                <sic>Paraphases</sic> or glasses, which ever they may<lb/> be called of
                    <sic>Sie</sic> celebrated authorities, which<lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">you maybe not have at hand</hi>, <persName>Dr
                Myer</persName><lb/> also discovered that <persName>Jacobs</persName> quotation from
                the<lb/> Midrash was incorrect, several words left<lb/> out.—I also enclose the
                correct quotation<lb/> which may also be of service to you, I should<lb/> like to
                    s<add>?</add> to furnish as many authorities<lb/> as possible to show that they
                are accessible<lb/> to you. While those be quotes, are to be found<lb/> in
                    <persName>Mendlesons</persName> Bible, in the hands of every german<lb/>
                schoolboy—and serves to show his shallowness<lb/> not to know a <hi rend="underline"
                    >true and Literal</hi> translation<lb/> from a gloss or commentary or
                    <sic>paraprase</sic>.<lb/> I wrote to <persName>Dr. Eckman</persName>. he
                promised to</p>
            <pb n="1V"/>
            <p>write, to you, I enclose you a letter Recd from<lb/> him in reply to a letter
                addressed him by <persName>Mr<lb/> Levin</persName> &amp; myself.—which letter
                simply requested<lb/> a true and literal version of the verse in question.<lb/>
                <persName>Mr Levin</persName> was dissatisfied with it, he believes<lb/>
                <persName>Jacob</persName> before <persName>Dr E.</persName> I am seriously<lb/>
                grieved about the thing, and should like a<lb/> reply to be published in the
                asmonean, —but<lb/> I would not condescend to day any more than<lb/> that you have
                made it an invaluable rule<lb/> not to answer any personal attacks, but<lb/> for the
                benefit of the literary public or the<lb/> readers of the Asmoneon you give the
                different<lb/> renderings of the verse in question, also<lb/> the various
                commentaries and <sic>paraprases</sic><lb/> and leave him to the contempt he
                merits,<lb/> He deserves to mend or cut to pieces, and<lb/> I believe there is
                enough in the article to<lb/> excite the revengeful passions of most men<lb/> but
                show <add>?</add> above it.</p>
