            <p><sic><addressee>Mr. Isai Leeser</addressee></sic>:</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Very honored Sir, I certainly <del>do not want</del> would not<lb/>
                be compelled you, dear sir, to be burdened with this<lb/> letter, had I not heard
                from many people of your<lb/> straight forwardness and true humanitarianism as<lb/>
                you <del>spread it before the masses</del> fully exemplify it in<lb/> your
                preaching. That is what encouraged me to write.<lb/> I, therefore, presume to rely
                upon your good under-<lb/>standing and your subsequent conviction and present<lb/>
                to you my most humble request. I want to do so<lb/> as briefly as possible and not
                burden you with many<lb/> words and therefore this is my story:</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">About five years ago I was forced by misfortune<lb/> to leave my
                fatherland, <placeName>Hungary</placeName>, along with<lb/> my family. Quite
                depressed and without any<lb/> thing, I arrived in <placeName>Boston</placeName>. A
                terrible misfortune might have<lb/> over taken me had not <persName>Herr Jacob
                    Sachs</persName> and<lb/> his wife exerted all their powers and protected<lb/>
                me and my six small children from destruction. That therefore<lb/> is the scene and
                some what more elaborate picture in<lb/> which several characters are portrayed. I
                transmitted<lb/> to <persName>Herr Isaac Wise</persName> in
                    <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName> with the<lb/> urgent request that he use it in
                his German<lb/> newspaper. I am enclosing herewith a copy of<lb/> my two letters to
                    <persName>Herr Wise</persName> for your<lb/> reading. "And behold the reaping
                season is<lb/> past, the summer is ended, and I have<lb/> waited in vain". I sent
                another letter to<lb/>
                <persName>Herr Wise</persName> in which I most politely requested</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>him to return to me my short work, "And behold<lb/> the autumn passed, and that which
                I sought I found not.<lb/> And I said, 'To whom among the holy shall i turn?'"<lb/>
                For, had he sent <del>it back empt</del> the work of my hands back<lb/> empty
                handed, I would have kept quiet—<hi rend="underline">but</hi><lb/> I am like a man
                who has not heard and there<lb/> are no arguments in his mouth, but now let<lb/> me
                speak and I shall feel relieved. I shall open<lb/> my lips and thou shalt answer.
                And let my<lb/> master decide between my brother and your brother<lb/> and settle
                the matter between us. As to you,<lb/>
                <persName>Isaac Laban</persName> (<persName>Wise</persName>), listen to my words, I
                will<lb/> not be partial to any man, nor call you by a<lb/> man's name, for
                according to your name such<lb/> is your praise*. Let your own mouth condemn<lb/>
                you and not I. And your lips give testimony<lb/> against you. Admit in front of the
                people<lb/> whether you have done this...<lb/>...or<lb/> that you are partial to
                princes, and if you say,<lb/> "Did this man come to dwell and raised himself<lb/> to
                the dignity of Judges", in this you are wrong,<lb/> for the former is justified in
                argument. But<lb/> admit that this is a grievous sin, that you<lb/> have placed your

            <p>Here follow the two letters which I sent to<lb/>
                <persName>Herr Wise</persName>, and please include them with<lb/> my entire

            <p>My address—<persName role="author">Karl Frischman</persName>, <placeName>Elliott<lb/>
                    Street, No. 101, Boston</placeName>.</p>
            <p>Addressed to <persName>I. Wise</persName>, Honored Sir:-</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Permit me a very urgent wish—to appear<lb/> before you. I am
                encouraged by the thought<lb/> that your very kindly disposition will forgive<lb/>
                this step of mine. Three moons have<lb/> passed since I left my fatherland
                    <placeName>Hungary</placeName>.<lb/> Providence directed my steps to
                    <placeName>America</placeName>,<lb/> that is to <placeName>Boston</placeName>.
                The bitterness of my<lb/> fortune and the suffering of my entire family<lb/> was so
                great that I can barely describe<lb/> it. In a word, nothing was left us. We<lb/>
                were completely without means. We were<lb/> starving. I was not afraid of death,
                nor<lb/> of the passing from one type of life into<lb/> another. For whoever
                bethought himself of<lb/> earthly life, what he is and what he can be,<lb/> whoever
                has constantly and willingly occupied</p>
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>himself with such thought, he can<lb/> appreciate the comfort which religion<lb/>
                gives to the human spirit. This strength-<lb/>ens his mind and heart. Whoever
                has<lb/> implicit trust in God, does not fear<lb/> death. In this respect I was
                quite con-<lb/>tent, <del>by</del> but my duty to my family circle<lb/> still had to
                be fulfilled. That is what<lb/> tortured me within, and that is how I<lb/> stood
                upon a foreign soil, namely in <placeName>Boston</placeName>,<lb/> wringing my hands
                and calling for help.<lb/> And who is it who <del>fr</del> saved me and my<lb/>
                family from annihilation? <persName>Herr Joseph<lb/> Sachs</persName>, the preacher
                and teacher of the<lb/> German congregation in <placeName>Boston</placeName>. Yes,
                this<lb/> sympathetic friend of humanity is the<lb/> one who rescued my family. To
                this<lb/> kindly man I therefore feel myself<lb/> completed indebted to thank openly
                for his noble action.<lb/> "Therefore,' said I, 'I shall go to commune<lb/> with
                    <persName>Isaac</persName>, to bring the story of my<lb/> murmuring lips in the
                collection of<lb/>
                <persName>Isaac</persName>, and through <persName>Isaac</persName> he may</p>
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>find fruit for himself, and if my hand<lb/> makes an error in explaining in dear<lb/>
                language all these occurrences which can<lb/> barely be imagined." Etc, etc.
                ......</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">He ends the letter with the<lb/> request that
                    <persName>Wise</persName> find him a position<lb/> somewhere (despite his
                inability to<lb/> speak the language) and that he print<lb/> his elaborate story in
                his German news-<lb/>paper.</p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> letter to <persName>Dr. Wise.</persName> (in Hebrew, with
                a<lb/> string of quotations from the Bible, begging<lb/> him to print his article,
                or return it.).</p>
            <p>Then follows an extract from the article which<lb/> he sent to <persName>Dr.
                    Wise</persName>. It consists of rhymed<lb/> lines on the style of the prayers in
                the Ashke-<lb/>nazic holiday prayer book, with indirect<lb/> references to Biblical
                heroes and ex-<lb/>pressions; also an acrostic poem with<lb/> the name of
                    <persName>Joseph</persName>.</p>
