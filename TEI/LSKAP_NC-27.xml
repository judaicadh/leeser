			<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>Boston</placeName>. <date>Dec. 23&#44; 1855</date></p>
				<p><sic><addressee>Mr. Isai Leeser</addressee></sic>&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Very honored Sir&#44; I certainly <del>do not want</del> would not<lb/> be compelled you&#44; dear sir&#44; to be burdened with this<lb/> letter&#44; had I not heard from many people of your<lb/> straight forwardness and true humanitarianism as<lb/> you <del>spread it before the masses</del> fully exemplify it in<lb/> your preaching.  That is what encouraged me to write.<lb/>  I&#44; therefore&#44; presume to rely upon your good under&#45;<lb/>standing and your subsequent conviction and present<lb/> to you my most humble request.  I want to do so<lb/> as briefly as possible and not burden you with many<lb/> words and therefore this is my story&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">About five years ago I was forced by misfortune<lb/> to leave my fatherland&#44; <placeName>Hungary</placeName>&#44; along with<lb/> my family.  Quite depressed and without any<lb/> thing&#44; I arrived in <placeName>Boston</placeName>.  A terrible misfortune might have<lb/> over taken me had not <persName>Herr Jacob Sachs</persName> and<lb/> his wife exerted all their powers and protected<lb/> me and my six small children from destruction.  That therefore<lb/> is the scene and some what more elaborate picture in<lb/> which several characters are portrayed.  I transmitted<lb/> to <persName>Herr Isaac Wise</persName> in <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName> with the<lb/> urgent request that he use it in his German<lb/> newspaper.  I am enclosing herewith a copy of<lb/> my two letters to <persName>Herr Wise</persName> for your<lb/> reading.  &#34;And behold the reaping season is<lb/> past&#44; the summer is ended&#44; and I have<lb/> waited in vain&#34;.  I sent another letter to<lb/> <persName>Herr Wise</persName> in which I most politely requested</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>him to return to me my short work&#44; &#34;And behold<lb/> the autumn passed&#44; and that which I sought I found not.<lb/>  And I said&#44; &#39;To whom among the holy shall i turn&#63;&#39;&#34;<lb/>  For&#44; had he sent <del>it back empt</del> the work of my hands back<lb/> empty handed&#44; I would have kept quiet&#8212;<hi rend="underline">but</hi><lb/> I am like a man who has not heard and there<lb/> are no arguments in his mouth&#44; but now let<lb/> me speak and I shall feel relieved.  I shall open<lb/> my lips and thou shalt answer.  And let my<lb/> master decide between my brother and your brother<lb/> and settle the matter between us.  As to you&#44;<lb/> <persName>Isaac Laban</persName> &#40;<persName>Wise</persName>&#41;&#44; listen to my words&#44; I will<lb/> not be partial to any man&#44; nor call you by a<lb/> man&#39;s name&#44; for according to your name such<lb/> is your praise&#42;.  Let your own mouth condemn<lb/> you and not I.  And your lips give testimony<lb/> against you.  Admit in front of the people<lb/> whether you have done this...<lb/>...or<lb/> that you are partial to princes&#44; and if you say&#44;<lb/> &#34;Did this man come to dwell and raised himself<lb/> to the dignity of Judges&#34;&#44; in this you are wrong&#44;<lb/> for the former is justified in argument.  But<lb/> admit that this is a grievous sin&#44; that you<lb/> have placed your trust in gold&#44; and had not...<lb/> etc&#44; etc</p>
				<p><persName role="author">Kalman <del>Dak</del> Frischman</persName></p>
				<p>&#42;The reference&#44; I suppose&#44; is to <persName>Labon</persName> and his<lb/> characteristics.</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>Here follow the two letters which I sent to<lb/> <persName>Herr Wise</persName>&#44; and please include them with<lb/> my entire correspondence in your well&#45;known<lb/> Occident.  Devotedly yours&#44; <persName role="author">Kalman Frischman</persName></p>
				<p>My address&#8212;<persName role="author">Karl Frischman</persName>&#44; <placeName>Elliott<lb/> Street&#44; No. 101&#44; Boston</placeName>.</p>
				<p>Addressed to <persName>I. Wise</persName>&#44; Honored Sir&#58;&#45;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Permit me a very urgent wish&#8212;to appear<lb/> before you.  I am encouraged by the thought<lb/> that your very kindly disposition will forgive<lb/> this step of mine.  Three moons have<lb/> passed since I left my fatherland <placeName>Hungary</placeName>.<lb/>  Providence directed my steps to <placeName>America</placeName>&#44;<lb/> that is to <placeName>Boston</placeName>.  The bitterness of my<lb/> fortune and the suffering of my entire family<lb/> was so great that I can barely describe<lb/> it.  In a word&#44; nothing was left us.  We<lb/> were completely without means.  We were<lb/> starving.  I was not afraid of death&#44; nor<lb/> of the passing from one type of life into<lb/> another.  For whoever bethought himself of<lb/> earthly life&#44; what he is and what he can be&#44;<lb/> whoever has constantly and willingly occupied</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>himself with such thought&#44; he can<lb/> appreciate the comfort which religion<lb/> gives to the human spirit.  This strength&#45;<lb/>ens his mind and heart.  Whoever has<lb/> implicit trust in God&#44; does not fear<lb/> death.  In this respect I was quite con&#45;<lb/>tent&#44; <del>by</del> but my duty to my family circle<lb/> still had to be fulfilled.  That is what<lb/> tortured me within&#44; and that is how I<lb/> stood upon a foreign soil&#44; namely in <placeName>Boston</placeName>&#44;<lb/> wringing my hands and calling for help.<lb/>  And who is it who <del>fr</del> saved me and my<lb/> family from annihilation&#63;  <persName>Herr Joseph<lb/> Sachs</persName>&#44; the preacher and teacher of the<lb/> German congregation in <placeName>Boston</placeName>.  Yes&#44; this<lb/> sympathetic friend of humanity is the<lb/> one who rescued my family.  To this<lb/> kindly man I therefore feel myself<lb/> completed indebted to thank openly for his noble action.<lb/>  &#34;Therefore&#44;&#39; said I&#44; &#39;I shall go to commune<lb/> with <persName>Isaac</persName>&#44; to bring the story of my<lb/> murmuring lips in the collection of<lb/> <persName>Isaac</persName>&#44; and through <persName>Isaac</persName> he may</p>
			<pb n="5"/>
				<p>find fruit for himself&#44; and if my hand<lb/> makes an error in explaining in dear<lb/> language all these occurrences which can<lb/> barely be imagined.&#34;  Etc&#44; etc. ......</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">He ends the letter with the<lb/> request that <persName>Wise</persName> find him a position<lb/> somewhere &#40;despite his inability to<lb/> speak the language&#41; and that he print<lb/> his elaborate story in his German news&#45;<lb/>paper.</p>
				<p>2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> letter to <persName>Dr. Wise.</persName>  &#40;in Hebrew&#44; with a<lb/> string of quotations from the Bible&#44; begging<lb/> him to print his article&#44; or return it.&#41;.</p>
				<p>Then follows an extract from the article which<lb/> he sent to <persName>Dr. Wise</persName>.  It consists of rhymed<lb/> lines on the style of the prayers in the Ashke&#45;<lb/>nazic holiday prayer book&#44; with indirect<lb/> references to Biblical heroes and ex&#45;<lb/>pressions&#59; also an acrostic poem with<lb/> the name of <persName>Joseph</persName>.</p>
