            <p>To the Parnass and members</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">of the congregation Mikveh Israel</p>
            <p rend="indent(2)">of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName></p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Gentlemen</p>
            <p rend="indent(2)">At one of your meetings in the early part<lb/> of this year, I asked
                for permission to be present at the<lb/> meeting and to address you personally in
                relation to and in ex-<lb/>planation <del>to</del> of matters which are, as I
                conceive, of great in-<lb/>terest to the congregation on the one side and to me, as
                your minister,<lb/> on the other. For circumstances had occurred, <del>and</del>
                over which<lb/> I had myself not the least control, which had excited feelings<lb/>
                that ought not to exist between us, and I fondly hoped that<lb/> a mutual
                interchange of opinions might tend to enable us<lb/> to come to a better
                understanding, and to proceed in future with<lb/> perfect harmony and mutual good
                will. But a construction of the<lb/> by-law, which specifies that none but members
                &amp; their sons over the<lb/> age of thirteen years should be present at any
                meeting of the congregation,<lb/> that the congregation could on no account permit
                any other than these<lb/> persons to be present at their deliberations, deprived me
                of this pleasure,<lb/> and at the same time was the cause, as I truly believe, that
                the<lb/> unimportant difference of opinion between us has not been long<lb/> since
                satisfactorily settled; for I honestly think that a few hours<lb/> free &amp; candid
                conversation would have exhibited things in a light<lb/> very different from what
                some now view it, or at least formerly did view<lb/> it. Understanding therefore,
                that a meeting has been called in<lb/> relation to the <sic>reengagement</sic> or
                reelection of the Hazan, I take the<lb/> liberty of sending you my own views in
                writing, and I shall endea-<lb/>vour to condense as much as possible, not wishing to
                fatigue<lb/> you with listening to a long harangue, or to introduce matters<lb/> not
                relevant to the subject. Let me premise the ardent hope,<lb/> that every member of
                the congregation in proceeding to delibe<lb/>rate upon the matter before the meeting
                will discard every<lb/> thing like prejudice and partiality, (and <hi
                    rend="underline">endeavour for</hi><lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">once to throw personal dislike</hi> or <hi rend="underline"
                    >friendship</hi> aside) and vote<lb/> in a manner which he can conscientiously
                hereafter look<lb/> upon as the best conducive to the welfare of the
                congregation<lb/> and to the promotion of the spread among us of that heavenly<lb/>
                religion which we have received; and lastly act, not as opponents<lb/> or supporters
                of the present incumbent of the office, but as men<lb/> and Israelites anxious for

            <p rend="indent(1)">To come to a proper understanding of my connection with the
                congre<lb/>gation I will briefly give a short account of my stay in this city,
                since<lb/> it is highly probable that some of the facts may have escaped the
                recollec<lb/>tion of the members. It is now nearly eleven years ago that
                through<lb/> the partiality of several residents of
                    <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> I was applied to to become<lb/> a candidate
                for the office of Hazan then recently vacant through the<lb/> death of the
                    <persName>Revd. A. I. Keys</persName>. I at that time lived with my uncle at
                    <placeName>Rich-<lb/>mond</placeName> in capacity of a mercantile clerk; I had
                the confidence of many<lb/> persons in the state of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>
                and the city of <placeName>Richmond</placeName>, and if I had en-<lb/>tered in
                business for myself my chances of success would have been as<lb/> good, to say the
                least, as that of many young men, who since then <del>that time</del><lb/> have
                earned an honourable independence and respectable standing.<lb/> I had at that time
                just passed my twenty-second year, my health, though<lb/> never very robust, was
                better than it is now and has been for many years<lb/> past; and though young and
                inexperienced I was not dazzled with the<lb/> prospect of obtaining a high &amp;
                responsible office. On the contrary, I not<lb/> only expressed, but truly felt a
                want of confidence in my abilities to<lb/> discharge properly the new duties to be
                expected from the situation of a minister<lb/>
                <del>properly</del>; and for a long while I absolutely refused to permit my
                name<lb/> to be used. My friends were not satisfied, they urged, that the
                education<lb/> I had received, and the talents which their partiality ascribed to
                me,<lb/> pointed out to me a different calling from that of a merchant; they<lb/>
                appealed to my feelings as an Israelite who ought to labour in the propa<lb/>gation
                of true religion among his brethren; and to my want of <del>a</del> riper years<lb/>
                <del>age</del> which I opposed to my fitness for the office, the averred that<lb/>
                that would correct itself every day, as daily my increase of age would entitle<lb/>
                me to more respect. Without being satisfied that my happiness<lb/> would be
                increased by a change of pursuits, I left, being over-persua-<lb/>ded by the
                arguments of those who were older, wiser and more expe-<lb/>rienced than myself,
                    <del>I left</del> the paternal roof of my uncle about<lb/> the middle of
                    <date>August 1829</date> to go away persons entirely strangers to<lb/> me, and
                upon whom I had no farther claims than the community<lb/> of faith given to the
                humblest of <placeName>Israel's</placeName> sons upon the most exalted<lb/> I had
                fondly hoped, that if the <sic>sufferages</sic> of the members would call<lb/> me to
                preside over their worship and to appeal in their behalf<lb/> to the throne of
                Grace, every thing like disunion<add>?</add>, want of confidence,<lb/> or the wising
                up with worldly matters, <hi rend="underline">such as regards salary, emolu-</hi><lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">ments &amp;c would have been banished</hi>. But I regret that
                such was<lb/> not the case. In the letter sent to me by the committee of
                corres-<lb/>pondence, consisting I believe of <persName>Messrs R. De
                    Cordova</persName>, <persName>L. M. Goldsmidt</persName> and</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p rend="align(right)">3</p>
            <p><persName>Isaiah Nathans</persName> it was distinctly stated, that the salary
                attached to the office<lb/> was $1000 Dollars, and in fact <persName>Messrs
                    Carvalho</persName> &amp; <persName>Keys</persName> both received this<lb/>
                amount, and I hear moreover that it was understood, that the latter gen-<lb/>tleman
                found that amount entirely insufficient for his support. Yet after<lb/> I had been
                here a few days I was waited upon by several gentlemen,<lb/> one of whom your
                respected Treasurer, who represented to me that the funds<lb/> of the congregation
                were then too low to allow the payment of the above<lb/> sum. I therefore authorized
                an election for <hi rend="underline">one</hi> year with a <hi rend="underline"
                    >voluntary</hi><lb/> surrender of two hundred Dollars; but when the report was
                afterwards<lb/> brought to me that I had been elected by a vote of 27 to 7 for
                two<lb/> years at $800 per annum, I also consented though against my original<lb/>
                intention, thus proving that I was not unwilling to make a pecuniary<lb/> sacrifice
                where I thought it was requisite. During the first year, how-<lb/>ever, of my
                residence here, various unpleasant things took place,<lb/> which it is needless to
                call to mind again; and altho' matters were<lb/> smoothed over again, <hi
                    rend="underline">still the report reached a distant congregation</hi>,<lb/> that
                my situation was not very pleasant here. Therefore overtures<lb/> were made to me by
                several influential members from that place<lb/> to take the office of Hazan vacant
                there. About the same time a meeting<lb/> of this congregation was held, at which it
                was understood that it had been<lb/> left to a committee to reengage me at $800 per
                annum for five years.<lb/> As this amount was evidently less than I had a right to
                expect, I did<lb/> not think myself at liberty altogether to decline a proposal
                made<lb/> to me from abroad; yet <hi rend="underline">I made such exorbitant demands
                    as almost</hi><lb/> to preclude any idea of their being agreed to; one was <hi
                    rend="underline">an election with-</hi><lb/><hi rend="underline">out being a
                    candidate</hi> or going on to be heard beforehand; second, one election<lb/> for
                life; third, an absence of three months every year, and lastly to be<lb/> permitted
                to stay in this congregation three months after the expiration<lb/> of my time of
                service, to enable them to provide a suitable successor.<lb/> Strange enough, all
                but the two first demands (and they in a modified<lb/> degree to correspond with the
                laws of the above Kahal) would have been accep-<lb/>ted, if I may put any confidence
                in the assertions of the heads of the con-<lb/>gregation, if in case I had consented
                to accept office there; but as<lb/> their election was to be held in
                    <date>July</date>, and as the meeting of this congre<lb/>gation would not take
                place till <date>September</date>, I declined soon all farther<lb/> correspondence,
                as I could not conscientiously leave this place before I<lb/> had made every effort
                at reconciliation. It will therefore appear,<lb/> that whether I could or could not
                have been elected elsewhere, which<lb/> must remain a <hi rend="underline"
                    >matter</hi> of <hi rend="underline">doubt</hi>, I at all events declined
                leaving</p>
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>4</p>
            <p>hastily, though I was <hi rend="underline">offered</hi> more advantageous terms
                elsewhere were I <hi rend="underline">asked</hi><lb/> here, and it was very doubtful
                whether your body would recede from their<lb/> vote which had been adopted after
                mature deliberation. If then I put<lb/> the congregation in danger of being
                unprovided with a minister, I put<lb/> myself equally in jeopardy of losing a
                situation, as there was no vacancy<lb/> at that precise period in any city in this
                country, and it is not so easy,<lb/> as some may imagine, to change one's
                occupation, and that at a moment's<lb/> warning.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The congregation however found my reasons, addressed to them<lb/>
                correct &amp; cogent, and they so altered their vote as to elect me for<lb/> five
                years at one thousand Dollars. So matters remained for the<lb/> whole period, till a
                reelection became necessary, when although<lb/> there was no opposing candidate,
                still I was only reelected, as I heard<lb/> a year afterwards, by a bare majority,
                despite that there was<lb/> no charge of misconduct or incompetence against me. Nay
                more<lb/> than this, after a resolution had been amended to read “for three
                years<lb/> at $1000 per annum,” the resolution as amended was rejected, and<lb/>
                consequently there was properly speaking no <hi rend="underline">minister
                    elected</hi> to <hi rend="underline">offici</hi>-<lb/><hi rend="underline">ate
                    during the latter part of the holydays</hi>, a circumstance which<lb/> evidently
                must be <hi rend="underline">mortifying to one who had</hi> for seven <hi
                    rend="underline">years</hi> faith-<lb/>fully done his duty, and highly
                prejudicial to the interest of the<lb/> congregation, as it was thus in my power,
                    <hi rend="underline">if I had chosen to display</hi><lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">a revengeful feeling, to leave the congregation absolutely
                    unpro</hi>-<lb/><hi rend="underline">vided at the very season of the holy
                    festivals.</hi> After the holydays<lb/> I understand a meeting was held, and an
                election made for one<lb/> year; but by some oversight I was never officially
                notified of this<lb/> fact, and I continued to act under the request made to me by
                the<lb/> Parnass that I might not till a meeting could be held. I com-<lb/>menced at
                that time the publication of the Discourses I had delivered<lb/> at the synagogues
                in this place and <placeName>New York</placeName>, which was followed by the<lb/>
                printing of the entire prayer book according to our <hi rend="underline"
                >Minhag</hi>. These<lb/> labours required a space of about seventeen months for
                their comple<lb/>tion, and I am happy to mention <sic>incidently</sic> that so far
                the usefulness of<lb/> the one work and the necessity of the other have been amply
                proved by<lb/> the support which as been extended from different parts of this &amp;
                other<lb/> countries. But during their progress another election for Hazan
                became<lb/> necessary, and now for the first time since my first election an
                active<lb/> opposition was exhibited, and votes were openly and privately solicited
                for a</p>
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p rend="align(right)">5</p>
            <p>gentleman who had lately arrived from a foreign country. If any influ<lb/>ence was
                used by my friends to induce any one to vote for me, it was<lb/> done without my
                knowledge, and I may here remark that I<lb/> never asked for any man's vote since
                the first day of my being<lb/> called to come here, thinking that in elections,
                particularly to religious<lb/> offices the candidate ought to be removed as far as
                possible from the<lb/> humiliation of receiving a vote as a personal favour which
                might<lb/> otherwise be denied to his merits or qualifications. After a very
                ani-<lb/>mated contest the congregation honoured me for the fourth time with<lb/>
                their suffrage, but now by a decided majority of all the members<lb/> of the
                congregation. But I regret that I am compelled to notice that this<lb/> renewed mark
                of confidence was accompanied by a redirection of<lb/> my salary, when I had every
                right to expect, that you would<lb/> have taken the opportunity when voting me in
                again to <hi rend="underline">increase</hi><lb/> my income, as since my first coming
                here your finances had<lb/> so much improved and the member of
                    <sic>worshippers</sic> so greatly<lb/> increased. Why this reduction was made
                every member knows as<lb/> well as I can tell him, and I do not wish to revive
                unpleasant feelings<lb/> by expressing my own sentiments of a proceeding which
                operated so inju-<lb/>riously upon my interests. Enough the congregation thought fit
                to fix the election<lb/> for <hi rend="underline">three</hi> years at 800 Dollars
                per annum; but when a committee consisting<lb/> of two members notified me of the
                result I answered, that I would accept<lb/> the office but leave the salary to be
                farther adjusted at a future meeting.<lb/> A special meeting was called for general
                purposes, but no quorum was pre<lb/>sent; of course the committee were not able to
                report my answer<lb/> as their doing so would have answered no purpose whatever.
                Before<lb/> now the regular meeting of the congregation came round, a bond was<lb/>
                offered to me for signature (the first that ever had been drawn up<lb/> since my
                holding office) which stipulated that I would serve three<lb/> years at $800 pr
                annum. As I thought that the reduction<lb/> ought not to have been made, and that
                the congregation at a later<lb/> meeting would, as I conceived, see ample reason to
                amend their<lb/> vote, I unhesitatingly refused signing except conditionally for
                one<lb/> year, and the other two to be left for future adjustment. I
                accordingly<lb/> wrote the letter to the Parnass which I believe has been read to
                you, and<lb/> also sent such a bond for his approval, as accorded with my own
                views.</p>
            <pb n="6"/>
            <p>6.</p>
            <p>You will please to bear in mind, that I was engaged in a work of great<lb/> magnitude
                and importance, and which involved an outlay of several<lb/> thousand Dollars, which
                would assuredly have detained me in the<lb/> city for a while year, whether I had
                been in office or not. I stated<lb/> this both in words and in writing to the
                Parnass, but he conceived it<lb/> as his duty to refuse the bond I offered, and to
                insist upon the<lb/> one which had been tendered to me. It was in fact, that I
                should<lb/> resign, or sign a bond which I never could conscientiously assent
                to.<lb/> I therefore refused positively for about four weeks. But then reports<lb/>
                were spread, in fact the Parnass told me so himself, that a meeting<lb/> would be
                called, and that my want of confidence in the congregation<lb/> would doubtfully so
                much operate against me, as to prevent any vote<lb/> in my favour being obtained.
                This however had no <hi rend="underline">influence upon</hi><lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">me</hi>, believing myself in the right; and there was then the
                gentleman who,<lb/> had been the opposing candidate yet in the city, and
                consequently my<lb/> not serving would have left the congregation the <hi
                    rend="underline">choice of a person who</hi><lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">has since been elevated</hi> to the ministry of two respectable
                congregations.<lb/> But appeals were made to my <hi rend="underline">feelings</hi>
                <add>?</add>, whether I could consent to have<lb/> those I had served so long, and
                that besides <del>that</del> there was enter<lb/>tained such a prejudice against the
                above gentleman by many mem<lb/>bers, that they would not vote for him; and thus the
                congregation would<lb/> be placed by my <hi rend="underline">obstinacy</hi>, as it
                was termed, to be without a minister<lb/> and that <hi rend="underline"
                    >disunion</hi> would be the inevitable consequence. Besides this<lb/> I ought to
                trust to the <hi rend="underline">honour</hi> and good will of the congregation
                and<lb/> that doubtlessly at the next meeting ample justice would be done to
                me.<lb/> It may have been a <hi rend="underline">weakness</hi> in me to recede from
                my first purpose,<lb/> yet if I have erred, I erred for the sake of peace. However
                this may be,<lb/> I referred the whole matter to the judgment of my honoured uncle,
                whom you<lb/> nearly all know and respect, and I told him that I would abide by
                his<lb/> advice. So I did; in a few days I got a letter from him advising me to<lb/>
                accede to the demand made upon my forbearance; I did press my<lb/> purpose, I signed
                the bond, and I believe that no one can say that<lb/> either since then or before I
                did otherwise than faithfully discharge<lb/> my duty; not because I had signed a
                bond, but because I wish to<lb/> do what is incumbent on me without faltering or
                evasion. I had<lb/> however good reasons for believing that the congregation would
                have recon-<lb/>sidered their vote, and not regarded the bond in any other light
                than that<lb/> of a peace-offering; but I <hi rend="underline">deceived myself, a
                    bargain it was considered</hi>,<lb/> and so it has remained to this day. I did
                not tell you, how galling</p>
            <pb n="7"/>
            <p rend="align(right)">7</p>
            <p>such a proceeding has been to my feeling, not for the sake of the amount<lb/>
                involved but because it makes by implication the service in the house of God<lb/>
                one of mere trade, “who shall serve the cheapest.” If I might be allowed<lb/> to
                judge, the congregation ought to choose the most competent, and allow<lb/> him a sum
                commensurate with their ability to give, and not according<lb/> to what he might be
                willing to take. I therefore last autumn wrote<lb/> to the congregation stating what
                I expected of them; and I leave it to<lb/> their nonsense of propriety whether my
                views are right or wrong.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">For the future I have to state the following. Experience<lb/> has
                proved that the salary originally promised me is not enough<lb/> for a moderate
                support of a genteel decent appearance. Other<lb/> congregations not more numerous
                or at least not greatly so, and<lb/> not having much more extensive means, give
                their Hazan<lb/> a house and from $1200 to 1800 salary per annum, besides
                perqui<lb/>sites which are larger or smaller according to circumstances.
                More-<lb/>over in every instance elections have been made during good<lb/>
                behaviour. We have all learned from observation, that a small minority can<lb/> at
                any election render the result very uncertain, and besides<lb/> constant reelections
                for short periods weakens the attachment of<lb/> the minister to the congregation.
                He knows not whether all his<lb/> honest services will render him sufficiently
                popular to insure<lb/> him in his situation and every days longer continuance in
                office<lb/> disqualifies him more for other pursuits if he should have<lb/> to
                resort to them if in case he should be discarded. It is no argument<lb/> to say,
                that such a result is unlikely, as it is within the range<lb/> of probability; and
                the constant <sic>harrassing</sic> of the mind does not pro-<lb/>mote either
                contentment or good will to others. Some may say, a<lb/> minister of religion ought
                to be above such thoughts, his mind should<lb/> seek for heavenly support; it is
                true that there is some sinfulness<lb/> mixed up with all feelings of discontent;
                still your minister<lb/> is a man like yourselves, he has feelings like yourselves,
                and<lb/> if he is injured and his mind is distorted he must necessarily feel<lb/>
                discontent even if he tries to overcome it. The very thing that<lb/> he has
                something to forget and to forgive destroys his usefulness<lb/> in part, and greatly
                militates against his inward peace. This<lb/> can be avoided, and it therefore ought
                to be done. An amiable arrange<lb/>ment between us can easily be arrived at, if you
                only endeavour to</p>
            <pb n="8"/>
            <p>8</p>
            <p>convince yourselves, that the Hazan as an individual has some rights<lb/> and
                consequently some little to say about the disposal of his services, no less<lb/>
                than the congregation <del>have</del> as a body <del>and as much as they</del> are
                empowered<lb/> to select one to serve them, in whom they can place confidence</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">In consideration of all this I now notify the congregation,<lb/>
                that I am willing to continue in their services if they allow me<lb/> the yearly
                salary of <hi rend="underline">twelve hundred and fifty dollars</hi>. This
                amount<lb/> never to be reduced whilst I continue in office. And if the
                congre<lb/>gation are at any time willing to increase this amount, that they
                never-<lb/>theless shall not be empowered to demand any other duties than those<lb/>
                hitherto rendered unless by mutual consent. On this condition I must and do
                absolutely insist.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">With regard to the continuance of office I make the following<lb/>
                proposition: The election to be, if the congregation think proper for an
                inde-<lb/>finite period; I not to be allowed to resign without giving <hi
                    rend="underline">six</hi> months<lb/> previous notice, and the congregation to
                be at liberty to discharge me<lb/> at any time if <del>an entire</del> a clear
                majority of all the members either in or<lb/> out of meeting shall send a written
                recognition to that effect either<lb/> to the Parnass and board or to myself, as I
                never wish to hold office<lb/> unless it be by the consent of the majority. I know
                that I subject myself<lb/> more to the control of the congregation than by the mode
                of electing for<lb/> a stated period; but still it will then be out of the power of
                a non-resident<lb/> office-seeker to disturb the harmony of the congregation
                periodically<lb/> at the recurrence of every reelection, by not having any incentive
                or excuse<lb/> to offer himself as a candidate, for though I may succeed in being
                elected<lb/> over such an opponent, it is nevertheless highly unpleasant to be
                under<lb/> the necessity of succeeding to the disappointment of another worthy
                man,<lb/> and such alone it is evident will offer himself to your suffrage.<lb/>
                Besides this, if the election stands till annulled by the congregation,<lb/> &amp;
                as it is barely possible that a removal will be made except for good<lb/> cause: the
                incumbent will and must feel himself more at home,<lb/> and his mind more disposed
                to devote himself to his duties, than<lb/> under the arrangement hitherto pursued,
                where he is liable to<lb/> be sent adrift with or without reason whenever his stated
                period<lb/> elapsed. According to my view of the case therefore, I can see many<lb/>
                cogent reasons in favour of the proposal I now make to the congregation,<lb/> &amp;
                none of any force against it. For it differs in this from an election<lb/> during
                good behaviour, that in the latter case the incumbent can hardly<lb/> be removed
                except with great difficulty, unless at his own option, and in<lb/> accordance with
                my proposition, whenever the majority changes against him.</p>
            <pb n="9"/>
            <p rend="align(right)">9</p>
            <p>If therefore a more worthy man should be within your reach, you can ap-<lb/>point him
                to <sic>supercede</sic> me, no matter when this opportunity may<lb/> offer itself.
                And my giving six months notice before resignation will<lb/> leave you ample time to
                get a fit successor, as in a late instance in<lb/> a neighboring city a new Hazan
                was elected in thirty days after<lb/> the burial of his predecessor.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Another consideration is that up to this period I have been
                four<lb/> times elected, twice when there were opposing candidates; in all I have
                been<lb/> nearly eleven years in your service; of the degree of my fitness all of
                you have had am-<lb/>ple opportunity of judging, and whatever imperfections of
                character,<lb/> qualifications, temper, or behaviour I may be accused of, you have
                long since<lb/> known. No doubt I have given <sic>offence</sic> very often; but I
                may freely say,<lb/> that knowingly and <sic>wilfully</sic> I never offended any
                one. But even if I had<lb/> done so, and that you had collectively and individually
                much to<lb/> forgive: still you ought to reflect that during so long a period<lb/>
                many unpleasant occurrences must have fallen to my lot; and if I have<lb/> been
                found wanting in the hour of trial, I can be accused of no<lb/> greater fault than
                any other of my fellow-creatures. At all<lb/> wants you know me thoroughly just as I
                am; and surely it is high<lb/> time that I be assured whether
                    <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> is to be my permanent<lb/> home or not. I am
                now past thirty three years old, and I ought to<lb/> be no longer
                    <sic>harrassed</sic> about my future prospects; I am content<lb/> with humble
                means, but I should like to hold them not subject<lb/> to the constant caprice or
                change of dispositions to which all public<lb/> assemblies are liable, and none more
                so than religious corporations.<lb/> I will not appeal to your good feelings on
                account of past services;<lb/> as I <del>did</del> have done no more than my duty,
                although I assumed many more<lb/> details than my predecessors did. All I claim
                merit for is an<lb/> honesty of intentions, and a fearlessness in the discharge of
                my duties,<lb/> without regarding my own personal interests. This being the
                case,<lb/> I will leave it to yourselves to determine whether if I am
                re-<lb/>elected, the engagement should not be for an indefinite period,<lb/> subject
                to the limitations specified above.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Other matters, to which I should like to call your attention<lb/> I
                will leave till the regular meeting of the congregation, not wishing<lb/> to mix up
                my own situation with matters not strictly relevant to<lb/> the present subject. In
                conclusion let me again earnestly exhort</p>
            <pb n="10"/>
            <p>10</p>
            <p>you all to judge kindly of my faults, and not to expect perfection from<lb/> one so
                frail as myself. One thing you may believe me, that I have had<lb/> a great deal to
                forgive, and hardly any one can judge of the bitterness<lb/> which has often been
                mingled in my cup since I have lived<lb/> among you. It is in your power, gentlemen,
                to sweeten a little the<lb/> course of life of one to whom sorrow is no stranger. If
                you<lb/> resolve to reelect me in accordance with my just wishes, I<lb/> shall as
                formerly endeavour to devote whatever abilities I have<lb/> received from the
                Creator to the faithful discharge of the duties<lb/> incident to my station. But if
                you decline to reelect me, I shall<lb/> have the consolation that I have staid among
                you as long as it<lb/> was in my power to do so, and that I did not leave my post
                whilst<lb/> I could hold it with honour to myself and usefulness to others.<lb/> I
                certainly am ambitious; but my ambition will be amply satisfied,<lb/> if with a
                moderate income suitable to my calling, I am permitted,<lb/> without fear of a
                malign influence from abroad or at home to sign<lb/> myself, and to be the Hazan of
                the congregation of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>.</p>
