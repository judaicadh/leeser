			<p rend="indent(3)">Dear Sir&#8212;I enclose you a list of the<lb/> subscribers I have been enabled to obtain for the<lb/> Advocate.  While sorry it is so <sic>meagre</sic>&#44; I cannot<lb/> but think that if the paper appears&#44; you will get<lb/> more&#44; and if every congregation in the <placeName>U. S.</placeName> and elsewhere<lb/> will do their share in proportion to one small cong.<lb/> I do not doubt but you will publish at once.<lb/>  I regret the delay in forwarding you the list&#44; sending<lb/> it as i do at the extreme limit of the time advertised<lb/> but the holydays&#44; and after these&#44; my absence twice<lb/> from the city&#44; and then a severe catarrh which<lb/> kept me in the house a <hi rend="underline">good</hi> week&#44; all these did<lb/> their share in delaying.  I would have answered<lb/> before this your last letter&#44; but that I waited to send<lb/> the list&#44; and now it is only necessary for me to refer to<lb/> one portion of it wherein you say my &#8220;cooperation&#8221; in<lb/> any shape will be esteemed&#44; or acceptable&#8212;I have not<lb/> your letter before me&#44; and don&#39;t recollect the exact<lb/> expressive&#44; but if you mean literary cooperation</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>I am sorry to say that I cannot give it so readily as the<lb/> procuring of a few subscribers&#58; First&#44; there remains on &#8220;public<lb/> record&#8221; in the Occident a price &#40;I might say prices for the<lb/> article on the election at <placeName>Phila</placeName> referring to the candidates makes<lb/> it appear that certain testimonials were given me by way of<lb/> favor&#44; else why publish that so &#38; so is a relative&#8212;the other<lb/> a friend&#8212;the other a co&#45;laborateur &#38;c&#8212;but I pass this&#41;  In<lb/> the piece to which I refer&#8212;your review of the Catechism<lb/> I am made to appear in no  very enviable a light&#8212;and<lb/> as unsafe a writer as the &#8220;Israelite&#8221; editors&#8212;moreover<lb/> you accuse me in the same article of &#8220;doing you some wrong&#8221;<lb/> You may smile at my frivolous whims&#8221; but I take a leaf<lb/> out of your book&#44; and have determined I am right&#44; and<lb/> ought not to write for any paper conducted by you&#44; until<lb/> you see fit to find opportunity in the same public manner<lb/> to imply the contrary of the interpretation I and <hi rend="underline">all</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">others</hi> I include all those of your friends<lb/> whom I have had opportunity to see&#44; &#40;and they are many&#44;&#41;<lb/> especially during the last year.  Again&#8212;and this is<lb/> difficulty the second in the way of literary cooperation<lb/> I am not situated now as I was when I was a<lb/> contributor to the Occident.  I have now a family&#44; and<lb/> my time therefore becomes more valuable&#8212;Having had<lb/>&#8212;and still having&#8212;fair offers of remuneration for literary<lb/> labor from other sources&#44; I could not properly become<lb/> a contributor <hi rend="underline">gratis</hi> to the Advocate&#44; tho&#44; I very readily become a</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>subscriber&#44; &#38; will otherwise do what I can for it.  I tell you<lb/> candidly the reason why I did not accept a very fair<lb/> offer from another Jewish paper is that I am bound now<lb/> to employ my time for the best advantage of my family.  If<lb/> however the first difficulty be removed&#44; and the second also<lb/> to some extent&#8212;i.e. You think my pen worth anything<lb/>&#8212;not only for the Advocate&#44; but for the Occident or what<lb/> not&#8212;then I can assure you I would sooner employ it for<lb/> an orthodox paper than another.  I trust I have now<lb/> been explicit enough&#8212;I have desired to be so&#44; as both your<lb/> time &#38; mine is too short for a long correspondence on the<lb/> subject.  Please think the matter over&#59; for it depends<lb/> now entirely &#40;I think&#41; on you as to whether &#8220;bygones shall<lb/> be bygones&#8221; and we work together cheerfully advantageously<lb/> &#38; understandingly&#8212;wiser for what is past.  Should<lb/> you see difficulties insufferable on your side&#44; and we do<lb/> <hi rend="underline">not</hi> work together&#8212;then&#44; after the above frank explanation<lb/> you must  be neither surprised nor amazed if I chance<lb/> some future day to appear in another corner of the field<lb/> you have entered&#8212;working by myself or in company with<lb/> another.  At present however this is not probable.  Do not<lb/> suppose from what I have just written that I wish thereby<lb/> to influence your determination&#44; for you will be greatly<lb/> mistaken&#59; and next please do not think I look to profit<lb/> alone&#8212;for I could always more profitably employ myself in or<lb/> for publications not exclusively Jewish&#8212;Where there are<lb/> few laborers in Anglo&#45;Jewish literature I prefer being</p>
