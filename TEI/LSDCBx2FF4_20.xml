            <p rend="indent(3)">Dear Sir—I enclose you a list of the<lb/> subscribers I have been
                enabled to obtain for the<lb/> Advocate. While sorry it is so <sic>meagre</sic>, I
                cannot<lb/> but think that if the paper appears, you will get<lb/> more, and if
                every congregation in the <placeName>U. S.</placeName> and elsewhere<lb/> will do
                their share in proportion to one small cong.<lb/> I do not doubt but you will
                publish at once.<lb/> I regret the delay in forwarding you the list, sending<lb/> it
                as i do at the extreme limit of the time advertised<lb/> but the holydays, and after
                these, my absence twice<lb/> from the city, and then a severe catarrh which<lb/>
                kept me in the house a <hi rend="underline">good</hi> week, all these did<lb/> their
                share in delaying. I would have answered<lb/> before this your last letter, but that
                I waited to send<lb/> the list, and now it is only necessary for me to refer to<lb/>
                one portion of it wherein you say my “cooperation” in<lb/> any shape will be
                esteemed, or acceptable—I have not<lb/> your letter before me, and don't recollect
                the exact<lb/> expressive, but if you mean literary cooperation</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>I am sorry to say that I cannot give it so readily as the<lb/> procuring of a few
                subscribers: First, there remains on “public<lb/> record” in the Occident a price (I
                might say prices for the<lb/> article on the election at
                    <placeName>Phila</placeName> referring to the candidates makes<lb/> it appear
                that certain testimonials were given me by way of<lb/> favor, else why publish that
                so &amp; so is a relative—the other<lb/> a friend—the other a co-laborateur
                &amp;c—but I pass this) In<lb/> the piece to which I refer—your review of the
                Catechism<lb/> I am made to appear in no very enviable a light—and<lb/> as unsafe a
                writer as the “Israelite” editors—moreover<lb/> you accuse me in the same article of
                “doing you some wrong”<lb/> You may smile at my frivolous whims” but I take a
                leaf<lb/> out of your book, and have determined I am right, and<lb/> ought not to
                write for any paper conducted by you, until<lb/> you see fit to find opportunity in
                the same public manner<lb/> to imply the contrary of the interpretation I and <hi
                    rend="underline">all</hi><lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">others</hi> I include all those of your friends<lb/> whom I
                have had opportunity to see, (and they are many,)<lb/> especially during the last
                year. Again—and this is<lb/> difficulty the second in the way of literary
                cooperation<lb/> I am not situated now as I was when I was a<lb/> contributor to the
                Occident. I have now a family, and<lb/> my time therefore becomes more
                valuable—Having had<lb/>—and still having—fair offers of remuneration for
                literary<lb/> labor from other sources, I could not properly become<lb/> a
                contributor <hi rend="underline">gratis</hi> to the Advocate, tho, I very readily
                become a</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>subscriber, &amp; will otherwise do what I can for it. I tell you<lb/> candidly the
                reason why I did not accept a very fair<lb/> offer from another Jewish paper is that
                I am bound now<lb/> to employ my time for the best advantage of my family. If<lb/>
                however the first difficulty be removed, and the second also<lb/> to some
                extent—i.e. You think my pen worth anything<lb/>—not only for the Advocate, but for
                the Occident or what<lb/> not—then I can assure you I would sooner employ it
                for<lb/> an orthodox paper than another. I trust I have now<lb/> been explicit
                enough—I have desired to be so, as both your<lb/> time &amp; mine is too short for a
                long correspondence on the<lb/> subject. Please think the matter over; for it
                depends<lb/> now entirely (I think) on you as to whether “bygones shall<lb/> be
                bygones” and we work together cheerfully advantageously<lb/> &amp;
                understandingly—wiser for what is past. Should<lb/> you see difficulties
                insufferable on your side, and we do<lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">not</hi> work together—then, after the above frank
                explanation<lb/> you must be neither surprised nor amazed if I chance<lb/> some
                future day to appear in another corner of the field<lb/> you have entered—working by
                myself or in company with<lb/> another. At present however this is not probable. Do
                not<lb/> suppose from what I have just written that I wish thereby<lb/> to influence
                your determination, for you will be greatly<lb/> mistaken; and next please do not
                think I look to profit<lb/> alone—for I could always more profitably employ myself
                in or<lb/> for publications not exclusively Jewish—Where there are<lb/> few laborers
                in Anglo-Jewish literature I prefer being</p>
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>among them, the good natured are at liberty to say because<lb/> I stand less chance
                of being extinguished.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Miss Belisario</persName> is I believe disappointed at
