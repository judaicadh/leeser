				<p rend="align(right)"><hi rend="underline">For the Occident</hi></p>
				<p rend="align(center)"><hi rend="underline">American Liturgy</hi></p>
				<p>When the <persName>Rev. Beth&#45;Din</persName> in his first assembly<lb/> acknowledged the necess<del>ar</del>ity of a general Liturgy in<lb/> <placeName>America</placeName>&#44; and made it so his <sic>probleme</sic> to establish<lb/> the <add>Hebrew</add> according to the <add>Hebrew</add> and vocation of the<lb/> modern time&#59; the <sic>motiv</sic> of this problem was neither<lb/> desire of innovation nor lust of fame nor that giddy<lb/> disposition of reform&#44; but only and simple</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">  1. to bring unity among the members of every<lb/> congregation&#44; as well as among all the American <sic>Sinagogues</sic></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">  2. to <del>remain</del> maintain the word of the Living God<lb/> by <persName>Moses</persName> his <sic>servent</sic> in the free land of <placeName><sic>Amerika</sic></placeName>.<lb/>  The <sic>amiercan</sic> Israelite came from different countries&#44;<lb/> and brought <sic>divers</sic> <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; and this is and must be a<lb/> source of confusion&#44; quarrel and disagreeableness in<lb/> the Synagogue and congregation.  Moreover&#44; the whole<lb/> people of <placeName>Israel</placeName> serves one God&#44; reads and believes one<lb/> Thora&#44; is inspired by one hoping&#44; all together walking<lb/> the same way&#44; in the same manner&#44; leaned upon the<lb/> same support&#44; why should be strangers to one another<lb/> by our garment&#63;  Unity is a feature of Gods divine character&#44;<lb/> unity and peace is his holy will&#44; unity and peace is the<lb/> end that our godly doctrine will aim&#33; Verily I feel<lb/> myself so <sic>strangly</sic> so separated when I enter a Synagoe<lb/> that has another <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; so that I can hardly fancy the<lb/> worshiping people as my <sic>jewish</sic> brethren.  These<lb/> <sic>divers</sic> <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; yea&#44; those differently coloured garments built<lb/> the partition wall among <sic>Portuguise</sic>&#44; <sic>Germain</sic>&#44; Polish<lb/> and Bohemian Jews&#44; and they became strange to one<lb/> another&#44; although we all are descendants of the same<lb/> ancestors&#44; and observe the same <sic>religios</sic> law.  But the<lb/> <sic>Amerikan</sic> Jew shall know and love his brethren&#44; and<lb/> thus that partition wall may fall in suddenly.</p>
			<pb n="1V"/>
				<p>Moreover&#44; it is remarkable for every feeling Israelite&#44;<lb/> that the symptoms of a very ritual <sic>periode</sic> for our Reli&#45;<lb/>gion appear here and there&#44; I speak of fails that lifted<lb/> up their <sic>distorying</sic> hand against the Synagogue.  Behold&#44;<lb/> In one place the <add>Hebrew</add> seemed them to be wrong&#44; <sic>unworthly</sic><lb/> to be said&#44; and without question or scrupulousness&#44; without<lb/> regarding the <add>Hebrew</add> nor having an auhtority to undertake<lb/> a <sic>religios</sic> alteration&#44; they <sic>expeled</sic> the <add>Hebrew</add> and all&#44;<lb/> they are able to reply us&#44; is&#44; we did not like so many praye&#45;<lb/>ers.  In another place people understand not the <sic>hebrew</sic><lb/> language&#44; therefore they want to pray in the <sic>germain</sic> langu.<lb/> again without any authority.  Thus the <add>Hebrew</add> is neglected&#44;<lb/> and is not the <sic>neglegance</sic> of the dogmas the ruin of<lb/> the whole religion&#63;  In other places is it no question<lb/> at all to talk about such a small matter as the Syn.<lb/> is&#44; and <sic>dislikness</sic> on the customs of the old&#44; the ancient<lb/> songs&#44; tans and ceremonies shut the door of the Synag. or<lb/> made the <sic>cosecrated</sic> hall of the Most High to a place of<lb/> tediousness&#44; of profane consideration and reflection&#44; instead<lb/> of the hall of elevation and sublimity to sanctify and adorn<lb/> our soul&#44; we have a house for meeting.  And the<lb/> consequence of those must be the ruin of the whole Religion.<lb/>  Viewing those <sic>motivs</sic> for establishing a general liturgy&#44;<lb/> I expect&#44; that this labour would be &#8220;a felicitous mid&#8221;&#44;<lb/> according to the doctrine of the <add>Hebrew</add> to unite all<lb/> the different parties and satisfying them.  Be not terrified&#44;<lb/> my orthodox brother&#44; for that &#8220;filicitous mid&#8221;&#44; it is evident&#44;<lb/> that the <persName>Rev. B. D.</persName> honoured our Rabbi with this <sic>probleme</sic>&#44;<lb/> and <persName>Rabbi Wise</persName> is&#44; though one of the first philosophical scholars&#44;<lb/> an orthodox <sic>talmudist</sic>&#44; not moving one step from the<lb/> <sic>talmudical</sic> basis&#44; and it is doubtless&#44; that our Rabbi is the grea&#45;<lb/>test <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; who entered <placeName>America</placeName>.  To convince you <del>on</del> concerning<lb/> my words I give you the principles as the basis of the liturgy</p>
			<pb n="2R"/>
				<p>in question <sic>wit</sic> all the <add>&#63;</add> itations<add>&#63;</add> out of the <sic>talmud</sic><lb/> in the original tongue as I heard it by <persName>Rabbi Wise</persName><lb/> when he took occasion in an evening <sic>discours</sic> to speak<lb/> about it&#44; and you&#45;yourselves may judge&#44; but not&#44; I pray<lb/> too hasty&#59; for these words are spoken by a man&#44; who<lb/> is true with God and honest with his law.</p>
				<p><add>Hebrew</add></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">  1. &#8222;To pray thrice <sic>dayly</sic> is a law of <persName>Moses</persName> according to<lb/> &#8222;the opinion of the <add>Hebrew</add> in his <add>Hebrew</add>.  The Rabbi <sic>showd</sic><lb/> there that the <add>Hebrew</add> is against this opinion&#44; but justified<lb/> this principle with that <sic>talmudical</sic> energy and sagacity<lb/> that only may be got by a long study of the <sic>talmud</sic>.<lb/>  I suppose&#44; this principle is doubtless&#44; and write no demon&#8222;<lb/>stration at all&#44; the <add>Hebrew</add> is <sic>enogh</sic> authority for us.<lb/>  This principle teaches sufficiently&#44; that no alteration<lb/> in the service should be undertaken by men ignorant<lb/> in the <sic>scienses</sic> of our Religion&#44; for <add>Hebrew</add>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">  2. <add>Hebrew</add> are not generally obliging&#44; but only local <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> There <sic>shew</sic> the Rabbi by many <sic>talmudical</sic> citations&#44; that<lb/> the <add>Hebrew</add> was not practiced in <add>Hebrew</add> nor that of <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> in <add>Hebrew</add>.  <sic>Concludingly</sic> he said&#58; the <sic>divers</sic> <add>Hebrew</add> now existing<lb/> in <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; which <sic>descendent</sic> of a very ancient time&#44; are the most<lb/> evident demonstration for this principle.  We learn by<lb/> that&#44; that the establishing of a <add>Hebrew</add> to <placeName>America</placeName> independent<lb/> of all other <add>Hebrew</add> that &#8220;<sic>filicitous</sic> mid&#8221; is possible by those&#44;<lb/> who know to distinguish between <add>Hebrew</add> and <add>Hebrew</add>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">  3. &#8220;to pray is the most perfect service&#8221; &#40;<add>Hebrew</add>&#41; <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> &#40;<add>Hebrew</add>&#41; <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> Yet clearer words wrote the <add>Hebrew</add> in his commentary to<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> &#40;<add>Hebrew</add>&#41; <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add></p>
			<pb n="2V"/>
				<p><add>Hebrew</add></p>
				<p>The Rabbi said a multitude of <add>Hebrew</add> to justify the <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; and<lb/> then he expressed his own view in that question&#58;</p>
				<p>The matter is thus &#40;read the Morate Nebuitim of <add>Hebrew</add> and the<lb/> ancient history by <persName>Rothek</persName>&#41; In <placeName>Egypt</placeName> our ancestor learned<lb/> the offering service&#44; yea&#44; they saw even those beasts&#44; God<lb/> commended to sacrifice him&#44; <sic>worshipped</sic> as Deities.  It was<lb/> afterwards impossible for them to search that sublime<lb/> and spiritual Dea&#44; that God would forgive the sin of man<lb/> without offering him any satisfaction&#44; he would hear the<lb/> supplication without <sic>recieving</sic> a present&#44; nor that he should<lb/> please our thanksgiving without gratifying his kindness<lb/> by a corporal sign of our gratitude.  Two ends were aimed<lb/> by the divine <sic>docterine</sic> of the offerings&#58; a. to build a bridge<lb/> between God and man&#44; and b. to bring them away of the <sic>egyptian</sic><lb/> superstition.  In the question&#44; what will be the service after<lb/> rebuilding the sanctuary at <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> I ought to answer<lb/> with <add>Hebrew</add> for there is said by the Prophet <add>Hebrew</add></p>
				<p>But our Thora precepts us our God as the most perfect<lb/> spirit&#44; and the spirit can only be adored by and in the spirit&#44;<lb/> and thus is but the prayer.</p>
				<p>We learn by this princi.&#44; that we have no reason to<lb/> pray for restoring of the offering service&#44; therefore all<lb/> such prayers shall not be taken up in our liturgy.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">  4. &#8222;The reflective effect upon spirit and heart of the praying<lb/> &#8222;subject is the purpose of <del>prayer</del> the prayer&#44; briefly&#44; the<lb/> &#8222;<del>refl</del> effect of it can only be subjective but never objective&#59;<lb/> this is an evident truth both religious and philosophical.<lb/>  That principle is taught by the ancient <add>Hebrew</add> in <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> when there is said <add>Hebrew</add></p>
			<pb n="3R"/>
				<p>will it be of <add>Hebrew</add> like 6&#45;9 <add>Hebrew</add> or <add>Hebrew</add> like 18&#45;11 <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> or according <add>Hebrew</add> idea <add>Hebrew</add> as two words <add>Hebrew</add> this I should like<lb/> to know does the <add>Hebrew</add> of <add>Hebrew</add> requires a <add>Hebrew</add> and a <add>Hebrew</add> in the <add>Hebrew</add> Signifying<lb/> as <add>Hebrew</add> like 14&#45;4 <add>Hebrew</add> and 15&#45;23 <add>Hebrew</add> as<lb/> Truth being not a grammarian he begs therefore instruction from<lb/> <persName>Mr W.</persName> who commenced with <add>Hebrew</add>.</p>
				<p>6<add>&#63;</add> <persName>Mr. W.</persName> find fault with <add>Hebrew</add> Saying &#8220;who have heard of such a<lb/> thing&#8221; why does not <persName>W</persName> reminds a <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> also a <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> &#40;<add>Hebrew</add>&#41; <add>Hebrew</add> also <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> Truth thinks that <add>Hebrew</add> being divided into 3 Classes viz.<lb/> 1st <add>Hebrew</add> to Receipt&#44; or to Delivery 2nd Deliverance including the idea<lb/> the reception of <add>Hebrew</add> in accordance of the two<lb/> words <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; 3 the Kabbalah composes of Mysticke Meta&#45;<lb/>physical with Biblical &#38; Divinity&#39;s explanations&#44; <del>morer</del> moreover<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> explained in a certain volume edited in the year <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> then <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add></p>
				<p>this being also <add>Hebrew</add> which Created the fun of <persName>Mr. W</persName>&#58;/ through the above not intended by Truth as <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; but<lb/> as Stated at the Commencement of Answer b&#44; being the<lb/> latter to show <persName>Mr. W</persName>&#58; what also can be understood by <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> Easy to say Say if you know it&#8221;</p>
			<pb n="3V"/>
				<p><persName>Mr. W.</persName> asking where is Truth&#44; in the idea that all what was<lb/> Said by Truth in untruth&#44; truth is to be found<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> also 8&#45;39 <add>Hebrew</add> moreover<lb/> did not Truth comes forth from <placeName>New York</placeName> and being<lb/> always ready to discuss with <persName>W.</persName> and is not truth in <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> also <add>Hebrew</add>&#8221; but as being no Grammarian has<lb/> not the <add>Hebrew</add> of <add>Hebrew</add> a <add>Hebrew</add> an definite article does<lb/> not the <add>Hebrew</add> Signifying a certainty merely a thing spoken of&#44;<lb/> Surely then it would Signify the Beth&#45;Din here composed<lb/> of <persName>Mr. L</persName>&#58; <persName>W</persName>&#58; <persName>Mule&#45;f</persName>&#58;.... and <add>Hebrew</add> the German Translation<lb/> coming for in the Occidents for some time ago&#44; for what purpose was<lb/> that <add>Hebrew</add> <sic>organised</sic> for <add>Hebrew</add> such things <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> or in regard of <add>Hebrew</add> above mentioned <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add></p>
				<p>if the Beth&#45;Din&#39;s object has been <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> would not this require more individuals enlightened in<lb/> Talmud and Poskim etc. does not our Talmud at the <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> Says <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> would not <hi rend="underline">this</hi> Beth&#45;Din be that <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> but as a grammarian as <persName>Mr. W</persName>&#58; is not that <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> only a &#8220;<add>Hebrew</add>&#8221; according the Grammarians<lb/> as <persName>Mr. W</persName>&#58; is or <sic>predends</sic> to be&#63;</p>
