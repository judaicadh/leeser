            <p>Dear Uncle.</p>
            <p rend="indent(2)">Yours of last week was received, and I was truly <add>?</add>
                to<lb/> hear of your being well. I myself also continue as usual,<lb/> and attend
                punctually to my work, which is progressing, though<lb/> not quite as fast this week
                as the last, owing to various distrac-<lb/>tions, among which chiefly the launch of
                the Pennsylvania,<lb/> which drove all hands away, and so was the cause of loss
                of<lb/> time. To be sure a day or so in general is not much, but at pre-<lb/>sent
                every hour unnecessary wasted is of importance.—I fear<lb/> I shall have to go again
                to <placeName>New York</placeName> at the completion of the<lb/> second volume, as
                the persons who promised to send the dues<lb/> on have failed to do so, and I do not
                know any one altogether<lb/> well calculated to do collecting in the manner it
                should be.<lb/> There are now ready or nearly so,</p>
            <list type="simple">
                <head/>
                <item>40 pages of Vol. II</item>
                <item>40 do - - III | 144 in all; and we are constantly adding,</item>
                <item>12 - of - IV | and I hope confidently that by <date>March</date> the</item>
                <item>12 - of - V | whole will be done, if God willing I live to</item>
                <item>40 - - - VI | long._ If any thing the work is better done</item>
            </list>
            <p>then before, and I will try my best to do justice to the undertaking.<lb/> I have
                paid already on account, up to <date>Feb 7st</date>. 15 printers 540, Paper<lb/>
                maker 285.75 = 825.75; <add>?</add> then printers 95, Paper Makers 95. -/&amp;2<lb/>
                Binder 68. = 1084.50, besides my expenses to <placeName>New York</placeName> and
                other little<lb/> things about 60 Dollars more at a rough guess; so that I have
                paid<lb/> already an amount considerably exceeding $1100.__I had a letter from<lb/>
                <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> this week. My other books, of which I sent 28 copies,
                here<lb/> been all taken and the <sic>nett</sic> proceeds after paying freight,
                    <add>?</add> and commission</p>
            <pb n="1V"/>
            <p>were similar. The Books brought @ 4 doler<add>?</add> per copy and one bound @
                125<lb/> 113.25, and I Ma<add>?</add>ed 95.72%; so that the expenses or so small
                amount<lb/> is almost eighteen Dollars. Of course I made the people there pay
                the<lb/> difference; but still the statement given proves how unpleasant<lb/> a
                thing it is to send books like mine to a place where either a person must lose one
                fifth or charge more than the regular price.<lb/> To be sure it is the same with
                every kind of good, yet people<lb/> mind it more when my stock in trade comes into
                play than upon<lb/> any other occasion._ _I should be glad to hear from
                    <persName>Mrs Cohen</persName>,<lb/> that she had succeeding in obtaining orders
                for me. You may state<lb/> to <persName>Mr. E. P. Cohen</persName> that the number
                of copies now on hand is about<lb/> 150 <del>copies</del>. Several are ordered,
                about 6 copies, some will be sent for to<lb/>
                <placeName>D. C.</placeName> and perhaps other places, though I have some doubts, if
                therefore<lb/> they should be required in <placeName>England</placeName>, it would

                circula-<lb/>ting whilst I have yet enough left to supply all that may be<lb/>

            <p rend="indent(1)">With regard to my election, <persName>Mr. Lyons</persName> has not
                yet ans'rd,<lb/> and his father knows not where he may be here. There is<lb/> but
                little talk, that I hear of, just now on the subject, and as<lb/> congregation meets
                in about 10 weeks it is just as well to let<lb/> the whole matter rest. As I said
                before, if an opposition is talked of<lb/> many may go to the meeting, that
                otherwise would and they do<lb/> so, there is no man in
                    <placeName>America</placeName> that could be elected over me;<lb/> but if the
                knowledge of such a thing does not induce them to <add>?</add> of their<lb/> own
                accord I would consider it beneath my dignity of which you<lb/> know I seldom speak,
                to solicit them to walk across the room,<lb/> Besides I doubt the policy of my
                    <add>?</add> any one. I have hitherto been</p>
            <pb n="2R"/>
            <p>elected by a free choice, and it will hardly do for me to accept as<lb/> a favour
                after 8 years service, what was formerly given here as a<lb/> reward and to please
                themselves than out of favour to me. I<lb/> must take care not to lose the ground,
                one so very advantageous<lb/> with respect to an independent discharge of my duties,
                which I have<lb/> hitherto occupied, and if necessary it would be better to lose the
                office<lb/> than to obtain it upon term alluded to. There is however no<lb/> danger
                that I can see of any being turned out. Probably they<lb/> will reelect me for one
                or two years, as they never will take<lb/> me up as Hazan without specific and that
                a <hi rend="underline">short</hi> period. The<lb/> most they will do is to say
                three, four or five years; beyond this<lb/> however they will not trust me or any
                one else, on principle as<lb/> they call it, assuming that they will not elect a
                person, whom<lb/> it will be requisite perhaps one day to turn out for
                incompetence.<lb/> it is therefore my settled opinion, that altho' I have always
                    declar<add>ed</add><lb/> that I would resign if a majority of the congregation
                desire it,<lb/> they will put my sincerity to the test, and keep the power<lb/> in
                their own hands.__</p>
