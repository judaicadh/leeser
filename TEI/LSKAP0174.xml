				<p>Dear Uncle.</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">Yours of last week was received&#44; and I was truly <add>&#63;</add> to<lb/> hear of your being well.  I myself also continue as usual&#44;<lb/> and attend punctually to my work&#44; which is progressing&#44; though<lb/> not quite as fast this week as the last&#44; owing to various distrac&#45;<lb/>tions&#44; among which chiefly the launch of the Pennsylvania&#44;<lb/> which drove all hands away&#44; and so was the cause of loss of<lb/> time.  To be sure a day or so in general is not much&#44; but at pre&#45;<lb/>sent every hour unnecessary wasted is of importance.&#8212;I fear<lb/> I shall have to go again to <placeName>New York</placeName> at the completion of the<lb/> second volume&#44; as the persons who promised to send the dues<lb/> on have failed to do so&#44; and I do not know any one altogether<lb/> well calculated to do collecting in the manner it should be.<lb/>  There are now ready or nearly so&#44;</p>
				<list type="simple">
				<head></head>
				<item>40 pages of Vol. II</item>
				<item>40 do    &#45;    &#45;   III &#124; 144 in all&#59; and we are constantly adding&#44;</item>
				<item>12  &#45;        of   &#45;   IV &#124; and I hope confidently that by <date>March</date> the</item>
				<item>12 &#45;         of   &#45;    V &#124; whole will be done&#44; if God willing I live to</item>
				<item>40 &#45;          &#45;    &#45;  VI  &#124; long.&#95;  If any thing the work is better done</item>
				</list>
				<p>then before&#44; and I will try my best to do justice to the undertaking.<lb/>  I have paid already on account&#44; up to <date>Feb 7st</date>. 15 printers 540&#44; Paper<lb/> maker 285.75 &#61; 825.75&#59; <add>&#63;</add> then printers 95&#44; Paper Makers 95. &#45;&#47;&#38;2<lb/> Binder 68. &#61; 1084.50&#44; besides my expenses to <placeName>New York</placeName> and other little<lb/> things about 60 Dollars more at a rough guess&#59; so that I have paid<lb/> already an amount considerably exceeding &#36;1100.&#95;&#95;I had a letter from<lb/> <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> this week.  My other books&#44; of which I sent 28 copies&#44; here<lb/> been all taken and the <sic>nett</sic> proceeds after paying freight&#44; <add>&#63;</add> and commission</p>
			<pb n="1V"/>
				<p>were similar.  The Books brought &#64; 4 doler<add>&#63;</add> per copy and one bound &#64; 125<lb/> 113.25&#44; and I Ma<add>&#63;</add>ed 95.72&#37;&#59; so that the expenses or so small amount<lb/> is almost eighteen Dollars.  Of course I made the people there pay the<lb/> difference&#59; but still the statement given proves how unpleasant<lb/> a thing it is to send books like mine to a place where either a person must lose one fifth or charge more than the regular price.<lb/>  To be sure it is the same with every kind of good&#44; yet people<lb/> mind it more when my stock in trade comes into play than upon<lb/> any other occasion.&#95; &#95;I should be glad to hear from <persName>Mrs Cohen</persName>&#44;<lb/> that she had succeeding in obtaining orders for me.  You may state<lb/> to <persName>Mr. E. P. Cohen</persName> that the number of copies now on hand is about<lb/> 150 <del>copies</del>.  Several are ordered&#44; about 6 copies&#44; some will be sent for to<lb/> <placeName>D. C.</placeName> and perhaps other places&#44; though I have some doubts&#44; if therefore<lb/> they should be required in <placeName>England</placeName>&#44; it would please me to send<lb/> them out as soon as possible&#44; in order to have them circula&#45;<lb/>ting whilst I have yet enough left to supply all that may be<lb/> called for.&#95;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">With regard to my election&#44; <persName>Mr. Lyons</persName> has not yet ans&#39;rd&#44;<lb/> and his father knows not where he may be here.  There is<lb/> but little talk&#44; that I hear of&#44; just now on the subject&#44; and as<lb/> congregation meets in about 10 weeks it is just as well to let<lb/> the whole matter rest.  As I said before&#44; if an opposition is talked of<lb/> many may go to the meeting&#44; that otherwise would and they do<lb/> so&#44; there is no man in <placeName>America</placeName> that could be elected over me&#59;<lb/> but if the knowledge of such a thing does not induce them to <add>&#63;</add> of their<lb/> own accord I would consider it beneath my dignity of which you<lb/> know I seldom speak&#44; to solicit them to walk across the room&#44;<lb/> Besides I doubt the policy of my <add>&#63;</add> any one.  I have hitherto been</p>
			<pb n="2R"/>
				<p>elected by a free choice&#44; and it will hardly do for me to accept as<lb/> a favour after 8 years service&#44; what was formerly given here as a<lb/> reward and to please themselves than out of favour to me.  I<lb/> must take care not to lose the ground&#44; one so very advantageous<lb/> with respect to an independent discharge of my duties&#44; which I have<lb/> hitherto occupied&#44; and if necessary it would be better to lose the office<lb/> than to obtain it upon term alluded to.  There is however no<lb/> danger that I can see of any being turned out.  Probably they<lb/> will reelect me for one or two years&#44; as they never will take<lb/> me up as Hazan without specific and that a <hi rend="underline">short</hi> period.  The<lb/> most they will do is to say three&#44; four or five years&#59; beyond this<lb/> however they will not trust me or any one else&#44; on principle as<lb/> they call it&#44; assuming that they will not elect a person&#44; whom<lb/> it will be requisite perhaps one day to turn out for incompetence.<lb/>  it is therefore my settled opinion&#44; that altho&#39; I have always declar<add>ed</add><lb/> that I would resign if a majority of the congregation desire it&#44;<lb/> they will put my sincerity to the test&#44; and keep the power<lb/> in their own hands.&#95;&#95;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Mr. Joseph Moss</persName> has not yet paid me&#44; nor said any thing<lb/> about his obligations and I will <add>&#63;</add> remind him of it for a considerable<lb/> time to come&#44; perhaps never.  If he settles his business well<lb/> he no doubt will pay and if he does not&#44; my asking him will do<lb/> no good.&#8212;</p>
