			<p>With the help of God—<date>Wednesday, 15 Shevat<lb/> 1865</date>,
					<placeName>Savannah</placeName>—</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Peace, blessings, and good fortune to<lb/> God's friend and my own,
				the doer of<lb/> righteousness, his honor, our teacher and<lb/>
				<persName>rabbi Isaac Hzik</persName>, may his light burn brightly.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Your letter of the <date>27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Tebeth</date>
				<del>is at</del><lb/>
				<del>hand,</del> came into my hands, and I rejoiced<lb/> greatly. As to
					<persName>Madam Goldschmid</persName>, I be-<lb/>lieve that if you were as well
				acquainted<lb/> with her character as I, you would never<lb/> have sent her a Bible.
				I marvel that<lb/> she returned the same to you. Nevertheless,<lb/> in order to do
				his bidding I went to her<lb/> home, and this is what she said. She wanted<lb/> a
				small Bible <del>with</del> in large type, but inexpensive<lb/> and then, I believe,
				not to pay for it.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">As to the man whose name is <persName>Bick</persName>,<lb/> that in
				Polish "ox", is like his name<lb/> a goring ox. I have not spoken to him<lb/> in
				many months, and he is now more<lb/> peaceful. During the past month of
					<date>Ab</date>, when he</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
			<p>left for the <placeName>north</placeName>, he told me that he would<lb/> purchase for
				himself a Bible when in your<lb/> town. He returned home and brought
					<del>these</del><lb/> two. He told me that the one for $12 <del>are</del> is to
				be sent to <persName>Mr. Dessauer</persName> in <placeName>Macon</placeName>
				for<lb/> a man whose name is <persName>Krau</persName><del>n</del>. I sent<lb/> them
				to <persName>Mr. Krau</persName> himself, and when I was<lb/> there <persName>Mr.
					Krau</persName> told me that he had not<lb/> ordered any. Nevertheless he kept
				them<lb/> and will pay $12 to <persName>Mr. Dessauer</persName>. Should<lb/> this
				not prove to be the case, let me know<lb/> and I will collect it. (The last
				three<lb/> ordered I have received). As to the second<lb/> copy it is in the
				possession of the Ox. I<lb/> could have sold it long ago. I sent <del>my</del>
				his<lb/> brother to him that he should return the<lb/> Bible. But he replied that if
				you wrote<lb/> to him to hand the Bible over to me, he would<lb/> do so. I would
				advise you to write to<lb/> his brother whose name is <persName>Levy E.
					Bick</persName>.<lb/> For if you wrote to him directly, I believe<lb/> I should
				never hear of it. Or, write to<lb/> me directly. <date>15 Shevat 1865</date></p>
			<pb n="3"/>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I have nothing more that is new;<lb/> except that last
					<date>Tuesday</date> I sent five<lb/> hundred dollars to the people of
					<placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>.<lb/> The money I sent them on last
					<date>Rosh<lb/> Hodesh Ellul</date> did not get to them till<lb/>
				<date>Rosh Hodesh Heshvan</date>. Certainly this<lb/> money just sent will reach
				them by<lb/>
				<date>Passover</date>, and they will enjoy the holiday.<lb/> From <del>his</del>
				your friend and servant who<lb/> is ready to serve <del>him</del> you at all
				times</p>
			<p><persName role="author">Judah Leib Draabin</persName> (?)</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I delivered your letter to <persName>Mr. Eckman</persName>.<lb/> He
				thereupon wanted that I should take in<lb/> my care your books now lying in his
				store.<lb/> I said that if you commissioned me to do,<lb/> I would do it with the
				greatest pleasure.<lb/> This week he told me that he had some money<lb/> to send
				you, and that he would send it to you<lb/> this week. <persName>Mr.
					Einstein</persName> went to <placeName>New York</placeName><lb/> this week. You
				will probably see him in<lb/> your city. <date>15 <sic>Sheval</sic> 1865</date> The
				above <add>?</add></p>
