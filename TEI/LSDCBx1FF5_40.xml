                              <p rend="indent(2)">When I last wrote you I had not yet received<lb/>
                                        our note of <date>31<hi rend="sup">st</hi> October</date>
                                        sent with the Occidents. It is to this that I<lb/> would now
                                        reply. As I before wrote you I shall always be most
                                        ready<lb/> and happy to do anything that my poor ability
                                        will permit so as to<lb/> serve you, but even now I know not
                                        what to do. You have <sic>authorised</sic><lb/> me to
                                        receipt for you, <persName>Mr Joseph</persName> is your

                                        not paid their dues for the A of P. <persName>Mr

                                        Knowing the amounts however I shall try &amp; collect for
                                        you, I<lb/> certainly will endeavor to do my best to get you
                                        new subscribers but I<lb/> think that

                                        pleasure than participating in a movement which<lb/> might

                                        neglected<lb/> subjects of our much prized faith. Anything
                                        that will agitate, arouse<lb/> our community from the

                                        encouraged by every lover of Gods people. My pen<lb/> as if

                                        little promote it. Nevertheless I am prepared to take
                                        part<lb/> in it, to do myself me the pleasure of taking a

                                        not only approve the plan if this were of any

                                        support. God grant<lb/> that the movement (should it indeed
                                        take place) may prove an<lb/> important one, and beneficial
                                        to this and other generations “yet unborn”</p>
