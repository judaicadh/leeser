            <p rend="indent(2)">Methinks I hear you say what<lb/> a miserable correspondent my
                friend has become<lb/> or has the scythe of time <add>?</add> down her<lb/> energies
                or has absence rendered her indifferent<lb/> to her old friends. Neither kind sir,
                but Sickness<lb/> which is beyond our control has made me a delin<lb/>quent in every
                thing but sincerity. I have had many<lb/> of my immediate family confined to the bed
                with sickness<lb/> &amp; have been ill myself &amp; have continued to feel its<lb/>
                debilitating influence. But as <persName>Mrs Chick</persName> says in
                    <persName>Dombey</persName><lb/> “I must make an effort” or my friends will lay
                me<lb/> aside as a thing that has been! In truth I begin to<lb/> think
                    <placeName>Charleston</placeName> does not agree with me spiritually or<lb/>
                bodily in a city ones thoughts turn naturally into the<lb/> channels in which flows
                the thoughts of those around them<lb/> In the country what one hears &amp; sees
                suggests entirely dif<lb/>ferent mediations The universal harmony of nature<lb/>
                stills our fretted passions all the eye rests on speaks<lb/> of infinite wisdom
                &amp; providential care &amp; we feel<lb/> that we can commune with nature &amp;
                with natures<lb/> God with more deep devotion &amp; more pious faith<lb/> my Son has
                been confined for a month &amp; required<lb/> my sole attendance &amp; as
                    <persName>Sarah</persName>
                <add>?</add> was absent I had<lb/> every thing devolving on myself. My daughter
                has<lb/> returned &amp; although not well is much improved &amp;<lb/>
                <persName>Philip</persName> is again at his business. So
                    “<persName>Richard</persName> is himself<lb/> again”</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>you have had my friend &amp; cousin <persName>A Moise</persName> with you he<lb/>
                wrote you were pleased to name me in warm terms<lb/> of friendship for which accept
                my thanks. The approba<lb/>tion of the world pleasant but a thousand times<lb/> more
                so is the commendation of an enlightened &amp; intelligent<lb/> friend — I heard
                with deep regret that my friend <persName>R Hart</persName> had<lb/> been ill,
                tender her my warmest sympathies tell her<lb/> I will write as soon as I can,
                without the form of a reply<lb/> to my last. I often wish I could in more powerful
                language<lb/> than profession, manifest my deep affection for that pure<lb/> &amp;
                meritorious couple! but that could jade makes me<lb/> niggard in all but affection.
                Adversity is a shrewd<lb/> taskmistress, a mighty moral <sic>leveller</sic>, how it
                teaches us to appre-<lb/>ciate kindness &amp; to discover friends where we had
                only<lb/> discerned inferiors! It is the Jewel <sic>shiek</sic> out of the<lb/>
                ugliness &amp; venom of the heart. I have not tasted of<lb/> the draught as <hi
                    rend="underline">deeply</hi> as many more <hi rend="underline">deserving</hi>
                but<lb/> sufficiently so to value those friends who love me<lb/> for the little
                merit I posses &amp; not for the gilding<lb/> that adorns the picture! I am happy in
                writing that<lb/> my sister is enjoying good health after so much of<lb/> bodily
                &amp; mental suffering. She has not yet recovered<lb/> her spirits her deep seated
                affection for our departed<lb/> brother, still renders her indifferent to society in
                fact<lb/> it is so painful for her even to come &amp; pass a day <lb/> with me that
                except in sickness I do not eseach<add>?</add><lb/> it the full check &amp; the
                sparkling eye of early youth do<lb/> not tell their tale of suffering like the worn

                itself although<lb/> regret comes as soon as it is expressed &amp; therefore<lb/> I
                am more cautious in society than in writing. For<lb/> custom has placed a padlock on
                the lips of women<lb/> of which society keeps the key &amp; therefore we must
                not<lb/> say all we feel or think. My family both white &amp;
