                                        period of my life so full of sorrow, would<lb/> not have
                                        passed unnoticed by you; for<lb/> surely in minds correct,

                                        in our nature so wisely and benignly<lb/> mingled therewith
                                        by a Divine Hand. I as-<lb/>sure you my friend I have oft

                                        blessed light<lb/> of Revelation of which she was so devoted

                                        mundane<lb/> rivers force themselves on the mind, all my

                                        Heaven; they are to my mind sacred, the tears<lb/> of

                                        I am brand-<lb/>ed for this by those around me; but they
                                        little<lb/> know my views. My attachment to my beloved<lb/>
                                        parent was of so sacred a nature that all who<lb/> observe
                                        the blissful cord which bound our souls<lb/> can weep with
                                        me, and not <sic>condem</sic> the tears of<lb/> holiness. By

                                        her of the sad event. <persName>Ms Hart</persName> was
                                        very<lb/> fraught and I assure you I highly appreciate<lb/>
                                        it. I hope to be able to write by Uncle if<lb/> not tell her
                                        how much I regret the inability,<lb/>
                                        <del>and</del> but will not keep her long without a<lb/> few
                                        lines. To our friends generally<lb/> I hope you will
                                        introduce Uncle, he<lb/> has several letters to strangers,
                                        one from<lb/> the Counsel, and other merchants also
                                        some<lb/> private letters.—You will greatly oblige<lb/> me
                                        by having a Watch repaired, which I<lb/> shall send by
                                        Uncle, and be kind enough to<lb/> send it by <persName>Sal
                                                  Delo<add>?</add></persName>. I require also a<lb/>
                                        few books a list of which I will and if in<lb/> time to do
                                        so, if not in my next (God willing)<lb/> Grandfather has
                                        been for some days quite un<lb/>well, expects to be operated
                                        on in a few<lb/> days; Heaven grant him success; he seems
                                        very<lb/> sanguine and needful<add>?</add> about it.
                                        Remember me<lb/> to all friends and accept the continued
                                        regard of yours</p>
