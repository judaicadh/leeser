            <p rend="indent(1)">ADMISSION OF JEWS TO PARLIAMENT.—In<lb/> the House of Commons on the
                    <date>15th</date> ult. <persName>Lord John<lb/> Russell</persName> introduced
                the anticipated motion for the re-<lb/>moval of the civil and political disabilities
                of Jewish<lb/> subjects, with a view to such an amendment of the<lb/> oath which is
                required to be taken by members of<lb/> the House, that it may not exclude
                    <persName>Mr. Rothschild</persName>,<lb/> who was chosen at the late election as
                a member for<lb/> one of the districts of the city of <placeName>London</placeName>.
                This su-<lb/>ject has been earnestly discussed in some of the Brit-<lb/>ish reviews,
                and it is in various points of view one of<lb/> considerable interest. We therefore
                copy the speech<lb/> of <persName>Lord John Russell</persName> on introducing his
                motion, in<lb/> which he has treated the subject with great ability<lb/> and skill.
                We copy the speech from the <placeName>London</placeName><lb/> Times:—</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">REMOVAL OF JEWISH DISABILITIES.—<persName>Lord<lb/> J.
                    Russell</persName>.—As I understand that my honorable<lb/>friend the member for
                the University of <placeName>Oxford</placeName> means<lb/> to oppose the motion for
                the house resolving itself<lb/> into a committee of the whole house to consider
                the<lb/> disabilities at present affecting Her Majesty's Jewish<lb/> subjects, I
                feel myself compelled, before making that<lb/> motion, to state to the house the
                general grounds on<lb/> which I intend to rest it. I am, at the same time,<lb/>
                given to understand by my honorable friend, that if<lb/> a majority of the house
                should agree to go into com-<lb/>mittee on the subject, he does not mean to carry
                his<lb/> opposition to the point of refusing to consent to the<lb/> committee
                adopting the resolution which is necessa-<lb/>ry to the introduction of a bill. That
                being the case,<lb/> it will be as convenient to the house to take the
                dis-<lb/>cussion at this stage as to reserve it, as was done on<lb/> former
                occasions, till the house had resolved itself<lb/> into committee. In bringing
                forward this subject I<lb/> feel that I cannot avail myself of many of the
                topics<lb/> which those who formerly proposed the removal of<lb/> disabilities on
                account of religious tenets were able<lb/> to appeal to for the purpose of inducing
                this house to<lb/> comply with their propositions. I cannot say—as I<lb/> did in
                proposing the repeal of the Test and Corpora-<lb/>tion Acts—"Here are some three
                millions of Her<lb/> Majesty's subjects, engaged in all the pursuits of
                in-<lb/>dustry in your cities and towns, forming a most im-<lb/>portant portion of
                the community, and distinguished<lb/> for their loyalty to the house of
                    <placeName>Hanover</placeName>, undevia-<lb/>tingly maintained ever since that
                illustrious family<lb/> was seated on the throne of these realms." I can-<lb/>not,
                like the great orator who introduced the ques-<lb/>tion of Catholic disabilities,
                refer to the state of a<lb/> neighboring country as a potent motive to induce
                the<lb/> house to remove the cause of discontent and dissat-<lb/>isfaction. I cannot
                speak, as he did, of the indigna-<lb/>tion felt by a whole people at the deprivation
                of their<lb/> rights; nor can I point to the dangers which would<lb/> menace the
                peace and welfare of the country from<lb/> refusing the claim to relief. I can
                employ none of<lb/> those arguments in favor of my proposition. I feel<lb/> that
                this is a question which does not affect a very<lb/> large portion of the people of
                this country, and does<lb/> not involve in its acceptance or rejection the
                momen-<lb/>tous consequences which were justly apprehended on<lb/> former occasions.
                I am prepared to argue this ques-<lb/>tion as one of principle, not of political
                expediency—<lb/> as a question involving, indeed, the political liberties<lb/> of
                the country, but involving them only as they con-<lb/>ern 30,000 or 40,000 people,
                members of a commu-<lb/>nity which is not disposed, nor indeed able, if it<lb/> were
                disposed, to excite clamor and tumult, to agi-<lb/>tate the country by means of
                public meetings, or to<lb/> produce a social convulsion, if its demands should<lb/>
                not be conceded. But, although I am unable to ap-<lb/>peal to the topics to which I
                have referred, I must,<lb/> nevertheless, take the liberty of informing the
                house<lb/> that there may be danger, not affecting the public<lb/> tranquility
                indeed, but affecting the character and<lb/> dignity of the Legislature, if the
                claims of our Jew-<lb/>ish fellow subjects continue longer to be refused. It<lb/>
                may then be said that the Legislature is unwilling to<lb/> concede the claim of
                religious liberty, that Parlia-<lb/>ment has never adopted those just principles of
                equal-<lb/>ity which ought to be applied to all the subjects of<lb/> Her Majesty;
                but that when the question regarded<lb/> vast bodies of men, important from their
                numbers<lb/> and wealth, or threatening from their dissatisfaction<lb/> and
                discontent, the Legislature yielded a reluctant<lb/> assent to their claims for the
                sake of immediate<lb/> peace; and that when an opportunity presented itself<lb/> of
                doing an act of justice without any danger, and<lb/> without inconvenience to public
                interests, the Par-<lb/>liament acted on the principle of religious
                perse-<lb/>cution, and was determined to show the world<lb/> that it was not from
                any willingness to adopt en-<lb/>larged and liberal principles as the rule of
                its<lb/> conduct that it had on former occasions yield-<lb/>ed to the petitions of
                its fellow subjects.—<lb/> (Cheers.) I venture to say, that if such an opinion<lb/>
                as that should become prevalent, it must have a<lb/> very injurious effect on the
                character of this<lb/> house. There is, as I have before said, but little<lb/> risk
                of danger to the public peace involved in the re-<lb/>jection or adoption of my
                proposition. One danger<lb/> was pointed out as likely to arise from its
                adoption,<lb/> many years ago, by my hon. friend who intends to<lb/> oppose me on
                the present occasion, but he is not in a<lb/> position to repeat his warning now. In
                    <date>1830</date> my<lb/> hon. friend took upon himself the character of a<lb/>
                prophet, and said "You may depend upon it that if<lb/> you admit the Jews to civil
                offices and seats in Par-<lb/>liament, it will follow that in less than seven
                years<lb/> you will have a reform of Parliament." ("Hear,"<lb/> and laughter.) But,
                without the admission of Jews<lb/> to Parliament, as the precursor of the so much
                dread-<lb/>ed event, within two years of the time when my<lb/> hon. friend used
                those words I have referred to the<lb/> reform of Parliament was effected. (Hear,
                hear.)<lb/> Therefore, there is, at least, one danger which it<lb/> will be
                unnecessary to take into consideration in dis-<lb/>cussing this question. ("Hear,"
                and laughter.) I<lb/> place the question upon this simple, but I think,<lb/> solid
                ground—that every Englishman is entitled to<lb/> the honors and advantages which the
                British consti-<lb/>tution gives him. (Cheers.) I state further, that<lb/> religious
                opinion of itself ought to be no disqualifica-<lb/>tion for the enjoyment of those
                rights. (Renewed<lb/> cheers.) I found myself on a declaration in one of<lb/> the
                statutes of the law of <placeName>England</placeName>—"It is the birth-<lb/>right of
                the people to enjoy the privileges common to<lb/> all." I found myself on a
                declaration made in the<lb/> House of Lords during the discussions on the
                Con-<lb/>formity Bill,—"The Lords think that an English-<lb/>man cannot be reduced
                to a more unhappy condition<lb/> than to be put by law under an incapacity of
                serving<lb/> his prince and country; and therefore nothing but a<lb/> crime of the
                most detestable nature ought to put him<lb/> under such a disability." I say, then,
                that on this<lb/> ground, unless something shall be proved to disqual-<lb/>ify Jews,
                they stand in the position of persons born<lb/> in this country, bearing all the
                burdens which are<lb/> imposed on them, and ready to serve their prince<lb/> and
                their country in any capacity in which they may<lb/> be called upon, and that,
                therefore, they are entitled<lb/> to all the rights and privileges enjoyed by their
                fel-<lb/>low-subjects. (Cheers.) I state this with confi-<lb/>dence, and I will not
                attempt to ask your favor by<lb/> anything which I might urge in behalf of the
                merits<lb/> of the Jews. I think this is not a matter of favor to-<lb/>ward the
                Jews, but that, unless some strong ground<lb/> of disqualification be proved against
                them, it is a<lb/> matter of right. (Cheers.) I, therefore, will not<lb/> urge that
                even those who have opposed the claims of<lb/> the Jews have admitted their
                peaceable conduct and<lb/> their moral character as subjects—that they are
                gov-<lb/>erned by that moral law which is adopted by and is<lb/> binding on us—that
                there are among them many per-<lb/>sons distinguished for eminent talents—that in
                the<lb/> offices of which they have been admitted they have</p>
