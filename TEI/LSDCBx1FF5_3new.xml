			<p><addressee>Reverend Isaac Leeser</addressee></p>
		  <p rend="indent(2)">Dear Sir</p>
		  <p rend="indent(3)">I received your very kind letter of <date>10 Dec</date><lb/> &amp; am quite ashamed of not having acknowledged it before&#44; but<lb/> the enclosed reflections must impart plead my excuse if they meet<lb/> your approbation &amp; at the time I received it I was also engaged in<lb/> writing to a clergyman who after a lapse of five years had the Grace<lb/> to answer a letter which I write to him on subjects connected with<lb/> our Holy religion.  however I delivered your enclosed letter to our<lb/> friend <persName>Mr I Lindo</persName> &amp; called on <persName>Mrs Joel</persName> who said she had already<lb/> forwarded to you the statement you required.  I also called on the<lb/> Publisher of the Jewish Chronicle who in as much surprised that<lb/> there should have been any irregularity in the delivery of the numbers<lb/> which he say were regularly posted every week he gave me the<lb/> enclosed order for a set of the Jewish Miscellany which he request<lb/> you to send at your earliest convenience &amp; he will pay the cost to <persName>Mrs<lb/> Joel</persName> or elsewhere as you may direct  I have received the prospectus<lb/> of the works you propose engaging in &amp; should feel very happy if<lb/> I could contribute to your success&#44; but I have already told you<lb/> what very little influence I possess in the nation &amp; what a reserved<lb/> life I lead  I fear any application on my part for support to<lb/> your exertion <del>it</del> would be ineffectual &amp; be considered as a rem[&#63;]<lb/> instance of my assurance  put me down as a subscriber<lb/> to the Jewish advocate&#8211;</p>

		<pb n="2"/>
		
			<p>I am glad you received the apocryphal New Testament I presume<lb/> <persName>Dr Raphael</persName> is correct in stating that the Publisher [&#63;] was prosecuted<lb/> but I do not think it could have been for this publication you will see<lb/> that several of the books have been translated &amp; published in the works<lb/> of learned men here.  but I remember seeing in his shop windows in<lb/> fleet street an atrocious caricature of the almighty in which he was<lb/> depicted with all the figurative descriptions used in the Bible &amp;<lb/> at the foot &#34;Christians Here is your God as by Law established&#34;</p>
			<p>I believe few persons had the audacity to enter the shop &amp; purchase it<lb/> I had not.  I see the result of your interview with <persName>Mr Knit</persName> his<lb/> reply that the synod had resolved to reply only to a Jewish assembly<lb/> of [&#63;] &amp; not to an individual is very significant.  however the ques<lb/>tion how my letter came to the hands of the publisher of the asmonean<lb/> will soon be solved for I see by the number for the week ending 20<lb/> decr &#40;which the publisher politely sent me&#41; that my letter was<lb/> sent to him by a Gentleman connected with the Synod accompanied<lb/> by an answer which on account of the [&#63;] of the <sic>stile</sic> he did not<lb/> publish &amp; he proposed doing up shortly with a running commentary</p>
		  <p rend="indent(1)">If the answer is signed by the writer &amp; requires any other answer<lb/> than the commentary I shall perhaps take notice of it&#44; but not if it<lb/> is anonymous perhaps you will say that my writings which you have<lb/> though worthy of a place in your interesting periodical has also been<lb/> anonymous by they have not been written to or at anybody but your<lb/> self &amp; to any inquirers you could always supply the name</p>
			<p>I read with much pleasure your review of <persName>Dr Raphel&#39;s</persName> lectures</p>
