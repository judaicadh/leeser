                                                  <date>January 28, 1851</date>.</p>
                              <p>Very honored <addressee>Mr. Leeser</addressee>:</p>
                              <p rend="indent(1)">I should gladly have written to you before this,
                                        but, though it<lb/> may sound very strange to you, I had not
                                        time. For the last 6 or 7 weeks,<lb/> whenever I had a
                                        moment from my duties, I had to sit at the sickbed of<lb/>
                                        my children. Now, thank God, they are improved and out of
                                        danger.<lb/> Naturally, I was hindered by this in doing
                                        anything for you. But I<lb/> hope to catch up. I have put in
                                        a notice in both the newspapers of this<lb/> city and handed
                                        over several copies of the “Occident” to the respective<lb/>
                                        editors of these newspapers so that they might be in the
                                        position to give<lb/> the public their judgment on it. Along
                                        with this letter, or perhaps sev-<lb/>eral days later, you
                                        will receive both newspapers. Whether this will<lb/> do some
                                        good or not, time will tell. I hope that it will not have
                                        been<lb/> in vain. <persName>Mr. Hart</persName> told me
                                        that he owes you for only 8 years of the Oc-<lb/>cident, and
                                        herewith sends $24.75. For the other books, he paid
                                        your<lb/> former agent, <persName>Louis Allen</persName>,
                                        since <sic>thelatter</sic> charged it to him in a bill.<lb/>
                                        Please write to me in your next letter whether this is
                                        correct. I have<lb/> not yet had time to collect from the
                                        others. <persName>Tendler</persName> wants to pay you
                                        for<lb/> only one year, namely the last one, but not for the
                                        two years mentioned<lb/> in your letter. Perhaps
                                                  <persName>Mr. Tendler</persName>, who is at
                                                  <sic>themoment</sic> in
                                                  <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>,<lb/> and who

                                        He<lb/> wants you to send him the “Occident” as well as the
                                        “Advocate,” if the lat-<lb/>ter should see the light of day,
                                        on his own name to <placeName>San Francisco</placeName>
                                        each<lb/> month. I shall write to you again in the course of
                                        the coming month, if<lb/> possible also the subscription
                                        list and perhaps also send you money. Per-<lb/>haps you have
                                        paid attention to the notice in the “Asmonean” about
                                                  <persName>Henry</persName>.<lb/> I would have
                                        written about it but thought that I ought to wait first
                                        for<lb/> the promised exposition of the matter, and then to
                                        reveal the true state<lb/> of affairs through the letters in
                                        his own hand as proof. But this much<lb/> I want to place at
                                        your disposal, that everything which the article in<lb/> the
                                        “Occident” contains is true, irrefutably true, except his

                                        first rung among Jewish congregations as soon<lb/> as you
                                        cease to be its minister.</p>
                              <p rend="indent(1)">Now one more thing—in the synagogue, there are
                                        still lying about<lb/> books and other effects which I
                                        bought for the congregational school be-<lb/>fore my
                                        departure from <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>.
                                                  <persName>Bernal</persName> wrote about this to

                                                  <persName>Hart</persName>, but the congregation
                                        did not deliver the books to <persName>Bernal</persName>.
                                        I<lb/> am now commissioned to do the best possible with it
                                        for the congregation.<lb/> Don't you think that upon your
                                        request, <persName>Mr. Bitel</persName> will give us
                                        writing<lb/> paper in exchange for the unused books and
                                        effects? And for his share,</p>

                              <p><persName>Mr. Hart</persName> several of your prayer books? These
                                        two articles would be as<lb/> welcome as money to myself and
                                        the congregation. Have the goodness to do<lb/> something in
                                        this matter, and to let me know about it.</p>
