			<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>Louisville&#44; Ky.</placeName>&#44; <date>January 28&#44; 1851</date>.</p>
			<p>Very honored <addressee>Mr. Leeser</addressee>&#58;</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I should gladly have written to you before this&#44; but&#44; though it<lb/> may sound very strange to you&#44; I had not time. For the last 6 or 7 weeks&#44;<lb/> whenever I had a moment from my duties&#44; I had to sit at the sickbed of<lb/> my children. Now&#44; thank God&#44; they are improved and out of danger.<lb/> Naturally&#44; I was hindered by this in doing anything for you. But I<lb/> hope to catch up. I have put in a notice in both the newspapers of this<lb/> city and handed over several copies of the &#8220;Occident&#8221; to the respective<lb/> editors of these newspapers so that they might be in the position to give<lb/> the public their judgment on it. Along with this letter&#44; or perhaps sev&#45;<lb/>eral days later&#44; you will receive both newspapers. Whether this will<lb/> do some good or not&#44; time will tell. I hope that it will not have been<lb/> in vain. <persName>Mr. Hart</persName> told me that he owes you for only 8 years of the Oc&#45;<lb/>cident&#44; and herewith sends &#36;24.75. For the other books&#44; he paid your<lb/> former agent&#44; <persName>Louis Allen</persName>&#44; since <sic>thelatter</sic> charged it to him in a bill.<lb/> Please write to me in your next letter whether this is correct. I have<lb/> not yet had time to collect from the others. <persName>Tendler</persName> wants to pay you for<lb/> only one year&#44; namely the last one&#44; but not for the two years mentioned<lb/> in your letter. Perhaps <persName>Mr. Tendler</persName>&#44; who is at <sic>themoment</sic> in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>&#44;<lb/> and who is about to take a journey to <placeName>California</placeName>&#44; will visit you. He<lb/> wants you to send him the &#8220;Occident&#8221; as well as the &#8220;Advocate&#44;&#8221; if the lat&#45;<lb/>ter should see the light of day&#44; on his own name to <placeName>San Francisco</placeName> each<lb/> month. I shall write to you again in the course of the coming month&#44; if<lb/> possible also the subscription list and perhaps also send you money. Per&#45;<lb/>haps you have paid attention to the notice in the &#8220;Asmonean&#8221; about <persName>Henry</persName>.<lb/> I would have written about it but thought that I ought to wait first for<lb/> the promised exposition of the matter&#44; and then to reveal the true state<lb/> of affairs through the letters in his own hand as proof. But this much<lb/> I want to place at your disposal&#44; that everything which the article in<lb/> the &#8220;Occident&#8221; contains is true&#44; irrefutably true&#44; except his removal.</p>
		<pb n="2"/>
			<p>He had every intention to move here&#59; his books were here already&#44; his<lb/> friends.<sic>tried</sic> to rent a house for him&#44; a petition laid before the <add>&#63;</add><lb/> <sic>congreggtion</sic> written and signed in his own hand&#44; in which he asked the<lb/> synagogue room for a school. The majority&#44; however&#44; voted for <persName>Bernal</persName>.<lb/> I have letters in my possession which&#44; when published&#44; will certainly<lb/> not be in his favor&#44; and will show his petty and unworthy intentions.<lb/> I wish you had other correspondents here. These might have written to<lb/> you occasionally about me&#44; something that would be to my advantage. I<lb/> believe that at the present moment I have more friends here than upon my<lb/> arrival&#44; and that my position in general is on a stronger footing than<lb/> in previous years. Last week I had a wedding&#44; 2 sisters&#44; on which oc&#45;<lb/>casion the synagogue was filled with Jews and non Jews. And my speech<lb/> &#40;text&#45;Would that your heart were thus within you all the <sic>daysso</sic> that<lb/> all will go well with you forever&#41; received general applause. I can<lb/> flatter myself that the same thing was the case with a speech on the<lb/> <date>20th of Shebat</date>&#44; at <sic>thegrave</sic> of a dead member of this community&#44; By the<lb/> name of <persName>Isaac Stern</persName>.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">Have the goodness again to write to me about your own prospects in<lb/> your next letter&#44; whether the clouds which darken your immediate future<lb/> are not beginning to become lighter&#44; and especially whether your congre&#45;<lb/>gation has not yet arrived at the conviction to which it must come&#44; that<lb/> it will cease to occupy the first rung among Jewish congregations as soon<lb/> as you cease to be its minister.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">Now one more thing&#8212;in the synagogue&#44; there are still lying about<lb/> books and other effects which I bought for the congregational school be&#45;<lb/>fore my departure from <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>. <persName>Bernal</persName> wrote about this to <persName><sic>Mr.Bitel</sic></persName><lb/> and <persName>Hart</persName>&#44; but the congregation did not deliver the books to <persName>Bernal</persName>. I<lb/> am now commissioned to do the best possible with it for the congregation.<lb/> Don&#39;t you think that upon your request&#44; <persName>Mr. Bitel</persName> will give us writing<lb/> paper in exchange for the unused books and effects&#63; And for his share&#44;</p>
		<pb n="3"/>
			<p><persName>Mr. Hart</persName> several of your prayer books&#63; These two articles would be as<lb/> welcome as money to myself and the congregation. Have the goodness to do<lb/> something in this matter&#44; and to let me know about it.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">My wife&#44; who 5 weeks ago&#44; presented me with a little girl&#44; greets you<lb/> most respectfully. In a few weeks you will <sic>here</sic> more from</p>
          <p rend="indent(6)">Your devoted servant&#44;</p>
