            <p>Dear Sir/</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I have been so much engaged since<lb/> the rect of yours dated
                        <date>9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Feby</date> that I could not find<lb/> time to
                reply thereto <sic>untill</sic> this moment—The<lb/> commencement of your Letter
                gave me much pain<lb/> as it was far, very far from my thoughts when I wrote<lb/> to
                you concerning the B. H. B Society—to wound your<lb/> feelings in the slightest
                degree—all that I wished<lb/> to know from you was whether the article that you<lb/>
                inserted in your Periodical was an official one—and<lb/> whether the party who sent
                it had omitted part of the<lb/> minutes ignorantly which would have been likely
                enough<lb/> if it had been conveyed to you from a private source<lb/> Rest assured
                my dear sir I have too high an opinion of<lb/> you to suppose for one moment that
                you yourself (to use<lb/> your own words) would be guilty of such meanness as<lb/>
                to insert only a part of the minutes—</p>
            <p>I will as briefly as possible give you my reasons for asking<lb/> you for the
                information—when the B. H. B. Society was<lb/> first instituted, a resolution was
                passed (at least so I am<lb/> informed) electing all the <add>חזנים</add> in
                    <placeName>New York</placeName> Honorary Members<lb/> and Letters were sent
                accordingly informing us of such<lb/> resolution &amp;c &amp;c The one I received
                was “word for word” the<lb/> same as yours—I felt that an honorary membership<lb/>
                would not be of any value to a charitable Institution<lb/> and in my reply to their
                Letter I told them so at the same<lb/> time requesting them to admit me as a pay
                member. I received <del>another</del> a Letter in answer accepting me as a<lb/>
                subscriber with sundry compliments &amp;c &amp;c—<lb/> Now my dear sir judge my
                surprise on reading the<lb/> extract of the minutes in the “Occident”</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>and I ask you whether it is not an insult<lb/> to my Brother <add>חזנים</add> as well
                as to myself<lb/> to see a partial statement of the minutes<lb/> published making it
                appear (if officially sent)<lb/> that <persName>Mr Isaacs</persName> is the only
                    <add>חזן</add> that <del>that</del> the<lb/> B. H. B. Society think worthy of
                their notice—<lb/> for my own part I read it in this way that it<lb/> was another
                link added to the chain of “quack<lb/> advertisements” that you had innocently
                inserted<lb/> in your paper to land a particular person and<lb/> his patrons—or
                maybe it was or is intended to be<lb/> the commencement of a new series—</p>
            <p>It is supposed that either <persName>Mr Godfrey</persName> or <persName>Mr
                    Isaacs</persName><lb/> or both together sent you the particulars—whoever<lb/>
                the party may be they have incurred the censure<lb/> of the committee in consequence
                at least so <del>one</del> I am<lb/> informed by one of the managers—</p>
            <p>You will probably receive a new notice “from the Board<lb/> what it may be I know not
                there is however only one<lb/> course open to them that will satisfy me—and
                that<lb/> is to publish in your work. That the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> article
                sent<lb/> was without the sanction of their Board—that it<lb/> was a false statement
                giving the reason why &amp;c</p>
            <p>You entirely mistake me if you think I wish to<lb/> appear in print in this matter in
