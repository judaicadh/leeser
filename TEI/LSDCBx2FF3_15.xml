				<p><addressee>Rev. Isaac Leeser</addressee>&#44; <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(4)">Dear Sir&#47;  It was not<lb/> forgetfulness or neglect that has hitherto prevented me from<lb/> answering your kind letter of <date>February 12</date> last&#44; but circum&#45;<lb/>stances alone&#44; the explanations of which&#44; here following&#44; must<lb/> be ample apology for me.  When I received your letter&#44; you<lb/> were on your way to <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName>&#44; wherefore I had to await for<lb/> your return.  Then I read in the Occident that <persName>Rev. Mr Jacobs</persName><lb/> had sent you a reply to my last letter in your periodical&#44; when<lb/> I again thought to await its publication.  Afterwards I was<lb/> so busily engaged in the most various occupations and duties&#44;<lb/> that&#44; besides having been unwell for the last 3 months&#44; I could<lb/> barely find time to write the most urgent private letters.  In<lb/> the meanwhile&#44; when I intended again to do my duty&#44; and reply<lb/> to yours above mentioned&#44; I heard that <persName>Rev. Mr Jacobs</persName> had<lb/> sent you a communication&#8212;like that to the Israelite&#8212;condemnatory<lb/> of my reading a Psalm in the church&#44; in consequence of<lb/> which I thought it proper again to defer my reply&#44; with the<lb/> view of avoiding even the least appearance of my intention<lb/> to bias you by a private letter.  Now&#44; as <persName>Mr J.&#39;s</persName> letter must<lb/> be <del>publish</del> in the Occident&#44; so that I can no longer exercise<lb/> any influence&#44; I may <del>say</del> after all&#44; write with all impunity.<lb/>  This much also I may add&#44; with regard to this affair&#44; that I hope&#44;<lb/> as a matter of simple justice&#44; you have in your &#8220;<hi rend="underline">Note</hi>&#8221; not al&#45;<lb/>together disregarded my explanation in the Israelite&#44; nor forgotten<lb/> that whatever <persName>Mr J.</persName> now writes about me&#44; is tinctured with a good</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>deal of animosity&#44; vindictiveness and hatred.  And here let me relate to you<lb/> the whole history of <persName>Mr J.&#39;s</persName> relation to me&#44; which I have hitherto from delicacy<lb/> withheld from you.  When <persName>Mr. J.</persName> arrived here&#44; I immediately called upon him&#44; as<lb/> common courtesy demands it&#44; and told him at once&#58; Let us be friends&#44; al&#45;<lb/>though our religious views diverge&#59; you preach orthodoxy and I&#44; reform&#44;<lb/> don&#39;t you attack my congregation&#44; as I intend never to make my<lb/> reference to yours&#59; especially let us meet each other in society with<lb/> that <sic>collegial</sic> friendship&#44; as ought ever exist between gentlemen&#59; such a<lb/> cause will have a good impression not only upon the Jews&#44; but upon the<lb/> society at large&#44; and is calculated to raise the Jewish character in the<lb/> eyes of the Public.  <persName>Mr J.</persName> made all the promises  I could expect.  But<lb/> already on the following <date>Sabbath</date>&#44; he <hi rend="underline">directly</hi> attacked us in the most<lb/> venomous manner&#59; of course&#44; at that time&#44; when the &#8220;honeymoon&#8221; was<lb/> not yet over&#44; he could do such things with impunity&#59; you must know<lb/> this yourself&#44; for at the same time he treated you in the same arrog&#45;<lb/>ant manner.  He neither returned my visit&#44; nor that of many of my<lb/> conregators who had likewise called upon him.  Yet&#44; I cared not about<lb/> all that&#59; I continued to treat him with the most marked courtesy.<lb/>  During the summer of <date>1853</date> he came to me to borrow a book&#44; the<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; but told me <hi rend="underline">in my room</hi>&#44; that I should not look upon<lb/> his coming as a visit&#44; as he had merely come to borrow that book.  My<lb/> answer was&#58; My library is at all times at your disposal.  I even had<lb/> him invited to my wedding&#59; he neither came&#44; nor acknowledged the in&#45;<lb/>vitation&#44; nor ever congratulated me.  yet&#44; I continued to treat him with <lb/>courtesy&#44; until in <date>November 54</date> he charged me&#44; in a conversation we had<lb/> near the Post&#45;Office with having perverted<add>&#63;</add> a passage in the Shulchan A&#45;<lb/>such&#44; when I coolly answered&#44; &#8220;he only retorted in this manner&#44; because<lb/> he felt that I had proven his inconsistency&#44;&#8221; upon which he flatly called<lb/> me &#8220;ignorant&#59;&#8221; when I told him&#44; that it was below my dignity to answer</p>

				<p>to such an important speech.  The breach was thus made.  Soon afterwards<lb/> the presentation to <persName>Mr Valentine</persName> &#40;Occident viii&#44; 37&#41; took place&#44; when it so happened<lb/> that I attended&#44; for the first and only time&#8212;the meeting of the Chebrah preceding<lb/> the presentation.  During that meeting&#44; <persName>Mr J.</persName> insulted me 5 times&#44; in the most<lb/> outrageous manner&#44; while I merely smiled.  He had then forgotten that<lb/> his star had greatly waned.  <persName>Mr. V.</persName> called him thrice to order&#44; and ordered<lb/> him at last to sit down&#59; nay&#33; And this point it is particularly that ex<lb/>asperated <persName>Mr J.</persName> mostly&#8212;declared before the society&#44; that my complaint&#44;<lb/> that during my absence several poor strangers had been buried without<lb/> ministerial attendance&#44; was true&#44; although <persName>Mr. J.</persName> had&#44; in the course of<lb/> his insults&#44; denied the fact.  Not one of his long regators<add>&#63;</add> was then found<lb/> who did not confess that <persName>Mr. J.</persName> acted in a most ungentlemanly &#38; <add>&#63;</add>&#45;<lb/>ness &#38; amiability.  From that time <persName>Mr. J.</persName> took his speech from <persName>Mr<lb/> V.</persName> &#38; <persName>N. Levin</persName>&#8212;During the same winter he saw himself induced<lb/> to resign in consequence of repeated complaints having been made by Congreg<lb/>ators of his&#44; of his undignified deportment in society&#44; of his leaving<lb/> the synagogue during the reading of the Haphtorah to taste a <hi rend="underline">drink</hi>&#44;<lb/> &#38;c. &#38;c.&#59; nay&#33; even before <hi rend="underline">his</hi> Board it was remarked&#44; that there was<lb/> such a wide difference between his deportment &#38; mine.  He was <hi rend="underline">permitted</hi>&#44;<lb/> upon his <hi rend="underline">request</hi>&#44; and after an apology from the pulpit&#44; to withdraw his<lb/> resignation.  Yet he must give vent to his wrath&#44; I was no longer ap&#45;<lb/>proachable&#44; and this he most outrageously insulted <persName>Mr Valentine</persName>&#44; on<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> <date>5615</date>&#44; <hi rend="underline">during Public Service</hi>&#44; which <add>&#63;</add> caused an irremediable breach<lb/> between these two&#44; and a great reserve with others.  Add to this&#44; that I am<lb/> on a most friendly with most&#44; and intimate with many of his congregation&#44;<lb/> and you can understand the rest.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Last summer&#44; you must remember&#44; he began to write against <persName>Kalish</persName> &#38;<lb/> <persName>Wise</persName>&#44; on &#8220;Ladies&#39; singing &#38;c&#8221;&#44; when he wanted books of reference&#44; which has not&#44;</p>

				<p>since his whole Hebrew library consists of about &#189; dozen Volumes&#44; the <add>Hebrew</add> included.<lb/>  But too proud&#44; to send to me&#44; although I had all along sent him word&#44; that my<lb/> library was at his disposal&#44; even for Articles against myself&#44; he resorted to<lb/> a trick.  A Polish Jew often visited me with the pretext to &#8220;<hi rend="underline"><add>&#63;</add></hi>&#44;&#8221;<lb/> and made extracts from the Talmud&#44; Maimonides &#38;c.  I know at once<lb/> for whom he &#8220;learned.&#8221;  But having made it a rule&#44; to allow people to dupe<lb/> me&#44; until a good opportunity enables me to show them&#44; that they are the dupes&#44;<lb/> not I&#44; I permitted the man to act as he chose.  One day&#44; after reading for<lb/> some time&#44; he requested me&#44; to let him take a volume of <add>Hebrew</add> home&#44; when<lb/> I coolly answered&#58; &#8220;Tell <persName>Mr Jacobs</persName>&#44; whenever he wants a book from my library&#44;<lb/> he must either come himself&#44; or send in his own name&#59; I do not allow my<lb/> books to be borrowed in such a clandestine way&#33;&#8221;  The man burst into<lb/> a laughter&#59; &#38; said&#44; &#8220;you are keen&#44; the book was intended for <persName>Mr. Jacobs</persName>.&#8221;<lb/>  Between <add>Hebrew</add> &#38; <add>Hebrew</add> <persName>Mr J.</persName> met me at a funeral&#44; and&#8212;made up<lb/> against my Article.  I answered&#44; I should be glad of it&#44; only requested him to<lb/> abstain from all scurvilities &#38; personalities&#44; as a <hi rend="underline">friendly</hi> controversy could be<lb/> productive only of good.  He promised all.  And when his first Article ap&#45;<lb/>peared&#44; some of <hi rend="underline">his admirers</hi> expressed to me their astonishment at this&#44;<lb/> that he could write so calmly.  They were soon cured of their astonish&#45;<lb/>ment.  Since the publication of my answer&#44; to spit out whenever he meets me.<lb/>  Nay&#33; he went even so far&#44; to recite&#44; at a nuptial festival&#44; a Hebrew<lb/> poem&#44; extracted from some work&#44; but given out by him as his own&#44; to ridicule<lb/> me&#44; thus making himself also&#44; besides being the officiating minister&#44; the<lb/> Possenmacher.  And hence&#58; <hi rend="underline">illae lacrumae</hi>.  You may now<lb/> judge how impartial he must <add>&#63;</add>&#44; whenever I am concerned.  I assure<lb/> you&#44; that I deeply regret this state of things&#44; for his sake&#44; for so far&#44;<lb/> he has been the loser in every respect.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In your last editorial you give me also &#8220;a lick at the tailor.&#8221;  And<lb/> yet you owe me thanks&#59; for it was I&#44; who forced <persName>Drs W.</persName> &#38; <persName>L.</persName> to declare them&#45;<lb/>selves&#44; and I would be very much obliged to you for telling me&#58; whether you<lb/> <sic>indorse</sic> their explanations of the ii Article&#44; or not&#59; and whether they spoke<lb/> in the same manner before the conference.  I am inclined to think&#44; they<lb/> then deluded you&#44; or&#44; as you will have it&#44; themselves.  That is of little<lb/> difference to the Public&#59; this much we have gained&#44; that we now understand<lb/> what they wanted.  And if you will let me have the use of your pages&#44; I<lb/> will &#8220;shed&#8221; a little more ink&#44; and write &#8220;commentaries&#8221; on their expositions.</p>
