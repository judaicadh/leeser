			<p rend="indent(1)">The <persName>Rev. Isaac Leeser</persName> who died in this City last <date>Saturday&#44;<lb/> Feb. 1st 1868</date>&#44; was a native of <placeName>Germany</placeName>. At the age of nineteen he<lb/> left that country for <placeName>America</placeName>&#44; taking up his residence with an Uncle<lb/> in <placeName>Richmond&#44; Va.</placeName>&#45; Those qualities which afterwards made him so dis&#45;<lb/>tinguished&#44; his thorough knowledge of the Hebrew Language and its<lb/> Literature together with his native eloquence&#44; soon attracted the<lb/> attention of the leading Israelites in that City.&#45; When in <date>1830</date>&#44;<lb/> by the death of the <persName>Rev Mr Keyes</persName>&#44; the Congregation of Michvah Israel of<lb/> <placeName>Phila</placeName>&#44; were in want of a Reader&#44;  he was persuaded though not 22 to<lb/> accept the Office.&#45; He held this responsible position many years&#44;<lb/> until an unfortunate misunderstanding caused him to resign in <date>1850</date><lb/> taking an affecting leave of his congregation on the <date>second day of<lb/> the Feast of Tabernacles</date>.&#45;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In <date>1855</date> he organized a second <sic>Portugese</sic> Synagogue in <placeName>Phila</placeName>&#44;<lb/> <placeName>Franklin St near Green</placeName>&#44; and continued its active Minister until<lb/> within a few months of his death&#44; when failing health compelled him<lb/> to seek for a time a warmer climate.&#45; He returned <date>March 1867</date> and<lb/> as far as rapidly increasing disease would permit&#44; continued to dis&#45;<lb/>charge his manifold duties&#44; till Death released his body from suffer&#45;<lb/>ing and gave his Soul to the Eternal Home of this Heavenly Father.&#45;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">As a contribution to Jewish literature <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> leaves<lb/> a blank which it is almost impossible to fill. He made a careful<lb/> translation of the Hebrew Prayer Book&#44; which had gone though many<lb/> editions&#44; and is universally used by Israelites in all parts of the<lb/> <placeName>United States</placeName>.&#45; In <date>1856</date> he published a translation of the Holy<lb/> Scriptures&#44; upon which he had been long engaged.&#45; He was the founder<lb/> and until the day of his death&#44; the only editor of the Occident</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">&#45; 2 &#45;</p>
				<p>the first Jewish Periodical published in this country.&#45; He was ever<lb/> anxious to promote Education and encourage the Young. He promoted<lb/> the &#8220;Jewish Miscellany&#8221; in which many of <persName>Miss Aguilar&#39;s</persName> writings<lb/> first appeared&#44; and assisted the Hebrew Sunday School of <placeName>Phila</placeName>&#44; from<lb/> which so many have been formed&#44; and for which he wrote several text<lb/> books&#44; one on the &#8220;Commandments&#8221; being his last publication.&#45; To<lb/> his untiring efforts are mainly due the &#8220;Educational Society&#8221; the<lb/> &#8220;Maimonides College&#8221; and the &#8220;Jewish Hospital&#8221;. He was an active<lb/> member of every society for the relief and improvement of his fellow<lb/> Israelites.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">He was the first Jewish minister in this country  who intro&#45;<lb/>duced an English discourse as part of the weekly service in the<lb/> Synagogue and of late years&#44; his sermons&#44; delivered without notes&#44;<lb/> seemed at times like Inspiration and can never be forgotten by those<lb/> who listened to his soul thrilling words of encouragement in the<lb/> performance of duties in this World&#44; with the bright promise of<lb/> reward in the Future State.&#45; Many of these Sermons were delivered<lb/> at the Dedication of Synagogues in all parts of the Country which<lb/> were organized mainly by his influence&#44; and an all flourishing and<lb/> spreading Orthodox <sic>Jewdaism</sic> throughout the Land&#44; the most grateful<lb/> tribute to his memory.&#45;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> never married&#44; so that his name dies with him&#44;<lb/> but his <hi rend="underline">memory</hi> will long be cherished by every follower of his Holy<lb/> Faith&#44; and particularly by his many personal friends who will listen<lb/> in vain for his voice in the familiar services&#44; and will not know<lb/> where to seek for that information and assistance he was ever both</p>

			<p rend="indent(1)">His funeral which took place to&#45;day was largely attended.&#45;<lb/> His request was to be buried without other ceremonies than those<lb/> used for any private individual of his Faith.&#45;</p>
