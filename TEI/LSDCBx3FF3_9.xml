            <p rend="indent(1)">The <persName>Rev. Isaac Leeser</persName> who died in this City
                last <date>Saturday,<lb/> Feb. 1st 1868</date>, was a native of
                    <placeName>Germany</placeName>. At the age of nineteen he<lb/> left that country
                for <placeName>America</placeName>, taking up his residence with an Uncle<lb/> in
                    <placeName>Richmond, Va.</placeName>- Those qualities which afterwards made him
                so dis-<lb/>tinguished, his thorough knowledge of the Hebrew Language and its<lb/>
                Literature together with his native eloquence, soon attracted the<lb/> attention of
                the leading Israelites in that City.- When in <date>1830</date>,<lb/> by the death
                of the <persName>Rev Mr Keyes</persName>, the Congregation of Michvah Israel of<lb/>
                <placeName>Phila</placeName>, were in want of a Reader, he was persuaded though not
                22 to<lb/> accept the Office.- He held this responsible position many years,<lb/>
                until an unfortunate misunderstanding caused him to resign in <date>1850</date><lb/>
                taking an affecting leave of his congregation on the <date>second day of<lb/> the
                    Feast of Tabernacles</date>.-</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">In <date>1855</date> he organized a second <sic>Portugese</sic>
                Synagogue in <placeName>Phila</placeName>,<lb/>
                <placeName>Franklin St near Green</placeName>, and continued its active Minister
                until<lb/> within a few months of his death, when failing health compelled him<lb/>
                to seek for a time a warmer climate.- He returned <date>March 1867</date> and<lb/>
                as far as rapidly increasing disease would permit, continued to dis-<lb/>charge his
                manifold duties, till Death released his body from suffer-<lb/>ing and gave his Soul
                to the Eternal Home of this Heavenly Father.-</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">As a contribution to Jewish literature <persName>Mr.
                    Leeser</persName> leaves<lb/> a blank which it is almost impossible to fill. He
                made a careful<lb/> translation of the Hebrew Prayer Book, which had gone though
                many<lb/> editions, and is universally used by Israelites in all parts of the<lb/>
                <placeName>United States</placeName>.- In <date>1856</date> he published a
                translation of the Holy<lb/> Scriptures, upon which he had been long engaged.- He
                was the founder<lb/> and until the day of his death, the only editor of the
                Occident</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p rend="align(center)">- 2 -</p>
            <p>the first Jewish Periodical published in this country.- He was ever<lb/> anxious to
                promote Education and encourage the Young. He promoted<lb/> the “Jewish Miscellany”
                in which many of <persName>Miss Aguilar's</persName> writings<lb/> first appeared,
                and assisted the Hebrew Sunday School of <placeName>Phila</placeName>, from<lb/>
                which so many have been formed, and for which he wrote several text<lb/> books, one
                on the “Commandments” being his last publication.- To<lb/> his untiring efforts are
                mainly due the “Educational Society” the<lb/> “Maimonides College” and the “Jewish
                Hospital”. He was an active<lb/> member of every society for the relief and
                improvement of his fellow<lb/> Israelites.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">He was the first Jewish minister in this country who
                intro-<lb/>duced an English discourse as part of the weekly service in the<lb/>
                Synagogue and of late years, his sermons, delivered without notes,<lb/> seemed at
                times like Inspiration and can never be forgotten by those<lb/> who listened to his
                soul thrilling words of encouragement in the<lb/> performance of duties in this
                World, with the bright promise of<lb/> reward in the Future State.- Many of these
                Sermons were delivered<lb/> at the Dedication of Synagogues in all parts of the
                Country which<lb/> were organized mainly by his influence, and an all flourishing
                and<lb/> spreading Orthodox <sic>Jewdaism</sic> throughout the Land, the most
                grateful<lb/> tribute to his memory.-</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> never married, so that his name dies
                with him,<lb/> but his <hi rend="underline">memory</hi> will long be cherished by
                every follower of his Holy<lb/> Faith, and particularly by his many personal friends
