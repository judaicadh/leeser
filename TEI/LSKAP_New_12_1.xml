			<p rend="indent(1)">We cheerfully give place to the following<lb/> distinguished correspondence which will&#44;<lb/> beyond all doubt&#44; be read with pleasure by<lb/> all of our readers who&#44; like ourselves&#44; de&#45;<lb/>sire to see justice done to <persName>General Grant</persName>&#44;<lb/> now the incoming Executive head of the<lb/> Government&#58;</p>

			<p rend="indent(1)">I send you enclosed a copy of a letter in<lb/> my possession from <persName>General Grant</persName>&#44; together<lb/> with one from <persName>Mr. Moses</persName> written to <persName>General<lb/> Grant</persName>&#44; and to which this is a reply.  Few men<lb/> have the moral greatness of character to<lb/> write such a letter.  Its publication during<lb/> the pendency of the election would have cast<lb/> suspicion on the motive which prompted it&#44;<lb/> no such suspicion can arise now.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I am aware that you and many of you<lb/> have conceived that <persName>General Grant</persName> did you<lb/> great injustice in promulgating Order No.<lb/> 11.  His frank denial of any such intention<lb/> proves not only the magnanimity of his<lb/> character&#44; but that he is incapable of enter&#45;<lb/>taining against the Jews&#44; or any other peo&#45;<lb/>ple&#44; as a sect or race&#44; an unkind feeling.  He<lb/> is too great and good for that.  Will you&#44;<lb/> therefore&#44; do the General the justice to pub&#45;<lb/>lish his letter in your widely extended<lb/> paper.  I assume the liberty of sending it<lb/> to you for that purpose.  I remain&#44; sir&#44;</p>

			<p rend="indent(1)">SIR&#8212;I address you at the earnest solicita&#45;<lb/>tion of your friend&#44; Hon. <persName>I. N. Morris</persName>&#44; in<lb/> relation to the matter now generally known<lb/> as Order No. 11.  It will hardly surprise you<lb/> that we&#44; as a people&#44; already over&#45;sensitive<lb/> through former oppression and contumely<lb/> should lament the issuance of that order&#44;<lb/> whatever the immediate causes might<lb/> have dictated.  I am assured by high author&#45;<lb/>ity&#44; some of which I might call Jewish&#44; that<lb/> no idea of special dislike to the Jews<lb/> prompted you&#44; on the contrary&#44; that you<lb/> regret the sweeping effect of the order.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">However generous this avowal may be on<lb/> your part&#44; yet you are well aware that a<lb/> word spoken or a sentence written ceases<lb/> to be the property of the speaker or writer<lb/> and passes into the domain of history&#44; par&#45;<lb/>ticularly when spoken or written by a man<lb/> of super&#45;eminent position and worth.  I<lb/> regret that our people&#44; who love to enjoy the<lb/> quiet retreat of private life&#44; should be so<lb/> prominently paraded in this campaign&#44; but<lb/> the instinct of self&#45;defense presses utter&#45;<lb/>ance&#44; however unwelcome the task.  Our<lb/> demands are simply to be judged like other<lb/> people and not to have the vices and short&#45;<lb/>coming of our bad men illuminated at the<lb/> expense of the many virtues and excellent<lb/> qualities of our good men.</p>
			<p> rend="indent(1)"Whatever the issue of this campaign may<lb/> be&#44; <persName>Mr. M.</persName>&#44; assures me that you bear no ill&#45;<lb/>will to the Jewish people&#44; and if they feel<lb/> the severe compulsion to cast their <sic>suffrages</sic><lb/> against you in this campaign&#44; they do so&#8212;<lb/>in many instances&#8212;<emph rend="italics">under protest</emph>&#44; for with<lb/> them their long&#45;assailed reputation de&#45;<lb/>mands the greatest sacrifices&#44; even at the<lb/> risk of being misunderstood by the judg&#45;<lb/>ment of the hour.  Excuse the liberty of<lb/> addressing you&#8212;I have the encouragement<lb/> of one of your friends.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Very&#44; respectfully.</p>

			<p rend="indent(3)">&#40;Letter from <persName>General Grant</persName> to hon. <persName>I. N. Morris</persName>.&#41;</p>

				<p><emph rend="italics">Hon. <persName>I. N. Morris</persName>&#58;</emph></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">DEAR SIR&#8212;I am in receipt of a letter of<lb/> <persName>Mr. A. Moses</persName> of the <date>3rd</date> inst.&#44; enclosing one<lb/> from you&#44; bearing same date.  My first in&#45;<lb/>clination was to answer <persName>Mr. Moses</persName>&#44; because<lb/> you desired it&#59; then I thought it would be<lb/> better to adhere to the rule of silence as to<lb/> all letters.  Were I once to commence an&#45;<lb/>swering all political questions asked of me&#44;<lb/> there would not be time between now and<lb/> the <date>3rd of November</date> to get through.  <persName>Mr.<lb/> Moses</persName>&#44; I think&#44; will readily understand this.<lb/>  In regard to Order No. 11&#44; hundreds of let&#45;<lb/>ters have been written to me about it by<lb/> persons of the faith affected by it.  I do or<lb/> did not answer any of the writers&#44; but per&#45;<lb/>mitted a statement of the facts concerning<lb/> the origin of the order to be made out and<lb/> given to some one of them for publication.<lb/>  <emph rend="italics">I do not pretend to sustain the order</emph>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">At the time of its publication&#44; I was in&#45;<lb/>censed by a reprimand received from <placeName>Wash&#45;<lb/>ington</placeName> for permitting acts which Jews<lb/> within my lines were engaged in.  There<lb/> were many other persons within my lines<lb/> equally bad with the worst of them&#44; but the<lb/> difference was that the Jews could pass<lb/> with impunity from one army to the other&#44;<lb/> and gold&#44; in violation of orders&#44; was being<lb/> smuggled through the lines&#44; at least so it<lb/> was reported.  The order was issued and<lb/> sent without any reflection and without<lb/> thinking of the Jews as a sect or race to<lb/> themselves&#44; but simply as persons who had<lb/> successfully &#40;I say successfully&#44; instead of<lb/> persistently&#44; because there were plenty of<lb/> others within my lines who envied their<lb/> success&#41; violated an order&#44; which greatly<lb/> inured to the help of the rebels.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><emph rend="italics">Give <persName>Mr. Moses</persName> assurance that I have no<lb/> prejudice against sect or race&#44; but want each<lb/> individual to be judged by his own merit</emph>.  Or&#45;<lb/>der No. 11 does not sustain this statement&#44;<lb/> I admit&#44; but then <emph rend="italics">I do not sustain that order</emph>.<lb/>  It never would have been issued&#44; if it had<lb/> not been telegraphed the moment it was<lb/> penned&#44; and without reflection.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Yours&#44; truly&#44;</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)"><persName>U. S. GRANT</persName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">We shall have something to say in our<lb/> next issue in view of the above correspond&#45;<lb/>ence&#44; as also in further definition of the<lb/> course taken by us respecting <persName>General<lb/> Grant</persName> and Order No. 11&#44; prior to his nom&#45;<lb/>ination by the <placeName>Chicago</placeName> Convention&#59; not<lb/> that the disinterestedness or rectitude of<lb/> THE ISRAELITE in those premises need any<lb/> re&#45;affirmation&#44; but that the history of Order<lb/> No. 11 and of the commotion produced by<lb/> it would be less complete without that final<lb/> word of ours.&#8212;ED. IS.</p>
