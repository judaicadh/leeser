			<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>New Orleans</placeName> <date>August 22. 5612</date></p>
          <p rend="indent(1)"><addressee>Rev. I. Leeser</addressee></p>
          <p rend="indent(3)">Dear Friend&#44;</p>
          <p rend="indent(5)">You are no doubt by<lb/> this time in possession of the second letter from our<lb/> mutual friend&#44; <persName>Mr. G. Kursheedt.</persName> In it you were<lb/> advised&#44; that I would write to you in the course of<lb/> 2 or 3 days. I redeem this promise and would merely<lb/> add&#44; that I would ere this have written to you on the<lb/> subject in question&#44; had not <persName>Mr. K.</persName> anticipated me.<lb/> <persName>Mr. K.</persName> has acted very promptly in this matter and has&#44;<lb/> as far as circumstances would permit him&#44; evinced<lb/> a truly friendly and sincere regard for your claims.<lb/> His second letter was written in my presence. You<lb/> may rely on its statements. They are no crude sup<lb/>positions&#44; no hasty&#44; inconsiderate conclusions&#44; but<lb/> the result of an impartial&#44; unbiased examination<lb/> of the queries&#44; which you propounded. <persName>Mr. K.</persName> thought<lb/> it his duty &#40;and I fully agreed with him&#41; to let you<lb/> know the true state of things&#8212;frankly&#44; openly&#44; un&#45;<lb/>equivocably. You may&#44; therefore safely base your course<lb/> of action with regard to <placeName>NO.</placeName> <sic>ministery</sic>&#44; on the<lb/> statements contained in that letter.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I have no new light<lb/> to throw on the subject. But a good deal might<lb/> be said&#44; whether or not you should continue to<lb/> <hi rend="underline">hold</hi></p>
		<pb n="2"/>
			<p>hold back from active service. May I presume to in&#45;<lb/>dulge some friendly advice&#44; similar to that which<lb/> you reprovingly <sic>admiministered</sic> to me some years<lb/> ago&#44; when I was about withdrawing from the ministry&#63;<lb/> It is true&#44; you have not altogether withdrawn from the<lb/> legitimate labors of your vacation. You are en&#45;<lb/>gaged in literary undertakings&#44; which will prove<lb/> of great benefit to our people. But in my humble<lb/> <sic>judgement</sic>&#44; these need not be abandoned&#44; tho&#39; their ex&#45;<lb/>ecution might be attended with some difficulty&#44; were<lb/> you to accept office in this city. I would therefore<lb/> say&#44; weigh the matter well&#44; before you come to a<lb/> final determination&#59; and altho&#39; the terms&#44; under which<lb/> the office is offered to you&#44; may at first sight app&#45;<lb/>ear humiliating to your pride in a worldly point<lb/> of view&#44; yet I cannot conceive&#44; how it can affect<lb/> your well established character. The reduction of<lb/> salary only tends to show the straitened means of<lb/> the congregation&#44; but cannot in any shape or manner<lb/> be tortured to argue the inferiority of the successor<lb/> to the present incumbent. The very attempt to do so<lb/> would be ridiculous. Any one might with the same<lb/> propriety contend&#44; that I am totally unfit for the<lb/> office&#44; because I receive less than half the sal&#45;<lb/>ary of my worthy colleague. Were the Salary<lb/> therefore the only consideration&#44; you have no right<lb/> to decline. Regarding&#44; however&#44; the prospect of</p>
		<pb n="3"/>
			<p>election and term of office I can say but little.<lb/> In this respect you must be guided by your own<lb/> feelings. Nothing&#44; however&#44; I assume you would give<lb/> me greater pleasure than to see you again at the<lb/> head of a respectable congregation&#44; and more part&#45;<lb/>icularly in my immediate neighborhood.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I am greatly indebted to you<lb/> for the prompt manner&#44; in which you came forth<lb/> in <sic>defence</sic> of my name in the Occident. I <sic>dont</sic><lb/> think&#44; however&#44; that <persName>Mr. Mack</persName> did not mean to<lb/> depreciate my character. He is an inexperienced<lb/> writer and no doubt hits upon the words for the<lb/> rounding of the sentence. You must know&#44; that<lb/> <persName>Mr Mack</persName> was one of my staunchest supporters<lb/> who would have made a pretty little sacrifice&#44; could<lb/> he have secured my reelection in <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName>.<lb/> And well he might. No one knows better than <persName>Mr<lb/> M.</persName> thro&#39; what labor I have gone in behalf of his synagogue and congregation&#44; how strenuous and per&#45;<lb/>severing were my exertions in promoting its welfare<lb/> and establishing its character for the paltry sum<lb/> of &#36;500 p. a. he is the last of all men&#44; whom<lb/> I could have thought capable of casting a reflect<lb/>ion on my efficiency. The very school&#44; of which he<lb/> boasts so much&#44; was called into life chiefly<lb/> thro&#39; my cooperation. And I had intended to send<lb/> you a sermon&#44; which I delivered 4 years ago</p>
		<pb n="4"/>
			<p>in <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName> and in which I expressed my views<lb/> on the apathy of our people in pretty strong language<lb/> This sermon is written in German and was<lb/> thought so pertinent to the <del>subject</del> school&#45;project&#44; that <persName>Mr<lb/> Mack</persName> asked it of me and had it circulated<lb/> among his friends for digestion. But I would<lb/> not take the trouble to translate it&#44; nor tax<lb/> you with it. I thought it indelicate on my<lb/> part&#44; to give the subject the slightest notice<lb/> I thought&#44; however&#44; God save me of my friends<lb/> all.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I am just in receipt of a letter from<lb/> <persName>Mr. De Sola</persName>&#44; <placeName>Montreal</placeName>&#44; advising me of his<lb/> intention of publishing Beth<add>&#63;</add> English&#39;s<lb/> work&#44; for circulation among the Jews<lb/> only. The work is out of print&#44; and its<lb/> republication can only be of benefit.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">May God guide your counsels&#44; and<lb/> bless you with long life and happiness.</p>
          <p rend="indent(8)">Yours truly</p>
