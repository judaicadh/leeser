                              <p rend="indent(5)">You are no doubt by<lb/> this time in possession
                                        of the second letter from our<lb/> mutual friend,
                                                  <persName>Mr. G. Kursheedt.</persName> In it you
                                        were<lb/> advised, that I would write to you in the course
                                        of<lb/> 2 or 3 days. I redeem this promise and would
                                        merely<lb/> add, that I would ere this have written to you
                                        on the<lb/> subject in question, had not <persName>Mr.
                                                  K.</persName> anticipated me.<lb/>
                                        <persName>Mr. K.</persName> has acted very promptly in this
                                        matter and has,<lb/> as far as circumstances would permit
                                        him, evinced<lb/> a truly friendly and sincere regard for
                                        your claims.<lb/> His second letter was written in my
                                        presence. You<lb/> may rely on its statements. They are no
                                        crude sup<lb/>positions, no hasty, inconsiderate
                                        conclusions, but<lb/> the result of an impartial, unbiased
                                        examination<lb/> of the queries, which you propounded.
                                                  <persName>Mr. K.</persName> thought<lb/> it his
                                        duty (and I fully agreed with him) to let you<lb/> know the
                                        true state of things—frankly, openly, un-<lb/>equivocably.
                                        You may, therefore safely base your course<lb/> of action
                                        with regard to <placeName>NO.</placeName>

                                        But a good deal might<lb/> be said, whether or not you

                                        ago, when I was about withdrawing from the ministry?<lb/> It
                                        is true, you have not altogether withdrawn from the<lb/>
                                        legitimate labors of your vacation. You are en-<lb/>gaged in
                                        literary undertakings, which will prove<lb/> of great
                                        benefit to our people. But in my humble<lb/>
                                        <sic>judgement</sic>, these need not be abandoned, tho'
                                        their ex-<lb/>ecution might be attended with some
                                        difficulty, were<lb/> you to accept office in this city. I
                                        would therefore<lb/> say, weigh the matter well, before you
                                        come to a<lb/> final determination; and altho' the terms,
                                        under which<lb/> the office is offered to you, may at first
                                        sight app-<lb/>ear humiliating to your pride in a worldly
                                        point<lb/> of view, yet I cannot conceive, how it can
                                        affect<lb/> your well established character. The reduction
                                        of<lb/> salary only tends to show the straitened means
                                        of<lb/> the congregation, but cannot in any shape or
                                        manner<lb/> be tortured to argue the inferiority of the
                                        successor<lb/> to the present incumbent. The very attempt to
                                        do so<lb/> would be ridiculous. Any one might with the
                                        same<lb/> propriety contend, that I am totally unfit for
                                        the<lb/> office, because I receive less than half the
                                        sal-<lb/>ary of my worthy colleague. Were the Salary<lb/>
                                        therefore the only consideration, you have no right<lb/> to
                                        decline. Regarding, however, the prospect of</p>

                              <p>election and term of office I can say but little.<lb/> In this
                                        respect you must be guided by your own<lb/> feelings.
                                        Nothing, however, I assume you would give<lb/> me greater
                                        pleasure than to see you again at the<lb/> head of a

                                        rounding of the sentence. You must know, that<lb/>
                                        <persName>Mr Mack</persName> was one of my staunchest

                                        per-<lb/>severing were my exertions in promoting its
                                        welfare<lb/> and establishing its character for the paltry
