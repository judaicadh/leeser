				<p rend="align(center)"><placeName>CINCINNATI&#44; OHIO</placeName>....................<date>DECEMBER 4&#44; 1868</date>.</p>
				<p rend="align(center)">THE MYSTERIES OF <persName>GENERAL GRANT&#39;S</persName></p>
				<p rend="align(center)">ORDER No. 11.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">After a letter of <persName>General Grant</persName> himself on<lb/> the subject of Order No. 11 has been pub&#45;<lb/>lished in this journal by his own consent&#44;<lb/> and the election being over&#44; and no charge<lb/> of making political capital can be pre&#45;<lb/>ferred against us&#8212;we consider it a duty to<lb/> state what we know about the matter&#44; and<lb/> this will explain the General&#39;s letter.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The statement to which the General re&#45;<lb/>fers&#44; as having been made out for publica&#45;<lb/>tion&#44; relates&#44; most likely&#44; to the substance<lb/> of a conversation which <persName>Mr. Eckstein</persName> of<lb/> <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName> had with the General&#44; and which<lb/> <persName>Mr. E.</persName> reduced to writing&#44; with the General&#39;s<lb/> consent.  <persName>Mr. Eckstein</persName> did not publish the<lb/> matter&#44; because he considered the publica&#45;<lb/>tion impolitic.  His motives were honora&#45;<lb/>ble&#44; and entirely in favor of <persName>General Grant</persName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">At the same time we were put on the<lb/> track to ascertain&#44; beyond the shadow of a<lb/> doubt&#44; the origin of Order No. 11.  Our<lb/> readers must remember the mean spirit<lb/> against the Jews which manifested itself in<lb/> <placeName>Washington</placeName> from and after the outbreak<lb/> of the rebellion.  From <persName>Senator Wilson</persName><lb/> down to the agent of the associated press&#44;<lb/> speakers and writers belittled and slan&#45;<lb/>dered the Jew on numerous occasions&#44; in<lb/> the style of <persName>Brownlow</persName> and <persName>Butler</persName>.  Those<lb/> who forgot this&#44; can refresh their memory<lb/> by reviewing the pages of THE ISRAELITE<lb/> from <date>1861</date> to <date>1864</date>.  <persName>Mr. Benjamin</persName> of <placeName>Louis&#45;<lb/>iana</placeName> is a Jew&#44; therefore&#8212;&#34;never mind&#44; the<lb/> Jew must be burnt.&#34;  This was the style<lb/> of the accusation and the argument.<lb/>  Therefore nothing in the world was easier<lb/> than to cast a slur on the Jew anywhere.  It<lb/> was done with perfect impunity&#59; it became<lb/> fashionable among upstarts and toadies.<lb/>  THE ISRAELITE was the only organ which<lb/> raised its voice against that iniquity&#44;<lb/> and THE ISRAELITE had enemies enough to<lb/> decry its tendency.  The reader must bear<lb/> in mind&#44; that this was the spirit of the age<lb/> in <placeName>Washington</placeName> at that time&#44; in order to un&#45;<lb/>derstand the sequel.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">With the advance of our armies in the<lb/> <placeName>South&#45;west</placeName>&#44; the cotton trade began to claim<lb/> the attention of speculators.  Some promi&#45;<lb/>nent gentlemen in <placeName>Washington</placeName>&#44; senators<lb/> and high officials&#44; whose names we know&#44;<lb/> but do not wish to mention&#44; were the first<lb/> and most extensive cotton dealers at the<lb/> time&#44; and realized vast profits from the<lb/> trade.  Some Jewish houses in the <placeName>West</placeName><lb/> discovered the opportunity&#44; and went into<lb/> the cotton trade.  This was an unpleasant<lb/> opposition to the <placeName>Washington</placeName> operators&#44;<lb/> for the Jews paid higher prices&#44; bought<lb/> the cotton up&#44; and the speculators down on<lb/> them.  It must not be forgotten&#44; however&#44;<lb/> that the Jews did not purchase one&#45;tenth<lb/> of the cotton which was sold there along<lb/> the line&#59; nevertheless the <placeName>Washington</placeName> oper&#45;<lb/>ators did not like the interference.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Nothing was easier at that time than to<lb/> play chicaneries on the Jew.  It was given<lb/> out there&#44; the Jews smuggle gold across the<lb/> line to purchase cotton of the rebels&#44; and<lb/> everybody was ready to believe it&#44; and to<lb/> add in explanation&#44; &#34;All the Jews buy all<lb/> the cotton&#44; and all of them smuggle all all the<lb/> gold.&#34;  This was a master stroke of the<lb/> <placeName>Washington</placeName> operators&#44; for it led to secret<lb/> instructions from head&#45;quarters to all the<lb/> commanders in the <placeName>West</placeName>&#44; to look out after<lb/> the Jews.  Our readers must remember all<lb/> the chicaneries to which they were sub&#45;<lb/>jected in <placeName>Louisville</placeName>&#44; <placeName>Bowling Green</placeName>&#44; <placeName>Nash&#45;<lb/>ville</placeName> and elsewhere&#44; outside of <persName>General<lb/> Grant&#39;s</persName> department.  Every feeling of<lb/> honor was outraged by provost marshals&#44;<lb/> post commanders&#44; aids&#44; corporals and de&#45;<lb/>tectives&#44; and all that was done chiefly on<lb/> instigation of the <placeName>Washington</placeName> cotton spec&#45;<lb/>ulators.  <persName>General Grant</persName> then issued an or&#45;<lb/>der&#44; that no cotton should be bought for<lb/> gold&#44; in order to prevent carrying gold<lb/> across the line&#59; but the order was revoked<lb/> in <placeName>Washington</placeName>&#44; because it interfered with<lb/> the cotton speculators there&#44; who knew<lb/> that people on the line would not take<lb/> greenbacks&#44; and their agents carried the<lb/> gold precisely to the same places where the<lb/> Jews did.  Neither of them considered it<lb/> very sinful to purchase cotton anywhere&#44;<lb/> and for any sort of money.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">All these chicaneries and outrages&#44; how&#45;<lb/>ever&#44; did not terrify Jewish traders along<lb/> the line&#44; especially in <persName>General Grant&#39;s</persName> de&#45;<lb/>partment&#44; where most of the cotton was.<lb/>  This set the <placeName>Washington</placeName> operators to work<lb/> against <persName>General Grant</persName>.  They accused him<lb/> of mal&#45;administration&#44; maintaining that<lb/> most of the smuggling was done in his de&#45;<lb/>partment&#44; and even insinuated that he did<lb/> not care exactly to stop it.  They had an<lb/> anonymous letter to this effect written and<lb/> mailed at <placeName>Chicago</placeName> to the war office in<lb/> <placeName>Washington</placeName>&#44; and there the nameless letter<lb/> was so seriously taken to heart&#44; that it was<lb/> forwarded to <persName>General Grant</persName> with the repri&#45;<lb/>mand which&#44; the General says&#44; &#34;incensed&#34;<lb/> him.  Just think&#44; how vigilantly the war<lb/> office watched over the interests of the<lb/> country&#44; if an anonymous letter even was<lb/> so carefully considered&#44; that it was for&#45;<lb/>warded to a commanding General with a<lb/> reprimand.  If there had been no cotton<lb/> dealers somewhere not quite a hundred<lb/> miles from that office&#44; that anonymous let&#45;<lb/>ter must surely have taken its regular<lb/> course into the waste paper basket.  It is<lb/> common for thieves to cry&#58; catch the thief.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">They understood the art very well how to<lb/> incense <persName>General Grant</persName>&#44; and knowing that<lb/> they had brought him to the point&#44; rapidly<lb/> and sagaciously followed up their victory<lb/> to earn the fruits.  On the <date>17th of Decem&#45;<lb/>ber&#44; 1862</date>&#44; <persName>General Grant</persName>&#44; at <placeName>Oxford&#44; Miss.</placeName>&#44;<lb/> received the following instruction from<lb/> <placeName>Washington</placeName>&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#34;<emph rend="italics">We are reliably informed that the Jews<lb/> in the various cities are buying up the gold&#44;<lb/> to take to the <placeName>South</placeName>&#44; to invest in cotton&#8212;that<lb/> will place in the hands of the rebels in&#45;<lb/>creased means to carry on the war.  That<lb/> should be prevented.  You will therefore<lb/> take measures to prevent it in your depart&#45;<lb/>ment.</emph>&#34;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The natural consequence of this peremp&#45;<lb/>tory instruction&#44; after the previous ex&#45;<lb/>pression from head&#45;quarters&#44; was the issue<lb/> of Order No. 11&#44; exiling the Jews from the<lb/> department of the <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>.  At the same<lb/> time&#44; however&#44; Jews not connected anyway<lb/> with the General&#44; applied and received per&#45;<lb/>mission to remain&#44; as he himself did actu&#45;<lb/>ally not know against whom&#44; personally&#44;<lb/> the order was directed.  It was a general<lb/> outrage committed in military obedience<lb/> and subordination to orders from head&#45;<lb/>quarters&#44; in consequence especially of the<lb/> former reprimand.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The order came from <placeName>Washington</placeName>&#44; and&#44;<lb/> like former orders and instructions&#44; was<lb/> procured by the cotton ring.  But it is evi&#45;<lb/>dent&#44; that some cabinet officers worked<lb/> harmoniously with the said ring.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">A few hours after that order had been<lb/> issued&#44; we were informed thereof&#44; and pub&#45;<lb/>lished it in THE ISRAELITE.  Five days be&#45;<lb/>fore publishing it&#44; however&#44; &#40;it appeared<lb/> <date>Friday&#44; January 2</date>&#44;&#41; we wrote a letter to<lb/> Secretary <persName>Stanton</persName>&#44; apprising him of the<lb/> outrageous order&#44; and suggested very po&#45;<lb/>litely&#44; that the order should be instantly<lb/> revoked before any complaints could reach<lb/> <placeName>Washington</placeName>&#44; which would place the Gov&#45;<lb/>ernment in the best light.  We quoted his&#45;<lb/>torical precedences in support of the sug&#45;<lb/>gestion&#44; and finally begged the Secretary<lb/> to save us the unpleasant business of going<lb/> to <placeName>Washington</placeName> to request the President<lb/> to revoke the order&#44; as we should be unable<lb/> to resist the pressure&#8212;and would have to<lb/> go.  Our object was to place the Govern&#45;<lb/>ment in a proper light&#44; and to prevent any<lb/> and every notoriety of the said order&#44; which<lb/> we apprehended was fraught with mischief.<lb/>  Reluctantly we published the order&#44; ex&#45;<lb/>pecting to the last moment an answer by<lb/> the Secretary&#44; or the revocation of the or&#45;<lb/>der&#59; but neither came.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">A delegation was elected to see the Presi&#45;<lb/>dent on the subject.  On the <date>7th of Janu&#45;<lb/>ary</date>&#44; in the evening&#44; we were introduced to<lb/> President <persName>Lincoln</persName>&#44; who informed us that<lb/> the order was revoked yesterday.  He<lb/> said&#44; especially and literally&#58; &#34;I could not<lb/> imagine that <persName>Grant</persName> could have issued such<lb/> a foolish order.  I sent over to <persName>Stanton</persName>&#44; and<lb/> to <persName>Halleck</persName>&#44; &#40;<date>January 5</date>&#44;&#41; and they did not<lb/> know anything about it.&#34;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Now mark&#44; <persName>Mr. Stanton</persName> knew nothing<lb/> about the existence of that order on <date>Janu&#45;<lb/>ary 5&#44; 1863</date>&#59; although we had written him<lb/> the whole affair in <date>December</date>&#44; and a letter<lb/> reaches <placeName>Washington</placeName> from <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName> in less<lb/> than two days&#59; and although the text to<lb/> the order came from his very department&#44;<lb/> and the order was issued on the <date>17th of<lb/> December</date>&#59; and although the anonymous<lb/> letter from <placeName>Chicago</placeName>&#8212;so much importance<lb/> was attached to letters&#8212;the anonymous<lb/> letter accusing the Jews&#44; was sent with a<lb/> reprimand to <persName>General Grant</persName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">You know now who conspired with the<lb/> cotton ring in <placeName>Washington</placeName>&#63;  You know<lb/> who issued the text to <persName>Grant&#39;s</persName> Order No.<lb/> 11&#63;  You know now who were the swin&#45;<lb/>dlers and the <emph rend="italics">lazaroni</emph> of the army&#63;  If<lb/> you do not know it&#44; we do&#44; and in order<lb/> that the reader may also know it&#44; we will<lb/> add one more fact&#58; After <persName>Grant&#39;s</persName> Order<lb/> No. 11 had been issued&#44; and the ring be&#45;<lb/>lieved to have finally disposed of all small<lb/> traders&#44; &#40;they did not imagine a revocation<lb/> possible&#44;&#41; the text to another general order<lb/> came from the self&#45;same department&#44; and<lb/> this was&#44; that COTTON MUST BE SOLD FOR<lb/> TWENTY&#45;FIVE CENTS A POUND.  You know<lb/> now&#44; who were the thieves&#44; the smugglers<lb/> and the <emph rend="italics">lazaroni</emph>&#63;  We hope you do.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">We have done justice to the case&#44; and<lb/> despise&#44; from the deepest depth of our soul<lb/> we despise and condemn those small&#44; filthy<lb/> and shameless office seekers&#44; who impugned<lb/> our motives in public print&#44; as was done<lb/> by persons who&#44; for the last eight years&#44;<lb/> were in market for any and every appoint&#45;<lb/>ment&#44; as they could not venture their<lb/> names on an election.  We owe like com&#45;<lb/>pliments to those of our habitual traducers<lb/> who&#44; not withstanding the articles that ap&#45;<lb/>peared in this journal prior to the assem&#45;<lb/>bling of the <placeName>Chicago</placeName> Convention were only<lb/> designed toward dissuading the party from<lb/> nominating <persName>Grant</persName> while we still believed<lb/> him the author of Order No. 11&#44; notwith&#45;<lb/>standing the publication by us of political<lb/> articles against <persName>Grant</persName> ceased with the as&#45;<lb/>sembling and adjournment of the <placeName>Chicago</placeName><lb/> Convention&#44; still persisted in wantonly<lb/> and recklessly accusing the editor of seek&#45;<lb/>ing to subvert the purposes of THE ISRAEL&#45;<lb/>ITE to partisan ends&#44; and of seeking a mar&#45;<lb/>ket for whatever of political influence we<lb/> might have been able to exert.  We will<lb/> mention no names&#44; they are too insignifi&#45;<lb/>cant.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The question is asked&#44; why did not <persName>Gen.<lb/> Grant</persName> come out in bold language&#44; and say<lb/> the same things&#63;  We venture to say&#44; you<lb/> lay this document before the General&#44; and<lb/> he will subscribe to every word thereof.<lb/>  We furthermore assert&#44; that we have our<lb/> information from as direct a source as pos&#45;<lb/>sible.  Nevertheless every reader must ad&#45;<lb/>mit&#44; that a General will not blame his<lb/> former superiors.  The matter has been<lb/> brought to our knowledge&#44; and justice re&#45;<lb/>quires its publication.</p>
