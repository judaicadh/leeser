            <p rend="align(center)">ORDER No. 11.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">After a letter of <persName>General Grant</persName> himself on<lb/>
                the subject of Order No. 11 has been pub-<lb/>lished in this journal by his own
                consent,<lb/> and the election being over, and no charge<lb/> of making political
                capital can be pre-<lb/>ferred against usâ€”we consider it a duty to<lb/> state what
                we know about the matter, and<lb/> this will explain the General's letter.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The statement to which the General re-<lb/>fers, as having been made
                out for publica-<lb/>tion, relates, most likely, to the substance<lb/> of a
                conversation which <persName>Mr. Eckstein</persName> of<lb/>
                <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName> had with the General, and which<lb/>
                <persName>Mr. E.</persName> reduced to writing, with the General's<lb/> consent.
                    <persName>Mr. Eckstein</persName> did not publish the<lb/> matter, because he
                considered the publica-<lb/>tion impolitic. His motives were honora-<lb/>ble, and
                entirely in favor of <persName>General Grant</persName>.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">At the same time we were put on the<lb/> track to ascertain, beyond
                the shadow of a<lb/> doubt, the origin of Order No. 11. Our<lb/> readers must
                remember the mean spirit<lb/> against the Jews which manifested itself in<lb/>
                <placeName>Washington</placeName> from and after the outbreak<lb/> of the rebellion.
                From <persName>Senator Wilson</persName><lb/> down to the agent of the associated
                press,<lb/> speakers and writers belittled and slan-<lb/>dered the Jew on numerous
                occasions, in<lb/> the style of <persName>Brownlow</persName> and
                    <persName>Butler</persName>. Those<lb/> who forgot this, can refresh their
                memory<lb/> by reviewing the pages of THE ISRAELITE<lb/> from <date>1861</date> to
                    <date>1864</date>. <persName>Mr. Benjamin</persName> of
                    <placeName>Louis-<lb/>iana</placeName> is a Jew, thereforeâ€”"never mind, the<lb/>
                Jew must be burnt." This was the style<lb/> of the accusation and the argument.<lb/>
                Therefore nothing in the world was easier<lb/> than to cast a slur on the Jew
                anywhere. It<lb/> was done with perfect impunity; it became<lb/> fashionable among
                upstarts and toadies.<lb/> THE ISRAELITE was the only organ which<lb/> raised its
                voice against that iniquity,<lb/> and THE ISRAELITE had enemies enough to<lb/> decry
                its tendency. The reader must bear<lb/> in mind, that this was the spirit of the
                age<lb/> in <placeName>Washington</placeName> at that time, in order to
                un-<lb/>derstand the sequel.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">With the advance of our armies in the<lb/>
                <placeName>South-west</placeName>, the cotton trade began to claim<lb/> the
                attention of speculators. Some promi-<lb/>nent gentlemen in
                    <placeName>Washington</placeName>, senators<lb/> and high officials, whose names
                we know,<lb/> but do not wish to mention, were the first<lb/> and most extensive
                cotton dealers at the<lb/> time, and realized vast profits from the<lb/> trade. Some
                Jewish houses in the <placeName>West</placeName><lb/> discovered the opportunity,
                and went into<lb/> the cotton trade. This was an unpleasant<lb/> opposition to the
                    <placeName>Washington</placeName> operators,<lb/> for the Jews paid higher
                prices, bought<lb/> the cotton up, and the speculators down on<lb/> them. It must
                not be forgotten, however,<lb/> that the Jews did not purchase one-tenth<lb/> of the
                cotton which was sold there along<lb/> the line; nevertheless the
                    <placeName>Washington</placeName> oper-<lb/>ators did not like the

            <p rend="indent(1)">Nothing was easier at that time than to<lb/> play chicaneries on the
                Jew. It was given<lb/> out there, the Jews smuggle gold across the<lb/> line to
                purchase cotton of the rebels, and<lb/> everybody was ready to believe it, and
                to<lb/> add in explanation, "All the Jews buy all<lb/> the cotton, and all of them
                smuggle all all the<lb/> gold." This was a master stroke of the<lb/>
                <placeName>Washington</placeName> operators, for it led to secret<lb/> instructions
                from head-quarters to all the<lb/> commanders in the <placeName>West</placeName>, to
                look out after<lb/> the Jews. Our readers must remember all<lb/> the chicaneries to
                which they were sub-<lb/>jected in <placeName>Louisville</placeName>,
                    <placeName>Bowling Green</placeName>, <placeName>Nash-<lb/>ville</placeName> and
                elsewhere, outside of <persName>General<lb/> Grant's</persName> department. Every
                feeling of<lb/> honor was outraged by provost marshals,<lb/> post commanders, aids,
                corporals and de-<lb/>tectives, and all that was done chiefly on<lb/> instigation of
                the <placeName>Washington</placeName> cotton spec-<lb/>ulators. <persName>General
                    Grant</persName> then issued an or-<lb/>der, that no cotton should be bought
                for<lb/> gold, in order to prevent carrying gold<lb/> across the line; but the order
                was revoked<lb/> in <placeName>Washington</placeName>, because it interfered
                with<lb/> the cotton speculators there, who knew<lb/> that people on the line would
                not take<lb/> greenbacks, and their agents carried the<lb/> gold precisely to the
                same places where the<lb/> Jews did. Neither of them considered it<lb/> very sinful
                to purchase cotton anywhere,<lb/> and for any sort of money.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">All these chicaneries and outrages, how-<lb/>ever, did not terrify
                Jewish traders along<lb/> the line, especially in <persName>General
                    Grant's</persName> de-<lb/>partment, where most of the cotton was.<lb/> This set
                the <placeName>Washington</placeName> operators to work<lb/> against
                    <persName>General Grant</persName>. They accused him<lb/> of mal-administration,
                maintaining that<lb/> most of the smuggling was done in his de-<lb/>partment, and
                even insinuated that he did<lb/> not care exactly to stop it. They had an<lb/>
                anonymous letter to this effect written and<lb/> mailed at
                    <placeName>Chicago</placeName> to the war office in<lb/>
                <placeName>Washington</placeName>, and there the nameless letter<lb/> was so
                seriously taken to heart, that it was<lb/> forwarded to <persName>General
                    Grant</persName> with the repri-<lb/>mand which, the General says,
                "incensed"<lb/> him. Just think, how vigilantly the war<lb/> office watched over the
                interests of the<lb/> country, if an anonymous letter even was<lb/> so carefully
                considered, that it was for-<lb/>warded to a commanding General with a<lb/>
                reprimand. If there had been no cotton<lb/> dealers somewhere not quite a
                hundred<lb/> miles from that office, that anonymous let-<lb/>ter must surely have
                taken its regular<lb/> course into the waste paper basket. It is<lb/> common for
                thieves to cry: catch the thief.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">They understood the art very well how to<lb/> incense
                    <persName>General Grant</persName>, and knowing that<lb/> they had brought him
                to the point, rapidly<lb/> and sagaciously followed up their victory<lb/> to earn
                the fruits. On the <date>17th of Decem-<lb/>ber, 1862</date>, <persName>General
                    Grant</persName>, at <placeName>Oxford, Miss.</placeName>,<lb/> received the
                following instruction from<lb/>
                <placeName>Washington</placeName>:</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">"<emph rend="italics">We are reliably informed that the Jews<lb/> in
                    the various cities are buying up the gold,<lb/> to take to the
                        <placeName>South</placeName>, to invest in cottonâ€”that<lb/> will place in
                    the hands of the rebels in-<lb/>creased means to carry on the war. That<lb/>
                    should be prevented. You will therefore<lb/> take measures to prevent it in your
                    depart-<lb/>ment.</emph>"</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The natural consequence of this peremp-<lb/>tory instruction, after
                the previous ex-<lb/>pression from head-quarters, was the issue<lb/> of Order No.
                11, exiling the Jews from the<lb/> department of the
                    <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>. At the same<lb/> time, however, Jews not
                connected anyway<lb/> with the General, applied and received per-<lb/>mission to
                remain, as he himself did actu-<lb/>ally not know against whom, personally,<lb/> the
                order was directed. It was a general<lb/> outrage committed in military
                obedience<lb/> and subordination to orders from head-<lb/>quarters, in consequence
                especially of the<lb/> former reprimand.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The order came from <placeName>Washington</placeName>, and,<lb/>
                like former orders and instructions, was<lb/> procured by the cotton ring. But it is
                evi-<lb/>dent, that some cabinet officers worked<lb/> harmoniously with the said
                ring.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">A few hours after that order had been<lb/> issued, we were informed
                thereof, and pub-<lb/>lished it in THE ISRAELITE. Five days be-<lb/>fore publishing
                it, however, (it appeared<lb/>
                <date>Friday, January 2</date>,) we wrote a letter to<lb/> Secretary
                    <persName>Stanton</persName>, apprising him of the<lb/> outrageous order, and
                suggested very po-<lb/>litely, that the order should be instantly<lb/> revoked
                before any complaints could reach<lb/>
                <placeName>Washington</placeName>, which would place the Gov-<lb/>ernment in the
                best light. We quoted his-<lb/>torical precedences in support of the
                sug-<lb/>gestion, and finally begged the Secretary<lb/> to save us the unpleasant
                business of going<lb/> to <placeName>Washington</placeName> to request the
                President<lb/> to revoke the order, as we should be unable<lb/> to resist the
                pressureâ€”and would have to<lb/> go. Our object was to place the Govern-<lb/>ment in
                a proper light, and to prevent any<lb/> and every notoriety of the said order,
                which<lb/> we apprehended was fraught with mischief.<lb/> Reluctantly we published
                the order, ex-<lb/>pecting to the last moment an answer by<lb/> the Secretary, or
                the revocation of the or-<lb/>der; but neither came.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">A delegation was elected to see the Presi-<lb/>dent on the subject.
                On the <date>7th of Janu-<lb/>ary</date>, in the evening, we were introduced to<lb/>
                President <persName>Lincoln</persName>, who informed us that<lb/> the order was
                revoked yesterday. He<lb/> said, especially and literally: "I could not<lb/> imagine
                that <persName>Grant</persName> could have issued such<lb/> a foolish order. I sent
                over to <persName>Stanton</persName>, and<lb/> to <persName>Halleck</persName>,
                    (<date>January 5</date>,) and they did not<lb/> know anything about it."</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Now mark, <persName>Mr. Stanton</persName> knew nothing<lb/> about
                the existence of that order on <date>Janu-<lb/>ary 5, 1863</date>; although we had
                written him<lb/> the whole affair in <date>December</date>, and a letter<lb/>
                reaches <placeName>Washington</placeName> from <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName> in
                less<lb/> than two days; and although the text to<lb/> the order came from his very
                department,<lb/> and the order was issued on the <date>17th of<lb/> December</date>;
                and although the anonymous<lb/> letter from <placeName>Chicago</placeName>â€”so much
                importance<lb/> was attached to lettersâ€”the anonymous<lb/> letter accusing the Jews,
                was sent with a<lb/> reprimand to <persName>General Grant</persName>.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">You know now who conspired with the<lb/> cotton ring in
                    <placeName>Washington</placeName>? You know<lb/> who issued the text to
                    <persName>Grant's</persName> Order No.<lb/> 11? You know now who were the
                swin-<lb/>dlers and the <emph rend="italics">lazaroni</emph> of the army? If<lb/>
                you do not know it, we do, and in order<lb/> that the reader may also know it, we
                will<lb/> add one more fact: After <persName>Grant's</persName> Order<lb/> No. 11
                had been issued, and the ring be-<lb/>lieved to have finally disposed of all
                small<lb/> traders, (they did not imagine a revocation<lb/> possible,) the text to
                another general order<lb/> came from the self-same department, and<lb/> this was,
                that COTTON MUST BE SOLD FOR<lb/> TWENTY-FIVE CENTS A POUND. You know<lb/> now, who
                were the thieves, the smugglers<lb/> and the <emph rend="italics">lazaroni</emph>?
                We hope you do.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">We have done justice to the case, and<lb/> despise, from the deepest
                depth of our soul<lb/> we despise and condemn those small, filthy<lb/> and shameless
                office seekers, who impugned<lb/> our motives in public print, as was done<lb/> by
                persons who, for the last eight years,<lb/> were in market for any and every
                appoint-<lb/>ment, as they could not venture their<lb/> names on an election. We owe
                like com-<lb/>pliments to those of our habitual traducers<lb/> who, not withstanding
                the articles that ap-<lb/>peared in this journal prior to the assem-<lb/>bling of
                the <placeName>Chicago</placeName> Convention were only<lb/> designed toward
                dissuading the party from<lb/> nominating <persName>Grant</persName> while we still
                believed<lb/> him the author of Order No. 11, notwith-<lb/>standing the publication
                by us of political<lb/> articles against <persName>Grant</persName> ceased with the
                as-<lb/>sembling and adjournment of the <placeName>Chicago</placeName><lb/>
                Convention, still persisted in wantonly<lb/> and recklessly accusing the editor of
                seek-<lb/>ing to subvert the purposes of THE ISRAEL-<lb/>ITE to partisan ends, and
                of seeking a mar-<lb/>ket for whatever of political influence we<lb/> might have
                been able to exert. We will<lb/> mention no names, they are too
                insignifi-<lb/>cant.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The question is asked, why did not <persName>Gen.<lb/>
                    Grant</persName> come out in bold language, and say<lb/> the same things? We
                venture to say, you<lb/> lay this document before the General, and<lb/> he will
                subscribe to every word thereof.<lb/> We furthermore assert, that we have our<lb/>
                information from as direct a source as pos-<lb/>sible. Nevertheless every reader
                must ad-<lb/>mit, that a General will not blame his<lb/> former superiors. The
                matter has been<lb/> brought to our knowledge, and justice re-<lb/>quires its
                publication.</p>
