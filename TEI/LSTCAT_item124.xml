            <p rend="align(right)">Board of Delegates of American Israelites,</p>
            <p rend="align(right)"><placeName>Office of the Executive Committee</placeName>,</p>
            <p rend="align(right)"><placeName>New York</placeName>, <date>December 10<hi rend="sup"
                        >th</hi>, 5622-1861</date>.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The Executive Committee have addressed a Memorial to Congress,
                respectfully asking an amendment to certain Acts passed at its last<lb/> session,
                providing that “the Chaplain, appointed by the vote of the field officers and
                company commanders, must be a regular ordained min-<lb/>ister of some Christian
                denomination.” A letter from the War department, in answer to the application of the
                    <persName>Rev. Dr. Fischel</persName> to be ap-<lb/>pointed to a Regional
                Chaplaincy, refers to the restrictions imposed by said Acts, as an impediment to its
                favorable consideration.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Had the Committee limited themselves to the performance of the duty
                of entering the protest of the Israelites of the <placeName>United
                    States</placeName> against<lb/> enactments which may be construed into a
                precedent for future discriminative legislation, the trust reposed in them would
                have been but<lb/> partially discharged. To remonstrate against grievances, and
                passively await the slow progress of Congressional action for their redress,<lb/>
                may suffice, when an abstract principle alone is involved. A consideration of the
                circumstances has actuated them to adopt practical measures<lb/> to meet the
                emergency, which, they feel confident, will secure the general and unqualified
                approval of the public, and receive the generous<lb/> support which is needful for
                the accomplishment of the humane and benevolent purposes they have in view.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">It is well-known that there are several thousand Israelites serving
                with the Armies in the field, representing every state and every Euro-<lb/>pean
                nationality; and a decision has been arrived at, to adopt prompt and adequate
                measures that our co-religionists may not continue desti-<lb/>tute of the comforts
                and consolations which the Government has beneficently provided our fellow-citizens
                of “every Christian denomi-<lb/>nation,” so that the sufferings of the enfeebled or
                wounded Israelites may be assuaged by the soothing and consolatory services it is
                the<lb/> especial province of a minister of religion to dispense.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The duties of the Chaplain commence in the <emph rend="italics"
                    >Camp</emph>, where the religious observances and moral restraints maintained in
                peaceful commu-<lb/>nities, are wisely introduced, and contribute to the discipline
                and well-being of the Army. Thence, they are extended to the <emph rend="italics"
                        ><sic>Hospitel</sic></emph>, where<lb/> the benevolent efforts of the
                minister are blended with the skill of the medical professor. As the associate of
                the physician, the surgeon,<lb/> and the nurse, the Chaplain attends the bedside of
                the wounded, as well as that equally numerous class of patients, stricken with
                diseases en-<lb/>gendered by the fatigues and privations incident to a
                campaign,—whispering consolation and hope to the sufferer, inspiring the fortitude
                and re-<lb/>signation, calming the fevered brain, tranquilizing the mind, advancing
                the period of convalescence, pr preparing the spirit for the hour when<lb/> it is to
                take its flight from its mortal tenement.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The Committee, having conferred with the <persName>Rev. Dr. Arnold
                    Fischel</persName>, have engaged him to undertake the spiritual charge of our
                co-reli<lb/>gionists in the Hospitals in the “Military Department of the
                    <placeName>Potomac</placeName>;” and are happy to announce that <persName>Dr.
                    Fischel</persName> is already at his post and,<lb/> having obtained permission
                to visit the Camps and the Hospitals extending from
                    <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> to <placeName>Darnestown</placeName>, has
                entered upon the discharge<lb/> of his duties.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">As soon as adequate funds are placed at the disposal of the
                Committee, further steps will be taken to promote the welfare of Jewish
