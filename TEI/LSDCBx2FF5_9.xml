                and<lb/> is doing very well, she has one child only, a Boy.<lb/>
                <persName>Sarah</persName> was married on <date>Thursday</date> last, to a man<lb/>
                who is some 10 or 12 years her senior, by profession a Bookkeeper<lb/> on a
                    <sic>sallary</sic> of $1200 pr an but said to be an excellent man<lb/>
                <persName>Sarah</persName> is an excellent girl and was very much beloved by
                her<lb/> step mother. <persName>Delia</persName> is also a good girl and in manner
                &amp;<lb/> appearance decidedly the flower of the family. She is very<lb/> lady like
                &amp; easy in her manners &amp; has been well educated<lb/>
                <persName>Mrs Thorp</persName> deserves great credit for the care she has taken<lb/>

            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>up the girls, and for keeping the family together since <persName>Mr<lb/>
                    Thorps</persName> death as she has had to depend on her own means<lb/> to do so,
                    <persName>Mr Thorp</persName> having left nothing of his own in fact<lb/> not
                enough to pay his debts &amp; <persName>Charles</persName> will do nothing<lb/> for
                his sisters, not even to the extent of a wedding present to<lb/>
                <persName>Sarah</persName>. However I think they will do very well without him<lb/>
                at all events I do not intend to let them suffer.</p>
