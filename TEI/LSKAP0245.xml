            <p rend="indent(3)">Dear Sir</p>
            <p rend="indent(5)">We are approaching<lb/> the end of the year A year marked by greater
                vicissi<lb/>tudes in the affairs of motions than nay in which<lb/> we have lived.
                Any indeed of which we have read<lb/> Such great events have marked epochs or made
                them!<lb/> And another to be added to the numbers is the un-<lb/>weaning<add>?</add>
                consistency of my correspondence to you.<lb/> Indulge your repeated failures in
                replying to my<lb/> communications. I trust the <hi rend="underline">old</hi> year
                will blot out<lb/> all your delinquencies &amp; that the New Year will<lb/> bring
                with it punctual offerings to the Shrine of<lb/> friendship. I have a great respect
                for your <hi rend="underline">Clothes</hi><lb/> &amp; for your <hi rend="underline"
                    >talents</hi> but a much greater for my<lb/> dignity &amp; truly my self love
                waxes <add>?</add> when<lb/> I find you allow my responses to be like<lb/> Angels
                visits. Your <hi rend="underline">desire</hi> that <hi rend="underline"
                    >memories</hi> of the past<lb/> shall satisfy our hopes for the <hi
                    rend="underline">future</hi>, is rather unreasonable<lb/> &amp; not meted out
                with that spirit of generosity which<lb/> we are led to expect from one of your high
                inspira<lb/>tions. I therefore Good friend (although I may grant<lb/> you got not
                value received for your letters, feel it<lb/> incumbent on my dignity to inform you
                that if you<lb/> allow my letters to lie so long on the shelf unanswered<lb/> I
                shall cast out all remembrances of past friendship<lb/> &amp; think of our
                friendship as a thing that <hi rend="underline">was not</hi>.</p>
            <pb n="1V"/>
            <p>But badinage aside tell me good friend in sober earnest<lb/> why is it that I never
                hear from you but through the<lb/> Occident &amp; through malevolent reports which
                tell me that<lb/> you are woefully disappointed in my character &amp; the<lb/>
                esteem you have expressed, <hi rend="underline">exists no longer</hi> because<lb/>
                forsooth I cannot see with your eyes or read with<lb/> your interpretations. This
                latter reason I cast from me<lb/> as unbecoming both your religion &amp; your mind
                for however<lb/> we may desire our friends to view things as we do<lb/> we do not
                banish them from our esteem because they<lb/> cannot think as we do. You I know
                value the substance<lb/> not the shadow &amp; as I retain the former will not<lb/>
                discard me because I lop off those discrepancies which<lb/> mar the beauty of our
                Holy religion—</p>
            <p>My Cousin <persName>Mr Moise</persName> returned much pleased with his knowledge<lb/>
                of you personally &amp; was <hi rend="underline">pleased</hi> to find such
                    liberal<del>l</del> sentime<lb/>nts expressed by one so thoroughly versed in the
                elements<lb/> of our faith, The fault of American Jews originates in<lb/> their
                defective domestic education, religion with them<lb/> is but an <hi rend="underline"
                    >appendage</hi> not an essential! They know they<lb/> are born Jews, but they
                are not early <sic>enculcated</sic> with<lb/> its purity &amp; beauty; this has been
                the defect in all<lb/> our domestic education. This ever is becoming yearly<lb/>
                less glaring &amp; parents are becoming more alive, to<lb/> the necessity of making
                the religion of the Jews a<lb/> primary not a secondary consideration.</p>
            <p>I have noticed the deep importance you feel in<lb/> the establishment of schools
                where from the cradle</p>
            <pb n="2R"/>
            <p>the infant Israelite will write with all his studies a knowledge<lb/> of Judaism
                &amp; will have those doctrines of his faith laughed<lb/> by those who feel the
                importance of combining every<lb/> knowledge with a knowledge of his God &amp; will
                find<lb/> no opposition to his understanding clearly those dogmas<lb/> which seem
                now so abstruse to them because other<lb/> views clash with them from the opinions
                gathered<lb/> from their Christian teachers. While writing I am<lb/> annoyed by the
                feu de fore<add>?</add> which ushers in the birth of<lb/>
                <persName>Christ</persName>; how inconsistent it appears to me that the<lb/> Birth
                of their Savior should be celebrated by the firing<lb/> of Canons &amp; Guns as if
                it were a <hi rend="underline">National Victory</hi>!<lb/> Marriages &amp; deaths go
                on in our circle the latter by<lb/> far the most frequent for unlike our pristine
                parents<lb/> our (fancied) wants are so numerous that poor young<lb/> men are afraid
                to enter into a state which requires<lb/> such ample means to render it pleasant!
                This will be hand<lb/>ed you by my eldest son who goes on for business<lb/> not
                pleasure still I trust he will find time to be<lb/> acquainted with some of my
                friends. He is reserved to<lb/> strangers &amp; like his mother his “<hi
                    rend="underline">light is hid</hi> under a<lb/> bushel.” <persName>S
                    A</persName> &amp; <persName>Jeff</persName> beg to be remembered. I should<lb/>
                like to introduce you to all my Jewels for like<lb/> the mothers of
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName> they are all my wealth.<lb/> If this hurried
                scratch will meet with sufficient<lb/> attention, I shall be pleased with a reply
                for I would<lb/> not let <persName>Philip</persName> go without informing you however<lb/>
                <add>?</add> you have been that a son of <hi rend="underline">mine</hi> was in<lb/>
                your city. Yrs truly but in haste</p>
