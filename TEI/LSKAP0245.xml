				<p rend="align(right)"><date>December 21</date></p>
				<p><addressee>Reverend Isaac Leeser</addressee></p>
			<p rend="indent(3)">Dear Sir</p>
			<p rend="indent(5)">We are approaching<lb/> the end of the year A year marked by greater vicissi<lb/>tudes in the affairs of motions than nay in which<lb/> we have lived.  Any indeed of which we have read<lb/> Such great events have marked epochs or made them&#33;<lb/>  And another to be added to the numbers is the un&#45;<lb/>weaning<add>&#63;</add> consistency of my correspondence to you.<lb/>  Indulge your repeated failures in replying to my<lb/> communications.  I trust the <hi rend="underline">old</hi> year will blot out<lb/> all your delinquencies &#38; that the New Year will<lb/> bring with it punctual offerings to the Shrine of<lb/> friendship.  I have a great respect for your <hi rend="underline">Clothes</hi><lb/> &#38; for your <hi rend="underline">talents</hi> but a much greater for my<lb/> dignity &#38; truly my self love waxes <add>&#63;</add> when<lb/> I find you allow my responses to be like<lb/> Angels visits.  Your <hi rend="underline">desire</hi> that <hi rend="underline">memories</hi> of the past<lb/> shall satisfy our hopes for the <hi rend="underline">future</hi>&#44; is rather unreasonable<lb/> &#38; not meted out with that spirit of generosity which<lb/> we are led to expect from one of your high inspira<lb/>tions.  I therefore Good friend &#40;although I may grant<lb/> you got not value received for your letters&#44; feel it<lb/> incumbent on my dignity to inform you that if you<lb/> allow my letters to lie so long on the shelf unanswered<lb/> I shall cast out all remembrances of past friendship<lb/> &#38; think of our friendship as a thing that <hi rend="underline">was not</hi>.</p>
			<pb n="1V"/>
				<p>But badinage aside tell me good friend in sober earnest<lb/> why is it that I never hear from you but through the<lb/> Occident &#38; through malevolent reports which tell me that<lb/> you are woefully disappointed in my character &#38; the<lb/> esteem you have expressed&#44; <hi rend="underline">exists no longer</hi> because<lb/> forsooth I cannot see with your eyes or read with<lb/> your interpretations.  This latter reason I cast from me<lb/> as unbecoming both your religion &#38; your mind for however<lb/> we may desire our friends to view things as we do<lb/> we do not banish them from our esteem because they<lb/> cannot think as we do.  You I know value the substance<lb/> not the shadow &#38; as I retain the former will not<lb/> discard me because I lop off those discrepancies which<lb/> mar the beauty of our Holy religion&#8212;</p>
				<p>My Cousin <persName>Mr Moise</persName> returned much pleased with his knowledge<lb/> of you personally &#38; was <hi rend="underline">pleased</hi> to find such liberal<del>l</del> sentime<lb/>nts expressed by one so thoroughly versed in the elements<lb/> of our faith&#44; The fault of American Jews originates in<lb/> their defective domestic education&#44; religion with them<lb/> is but an <hi rend="underline">appendage</hi> not an essential&#33;  They know they<lb/> are born Jews&#44; but they are not early <sic>enculcated</sic> with<lb/> its purity &#38; beauty&#59; this has been the defect in all<lb/> our domestic education.  This ever is becoming yearly<lb/> less glaring &#38; parents are becoming more alive&#44; to<lb/> the necessity of making the religion of the Jews a<lb/> primary not a secondary consideration.</p>
				<p>I have noticed the deep importance you feel in<lb/> the establishment of schools where from the cradle</p>
			<pb n="2R"/>
				<p>the infant Israelite will write with all his studies a knowledge<lb/> of Judaism &#38; will have those doctrines of his faith laughed<lb/> by those who feel the importance of combining every<lb/> knowledge with a knowledge of his God &#38; will find<lb/> no opposition to his understanding clearly those dogmas<lb/> which seem now so abstruse to them because other<lb/> views clash with them from the opinions gathered<lb/> from their Christian teachers.  While writing I am<lb/> annoyed by the feu de fore<add>&#63;</add> which ushers in the birth of<lb/> <persName>Christ</persName>&#59; how inconsistent it appears to me that the<lb/> Birth of their Savior should be celebrated by the firing<lb/> of Canons &#38; Guns as if it were a <hi rend="underline">National Victory</hi>&#33;<lb/>  Marriages &#38; deaths go on in our circle the latter by<lb/> far the most frequent for unlike our pristine parents<lb/> our &#40;fancied&#41; wants are so numerous that poor young<lb/> men are afraid to enter into a state which requires<lb/> such ample means to render it pleasant&#33;  This will be hand<lb/>ed you by my eldest son who goes on for business<lb/> not pleasure still I trust he will find time to be<lb/> acquainted with some of my friends.  He is reserved to<lb/> strangers &#38; like his mother his &#8220;<hi rend="underline">light is hid</hi> under a<lb/> bushel.&#8221; <persName>S A</persName> &#38; <persName>Jeff</persName> beg to be remembered.  I should<lb/> like to introduce you to all my Jewels for like<lb/> the mothers of <placeName>Israel</placeName> they are all my wealth.<lb/>  If this hurried scratch will meet with sufficient<lb/> attention&#44; I shall be pleased with a reply for I would<lb/> not let <persName>Philip</persName> go without informing you however<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> you have been that a son of <hi rend="underline">mine</hi> was in<lb/> your city.  Yrs truly but in haste</p>
