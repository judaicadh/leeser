            <p rend="indent(2)">It may appear strange to you<lb/> to be troubled with my
                correspondence, but there<lb/> are times in a man's life, which prompt him<lb/> to
                do that which at other times he would not, this<lb/> is the case with me. I am ready
                to make any<lb/> sacrifices to illicit truth. Truth is my motto<lb/> I have long had
                reason to feel very angry<lb/> at your conduct towards me. from the very hour<lb/> I
                set my foot on the American Shore you<lb/> openly declared yourself my
                opponent—you<lb/> wrote and spoke against me, and you did<lb/> more you vilified and
                maligned my public<lb/> and private character, and would if you<lb/> could have
                injured my prospects in this free<lb/> Country—my ability and Talents as a
                Teacher<lb/> of God's word you could not defy for in that<lb/> respect my name of
                old stands high in the<lb/> List—and the people will judge for themselves<lb/> &amp;
                came therefore to the conclusion that it was<lb/> in your part as well as others of
                the Clergy<lb/> nothing else but jealousy in a literary point<lb/> of view, and to
                crush me was the main object<lb/> of all your proceedings—but it happily failed!</p>

            <p>2) wish there few remarks which you see are candid on<lb/> my part—let me notice in
                the first instance, that<lb/> up to the present Hour I cannot unravel the<lb/>
                mystery why you should have so inveterate an<lb/> objection to me. I often ask
                myself the question<lb/> what can the reason be? I have never harmed<lb/>
                <persName>Mr Leeser</persName>, nor have I thought I could do so—<lb/> In looking at
                your letter to me of <date>Sept 5612</date> which<lb/> breathes a spirit of kindness
                and good feeling, and<lb/> the amicable disposition with which we met each<lb/> at
                the <add>חנוך</add> at <placeName>Syracuse</placeName>, where I officiated as<lb/>
                <add>חזן</add>
                <persName>Dr Raphale</persName> preached—I cannot but be<lb/> astonished at the
                Report you spread of me when<lb/> I met you at <placeName>Charleston</placeName> in
                the following Winter<lb/> when that Report reached me, knowing that I care<lb/> defy
                the whole world as to my character of the<lb/> truth be adhered to I lost no time in
                sending<lb/> without delay to <placeName>Europe</placeName> all that you said of
                me<lb/> in the name of <persName>Dr Raphale</persName> and by the next<lb/> mail I
                received a Document from the <add>בית דין</add><lb/> of
                    <placeName>London</placeName> proving at once all such Reports to<lb/> be
                false—and while yet at <placeName>Charleston</placeName> I wrote to<lb/>
                <persName>Dr Raphale</persName> calling upon him to state which<lb/> he know of me,
                and to say why He did report<lb/> those things which you said came from him<lb/>
