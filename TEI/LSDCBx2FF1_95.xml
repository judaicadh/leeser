            <p rend="indent(1)">Dear Sir:</p>
            <p rend="indent(2)">I received yours of late date by last steamer and conveyed the<lb/>
                various respects to your friends as desired. <persName>Mr. Mason's</persName> Estate
                I regret to inform<lb/> you will not pay even borrowed money &amp; therefore you can
                scarcely expect pay.<lb/> However I will do my utmost.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Relative to your letter about ministers let me explain.
                    <persName>Dr. Eckman</persName> came<lb/> out here on his own hook &amp;
                unexpectedly. When he married me in <placeName>N. O.</placeName> I gave him<lb/> no
                encouragement for I knew he would not suit our people. I then heard from<lb/>
                <persName>Mr. Gutheim</persName> that a friend of his would probably be taken up.
                    <persName>Dr. E.</persName> knew this,<lb/> but took the chances. He was not
                elected here until we heard <persName>Dr. Steinberg</persName><lb/> could or would
                not come, for what reasons we are childishly ignorant. <persName>Dr. E.</persName>
                only<lb/> received 26 votes, the 7 others blank. The salary of $3500 was reduced
                to<lb/> $2000, &amp; the term of 3 years was reduced to <hi rend="underline"
                    >one</hi>. Even at these sacrifices the<lb/> few who upheld him found it
                difficult to elect him &amp; we had to debate &amp; debate<lb/> until eleven o'clock
                at night &amp; by skill and ingenuity crowd down the opposi-<lb/>tion. The sequel
                will prove how worthy he has repaid them their labor. I was,<lb/> when I saw no
                other minister on hand, eager to take up the <persName>Doctor</persName> in order
                that<lb/> as a synagogue we might have a head &amp; a respectable one. My father,
                    <persName>Louis</persName>, <persName>Cohn</persName>,<lb/>
                <persName>Sam</persName>, <persName>Marx</persName> &amp; others will attest how
                earnestly we labored together &amp; fought the<lb/>
                <persName>Doctor</persName> through.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Previous to the building of the Synagogues which exist at
                present<lb/> we had one Shochet &amp; each congregation paid $12.50 per month, &amp;
                the butchers so<lb/> much per head, making it sufficient to support a man, but
                lately the increase<lb/> in the butcher business has been so good that our
                congregation determined to<lb/> suspend the payment of $12.50 &amp; of licensing two
                Shochtim, as the revenue proved<lb/> to be by examining the butchers themselves,
                over two hundred and fifty dollars<lb/> per month, and in case of <hi
                    rend="underline">sickness</hi> one could resume the other's position. We<lb/>
                gave no preferences, no recommendations. We appointed <persName>Mr.
                    Messenger</persName> &amp; <persName>Mr. Gold-<lb/>smith</persName> and allowed
                butchers to select their own<lb/> Shochet, of the two, <persName>Mr. M.</persName>
                However belonging to our Synagogue and <persName>Mr. G.</persName> to<lb/> the
                Polish. <persName>Mr. M.</persName> came to us with 3 Robolahs from
                    <placeName>Europe</placeName> and superior<lb/> recommendations. I myself would
                not vote for both until I carefully examined<lb/> &amp; found the business would
                support two. When we sent to <persName>Dr. Eckman</persName> to examine<lb/> these
                men he refused to examine <persName>Mr. Messenger</persName> &amp; sent us a long
                article about<lb/> the necessary requisitions for Schochet, failing, however, to
                tell us that<lb/>
                <persName>Mr. M.</persName> had not proved competent. We replied (<persName>Dr.
                    Eckman</persName> was then &amp; is now<lb/> boarding at <persName>Mr.
                    Goldsmith</persName>) that as <persName>Dr. E.</persName> wishes such a standard
                for Shochtim &amp;<lb/> we the trustees believed no man in
                    <placeName>California</placeName> was competent to stand the test<lb/> &amp; we
                must have a Shochet rather than none, such as we have always had, we<lb/> appointed
                three of our Congregation to examine the candidates, men who always<lb/> examined
                them, previous to the arrival of <persName>Dr. Eckman</persName> in
                    <placeName>California</placeName>. These men<lb/> examined <persName>Mr.
                    Messinger</persName> and pronounced him skilfull &amp; highly competent.
                    <persName>Mr. Gold-<lb/>smith</persName> sent us a communication which evidently
                was dictated by the<lb/>
                <persName>Doctor</persName>, saying in short he would not be examined by those men.
                Wherefore the<lb/> Trustees rescinded his appointment. What was our astonishment to
                find <persName>Dr. E.</persName><lb/> publish a card in the morning papers
                nullifying the act of the Trustees, who<lb/> created him, and pronouncing against us
                &amp; in favor of a foreign congregation with-<lb/> out our knowledge &amp; consent
                &amp; virtually injuring <hi rend="underline">a man</hi> whom <hi rend="underline"
                    >he</hi> did not <hi rend="underline">deign</hi> to<lb/> question. <persName>Dr.
                    E.</persName> said he did not keep his <date>Sabbaths</date> previous to
                election, whereas<lb/> we know it was utterly out of his power to do so as his bread
                depended on it.<lb/>
                <persName>Dr. E.</persName> has been coalesced with Shochet
                    <persName>Goldsmith</persName> &amp; has violently opposed his own congregation.
                A Trustee meeting is to be held &amp; they are the <persName>Doctors</persName>
                warmest<lb/> supporters. I learn they intend to request the
                    <persName>Doctor</persName> to resign. He who was so</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p rend="align(center)">-2-</p>
            <p>unpopular &amp; was elected by such a struggle &amp; such sacrifices has in 6
                short<lb/> weeks make himself outrageously inimical to the whole congregation. I
                hear but<lb/> two opinions, one asking him to resign, the other dismissing him from
                his post.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">In a country it was in the <persName>Doctor's</persName> province to
                endear himself<lb/> to a warm &amp; ardent congregation, but he has chosen the
                opposite. Yesterday in<lb/> conversation the <persName>Doctor</persName> was advised
                by my father and myself to be careful of his<lb/> actions that the congregation were
                very uneasy about the Shochet matter &amp; his<lb/> position &amp; <hi
                    rend="underline">might</hi> censure him. He said on that subject he courted
                their censure<lb/> &amp; forthwith proclaimed to the world through the papers that
                we were all fools &amp;<lb/> knew not what we did that our Shochet was no Shochet
                &amp; his Shechilah to be<lb/> Terephah. (see publication).</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I enclose you the publication with the notes there that seem
                proper.<lb/> I regret this matter on the <persName>Doctor's</persName> account.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I regret to add <persName>Dr.'s</persName> statement is false in
                many respects, as probably<lb/> his information was derived from <persName>Mr.
                    Goldsmith</persName>.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">In the first place the <persName>Doctor</persName> is not legally
                our Rabbi, he never was<lb/> so elected.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">In the second, <persName><sic>Dr.E.</sic></persName> never
                questioned <persName>Messinger</persName>, but merely listened<lb/> to calummy.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">In the third, he had no recourse to any expedient. The Trustees
                did<lb/> so authorize him to appear before the three members without <persName>Mr.
                    Messinger</persName><lb/> being aware of their action.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">In the fourth, the Congregation have adopted to eat meat of no
                other<lb/> Shochet than <persName>Messinger</persName> &amp; we boast as religious
                men as any in the world,<lb/> perhaps not more so.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">There will be a sequel to this of which I shall keep you
                advised.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Upon these remarks you may be certain <persName>Dr. E.</persName>
                cannot be reelected<lb/> at the end of the year &amp; if you know of any competent
                minister who of their<lb/> own accord or at your suggestion will visit
                    <placeName>San Francisco</placeName> &amp; when here will act<lb/> prudently
                they would do well to come out.</p>
