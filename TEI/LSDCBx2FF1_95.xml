				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>San Francisco</placeName>&#44; <date>Dec. 19.1854</date>.</p>
				<p><addressee>Rev. Isaac Leeser</addressee></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Dear Sir&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">I received yours of late date by last steamer and conveyed the<lb/> various respects to your friends as desired.  <persName>Mr. Mason&#39;s</persName> Estate I regret to inform<lb/> you will not pay even borrowed money &#38; therefore you can scarcely expect pay.<lb/>  However I will do my utmost.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Relative to your letter about ministers let me explain.  <persName>Dr. Eckman</persName> came<lb/> out here on his own hook &#38; unexpectedly.  When he married me in <placeName>N. O.</placeName> I gave him<lb/> no encouragement for I knew he would not suit our people.  I then heard from<lb/> <persName>Mr. Gutheim</persName> that a friend of his would probably be taken up.  <persName>Dr. E.</persName> knew this&#44;<lb/> but took the chances.  He was not elected here until we heard <persName>Dr. Steinberg</persName><lb/> could or would not come&#44; for what reasons we are childishly ignorant.  <persName>Dr. E.</persName> only<lb/> received 26 votes&#44; the 7 others blank.  The salary of &#36;3500 was reduced to<lb/> &#36;2000&#44; &#38; the term of 3 years was reduced to <hi rend="underline">one</hi>.  Even at these sacrifices the<lb/> few who upheld him found it difficult to elect him &#38; we had to debate &#38; debate<lb/> until eleven o&#39;clock at night &#38; by skill and ingenuity crowd down the opposi&#45;<lb/>tion.  The sequel will prove how worthy he has repaid them their labor.  I was&#44;<lb/> when I saw no other minister on hand&#44; eager to take up the <persName>Doctor</persName> in order that<lb/> as a synagogue we might have a head &#38; a respectable one.  My father&#44; <persName>Louis</persName>&#44; <persName>Cohn</persName>&#44;<lb/> <persName>Sam</persName>&#44; <persName>Marx</persName> &#38; others will attest how earnestly we labored together &#38; fought the<lb/> <persName>Doctor</persName> through.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Previous to the building of the Synagogues which exist at present<lb/> we had one Shochet &#38; each congregation paid &#36;12.50 per month&#44; &#38; the butchers so<lb/> much per head&#44; making it sufficient to support a man&#44; but lately the increase<lb/> in the butcher business has been so good that our congregation determined to<lb/> suspend the payment of &#36;12.50 &#38; of licensing two Shochtim&#44; as the revenue proved<lb/> to be by examining the butchers themselves&#44; over two hundred and fifty dollars<lb/> per month&#44; and in case of <hi rend="underline">sickness</hi> one could resume the other&#39;s position.  We<lb/> gave no preferences&#44; no recommendations.  We appointed <persName>Mr. Messenger</persName> &#38; <persName>Mr. Gold&#45;<lb/>smith</persName> and allowed butchers to select their own<lb/> Shochet&#44; of the two&#44; <persName>Mr. M.</persName> However belonging to our Synagogue and <persName>Mr. G.</persName> to<lb/> the Polish.  <persName>Mr. M.</persName> came to us with 3 Robolahs from <placeName>Europe</placeName> and superior<lb/> recommendations.  I myself would not vote for both until I carefully examined<lb/> &#38; found the business would support two.  When we sent to <persName>Dr. Eckman</persName> to examine<lb/> these men he refused to examine <persName>Mr. Messenger</persName> &#38; sent us a long article about<lb/> the necessary requisitions for Schochet&#44; failing&#44; however&#44; to tell us that<lb/> <persName>Mr. M.</persName> had not proved competent.  We replied &#40;<persName>Dr. Eckman</persName> was then &#38; is now<lb/> boarding at <persName>Mr. Goldsmith</persName>&#41; that as <persName>Dr. E.</persName> wishes such a standard for Shochtim &#38;<lb/> we the trustees believed no man in <placeName>California</placeName> was competent to stand the test<lb/> &#38; we must have a Shochet rather than none&#44; such as we have always had&#44; we<lb/> appointed three of our Congregation to examine the candidates&#44; men who always<lb/> examined them&#44; previous to the arrival of <persName>Dr. Eckman</persName> in <placeName>California</placeName>.  These men<lb/> examined <persName>Mr. Messinger</persName> and pronounced him skilfull &#38; highly competent.  <persName>Mr. Gold&#45;<lb/>smith</persName> sent us a communication which evidently was dictated by the<lb/> <persName>Doctor</persName>&#44; saying in short he would not be examined by those men.  Wherefore the<lb/> Trustees rescinded his appointment.  What was our astonishment to find <persName>Dr. E.</persName><lb/> publish a card in the morning papers nullifying the act of the Trustees&#44; who<lb/> created him&#44; and pronouncing against us &#38; in favor of a foreign congregation with&#45;<lb/> out our knowledge &#38; consent &#38; virtually injuring <hi rend="underline">a man</hi> whom <hi rend="underline">he</hi> did not <hi rend="underline">deign</hi> to<lb/> question.  <persName>Dr. E.</persName> said he did not keep his <date>Sabbaths</date> previous to election&#44; whereas<lb/> we know it was utterly out of his power to do so as his bread depended on it.<lb/>  <persName>Dr. E.</persName> has been coalesced with Shochet <persName>Goldsmith</persName> &#38; has violently opposed his own congregation.  A Trustee meeting is to be held &#38; they are the <persName>Doctors</persName> warmest<lb/> supporters.  I learn they intend to request the <persName>Doctor</persName> to resign.  He who was so</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">&#45;2&#45;</p>
				<p>unpopular &#38; was elected by such a struggle &#38; such sacrifices has in 6 short<lb/> weeks make himself outrageously inimical to the whole congregation.  I hear but<lb/> two opinions&#44; one asking him to resign&#44; the other dismissing him from his post.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In a country it was in the <persName>Doctor&#39;s</persName> province to endear himself<lb/> to a warm &#38; ardent congregation&#44; but he has chosen the opposite.  Yesterday in<lb/> conversation the <persName>Doctor</persName> was advised by my father and myself to be careful of his<lb/> actions that the congregation were very uneasy about the Shochet matter &#38; his<lb/> position &#38; <hi rend="underline">might</hi> censure him.  He said on that subject he courted their censure<lb/> &#38; forthwith proclaimed to the world through the papers that we were all fools &#38;<lb/> knew not what we did that our Shochet was no Shochet &#38; his Shechilah to be<lb/> Terephah. &#40;see publication&#41;.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I enclose you the publication with the notes there that seem proper.<lb/>  I regret this matter on the <persName>Doctor&#39;s</persName> account.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I regret to add <persName>Dr.&#39;s</persName> statement is false in many respects&#44; as probably<lb/> his information was derived from <persName>Mr. Goldsmith</persName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In the first place the <persName>Doctor</persName> is not legally our Rabbi&#44; he never was<lb/> so elected.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In the second&#44; <persName><sic>Dr.E.</sic></persName> never questioned <persName>Messinger</persName>&#44; but merely listened<lb/> to calummy.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In the third&#44; he had no recourse to any expedient.  The Trustees did<lb/> so authorize him to appear before the three members without <persName>Mr. Messinger</persName><lb/> being aware of their action.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In the fourth&#44; the Congregation have adopted to eat meat of no other<lb/> Shochet than <persName>Messinger</persName> &#38; we boast as religious men as any in the world&#44;<lb/> perhaps not more so.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">There will be a sequel to this of which I shall keep you advised.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Upon these remarks you may be certain <persName>Dr. E.</persName> cannot be reelected<lb/> at the end of the year &#38; if you know of any competent minister who of their<lb/> own accord or at your suggestion will visit <placeName>San Francisco</placeName> &#38; when here will act<lb/> prudently they would do well to come out.</p>
			<p rend="indent(10)">Yrs truly</p>
			<p rend="indent(8)">&#40;signed&#41;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<persName role="author">H. I. Sabatto</persName>.</p>
