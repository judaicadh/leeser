			<p rend="indent(1)">having attended the late Advent Lectures<lb/> in the Great Tent&#44; at <persName>Niblo&#39;s</persName>&#44; <placeName>Corner of Broadway<lb/> and Prince Streets</placeName>&#44; more or less during eight of the<lb/> ten days of their continuance&#44; having given par&#45;<lb/>ticular attention to the doctrines promulgated&#44;<lb/> and being enabled without difficulty to detect the<lb/> material errors of those doctrines&#44; I report for<lb/> publication&#44; my views&#44; stated in few <del>words with</del><lb/> <del>sim</del> and plain words.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The Adventists are a class of preachers&#44;<lb/> who have undertaken to enlighten their fellow&#45;men<lb/> upon Religion&#44; substantially according to the opinions<lb/> of one <persName>William Miller</persName>&#44; a worthy old farmer&#44; who<lb/> possessing some good faculties for the investigation<lb/> and comprehension of the prophecies in the Bible af<lb/>ter diligent application to the subject&#44; came to the ra&#45;<lb/>tional conclusion that we are at the eve of a very<lb/> important chap in mundane affairs as under<lb/> the influence of Divine Government.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><del>And</del> Here let me promise that all observ&#45;<lb/>ing and reflecting minds generally <del>are fast com&#45;</del><lb/> <del>ing</del> which have been turned to the matter&#44; are fast<lb/> coming to opinions consonant in some measure to that of the good<lb/> <persName>Mr. Miller</persName>&#44; whether their conclusions be drawn from<lb/> <del>Holy Traits&#44; from</del> reflections upon Holy Writ&#44; from behold<lb/>ing the recklessness of the age&#44; or from contem&#45;<lb/>plating the surprising developments of physical progress.</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">2</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">What the Adventists preach&#44; and uphold their<lb/> confidence in&#44; as the forthcoming event of such mag&#45;<lb/>nitude and importance&#44; is the actual coming&#44; ap&#45;<lb/>pearance&#44; presence and being in the body&#44; of <persName>Jesus<lb/> Christ</persName>&#44; upon this earth&#44; whose business&#44; according<lb/> to their discourses&#44; it will be to rule and govern<lb/> in money and justice&#44; first making some mer&#45;<lb/>ited disposal of all the wicked people&#44; and<lb/> the presiding in wisdom and goodness over the<lb/> remainder&#44; whom the Adventists denominate <hi rend="underline">the</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">Saints</hi>&#44; and <del>first and foremost</del> among whom are<lb/> to be the Adventists themselves.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Without undertaking here to declare any creed<lb/> or peculiar religious belief as especially my own&#44;<lb/> I am ready to confute the Adventists upon their<lb/> own ground&#59; and while my hand is in&#44; I even<lb/> extend the offer of defiance to the advocates of<lb/> any and every set of opinions or fancies under the guise<lb/> of Religion&#44; which recognize the benefit of preaching as<lb/> preferable to practice&#44; of vain imagination before some<lb/> sense&#44; of persuading or terrifying others rather than re&#45;<lb/>forming one&#39;s own conduct&#44; of investigating the future instead<lb/> of diligently using the present time&#44; of indulging folly and<lb/> pride in lieu of disciplining the mind to reverence and humility&#44;<lb/> of running after the <del>vanities of</del> pernicious vanities<lb/> of the world&#44; and not attending with every faculty to<lb/> that one only good principle&#44; which is called the sovereign<lb/> will of God.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">If any would ask why I take upon myself to</p>
			<pb n="5"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">3</p>
				<p>discuss these important matters&#44; while censuring<lb/> in others the public advocacy of their peculiar<lb/> views&#44; let all such <del>persons</del> inquirers distinctly un&#45;<lb/>derstand that I object not to the promulgation of<lb/> any well&#45;intended doctrine&#59; I only endeavour to prevent<lb/> a false &#38; <del>foolish doctrine</del> absurd set of opinions from taking <sic>inspirious</sic> effect<lb/> upon the public mind.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The Adventists&#44; in their lectures&#44; read us certain<lb/> passages of scripture&#44; make their comments&#44; which are<lb/> for the most part rational&#44; declare their interpre&#45;<lb/>tations&#44; which are <del>clearly</del> in a great measure correct&#44;<lb/> and draw their conclusions&#44; which are mainly <hi rend="underline">wrong</hi>.  They<lb/> profess to adhere closely to the letter or <sic>naturel</sic> mean&#45;<lb/>ing of the quoted words and phrases&#59; and&#44; so far as<lb/> they <hi rend="underline">do</hi> abide by the literal meaning&#44; their inferences<lb/> appear to be correct&#59; but the substituting of their own<lb/> false and imaginary notions for the evident and<lb/> perfectly simple and <sic>indeniable</sic> meaning of the most<lb/> important words and expressions&#44; is what leads them<lb/> into wildly ridiculous errors.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The primitive cause of the false conceptions with<lb/> which these gentlemen are so grievously misled&#44; may like all other errors of the human intellect&#44; be<lb/> found in their impurity of mind&#44; vanity&#44; prejudice&#44; self&#45;righteousness and<lb/> imcharitableness<add>&#63;</add>.  Of this I will give sufficient instances<lb/> before going farther&#44; in citing the simple fact that&#44; while<lb/> uttering their doctrines in all devotional sincerity&#44; they<lb/> unhesitatingly allude to the Papal power as <hi rend="underline">Antichrist</hi>&#44;<lb/> and to the Jews&#44; the lineal descendants of <persName>Abraham</persName><lb/> who observe the laws of <persName>Moses</persName>&#44; as a God&#45;forsaken</p>
			<pb n="7"/>

				<p>people hardly worthy of human sympathy or comment.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">One of the late Advent sermons was preached from<lb/> the text <persName><sic>Zechariah</sic></persName> VIII.23. <del>&#8220;Thus saith</del></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">&#8220;Thus saith the Lord of hosts&#44; In those days <del>te</del><lb/> it shall come to pass that ten men shall take hold&#44;<lb/> out of all languages of the nations&#44; even shall take<lb/> hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew&#44; saying&#44; We<lb/> will go with you&#59; for we have heard that God is<lb/> with you.&#8221;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">It would seem&#44; to a person of plain common<lb/> sense&#44; very easy to understand the meaning of this<lb/> text&#44; just as it is written&#44; allowing only for the figuration ex&#45;<lb/>pression &#8220;take<del>ing</del> hold of the skirt&#44;&#8221; after the preacher<lb/> had made it evident&#44; &#40;as he did tolerably well&#44;&#41;<lb/> that the expression &#8220;those days&#8221; was meant for<lb/> the present time&#44; even on or close about the present<lb/> day and hour of the year <date>1847</date>.  A plain man of<lb/> ordinary intelligence would then understand that&#44;<lb/> at or about the present time&#44; many <del>most</del> people would<lb/> get an idea that <hi rend="underline">the Jews</hi> are in possession<lb/> of the true&#44; original and vital doctrine of Religion&#59;<lb/> but&#44; under the declaration of these learned gentle&#45;<lb/>men&#44; the scripture is not held to mean what<lb/> it says&#58; according to them the word <hi rend="underline">Jew</hi> does<lb/> not mean <hi rend="underline">Jew</hi>&#44; it means <hi rend="underline">Adventist</hi>&#33;  Yet these<lb/> learned gentlemen preachers loudly <del>sustain</del><lb/> oral advocate literal <del>meanings&#44; interpretation</del> readings&#44; and <del>main&#45;</del><lb/> <del>tain</del> proclaim that every passage of scripture is<lb/> best illustrated by its context.  If&#44; then&#44; the word</p>
			<pb n="9"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">5</p>
				<p><hi rend="underline">Jew</hi> required any explanation as to its meaning&#44;<lb/> such explanation should be sought in the rest of<lb/> the writings of the same author <persName>Zechariah</persName>.  Let<lb/> any one&#44; then&#44; search there&#44; to see if there be any<lb/> reason to think that the prophet&#44; when he said<lb/> &#8220;him that is a Jew&#8221;&#44; meant any thing but such a person as one<lb/> should understand to the appellation <hi rend="underline">a perfect <sic>jew</sic></hi>&#44;<lb/> that is an Israelite by birth&#44; circumcised&#44; and who strictly observes<lb/> &#38; always has observed the injunctions of his religion according to his best<lb/> ability.  If the reader have not time to search<lb/> through the fourteen chapters of <persName>Zechariah</persName>&#44; he may<lb/> <del>even</del> satisfy his mind by reading the eighth chapter<lb/> alone&#44; which ends with the above&#45;quoted verse.  The<lb/> whole scope and aim of the chapter is clearly to <sic>de&#45;</sic><lb/> declare that God will allow his chosen people the Jews<lb/> to return and dwell happily in and about <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>.<lb/>  The condition is simply that they properly reform them&#45;<lb/>selves&#59; and as to the time when&#44; <del>the Adv</del> our friends<lb/> the Adventists very clearly make it out to be just<lb/> about the present day.  <hi rend="underline">Amen</hi> say I&#44; in full<lb/> confidence that every one who answers the prophets<lb/> character of &#8220;him that is a Jew&#44;&#8221; will heartily join me.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Hear the prophet &#8220;These are the things that ye shall<lb/> do&#59; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour&#59; exe<lb/>cute the judgment of <hi rend="underline">truth</hi> and <hi rend="underline">peace</hi> in your gates&#59;<lb/> and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts a<lb/>gainst his neighbour&#59; and love no false oath&#59; for all<lb/> these things I hate&#44; saith the Lord.&#8221;</p>
			<pb n="11"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">6</p>
				<p>How will these simple precepts tally with the<lb/> supposition of the Adventists&#44; that they them<lb/>selves are the subjects of this contemplated king&#45;<lb/>dom&#63;  They who&#44; professing entire confidence in<lb/> the immediate coming of their Saviour&#44; as King<lb/> and Governor&#44; manifest such deep and<lb/> hateful apprehension when they detail the<lb/> immense projects and arrangements of &#40;their<lb/> imaginary Antichrist&#41; the Roman Catholic Church&#44; for<lb/> bringing all men under the influence of<lb/> the gospel.  The Adventists admit that<lb/> the Jesuits are a people self&#45;sacrificing in<lb/> order to do good&#44; that they are endeavouring<lb/> to establish learning and discipline&#44; to ame<lb/>liorate the condition of the poor&#44; and to extend<lb/> the knowledge of Religion to the heathen.<lb/>  Why&#44; then&#44; whatever may be their failings&#8212;<lb/> human failings such as <del>we are</del> all men are subject<lb/> to&#8212;may we not contemplate their efforts<lb/> with rejoicing in kindness and charity&#63;<lb/>  I&#44; the humble writer&#44; am accountable to the Giver of all good<lb/> for as clear <del>perfect</del> an understanding as is commonly<lb/> allotted to man&#44; even after the exercises of<lb/> prayer&#44; penitence and reformation&#8212;<del>not to</del><lb/> and I for one know of no human influence compara<lb/>ble to that of kindness&#44; no persuasive equal<lb/> to <del>good</del> behaviour&#44; and no doctrine better<lb/> than that of <hi rend="underline">plain goodness</hi>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">When the Adventists come to the word <hi rend="underline">Jeru</hi></p>
				<p rend="The following word continues on the next page."><placeName>Jerusalem</placeName></p>
			<pb n="13"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">7</p>
				<p><hi rend="underline">salem</hi>&#44; they often represent its meaning to be an ima<lb/>ginary location wherein &#8220;<hi rend="underline">the saints</hi>&#8221; are forthwith to reign on earth.<lb/>  These <hi rend="underline">saints</hi>&#44; we understand from them&#44; are to be the<lb/> Adventists themselves and such other persons as may<lb/> be found&#44; at the time of the descent of the Saviour upon<lb/> earth&#44; to be most zealously believing those portions<lb/> of the doctrine in vogue as of the New Testament&#44;&#8212;<lb/> which are most difficult of comprehension&#44; and<lb/> of least immediate practical adaptation to the every&#45;day<lb/> business of ordinary life.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The Adventists tell us that these saints<lb/> are to &#8220;<hi rend="underline">reign</hi>&#8221;&#59; but at the same time declare that they<lb/> are to be true Christians.  Now it is perfectly<lb/> clear to every one who derives his religious prin<lb/>ciples from the New Testament&#44; that the true<lb/> Christian is properly one who does not &#8220;<hi rend="underline">reign</hi>&#8221;<lb/> at all upon earth&#44; save over himself&#44; his own<lb/> passions and erroneous propensities&#44; in the<lb/> humble endeavour to effect positive good&#44;<lb/> he being thereto actuated by a perfect&#44; tone&#44; rever<lb/>ence and fear of the over riding Providence which<lb/> creates and controls all&#44; such Christian necessarily<lb/> fully believing in the one only and vital Jewish doc<lb/>trine&#44; that&#44; for the wrong we do&#44; we are inevitably<lb/> punished&#44;  save as Divine mercy may be extended<lb/> to us solely in case of thorough repentance and per<lb/>fect resolution and endeavour to always in future<lb/> learn and do that which is right in the view of God&#44;<lb/> our Lord and maker.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">But what I understand by the word <hi rend="underline"><placeName>Jerusalem</placeName></hi></p>
			<pb n="15"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">8</p>
				<p>is what every reasonable and unprejudiced mind<lb/> must understand namely what the prophet meant<lb/>&#8212;and that is <hi rend="underline"><placeName>Jerusalem</placeName></hi>&#44; the ancient city of the<lb/> Jews&#44; which is now in ruins&#44; and which must be<lb/> rebuilt&#44; in order to the verification of the term<lb/> <placeName><hi rend="underline">New</hi> Jerusalem</placeName>.<del><persName role="author">Rex</persName></del>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">This word <hi rend="underline"><placeName>New Jerusalem</placeName></hi> is a favourite one of our<lb/> imaginative friends&#44; the Adventists&#59; but their mode of re&#45;<lb/>building a destroyed city merely by preaching and praying and<lb/> singing&#44; <del>to have</del> has never proved effectual.  <hi rend="underline">We must put</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">our shoulder to the wheel</hi>&#44; as&#44; according to the fable&#44; Hercules<lb/> commanded the <sic>waggoner</sic>.  The Adventists&#44; as well as most<lb/> other religious sects&#44; have a great deal to say about <hi rend="underline">Faith</hi>&#59;<lb/> the best faith is that which most usefully controls one&#39;s<lb/> actions&#44; and the best evidence of faith is the shutting<lb/> up the mouth and taking hold to do with all our<lb/> might that which is evidently right and best to be<lb/> done.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">About these Jews&#44; whom our friends the Adventists<lb/> <del>think</del> make so little of&#59; possibly some of those unassuming<lb/> and discreet minds who think that perfect wisdom reigns<lb/> in the will <del>councils</del> of the Deity&#44; may conceive that the chosen<lb/> people have now sufficiently expiated their national sins&#44;<lb/> and that they have but individually to turn unto the Lord<lb/> with all their hearts&#44; to obtain the blessing recorded<lb/> throughout the scriptures as their inheritance&#44; and to<lb/> stand a holy people&#44; and a living monument&#44; and<lb/> evidence of the truth of prophetic revelations.  <hi rend="underline">Nous verrons.</hi></p>
