            <p rend="indent(2)">Dear Sir</p>
            <p rend="indent(3)">Imagination fertile in ways of<lb/> tormenting as well as in ways of
                blessing, has fitted my<lb/> mind with many fears as to the construction you
                would<lb/> place on my silence; &amp; therefore has caused me to be silent<lb/> when
                duty &amp; inclination both prompted me to reply.<lb/> You seem to think that I have
                much leisure at command<lb/> but you are mistaken I often cannot command an hour
                in<lb/> the 24 to appropriate to myself &amp; truly when your letter<lb/> arrived I
                had mind &amp; body so much occupied (&amp; not pleasantly<lb/> either) that I
                    <sic>defered</sic> writing until I was in a better frame<lb/> of mind &amp; when
                I could I felt like a guilty one that had<lb/> not firmness to confess her fault.
                Better feelings have come over<lb/> me &amp; if you will accept the Assurance that
                indifference did<lb/> not <sic>actuated</sic> me &amp; that I will do better in
                future. I will<lb/> be again the punctual correspondent you were wont to call<lb/>
                me. When you judge I have a great deal of leisure you<lb/> no doubt identify in me a
                Southern Woman &amp; one of<lb/> easy circumstances; now let me undeceive you I <hi
                    rend="underline">am neither</hi>,<lb/> although born, at the
                    <placeName>South</placeName>; I have none of the indolence<lb/> unjustly
                attributed to us—nor the means to indulge in it, if<lb/> I wished. I have the charge
                of a large family, have many<lb/> responsibilities, besides; have many pecuniary
                troubles, Educate<lb/> two children at home, do all my own needle work; but<lb/>
                above all: am in a society far above my means &amp; among<lb/> the like of
                    <placeName>Augusta</placeName>. This latter circumstance, obliges me</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>to fritter away many hours that might be more profitably<lb/> employed; and I am only
                reconciled to doing so, from the reflection<lb/> that I neglect no duty (for writing
                you is a pleasure) my business<lb/> correspondents all find me punctual &amp; I
                should deprive my<lb/> children of much pleasure &amp; many advantages did I
                seclude<lb/> myself from the world! You cannot tell, you cannot comprehend<lb/> what
                sacrifices a <add>?</add> mother is capable of making for<lb/> her offspring!
                Besides you know I love reading &amp; mine is a most<lb/>
                <sic>heterogenous</sic> mass! I have injured my eyes so much, by reading<lb/> late
                at night, that I now have to use glasses. I can honestly<lb/> affirm, that unless in
                society that from 6 in the morning until<lb/> 10 at night &amp; some times 12 I am
                never unoccupied. I have been<lb/> thus explanatory, for your letter would infer,
                that I plead an<lb/> excuse for my indolence! Now that is not my besetting sin<lb/>
                I assure you! What it is, I shall leave one of your pendration<lb/> to discover. My
                two daughters are gone to <placeName>Charleston</placeName>,
                    <persName>Set</persName> to<lb/> be bridesmaid, at her cousins wedding &amp;
                    <persName>Rose</persName> to pass some time<lb/> with her grandparents.
                    <persName>Set</persName> intended replying to your letter but<lb/> preparations
                for her departure have prevented; she will<lb/> write you from
                    <placeName>Charleston</placeName>. The criticism on the dying Hebrew<lb/> will I
                fear deter the young aspirant from other communication<lb/> for the present. I do
                not doubt their justice but few have energy<lb/> to bear up against the criticism of
                one so capable as your<lb/>-self. Why have no numbers but the 1<hi rend="sup"
                    >st</hi> &amp; 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> of the miscellany<lb/> been published? I
                am glad, that you have completed the 2<lb/> last numbers of the Pentateuch. Believe
                me my dear friend<lb/> poverty, brings no deeper sting to me, than in depriving<lb/>
                me of <sic>allmost</sic> all the religious works of the present days for I<lb/>
                prize those I possess so highly; that I deeply regret I cannot<lb/> increase my
                stock of Jewish publications. We have an excellent</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>collection of books, but at the time I was able to purchase a Library<lb/> the Jews
                had sunk too deep in sloth &amp; indifference to benefit their<lb/> people. The
                Occident &amp; miscellany are the only two I feel able to sub-<lb/>scribe to,
                    <persName>Mrs Hart</persName> sends me on the Voice of Jacob (&amp; while<lb/> I
                think of it) do say to her I have received no numbers since
                    <date>Octo<lb/>ber</date>. <persName>Mrs Henry</persName> gets hers &amp;
                therefore I am no sufferer. Our Sunday<lb/> School does not increase, in numbers,
                although <persName>Mrs Henry</persName> is<lb/> indefatigable &amp; I use every
                effort to promote its well doing. Out of 8<lb/> families I have relinquished sending
                their two children, not I believe<lb/> from any cause, but because they are not
                strong in faith. The Jews<lb/> certainly are a stiffnecked race &amp; want much of
                that piety of heart,<lb/> which would bear against worldly considerations. Will you
                tell me,<lb/> whence we take the institution of having godfathers &amp; mothers: as
                I<lb/> can find no example in the bible. Do you consider it no harm to att<lb/>end
                the <sic>Theatre</sic> or a Ball or any other public amusement on the<lb/>
                <date>Sabbath</date>? Do you judge the <date>Sabbath</date> properly kept when
                spent<lb/> in gossiping from one house to another after the duty of Public<lb/>
                Worship is over? By what form are Jewesses allowed to become<lb/> members of the
                Synagogue &amp; at what age? If they are not allowed<lb/> to join <hi
                    rend="underline">at all</hi>, there can be no religious <hi rend="underline"
                    >form</hi>, which gives man the<lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">right</hi>; for certainly in no part of the Sacred book, do we
                find women<lb/> deprived of the hope of eternal salvation &amp; the same course that
                would<lb/> fit man for a celestial abode would I should hope entitle<lb/> women. Do
                you know a <persName>Miss Hendricks</persName> from
                    <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> she lives with<lb/> her aunt <persName>Mrs
                    Levy</persName>, her family reside here, she seems to be ladylike<lb/> &amp;
                industrious &amp; has much capacity for earning a support She has with<lb/> her
                sister opened a fancy store on a small scale but will I hope<lb/> do well we are
                much interested for her. She is a regular attendant<lb/> of the Sabbath School,
                where we assemble &amp; <persName>Mrs Henry</persName> &amp; myself<lb/> read the
                morning Service. We adopted this course because we found</p>
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>it would collect together the few Jewesses here &amp; the children would<lb/> be more
                deeply impressed by preparing them to attend at a given place<lb/> to hear the
                service read than in their own houses. Another motive<lb/> influenced us living
                among gentiles we were subject to interruptions<lb/> (which although I never allowed
                to interfere with me) were unpleasant</p>
            <p>I hope as soon as the duties of the <date>Passover</date> are finished you will<lb/>
                <sic>will</sic> write me a long pleasant letter to convince me the mantle<lb/> of
                Charity is always thrown over the faults of your friends<lb/> What a purifying
                festival this is if we would only cleanse our<lb/> internal house as we do our
                worldly abode there would be but<lb/> little fear of a blessed hereafter. Your
                sincere friend <persName role="author">KOM</persName></p>
