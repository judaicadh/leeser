          <p rend="indent(1)"><addressee>Revd Isaac Leeser</addressee></p>
          <p rend="indent(2)">Dear Sir&#33;</p>
			<p>I am surprised indeed to learn <sic>trough</sic> your letter&#44; received this mor<lb/>ning&#44; that you have not received my answer in return to your<lb/> letter written to me some six weeks ago. Where the fault<lb/> lays&#44; I do not know&#59; but believe me&#44; that I regard and<lb/> esteem you <sic>to</sic> highly&#44; as to suffer your friendly and interesting<lb/> correspondence to remain unanswered. A day or two after the<lb/> receipt of your former letter&#44; I tried to collect some of<lb/> your outstandings&#44; I called with very few exceptions on every<lb/> one of your old subscribers and all I could get was &#36;3.&#8212;<lb/> of <persName>Warmser</persName>&#8212;&#59; one had no money just now&#44; the other would<lb/> bring it to me in a few days&#44; a third one wanted me<lb/> to call on him&#44; when I get ready to send the money<lb/> to <placeName>Pha.</placeName> <add>&#63;</add> Wither the people is <sic>actualy</sic> so short of<lb/> money&#44; or <sic>wether</sic> they have a more pressing use for it&#44; I<lb/> cannot judge. I wrote to you this fact&#44; which commu<lb/>nication as you say did not reach you.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">In a few weeks from now&#44; as I understand&#44; in the beginning<lb/> of <date>September</date>&#44; <persName>Mr Abraham Taudler</persName> is removing with his<lb/> family to <placeName>Philada.</placeName>&#44; in the mean time I will try to collect<lb/> for you all I can get and send the same by <persName>Mr Taudler.</persName><lb/> Rest assured that I will not neglect to do in this respect<lb/> all in my power.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">Before I commenced writing this letter I went to see<lb/> <persName>Lymons</persName>&#44; but he is not in the city and as I am told by</p>
		<pb n="2"/>
			<p>his employer&#44; will not be before <date>Monday</date> next&#44; when I hope<lb/> to be enabled to settle his fault&#45;finding to your satisfaction.<lb/> I have seen this man most daily and he knows very well that<lb/> I am asking as your agent in this city&#8212;still he never spoke<lb/> a single word to me about being dissatisfied with the Occident<lb/> nor the paying of the postage.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">The Occident for <date>July</date> did not reach here before the <date>23d</date><lb/> of last month&#44; and as some of your subscribers here&#44; happening<lb/> to be in <placeName>Cinci</placeName>&#44; read there the same number two weeks before&#44;<lb/> it created some dissatisfaction as to the long delay. Who is to<lb/> account for it&#63; I went very frequently to the post&#45;office<lb/> to inquire&#44; but they could not or would not explain the matter.<lb/> Your readers&#44; the least the majority of them&#44; in this city are every<lb/> month very anxiously waiting for your valuable interesting<lb/> paper&#44; and so I would humbly advice you&#44; <del>to</del> if in your<lb/> power&#44; to cause to prevent any future delay.&#8212;</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">In my last communication I made you acquainted with<lb/> the fact and circumstances of <persName>Mr. Felsenheld&#39;s</persName> being Teacher in this<lb/> city&#44; but as you did not receive the letter&#44; I will repeat the same.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Mr. Felsenheld</persName> is not elected by the congregation&#8212;he has<lb/> started a school on his private responsibility. He is proprietary<lb/> manager and teacher. His school is attended to by about <sic>fourty</sic><lb/> pupils&#59; one Lady teacher is also in his employment. I believe<lb/> he will succeed in keeping up a good School&#44; he is very<lb/> industrious&#44; his pupils advance rapidly in Hebrew and<lb/> the religious branches&#8212;not so much <sic>tough</sic> in english&#44; as he<lb/> is not sufficiently <sic>suported</sic>. It would therefore be very desirous</p>
		<pb n="3"/>
			<p>if he could be enabled to engage a good male teacher. <persName>Mr. F.</persName> is a very un&#61;<lb/>assuming man&#44; attending to his duties as teacher solely and not mixing himself<lb/> with other people&#39;s business.</p>
			<p><persName>Mrs Warder Cresson</persName> has been here. He visited me several times. He remained here<lb/> 11 days and in the mean time lectured twice. You know the man&#44; and<lb/> so I don&#39;t need to tell you how he lectured. He sold about 30 of<lb/> his books at &#36;1.50 each.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">My own position is as it were. I think I will be re&#45;elected for another<lb/> year&#44; but it is a hard task to convince them that it would be<lb/> more proper and beneficial on both sides to elect a minister for a more<lb/> permanent term&#59; as they or the majority of them deem it their business<lb/> to out&#45;spy me&#44; and do not want me to sell them anything<lb/> which they should or should not do. I can flatter myself of po<lb/>sessing the good feelings and friendship of a large majority of my<lb/> congregators&#44; but it seems they do not want me to do any thing else<lb/> as reading the prayers &#40;allegro&#41; shechting<add>&#63;</add>&#44; and at some times so<lb/> speak on general objects without touching their religious or moral<lb/> transgressions. It sometimes indeed <sic>revoltes</sic> against my feelings<lb/> to stand there <sic>idel</sic> as an <del>unit</del> uninterested looker&#45;on&#44; compelled<lb/> to silence and checked by worldly considerations&#59; but I can&#39;t help it.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">This morning I enjoyed a visit from an old friend of mine&#44;<lb/> <persName>Mr. Aaron Dessauer</persName> of <placeName>Ci</placeName>. He told me by way of conversation&#44; that<lb/> the Broadway Kehilah in <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName> intends to appoint you&#44;<lb/> or give you a call as their Preacher and Master of the School to<lb/> be established&#44; provided you will accept it. I felt very happy to<lb/> hear it&#44; and I hope that <del>it</del> you will realize their proud desire. I<lb/> do not tell you this for any other motives&#44; <del>as</del> than to inform you</p>
		<pb n="4"/>
			<p>of the vast papuli towards you out here west&#44; and that any such<lb/> call may not find you unprepared.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Mrs. Rosenfeld</persName>&#44; whom by the by you gave in your last number<lb/> a tolerable good hit&#44; has a few days since made application<lb/> to his congregation for increase of salary&#44; he lets them know&#44;<lb/> that he cannot live with &#36;12.00 a year&#44; and that unless they<lb/> give him &#36;15.00 he will <sic>quitt</sic>. A large majority&#44; as I am<lb/> informed is much opposed to this movement and are pressing<lb/> on the Board of Man. to declare the situation vacant&#44; and<lb/> advertise for another <add>Hebrew</add>. My informant is a very highly<lb/> respected gentleman and I have every confidence in what<lb/> ever he says.</p>
			<p><persName>Mrs. Gotthelf</persName>&#44; <persName>Lowasahn</persName>&#44; <persName>Lirhsen<add>&#63;</add></persName>&#44; <persName>Straus</persName> and a great many<lb/> more requested me to give you their best wishes &#38; respects.</p> 
          <p rend="indent(1)">Be pleased to answer <del>the</del> by receipt of this letter&#44; and believe<lb/> me to be most seriously &#38; respectfully</p>
          <p rend="indent(3)">yours</p>
