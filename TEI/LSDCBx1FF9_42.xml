                              <p>I am surprised indeed to learn <sic>trough</sic> your letter,
                                        received this mor<lb/>ning, that you have not received my

                                        weeks ago. Where the fault<lb/> lays, I do not know; but

                                        the<lb/> receipt of your former letter, I tried to collect
                                        some of<lb/> your outstandings, I called with very few
                                        exceptions on every<lb/> one of your old subscribers and all

                                                  F.</persName> is a very un=<lb/>assuming man,
                                        attending to his duties as teacher solely and not mixing
                                        himself<lb/> with other people's business.</p>
                              <p><persName>Mrs Warder Cresson</persName> has been here. He visited
                                        me several times. He remained here<lb/> 11 days and in the
                                        mean time lectured twice. You know the man, and<lb/> so I
                                        don't need to tell you how he lectured. He sold about 30
                                        of<lb/> his books at $1.50 each.</p>
                              <p rend="indent(1)">My own position is as it were. I think I will be
                                        re-elected for another<lb/> year, but it is a hard task to
                                        convince them that it would be<lb/> more proper and
                                        beneficial on both sides to elect a minister for a more<lb/>
                                        permanent term; as they or the majority of them deem it
                                        their business<lb/> to out-spy me, and do not want me to
                                        sell them anything<lb/> which they should or should not do.
                                        I can flatter myself of po<lb/>sessing the good feelings and
                                        friendship of a large majority of my<lb/> congregators, but
                                        it seems they do not want me to do any thing else<lb/> as
                                        reading the prayers (allegro) shechting<add>?</add>, and at
                                        some times so<lb/> speak on general objects without touching
                                        their religious or moral<lb/> transgressions. It sometimes
                                        indeed <sic>revoltes</sic> against my feelings<lb/> to stand
                                        there <sic>idel</sic> as an <del>unit</del> uninterested
                                        looker-on, compelled<lb/> to silence and checked by worldly
                                        considerations; but I can't help it.</p>
