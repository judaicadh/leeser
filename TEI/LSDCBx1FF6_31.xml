          <p rend="indent(1)"><addressee>Revd Isaac Leeser</addressee></p>
          <p rend="indent(3)"><placeName>Philadelphia</placeName></p>
          <p rend="indent(4)">Dr &#38; Reverend Sir&#44;</p>
          <p rend="indent(7)">I should have answered your several<lb/> communications long ere this&#44; but business both private &#38; public<lb/> prevented me from doing myself this pleasure. Now you would<lb/> justly say&#44; that any man can write a few lines&#44; however his<lb/> time may be monopolized by his avocation&#44; and&#44; with much pro&#61;<lb/>priety you could instance it in your own person&#44; whose time<lb/> being very limited&#44; is yet able to carry on a correspondence<lb/> almost over the whole Union. I would answer you in few<lb/> words <add>Hebrew</add>&#33;&#33; Besides my principal reason for not having been more<lb/> prompt is&#44; that I determined never to appear before you empty handed&#44;<lb/> viz&#44; without contributing something to the Occident&#44; and thus I offer<lb/> you the enclosed trifle which you may insert in your invaluable journal<lb/> if you find it worthy to have a place therein&#44; and good enough to<lb/> stand the scrutiny of the <sic>criticising</sic> public. As regards the<lb/> proposed convention&#44; I hope to give you soon more fully my opinion<lb/> on it&#44; for I can assure that I anticipated such results. <persName>Mr Hart</persName><lb/> has no doubt acquainted you with the fact&#44; that the Congregation<lb/> Shearit Israel will not join the Convention. You are doubtlessly dis<lb/>appointed&#44; and I am really sorry that your zeal and honest<lb/> endeavors in the good cause are so little appreciated by our<lb/> brethern&#44; and the&#44; so much cherished&#44; hope of affecting a Union<lb/> of <placeName>Israel</placeName> in the <placeName>United States</placeName> will have to be relinquished for the<lb/> present</p>
		<pb n="2"/>
			<p>But there is one consolation that the matter rests in good hands<lb/> for as far as I have the honor of knowing you by reputation&#44;<lb/> I know that you are <hi rend="underline">not</hi> the man to give up a project so<lb/> easily&#44; if there is the remotest spark of hope&#44; of succeeding<lb/> even at an indefinite period&#44; and as far as I am con<lb/>cerned&#44; I promise you my aid&#44; as much as my feeble efforts<lb/> will permit&#44; so that if the congregation can retain me here I hope yet to<lb/> see <placeName>Charleston</placeName> <sic>formost</sic> in the successful effort. It strikes me<lb/> however&#44; that you could further the matter by the following method.<lb/> Engage if possible a competent person&#44; friendly to the cause&#44;<lb/> who is to issue an anonymous Article&#44; showing all imaginable<lb/> dangers which ultras<add>&#63;</add> think may possibly accrue to the cause of our holy Religion<lb/> by the proposed convention&#44; let it be worded as if coming from<lb/> a hostile pen&#44; and then set about depending anonymously the project&#44; ably&#44;<lb/> at the same time laying bare every imaginable disadvantage we<lb/> are laboring under at present and the deplorable state of religious<lb/> anarchy amongst <placeName>Israel</placeName> all over <placeName>America</placeName>. Such a controversy would<lb/> draw the attention of the public more successfully&#44; those who<lb/> are lukewarm may become interested in the matter&#44; while the<lb/> ultra Orthodox will gradually yield. I merely suggest this<lb/> because there are many here and probably everywhere else&#44; who will not<lb/> listen to reason&#44; and merely say&#44; <hi rend="underline">It cannot be done</hi>. One<lb/> objects because his neighbor says it is injurious&#44; the other&#44; because<lb/> it will cost something&#44; a third&#44; wishes to show the public<lb/> that he possess wisdom&#44; and foresight. In short there are but<lb/> precious few who oppose the measure from true religions</p>
		<pb n="3"/>
			<p>motives. Selfishness&#44; lukewarmness&#44; and the natural disposition<lb/> of our people to oppose are the stumbling blocks in our<lb/> way&#44; but we must nevertheless keep on and steadily pursue<lb/> the true course&#44; and we cannot fail. There are little news<lb/> here which interest you&#44; except that next <sic>thursday</sic> a concert<lb/> is to be given in behalf our congregation may the Lord<lb/> grant them success for the congregation is much in need of<lb/> pecuniary aid. By the by&#44; I was informed yesterday that<lb/> <persName>D Landsberg</persName>&#44; who was expected to succeed <persName>Mr Poznanski</persName>&#44; re&#61;<lb/>fuses coming&#44; for several reasons&#44; the principal of which<lb/> are&#44; that he expected &#36;500.00 for travelling expenses&#44; and they<lb/> only sent him &#36;200.00 and again&#44; he only wishes to be minis&#61;<lb/>ter and not Chazan. There is besides a great deal of contention<lb/> amongst them&#44; and <persName>Mr P.</persName> has lost ground even amongst his<lb/> own party. Hoping that this may find you in the enjoyment<lb/> of the best of health&#44; and fervently wishing that the Lord<lb/> may prolong your days for the Benefit of our Brethern and the cause.</p>
