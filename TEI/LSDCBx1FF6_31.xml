                              <p rend="indent(7)">I should have answered your several<lb/>
                                        communications long ere this, but business both private
                                        &amp; public<lb/> prevented me from doing myself this
                                        pleasure. Now you would<lb/> justly say, that any man can
                                        write a few lines, however his<lb/> time may be monopolized
                                        by his avocation, and, with much pro=<lb/>priety you could
                                        instance it in your own person, whose time<lb/> being very
                                        limited, is yet able to carry on a correspondence<lb/>
                                        almost over the whole Union. I would answer you in few<lb/>
                                        words <add>לאו כל אדם זוכה</add>!! Besides my principal
                                        reason for not having been more<lb/> prompt is, that I
                                        determined never to appear before you empty handed,<lb/>
                                        viz, without contributing something to the Occident, and
                                        thus I offer<lb/> you the enclosed trifle which you may
                                        insert in your invaluable journal<lb/> if you find it worthy
                                        to have a place therein, and good enough to<lb/> stand the
                                        scrutiny of the <sic>criticising</sic> public. As regards
                                        the<lb/> proposed convention, I hope to give you soon more
                                        fully my opinion<lb/> on it, for I can assure that I
                                        anticipated such results. <persName>Mr Hart</persName><lb/>
                                        has no doubt acquainted you with the fact, that the
                                        Congregation<lb/> Shearit Israel will not join the
                                        Convention. You are doubtlessly dis<lb/>appointed, and I am
                                        really sorry that your zeal and honest<lb/> endeavors in the
                                        good cause are so little appreciated by our<lb/> brethern,
                                        and the, so much cherished, hope of affecting a Union<lb/>
                                        of <placeName>Israel</placeName> in the <placeName>United
                                                  States</placeName> will have to be relinquished

                              <p>But there is one consolation that the matter rests in good
                                        hands<lb/> for as far as I have the honor of knowing you by

                                        easily, if there is the remotest spark of hope, of
                                        succeeding<lb/> even at an indefinite period, and as far as
                                        I am con<lb/>cerned, I promise you my aid, as much as my
                                        feeble efforts<lb/> will permit, so that if the congregation
                                        can retain me here I hope yet to<lb/> see

                                        <sic>formost</sic> in the successful effort. It strikes
                                        me<lb/> however, that you could further the matter by the
                                        following method.<lb/> Engage if possible a competent
                                        person, friendly to the cause,<lb/> who is to issue an
                                        anonymous Article, showing all imaginable<lb/> dangers which
                                                  ultras<add>?</add> think may possibly accrue to
                                        the cause of our holy Religion<lb/> by the proposed
                                        convention, let it be worded as if coming from<lb/> a
                                        hostile pen, and then set about depending anonymously the
                                        project, ably,<lb/> at the same time laying bare every
                                        imaginable disadvantage we<lb/> are laboring under at
                                        present and the deplorable state of religious<lb/> anarchy

                                                  <placeName>America</placeName>. Such a controversy
                                        would<lb/> draw the attention of the public more
                                        successfully, those who<lb/> are lukewarm may become
                                        interested in the matter, while the<lb/> ultra Orthodox will
                                        gradually yield. I merely suggest this<lb/> because there
                                        are many here and probably everywhere else, who will
                                        not<lb/> listen to reason, and merely say, <hi

                              <p>motives. Selfishness, lukewarmness, and the natural
                                        disposition<lb/> of our people to oppose are the stumbling
                                        blocks in our<lb/> way, but we must nevertheless keep on and
                                        steadily pursue<lb/> the true course, and we cannot fail.
                                        There are little news<lb/> here which interest you, except
                                        that next <sic>thursday</sic> a concert<lb/> is to be given
                                        in behalf our congregation may the Lord<lb/> grant them
                                        success for the congregation is much in need of<lb/>
                                        pecuniary aid. By the by, I was informed yesterday that<lb/>
                                        <persName>D Landsberg</persName>, who was expected to
                                        succeed <persName>Mr Poznanski</persName>, re=<lb/>fuses
                                        coming, for several reasons, the principal of which<lb/>
                                        are, that he expected $500.00 for travelling expenses, and
                                        they<lb/> only sent him $200.00 and again, he only wishes to
                                        be minis=<lb/>ter and not Chazan. There is besides a great
                                        deal of contention<lb/> amongst them, and <persName>Mr
                                                  P.</persName> has lost ground even amongst
                                        his<lb/> own party. Hoping that this may find you in the
                                        enjoyment<lb/> of the best of health, and fervently wishing
                                        that the Lord<lb/> may prolong your days for the Benefit of
                                        our Brethern and the cause.</p>
