            <p>My dear Sir</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">You have just cause to be surprised at my silence,<lb/> but my
                numerous duties and engagements prevent me from answering<lb/> both correspondents,
                and even family letters. To make up for lost<lb/> time I intend sending a long
                letter, and will endeavor to continue writing<lb/> to one whom I hold in the highest
                esteem. I send herewith the corrected<lb/> copy of the Road to faith and intend
                presenting it to your publication<lb/> society, if it is worth their acceptance;
                with this condition that they will<lb/> always supply me at the publication price. I
                have added little or nothing<lb/> and made but few <sic>Emendations</sic>. Of the
                former I specify the <del>ten com-</del> maimonidean<lb/>
                <del>mandments</del> creed, of the latter, very little will meet your eye of an
                unsatisfac<lb/>tory nature. You are at liberty to correct any text I have not
                translated<lb/> properly; <add>כי אז אהפך אל עמים שפה ברורה צפניה ג, ט</add> has
                been rendered “I will turn the nations<lb/> to pray with pure lips” instead of the
                    <sic>authorised</sic> version, I will render pure<lb/> the lips of the
                people.”</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">It grieved me to notice the useless discussion,<lb/> in the valuable
                pages of the Occident on the question of west Indian<lb/> citrons. Had the writers
                who so dogmatically insisted upon their being<lb/>
                <add>מרכבים</add> grafted, been at all acquainted with the
                    <placeName>Antilles</placeName>, they would<lb/> never have breached the matter.
                In these <placeName>Islands</placeName> too much attention<lb/> is devoted to the
                staple production, as sugar, coffee &amp;c to allow a<lb/> laborer's time to be
                wasted on the improvement of fruit trees. Of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName><lb/>
                especially I can assert most positively that the Citron grows in its<lb/> original
                state, either where it was first planted, or where the wind has<lb/> scattered the
                seed, and it has taken root. The same may be said of all<lb/> fruit trees, they are
                met with on all the estates, but no care is bestowed<lb/> on them. The orange and
                shaddock and perhaps the line, may, now that<lb/> estates owners try to make every
                thing profitable on their lands, receive<lb/> a share of attention, but the citron
                and others of that family are useless <del>to</del><lb/> except for making
                preserves, and grafting for that purpose would not pay<lb/> the cost of oranges,
                shaddocks, and lime juice are exported, citrons grow and<lb/> rot on the trees they
                may be had for the asking. The whole expense is confined<lb/> to gathering bringing
                them to town, packing, and freight to the states. One<lb/> of our brethren in
                    <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> used to send an annual supply to the
                syna-<lb/>gogues by his slaves, free of cost, the present possessor of his
                estates<lb/> permits any one to pluck citrons, who will send for them. They grow
                only<lb/> in the mountainous districts, and labor being high, people demand
                good<lb/> wages to walk the distance, and bring them to town. Of late years,
                    <persName>Mr. Kursheedt</persName><lb/> was supplied from a quarter
                    near<del>er</del> to <placeName>Kingston</placeName>; but the citrons from
                that<lb/> place were neither as handsome nor of so good a quality as those from<lb/>
                the lofty <placeName>Port Royal</placeName> mountains. <persName>Mr.
                Levy</persName>, the gentleman who resides there,<lb/> and his uncle before him,
                were both men of strict religious principles. As<lb/> natives of
                    <placeName>Europe</placeName>, and perfectly acquainted with the peculiar
                citrons<lb/> permitted to be used, they never grafted the trees. It must also
                be<lb/> recollected that our Portuguese brethren in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>
                were presided over for many<lb/> years by eminent Chachamine<add>?</add>; the chief
                    <persName>Chacham De Cordova</persName>, an eminent<lb/> scholar in biblical and
                profane knowledge, and whose manuscript<lb/> writings attest his profound
                acquirements. Surely, these pious &amp; orthodox<lb/> persons would not have
                sanctioned the use of grafted fruit. Either then<lb/> the learned in
                    <placeName>America</placeName> have passed an erroneous judgment, or all the
                Chachamin<lb/> in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> were wrong, or spurious citrons
                have been shipped to your<lb/> congregations and packed off as genuine fruit. One
                thing must be borne<lb/> in mind that in <placeName>Europe</placeName> the citron is
                well tended, in the <placeName>west Indies</placeName><lb/> neglected, and the
                difference of appearance has been imputed to grafting,<lb/> which I again repeat is
                not <sic>practised</sic> in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, whence you have<lb/>
                heretofore been supplied. You are at liberty to make use of this information<lb/>
                and name me as the author.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">You have written <persName>Mr. Wolff</persName> again on the<lb/>
                subject of my reply to the attack on confirmation, but it has been</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>delayed so long, that it has now lost its interest.” At the time the<lb/> articles
                appeared, it was my intention to have replied; and the whole was<lb/> sketched out
                and only wanted writing <del>it</del> fully, when the shameless conduct<lb/> of
                    <persName>Mr. Naar</persName> and his confederates in attempting to discharge me
                from my<lb/> post called forth all my energies to defeat their machinations, and
                left<lb/> me little leisure and less inclination for so trifling a matter.
                Success<lb/> attended my efforts; and an administration, whose supporters only
                sought<lb/> to do the congregations as much mischief as possible; was turned out to
                make<lb/> way for better men. Whilst this was in progress, and my daily bread
                at<lb/> stake, when the prospect of having to go and seek a living elsewhere
                stared<lb/> me in the face, could you suppose that I should sit down composedly<lb/>
                to reply to an opponent whose object and motive in assailing me arose<lb/> from
                malice? And had I done so, would my words have been free from<lb/> asperity?
                Smarting under wrong, would there not have been too much<lb/> bitterness in my
                reasoning? <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> was before me, my resignation<lb/> there
                too recent to have been forgotten, and the unhappy circumstances which<lb/> caused
                it were remembered. And was I further to commit myself? Was I<lb/> to answer a man
                who is a model of infidelity and unbelief, who does not<lb/> observe a single day in
                the year, as tho' he had been a sincere &amp; upright<lb/> Israelite? Must I not
                necessarily have exposed his hypocrisy, and shown<lb/> that his solicitude
                    <del>about</del> for our religion had its source in dislike to me<lb/>
                personally? I must have exposed the whole affair to vindicate confirmation<lb/> and
                myself, and this step would have widened the breach in the congregation<lb/> and led
                to further aggravation and ill feeling. <persName>Mr. Naar</persName> and I are
                now<lb/> reconciled and I hope soon by prudence and circumspection to restore<lb/>
                peace and good will among all parties, except <persName>Mr. M. B.
                    Simmonds</persName>, whom<lb/> every one despises and dislikes, and who is a bad
                hearted man. All his<lb/> talent, and he has much, can never reestablish him in the
                favorable<lb/> opinion of the public. Meanwhile I have not been idle, but have
                been<lb/> preparing to strengthen and improve my position. Again, necessity has<lb/>
                compelled me to open a school, to give me bread, in case of rupture or<lb/>
                discontent in the congregation, necessity, not choice, has driven me to it for<lb/>
                I had hoped to sit down here and labor for the welfare of my flock as in<lb/>
                <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>. I have not been altogether unsuccessful. In another
                quarter<lb/> also I have been endeavoring to make provision for future subsistence.
                All<lb/> these projects trench upon my time, and exclusively with the writing of
                sermons engage my attention.<lb/> Depending on the faith of the congregation, I sent
                for my mother in law and<lb/> her mother who is eighty years old, and cannot easily
                move from place<lb/> to place. Cares have multiplied you see and <del>have</del>
                restrain my will, else<lb/> I would not be in <placeName>St. Thomas</placeName>. I
                detail, that you may make allowance<lb/> for my silence, and not attribute it to
                indolence or indifference. The good<lb/> effects of confirmation have more and more
                convinced me of its great<lb/> utility and tho' I have altered some of the
                formalities, I am not prepared<lb/> to abandon it. But why, let me ask, were not
                your observations <sic>levelled</sic><lb/> against the ceremony, <del>?</del>
                replied to by <persName>Dr. Lilienthal</persName>? He is not incapable<lb/> of
                defending it, and its advocacy concerns him who has the spiritual<lb/> care of
                thousands, more than poor me who have only 3 or 4 hundred to guard.<lb/> His reasons
                I cannot divine, unless he thought <hi rend="underline">your arguments</hi>
                irrefutable,<lb/> which, in my opinion, the are not. It does not appear, that in
                your long<lb/> ministry, you have been able, without confirmation, to introduce a
                more<lb/> serious observance of the <date>sabbath</date> in
                    <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, or the abolition of<lb/> mixed marriages,
                or the foundation of Jewish Schools. In <placeName>Jamaica</placeName><lb/> I did
                not resort to confirmation; I accomplished all these objects without<lb/> it; here
                however I find it a useful instrument in keeping the sheep within<lb/> the fold; and
                thro' the children have wrought upon the parents so that some<lb/> determined
                    <date>sabbath</date> breakers have been won from their evil courses. That
                confirmation<lb/> has answered the purpose I intended it to serve, knowledge of our
                religion to<lb/> the young, reflection upon past misdeeds and serious resolutions to
                amend on<lb/> the path of the old. Its value has been tested here, and found
                beneficial, and as the<lb/> most orthodox, as
                    <persName>Plessuer<add>?</add></persName>, say, <persName>Adler</persName> and
                others are in its favor, it cannot be<lb/> termed heterodoxical. I do not pin my
                faith on it, but with God's help, I hope<lb/> to further its <del>already</del>
                usefulness. No child shall be called to the sepher who is<lb/> ignorant of the
                fundamental principles of Judaism but yet <hi rend="underline">I</hi> will not
                make<lb/> confirmation compulsory, the <persName>king</persName> of
                    <placeName>Denmark</placeName> will however do so. It may suit<lb/> the
                unbeliever to disapprove of it, because he reveres nothing; this cause, added<lb/>
                to personal ill will to me and <persName>Mr. Wolff</persName>, was the reason of
                    <persName>Mr. Naar's</persName> philippic.<lb/> It grieved me to find your
                powerful pen enlisted in the service of irreligion,<lb/> but your dislike of any
                thing approaching reform instigated you to throw<lb/> disparagement on a valuable
                aid to our religion in these times when license</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>of speech, thought, and conduct is dignified by the name of liberty of<lb/>
                conscience and action. I cannot account for your championship in any other<lb/>
                manner. There were points in <persName>Mr. Naar's</persName> communication savoring
                of the grossest<lb/> infidelity; whoever read it must have been convinced that it
                emanated from a<lb/> rank Deist; yet how bland were your corrections of those
                points, and how determined<lb/> your onslaught on confirmers and confirmation. The
                pages of the Occident may yet, on<lb/> some future occasion be open to my advocacy
                of confirmation, when my mind is less<lb/> harassed; and be assured that the past
                will not then be forgotten. Till then, I resume<lb/> my <sic>defence</sic> of the
                    <hi rend="underline">promise</hi>, not the <hi rend="underline">oath</hi>
                <del>taken</del> made at the first ceremony, and shall be<lb/> able to produce the
                warrant of scripture for its introduction. Polemics do not<lb/> appear to be
                    <persName>Mr. Naar's</persName> forte; politics whether discussed in caucus,
                stage <sic>waggon</sic>,<lb/> or groggery are more suited to his taste, else he
                would not have made himself<lb/> so ridiculous by stating that the <hi

                mayor<lb/> of <placeName>Elizabeth Town</placeName>? But my dear <persName>Mr.
                    Leeser</persName>, you will never be able to write<lb/> down confirmation; it
                will maintain its ground and spread itself in <placeName>America</placeName><lb/> as
                elsewhere, and time may yet behold in you and of its warmest defenders<lb/> one word
                more on this subject; refer to the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> no of the First Fruits,
                and note<lb/> that confirmation had my best wishes, before the thought of
                    <placeName>St. Thomas</placeName> entered my<lb/> mind. You will find an article
                headed Bar-Mitzva or Confirmation in which<lb/> I expressed a desire for its
                adoption in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Your last letter was exceedingly interesting. The sketch of<lb/>
                <persName>Rabbi Moshe Katzenellenbogen</persName> so graphic and illustrative of the
                Jewish charac-<lb/>ter and studies in <placeName>Poland</placeName> and
                    <placeName>Russia</placeName>. Your opinion is correct of our people's<lb/>
                being the most clever among mankind. Even if their studies are not practically<lb/>
                useful in a busy world, they sharpen the intellect and fit <del>then</del> the mind
                for<lb/> understanding any thing. A Polack or Russian Israelite having once
                obtained<lb/> a little refinement and polish is able to make his way in any pursuit
                whether<lb/> literary, scientific, or mercantile. It yet remains to be seen what
                effect<lb/> the immense immigration of our people into the states will have on
                religion<lb/> generally. The problem will be solved in the western world
                whether<lb/> Christianity shall not fall at the feet of Judaism. On that continent
                where<lb/> the fullest liberty meets the most rigorous despotism of body and mind,
                where<lb/> American and Russian institutions border on each other the truth of
                prophecy<lb/> will first enlighten man, and its accomplishment take place. Whilst
                every<lb/> Jewish heart bleeds at the miseries of our Russian brethren, it is
                apparent<lb/> that some great change is at hand in the fortunes of our people.
                    <persName>Nicholas</persName><lb/> is not influenced by any other motive to act

                    <del>dominion</del> rule over the consciences<lb/> of his subjects and to make
                them all conform to one religion as they obey<lb/> one sovereign who is solo master

                    לעליון ישעי' יד יד</add>.<lb/> It is a mighty and gigantic project displaying
                his daring genius not even<lb/>
                <persName>Antiochus Epiphanes</persName> dared to go so far.

                will not witness his success or that of his successors;<lb/> but how well does he
                realize <persName>Ezekiel's</persName> description of the “<persName>Prince of
                    Rosh</persName><lb/>
                <placeName>Meshic</placeName> and <placeName>Tubal</placeName>” destined to be
                broken with his multitudes on the<lb/> mountains of <placeName>Israel</placeName>.
                Really the longer we live, the better do we<lb/> comprehend scripture, and our
                ablest commentators were on these<lb/> historical revelations less enlightened than
                we who cannot hold a<lb/> candle to them in knowledge. Prophecy sheds a stronger
                light the longer<lb/> it turns. When <placeName>Russia</placeName> was an obscure
                and barbarous country which of<lb/> our commentators could have pointed to it
                unknown as <del>she</del> it was to be<lb/> the spot whence the last opponent to
                    <placeName>Israel's</placeName> restoration and peace<lb/> should issue? At this
                day, who can scruple to doubt that the <add>?</add><lb/> dynasty was forseen by the
                prophet? Depend on it, no prayers, no<lb/> entreaties will sway
                    <persName>Nicholas</persName> from his purpose, no
                    <persName>montefiores</persName> will<lb/> succeed; he will promise, but will
                not relax his iron determination.<lb/> He will modify his <add>?</add>, but their
                end and intention will remain<lb/> the same. He will possibly permit a larger
                emigration of those who<lb/> can afford to buy the privilege of departing, but he
                will not the<lb/> less persevere in his oppression. Martyred blood will be shed and
                perhaps<lb/> when that avails not, he will drive <placeName>Israel</placeName> from
                his land as Pharoah<lb/> did. In politics the danger is as imminent as in Religion,
                    <placeName>Turkey</placeName> is</p>
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>already in his grasp. <placeName>Austria</placeName> will succumb,
                    <placeName>Prussia</placeName> will follow, unless<lb/> the German nations
                combine for common safety. And whither shall the<lb/> millions of

                protection save to <placeName>Western<lb/> Europe</placeName>, or more probably to
                the <placeName>United States</placeName>? Therefore the hypothesis<lb/> that
                    <placeName>America</placeName> is to be the chosen soil whereon mankind will
                first be<lb/> illumined is not so very extraordinary. Meanwhile let us pray for
                the<lb/> messiah coming as did our pious forefathers, and await it with devout<lb/>
                and confident hearts.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Have you yet broken a lance against <persName>Rabbi
                Wise</persName><lb/> as you anticipated? I was prepared for something more
                satisfactory<lb/> and convincing than his logical reasoning in the Occident.
                Possibly his<lb/> words have suffered by translation but part of his arguments
                appear to me<lb/> very contradictory. For example in page 160 <date>June</date> No
                of Occident he says.<lb/> “The chief precept of our religion is to be holy that is
                    <hi rend="underline">to love God</hi> &amp;c. <hi rend="underline"
                >Inferior</hi><lb/> to this precept is the one to acknowledge God expressed in the
                first com<lb/>mandment &amp; If one really acknowledge him we shall love Him and
                thereby<lb/> become holy! First <persName>Rabbi Wise</persName> makes the love of
                God paramount to the<lb/> acknowledgment of God, and in the next line tells us that
                the <hi rend="underline">effect</hi> of<lb/> acknowledging him will lead us to love
                Him. If love then be <hi rend="underline">the</hi> chief<lb/> it must lead to
                acknowledgment and not acknowledgment to love. Beside<lb/> I was always taught that
                acknowledging the Divine Being is the first<lb/> principle <del>to be taught</del>.
                In the <add>שמע</add> it is so; love of God being a consequence<lb/> of recognizing
                and acknowledging him the same in the Decalogue, in<lb/> the Creed of
                    <persName>Maimonides</persName> and <persName>Albo</persName>. The neo-judaical
                opinions of <persName>Rabbi<lb/> Wise</persName> are not in harmony, on this point,
                with the law and prophets.<lb/> Prayers, generally, is subjective; but surely
                scripture presents many of an<lb/> objective character <persName>Moses</persName> on
                behalf of <persName>Miriam</persName>, <persName>Samuel</persName> for the people
                &amp;c &amp;c<lb/> Persons pray for each other disinterestedly hoping that the
                effect may<lb/> be objective. “If the proper object and purpose of prayer” I quote
                page 158<lb/> be the reflective effect upon the spirit and heart of him who
                prays”<lb/> thus one should never pray for our fellow creatures; all our ideas
                would<lb/> be confined, in prayer, to our own spiritual and temporal
                improvement.<lb/> The subjective and objective effect of prayer is too refined a
                distinction<lb/> to be understood by the generality of our people, and
                    <persName>Rabbi W.</persName> has not<lb/> explained this difficult point
                clearly. Your emphatic objection in<lb/> page 158 has my cordial support. Of course,
                    <persName>Rabbi W.</persName> wants no temple<lb/> no national restoration, no
                messiah, he only wants a <add>שארית</add>. Why not<lb/> recommend the mutilation of
                the prophecies, or the leaving out, when<lb/> revising the law, all such passages as
                relate to <placeName>Israel's</placeName> redemption and<lb/> restoration, such as
                    <add>ולב"ה אלהיך את שבותך</add>. <persName>Rabbi W's</persName> opinions are not
                new to<lb/> me. The modern reformers generally have attached to the removal<lb/> of
                evil disabilities and the recognition of Israelites to the rights of<lb/>
                citizenship, their views of messiah's coming. They do not ask much,<lb/> but what
                conception can they have of the prophecies, if they thus<lb/> confine the future
                glory of <placeName>Israel</placeName> to the enjoyment of such doubtful<lb/> good?
                The conclave of American Rabbins are right however in<lb/> seeking to establish a
                minhag <placeName>America</placeName>. It is most necessary<lb/> if only to make
                Judaism and synagogue worship understood<lb/> by Christians. I almost shudder at the
                prejudices which the<lb/> conduct in some synagogues must excite in the Christian
                mind.<lb/> Whilst therefore condemning some of the principles evolved by<lb/>
                <persName>Rabbi Wise</persName> as the mouthpiece of the conclave, the project<lb/>
                has my best wishes. Why do you not start up and effect the<lb/> same for the
                Sephardim of whom you are the head, both by<lb/> length of service, talent &amp;c.
                They require it their synagogue<lb/> discipline is exceedingly lax, and needs
                restoration.</p>
