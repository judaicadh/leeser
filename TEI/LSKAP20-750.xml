            <p>Rev<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. &amp; Dear Sir! It seems that you have no<lb/> regular
                correspondent in this city, for otherwise he<lb/> could give you matter enough, to
                have also "<placeName>New Orleans</placeName>"<lb/> mentioned in the domestic column
                of your valuable journal.<lb/> I take <sic>therefor</sic> the liberty to forward you
                some<lb/> short items, regarding religious affairs in <placeName>New
                    Orleans</placeName>.</p>
            <p>About two months ago D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                <persName>Illowy</persName> sent an<lb/> official letter to the <add>מוהלים</add> of
                this city, in which, he<lb/> requested them, not to circumcise in future any
                male<lb/> child born from a christian mother though the father<lb/> be an Israelite,
                for the following reasons:</p>
            <p>1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>/ It being evident that the circumcision is not performed<lb/>
                <add>לשם גירות</add> but only for the purpose of being entitled to a<lb/> portion of
                ground on the Jewish burying place in case<lb/> of death, and according to the law,
                the ceremony of circum˶<lb/>cision can not be performed only <add>לשם גירות</add>
                after which<lb/> the ceremony of <add>טבילה</add> has to follow, while among all
                those</p>
            <pb n="1V"/>
            <p>already circumcised children of christian mothers,<lb/> of whom some have already
                reached the age of<lb/> five and others of six years, is not one that had
                    <add>טבילה</add><lb/> Though <persName>Dr Illowy</persName> explained to some of
                the<lb/> parents that their children can not be regarded as<lb/> by law as Israelite
                as long as <add>טבילה</add> is not performed,<lb/> the father, but not the mother
                would yield to the exigen˶<lb/>cy of the law.</p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">ndly</hi>/ Since the circumcision is not performed <add>לשם
                    גירות</add><lb/> the <add>מוהל</add> not only that he acts contrary to the
                law,<lb/> but he also transgresses the prohibition <add>לא תשא</add> by making<lb/>
                a <add>ברכה לבטלה</add></p>
            <p>3<hi rend="sup">rdly</hi>/ Suppose every thing would be done according to the<lb/>
                law both <add>טבילה</add> and <add>מילה</add>, what however has Judaism to hope<lb/>
                of a child educated by a christian mother and an<lb/> irreligious father have we not
                enough <add>בנים משחיתים</add> of our<lb/> own, who would not know that they are
                Jews were they<lb/> not circumcised what for should we yet, under the cover<lb/> of
                religion increase their number?</p>
            <p>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                <persName>Illowy</persName> made the above explanation to the<lb/> Board of Trustees
                who assisted him, and two of the<lb/>
                <add>מוהלים</add> who are members of the cong. were notified by them<lb/> that it is
                the desire of the Board that they would act</p>
            <pb n="2R"/>
            <p>according to the decision of the <sic>Rabby</sic>, to which they<lb/> agreed. But the
                3rd <add>מוהל</add> wrote, two weeks after<lb/> he <sic>recieved</sic>
                <persName>Dr Illowy's</persName> answer letter, a very insulting<lb/> answer, in
                which he declared himself, that he has done so<lb/> before and will continue so, to
                circumcise all such<lb/> children born from christian mothers.</p>
            <p>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                <persName>Illowy</persName> after having <sic>recieved</sic> that insulting<lb/>
                answer of the <add>מוהל</add> declared him publicly in the Synag.<lb/> as
                    <add>פסול</add> having forfeited his right as <add>מוהל</add> and being<lb/> in
                future unfit and unworthy for that holy office.</p>
            <p>This event gave rise partly to a dissatisfaction among<lb/> the friends of the
                    <add>מוהל</add>, and those whose <sic>wive</sic> are strangers<lb/>
                <add>נכריות</add> to our nation, and partly to a dispute among impartial<lb/>
                individuals about the correctness of <persName>Dr. I.'s</persName> decision.</p>
            <p>Permit me <sic>therefor</sic> Revd Sir to lay before you and<lb/> your learned
                readers 3 questions</p>
            <p>1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>/ Is it permitted according to the law to circumcise<lb/> ˶the
                son of a christian mother and an irreligious father<lb/> ˶though we know
                    <sic>aforehand</sic> that we have not a spark of hope<lb/> ˶that the child will
                ever be brought up as a Jew?</p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>/ Suppose it be not permitted has any <sic>Rabby</sic> the
                right<lb/> ˶to declare a <add>מוהל</add> who acts contrary to his decision in<lb/>
                ˶said question <add>פסול</add> and unfit in future to perform the<lb/> ˶ceremony of
                circumcision?</p>
            <pb n="2V"/>
            <p>3<hi rend="sup">rdly</hi>/ Suppose the <sic>Rabby</sic> has such a right, to<lb/>
                ˶declare a <add>מוהל</add>, is then the <add>פסול</add> resting<lb/> ˶ only upon the
                    <add>פסול</add>, or is it likewise sinful of every<lb/> ˶ individual who allows
                such a <add>מוהל</add> to circumcise his child.</p>
            <p>Hoping that you will grant these questions a space<lb/> in the columns of your
                valuable journal, and let us hear at the<lb/> same time your own opinion as well as
                those of other learned<lb/> men in <placeName>Israel</placeName>; I can assure you
                that by so doing you<lb/> will restore the peace into the hearts of those who are
                now<lb/> dissatisfied with the decision of <persName>Revd Dr Illowy</persName>.</p>
            <p><add>מוהל</add> There were this year over fifty <add>אחרון אחרון חביב</add> in
                our<lb/> City, of which over forty were built by the members of<lb/> the Cong.
                "Schaarey Chased" <placeName>Rampart St.</placeName>, whilst three<lb/> years ago
                when <persName>Dr I.</persName> arrived in this city there was not<lb/> more than
                one <add>סוכות</add> built by the sexton of the <sic>Portoguese</sic><lb/> Cong. in
                the yard of their Synag. Though it is true that<lb/> the Revd Gentleman worked
                indefatigably with patience<lb/> and perseverance to keep the word of God alive in
                his<lb/> community, still it must be admitted that praise enough<lb/> cannot be
                bestowed on <persName>S. Friedlander Esqr.</persName> President<lb/> of the Cong.
                not alone for the powerful support, he is<lb/> to the <sic>Rabby</sic>, not alone
