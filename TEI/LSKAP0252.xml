                <date>March 20. 5608</date>
            </p>
            <p>Reverend &amp; dear Sir</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Your favor <date>6th</date> inst reached me a few days since<lb/>
                and having a few moments to spare prior to giving an<lb/> audience to some of the
                great men here, I avail myself<lb/> of the happy circumstance to commence with
                one<lb/> whose heart I feel assured beats responsive to the<lb/> pulsations of my
                own.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I verily believe my dear friend that your<lb/> penmanship is ever
                worse than mine, for if you can<lb/> decipher my scrawl it is more than I could do
                with<lb/> a considerable portion of your late letter. N' <sic>imparte</sic><lb/> I
                would guess at what I could not read and as we usually<lb/> commune on subjects of
                high interest to our Faith, it<lb/> was perhaps the more gratifying to trace through
                the<lb/> medium of a few disjointed words, whole sentences &amp;<lb/> devotion to
                the glory of the family of <persName>Jacob</persName>.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I am fully aware how overtaxed your time must<lb/> be, for my part
                of late I have managed to tear<lb/> myself from the awful sedentary &amp; monotonous
                habits<lb/> of an editor, and have indulged myself in some good works<lb/> for the
                credit of our people and the community at large.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I am about to contract for finishing the<lb/> inside of our new
                synagogue and what with <persName>Mr Touro</persName><lb/> on the one hand with his
                peculiar notions, and the<lb/> mechanics on the other with their attempts to make
                a<lb/> good bargain I assure I am not a little perplexed.<lb/> At least on how a day
                and frequently several hours</p>
            <pb n="1V"/>
            <p>do I give to what in a general term may be styled<lb/> Judaic affairs. To day I have
                written to <persName>Mr Nathan</persName><lb/> pr <placeName>West India</placeName>
                steamer to ascertain on what terms<lb/> he would come to us. <persName>Mr
                    Touro</persName> is favorably impressed<lb/> with him. I think we could complete
                the building<lb/> in three months time from now, altho' it may<lb/> be longer unless
                a Hazan can be secured.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I spoke to <persName>Mr Touro</persName> this morning about<lb/> the
                Paln society, “he was mum!!</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Before I forget it let me state that on <date>Friday</date><lb/>
                last <persName>Mr. J P. Benjamin</persName> handed me $5.30 for you<lb/> I enclose
                in this a $10 note out of which please pay<lb/> yourself that amt &amp; also a small
                sum which I owe<lb/> you for an obituary, the Occident &amp; anything else. I
                really<lb/> do not know if the note I send will cover what I intend<lb/> it to, if
                not be so kind as to advise me in replying<lb/> to this letter.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">When the Prayer books for <persName>Mrs Andrews</persName><lb/>
                reach here I will attend to the matter &amp; remit<lb/> you the amount instanter; as
                it is my habit<lb/> now to keep as few accounts as possible. My mind<lb/> is kept so
                constantly on the stretch that I am fearful<lb/> of forgetting anything not attended
                to, &amp; closed at<lb/> the same instant.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The subject of an institution of learning<lb/> for our youth shall
                not escape my memory however<lb/> &amp; in fact I often allude to it in conversing
                with <persName>Mr<lb/> Touro</persName>, but he seems to think it best to finish
                one</p>
            <pb n="2R"/>
            <p>undertaking ere commencing another.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Sincerely do I hope to see you one of<lb/> these days and to have a
                good long talk with<lb/> you, perhaps when we consecrate our place of<lb/> worship
                one may induce you to pay us a visit<lb/> of a few weeks at least. How many things
                have<lb/> transpired “with poor me clear out here” and which<lb/> I would like to
                tell you of. I long to have a dozen<lb/> good long talks with you, indeed I do.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">And now my good sir let me ask you to<lb/> do as I have just done
                &amp; whenever the chance<lb/> offers and your “debts <sic>correspondential</sic>”
                are paid<lb/> to your other friends, seize the pen &amp; let me<lb/> hear of you,
                how you gig<add>?</add> along, &amp; how the world<lb/> uses you. Oblige me &amp;
                give my fondest love to<lb/> my dear little Aunt when you see her, &amp;
                present<lb/> me in becoming terms to <persName>Uncle William</persName>
                <persName>Mr &amp;<lb/> Mrs I L T<add>?</add></persName> &amp; <persName>Miss
                        Lar<add>?</add></persName>. By the way you<lb/> are held in the very highest
                esteem by the young lady<lb/> The manner in which she spoke of you whilst here<lb/>
                on her recent visit proved to me that her feelings<lb/> towards you were precisely
                like my own &amp; I like her none<lb/> the less on that account.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Wishing you the best of health &amp; all other<lb/> choice blessings
                I conclude. Your friend most truly</p>
