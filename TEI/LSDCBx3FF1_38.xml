				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>New Orleans</placeName> <date>5th July 5626</date></p>
				<p><addressee>Rev Isaac Leeser</addressee></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><placeName>Philadelphia</placeName></p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">Dear Sir&#44;</p>
			<p rend="indent(3)">Your letter on your return home duly reached<lb/> me. I regret very sincerely to learn of your impaired health&#44; of which<lb/> my <placeName>Richmond</placeName> correspondents had before informed me&#59; but most earnest&#45;<lb/>ly do I pray that further tidings may be of a happier character.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The lukewarmness and indifference that<lb/> you noticed in your recent Southern trip&#44; in religious matters&#44; had<lb/> long ago been perceptible to me&#44; and occasioned serious and painful<lb/> thought. This degeneracy has been creeping along for some time and<lb/> I see fearful signs of its continuous progress. The battle between<lb/> Principle and Gain almost invariably terminates in favor of the<lb/> latter&#59; hence those leaders who will smooth away the &#8220;difficulties&#8221;<lb/> which beset the path of conformity with recognized duties&#44; and<lb/> not insist on the uncompromising fidelity required of us&#44; are<lb/> certain of being popular and influential. My &#8220;<sic>dilenda</sic> est<lb/> Carthago&#8221; is the onslaught in and out of the Pulpit on the<lb/> modern manufacture of a &#8220;Religion of Convenience.&#8221; I have<lb/> confidence in the innate piety and good sense of the people<lb/> who often&#44; tho offenders against the the Law&#44; do not palliate<lb/> or argue away the wrong&#44; and may be wrought on for their</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>good <add>Hebrew</add>&#59; but when Teachers rise up&#44; and by<lb/> precept and example inculcate as unimportant&#44; useless&#44; and<lb/> contrary to the spirit of the age &#8212; all or much of what they had<lb/> been trained up to observe &#8212; what is to be expected&#63;  The awakened<lb/> religious feelings become enlisted in favor of what requires so little<lb/> effort&#59; only build a magnificent place of worship&#44; modernize&#44;<lb/> hope<add>&#63;</add> &#38; render agreeable its services&#44; preserve decorum&#44; &#38; have an<lb/> external varnish of piety&#44; and the <add>Hebrew</add> is attained. I place<lb/> a great deal of the blame for this wretched state of affairs<lb/> on the shoulders of our so&#45;called Orthodox chiefs&#44; who are idle &#38;<lb/> selfish&#44; and contribute nothing to the <hi rend="underline">general</hi> good of <placeName>Israel</placeName>. All<lb/> their efforts seem concentrated on little aims which began in their<lb/> own Synagogues and end there. And then there is no unity of<lb/> action. Look for assistance at the several large congregations at<lb/> the  <placeName>North</placeName>. At the <placeName>19th St.</placeName> Synagogue&#44; everything seems to have been<lb/> attained in <persName>Mr Lyn&#39;s<add>&#63;</add></persName> cadences &#38; his choir&#39;s artistic performances.<lb/> The pulpit is silent&#44; and does not seem to be needed. Our<lb/> worthy brethren there are apparently contented with the order of<lb/> things as they are&#44; and are either so pious as not to require<lb/> explanations or so wicked as to fear denunciation. At <persName>Dr. Raphall&#39;s</persName><lb/> &#38; <persName>Mr. Isaacs&#39;s</persName>&#44; I hear trumpet&#45;tongued praises of the <hi rend="underline">choir</hi>&#44; in<lb/> the former&#44; it is said&#44; led by a Xian&#33; Do you not remember my<lb/> fickle and unsuccessful effort in <add>&#63;</add> at the first Sephim of<lb/> the Board of Delegates to have its scope of a character which</p>  
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>might meet our wants&#59;&#45; a College &#8212; preparatory Schools &#8212; a<lb/> supervising Board to examine into the qualifications &#38; personal<lb/> worth of those coming to this country for office&#38;c&#63;  But no&#58; it<lb/> seemed that the assembly of Delegates from various parts of the<lb/> Union looked only to the aggrandizement of <placeName>New York</placeName>&#44; and we<lb/> Dummies had only to listen with rapt attention to the to the Delphic<lb/> oracles &#38; play the meek parts of  &#8220;make weights.&#8221; I hope<lb/> better things are in progress for I notice at last&#44; some wakefullness<lb/> on the great needs of one day. But perhaps my expectations<lb/> are premature&#44; and another <persName>Rip Van Winkle</persName> nap will follow.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Your article in the <date>June</date> No. is sound &#38;<lb/> telling&#44; and I trust to see it followed up by some tangible plan<lb/> for training up an American ministry. It is singular that<lb/> our wealthy Congrns. have not been influenced even by common<lb/> policy to do something even of a selfish nature for their own<lb/> future advantage&#59; and I throw out the hint which you might<lb/> use&#44; that lacking any general or organized effort&#44; that each<lb/> might devote a portion of its funds annually set  apart to edu<lb/>cate in <placeName>Europe</placeName> &#8212; after the usual Collegiate Course here &#8212; a<lb/> respectable &#38; pious&#45;minded young man&#44; in whose services it<lb/> would have the first claim.  My little boy I <sic>purpose</sic>&#44; God<lb/> willing&#44; bringing up to the sacred profession&#44; and if nothing better&#44; or<lb/> as good offer here at the proper age to send him to <placeName>Breslau</placeName>&#59; and<lb/> all my strivings peculiarly are devoted towards this attainment&#44;</p>
