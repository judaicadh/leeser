                              <p>Revd Sir</p>
                              <p rend="indent(1)">Accept my thanks for inserting, in the
                                        occident<lb/> of this month, my first letter on the union
                                        &amp;c. It is thought much<lb/> of here, perhaps more than
                                        it deserves. I am not over greedy of praise<lb/> but if my
                                        labours contribute, in the smallest degree, to promote the
                                        good<lb/> cause, it will I confess make me happy, and amply
                                        compensate me.</p>
                              <p rend="indent(1)">I have now the pleasure of handing you Letter 3,
                                        on<lb/> subjects confessedly difficult to be properly
                                        treated. Whether I have succee=<lb/>=ded or not in my
                                        expositions, and to what degree will be judged by the
                                        public<lb/> before whom my letters are to be placed.</p>
                              <p rend="indent(1)">I read very attentively your excellent article on
                                        “The<lb/> Results of Union.” it came very opportunely, and I
                                        availed myself<lb/> of it, as you will perceive in my 3
                                        Letter, to induce patient attention to<lb/> my exposition.
                                        Your remarks and suggestions, and my two first letters<lb/>
                                        ought to suffice for the purposes of the suggested meeting.
                                        Our Folks<lb/> scarcely ever proceed at Railway speed,
                                        therefore what you may further<lb/> suggest and I may
                                        publish will be in very good time and keeping, even<lb/> if
                                        issued after holding the meeting, for the Union should it
                                        ever take<lb/> place. I shall therefore continue my
                                        exposition, and though not as fully<lb/> as might be done, I
                                        will still endeavour to render it as useful and
                                        interesting<lb/> as I can, by neglecting nothing that I
                                        think might conduce to those ends.</p>
                              <p rend="indent(1)">I expect the pleasure of a letter from you in
                                        acknow=<lb/>ledgment of that I wrote you on forwarding to
                                        you my 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> Letter on the Union.<lb/> I
                                        am anxious to learn if you approve of and intend, on my
                                        suggestion, announcing<lb/> at once in the occident for
                                                  <date><sic>march</sic></date>, the meeting for

                              <pb n="2"/>
                              <p><sic>page</sic> 539, I observe something like a too much waiting
                                        upon others?<lb/> announce the meeting and I will venture to
                                        insure an attendance of<lb/> at least a dozen—quite enough,
                                        and perhaps better than a greater number<lb/> to resolve on
                                        constituting itself the suggested society, which many
                                        will<lb/> subsequently join. Forgoing that far neither much
                                        labour nor money<lb/> will be required, whilst it may be the
                                        means of eventual success in<lb/> the object we have in
                                        view. If the meeting take place at <placeName>New
                                                  York</placeName> many<lb/> of the laymen of that
                                        city will doubtless attend. I have in view as many<lb/> as a
                                        dozen including laymen and ministers that would be present
                                        at the<lb/> meeting. <persName>Dr. Wise</persName><add>Each

                                        reverend<lb/> Gentleman persisted in saying he would not
                                        attend the meeting, giving<lb/> for reason that he thought a
                                        meeting of ministers could have no result,<lb/> and that one
                                        of talented laymen would be likely to have more: He
                                        added<lb/> that he might, however, yet determine on
                                        attending. I hope he may but if<lb/> he do not we must
                                        strive to do as well as we can without him.</p>
