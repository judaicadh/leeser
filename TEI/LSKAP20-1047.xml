            <p>Every thing has its time, and every endeavour under heaven has its<lb/> appointed

                <sic>alpowerful</sic> God? Are not religion and obedience to God and honouring<lb/>
                him, and the knowledge of his goodness from their very nature im-<lb/>perishable, as
                these gifts appertained to a life, which we deem eternal?</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">It is our duty, brethren, not only to teach the whole
                congregation,<lb/> but every individual of us the properties of the state, which I
                just<lb/> mentioned, that we may be the better enabled to reach it. Time<lb/> has
                shown that we have been successful in our holy endeavour, and<lb/> that we have
                chosen the proper hour, that we have acquired the<lb/> noblest of all possessions:
                it must be our aim to preserve it; you<lb/> must not expect that time can confirm
                you more and more in the<lb/> possession thereof; not expect that only from
                yourselves, from your<lb/> wisdom! With this view let us consider today:</p>
            <p>Which state is the most propitious for the growth of religion<lb/> with whole nations
                and individuals? (single indiv.)</p>
