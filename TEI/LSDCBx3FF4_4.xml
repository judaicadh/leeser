                <date>Nov 19th 5598</date>.</p>
            <p>Dear Aunt.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">When <persName>Mr. Cohen</persName> left me on
                    <date>Wednesday</date> afternoon he said<lb/> that he would call to see me
                before he left, but he did not<lb/> do so, no doubt owing to the bad weather on
                    <date>Thursday</date> evening.<lb/> I hope that before this uncle
                        <persName>A<add>?</add></persName> is much better, and able to<lb/> help
                himself a little, and that your eyes do not hurt<lb/> you as much as they did last
                week. When I came<lb/> home I found that <persName>David Peixotto</persName> was
                very sick with<lb/> the inflammatory rheumatism; he is sick yet, and<lb/> quite
                unable to help himself, but still he is better<lb/> than he has been. It is not very
                pleasant to be<lb/> sick at a boarding house, especially where he is if it<lb/> were
                my case I would not be able to stand it, on account<lb/> of the greasy smell of
                cooking which constantly salutes<lb/> one as soon as you enter the door. It is well
                that<lb/> some folks have stronger nerves than others.
                <persName>Rachel</persName><lb/> is the whole day with him, and <add>?</add> when
                she can be<lb/> away from her school. It will probably not before next week<lb/>
                that he will be able to sit up or to get up without some<lb/> assistance. Several
                young men have sat up with him<lb/> every night, and <persName>Mrs.
                    Cozens</persName> also one night and <persName>S.</persName>
                <add>?</add><lb/> two. He receives a good deal of attention, as he is generally<lb/>
                liked. I myself have not offered to stay with him; first<lb/> I am not well enough
                to do so, and secondly, <hi rend="underline">I must do to</hi><lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">all the Congregation alike</hi>, and as I cannot sit up with
                all, I must<lb/> decline offering such assistance to all. I have been
                frequently<lb/> to see him. He is very restless; but this is natural enough</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>as he can scarcely use his hand, and could up to yesterday keep<lb/> but little in
                his stomach. His uncle was to see him on <date>Sabbath</date>;<lb/> he invited him
                to go to his house again but <persName>David</persName> is not able<lb/> to be
                moved, even if he had accepted the invitation.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">For my own part, I feel somewhat better today; the attack<lb/> of
                pain in my head, which I had last <date>Sunday</date> evening at your house<lb/> has
                not left me; of course I did not expect it, knowing<lb/> that it is too good a
                friend to leave me in a hurry. However,<lb/> thank God, I have so far without being
                compelled to give up,<lb/> and this is about all I can look for with my rickety
                health.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I had partly looked for a letter; but I hope not to be too<lb/> long
                    d'<sic>sappointed</sic>.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Please tell uncle that I will write to him as soon as<lb/> he can
                read again; but at present he had better not be<lb/> d'sturbed with such things. My
                best regard to <persName>Messrs. Judah</persName><lb/> &amp;
                    <persName>Block</persName>, <persName>Mrs. Dr. Pass</persName>, <persName>Mrs.
