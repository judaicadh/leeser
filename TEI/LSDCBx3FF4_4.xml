				<p rend="align(center)"><placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> <date>Nov 19th 5598</date>.</p>
				<p>Dear Aunt.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">When <persName>Mr. Cohen</persName> left me on <date>Wednesday</date> afternoon he said<lb/> that he would call to see me before he left&#44; but he did not<lb/> do so&#44; no doubt owing to the bad weather on <date>Thursday</date> evening.<lb/> I hope that before this uncle <persName>A<add>&#63;</add></persName> is much better&#44; and able to<lb/> help himself a little&#44; and that your eyes do not hurt<lb/> you as much as they did last week. When I came<lb/> home I found that <persName>David Peixotto</persName> was very sick with<lb/> the inflammatory rheumatism&#59; he is sick yet&#44; and<lb/> quite unable to help himself&#44; but still he is better<lb/> than he has been. It is not very pleasant to be<lb/> sick at a boarding house&#44; especially where he is if it<lb/> were my case I would not be able to stand it&#44; on account<lb/> of the greasy smell of cooking which constantly salutes<lb/> one as soon as you enter the door. It is well that<lb/> some folks have stronger nerves than others. <persName>Rachel</persName><lb/> is the whole day with him&#44; and <add>&#63;</add> when she can be<lb/> away from her school. It will probably not before next week<lb/> that he will be able to sit up or to get up without some<lb/> assistance. Several young men have sat up with him<lb/> every night&#44; and <persName>Mrs. Cozens</persName> also one night and <persName>S.</persName> <add>&#63;</add><lb/> two. He receives a good deal of attention&#44; as he is generally<lb/> liked. I myself have not offered to stay with him&#59; first<lb/> I am not well enough to do so&#44; and secondly&#44; <hi rend="underline">I must do to</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">all the Congregation alike</hi>&#44; and as I cannot sit up with all&#44; I must<lb/> decline offering such assistance to all. I have been frequently<lb/> to see him. He is very restless&#59; but this is natural enough</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>as he can scarcely use his hand&#44; and could up to yesterday keep<lb/> but little in his stomach. His uncle was to see him on <date>Sabbath</date>&#59;<lb/> he invited him to go to his house again but <persName>David</persName> is not able<lb/> to be moved&#44; even if he had accepted the invitation.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">For my own part&#44; I feel somewhat better today&#59; the attack<lb/> of pain in my head&#44; which I had last <date>Sunday</date> evening at your house<lb/> has not left me&#59; of course I did not expect it&#44; knowing<lb/> that it is too good a friend to leave me in a hurry. However&#44;<lb/> thank God&#44; I have so far without being compelled to give up&#44;<lb/> and this is about all I can look for with my rickety health.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I had partly looked for a letter&#59; but I hope not to be too<lb/> long d&#39;<sic>sappointed</sic>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Please tell uncle that I will write to him as soon as<lb/> he can read again&#59; but at present he had better not be<lb/> d&#39;sturbed with such things. My best regard to <persName>Messrs. Judah</persName><lb/> &#38;  <persName>Block</persName>&#44; <persName>Mrs. Dr. Pass</persName>&#44; <persName>Mrs. Block</persName>&#44; <persName>Mr. &#38;  Mrs. Cohen</persName>&#44; the <persName>Ettings</persName><lb/> and <persName>Abby</persName> &#38;  <persName>Rachel</persName>. Do not  however omit <persName>Mr. Anger</persName> and<lb/> other inquiring friends&#59; likewise <persName>Dr. Potter</persName> &#38;  cousin <persName>Ben</persName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">As <persName>Mr Weil</persName> said he was going today to <placeName>Baltimore</placeName><lb/> I shall put up three Daily Prayer Books to complete the<lb/> sets you have at your house&#59; if he does not go I shall send<lb/> this by mail without the books of course.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Wishing you much health &#38;  happiness</p>
			<p rend="indent(6)">I remain</p>
			<p rend="indent(6)">your obt nephew</p>
			<p rend="indent(7)"><persName role="author">Isaac Leeser</persName>.</p>
