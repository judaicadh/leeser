            <p rend="indent(3)">Having a few minutes leisure before<lb/> synagogue I embrace it
                gladly to reply to your last which<lb/> for my inclination has remained too long
                unanswered. I regret<lb/> much that you did not order my article to be altered as I
                requested<lb/> you, since it will force me to continue the said article to a
                greater<lb/> length than agreeable to me. But as you say it was unavoidably so<lb/>
                I must be content. You are mistaken however if you think I don't<lb/> know what
                inconvenience it causes to alter a form. I have seen<lb/> a great deal of printing
                in my time and have corrected more than<lb/> one proof for the press. My dear
                    <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> you must not again<lb/> write me “I am a little
                tired of a work that brings me nothing<lb/> but vexation” You are yet too young in
                your vocation to cry<lb/> with <persName>Solomon</persName> — <add>מה יתרון לאדם בכל
                    עמלו שיעמל תחת השמש</add> nor can<lb/> you with any truth say with him

                    <add>?</add> is worth having. You, no doubt,<lb/> with me, think one roar of the
                lion more agreeable than 50 brays<lb/> of the jackass. And these roars of the lions
                (not of <placeName>New York</placeName> or<lb/>
                <placeName>Richmond</placeName>) you have. What more then do you want? Is it
                assistance,<lb/> look through your vol. 6, and see whether I have not done<lb/> my
                share. I never asked any other return than what you chose<lb/> to give me. Your
                favorable opinion was enough for me.<lb/> You are not a Saxon, don't be a grumbler
                then but continue<lb/> like a good boy at your task. If you continue to perform it
                as<lb/> properly as heretofore, the <hi rend="underline">Sugarphim</hi><add>?</add>

            <p>neglect it and expect to receive what we used to style in our<lb/> Hebrew school —
                palackas. I promise you that the first one<lb/> you get shall be from from the hand
                (if it be alive) that is now<lb/> perusing these words. So look out. Now I shall
                give you a little<lb/> more vexation in respect to the Occident à la

                    <persName>Mr. I.</persName> I should like to know how you expect to keep<lb/> a
                subscriber when you send your numbers so irregularly. Here is the<lb/> half of

                them, And then the<lb/> circular that was to go with them, why how can we know
                what's<lb/> going on. The Proposed assembly may be no longer a proposed
                assembly<lb/> but have already taken place to and we poor unfortunate neglected<lb/>
                and abandoned creatures know nothing of it If this isn't enough<lb/> to make a
                person swear I don't know what is. Take care<lb/> your eyes for if they get near my
                nails <persName>Mr I</persName> I don't know<lb/> what the consequences might not be
                — but really you<lb/> must be a little more regular in sending them i.e. in
                getting<lb/> your agent in <placeName>New York</placeName> to do so, for I hear it
                is his fault.<lb/> It is doubly disagreeable for a correspondent to receive them
                so<lb/> late as there might be some Er<add>?</add> to be made in his<lb/> article
                which he would like to send forth next number.<lb/> I shall say no more about it now
                because I hope that you<lb/> will take steps to let us have them in future by the
                    <date>6th</date> or <date>7th</date> of<lb/> the month. I shall write to
                    <placeName>England</placeName> the<add>?</add> endeavor to press the<lb/> sale
                of these. I don't think you have a good agent in <persName>Mrs Joel</persName><lb/>
                She lives in <placeName>F<add>?</add> Street</placeName> which is entirely out of
                the world<lb/> and especially out of the Jewish world. I think <persName>Sam'<lb/>
                    Solomons</persName> of <placeName>Bevis Marks</placeName> would be able to push
                the sale</p>

            <p>better. Did you ever try him? Not having received the <date>March</date><lb/>
                Occident I have not seen the circular. As soon as received I shall<lb/> call a
                meeting of the congregation and we will doubtless not be<lb/> needful. I am a <hi
                    rend="underline">little vext</hi> at the delay of the Occident this
                <add>?</add><lb/> There is no other congregation in <placeName>Canada</placeName>
                but the <add>?</add> in <placeName>Montreal</placeName><lb/> and the German one that
                formerly existed <hi rend="underline">is on its last legs</hi>. They<lb/> were but a

                in a synagogue above all in a<lb/> Portuguese synagogue the <add>פסוך</add> of which
                they “<add>?</add>.”<lb/> As for my long being inclined to support the assembly
                without<lb/> being able to say <add>?</add> with <persName>Dr. Cantwell</persName> I
                can lead the<lb/> poor deluded men where I please” I think I shall be able to<lb/>
                induce within them a <sic>favourable</sic> opinion on these matters.<lb/> If you
                don't go to <placeName>New Orleans</placeName> I shall expect you in
                    <placeName>Canada</placeName><lb/> this summer. Let me know whether you come and
                I will<lb/> prepare a room for you in my house which is next door<lb/> to
                    <persName>Mrs Josephs</persName>. <persName>Mr and Mrs JHJ</persName> and
                    <persName>Miss Sarah J</persName> start<lb/>
                <date>Sunday</date>, I believe for the <placeName>States</placeName>. Is it true
                that <persName>Nathan</persName><lb/> has given up his situation in <placeName>St.
                    Thomas</placeName> and is now in <placeName>New<lb/> Orleans</placeName> with
                        <persName>Carillon<add>?</add></persName> also. That this letter worthy
                who<lb/> is required by all as a madman should care to look for<lb/> another nest, I
                am not at all surprised for he has made the<lb/>
                <placeName>West Indies</placeName> “too hot to hold him” but <persName>Mr.
                    Nathan</persName> what<lb/> does he run about for. I can't help thinking that it
                is<lb/> a great pity he ever gave up his situation in
                    <placeName>Kingston</placeName>. I<lb/> sincerely hope that those congregations
                wanting a Hazan in<lb/> the <placeName>States</placeName> will be especially
                carefully of <persName>Carillon<add>?</add></persName>. He has<lb/>
                <add>?</add> discord wherever he has been — and will continue to<lb/> do so wherever
                he goes. And then his principles, as <sic>accomodating</sic></p>
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>as the weather cock to every puff of wind. I hope that you<lb/> will keep your eye
                upon him, and <hi rend="underline">look to the interests</hi><lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">of our cause</hi>. You will understand me. I never saw
                    <persName>Carillon</persName><lb/> in my life have never corresponded with him
                but what I do<lb/> know of him as a Rabbi and Teacher I can't admire. And more<lb/>
                I ask you keep your eye on him. With respect to the situation<lb/> at
                    <placeName>Richmond</placeName> I have written to <persName>Mr. Hyman</persName>
                for farther particulars but<lb/> I confess more with the intention of ascertaining
                whether the situation<lb/> as worthy the acceptance of my brother in law Hazan
                    <persName>Mendes</persName><lb/> of <placeName>Montego Bay</placeName>. He is a
                most worthy &amp; talented young man, a gentleman<lb/> and scholar and quite
                orthodox. I would like him to be near me<lb/> I did not mention names to

                say with all my<lb/> heart, most lamentable that with such a field before him he
