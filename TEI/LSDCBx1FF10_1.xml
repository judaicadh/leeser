                              <p>Rev. Sir:</p>
                              <p rend="indent(1)">I hope that you will excuse me only this once, for
                                        troubling you so fre-<lb/>quently. I hope this is enough
                                        also for the letters that may still come. Yes-<lb/>terday
                                        about 12 midnight, <persName>Mr. Yaroslausky</persName> read
                                        for me the letter of <persName>Mr.<lb/> Oliver</persName>.
                                        To be brief—with regard to the food that I ate along with
                                        him, that<lb/> is true. But what was it we were eating? Last
                                        time when I sent my resigna-<lb/>tion to the congregation
                                        and accepted the position in the synagogue, as I have
                                        written to<lb/> you several times before, I asked him where
                                        I should be until I went there<lb/> whereupon, he replied
                                        that his wife and family are in the country and that he<lb/>
                                        himself had to depart that night or early the next morning,
                                        but that I could<lb/> leave my luggage with him. He left at
                                        home only one black man who went<lb/> to work every day to
                                        earn his bread. There was no other maid servant in the<lb/>
                                        house. I brought my things there. We talked until quite late
                                        at night. It<lb/> was about midnight when I said, “I'm quite
                                        hungry”. He replied, “The<lb/> house is quite empty—not even
                                        bread.” Nevertheless, he sent his negro who<lb/> got some
                                        milk and bread. That is what we ate together. Now you can
                                        see<lb/> how lies begin with truth. What can I say in reply?
                                        Before dawn, he had to leave<lb/> at one time he had
                                        recommended me to one of his friends who had asked<lb/> me
                                        to pay him a visit. I came to him once but found him out. I
                                        spent<lb/> more than two hours there, because of the many
                                        books which he possessed<lb/> but could not wait for him. I
                                        left and never came to him again<lb/> and never saw him. How
                                        I conducted myself afterwards, I have al-<lb/>ready told
                                        you. I asked the people of <placeName>Montgomery</placeName>
                                        on several occasions to<lb/> come out and see and convince
                                        themselves.</p>

                                        doing it in order to fool anybody<lb/> Here no one comes. I
                                        did not know this man was coming. I wasn't<lb/> doing it for
                                        the sake of the two negroes who do the slaughtering here.
                                        And<lb/> if you suppose that I did not shave myself because

                              <p>some chickens to you to be slaughtered. Now you are here.”<lb/> I
                                        said, “I did not bring the slaughtering knife”, whereupon
                                        she<lb/> replied, “Our clerk used to be a schochet. He has a
                                        slaughtering<lb/> knife as well as a sharpening stone.” The
                                        clerk showed me a<lb/> razor which he had fixed up for a
                                        slaughtering knife. I then said<lb/> “I shall not slaughter
                                        here with this knife unless you make<lb/> me a present of
                                        it.” Thereupon, he gave it to me, and I still<lb/> have
                                        it.</p>

                                                  Davis</persName> comes, has a school. Now,<lb/>
                                        <del>both</del> each of these says that I adopted his faith.
                                        In this he was<lb/> all wrong. At one time we discussed the
                                        various peculiarities of their belief<lb/> We spoke about
                                        the Presbyterians, who believe that man has no choice
                                        of<lb/> good or evil, for everything is already predestined
                                        by God. I said that<lb/> where there is no freedom of
                                        choice, there can be no reward and<lb/> punishment, for
                                        reward and punishment can be only where there<lb/> is
                                        freedom of choice. That is why I could not understand<lb/>
                                        that belief at all, and that, from that point of view, there
                                        belief<lb/> was superior. But I have quite forgotten one
                                        point, namely, just<lb/> what I said about their faith as to
                                        why it must be false.</p>
                              <p rend="indent(1)">With regard to the first chapter of <hi
                                                  rend="underline">Matthew</hi>?, <persName>Mr.
                                                  Yaroslausky</persName><lb/> tells me what he
                                        writes, and I am very much surprised. I assure you<lb/> that
                                        we discussed it once. This is an old question. The
                                        generations<lb/> are not properly written down, but I also
                                        asked him this: It is true<lb/> that when you speak of God,
                                        you believe there is only one God, but when<lb/> you mention
                                        the name of his person he seems to be three, namely,<lb/>
                                        Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Thus when you speak of the
                                        Father<lb/> and mention the son, the son must be the Son of
                                        the person whom you call<lb/> Father. In Matthew, however,
                                        it is written that the angel had told<lb/>
                                        <persName>Joseph</persName> that <persName>Mary</persName>
                                        would become pregnant through the Holy Ghost. Then<lb/> how
                                        is that? To this he answered that Father and Holy Ghost are
                                        the same<lb/> Then I again said “Are they there then two or
                                        one?” To this he has<lb/> not given me any answer to this
                                        day. You can rest assured that if<lb/> I was surprised,
                                        which I do not remember any more, my surprise<lb/> was due
                                        to the stupidity of the people who believe this. With regard
                                        to<lb/> the case of the $70, I answer you that I once spoke
                                        to <persName>Mr. Davis</persName></p>
                              <pb n="6"/>
                              <p>when he asked me what my salary was here in

                                        it was $500. He said to me, you should have doubled that
                                        if<lb/> you came over to us. And then, casually, I said,
                                        “Would you do this<lb/> and give $1000 for this? And he
                                        said, “Yes, certainly, if only you say<lb/> that you are
                                        coming over.” Then I said, “It might be right for a man<lb/>
                                        to change after having brought his mind upon the right road
                                        with regard<lb/> to eternity, but when he receives money for
                                        it, then he has already re-<lb/>ceived his rewards here, and
                                        he cannot, therefore, come to eternity. But<lb/> you do your
                                        work completely without thought. It is one thing to lead
                                        a<lb/> man away from his religion, but another to destroy
                                        him—a thing which<lb/> are forbidden to do”. The $70 I
                                        counted for two persons for three<lb/> months' instruction—a

                                        I told him I was in a house of one of<lb/> my congregation.
                                        He asked me to go with him to a church where he<lb/> was

                                        according to Jewish<lb/> law, I should be believed. For
