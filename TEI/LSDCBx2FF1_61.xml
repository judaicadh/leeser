				<p>Very honored <addressee>Mr. Leeser</addressee>&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In the hope that it would be possible to send you the money<lb/> collected for the Bible and the &#8220;Occident&#8221;&#44; I postponed my writing to you<lb/> from week to week.  The punishment for my waiting is that in spite of the<lb/> efforts&#44; the success is a very insignificant one.  The following of your<lb/> subscribers are already in possession of your work&#44; and i beg of you to<lb/> take notice of this&#58; <persName>Emanuel Lieberman</persName>&#44; &#36;8.&#59; <persName>M. L. Sale</persName>&#44; &#36;10.&#59; <persName>S. Bamberger</persName>&#44; &#36;8.&#59;<lb/> <persName>G. I. Jessel</persName>&#44; &#36;10.&#59; <persName>Emanuel Bamberger</persName>&#44; &#36;10.&#59; <persName>S. Ullman</persName>&#44; &#36;10.&#59; <persName>L. Lowenson</persName>&#44; &#36;8.&#59;<lb/> <persName>M. Straus</persName>&#44; &#36;12.&#59; <persName>Abraham Dinkelspiel&#44; Jr.</persName>&#44; &#36;10.&#59; <persName>A. Dinkelspiel</persName>&#44; &#36;8.&#59; <persName>Jacob<lb/> Wurzburger</persName>&#44; &#36;10&#59; <persName>Ch.Lichten</persName>&#44; &#36;10.&#59; <persName>S.Maas</persName>&#44; &#36;8.&#59; <persName>H. Seliger</persName>&#44; 8.&#59; <persName>S.Bach</persName>&#44; 8.&#59;<lb/> <persName>Sol Hart</persName>&#44; 8.&#59; <persName>S.Selliger</persName>&#44; 8.&#59; <persName>Rev. Anderson</persName> &#40;who removed to the country since&#41;<lb/> 8.&#59; <persName>Benjamin M. Crump</persName>&#44; 8&#8212;<persName role="author">B. H. Gotthelf</persName>&#44; 8.</p>
				<p>All together 24 to whom I have already delivered it.  Since then the<lb/> following men have moved from here&#58; <persName>David Dinkelspiel</persName> to <placeName>California</placeName>&#44;<lb/> <persName>H. Stern</persName>&#44; to <placeName>Ohio</placeName>&#44; <persName>L. Silverman</persName> to <placeName>Indiana</placeName>.  I still have to deliver to<lb/> the following&#58; <persName>M. Godshaw</persName>&#44; who is <sic>noe</sic> in <placeName>New York</placeName> on a buying trip&#44; <persName>M. A.<lb/> Kohn</persName>&#44; in <placeName>New Albany</placeName>&#44; and <persName>B. Sachs</persName>&#44; who denies from beginning to end that<lb/> he ever subscribed.  I shall still find the opportunity to send them to<lb/> <persName>Stern</persName> and <persName>Silverman</persName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">For the past four months&#44; I am running around to collect for<lb/> you and only the following have paid me&#58; <persName>E. Lieberman</persName>&#44; &#36;8.&#59; <persName>M. L. Sale</persName>&#44; &#36;10.&#59;<lb/> <persName>S. <sic>SELLIGer</sic></persName>&#44; &#36;8.&#59; <persName>Abraham Dinkelspiel</persName>&#44; &#36;10&#8212;together therefore &#36;36.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I was in <placeName>Albany</placeName> and they have no money there.  Most of them<lb/> promised to pay towards the end of <date>July</date> and <date>August</date>&#44; when their heavy bus&#45;<lb/>iness payments will have been attended to.  I cannot possibly go the same<lb/> man three or four times for I feel that he might develop a bad opinion of<lb/> me.  One would not have thought that such a small matter would make any<lb/> difference to people but when I tell you that <persName>Emanuel Bamberger</persName>&#44; a man<lb/> with a capital of &#36;50&#44;000&#44; refused to pay me for that reason&#44; less<lb/> wealthy men are not to be surprised at.  Aside from that many&#44; like Lich&#45;</p>  <p rend="the following word is handwritten">Finished</p> <p rend="the following name is continued on the next page"><persName>Lich&#45;ten</persName></p>

				<p>ten&#44; <persName>Sol Hart</persName>&#44; <persName>Bach</persName>&#44; <persName>Godshaw</persName>&#44; <persName>Ullman</persName>&#44; etc.&#44; are not even here.  Herewith<lb/> you receive all that I have.  Add to that &#36;9.75 which I spent for you.<lb/>  The check cost me 60 cents.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I have not sold a single copy of Dias down to the present<lb/> time.  Of prayer books&#44; I haven&#39;t received any and those that I requested&#44;<lb/> you need not send until about Rosh Hashonnah.  The bill which you sent me<lb/> in your letter of &#8212; cannot possibly be correct.  Have the goodness to<lb/> look through the records again&#44; and all the letters which I sent you since<lb/> <date>1850</date>.  Note these and let me know.  After that I shall try to adjust all<lb/> that is missing.  In your subscription lists for the &#8220;Occident&#8221; there is<lb/> such a confusion that I am quite unable to make anything of it.  When I<lb/> canvass&#44; no one outside of your older subscribers wants to hear anything<lb/> about it&#44; or owe anything for it.  when you realize your decision again<lb/> to make a trip to the <placeName>west</placeName>&#44; it will probably be advantageous for you in<lb/> every respect.  You have not answered my last letter&#44; in which I asked<lb/> you to suggest a subject for our school which is about to be built.  Per&#45;<lb/>haps this was due to your waiting for the letter I promised you&#44; but I<lb/> could not write it for the reason that uncertainty continued<lb/> to hang over the entire project.  It may still fail.  We have elected an<lb/> English teacher&#44; whose duties are to commence at the first of <date>September</date>&#44;<lb/> at a salary of &#36;600. a year&#44; but the projected schoolhouse has not yet<lb/> been begun.  In a very short time I shall be able to inform you how<lb/> things are going in this respect.  I hope to God that the plan will not<lb/> fail.  And now&#44; my dear <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>&#44; I want to tell you something about<lb/> my private affairs.  Since the appearance of the last &#8220;Occident&#8221;&#44; I have<lb/> received letters from <placeName>San Francisco</placeName>&#44; not officially&#44; but from several <sic>f</sic><lb/> friends who advise me to try to get the position there.  What do you<lb/> think about it&#63;  Will you advise me to do so&#44; and will you also perhaps<lb/> help me&#63;  These are the best years of my life.  I have a good position<lb/> <date>6&#45;20&#45;1854</date></p>

				<p>here and perhaps even a secure one.  But to this day I am still as poor<lb/> as 5 years ago and every year I have to depend upon the uncertain favor<lb/> of every ass.  Perhaps I ought to be careful and not seek after that po&#45;<lb/>sition.  Perhaps you can let me know the exact conditions and tell me <sic>f</sic><lb/> frankly whether you consider me sufficiently fitted or not and whether you<lb/> will recommend me for it.  Since my stay here I have had unusual practice<lb/> in the matter of preaching and without being immodest I think I can say<lb/> that I perfected myself in it.  I feel that I can fill that position.<lb/>  Please write to me about it as soon as possible.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Dr. Wise</persName> was here.  His books are practically all lying around here.<lb/>  His subscribers do not want to take them up.  Personally and in writing&#44;<lb/> he asked me to do something about it&#44; but I explained to him unhesitating&#45;<lb/>ly that it was contrary to my principles to further in any respect a work<lb/> so destructive of Judaism.</p>
