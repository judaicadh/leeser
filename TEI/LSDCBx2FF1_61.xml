            <p>Very honored <addressee>Mr. Leeser</addressee>:</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">In the hope that it would be possible to send you the money<lb/>
                collected for the Bible and the “Occident”, I postponed my writing to you<lb/> from
                week to week. The punishment for my waiting is that in spite of the<lb/> efforts,
                the success is a very insignificant one. The following of your<lb/> subscribers are
                already in possession of your work, and i beg of you to<lb/> take notice of this:
                    <persName>Emanuel Lieberman</persName>, $8.; <persName>M. L. Sale</persName>,
                $10.; <persName>S. Bamberger</persName>, $8.;<lb/>
                <persName>G. I. Jessel</persName>, $10.; <persName>Emanuel Bamberger</persName>,
                $10.; <persName>S. Ullman</persName>, $10.; <persName>L. Lowenson</persName>, $8.;<lb/>

                    <persName>S.Maas</persName>, $8.; <persName>H. Seliger</persName>, 8.;

                    Gotthelf</persName>, 8.</p>
            <p>All together 24 to whom I have already delivered it. Since then the<lb/> following
                men have moved from here: <persName>David Dinkelspiel</persName> to
                    <placeName>California</placeName>,<lb/>
                <persName>H. Stern</persName>, to <placeName>Ohio</placeName>, <persName>L.
                    Silverman</persName> to <placeName>Indiana</placeName>. I still have to deliver
                to<lb/> the following: <persName>M. Godshaw</persName>, who is <sic>noe</sic> in
                    <placeName>New York</placeName> on a buying trip, <persName>M. A.<lb/>
                    Kohn</persName>, in <placeName>New Albany</placeName>, and <persName>B.
                    Sachs</persName>, who denies from beginning to end that<lb/> he ever subscribed.
                I shall still find the opportunity to send them to<lb/>
                <persName>Stern</persName> and <persName>Silverman</persName>.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">For the past four months, I am running around to collect for<lb/>
                you and only the following have paid me: <persName>E. Lieberman</persName>, $8.;
                    <persName>M. L. Sale</persName>, $10.;<lb/>
                <persName>S. <sic>SELLIGer</sic></persName>, $8.; <persName>Abraham

            <p rend="indent(1)">I was in <placeName>Albany</placeName> and they have no money there.
                Most of them<lb/> promised to pay towards the end of <date>July</date> and
                    <date>August</date>, when their heavy bus-<lb/>iness payments will have been
                attended to. I cannot possibly go the same<lb/> man three or four times for I feel
                that he might develop a bad opinion of<lb/> me. One would not have thought that such
                a small matter would make any<lb/> difference to people but when I tell you that

                refused to pay me for that reason, less<lb/> wealthy men are not to be surprised at.

            <p rend="indent(1)">I have not sold a single copy of Dias down to the present<lb/> time.
                Of prayer books, I haven't received any and those that I requested,<lb/> you need
                not send until about Rosh Hashonnah. The bill which you sent me<lb/> in your letter
                of — cannot possibly be correct. Have the goodness to<lb/> look through the records
                again, and all the letters which I sent you since<lb/>
                <date>1850</date>. Note these and let me know. After that I shall try to adjust
                all<lb/> that is missing. In your subscription lists for the “Occident” there
                is<lb/> such a confusion that I am quite unable to make anything of it. When I<lb/>
                canvass, no one outside of your older subscribers wants to hear anything<lb/> about
                it, or owe anything for it. when you realize your decision again<lb/> to make a trip
                to the <placeName>west</placeName>, it will probably be advantageous for you in<lb/>
                every respect. You have not answered my last letter, in which I asked<lb/> you to
                suggest a subject for our school which is about to be built. Per-<lb/>haps this was
                due to your waiting for the letter I promised you, but I<lb/> could not write it for
                the reason that uncertainty continued<lb/> to hang over the entire project. It may
                still fail. We have elected an<lb/> English teacher, whose duties are to commence at
                the first of <date>September</date>,<lb/> at a salary of $600. a year, but the
                projected schoolhouse has not yet<lb/> been begun. In a very short time I shall be
                able to inform you how<lb/> things are going in this respect. I hope to God that the
                plan will not<lb/> fail. And now, my dear <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>, I want to
                tell you something about<lb/> my private affairs. Since the appearance of the last
                “Occident”, I have<lb/> received letters from <placeName>San Francisco</placeName>,
                not officially, but from several <sic>f</sic><lb/> friends who advise me to try to
                get the position there. What do you<lb/> think about it? Will you advise me to do
                so, and will you also perhaps<lb/> help me? These are the best years of my life. I
                have a good position<lb/>

            <p>here and perhaps even a secure one. But to this day I am still as poor<lb/> as 5
                years ago and every year I have to depend upon the uncertain favor<lb/> of every
                ass. Perhaps I ought to be careful and not seek after that po-<lb/>sition. Perhaps
                you can let me know the exact conditions and tell me <sic>f</sic><lb/> frankly
                whether you consider me sufficiently fitted or not and whether you<lb/> will
                recommend me for it. Since my stay here I have had unusual practice<lb/> in the
                matter of preaching and without being immodest I think I can say<lb/> that I
                perfected myself in it. I feel that I can fill that position.<lb/> Please write to
                me about it as soon as possible.</p>
