            <p>Rev &amp; Dear Friend</p>
            <p rend="indent(3)">I read every num-<lb/>ber of your valuable periodical with<lb/>
                pleasurable interest, your leaders<lb/> especially possess for me great<lb/>
                interest, I read and digest them<lb/> carefully and form <sic>judgement</sic>
                in<lb/> accordance as they impress or con-<lb/>vince my intellect.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The popular style in<lb/> which these articles are written is
                well<lb/> calculated to awaken thought and<lb/> their freedom from obstruse and<lb/>
                pedantic argument makes them ac<lb/>ceptable to the practical men who<lb/> compose
                the majority of your readers<lb/> and who have little time to devote<lb/> to the
                study of learned disquisitions.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">There is one theme I am most<lb/> desirous you should at your
                earliest<lb/> leisure prepare an article upon<lb/> either for a leader or not as
                you<lb/> may please. It is respecting the faith<lb/> of the Israelite in the coming
                of a<lb/> personal messiah. I would</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>suggest <del>your discuss</del> the title for the<lb/> article “Belief in the coming
                of a personal<lb/> messiah” I would open the article<lb/> in something like the
                following language<lb/> “One of the cardinal principles of faith<lb/> of a true
                Israelite is a belief in a person-<lb/>-al messiah. It is one of the thirteen
                    <del>a</del> fundamental articles<lb/> of our creed. It has been taught our<lb/>
                Jewish youth <del>since</del> in the past it has<lb/> been the accepted belief of
                all the great<lb/> Rabbis and learned teachers of <placeName>Israel</placeName><lb/>
                <del>which</del> with a very few exceptions—and it is<lb/> so imbued into our
                Religion as to make<lb/> it one of its most vital parts the removal<lb/> or
                destruction of which would lead<lb/> to the dissolution of our Religion itself.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)"><del>Taught</del> Given in the Pentateuch taught<lb/> by the
                Prophets inculcated by the Rabbins<lb/> and received by the Jewish youth from<lb/>
                the beginning it has been and is still<lb/> one of the fundamental principles of
                our<lb/> faith and must continue to be so long<lb/> as Judaism is preserved in its
                pristine<lb/> purity and truth “&amp;c &amp;c or in similar<lb/> language—the
                construction of the above<lb/> being imperfect from the haste in<lb/> which I have
                written. After an ex-</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>position of this fundamental principle I would give<lb/> all the passages in the
                Pentateuch and Pro<lb/>-phets that have special reference to it and<lb/> cite in
                addition, all the ancient authorities<lb/> (Rabbis) that received and sustained
                it.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Nay I would prove it conclusively<lb/> by irrefutable quotations of
                those whose<lb/> authority it would be absurd to deny<lb/> or refute. Do you quite
                comprehend<lb/> my wishes? If so will you be kind<lb/> enough to accede to them and
                in doing<lb/> so pardon me for the apparent counsel<lb/>
                <add>?</add> I have so impudently volunteered.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">My apology for this must be in<lb/> the awakened deep interest I
                have recently<lb/> taken in the subject. If a belief in the<lb/> coming of a
                personal messiah can be<lb/> proved to be correct based upon the re-<lb/>vealed word
                of God and those sages<lb/> who have interpreted <del>his</del> it—let it be<lb/>
                done now in as simple clear concise and<lb/> irrefutable manner as possible.
                Let<lb/> the article of faith be stated let the divine<lb/> passages be given and
                the Rabbinical<lb/> authorities cited so that there can be no<lb/> question of its
                truth. <persName>Dr M Kalisch</persName> of<lb/>
                <placeName>London</placeName> I see has recently published the<lb/> Book of Genesis
                after a translation from</p>
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>the original Hebrew—nay the Volume published<lb/> contains the Hebrew text with a
                translation<lb/> by <persName>Dr K</persName> and a full commentary
                illustra<lb/>ting the context, accompanied by philologi-<lb/>-cal remarks and
                concluding with a sum-<lb/>-mary of events. I have not of course seen the<lb/> work
                as it has not yet crossed the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName><lb/> (ie to my
                knowledge) it being published in <placeName>London</placeName><lb/> where
                    <persName>Dr K</persName> is a tutor in the family of <persName>Baron<lb/>
                    Rostchild</persName>—but it strikes me as being just<lb/> what is <hi
                    rend="underline">needed</hi> and I sincerely hope five<lb/> years will not
                elapse before the entire<lb/> 24 books will be similarly published. How<lb/> much I
                now wish you had delayed your publica<lb/>-tion a few years and then brought it out
                in this<lb/> manner. However you can still do a great<lb/> work by preparing a
                second volume to be<lb/> called a “key” which shall be a full<lb/> commentary &amp;c
                &amp;c. I intend writing you<lb/> again in a few days upon some other<lb/> important
                matters concerning our Religion<lb/> in the meanwhile I trust you will fully
                consider my request favorably</p>
            <p>With great esteem Sincerely Yours<lb/>
