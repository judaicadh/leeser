          <p rend="indent(1)">Dr Friend&#44;</p>
          <p rend="indent(3)">Your esteemed<lb/> fvr of the <date>19<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> Ins came safe to hand<lb/> with a note to my sister&#44; who begs me to<lb/> say in reply&#44; that she recollects during <persName>Mr<lb/> W. Life</persName>&#44; of his having received the Daily<lb/> Prayer as well as the other prayers&#44; that<lb/> he paid for the D Pryer &#38; when the others<lb/> were presented he declined taking them<lb/> because he did subscribe but for the single<lb/> volume&#44; my sister having a complete<lb/> as well as himself.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I am as anxious as possible that<lb/> your subscribers should pay them ar<lb/>&#45;rears regularly every year&#44; for when<lb/> they get two or 3 years in arrears it<lb/> is difficult to collect&#44; I will do all<lb/> I can to urge them&#44; those in the<lb/> country I have to write to&#44; as they<lb/> seldom are in town. <persName>Dr. Raphael</persName><lb/> has been <add>&#63;</add> since his<lb/> arrival&#44; he took a Room at the Pavillion<lb/> I enclose the Proceeding of your congre</p>

		<pb n="3"/>
			<p>&#38; the Doctor replied to him in not<lb/> the most affectionate manner&#44; for he<lb/> could not sanction or argue with any<lb/> man or any change that would prove<lb/> Sch<add>&#63;</add> in <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; however unimpor<lb/>tant the change&#44; &#38; then <persName>Mr P.</persName> undertook<lb/> in the presence of all the visitors &#38; step<lb/>&#45;ping from the object of his visit&#44;<lb/> went more fully in to the <del>reforms</del> innovations of his<lb/> congregation &#38; himself&#8212;the conversation<lb/> lasted about 2 Hours as <persName>Mr P.</persName> had to<lb/> leave on business but desired to continue<lb/> the Discussion&#44; when <persName>Mr Rosenfeldt</persName> sug<lb/>&#61;gested that the discussion or friendly con<lb/>versation be <add>&#63;</add> before Both<lb/> congregations at Hebrew Orphan Hall on<lb/> the <date>Sunday</date> following which was agreed<lb/> to by the Dr. I was much opposed to it the<lb/> more I reflected upon it &#38; it was not un<lb/>&#45;til the <date>Thursday</date> follg that I gave my consent<lb/> because I know his followers would not<lb/> admit their errors &#38; it was a <add>&#63;</add> of<lb/> time &#38; words.&#8212;The meeting took place<lb/> &#38; I need not tell you the result&#44; <persName>Mr<lb/> P</persName> was as a child in the hands of a giant</p>
		<pb n="4"/>
			<p>Before the Doctor would go into an<lb/> examination of the introduction of an<lb/> organ or the discontinuance of the<lb/> use of the 2d day of Festivals&#44; of which<lb/> <persName>Mr. P</persName> had brought a cartload of Books&#44;<lb/> the Doctor took him &#38; his followers &#8220;all<lb/> a back&#8221; &#40;as the suitors say&#41; &#38; struck<lb/> at the root of innovation&#44; &#38; the<lb/> main stay of Judaism. The Creed<lb/> &#8212;the addition &#38; the total abolition<lb/> of a portion The non <sic>fullfilment</sic><lb/> of the prophecy of the messiah&#8212;&#38; the resurrection<lb/> of the Dead&#44; which last article<lb/> you are aware of is not upon<lb/> their tablet in the synagogue</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">To give you an account of the<lb/> conversation would occupy too<lb/> much time &#38; paper&#44; but the con<lb/>clusion &#38; <add>&#63;</add> of <persName>Dr R</persName>&#44; of <persName>nu<lb/> Pos</persName> is that he is either a fool or<lb/> knave&#44; for he has hitherto palmed<lb/> on us&#44; as <persName>Albo</persName>&#39; opinion &#38; he thought<lb/> he could do it upon the Dr. the<lb/> opinions of others&#44; which <persName>Albo</persName> refutes<lb/> most powerfully &#38; which agrees with me<lb/> great sagery &#38; the great Marmonides</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">It so happened that the Doctor in his<lb/> excitement could not refer to the part<lb/> but he had translated it &#38; is in the <add>&#63;</add><lb/> Rev<add>&#63;</add> &#38; promised his audience to have<lb/> it reprinted at his own expense to<lb/> verify his assertion&#44; he has done so</p>
		<pb n="5"/>
			<p>But such a mokkas as <persName>P</persName> &#38; his<lb/> followers obtained was as merited<lb/> as it was severe. He told them<lb/> they were <add>&#63;</add> Jews. For <add>&#63;</add><lb/> are jews but those who believe in<lb/> the written &#38; oral Laws. The coming<lb/> of the Messiah &#38; the resurrection of<lb/> the dead.&#8212;They all felt the rebuke<lb/> &#38; they all say he is of course a<lb/> Bigot like you&#44; I suppose you&#39;ll<lb/> say you like to be in such com<lb/>&#45;pany if <lb/><persName>Dr. R</persName> is a bigot. The most<lb/> conspicuous of those who have felt<lb/> the truth of <persName>Dr R</persName> castigation is<lb/> <persName>Dr Philip Cohen</persName>&#44; to whom the Dr<lb/> had brought a letter from <persName>A Hart</persName><lb/> &#38; to whom <persName>Mr Josh Lazarus</persName> had sent<lb/> to me tickets for his lectures to dis<lb/>pose of &#38; to show how small a mat<lb/>ter it was he returned them in a<lb/> note saying &#8220;that the illiberal cause<lb/> of <persName>Dr R</persName> will prevent him from dis<lb/>posing of the tickets&#44; so you see<lb/> that the Dr might have made</p>

			<p>20 or 40 Dolls. but it so happens<lb/> that one Lecture had already taken<lb/> place &#38; yet <persName>Mr Cohen</persName> had not<lb/> distributed or used even a single<lb/> ticket&#8212;His Lectures therefore has<lb/> been attended by a most respec<lb/>table audience&#44; but not so nume<lb/>&#45;rous as I could have worked through<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> proportionate to our<lb/> population I am pleased to say that<lb/> all the Israelites in our city with one or two<lb/> exceptions have attended his lectures<lb/> &#38; have been most agreeable enter<lb/>tained &#38; enlightened&#44; he again Lectures<lb/> tomorrow at our Shool XXXVI Ezekiel<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> XXIV&#8212;&#38; on <date>Sunday</date> he addresses our<lb/> children &#38; teachers of the school.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I must stop <persName>Mr Levin</persName> is pre<lb/>paring an account of the<lb/> conversation &#38; intends sending it to<lb/> you. I have also sent a copy<lb/> of the proceedings as enclosed to the<lb/> Asmoneon&#8212;if not too late for the<lb/> <date>March</date> Occident will you mend<lb/> it&#63; I <add>&#63;</add> you are well</p>
