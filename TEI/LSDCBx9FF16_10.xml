                    Jacobs</persName> in the undisputed possession of the<lb/> field.” Ho ho, this
                is the <hi rend="underline">genteel mode</hi><lb/> in which an antagonist is to be
                treated S,<lb/> Good. The Dr complains of personalities<lb/> in one line, and in the
                next letter<lb/> a complete lesson from <persName>Bilimagate</persName><lb/>
                denouncing his opponent in language<lb/> which fully shows, the kind of

            <p>society in which the Dr has been reared.<lb/> It is certainly evident that the Dr
                did<lb/> not think of the Talmudical maxim<lb/> when he wrote his <sic>pice</sic>
                against me.<lb/> But the Dr. has forgotten some other<lb/> evidences which rise up
                against him<lb/> He <sic>looses</sic> sight of one thing, that he<lb/>
                <del>can</del> stated after the appearance of<lb/> my <hi rend="underline"
                    >first</hi> article that he would<lb/> answer me at the conclusion of my<lb/>
                argument. Was that article also<lb/> distaled<add>?</add>
                <del>by perso</del> in an <hi rend="underline">undignified</hi><lb/> and <hi
                    rend="underline">unbecoming</hi> manner?<lb/> If so why did he notice it at all?<lb/>
                <del>Why or if he did at Why</del> Or why did he not<lb/> if he thought that also offensive<lb/>
                <sic>characterise</sic> it as such and say<lb/> we will not reply to <persName>Mr
                    Jacobs</persName><lb/> for the same reasons that he has<lb/> furnished in the
                    <date>Feby</date> number.<lb/> Now it becomes extremely ludic-<lb/>rous for the
                Dr in the face of his<lb/> own declaration that he would<lb/> answer, try now to
                think the quest-<lb/>ion by remarks and reflections<lb/> on the style of his
                opponents writing<lb/>
                <del>The Dr has no alternative left<lb/> him but</del> He can not say

                <del>against</del> that the first article <del>in</del><lb/> was personally
                offensive and<lb/> therefore will not answer it<lb/> for <hi rend="underline">his

            <p>Supposing I had not written another<lb/> line after the first, was he not bound<lb/>
                to reply thereto after what he said about<lb/> replying in <hi rend="underline"
                    >plain household words</hi>”?<lb/> Where <del>is that the</del> is the answer
                    <hi rend="underline">in plain</hi><lb/> household words? Perhaps the<lb/> Dr
                meant what he has <hi rend="underline">written last</hi><lb/> in the Occident as
                “plain household<lb/> words” for there &amp; it must be <del>conf</del><lb/>
                confessed he has written very <hi rend="underline">plainly</hi><lb/> and has shown

                doubtlessly accustomed from his youth.</p>
            <p>Again I say the Dr has not paid<lb/> any mention to the Rabbinical<lb/> maxim which
                forms the heading<lb/> of this article. He forgets what<lb/> he said <del>to</del>
                in the Asmonian<lb/> when he proposed the startling<lb/> question, “Is <persName>Dr
                    Wise</persName> a Traitor”?<lb/> He therein censures those who will<lb/> not
                notice an antagonist &amp; <add>?</add><lb/> they may be beneath their notice.<lb/>
                How does this accord with his<lb/> present attitude towards me?<lb/> Am I so
                infinitely <hi rend="underline">beneath</hi> his<lb/> august notice so that he

                it be only<lb/> for once in the way—<sic>dont</sic> be so harsh<lb/> upon a weak
                antagonist. The great<lb/> should always look down on the lowly<lb/> and humble, you

                their<lb/> ostentatious appearance now and<lb/> then in the articles of our
                esteemed<lb/> friend the Dr.</p>
            <p>Again <del>the Dr</del> I say the Dr has not paid<lb/> any attention to the
                Rabbinical maxim<lb/> which forms the heading of this article</p>

            <p rend="align(right)">6</p>
            <p>The Dr cannot have forgotten (no no he<lb/> must have done so his memory I fear
                is<lb/> like his views) what the <persName>Rev I Leeser</persName><lb/> said in the
                last <date>January</date> member of<lb/> his Monthly in answer to his
                comp-<lb/>laint about some thing that transp-<lb/>ired in reference to <del>our
                    Dr</del> the former<lb/>
                <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> said that <del>he</del> if he found<lb/> any thing
                personally offensive <del>on</del> in<lb/> any paper sent to him he would<lb/>
                <del>?</del> run his pen <sic>throug</sic> the<lb/> objectionable passage—and
                he<lb/> likewise remarked that those<lb/> who wished something spicy better<lb/>
                look for it in other papers.</p>
            <p>Now after such a declaration<lb/> from <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> a
                gentleman<lb/> proverbial for being punctual<lb/> to his promise, is it not
                ridiculous<lb/> for <persName>Dr Mayer</persName> to complain of
                personal-<lb/>=ities &amp;c in my letters? Why either<lb/> they could have contained

                kept his word and applied<lb/> the pruning knife to the ungentlemanly<lb/> parts. If

                    <persName>Mr.<lb/> Leeser</persName> also, what an awful calamity<lb/> that will

            <p>Again I say the Dr has not bestowed any<lb/> attention on the Talmudic maxim with

                round them seven times<lb/> repeating a hymn in which he invokes<lb/> the angels to
                receive the soul—at the<lb/> same time laughing at the folly of the<lb/> Orthodox
                for believing in such <del>follies</del> nonsense<lb/> and then has the effrontery
