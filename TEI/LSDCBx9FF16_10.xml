				<p><del>He</del> &#8220;One who endeavors <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> to perpetrate an untenable assertion<lb/> should be careful in keeping his testim&#45;<lb/>ony at a respectable distance.&#8221;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">As this maxim is entirely Rabbinical<lb/> and as <persName>Dr Mayer</persName> of <placeName>Charleston SC</placeName><lb/> is <sic>strenously</sic> <sic>oposed</sic> to the Talmud<lb/> he has but proved himself consistent<lb/> in refusing to obey the above <sic>salutory</sic><lb/> lesson.  Now <persName>Dr Mayer</persName> has recently<lb/> made certain assertions which are<lb/> in direct keeping with his whole<lb/> <add>&#63;</add>&#8212;that is he has made assert&#45;<lb/>ions under the impression of receiving<lb/> <del>an</del> some credit from the public<lb/> for his sincerity and extreme gent&#45;<lb/><sic>lemany</sic> conduct&#44; but has unfortunate<lb/>ly forgotten <del>to keep at</del> that the<lb/> testimony against him is at no<lb/> great distance&#44; coming for the<lb/> like <del>the ghost of <persName>Hamlet</persName>&#44; and</del><lb/> <persName><sic>Shakespear&#39;s</sic></persName> Ghosts to denounce<lb/> the guilty <persName>Richard</persName>.</p>
				<p>The learned&#44; consistent&#44; <del>and</del> veracious&#44;<lb/> <del>and</del> undeviating&#44; <hi rend="underline">brave</hi>&#44; independent&#44;<lb/> Honest&#44; serious&#44; sincere&#44; honorable&#44;<lb/> gentlemanly&#44; <hi rend="underline">courteous</hi>&#44; and above all<lb/> <hi rend="underline">Pious</hi>&#44; <persName>Mayer</persName>&#44; <del>who</del> has declined answering<lb/> <del>its</del> me because I have not treated<lb/> <del>him personally offensive</del> the subject<lb/> on which I have written in the Occident<lb/> <del>&#63;</del> &#8220;in<lb/> a dignified and becoming man new&#8221;</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">2</p>
				<p>and because I have &#8220;descended to <sic>sarcasam</sic><lb/> and personalities&#44; instead of keeping the<lb/> subject above in view&#8221;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Well there is some thing reasonable<lb/> in this and his friends will of course give<lb/> him credit for the little tact he has at<lb/> once displayed in <hi rend="underline">creeping</hi> out of an<lb/> awkward position.  <del>but</del> So far no good&#44;<lb/> but unfortunately the Dr has spilt his<lb/> broth&#44; and spoilt his clean shirt too&#44; and<lb/> instead of presenting the appearance<lb/> of the modest and amiable young<lb/> gentleman&#44; who only addresses himself<lb/> to the respectable and <del>the</del> elite&#44;<lb/> has dropped his outer robe&#44; and<lb/> we see him in his true light.</p>
				<p>The Dr complains of personalities<lb/> but look here&#44; <add>&#63;</add> &#8220;Seeing however<lb/> that from his continuation in the same<lb/> <del>strain</del> number of your valuable magazine<lb/> that he deemed it proper to adopt such<lb/> a course&#44; <hi rend="underline">which no man of principle</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">and self respect</hi> can approve of I have<lb/> come to the determination herewith<lb/> to retract my promise and leave <persName>Mr<lb/> Jacobs</persName> in the undisputed possession of the<lb/> field.&#8221;  Ho ho&#44; this is the <hi rend="underline">genteel mode</hi><lb/> in which an antagonist is to be treated S&#44;<lb/> Good.  The Dr complains of personalities<lb/> in one line&#44; and in the next letter<lb/> a complete lesson from <persName>Bilimagate</persName><lb/> denouncing his opponent in language<lb/> which fully shows&#44; the kind of <del>metal</del></p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">3</p>
				<p>society in which the Dr has been reared.<lb/>  It is certainly evident that the Dr did<lb/> not think of the Talmudical maxim<lb/> when he wrote his <sic>pice</sic> against me.<lb/>  But the Dr. has forgotten some other<lb/> evidences which rise up against him<lb/> He <sic>looses</sic> sight of one thing&#44; that he<lb/> <del>can</del> stated after the appearance of<lb/> my <hi rend="underline">first</hi> article that he would<lb/> answer me at the conclusion of my<lb/> argument.  Was that article also<lb/> distaled<add>&#63;</add> <del>by perso</del> in an <hi rend="underline">undignified</hi><lb/> and <hi rend="underline">unbecoming</hi> manner&#63;<lb/>  If so why did he notice it at all&#63;<lb/> <del>Why or if he did at Why</del> Or why did he not<lb/> if he thought that also offensive<lb/> <sic>characterise</sic> it as such and say<lb/> we will not reply to <persName>Mr Jacobs</persName><lb/> for the same reasons that he has<lb/> furnished in the <date>Feby</date> number.<lb/>  Now it becomes extremely ludic&#45;<lb/>rous for the Dr in the face of his<lb/> own declaration that he would<lb/> answer&#44; try now to think the quest&#45;<lb/>ion by remarks and reflections<lb/> on the style of his opponents writing<lb/> <del>The Dr has no alternative left<lb/> him but</del>  He can not say <del>nothing</del><lb/> <del>against</del> that the first article <del>in</del><lb/> was personally offensive and<lb/> therefore will not answer it<lb/> for <hi rend="underline">his own words</hi> stand<lb/> <sic>patint</sic><add>&#63;</add> against him.</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">4</p>
				<p>Supposing I had not written another<lb/> line after the first&#44; was he not bound<lb/> to reply thereto after what he said about<lb/> replying in <hi rend="underline">plain household words</hi>&#8221;&#63;<lb/>  Where <del>is that the</del> is the answer <hi rend="underline">in plain</hi><lb/> household words&#63;  Perhaps the<lb/> Dr meant what he has <hi rend="underline">written last</hi><lb/> in the Occident as &#8220;plain household<lb/> words&#8221; for there &#38; it must be <del>conf</del><lb/> confessed he has written very <hi rend="underline">plainly</hi><lb/> and has shown the kind of &#8220;household<lb/> words&#8221; to which he has been <del>early</del><lb/> doubtlessly accustomed from his youth.</p>
				<p>Again I say the Dr has not paid<lb/> any mention to the Rabbinical<lb/> maxim which forms the heading<lb/> of this article.  He forgets what<lb/> he said <del>to</del> in the Asmonian<lb/> when he proposed the startling<lb/> question&#44; &#8220;Is <persName>Dr Wise</persName> a Traitor&#8221;&#63;<lb/>  He therein censures those who will<lb/> not notice an antagonist &#38; <add>&#63;</add><lb/> they may be beneath their notice.<lb/>  How does this accord with his<lb/> present attitude towards me&#63;<lb/>  Am I so infinitely <hi rend="underline">beneath</hi> his<lb/> august notice so that he <sic>wont</sic> on<lb/> any account turn a single glance<lb/> at me&#63;  Oh O&#63;  Dr if it be only<lb/> for once in the way&#8212;<sic>dont</sic> be so harsh<lb/> upon a weak antagonist.  The great<lb/> should always look down on the lowly<lb/> and humble&#44; you know that</p>
			<pb n="5"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">5</p>
				<p>the first great <hi rend="underline">Jewish Reformer</hi><lb/> a man who is much esteemed by<lb/> modern Pietists&#44; mingled with fish&#45;<lb/>ermen&#44; and said Oh <hi rend="underline">little</hi> chil&#45;<lb/>dren come ye unto me&#8221;&#44;  The <del>&#63;</del><lb/> <del>the humble shoul</del> truly great should not<lb/> scorn their inferiors.  Nor should those<lb/> who are <hi rend="underline">refined and honorable</hi>&#44; sincere<lb/> and filled &#8220;with a high regard for our holy<lb/> religion&#8221; speak so much of &#8220;hypocrisy and<lb/> inconsistency&#8221; among the Orthodox&#8212;<lb/> nor speak of person&#39;s <del>lives</del> &#8220;whose every<lb/> day life is a glaring contradiction to and<lb/> a most <sic>bear</sic> faced disavowal of their<lb/> religious <del>proff</del> professions&#8221; for these are<lb/> all naughty words&#44; <del>and</del> which are<lb/> calculated to raise the ire and <sic>wrauth</sic><lb/> of some folks&#44; and good&#44; <del>and</del> sincere&#44;<lb/> <del>and</del> gentlemanly and honorable preachers<lb/> should&#44; rather <del>ben</del> bend their <hi rend="underline">meek</hi><lb/> backs and bear the load of contum&#45;<lb/>ely and <add>&#63;</add> bestowed on<lb/> them by the ignorant and the law<lb/> than to retort in words which<lb/> some <sic>uncharatable</sic> people might<lb/> be disposed to say belie the grand&#45;<lb/>iloquent sentiments that make their<lb/> ostentatious appearance now and<lb/> then in the articles of our esteemed<lb/> friend the Dr.</p>
				<p>Again <del>the Dr</del> I say the Dr has not paid<lb/> any attention to the Rabbinical maxim<lb/> which forms the heading of this article</p>
			<pb n="6"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">6</p>
				<p>The Dr cannot have forgotten &#40;no no he<lb/> must have done so his memory I fear is<lb/> like his views&#41; what the <persName>Rev I Leeser</persName><lb/> said in the last <date>January</date> member of<lb/> his Monthly in answer to his comp&#45;<lb/>laint about some thing that transp&#45;<lb/>ired in reference to <del>our Dr</del> the former<lb/> <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> said that <del>he</del> if he found<lb/> any thing personally offensive <del>on</del> in<lb/> any paper sent to him he would<lb/> <del>&#63;</del> run his pen <sic>throug</sic> the<lb/> objectionable passage&#8212;and he<lb/> likewise remarked that those<lb/> who wished something spicy better<lb/> look for it in other papers.</p>
				<p>Now after such a declaration<lb/> from <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> a gentleman<lb/> proverbial for being punctual<lb/> to his promise&#44; is it not ridiculous<lb/> for <persName>Dr Mayer</persName> to complain of personal&#45;<lb/>&#61;ities &#38;c in my letters&#63;  Why either<lb/> they could have contained nothing<lb/> improper when addressed to <persName>Mr Leeser</persName><lb/> or he kept his word and applied<lb/> the pruning knife to the ungentlemanly<lb/> parts.  If neither then the Dr better<lb/> bring his charge <del>also</del> against <persName>Mr.<lb/> Leeser</persName> also&#44; what an awful calamity<lb/> that will be.  How will the paper<lb/> get on after it shall have received<lb/> the withering denunciation of <persName>Dr Mayer</persName></p>
			<pb n="7"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">7</p>
				<p>Again I say the Dr has not bestowed any<lb/> attention on the Talmudic maxim with which<lb/> I have headed this article.  He forgets<lb/> that for three years long he has been<lb/> assailing&#44; maligning&#44; abusing&#44; and insulting the Orthodox<lb/> Religion&#44; in the most vulgar style.<lb/>  The Talmud&#44; and the sacred principles<lb/> which it teaches&#44; the life spirit<lb/> which it has given to its v<add>&#63;</add><lb/> all these has he dared by recently<lb/> to stigmatize in the columns of<lb/> the Asmonean by the insolent name<lb/> of <hi rend="underline">strait jacket</hi>.  Yes he calls a<lb/> whole nation <hi rend="underline">madmen</hi>&#44; <sic>concoted</sic> a<lb/> sickening and revolting Simile&#44; paper<lb/> an <sic>odius</sic> remark upon the whole<lb/> house of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; calls them cheats<lb/> and robbers&#44; insults the belief of<lb/> old and young&#44; ploys the hypocrite<lb/> himself by denying a belief in the<lb/> Kabala which he insults the dead<lb/> by marching round them seven times<lb/> repeating a hymn in which he invokes<lb/> the angels to receive the soul&#8212;at the<lb/> same time laughing at the folly of the<lb/> Orthodox for believing in such <del>follies</del> nonsense<lb/> and then has the effrontery to say&#44; &#8220;We have<lb/> too <del>much res</del> high a regard for our holy religion<lb/> whether it presents itself in the shape of reform<lb/> or Orthodoxy&#44; as long as we see sincerity&#44; honesty&#44;<lb/> and consistency&#44; manifested to treat it with<lb/> sarcasm or ridicule.  For three years long<lb/> has he been indulging&#44; <del>his</del> in malignity&#44; and</p>
