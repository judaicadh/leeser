                <addressee>Rev I. Leeser</addressee>
            </p>
            <p rend="indent(2)">Rev Dear Sir</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The appearance of your second article on “Interments in<lb/> public
                cemeteries” interspersed with a few lines quoted from<lb/> my last communication to
                you has really surprised me.<lb/> What I expected, and I think reasonably expected,
                was<lb/> that you should either publish my letter as it was,<lb/> or reject it
                entirely. But to pick out a few sentences<lb/> and place them before the public
                overwhelmed by your<lb/> own comments is most unreasonable and unfair.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">You complain of my article not having been written<lb/> “in a spirit
                of respectful deference to our ecclesiastic-<lb/>al authorities.” This I cannot
                admit as I have said<lb/> nothing disrespectful of the personal character of
                either<lb/> of the Rabbis. I treated the subject and discussed the argu-<lb/>ments
                exclusively. But if we are not permitted to deal<lb/> with the opinions and
                decisions of higher officials, examine<lb/> them, and test their validity as whether
                they rest upon the<lb/> valid foundation of our canons, but are to submit
                blindly<lb/> to the judgment of others who happen to be placed in higher<lb/>
                positions than ourselves, then the study and knowledge of<lb/> our laws becomes a
                useless thing for Israelites in ordinary<lb/> positions of life, and then indeed
                freedom of speech or<lb/> religious questions would cease altogether even
                within<lb/> our own circle, and our religion degenerate into a<lb/> kind of popish
                subjection.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">As Editor and proprietor of the “Occident” you<lb/> have the
                undoubted right to insert or reject any</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>article sent in for publication; but I cannot concede<lb/> that you have a right to
                select portions of my communi-<lb/>cation; bring my name before the public with an
                ac-<lb/>cusation of disrespect towards functionaries who<lb/> have a claim to our
                esteem without giving me a<lb/> fair opportunity of being judged by the public.<lb/>
                Even the very sentences quoted from my article are some-<lb/>what altered in a
                manner that neither the subject-<lb/>matter represented in them nor their
                grammatical<lb/> construction reflect credit on me. You say<lb/> “you would not have
                noticed my piece at all,<lb/> although the subject is of general interest, were
                it<lb/> not that I might otherwise have resorted to the pub-<lb/>lications called
                    <sic>jewish</sic>, and pretended to say that I<lb/> could not obtain a hearing
                in this city.” But can<lb/> you truly say that I obtained a hearing in this<lb/>
                city by the publication of your long article<lb/> with a few fragments of my piece
                in it? If you<lb/> will point out wherein I have shown disrespect<lb/> to the
                Rabbi's personally I may alter or remove<lb/> those phrases but justice demands that
                you should<lb/> publish my article in its entire, especially now<lb/> as you have
                held me before the public in an un-<lb/>favorable light. Should you decline
                however<lb/> to do so rest assured that it will appear in some<lb/> form or other
                and perhaps is a more pungent form<lb/> than that in which I have written and if
                    <add>חלול השם</add><lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">must</hi> be the consequence the sin will not be at<lb/> my
                door but at the door of my opponents who</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>it seems will not cease their attacks and vitupera<lb/>tions upon me, but will always
