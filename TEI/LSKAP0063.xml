            <p>The imprudence of men who <add>would</add> reform the practice<lb/> of reading the
                Law to 3 years is astonishing<lb/> They would do away with inspired writings to<lb/>
                give them more time to tire their hearers with<lb/> their comparatively inspired
                twaddle. Yes<lb/> this is what they want to do, as if any preaching<lb/> can do the
                good that the reading of the Bible<lb/> will. Just ponder on this proposition
                &amp;<lb/> see its enormity.</p>
