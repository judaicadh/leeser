			<p rend="indent(1)">In all probability my Dear Friend you have by this time<lb/> heard of my arrival&#44; as I requested <persName>Mr. Raphael Moses</persName> to write as soon as I<lb/> had landed&#44; which he promised to do&#8212;I was extremely indisposed during the<lb/> whole passage &#38; found myself incapable of partaking of the slightest<lb/> sustenance&#44; I received the kindest &#38; most polite attention from my fellow<lb/> passengers&#44; which is you know&#44; the only ameliorating Circumstance we derive<lb/> from pain.  I did not see the Captain more than twice&#44; he was not very attentive<lb/> to me&#44; but I suppose he <add>had</add> a great deal to attend to I was not out of my Birth for five<lb/> Days so you may Judge how weak I must have been when I arrived.  My Cousin<lb/> <persName>Isaac Mordecai</persName>&#44; met me at the landing &#38; I was received with the most<lb/> gratifying affection by my Mothers Relatives who do all in their power to<lb/> Render me comfortable.  I have a very severe cough&#44; also an oppression on my<lb/> Breast&#44; almost as severe&#44; as ever poor Mortal was afflicted with&#44; I have had the<lb/> cough about five days&#44; I cannot say&#44; that as yet&#44; I feel much better than when I left<lb/> <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>&#44; but decidedly better than when I landed.  <persName>Martha</persName> will be surprised<lb/> to see me look in bad Health&#44; as she knows nothing of my late indisposition&#44; <add>but</add> I wrote<lb/> that she was glad to hear that I was enjoying good health&#44; the one that wrote the<lb/> letter for her must have made a mistake for she wrote to <persName>Aunt Judith</persName> what I had<lb/> written her from <placeName>Baltimore</placeName> and to beg her to let her know if she had heard how I was&#44; that<lb/> she had not heard from me for some time.  I have received many Visits since<lb/> my arrival&#44; a great proportion of the Respectable part of the Congre<lb/>gation&#44; have already called&#44; many of my Mother&#39;s oldest &#38; most<lb/> valued Friends are Residents here&#44; who seem disposed to pay me more<lb/> attention&#44; but I have no inclination <add>whatever</add> to visit at present&#44; and I am fearful<lb/> <add>I</add> <add>sha</add>ll never <add>feel</add> more <add>disposed for it</add> than I now do.  I stay at Cousin <persName>Moses&#39;s</persName> who continues</p>

				<p>to be as much a favorite with me as he ever was with his wife also I am<lb/> much pleased&#44; as they endeavour to contribute all they can to Render me<lb/> comfortable &#38; happy&#8212; <persName>Mrs. Moses</persName> I find woman of delightful<lb/> manners &#38; fine conversation and if I may be allowed to Judge on so short<lb/> an acquaintance&#44; I should take her to be <sic>possesed</sic> of <add>the</add> noblest and best feelings<lb/> I am assured she will do all in her power to Render my time agreeable&#95;I<lb/> passed last <date>Friday</date> evening &#38; <hi rend="underline"><date>Sabbath</date></hi> <add>with her</add>.  She is a very strict Jewess&#44; I am<lb/> sorry to say that she is the only one of my Friends here&#44; that I can eat with<lb/> as none of them are particular they all eat <hi rend="underline">trafer<add>&#63;</add> Meat&#44; butter</hi> and <hi rend="underline">Meat</hi> to<lb/>gether they think <hi rend="underline">very fine&#44; much</hi> good may it do them.  I have never yet in<lb/> my life eaten any thing of the kind and I am determined I never <hi rend="underline">will</hi> let me<lb/> feel the deprivation ever so much.  <persName>Mr R Moses</persName> leaves here on <date>Thursday</date> for<lb/> <placeName>New York</placeName>&#44; he will soon be in your City he says&#44; he can then tell you how much<lb/> attention I have received from the Congregation I would mention the names if I knew<lb/> them <hi rend="underline">all</hi>&#44; but as I do not&#44; and I still have a pain in my head&#44; so the sooner I am done<lb/> writing the better indeed I did not see more than half that called as I was in bed<lb/> the day they commenced calling.  I cannot close without assuring you<lb/> that I shall ever Retain the unfailing remembrance of the kindnesses<lb/> you have exerted towards me &#38; hope the time may arrive that will<lb/> give me an opportunity of Returning it. which pray God may be soon<lb/> I shall calculate on receiving a friendly letter from you soon&#44; please mention how my<lb/> Relatives are in <placeName>Baltimore</placeName> to whom you must present my most affectionate Remembrance<lb/> whenever you write&#44; also when you write to <placeName>New York</placeName> Remember me to <persName>Aunt<lb/> Rebecca</persName> and Family that I shall write <add>to them</add> as soon as my health will permit me<lb/> to do so <add>Remember</add> me to all who may <sic>enquire</sic> after me in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> whom at the same<lb/> time you may assure that nothing but ill health prevented me from calling<lb/> to see&#44; before I left the City.  Present me affectionately to <persName>Mr Peixatto</persName><lb/> &#38; family&#8212;tell <persName>Misses R &#38; S</persName> that I was unfortunately too sick during<lb/> the passage to open the Box&#44; so Bountifully Provided by their kindness<lb/>  Please remember me also to <persName>Mr Cohen</persName> <persName>Mrs Cousins</persName> <persName>Mr Spires</persName><lb/> <hi rend="underline">mama is expected here</hi></p>
