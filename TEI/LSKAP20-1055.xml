				<p>As regards<lb/> The inhuman direct or indirect coercion employed to induce men to change<lb/> their religion <sic>practised</sic> by the followers of other religions Judaism maintains<lb/> an eminence and incomparable position&#59; since <add>neither</add> during the whole <del>period</del> time of its flouri<lb/>shing state&#44; nor in that of its decay can there be shown to have existed a single<lb/> period when proselyte making was the business of its professors.  I must take<lb/> the liberty to refer to my own work&#42;&#58; &#34;In Judaism is it an accepted doctrine that<lb/> man can be virtuous in every religion which is based on humanity&#44; and can<lb/> for this reason obtain salvation.  One or the other religion is indeed more calcu&#45;<lb/>lated to promote virtue&#59; but not one is void of all means to lead to this<lb/> result.  If <add>even</add> therefore Judaism regards itself as an institution whereby<lb/> the true divine principle in man is best promoted in the children of <persName>Adam</persName>&#44;<lb/> this is only to be regarded in the light that Judaism exists standing as a signal&#42; for all<lb/> nations&#44; that the spirit which emanates from the same may operate abroad<lb/> to purify the morals and customs of mankind&#59; but no Jew could thereby<lb/> be justified to search in the conscience of others to represent to them as<lb/> contemptible that in which they had been born and educated&#44; which their soul had<lb/> imbibed in a long series of years&#44; which filled their spirit&#44; which<lb/> they had regarded hitherto as the most sacred and honoured&#44; and to wean<lb/> them from their intended faith by convert them to Judaism&#63;  The principle<lb/> of Judaism or the contrary is&#58; Let all the nations walk each in the name of<lb/> <del>his</del> its god&#58; the ordinances of its religion&#8212;&#59; but let us walk in the way of our living<lb/> God and everlasting king&#450;.  The whole care of Judaism ought to be directed to<lb/> the maintenance and <add>&#63;</add> of its own inward strength to revive the religious climes</p>

				<p>within&#59; but to impose our <del>faith</del> conviction on others&#44; and to search for recruits<lb/> for our faith is regarded by our religion no less unworthy as <del>than</del> prejudicial<lb/> to the native freedom of man&#44; than unjust and improper in itself.  Wherefore<lb/> no one can bring with justice a change against Judaism that&#44; notwith&#45;<lb/>standing the length of the period of its existence as a religious power&#44; and<lb/> the many political occurrences during the same&#44; it was never given<lb/> to the making of proselytes.&#34;</p>
