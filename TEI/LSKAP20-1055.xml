            <p>As regards<lb/> The inhuman direct or indirect coercion employed to induce men to
                change<lb/> their religion <sic>practised</sic> by the followers of other religions
                Judaism maintains<lb/> an eminence and incomparable position; since
                    <add>neither</add> during the whole <del>period</del> time of its
                flouri<lb/>shing state, nor in that of its decay can there be shown to have existed
                a single<lb/> period when proselyte making was the business of its professors. I
                must take<lb/> the liberty to refer to my own work*: "In Judaism is it an accepted
                doctrine that<lb/> man can be virtuous in every religion which is based on humanity,
                and can<lb/> for this reason obtain salvation. One or the other religion is indeed
                more calcu-<lb/>lated to promote virtue; but not one is void of all means to lead to
                this<lb/> result. If <add>even</add> therefore Judaism regards itself as an
                institution whereby<lb/> the true divine principle in man is best promoted in the
                children of <persName>Adam</persName>,<lb/> this is only to be regarded in the light
                that Judaism exists standing as a signal* for all<lb/> nations, that the spirit
                which emanates from the same may operate abroad<lb/> to purify the morals and
                customs of mankind; but no Jew could thereby<lb/> be justified to search in the
                conscience of others to represent to them as<lb/> contemptible that in which they
                had been born and educated, which their soul had<lb/> imbibed in a long series of
                years, which filled their spirit, which<lb/> they had regarded hitherto as the most
                sacred and honoured, and to wean<lb/> them from their intended faith by convert them
                to Judaism? The principle<lb/> of Judaism or the contrary is: Let all the nations
                walk each in the name of<lb/>
                <del>his</del> its god: the ordinances of its religion—; but let us walk in the way
                of our living<lb/> God and everlasting kingǂ. The whole care of Judaism ought to be
                directed to<lb/> the maintenance and <add>?</add> of its own inward strength to
                revive the religious climes</p>

                recruits<lb/> for our faith is regarded by our religion no less unworthy as
                    <del>than</del> prejudicial<lb/> to the native freedom of man, than unjust and
                improper in itself. Wherefore<lb/> no one can bring with justice a change against
