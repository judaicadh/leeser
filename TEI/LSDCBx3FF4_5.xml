                <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>
                <date>July 21st Ab 3rd 5601</date>
            </p>
            <p>Dear Uncle.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The week after I left <placeName>Baltimore</placeName> I wrote a few
                times to<lb/>
                <persName>David Judah</persName> upon some little affairs he had entrusted to me,
                I<lb/> desired to be remembered. Since then I have been kept pretty<lb/> much
                engaged in various ways; first, old <persName>Mrs. Levy</persName> died,
                    (<persName>Aaron's</persName> wife)<lb/> and had to attend prayers morning and
                evening at more than<lb/> a mile distance from my place; and next we had lately a
                meeting<lb/> to propose a plan for a general union of all the Jews in
                    <placeName>America</placeName><lb/> under one general church government at the
                head of which are<lb/> to be placed three learned men. I was put upon the
                committee<lb/> to mature<add>?</add> the plan, and <del>accordingly</del> was
                delegated by them<lb/> afterward to draw up rules &amp; regulations. I had to go to
                work<lb/> accordingly and did what had been asked of me; and the committee had<lb/>
                thereupon several meetings to debate after and amend my rough<lb/> draft. In the
                main it was adopted, and it was updated last<lb/>
                <date>Sunday</date> to a general meeting, and adopted and ordained to be
                printed<lb/> for general circulation, and as soon as it is ready I will send<lb/> it
                on, and I hope that you will at least approve of the outline<lb/> if even all the
                details do not meet your views. At the first<lb/> meeting (the <date>Sunday</date>
                after I left you) I made an extemporaneous address<lb/> of near an hour long to
                introduce the measure to public notice;<lb/> altho' not prepared with even a single
                note, people were pleased to<lb/> say that it was the best address they had heard
                from me; but this is so<lb/> often said about my works that I do not give much for
                such a compliment<lb/> any farther than that it proves that the people are not tired
                of hearing me</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p rend="indent(1)">In addition to the above labour which might have been enough in<lb/>
                a general way, I have been constantly occupied in writing letters and<lb/> editing a
                work for a gentleman by name of <persName>Dr. Louis Solomon</persName> a<lb/>
                <add>Hebrew</add> from <placeName>Metz</placeName>, who is not acquainted with the
                English. So<lb/> you see I have not been very idle. But in truth, people are
                afraid<lb/> of my wasting away, so they keep me busy all they can.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Do let me hear soon how you are at home. Tell
                    <persName>Rachel</persName><lb/> I sent her mother the book she gave me
                yesterday two weeks by<lb/>
                <persName>Messrs Hanford &amp; Sale</persName><add>?</add>. No doubt she has heard
                this before today.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I hope this day week to send you the report all printed,<lb/> and
                therefore I do not want to fatigue you now with more<lb/> details.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Please to give my love to Aunt <persName>R.</persName>
