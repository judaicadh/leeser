			<p>I regret to add Dr&#39;s Statement is false in many<lb/> respects&#44; as probably
				his information was<lb/> derived from <persName>Mr Goldsmith</persName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In the first place the Doctor is not<lb/> legally our Rabbi&#44; he
				never was so elected.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In the second&#44; <persName>Dr E</persName> never questioned<lb/>
				messenger but merely listened to calumny</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In the third&#44; he had no recourse<lb/> to any expedient. The
				Trustees did so<lb/>
				<sic>authorise</sic> him to appear before the three<lb/> members without
					<persName>Mr Messinger</persName> being<lb/> aware of their action.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In the fourth. The congregation have<lb/> adopted to eat meat of no
				other shochet<lb/> than <persName>Messinger</persName> &#38; we boast as
				religious<lb/> men as any in the world&#44; perhaps not<lb/> more so.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">There will be a sequel to this of<lb/> which I shall keep you
				advised.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Upon these remarks you may be<lb/> certain <persName>Dr
					E.</persName> cannot be reelected at<lb/> the end of the year &#38; if you know
				of any<lb/> competent ministers who of their own accord<lb/> or at your suggestion
				will visit <placeName>San<lb/> Francisco</placeName> &#38; when here will act
				prudently<lb/> they would do well to come out</p>
			<p rend="indent(9)">yrs. Truly. <persName role="author">H I Labatt</persName></p>
			<pb n="2"/>
			<p>they intend to request the Doctor to<lb/> resign. He who was so unpopular<lb/> &#38;
				was elected by such a struggle &#38;<lb/> such sacrifices has in 6 short weeks<lb/>
				make himself outrageously inimical<lb/> to the whole congregation. I hear but<lb/>
				two opinions. One asking him to resign<lb/> the other dismissing him from his
				post.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In a new country it was in<lb/> the Doctors province to endear
				himself<lb/> to a warm &#38; ardent congregation but<lb/> he has chosen the
				opposite. Yesterday<lb/> in conversation the Doctor was advised<lb/> by my father
				&#38; myself to be careful<lb/> of his actions that the congregation were very<lb/>
				uneasy about the Schochet matter &#38; his<lb/> position &#38; <hi rend="underline"
					>might</hi> censure him. He said<lb/> on that subject he courted their
				censure<lb/> &#38; forthwith proclaimed to the world through<lb/> the papers that we
				were all fools &#38; knew<lb/> not what we did that our Shochet<lb/> was no shochet
				&#38; his Shechilah to be<lb/> Terephah. &#40;see publication&#41;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I enclose you the publication with<lb/> the notes thereupon that
				seem proper.<lb/> I regret this matter on the Doctor&#39;s account</p>

			<p rend="indent(1)">BRETHREN IN FAITH&#33;&#8212;In reply to certain queries<lb/> laid
				before me by the Prest. of K. K. Sh. Js.&#44; in a letter<lb/> dated <date>Nov.
					29</date>&#44; A. C.&#44; I feel conscientiously bound to<lb/> state at
				large&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. That our laws in relation to animal
				food&#44; have the<lb/> sanction of a number of passages of the Holy Writ&#58;
				See<lb/> Gen. 9&#58; 4&#59; Levit. 11&#59; 3&#58; 17&#59; 7&#58; 23&#45;27&#59;
				17&#58; 10&#45;14&#59;<lb/> Deut. 14&#58; 4&#45;20&#44; etc.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">2d. They were strictly adhered to by our Prophets&#58;<lb/> See
					<persName>Ezek.</persName> 4&#58; 14&#59; <persName>Dan.</persName> 1&#58;
				8&#59; and by our nation through<lb/> a series of ages and generations.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">These laws are preservative of physical and mental<lb/> health. By
				abstaining from the use of gross blood&#44; &#40;the<lb/>
				<hi rend="italics">cruor</hi>&#41; from certain portions of &#40;almost&#41;
				indigestible fat&#44; from animals that feed on carrion&#44; that die of
				themselves&#44;<lb/> that labor under consumptive&#44; hepatic&#44;
					<sic>hydrocephalous</sic><lb/> diseases&#44; or of those of the kidneys&#44; the
				heart&#44; or the<lb/> other internal organs&#8212;not to mention the loathsome<lb/>
				disease of the swine&#8212;by abstaining from these&#44; we reject<lb/> food that is
				a prolific source of disease&#44; that blunts the<lb/> moral feelings&#44; that
				inflames the passions&#44; irritates the<lb/> blood&#44; and rouses the animal
				propensities&#8212;that animal&#45;<lb/>izes man.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">This fact is acknowledged by the testimony of ages<lb/> past&#44;
				and by the light of advanced science of the present<lb/> age&#44; as also by
				Christian commentators&#58; See <persName>Clarke</persName> and<lb/> other
				commentators on Lev. 11 et Deut. 14.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">We therefore need not wonder that men of science and<lb/>
				intelligence&#44; as also proprietors of public establishments<lb/> of note even of
				other denominations&#44; in places where we<lb/> and our principles are known&#44;
				never use common animal<lb/> food whenever such as prepared for our use is
				within<lb/> reach.&#42;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">And in all <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; from times
				immemorial&#44; only men of<lb/> gravity&#44; of unquestionable piety&#44; and
				approved solidity<lb/> of character and principle&#44; were entrusted with the<lb/>
				office of <hi rend="italics">Shochat</hi>&#44; i. e. of killing and inspecting the
				ani&#45;<lb/>mals intended for the use of Israelites&#44; who&#44; on finding<lb/>
				the animal free from disease and sound&#44; generally puts<lb/> a seal used solely
				for that purpose on different portions<lb/> of it&#44; as marks of its
					<sic>properiety</sic> for our use.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The Schochat acts under the inspection of the Rabbi.<lb/> The former
				after a proper study of Animal Anatomy and<lb/> Pathology&#44; as laid down in our
				laws&#44; has to submit to an<lb/> examination to a properly authorized Rabbi&#44;
				&#40;usually<lb/> that of the respective city where the Schochat wishes to<lb/>
				practice&#44;&#41; who&#44; on finding the candidate religiously and<lb/> legally
				trustworthy&#44; provides him with a <hi rend="italics">Rabbalah</hi>&#44;
				&#40;au&#45;<lb/>thorization to be a Shochat&#44;&#41; and even then the
				Shochat<lb/> has to refer to the Rabbi certain difficult cases&#44; and to<lb/>
				submit to re&#45;examination at certain periods.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Only a diplomated Rabbi is authorized by our law to<lb/> institute a
				Schochat&#59; no Schochat nor a number of Scho&#45;<lb/>chalim dare presume to do
				so&#44; such an act is by the law<lb/>
				<sic>delared</sic> null&#59; and the person thus created Shochat is
					<sic>de&#45;<lb/>clare</sic> by said laws an interloper&#44; and unworthy of
				trust.<lb/> &#40;Code Yorah Deah &#167;1 let. 18&#44; et. ib. Tor Zahab lit
				4.&#41;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">There are cases in which even legally instituted<lb/> Shochlim
				forfeit their Rabbalah. Among others we may<lb/> mention the following&#44; as
				pertinent to the subject.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">1. If a Shochat is found to have himself shown a dis&#45;<lb/>regard
				towards the dietetic laws by partaking of for&#45;<lb/>bidden food. &#40;Code Y.
				D.&#44; &#167; &#167;1&#44; 2&#44; 119 etc.&#41;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">2. If he violates the <date>Sabbath</date> or other national<lb/>
				laws. &#40;Ib.&#41;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">3. By physical causes&#44; as obtuseness of the senses<lb/> dim&#44;
				or short sightedness.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">4. Besides&#44; no Shochat is to be trusted if he is inter<lb/>ested
				in the result of his decision. &#40;Ib. &#167;2 Tor Zahat<lb/> ad. lit. 18.&#41;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Whereas&#44; I learn that an individual <sic>practises</sic> here
				as<lb/> Shochat&#8212;and&#44; whereas&#44; a sacred duty imposes upon me<lb/> the
				hard task&#8212;and the letter of the President of K. K.<lb/> Sh. Is. requires me to
				declare whether said individual is<lb/> a legal Shochat&#44; I feel obliged to
				state&#44; that of five candi&#45;<lb/>dates who since my stay here&#44;
					&#40;<date>July 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi></date>&#44; A. C.&#44;&#41;
				presented<lb/> themselves to me for authorization or examination&#44; only<lb/> two
				were found worthy of trust&#44; viz&#58;&#8212;<persName>Mr. Isaac
					Gold&#45;<lb/>smith</persName>&#44; the Shochat of this city&#44; and
					<persName>Mr. Borier</persName> of <placeName>Sacra&#45;<lb/>mento</placeName>
				city&#44; and they were examined accordingly&#59; the<lb/> other three were rejected
				for obvious reasons. Among<lb/> the latter is the young man in question.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">He was <sic>recommeaded</sic> to me for examination&#44; and
				was<lb/> rejected on the ground of his falling under cases 1&#44; 2&#44; 3&#44;
				4&#44;<lb/> state above as disqualifications for said office. He is<lb/> known to
				have forfeited his <add>&#63;</add><lb/> even since his few months&#39; stay in this
				State.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Thus rejected by our Law&#44; he had recourse to the
				fol&#45;<lb/>lowing expedient. He applied for authorization for three<lb/> persons
				who formerly are said to have acted as Shochin.<lb/> But as two of them publicly
				work in stores on the <date>Sab&#45;<lb/>bath</date> and Holydays&#44; and the third
				is known&#8212;&#8212;.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I deeply and sincerely lament to be in duty bound to<lb/> declare
				said expedient illegal&#59; and&#8212;in the name of our<lb/> ancient and venerable
				Laws in Codes Yorch Deah &#167; &#167;<lb/> 1&#44; 2&#44; 119&#44; 254&#59; Moshen
