			<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>Charleston S. C.</placeName> <date>June 14. 1853</date>.</p>
			<p rend="align(center)"><addressee>Rev. Mr I. Leeser</addressee>&#44; <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">My dear Sir&#33; Agreeably to my promise&#44;<lb/> I herewith forward you&#44; the translation of a part of <persName>Dr M&#39;s</persName><lb/> work&#44; such as it has gone forth from my first scrawl&#44;&#8212;<lb/> want of time&#44; soreness of a finger of my right hand&#44; and the<lb/> fear that a longer delay might cause it exclusion from the<lb/> <date>July</date> No. of the O.&#44; having prevented me to give the translation<lb/> a proper finish. I would request you&#44; therefore&#44; to lay your<lb/> correcting hand upon it&#44; in a manner&#44; as to make it worthy of<lb/> publication. Should you&#44; however&#44; not be wiling&#44; to publish<lb/> the work at all&#44; you would confer a great favor upon me&#44;<lb/> by sending my H. I. back&#44; as I have no other copy of my<lb/> translation. The part sent here&#44; is about a third of<lb/> the whole work.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">I embrace this opportunity&#44; to make some<lb/> remarks on your letter of&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#40;without date&#41;&#44; which was handed<lb/> to me by <persName>J. N. Hart sen. Esq.</persName></p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">Well do I know&#44; that it was not Religion&#44;<lb/> which banished you form your ministerial office &#44;as little as<lb/> any Jewish Minister in <placeName>America</placeName>&#44; has as yet been persecuted<lb/> from real religious motives of his persecutors. Private hatred&#44;<lb/> jealousy&#44; envy&#44;and often mere will&#44; called forth by wounded<lb/> pride&#44; offended selfishness&#44; in the boldness with which the<lb/> Minster &#8220;<hi rend="underline">dared</hi>&#8221; to attack abuses&#44; absurdities&#44; sins &#38;c&#44; of<lb/> which some or another of his flock happened to have been guilty&#44;<lb/> and&#44; consequently&#44; the fact&#44; that felt the touch&#44; were and still are</p>
		<pb n="2"/>
			<p>the motives of <hi rend="underline">all</hi> those persecutions. The Jews still look up<lb/> on their Minister as their most obedient servant&#44; and&#44; as soon<lb/> as he has conjured up&#44; by his <sic>independen</sic> stand&#44; the displeasure<lb/> of but <hi rend="underline">One</hi> of the mighty&#44; a party is soon formed&#44; and he<lb/> falls as their victim.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">Before I was in the Ministry&#44; I knew already&#44; from<lb/> my own observations&#44; that there was but little true Religion to be<lb/> found amongst our coreligionists&#44; but that the want of religious<lb/> principles was carried to so great an extent&#44; as to make<lb/> our holy Religion a mere burlesque&#44; I learned already by my<lb/> own ministerial experiences of but one years&#39; duration. People<lb/> model Religion&#44; its forms and ceremonies&#44; according to their own<lb/> task&#44; fancy <del>and</del>&#44; <hi rend="underline">convenience</hi> and <hi rend="underline">worldly interest</hi>&#44; <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> may be well said also of our days. <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> Or is it not a farce&#44; to see people thunder and work against<lb/> the abolishment of but a few offerings&#44; who <hi rend="underline">publicly</hi> violate their<lb/> <date>Sabbath</date>&#63; To <hi rend="underline">see</hi> people smoke their <sic>sigars</sic> on <date>Sabbath</date>&#44; who<lb/> would <hi rend="underline">curse</hi> the Reformers&#63;&#33; &#40;My own ears have heard it&#41;&#59; To<lb/> <hi rend="underline">hear</hi> people boast of their strictly conforming with the traditional<lb/> laws&#44; to demand the <sic>fulfilment</sic> of all rabbinical morning<lb/> precepts&#44; and&#44; with the same breath&#44; require the sexton to<lb/> cut <add>Hebrew</add> only on one undergarment&#63; Nay&#33; Is it not<lb/> a humbug to hear a minister preach on the <hi rend="underline">Divinity</hi> of the<lb/> oral law&#44; who <hi rend="underline">shaves</hi>&#44; tho&#39; that law tells him&#44; that shaving<lb/> is a 5 fold prohibition&#33;&#63; to hear another publicly proclaim&#44;<lb/> that an intermarriage with Reformers was worse than that with<lb/> Christians&#44; who would not set his foot upon the Synagogue of<lb/> Reformers&#44;&#8212;and&#8212;a few months afterwards&#44; his daughter is<lb/> married to a Reformer of the worst kind&#44; whom true Reformers</p>
		<pb n="3"/>
			<p>would even disclaim as one of theirs&#44; and whose family is even<lb/> intermarried with Christians&#44;&#8212;to hear ministers call themselves<lb/> adherents to the old orthodox school&#44; who would ride on <add>Hebrew</add>&#63;&#33;<lb/> Oh&#33; it is heart&#45;rending&#44; to hear &#38; see all these things&#44; and to<lb/> know&#44; that all our labors are in vain&#33; For&#44; I must confess&#44; that<lb/> this is my innermost belief&#44; and that do not see any result<lb/> to be produced by your proposed Union&#45;Meeting. But do<lb/> not conclude from this remark&#44; that I would refuse my co&#45;<lb/>operations&#44; I also understand the call <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>. But I have my doubts&#44; suspicions and fears. I do<lb/> not see any possibility for a reconciliation of the different parties<lb/> <hi rend="underline">in</hi> the meeting. Where is the rallying point&#44; in which for instance<lb/> <persName>Drs Wise</persName> and <persName>Raphall</persName> could meet&#63; Or could you expect from<lb/> me to give up the organ&#44; or to reinstate the second day of our<lb/> festivals&#44; if it should happen&#44; that a majority was against<lb/> my &#38; my congregations principles&#63;&#95; Or would <persName>Rev. Isaacs</persName><lb/> or yourself submit&#44; if it happened that the Reformers had the<lb/> <sic>ascendency</sic>&#63;&#33; Moreover&#44; I cannot think&#44; that all our colleagues&#44;<lb/> would be independent enough&#44; precarious as their offices are&#44;<lb/> to utter their full and true opinions&#44;&#8212;the same policy&#44; that<lb/> actuates them on their pulpits&#44; will guide them also at the Meeting.<lb/> But suppose even&#44; we all could agree on some points&#44; what power<lb/> have we&#44; to execute our resolutions&#63; Are not our congregations<lb/> sovereign&#44; and do you think&#44; that even a unanimity as the Meeting<lb/> would at once dispel all party spirit from them&#63; Will they<lb/> because we have spoken on the sanctity of the <date>sabbath</date> &#38;c &#38;c&#44; call<lb/> their sons back from the Colleges&#44; where they can not keep it&#44;&#8212;<lb/> will they call their sons back from <placeName>California</placeName>&#44; and all other<lb/> places&#44; where there are no Jews&#44; and where they therefore cannot</p>
		<pb n="4"/>
			<p>conform with even the Biblical laws&#44; to say nothing of the Rabbinical<lb/> <add>&#63;</add>&#8212;will all&#44; at once&#44; shut their stores on <date>Sabbath</date>&#44; and give<lb/> up their offices&#44; which <sic>compell</sic> them to violate it&#63;&#33; These and other<lb/> considerations which I could multiply at infinitum&#44; fill me with serious<lb/> doubts as to any salutory result&#44; to be derived from a meeting.<lb/> Since&#44; as I never fear&#44; to meet my antagonists&#44; I would have the<lb/> announcement of the Meeting&#44; hoping for <hi rend="underline">one</hi> good <add>&#63;</add>&#59;&#8212;that we<lb/> ministers&#44; of all colors&#44; may learn to know and to respect each other<lb/> seeing that all of us&#44; are actuated by honest motives&#44; in our re&#45;<lb/>spective teachings&#44;&#8212;a result which&#44; I trust&#44; would beneficially<lb/> also reflect upon our flocks.&#8212;</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">But let me here suggest a practical point&#44; with regard to<lb/> the Meeting. Should not the Ministers&#44; now residing in <placeName>NYork</placeName>&#44; say<lb/> <persName>Drs Lilienthal</persName>&#44; <persName>Merzbacher</persName>&#44; <persName>Raphael</persName> &#38; <persName>Mr Isaacs</persName>&#44;&#8212;being the represent&#45;<lb/>atives of all parties&#44; at the same time&#44;&#8212;at once unite for&#44; and<lb/> im<add>m</add>ediately issue a proclamation&#63;&#33; Perhaps their call would be<lb/> responded to from all parts of the <placeName>U. S.</placeName> What do think of this<lb/> <del>prop</del> suggestion. I have other practical suggestions in store&#44;<lb/> e.g. With regard to expenses &#38;c.&#44; but do now withhold them&#44; until<lb/> I have heard other colleagues&#44; who are older&#44; than I am.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">With regard to your complaint&#44; about the paucity of your subscribers&#44;<lb/> and the illiberality of some Reformers&#44; I beg leave to remark&#58; It is indeed<lb/> not illiberality on their part&#44; when they do not read your periodical&#44; but<lb/> their principle tells them so. Why should they <add>&#63;</add> the rod&#44; with which they are<lb/> lashed&#63;  They are men of principles&#8212;for as soon&#44; as the Asmonean un&#45;<lb/>furled the banner of Reform&#44; a great many Reformers became its subscribers&#59;<lb/> it has at least 25 in my congr. alone&#44;&#8212;and I can promise you a<lb/> greater number yet&#44; if you do&#44; what the <add>&#63;</add> did.  <persName>Mr Poznanski</persName> alone will<lb/> subscribe for 3 copies.  Are the Reformers not more grateful to their ad&#45;<lb/>vocate than the Orthodox.  I have often heard&#44; that there were more Orthodox<lb/> than Reformers&#44; and yet&#44; the Orthodox allow their most talented champions<lb/> <hi rend="underline">&#8220;to starve</hi>&#63;&#8221;  If the Orthodox do not <sic>patronise</sic> <hi rend="underline">their</hi> paper&#44; should the Re&#45;<lb/>formers do it&#44; in their stead&#33;&#63;  And besides&#44; have not many orthodox also<lb/> discontinued the A&#44; as soon as <persName>Dr W.</persName> became co&#45;editor.  &#40;I. Asm. Of <date>22 Oct. 52</date>&#41;.<lb/>  How many subscribers have you in <persName>Rev. Jacobs</persName> <hi rend="underline">orthodox</hi> congr. that numbers about<lb/> 80&#45;90 members&#44; mine numbers 40&#45;50 and 25 are subscribers of the A.<lb/>  Please calculate the ratio&#8212;and the balance the liberality of both parties.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">Truly yours&#160;&#160;<persName role="author">Dr M Meyer</persName></p>
