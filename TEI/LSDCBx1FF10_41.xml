                                        an intermarriage with Reformers was worse than that
                                        with<lb/> Christians, who would not set his foot upon the

                                        would ride on <add>Hebrew</add>?!<lb/> Oh! it is
                                        heart-rending, to hear &amp; see all these things, and
                                        to<lb/> know, that all our labors are in vain! For, I must
                                        confess, that<lb/> this is my innermost belief, and that do
                                        not see any result<lb/> to be produced by your proposed
                                        Union-Meeting. But do<lb/> not conclude from this remark,
                                        that I would refuse my co-<lb/>operations, I also understand
                                        the call <add>Hebrew</add><lb/>
                                        <add>Hebrew</add>. But I have my doubts, suspicions and

                                        happened that the Reformers had the<lb/>
                                        <sic>ascendency</sic>?! Moreover, I cannot think, that all

                                        as their offices are,<lb/> to utter their full and true

                                        suppose even, we all could agree on some points, what
                                        power<lb/> have we, to execute our resolutions? Are not our
                                        congregations<lb/> sovereign, and do you think, that even a
                                        unanimity as the Meeting<lb/> would at once dispel all party
                                        spirit from them? Will they<lb/> because we have spoken on

                                        regard to<lb/> the Meeting. Should not the Ministers, now

                                        Perhaps their call would be<lb/> responded to from all parts

                              <p rend="indent(1)">With regard to your complaint, about the paucity
                                        of your subscribers,<lb/> and the illiberality of some
                                        Reformers, I beg leave to remark: It is indeed<lb/> not
                                        illiberality on their part, when they do not read your
                                        periodical, but<lb/> their principle tells them so. Why

                                        yet, if you do, what the <add>?</add> did. <persName>Mr

                                        3 copies. Are the Reformers not more grateful to their

                                        there were more Orthodox<lb/> than Reformers, and yet, the
