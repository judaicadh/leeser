            <p>If the fabric of historical Judaism is to be saved<lb/> from utter demolition, for,
                on the score of Scriptural<lb/> Judaism, I have no fear, fair compromises must
                be<lb/> made. I have long held out against changes by<lb/> individual congregations,
                but our orthodox leaders<lb/> give no sign of life, utter no sound, to cheer
                their<lb/> supporters and followers. The pressure from without<lb/> increases daily
                in intensity, and the faithful <add>אבל</add><lb/> must either yield to the demands
                made, or give<lb/> room to others who will effect a complete <hi rend="underline"
                    >bouleverse</hi><lb/><hi rend="underline">ment</hi> of the existing state of
                things.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I have been interrupted for some hours by the<lb/> sad tidings of
                the loss of the Evening Star. Some of the<lb/> passengers said to be lost have

            <p>particularly of the second day <add>מקיל ולא מחמיר</add> which I had been<lb/> taught
                to believe had been kept in <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> from the days<lb/> of
                    <persName>Ezra</persName> has no such historical basis, but dates from a<lb/>
                very recent period; and, to my astonishment, I learned for<lb/> the first time that
                on that day, the common daily prayers<lb/> are said in
                    <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, and not those for the festival.<lb/> I had
                heard before that some of the <add>חכמה המשנה והתלמוד</add> from the <placeName>Holy
                    City</placeName><lb/> came to Synagogue in <placeName>London</placeName> on
                    <add>לא אלמן ישראל</add> with their Tephillin on.<lb/> Really, therefore if our
                orthodox guides do not bestir them<lb/>selves and clean up the obscurities which
                envelop our<lb/> minhagim, particularly their origin and history, much<lb/> will be
                swept away which should be retained. A book<lb/> has been in my library for years,
                called <add>מעשי דעלמא</add>, which<lb/> curiosity induced me lately to peruse, as
                it is frequently quoted<lb/> by <persName>Zumy<add>?</add></persName> in his Gottes
                dienstliche Vorträge, and not alone the<lb/> reasoning of the author, but the
                support it receives from<lb/>
                <del>dist</del> quotations of distinguished writers, truly orthodox,<lb/> have
                entirely shaken my faith in the Rabbinism of<lb/> the middle ages, little as I
                believed in it before. I had<lb/> often begun to read this volume, but it seemed to
                be exclusively<lb/> directed against the stassidim<add>?</add>, and so it did
                not<lb/> interest me, whereas now I am going thro' it carefully.</p>
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p rend="align(right)">5</p>
            <p>It seems that the converse of <add>טוב רע מאח</add> was the rule of<lb/> our guides
                in the middle ages, and that either they did not<lb/> understand the sayings and
                doings of their revered predecessors,<lb/> the <add>אם אמת הדבר</add> who view large
                souled and enlightened men,<lb/>
                <del>and</del> but introduced a sort of asceticism into Judaism, public &amp;<lb/>
                private, or they assumed an authority which modern research<lb/> questions, and
                refuses any longer to tolerate. Do not imagine<lb/> by my writing in this strain
                that I am going to turn ultra<lb/> Reformer. The second days are still kept here,
                and the Synagogue<lb/> attended by a few, just sufficient to make minyan. With
                the<lb/> exception of five Jewish stores, and the remainder are closed<lb/> by my
                people on <del>that day</del> the <date>Sabbath</date>, tho' among them are rabid
                Reformers<lb/> who keep aloof from the Synag: except on on <date>Rosh
                    Hashanah</date> and<lb/>
                <date>Kippoor</date>, until certain modifications in the Ritual and public<lb/>
                worship are sanctioned by me. I must yield, or extremes<lb/> will be resorted to,
                whose consequences would imperil the conserv-<lb/>ation of important and fundamental
                things. What conscientious<lb/> pangs might have been spared men struggling like
                myself to<lb/> preserve the unity of formula in our worship had we been<lb/> backed
                by an orthodox Synod of learned &amp; enlightened<lb/> Rabbis, prepared to direct
                claims for changes into a channel</p>
            <pb n="6"/>
            <p>or stream whose waters might have fructified Judaism.<lb/> I say it with pain, with
                agony, that the want of such a Synod<lb/> has sent<add>?</add> Judaism to tatters,
                that it has encouraged rationalism<lb/> in its destructive tendencies in the
                    <placeName>west</placeName>, and promoted the<lb/> growth of that abominable
                    stassidism<add>?</add> in the <placeName>east</placeName>. I have<lb/> some true
                and good men among my people, who have <sic>travelled</sic><lb/> and seen much of
                our various communities in <placeName>France</placeName>,<lb/>
                <placeName>Germany</placeName>, <placeName>Austria</placeName>, and other parts of
                    <placeName>Europe</placeName>. They are men<lb/> attached to the old system
                still, with all its admitted defects,<lb/> and they lament with me the insouciance
                with which the<lb/> orthodox Rabbis regard the spread of irreligion, particularly
                the violation<lb/> of the <date>Sabbath</date>, and indulgence in forbidden food,
                without a<lb/> united effort among them to check it by wise and well concocted<lb/>
                measures. <add>ר"ה</add>. There is, I sincerely believe, more taleah<lb/> and more
                real learning among the orthodox than among the Reformers, and yet<lb/> they allow
                this “laissez aller” <del>sent</del> state of things to go on. But<lb/> enough of
