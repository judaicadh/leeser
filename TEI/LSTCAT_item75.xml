				<p>My dear <addressee>Mr. Leeser</addressee>.</p>
				<p rend="indent(1)">At length I enjoy a day&#39;s ease from toil and of<lb/> comparative coolness&#44; leaving me sufficient time and<lb/> energy after the exhausting and incessant heat of over<lb/> five months duration to drop you a few lines&#59; not<lb/> in answer to your last&#44; for I have mislaid your letter&#44;<lb/> put in some safe place&#44; which has escaped my memory.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">If the situation at <placeName>Savannah</placeName> did not materially<lb/> interfere with your high position as the leader and<lb/> exponent of orthodoxy&#44; that is&#44; if the acceptance of it<lb/> did not&#44; in a measure shelve you&#44; by consigning you&#44;<lb/> to so comparatively insignificant a sphere&#44; I would<lb/> be the first to advise you to quit <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>&#44; and<lb/> honorably retire to a spot where your influence might<lb/> still be felt&#44; and when the duties would be to <hi rend="underline">you</hi><lb/> light and easy&#44; and above all a resting place to<lb/> breathe in and enjoy yourself after your laborious and<lb/> toilsome career.  Could you not manage to issue the<lb/> Occident there&#63;  That you should have a disinclination<lb/> to leave <placeName>Pa.</placeName> when your world&#45;wide reputation</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>has been established&#44; is natural&#59; but remember it<lb/> is not with your <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; but <add>Hebrew</add>.  You can without<lb/> desertions the holy cause still <sic>fulfil</sic> the command&#44; <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; and be as useful as ever&#44; tho the locality<lb/> be smaller.  You have <hi rend="underline">earned</hi> your <hi rend="underline"><sic>olium</sic></hi>&#44; and if you<lb/> can enjoy it <add>&#63;</add>&#44; why not avail yourself<lb/> of so seasonable an opportunity&#44; in the society of those<lb/> who would hail your coming with enthusiasm&#44; and in<lb/> a climate more genial to your partly worn out constitution&#44;<lb/> enfeebled by excessive work in the cause of your people.<lb/>  I think you ought&#44; and so will every true friend of yours.<lb/>  We don&#39;t want you to drop at your post from sheer fatigue&#59;<lb/> say then to us <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; and accept the post.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Orthodoxy&#44; from the stand&#45;point&#44; I view it&#44; cannot long<lb/> maintain its ground in <placeName>America</placeName>&#44; nor elsewhere concessions<lb/> <hi rend="underline">must</hi> be made&#59; not in the homeopathic doses you wish<lb/> to administer&#44; but in heroic quantities&#44; as the M Dr<lb/> say <add>Hebrew</add> and a <add>Hebrew</add> are not enough&#44; and as <persName>Mr Mo&#239;se</persName><lb/> justly observes if you concede <hi rend="underline">them</hi>&#44; the precedent is<lb/> at once established for granting more.

				<p>If the fabric of historical Judaism is to be saved<lb/> from utter demolition&#44; for&#44; on the score of Scriptural<lb/> Judaism&#44; I have no fear&#44; fair compromises must be<lb/> made.  I have long held out against changes by<lb/> individual congregations&#44; but our orthodox leaders<lb/> give no sign of life&#44; utter no sound&#44; to cheer their<lb/> supporters and followers.  The pressure from without<lb/> increases daily in intensity&#44; and the faithful <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> must either yield to the demands made&#44; or give<lb/> room to others who will effect a complete <hi rend="underline">bouleverse</hi><lb/><hi rend="underline">ment</hi> of the existing state of things.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I have been interrupted for some hours by the<lb/> sad tidings of the loss of the Evening Star.  Some of the<lb/> passengers said to be lost have relatives among my<lb/> congregation&#44; but I declined to give <add>Hebrew</add> until their<lb/> fate had been ascertained.  I have however very little<lb/> hope of their being alive.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Revenons &#224; nos moutons.  Have you read the articles<lb/> in the &#8220;Archives Israelites&#8221; written by <persName>Cohen</persName>&#44; Chief Rabbi<lb/> in <placeName>Algiers</placeName>&#44; during the last few months&#63;  Their fairness is<lb/> indisputable and their accuracy has not been impeached&#44;<lb/> and&#44; what is more&#44; cannot be.  His account of the <add>Hebrew</add></p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>4</p>
				<p>particularly of the second day <add>Hebrew</add> which I had been<lb/> taught to believe had been kept in <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> from the days<lb/> of <persName>Ezra</persName> has no such historical basis&#44; but dates from a<lb/> very recent period&#59; and&#44; to my astonishment&#44; I learned for<lb/> the first time that on that day&#44; the common daily prayers<lb/> are said in <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>&#44; and not those for the festival.<lb/>  I had heard before that some of the <add>Hebrew</add> from the <placeName>Holy City</placeName><lb/> came to Synagogue in <placeName>London</placeName> on <add>Hebrew</add> with their Tephillin on.<lb/>  Really&#44; therefore if our orthodox guides do not bestir them<lb/>selves and clean up the obscurities which envelop our<lb/> minhagim&#44; particularly their origin and history&#44; much<lb/> will be swept away which should be retained.  A book<lb/> has been in my library for years&#44; called <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; which<lb/> curiosity induced me lately to peruse&#44; as it is frequently quoted<lb/> by <persName>Zumy<add>&#63;</add></persName> in his Gottes dienstliche Vortr&#228;ge&#44; and not alone the<lb/> reasoning of the author&#44; but the support it receives from<lb/> <del>dist</del> quotations of distinguished writers&#44; truly orthodox&#44;<lb/> have entirely shaken my faith in the Rabbinism of<lb/> the middle ages&#44; little as I believed in it before.  I had<lb/> often begun to read this volume&#44; but it seemed to be exclusively<lb/> directed against the stassidim<add>&#63;</add>&#44; and so it did not<lb/> interest me&#44; whereas now I am going thro&#39; it carefully.</p>
			<pb n="5"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">5</p>
				<p>It seems that the converse of <add>Hebrew</add> was the rule of<lb/> our guides in the middle ages&#44; and that either they did not<lb/> understand the sayings and doings of their revered predecessors&#44;<lb/> the <add>Hebrew</add> who view large souled and enlightened men&#44;<lb/> <del>and</del> but introduced a sort of asceticism into Judaism&#44; public &#38;<lb/> private&#44; or they assumed an authority which modern research<lb/> questions&#44; and refuses any longer to tolerate.  Do not imagine<lb/> by my writing in this strain that I am going to turn ultra<lb/> Reformer.  The second days are still kept here&#44; and the Synagogue<lb/> attended by a few&#44; just sufficient to make minyan.  With the<lb/> exception of five Jewish stores&#44; and the remainder are closed<lb/> by my people on <del>that day</del> the <date>Sabbath</date>&#44; tho&#39; among them are rabid Reformers<lb/> who keep aloof from the Synag&#58; except on on <date>Rosh Hashanah</date> and<lb/> <date>Kippoor</date>&#44; until certain modifications in the Ritual and public<lb/> worship are sanctioned by me.  I must yield&#44; or extremes<lb/> will be resorted to&#44; whose consequences would imperil the conserv&#45;<lb/>ation of important and fundamental things.  What conscientious<lb/> pangs might have been spared men struggling like myself to<lb/> preserve the unity of formula in our worship had we been<lb/> backed by an orthodox Synod of learned &#38; enlightened<lb/> Rabbis&#44; prepared to direct claims for changes into a channel</p>
			<pb n="6"/>
				<p>or stream whose waters might have fructified Judaism.<lb/>  I say it with pain&#44; with agony&#44; that the want of such a Synod<lb/> has sent<add>&#63;</add> Judaism to tatters&#44; that it has encouraged rationalism<lb/> in its destructive tendencies in the <placeName>west</placeName>&#44; and promoted the<lb/> growth of that abominable stassidism<add>&#63;</add> in the <placeName>east</placeName>.  I have<lb/> some true and good men among my people&#44; who have <sic>travelled</sic><lb/> and seen much of our various communities in <placeName>France</placeName>&#44;<lb/> <placeName>Germany</placeName>&#44; <placeName>Austria</placeName>&#44; and other parts of <placeName>Europe</placeName>.  They are men<lb/> attached to the old system still&#44; with all its admitted defects&#44;<lb/> and they lament with me the insouciance with which the<lb/> orthodox Rabbis regard the spread of irreligion&#44; particularly the violation<lb/> of the <date>Sabbath</date>&#44; and indulgence in forbidden food&#44; without a<lb/> united effort among them to check it by wise and well concocted<lb/> measures.  <add>Hebrew</add>.  There is&#44; I sincerely believe&#44; more taleah<lb/> and more real learning among the orthodox than among the Reformers&#44; and yet<lb/> they allow this &#8220;laissez aller&#8221; <del>sent</del> state of things to go on.  But<lb/> enough of this for the present.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">And now for a little <add>Hebrew</add> relating to myself&#44; with<lb/> which I beg of you to occupy a trifle of your valuable time.<lb/>  A brother of mine recently informed me of his having met in <placeName>London</placeName><lb/> <persName>Mr. Lem Dyer</persName>&#44; brother of our lamented friend <persName>Mrs. Osterman</persName>&#44;</p>
			<pb n="7"/>
				<p>who <del>info</del> mentioned to him that that lady had bequeathed me<lb/> and my wife&#44; a legacy of &#36;3000 in her will.  It is easy for<lb/> you&#44; being in the spot&#44; to ascertain&#44; either by writing to <persName>Mrs.<lb/> Symonds</persName>&#44; formerly <persName>Hannah Dyer</persName>&#44; at <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName>&#44; or by<lb/> personal inquiry among her friends the <persName>Pollacks</persName>&#44; the<lb/> truth of my brother&#39;s statement.  I have <sic>foreborne</sic> so long<lb/> from addressing <persName>Mrs. S.</persName> not knowing her right address&#44;<lb/> that a direct inquiry from me now&#44; would be indelicate.<lb/>  I prefer you being my agent in this to my brother&#39;s being so&#44;<lb/> for various reasons.  It will be sufficient to quote the<lb/> words of <persName>Solomon</persName> <add>Hebrew</add>.  You will be doing me<lb/> and your old friend <persName>Mrs. N</persName> a favor by losing no time<lb/> in letting us know <add>Hebrew</add>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Our Holy days passed off delightfully&#44; full attendances<lb/> at Synagogue&#44; great devotion&#44; order&#44; and decorum&#44; and nothing<lb/> to ruffle the harmony from <add>Hebrew</add> on the eve<lb/> of that day I confirmed 5 young people 3 girls and 2 boys.<lb/>  Every child almost of 6 or 7 years of age&#44; boy or girl&#44; learns<lb/> to read Hebrew&#44; and nearly every lady in Synagogue&#44; particularly<lb/> the young and middle aged reads her prayers in that language&#44;<lb/> and can follow the leader officiating.  Your small Bible</p>
			<pb n="8"/>
				<p>is in every house&#44; and every one of my pupils is furnished<lb/> with it.  Every Jewish child in school&#44; for I have many<lb/> Christian pupils too&#44; learn&#44; to translate Bible and prayer<lb/> Book.  So you see&#44; tho&#39; we are far from the great<lb/> centres of enlightenment&#44; and tho&#39; I am as rusty as an<lb/> old door nail&#44; we can compare&#44; as a Congregation&#44;<lb/> with the best&#44; and not be ashamed.  It would do your<lb/> heart good to witness the solemnity and decorum of our<lb/> worship.  On <add>Hebrew</add> we began at 8 and tho&#39; nothing was<lb/> omitted as laid down in the old Portuguese sidder<add>&#63;</add><lb/> we finished at 11.  <date>Kippoor</date> we began at 6&#44; and at 6<lb/> P.M. I dismissed the congregation.  I do not allow<lb/> the Shophar to be blown till the whole of the <add>Hebrew</add> is<lb/> finished&#44; whereby much confusion and indecency are<lb/> avoided.  For men I to have it sounded before <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> there would be a rush to leave&#44; by which the whole affect<lb/> of the day would be destroyed.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">i have written you&#44; not one megillah but<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; so I defer writing more <add>Hebrew</add>.  I hope to<lb/> hear that your health is good&#44; in which my dear wife<lb/> heartily joins&#8212;and with regards to your nieces&#44; and<lb/> remembrances to inquiring friends&#44; and many years of<lb/> happiness and comfort  I am</p>
