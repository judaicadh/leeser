				<p><addressee>Rev. I. Leeser</addressee>&#44; <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(4)">Dear Sir&#33;  Your kind<lb/> letter of the <date>6th</date> inst. was duly received&#44; and my answer<lb/> to it must be <sic>a</sic> apology&#44; for not having sent&#44; as<lb/> yet&#44; the conclusion of the article &#39;On the philosophy &#38;c.<lb/> Suffering&#44; for nearly 3 weeks&#44; with ulcers&#44; so much so&#44;<lb/> that I was confined to my bed&#44; and could not even attend<lb/> to my ministerial duties&#44; I was utterly unable&#44; to <hi rend="underline">finish</hi><lb/> the translation of the little work.  Were it worth the while<lb/> to publish a <hi rend="underline">portion</hi> of the balance&#44; I would <del>do</del> send you<lb/> that part&#58; A portion would not do&#44; and the whole <del>a</del> I<lb/> could not finish&#44;&#8212;in as much as&#44;&#8212;besides my sickness&#44; I am<lb/> so much occupied in my preparations for the holidays&#44; that it<lb/> is impossible to me&#44; to accommodate you this month.  Being<lb/> as you well know&#44; but one year in the ministry&#44; and this&#44; too&#44;<lb/> in a Portuguese Congr.&#44; I have to study all <sic>chaunts</sic><lb/> for the coming holidays&#44; and to prepare no less than 11<lb/> sermons for <hi rend="underline">one</hi> month&#44;&#8212;besides all this&#8212;<lb/> my approaching marriage occupies also somewhat<lb/> my mind.  Still&#44; for the <date>Nov.</date> Number of your Occ.<lb/> you shall have the paper&#44; as I work at it by fits<lb/> &#38; starts.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Your requests&#44; expressed in your last&#44; shall be<lb/> most faithfully complied with.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Things are going on here in the old smooth way&#44;<lb/> but I would inform you of the following facts&#44; relative to</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>the <placeName>NOrleans</placeName> sufferers.&#8212;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">As soon as an appeal was made here by the<lb/> papers&#44; the members of my Congregation contributed to the general fund&#44;<lb/> &#8220;handsomely &#38; liberally&#44;&#8221; without being induced by a Charity sermon&#44;<lb/> which I do not approve of&#44; as previous observations have taught me&#44;<lb/> that they never result in the wished for success&#44; unless&#44; we adopt&#8212;<lb/> as <persName>Dr. Raphall</persName> has done&#44; lately&#44; the plan of calling the names<lb/> of every one present&#44; and thus causing him&#44; to proclaim loudly<lb/> the amount he is willing to contribute&#44;&#8212;a process most improper&#44;<lb/> illiberal &#38; uncharitable.  <persName>Rev. Jacobs</persName> adopted the delivery of a<lb/> Charity Sermon&#44; and failed&#44; for the contribution amounted only to &#36;81&#44;<lb/> which was afterward increased by private subscription&#44; to<lb/> the round sum of &#36;100.  But&#44; instead of remitting this sum to <del>the</del><lb/> our distressed fellow Israelites&#44; these orthodox men sent it to the<lb/> newspaper&#45;Office&#44; as &#8220;a first collection&#44;&#8221; for which&#44; of course&#44;<lb/> they received a sublime puff.  We acted otherwise.  As soon<lb/> as the appeal from the Jews reached us&#44; <persName>Col. Jacobs</persName> &#38; my humble self&#44; although sick went about<lb/> on <date>Friday the 25</date> ult.&#44; after returning from a funeral&#44; and within <hi rend="underline">two</hi><lb/> hours time we had collected the amount of &#36;115.  Had we not<lb/> thought it proper to send the money forthwith&#44; according to the rule&#58;<lb/> &#8220;give cito dat&#44; bis dat&#44;&#8221; <del>and</del> were not so many of my Congr.<lb/> absent&#44; or had we  received the appeal 8 days before&#44; the sum<lb/> would at least have been 5 times larger.  <persName>Rev. Jacobs</persName>&#44; not<lb/> wishing to remain<del>ed</del> behind me&#44; again delivered&#44; last <date>Sunday</date>&#44;<lb/> a Charity Sermon&#44; which had been advertised during the <hi rend="underline">whole</hi> week&#44; in<lb/> all city&#45;papers&#44; and the amount collected&#44; reached only<lb/> about &#36;60.  it must also be remarked&#44; that at least 2&#47;3<lb/> of both the collections at <persName>Rev J&#39;s</persName>. Synagogue&#44; were contributed by<lb/> members of my Congr. Present at the <sic>Occassion</sic>&#8212;He following</p>

This evidence&#44; that our un&#45;<lb/>fortunate brethren are sympathized with&#44; nerves and enables<lb/> us to continue our exertions for their speedy relief&#44; and al&#45;<lb/>though we feel humiliated &#38; humbled at the necessity that<lb/> existed for appeal to our kindhearted friends abroad&#44; a double<lb/> gratification is the result in the exhibition of fraternal love&#44;<lb/> and noble generosity on your part&#44; and the visible &#38; cheering<lb/> benefits&#44; arising from your assistance in relieving the distressed<lb/> who are in want.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Please make to those&#44; who contributed so promptly&#44;<lb/> our kindest <sic>acknowledgement</sic>&#44; and for yourself be pleased to<lb/> receive our special thanks for the pains you have been put to&#44;<lb/> in making the necessary arrangements&#44; so punctually to trans&#45;<lb/>mit it.I am very truly&#44;</p>

				<p>On <date>Sept. 9</date>. we read in the <placeName>Charleston</placeName> Courier&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">We were gratified also&#44; to perceive from <placeName>New&#45;<lb/> Orleans</placeName>&#44; that the amount of &#36;115&#44; less the exchange&#44; had been<lb/> remitted to that city for the relief of the suffering Israelites<lb/> there on the <date>25</date> ult. by the members of <placeName>Hasell Str.</placeName> Synagogue<lb/> of this city&#59; &#40;The congr. of Reformed Israelites.&#41; which fact had</p>

				<p>not been communicated to us&#44; otherwise we should at once<lb/> have done them the justice&#44; of chronicling their prompt action<lb/> on the occasion&#44; more especially as the members of this con&#45;<lb/>gregation had already contributed so handsomely&#44; through<lb/> us to the <persName>Howard</persName> association&#8221;&#8212;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I communicate to you these facts &#38;<lb/> papers&#44; in order to do justice any Congr. &#38; myself&#44;&#8212;and<lb/> hope&#44; you will give notice of them in due time.&#8212;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I conveyed your respects to <persName>Miss Rachel</persName>&#44;<lb/> and she requested me to return them to you&#44; as she<lb/> knows you very well.
