            <p rend="indent(4)">Dear Sir! Your kind<lb/> letter of the <date>6th</date> inst. was
                duly received, and my answer<lb/> to it must be <sic>a</sic> apology, for not having
                sent, as<lb/> yet, the conclusion of the article 'On the philosophy &amp;c.<lb/>
                Suffering, for nearly 3 weeks, with ulcers, so much so,<lb/> that I was confined to
                my bed, and could not even attend<lb/> to my ministerial duties, I was utterly
                unable, to <hi rend="underline">finish</hi><lb/> the translation of the little work.
                Were it worth the while<lb/> to publish a <hi rend="underline">portion</hi> of the
                balance, I would <del>do</del> send you<lb/> that part: A portion would not do, and
                the whole <del>a</del> I<lb/> could not finish,—in as much as,—besides my sickness,
                I am<lb/> so much occupied in my preparations for the holidays, that it<lb/> is
                impossible to me, to accommodate you this month. Being<lb/> as you well know, but
                one year in the ministry, and this, too,<lb/> in a Portuguese Congr., I have to
                study all <sic>chaunts</sic><lb/> for the coming holidays, and to prepare no less
                than 11<lb/> sermons for <hi rend="underline">one</hi> month,—besides all this—<lb/>
                my approaching marriage occupies also somewhat<lb/> my mind. Still, for the
                    <date>Nov.</date> Number of your Occ.<lb/> you shall have the paper, as I work
                at it by fits<lb/> &amp; starts.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Your requests, expressed in your last, shall be<lb/> most faithfully
                complied with.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Things are going on here in the old smooth way,<lb/> but I would
                inform you of the following facts, relative to</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>the <placeName>NOrleans</placeName> sufferers.—</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">As soon as an appeal was made here by the<lb/> papers, the members
                of my Congregation contributed to the general fund,<lb/> “handsomely &amp;
                liberally,” without being induced by a Charity sermon,<lb/> which I do not approve
                of, as previous observations have taught me,<lb/> that they never result in the
                wished for success, unless, we adopt—<lb/> as <persName>Dr. Raphall</persName> has
                done, lately, the plan of calling the names<lb/> of every one present, and thus
                causing him, to proclaim loudly<lb/> the amount he is willing to contribute,—a
                process most improper,<lb/> illiberal &amp; uncharitable. <persName>Rev.
                    Jacobs</persName> adopted the delivery of a<lb/> Charity Sermon, and failed, for
                the contribution amounted only to $81,<lb/> which was afterward increased by private
                subscription, to<lb/> the round sum of $100. But, instead of remitting this sum to
                    <del>the</del><lb/> our distressed fellow Israelites, these orthodox men sent it
                to the<lb/> newspaper-Office, as “a first collection,” for which, of course,<lb/>
                they received a sublime puff. We acted otherwise. As soon<lb/> as the appeal from
                the Jews reached us, <persName>Col. Jacobs</persName> &amp; my humble self, although
                sick went about<lb/> on <date>Friday the 25</date> ult., after returning from a
                funeral, and within <hi rend="underline">two</hi><lb/> hours time we had collected
                the amount of $115. Had we not<lb/> thought it proper to send the money forthwith,
