			<p rend="indent(1)">Dear Uncle.</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">Your letter of <date>Monday</date> satisfied me that you were<lb/> better&#59; but the one you wrote on <date>Wednesday</date> completely satisfied<lb/> me&#44; that you were recovering&#44; and your spirits were good&#44;<lb/> better even than usual.  I almost flatter myself&#44; that<lb/> my book contributed something to that result&#44; if so&#44; I really<lb/> must <sic>thinke</sic> it one of the most desirable results it<lb/> could have.  I am much indebted to <persName>Mr. Cohen</persName> for his<lb/> considerate kindness in handing the paper to you&#44; and it proves that<lb/> his friendliness towards me has not abated.  Have the goodness to<lb/> express to him my sense of obligation for his firm support he<lb/> always extended to me in my <add>&#63;</add> <sic>enterprizes</sic>&#44; and assure<lb/> him&#44; that I am rejoiced&#44; that a  judicious man like himself<lb/> has not found reason to abate of his support&#44; which he once<lb/> extended.  There is so little to cheer me on&#44; that such appro&#45;<lb/>bation is doubly<add>&#63;</add> valuable.&#95; I would write to him myself&#44; but<lb/> I have heard of no opportunity&#44; and it is almost useless to<lb/> write by mail&#44; when I have you&#44; to speak for me.&#95;&#95;The whole<lb/> of the contents of your letter are noted&#44; and I return my<lb/> sincere thanks for the expression of your good will&#44; and I<lb/> trust&#44; that the result may not disappoint us.</p>
				<p>I send you&#44; to the care of <persName>David Judah</persName>&#44; thirty copies of the<lb/> Discourses&#59; they are sent in a box which my printers<lb/> have d&#39;spatched to <persName>Mr. Herman</persName> Bookseller&#44; in <placeName>Market near<lb/> North Street</placeName>.  I expect he will charge 50&#162; freight.  <persName>Mr. Judah</persName></p>
			<pb n="1V"/>
				<p>may inquire for them by <date>Wednesday</date> or <date>Thursday</date>&#44; when I expect&#44; they will<lb/> have been received.  When I mentioned in one of my letters that the<lb/> Editor of the Patriot <sic>notice</sic> it&#44; I neglected to mention the manner<lb/> in which it might be done.  <persName>Mr. Judah</persName>&#44; who in all likelihood knows<lb/> <persName>Mr. Minroe</persName>&#44; might take a copy to him as a <hi rend="underline">present</hi>&#44; editors other&#95;<lb/>wise cannot speak&#44; and request him to read it.  It is highly probable<lb/> that he will notice it.  You might have half a dozen placed at some<lb/> bookstore&#59; they will charge a commission for selling&#44; but that need<lb/> not be minded&#44; if a few could thereby be made to circulate among<lb/>. the Goyim&#44; particularly the ministers&#44; who may not altogether relish<lb/> to find sounder doctrines among us&#44; than they give us credit for.&#95;&#95;<lb/>  However you may do as you please.&#95;&#95;Perhaps it might also be advi&#45;<lb/>sable to have a copy sent to <persName>Mr. J. H. Phesants</persName> to <placeName>Richmond</placeName>&#59;<lb/> but you &#38; <persName>Mr. Judah</persName> must judge of that between yourselves&#44;<lb/> I myself do not like to write to Editors&#44; it looks&#44; and would<lb/> in fact be&#44; like fishing for compliments&#59;&#8212;but if friends do it&#44; it is<lb/> quite another thing.&#95;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I was sorry to hear last week&#44; that <persName>Mr. Jude</persName> was dead.  I heard<lb/> it from <persName>Rebecca Ansel</persName>.&#95;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">It grieves me to hear so much blame attached to Jews<lb/> for the recent failures.  <persName>Herman</persName>&#44; you think&#44; is now called a Jew&#33;<lb/>  he is married to a Goya&#44; his children are Goyim&#44; his partners<lb/> are Goyim&#33;  It is also bad&#59; so much for liberality&#33;  So much more necessi&#45;<lb/>ty for diffusing a knowledge of our religion abroad&#44; &#38; show&#44; that rogue&#95;<lb/>ry is not belonging to our creed.  Another house&#44; deeply connected with<lb/> <placeName>New Orleans</placeName> has failed here&#44; <persName>Jackson&#44; Riddle &#38; Co.</persName>&#44; they are no Jews&#59;<lb/> the only Jews that are gone here are <persName>Isaac Phillips</persName> &#38; <persName>Joseph L<add>&#63;</add> Moss</persName>&#59;<lb/> particulars have not come to my knowledge I do not like to ask.</p>
			<pb n="2R"/>
				<p>News of any other sort are very rare here.&#95;&#95;There was a fireman&#39;s parade<lb/> today &#38; I did not see it all.&#95;  Our Synagogue since its repairs is<lb/> much improved in appearance&#59; painting are other alterations has<lb/> also improved the sound.&#95;&#95;You have I can imagine here large a number<lb/> of people inquire about you&#59; everyone seemed concerned to hear of<lb/> your illness &#38; your recovery too delightell<add>&#63;</add>&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Give my best regards to <persName>Aunt R.</persName> <persName>Mrs DePass</persName>&#44; <persName>Messrs<lb/> Judah</persName> &#38; <persName>Block</persName> &#38; the young ladies.</p>

				<p><persName>Misses Rachel</persName> &#38; <persName>Simha Peixotto</persName> &#38; <persName>B. <add>&#63;</add></persName> desire<lb/> their love to you &#38; <persName>Aunt Rehine</persName>.&#95;&#95;&#95;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The desire also to be remembered to <persName>Abby</persName> &#38; <persName>D. Judah</persName>&#44;<lb/> and the rest of the family&#44; especially  <persName>Mr. DeP.</persName> From <persName>Mrss S C.P.</persName></p>
				<p>Tell <persName>Mr Cohen</persName> that I am rejoiced at his mother&#39;s recovery&#44;<lb/> and that it may be an earnest of further prospering<add>&#63;</add> to their<lb/> family.&#8212;</p>
