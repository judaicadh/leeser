            <p rend="indent(1)">Dear Uncle.</p>
            <p rend="indent(2)">Your letter of <date>Monday</date> satisfied me that you were<lb/>
                better; but the one you wrote on <date>Wednesday</date> completely satisfied<lb/>
                me, that you were recovering, and your spirits were good,<lb/> better even than
                usual. I almost flatter myself, that<lb/> my book contributed something to that
                result, if so, I really<lb/> must <sic>thinke</sic> it one of the most desirable
                results it<lb/> could have. I am much indebted to <persName>Mr. Cohen</persName> for
                his<lb/> considerate kindness in handing the paper to you, and it proves that<lb/>
                his friendliness towards me has not abated. Have the goodness to<lb/> express to him
                my sense of obligation for his firm support he<lb/> always extended to me in my
                    <add>?</add>
                <sic>enterprizes</sic>, and assure<lb/> him, that I am rejoiced, that a judicious
                man like himself<lb/> has not found reason to abate of his support, which he
                once<lb/> extended. There is so little to cheer me on, that such appro-<lb/>bation
                is doubly<add>?</add> valuable._ I would write to him myself, but<lb/> I have heard
                of no opportunity, and it is almost useless to<lb/> write by mail, when I have you,
                to speak for me.__The whole<lb/> of the contents of your letter are noted, and I
                return my<lb/> sincere thanks for the expression of your good will, and I<lb/>
                trust, that the result may not disappoint us.</p>
            <p>I send you, to the care of <persName>David Judah</persName>, thirty copies of
                the<lb/> Discourses; they are sent in a box which my printers<lb/> have d'spatched
                to <persName>Mr. Herman</persName> Bookseller, in <placeName>Market near<lb/> North
                    Street</placeName>. I expect he will charge 50¢ freight. <persName>Mr.
                    Judah</persName></p>
            <pb n="1V"/>
            <p>may inquire for them by <date>Wednesday</date> or <date>Thursday</date>, when I
                expect, they will<lb/> have been received. When I mentioned in one of my letters
                that the<lb/> Editor of the Patriot <sic>notice</sic> it, I neglected to mention the
                manner<lb/> in which it might be done. <persName>Mr. Judah</persName>, who in all
                likelihood knows<lb/>
                <persName>Mr. Minroe</persName>, might take a copy to him as a <hi rend="underline"
                    >present</hi>, editors other_<lb/>wise cannot speak, and request him to read it.
                It is highly probable<lb/> that he will notice it. You might have half a dozen
                placed at some<lb/> bookstore; they will charge a commission for selling, but that
                need<lb/> not be minded, if a few could thereby be made to circulate among<lb/>. the
                Goyim, particularly the ministers, who may not altogether relish<lb/> to find
                sounder doctrines among us, than they give us credit for.__<lb/> However you may do
                as you please.__Perhaps it might also be advi-<lb/>sable to have a copy sent to
                    <persName>Mr. J. H. Phesants</persName> to <placeName>Richmond</placeName>;<lb/>
                but you &amp; <persName>Mr. Judah</persName> must judge of that between
                yourselves,<lb/> I myself do not like to write to Editors, it looks, and would<lb/>
                in fact be, like fishing for compliments;—but if friends do it, it is<lb/> quite
                another thing._</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I was sorry to hear last week, that <persName>Mr. Jude</persName>
                was dead. I heard<lb/> it from <persName>Rebecca Ansel</persName>._</p>
