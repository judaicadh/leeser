            <p rend="indent(2)">Dear Sir,</p>
            <p rend="indent(3)">Shortly after the date of<lb/> my last, <date>17th</date> ult, I had
                the pleasure of re<lb/>ceiving your valued lines of <date>4th</date> ult. I am
                hap<lb/>py to reply that during the last two months<lb/> peace has prevailed among
                us. Previously<lb/> we had enjoyed it between two and three<lb/> years, when
                unfortunately it was interrupt<lb/>ed, and a secular paper was made the vehi<lb/>cle
                for placing all the supposed grievances of<lb/> the congregation before the eyes of
                strangers.<lb/> Those really interested in the welfare of the<lb/> Jewish name left
                the claimants to reform<lb/> all the benefit thereof (if they could find any<lb/> in
                it) but when a new field was opened, thro'<lb/> the Jewish press, publishing such
                gross misstate<lb/>ments as would lead our brethren to believe<lb/> that the
                religious agitation now prevalent is<lb/> felt all over the world to be requisite
                for the</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>“promotion of devotion, order, and decorum” while<lb/> indeed the standard is of the
                people's own making<lb/> and has no connection whatever with the reli<lb/>gion of
                the Bible, it was necessary to controvert<lb/> the same three articles on the
                subject having<lb/> been sent to the Chronicle as you have doubt<lb/>less seen in a
                late number. When changes are<lb/> known to be proposed in the spirit of religion,
                I<lb/> have no doubt the present opponents would<lb/> be among the first to hail all
                improvements.<lb/> But I allude to these things confidentially.<lb/> It is generally
                my opinion that the least<lb/> said about them the better, if it can be helped,<lb/>
                for man's disposition seems often to have an<lb/> infatuation in favor of
                contradiction, and<lb/> the more opposition his inclinations meet with<lb/> the more
                strengthened they become whether for<lb/> good or for evil. At the present time, we
                are,<lb/> thank God, in the enjoyment of the great bles<lb/>sing of peace, and I
                sincerely hope that it may<lb/> long continue, and be a progressive one. About<lb/>
                <persName>Mr. S.</persName> I believe among us he has no friend<lb/> who would go to
                the trouble of speaking to him, which<lb/> would perhaps also be useless. Even when
                he made</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>a show of religion he was not a popular man,<lb/> notwithstanding his learning
                besides. <persName>Mr. Car<lb/>dose</persName> suggests that you should make
                known<lb/> thro' the Occident your sentiments regarding<lb/> his conduct in the
                disavowal <del>o</del>of his religion. <persName>Mr.<lb/> C.</persName> requested me
                also to offer his regards to you.</p>
