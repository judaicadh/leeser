            <p>Dear Uncle.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Last Evening <persName>Mr Goldsmidt</persName> gave me your letter
                of the<lb/> day before while at <persName>Mr. Solis'</persName> to marry
                        <persName>Israel<add>?</add> Levy</persName> of
                    <placeName>Richmond</placeName> to<lb/>
                <persName>Mr S.'s</persName> daughter. I am really glad to understand that you
                are<lb/> so much better and only hope it may long continue to be the<lb/> same. You
                want the news of this place<lb/> but as I am engaged as you well know from early in
                the morning to late in the evening<lb/> I do hear but little. But some few Items I
                will just tell. Yester-<lb/>day week <persName>Miss Israel</persName> was married;
                the wedding went off delightfully<lb/> people danced, sang &amp; were merry. Some
                remained till three or four in<lb/> the morning, and I staid till near ½ past
                eleven. The same may be<lb/> said of yesterday's <sic>frolick</sic>; there was
                almost literally “fife, fiddle &amp;<lb/> drum,” or tambourine, fiddles &amp;
                    <sic>clarionett</sic>, I left also about ½ aft. 11<lb/> and already I am up a
                little after 5 to send this if possible by<lb/>
                <persName>David I. Cohen</persName> whom I just stumbled upon in the street
                yester-<lb/>day morning during a recess which I gave to the boys, in consequence
                of<lb/> keeping them in till 2 on account of the wedding. <persName>Mr.
                    Allen</persName><lb/> made a Berit<add>?</add> last <date>Thursday</date>, which
                is the fourth we have<lb/> had in about three weeks. This year thus far there have
                been 10<lb/> funerals, 9 Berits and three weddings, besides several female
                children<lb/> were born during this same periods. <persName>Miss Rose
                    Hays</persName> is to be<lb/> married this fall to <persName>Mr. Charles
                    Marx</persName> of <placeName>Richmond</placeName>, but this<lb/> no doubt is
                old news. <persName>Mr. Mordecai</persName> was here during the<lb/> holydays, when
                I delivered an address on education, I have not<lb/> yet received it back; I believe
                that it was not very well<lb/> received by many on account of its coming home too
                much; but<lb/> this of course cannot be avoided, when one wishes to do his duty.<lb/>
                <persName>Mr. Mordecai</persName> came here for the purpose of leaving
                    <persName>Laura</persName> at<lb/> a boarding school; she appears to be a very
                fine girl. I understand<lb/> that <persName>Miss Peixotto</persName> is learning the
                stock making business; I believe<lb/> it must be true, altho' she did not tell me so
                herself. My <sic>scholl</sic> now<lb/> numbers 16 boys; <persName>David
                    Sarfaty</persName> has not yet come, and I doubt whether<lb/> he will come in a
                hurry. <persName>Simha P.</persName> told me that she had heard but not direct</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>from her uncle <persName>Peixotto</persName> that <persName>Mr. Sarfaty</persName>
                did not approve of my circular;<lb/>
                <persName>Mr. S.</persName> by the way is a very intelligent man, but rather too
                fond of setting<lb/> himself up as a literary judge and <sic>critick</sic>, and in
                this way he has <sic>criticised</sic><lb/> some of my sermons which I allowed
                    <persName>Simha</persName> to copy and send to him,<lb/> which however to me
                appears rather ridiculous as his education<lb/> has been by no means one from which
                a man could derive that<lb/> peculiar talent so requisite to form a correct judgment
                of literary com-<lb/>positions, which is full as difficult as book-keeping or buying
                &amp; selling<lb/> dry goods and groceries. Several people have spoken about sending
                their<lb/> children but I know not whether they are coming or not. <persName>Miss
                    Rebecca<lb/> Phillips</persName> desired me to convey to you her regrets at not
                having seen you.<lb/> She sends her love, as do also many others.
                    <persName>Theodore</persName> wrote to me and he<lb/> &amp;
                    <persName>Myrtilla</persName> both desire their affectionate remembrance.
                    <persName>Isaac Seixas</persName><lb/> inquires about you all in a letter I got
                on <date>Monday</date>. <persName>Mr. Goldsmit</persName><lb/> &amp; <persName>Mr
                    Hyneman</persName> were much gratified by your hospitality.</p>
