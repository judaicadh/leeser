				<p rend="align(right)">Abstract of contract between H.C. D. Judah</p>
				<p rend="align(right)">and <persName role="author">M. N. Nathan</persName></p>
				<p>The said Congn. engaged to pay <persName role="author">M. N.

			<p rend="indent(1)">It is further understood that this contract is entered<lb/> into under the present existing constitution Laws and Regulations<lb/> of the said Hebrew Congregation &#8220;Dispd. of Judah.&#8221;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">This contract&#44; signed in Duplicate&#47;shall<lb/>&#39; commence from this first day of <date>Feby 1850. 5610</date>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(10)">Signed <persName role="author">M. N. Nathan</persName></p>
			<p rend="indent(9)"><persName role="author">G. Kursheedt</persName> Preside.</p>
				<p>Memoradum</p>
				<p>This contract was entered into in accordance with resolution of Congregation<lb/> of <date>Jany. 24Th 1850</date>. specifying &#8220;that <hi rend="underline">after</hi> <persName>Judah Louis Esq.</persName> Shall sign the act<lb/> of donation of the Synagogue&#44; the Presidt. shall contract with <persName role="author">Revd. M. N. N.</persName><lb/> &#8220;for his services as Hazan &#38; Preacher to their congregation during the term of his<lb/> &#8220;good behavior and ability &#40;temporary sickness not to interfere&#41; to perform<lb/> &#8220;the services generally conducted by persons occupying the like positions&#8221;<lb/> &#8220;the minister to be bound to give six months notice in writing of his intention<lb/> to resign his office.&#8221;  And be it further enacted &#8220;That any member</p>

			<p rend="indent(1)">Secy.</p>
			<p rend="indent(9)"><placeName>New Orleans</placeName> <date>Octr. 1St 5611 <add>1850</add></date></p>
				<p>My dear <addressee>Leeser</addressee></p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">Herewith you have copy of my contract with<lb/> the congregation.  You know me too well to suppose that I would have<lb/> accepted any engagement under the the dictatorial order of  &#8220;sign or<lb/> resign.&#8221;  Nor would our mutual friend <persName role="author">Gershom Kursheedt</persName> have<lb/> allowed himself to be the medium of such a communication.</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">The provision relative to the preaching was my own act.<lb/>  In the contract drawn up by <persName role="author">G. K.</persName> I was to preach whenever the Presidt.<lb/> called on me to do so.  However safe I might have been with the article<lb/> so worded with <persName role="author">G. K.</persName> as Presidt.&#44; it might have been made a vehicle<lb/> of annoyance under a Presidt. inimical<add>&#63;</add> to me&#44; and therefore rejected<lb/> it.  The last resolution of the Congregation is fair and reasonable<lb/> and prevents the body from condemning me whereas&#59; its silence on<lb/> the subject of fire<add>&#63;</add> is also in my favor.  I must either be acquitted<lb/> or removed&#59; there is no middle course.  Another point is also liable<lb/> to remarking&#8212;viz&#8212;that I must be a party consulted should any alterations<lb/> in the present existing Laws and Regulations be entered upon&#44; affecting<lb/> me personally.  I am protected under any emergency.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The universal feeling of indignation pervades the Jews&#44;<lb/> in this city at the shameful treatment of your late congregation towards<lb/> you.  My advice to you is do not embark in a weekly paper.  It will<lb/> not pay.  Go into business&#44; if not at the <placeName>north</placeName>&#45;at the <placeName>South</placeName>.  Doff the gown<lb/> which you have honored for twenty years.  It will reflect no disgrace on<lb/>  <hi rend="underline">you</hi> to engage in business.  Either as Revd. or plain Mr. you can serve your people.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Our Holy days went off harmoniously&#44; as tho&#39; we had been established<lb/> for a quarter of a century.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">All your friends including <persName>Mrs. N.</persName> and myself wish you<lb/> success and prosperity&#44; health and happiness in whatever you undertake</p>
			<p rend="indent(5)">Your&#39;s affectionately</p>
			<p rend="indent(5)"><persName role="author">M. N. Nathan</persName></p>
			<pb n="2R"/>
				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>New Orleans</placeName> <date>Oct 1. 5611<add>1850</add></date></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">My most worthy friend will excuse the lack of<lb/> my usual punctuality in replying to his last<lb/> recd. form&#44; when I state that the frequent<lb/> <sic>occurence</sic> of Holidays have kept me very<lb/> much occupied during the remainder of the<lb/> time.  I hope what is set forth on the<lb/> annexed page &#40;all which I endorse&#41; will<lb/> satisfy you and your friends that certain<lb/> expressions have been attributed to me which<lb/> I never uttered.  The Constitution &#38; By Laws<lb/> of the Congregation are there  I exhibited to you<lb/> when in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>&#44; although they are<lb/> now about to be altered.  You will recollect<lb/> that in our laws there is no mention made<lb/> of a Hazan&#44; wherefore the resolution of the<lb/> congregation given on the <sic>preceeding</sic> page<lb/> was necessary to enable me to enter into<lb/> contract with <persName role="author">Mr. Nathan</persName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The <sic>comse</sic> purused toward you by a<lb/> portion of your congregation meets with<lb/> the universal censure of our people here<lb/> and to my certain knowledge it is severely<lb/> commented upon in many parts of the<lb/> Union.  Never mind friend <persName>Leeser</persName> your<lb/> good acts will outlive the memory of your<lb/> persecutors.  It is the fate of the good to<lb/> have enemies.  <persName>King David</persName> had many&#44; none<lb/> but the insignificant move through the world<lb/> undisturbed.  I hope always to have some<lb/> unfriendly acquaintances&#44; they do us good.<lb/>  There are men who delight in bringing their<lb/> superior down to their own level&#44; but they<lb/> rarely succeed.  I could write volumes on this subject<lb/> but it is not necessary&#44; you know the sentiments of your friend</p>
