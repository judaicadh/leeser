            <p rend="indent(1)">Father of man, whose providence is ever watchful over the<lb/> works
                of they Creatures, be with us this day in our assembling for the<lb/> glorification
                of thy blessed name. Behold! with insufficient strength<lb/> and few in number we
                present ourselves in they presence not relying<lb/> on our might and our wisdom, but
                on thy goodness and on thy aid<lb/> to perfect what we so feebly begin. We feel
                deeply our unworthiness<lb/> to assume the task of becoming the teachers of thy
                word; we are<lb/> penetrated with the painful consciousness that the best among us
                needs<lb/> correction, that the widest requires yet more instruction; <del>yet</del>
                still be Then<lb/> with us in the hours we devote to the diffusion of thy faith,
                teach<lb/> the ignorant how to expound thy law, and render the feeble tongue<lb/>
                eloquent so that we may see blissful fruits <del>to</del> ripening from our
                exertions,<lb/> and thy kingdom taking deep root in hearts and the seat of
                ignorance<lb/> and vanity. Make us and our scholars alive to the consolations
                which<lb/> flow from thy revealed word, the unsearchable streams of knowledge<lb/>
                which are diffused over the world through thy spirit which thou didst<lb/> spread
                over thy people when they stood trembling before thy glory which<lb/> was made
                manifest before their eyes on your <placeName>Sinai</placeName>, when thy power<lb/>
                had humbled their oppressors and broken the chains of their servitude.<lb/> Fill us
                with gratitude for the many benefits which <placeName>Israel</placeName> has ere
                obtain<lb/>ed at thy hands, for the many redemptions which so <add>?</add> us
                from<lb/> destruction when strangers to thy law rose up to blot out our name<lb/>
                from the face of the earth; and O! bad enchantment and persuasion<lb/> to our words
                that we may succeed in <add>?</add> the young scions<lb/> of thy household who come
                to us for instruction with a firm resolu<lb/><add>?</add> true and faithful to thee,
                O God! who hast been so benefi-<lb/>cent towards their fathers, who have preserved
                for them up to this day</p>
            <pb n="1V"/>
            <p>the treasures which no gold, nor pearl can purchase, which no earthly<lb/>
                possessions can equal in value. For great, Almighty Father! That we and our pupils
                may<lb/> have a full appreciation of what thy teaching has been to us, that it<lb/>
                alone shielded us when the arrows of misfortune flow thick around<lb/> us, when the
                burning sun in mid-day seemed to us shorn of his<lb/> rags and warmth, when the
                skies appeared to us clothed in black<lb/>ness; when all joy was fled, and
                destruction threatened to engulf us<lb/> for ever. Let us understand it fully, that
                it was not our perseverance,<lb/> our obduracy of character against which
                    <add>?</add> warns of misfortune<lb/> exhausted their rage in vain; but that it
                was the strength of they word and<lb/> the panoply of thy covenant which dwells
                within us, which made us strong<lb/> and unconquerable, which imbued us with the
                resistance to the worlds assaults<lb/> which the strangers have beheld with
                astonishment, which our opponents have<lb/> failed to explain, regarding it, as we
                do, in the light of a manifestation of<lb/> thy miraculous power.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Do this, for the sake of thy holiness, for the sake of thy glory
                which dwells<lb/> in <placeName>Israel</placeName>; so that our sons and daughters
                may be drawn to thy worship,<lb/> firmly clinging to thy law, as their tree of life,
                under the branches of<lb/> bad clime they can find shelter and safety; and vouchsafe
                that what<lb/> we commence this day in fear and trembling very branch out into
                a<lb/> nursery of righteousness and knowledge, wherein<add>?</add> mercy may issue
                to<lb/> labour for the spread of thy kingdom, as messengers of blessed tidings
                to<lb/> many yet unborn. By this, O Father! shall we recognize that we<lb/> have not
                    <del>laboured</del> toiled for naught, and that our scarce offered in
                humanity,<lb/> has been received in favour before thy mercy's throne. And let
                us<lb/> beseech thee also, that thou wagest plant in our hearts brotherly<lb/> love
                and mutual forbearance, that we support each other's pious coun-<lb/>sels and travel
                    <add>?</add>tedly on that road which leads to thy happy mansions,<lb/> where
                they are to dwell, who have here on earth fulfilled thy will.</p>
            <pb n="2R"/>
            <p>Strengthen our virtuous inclination that we may subdue the evil which<lb/> is within
                us, above all the spirit of domination, arrogance and
                    self-<lb/>suffiency<add>?</add> which misleads mortals to exalt themselves above
                their fellows<lb/> who like them are the objects of thy care, like them the children
                of thy<lb/> household. And thus let us in humility approach thy presence, ready<lb/>
                to labour for thy glory on whatere station Thou wilt assign us, and<lb/> thus shall
                we know that we have found favour in thy eyes and that our<lb/> prayer has been
                accepted in mercy.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Yea bless our undertaking, not for our sake, but for the sake<lb/>
                of the covenant Thou madest with our fathers, <persName>Abraham</persName>,
                    <persName>Isaac</persName><lb/> &amp; <persName>Jacob</persName>, that there
                wouldst be a God with them and their seed<lb/> for ever. Amen.</p>
