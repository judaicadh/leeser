			<p rend="indent(1)">Father of man&#44; whose providence is ever watchful over the<lb/> works of they Creatures&#44; be with us this day in our assembling for the<lb/> glorification of thy blessed name.  Behold&#33; with insufficient strength<lb/> and few in number we present ourselves in they presence not relying<lb/> on our might and our wisdom&#44; but on thy goodness and on thy aid<lb/> to perfect what we so feebly begin.  We feel deeply our unworthiness<lb/> to assume the task of becoming the teachers of thy word&#59; we are<lb/> penetrated with the painful consciousness that the best among us needs<lb/> correction&#44; that the widest requires yet more instruction&#59; <del>yet</del> still be Then<lb/> with us in the hours we devote to the diffusion of thy faith&#44; teach<lb/> the ignorant how to expound thy law&#44; and render the feeble tongue<lb/> eloquent so that we may see blissful fruits <del>to</del> ripening from our exertions&#44;<lb/> and thy kingdom taking deep root in hearts and the seat of ignorance<lb/> and vanity.  Make us and our scholars alive to the consolations which<lb/> flow from thy revealed word&#44; the unsearchable streams of knowledge<lb/> which are diffused over the world through thy spirit which thou didst<lb/> spread over thy people when they stood trembling before thy glory which<lb/> was made manifest before their eyes on your <placeName>Sinai</placeName>&#44; when thy power<lb/> had humbled their oppressors and broken the chains of their servitude.<lb/>  Fill us with gratitude for the many benefits which <placeName>Israel</placeName> has ere obtain<lb/>ed at thy hands&#44; for the many redemptions which so <add>&#63;</add> us from<lb/> destruction when strangers to thy law rose up to blot out our name<lb/> from the face of the earth&#59; and O&#33; bad enchantment and persuasion<lb/> to our words that we may succeed in <add>&#63;</add> the young scions<lb/> of thy household who come to us for instruction with a firm resolu<lb/><add>&#63;</add> true and faithful to thee&#44; O God&#33; who hast been so benefi&#45;<lb/>cent towards their fathers&#44; who have preserved for them up to this day</p>
			<pb n="1V"/>
				<p>the treasures which no gold&#44; nor pearl can purchase&#44; which no earthly<lb/> possessions can equal in value.  For great&#44; Almighty Father&#33; That we and our pupils may<lb/> have a full appreciation of what thy teaching has been to us&#44; that it<lb/> alone shielded us when the arrows of misfortune flow thick around<lb/> us&#44; when the burning sun in mid&#45;day seemed to us shorn of his<lb/> rags and warmth&#44; when the skies appeared to us clothed in black<lb/>ness&#59; when all joy was fled&#44; and destruction threatened to engulf us<lb/> for ever.  Let us understand it fully&#44; that it was not our perseverance&#44;<lb/> our obduracy of character against which <add>&#63;</add> warns of misfortune<lb/> exhausted their rage in vain&#59; but that it was the strength of they word and<lb/> the panoply of thy covenant which dwells within us&#44; which made us strong<lb/> and unconquerable&#44; which imbued us with the resistance to the worlds assaults<lb/> which the strangers have beheld with astonishment&#44; which our opponents have<lb/> failed to explain&#44; regarding it&#44; as we do&#44; in the light of a manifestation of<lb/> thy miraculous power.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Do this&#44; for the sake of thy holiness&#44; for the sake of thy glory which dwells<lb/> in <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#59; so that our sons and daughters may be drawn to thy worship&#44;<lb/> firmly clinging to thy law&#44; as their tree of life&#44; under the branches of<lb/> bad clime they can find shelter and safety&#59; and vouchsafe that what<lb/> we commence this day in fear and trembling very branch out into a<lb/> nursery of righteousness and knowledge&#44; wherein<add>&#63;</add> mercy may issue to<lb/> labour for the spread of thy kingdom&#44; as messengers of blessed tidings to<lb/> many yet unborn.  By this&#44; O Father&#33; shall we recognize that we<lb/> have not <del>laboured</del> toiled for naught&#44; and that our scarce offered in humanity&#44;<lb/> has been received in favour before thy mercy&#39;s throne.  And let us<lb/> beseech thee also&#44; that thou wagest plant in our hearts brotherly<lb/> love and mutual forbearance&#44; that we support each other&#39;s pious coun&#45;<lb/>sels and travel <add>&#63;</add>tedly on that road which leads to thy happy mansions&#44;<lb/> where they are to dwell&#44; who have here on earth fulfilled thy will.</p>
			<pb n="2R"/>
				<p>Strengthen our virtuous inclination that we may subdue the evil which<lb/> is within us&#44; above all the spirit of domination&#44; arrogance and self&#45;<lb/>suffiency<add>&#63;</add> which misleads mortals to exalt themselves above their fellows<lb/> who like them are the objects of thy care&#44; like them the children of thy<lb/> household.  And thus let us in humility approach thy presence&#44; ready<lb/> to labour for thy glory on whatere station Thou wilt assign us&#44; and<lb/>  thus shall we know that we have found favour in thy eyes and that our<lb/> prayer has been accepted in mercy.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Yea bless our undertaking&#44; not for our sake&#44; but for the sake<lb/> of the covenant Thou madest with our fathers&#44; <persName>Abraham</persName>&#44; <persName>Isaac</persName><lb/> &#38; <persName>Jacob</persName>&#44; that there wouldst be a God with them and their seed<lb/> for ever.  Amen.</p>
