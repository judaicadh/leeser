			<p rend="align(right)">Friday</p>
				<p rend="indent(1)">My dear friend</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">I have a few moments before<lb/> going home to prepare for the <date>Sabbath</date> and devote<lb/> it to you.  Your last letter dated in <date>Decr.</date><lb/> needs no reply now&#44; for everything is changed<lb/> by the death of our late friend <persName>Mr Touro</persName>.<lb/>  Poor good old <add>&#63;</add>&#44; he had noble impulses<lb/> but<add>&#63;</add> his great misfortune was in his want<lb/> of education.  Some of his notions were<lb/> good and to the extent that I can I<lb/> will carry them out&#44; as I have done<lb/> thus far.  I presume I may not be able<lb/> to leave here before <date>July</date> next&#44; and<lb/> his positive and respected instructions<lb/> to different persons&#44; were that after his<lb/> death everything relating to all the<lb/> last offices to be performed should<lb/> be directed and attended to by me<lb/> in person&#44; I shall detain his<lb/> remains until I am read to start<lb/> from here&#44; and until then I shall<lb/> make no final arrangements for<lb/> his burial in <placeName>New Port</placeName>.  In accordance<lb/> with his dislike to ostentatious funer<lb/>als&#44; the interment here was attended<lb/> only by those who chose to come without<lb/> the slightest invitation.  The children of<lb/> three Christian orphans asylums</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>26</p>
				<p>followed the hearse and the Firemens<lb/> Charitable Association&#44; the veterans<lb/> of 14 &#38; 15 also attended.  The hearse I ordered<lb/> to be perfectly plain&#8212;one horse.  The<lb/> coffin&#8212;metal covered with black cloth.  <persName>Genl.<lb/> Plafrey</persName> desired to call out the military<lb/> but we <sic>prefered</sic> to have no display<lb/> and particularly no music&#44; nevertheless<lb/> the number of citizens was immense<lb/> and a general gloom was evident<lb/> The stores on the same square where<lb/> he resided were closed.  Beyond the<lb/> spontaneous actions of the citizens&#44; it<lb/> was an ordinary Jewish funeral with<lb/> the exception that I had those large<lb/> doors of the Synagogue opened while<lb/> the funeral passed.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">He had been unconscious for some<lb/> days before he died.  When he died<lb/> &#40;<persName>Gutheim</persName>&#41; the minister the Doctor the Shamas<lb/> and myself were with him&#44; and until<lb/> the last breath we repeated together the<lb/> usual verses.  I closed his eyes&#8212;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Now <persName>Mr Leeser</persName> I have made up my mind<lb/> to one thing and that is to conduct the<lb/> affair at <placeName>New Port</placeName>&#44; <del>as</del> similarly to what<lb/> I did here&#8212;the only thing that may<lb/> induce me to <del>alt</del> deviate will be in<lb/> case the public civil authorities of that</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p rend="align(right)">27</p>
				<p>city or <placeName>Boston</placeName>&#44; should wish to make<lb/> any demonstrations of respect&#44; then<lb/> I shall feel it a duty to forego all<lb/> private considerations for the object<lb/> of bringing credit to <placeName>Israel</placeName> in the world.<lb/>  Do not misunderstand me&#44; I have no<lb/> idea of the remains leaving my or other<lb/> Jewish hands&#44; it must be a Jewish funeral<lb/> and nothing else&#44; but perhaps I might have<lb/> a service in the synagogue.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I shall see that you take some part in<lb/> the ceremonies&#44; if any take place&#44; but I<lb/> shall only study the general good effect<lb/> to be produced&#44; in selecting ministers to<lb/> officiate on the occasion.  Individual<lb/> preferences&#44; nay the most friendly attach<lb/>ments must not be regarded&#44; when an<lb/> opportunity offers to elevate the nation<lb/> in the eye of those who surround us&#8212;<lb/> you know we have always dispensed<lb/> with the Hakaforth here in <placeName>New Orleans</placeName><lb/> and as it is only a minhag I should like<lb/> to omit it in <placeName>New Port</placeName> if possible.  The<lb/> more quiet and the less <hi rend="underline">singing</hi> at a funeral<lb/> the more imposing it will ever be.  Many<lb/> congregations &#38; societies have offered their services<lb/> in which those of the Hazans have been<lb/> included.  On this occasion I shall not<lb/> study or regard official offers&#44; to interfere</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>28</p>
				<p>with the great object in view.  I know<lb/> some will claim preferences because they<lb/> are Portuguese or are in the Will or<lb/> any other special plea.  Some may<lb/> say you are no longer a Minister.  I shall<lb/> only strive to serve the common cause<lb/> and care little for the pleasure or displeasure<lb/> of any but such as can understand<lb/> my own feelings.  I shall probably<lb/> inform the Jewish public through the<lb/> Occident&#44; as to the time &#38;c of the interment.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">You may depend I have no leisure<lb/> time.  You can not imagine the disgusting<lb/> communications that come to shepherd<lb/> from some of our societies&#44; giving recitals<lb/> of congregational differences jealousies &#38;c.  I<lb/> have to blush frequently&#44; and try to put<lb/> the best face on it.  The main labor now<lb/> devolves on me&#44; and I am Repl<add>&#63;</add> hard<lb/> at work all day&#33;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Oh my dear friend if you knew how I<lb/> had to work to get that Will made&#44; and how<lb/> I strive to serve you&#44; you would pity me.  Alas<lb/> it was not altogether what I wanted yet I am<lb/> thankful to God that ever if I injured myself<lb/> I got the most of what I asked for <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#8212;<lb/>arguments&#44; charges and counter&#45;charges in<lb/> the sums of Institutions till my heart sickened<lb/> I appeared calm but indeed was almost crazy<lb/> ever dreading that nothing would be achieved in<lb/> the end.  The list of Jewish Institutions I made up<lb/> as well as I could.  I had dreadful hard work to raise<lb/> your Education Society from 10 to 20&#44;000</p>
