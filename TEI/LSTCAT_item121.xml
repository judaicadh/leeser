            <p>Reverend Sir/</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">In my letter of the <date>14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Novr.</date> I
                informed<lb/> you of steps taking here for bringing the proposed Union<lb/> under
                the notice of the three Congregations of this city. The<lb/> respective Trustees
                deemed it advisable to have separate<lb/> meetings. At the meeting held by the
                congregation of the<lb/> new Synagogue it was decided to send a delegate or
                Agent<lb/> on their part to the meeting suggested by <persName>Dr. Wise</persName>
                and yourself<lb/> At a meeting of the congregation of which I am a member<lb/> held
                on <date>Thursday evening the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> ultimo I
                submitted<lb/> certain resolutions purporting to <sic>recognise</sic>, not the
                utility<lb/> alone but, under existing circumstances, the absolute<lb/> necessity
                for such a union. The resolutions were referred<lb/> to a committee of Seven myself
                being one among them.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">We met on <date>Sunday the 31<hi rend="sup">st</hi></date> ulto and
                though I did not<lb/> see any necessity for it as I considered we were
                competent<lb/> ourselves to judge whether to recommend the sending of a<lb/>
                delegate or not, I was over ruled and the committee decided<lb/> in writing to
                    <persName>Dr. Rice</persName> to ascertain his sentiments upon it.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">This step unnecessarily delays the presenting of the<lb/>
                committee's report to the congregation: what may be the<lb/> result eventually I
                will not venture to predict.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The discussions held at the meeting of the congregation<lb/> and at
                the committee convinced me that the object of the meeting<lb/> proposed by
                    <persName>Dr. Wise</persName> and yourself was but imperfectly<lb/> understood.
                I <sic>endeavoured</sic> but fear with little success to<lb/> explain that it was
                merely to assemble together Laymen<lb/> and minsters 1d To consider the actual state
                of the<lb/> Jewish community in this country, and 2d. To suggest mea<lb/>sures for
                remedying what might be unsatisfactory in<lb/> State, and otherwise to promote the
                spiritual and Temporal</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>well being of the whole body. Some expressed fears<lb/> that the union once formed
                would if under the guidance<lb/> of faithless shepherds work much mischief. You<lb/>
                are aware in what light innovations are held by many<lb/> and the passage in<lb/>
                <persName>Dr. Wise's</persName> address “if we do not<lb/> stimulate all the
                congregations to establish good schools<lb/> and to institute a reform in their
                synagogues <hi rend="underline">on</hi><lb/>
                <hi rend="underline">modern Jewish principles</hi> &amp;c &amp;c” was much
                ani<lb/>=madverted upon, and I cannot help wishing the revd<lb/> gentleman had not
                put it forth, though I am persuaded he<lb/> meant not that any thing should be
                attempted contrary<lb/> to received Laws and customs; but the word “Reform” has<lb/>
                acquired somehow or another a portentous meaning to<lb/> ears that revere, and
                properly revere our ancient institu<lb/>=tions. In short so many and conflicting
                were the sentiments<lb/> and opinions expressed at the meeting of the
                congregation<lb/> and at that of the committee, as decided me on acceding<lb/> to
                    <persName>Mr. Alexander Kursheedt's</persName>, and other friends' with, as<lb/>

                will<lb/> be in possession of my views “which will be taken only<lb/> for as much as

                meeting<lb/> and will attend it if possible. Might it not be as well<lb/> to make
                the period a little later, say <date>Rosh Hodesh<lb/> Sivan</date>, corresponding to
