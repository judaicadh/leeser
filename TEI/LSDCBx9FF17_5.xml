				<p rend="align(center)">&#8220;Better is open reproof than secret love&#8221;</p>
			<p rend="indent(8)">&#40;Proverbs 27&#41;</p>
				<p>&#40;Ever since I came here this portion of <placeName>America</placeName>&#44; the city of <placeName>Cleveland</placeName>&#44;<lb/> about 3 years ago&#44; there came into my hand the book of the &#8220;Occident&#8221;&#44;<lb/> containing all the interests of the Israelites of these lands&#44; words of<lb/> truth and peace&#44; announcing the news of various communities&#44; their man&#45;<lb/>ners and customs&#44; and gathering also valuable speeches for the explana&#45;<lb/>tion of the Scriptures&#44; according to the depth of their meaning&#44; and I<lb/> rejoiced as over great wealth to see the honored ones and the heads of<lb/> the communities arousing within themselves that jealousy which is dear<lb/> in the sight of God&#44; namely the jealousy among writers through which<lb/> wisdom is increased&#41;.</p>
				<p>Note&#8212;the rest of this&#44; which is evidently intended for the &#8220;Occident&#8221;&#44;<lb/> is a learned exposition on the virtue of humility.  The author seems to<lb/> be well versed in Talmudic and rabbinic learning.  He quotes extensively<lb/> and on almost every line.  The only passage of interest seems to be one<lb/> on the second page&#44; in which the author gives the reason for writing the<lb/> article.  It runs as follows&#58;&#8212;</p>
				<p>Not long ago I read in the &#8220;Occident&#8221; for the month of <date>Shebat</date> just past&#44;<lb/> a letter by the editor.  It is long and valuable.  In it he argues with<lb/> his opponen<del>e</del>t&#44; the <persName>Rabbi Solomon Jacobs</persName>&#44; the latter and complained bit<lb/>terly about him in the &#8220;Asmonean&#8221; because he had sent him his address<lb/> which had already been printed&#44; and the editor of the &#8220;Occident&#8221;&#44; after<lb/> praising him for his learning&#44; had nevertheless found something to cri&#45;<lb/>ticise about him.  This is the reason why <persName>Mr. Jacobs</persName> speaks harshly<lb/> about the editor&#44; saying that his intention was to make him disdainful<lb/> in the eyes of the people and to hurt his dignity.  He upbraids him with<lb/> insulting words and accuses him of not knowing the source of his address&#44;<lb/> and says that he is a student who forgot what he has studied or that he<lb/> does not believe in the tradition of the sages.  He bends his bow to<lb/> shoot his sharp arrows into the heart of the editor of the &#8220;Occident&#8221;&#44;<lb/> and sharpens his sword&#44; a sword of vengeance&#44; to reveal his shame in all<lb/> the corners of the lands of <placeName>America</placeName>.  <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName> answered him with words</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">2</p>
				<p>of peace&#44; that it was never his intention to disgrace him&#44; and&#44; at the<lb/> same time&#44; shows his learning in the explanation of the verse in all its<lb/> branches&#44; about which they are arguing&#44;&#8212;According to the grammar of the<lb/> Hebrew language and by drawing from all the wells of the great ones of<lb/> our faith.  I&#44; knowing <sic>thesmallness</sic> of my worth&#44; do not come to decide<lb/> between them.  For&#44; as I said above&#44; it is possible for both to be corre<lb/><sic>rect</sic>.  Besides&#44; the matter does not touch upon a law of action&#44; and among<lb/> us it is a rule that one must not question a Midrashic interpretation.<lb/>  But for this reason my soul signs in secret&#44; that the fire of dissension<lb/> has broken out among the profound scholars and the flame of quarrels has<lb/> gone up to heaven.  Instead of literary jealousy&#44; there has come its de&#45;<lb/>spised sister&#44; the jealousy for honor&#44; the envy of man for his friend.<lb/>  <persName>Mr. Jacobs</persName> has opened wide his mouth and prides himself by saying&#44; &#8220;My lips<lb/> are with me&#44; I shall make <sic>marsh</sic> my tongue&#44; the time for peace has set&#44; the<lb/> day of vengeance has arrived&#8221;&#44; for this reason the heart of every under&#45;<lb/>standing man aches.  Who has seen such things in <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#63;  This is not<lb/> the way of the Torah&#44; whose ways are the ways of sweetness&#44; and all its<lb/> paths are peace&#44;<sic>etc.</sic></p>
				<p>The letter is signed <persName role="author">Joseph Halevi</persName>&#44; merchant in the city of <placeName>Cleveland</placeName>.</p>
