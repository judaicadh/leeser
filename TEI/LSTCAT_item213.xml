It is<lb/> a lamentable fact&#44; that the Old Testament&#44; particularly the historical books&#44;<lb/> are but little read by the <sic>christians</sic>&#44; and therefore do we find men of<lb/> learning&#44; nay preachers&#44; ignorant of the writings I speak of I shall<lb/> therefore transcribe a portion of <persName>Solomon&#39;s</persName> prayer in the Temple at<lb/> its dedication as contained in the VIII chapter of the first book of Kings.</p>

			<p rend="indent(1)">In support of your assertion concerning the beauty of the gospel you<lb/> introduce a few verses from the <hi rend="underline">sermon on the mount</hi> in the fifth chapter<lb/> of <persName>Matthew</persName>.  By <hi rend="underline">so doing you have imposed upon me an</hi> invidious task&#44;<lb/> namely of attacking the <sic>christian</sic> religion in some manner&#44; when I should have<lb/> been very glad&#44; to have let the gospels <del>at</del> rest.  But I am now called upon to<lb/> defend the tenets of my faith&#44; and dare not therefore shrink from the<lb/> responsibility thus thrown upon me&#44; although this happens without my<lb/> desiring it.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Let me premise that the religion which we profess&#44; is divided<lb/> into three parts&#58; first&#44; duties towards God&#44; secondly&#44; duties towards our fellow men&#44;<lb/> and lastly duties towards ourselves.  The duties  towards God impose upon us<lb/> the belief in the Creator&#44; confidence in His protection&#44; hope in His salvation and<lb/> the observance of His statutes.  The duties towards our fellow men consist in acts<lb/> of charity and benevolence and in abstaining from injuring them&#44; in their person<lb/> property and honour.  Duties towards ourselves are&#58; self preservation &#38;<lb/> self&#45;<sic>defence</sic>&#59; by which I mean that first we shall not depend upon others for our <sic>livelyhood</sic>&#44;<lb/> if we are ourselves capable of making a living&#44; as it is beautifully said<lb/> in the Proverbs of the Fathers&#58; &#8220;Sweet is the learning of the law&#44; combined<lb/> with labour&#44; for to be engaged in both makes us abstain from sin&#59;&#8221; and<lb/> secondly to be careful for the preservation of our health.  Self <sic>defence</sic><lb/> demands of us to conduct ourselves so that we shall not be exposed to<lb/> the hatred or violence of others&#59; but if in spite of all our endeavours we<lb/> are molested and violently attacked&#44; it is lawful to prevent our adversary<lb/> from injuring us&#59; and if he attempts to kill us&#44; it is even permitted to<lb/> slay him&#44; if we can in no other manner prevent him&#59; in support<lb/> of this position&#44; I refer you to Exo.

				<p>repealed&#44; except in the same manner as it has been promulgated&#44; that is<lb/> before the whole nation of <placeName>Isra&#235;l</placeName> in the same manner as the law was given on <placeName>Sinai</placeName>.<lb/>  These preliminaries area <hi rend="underline">sine qua non</hi>&#44; without which no argument&#44;<lb/> however ingenious&#44; can stand the test of Jewish criticism.  Let us now apply<lb/> this rule to the chapter of <persName>Matthew</persName> in question&#44; to test its correctness.  In<lb/> the outset&#44; he&#44; whom the <sic>chirstians</sic> call the Messiah &#40;<persName>Christ</persName>&#41; says him<lb/>self&#59; &#8220;think not that I am come to destroy the law of the prophets&#58; I am not<lb/> come to destroy&#44; but to <sic>fulfil</sic> &#38;c &#38;c.  Here&#44; my dear Prof. of <persName>Christ</persName>&#44; you have<lb/> it <hi rend="underline">from what you must think the highest authority</hi> that <hi rend="underline">the gospels must</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">in every particular</hi> conform to the <hi rend="underline">Mosaic</hi> writings which let me repeat were<lb/> given by the Author of All for the government of <placeName>Isra&#235;l</placeName>&#44; and as you believe in<lb/> Revelation&#44; you must acknowledge&#44; that these writings contain the best code<lb/> of laws that can be devised.  Well then&#44; when <persName>Matthew</persName> says&#44; &#8220;swear not at all&#44;&#8221;<lb/> the <sic>christian</sic> writers are puzzled how to explain it&#44; and the learned <persName>Dr. James<lb/> Beattie</persName> explains it so as to mean any unnecessary oath&#44; which however can<lb/> hardly be the meaning of this passage.  What <persName>Matthew</persName> says in the same chapter<lb/> from the v. 38 to the 41&#44; I am bold to assert has never been fulfilled by fifty<lb/> men from all <sic>christendom</sic> ever since <sic>christianity</sic> was established&#44; and if<lb/> these doctrines were adopted as the general rule of society&#44; every wicked person<lb/> could <hi rend="underline">with impunity despoil his unoffending neighbour</hi>&#59; and let me ask you<lb/> can this be the will of God&#63;  For what did he command the election of<lb/> judges if it were not to see the innocent righted&#63;  And have the Society of Friends&#44;<lb/> who more than any other Christian sect&#44; try to obey the <del>above</del> commandments<lb/> in question&#44; ever acted up to the letter of them&#63;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In the 43 v. of the same chapter <persName>Matthew</persName> says&#58; Ye have heard that it<lb/> has been said&#44; Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate <hi rend="underline">thine</hi> enemy&#59; &#38;c<lb/> Now pardon me&#44; my friend&#44; when I beg of you to tell me in what part of the Old Testa<lb/>ment or any Jewish writing the foregoing sentiment is found&#63;  Hate our<lb/> enemies&#63;  Heavenly father&#33; <sic>has</sic> it come to this&#44; that thy children<lb/> who have suffered for ages persecutions without number for the SANC&#45;<lb/>TIFICATION OF THY HOLY NAME&#44; who have been<lb/> slaughtered like sheep that are dumb before their shearers&#44; without mur&#45;<lb/>muring&#44; without repining&#8212;shall thy children Oh our Father above be<lb/> accused of hating their enemies&#33;  Do they not pray to thee daily&#58;<lb/> &#8220;To prepare the world for Thy kingdom&#44; Almighty God&#44; to cause all flesh to<lb/> &#8220;call Thy name&#44; and to bring to Thee all sinners of the Earth&#44; that all<lb/> &#8220;may receive the yoke of Thy kingdom&#44; and that Thou mayest speedily<lb/> &#8220;reign over all for ever&#44; for Thine is the kingdom&#44; and for ever and ever Thou<lb/> &#8220;wilt reign in glory&#63;&#8221;</p>

				<p>Again we find it commanded in the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ch. 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> v. of Lev. that we shall not<lb/> avenge ourselves&#44; nor even&#44; as we Rabbinical Jews understand the word<lb/> &#8220;<persName>Thitore</persName>&#8221; &#40;transl. in the Eng. version nor bear any grudge&#41; to tell those that<lb/> have offended us&#44; &#8220;look here though you would not do me the favour I asked<lb/> of you&#44; yet will I not do like you have done&#44; here is what you ask for.&#8221;<lb/>  In the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ch. <add>&#63;</add> 5 v. of Exodus we are positively enjoined <hi rend="underline">to assist our</hi><lb/> enemy when we see him in need of our assistance.  In the 24 ch. 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> v. and<lb/> 25 ch. 12 v of the Proverbs <persName>Solomon</persName> tells us&#58; &#8220;Rejoice not when they enemy falleth<lb/> and when he <sic>stumbleth</sic> let not thy heart be glad&#59; lest the Eternal see it&#44; and it<lb/> displease him&#44; and he turn his wrath from him.  If thine enemy be hungry&#44;<lb/> give him bread to <del>it</del> eat&#59; and if he be thirsty&#44; give him water to drink &#38;c Thus<lb/> we clearly see that the Old Testament enjoins those <hi rend="underline">exalted doctrines</hi>&#44; for which<lb/> you give the gospel the sole credit.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">But you will say&#44; <persName>Christ</persName> lived in the time of the Pharisees and<lb/> Scribes&#44; who did not act so&#44; who were hypocrites&#44; and deviated from the letter<lb/> of the law&#63;  Indeed&#33; but even here you would be mistaken&#59; for in the<lb/> Talmud we find the following&#58; &#8220;A stranger came to <hi rend="underline"><persName>Shamai</persName></hi> and told him<lb/> Rabbi I wish to become a <sic>proselite</sic>&#44; but you must teach me the law&#44; while<lb/> I can stand on one leg&#59; but <persName>Shamai</persName> turned him off&#44; not thinking it possible<lb/> to teach him the law in so short a time.  The stranger went next to <persName>Hilled&#44;<lb/> surnamed the Elder</persName>&#44; and repeated the same request&#44; &#8220;my son&#44;&#8221; answered<lb/> the Rabbi&#44; &#8220;what is disagreeable to thee&#44; do not to thy neighbour&#44; &#40;or companion&#41;&#44;<lb/> for thus it is written thou shalt love thy neighbour like thyself&#44; this is the princi&#45;<lb/>ple commandment&#44; and if you observe this strictly you will easily observe<lb/> the other precepts of the law.&#8221;&#8212;What <persName>Matthew</persName> says concerning the punish&#45;<lb/>ment to him&#44; who makes his antagonist ashamed in public&#44; is also found in<lb/> the Proverbs of the Fathers&#44; which declare&#58; &#8220;He&#44; who <del>that</del> makes the face of his<lb/> neighbour turn pale in public&#44; though he has knowledge of the law and has<lb/> otherwise acted well&#44; will not <del>have</del> share in the happiness of the future<lb/> life.&#8221;  What then I ask you again has the gospel taught new to the Jews&#63;<lb/>  Since the Old Testament <sic>containes</sic> all the moral doctrines&#44; and the Rabbins<lb/> &#40;Pharisees &#38; Scribes&#41; of the time of <persName>Christ</persName> did invariably preach up in<lb/> the Synagogues &#38; Temple doctrines conformable to their Text&#45;Book&#44;<lb/> namely the <del>two</del> twenty four books of the Jewish Canon.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I have thus I hope made my assertions good&#44; that our law is a<lb/> perfect model of a moral and religious code&#44; that there is nothing too much<lb/> and nothing too little in it&#44; and in fact&#44; if any man will but examine the<lb/> wonderful effect it has had of keeping a <hi rend="underline">dispersed people united in</hi></p>

				<p>every sense of the word he must acknowledge&#58; &#8220;That no nation though<lb/> ever so great has such just statutes and commandments as those&#44; which<lb/> the Eternal our God has given us.&#8221;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">You&#44; my friend&#44; call upon me&#44; to do the <sic>christians</sic> that justice which<lb/> I demand at <del>of</del> their hands&#59; I am willing to concede all that <sic>christians</sic><lb/> deserve&#44; and I have already acknowledged&#44; and shall always do so&#44; that I<lb/> have been treated very <add>&#63;</add> by them&#44; and shall always&#44; till my dying hour&#44;<lb/> remember the benefits conferred upon me&#44; by some of them.  But while<lb/> I do this I must repeat and reassert it&#44; that the prejudice existing against<lb/> us is highly unjust and even condemned by <del>against</del> that law which you as <sic>christians</sic> are<lb/> bound to respect.  This was the reason why I in the first instance undertook<lb/> the <sic>defence</sic> of our people from the vile and insidious attacks of the Quarterly<lb/> Review&#44; and this now impels me again to answer you&#44; though even here<lb/> I am very willing to admit again the difference which exists between your<lb/> mode of warfare and that of the above mentioned magazine.  Pardon<lb/> me one remark&#44; before I dismiss you altogether&#59; do you know that<lb/> what you profess about universal salvation is no <sic>christian</sic> doctrine&#63;  Do you know<lb/> that it was taught only by the Jewish Rabbins&#63;  And do you know that<lb/> if you believe in the gospel&#44; you must renounce this doctrine as <hi rend="underline">not ortho</hi><lb/>dox&#63;  How<del>ever</del> this may be&#44; I leave you to settle with the <sic>christian</sic><lb/> divines&#59; but only enter my protest against what you say about the voice<lb/> of conscience&#59; for revelation was given to assist us in <hi rend="underline">forming a correct</hi><lb/> course of life&#44; and if conscience could affect that&#44; to what purpose was the<lb/> law then given&#63;  But our opinion is this&#44; our law was given as the standard&#44;<lb/> to which all nations were ultimately to resort <del>to</del> as a rallying point&#44; till<lb/> when&#44; every man <del>was to be saved</del> <hi rend="underline">who is no Israelites</hi>&#44; was to be saved if he<lb/> acted according to the light given him&#44; if <del>they</del> he only observed the precepts<lb/> of general revelation given to <persName>Noah</persName>&#44; which are to be found in the ninth<lb/> chapter of genesis&#44; and it was therefore the practice of the Jews&#44; when ever<lb/> they conquered&#44; to make the subdued nation conform to the &#8220;seven command<lb/>ments of the children of <persName>Noah</persName>&#8221; as they are called in the Talmud.  Each<lb/> son of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; on the contrary is bound to observe all that lies in his power<lb/> to do&#44; as otherwise he is to be punished for good deeds omitted and sins committed.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">It would be a great satisfaction to me&#44; to be assured&#44; that I had effec&#45;<lb/>tually removed the ill&#45;will so many feel towards us&#44; that I had contri&#45;<lb/>buted a little to make <placeName>Isra&#235;l</placeName> more respected in this country&#44; and particular&#45;<lb/>ly in this city.

				<p>with me are bound by the same faith&#59; who with me live in the land of strangers<lb/> far&#44; far&#44; from the sweet hills of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; far&#44; far&#44; from the sacred banks of<lb/> the <placeName>Jordan</placeName>&#44; far&#44; far&#44; from the holy <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>&#44; the city&#44; where God&#39;s glory<lb/> used to dwell&#59; who with me hope to reach a glorious immortality&#44; when<lb/> God will open the graves of his people as promised by <persName>Ezekiel</persName>.  Let<lb/> me call upon them to arouse from their lethargy&#44; to break those<lb/> chains of listlessness by which they are bound.  Let them draw the<lb/> bond of <add>&#63;</add> closer&#44; let them forget the offenses committed to <add>let each man forget the injuries done by his neighbor</add><lb/> one another&#44; and then show the world what <placeName>Isra&#235;l</placeName> can <del>do</del> be even in captivity.<lb/>    Let them show their attachment to that beautiful religion&#44; which<lb/> has ever been the admiration of the world and <del>show</del> prove themselves&#44; by<lb/> conforming strictly to the spirit and letter of the divine law&#44; worthy<lb/> of that glorious <del>hereafter</del> <sic>furturity</sic> for which they are destined by the God of<lb/> nature by the ever kind Father of <placeName>Isra&#235;l</placeName>&#33;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">In conclusion I think it necessary to make an apology<lb/> why I&#44; a young man&#44; who has scarcely reached the age of manhood&#44;<lb/> who moreover <del>is</del> am a foreigner&#44; should step forward&#44; to do that which<lb/> older and wiser men than <del>himself</del> myself have omitted to do.  But I hope&#44; that<lb/> my justification is contained in the following from the 32 ch. of <persName>Job</persName>&#44; which with little alteration<lb/> is well applicable to the present case&#58;</p>
				<quote>&#8220;And <persName>Elihu</persName> the son of <persName>Barachel the Buzite</persName> answered and said&#44; I am young and Ye are<lb/> &#8220;very old&#59; wherefore I was afraid&#44; and dunt<add>&#63;</add> not shew you my opinion.  I<lb/> &#8220;said&#44; Days should speak&#44; and multitude of days should teach wisdom&#44;<lb/> &#8220;But there is a spirit in man&#58; and the inspiration of the Almighty gives them<lb/> &#8220;understanding.  Great men are not always wise&#59; neither do the aged<lb/> &#8220;understand judgment.  Therefore I said&#44; Hearken unto me&#59; I will also show<lb/> &#8220;mine opinion.  Behold I waited for your words&#59; I gave ear to your reasons&#44;<lb/> &#8220;while ye searched out what to say.  Yea&#44; I <sic>attendd</sic> unto you&#44; and behold&#44; there<lb/> &#8220;was none of you that convinced <persName>Job</persName>&#44; or that answered his words&#59; lest ye<lb/> &#8220;should say<del>s</del> We have found out wisdom&#59; God thrusteth him down not<lb/> &#8220;man.  Now he has not directed his words against me&#59; neither will Answer<lb/> &#8220;him with your speeches.  They were amazed&#44; they answered no more&#59; they<lb/> &#8220;left off speaking.  When I had waited&#44; &#40;for they spake not&#44; but stood still and<lb/> &#8220;answered no more&#59;&#41; I said&#44; I will answer also my part I <del>will</del> also will<lb/> &#8220;show my opinion.  For I am full of matter the spirit within me constrai&#45;<lb/> &#8220;neth me.</quote>
				<p>Like <persName>Elihu</persName> I have considered it my duty to speak&#44; because <del>the</del> older<lb/> men did not speak&#44; and was thus in a manner compelled to assume the<lb/> fearful responsibility to accept the challenge which others neglected to do.</p>

				<p>I have&#44; like the holy writer&#44; endeavoured to abuse no man&#44; <del>but</del> neither<lb/> to flatter anyone&#59; but have given as far&#44; as I believe&#44; things their right<lb/> names&#44; without intending to give <sic>offence</sic> to any one&#59; I have tried&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Nothing to extenuate nor <del>to put</del> set down aught in malice&#59; how<lb/> far I have succeeded I leave of hers to judge&#44; but only beg of <del>them</del> all to listen<lb/> to my <sic>defence</sic> with patience&#44; and to read my remarks to the end.  I dare<lb/> not hope&#44; that what I have written could pass the age <add>shall stand the test</add> of severe criticism&#44;<lb/> but I <add>request</add> expect&#44; that every fault may be ascribed <hi rend="underline">to the head but not the heart</hi> of</p>
