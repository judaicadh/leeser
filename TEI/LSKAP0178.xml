				<p>Dear Uncle.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I had intended to write to you yesterday and today&#44; but<lb/> have been so much hurried as to determine me to defer<lb/> it till I could write at some length&#59; but a passage in your<lb/> letter just received stating that <persName>Mr E. P. Cohen</persName> intended being<lb/> here on <date>Thursday</date> compels me to write you at once&#44; although it is<lb/> near ten&#44; and I have just returned home.  The book was as I<lb/> told you&#44; it would be&#44; sent off by <persName>Mr. Barrington</persName> in a parcel<lb/> directed to <persName>Mr. Herman</persName>&#44; who received the first books.  It<lb/> is wrapped up in white printing paper&#44; directed to <persName>Mr E. P.<lb/> Cohen</persName> <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>&#59; do try to get it at once&#44; and hand it over<lb/> to <persName>Mr Cohen</persName>&#44; or else give him another copy&#44; and no<lb/> doubt an opportunity will offer to send off the fine copy at<lb/> some future day.  I trust however that it is safe and sound<lb/> in your place.  If I can I will see <persName>Mr Cohen</persName> at the warf&#44;<lb/> but there is some doubt whether I can be in time.  This<lb/> letter will be in <placeName>Bal.</placeName> tomorrow afternoon&#44; in time to look for<lb/> the book&#44; and I really regret that it should have had so<lb/> unfortunate a time reaching its destination.  Recollect <hi rend="underline">Human</hi><lb/> sent by <persName>Haswell&#44; Barrington &#38; Haswell</persName>.  No doubt it<lb/> can readily be found.&#95;&#95;Of the images book 112 leaves an<lb/> up&#44; and by <date>Thursday</date> I expect to have 130&#44; or thereabouts.&#95;&#95;A gene<lb/>ral feeling of sympathy is expressed for <persName>Mr Cohen</persName>&#59; for the loss<lb/> of his wife&#59; the family seem indeed to have had their troubles lately.<lb/>  What can one say to console them&#63;  let us hope that the Lord of Consola<lb/>tion will send his spirit to comfort them and to uphold them in their<lb/> afflictions.  Amen</p>

				<p><persName>Samuel Etting</persName> is in town&#44; and intends leaving on <date>Wednesday</date> morning with his family<lb/> I thought of sending a letter by him but fearing it would be too late.  I <sic>sentet</sic> these<lb/> few lines&#44; in order to have sent off by the morning&#39;s mail.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I have been in the fashion&#44; and had a cold&#44; but it appears to be wearing away.<lb/>  When are you coming on&#63;  Let it be soon&#44; as many are anxious to see you&#44;<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> of failures in town&#44; some for heavy amounts&#44; one Comely for 3 &#189; mill&#58;<lb/> As young <persName>YehuR</persName>&#44; <persName>Sol. Andrews</persName>&#44; it appears has made a great swindle<lb/> for &#188; Million in <placeName>Mobile</placeName>.  His house&#44; consisting of <add>himself &#38;</add> <persName>Hyman Andrews</persName>&#44; who mar<lb/>ried <persName>Clarissa King</persName>&#44; lately snapped in <placeName>New York</placeName>&#44; and he perhaps thought to<lb/> indemnify himself&#59; he has been caught&#44; &#38; I believe&#44; locked up in <placeName>New<lb/> Orleans</placeName>.  So much for high justice.&#95;&#95;Good news are rather scarce<lb/> here and in <placeName>New York</placeName>&#59; money very dear&#44; even for the best notes two<lb/> to three per cent northern asked&#59; curious indeed.  I hope that the<lb/> <persName>Cohens</persName> will stand it though I fear they will have a hard trip as<lb/> so many private bankers all over the country have failed.  Particularly<lb/> I fear&#44; that <persName>St. John</persName> in <placeName>New York</placeName> owes them much&#44; too much<lb/> for safety.  I see but few people&#44; but yet I believe that I guess right.<lb/>  <persName>Joseph Moss</persName> I told you promised to pay me &#36;200 per annum&#44; payable<lb/> <date>1 May</date> &#38; <date>November</date>&#44; but as he has failed&#44; I shall not present my bill<lb/> now&#44; at least I shall wait&#44; whether he will send me word or not.<lb/>  Even in my little way I stand a chance of losing a little&#44; but as I have<lb/> not built much hope upon his word&#44; I do not think any thing of<lb/> it.  He used to say so much against <persName>David</persName>&#44; and now he has come to the</p>
			<pb n="2R"/>
				<p>same himself.  He has perhaps forgotten&#44; but I have not.<lb/>  Now has the above forgotten&#33;  Retribution&#33;&#95;&#95;You need not mention<lb/> the contents of this to any one&#44; but amt&#59; as I do not wish my<lb/> <hi rend="underline">opinions</hi> to be made more public than necessary.&#95;&#95;</p>
