            <p>Dear Uncle.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I had intended to write to you yesterday and today, but<lb/> have
                been so much hurried as to determine me to defer<lb/> it till I could write at some
                length; but a passage in your<lb/> letter just received stating that <persName>Mr E.
                    P. Cohen</persName> intended being<lb/> here on <date>Thursday</date> compels me
                to write you at once, although it is<lb/> near ten, and I have just returned home.
                The book was as I<lb/> told you, it would be, sent off by <persName>Mr.
                    Barrington</persName> in a parcel<lb/> directed to <persName>Mr.
                    Herman</persName>, who received the first books. It<lb/> is wrapped up in white
                printing paper, directed to <persName>Mr E. P.<lb/> Cohen</persName>
                <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>; do try to get it at once, and hand it over<lb/> to
                    <persName>Mr Cohen</persName>, or else give him another copy, and no<lb/> doubt
                an opportunity will offer to send off the fine copy at<lb/> some future day. I trust
                however that it is safe and sound<lb/> in your place. If I can I will see
                    <persName>Mr Cohen</persName> at the warf,<lb/> but there is some doubt whether
                I can be in time. This<lb/> letter will be in <placeName>Bal.</placeName> tomorrow
                afternoon, in time to look for<lb/> the book, and I really regret that it should
                have had so<lb/> unfortunate a time reaching its destination. Recollect <hi

                    Haswell</persName>. No doubt it<lb/> can readily be found.__Of the images book
                112 leaves an<lb/> up, and by <date>Thursday</date> I expect to have 130, or
                thereabouts.__A gene<lb/>ral feeling of sympathy is expressed for <persName>Mr
                    Cohen</persName>; for the loss<lb/> of his wife; the family seem indeed to have
                had their troubles lately.<lb/> What can one say to console them? let us hope that
                the Lord of Consola<lb/>tion will send his spirit to comfort them and to uphold them
                in their<lb/> afflictions. Amen</p>

                have<lb/> not built much hope upon his word, I do not think any thing of<lb/> it. He
                used to say so much against <persName>David</persName>, and now he has come to
