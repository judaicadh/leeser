			<p rend="align(right)">Ant. &#32; <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>&#44; <date>January 19&#44; 1865</date>.</p>
				<p>Editor of the &#34;Occident&#34;&#44; <placeName><sic>Philadelphai</sic></placeName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">DEAR SIR&#58; There is&#44; perhaps&#44; no country in the world<lb/> where the Hebrew communities are so frequently increased by<lb/> numbers of proselytes&#44; as in this country&#59; and our trans&#45;<lb/><sic>antlantic</sic>  breth<del>e</del>ren must surely&#44; when they learn from the<lb/> different American Jewish periodicals these happy tidings&#44;<lb/> greatly rejoice&#44; and think the time of the advent of the<lb/> Messiah is nigh&#44; truth commences to dawn over the Gentiles&#44;<lb/> and break the long night of ignorance and superstition&#44; and<lb/> fill their hearts&#44; as prophesied&#44; with the fear of God&#44; and<lb/> the true knowledge of His unity&#44; whilst we here are&#44; to our<lb/> deepest regret&#44; convinced that it is not God&#44; but the &#34;altar<lb/> of God&#44;&#34; to which these proselytes are coming.  To find or<lb/> please a husband whom they love&#44; the daughters of the Gentiles<lb/> join our nation&#44; but by no means our religion&#59; and we must not<lb/> deceive ourselves&#44; since we are convinced in our heart that<lb/> it is not the power of truth but the sharp arrows of Cupid to<lb/> which this rapid increase of our nation&#44; by the sons and daugh&#45;<lb/>ters of <placeName>Edom</placeName>&#44; is to be attributed&#59; for&#44; as heedlessly as they<lb/> often run away from the fatherhouse&#44; following the man of their<lb/> choice&#44; without the consent and blessing of their parents&#44; so<lb/> they abandon&#44; yet with much less scruple&#44; their church&#44; kneel&#45;<lb/>ing down at the altar of the Synagogue&#44; where the heedless<lb/> maiden expects to be united to the subject of her love.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Reverend sir&#44; by writing this&#44; I do not intend to blame<lb/> either the proselytes or those who admitted them into the<lb/> covenant of <persName>Abraham</persName>.  &#1514;&#1493;&#1513;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1506; 
				it is now a time&#44; when to be<lb/> silent is the best and wise<del>e</del>st policy&#59; we must see and hear</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">&#45;2&#45;</p>
				<p>much and be silent&#44; we see them every day converting Jews<lb/> into Gentiles&#44; our hearts break <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; but our lips<lb/> are mute and we are silent&#59; why should we not be silent when<lb/> Gentiles are converted into Jews&#63;  I merely intend to con&#45;<lb/>quer the erroneous idea of our people in general&#44; who believe<lb/> that the making of proselytes is one of the most God&#45;pleas&#45;<lb/>ing actions that can be performed&#44; though&#44; in fact&#44; even if<lb/> everything is done in full accordance with the law&#44; it cannot<lb/> be regarded as a <add>Hebrew</add>.  We are permitted by law to admit<lb/> Gentiles into the covenant of <persName>Abraham</persName>&#44; under certain con&#45;<lb/>ditions&#59; this&#44; however&#44; is only a permission <add>Hebrew</add> but not a<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Let me&#44; therefore&#44; exhibit before your readers several<lb/> passages&#44; by which I may show them what the Talmud thinks<lb/> of proselytes in general&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">1. Yebamot<del>h</del>&#44; 109.  Says <persName>Rabbi Yi<del>t</del>z<del>c</del>hak</persName>&#44; <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> Misfortune after misfortune shall befall<lb/> those who admit Gentiles into the covenant of <persName>Abraham</persName>&#59; to<lb/> which Tossephoth remarks&#44; though it seems to be a <add>Hebrew</add> to<lb/> make <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; for&#44; if otherwise&#44; <persName>Jehoshua</persName> would not have con&#45;<lb/>verted <persName>Rahab</persName>&#44; and <persName>Hillel</persName> would not have complied with the<lb/> desire of the two heathens to be converted&#44; still these are<lb/> but exceptional cases.  <persName>Jehoshua</persName> knew from the character of<lb/> <persName>Rahab</persName>&#44; and so knew <persName>Hillel</persName>&#44; that they would one day be strict<lb/> and faithful Jews&#44; <add>Hebrew</add>&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">2.  Kiddushim&#44; 70.  Says <persName>Rabbi <del>Ch</del>Helbo</persName>&#58; Leprosy is not<lb/> so hurtful to the body as proselytes are to the cause of<lb/> Judaism&#44; <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; <persName>Rashi</persName> gives the reason&#8212;<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">3. Niddah&#44; 11.  The proselytes in <placeName>Israel</placeName> prevent the coming</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">&#45;3&#45;</p>
				<p>of the Messiah&#44; <add>Hebrew</add>&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">4. Abodah Zarah&#44; 3.  In the days of <persName>David</persName> and <persName>Solomon</persName> pro&#45;<lb/>selytes were not accepted&#59; no admission into the covenant<lb/> was then granted to Gentiles.  Though we find that in the<lb/> days of <persName>Solomon</persName>&#44; over 150&#44;000 heathens embraced the Jewish<lb/> religion&#44; these&#44; however&#44; says <persName>Rabb<del>o</del>i Yo<del>c</del>hanan</persName>&#44; Yebamo<del>t</del>h 79&#44;<lb/> were but <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; which means&#44; as <persName>Rashi</persName> explains&#44; they<lb/> made themselves Jews&#44; embraced our religion&#44; but were never<lb/> accepted or acknowledged as such by our nation&#44; <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>&#58; A similar case is found in <persName>Esther</persName>&#44; <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> the word <add>Hebrew</add> in the <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> says distinctly they made themselves Jews&#44; but were not<lb/> accepted or acknowledged as such by the nation.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">5. Sanhedrin&#44; 99.  Says <persName>Rabbi Azzay</persName>&#58; <persName>Timnah</persName> was a<lb/> princess&#44; the daughter of a king&#44; desirous to become a Jew&#45;<lb/>ess&#44; she went for that purpose to <persName>Abraham</persName>&#44; <persName>Isaac</persName>&#44; and <persName>Jacob</persName>&#44;<lb/> who all refused &#40;not to convert her but&#41; to admit her into<lb/> the covenant&#44; and <sic>recognise</sic> her as a member of their family&#59;<lb/> she then went and became <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; and said&#58;<lb/> I prefer to be a servant&#45;maid in that nation&#44; than to be a<lb/> princess of any other&#44; <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">From all these different quo<del>a</del>tations&#44; we can suffic<del>e</del>ient&#45;<lb/>ly see that our sages were never in favor of making prosel&#45;<lb/>ytes&#44; and when <persName>Rabbi Eliezer</persName>&#44; Pessachim 78&#44; says <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; he does not mean to say that<lb/> <placeName>Israel</placeName> shall make proselytes&#59; for if so&#44; he had better say <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> or <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; but the word <add>Hebrew</add> refers to the<lb/> preceding word&#44; <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; and the whole idea is but this&#59; <placeName>Israel</placeName></p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">&#45;4&#45;</p>
				<p>was driven from their country to live with the many different<lb/> nations of the earth&#44; only for the great purpose to spread<lb/> the name and unity of God all over the earth&#44; to light the<lb/> light of God wherever there is darkness&#44; and&#44; through us&#44;<lb/> all the nations of the earth shall know that there is but<lb/> one God.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">There is&#44; to my knowledge&#44; but one passage which<lb/> speaks more favorably of the admission of <add>Hebrew</add> to Judaism&#44;<lb/> and this is the <add>Hebrew</add> Section <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; where we read as<lb/> follows&#44; <add>Hebrew</add>&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">What opinion had our sages of proselytes&#63;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">A very unfavorable one&#33;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">6.  Pessachim&#44; 112&#44; we read&#8212;<persName>Rabbi <del>Yehudah</del> Judah Han<del>n</del>as<del>s</del>i</persName><lb/> enjoined upon his children&#44; before he died&#44; that none of his<lb/> family should intermarry with proselytes&#44; <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> &#42;<add>Hebrew</add> In Midrash Yalkut <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; we read&#58; <persName>Rabbi <del>Ch</del>Hiyah</persName> said<lb/> &#34;Do not trust proselytes&#44; have no confidence in their piety&#44;<lb/> neither in that of their children&#44; <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>.  This unfavorable opinion<lb/> we find justified in <date>Sabbath</date>&#44; 33&#44; by <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; the<lb/> son of proselytes&#44; &#40;his father and mother were proselytes&#8212;<lb/><persName><hi rend="underline">Rash<del>y</del>i</hi></persName>&#44;&#41; who denounced <persName>Rabbi Simon ben Yo<del>c</del>ha<del>y</del>i</persName> before the king&#44;<lb/> in consequence of which the latter was compelled to save his<lb/> life by a hasty flight to a cavern&#44; wherein he remained hidden<lb/> twelve years&#59; and when&#44; after the death of the king&#44; he left<lb/> the cavern and met the denunciator <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; he said&#8212;<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>.</p>
				<p>&#42; When <persName>Rabby J.</persName> died&#44; his four sons were already married&#44;<lb/> therefore we translate <add>Hebrew</add> his family.</p>
			<pb n="5"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">&#45;5&#45;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Here I beg leave to remark&#44; that&#44; when we meet the very<lb/> same <add>Hebrew</add> again in the Moed Kat<del>o</del>an&#44; 9&#44; as the name<lb/> of a great man to whom <persName>Rabbi Sim<del>e</del>on ben Yo<del>c</del>ha<del>y</del>i </persName>sends his<lb/> son to request his blessing&#44; it is merely a misprint&#44; and<lb/> instead of <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; it ought to be <add>Hebrew</add>&#44;<lb/> mentioned in Talmud Jerusalem Taanith&#44; sect. 2d&#58; <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> &#40;see Mateh Mosheth&#44;<lb/> who also assumes as most probable that this <add>Hebrew</add> is<lb/> the same <add>Hebrew</add> of Moed Kat<del>o</del>an to whom <persName>Rabbi Sim<del>e</del>on ben<lb/> Yo<del>c</del>ha<del>y</del>i</persName> sent his son to be blessed&#41;.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">From different other places in the Talmud&#44; we learn that<lb/> it was always regarded as an insult to be called &#34;Son of a<lb/> Proselyte&#44;&#34; see Yoma&#44; 71&#44; <add>Hebrew</add>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The rank of proselyte was inferior to that of a <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> or <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; he was next to a freed slave. &#8212; See Mishnah Horayth<lb/> 13&#44; <add>Hebrew</add>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">We find that when <persName>Ezra</persName> found out that many Israelites<lb/> who came up with him from <placeName>Babylon</placeName> to <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> lived with<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; he ordered them to be sent away with their<lb/> children&#44; and so they did.  Why did he give them such a<lb/> cruel command&#44; could they not&#44; as many in similar cases are<lb/> doing now&#44; make their wives Jewesses&#44; or at least let the<lb/> children be circumcised and stay with their fathers&#63;  Surely<lb/> for no other reason than this that <persName>Ezra</persName> did not want to dis&#45;<lb/>grace the nation by making such proselytes and sport with the<lb/> holy Word of God&#44; and make by&#45;ways and side&#45;doors to the<lb/> sacred edifice of our holy religion&#44; that every one may<lb/> smuggle himself in and our whatever he pleases&#44; and thus suit<lb/> every one&#39;s way of thinking&#44; as <persName>Iben Ezra</persName> to <persName>Ezra</persName> vi. explains&#44;</p>
