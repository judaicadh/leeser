				<p rend="align(right)">For the Occident.</p>
				<p><addressee>Rev. Mr. Leeser</addressee>&#59; I read in the <date>October</date> number of the Occident<lb/> an account given by yourself &#38; <persName>Mr. E. Marcussohn</persName> in<lb/> which he makes statements&#44; which utterly &#38; entirely deny<lb/> the fact&#44; that he had left the Jewish faith &#38; united himself<lb/> with&#44; or at least had been amongst Christians&#44; also denying some<lb/> statements made as to his conversion in the <date>August</date> number<lb/> of the Jewish Chronicle&#44; declaring <persName>Rev. Mr. Bonhomme</persName>&#44; and<lb/> several other ministers in <placeName>Montgomery</placeName> as those that had<lb/> spread base falsehoods concerning him.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Now if <persName>Mr Marcussohn&#39;s</persName> account be true&#44; &#38; such<lb/> really is the case&#44; he has suffered severely &#38; suffered inno&#45;<lb/>cently&#44; and nothing rejoices me more than that such<lb/> foul deeds were so openly and deservedly exposed to be<lb/> detested by every virtuous man.  However&#44; there are<lb/> some things that I cannot fully understand&#44; as they<lb/> are &#8220;too high and too deep&#8221; for me&#44; and therefore I wish<lb/> <persName>Mr. Marcussohn</persName>&#44; who certainly is an erudite and an<lb/> honourable man&#44; to explain them for me&#59; we ministers&#44;<lb/> down <placeName>South</placeName> here&#44; are such common &#38; plain folks&#44; that<lb/> we cannot fully comprehend the conduct of <persName>Mr. E.<lb/> Marcussohn</persName>&#44; I would wish him then to explain<lb/> unto me the following circumstances&#58; &#45;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">1stly.  If <persName>Mr. M.</persName> had never left the Jewish faith<lb/> why should he tell me &#38; others&#44; that he had publicly re&#45;<lb/>nounced that faith before the congregation which he<lb/> served as Chazan or Shochet in the city of <placeName>Montgomery<lb/> Ala.</placeName>  2Ndly.  Why should he try to prove his sincerity</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>in having done so&#44; as he stated&#44; by telling me that in so<lb/> doing he lost an excellent annual salary&#44; part of which<lb/> had already been earned by several months service ren&#45;<lb/>dered the Jewish congregation in <placeName>Montgomery</placeName>&#44; &#38; for which<lb/> he did not receive a cent on account of his having left<lb/> the Jewish faith. 3dly Why should he come to me in<lb/> the character of a converted Israelite&#44; staying in my house<lb/> for two weeks&#44; instead of shunning me as a Christian<lb/> minister&#44; and go amongst his Jewish brethren.</p>
				<p>4thly Why also should he have necessity to shave him&#45;<lb/>self in our house&#44; since as a sincere Jew&#44; and withal a<lb/> Jewish Rabbi or Chazan&#44; it was not lawful for him to do<lb/> so&#59; en passant&#59; will you just be so kind <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>&#59; &#38;<lb/> ask him to show you the nice set of shaving appara&#45;<lb/>tus I presented unto him. 5thly Why should he<lb/> want of me a commission to labour as a missionary<lb/> to the Jews&#44; and went with that intention to <placeName>Columbia&#44; S.C.</placeName></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">6thly Why did he ask me&#44; and also make me promise<lb/> to come to <placeName>Columbia</placeName> in a week after he left <placeName>Charleston</placeName>&#44; &#38;<lb/> be present to witness initiation into the Christian<lb/> church by baptism&#44; which I also would have done&#44; had<lb/> not our family been taken sick with the Yellow fever<lb/> about that time&#44; having also been afflicted with the loss<lb/> of a dear mother with that disease. Will you also please<lb/> ask him to let you see the letter of introduction to the<lb/> <persName>Revd E. B. Hart</persName> of <placeName>Columbia</placeName>&#44; which I gave him.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">7thly It was also his misfortune that he should have re&#45;<lb/>ceived some money from me&#44; for which I hold his receipt&#44;<lb/> &#38; which&#44; so he says in his last letter to me from <placeName>Philada.</placeName></p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>dated the <date>12 of Septr 1852</date>&#44; he will refund&#44; besides that which<lb/> the Christian friends in <placeName>Montgomery</placeName> have given him&#44; when<lb/> I know&#44; that&#44; had he never given up his Jewish faith the<lb/> truly benevolent Israelites in <placeName>Charleston</placeName>&#44; who never yet have<lb/> refused a worthy applicant for aid&#44; and who lately were so<lb/> kind to the poor Jews during the past prevailing epidemic&#44;<lb/> would certainly have assisted him in his distress&#59; thus<lb/> saving him the trouble of going amongst Christians for<lb/> pecuniary assistance. 8thly Why also&#44; if <persName>Mr. M.</persName><lb/> had never left that faith&#44; did he beg me in his last letter&#44;<lb/> not to write anything concerning him.  Ah&#33;  I am fearful<lb/> that he knew I might mention some few circumstances&#44; which<lb/> in a slight degree would contradict a few statements made by<lb/> him in the Occident&#44; and thus the faith&#44; as to the truth of<lb/> his statements&#44; which his Jewish brethren would have&#44; might<lb/> slightly be impaired.  9thly  You state&#44; <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>&#59; that <persName>Mr.<lb/> Marcussohn</persName> remarked that his sole reason for going <placeName>North</placeName><lb/> was to contradict the statements made in the Jewish Chronicle<lb/> as to his conversion. Now I would readily believe this&#44; for<lb/> <persName>Mr. M.</persName> is certainly an honourable man&#44; if it were provable<lb/> that an upright man would travel over 1000 miles for this<lb/> sole purpose&#44; spending nearly &#36;100.00 expenses collecting money<lb/> for this sole reason among Christians by false statements&#44; taking a <sic>circuituous</sic><lb/> route&#59; when all might be accomplished by simply publish&#45;<lb/>ing a letter in the Occident&#44; which he might have sent you.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">10thly If that were his sole reason for going <placeName>North</placeName>&#44; then he<lb/> must have had a vision in <placeName>Montgomery</placeName>&#44; that those statements<lb/> would be published in the Jewish Chronicle about conver&#45;<lb/>sion&#44; for his first saw them at my house&#44; when he had</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>already performed nearly one half of his journey to the <placeName>North</placeName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Now I might go on still further in giving you more<lb/> facts&#44; either of which&#44; as either of the others which I have<lb/> given&#44; would confirm the statements made in the Jewish<lb/> Chronicle&#44; viz&#59; that <persName>Mr. E. Marcussohn</persName> did renounce the<lb/> Jewish faith&#59; but these are sufficient to convince any<lb/> candid mind&#59; however of the circumstances connected with<lb/> his conversion&#44; I know nothing&#44; as I do not reside in<lb/> <placeName>Montgomery</placeName>&#44; and was not present at that time&#44; I only give&#44;<lb/> an inquiring public what I do know &#38; no more.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">It may also be alleged&#44; that as <persName>Mr. M</persName> was not baptized<lb/> he did not renounce his faith in Judaism&#44; but that does<lb/> not follow at all&#44; Baptism can only be considered as con&#45;<lb/>firming his former acts &#38; conduct publicly declared by him&#45;<lb/>self baptism alone will make no man a Christian&#59; one<lb/> thing&#44; however&#44; is certain&#44; that <persName>Mr. M.</persName> did renounce the Jewish<lb/> faith&#44; but had not formally accepted of the Christian faith&#59;<lb/> God alone must judge his motives for acting so strangely.<lb/> Upon the whole <persName>Mr. Leeser</persName>&#44; I come to this conclusion&#44;<lb/> that if all Jews&#44; especially converted Jews&#44;  were like <persName>Mr. E.<lb/> Marcussohn</persName>&#44; I would truly believe with you&#44; that there<lb/> would be very little hope of doing any good&#44; in our way of<lb/> thinking&#44; among the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; therefore it follows&#44; that<lb/> we need not regret that he has turned back to the Jews again.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Yours sincerely</p>
			<p rend="indent(3)"><persName role="author">G. S. Bernheim</persName></p>
			<p rend="indent(3)">son of a converted Israelite</p>
			<p rend="indent(3)">who died in the Christian faith</p>
				<p>N. B. If what I have now written<lb/> is not sufficient for <persName>Mr. Marcussohn</persName>&#44; &#38; he wishes to continue<lb/> the controversy&#44; I will in my next give to the public some<lb/> things which he might not relish so well.</p>
