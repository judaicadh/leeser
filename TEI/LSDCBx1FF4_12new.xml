			<p>Rev. and Dear Sir&#33;</p>
	
		  <p rend="indent(1)">In the kind remarks you made in the last number<lb/> of the Occident&#44; relative to my endeavours in establishing<lb/> schools for promoting education among the hebrew children<lb/> in general in this city&#44; you observed&#44; that you were not<lb/> fully informed&#44; as so the details of my plan of working.<lb/>  I with pleasure send you a copy of the second division<lb/> of our constitution of the Union School&#45;[&#63;]&#44; which<lb/> will give you some idea of our plans</p>
			<p>I feel also happy in acquainting you&#44; that our school is in a<lb/> flourishing condition&#44; and everything proceeding as favorably<lb/> as possible in so short a time.  We have at present found<lb/> teachers engaged in the Union School.  At the quarterly enunciation held some time since&#44; the answering of the scholars<lb/> seemed to give general satisfaction&#44; as was e[&#63;] by<lb/> the parents present.  On that occasion we presented the<lb/> children with an appropriate banner&#44; having the following<lb/> inscription [Hebrew] Hebrew&#45;Union&#45;School No 1.  Hoping soon&#44;<lb/> to see a vast improvement in the condition of the rising<lb/> generation of Israelites in this city&#44; I am&#44; as always</p>
