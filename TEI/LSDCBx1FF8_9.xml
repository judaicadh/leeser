                              <p>Dear Sir:</p>
                              <p rend="indent(1)">I am missing your publication of the Occident and
                                        I don't<lb/> know what caused you to stop sending it to
                                        me.</p>
                              <p rend="indent(1)">In an earlier letter I offered you a magnificent
                                        Sepher Torah<lb/> which I had in <placeName>New
                                                  York</placeName> with <persName>Mr.
                                                  Petschan</persName>, to show you that I would<lb/>
                                        like to pay my debt to you for sold and unsold books of
                                        your<lb/> publishing company. I also had in mind to send my
                                        dues for your<lb/> Occident. However, the struggle of a
                                        beginner who is fighting<lb/> for his mere existence, as
                                        well as my insufficient speaking and<lb/> writing knowledge
                                        of the English language prevented me to do so.</p>
                              <p rend="indent(1)">I had moreover the bad fortune to be cheated by
                                                  <persName>Mr. DeYoung</persName><lb/> of
                                                  <placeName>New York</placeName>. I have sold to
                                                  <persName>Mr. DeYoung</persName>, on <date>Rosh
                                                  Ha-Shana, 1850</date>,<lb/> an order of Sefarin
                                        and Tallith, the whole for $70. He gave me<lb/> $10. cash
                                        and a money order for three months for $60. I gave this<lb/>
                                        money order to my printer, <persName>Mr.
                                                  Muhlhauser</persName> in <placeName>New
                                                  York</placeName>, but he could<lb/> not cash it up
                                        to this day. In spite of my very small means and the<lb/>
                                        hardships, and in spite of the fact that <persName>Mr.
                                                  Muhlhauser</persName> did not<lb/> press for his
                                        money, I paid him. I am anxious to fulfill my
                                        obligation<lb/> to you too and I would have done it long ago
                                        if it would have been<lb/> possible without endangering my
                                        young business. Some of your books<lb/> however, are still
                                        unsold and some I have sold to people who have<lb/> not paid
                                        up to now.</p>
