                        >th</hi> February</date>, &amp; I hope<lb/> you will excuse me for not
                writing to you<lb/> ere this, as I have been continually closely<lb/> occupied for
                the last few months.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">In the <date>20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of April</date>, I have sent
                you by letter to <persName>Mr. M. Roggenburger</persName> a Dft. Of 33—,<lb/> which
                I trust you have recd in the full en-<lb/>joyment of health.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">I send you enclosed a statement of<lb/> your a/c, which exhibits
                Balance of 13.42 on<lb/> hand, which I shall endeavor to swell to<lb/> a larger
                amt., &amp; then I'll remit. In the said<lb/> statement you will perceive what is
                for the<lb/> “Occident” &amp; acknowledge the same as usual<lb/> in the “Occ.” I
                have settled with <persName>Haas</persName><lb/> &amp;
                    <persName>Rosenfeld</persName> for $97 to be in <hi rend="underline">full</hi>
                &amp; they<lb/> desire a discontinuance of the subscription<lb/> of the O. that in
                the best I could effect<lb/> with them. <persName>Mr. S. R. Rosenthal</persName>
                also wishes<lb/> to discontinue the “Occid.,” &amp; promised to pay<lb/> son his
                subscription dues. <persName>Mr. Dessau</persName> has<lb/> left the state with his
                family, &amp; I do not see<lb/> any chance how you will ever receive<lb/> one Cent
                from him. I hope you have</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>stopped long since to send him the “Occid.”<lb/>
                <persName>Mr. S. I. Meyer &amp; Co</persName> have only paid $6.00, as<lb/> you'll
                perceive, as they say it were possible<lb/>
                <persName>Mr. A. Jacobs</persName> their partner, residing in <placeName>New<lb/>
                    York</placeName> may have paid their subscription dues<lb/> therefore please let
                me know in relation<lb/> to it. You will otherwise notice, that<lb/> collections are
                made very slowly; people<lb/> here do not like to pay. &amp; in reference<lb/> to
                getting subscriptions to the contemplated<lb/> translations, I have been
                unsuccessful.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Dr. Eckman</persName> has requested me to<lb/> ask you the
