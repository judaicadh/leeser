			<p rend="indent(9)">Dear friend</p>
				<p>I avail myself of the first leisure moment to devote it<lb/> to you  Your long &#38; I may add painful Letter dated<lb/> the <date>4th</date> inst came duly to hand  I say painful for it<lb/> is to me to notice from your remarks that after<lb/> so many years as you have laboured in the Jewish<lb/> Cause our people do not appreciate your worth<lb/> if they do they take a strange way of showing it.  <persName>Mr<lb/> Jonas</persName> sent me a number of plain &#38; Gilt Bibles &#38; I have<lb/> only disposed of one &#40;&#36;2.00&#41;  Your offer to issue a weekly<lb/> paper &#38; not a simple prospect is returned to you.  this<lb/> is under cause for your serious reflection &#38; I sincerely<lb/> trust &#38; hope you will be induced to enter the  Ministry<lb/> again by your friends in <placeName>Phild.</placeName> offering you every inducement<lb/> to do so.  See what time I have had your Books<lb/> on hand &#38; fearing the Dampness of the climate might<lb/> ruin them was the cause of my selling a sett to <persName>Mr<lb/> Kursheedt</persName> for &#36;20.00. but thus far he has failed to pay<lb/> for them.  I want you to write a feeling letter to<lb/> <persName>John M Bach</persName> requesting him to pay his dues<lb/> to the Occident  He is well off &#38; your request<lb/> may have more effect than my frequent solicitation<lb/> tell him your situation burnt out &#38;c &#38; send Bill<lb/> at same time&#44; I should be sorry to see you retire from<lb/> the field of Literature nothing would be more pleasing<lb/> to your Enemies but still with no limited encouragement</p>
			<pb n="1V"/>
				<p>it would with disgust drive 99 our of 100 to the determination not<lb/> to cater any longer for our people.  You must <add>not</add> blame<lb/> all for I know many that would willingly become<lb/> subscribers to your <placeName>New York</placeName> but they are<lb/> so heavily taxed to support our various Institutions<lb/> besides being Members of other associations that<lb/> they &#40;say&#41; cannot afford to increase their expenses<lb/> Its useless to refer back to what is past but I<lb/> cannot refrain from here alluding to the advice I<lb/> gave you some few years since to give your reading<lb/> lighter matter  stories &#8220;to be continued&#8221; &#38;c.  You<lb/> are no longer in the era of years ago &#38; must<lb/> conform to what makes man act contra to his<lb/> sober &#38; better calculations.  Ask your subscription<lb/> List of the Occident on how many of our Sincerely Religious<lb/> Jews it depends on to support the Occident.  Hence<lb/> the necessity of dropping so much Heavy matter<lb/> which I will candidly tell you I never read<lb/> nor do I believe any other Individual in<lb/> this City.  what then is to induce new subscribers<lb/> or to retain the present ones now <persName>Leeser</persName> this I<lb/> tell you.  The Advocate <hi rend="underline">must appear</hi> &#38; take<lb/> my advice unless you intend to Drop the Co<add>&#63;</add>nomer<lb/> of Editor.  You must drop the Occident<lb/> &#38; in its stead send the Advocate to every<lb/> Subscriber start not at my proposition<lb/> your Enemies can yet be outflanked if you will<lb/> go to work right give us the Advocate &#38;<lb/> in it if possible a sheet in the German<lb/> Language &#38; I will stake my Existence on<lb/> your Subscription list soon <sic>equalling</sic> your best</p>

				<p>should you conclude to publish the Advocate I wish<lb/> to send you a list of many in the Country&#8212;to send<lb/> the first number to&#44; I have read the two first numbers<lb/> of the Voice of Israel published by <persName>Revd Mr Bien<add>&#63;</add></persName> &#38;<lb/> <persName>Henr Labatt</persName> at <placeName>San Francisco</placeName>.  Have you hear<lb/> favoured with the same.  Since you first started a Jewish<lb/> Periodical how many has allowed&#59; Our Home for<lb/> Jewish Widows &#38; Orphans is steadily increasing in its<lb/> number of Inmates &#38; if they increase so <sic>rappidly</sic><lb/> in a short period additional Buildings will be<lb/> required.  I presume the Anniversary will be<lb/> the <date>8th January&#47;57</date> being the day of its Dedication<lb/> We give no Dinner but with an oration &#40;I presume<lb/> <persName>Gerthom<add>&#63;</add></persName>&#41; &#38; a light repast shall pass the day with<lb/> the Widows and Orphans&#44;.  I have no other news to write<lb/> &#8220;local&#8221; I feel proud of the Board Elected<lb/> by the <sic>Pourtugese</sic> Congregation.  <persName>Mr Jonas</persName><lb/> attending the school &#38; no doubt with the other<lb/> officers will do all they can for the Interest<lb/> of the Institution to show you how they appreciate<lb/> <persName>Gutheim<add>&#63;</add></persName>.  The Congregation have just increased<lb/> my Salary from &#36;2000 to &#36;2400 a year with<lb/> the Letter informing him of this fact the same time<lb/> a Letter of approval of his Course during the<lb/> period they have had him with them the letter<lb/> concludes &#8220;Wishing you Recd. In long life &#38;<lb/> Happiness I am further instructed to inform<lb/> you that the Board of Officers are instructed<lb/> to furnish you with what means you may<lb/> require to furnish your House now completed<lb/> &#38; ready for your occupancy  Signed</p>

				<p>I may not give you the exact words for the substance<lb/> as I hurried to read over them.  I need not tell you<lb/> our worthy friend <persName>Gutheim</persName> is highly pleased &#38; deservedly<lb/> so&#59; for he is a fine young man &#38; we all love<lb/> him.  The <persName>Rev Mr Seine</persName> is a candidate for<lb/> Reelection but I shall not vote for him<lb/> He is not the man I like for a Minister<lb/> If <persName>Mr a Block</persName> wishes a copy of <persName>Dias&#39;s</persName><lb/> Letters He knows where I am &#38; so excuse<lb/> me I will not send it to Him<lb/> I cannot &#38; will not humour <sic>there</sic> <sic>pople</sic><lb/> &#40;you mean <persName>Mr a Block</persName> in this city do you not&#41;&#8212;<lb/> well I must close my time is so occupied<lb/> as to prevent my writing to any but yourself<lb/> in private matters so excuse my hurried<lb/> scrawl.  <sic>Beleive</sic> me <persName>Leeser</persName> your<lb/> ever devoted friend</p>
