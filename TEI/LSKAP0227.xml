            <p>I avail myself of the first leisure moment to devote it<lb/> to you Your long &amp; I
                may add painful Letter dated<lb/> the <date>4th</date> inst came duly to hand I say
                painful for it<lb/> is to me to notice from your remarks that after<lb/> so many
                years as you have laboured in the Jewish<lb/> Cause our people do not appreciate
                your worth<lb/> if they do they take a strange way of showing it. <persName>Mr<lb/>
                    Jonas</persName> sent me a number of plain &amp; Gilt Bibles &amp; I have<lb/>
                only disposed of one ($2.00) Your offer to issue a weekly<lb/> paper &amp; not a
                simple prospect is returned to you. this<lb/> is under cause for your serious
                reflection &amp; I sincerely<lb/> trust &amp; hope you will be induced to enter the
                Ministry<lb/> again by your friends in <placeName>Phild.</placeName> offering you
                every inducement<lb/> to do so. See what time I have had your Books<lb/> on hand
                &amp; fearing the Dampness of the climate might<lb/> ruin them was the cause of my
                selling a sett to <persName>Mr<lb/> Kursheedt</persName> for $20.00. but thus far he
                has failed to pay<lb/> for them. I want you to write a feeling letter to<lb/>
                <persName>John M Bach</persName> requesting him to pay his dues<lb/> to the Occident
                He is well off &amp; your request<lb/> may have more effect than my frequent
                solicitation<lb/> tell him your situation burnt out &amp;c &amp; send Bill<lb/> at
                same time, I should be sorry to see you retire from<lb/> the field of Literature
                nothing would be more pleasing<lb/> to your Enemies but still with no limited
                encouragement</p>
            <pb n="1V"/>
            <p>it would with disgust drive 99 our of 100 to the determination not<lb/> to cater any
                longer for our people. You must <add>not</add> blame<lb/> all for I know many that
                would willingly become<lb/> subscribers to your <placeName>New York</placeName> but
                they are<lb/> so heavily taxed to support our various Institutions<lb/> besides
                being Members of other associations that<lb/> they (say) cannot afford to increase
                their expenses<lb/> Its useless to refer back to what is past but I<lb/> cannot
                refrain from here alluding to the advice I<lb/> gave you some few years since to
                give your reading<lb/> lighter matter stories “to be continued” &amp;c. You<lb/> are
                no longer in the era of years ago &amp; must<lb/> conform to what makes man act
                contra to his<lb/> sober &amp; better calculations. Ask your subscription<lb/> List
                of the Occident on how many of our Sincerely Religious<lb/> Jews it depends on to
                support the Occident. Hence<lb/> the necessity of dropping so much Heavy matter<lb/>
                which I will candidly tell you I never read<lb/> nor do I believe any other
                Individual in<lb/> this City. what then is to induce new subscribers<lb/> or to
                retain the present ones now <persName>Leeser</persName> this I<lb/> tell you. The
                Advocate <hi rend="underline">must appear</hi> &amp; take<lb/> my advice unless you
                intend to Drop the Co<add>?</add>nomer<lb/> of Editor. You must drop the
