			<p rend="indent(2)">Rev. Sir&#33;</p>
			<p rend="indent(3)">A few weeks after we were delighted<lb/> with <persName>Dr. Cohns</persName> <hi rend="underline">maiden sermon</hi>&#44; he gave us his <hi rend="underline">woman Sermon</hi>&#44; taken<lb/> as his text from <add>Hebrew</add> and proving therefrom&#44; that.<lb/> man woman&#44; girls &#38;c &#38;c are not only <del>bound</del> allowed to unite and hear the word<lb/> of God&#44; yet they are bound according this text&#44; to do so.  He <sic>complaint</sic><lb/> of our religion as having for such a length of time <sic>excludet</sic> woman from<lb/> so many privileges&#44; to which they are <sic>rightously</sic> entitled&#44; but that the time<lb/> has come when we remedy such an evil&#44; in short he <sic>exaltet</sic> the ladies<lb/> to such a degree&#44; he spoke so much of their greatness&#44; that the congrega<lb/>tion did not think themselves to be in a Synagogue&#44; but in the heaven amongst<lb/> <hi rend="underline">angels</hi>&#44; even the ladies were taken by surprise&#44; as they never were aware<lb/> before of their being so very great.  The <add>Hebrew</add> had set in fairly&#44; Ladies &#38;<lb/> gentlemen <sic>appeart</sic> <hi rend="underline">together</hi> like in a theater&#44; yet it works well as the peop<lb/>le here&#44; are enlightened enough to know&#44; how to behave in the house of<lb/> God&#44; even before <persName>Dr. Kohn</persName> was here.  The Dr. preached a <sic>splendit</sic> sermon<lb/> on the first day of <add>Hebrew</add> in German&#44; reminding the Cong. for the sake of<lb/> our holy religion&#44; to keep the <date><sic>Sabath</sic></date>&#8212;which had till the present day<lb/> no effect&#8212;&#44; than he implored the blessings of heaven for all and every<lb/> one&#44; here and anywhere else&#44; the orthodox even not excepted.  He did not<lb/> forget the death&#44; and every one was moved to tears&#44; as the Dr. has got a<lb/> great talent to press them out&#44; of the most stony heart&#8212;the second<lb/> day he preached in <del>German</del> english&#44; also&#44; first rate.  The <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> were all read&#8212;the <add>Hebrew</add> of the first day was read by the Dr.&#41;&#8212;bit in<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> the <add>Hebrew</add> were omitted and the Cong. Were taken by sur<lb/>prise&#44; as they could not pray the <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; as the <add>Hebrew</add> com<lb/>menced <add>Hebrew</add> and right off Shemona esra bekol&#8212;.  The synagogue<lb/> was <sic>crowdet</sic>&#44; and the service a splendid one&#44; the Haphthora<lb/> on the first day was read by the Dr. in German&#44; on the second day<lb/> by some person else in hebrew.  <date>Yom Kipur</date> we were delighted with<lb/> 3 sermons all listened at with great awe&#44; the service was conducted<lb/> like heretofore&#44; and the day passed away <sic>delightfult</sic>&#44; and to the<lb/> satisfaction of all.  Luckas<add>&#63;</add> passed away very pleasantly&#44; the Dr</p>
			<pb n="1V"/>
				<p>preached on the first day&#44; explaining the <sic>comandment</sic> of the feast and<lb/> of the <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; although there is but one <add>Hebrew</add> in the Congregation&#44;<lb/> &#38; <hi rend="underline">one <add>Hebrew</add></hi> in the Yard of the Synagogue&#44; that&#39;ll do for all&#8212;on<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; also <hi rend="underline"><add>Hebrew</add></hi>&#44; there was even no <add>Hebrew</add> in the Synagogue Ema<lb/>nuel&#44; as the Dr. Rabbi did not attend even himself&#44; but in the former<lb/> years&#44; there were these days well <sic>attented</sic> service&#44; however now&#44; as<lb/> the Rabbi does not attend his followers will do the same.&#8212;On <date>Sun<lb/>day</date> the <add>Hebrew</add> inst. The yearly meeting of the Cong. Em. took place&#44; also<lb/> the election of officers as much as I understand&#44; it passed of very<lb/> quiet&#44;  <persName>Mr H Seligman</persName> was reelected President&#44; and indeed he de<lb/>serves reelection&#44; as he is a perfect Gentleman&#44; doing Justice to all pastors&#44;<lb/> <persName>Mr Sachs</persName> vicpres. Reelected&#44; the other officers I do not know&#44; who was<lb/> elected.  A Resolution&#44; <hi rend="underline"><sic>extenting</sic></hi> the Term of Office as Rabbi of the Cong from 3 to 5 years&#44; passed unanimously&#44; as such was provided<lb/> to the Dr. prior to his arrival here.  A communication from the <persName>Dr<lb/> K.</persName> changing the reading of the Thora from one year to three years was<lb/> read&#44; a warm debate ensued&#44; and after the same was adopted by the<lb/> majority of <hi rend="underline">one</hi>&#44; it was further agreed upon that a <sic>Comittee</sic> of 5<lb/> be appointed&#44; to converse with the Dr. whether it was not a great wrong<lb/> to adopt such a change&#44; and if the Rabbi succeeds in considering the<lb/> same&#44; to the contrary&#44; in the 3 years Cyclus<add>&#63;</add> can <add>Hebrew</add>.  One of<lb/> the Com. <sic>refered</sic> the Rabbi to the <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; which the latter rejects as<lb/> being in <del>any</del> no way his authority&#44; he does not <sic>aknowledge</sic> the <add>Hebrew</add> con<lb/>sequently the Dr showed that some 700 years ago&#44; it was customary<lb/> to read the Thora <hi rend="underline">through</hi> once in three years&#44; and so it is&#44; or will<lb/> be established to the notion of the Dr <add>Hebrew</add> he spoke in his sermon<lb/> about the matter&#44; but could not satisfy those who are opposed to it&#44; he<lb/> urged also the speedy adoption of the new <add>Hebrew</add> &#40;<persName>Herzbachers</persName>&#41; <del>but</del> not<lb/>withstanding&#44; there are only <hi rend="underline">two</hi> of them here and none to be had in <placeName>N. Y.</placeName><lb/> is that not strange&#44; that of so great an <sic>artikel</sic>&#44; only <del>li</del> a limited amount<lb/> was printed.&#8212;Well I suppose the Cong. Em. Did not dream that there<lb/> ever another Cong. will be foolish enough to adopt the same&#8212;and see<lb/> Cong. Em. in the next&#8212;.  The Dr. spoke also in his service again of the<lb/> necessity&#44; of abolishing <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; we do not intend to go to <add>Hebrew</add> to bring<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> said he&#44; for us there is no <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; we live happy here&#44; and enjoy<lb/> all privileges we wish to enjoy&#44; we wish not to bend for a jewish King.<lb/>  I think the Dr is right&#44; because in <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; he could not get &#36;3000 a year</p>

				<p>nor would he get a house furnished so fine and gratis like here&#44; besides<lb/> a couple a hundred Dollars&#44; <add>Hebrew</add> gift.&#8212;<add>Hebrew</add> and <add>Hebrew</add> are two ob<lb/>jects which are despised in the heart of the Dr. he would not say <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> in <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; <add>Hebrew</add> not <add>Hebrew</add>&#95;&#95;but Sir there<lb/> are thank God&#44; a good many in the Cong. Em. Who think quite otherwise<lb/> and although in the minority&#44; yet they will live and die for their religious<lb/> principle&#44; as already steps have been taken&#44; to establish a new <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; which<lb/> will and must be done ere long&#44; and beyond doubt with success&#8212;<lb/> One thing is strange&#44; the Dr says there are no more <add>Hebrew</add> in the present<lb/> time as he goes into <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; yet he performed a sample<add>&#63;</add> of week&#44;<lb/> ago the ceremony of <add>Hebrew</add> what inconsistency&#33;&#8212;One thing is to<lb/> be regretted&#44; that is&#44; the Cong. Em. Has since its existence some 8 or 9 years<lb/> lived in most astonishing peace and <sic>harmonie</sic>&#44; which fact is shown by<lb/> its prosperity&#44; they have <sic>expendet</sic> for a Synagogue over 35000 Doll&#44; for a<lb/> new grave yard on 20000 Doll. <del>and</del> she is out of debts and has on 230<lb/> members&#44; and now one man has by his actions&#44; created <sic>disharmonie</sic>&#44; <sic>quarells</sic><lb/> and private difficulties&#44; between its members&#44; between former friends&#44; men<lb/> of long standing intimacy&#44; are now enemies&#44; because they think now diffe<lb/>rently on religious question <add>Hebrew</add>.  One more fact worth of notice<lb/> is&#44; that when the Board of Officers on the new burial ground met&#44; to make<lb/> laws for the government of the same&#44; the question rose&#44; who is entitled to be<lb/> buried in a jewish graveyard&#44; whether children of jewish parents not cir<lb/>cumcised&#44; are <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; the Dr. was consulted&#44; and he said&#44; that children of je<lb/>wish parents even if not circumcised are <add>Hebrew</add>&#8212;<add>Hebrew</add>&#8212;<lb/>  However&#44; there are but two such instances known in this city&#44; where parent do<lb/> not circumcise.  There were besides the next regular synagogue <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> on the <add>Hebrew</add> some four more meetings of worship well <sic>attende</sic>&#44; the <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add> was <sic>crowdet</sic> and well conducted&#44; and it made me feel well to<lb/> hear the prayers chanting in the old established usage and see the greatest or<lb/>der and devotion prevail&#59; their minister <persName>Dr. Henry</persName>&#44; a pious and learned Ger<lb/>man&#44; preached a most impressive sermon on the first day of <add>Hebrew</add>.  The Congre<lb/>gation is in a flourishing condition&#44; counts some 80 members&#44; and they have purchased a piece of ground to erect a <add>Hebrew</add> for themselves for<lb/> which purpose more than 1500 Doll. Were donated on <add>Hebrew</add>.  Their the <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; some 30 members their service was recording their rite&#44; it was well<lb/> <sic>attented</sic>&#44; so were the balance&#44; all of which I paid a flying visit<add>&#63;</add>.  <persName>Dr. Eck<lb/>man</persName> had a service for the children only&#44; which  he called <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; it was<lb/> well adapted for his purpose&#44; and the children showed much improvement<lb/> in hebrew reading and prayers&#8212;The Israelites are <sic>rapitly</sic> increasing<lb/> all over the state&#44; every where is the feeling for our cause alive&#44; in <placeName>Sacra<lb/>mento</placeName>&#44; <placeName>Stockton</placeName>&#44; <placeName>Marysville</placeName>&#44; <placeName>Nevada</placeName>&#44; <placeName>Grass Valley</placeName> &#38;c &#38; every where they kept</p>
