				<p rend="align(right)"><placeName>Montreal</placeName> <date>21st March 1864</date>.</p>
				<p>My dear Sir&#8212;</p>
			<p rend="indent(2)">It is long since I have had this pleasure&#59;<lb/> but during the whole of the past winter which has been a<lb/> very sickly one no doubt in consequence of its extraordinary<lb/> mildness&#8212;I have scarcely found time to write home.  Correspondence<lb/> is a luxury in which I cannot often indulge&#44; especially as my<lb/> duties increase in college&#44; as do also my literary calls.  In<lb/> <date>November</date> last you wrote me &#8220; I presume you have no time for<lb/> anything but your own work&#44; or else your fathers memoir<lb/> ought to have been finished long since. &#8221; You were right in<lb/> your first supposition&#8212;the memoir &#40;or nearly all&#41; had been<lb/> long finished and sent to <placeName>England</placeName> to my family there for<lb/> perusal&#8212;I had to delay till I got materials very few of<lb/> which however I did not possess before my visit to <placeName>England</placeName><lb/> three years since.  They wished to publish it in pamphlet form<lb/> and distribute it to the congregation &#40;K. K. Shaar Ashmaim<add>&#63;</add>&#41; on<lb/> consideration however we decided not to do so&#44; and the M.S.<add>&#63;</add> <lb/> remained in <placeName>London</placeName> at my request until I had an opportunity<lb/> to bring it out.  <persName>Mr W. Benjamin</persName> has recently returned from<lb/> <placeName>England</placeName> &#38; brought it with him&#44; having no copy I did not wish<lb/> to trust the mail.  As you were the first to express a desire<lb/> to obtain full particulars of my late revered and gifted parents<lb/> career I send it now to you&#44; although perhaps a <placeName>London</placeName><lb/> periodical&#44; would be the more appropriate vehicle for<lb/> publication.  Of this you may be assured no one in <placeName>England</placeName><lb/> &#40;not even <persName>Beuisch</persName> with whom I am intimate&#41; except my own<lb/> family has seen it&#44; and no one in <placeName>America</placeName>&#44; except the <persName>Joseph&#39;s</persName><lb/> family here.  It was <persName>Mrs J. H. J.</persName> who said it ought to be<lb/> printed.  I will leave it to you to decide whether you think<lb/> it of sufficient general interest for your new volume.  <persName>Mr<lb/> Abraham Joseph</persName> goes to <placeName><sic>new</sic> York</placeName> tomorrow and takes it<lb/> with him.  He will probably send it on by mail to <placeName>Philada</placeName></p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>I risk only about half what I have written of the Biography<lb/> awaiting another opportunity for the balance&#44; I should say<lb/> the whole will make about 45 or 50 pages of M.S such as I send.  If<lb/> these the last ten pages are not yet written&#44; but of course would<lb/> be ready should you publish them.  Should you not do so&#44; please<lb/> do not return the M. S. by mail&#44; I prefer another opportunity&#44; again<lb/> even should you print&#44; I must ask you to <add>&#63;</add> the copy for me.<lb/>  I will leave it to you to decide whether my name should be<lb/> attached to it.  Please let me hear what you think of this<lb/> before you print.  I would like while the type stands to have<lb/> 150 or 200 copies taken for a pamphlet&#8212;same as my &#8220;<sic>Sanatory</sic><lb/> institutions&#8221; was done.  Permit me to explain how this was.<lb/>  The articles were published in a monthly like yours&#8212;enough<lb/> was set up for a sheet or half sheet I forget which<lb/> printed off for pamphlet&#44; and served for two months supply<lb/> to the magazine.  I need not say that I of course expect to<lb/> &#8220;pay the difference.&#8221;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Mr Abraham Joseph</persName> wants<lb/> two of your 12 mo Bibles&#8212;the ordinary calf binding I presume<lb/> Please send them &#40;or if you like to <add>&#63;</add> the sale with a<lb/> couple more&#41; to the following address <persName>A. Joseph Esq</persName> care<lb/> <persName>Titus Smythe &#38; Co.</persName> <placeName>151 Front St New York</placeName> upon whom<lb/> &#40;i.e. <persName>Messrs Smythe</persName>&#41; you can draw at sight for the amount<lb/> of his two copies.  This leads me to advise you to<lb/> address <persName>S. Benjamin</persName> &#40;<persName>Messrs Benjamin Bros</persName> <placeName>Manchester</placeName>&#41;<lb/> for the amount of his indebtedness to you.  You are aware<lb/> that I applied to them when here&#44; but without success.<lb/>  <persName>Mrs John Levey</persName> is going to <placeName>New York</placeName> to open a Boarding<lb/> House might also pay and <add>Hebrew</add> if you would write<lb/> a line to <persName>Rev S. M. Isaacs</persName>&#44; she would no doubt pay<lb/> him if instructed to do so by you.  Apropos des bottes<lb/> <persName>Rev S. M. I</persName> is <sic>immortalising</sic> Jewish orthodox ministers<lb/> in his &#8220;Diary&#8221; in a manner&#44; for which it seems to me</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>we ought to be duly thankful.  <persName>Punch</persName><add>&#63;</add> would not do it better<lb/> whether the character such as he forms is no better than it<lb/> should be&#44; whether it would bear close analysis as far as<lb/> moral principles&#44; correct motives of actions are concerned&#44;<lb/> <sic>cest</sic> une autre chose.  I fancy that you&#44; not more than I would<lb/> like to wear the cap so becoming to &#8220;a cunning <persName>Isaac</persName>&#8221; if not<lb/> to a sincere good man and a Jew.  At all events my &#8220;leaves from the<lb/> life of a Jewish Minister&#8221; cannot be much more <add>&#63;</add>&#44; so I am doubly encouraged to send them</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><persName>Mrs Davis</persName> and her son seem temporarily<lb/> fixed here&#44; whether permanently so we shall see.  Young<lb/> <persName>Mr Nathan</persName> whom you introduced to us at the commencement<lb/> of the winter&#44; and who spent a few evenings with us&#44; suddenly<lb/> disappeared&#8212;whither I know not&#8212;Has he turned up in<lb/> your part of the world.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">I have lately been dragged into a new<lb/> Literary <sic>organisation</sic>.  They have passed me the complement of<lb/> electing me president&#59; but I <sic>dont</sic> think I shall accept of the<lb/> office.  I met at a social party by invitation &#38; by his<lb/> wish&#44; the <persName>Bishop</persName> of <placeName>New Jersey</placeName>.  He says he knows you<lb/> and <persName>Dr Raphall</persName>.  He also knew my uncle <persName>David Meldola</persName>.<lb/>  He is a very jolly fellow&#44; and we took champagne&#8212;something<lb/> in which you never&#44; I very seldom indulge&#8212;together&#59;<lb/> you will say I have been keeping <date>Purim</date> before its time.<lb/>  Well I will at least wish you a merry one&#44; and<lb/> conclude&#8212;if not my toast&#8212;my letter with wishing<lb/> you many happy returns <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; and with<lb/> my wife&#39;s united kind regards</p>

				<p rend="align(center)">Council of the <placeName>Montreal</placeName> Natural History Society&#44;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The Council of the Natural History Society of <placeName>Montreal</placeName> have still to deplore the very defective<lb/> state of their collection of mammals.  The recent large increase of the working members of the society&#44; its improved<lb/> status at home and reputation abroad&#44; and the removal of the Society to their present commodious building&#44; all<lb/> demand that this collection should attain the same completeness as that of the Canadian birds&#44; now in the Museum&#44;<lb/> and become equally useful for reference.  The Council would therefore respectfully represent to Naturalists&#44; Sports&#45;<lb/>men and others&#44; that they could much advance the desired object by sending their specimens to the Society for pre&#45;<lb/>servation&#59; and to those kindred Societies who might also feel disposed to co&#45;operate&#44; the duplicate specimens of<lb/> minerals&#44; fossils&#44; and birds&#44; both American and foreign&#44; now in possession of the Society&#44; would readily be made<lb/> available where wanted.  In publishing the subjoined list of quadrupeds chiefly wanted&#44; the Council desire to solicit<lb/> the aid of the public generally to supply them&#44; convinced that their efforts to foster and advance the special branch<lb/> of science to which they devote themselves&#44; will be appreciated.</p>
