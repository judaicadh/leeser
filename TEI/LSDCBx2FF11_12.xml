            <p>My dear Sir—</p>
            <p rend="indent(2)">It is long since I have had this pleasure;<lb/> but during the whole
                of the past winter which has been a<lb/> very sickly one no doubt in consequence of
                its extraordinary<lb/> mildness—I have scarcely found time to write home.
                Correspondence<lb/> is a luxury in which I cannot often indulge, especially as
                my<lb/> duties increase in college, as do also my literary calls. In<lb/>
                <date>November</date> last you wrote me “ I presume you have no time for<lb/>
                anything but your own work, or else your fathers memoir<lb/> ought to have been
                finished long since. ” You were right in<lb/> your first supposition—the memoir (or
                nearly all) had been<lb/> long finished and sent to <placeName>England</placeName>
                to my family there for<lb/> perusal—I had to delay till I got materials very few
                of<lb/> which however I did not possess before my visit to
                    <placeName>England</placeName><lb/> three years since. They wished to publish it
                in pamphlet form<lb/> and distribute it to the congregation (K. K. Shaar
                    Ashmaim<add>?</add>) on<lb/> consideration however we decided not to do so, and
                the M.S.<add>?</add>
                <lb/> remained in <placeName>London</placeName> at my request until I had an
                opportunity<lb/> to bring it out. <persName>Mr W. Benjamin</persName> has recently
                returned from<lb/>
                <placeName>England</placeName> &amp; brought it with him, having no copy I did not
                wish<lb/> to trust the mail. As you were the first to express a desire<lb/> to
                obtain full particulars of my late revered and gifted parents<lb/> career I send it
                now to you, although perhaps a <placeName>London</placeName><lb/> periodical, would
                be the more appropriate vehicle for<lb/> publication. Of this you may be assured no
                one in <placeName>England</placeName><lb/> (not even <persName>Beuisch</persName>
                with whom I am intimate) except my own<lb/> family has seen it, and no one in
                    <placeName>America</placeName>, except the <persName>Joseph's</persName><lb/>
                family here. It was <persName>Mrs J. H. J.</persName> who said it ought to be<lb/>
                printed. I will leave it to you to decide whether you think<lb/> it of sufficient
                general interest for your new volume. <persName>Mr<lb/> Abraham Joseph</persName>
                goes to <placeName><sic>new</sic> York</placeName> tomorrow and takes it<lb/> with
                him. He will probably send it on by mail to <placeName>Philada</placeName></p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>I risk only about half what I have written of the Biography<lb/> awaiting another
                opportunity for the balance, I should say<lb/> the whole will make about 45 or 50
                pages of M.S such as I send. If<lb/> these the last ten pages are not yet written,
                but of course would<lb/> be ready should you publish them. Should you not do so,
                please<lb/> do not return the M. S. by mail, I prefer another opportunity,
                again<lb/> even should you print, I must ask you to <add>?</add> the copy for
                me.<lb/> I will leave it to you to decide whether my name should be<lb/> attached to
                it. Please let me hear what you think of this<lb/> before you print. I would like
                while the type stands to have<lb/> 150 or 200 copies taken for a pamphlet—same as my
                    “<sic>Sanatory</sic><lb/> institutions” was done. Permit me to explain how this
                was.<lb/> The articles were published in a monthly like yours—enough<lb/> was set up
                for a sheet or half sheet I forget which<lb/> printed off for pamphlet, and served

            <p rend="indent(1)">The Council of the Natural History Society of
                    <placeName>Montreal</placeName> have still to deplore the very defective<lb/>
                state of their collection of mammals. The recent large increase of the working
                members of the society, its improved<lb/> status at home and reputation abroad, and
                the removal of the Society to their present commodious building, all<lb/> demand
                that this collection should attain the same completeness as that of the Canadian
                birds, now in the Museum,<lb/> and become equally useful for reference. The Council
                would therefore respectfully represent to Naturalists, Sports-<lb/>men and others,
                that they could much advance the desired object by sending their specimens to the
                Society for pre-<lb/>servation; and to those kindred Societies who might also feel
                disposed to co-operate, the duplicate specimens of<lb/> minerals, fossils, and
                birds, both American and foreign, now in possession of the Society, would readily be
                made<lb/> available where wanted. In publishing the subjoined list of quadrupeds
                chiefly wanted, the Council desire to solicit<lb/> the aid of the public generally
                to supply them, convinced that their efforts to foster and advance the special
                branch<lb/> of science to which they devote themselves, will be appreciated.</p>
