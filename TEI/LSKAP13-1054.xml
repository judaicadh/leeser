				<p rend="align(center)">From the Occident for <date>October&#44; 1857</date>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">ANOTHER house devoted to the service of the God of <placeName>Israel</placeName> was dedi&#45;<lb/>cated in our city on <date>Thursday the 14th of Elul &#40;the 3d of September&#41;</date>&#44;<lb/> and a new congregation was thus instituted to take its rank and respon&#45;<lb/>sibility among the communities established to uphold the law which is<lb/> the heritage of <persName>Jacob&#39;s </persName>sons.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">We announced in our last that it was intended to open the new Syna&#45;<lb/>gogue&#44; bearing the name of Beth&#45;El&#45;Emeth&#44; and situated in <placeName>Franklin<lb/> Street&#44; Philadelphia</placeName>&#44; on the above day&#59; and we are truly happy to state<lb/> that nothing interfered with the execution of the plan.  About half past<lb/> four the people began to assemble&#59; and the weather being beautiful&#44;<lb/> allowed persons of all ages to venture forth to take part in the solemni&#45;<lb/>ties of the occasion&#59; and it was pleasing to see with what apparent cor&#45;<lb/>diality the ministers and presidents of the other congregations&#44; all being<lb/> represented except one&#44; joined us that day.  We noticed the <persName>Reverend<lb/> Isidor Frankel</persName>&#44; and <persName>Messrs. Joseph Einstein</persName> and <persName>Jacob Mayer</persName> President<lb/> and Vice President of Rodef Sholem&#59; <persName role="author">Reverend Solomon Jacobs</persName>&#44;<lb/> and <persName>Mr. Harris Coleman</persName> President of the Beth Israel&#59; <persName>Reverend L.<lb/> Naumburg</persName>&#44; and <persName>Mr. Adolph Klopfer</persName> President of the Kenesseth Israel&#59;<lb/> and the <persName>Reverend S. C. Noot</persName>&#44; and <persName>Mr. Henry De Boer</persName> President of the<lb/> Bnai Israel Synagogues&#44; besides many members of the respective con&#45;<lb/>gregations&#44; including the Mikve Israel&#44; the oldest in the city&#44; as also a<lb/> large number of non&#45;Israelites.  Although it was hoped that the service<lb/> would commence at five P. M. precisely&#44; some little delay took place<lb/> owing to the late arrival of many persons&#59; but at about 20 minutes past<lb/> that hour an overture&#44; solemn and appropriate&#44; was commenced by the</p>
				<p>1</p>

				<p>band&#44; led by <persName>Mr. A. Scherzer</persName>&#44; an Israelite well known for his skill in<lb/> the tuneful art&#59; and while this was being executed the Minister fol&#45;<lb/>lowed by six members of the congregation&#44; each bearing a <hi rend="italics">Sepher To</hi>&#45;<lb/><hi rend="italics">rah</hi>&#44; approached the right entrance door of the main hall.  When the<lb/> music ceased the customary knocks were given to ask admittance within<lb/> the precincts of the sanctuary&#44; and the usual verse&#44; &#34;Open for me the gates<lb/> of righteousness&#44;&#34; &#38;c.&#44; was recited&#44; when <persName>Rev. Mr. Frankel</persName> responded<lb/> &#34;This is the gate of the Lord&#44;&#34; &#38;c.&#44; while the procession entered and<lb/> proceeded to the Tebah.  The choir attached to the Rodef Sholem<lb/> Synagogue then sang <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; &#34;Blessed be he who cometh in the name<lb/> of the Lord&#44;&#34; &#38;c.  This being completed&#44; the grace <add>Hebrew</add> &#40;<hi rend="italics">Shehecheyanu</hi>&#41;<lb/> was recited by the Hazan&#44; while <persName>Mr. M. D. Cohen</persName> the Secretary of our<lb/> congregation lighted the Perpetual Lamp &#40;<add>Hebrew</add>&#41; as a descendant of<lb/> <persName>Aaron</persName>&#59; and <persName>Mr. Joseph Einstein</persName> opened the doors of the Ark.  Next<lb/> followed <add>Hebrew</add> &#34;I will thank thee&#44;&#34; &#38;c.&#44; by the choir.  A symphony was<lb/> then performed by the band&#44; and the Bearers of the Law&#45;books&#44; having<lb/> changed according to the printed programme which had been generally<lb/> distributed&#44; Psalm xxx. was sung by the choir&#44; while the procession<lb/> moved round the Tebah for the first circuit.  After another piece of<lb/> music&#44; Psalm cxxvii. followed for the second circuit&#59; after which <add>Hebrew</add><lb/> &#34;The Lord will reign&#44;&#34; &#38;c.&#44; and Psalm xxix. were chaunted by the con&#45;<lb/>gregation&#44; while the Sepharim were carried to and deposited in the Ark.<lb/>  The Hazan then recited <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; and this was followed by <add>Hebrew</add> by<lb/> the choir&#44; then by music from the band&#59; in the meanwhile the Hazan<lb/> had ascended the pulpit in front of the <hi rend="italics">Hechal</hi>&#44; and when the sound of<lb/> the instruments had ceased&#44; he delivered the following address&#44; which<lb/> is given&#44; by request&#44; in our pages&#58;</p>
				<p rend="align(center)">THE HOUSE OF THE TRUE GOD.</p>
				<p>BROTHERS OF THE HOUSE OF <placeName>ISRAEL</placeName>&#58;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">WE have assembled to&#45;day for the first time in this house&#44; to<lb/> dedicate it to the worship of the True God&#44; to Him who created<lb/> the heavens and the earth and all which fills universal space&#59;<lb/> and we accordingly devote it&#44; during the time that we or other<lb/> Israelites have possession of this building&#44; to the service of the<lb/> Most High&#44; in order that His NAME may here be invoked by all<lb/> who may desire to associate with us in the adoration of the Being<lb/> whose providence cares for all&#44; and whose omniscience surveys all<lb/> the secrets of the hearts of men.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">We stand thus for the first time in the presence of our Maker</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">3</p>
				<p>as a new association of His adorers&#44; with our wives and little<lb/> ones&#44; to declare that we also desire to be known as a special<lb/> society among other communities of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; as men devoted to<lb/> that cause which was handed down from the most ancient days<lb/> as an heir&#45;loom of the descendants of <persName>Abraham</persName>&#59; and that we are<lb/> ready to labor with a thorough good&#45;will&#44; with united hearts and<lb/> souls&#44; for the maintenance of the blessed faith which has been our<lb/> life and preservation&#44; even from the day that it was entrusted to<lb/> our safe&#45;keeping when we were assembled at the foot of <placeName>Horeb</placeName>&#44;<lb/> until this hour when we are congregated in this house which we<lb/> have called that of the TRUE GOD&#44; of Him who was&#44; who is&#44; and<lb/> who will be.  It is therefore a momentous occasion which has called<lb/> us together&#44; and it well deserves to be pondered on&#44; that it may<lb/> never depart from our memory&#44; while the spirit within us is<lb/> united to the perishable frame&#44; and the divine spark which con&#45;<lb/>stitutes our life is connected with the mortal clay which is its<lb/> dwelling&#44; and that the recollection may accompany us to the<lb/> moment when the angel of death comes to release the soul to<lb/> bear it away to its resting place at the foot of Mercy&#39;s throne.&#8212;<lb/> Let us take for our text <persName>Joshua</persName> xxii. 34&#58;</p>
				<p><add>Hebrew</add>&#58;</p>
				<p>&#34;And the children of <persName>Reuben</persName> and the children of <persName>Gad</persName> called the altar<lb/> &#40;&#34;Ed&#34;&#41;&#59; for &#40;they said&#41; it is a witness between us that the Eternal One<lb/> is God.&#34;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">This passage occurs in one of the last chapters of the book of<lb/> <persName>Joshua</persName>&#44; and is the conclusion of the history of the altar which the<lb/> two and half tribes whose domain was on the <placeName>east side of the Jordan</placeName><lb/> had erected on the bank of that river&#44; when they returned to their<lb/> homes after having assisted the western tribes in conquering the<lb/> land of <placeName>Canaan</placeName>.  It is well known to you&#44; that no altar was per&#45;<lb/>mitted to be erected in the whole country of <placeName>Israel</placeName> besides the<lb/> one which was near the tabernacle&#44; and later&#44; the temple on <placeName>Mo&#45;<lb/>riah</placeName>.  When&#44; therefore&#44; news was brought to the other Israelites<lb/> of this occurrence&#44; they at once assembled at <placeName>Shiloh</placeName> to send out<lb/> an army against what they thought the rebellious tribes to coerce<lb/> them to obedience.  But before proceeding to such extremes they<lb/> dispatched a deputation of eleven of the principal chiefs&#44; among<lb/> whom was the zealous <persName>Phineas</persName>&#44; prudent as he was daring&#44; to</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">4</p>
				<p>remonstrate with the men of <persName>Reuben</persName> and their confederates on<lb/> account of the great transgression of which they presumed them<lb/> guilty.  These&#44; however&#44; answered deprecatingly and said&#58; &#34;The<lb/> God of gods&#44; the Eternal One&#44; the God of gods&#44; the Eternal One&#44;<lb/> he knoweth&#44; and <placeName>Israel</placeName> also shall know&#58; if it be in rebellion&#44; or<lb/> if in transgression against the Lord&#44; &#40;aid us not this day&#44;&#41; that<lb/> we have built us an altar to turn away from following the Lord&#59;<lb/> or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering&#44; or if to offer<lb/> thereon peace&#45;offerings&#44; may the Lord himself require it.&#34;  In<lb/> the same strain they continued to asseverate their good intentions&#44;<lb/> and finished by saying that it should be regarded as a perpetual<lb/> testimony between the portions of Israelites divided from each<lb/> other by the <placeName>Jordan</placeName>&#44; that both the ones and the others believed<lb/> in the same God whom they all then adored.  And when <persName>Phineas</persName><lb/> and his companions had been gratified by this declaration of<lb/> faith&#44; and had departed for their homes&#44; the trans&#45;Jordanic tribes<lb/> gave to the altar the name which designated it to be to them a<lb/> testimony&#44; that in every possible contingency of life the Lord<lb/> should be alone their God&#44; and that they would regard His altar<lb/> at the tabernacle as the only centre of worship&#59; thus pledging<lb/> themselves to offer up their devotions solely after the manner<lb/> laid down in the divine law.  It is well to understand distinctly<lb/> the condition of the world when the Reubenites and their imme&#45;<lb/>diate confederates made this avowal&#59;&#8212;the legislation of <placeName>Sinai</placeName><lb/> was yet new&#44; and they were only the second generation that had<lb/> become familiar with it&#59; all around them&#44; nay&#44; in their own coun&#45;<lb/>try and neighborhood&#44; were many tribes that <sic>worshipped</sic> idols&#44;<lb/> indulged in carnal practices interdicted by the Mosaic law&#44; and in<lb/> brief&#44; were as different in thought and action from the standard<lb/> of righteousness which they had themselves received&#44; as it is pos&#45;<lb/>sible to be.  They were therefore exposed to many temptations<lb/> to fall of by degrees from the road of life they had traveled un&#45;<lb/>der <persName>Moses</persName> and <persName>Joshua</persName>&#44; and to become either like the Egyptians<lb/> in whose land they had been bondsmen&#44; or like the Canaanites<lb/> among whom they then dwelt.  It was no doubt this considera&#45;<lb/>tion which impelled the assembled Israelites at <placeName>Shiloh</placeName> to endeavor<lb/> to crush what they supposed the incipient infection of pagan life<lb/> by a terrible blow&#44; though a universal carnage of the rebels</p>
			<pb n="5"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">5</p>
				<p>might be the result.  But the suspected tribes&#44; on the contrary&#44;<lb/> then declared that they did not desire to multiply places of sacri&#45;<lb/>fice after the manner of the <sic>idolators</sic>&#44; who fancied that frequent<lb/> acts of devotion&#44; performed in many places&#44; were requisite to<lb/> propitiate their gods&#59; but that they would&#44; after the simpler<lb/> fashion of the Scripture&#45;commands&#44; resort only to the spot<lb/> chosen by God out of all their tribes to offer up there and there<lb/> alone all that had been commanded&#44; and just as it had been or&#45;<lb/>dained&#59; and that the very altar they had erected on the banks<lb/> of the <placeName>Jordan</placeName>&#44; standing as it should&#44; in solitude and silence&#44; with&#45;<lb/>out smoke to arise from its hearth&#44; without a priest to keep watch<lb/> near it&#44; without the festive crowd to encamp in its precincts on<lb/> the stated seasons of pilgrimage&#44; should prove in the strongest<lb/> manner&#44; that the structure was merely a testimony to all behold&#45;<lb/>ers&#44; that the stream which divides <placeName>Palestine</placeName> into two unequal<lb/> parts&#44; did not separate the people into two sects&#59; but that both<lb/> the inhabitants of the <placeName>East</placeName> and the <placeName>West</placeName> were bound together by<lb/> the ties of one faith&#44; having one country&#44; one origin&#44; one religion&#44;<lb/> one altar&#44; and one God&#33;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">We&#44; too&#44; my friends&#44; stand here this day before the world with<lb/> a new structure which we have dedicated to the cause of religion&#59;<lb/> but it is not a new faith which is to be <sic>symbolised</sic> here&#44; no new<lb/> worship which is to be introduced within these walls&#59; and all<lb/> <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; if all were witnesses here this day&#44; should see&#44; that<lb/> neither in rebellion&#44; nor in transgression against the Most High&#44;<lb/> nor in malevolence towards our brothers of other societies has<lb/> the work been begun and thus far completed&#59; but to cement the<lb/> stronger our adherence to God&#39;s most holy law&#44; and to fortify<lb/> ourselves in the attachment to the whole household of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44;<lb/> which was once so strong and beautiful&#44; but which has&#44; alas&#33; so<lb/> greatly waned in the troublous times through which we have had<lb/> to pass.  You must not forget&#44; my brothers&#44; that&#44; though we are<lb/> not surrounded by the idols of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>&#44; nor by the abominations<lb/> of <placeName>Canaan</placeName>&#44; our warfare with the world without is not accomplished.<lb/>  Our faith has its enemies in the circumstance that we are still a<lb/> peculiar people&#44; with laws which separate us from the board and<lb/> communion of non&#45;Israelites&#59; in the fact that we adore a NAME<lb/> who is not yet enthroned alone and solely in the hearts of man&#44;</p>
				<p rend="align(center)">1&#42;</p>
			<pb n="6"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">6</p>
				<p>though He is alone and solely the TRUE GOD&#44; the Creator of all<lb/> things.  Political power and influence are&#44; as such&#44; no necessary<lb/> appendage to the household of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#59; but we are scattered&#44;<lb/> strewn like the seed from the pouch of the <sic>ploughman</sic>&#44; over the<lb/> surface of the earth&#44; to be controlled and trammeled by all who<lb/> differ from us&#44; and who unite in this&#44; when even differing ever so<lb/> widely among themselves&#44; that it is for the benefit of the world<lb/> at large&#44; that the Hebrew race should be watched and kept with&#45;<lb/>in the narrowest possible bounds&#44; lest their creed should spread&#44;<lb/> and their religion attain to that degree of power&#44; that it might<lb/> work an injury unto those modes of thought and practice to<lb/> which the various sections of mankind are devoted.  This hostil&#45;<lb/>ity is at the same time not always a mere passive dislike&#44; which<lb/> shows itself in an unwillingness to associate with us on terms of<lb/> equality&#44; and to grant us that weight in the historical develop&#45;<lb/>ment of the world which would of right be due to our industry&#44;<lb/> probity&#44; and intelligence&#44; or in short&#44; to treat us as one man<lb/> usually treats the other&#59; but in many quarters of the globe active<lb/> measures of repression and coercion are resorted to&#44; in order to<lb/> vex us with restraints and burdens which others are exempt from&#44;<lb/> and to offer all possible inducements to those&#44; whose heart is not<lb/> sincere&#44; to forsake a faith which brings no worldly gain&#44; and to<lb/> cast off the connection with a people which the laws of the land<lb/> and public prejudice stigmatize as inferior to the other classes of<lb/> the inhabitants.  Though millions of martyrs have at all periods<lb/> of history testified by their death&#44; under incredible tortures of<lb/> body and mind&#44; that no suffering was capable to withdraw them<lb/> from their God and his law&#58; still experience has proved that many<lb/> have yielded to the allurement of public offices to either become<lb/> apostates altogether&#44; or to shape their conduct so that their Juda&#45;<lb/>ism was rendered <sic>undistinguishable</sic> to the <sic>unpractised</sic> eye&#44; so<lb/> that such as these at times boast of having so well disguised their<lb/> inherited religion&#44; as not to be suspected of belonging to its ad&#45;<lb/>herents.  Others again there are who daily make the amount of<lb/> duties to be performed less and less&#44; because they fancy themselves<lb/> exempt from its behests in this enlightened age of the world&#44; and<lb/> so approximate the Gentile freedom from the precepts&#44; that they<lb/> gradually lapse into infidelity&#44; or they unconsciously almost join</p>

This latter species of <sic>apostacy</sic> is more com&#45;<lb/>mon where we enjoy a moderate or entire share of equality of<lb/> civil and political rights&#44; than where we are oppressed and ex&#45;<lb/>cluded from participating in the privileges of citizenship.  The<lb/> very distance of the danger will bring us within its grasp.  Tell<lb/> a man&#44; when he begins to acquire wealth and distinction&#44; that he<lb/> has taken the first step to banish his sons from the precincts of<lb/> the Synagogue&#44; and he will exhibit all the appearances of offended<lb/> rectitude.  For he will tell you&#44; that he is engaged in a pursuit<lb/> which will exhibit him to the world as an ornament to human<lb/> nature&#59; that he trusts&#44; with the help of Heaven&#44; to prove what the<lb/> Jew is capable of achieving if his genius is unchecked&#59; and that<lb/> he will nevertheless take heed that all in his household shall<lb/> know that they are Israelites&#44; the possessors of a faith of which<lb/> they should justly be proud.  But if we look on him again at a<lb/> later period&#44; we may find that he has by degrees relaxed the<lb/> strict discipline which once prevailed in his home&#59; that he has<lb/> so many engagements&#44; that he is not able to watch all the walks<lb/> in which his children tread the course of life&#59; that while he toils<lb/> for large gains&#44; or fame and position&#44; they seek each their own<lb/> pleasures&#59; become more and more strangers to the house of God&#59;<lb/> lapse by degrees into non&#45;Jewish society&#59; form intimacies which<lb/> deaden the last spark of devotion in their souls&#59; and that they<lb/> succeed&#44; perchance&#44; to withdraw their aged and now helpless<lb/> parents from the close communion with their brothers&#44; ashamed<lb/> and degraded in their own estimation&#44; or entrapped into actual<lb/> transgression&#44; by the misconduct of those who&#44; they once vainly<lb/> hoped&#44; would perpetuate their name as a house honored among</p>

				<p>the descendants of <persName>Jacob</persName>.  By this process of self&#45;exaltation&#44;<lb/> and a gradually increasing contempt for the association with<lb/> other Israelites&#44; which led the children to cast off the little re&#45;<lb/>straint the parental teaching had at first imposed on them&#44; families<lb/> once numerous among us are approaching their extinction&#44; and<lb/> it is possible that in a few generations not one of them will be<lb/> left to swear fealty to the Eternal God.  Yet the transition was<lb/> very slow at first&#59; in the beginning it was perhaps a substitution<lb/> of the first for the seventh day of the week as the <date>Sabbath</date> of the<lb/> Lord&#59; next visiting places of instruction where a faith different<lb/> from ours was taught&#59; then a gradual withdrawal from those who<lb/> were professing Jews&#44; because they stood not as high in the world&#39;s<lb/> estimation&#59; then the covenant of <persName>Abraham</persName> was neglected&#59; or<lb/> the daughter of the son of the stranger entered into family rela&#45;<lb/>tions with the child of <persName>Jacob</persName>&#59; and thus the way was left open<lb/> for a quiet mingling as a member with one of the non&#45;Jewish<lb/> associations&#59; and in this way a name and a family have perished<lb/> in <placeName>Israel</placeName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">But not alone those in an exalted position are thus lost to us&#59;<lb/> many in inferior positions imitate the evil example set them by<lb/> the others&#59; and they mingle with the debauchee and the outcast&#44;<lb/> there to indulge their wicked inclinations&#44; forsaking thereby the<lb/> home where humble piety dwells&#44; and departing from the path of<lb/> the law&#44; to their entire ruin.  It is not necessary to produce illustra&#45;<lb/>tions from our experience to prove the truth of what I have just<lb/> uttered&#59; for all of you may&#44; if they will tax their memory&#44; verify<lb/> my words by what has fallen under their own observation&#59; and<lb/> they will therefore acknowledge that we are not exempt from<lb/> danger&#44; in the present posture of events&#44; though we live not in<lb/> the midst of idolators&#44; as did the Reubenites when they built the<lb/> altar near the <placeName>Jordan</placeName>.  Let us&#44; therefore&#44; avail ourselves of this<lb/> occasion to reflect on the work before us.

We<lb/> bind ourselves&#44; by devoting this house especially to the attribute<lb/> of &#34;Truth&#44;&#34; which is the seal of the Creator under which He call&#45;<lb/>ed the world into being&#44; that we will guard the faith with all our</p>

				<p>strength against the encroachment of error from whatever side<lb/> this might threaten it&#44; and to show ourselves truthful in single&#45;<lb/>ness of devotion to the precepts we have received.  We shall be<lb/> indeed approached with appeals as to the unreasonableness of<lb/> an adherence to antiquated notions and practices&#59; but this is the<lb/> very purpose which ought to engage us&#59; and to succeed we ought<lb/> to search into what has come down from the days of antiquity.<lb/>  Our very name is as ancient as history.  <persName>Abraham</persName> was surnamed<lb/> the <hi rend="italics">Hebrew</hi>&#44; and this designation yet denotes his descendants&#59;<lb/> <persName>Jacob</persName> was <sic>blest</sic> and called <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; and we are therefore the proper<lb/> Israelites of whose future so much is said in the Holy Scriptures&#44;<lb/> and of whom so many hopeful anticipations are entertained.  It<lb/> would be now insulting to sound human reason to pause here to<lb/> prove that it would be impossible to preserve the identity of the<lb/> Israelites without the bond of the law&#59; as without this&#44; they<lb/> would soon cease to be distinguishable among the rest of man&#45;<lb/>kind&#44; and would thus disappear as agents from the work of history.<lb/>  But to check the deterioration which was just alluded to&#44; and to<lb/> preserve the identity of our race&#44; which many have lost already&#44;<lb/> we ought to resort to those measures which were found so effica&#45;<lb/>cious in the days of <persName>Hezekiah</persName> and <persName>Josiah</persName>&#44; kings of <placeName>Judah</placeName>&#44; and<lb/> of <persName>Ezra</persName> and <persName>Nehemiah</persName>&#44; when the Babylonian captivity had been<lb/> terminated by the re&#45;building of the temple of <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>.  These<lb/> means were&#44; first&#44; a greater cordiality among the people&#44; a more<lb/> intimate union for the purpose of furthering the observance of<lb/> the precepts of the Scriptures&#44; and&#44; secondly&#44; an earnest endea&#45;<lb/>vor to render all more familiar with the contents of the Scriptures<lb/> than they had been before.  At a future day we shall no doubt<lb/> recur to this topic at greater length&#59; our present purpose is<lb/> merely to sketch an outline of what is needed.  When we were<lb/> still under one government&#44; and had a country which we could<lb/> call our own&#44; the heads of the state&#44; such as judges&#44; kings&#44; princes&#44;<lb/> governors&#44; and high&#45;priests&#44; could&#44; by their political power and<lb/> influence&#44; contribute largely to the direct improvement of religion<lb/> and morals&#59; hence we find that&#44; in proportion as our rulers were<lb/> virtuous and pious&#44; the people were so likewise.  But at present&#44;<lb/> other influences must be brought to bear on us&#44; and they are&#44;<lb/> simply&#44; association and individual exertions.  As regards the</p>
			<pb n="10"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">10</p>
				<p>first&#44; let us observe that no matter how great a mind may dwell<lb/> in any man&#44; he cannot labor except in a very limited sphere&#59; he<lb/> can be only in one place at a time&#44; and he is therefore liable to<lb/> be counteracted and defeated by the next comer&#44; not so much by<lb/> the superior power of the other&#44; as by his own absence&#44; through<lb/> which means his influence is overcome by&#44; perhaps&#44; the mere as&#45;<lb/>surance and impudent&#44; bold&#44; assertions of the other.  It is for<lb/> this reason nothing new&#44; that public bodies exhibit the incon&#45;<lb/>stancy of the sea&#44; as they are swayed often&#44; not by a positive<lb/> rule of right&#44; but by the opinion of the latest teacher.  To avoid<lb/> this uncertainty and constant fluctuation&#44; it is necessary to asso&#45;<lb/>ciate together on a basis of unvarying principles&#44; and to establish<lb/> a rule which nothing shall be able to overthrow.  You have at&#45;<lb/>tempted to carry this into practice&#44; my friends&#44; in the constitution<lb/> you have adopted&#44; by laying down the irrevocable rule that you<lb/> will&#44; as a body&#44; have only those prayers which the great lights of<lb/> <placeName>Israel</placeName> delighted to employ in their addressing Him &#34;who sitteth on<lb/> the throne of mercy&#59;&#34; and in so doing&#44; you also declare that you<lb/> will faithfully and truly abide by the principles which the words<lb/> of these prayers inculcate.  You have farther declared that only<lb/> Israelites in practice shall have a controlling power in your as&#45;<lb/>semblies&#59; the doors of this house shall indeed stand open wide&#44;<lb/> to admit every one&#44; the righteous one and the sinner&#44; the son of<lb/> <persName>Abraham</persName> and him whose parentage is not of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; to offer up<lb/> here their devotion&#44; and to pour out their heart before the Lord<lb/> in joy or in sorrow&#59; since God himself has taught us that his<lb/> house should be a house of prayer to all people.  At the same<lb/> time it has been resolved on wisely&#44; to exclude all from the con&#45;<lb/>trol of affairs whose own conduct would stamp them as unfit to<lb/> be trusted with a voice in the religious concerns of <placeName>Israel</placeName>.  Hav&#45;<lb/>ing thus commenced&#44; let us hope that you will feel the weight of<lb/> the obligation resting on you&#44; and that you will resolve to leave<lb/> nothing untried to induce each other to be strict in the observance<lb/> of all those duties in which so many are deficient&#44; especially<lb/> the keeping of the Lord&#39;s <date>Sabbath</date>&#44; that this house may not be<lb/> empty&#44; while those&#44; who have an interest here&#44; seek their worldly<lb/> gains in their places of business&#59; we will trust that you will stimu&#45;<lb/>late each other to give all the children a knowledge of their faith</p>

				<p>and of the language of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; that&#44; when they come hither&#44; the<lb/> words of the prayers may be familiar to their ears&#44; and not sound to<lb/> them like an unmeaning jargon which makes nothing but an un&#45;<lb/>pleasant impression on the mind.  But individual exertions must not<lb/> be omitted&#44; nor should any one wait to move in the expectation that<lb/> the public will and ought to go first forward.  Whatever strikes<lb/> either of you as useful and practicable&#44; he ought to bring before<lb/> the community and request in a courteous manner their co&#45;opera&#45;<lb/>tion&#59; and in case it does not meet with as prompt support as<lb/> he has perhaps a right to expect&#44; he should endeavor to see what<lb/> he can do alone&#44; and labor to awake public attention to his plan&#44;<lb/> and in the meanwhile accomplish all that an individual&#44; single&#45;<lb/>handed&#44; is able to attain.  Persuasion&#44; honesty of purpose&#44; and<lb/> unflagging industry&#44; are almost unfailing means in insuring suc&#45;<lb/>cess&#59; and the empire of religion also needs servants animated<lb/> with these qualities to achieve a triumph over the enemies that<lb/> oppose its progress.</p>

Yea&#44; it is<lb/> befitting that we should turn our eyes and our hearts to the land<lb/> of our origin&#44; the land where Judaism was cradled&#44; nursed&#44;<lb/> and fondly caressed by our devoted fathers and mothers.

Let us not imagine&#44; my friends&#44; that our whole duty<lb/> has been accomplished in erecting this sacred house of worship.<lb/>  We have not erected this house solely because we live here and<lb/> enjoy here the manifold blessings of liberty&#44; or because we have<lb/> been permitted here to enjoy the reward of our honest labor.<lb/>  No&#44; while we have erected this house as we are in duty bound to<lb/> erect houses of prayer and thanksgiving wherever the dispersed<lb/> of <placeName>Israel</placeName> may be scattered and located&#44; as a mark of our devo&#45;<lb/>tion to God&#58; we should bear in mind that glorious temple&#44; the<lb/> dwelling place of the Shechina which dwelt in the midst of <placeName>Israel</placeName><lb/> in the land of promise&#44; a land flowing with milk and honey.  Here<lb/> let us pray&#44; that the blessing of God may again descend upon<lb/> the patrimony of <placeName>Israel</placeName>.

Whatever<lb/> then&#44; my friends&#44; may be the solemn purpose for which we have<lb/> erected this Synagogue&#44; we owe it in the first place to our ori&#45;</p>
			<pb n="19"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">19</p>
				<p>gin&#44; to our faith&#44; to the memory of our glorious ancestors&#44; to<lb/> remember <placeName>Zion</placeName>&#44; and to pray to the Almighty that He may look<lb/> down from His glorious abode from heaven and bless his people<lb/> <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; <hi rend="italics">and the soil</hi> which He has given unto us&#44; as He swore unto<lb/> our ancestors&#44; &#34;a land flowing with milk and honey.&#34;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">But&#44; my friends&#44; that we may more readily know and under&#45;<lb/>stand our duties in this Synagogue&#44; let us inquire into four<lb/> things.  First&#58; Why have we built this Synagogue&#63;  Second&#58;<lb/> What are the principles which should govern us in this Syna&#45;<lb/>gogue&#63;  Third&#58; What should the Synagogue be to us&#63;  And<lb/> Fourth and lastly&#58; What should we be to the Synagogue&#63;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">And&#44; first&#58; Why have we built this Synagogue&#63;  My friends&#44;<lb/> in proposing the first question&#44; I wish you distinctly to under&#45;<lb/>stand that I can have nothing at all to do with any of the political<lb/> reasons which contributed towards the erection of this edifice<lb/> into a Jewish house of worship.  Whatever may have been the<lb/> ordinary or extraordinary causes by which this consummation was<lb/> effected&#44; can have nothing&#44; and has nothing to do with my consi&#45;<lb/>deration of the question under discussion.  It is enough for me<lb/> to know that whenever a place of worship is established by the<lb/> children of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; a bright and luminous star is added to the<lb/> already shining and illustrious constellation of the Jewish race&#59;<lb/> another appendage to the pure and spotless banner of the house<lb/> of <persName>Jacob</persName>.  It is enough for me to know that whenever and wher&#45;<lb/>ever a Synagogue is erected&#44; we have established another monu&#45;<lb/>ment to the living and sacred truth of our holy faith and heaven&#45;<lb/>born religion.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Yes&#44; my brethren&#44; I find an answer readily suggested to the<lb/> inquiry&#44; in the fact that <add>Hebrew</add> when<lb/> Synagogues are spread over the land from where the sun rises<lb/> in the morning to the place where he sets in the evening&#44; the<lb/> name of the Lord shall thereby be extolled.  This is the reason<lb/> why this Synagogue has been established.  There runs&#44; my friends&#44;<lb/> a holy current of feeling in the Jewish heart&#44; which throbs&#44;<lb/> expands&#44; dilates&#44; and seeks expression in an outward form.<lb/>  There reigns a holy conviction in the Jewish mind&#44; that God the<lb/> Creator is the Sovereign who alone should be adored&#59;&#8212;and it is<lb/> this thought&#44; this conviction&#44; which clothes itself in an outward</p>
			<pb n="20"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">20</p>
				<p>garb&#44; denominated public worship.  It is this intensely felt sen&#45;<lb/>sation which awakens in us the desire to multiply places of wor&#45;<lb/>ship&#44; wherein we can give expression to our most holy feelings.<lb/>  If the Jew were really callous and indifferent about his faith&#44; he<lb/> would not trouble himself about places of worship&#44; he would not<lb/> incur the expense of multiplying houses of prayer.  He might<lb/> say&#44; &#34;Whenever I feel disposed to pray&#44; I can find some place of<lb/> worship where I can attend.&#34;  But no&#44; whatever may be his mo&#45;<lb/>tives for not attending other places of worship already in exist&#45;<lb/>ence&#44; he cannot sit down in a state of indifference&#58; he must be up<lb/> and doing&#44; he must exemplify his love for his faith by the erection<lb/> of a place of worship where he can attend without any scruples.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Would you&#44; my brethren&#44; then know the reason why this place<lb/> of worship has been added to the many already in existence&#63;<lb/>  Then I answer&#44; it is because proofs are being every day added of<lb/> the truth of the faith of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#59; because proofs are being every day<lb/> added that the spirit&#44; the essence&#44; the principles of the Jewish<lb/> religion hold a predominating sway&#44; exercise a profoundly felt<lb/> influence in the Jewish breast.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">But again&#44; let me ask&#44; Why have we instituted this place of<lb/> worship&#63;  My friends&#44; we have done so at the express command<lb/> of God.  It is the bounden duty of Israelites to erect a house of<lb/> worship&#44; in other words&#44; a house for God to dwell therein.  As<lb/> soon as the Israelite feels the conviction that he is under the<lb/> providential care and government of One sole and indivisible<lb/> God&#44; then it is his duty to unite with his brethren in rendering<lb/> homage to that Being in a house dedicated to His worship.  God<lb/> has commanded our fathers&#44; <add>Hebrew</add>&#44; &#34;Make me<lb/> a sanctuary&#44; and I will dwell amongst them.&#34;  We need not be<lb/> told by the philosopher&#44; that a Being whose essence is incom&#45;<lb/>prehensible&#44; whose nature is beyond human ken&#44; whose Divine<lb/> character is a profound mystery to us&#44; who is omnipotent&#44; omni&#45;<lb/>scient&#44; and omnipresent&#44; cannot be circumscribed and confined<lb/> within the narrow limits of four walls.  We need not be told by<lb/> the man of reason&#44; that the creature cannot make a place for the<lb/> Creator&#59; for the Scriptures themselves speak of the boundless<lb/> majesty of God&#44;&#8212;and we require no better exponent of this idea<lb/> than the words of our text&#44; in which we are directed to pray that</p>
			<pb n="21"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">21</p>
				<p>God&#44; in His infinite goodness&#44; may look down from heaven His<lb/> abode.  Yea&#44; my friends&#44; heaven is His abode&#44; the whole unlimit&#45;<lb/>ed space of infinite worlds&#44; the whole universal structure of<lb/> heaven and earth&#44; and the illimitable regions of an infinite ex&#45;<lb/>tension&#44; which even the mind&#44; in its ascending flights of bold ima&#45;<lb/>gination&#44; cannot reach&#8212;all this is filled with His glory.  Full well<lb/> we know then&#44; that this house cannot contain the majesty of God.<lb/>  Why then have we built this house&#63;  We have done so&#44; my friends&#44;<lb/> that through this act of devotion the spirit of God may dwell in us.<lb/>  A bright luminary in <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; the author of Akedath Yizchak&#44;<lb/> &#40;<add>Hebrew</add>&#41; says&#44; that our religion may be compared to a stupen&#45;<lb/>dous building.  In looking at it&#44; we first gaze upon its materials&#44;<lb/> next upon its order&#44; next to its stability&#44; and lastly its purpose.<lb/>  In looking&#44; my friends&#44; at a Synagogue&#44; both ideas&#44; the ideas<lb/> connected with the characteristics of a building&#44; and the charac&#45;<lb/>teristics of our religion&#44; are intimately associated.  What is the<lb/> purpose of this building&#63;  The answer is self&#45;evident&#44; Religion&#33;<lb/>  What else&#44; pride&#44; or vanity&#44; or ambition&#63;  No&#33; no&#33; religion&#44;<lb/> the desire to accelerate the means of our approach to God&#44; and<lb/> to bring the influence of His Divine spirit to reside in our midst&#59;<lb/> this is the solemn purpose for which we have erected this house<lb/> of prayer.  We can&#44; in fact&#44; my friends&#44; form no better idea of<lb/> the purposes of the Synagogue&#44; than in reflecting upon the say&#45;<lb/>ing of some of the sages of <placeName>Israel</placeName>.  Wherefore was the temple<lb/> built in <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>&#63;  Because&#44; they say&#44; it was erected in a direct<lb/> line with the sanctum sanctorum of heaven.  <placeName>Palestine</placeName>&#44; my friends&#44;<lb/> is situated in the centre of the world.  As God&#44; therefore&#44; who is<lb/> the real sanctuary and the concentration of holiness&#44; is the centre<lb/> of all His great works&#44; which derive life and consistency from Him<lb/> alone&#44; and which would&#44; without His sustaining breath&#44; fall into<lb/> atoms and become consumed by the withering blast of His<lb/> anger&#58; so is religion&#44; which is symbolized by the earthly sanc&#45;<lb/>tuary&#44; the centre of the moral world.  Without religion there<lb/> would be no morality.  Without places of worship dedicated to<lb/> the God of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; there would be no true religion.  The Syna&#45;<lb/>gogue is the centre of true religion&#44;&#8212;there men unite to adore<lb/> the true God&#44; the Creator of heaven and earth&#44;&#8212;there men de&#45;<lb/>sire that life and sustaining breath which keep together the</p>
			<pb n="22"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">22</p>
				<p>moral and social fabric of the world&#44;&#8212;there men learn those vital<lb/> principles and duties of love and friendship&#44; which are the pillars<lb/> upon which the temple of harmony is firmly built.  The Syna&#45;<lb/>gogue should be built in a direct line with the sanctuary of Hea&#45;<lb/>ven&#59; so that the stream of God&#39;s love might flow from the peren&#45;<lb/>nial spring of His Divine solicitude upon us&#44; and refresh&#44; invigo&#45;<lb/>rate&#44; and sustain our hearts.  This&#44; my friends&#44; is the reason why<lb/> we have built this Synagogue.  Oh&#33; that it may always be the<lb/> centre around which our holiest emotions might cling.  Oh&#33; that<lb/> it may always stand in a direct line with the sanctuary of Heaven&#44;<lb/> that the dews of love&#44; mercy&#44; and grace may descend and refresh<lb/> our hearts.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Secondly&#58; What are the principles which should govern us in<lb/> the Synagogue&#63;  The difficulties which I might have encountered<lb/> in addressing any other audience but a Jewish one&#44; and on any<lb/> other subject but the present&#44; I do not experience.  Thank God&#33;<lb/>  I am addressing my own brethren&#44; one with me in the spirit and<lb/> in the flesh&#44;&#8212;indoctrinated in the same eternal principles of faith&#44;<lb/>&#8212;and united by the same ties&#44; having the same attachments&#44;<lb/> the same fond hopes and aspirations&#44; in whose hearts burn the<lb/> same intense flame of Sinaic fire&#44; who live in the same reverence<lb/> for the undying word of God&#58; yea&#44; I address the sons of <persName>Jacob</persName><lb/> initiated into the covenant of <persName>Abraham</persName>&#44;&#8212;the daughters of the holy mothers<lb/> of <placeName>Israel</placeName> who valued the word of inspiration more than they did<lb/> life&#44; who knew how to spurn every attempt to draw them from<lb/> their faith&#44; their plighted troth&#44; who could frown upon princes<lb/> and despise palaces&#44; who could find contentment and happiness<lb/> in the lot and condition of outcast <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; who loved their God<lb/> in solitude&#44; and hated affluence when it conflicted with their con&#45;<lb/>scientous convictions of duty.  Such sons and such daughters<lb/> am I&#44; thank God&#44; this day permitted to address&#59; and speaking in<lb/> the name of such a religion and to such a people&#44; I can have no<lb/> difficulty in defining the principles which should govern us in&#44;<lb/> yea&#44; and out of the Synagogue.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">What other principles than those long established ancient&#44; ay&#44;<lb/> and permanent principles of truth which have ever governed the</p>

				<p rend="align(center)">23</p>
				<p>chosen people of God&#44; should influence us in the <sic>Synagoge</sic>&#63; what<lb/> other than those long cherished doctrines of the Jewish creed&#44; in<lb/> maintaining which our forefathers died&#44; and suffered every species<lb/> of cruelty and unheard of tortures&#44; should rally us round our<lb/> banner&#63; what other than those principles of a vital and soul&#45;sav&#45;<lb/>ing conviction in the truth of our Divine legacy&#44; bequeathed to<lb/> us by our fathers&#44; which they derived from the pure and living<lb/> fount of <placeName>Sinai</placeName>&#44; should incite us to renewed vigor and zeal in our<lb/> attachment to the house which we have dedicated to God&#63;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Remember&#44; my friends&#44; the name by which we have designated<lb/> this temple&#44; and it will best inform you of the principles which<lb/> should ever guide you in your pious and holy labor.  The name<lb/> of this house is at once expressive of your duties and the princi&#45;<lb/>ples which are to govern you here and elsewhere.  This place<lb/> has been very happily denominated Beth&#45;El&#45;Emeth&#44; <add>Hebrew</add>&#44;<lb/> &#34;The house of the true God.&#34;  We come here to worship truth.<lb/>  We come here to adore a Being who is the embodiment of truth.<lb/>  We come here to give expression to the convictions of our mind&#44;<lb/> and to pour out the sincere feelings of our hearts.  Truth and<lb/> sincerity are the characteristics of the homage which we meet<lb/> here to pay to our God&#8212;God is truth&#44; therefore must the<lb/> principles which regulate us here be founded and exercised in<lb/> truth.  Yes&#44; my friends&#44; the name of this house will best indicate<lb/> the principles which should govern us therein.</p>

			<pb n="24"/>
				<p rend="align(center)">24</p>
				<p>depending solely upon what is termed the moral sense of right<lb/> and wrong&#44; is at best a weak and unreliable staff&#44; a reed which is<lb/> easily broken&#44;&#8212;it is not that column of strength&#44; capable of sup&#45;<lb/>porting the upper building in the stormy season&#44; when the ele&#45;<lb/>ments are lashed in fury.

Charity said&#44; Create him&#44; for he will<lb/> perform offices of charity&#59; but Peace said&#44; Create him not&#44; for he<lb/> will be full of strife&#59; but the Eternal threw truth down upon<lb/> the earth&#44; as it is written in <persName>Daniel</persName>&#58; &#39;And he cast truth down<lb/> upon the earth.&#39;&#34;  In these few words&#44; my friends&#44; our sages de&#45;<lb/>velop the whole theory of our moral and religious being.  They<lb/> show us the antithesis of our nature.  Man could not exist by<lb/> the means of a moral principle alone&#59; for&#44; while his nature might<lb/> at times prompt him to acts of benevolence&#44; it would at others<lb/> falsify his professions of virtue&#59; while he might at times be in&#45;<lb/>clined to charity&#44; strife&#44; which is an inherent element of our<lb/> nature&#44; would obtain an overwhelming influence over him&#44; and<lb/> destroy the peaceful agency of love and charity.  But truth&#44; the<lb/> truth of religion&#44; the truth of revelation&#44; the truth as it has been<lb/> imparted to us by God&#44; truth as it has been thrown down from<lb/> heaven to purify and enrich the earth with its abundant and soul&#45;<lb/>saving blessings&#44; raises us&#44; and dignifies our nature.  By truth<lb/> alone <hi rend="italics">we</hi> can live&#44; by truth alone is the moral fabric sustained.<lb/>  The contending influences of our nature&#44; which the <hi rend="italics">Midrash</hi> typi&#45;<lb/>fies by angels&#44; are lulled and quieted&#44; and man stands forth a<lb/> mighty&#44; grand&#44; and noble handiwork of the Creator.

			<p rend="indent(1)">Let us now&#44; my friends&#44; look to the third question which we<lb/> have proposed to consider&#44; viz&#58; What should the Synagogue be<lb/> to us&#63;  This&#44; my friends&#44; is a very important consideration.  Im&#45;<lb/>portant for the moral points involved therein&#44; as well as for the<lb/> historical considerations&#44; as well as for the religious feature con&#45;<lb/>nected with our destiny&#44; as well for the past as for the future of<lb/> Judaism&#59; for when we shall have considered this question well<lb/> in all its bearings&#44; I am confident that you will see the Synagogue<lb/> not only in the light of a mere handsome building&#44; not in the light<lb/> of a mere institution&#44; subject like all other institutions&#44; to the influ&#45;<lb/>ence of change and improvement&#44; but in the light of an eternal</p>

			<p rend="indent(1)">The Synagogue&#44; my friends&#44; should be to us a monumental re&#45;<lb/>cord of the past&#59; it should tend to connect the present with the<lb/> past.  If there be one miracle palpably and evidently seen in<lb/> these days of scientific discoveries&#44; when the folly and the wick&#45;<lb/>edness of some men have led them to deny the agency of any<lb/> superhuman power in the rise and fall of nations&#44; that miracle<lb/> is the existence of the Synagogue.  For notwithstanding all the<lb/> efforts to destroy Judaism&#44; which have been made from time to<lb/> time&#44; and the interdicting of our worship&#44; so as to merge us among<lb/> the other nations of the earth&#44; the Synagogue still exists.  Won&#45;<lb/>derful testimony of Divine truth&#33;  There thou standest a mes&#45;<lb/>senger of Heaven to proclaim the truth&#33;  There thou standest&#44;<lb/> holding the olive branch of love and conciliation to all who shall<lb/> believe in the goodness and power of God&#33;  There thou standest&#44;<lb/> in the native simplicity of thy own pure attribute of truth&#44; de&#45;<lb/>claiming that&#44; though monuments&#44; and thrones&#44; and palaces&#44; and<lb/> powers&#44; and empires shall fall and crumble to the dust&#44; thou wilt<lb/> stand as the appointed servant of God&#44; until the day when all<lb/> men shall acknowledge the Unity of <hi rend="italics">one</hi> Eternal Power.  The<lb/> Synagogue is the monument which connects our present with our<lb/> past history<lb/> therefore should it be preserved from foreign influ&#45;<lb/>ences which belong not to the history of Judaism&#59; therefore should<lb/> we come here to learn our duties.  Yea&#44; here we may see <placeName>Sinai</placeName><lb/> flaming in the fires of Heaven&#59; here we may hear the thunders&#44;<lb/> and listen to the trumpet notes which gathered our ancestors<lb/> round the holy scene&#59; here by an historical evidence which the<lb/> Synagogue presents us of the facts of the history of revelation&#44;<lb/> we may see with our mind&#39;s eye&#44; and hearken with the Divine<lb/> faculty of our spirit to the amazing sound which filled our fathers&#39;<lb/> hearts with love and veneration.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The Synagogue represents the principles taught by <persName>Moses</persName> in<lb/> the wilderness&#44; when the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> received the Law from<lb/> God.  There they were told&#44; &#34;Not with you alone hath the Lord<lb/> made this covenant and this oath of denunciation&#44; but with those<lb/> who stand here this day and those who stand not here this day.&#34;</p>

				<p>Well have our sages paraphrased this by saying&#44; all the forth&#45;<lb/>coming souls of <placeName>Israel</placeName> were present on that occasion.  Yes&#44; my<lb/> brethren&#44; the principles taught on that glorious day are as bind&#45;<lb/>ing upon all the forthcoming generations of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; as if they had<lb/> been there&#59;&#8212;and the <hi rend="italics">institutions</hi> of our faith&#44; the Synagogues<lb/> and temples erected by <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; have always been <hi rend="italics">monuments</hi> in<lb/> the life of <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; connecting the existing time with that on which<lb/> <placeName>Israel</placeName> received the Law.  In the Temple stood that very ark of<lb/> the covenant which <persName>Moses</persName> commanded our fathers to make as a<lb/> testimony to the truth of revelation.  There stood&#44; also&#44; the table<lb/> of show bread and other historical <sic>memetoes</sic>&#44; connecting the<lb/> existing time with the giving of the word of God in the wilder&#45;<lb/>ness of <placeName>Sinai</placeName>&#59; and even now&#44; in our dispersion&#44; we have memen&#45;<lb/>toes of that glorious time.  Here are read every <date>Sabbath</date> seven<lb/> portions of that Law which God gave our ancestors&#44; so that the<lb/> whole is finished once every year&#44; and renewed again&#59; so that the<lb/> spirit of truth might thereby be sustained in <placeName>Israel</placeName>.  Here we<lb/> are reminded&#44; by historical associations&#44; of <placeName>Israel&#39;s</placeName> new career.  In<lb/> our prayers we recite those incidents of distress and happiness<lb/> which our fathers experienced&#44; all leading us back&#44; by successive<lb/> stages&#44; to the period when <placeName>Israel</placeName> stood before <placeName>Sinai</placeName>&#59; so that it<lb/> may&#44; indeed&#44; be figuratively said&#44; <hi rend="italics">our souls</hi> were present at the<lb/> giving of the Law on <placeName>Sinai</placeName>.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">The Synagogue&#44; then&#44; should emphatically be looked upon as<lb/> a monumental record of the past.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Judaism&#44; my friends&#44; unlike any other system&#44; derives its ex&#45;<lb/>istence from two distinct ages&#8212;from the past and the future.  It<lb/> lives <hi rend="italics">in</hi> the present age&#44; but not <hi rend="italics">by</hi> the present age.  It has no&#45;<lb/>thing in common with the present age.  Like the people of whom<lb/> <persName>Balaam</persName> prophesied&#44; &#34;Behold this people shall dwell alone and<lb/> not be counted among the nations&#44;&#34; so is Judaism&#44; surrounded on<lb/> all sides with systems of faith&#44; with religious ideas&#44; and views of<lb/> public worship&#44; but partakes of none.  Its attribute is individu&#45;<lb/>ality&#44; its characteristic is its adaptation for the people to whom<lb/> it was given as their everlasting inheritance.  We do not deny<lb/> ourselves the pleasing hope and the full realization of the promise<lb/> of its becoming&#44; eventually&#44; the prevailing and universal faith&#59;<lb/> but at the present time it is only a <hi rend="italics">Jewish</hi> religion&#44; made for the<lb/> 3&#42;</p>

				<p>Israelite.  It is to the Jew the religion derived from the past&#59;<lb/> but it will be to the world at large the religion of the future.<lb/>  The Israelite is encouraged to adhere to his faith by the convic&#45;<lb/>tions of the past and the hopes of the future.  Thus <placeName>Sinai</placeName> is the<lb/> fountain from which he gathers his life&#44; and the <placeName>Mount of Olives</placeName>&#44;<lb/> flourishing in all the vital grandeur which God has promised to<lb/> endow it with&#44; is his incentive to continue faithful and zealous in<lb/> the service of his faith.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Judaism does not derive its life from the present.  What is<lb/> there&#44; my friends&#44; in the present agitated state of the world&#44; in<lb/> its theories and practices of religion&#44; to commend itself to the<lb/> Israelite&#63;  Answer all those that feel enchanted by the spirit<lb/> of the age&#59; answer all those who would wish the Synagogue to<lb/> undergo an entire remodeling from its ancient standard&#44; and to<lb/> adapt itself to the fancies of the age&#59; answer all those who would<lb/> wish the Synagogue not to draw its life&#45;current from the rising<lb/> and swelling waves of a future sea of glory&#44; which shall cover the<lb/> earth with its streams of knowledge and virtue&#44; and would have<lb/> it chain itself down to the materiality of the present age&#33;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">No&#44; no&#59; the Synagogue must not be changed&#59; it must stand as<lb/> the true exponent of the principles&#44; the dogmas&#44; the historical<lb/> recollections of the past&#44; and the hopes&#44; the solemn&#44; the sacred<lb/> and sublime hopes and wishes&#44; of the future of <placeName>Israel</placeName>.  It must<lb/> stand as a monumental record&#44; recording the exploits&#44; the trials&#44;<lb/> the vicissitudes&#44; the calamities&#44; and the sufferings which our peo&#45;<lb/>ple suffered and patiently endured&#44; in behalf of their glorious<lb/> faith&#44; and also as a glorious bequest to our sons and daughters&#44;<lb/> to lead them in the same path of hope and trust in the certain<lb/> promises of a God of truth&#44; who has promised to send in the Re&#45;<lb/>deemer to gather us together to the &#34;land which He has given<lb/> unto us&#44; as He has sworn unto our fathers&#44; a land flowing with<lb/> milk and honey.&#34;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">And is there any thing unreasonable in handing down the<lb/> Synagogue in this form&#63;  Let those who differ with us maintain<lb/> the opposite view&#44; but as for us&#44; let <hi rend="italics">our</hi> reason and the assurances<lb/> given us by God&#44; through His prophets&#44; be our guide.  Do not<lb/> think it strange that I should employ the term reason in this con&#45;<lb/>nection.  Reason aided by the word of God is a legitimate arbiter</p>

				<p>in matters of this kind&#44; and in fact&#44; there is nothing in Scripture<lb/> which is opposed to true reason.  Reason&#44; then&#44; is supported by<lb/> Scripture.  Why should I not hope for the final triumph of our<lb/> faith in accordance with the prediction of HOLY WRIT&#63;  Our rea&#45;<lb/>son&#44; my friends&#44; is influenced by history.  We are taught&#44; edu&#45;<lb/>cated&#44; and led by the history of the past.  The history of Juda&#45;<lb/>ism teaches the Israelite to believe that he is under the care of<lb/> a God.  There is also a feeling in the heart of man which teaches<lb/> him to rely on the efficacy of repentance&#44; and the reconciliation<lb/> which he can effect thereby with his Maker.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Why&#44; then&#44; dost thou&#44; unbeliever&#44; wish me to give up my hopes<lb/> of a glorious future&#63;  Why dost thou wish <placeName>Israel</placeName> to abandon the<lb/> hope of a restoration to the land of promise&#63;  God is good and<lb/> merciful.  He brought our fathers to <placeName>Palestine</placeName>&#44; in virtue of a<lb/> promise He made to their ancestors.  He promised to keep them<lb/> there if they would obey His voice&#44; to disperse them if they dis&#45;<lb/>obeyed Him&#59; but He is a God of mercy&#59; and He also assured<lb/> them that He would again settle their children in their land&#44; if<lb/> they would return to Him with a full heart.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Man requires an incentive to virtue and repentance.  Cut off<lb/> the incentive&#44; and you destroy the influence of repentance.  Would<lb/> you have <placeName>Israel</placeName> think the prophets deceivers&#44; and thereby harden<lb/> their hearts against repentance&#63;  I hope not&#33;  But whatever may<lb/> be the views of others&#44; I trust that you&#44; my brethren&#44; will look<lb/> upon the Synagogue as a monument of the past&#44; and a beacon&#45;<lb/>light to the future.  Yes&#59; let it be a monument teaching all the<lb/> moral as well as religious duties.  When you look upon the very<lb/> timbers of this house&#44; let it remind you of the cedars of <placeName>Lebanon</placeName>&#44;<lb/> the mighty oaks which are formed by the breath of God&#59; let the<lb/> stones remind you of the Rock of ages&#59; let the brass and other<lb/> metallic substances of this place&#44; bring to your mind the omnipo&#45;<lb/>tence of God&#44; and that the most powerful of all earthly things<lb/> will vanish and melt by the breath of the Lord.  In every respect&#44;<lb/> this house should be a monument reminding us of the love&#44; the<lb/> mercy&#44; and the profound solicitude of God.  According to some<lb/> of our teachers&#44; the temple was constructed after the model of<lb/> the heavens&#44; to remind us of the supreme wisdom of God.  Let the<lb/> Synagogue no less remind us of the wisdom and the grace of that</p>

				<p>Being who gave us a law and a creed by which we should live<lb/> and be happy&#59;&#8212;yea&#44; when we enter the Synagogue let it be to us<lb/> a monument reminding us of the abiding care and protection of<lb/> our heavenly Father&#44; who has sustained us amidst all the trials to<lb/> which our people have been for ages exposed&#59; and let us&#44; above<lb/> all&#44; look upon the Synagogue not as a mere structure designed<lb/> by the art and skill of man&#44; but as a principle to be transmitted<lb/> to our children&#44; so that they may be led to reflect that God&#39;s<lb/> abode is in heaven&#44; and that He in His Providence will again<lb/> bless the land which He gave unto us&#44; as He swore &#34;unto our<lb/> fathers&#44; a land flowing with milk and honey.&#34;</p>

And we<lb/> come now to the essential question&#44; What should we be to the<lb/> Synagogue&#63;  This is at once met by the reply&#44; We should be its<lb/> supporters.  But in using this word&#44; I do not mean that we are to<lb/> be its supporters in a financial point of view alone.  We may<lb/> endow it ever so richly&#59; we may offer and contribute ever so liber&#45;<lb/>ally&#59; we may build its walls of granite&#44; its columns of marble&#44;<lb/> its roof of the strongest timbers.  We may use the strongest<lb/> cement&#44; in causing its various parts to adhere.  We may employ<lb/> workmen to excel the artisans of <placeName>Tyre</placeName>.  We may lay the strong&#45;<lb/>est materials in the known world&#44; and the most costly jewels and<lb/> precious stones&#44; under contribution&#58; and yet the house will not<lb/> endure.  If the Synagogue should be to us a monument of the<lb/> past&#44; then we should no less be to the Synagogue the pillars by<lb/> which it may stand firm before the Lord.  If we devote ourselves<lb/> to the <hi rend="italics">service</hi> of the Synagogue&#44; then will it endure&#59; for the prin&#45;<lb/>ciples&#44; of which the building is but the reflex&#44; will stand and endure<lb/> forever&#44;&#8212;received&#44; acknowledged&#44; and revered by our children<lb/> and children&#39;s children&#59; and though these walls shall have crum&#45;<lb/>bled into dust&#44; though not one single <sic>vestage</sic> of this place shall be<lb/> left&#44; yet&#44; the spiritual Synagogue&#44; which is the real Synagogue&#44;<lb/> will exist&#44; supported by the columns of faith&#44; charity&#44; and love.<lb/>  The sanctuary of eternal truth will be preserved from the ravages<lb/> of time&#44; the influences of modern change&#44; and the capricious and<lb/> whimsical agencies brought to bear upon every other institution</p>

And why was this&#63;  Was it from any<lb/> defect in the builder&#39;s skill&#63;  Did the workmen not honestly per&#45;<lb/>form their allotted labor&#63;  No&#33; no&#33; whatever human skill could<lb/> do was done&#59; whatever could be effected towards rearing a strong<lb/> and powerful monument of earthly grandeur&#44; was ably&#44; diligently&#44;<lb/> and efficiently executed&#59; but there was one thing omitted&#8212;the<lb/> columns which supported the building were not strong enough&#44;&#8212;<lb/> they were not made of the right material&#8212;they were made of<lb/> stone&#44; of the cold&#44; lifeless granite&#8212;sad emblem of death&#44;&#8212;they<lb/> were made of dead materials&#44; and not out of the living pillars of<lb/> affection and duty.  Oh&#33; if <placeName>Israel</placeName> had supported the sanctuary<lb/> with its <hi rend="italics">living</hi> heart&#59; if&#44; instead of turning a deaf ear to the<lb/> voice of God&#44; it had listened&#44; respected&#44; and obeyed&#58; its vital<lb/> heart would have been the best support to the Temple and its<lb/> holy altar.  Oh&#33; my friends&#44; be ye then monuments to the Syna&#45;<lb/>gogue&#44; and rear your children in the faith of the true and living<lb/> God&#44; so that by you&#44; and after your day has been spent&#44; by your<lb/> children&#44; the Synagogue may be firmly established.</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">What the Synagogue needs is zealous hearts&#44; devoted souls&#44;<lb/> and pious minds&#59; these are its best and most reliable pillars.  Oh&#33;<lb/> then&#44; come to the house of God&#44; and be its strength and support.<lb/>  Desert it not&#44; but maintain it with the truth of a devoted and<lb/> zealous attachment&#59; sustain it with your hearts&#59; uphold it by<lb/> professing here and elsewhere&#44; the eternal principles of our holy<lb/> and glorious creed&#58; then shall it stand a proud and lasting pinnacle<lb/> to the majesty&#44; the glory&#44; and the goodness of <placeName>Israel&#39;s</placeName> God&#44;&#8212;yea&#44;<lb/> then shall it stand as a pillar directing us to the abode of God<lb/> which is in heaven&#44; from whence He will look down upon His<lb/> people <placeName>Israel</placeName>&#44; and bless them and the land which He has given<lb/> unto them&#44; as He swore unto their fathers&#44; a land flowing with<lb/> milk and honey.</p>

			<p rend="indent(1)">And now let us pray&#44; that the Lord may be with us as He was<lb/> with our fathers&#44; to direct our hearts to love and fear Him&#44; and<lb/> preserve us from all evil.  May he also strengthen our minds&#44;<lb/> that we may know Him&#44; serve Him&#44; and love Him&#44; and maintain<lb/> steadfast the Truth in all its integrity and purity.  <hi rend="italics">Amen</hi>.</p>
