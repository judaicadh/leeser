                    <persName>Reverend<lb/> Isidor Frankel</persName>, and <persName>Messrs. Joseph
                    Einstein</persName> and <persName>Jacob Mayer</persName> President<lb/> and Vice
                President of Rodef Sholem; <persName role="author">Reverend Solomon
                    Jacobs</persName>,<lb/> and <persName>Mr. Harris Coleman</persName> President of
                the Beth Israel; <persName>Reverend L.<lb/> Naumburg</persName>, and <persName>Mr.
                    Adolph Klopfer</persName> President of the Kenesseth Israel;<lb/> and the
                    <persName>Reverend S. C. Noot</persName>, and <persName>Mr. Henry De
                    Boer</persName> President of the<lb/> Bnai Israel Synagogues, besides many
                members of the respective con-<lb/>gregations, including the Mikve Israel, the
                oldest in the city, as also a<lb/> large number of non-Israelites. Although it was
                hoped that the service<lb/> would commence at five P. M. precisely, some little
                delay took place<lb/> owing to the late arrival of many persons; but at about 20
                minutes past<lb/> that hour an overture, solemn and appropriate, was commenced by
                the</p>

            <p>band, led by <persName>Mr. A. Scherzer</persName>, an Israelite well known for his
                skill in<lb/> the tuneful art; and while this was being executed the Minister
                fol-<lb/>lowed by six members of the congregation, each bearing a <hi rend="italics"
                    >Sepher To</hi>-<lb/><hi rend="italics">rah</hi>, approached the right entrance
                door of the main hall. When the<lb/> music ceased the customary knocks were given to
                ask admittance within<lb/> the precincts of the sanctuary, and the usual verse,
                "Open for me the gates<lb/> of righteousness," &amp;c., was recited, when
                    <persName>Rev. Mr. Frankel</persName> responded<lb/> "This is the gate of the
                Lord," &amp;c., while the procession entered and<lb/> proceeded to the Tebah. The
                choir attached to the Rodef Sholem<lb/> Synagogue then sang <add>ברוך הבא</add>,
                "Blessed be he who cometh in the name<lb/> of the Lord," &amp;c. This being
                completed, the grace <add>שהחינו</add> (<hi rend="italics">Shehecheyanu</hi>)<lb/>
                was recited by the Hazan, while <persName>Mr. M. D. Cohen</persName> the Secretary
                of our<lb/> congregation lighted the Perpetual Lamp (<add>נר תמיד</add>) as a
                descendant of<lb/>
                <persName>Aaron</persName>; and <persName>Mr. Joseph Einstein</persName> opened the
                doors of the Ark. Next<lb/> followed <add>אודך</add> "I will thank thee," &amp;c.,
                by the choir. A symphony was<lb/> then performed by the band, and the Bearers of the
                Law-books, having<lb/> changed according to the printed programme which had been
                generally<lb/> distributed, Psalm xxx. was sung by the choir, while the
                procession<lb/> moved round the Tebah for the first circuit. After another piece
                of<lb/> music, Psalm cxxvii. followed for the second circuit; after which
                    <add>ימלך</add><lb/> "The Lord will reign," &amp;c., and Psalm xxix. were
                chaunted by the con-<lb/>gregation, while the Sepharim were carried to and deposited
                in the Ark.<lb/> The Hazan then recited <add>שובה</add>, and this was followed by
                    <add>עץ חײם היא</add> by<lb/> the choir, then by music from the band; in the

                    >Hechal</hi>, and when the sound of<lb/> the instruments had ceased, he
                delivered the following address, which<lb/> is given, by request, in our pages:</p>
            <p rend="align(center)">THE HOUSE OF THE TRUE GOD.</p>
            <p>BROTHERS OF THE HOUSE OF <placeName>ISRAEL</placeName>:</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">WE have assembled to-day for the first time in this house, to<lb/>
                dedicate it to the worship of the True God, to Him who created<lb/> the heavens and
                the earth and all which fills universal space;<lb/> and we accordingly devote it,
                during the time that we or other<lb/> Israelites have possession of this building,
                to the service of the<lb/> Most High, in order that His NAME may here be invoked by
                all<lb/> who may desire to associate with us in the adoration of the Being<lb/>
                whose providence cares for all, and whose omniscience surveys all<lb/> the secrets
                of the hearts of men.</p>

            <p rend="align(center)">3</p>
            <p>as a new association of His adorers, with our wives and little<lb/> ones, to declare
                that we also desire to be known as a special<lb/> society among other communities of
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>, as men devoted to<lb/> that cause which was
                handed down from the most ancient days<lb/> as an heir-loom of the descendants of
                    <persName>Abraham</persName>; and that we are<lb/> ready to labor with a
                thorough good-will, with united hearts and<lb/> souls, for the maintenance of the
                blessed faith which has been our<lb/> life and preservation, even from the day that
                it was entrusted to<lb/> our safe-keeping when we were assembled at the foot of
                    <placeName>Horeb</placeName>,<lb/> until this hour when we are congregated in
                this house which we<lb/> have called that of the TRUE GOD, of Him who was, who is,
                and<lb/> who will be. It is therefore a momentous occasion which has called<lb/> us
                together, and it well deserves to be pondered on, that it may<lb/> never depart from
                our memory, while the spirit within us is<lb/> united to the perishable frame, and
                the divine spark which con-<lb/>stitutes our life is connected with the mortal clay
                which is its<lb/> dwelling, and that the recollection may accompany us to the<lb/>
                moment when the angel of death comes to release the soul to<lb/> bear it away to its
                resting place at the foot of Mercy's throne.—<lb/> Let us take for our text
                    <persName>Joshua</persName> xxii. 34:</p>
            <p><add>ויקראו בני ראובן ובני נד למזבח כי עד ה׳האלהים</add>:</p>
            <p>"And the children of <persName>Reuben</persName> and the children of
                    <persName>Gad</persName> called the altar<lb/> ("Ed"); for (they said) it is a
                witness between us that the Eternal One<lb/> is God."</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">This passage occurs in one of the last chapters of the book of<lb/>
                <persName>Joshua</persName>, and is the conclusion of the history of the altar which
                the<lb/> two and half tribes whose domain was on the <placeName>east side of the
                    Jordan</placeName><lb/> had erected on the bank of that river, when they
                returned to their<lb/> homes after having assisted the western tribes in conquering
                the<lb/> land of <placeName>Canaan</placeName>. It is well known to you, that no
                altar was per-<lb/>mitted to be erected in the whole country of
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName> besides the<lb/> one which was near the
                tabernacle, and later, the temple on <placeName>Mo-<lb/>riah</placeName>. When,
                therefore, news was brought to the other Israelites<lb/> of this occurrence, they at
                once assembled at <placeName>Shiloh</placeName> to send out<lb/> an army against
                what they thought the rebellious tribes to coerce<lb/> them to obedience. But before
                proceeding to such extremes they<lb/> dispatched a deputation of eleven of the
                principal chiefs, among<lb/> whom was the zealous <persName>Phineas</persName>,
                prudent as he was daring, to</p>
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p rend="align(center)">4</p>
            <p>remonstrate with the men of <persName>Reuben</persName> and their confederates
                on<lb/> account of the great transgression of which they presumed them<lb/> guilty.
                These, however, answered deprecatingly and said: "The<lb/> God of gods, the Eternal
                One, the God of gods, the Eternal One,<lb/> he knoweth, and
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName> also shall know: if it be in rebellion, or<lb/> if
                in transgression against the Lord, (aid us not this day,) that<lb/> we have built us
                an altar to turn away from following the Lord;<lb/> or if to offer thereon burnt
                offering or meat offering, or if to offer<lb/> thereon peace-offerings, may the Lord
                himself require it." In<lb/> the same strain they continued to asseverate their good
                intentions,<lb/> and finished by saying that it should be regarded as a
                perpetual<lb/> testimony between the portions of Israelites divided from each<lb/>
                other by the <placeName>Jordan</placeName>, that both the ones and the others
                believed<lb/> in the same God whom they all then adored. And when
                    <persName>Phineas</persName><lb/> and his companions had been gratified by this
                declaration of<lb/> faith, and had departed for their homes, the trans-Jordanic
                tribes<lb/> gave to the altar the name which designated it to be to them a<lb/>
                testimony, that in every possible contingency of life the Lord<lb/> should be alone
                their God, and that they would regard His altar<lb/> at the tabernacle as the only
                centre of worship; thus pledging<lb/> themselves to offer up their devotions solely
                after the manner<lb/> laid down in the divine law. It is well to understand
                distinctly<lb/> the condition of the world when the Reubenites and their
                imme-<lb/>diate confederates made this avowal;—the legislation of
                    <placeName>Sinai</placeName><lb/> was yet new, and they were only the second
                generation that had<lb/> become familiar with it; all around them, nay, in their own
                coun-<lb/>try and neighborhood, were many tribes that <sic>worshipped</sic>
                idols,<lb/> indulged in carnal practices interdicted by the Mosaic law, and in<lb/>
                brief, were as different in thought and action from the standard<lb/> of
                righteousness which they had themselves received, as it is pos-<lb/>sible to be.
                They were therefore exposed to many temptations<lb/> to fall of by degrees from the
                road of life they had traveled un-<lb/>der <persName>Moses</persName> and
                    <persName>Joshua</persName>, and to become either like the Egyptians<lb/> in
                whose land they had been bondsmen, or like the Canaanites<lb/> among whom they then
                dwelt. It was no doubt this considera-<lb/>tion which impelled the assembled
                Israelites at <placeName>Shiloh</placeName> to endeavor<lb/> to crush what they
                supposed the incipient infection of pagan life<lb/> by a terrible blow, though a
                universal carnage of the rebels</p>
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p rend="align(center)">5</p>
            <p>might be the result. But the suspected tribes, on the contrary,<lb/> then declared
                that they did not desire to multiply places of sacri-<lb/>fice after the manner of
                the <sic>idolators</sic>, who fancied that frequent<lb/> acts of devotion, performed
                in many places, were requisite to<lb/> propitiate their gods; but that they would,
                after the simpler<lb/> fashion of the Scripture-commands, resort only to the
                spot<lb/> chosen by God out of all their tribes to offer up there and there<lb/>
                alone all that had been commanded, and just as it had been or-<lb/>dained; and that
                the very altar they had erected on the banks<lb/> of the
                    <placeName>Jordan</placeName>, standing as it should, in solitude and silence,
                with-<lb/>out smoke to arise from its hearth, without a priest to keep watch<lb/>
                near it, without the festive crowd to encamp in its precincts on<lb/> the stated
                seasons of pilgrimage, should prove in the strongest<lb/> manner, that the structure
                was merely a testimony to all behold-<lb/>ers, that the stream which divides
                    <placeName>Palestine</placeName> into two unequal<lb/> parts, did not separate
                the people into two sects; but that both<lb/> the inhabitants of the
                    <placeName>East</placeName> and the <placeName>West</placeName> were bound
                together by<lb/> the ties of one faith, having one country, one origin, one
                religion,<lb/> one altar, and one God!</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">We, too, my friends, stand here this day before the world with<lb/>
                a new structure which we have dedicated to the cause of religion;<lb/> but it is not
                a new faith which is to be <sic>symbolised</sic> here, no new<lb/> worship which is
                to be introduced within these walls; and all<lb/>
                <placeName>Israel</placeName>, if all were witnesses here this day, should see,
                that<lb/> neither in rebellion, nor in transgression against the Most High,<lb/> nor
                in malevolence towards our brothers of other societies has<lb/> the work been begun
                and thus far completed; but to cement the<lb/> stronger our adherence to God's most
                holy law, and to fortify<lb/> ourselves in the attachment to the whole household of
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>,<lb/> which was once so strong and beautiful, but
                which has, alas! so<lb/> greatly waned in the troublous times through which we have
                had<lb/> to pass. You must not forget, my brothers, that, though we are<lb/> not
                surrounded by the idols of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, nor by the
                abominations<lb/> of <placeName>Canaan</placeName>, our warfare with the world
                without is not accomplished.<lb/> Our faith has its enemies in the circumstance that
                we are still a<lb/> peculiar people, with laws which separate us from the board
                and<lb/> communion of non-Israelites; in the fact that we adore a NAME<lb/> who is
                not yet enthroned alone and solely in the hearts of man,</p>
            <p rend="align(center)">1*</p>
            <pb n="6"/>
            <p rend="align(center)">6</p>
            <p>though He is alone and solely the TRUE GOD, the Creator of all<lb/> things. Political
                power and influence are, as such, no necessary<lb/> appendage to the household of
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>; but we are scattered,<lb/> strewn like the seed
                from the pouch of the <sic>ploughman</sic>, over the<lb/> surface of the earth, to
                be controlled and trammeled by all who<lb/> differ from us, and who unite in this,
                when even differing ever so<lb/> widely among themselves, that it is for the benefit
                of the world<lb/> at large, that the Hebrew race should be watched and kept
                with-<lb/>in the narrowest possible bounds, lest their creed should spread,<lb/> and
                their religion attain to that degree of power, that it might<lb/> work an injury
                unto those modes of thought and practice to<lb/> which the various sections of
                mankind are devoted. This hostil-<lb/>ity is at the same time not always a mere
                passive dislike, which<lb/> shows itself in an unwillingness to associate with us on
                terms of<lb/> equality, and to grant us that weight in the historical
                develop-<lb/>ment of the world which would of right be due to our industry,<lb/>
                probity, and intelligence, or in short, to treat us as one man<lb/> usually treats
                the other; but in many quarters of the globe active<lb/> measures of repression and
                coercion are resorted to, in order to<lb/> vex us with restraints and burdens which
                others are exempt from,<lb/> and to offer all possible inducements to those, whose
                heart is not<lb/> sincere, to forsake a faith which brings no worldly gain, and
                to<lb/> cast off the connection with a people which the laws of the land<lb/> and
                public prejudice stigmatize as inferior to the other classes of<lb/> the
                inhabitants. Though millions of martyrs have at all periods<lb/> of history
                testified by their death, under incredible tortures of<lb/> body and mind, that no
                suffering was capable to withdraw them<lb/> from their God and his law: still
                experience has proved that many<lb/> have yielded to the allurement of public
                offices to either become<lb/> apostates altogether, or to shape their conduct so
                that their Juda-<lb/>ism was rendered <sic>undistinguishable</sic> to the
                    <sic>unpractised</sic> eye, so<lb/> that such as these at times boast of having
                so well disguised their<lb/> inherited religion, as not to be suspected of belonging
                to its ad-<lb/>herents. Others again there are who daily make the amount of<lb/>
                duties to be performed less and less, because they fancy themselves<lb/> exempt from
                its behests in this enlightened age of the world, and<lb/> so approximate the
                Gentile freedom from the precepts, that they<lb/> gradually lapse into infidelity,
                or they unconsciously almost join</p>

            <p>one of the sects around them, and this perhaps, not immediately<lb/> in their own
                persons, but in those of their offspring, who, never<lb/> having been initiated into
                the practice of the duties, and never<lb/> having been imbued with the full force
                and beauty of the doc-<lb/>trines which lie as the basis of our lives, have no
                safeguard to<lb/> ward off temptation, nor any tangible reasons for remaining
                nom-<lb/>inally Jews when all the substance has long since been evaporated<lb/> into
                air in the life of their progenitors, by a constantly more<lb/> accelerated process
                of spiritualizing those distinctive acts which,<lb/> by the scriptural enactments,
                ought to distinguish the conduct of<lb/> every son of <placeName>Israel</placeName>.
                This latter species of <sic>apostacy</sic> is more com-<lb/>mon where we enjoy a
                moderate or entire share of equality of<lb/> civil and political rights, than where
                we are oppressed and ex-<lb/>cluded from participating in the privileges of
                citizenship. The<lb/> very distance of the danger will bring us within its grasp.
                Tell<lb/> a man, when he begins to acquire wealth and distinction, that he<lb/> has
                taken the first step to banish his sons from the precincts of<lb/> the Synagogue,
                and he will exhibit all the appearances of offended<lb/> rectitude. For he will tell
                you, that he is engaged in a pursuit<lb/> which will exhibit him to the world as an
                ornament to human<lb/> nature; that he trusts, with the help of Heaven, to prove
                what the<lb/> Jew is capable of achieving if his genius is unchecked; and that<lb/>
                he will nevertheless take heed that all in his household shall<lb/> know that they
                are Israelites, the possessors of a faith of which<lb/> they should justly be proud.
                But if we look on him again at a<lb/> later period, we may find that he has by
                degrees relaxed the<lb/> strict discipline which once prevailed in his home; that he
                has<lb/> so many engagements, that he is not able to watch all the walks<lb/> in
                which his children tread the course of life; that while he toils<lb/> for large
                gains, or fame and position, they seek each their own<lb/> pleasures; become more
                and more strangers to the house of God;<lb/> lapse by degrees into non-Jewish
                society; form intimacies which<lb/> deaden the last spark of devotion in their
                souls; and that they<lb/> succeed, perchance, to withdraw their aged and now
                helpless<lb/> parents from the close communion with their brothers, ashamed<lb/> and
                degraded in their own estimation, or entrapped into actual<lb/> transgression, by
                the misconduct of those who, they once vainly<lb/> hoped, would perpetuate their

            <p>the descendants of <persName>Jacob</persName>. By this process of
                self-exaltation,<lb/> and a gradually increasing contempt for the association
                with<lb/> other Israelites, which led the children to cast off the little
                re-<lb/>straint the parental teaching had at first imposed on them, families<lb/>
                once numerous among us are approaching their extinction, and<lb/> it is possible
                that in a few generations not one of them will be<lb/> left to swear fealty to the
                Eternal God. Yet the transition was<lb/> very slow at first; in the beginning it was
                perhaps a substitution<lb/> of the first for the seventh day of the week as the
                    <date>Sabbath</date> of the<lb/> Lord; next visiting places of instruction where
                a faith different<lb/> from ours was taught; then a gradual withdrawal from those
                who<lb/> were professing Jews, because they stood not as high in the world's<lb/>
                estimation; then the covenant of <persName>Abraham</persName> was neglected; or<lb/>
                the daughter of the son of the stranger entered into family rela-<lb/>tions with the
                child of <persName>Jacob</persName>; and thus the way was left open<lb/> for a quiet
                mingling as a member with one of the non-Jewish<lb/> associations; and in this way a
                name and a family have perished<lb/> in <placeName>Israel</placeName>.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">But not alone those in an exalted position are thus lost to us;<lb/>
                many in inferior positions imitate the evil example set them by<lb/> the others; and
                they mingle with the debauchee and the outcast,<lb/> there to indulge their wicked
                inclinations, forsaking thereby the<lb/> home where humble piety dwells, and
                departing from the path of<lb/> the law, to their entire ruin. It is not necessary
                to produce illustra-<lb/>tions from our experience to prove the truth of what I have
                just<lb/> uttered; for all of you may, if they will tax their memory, verify<lb/> my
                words by what has fallen under their own observation; and<lb/> they will therefore
                acknowledge that we are not exempt from<lb/> danger, in the present posture of
                events, though we live not in<lb/> the midst of idolators, as did the Reubenites
                when they built the<lb/> altar near the <placeName>Jordan</placeName>. Let us,
                therefore, avail ourselves of this<lb/> occasion to reflect on the work before us.
                We enter this day into<lb/> a covenant with God, tacitly, if not in words, to be
                faithful to<lb/> Him, and to preserve the law "which is an inheritance of the<lb/>
                congregation of <persName>Jacob</persName>" for those who are to come after us.
                We<lb/> bind ourselves, by devoting this house especially to the attribute<lb/> of
                "Truth," which is the seal of the Creator under which He call-<lb/>ed the world into
                being, that we will guard the faith with all our</p>

            <p>strength against the encroachment of error from whatever side<lb/> this might
                threaten it, and to show ourselves truthful in single-<lb/>ness of devotion to the
                precepts we have received. We shall be<lb/> indeed approached with appeals as to the
                unreasonableness of<lb/> an adherence to antiquated notions and practices; but this
                is the<lb/> very purpose which ought to engage us; and to succeed we ought<lb/> to
                search into what has come down from the days of antiquity.<lb/> Our very name is as
                ancient as history. <persName>Abraham</persName> was surnamed<lb/> the <hi
                    rend="italics">Hebrew</hi>, and this designation yet denotes his descendants;<lb/>
                <persName>Jacob</persName> was <sic>blest</sic> and called
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>, and we are therefore the proper<lb/> Israelites
                of whose future so much is said in the Holy Scriptures,<lb/> and of whom so many
                hopeful anticipations are entertained. It<lb/> would be now insulting to sound human
                reason to pause here to<lb/> prove that it would be impossible to preserve the
                identity of the<lb/> Israelites without the bond of the law; as without this,
                they<lb/> would soon cease to be distinguishable among the rest of man-<lb/>kind,
                and would thus disappear as agents from the work of history.<lb/> But to check the
                deterioration which was just alluded to, and to<lb/> preserve the identity of our
                race, which many have lost already,<lb/> we ought to resort to those measures which
                were found so effica-<lb/>cious in the days of <persName>Hezekiah</persName> and
                    <persName>Josiah</persName>, kings of <placeName>Judah</placeName>, and<lb/> of
                    <persName>Ezra</persName> and <persName>Nehemiah</persName>, when the Babylonian
                captivity had been<lb/> terminated by the re-building of the temple of
                    <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>. These<lb/> means were, first, a greater
                cordiality among the people, a more<lb/> intimate union for the purpose of
                furthering the observance of<lb/> the precepts of the Scriptures, and, secondly, an
                earnest endea-<lb/>vor to render all more familiar with the contents of the
                Scriptures<lb/> than they had been before. At a future day we shall no doubt<lb/>
                recur to this topic at greater length; our present purpose is<lb/> merely to sketch
                an outline of what is needed. When we were<lb/> still under one government, and had
                a country which we could<lb/> call our own, the heads of the state, such as judges,
                kings, princes,<lb/> governors, and high-priests, could, by their political power
                and<lb/> influence, contribute largely to the direct improvement of religion<lb/>
                and morals; hence we find that, in proportion as our rulers were<lb/> virtuous and
                pious, the people were so likewise. But at present,<lb/> other influences must be
                brought to bear on us, and they are,<lb/> simply, association and individual
                exertions. As regards the</p>
            <pb n="10"/>
            <p rend="align(center)">10</p>
            <p>first, let us observe that no matter how great a mind may dwell<lb/> in any man, he
                cannot labor except in a very limited sphere; he<lb/> can be only in one place at a
                time, and he is therefore liable to<lb/> be counteracted and defeated by the next
                comer, not so much by<lb/> the superior power of the other, as by his own absence,
                through<lb/> which means his influence is overcome by, perhaps, the mere
                as-<lb/>surance and impudent, bold, assertions of the other. It is for<lb/> this
                reason nothing new, that public bodies exhibit the incon-<lb/>stancy of the sea, as
                they are swayed often, not by a positive<lb/> rule of right, but by the opinion of
                the latest teacher. To avoid<lb/> this uncertainty and constant fluctuation, it is
                necessary to asso-<lb/>ciate together on a basis of unvarying principles, and to
                establish<lb/> a rule which nothing shall be able to overthrow. You have
                at-<lb/>tempted to carry this into practice, my friends, in the constitution<lb/>
                you have adopted, by laying down the irrevocable rule that you<lb/> will, as a body,
                have only those prayers which the great lights of<lb/>
                <placeName>Israel</placeName> delighted to employ in their addressing Him "who
                sitteth on<lb/> the throne of mercy;" and in so doing, you also declare that
                you<lb/> will faithfully and truly abide by the principles which the words<lb/> of
                these prayers inculcate. You have farther declared that only<lb/> Israelites in
                practice shall have a controlling power in your as-<lb/>semblies; the doors of this
                house shall indeed stand open wide,<lb/> to admit every one, the righteous one and
                the sinner, the son of<lb/>
                <persName>Abraham</persName> and him whose parentage is not of
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>, to offer up<lb/> here their devotion, and to pour
                out their heart before the Lord<lb/> in joy or in sorrow; since God himself has
                taught us that his<lb/> house should be a house of prayer to all people. At the
                same<lb/> time it has been resolved on wisely, to exclude all from the con-<lb/>trol
                of affairs whose own conduct would stamp them as unfit to<lb/> be trusted with a
                voice in the religious concerns of <placeName>Israel</placeName>. Hav-<lb/>ing thus
                commenced, let us hope that you will feel the weight of<lb/> the obligation resting
                on you, and that you will resolve to leave<lb/> nothing untried to induce each other
                to be strict in the observance<lb/> of all those duties in which so many are
                deficient, especially<lb/> the keeping of the Lord's <date>Sabbath</date>, that this
                house may not be<lb/> empty, while those, who have an interest here, seek their
                worldly<lb/> gains in their places of business; we will trust that you will
                stimu-<lb/>late each other to give all the children a knowledge of their faith</p>
            <pb n="11"/>
            <p rend="align(center)">11</p>
            <p>and of the language of <placeName>Israel</placeName>, that, when they come hither,
                the<lb/> words of the prayers may be familiar to their ears, and not sound to<lb/>
                them like an unmeaning jargon which makes nothing but an un-<lb/>pleasant impression
                on the mind. But individual exertions must not<lb/> be omitted, nor should any one
                wait to move in the expectation that<lb/> the public will and ought to go first
                forward. Whatever strikes<lb/> either of you as useful and practicable, he ought to
                bring before<lb/> the community and request in a courteous manner their
                co-opera-<lb/>tion; and in case it does not meet with as prompt support as<lb/> he
                has perhaps a right to expect, he should endeavor to see what<lb/> he can do alone,
                and labor to awake public attention to his plan,<lb/> and in the meanwhile
                accomplish all that an individual, single-<lb/>handed, is able to attain.
                Persuasion, honesty of purpose, and<lb/> unflagging industry, are almost unfailing
                means in insuring suc-<lb/>cess; and the empire of religion also needs servants
                animated<lb/> with these qualities to achieve a triumph over the enemies that<lb/>
                oppose its progress.</p>

                for the truth as it was given to us from<lb/>

                towards the erection of this edifice<lb/> into a Jewish house of worship. Whatever
                may have been the<lb/> ordinary or extraordinary causes by which this consummation
                was<lb/> effected, can have nothing, and has nothing to do with my
                consi-<lb/>deration of the question under discussion. It is enough for me<lb/> to
                know that whenever a place of worship is established by the<lb/> children of
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>, a bright and luminous star is added to the<lb/>
                already shining and illustrious constellation of the Jewish race;<lb/> another
                appendage to the pure and spotless banner of the house<lb/> of
                    <persName>Jacob</persName>. It is enough for me to know that whenever and
                wher-<lb/>ever a Synagogue is erected, we have established another monu-<lb/>ment to
                the living and sacred truth of our holy faith and heaven-<lb/>born religion.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Yes, my brethren, I find an answer readily suggested to the<lb/>
                inquiry, in the fact that <add>ועשו לי מקרש ושכנתי בתוכם</add> when<lb/> Synagogues
                are spread over the land from where the sun rises<lb/> in the morning to the place
                where he sets in the evening, the<lb/> name of the Lord shall thereby be extolled.
                This is the reason<lb/> why this Synagogue has been established. There runs, my
                friends,<lb/> a holy current of feeling in the Jewish heart, which throbs,<lb/>
                expands, dilates, and seeks expression in an outward form.<lb/> There reigns a holy
                conviction in the Jewish mind, that God the<lb/> Creator is the Sovereign who alone
                should be adored;—and it is<lb/> this thought, this conviction, which clothes itself
                in an outward</p>
            <pb n="20"/>
            <p rend="align(center)">20</p>
            <p>garb, denominated public worship. It is this intensely felt sen-<lb/>sation which
                awakens in us the desire to multiply places of wor-<lb/>ship, wherein we can give
                expression to our most holy feelings.<lb/> If the Jew were really callous and
                indifferent about his faith, he<lb/> would not trouble himself about places of
                worship, he would not<lb/> incur the expense of multiplying houses of prayer. He
                might<lb/> say, "Whenever I feel disposed to pray, I can find some place of<lb/>
                worship where I can attend." But no, whatever may be his mo-<lb/>tives for not
                attending other places of worship already in exist-<lb/>ence, he cannot sit down in
                a state of indifference: he must be up<lb/> and doing, he must exemplify his love
                for his faith by the erection<lb/> of a place of worship where he can attend without
                any scruples.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Would you, my brethren, then know the reason why this place<lb/> of
                worship has been added to the many already in existence?<lb/> Then I answer, it is
                because proofs are being every day added of<lb/> the truth of the faith of
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>; because proofs are being every day<lb/> added
                that the spirit, the essence, the principles of the Jewish<lb/> religion hold a
                predominating sway, exercise a profoundly felt<lb/> influence in the Jewish
                breast.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">But again, let me ask, Why have we instituted this place of<lb/>
                worship? My friends, we have done so at the express command<lb/> of God. It is the
                bounden duty of Israelites to erect a house of<lb/> worship, in other words, a house
                for God to dwell therein. As<lb/> soon as the Israelite feels the conviction that he
                is under the<lb/> providential care and government of One sole and indivisible<lb/>
                God, then it is his duty to unite with his brethren in rendering<lb/> homage to that
                Being in a house dedicated to His worship. God<lb/> has commanded our fathers,
                    <add>בעל עקדה</add>, "Make me<lb/> a sanctuary, and I will dwell amongst them."
                We need not be<lb/> told by the philosopher, that a Being whose essence is
                incom-<lb/>prehensible, whose nature is beyond human ken, whose Divine<lb/>
                character is a profound mystery to us, who is omnipotent, omni-<lb/>scient, and
                omnipresent, cannot be circumscribed and confined<lb/> within the narrow limits of
                four walls. We need not be told by<lb/> the man of reason, that the creature cannot
                make a place for the<lb/> Creator; for the Scriptures themselves speak of the
                boundless<lb/> majesty of God,—and we require no better exponent of this idea<lb/>
                than the words of our text, in which we are directed to pray that</p>
            <pb n="21"/>
            <p rend="align(center)">21</p>
            <p>God, in His infinite goodness, may look down from heaven His<lb/> abode. Yea, my
                friends, heaven is His abode, the whole unlimit-<lb/>ed space of infinite worlds,
                the whole universal structure of<lb/> heaven and earth, and the illimitable regions
                of an infinite ex-<lb/>tension, which even the mind, in its ascending flights of
                bold ima-<lb/>gination, cannot reach—all this is filled with His glory. Full
                well<lb/> we know then, that this house cannot contain the majesty of God.<lb/> Why
                then have we built this house? We have done so, my friends,<lb/> that through this
                act of devotion the spirit of God may dwell in us.<lb/> A bright luminary in
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>, the author of Akedath Yizchak,<lb/> (<add>בית אל
                    אמת</add>) says, that our religion may be compared to a stupen-<lb/>dous
                building. In looking at it, we first gaze upon its materials,<lb/> next upon its
                order, next to its stability, and lastly its purpose.<lb/> In looking, my friends,
                at a Synagogue, both ideas, the ideas<lb/> connected with the characteristics of a
                building, and the charac-<lb/>teristics of our religion, are intimately associated.
                What is the<lb/> purpose of this building? The answer is self-evident,
                Religion!<lb/> What else, pride, or vanity, or ambition? No! no! religion,<lb/> the
                desire to accelerate the means of our approach to God, and<lb/> to bring the
                influence of His Divine spirit to reside in our midst;<lb/> this is the solemn
                purpose for which we have erected this house<lb/> of prayer. We can, in fact, my
                friends, form no better idea of<lb/> the purposes of the Synagogue, than in
                reflecting upon the say-<lb/>ing of some of the sages of
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>. Wherefore was the temple<lb/> built in
                    <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>? Because, they say, it was erected in a
                direct<lb/> line with the sanctum sanctorum of heaven.
                    <placeName>Palestine</placeName>, my friends,<lb/> is situated in the centre of
                the world. As God, therefore, who is<lb/> the real sanctuary and the concentration
                of holiness, is the centre<lb/> of all His great works, which derive life and
                consistency from Him<lb/> alone, and which would, without His sustaining breath,
                fall into<lb/> atoms and become consumed by the withering blast of His<lb/> anger:
                so is religion, which is symbolized by the earthly sanc-<lb/>tuary, the centre of
                the moral world. Without religion there<lb/> would be no morality. Without places of
                worship dedicated to<lb/> the God of <placeName>Israel</placeName>, there would be
                no true religion. The Syna-<lb/>gogue is the centre of true religion,—there men
                unite to adore<lb/> the true God, the Creator of heaven and earth,—there men
                de-<lb/>sire that life and sustaining breath which keep together the</p>
            <pb n="22"/>
            <p rend="align(center)">22</p>
            <p>moral and social fabric of the world,—there men learn those vital<lb/> principles and
                duties of love and friendship, which are the pillars<lb/> upon which the temple of
                harmony is firmly built. The Syna-<lb/>gogue should be built in a direct line with
                the sanctuary of Hea-<lb/>ven; so that the stream of God's love might flow from the
                peren-<lb/>nial spring of His Divine solicitude upon us, and refresh,
                invigo-<lb/>rate, and sustain our hearts. This, my friends, is the reason why<lb/>
                we have built this Synagogue. Oh! that it may always be the<lb/> centre around which
                our holiest emotions might cling. Oh! that<lb/> it may always stand in a direct line
                with the sanctuary of Heaven,<lb/> that the dews of love, mercy, and grace may
                descend and refresh<lb/> our hearts.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Secondly: What are the principles which should govern us in<lb/> the
                Synagogue? The difficulties which I might have encountered<lb/> in addressing any

                not experience. Thank God!<lb/> I am addressing my own brethren, one with me in the

                faith,<lb/>—and united by the same ties, having the same attachments,<lb/> the same
                fond hopes and aspirations, in whose hearts burn the<lb/> same intense flame of
                Sinaic fire, who live in the same reverence<lb/> for the undying word of God: yea, I
                address the sons of <persName>Jacob</persName><lb/> initiated into the covenant of
                    <persName>Abraham</persName>,—the daughters of the holy mothers<lb/> of
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName> who valued the word of inspiration more than they
                did<lb/> life, who knew how to spurn every attempt to draw them from<lb/> their
                faith, their plighted troth, who could frown upon princes<lb/> and despise palaces,
                who could find contentment and happiness<lb/> in the lot and condition of outcast
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>, who loved their God<lb/> in solitude, and hated
                affluence when it conflicted with their con-<lb/>scientous convictions of duty. Such
                sons and such daughters<lb/> am I, thank God, this day permitted to address; and
                speaking in<lb/> the name of such a religion and to such a people, I can have
                no<lb/> difficulty in defining the principles which should govern us in,<lb/> yea,

                bequeathed to<lb/> us by our fathers, which they derived from the pure and
                living<lb/> fount of <placeName>Sinai</placeName>, should incite us to renewed vigor
                and zeal in our<lb/> attachment to the house which we have dedicated to God?</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Remember, my friends, the name by which we have designated<lb/> this

                you in your pious and holy labor. The name<lb/> of this house is at once expressive
                of your duties and the princi-<lb/>ples which are to govern you here and elsewhere.

                the<lb/> principles which regulate us here be founded and exercised in<lb/> truth.
                Yes, my friends, the name of this house will best indicate<lb/> the principles which

            <p>depending solely upon what is termed the moral sense of right<lb/> and wrong, is at

            <p rend="indent(1)">This view is forcibly expressed, my brethren, in one of the

                    תצמח</add>:<lb/> "When the Deity was about to create man, the angels formed<lb/>
                themselves into companies. One said, Create him, the other said,<lb/> Create him
                not. Kindness said, Create him, seeing that he will<lb/> perform acts of
                beneficence; but Truth said, Create him not, for<lb/> he will be filled with lies.
                Charity said, Create him, for he will<lb/> perform offices of charity; but Peace
                said, Create him not, for he<lb/> will be full of strife; but the Eternal threw
                truth down upon<lb/> the earth, as it is written in <persName>Daniel</persName>:
                'And he cast truth down<lb/> upon the earth.'" In these few words, my friends, our
                sages de-<lb/>velop the whole theory of our moral and religious being. They<lb/>
                show us the antithesis of our nature. Man could not exist by<lb/> the means of a
                moral principle alone; for, while his nature might<lb/> at times prompt him to acts
                of benevolence, it would at others<lb/> falsify his professions of virtue; while he
                might at times be in-<lb/>clined to charity, strife, which is an inherent element of
                our<lb/> nature, would obtain an overwhelming influence over him, and<lb/> destroy
                the peaceful agency of love and charity. But truth, the<lb/> truth of religion, the
                truth of revelation, the truth as it has been<lb/> imparted to us by God, truth as
                it has been thrown down from<lb/> heaven to purify and enrich the earth with its

                broadcast upon the earth. Oh then, my friends,<lb/> stoop and raise it up; let it
                not lie there discarded and neglect-<lb/>ed; let it not become soiled and tarnished;
                let not the sand and<lb/> dirt of a worldly indifference cover and conceal the
                precious heir-<lb/>loom of our God. If you would only <add>צדק משמים נשקף</add> seek
                it<lb/> as hidden treasures,—nay, if you only bend your knee to it in-<lb/>stead of
                bending the knee to <persName>Baal</persName>, you will soon become enriched<lb/>
                and have gained the most costly treasure in the world. Only<lb/> stoop to pick it
                up. There it lies, open, free, accessible to all.<lb/> It is not in the heavens that
                thou shouldst say, Who will go up to<lb/> heaven and bring it to us? It is nigh at
                hand, surrounding the<lb/> whole world. The sands of the sea are not more abundant
                than<lb/> the truth of the word of God. The whole work of heaven and<lb/> earth bear
                evidence to that truth. It is to be found every where.<lb/> Graceful, beautiful, and
                brilliant, it shines forth from the sod on<lb/> which it has been cast by an
                Almighty hand. Like the crimson<lb/> violet, and other variegated blossoms which
                spring spontaneously<lb/> from the soil and shine resplendently in the sunlight sent
                from<lb/> heaven, the words of our Lord send up a hallowing influence, a<lb/>
                beautiful light, a bright, shining vividness, and an abundant life-<lb/>giving
                influence to all who seek the truth. Yes, the truth as it<lb/> came from God is
                universal, it is to be seen and felt every where,<lb/> not confined to one sphere,
                but abounding in every part of the<lb/> habitable globe. Like the gilded myriads of
                living creatures<lb/> that fly up from the earth and gambol and sport in the air,
                mak-<lb/>ing the atmosphere a scene of life and pleasure, so doth the truth,<lb/> as
                it was sent down to the earth, send up currents of life, filling<lb/> the air which
                we breathe with the blessings of joy and pleasure.<lb/> Oh then, my friends, in the
                name of that truth which is <placeName>Israel's</placeName><lb/> pride,
                    <placeName>Israel's</placeName> glory, and <placeName>Israel's</placeName>

                it; there it lies, ready at hand; as you would stoop to pick<lb/> up a bright,
                shining blossom, stoop and pick up the word of<lb/> truth; as you would pluck a rose
                and adorn your breast with it,<lb/> which after all will not live long, so pluck the
                truth from the<lb/> earth and press it to your hearts, and adorn yourselves with it;
                for<lb/> when there it shall live and not wither. And this is the princi-</p>

            <p rend="align(center)">27</p>
            <p>ple that should govern us in the Synagogue. Truth, the solemn<lb/> truth should
                govern us here. Here we come to give expression<lb/> to the truth, as it is felt
                within us. Here we come to make con-<lb/>fession of the truth which we may gather
                from the works of God.<lb/> But more especially here,—we come to imbibe the truth
                from<lb/> that living fount which you see before you (pointing to the ark).<lb/> We
                come here with no other principles but the principles of<lb/> truth. The hypocrite,
                the dissembler shall have no communion<lb/> with us. The utterer of deceits and lies
                shall not pollute this<lb/> sacred place. His foot shall not trample the truth of
                our God<lb/> under foot. No, before he walketh in here, he shall divest his
                feet<lb/> of the covering of sin and iniquity; he shall cleanse them in the<lb/>
                waters of purification, and in the naked simplicity of a regenerated<lb/> spirit,
                walk before the Lord, and stand upon the truth of an only<lb/> and indivisible
                God.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Let then truth be our watchword and our rallying cry. Let<lb/> it
                govern us in all our thoughts, sayings, and doings. Let it<lb/> never forsake us.
                Let it stimulate us in the cause of our holy<lb/> religion. Let it always be in our
                hearts, as well as uttered by the<lb/> word of our lips. Let it rise and grow like a

            <p rend="indent(1)">Let us now, my friends, look to the third question which we<lb/>
                have proposed to consider, viz: What should the Synagogue be<lb/> to us? This, my
                friends, is a very important consideration. Im-<lb/>portant for the moral points
                involved therein, as well as for the<lb/> historical considerations, as well as for
                the religious feature con-<lb/>nected with our destiny, as well for the past as for
                the future of<lb/> Judaism; for when we shall have considered this question
                well<lb/> in all its bearings, I am confident that you will see the Synagogue<lb/>
                not only in the light of a mere handsome building, not in the light<lb/> of a mere
                institution, subject like all other institutions, to the influ-<lb/>ence of change
                and improvement, but in the light of an eternal</p>
            <pb n="28"/>
            <p rend="align(center)">28</p>
            <p>principle, in the light of a living fact, a reality to be saved, pre-<lb/>served,
                watched, cared for, and handed down to posterity in all<lb/> the sublimity of its
                pristine integrity.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The Synagogue, my friends, should be to us a monumental re-<lb/>cord
                of the past; it should tend to connect the present with the<lb/> past. If there be
                one miracle palpably and evidently seen in<lb/> these days of scientific
                discoveries, when the folly and the wick-<lb/>edness of some men have led them to
                deny the agency of any<lb/> superhuman power in the rise and fall of nations, that
                miracle<lb/> is the existence of the Synagogue. For notwithstanding all the<lb/>
                efforts to destroy Judaism, which have been made from time to<lb/> time, and the
                interdicting of our worship, so as to merge us among<lb/> the other nations of the
                earth, the Synagogue still exists. Won-<lb/>derful testimony of Divine truth! There
                thou standest a mes-<lb/>senger of Heaven to proclaim the truth! There thou
                standest,<lb/> holding the olive branch of love and conciliation to all who
                shall<lb/> believe in the goodness and power of God! There thou standest,<lb/> in
                the native simplicity of thy own pure attribute of truth, de-<lb/>claiming that,
                though monuments, and thrones, and palaces, and<lb/> powers, and empires shall fall
                and crumble to the dust, thou wilt<lb/> stand as the appointed servant of God, until
                the day when all<lb/> men shall acknowledge the Unity of <hi rend="italics">one</hi>
                Eternal Power. The<lb/> Synagogue is the monument which connects our present with
                our<lb/> past history<lb/> therefore should it be preserved from foreign
                influ-<lb/>ences which belong not to the history of Judaism; therefore should<lb/>
                we come here to learn our duties. Yea, here we may see
                <placeName>Sinai</placeName><lb/> flaming in the fires of Heaven; here we may hear
                the thunders,<lb/> and listen to the trumpet notes which gathered our ancestors<lb/>
                round the holy scene; here by an historical evidence which the<lb/> Synagogue
                presents us of the facts of the history of revelation,<lb/> we may see with our
                mind's eye, and hearken with the Divine<lb/> faculty of our spirit to the amazing
                sound which filled our fathers'<lb/> hearts with love and veneration.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The Synagogue represents the principles taught by
                    <persName>Moses</persName> in<lb/> the wilderness, when the children of
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName> received the Law from<lb/> God. There they were
                told, "Not with you alone hath the Lord<lb/> made this covenant and this oath of
                denunciation, but with those<lb/> who stand here this day and those who stand not
                here this day."</p>

            <p>Well have our sages paraphrased this by saying, all the forth-<lb/>coming souls of
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName> were present on that occasion. Yes, my<lb/>
                brethren, the principles taught on that glorious day are as bind-<lb/>ing upon all
                the forthcoming generations of <placeName>Israel</placeName>, as if they had<lb/>
                been there;—and the <hi rend="italics">institutions</hi> of our faith, the
                Synagogues<lb/> and temples erected by <placeName>Israel</placeName>, have always
                been <hi rend="italics">monuments</hi> in<lb/> the life of
                    <placeName>Israel</placeName>, connecting the existing time with that on which<lb/>
                <placeName>Israel</placeName> received the Law. In the Temple stood that very ark
                of<lb/> the covenant which <persName>Moses</persName> commanded our fathers to make
                as a<lb/> testimony to the truth of revelation. There stood, also, the table<lb/> of
                show bread and other historical <sic>memetoes</sic>, connecting the<lb/> existing
                time with the giving of the word of God in the wilder-<lb/>ness of
                    <placeName>Sinai</placeName>; and even now, in our dispersion, we have
                memen-<lb/>toes of that glorious time. Here are read every <date>Sabbath</date>
                seven<lb/> portions of that Law which God gave our ancestors, so that the<lb/> whole
                is finished once every year, and renewed again; so that the<lb/> spirit of truth
                might thereby be sustained in <placeName>Israel</placeName>. Here we<lb/> are
                reminded, by historical associations, of <placeName>Israel's</placeName> new career.
                In<lb/> our prayers we recite those incidents of distress and happiness<lb/> which
                our fathers experienced, all leading us back, by successive<lb/> stages, to the
                period when <placeName>Israel</placeName> stood before <placeName>Sinai</placeName>;
                so that it<lb/> may, indeed, be figuratively said, <hi rend="italics">our souls</hi>
                were present at the<lb/> giving of the Law on <placeName>Sinai</placeName>.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">The Synagogue, then, should emphatically be looked upon as<lb/> a
                monumental record of the past.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Judaism, my friends, unlike any other system, derives its
                ex-<lb/>istence from two distinct ages—from the past and the future. It<lb/> lives
                    <hi rend="italics">in</hi> the present age, but not <hi rend="italics">by</hi>
                the present age. It has no-<lb/>thing in common with the present age. Like the
                people of whom<lb/>
                <persName>Balaam</persName> prophesied, "Behold this people shall dwell alone
                and<lb/> not be counted among the nations," so is Judaism, surrounded on<lb/> all
                sides with systems of faith, with religious ideas, and views of<lb/> public worship,
                but partakes of none. Its attribute is individu-<lb/>ality, its characteristic is
                its adaptation for the people to whom<lb/> it was given as their everlasting
                inheritance. We do not deny<lb/> ourselves the pleasing hope and the full
                realization of the promise<lb/> of its becoming, eventually, the prevailing and
                universal faith;<lb/> but at the present time it is only a <hi rend="italics"

            <p>Israelite. It is to the Jew the religion derived from the past;<lb/> but it will be
                to the world at large the religion of the future.<lb/> The Israelite is encouraged
                to adhere to his faith by the convic-<lb/>tions of the past and the hopes of the
                future. Thus <placeName>Sinai</placeName> is the<lb/> fountain from which he gathers
                his life, and the <placeName>Mount of Olives</placeName>,<lb/> flourishing in all
                the vital grandeur which God has promised to<lb/> endow it with, is his incentive to
                continue faithful and zealous in<lb/> the service of his faith.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Judaism does not derive its life from the present. What is<lb/>
                there, my friends, in the present agitated state of the world, in<lb/> its theories
                and practices of religion, to commend itself to the<lb/> Israelite? Answer all those
                that feel enchanted by the spirit<lb/> of the age; answer all those who would wish
                the Synagogue to<lb/> undergo an entire remodeling from its ancient standard, and
                to<lb/> adapt itself to the fancies of the age; answer all those who would<lb/> wish
                the Synagogue not to draw its life-current from the rising<lb/> and swelling waves
                of a future sea of glory, which shall cover the<lb/> earth with its streams of
                knowledge and virtue, and would have<lb/> it chain itself down to the materiality of
                the present age!</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">No, no; the Synagogue must not be changed; it must stand as<lb/> the

                the past, and the hopes, the solemn, the sacred<lb/> and sublime hopes and wishes,
                of the future of <placeName>Israel</placeName>. It must<lb/> stand as a monumental

                and the sufferings which our peo-<lb/>ple suffered and patiently endured, in behalf
                of their glorious<lb/> faith, and also as a glorious bequest to our sons and
                daughters,<lb/> to lead them in the same path of hope and trust in the certain<lb/>
                promises of a God of truth, who has promised to send in the Re-<lb/>deemer to gather

            <p>in matters of this kind, and in fact, there is nothing in Scripture<lb/> which is
                opposed to true reason. Reason, then, is supported by<lb/> Scripture. Why should I
                not hope for the final triumph of our<lb/> faith in accordance with the prediction
                of HOLY WRIT? Our rea-<lb/>son, my friends, is influenced by history. We are taught,
                edu-<lb/>cated, and led by the history of the past. The history of Juda-<lb/>ism
                teaches the Israelite to believe that he is under the care of<lb/> a God. There is
                also a feeling in the heart of man which teaches<lb/> him to rely on the efficacy of
                repentance, and the reconciliation<lb/> which he can effect thereby with his
                Maker.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Why, then, dost thou, unbeliever, wish me to give up my hopes<lb/>
                of a glorious future? Why dost thou wish <placeName>Israel</placeName> to abandon
                the<lb/> hope of a restoration to the land of promise? God is good and<lb/>
                merciful. He brought our fathers to <placeName>Palestine</placeName>, in virtue of
                a<lb/> promise He made to their ancestors. He promised to keep them<lb/> there if
                they would obey His voice, to disperse them if they dis-<lb/>obeyed Him; but He is a
                God of mercy; and He also assured<lb/> them that He would again settle their
                children in their land, if<lb/> they would return to Him with a full heart.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Man requires an incentive to virtue and repentance. Cut off<lb/> the
                incentive, and you destroy the influence of repentance. Would<lb/> you have

                harden<lb/> their hearts against repentance? I hope not! But whatever may<lb/> be
                the views of others, I trust that you, my brethren, will look<lb/> upon the

                above<lb/> all, look upon the Synagogue not as a mere structure designed<lb/> by the
                art and skill of man, but as a principle to be transmitted<lb/> to our children, so
                that they may be led to reflect that God's<lb/> abode is in heaven, and that He in
                His Providence will again<lb/> bless the land which He gave unto us, as He swore
                "unto our<lb/> fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey."</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">Lastly, what should we be to the Synagogue? We have
                con-<lb/>sidered, why we have erected a Synagogue; what principles should<lb/>
                govern us therein; what the Synagogue should be to us. And we<lb/> come now to the
                essential question, What should we be to the<lb/> Synagogue? This is at once met by
                the reply, We should be its<lb/> supporters. But in using this word, I do not mean
                that we are to<lb/> be its supporters in a financial point of view alone. We
                may<lb/> endow it ever so richly; we may offer and contribute ever so
                liber-<lb/>ally; we may build its walls of granite, its columns of marble,<lb/> its
                roof of the strongest timbers. We may use the strongest<lb/> cement, in causing its
                various parts to adhere. We may employ<lb/> workmen to excel the artisans of
                    <placeName>Tyre</placeName>. We may lay the strong-<lb/>est materials in the
                known world, and the most costly jewels and<lb/> precious stones, under
                contribution: and yet the house will not<lb/> endure. If the Synagogue should be to
                us a monument of the<lb/> past, then we should no less be to the Synagogue the
                pillars by<lb/> which it may stand firm before the Lord. If we devote ourselves<lb/>
                to the <hi rend="italics">service</hi> of the Synagogue, then will it endure; for
                the prin-<lb/>ciples, of which the building is but the reflex, will stand and
                endure<lb/> forever,—received, acknowledged, and revered by our children<lb/> and
                children's children; and though these walls shall have crum-<lb/>bled into dust,
                though not one single <sic>vestage</sic> of this place shall be<lb/> left, yet, the
                spiritual Synagogue, which is the real Synagogue,<lb/> will exist, supported by the
                columns of faith, charity, and love.<lb/> The sanctuary of eternal truth will be
                preserved from the ravages<lb/> of time, the influences of modern change, and the
                capricious and<lb/> whimsical agencies brought to bear upon every other
                institution</p>
            <pb n="33"/>
            <p rend="align(center)">33</p>
            <p>of the age; because supported by the pillars of an ardent faith,<lb/> it shall go
                down to posterity as their place of refuge in the hour<lb/> of danger and distress.
                The Temple of <persName>Solomon</persName> was strong; its<lb/> pillars mighty and
                stupendous; yet it fell. The altar of our<lb/> God on which were once sacrificed the
                oblations of a pious and<lb/> devoted people, who came to the sanctuary to serve
                their God,<lb/> became a pile of rubbish, and what was once the glory of God is<lb/>
                now a heap of ashes. And why was this? Was it from any<lb/> defect in the builder's
                skill? Did the workmen not honestly per-<lb/>form their allotted labor? No! no!
                whatever human skill could<lb/> do was done; whatever could be effected towards
                rearing a strong<lb/> and powerful monument of earthly grandeur, was ably,
                diligently,<lb/> and efficiently executed; but there was one thing omitted—the<lb/>
                columns which supported the building were not strong enough,—<lb/> they were not
                made of the right material—they were made of<lb/> stone, of the cold, lifeless
                granite—sad emblem of death,—they<lb/> were made of dead materials, and not out of
                the living pillars of<lb/> affection and duty. Oh! if <placeName>Israel</placeName>
                had supported the sanctuary<lb/> with its <hi rend="italics">living</hi> heart; if,
                instead of turning a deaf ear to the<lb/> voice of God, it had listened, respected,
                and obeyed: its vital<lb/> heart would have been the best support to the Temple and
                its<lb/> holy altar. Oh! my friends, be ye then monuments to the Syna-<lb/>gogue,
                and rear your children in the faith of the true and living<lb/> God, so that by you,
                and after your day has been spent, by your<lb/> children, the Synagogue may be
                firmly established.</p>
            <p rend="indent(1)">What the Synagogue needs is zealous hearts, devoted souls,<lb/> and
                pious minds; these are its best and most reliable pillars. Oh!<lb/> then, come to
                the house of God, and be its strength and support.<lb/> Desert it not, but maintain
                it with the truth of a devoted and<lb/> zealous attachment; sustain it with your
                hearts; uphold it by<lb/> professing here and elsewhere, the eternal principles of
                our holy<lb/> and glorious creed: then shall it stand a proud and lasting
                pinnacle<lb/> to the majesty, the glory, and the goodness of
                    <placeName>Israel's</placeName> God,—yea,<lb/> then shall it stand as a pillar
                directing us to the abode of God<lb/> which is in heaven, from whence He will look
                down upon His<lb/> people <placeName>Israel</placeName>, and bless them and the land
                which He has given<lb/> unto them, as He swore unto their fathers, a land flowing
                with<lb/> milk and honey.</p>

                with our fathers, to direct our hearts to love and fear Him, and<lb/> preserve us
                from all evil. May he also strengthen our minds,<lb/> that we may know Him, serve
