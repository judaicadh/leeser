                                        me to converse<lb/> with one so intimate with yourself.

                                        favorable impression upon me and my family. I could
                                        have<lb/> wished to have paid him more attention than he has
                                        afforded me<lb/> the opportunity of doing, but hope when he
                                        returns to <placeName>England</placeName><lb/> I shall see
                                        more of him. He has lunched twice with me at my<lb/> office
