            <p><persName>Sir Moses Montefiore Bart</persName> in a letter dated <date>November

                exists (at present) in the <placeName>Holy Lande</placeName><lb/> and they pray for
                relief in their distress, which has been mainly caused by the<lb/> increase of
                foreigners, decrease of assistance, very high price of provisions<lb/> and house
                rent, and the apprehension of a terrible war. Do, my dear sir,<lb/> exert yourself
                in their behalf.” These documents speak for themselves,<lb/> they require no
                additional remarks. The undersigned would fain<lb/> hope, that those members of our
                faith who have the means to assist<lb/> their brethren in distress, and who are ever
                ready to mitigate the pungency of grief,<lb/> will extend their benevolence to the
                poor in the land of Israel's past and<lb/> future glory. The undersigned would
                studiously avoid entering into so<lb/> complex a subject as to the propriety of
                their remaining on those (at present)<lb/> hospitable shores; he would merely state
                that they are there, and suffering all<lb/> the horrors of poverty, and that it is
                Israel's duty to alleviate their distress. Time<lb/> was, when such an appeal was
                not required to arouse Israel to “Remember<lb/>
                <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>,” when every Synagogue had its well filled
                charity–box, to dispense<lb/> relief to those who kiss the very ground of
                    <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> in enthusiasm, associ–<lb/>–ated, as it is,
                with holiness. But those days are past. Let it not be said<lb/> that Israel has lost
                its characteristic of being “Sons of benevolence” but<lb/> let these lines
                effectuate the purpose for which they were intended, to<lb/> stimulate congregations
                and individuals to forward their donations to <persName>Sir<lb/> Moses Montefiore
                    Bart</persName>., Israel's Champion, or to the undersigned, and<lb/> Israel's
                God will assuredly reward those who “seek the welfare of<lb/>
                <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>.”<lb/>
