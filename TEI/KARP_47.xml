                undersigned would studiously avoid entering into so<lb/> complex a subject as to the
                propriety of their remaining on those &#40;at present&#41;<lb/> hospitable
                shores&#59; he would merely state that they are there&#44; and suffering all<lb/>
                the horrors of poverty&#44; and that it is Israel&#39;s duty to alleviate their
                distress. Time<lb/> was&#44; when such an appeal was not required to arouse Israel
                to &#8220;Remember<lb/>
                <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>&#44;&#8221; when every Synagogue had its well
                filled charity&#8211;box&#44; to dispense<lb/> relief to those who kiss the very
                ground of <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> in enthusiasm&#44;
                associ&#8211;<lb/>&#8211;ated&#44; as it is&#44; with holiness. But those days are
                past. Let it not be said<lb/> that Israel has lost its characteristic of being
                &#8220;Sons of benevolence&#8221; but<lb/> let these lines effectuate the purpose
                for which they were intended&#44; to<lb/> stimulate congregations and individuals to
                forward their donations to <persName>Sir<lb/> Moses Montefiore Bart</persName>.&#44;
                Israel&#39;s Champion&#44; or to the undersigned&#44; and<lb/> Israel&#39;s God will
                assuredly reward those who &#8220;seek the welfare of<lb/>
                <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>.&#8221;<lb/>
