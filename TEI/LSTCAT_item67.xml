				<p>To the <addressee>Revd I Leeser</addressee></p>
			<p rend="indent(1)"><placeName>Philadelphia</placeName></p>
			<p rend="indent(4)">My dear Sir&#33;</p>
			<p rend="indent(1)">Accept my thanks for the note you favored me by the medium of <persName>Mrs Moise</persName>&#44;<lb/> again for the insertion of my communications &#40;which&#44; by the by&#44; were two&#44; one<lb/> the opinion of <persName>Moses Mendelsohn</persName> extends to &#8220;Could the noble v&#58; <persName>Dohn</persName> etc<lb/> which is quite a different subject&#44; belonging to the advancement of<lb/> Toleration&#44; I ought to have given a superscription&#44; which I omitted<lb/> thinking that it perhaps might have been sent before the<lb/> public with some of your remarks&#44; as I may well ima<lb/>gine what your views must be on the subject</p>
				<p>The object of my communication of <persName>M&#39;s</persName> Opinions was to show<lb/> the public <del>that&#45; what man of more learning genius et philos a<add>&#63;</add><lb/> than our mader<add>&#63;</add> <add>Hebrew</add> </del> have thought on the subject.<lb/>  You apologized or at least mentioned twice in your valuable periodical<lb/> the reason postponement&#44; it surely the communication could not answer the<lb/> expectation raised by such double notice before hand.</p>
				<p>Perhaps the whole was only admitted into your paper as an <add>&#63;</add> too<lb/> bad to be inserted &#38; too good to be rejected.  Believe me dear sir&#33;<lb/> my object is not to render myself conspicuous or even noticed.  If<lb/> therefore I in future should send any thing unworthy of your notice<lb/> do not think it a humiliation for me&#8212;if disregarded I shall<lb/> be proud to find that we have men that supersede my<lb/> humble efforts.  You are a plain honest man&#44; &#40;<persName>von <add>&#63;</add> Schrrot</persName> und <persName>Korin</persName>&#41;<lb/> you understand my feelings.  My aim is &#38; was&#44; to do good&#44; if other men<lb/> do better&#44; I am happy to see it&#44; but feel not hurt&#44; by no means.<lb/>  You know the field I have to labor in here&#8212;my task is an arduous<lb/> and difficult one so that it takes up almost all my time&#44; &#38; would<lb/> to Him who dwells on high&#44; it would bear to Eternity.</p>
			<pb n="2"/>
				<p>My heart <del>aches</del> aches what I see&#44; could I say with the Prophet<lb/> <add>Hebrew</add>.  I would have been satisfied&#44; but I have<lb/> worse than an <add>Hebrew</add>.  But I hope the cause of justice <hi rend="underline">truth</hi><lb/> &#38; Holiness will come off victorious at last<lb/> I labor hard&#44; lecture every <date>Sabbath</date> in the Synag. &#38; again <date>Sunday</date> evening in<lb/> the tabernacle which latter are not <del>just do</del> just against Christianity as to<lb/> the Confirmation of our holy Truth&#8212;besides this I have Hebrew<lb/> school &#40;numbering about 20 pupils fr the age of 10 upwards to<lb/> adults&#44; the latter chiefly ladies&#59; apart of those I teach at the Sunday<lb/> School.  My congregation is &#40;perhaps more than&#41; satisfied&#44; except<lb/> <persName>Mr P</persName>&#58; &#38; some of his ultra attach&#233;s&#8212;whom he continually sets<lb/> against me&#44; but the fury is abating.</p>
				<p>From the above you may suppose that I have enough to do&#44;<lb/> however I was so disgusted at the communications of the irreverent<lb/> <persName>Reverend Millers</persName> insertion that I intend to write some articles to<lb/> the following purport</p>
				<p>Christianity founded on Prophecies which are not fulfilled in<lb/> <persName>Jesus</persName>&#8212;the accommodation theory is of no avail with men of<lb/> Reason&#44; cannot sub<add>&#63;</add> &#8222;Plain scripture.</p>
				<p>The gospels flow fr&#58; an <hi rend="underline">obscure source</hi>&#44; are not written<lb/> by eye witness&#44; <del>wer</del> consequently we see the <sic>forshaddowing</sic> &#40;as<lb/> they may call it&#41; to be but a shadow without substance<lb/> The system of Redemption &#38; Justification by the blood of <add>&#63;</add>...<lb/> is against reason&#44; against scripture&#44; &#38; would have been an act<lb/> of injustice &#38; cruelty of G.d&#44; of which <persName>Dionysius</persName> the tyrant<lb/> did not render one self guilty &#40;<persName>Damon</persName> &#38; <persName>Pythias</persName>&#41; now my dear<lb/> sir if you think this subject not yet fully discussed in your</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
				<p>Periodical I am willing to send in communications&#44; but if this is<lb/> not done I will&#44; though with reluctance try to do my duty.<lb/>  But before hand I beg for no indulgence if you should<lb/> find my communications not relevant enough I shall esteem<lb/> you as I have done till now &#38; respect you more<lb/> for you already approved honesty &#38; candour.<lb/>  My arguments will be taken fr <sic>christian</sic> authorities<lb/> or better <hi rend="underline">Christian divines</hi> of <placeName>Germany</placeName> <placeName>Engl</placeName> &#38; <placeName>America</placeName><lb/> I say divines for the whole system is <sic>acknowledg</sic> to be hollow<lb/> even by man of piety of the other party&#44; it is but infatuation<lb/> that starts man like <persName><sic>miller</sic></persName> to appear in our age with<lb/> absurdities long repudiated by a Herder&#44; <persName>Reinhard Coffler<add>&#63;</add><lb/> Rosenmuller</persName> &#38; the host of even conservative divines<lb/> If you think it worth the while you may just notice<lb/> that in the last page 564 the superscription is omitted<lb/> by <sic>inadvertancy</sic> &#38; coming fr same hand you then<lb/> took them as one.</p>
				<p>Now I must <sic>apoligize</sic> for engrossing so much with<lb/> my affairs.  It would be an object of deep regret if you<lb/> should discontinue your periodical&#44; it is the only one bearing<lb/> distinct mark of Judaism&#44; of <sic>of</sic> character grave enough to discuss<lb/> &#38; to convey more serious information&#44; the other has more an<lb/> ephemeral character&#44; nor seems the author to have the object of Religion<lb/> so much at heart.</p>
				<p>In reference to <persName>Millers</persName> insertions in the last he has become so turbu<lb/>lent that I think that they ought not to be admitted into the Jewish advocate</p>
			<pb n="4"/>
				<p>devoted to the diffusion of knowledge on Jewish Literature &#38; <sic>Rely</sic><lb/> excuse my candor&#44; he &#40;<persName>Miller</persName>&#41; can but claim an act of toleration<lb/> in our exclusive periodicals&#44; but never to speak&#44; thus&#8212;what absurdity<lb/> &#38; pernicious poison is advanced on one page by blind infatuation<lb/> may require more than 20 pages to be answered by sober<lb/> reason &#38; erudite <sic>knowed</sic> of the spirit of the Heb&#58; Language<lb/> &#38; Post Idyle.  We might as well allow then to <del>come</del> sled<lb/> to our lecture rooms &#40;as was done here in my tabernacle<lb/> by a mad cap <persName>Bloch</persName>&#41; &#38; attack us there&#44; and then refute them<lb/> in answer ten times as lengthy.  We ought not to submit<lb/> to this.  I wrote <persName>Mr Bloch</persName> he may come &#38; hear &#38; if he wishes<lb/> to refute he may do it by the medium of the missionary press<lb/> When again asked if I would not allow him to do so on the spot<lb/> I wrote him As we have before us all the trash<add>&#63;</add> that has<lb/> been expectorated<add>&#63;</add> by the <hi rend="underline">hireling</hi>&#44; of <hi rend="underline">honest</hi> but duped men<lb/> this 30 years&#44; &#38; all amounts to null&#44; I could not<lb/> expect that <hi rend="underline">he</hi> could advance any thing new.</p>
				<p>If you deign to answer this&#44; I will tell you before hand as your<lb/> time is precious do it very short&#44; even in abrupt <add>&#63;</add><lb/> phrases&#8212;without ceremony.</p>
				<p>Accept the assurance of the sincere regards to your<lb/> character &#38; labors fr the improvement of our people</p>
