                              <p>Dear Sir,</p>
                              <p rend="indent(1)">I did not receive a letter from my brother in
                                        answer<lb/> to the one I wrote him during your visit here
                                        until a<lb/> few days back and therefore did not write
                                        before but<lb/> now according to promise I do.</p>
                              <p>My brother says he shall reply to you but having been<lb/> very
                                        much engaged in the affairs of Sussex Hall<lb/> he has not
                                        until now had time to write to you,<lb/> or me, he says
                                        having interested himself for<lb/>
                                        <persName>Dr. Benish's</persName> Bible, (the Pentateuch of
                                        which is published,<lb/> and having obtained more
                                        subscribers than will cover<lb/> the cost of it, he is now
                                        going on with the other part<lb/> of the Bible,) he is sorry
                                        he cannot dispose of your<lb/> Bibles, but with regard to
                                        the Occident he will<lb/> with pleasure try and do all he
                                        can, but he says,<lb/> the English do not like subscribing
                                        to foreign<lb/> periodicals although written in their own
                                        language,<lb/> I suppose he will write you more fully on
                                        the<lb/> different subjects you wrote him about as he does
                                        not<lb/> mention much about them to me therefore I can
                                        conclude<lb/> that subject.</p>
                              <p>No doubt you would be interested in a little of the<lb/> English
