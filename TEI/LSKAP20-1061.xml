				<p>for the &#34;interment of such Israelites as may purchase<lb/> lots there&#34; are a <add>&#63;</add>ding to <persName>Mr Cohen</persName> the amount<lb/> paid by him for <sic>encloseing</sic> it with a small <hi rend="underline">wooden</hi><lb/> railing&#44; the said portion to be subject as the rest&#44; to<lb/> the rules in a expectation prescribed by the city council&#44;<lb/> all this was done without the knowledge con&#45;<lb/>&#45;sent of the congregation or any of the constituted<lb/> officers&#59; a few moments after this Ordinance was thus<lb/> hurried through&#44; an obscure number of the Be<add>&#63;</add> intro&#45;<lb/>&#45;duced a resolution to close up the congregational come&#45;<lb/>&#45;<add>&#63;</add> <persName>Mr. Hertz</persName> a member of council being present im&#45;<lb/>&#45;mediately opposed it in such warmth as to induce the<lb/> <del>B<add>&#63;</add> of <persName>Alderm</persName> the</del> man of the resolution to withdraw it<lb/> thus as you may suppose caused much excitement in the<lb/> congregation&#44; it is no doubt the object of the instigators<lb/> of this outrageous and <add>&#63;</add> act to get the city council<lb/> to close up on Beth Hyams<add>&#63;</add> this I do not fear will be<lb/> accomplished as it is on the outskirts of the city.  This<lb/> object no doubt is to force us out&#44; to the Christian Cemetery<lb/> for it is certainly are&#44; Last <date>Saturday</date> after <persName>Mr Ramsela<add>&#63;</add></persName><lb/> has got through with his sermon he <sic>publickly</sic> an&#45;<lb/>&#45;swered from his place that this new cemetery would be<lb/> consecrated this day.  This came on me as well as others<lb/> like a clap of thunder in a cloudless sky&#44; he <add>&#63;</add><lb/> me a word of his intuition to do such an outrage<lb/> upon the feelings of a large portion of the congregation<lb/> the next day I called a meeting of the <add>&#63;</add></p>
			<pb n="1V"/>
				<p>and <persName>Mr. Resinsila<add>&#63;</add></persName> conduct came up on a motion<lb/> for a resolution of censure.  This was opposed ve&#45;<lb/>&#45;hemently by <persName>Mr Sol Cohen</persName>&#44; and of course I came<lb/> in for a large portion of his alone&#44; to my regret<lb/> the <add>&#63;</add> of the resolution withdrew it&#59; so as I<lb/> suppose that afterward will consecrate a service then<lb/> at Judische in this country than has ever been<lb/> a <add>&#63;</add> in this Country&#44; who ever heard of a<lb/> Beth hyan being under the control of a Christian<lb/> Board&#44; still this man who has been selected as<lb/> <sic>an</sic> spiritual guide and who when he came here<lb/> called himself an orthodox Jew&#44; I think his Ortho&#45;<lb/>&#45;doxy more than <persName>Mr. P<add>&#63;</add></persName> for he practices<lb/> what he preaches&#44; but <persName>Mr R.</persName> comes with deceitful<lb/> countenances&#59; Now let me ask you my friend<lb/> can I consistent with the feelings of a true Israelite<lb/> retain my office with such a Hazan&#59; he is to<lb/> remove the body of his child from <placeName>Charleston</placeName> and<lb/> bury him in that new burial place&#44; and many<lb/> who like the originator of this now ask to<lb/> be buried in a &#34;sustainable place&#34; will remove<lb/> the bodies of their deceased friends from its repose<lb/> to this new place contrary to our law&#44; now also<lb/> to remain in office it would not permit them<lb/> as they say they will do so at all hazards and<lb/> I have no <add>&#63;</add> to present them committing a<lb/> sin like that&#44; it is but therefore for me to retire<lb/> before they do.  I have thus given you a statement</p>
			<pb n="2R"/>
				<p>of facts I cannot tell you all I feel on the<lb/> subject&#44; it has made me such&#44; It will very<lb/> naturally be asked as soon as this outrage is<lb/> known who was Parnas at the time and why<lb/> did he permit it&#59; will you my friend do my<lb/> memory the justice should I then be removed<lb/> from this world to tell the world the facts<lb/> as here stated&#44; and that I did all I could to<lb/> prevent it and that having failed to do so&#44; I<lb/> resigned my station&#44; held in a congregation<lb/> which I <add>&#63;</add> my time many and sacrificed<lb/> my health in aid of its pursuits.  It grieves me<lb/> beyond measure that for all my labors and<lb/> <add>&#63;</add> anticipations such should be the result<lb/> but I have the consolation of knowing that I have<lb/> performed my duty&#59; and I can leave my pos<hi rend="sup">n</hi><lb/> with clean hands.  I have thus my friend<lb/> unburdened myself to you and know that<lb/> when the time comes and you should be in<lb/> the land of the living you will do my memory<lb/> justice.  I perceive with much surprise<lb/> from the proceedings of the late <add>&#63;</add> of the remains<lb/> of <persName>Mr Town</persName> that you were a Delegate from<lb/> <placeName>Richmond</placeName>.  I suppose from what I saw in the<lb/> Occident that <persName>Mr Hart</persName> and yourself were to be<lb/> Delegates&#44; from your city otherwise I should have<lb/> been most happy to have appointed you to<lb/> represent our congregation.  <persName>Mess<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> A. Kursheedt</persName></p>
			<pb n="2V"/>
				<p>and <persName>Mr J Soria</persName> were the delegates appointed<lb/> to represent us.  The latter&#44; being unwell could<lb/> not go.  I have <sic>writen</sic> you a long letter<lb/> with a pardon of one <add>&#63;</add>&#44; answer<lb/> me at your <sic>leasure</sic> and believe me as ever<lb/> Your sincere friend</p>
